We bought some Coronas too and they didn't have the common sense to give us lime with them. WE HAD TO ASK FOR LIME FOR CORONAS. WTF IS THAT?!

I order online and head straight to the register when I arrive. Aside from being convenient, this allows me to avoid the giant line that forms every day around noon. 

The food is standard Chipotle, which I happen to like a lot. The restaurant is clean and pleasant, albeit noisy. The parking lot seems to be modeled after parking lots in the 7th circle of hell.

The only gripe I have is that my online order is rarely ready when I arrive. Unless I'm 10+ minutes late, I often have to wait for my food to be prepared.

2418005,2015-08-15,0,wwgH65yjLssksjz8ASU3QA,"I came to the Las Vegas ASD Trade show and stopped by this Chipotle location at the fashion show mall around 8pm on 8/02/15 to get a ""healthy meal"" before I went to bed early. I ordered a burrito bowl and about 4-5 hours later I got severe food poisoning. I was throwing up all night and ended up having to go to the emergency room. The doctor at the urgent care assured me it was food poisoning. Because of your food, I ended up missing the first day of the trade show that I have been prepping for, for almost 2 months and spent thousands of dollars setting up. That is NOT ACCEPTABLE, and I can't even calculate how much potential business I lost. The next three days of the show I was also feeling very sick but forced myself to get up and get to work while being extremely sick. 

After going to the chipotle website and speaking with Jessica, all she had to say was ""well I have good news, it wasn't chipotle according to my investigation""... I think maybe she feels that a doctor who went to school for 10 years is wrong. The only thing I had to eat that day was chipotle besides my normal protein shakes that I always have. And the only thing I was throwing up was chipotle, then after I threw up the chipotle, every time I drank water I was throwing that up too. I would like to say that I have never in my life had food poisoning until this incident, and I have not been sick for the past 6 years of my life. My medical history will prove that. I believe I have a pretty strong immune system as I stay healthy and workout regularly.

I'm completely appalled by not only the restaurants food, but also the customer service provided by Jessica. She had told me she would continue her investigation and get back to me, but I haven't heard back from her since.",17q0YmSPgN-ZDoGUDhsbUQ,2,1,1,o4r2jT5d1whsfd1teu8IUA

We saw that the previous people who got bowls had like a mountain of food so I got even more excited to see huge portions! When it was our turn, we both got bowls. They have brown rice and white rice, we both ordered white rice. There wasn't even enough to cover the bottom layer while the people before got a lot of rice. If they ran out, we would've been okay with waiting but they didn't bother asking. Fine whatever. She got chicken and I got steak. The portion of steak was pretty good for the amount of rice we got! 

Moving down the line, my coworker got extra sour cream and cheese on her bowl. The girl doing it was making faces and mocking her. After that I can hear her whispering rude things about us to the cashier at the end while the cashier was laughing. That's so disrespectful. I'm sorry you make less than $10 an hour and you're miserable at your work, but feel free to quit so someone who would appreciate it could take over. I'm sure my little 15 year old sister would do a much better job than she did. I had no problem calling the manager Jesus after. He was extremely kind and apologetic. Hopefully he rethinks his staff and hires people who deserve the money and experience. 

Now for the food, it was really good! The portion was smaller than everyone elses we saw and smaller than all the pictures, but it's still filling! The flavors are great and I really recommend it. The corn salsa is a little spicy but it added the perfect amount of heat to it and also added a great crunch element to it. To get avocado on it, it is an additional $1.25 so keep that in mind! The location was clean. They have beer and a soda fountain. Who doesn't like a good beer with food? The food for two bowls (without drinks, chips, or anything else) was about $17.00.

In the past, I've had the very cold and very stale chips sitting on the shelf behind the cashier station. The foot is generally good, but chips have always left a lot to be desired at Chipotle. So, I was excited to see them actually making some chips right in front of me!! Anyway, the girl was rude and argumentative.I insisted on hot chips and finally got them. It was also very interesting that her Manager was actually in line behind me. He later came to our table and apologized for her behavior. It was ok because I wasn't ever planning to go back.

He then had the flour tortilla out and scooped out some  white rice. The young lady next to him asks me for my choice of toppings. When done I look over so she can start on my burrito and the tortilla with the rice was no longer there! Yeah, forget it, I'm not going to spend my money on bad and incompetent service.

I got there, ordered my veggie salad and there was less then half a cup of veggies left in the dish, of course they probably have been sitting there for sometime and not fresh.  The lady behind the counter asked me if it was okay just to put those on, OF COURSE NOT!  I am not here paying for old veggies, I want fresh.  So I had to wait about 10 minutes for fresh veggies to be prepared.  Then, they only put on a small scoop, umm, mam, I am only getting veggies and lettuce, please put more on.  And of course when I asked for this I was given a ""I am super annoyed look"" by the employee.  HOW RUDE!  After I finally got my salad, it tasted good, nothing too special, but it was good.

That said I avoid this one when possible but today I had a craving after not having had it for a long while. I figured the retraining chipotle closed for yesterday would have made for some improvements. To her credit the girl greeted with a smile but I didn't make it past the beans. Ordered a burrito with black beans and to my dismay there was chicken and residue in them. I pointed it out and she offered to make new beans. Now call me picky but after all the fuss lately I decided that might be a good idea and keeps them vegetarian friendly. She said it'll be awhile and I said okay and stood there, awkwardly. She didn't suggest how long and that I might have a seat nor offer me a drink or chips while I wait. Neither did the manager who was sitting at a table towards the door think to chime in. Apparently the stove wasn't even on so I assume they still have to heat it, prep the beans and cook them. Made me wonder when all the previous food out was made if the grills weren't even hot. I sat down and after a few minutes the beans weren't out the back yet so I got up and left as the hangry set in. So to sum it up I feel they could be more careful with there food and more thoughtful when a problem arise especially since I was the only one at all in line.

4259354,2010-10-11,0,wwgH65yjLssksjz8ASU3QA,"This used to be an Uno's years ago- in the 1990's. (Yup, used to eat there with my husband, back when, we were just good friends.)  Since then, it's been numerous other restaurants, with little or no success. 

All the restaurants are pretty much the same decor- a little similar to Hash  House A Go Go- metal elements/industrial central to their restaurants. This one seems bigger/spacious than the one near the University, because it is long- shaped like a rectangle, rather than a square. No drive-thru window. There were three other patrons (more empty than the one near the University which is hoppin') and four people working there. Though there are other Fast-Mex restaurants in the area (El Pollo Loco and Baja Fresh- each one has different favorites), I hope that this one finds success at this historically unlucky location. 

Finally went here over the weekend for takeout. I bought a chicken burrito and a chicken salad for a little over $12 (regular price). I love how all the meat is naturally raised (""Food with Integrity"" is part of their mission statement), at these restaurants. I also love that it is made right there in front of you (kinda like Zaba's & Q-Doba). This way, one can customize. I had the chicken (perfectly seasoned), crisp romaine greens, corn, pico de gallo, peppers and onions, and cheese- comes with chipotle-honey vinaigrette. It's so good, but doesn't need much dressing since I also had the pico- but thinking I might just get the peppers and onions because I noticed my super-oniony  (from the raw onions in the pico de gallo) taste in my mouth afterward. Most of the greens were fresh, just had one leaf that was not good. You can get beans, but I skipped them this time. My husband's stuffed chicken burrito had the white rice (no cilantro), pinto beans, cheese, and sour cream. It took him a couple attempts to finish it. I told my husband we should come here more often. This one's more convenient to us since it's just one street away.   

Adult menu is basically three prices- $5.50- vegetarian, $5.85- chicken, $6.10- carnitas, barbacoa, & steak. Select Burrito, Burrito Bowl, Tacos (3), or Salad. Four different salsas to suit everyone's taste- from mild to hot. Extras & Drinks: chips, salsa, guacamole- $1.50-$2.25, Alcohol: beer and margaritas- $2.75-$3.50, Bottled drinks, & Soda (free refills). Kids menu $2.95-$3.95 quesadillas/taco/taco kit. You can order online www.chipotle.com, iPhone App, or by fax- since the menu is the same one used everywhere, no individual location's information is listed, sorry. 

Simple menu, made your way, great food, yummy choices, fast, fresh, quality ingredients, inexpensive, clean- this is a no-brainer for us.",fiGqQ7pIGKyZ9G0RqWLMpg,2,0,5,Zy35lp_Sz8htqgPAFftlqw

I was not in the mood for beans so I selected, cilantro rice, tender juicy beef, green peppers and onions, cheese, pico de gallo, sour cream, guacamole and lettuce. This burrito was fat even without the beans!

The first thing that comes to mind after the first bite is FRESH! The food is not greasy, every ingredient taste fresh and of good quality!

I also chose a side of guacamole and chips! Mmmmm yum I love their guacamole and fresh fried corn chips so much!

We will be back! I have been missing out and will not wait as long as I did to return!
