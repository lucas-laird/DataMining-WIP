Everything from.... Cilantro dressing to marinade for chicken to sides to actual CHICKEN!!!! How do u run out of chicken!!?!? And that has happened to me twice! The manager and owner really need to get ahold of the demand for service if they want to raise revenue... Or maybe they are ok... Just serving who they can with WHAT they have. Plus service is a joke! Most employees think it's funny that they are out of supplies! I don't ! Especially when u have already waited in their drive thru for over 20 mins to only hear....

I've been here twice and I've been disappointed.  The chicken takes a little old, I can't quite put my finger on it.  I can only say that the flavor of the chicken is not what I was use to when El Pollo Loco first came to Vegas.

A little over two years ago (I think), when this location opened, I was in hog heaven.  I loved the place:  convenient, fast, clean, and good.  Fast forward to today, and I'm not going to eat at this particular location any more.  The last three times I've been here, the chicken has been over-cooked (dry), the service has been slow, and the store has been dirty.  This last time, the place was so dirty I had to go up to the counter and ask for a wet cloth to clean off the tables.  It took a while to get the attention of the manager, and when I did, she said she'd send someone out to clean the tables in a bit.  When that person did come out, I asked her to clean the table and watched as she sullenly made some half-hearted swipes with the cloth.  Sigh.  If they had just given me the cloth, I would have rather cleaned the place myself and done a better and faster job without the attitude.  If the management and staff of a restaurant can't be bothered to keep the place clean for their customers, then I can't be bothered to eat there.

Last visit the other day, I walked inside thinking it would be faster (not), I order the same $10 meal, I ask the girl to be sure there is actually meat on the bones since it seems thats all I get.  She laughs....whatever....I wait 15 minutes.....they toss everything in a bag and turn around to grab the churros I ordered.  So I then took the food out of the bag to look at the chicken.  I was right, one anorexic wing and a piece of chicken breast.  I ask the lady behind the counter if they had a wing with more meat since all I get are bones each and every time.  She was nice enough to apologize and give me two additional anorexic chicken wings.  It was the thought that counts...

He asked her why it was so much and she replied that she charged him for the larger combo. He told her that he didn't order the larger size and only wanted to be charged for what he had ordered. She was annoyed that he wouldn't accept her mistake. So now she has to call the Manager to void the order and correct it. The Manager says that it will take up to three days to refund the amount on the wrong order the young lady rang him up for and then has to recharge him for the correct order. I don't understand why? They should be able to cancel the initial charge that was rung up incorrectly by the employee. Something here isn't right. Someone needs to be trained the correct way to fix their error and not inconvenience the customer for the mistake made. I now have two charges on my debit card for a mistake they made one for $30.31 and one for $24.90. Not the correct way to handle this situation. I will be contacting Corporate to lodge a complaint.

The service is so slow.  Like expect to wait 20 minutes.  Is this a gourmet restaurant - or fast food?  Maybe if the foot was edible it would be worth it.
