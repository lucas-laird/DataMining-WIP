The prefect balance of salt and smoke infused in the pig, stacked on an English muffin. It was toasted crisp, yet still maintained its chew. A perfectly poached (not runny eww) egg on top. Then it's finished with a silky tangy hollandaise sauce. I am very picky when it comes to hollandaise sauce, and this one knocks it outta the park!
Their signature dish of the guava chiffon pancakes are legendary! Pancakes with I'm guessing is guava puree mixed in. Griddled perfectly to get the fluffy inside and a few crisp edges! The ""syrup"" it's served with I'd classify more as a glaze. Good balance of sweet and tart. Insider tip. Go with at least 2 people. One order these pancakes, the other order savory.

222724,2017-04-06,0,PkqN5st3zZ_Xce_5QlBtNQ,"Today was my first time trying out this place with my dad. A friend had referred me to this place, saying that their guava pancakes were amazing and I need to get them. This place is very close to our home so once I finally had the time to go today I decided to invite my dad along. This place used to be the Italian restaurant called Parma and they haven't changed much of the inside layout. They still had the little counter/fridge display with different Hawaiian canned drinks and pastries I believe. The manager told us there were two separate sections of the store, the quick order place or the sit down one and we opted to go to the sit down section. 

My dad ended up getting their special today, it was the teriyaki meatloaf loco moco and I got the kalbi with 2 over-easy eggs, and brown rice and of course, we had to order the guava chiffon pancakes. 

The portion sizes were pretty huge. I LOVED my kalbi! Lots of flavor, and very delicious. The brown rice actually paired really nicely with the meat and the eggs. My dad said he was expecting the meatloaf to be boring but he said he was really surprised and loved his as well! He said it had lots of flavor and was very unique.

The guava pancakes were great!! Loved the flavor and it was definitely something I've never had before. Guava fruit can sometimes be sour and tart but this one came out sweeter and more savory. The pancakes were a tinyyyy bit dry as it kept falling apart a little bit but just slather some sauce on there and you'll be fine 


All in all, we had a great experience! The staff was super nice and helpful and definitely friendly. We really enjoyed our meal and would definitely be back sometime soon!",ljimARMl97LDgyp531aYwQ,0,0,5,XadFByiL6ELzNQu4-dKPTg
339753,2016-12-17,0,PkqN5st3zZ_Xce_5QlBtNQ,"Well.. Las Vegas eater gave this a promising  write up and not sure it lived up to it. It may be cause they are only in the spot opening phase but probably won't be returning. 

Guava pancakes- taste like box mix and definitely canned whipped cream. It wasn't bad but not sure what the hype is about. 
Hawaiian sweet bread French toast - okay, nothing special. 
Red velvet pancakes a la mode- dry, dry, dry! The ice cream was even dry if that's possible lol it looked like it had freezer burn or something cause you can see in the photos that it was flaky. 
Hamburger loco moco - we broke our fork trying to cut into it lol over cooked and not a fan of gravy flavor. Didn't eat this at all. They were nice enough to refund this. 
My kalbi was the only decent thing. And I actually enjoyed that. 

However, as our table was close to register we could head they ran out of that for other tables after they took their orders. So they had to run around asking what the guests wanted after.
They also ran out of fried rice and Benedict's were 86d. We also asked for water and they mentioned the filter wasn't set up yet so they only had bottled water. We already ordered sun drinks so just wanted some water to wash away the sweetness.

The staff is nice but it doesn't seem that anyone is fully trained or nobody is really in charge. The poor order takers would kept having to ask the kitchen if they had orders. I always want to see new places succeed but at my specific hour of dining there seemed to be a lot of issues.

It's awkward to have to stand in line to place your order and then go find a place to sit if you're planning to dine in. The food tasted ok, but the price points are off in some things such as their coffee. $3.45 for an average cup of coffee in a paper cup with only one refill is not worth it.  And like others, I don't care to be nickle & dimed, especially when their prices are already on the high side, especially when being served on paper plates. All of the pics of Kalbi & eggs shows fried rice. Well if you want fried rice, that's another extra charge...No thanks, I'll cook my own garlic fried rice!!!  The place has potential, but they need to consider the feedback from customers. I hope they make adjustments before it's too late.",NErEWZQW7sw2TZqRy_8ILQ,0,0,3,qcAaA8HNRmB07XUbkik4ag

Cinnamon's breakfast options do not disappoint. Akin to and rivaling Babystack's, Cinnamon's unique pancake combinations offer a more poignant Hawaiian theme with flavors such as guava chiffon and pistachio cream. 

I had the Kalua Pig signature Benedict. Wow! It was very tasty. My wife had the Kal-bi short-ribs and absolutely loved them. We shared the guava pancakes and asked for a side of the pistachio cream just to try. We both couldn't get enough of that pistachio flavor. The tangy guava sauce was darn good as well.

This was the unexpected highlight of the trip because we received some of the best customer service we've ever had at a restaurant. Pono who was our server, was really great. He was sharp and we really enjoyed talking to him. To top it off, Marty, the manager came over to thank us for coming in and we had some great conversation with him too.

The loaf was first and it was warm and mouth watering. The Benedict was so delicious! I was super impressed by their kalua pig. The pancakes were packed with pistachio flavor, no syrup or butter needed!

There were 10 of us and they knew we were coming and had set the table for us. When I arrived, 4 of the ladies were already there, standing just inside the door. ""We can't sit down until we're all here,"" they said. Our table was right there -- the place was not full and they were obviously expecting us. After about 10 minutes of standing by the door, having to move every time someone came or went, asked again, ""could we sit down and at least look at the menu and have coffee?"" ""No. It's company policy. We seat you all at the same time so you are all served at the same time."" Finally, they allowed us to sit down when 8 of us were there. Thanks.

The waitress was friendly, but it took a LONG time to get our food. When it came, 3 of us got our food, but after a minute it became obvious that the rest was not coming out. So much for the ""company policy"" of seating everyone at the same time so we would be served at the same time. By the time the last order came out, the first of us to be served were nearly finished. And two of the orders had to be sent back -- one of them TWICE -- because they were not right. 

Two of our group had been there before and had told everyone how wonderful it was. Seems like something has changed. 

When it came time to pay (we had asked for separate checks) the waitress took our cards and cash and was gone a long time -- another 8 to 10 minute wait. When she came back, she had all the credit card bills in one tray and all the cash on another tray separated by the receipts. It was a nightmare. ""Who had the half pulled pork benedict?"" ""That's mine. Oh wait, I didn't have coffee -- this isn't mine."" It took us about 10 minutes to sort it out.

I have no idea what kind of tip the waitress got. It wasn't her fault that the kitchen had gotten 2 orders wrong, but the service was snail-slow and not customer-oriented. Maybe that's how they do it in Hawaii, but this is Las Vegas and there is lots of competition.. 

I really do hope they figure out where they've gone wrong and manage to get it right because I heard such good things about it when they first opened and was looking forward to something special. Didn't happen.",Jy9LdvAHx39Jk8mZS6bm0g,0,0,2,_rbXGNSLVIcY6HcxMLOIWA
923991,2016-12-11,2,PkqN5st3zZ_Xce_5QlBtNQ,"So, Cinnamon's Restaurant is FINALLY in Vegas! I'm so happy because being born and raised in Kailua, it was definitely one of our default places.  My husband and his family had frequently dined at the Kailua location since it's opening in 1985, so it's really nice to have a place that we can continue to visit in our new city.

SERVICE - They've been open for 3 days. The staff is still learning the recipes, learning the POS, but are tremendously friendly and accommodating. The excitement of the staff and passion of its managers for ensuring consistency and quality is strongly felt and for me, appreciated. The managers and staff visited our table to make sure everything tastes as it should and if we needed anything.  I appreciated the manager who came over to ask our opinion and specifically asked ""Does everything taste like you remembered it from Hawaii"" Our answer: HELL YES.

FOOD - Um.... DELICIOUS. Tastes JUST like home. They need to get used to consistency of the portion sizes; as our friends food was coming out, they were a little larger than ours, but the flavor was definitely there. I understand they have to get used to portions; their cooks aren't from Hawaii and may not know the portion sizes of the Hawaii locations. But I mean c'mon: RED VELVET PANCAKES. THIS IS WHAT THEY SHOULD TASTE LIKE! Other pancake places here in Vegas make it but it's either too sweet or covered in chocolate sauce. This is what I've been wanting!!! Thank you! Lol

AMBIANCE - Very spacious, open and very pretty. I look forward to them having baked goods and merchandise. With the flavors of the food and the music, it was almost like being in their Kailua location.

Overall: I'm SO HAPPY they're here and I can't wait for them to grow. I'm looking forward to coming here VERY often.

Well look no further. This place knows how to cook good Hawaiian food AMD the customer service is excellent and you feel like you're back home in Hawaii. I heard about this place because my boyfriend kept raving about this place that he had heard of from back in Hawaii. We learned that they opened a restaurant here in Las Vegas about 8 mths ago. 
I had the kalbi with eggs and kimchee fried rice upgrade. The kalbi was done right. It exploded with flavor the way we like it and not the overly sweet way. The kimchee fried rice was decent. My boyfriend had the guava chiffon pancake and loved it. He also had the Portuguese sausage plate with eggs. The Portuguese sausage is the norm that you can find around here at local Asian specialty stores. It was good but I do have one brand that I only buy. 
The staff is very welcoming and greet you with the friendly Aloha spirit. The ambiance reminds me of the tourist restaurants back home that play the familiar kanikapila type of music with some Ka'au Crater boys or some Keali'i Reichel.

Atmosphere and decor is nice, they have ""aloha"" and "" e komo mai"" signs up here and there. I'm sure over time some of the open spaces on the walls will be filled up. 

This time around we had the guava chiffon pancakes (which I was excited to try), the kalbi loco moco, and a side of fried rice. Loved the pancakes. I love all things guava and this was something I've always wanted to try, knowing they existed at the Kailua location. The fluffy pancakes have a hint of guava and the stack is covered in a sweet guava cream sauce with a hint of tartness. We had the full stack without realizing the size of pancakes - they're quite big. If you are planning to try other items along with the pancakes I suggest getting the short (2) stack. 

The kalbi loco moco was good. Meat was very soft and instead of gravy it was covered in the kalbi glaze. Good choice but I think I will try something else next time, perhaps the kalua pig eggs Benedict. 

Workers are all very nice, service is great. The food was served on plates made from palm (that I assume they will be recycling), which was a nice touch. Pricing isn't on the cheap side, but it's a nice place to visit once in a while. We wanted just a little bit of sauce to go with the leftover pancakes but unfortunately they charge $1.50 for extra sauce, so that was a little bit disappointing.",hAWLO7gMBRtQP1pG3TMQ6Q,2,0,4,U0BnvWI0yN9oqaXIwc-zOA

We were warmly greeted by the staff, and the manager offered to help with any questions we may have. We already knew what we wanted after checking over the menu online. We got the guava pancakes, and lox & cream cheese eggs benedict. While we waited, the general manager came up and offered to let us borrow his personal copy of the children's book that tells the story of how the restaurant got it's name, which our daughter loved as we awaited our food. It was a very warm, friendly dining environment that made us feel at home and welcome. The food came out in an appropriate amount of time, and I must say, the guava pancakes are the best pancakes I've ever had in my life. That may sound like it's coming on a little strong and overstated, but I assure you, it is not. If you like guava, this is the breakfast treat for you. Normally, when I eat pancakes, I eat a couple bites but then get that heavy, awful feeling pancakes usually give you, but with these I just wanted to keep eating them.

Atmosphere was great.  We were welcomed right away and handed menus.  Pretty much same selection as Kailua.  We sat to wait for our food.  After a few minutes we were approached and told this area was only full service and we ""had to move to another table"" since we ordered at the counter.

I have never been so humiliated and embarrassed at a restaurant.  Had we not already paid we would have just left.  How incredibly rude!  Not to mention the only sign in this area was ""E komo Mai"" meaning welcome.  What a joke.  I sure wish someone would have told us or there had been a sign designing where to sit.  

The wait for our food was 30+ minutes.  Not cool with 3 kids with us.  It was a Sunday morning but frankly not that busy.  Food was good: loco moco, blueberry pancakes, and salmon Benedict, but nothing spectacular.  The servers were friendly but we had to ask for silverware.

Kona Coffee = perfect cup, not bitter but perfectly dark!

Pro-tip: you can order a whole order (2x) of the Eggs Benedict Mix and match style!

Kalua pork benny: 7/10 was a bit dry and not hot. 
Crabcake benny: 9/10 was good! Nice crab flavor!

Kalbi Loco Moco = 9/10 nice grilled portion kalbi ribs! Awesome with the egg and rice! coulda used a bit more char..

Prime rib loco Moco = 9/10 same as above minus the sweet.  It's steak and eggs over rice with gravy ..cant go wrong!

Guava Chiffon pancake = 10/10! A MUST! Light, fluffy, and the guava was just right! Not too sweet for me!

Pistacio pancake = 7/10 good if you like pistacio. Forgetful after trying the guava chiffon. Get if you hate guava.

EXCEEDED OUR EXPECTATIONS!

We ordered the daily special Korean Omelette, the lox and cream cheese Benedict, and of course, the Guava Chiffon Pancakes; a cinnamons staple.

The tater tots were full of subtle, not too salty flavors from the diced peppers and onions they are served with, the Korean omelette was savory and a little sweet with some tanginess to boot, and the guava pancakes brought us all the way back to our vacation in Kailua.  They are every bit as good as we remembered. We bought some of their Hawaiian coffee to go, and will be back soon.",slI4wdRXGdhd8AeCEaMdoQ,0,0,5,DpQPD0Z_ynBiSTJ8UGaamQ

1899222,2017-02-28,1,PkqN5st3zZ_Xce_5QlBtNQ,"I had a doctor's appointment on this side of town and decided to look up a place to eat. Cinnamon's popped up and I was excited as I love Hawaiian food. 

I really really really really wanted to like this place. But alas I didn't like it at all. :/ Yes it was one of this experiences...:(

It's a weird set up... You walk in and then walk through the dining area to the counter to place your order and pay. They then you give you a number which you place on your table. They then bring you your food. They had their menu up on the wall behind the counter but it was easier to just look at the laminated menu.  The restaurant was cute... But it had more of a country restaurant feel rather then a Hawaiian restaurant...I guess the Hawaiian music helped but it felt a little disjointed as I kept on feeling like I was in a country store. Ambiance (2.5/5)

As soon as I walked in a guy greeted me and asked me if it was my first time. He then explained to me how the restaurant was set up. He was very friendly but he did make a mistake on my order which I questioned.  I guess it's like if a customer has a question don't scan her card then ask her what's wrong. I questioned why my total was so high, then he scanned my card then he asked me what did I mean? I told him to forget it. Cuz it's such a pain to have to go through and rescan my card and try to get the money back on it. He basically charged me for a side of rice...I guess the customer is always right but I got the loco Moco and it comes with rice so why would I want another side of rice? It's like asking for a side of toast with your burger. :/ He did tell me that he could take it off BUT that was after he had already scanned my card. I guess reading my order back to me before charging me is something he was never trained to do. :( But besides that the service was decent. Service 3/5

As stated above I ordered the loco Moco and paid $2 extra to get the Kim chi fried rice instead of plain rice. Let's just say it wasn't worth it. Maybe it's cause I'm Korean and had certain expectations for Kim chi fried rice... But this was just very salty. And when you say Kim chi fried rice make sure that there is more then 4 pieces of Kim chi in the fried rice. :/ The bacon was a nice touch and so was the spam but it did not taste like Kim chi fried rice. It tasted like regular fried rice with some pieces of Kim chi thrown in. The sauce was just brown sauce that could've come from a packet and yes it was salty as well. The hamburger patty was good though. It was a little bland but with the brown sauce it was almost balanced out. Eggs were cooked perfectly over easy. Overall, I would not get this dish again. It was a salt bomb. And I really wished that I could taste the Kim chi. 2/5

I also got their coffee which was decent... But for 3.25....I expected free refills like any other normal restaurant but you only got 1 refill. It was served in a to go cup which was nice touch... But I gotta say even if it was Kona coffee... When your coffee prices are more expensive then Starbucks prices.... Not a great way to go. Price...2/5

With other places that offer better Hawaiian food like island style... This is a pass for me.",L3DxG0n3lRq5N2lv1QNrrA,2,1,3,BhlBPl6sUwOA4gSB_T4p8w

The servers and hostess had flowers in their hair which felt right with the theme. Being an out of towner who loves Local finds, this is a must visit. The Guava Chiffon Pancakes are light and fluffy with a tart yet tangy guava sauce that's drizzled on top. I also ordered the Crab cake breakfast. They had really good flavor but unfortunately had more filler than crab for my preference.  Regardless the pancakes were so scrumptious and you cannot go wrong with spam and eggs. I also ordered their house coffee and it was a delicious blend in my opinion. No need for sugar or cream. But most importantly to recognize is the service.

1962828,2017-02-13,21,PkqN5st3zZ_Xce_5QlBtNQ,"The service is Hawaiian-style friendly but the prices are inflated like we're still on an island in the middle of nowhere. I'm not a fan of being nickle and dimed, and here that seems to be the specialty: over $3 for a cup of basic house coffee with only a single refill, a charge for extra syrups, nearly $4 to add tomato slices to a Benedict, $2 more to add mushrooms and onions to a prime rib omelet that arguably should include them in the first place, and an absurd egg white substitution fee. Even if I could get behind the charges, serving up meals over $10 on disposable plates is just cheap. And it makes no sense considering the upscale interior and metal cutlery. Newsflash, we're not in Hawaii any more. 

The food was okay. I'm used to Hawaiian food being on the salty side, but even ordering the breakfast specials there was a bit too much. The crab cake Benedict has a fairly good flavor, as does the garlic-cilantro salad dressing, but the hollandaise was super salty and the crab cake itself was an odd green color consisting mostly of filler causing it to resemble falafel. But it tasted fairly good. 

I work nearby and might pop in again for breakfast or lunch, but it won't be the first place I think of returning. Props for offering half-portions for several dishes, wish they would add fresh fruit as a side option. They are also adding baked goods to the menu soon.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,42,28,3,QJjdMMp7_EEplDsk2ig3hQ

I do not know how things are at the Hawaii location, but from my experience at this one it was pretty good! There are a lot of breakfast places in Vegas that have original recipes such as babystacks and this place is isn't a bad choice if you're looking for something different. They don't have as much variety, but the menu options are good. I tried the guava pancakes and my girlfriend got the Hawaiian omelette. The guava pancakes were yummy and it wasn't too much of an overload on my taste buds as far as sweetness goes. I also ordered 2 orders of egg whites for my protein. The Hawaiian omelette wasn't too bad, but I wish we had soy sauce available. The laulau was strong in the omelette, so if you're not fan of that you won't like it. When you order the omelette you have a choice between white rice, brown rice, and fried rice. 

The interior is really nice and very clean so far. Staff is friendly and unlike other diners you order up at the front. 

What makes this a 4 star place for me is the pricing. They are a bit on the overpriced end as they charge around $11-$15 for a lot of their menu options and the sides can get pricey. Portions are okay, but you'll get way more at other places. If they can adjust their pricing to mainland prices it would make it a lot better.",F7V-J4rJjWGwtLOcl6hFFA,3,2,4,GK6csdLtxDY_lGuBstKrrw

So when you walk in, you order your food at the register and then you seat yourself kind of deal. Luckily I came here with my girlfriends because if I was alone and waited for food for OVER 45 minutes, I would've demanded my money back. 

Anyways. As said above. It took forever for food to come out. But I was thinking, ""Okay, they just opened up not too long ago. They're probably still trying to get it together. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt if the food is bomb."" But... wrong.

I ordered the Guava Chiffon pancakes short stack and that was probably the only good thing about my meal. It came out first before the crab cake benedict and kalua pig benedict I had ordered. I couldn't even finish the short stack but I'm glad I didn't order more.

Both of the benedicts and the rest of my friends' food had come about 5-10 minutes after the pancakes. First off. The food was way too salty. Like I legitimately got high blood pressure just eating the pounds of salt they put in their food (or I probably was just angry that the food had taken so long to get to the table and have it taste the way it did). And also. The food was lukewarm, closer to being cold. Not even hot. If I'm waiting for years for food to come out, at least have it hot, fresh, and ready, please? Lukewarm IS NOT cute.

Don't know if I should have said something while in the restaurant but it probably wouldn't have been a good idea seeing how hard the girls were working to apologize to customers, etc.

The tots were also flavorful with the onions and peppers. The Guava pancakes were great nice sweet syrup with fluffy pancakes. The pistachio pancakes didn't have an over powering sweetness or anything but still a good pancake. The server was real nice too!

My husband for the short rib loco moco with boneless Korean style short rib, white rice, and a scoop of mac salad. The short rib was tender and perfectly seasoned.

I had a half order of Kalua pork Benedict with kimchi fried rice. I had this same Benedict in Hawaii, and honestly the pork was better here in Vegas!!! I was very happy with my choice.

Easy to find, location not the best but inside the size of the place was very big and the atmosphere very nice.  Very limited on the decor because its new but nice, workers are very friendly and helpful.  
Wife had the mixed plate of kalbi, fried rice, noodles (very small portion) and missing kim chee with very small pieces of spam that looked and tasted old.  Kalbi was very hard to chew and cut.  I had the farmers omelet which was good with (supposedly) buttermilk pancakes (2 ea), the pancakes tasted kinda bland or was it the syrup that was on the table.  Gave it a try, very funny taste and I'm unsure of what it was--a mix of lemon, maple, and whatever.  Coffee is very expensive and so are the refills--no free refills at this place.  Everything was served on a paper plate, why?  Total bill just for the wife and I came to nearly $35 and no discount.  IHOP this place is not.  
I liked the waitress and work staff--very friendly and helpful (not to mention pretty).  They need real better cooks who know Hawaiian style foods-the ones that were there were not the best.  Will we go back-maybe not due to the very high prices just for breakfast and drinks.  Best advice-bring your own drinks or drink water with lemon--oops they might charge for the lemon.

First time here, so I tried their specialties: chiffon-papaya pancakes and eggs Benedict. 

Coffee is good, solid coffee. Menu claims 50% Hawaiian blend, but doesnt describe the other half. 50% mystery coffee. Folgiers? Maxwell house? Starbucks? 

Pancakes are exceptional. Fluffy and lightly sweet even without the syrups or sauces. Unfortunately, the chiffon-papaya sauce was so sweet I could feel a cavity forming from just one bite. I recommend ordering the sauce on the side and separate the papaya from the chiffon. The papaya sauce was fruity and delicious. I wish it had just that sauce. 

Benedict: ""Award winning hollandaise sauce""? Who hold this contest? I've heard of beer tastings, but I can't wrap my head around a room full of people drinking cup after cup of hollandaise sauce. Maybe a new bar theme? But I digress...

The lox Benedict was very good. The sauce was thick and tasted good to me.  But I'm untrained and can't be trusted to judge. I'd get it again.

We sat down and a reasonable time later, we received our food. Initially, I was confused at the paper plates, plastic forks, and plastic knives.

You walk in and order from the counter, they give you a number and you sit down. For not being a full table service restaurant and serving with plastic utensils, this makes the prices seem even more high.

Register person forgot to ring in my friend's pancakes though we didn't know. I received my sweet bread french toast ($8.75!) - came with about 6 half slices - not very many and it's only bread... how can it be $8.75 in Vegas (it doesn't even come with a side of meat). The coffee is also $3.50 and they give you a chip for 1 refill. What??? Since when does brewed coffee for $3.50 include only 1 refill?

My friend ordered the pancakes as mentioned but also ordered a benedict, what they are supposed to specialize in. After probably 15 minutes of waiting and me getting my french toast, the cook comes out to say they ran out of benedict sauce and can he wait. He said ok as the cook said maybe another 10 minutes. He asked for the pancakes while he waited to which the cook said ok. 15-20 minutes later and my french toast is now gone and still no benedict nor pancakes. I looked at the receipt and the pancakes weren't even on the receipt - she forgot to ring it in and not only that, the chef didn't say anything like ""I don't see pancakes on your receipt"" when he asked if he could have them while he waited (regardless, they couldn't bring out one or two pancakes while we waited??).

Finally stopped a worker who said they weren't happy with the benedict sauce and so were making it AGAIN so it would be another ??? minutes - they couldn't answer how long. So my friend ended up just eating guava pancakes that they ended up bringing, which he said (and looked) were dry.

In the kalbi plate everything is on their own while in the loco moco the rice is placed under the meat and the egg goes on the very top. I also assumed loco moco always came with gravy but not in this case. 

I had questions myself as I saw in Yelp photos they appeared to have macaroni salad but they didn't have it listed on the menu as a side or extra. The server said that it only comes with the loco moco. So FYI. 

Both dishes were very delicious. The kalbi was a bit sweet for my liking but it balanced out with the rice. The macaroni salad was pleasant as well. I had a taste of my partner's kimchi fried rice, it looked like it included chipped up sausages. 

The guava chiffon pancakes were amazing also. I thought they would be guava infused pancakes but I believe they were just buttermilk pancakes with a beautifully pink cream sauce all over it with whip cream. It was fluffy and soft and really divine. It was tangy and reminded me of a cheesecake. 

Our server Jill kept checking up on us and was great.",unDnZob7OUe3pHZSmds3QQ,0,0,4,TREbJNSGEmOHuEmpLLeWYw

I don't know who the manager is now but she didn't even come over to talk to us after the screwup in our order. I ordered a Farmer's omelet and received a Hawaiian. How this happened is beyond me. I even told the waiter I don't want tomatoes with the omelet. Also, I thought there would be potatoes with the omelet and toast but all I received was toast. The waiter said I didn't specify so they just game me toast. How was I to specify if I wasn't even asked? 
The coffee mugs are way to small and the coffee is lukewarm when  served. Wouldn't it be better to have pots or thermos on the table instead of the server having to come over numerous times for refills? 
Btw, the food is ok. Not great and not too bad but not worth the hassle. 
I haven't been here in awhile since our last visit wasn't pleasant either but I decided to try again in case something changed.  Nothing changed and now I now NOT TO COME BACK AGAIN. Is this the way you want to deal with mistakes Miss Manager?",9BMXGhQuCAxUv7UFmyMwkg,1,0,3,3QRF65VGuPXJ_GK-R49lOg

2713190,2018-04-25,0,PkqN5st3zZ_Xce_5QlBtNQ,"I went to Cinnamon's for breakfast on a weekend because the food looked so good in the pictures.  Upon arriving, I noticed the lovely decor (island chic, very welcoming). There seemed to be some hullabaloo at the front entrance with parties being seated. I waited my turn and was promptly seated. The hostess was very kind and gave me the specials for lunch as it was exactly 11 am.

As I was looking over the menu, a young lady came by to take our table's drink order.  We ordered coffee with half and half. Upon her return, she took our food order and I reminded her that we needed half and half.  Our food came out and I reminded her a second time. While she got that we looked at our food, the orders were correct.  I had ordered the Portuguese Sausage and Eggs (served with a side of country tots) and a short stack of the guava chiffon pancakes. My companion had ordered the kalbi ribs and eggs with a side of tomatoes (off menu and with an upcharge because the dish comes with a choice of starch).  The cream finally came out and we dove in.

1) The guava pancakes were such a let down. They are just regular pancakes with a sauce on top.  It tasted very yogurt-y and I couldn't eat it.
2) The Portuguese Sausage was decent. It would be better if they left it on the grill just a bit longer.
3) The ""Country"" Tots were over cooked tater tots with pieces of bell pepper and onions.  I was expecting the tots to be transformed somehow or at least cooked decently.
4) Eggs were scrambled and ok.
5) The Kalbi ribs were sent back. They tasted as if they had been marinating too long in the fridge.  This was a real shame because they looked grilled perfectly.  The dish was replaced with Portuguese Sausage.

Overall, the concept of the restaurant is good. It reminded me of BabyStacks down the road.  The food quality, however, needs work. When the food is processed (tots) and its still not right, that's a problem.  The manager should consider doing rounds to check on tables.

3) Crabcake Eggs Benedict
4) Portuguese Sausage/Eggs/White Rice

In fact, both our Host & Waitress were very friendly & attentive. Yes, your food doesn't come out as quick as it would if you were at Denny's- but it's well worth the wait. 

Coffee was a bit pricey, but it's really good Kona coffee- if you appreciate a good cup of quality coffee (with one refill), then you won't mind the price.

Drove 25 mins from the M Casino to place our order. First thing the person at the register said ' take out is a 1 hr wait... really at 10:30 in the morning? No good Morning, Hi, Welcome??? 
So we ordered, and during our long wait observed the following.  Mad Freaking Chaos!!!! 
There were 6 people behind the counter standing around, while the manager 'assume he was, since he wore green shirt' ran around the restaurant like a crazy, frazzled person' people kept asking for either, utensils, drinks, plates etc. 
For a place where all tables were not filled- why the mad rush, he kept barking orders and everyone else on his staff were on island time, there were 2 people that swept the same floor in the space of 10 mins and it was not even dirty- yet no one bothered to check on the people dining to see if they needed anything.  
He needs to delegate a whole lot better, or pick a different career in my humble opinion . His staff needed to kick it in gear and and service the people dining. I have never seen anything like this in my life.  We stood there for 15 mins past the 1 hr wait time, watching the kitchen and person packing our food argue about the order. I'm loss for words at this point, hopefully the food $85 worth,  will compensate for this horrible experience. Here's a concept: maybe someone should have extended a courtesy, sorry for the long wait, would you like some water while you wait?... I mean something- Worst Customer Service Ever!!!

I get their coffee, best coffee out there made just by them. If you like it as well, you can actually buy it from them, can't find it anywhere else. 

The guava pancakes is delicious. But a warning, it is pretty sweet. The actual pancake is so fluffy though. I also got the pistachio pancakes, it isn't as good as the guava, and next time I will try the red velvet pancakes and see if that compares to Babystacks. 

My beau got the prime rib loco moco and that thing is a huge portion! He loved it. He got it with gravy once and the other time he got it with au jus sauce and he liked it way better with the au jus.

I was excited to try out Cinnamon's since I enjoyed their Waikiki location and shared their opening news with out-of-town friends who would be visiting us. Unfortunately, Cinnamon's left us very disappointed and I will not be going back. Reading other reviews, I knew to be patient with the service. A very large party had come in right before us, the staff told us that they had no warning of them and they had taken up one side of the restaurant. They said the wait on food would be longer than usual (about 30 minutes), which we were fine with. We placed our order and received our # and receipt. I wanted to grab something already made and small to tide us over in the meantime, so I ordered a slice of banana bread separately. The cashier put that on the same # as our original order. The banana bread was delivered a few minutes later and I made sure to tell the server that delivered it that this was not our full order, and we were waiting for the items we ordered on our first receipt so there was no confusion. She let us retain our # card. 30 minutes came and went and still no food. We started seeing others who had ordered after us get our food, so we brought this to the attention of the original server who delivered my banana bread and one of the servers wandering around (they didn't seem to have any dedicated servers to a table, it looked like any one could hop in and help you). For the next 30 minutes, we realized all the servers around us were actively avoiding our table, refilling the waters of everyone else around us, but not our table and avoiding eye contact with us even when we tried to flag them down. No one seemed to want to take responsibility for our order. We talked to the cashier who originally took our order and said it would be right up and there was a mistake and our ticket was lost. Another 30 minutes pass. I was shocked to see that they didn't make our ticket a priority, as they continued to provide food to others who ordered after us. We spoke with the assistant manager who apologized and said she would check on our food again. At this point it had been 90 minutes since we ordered and we really were tired of waiting and asked for a refund. She offered us a bag of chips for our next visit, but I thought that was a big assumption to make on her part that we could come back again. I know she meant well, but our time was wasted and it was bizarre that the staff was avoiding taking the reigns to resolve the issue. We asked to speak with the restaurant manager. The manager came from out of the kitchen with a ""What more do you want from us?"" attitude, even though this was literally the first time we were speaking to him. I was trying to explain to him the most upsetting issue regarding the service and he just didn't seem to care and seemed like we were bothering him.  My biggest gripe was that I had foreseen this issue and proactively spoke to a server about it to make sure our ticket did not get lost. The assistant manager was much more concerned and apologetic, letting us know the staff would be retrained on these escalated issues. We left the restaurant very frustrated and hungry, but at least we got to try out The Bagel Cafe nearby. I know there can be a lot of issues with franchise expansions, but this location did not have the aloha spirit and service I saw in Hawaii or that I would expect from any business.",Y8adrWFzckrjuC11aAs9Og,13,8,1,gGG5LLZa65GJN81oQdx2rQ

For me, Hawaii is home. And this place took me back. Don't let the name fool you because it's more than just a sweet place to eat at!

This is not your typical L&L Hawaiian or Aloha Kitchen joint. This place is legit, as it is based from Hawaii. From the food to the service, I enjoyed it all.

Upon arrival, my group was promptly greeted and seated. The restaurant's layout is very open and there is plenty of space and seating throughout. The decor is very simple, but the little words and messages they have set up are little reminders of home. :]

I have read a few reviews about the service of this place, but as for my group and I, the service we received was just fine. Our waiter's name was Pono, and he was very patient and attentive with us. He understands the meaning of the Ohana welcome and service. Even though we came here around the time they were pretty slow, I'm sure the service wouldn't have been any different.

As for the food, everything was 'Ono (delicious) :p So many Yelpers have mentioned the Guava Chiffon Pancakes and I couldn't agree more. The fluffiness and taste... BOMB. lol One of the best items on the menu and it's definitely a must-try. The Loco Moco was really good too. So 'Ono! As for the omelets, it's awesome you can create your own. You really can't go wrong with everything else they have to offer. If you love Hawaiian-style breakfast or just the island-flavored food in general, you'll enjoy this place.

Then to the pancakes. Our first impression, these are huge! Good thing we got the short stack instead of the full!

The crab cakes were just as delicious, although a tad greasy, and the accompanying sauce had a spice that got my nose running. The pancakes, while very tasty, were not the best choice of a starch. It was just too much food. I recommend ordering pancakes on their own because they are quite large, about 8"" in diameter. The pistachio cream pancakes were our favorite.

Went there this morning for breakfast with my family. One of the first few ppl there and was told they were out of Kalbi. Weird. Sucks too since I was planning on ordering that. Anyways, we ordered the Guava Chiffon Pancakes(really good), Red Velvet Pancakes(cake-like but good), Banana Pancakes(good), Crab cake Benedict & Tots(very good except the crab cake had an overly-fishy taste to it-if that makes sense), and Prime Rib & Eggs(horrible!) It was the most expensive thing we ordered but the worst tasting. VERY dry & bland! Overall the food was ""okay"". But what saved me from giving it less stars was the service-sad but true.

Their tater tots are yummy. They make it extra crispy, topped with onion and peppers. Good portion....lots! I had the traditional Canadian bacon egg Benedict and it was so-so, but I was told that the crab cake was ono! Next time I try. 

Coffee: Cinnamon's have their own House Blend Private Label Coffee. It's 25% Kona and 25% Kaua'i. It's $3.25, but well worth it! I can totally just live on this coffee, they sell it by the bag for take home too!

When you first walk in, it is nicely furnished. However, the restaurant is huge that they tried to make it look Hawaii-ish with the art and yet contemporary with the colored chalkboard menus. But because there is so much wall, it is a good try.  

I do have to say, looking around while being seated, the restaurant looks very clean. Major plus.

So we sit and review the menu which isn't very long making it easier to decide, so you would think. They have the usual HI breakfast items, but I can make that home. So my husband and I decide we would share and not order so much food since we were going to the museum following brunch that we didn't want our food to spoil. So we decided on the lau lau omelet and coconut french toast. My husband also ordered a side of the kim chee fried rice, because it isn't my favorite. So glad that we shared because it was a lot of food.

I do have to say that I moved from HI in 2001. One of the things that impresses me about HI is the fusion of foods or something so creative. Each time I go home to HI, I try something new. And Cinnamon's lau lau omelet is a major favorite of mines. 

French toast also yum. Before I forget, it is Hawaiian sweet bread french toast, so we had to order it. And the coconut syrup, not overly sweet. But good enough that my husband actually poured some into his coffee.

Service, EXCELLENT! Our server was very helpful. I didn't realize that Cinnamon was open for only 8-months!

I had the Hawaiian sweet bread french toast and a cup of coffee. The French toast was very fresh and obviously was cooked to order based on how long it took to receive it. Unfortunately, although the texture was nice it was flavorless. Their coffee is bad. Dark and murky and really should not be anywhere near $3.25. what makes it worse is that they use non-dairy creamer instead of real half and half. I am not 100% sure but I think that the French toast was served with a little ball of margarine, not butter.

I noticed that the people sitting next to me ordered the guava pancakes and the red velvet pancakes and they look amazing. I would go back and try again because the service was good and it is a nice, clean place. I just do not recommend the French toast or the coffee.",msxc1VlPTD6E-0Kns7bIFw,0,0,3,US6vV4ZmhyEQb1gzGUPyQw

3598427,2017-08-20,0,PkqN5st3zZ_Xce_5QlBtNQ,"It's early Monday morning and the fiancé and I are still tired yet hungry from the weekends activities. Breakfast naturally comes to mind. The fiancé immediately searches yelp for a few recommendations when he comes across ""Cinammon's"". You mean, Hawaii's own Cinnamons? I couldn't believe it, so without hesitation, off to Cinnamons we go.
  We entered the establishment across from Trader Joe's, and it was pleasant with an Aloha vibe. The hostess immediately seated us with a smile and asked if were locals, since I assume there are many out of town visitors. I'm surprised to see it isn't busy, but then again it is Monday and it is back to school (something I don't mind as much).
  We are handed the menu as I order their Kona coffee. I notice the menu isn't obnoxiously long with pages of food. I prefer a short menu since I know the back of house usually focuses on flavor and presentation, not to mention timeliness when the menu isn't as extravagant.
  How can I choose from all the yummyness? So we decided on:
1. Short stack of guava pancakes
2. Short stack of pistachio cream pancakes
3. Full order of Kalua pig eggs Benedict with tots
4. A side of kimchi fried rice. 
Let's review!!!

1. The guava pancakes had a nice presentation with guava sauce slathered and a generous dollop of whip cream to top it off. The pancakes were  moist and fluffy and the guava sauce complimented it nicely with a sweet and tart kick. Delicious! Just make sure to have a glass of milk or coffee near by since the pancakes will definitely choke you with goodness! 
2. The pistachio cream pancakes were unique and just as delicious. These were moister than the guava 'cakes since it looks like the pistachio flavor was infused in the actual pancakes and again drizzled over the top with cream and a generous sprinkle of pistachios. WOW!!! These are a party in your mouth, but don't forget to sip on some coffee with each bite to help you swallow!!! 
3. A full order of the kalua eggs Benedict is two benedicts instead of 1. I recommend the full order since these are irresistible. The kalua pig itself is super tender and moist (I love that word) and slightly salty. A great combination with eggs and their creamy hollandaise sauce. The eggs were poached perfectly with a nice runny yolk to add additional creaminess to coat your mouth. The side of tots were probably one of my favorites I've had in a while. They were crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, and mixed with a lovely sauté of peppers and onions. Great compliment to the dish as it adds texture to the soft tenderness of the pork. 
4. The kimchi fried rice is a burst of flavor in your mouth. A bit salty and tart from the kimchi is a tasty flavor profile that would probably taste best with sunny side up eggs and a protein of choice. Accompany the rice however you choose, it is delectable regardless! 
***extra.... the Kona coffee had a sweet roasted aroma and tasted even better. Smooth finish and served in a to go cup, which I didn't mind since I sipped on it almost all day. It was, however, slightly pricey at almost $5!!!! 

Cinnamon's is a breakfast joint I'll be revisiting soon, since there are tons of other options I'd love to try. It is a quaint, clean, and friendly environment, prompt service, and an overall comfortable ambiance. Our total came out to about $36 before tip, just about $18 pp, not the cheapest, but definitely affordable if you're looking at it in a quality perspective. We ended up with leftovers, but if you love ""super sized"" meals, you may want to order more dishes. I can't wait to see more Cinnamon's pop up through out the rest of the valley, making it a staple on the 9th island.",d4XCDUWioKG1XxzSzCkbTA,0,0,5,_VBqqzwA9uTcgDspMdws8Q

The food here is gratifyingly rich. Sweet items such as the guava chiffon pancakes ( a must if you like speciality pancakes and have a sweet tooth) are tasty, syrupy goodness, even if a little too sweet for me. The savory items are equally enchanting, such as the loco moco (am I saying that right?) and the kahlua pig and other meat dishes. The coffee is pretty good, too. (Step aside, Starbucks). The only thing that others have complained of, which is legitimately an issue--though less of one than before--is the wait time. But I believe the restaurant has done a lot to remedy this problem. This most recent time I went, we waited only a short time, and the food came out in a reasonable time. The service staff is friendly and helpful, too.  On the weekends, there is live music, in the Hawaiian style, and also reggae! Really cool.

Cinnamons has a great atmosphere with very friendly servers and great selection of food that is super refreshing after seeing a lot of the same choices given over and over at regular chains. The Hawaiian influence is very obvious as soon as you enter the door as the whole decor is island themed. You have two selections when entering when you dine here, either go up to where they have a order  desk or dine in like a traditional restaurant which can be confusing if you are not used to coming here. The waiting area is tight we came around 11 am and it was packed already  and we were forced to wait around the entrance with 3 other families and it got pretty intimate. We waited around 10 minutes opting for the dine in experience and after sitting down our waitress came to take our orders. 

Their in house coffee is great as it is made with kona beans which gives it a unique taste, I paired it off with a batch of the pistachio pancakes which are not as weird as you might think. The pancakes were nice and warm with a small green paste with bits of pistachios on top, the menu called them yummerz but let me say I can back this up and officially give it a yummerz approval.

They always say that Las Vegas is the 9th Hawaiian Island... i'm a life-long Hawaii girl living on the mainland now and I certainly miss my local Hawaii food.  Cinnamon's is a classic.  It's a must do for any visitor to Hawaii - and the original Cinnamon's is NOT in Waikiki.  It's no tourist trap.  It's in Kailua, Hawaii, on the island of Oahu.  Tourists and locals alike make the trek out to Kailua, stand in long lines, and wait to eat at Cinnamon's.  Luckily, the Las Vegas location didn't require much of a wait.  But I'm certain once people learn about this place, it will start filling up.  You can get your local staples here like Loco Moco, Portuguese sausage, kim chee fried rice, and of course, the Cinnamon's classics like Macadamia Nut Pancakes!!  So... the coffee cups are pretty tiny, but they come around and fill them up constantly so no problem!  And you cannot beat the service - it's local style... what do you expect!!

3660287,2016-12-23,0,PkqN5st3zZ_Xce_5QlBtNQ,"Let me start by saying this is the soft opening for Cinnamon's. I kept an open mind after reading other reviews on yelp, especially since soft openings are meant to work out kinks and get feedback. This will be a long review, readers beware ;)
  It's my first time here, and I heard from Hawaiian friends Cinnamon's is worth it. Friday morning at 8am, we had the place to ourselves. Walking in, I liked the space. The decor is nice, spacious enough to accommodate big parties without tripping over tables stuck too close together. We were greeted right away by one of the servers with menus in hand. She explained how to order (at the counter, then sit down with your number) and she gave us recommendations for popular menu items.
  Marty the GM took our order at the register. He's very personable at all times, which I appreciate very much. It's one thing to offer customer service when something goes wrong, but to have that demeanor at all times is what impresses me. 
  Most important: the food! My mom and I ordered the Guava Chiffon and Red Velvet short stacks, a side of bacon and spam, and two coffees. The pancakes were cooked well and tasty! If I had to nitpick, I see how the Guava Chiffon pancakes can be overly sweet. We tend to order the fixings (sauce/syrup and whipped cream) on the side with pancakes anyway, and this helps to enjoy the pancakes and appreciate the sweet Guava sauce to your taste. The Red Velvet pancakes were very tasty, I prefer them to have the stronger coco taste as these did. They were slightly too crumbly, but the thicker cream cheese sauce remedies that. The bacon and spam were cooked perfectly, not too greasy, nice and crisp.
  We didn't need the free coffee refill, one was enough for us but the server still offered anyway, asking if we wanted it to go (way to anticipate the guest needs!)
  Service was great, even after the place started filling up. The servers kept checking on us, and Marty took the time to speak with us further. Cinnamon's values are apparent here: ohana and the aloha experience.
  A couple of suggestions I hope the restaurant addresses: 1) the bamboo plates were ok, but I'd much rather have regular silverware and glassware instead of the plastic kind. 2) Almost all restaurants in Vegas offer complimentary water and free refills of coffee. This is the desert and a 24 hour town, we run on water and coffee! 3) Servers: give us your names! Your service is great, you're good at what you do, and I want to know your name. Especially if you offer, ""let me know if there's anything else I can get for you.""  I'd rather not call you ""excuse me"" or  ""hey you"" :)

My three children and I had brunch here yesterday to celebrate Mother's Day early and try to skip the crazy restaurant crowds Vegas usually has on holidays. We were seated at 11:30, ordered our food at 11:35 and we were served at 12:31!!! Thank goodness my three children are extremely well behaved, even though my two year old was understandably getting anxious. While we were sitting there quietly and obviously upset with three frowning, hungry children, nobody approached us to apologize for the wait until 47 minutes of waiting (by this point I started checking my watch). At 51 minutes, the manager came by to apologize for the wait as well because they were ""really busy"". There were eight tables total in my area and only 2/8 of those tables were served their food. The table next to me that finally got their food were waiting as long as we were. 

There was another customer who made a big stink about the wait and got up to leave a couple of times but his wife stayed behind so he and his son eventually came back and were finally served their food. The manager spoke to him apologizing a few times and then I hear that customer got a 20% discount to ""make up for the wait"" but myself nor the other customers sitting next to me got that same discount. Because we were being polite and waiting patiently? That's really unfair. I would never ask for a discount for a long wait time but to not be offered one because I didn't make a big scene about it isn't fair at all. 

The Kailua location was one of our family's favorite places to go when we were living in Hawaii. After seeing the mixed reviews when this place first opened, I held off on visiting for a few months to give them time to work out their kinks but a 50+ minute wait for breakfast food is unacceptable. I just saw other reviews from over three months ago complaining about the same thing and it's an issue that still isn't fixed yet. Go to Baby Stacks if you want great food and quick service.

This Vegas location is owned by the same owner and run by some of its original Hawaii staff, with the same secret recipes, such as the Guava Cheffon pancakes, which is my personal favorite.

Guava Chiffon Pancakes - Only got the short stack but was pleased nonetheless. Tartness of the guava nectar was offset by the sweet flavor of the sauce (which we got on the side).
Kahlua Pork Eggs Benedict - Usually not a fan of Eggs Benedict in general, but these were really good. Kahlua was moist, not like most Hawaiian restaurants where the pork is too dry. We got it with Fried Rice, which was unexpectedly delicious. Had a hint of garlic taste to it.
Kalbi Loco Moco - I had to order this with mushrooms and onions and what a great addition. Kalbi was tender and perfectly cooked. The amount of rice and eggs that came with the meal was generous. I would come back just for this alone, wow.

Also, the General Manager came by to our table and told us the backstory of the restaurant and asked how we heard of it. Really nice touch.

When you enter, you walk to the center register area and place your order.  You're given a card to place on a holder on your table.  When your food is ready, it's delivered to your table.

I ordered the guava chiffon pancakes with a coffee.  The coffee was brought almost as soon as I sat down and I was given a chip with the explanation that it was good for one refill.  I was told at the register that there was one refill on coffee.

There are a number of pancakes and Hawaiian dishes on the menu and the aloha spirit is evident in the decorations of the area.  This was the former home of Parma by Chef Marc and there are two good sized rooms.

In a short time, my short stack of guava chiffon cakes arrived.  Two cakes at a price of $7.75.  The coffee is $3.25 and I used my chip for a refill.

The guava chiffon is sweet and unless you like guava, I wouldn't recommend them to you.  The pancakes were fluffy and cooked just right.  You are given plastic ware and the food is served on a heavy paper plate with sloped sides.

I liked the cakes but I probably would choose something else another time.  Two friends showed up right after I started to eat and I really had my eye on the one person's order of a half portion of a benedict that looked quite good.

Of course coming to Cinnamon's on a Saturday morning is a tricky proposition, the place was crazy!  Locals everywhere!  That's what we get for the 1st Cinnamon's ever in Las Vegas!  Waiting time wasn't bad but there was a small line, took about 15 minutes for us to get a table.  After that things didn't take very long.  For breakfast we ordered:

*Red Velvet Pancakes ($7.25!) - short stack of 2 (yah TWO) world famous pancakes with vanilla-white chocolate sauce & powdered sugar

*Portuguese Sausage ($8.95) - 3 small pieces (!) of Portuguese Sausage with 2 eggs and an upgrade to fried rice ($2!)

*Hamburger Classic Loco Moco ($9.50) - home made hamburger patty with gravy and 2 eggs with an upgrade to fried rice (another $2!)

Man, what is with these ridiculous prices?  Honestly, Denny's right down the street would give us much better value!  With probably better servings too!  I gotta say folks...we were still hungry, we ate again after an hour!  So little food for the amount we pay!  Come on...you are a Hawaii institution!  You should know we local people are BIG @$$ people!  We come hangry!  Really, how long did you guys think 3 pieces of Portuguese sausage was going to keep me full?  With a tiny scoop of fried rice?  That short stack of Red Velvet Pancakes was kinda teeny too...my kid was eating off of my plate after she dusted them off, and she's a small eater!  I was expecting a Loco Moco of epic proportions too, fell short!  You sure you put enough rice & gravy with this buggah?  Some poho dis kine!

Cinnamon's, what is with these strange disposable wooden plates?  Not really feeling them.  Please use real dishes!  

Thankfully our server was quick & pleasant.  She is from Maui like I am so we got along just fine.  Even she was like, ""Did you want to order something else?  You big guy das why.""  She knew I was still gonna be hungry!  Not a good sign.  

Cost after tax & tip for food & drink came up to just over $40!  Whew!  You know for sure in Hawaii das nuts!  Please Cinnamon's, you guys either gotta up the portions, or lower the price!  I get it, you guys are wanted here in Las Vegas but wow, I wanna be a repeat visitor!  No can with how much moolah I spend!  Right now there are just too many options for breakfast in town.

Cinnamon's is ""Hot & New"".  New to the 702, not to the 808.  Cinnamon's is clean, spacious, and the service is great.  They're known for their Guava Chiffon Pancakes and Signature Benedicts.  I don't prefer my eggs Benny style and can't eat fruit.  I also heard from other Yelpers that their stacks are a little dry.  So, as far as their signature plates go, I didn't even give them an attempt.  I did have their Kalbi and Prime Rib meals.  Both come with two eggs and a side.  The Kalbi is delicious and marinated perfectly.  Cinnamon's Prime Rib meal is a steal at only $16.95.  You get 10 oz. of prime rib, two eggs, and a side.  Now that's value that taste pretty good too. The rest of the menu consist of their Signature Benedicts, 5 types of pancakes, omelets, and 3 types of Loco Moco's.  Overall, I'm a fan and since I have an office close by, I will be back soon.  Loco Moco, you are next.  


Just a note...
My only gripe is the upcharge for an extra egg or egg whites.  An extra egg is $1.75 and egg whites is $2.25.  It never made sense to me why egg whites would cost more than whole eggs.  Pay more, get less??? This can get very expensive if you eat as many eggs as I do.",y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ,14,10,4,NepWmaXeCWon_EhkQXzlgQ

4137821,2017-01-25,1,PkqN5st3zZ_Xce_5QlBtNQ,"The Guava Chiffon Pancakes were calling my name so off to Cinnamon's we went. Their system of ordering & paying first is unusual for a sit down restaurant. We ordered a short stack of Guava Chiffon Pancakes, Kalbi plate with fried rice & scrambled eggs & a Kalbi Loco Moco with fried rice. The Hawaiian radio station playing Island Music really helped to give you that island feel. The restaurant is open & comfortable but rather plain, expected more island decor.                                  

Anyways onto the food- Unfortunately, my eggs were the only thing hot on my plate. The Fried rice & Kalbi were cold so I sent my plate off to be warmed up. When my plate came back, everything was hot but the Kalbi was in weird big chunks not thin or flat like Kalbi should be. Some of the meat chunks were all fat, it was inedible. I showed the Manager & he agreed that the Kalbi didn't  look like they should so he had the cook prepare 2 other pieces of Kalbi. By the time the new correctly looking pieces of Kalbi were brought to my table, what was left of my fried rice & eggs were cold. Not happy about that!                    

The Kalbi Loco Moco was cold as well but he was too hungry to care. He said my Kalbi was flavorful but his wasn't. Needless to say the hubs has no interest of ever returning. I, on the other hand understand that they just opened & are still figuring out stuff. My Kalbi had good flavor although the fried rice scoop was rather small & needed some salt.                                    

I thought the Guava Chiffon Pancakes were good, maybe a stronger Guava flavor would enhance the dish but all in all it was yummy. The Manager was very apologetic & tried to be accommodating.

It wasn't overpowering at all and not too sweet, plus  their pancakes are more flavorful and fluffier than their close by competitor's. And again... GUAVA PANCAKES! Get them , like now.

Well on to other matters, the interior decor is almost like a homebody country feel. I'm kind of not a big fan of ordering at the counter and waiting for your food to be delivered to you. I'm more of wanting to sit and look at the menu, then order kind of deal.  So before I even wrote that, the greeter came up to us as we stood in line and explained that there are actually two parts to the restaurant. One side had an express order, where you go up to the counter and order while you wait for your food in the first section & the other corner you have a full service area where a waiter comes and take your order. Kind of confusing, but I guess whatever works, works. 

So after looking at the menu, I have decided on the crab cake egg Benedict with country tots. The full order, which I may add was a little filling. The bf got the omelet special which included lump crab and imitation crab w/ veggies, & for an upgrade got a side of kimchi fried rice. The flavors for both dishes were amazing, both equally delicious and not stingy when it comes to giving crabs. 

After a week, we returned and this time I ordered the kalbi with eggs and kimchi fried rice and the bf got just the regular crab cakes with egg and kimchi fried rice. The flavors for the Kalbi was delicious! And so were the crab cakes, didn't think the kimchi fried rice was all that great that day, seemed like it was missing the kimchi. It became more of spam and soy fried rice to me. 

Not bad of a brunch place, but somehow they seem to be lacking in service. Seems like the people aren't all that happy to be working there, on both occasions I've visited the workers seemed either annoyed or just unpleasant to be working there.

Sorry I didn't get her name she told us about the special of the day I'll make sure  2  try it next visit.  The place is nicely furnished. Menu is simple to make an easy decision on what to have.  I ordered the Portuguese sausage with scrambled eggs and a side salad with cilantro garlic dressing.  My fiancé got the farmer omelette with buttermilk pancakes for a side dish.

I ordered the half order pistachio pancakes with a scoop of ice cream! It was so good! Although it's a very sweet bite I could only eat about half of it. My boyfriend got the omelette order. His bacon was over cooked so we had to ask them to re cook it for us. I think the pancakes was delicious and turned out well but they could work on their other breakfast dish. The omelette was ok to us. The food here will fill you up quick. Big portions.

Was given a menu and was told they were out of Kalbi already, not a good start because I already went thru the menu online and had my taste buds for it. Decided to go with the Hawaiian omelet with the guava chiffon pancakes, not bad and it had a taste of Aloha in it but could have been better. 

Also tried the Red Velvet pancakes, unfortunately it was too dry and almost cake like (not in a good way).

banana pancakes, was better

Kalua pig egg Benedict was really good, but crab Benedict had an odd taste, not sure how to explain, not ""bad"" but not something to talk about for sure. 

Fried rice was probably the best item on the table for sure.

Not having table water is not an option or excuse for any restaurant and you feel a little forced to just buy Hawaiian Sun drinks or $2 bottle water just threw the whole first time experience out the door..

Everything seemed to be an ""add on"" for any substitutions for the already moderately priced menu items. So average entree will cost you $13-$16, which is more than the average really good breakfast chains.

So all these  reviews about it's not as good or service is bad.  NOT ALL EXPERIENCES are the same.  So let's break my experience down.  From the outside it looks like an old location but then  boom! Some pretty lady greets you as soon as you walk in.  She has a flower on one ear and she's super smiley (Like every Hawaiian mom greets her kids).  The place is fancy.   The  front  area looks like it used to be an old deli.  But it's kinda chill and the  design  is so calming.  Out waitress Alyssa is super chill and so nice.  She's attentive and always  checks on us.  Maybe because I looked really hangry from my workout.  She offers us this special with THREE MINI pancake flavors.   Their version of MINI is HUGE!!!! I also ordered the breakfast crabcakes since my father-in-law can't eat too much sodium.  Along with brown  rice.  The pancakes comes out and their AMAZING! They are soft and fluffy but are so sweet except the pistachio which was so so good.  The colors, the flavors was like eating food off a rainbow.  I was seeing yellow moons and pink horseshoes and red balloons!  Anyway, the crabcake was fluffy and filled with spinach.  I was super happy with my choices and didn't even finish the pancakes.  The service here is the bomb.  Even the restrooms are super nice and really is homey here.  I would give it a try  just for the hell of it.  It's far.  But Vegas has  nice highways.  I drove  all the way around from S Rainbow just to come here.  Best part they are close to a TRADER JOES!  I will definitely be back!

Kalbi loco moco with the kimchi fried rice upgrade was great! But the real star here was the pistachio pancakes - which I was lucky to try because my friend ordered them... Definitely will be coming back on my cheat day to grab some more.

The guava chiffon pancakes were ok, but paled in comparison to the flavor and topping of the pistachio pancakes.

The savory portions were just as good. I love that the kalbi is boneless, so you get more meat. I got white rice with mine, which I wish the portion size was better.

I understand this place is known for its savory entrees but im not able to indulge to all the savory stuff since I have gestational diabetes. But, my husband isn't diabetic so he definitely wanted to take part in the guava pancakes. I figured this is a breakfast spot.. they must have a veggie omelet or something simple I can have. Well, yes they did... but they were going to charge me over $15 dollars for a veggie omelet. The menu offers a ""decisions omelet"" which is the only thing I could work with. You choose out of the 3 meats and veggies that you want. Base price, $11.99. I realize that after choosing all the veggies and some bacon... they were going to charge me 1.50 for every item over 3 items. So when I picked my spinach onion and cheese, I had to pay an extra $5 to add a protein, bell peppers and tomato. Seriously? And the guy at the counter had the worst attitude. Did not want to work with me or provide any other options. And lastly the food was going to take 30 minutes to come out? I'd probably give it another shot after my baby comes out but no thanks. No healthy options yet.

So, My first time eating here was good. I ordered Kalbi Loco Moco. My wife had Portugese Sausage & Eggs with a Pancake PLUS a side of rice. 
Once we started eating we were caught off guard. The rice wasn't cooked. I was biting through and spitting out the hard grains. I informed our waiter and he brought us a fresh bowl of rice... Still not cooked. 
I told the waiter again. He didn't offer a different solution. They have Brown Rice and Kimchi Fried Rice but I wasn't offered any of those for the inconvenience. It is what it is. So I just ate the Kalbi and eggs. Same with my wife. The good meats and pancakes made up for the uncooked rice. 
Get this tho, the owner of the restaurant was sitting next to us and was listening to everything we were saying. He gave us a bag of coffee beans. I dont even have a coffee maker. But what a really nice gesture. Thanks Alika! 

2nd visit (4/3/17) 
Me: Kalbi Loco Moco & Blueberry Pancake
Wife: Loco Moco & Pistachio Pancake
And you guessed it, the rice was uncooked again!  Not as bad as before but you can tell there was still pieces of grain that had hard centers. They need a better rice cooker. 
We informed the waitress.

Flavors and textures on point, with no big bones or unwanted chewy parts.  The restaurant is pretty spacious.  Order first, take a number, and find a seat.

$3.25 for  cup of coffee and a SINGLE refill (they actually give you a chip to hand in if you want one).  $10 for guava chiffon pancakes with no breakfast meats and $1.50 for additional syrup?  No fresh fruits.  No vegan options.  No gluten free options.  Seriously, this is Vegas right?

While the norm in Hawaii, the concept doesn't work where off Strip dining is usually 30% less costly.  Neither does ignoring what is common place for breakfast joints in the city.

One plus, the food isn't microwaved like the flagship Kailua location.  

To the food, the guava chiffon pancakes are smaller but at least the syrup (excessively sweet and tasting like boiled out guava nectar from Hawaiian Sun [tm]), is served on the side on request.  Unfortunately, the pancakes don't taste made from scratch, rather made from a mix.  Glutinous, chewy sponges that soak up the syrup.  
 
The bennies (kalua pig and crab cake) are just OK.  The first, salty with a hint of liquid smoke, the latter with more imitation crab and fillers than real crab meat.  The English muffin was soaked in butter substitute and the hollandaise served at room temp.  Don't get me started with the side of skillet potatoes made with tater tots.

The most inventive dish, the boneless kalbi loco moco, was the clear favorite.  It's name is misleading.  It is a kalbi plate lunch.  Well marinated, cooked through kalbi, an inverted bowl of fried rice ($2 extra),with two eggs.  Strange combination of flavors but it kinda works.  Cut everything up, mix it through to compensate for the fried rice being poorly mixed during cooking (white in some areas, lots of soy sauce in others), not bad.  

Service is friendly with a definite Hawaii feel.

Wishing them all the best but for now, missing the mark.  Someone needs to do their homework, check out the competition, and make appropriate changes to better meet the Vegas off Strip dining scene.",oeAhRa8yFa9jtrhaHnOyxQ,32,23,2,tYMW7KWoWVeVJjJwAlW3bw

The music, decor and overall ambience of the place made me feel like I was back home in Hawaii. The staff was friendly and their menu definitely had some originality.

Every single dish was delicious. 

The Phoenix Beef had a nice outer crisp to it, but once you got past the crisp layer, it was soft and tender inside.

My boyfriend also liked that the kalbi was boneless, making it easier to eat. Lastly, the Guava Chiffon Pancakes are some of the best pancakes I've had in a while. It wasn't too sweet or too bland, and they were thick and fluffy.   

I can't forget to mention if you're going to order coffee and like the taste of coconut, ask for the creamer that has coconut in it. It is amazing!

The Guava pancakes weren't really Guava pancakes like we had in Oahu.  It was just regular pancakes with Guava sauce.  The crab cake eggs Benedict were good, but the OG ones were so much better.

On the menu it says you can add onions and mushrooms which means the gravy is not infused with flavor, and that made me sad because the quality was bad.

My GF had the split decisions omelet with double bacon and cheese and for her side she chose the buttermilk pancakes and a Kona coffee.  I decided on the short stack of pistachio cream pancakes and a Kona coffee as well.  For starters the Kona blend coffee is heavenly.  I could drink a whole pot of that coffee it's so good!  My GF's omelet was huge and filled with plenty of bacon and cheese.  Her 2 buttermilk pancakes were also huge and very light and fluffy the way pancakes should be.  She enjoyed her meal but wasn't able to even come close to finishing it because the portions are just gigantic.  My pistachio cream pancakes were also very delicious and full of flavor.

Pistachio Cream Pancakes:
This is like having dessert for breakfast/ brunch. I must say I don't get excited with pancakes and I prefer its cousin, waffles (pancakes with abs). But the pistachio cream was a nice touch to a rather boring breakfast item. 5/5

Crab Cakes:
At first, I thought these were the pistachio Pancakes because crab cakes aren't usually green. They're green because they combine crab and spinach for these cakes. Very tasty and they're not like your basic crabby patties. 5/5

Guava Chiffon Pancakes:
Two of the things that I don't find amusing: guava and Pancakes. Put them in one plate and in my head it's not supposed to taste good but nope! These were awesome! The Pancakes were light and fluffy and the guava syrup was fruity but wasn't too sweet. 5/5

Prime Rib Loco Moco:
Oh, yes, yes, yes! Normally, you get beef patties with eggs, rice and gravy. I got mine with overhard eggs, brown rice and added mushrooms and onions. The prime Rib was tender and delightful. This dish was flavorful without being too salty. It was just right.

House Blend Coffee:
I'm not a Hawaiian coffee connoisseur and I'm not even going to pretend that I am. I'm a fan of Vietnamese coffee and everything else is brown water to me. So, it would be unfair for me to rate this coffee. You get 1 free refill.

What I was most impressed with was the service. They're very attentive and friendly. And everyone seemed to care about their product and their customers. Marty is the manager/ owner and he checked on us multiple times and told us more about Cinnamon's and he was passionate about the food and customer service - and it shows.

Training season is for another 6 months and I'm glad this is a good post-run option for us. We'll be back for sure.",tH0uKD-vNwMoEc3Xk3Cbdg,12,7,5,ioxXC49pPE0GzyQMt4a2ww
5333652,2017-09-20,9,PkqN5st3zZ_Xce_5QlBtNQ,"From time to time, my family and I can get homesick and we get this urge to surround ourselves with places that reminds us of Hawaii. I remember that I had this place bookmarked for 10 months but didn't prioritize to visit. However, my siblings and I finally decided to give this place a go.

E Komo Mai(Welcome)! The Aloha spirit is truly what makes this place really standout. It's great to see another Hawaii transplant set up shop in the 9th island. Explains the location proximity to Trader's Joe, great for many Kama'aina needing to restock on goods after eating. Lol

Everything we had was on point. Especially the Loco Moco, the hamburger steak was on point with seasoning and wasn't dried out. Especially with the option to add mushrooms and onions. This particular dish is very hearty and would recommend to share with others. One of my sister order the Crab Egg Benedict and she was pleased with her order and my other sister got a build your own omelet. They were not greedy with the ingredients because I was able to taste everything. The seasoned country tots, was delicious and went well with the omelet and Benedict. However, the Star of our meal was the Guava Chiffon Pancakes. Fluffy, soft and moist and was paired well with the guava syrup. For those not accustom to Guava flavor, I reccomend to ask for light syrup or have the syrup on the side. Guava, is an aquired taste but its a common flavor in Hawaii. Will diffenitely come back for more Ono(delicious) dishes!

Special shoutout to our server, PONO. Mahalo, for the awesome service Brother! Truly feels like Ohana  (family)!

I stopped in on a Sunday afternoon,  not really knowing what to expect. I walked in to a large open space that was moderately busy as it was after the typical breakfast rush.  I was given a brief overview of the service style,  specials and items that were sold out; it was done in a very welcoming manner.  

The counter service will take some getting used to for me,  but the menu and service more than makes up for this issue of mine.   

I came in specifically for the Guava Chiffon Pancakes,  and the crab-benny caught my eye,  so a 1/2 order of both were in store.  Both were delicious, even though I believe the Eggs Benedict is what will keep me coming back,  also why you should stop in yourself. 

The pricing is on par for the portion size and overall a good value.  Service was solid and friendly and it was great to see the hands on pride of whom I believe to be the owner touching tables and leading by example.  

All in all a solid little spot.  It gets 5 stars from me because for an operation that is less than two months old,  it is clear to me that they are doing something right.  I will be back.",dB_Pb5ZxhBI_xX-RgJ7fgw,0,0,5,xegHRHXWxuuoedT_gNuabw

The cashier said it'll be a 45 minute wait for our food... they weren't kidding. I had to keep reminding myself that the crab cake benedict is work the 45 minutes wait, but boy, was I hungrrrryyyyy. 

My friend received her food first and I was so tempted to start picking off her plate because of how hungry I was (sorry not sorry). The runner seemed a bit confused with what she ordered... She ordered the kalbi loco moco & he said she got kimchi fried rice under the kalbi (she freaked out a little bit). It ended up being just regular rice, like she wanted. I finally got my food and inhaled it. I got the 1/2 order of crab cake benedict -- side note: it's only one half the English muffin & one egg; if you want two English muffin halves & two eggs (like a normal benedict), you have to order the full order. The tater tots that came with the benedict were so crunchy and fresh, I could eat those for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. 

You also have to try the guava pancakes. It's delicious and not too sweet!

The general manager came by every table to make sure the food was okay, which was nice, especially since they just opened. Good customer service, overall. 

I greatly enjoyed the food here, I just wish the wait wasn't so long and this place wasn't on the opposite side of town. A Cinnamon's needs to open on the Southwest side!",7mjpX2eYbcCt1pcNnN3Hrw,5,2,4,Buf31gVS2KDy2I8NbH9ZsA

 Nice little Hawaiian eatery that graced its presence here on the 9th island as the local Hawaiians would call Vegas. The staff is very friendly and have great hospitality. 

 The coffee they brew isn't the crap you find at other breakfast eateries and if you want they do have Kona!

 I always get the same thing when I'm there but that doesn't mean I haven't tried other offerings. I went with my normal Portuguese sausage and eggs with tater tots (yup freakin tater tots!). The food came out at a decent time and I really haven't waited long ever for the food to arrive here so that's a great thing when you have hungry breakfast peeps!

The people here are so friendly and helpful . They give you suggestions and i usually keep it simple with my go to options but today i stepped out of my norm and went with the waiters advice and I was not disappointed! 

I ordered the Hawaiian style sweet bread French toast I did the coconut syrup sauce I couldn't of picked a better combo & spam , sunny side up eggs and soft potatoes. The potatoes were so flavorful . I'm very picky when it comes to my spam I don't like it when the spam is overly crisp or hard these were just right . The eggs I'm usually disappointed everywhere because by the time I get them the their already kinda hard and cold but everything here was served from what it seemed to be right off the stove ! 

My niece ordered the hickory bacon which was delicious I think it lasted two seconds on her plate . This child is by far one of the pickiest people I know and she killed her plate . Her red velvet pancakes were so amazing ! 

We also order kalua pig eggs Benedict which were like heaven in your mouth . Flavorful and moist  .

Last but certainly NOT least the guava pancakes or should I say according to my niece ""clouds your your mouth"" were like something I've never had before . So I never really like pancakes I always get that dry need to be drowned in syrup vibe so i stray away but these .... AMAZING ! Nothing I've ever tried before ! 

I honestly have nothing bad to say about this place ! The waiters were so sweet they were attentive always checking on us . What I liked most was the vibe from this place I'm not sure if it was the owner but the gentleman who approached us during our meal just made us feel so at home! I love small places like this that just open and are so eager to give great service !

But looking around, clearly a favorite breakfast place for the islanders.  We tried one of their specials, the house made corned beef hash and the crab cake benedict.  We also ordered a short stack of the guava chiffon pancakes.  We loved the house made hash, perfectly seasoned and just the right ratio of meat to potato.  The guava chiffon pancakes were super fluffy and not overly sweet even with the syrup and whip cream.  The pancakes and servings are ginormous...I would recommend half orders for those that tend to eat smaller portions.  I also like that they have a bunch of different starch options you can pick from, we were a big fan of their breakfast tots.  The tots were nice and crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside.  I think other options for the starch were toast, rice, brown rice, pancakes, and not a starch but available...salad.  The only reason I knocked off one star is the crab cakes.  I probably would not order the crab cake benedict again, the spinach did not pair well with the rest of the ingredients in the crab cake.

It was mid morning. We just landed at McCarran from LA... I wanted rice. I wanted spam... So I had to get the spam and eggs. One of my favorite island style breakfasts. I t came with a scoop of rice, 3 thick slices of spam and per my request, scrambled eggs. It was perfect. We also shared the famous guava chiffon pancakes (short stack $6.75). It was great. Nice fluffy pancake with a delicious guava pancake sauce. Glad I finally got to try it. I really liked it... Also ordered was the kalua pork eggs benedict. It looked great and came with a side salad. 

Service was attentive and friendly. We had a great brunch at Cinnamon's. I definitely recommend it. It may be a little bit of a drive from the strip but it's totally worth it. Parking is in a shared lot.",5XAXkk6WENi0OW_HSSXRWA,3,2,5,tAFAU-6-MovknKogPi4yBg

Between the table, we tried: 
1. Kalua pig Benedict - my husband had this with country tots. He said it was good, the tots were perfectly cooked and the bread/bun it came on was tasty but overall needed more flavour, probably wouldn't order again.
2. Decisions omelette with a side of Pistachio cream pancakes - I had this and it was great. A huge omelette and you choose three toppings to go in. I upgraded my side to a short stack of specialty pancakes and they were awesome pistachio pancakes with a pistachio cream sauce. They were a favourite on the table, everyone tried it!
3. Teri meatloaf loco moco and Guava chiffon pancakes - Our friends shared these and they said they were great. The meatloaf came over rice with two eggs cooked to order. The pancakes were buttermilk pancakes with a guava sauce that was yogurt-y and sweet. It was good although I think the pistachio was better.
