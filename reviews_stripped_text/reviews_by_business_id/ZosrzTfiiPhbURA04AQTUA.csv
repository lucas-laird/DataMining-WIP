After unsuccessfully searching around Bally's Casino area for a good eatery at 11:00pm, we decided to catch a quick cab to the Pyramid Cafe.  I have visited Pyramid Cafe close to 8 times; it has yet to disappoint.  Sure the waitstaff at midnight are not the most alert, but the food is worth the short wait...and even a long wait if it's crazy busy.  I always get the Magherita Pizza.  It's killer.  ONE time it was odd tasting - I'll chalk that up to a new chef in the kitchen not knowing the secrets of superb pizza.  Okay, maybe ""superb pizza"" is exaggerating it a bit.  Let's put it this way; after drinking all day long and realizing it is midnight and you haven't had anything to eat, this pizza is the BOMB!  It's even good on a sober stomach as well.  The crust has just the right amount of crunch.  The sauce is light and sweet.  The basil strips sprinkled on top really make the pizza.  And the tomatoes are sliced to perfection - nice and thin.  Seriously, I love this pizza.  I was even awesome as leftovers the next morning.
My husband had the steak and eggs.  He's a meat and potatoes kinda guy.  And he was in love with his food while it lasted.  In fact, I got a little jealous.  I was being ignored whilst he was devouring the carnage of the steak and eggs.  Perfectly cooked steak, hashbrowns, and over medium eggs - according to him.  I'll have to take his word on it as I am not a meat and potatoes kinda gal.

My fiancé's eggs were over easy and looked like they were microwaved. Her syrup was watery.

As expected, it turned out to be a big big mistake. What was I thinking ordering Ramen at a cafe. I've had better instant ramen from 7-11. Ramen was topped off with chicken breast, some green onions and carrots. CARROTS! yes CARROTS - It's totally wrong!. Broth tasted like it came from a Campbell can. 

I'm giving it 2 stars because I only sampled the ramen. The SF-Club sandwich was (shrugs shoulder) so-so. Waiters look overworked. Service is veeeeeery slow.

There is usually a short wait line to be seated when I was here. The service response time was a bit slow one time I was visiting, but this is offset by the fact that this café is a far better choice than going to the Luxor Buffet. 

As the wait times for the buffet can be substantially longer, I'm choosing to eat at the café out of convenience. The food is slightly better given that I can chose to have a Fresh Veggie Scramble Omelet, or fresh eggs prepared how I like them. 

Considering the convenience of getting breakfast reasonably quick, for a crew to work at a tradeshow convention (or any outing), consider eating here first before eating at the buffet.",cnVxeco9iKF0et5YZvKrsg,2,1,4,qg6KONb7VLEGdJObbEzocQ

The hotel was awesome and the people there.

I went to have breakfast here with 3 other of my friends. This weekend I had several rooms but only the people in my room came down to get breakfast with me and the others were getting ready to come down as well. I told them not to come after my experience.

I ordered myself a breakfast and asked for white toast to go along with it. The food took a very long time to get there and it wasn't all that busy. When they brought us all our food, I noticed there was no white toast. I asked one of the other servers if my toast was coming out and received a very rude response, she said, ""Did you even ordered it?"" I said yes mam, she rolled her eyes at me and walked away. Then she came back with the toast and literally tossed it on the table. Then as time progressed I asked the server for some extra coffee since we were all out, she came by and just refilled our cups and when I asked for creamer she just tossed them on the table as well. I asked for my check and waited around 10 minutes for it. Then I had my check ready, all my friends walked back to the room as I waited another 15 minutes for them to come get my card so I can pay our breakfast. I paid and walked out very upset. I called from one of the house phones to reach a food and beverage manager and nobody answered. I left a message for them and never received a call back. The front desk manager was very helpful and said she would passdown a message but it didn't seem to do anything. 

This is my first and last time dining here. I literally felt like I was an inconvenience to them. The two staff members seemed as if they didn't even wanna be there that day. This is by far the worst experience I've had at a venue in Las Vegas.",OSAqZZf4d87ll7MtoZV3aQ,1,0,1,-BDUnJQao5ljwhI7TedChQ

I'm staying at the Luxor Hotel this week, attending a conference next door at the Mandalay Bay.  So I need breakfast.  The Pyramid Cafe is the Luxors 24x7 restaurant, located on the ground floor ideally situated so you have to walk through the casino to get to it.  At 6am, I expect the restaurant to be quiet.  However, they conspired to make it busy by opening up only the patio.  As a result, there was a 20 minute wait for a table.  There are no ""grab a pager and go gamble a little more"" - you get to wait in line.  Since it was a patio, the noise of the casino flooded in, making it loud.  You could hold a conversation, but you wouldn't be able to whisper trade secrets (or sweet nothings) here.

The patio has your basic patio furniture for tables around the center and booths around the edges.  No frills - just your basics.  My waitress - Stephanie - was bright and cheery, not pushy, and there when I needed her.  Just what you need at that time in the morning, so five stars for excellent service.

I ordered the coffee, which was tending towards the milder side - no starbucks bitterness here.  This was smooth.  

I also ordered the corn beef hash and eggs - the corned beef was described as ""home-made""... if by home-made, they mean they got it out of a can, then I agree with them.  However, that isn't my definition of home-made.  The corn-beef hash was that very common type with small pearl-sized potatoes.  

The first batch came out cold.  And I mean refrigerator cold.  Not even warm.  So, of course, I sent it back.  I didn't even try the eggs.  Stephanie came back quickly apologetic with a piping hot plate.  The eggs on this plate were also done as I like them, and the hash browns were your typical shredded potatoe variety with nothing to dress them up.

So this was sort of disappointing.  Five star service with One star food, makes it a two-star place in my book.  This is not a place I will be returning to.",WpjLsGe2v9-g_cMdAOOLYA,0,0,2,ijPtcv68QA4d2Bx0hbjYGw

What I love about cafes or diners is that their menus are full of anything that you can eat with the exception that you take shots as if there was an alcohol shortage in the nation & that you danced like a maniac (literally like a maniac) on the floor...it's not only a song, it's a dance of redemption 

And what's more perfect in Las Vegas than a café located on the heart of the main casino just a couple floors down from your room

I've got to give cool points to our waiter at the Pyramid café because like everyone in our table he was also super annoyed at the drama queen next to our table, voiced his opinions about it to us & gave us our awesome meals on time to end the night/early morning. I would've hugged him if he brought out a frozen t-bone & slapped Queen drama next door. Just kidding...I'm not violent but pretty imaginative though  not in that ""Saw"" movie kind of way

The only thing is that the lines were way too long which is great because that means that people loved the food served here but I saw a couple of empty tables on the side while we were waiting. Tipsy, hungry & TIRED are the worse combination and that's nuff said while breaking into new 5 inch heels especially when you see empty tables set up & ready.

Overall, this was the place to find comfort food such as my delicious Vegetarian omelet, a huge mix of fresh spinach, tomatoes & mushrooms with fluffy white & yellow eggs, wheat toast, side of fresh fruit & the sweetest yet strong coffee. Yum!

Located on the casino level of the Luxor, the menu offers breakfast, lunch, and dinner fares, for which I'm sure most will find something to their liking.  Although not extensive, the menu does have appetizers, sandwiches, salads, and desserts as well.

On this most recent visit, my cousins and I were looking more for snack versus an actual meal.  Altogether we ordered the classic caesar salad, quesadillas, onion rings, and buffalo hot wings.

She also provided drink refills in a timely manner and checked up on us frequently to see how we were doing.

Bottom Line:  As a guest of the Luxor, I would recommend the convenience of the Pyramid Cafe.",HaoPeg2ySVEbQKN3gySxHQ,3,3,4,-mIbi0p7o0W6lC-6DOqnZg

My French Onion Soup was basically salt in a bowl! It had very minimal broth and itwas mostly bread with a thick layer of mozzarella cheese. I was very thirsty after I had some of it. This is the worst french onion soup I have had...

The Fruit Platter for $9.99 was not worth it! A 10 dollar fruit platter came with 2 strawberries, 2 blackberries, 2 orange slices, 1 pineapple slice, 2 cantaloupe slices, and 2 honeydew slices. It was a sad looking plate of fruit.

I ordered a side of turkey sausage and was given a small plate of 4 dinky little sausages. I chose turkey sausage as a healthier alternative, but I didn't know that would include giving me a smaller portion than the pork sausages come as.

The service was great and so was the food! 

The menu is simple and reasonably priced considering its on the strip. It's not like Downtown though, where you can find excellent deals for cheap... 

We stayed at the Delano next door but made our way to the Luxor and we were glad we did. There are more dining options at Luxor and are more value priced compared to Delano or Mandalay Bay.

While walking around on our last day, a friend and I dropped in here for a late lunch at about 2pm. Just cause we wanted to eat some where relaxing and quiet. We got seated in a waiter's section that I guess was almost ready to leave and we were his last table.  When he finally came to take our order, it was the last we saw of him.  I had a coffee and a hamburger with onion rings.  After 15 minutes, our waiter had morphed into a waitress from another section who said our meals were coming right up as she ran by.  My coffee was empty so when she ran by, I asked for more and she yelled to another guy to come fill it.  He did...with coffee that was between luke warm and warm. After about 25 minutes after ordering our new waitress showed up with the food, slapped the plates down and took off before I could ask for mustard.  When I finally got the hostess' attention and asked for it, she delivered it to the the table next to us where they were just getting up to leave.

My onion rings were soggy and greasy. The onion and the lettuce on the burger was dried out as was the pickle on the plate. All was set aside on my plate never to be touched.  The hamburger itself was ok tasting and my friends NY steak and eggs was good too.  My coffee cost more than I pay for at Starbucks for a grande cafe mocha.

We only saw our waitress one more time after that and it was a drive by to tell us everything was ok instead of asking us if everything was ok.  Yeah...Our tip reflected the service we got.

I know there are plenty of good places to eat after hours in Las Vegas, but I decided to dine here after watching Carrot Top's show simply because I was too lazy to go find something better.  The 24 hour Pyramid Café located on the casino floor of the Luxor was quite the popular spot when I was there as there was a constant line of patrons waiting to be seated.

I liken the restaurant to a Denny's based on its menu.  They serve items such as all-day breakfasts, salads, burgers and sandwiches and a few main dishes.  The prices are very reasonable.  The staff is all pretty friendly even though I noticed quite a few of the buspersons lagging in their step and just standing around and doing nothing while there were multiple tables to be cleaned off and countless patrons waiting for a spot to sit down.

After a ten minute wait I was seated.  I'm not complaining, but they sat me (dining solo) in a table for four while tables for two were available forcing groups of three or four to continue to wait for a table.  The whole seating arrangement just seemed way out of whack.  I got a nice waitress though who constantly smiled and checked up on me multiple times.

I ordered the New York Steak dinner and asked that it be cooked medium.  The dinner is served with fresh seasonal vegetables which turned out to be steamed carrots and broccoli and a choice of potato.  I chose mashed potatoes and made the mistake of saying yes to gravy.  The wait for the food was about as prolonged as the seating process.  In the meantime I was brought a basket with two warm garlic rolls and four pats of butter served cold and hard.  The bread (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ZosrzTfiiPhbURA04AQTUA?select=Ji_LeplLxwpK_0wCAN9n6g) was flavorful, but it was not fresh as the center was kind of firm instead of being soft.

My steak dinner (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ZosrzTfiiPhbURA04AQTUA?select=xVshpLhrKF23IUVFmNqt2g) didn't fare any better.  The meat was unevenly cooked as half of the steak was served medium-well and the other half was well-done.  I hate well-done steaks!  I wouldn't have minded had the entire steak was medium-well since that part remained tender and juicy.  Trying to cut into the well-done meat with only a semi-sharp steak knife proved to be a task as the entire table shook.  The huge serving of mashed potatoes (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ZosrzTfiiPhbURA04AQTUA?select=bOshUN8Fs5iGod0KBTGG1Q) might have been okay had it not been drowned in the super salty brown gravy.

I ordered the 3 Egg Denver Omelet and my BF ordered the following: their bacon, eggs, and rice (he wanted asian style sticky rice, but they only serve a rice pilaf); short stack, a side order of toast, and an extra side of bacon. I don't know who would want to stay up after eating all that! 

The food was good and that 3 egg omelet was too much - 2 eggs would've been good! My BF really enjoyed his meal(s), but I don't think he ate all of it...

There aren't really walls, so it does give you a view of weary, ragged-around-the-edges folks mindlessly working the slots at 3 am.

There's a fairly broad menu ranging from burgers to 24 hour breakfast. Out of sheer convenience, I ate here twice; once a breakfast type meal and the other dinner. Although different foods, the experience was similar.

Both times service was pretty slow, even when the place was only partly full and the number of patrons barely outnumbered the servers. Breakfast came with a nice helping of ham but runny eggs and wilted hash browns. A burger for dinner was okay; I rather liked the fries that came with it, but it was a pretty small helping. Prices had the expected resort markup.

I give two stars here, not that it's a particularly bad place, but it just seems to do everything a little below average. There's nothing egregious here and I'd eat here again in the right circumstances, but everything is sort of a C-/D+ level.

But, decided to give their cafe a shot with a friend after checking out their menu. They offer plenty of standard breakfast and lunch fare, but the standout dishes reside in their diverse selection of French toast. They don't just add different toppings to the same bread. They utilize different types to create the best profile.

Despite the lack of carrots in the carrot cake French toast, the bread was soaked through with custard and topped with garnishes that added a nice variety of tastes and textures to make it a standout dish. Likewise, the strawberry shortcake French toast was an enticing array of flavors highlighted by the strawberry compote. Lighter, overall, than the carrot cake, it was equally as good.

Less successful were red velvet pancakes that had a tough, almost rubbery texture and icing that was thick and grainy. However, the hints of caramel were a nice touch. Their monte cristo was a solid rendition with an exterior providing plenty of crunch. It could have benefited from more ham, but the flavors were still decent.

With a menu full of items that are more likely to satisfy than impress, it's the specialty items like the French toast that should be ordered for a memorable meal.

Service wasn't very friendly. The lady who took our order had a pretty much ""Whaddya want"" type attitude. The intonation in her voice when she check on us made me afraid to ask for a refill on my drink.

The line was long, but my aunt, mother, and father were already waiting at our table. My brother and I arrived about 11, but my sister and her fiance were late! COME ON SISSY!!!

Anyway, the service was horrendous. Lizzy came with water and I had arrived with coffee in my cup which was nice (since my mom knew I'd have some). Had to ask for refills of water and coffee.

We had a huge order and I got the angus steak, eggs, and cottage cheese. I was supposed to get rye bread (didn't) and fruit (being healthy) gets an upcharge/can't be subbed. Why, why Las Vegas do you fault me for wanting more fiber, less simple sugar, and more nutrients? I don't get you!

  We were originally going to eat upstairs in Nathan's. Due to the food court refurbishment in progress, Nathan's is temporary closed. Up for a convenient meal that was not going to cost a fortune, we tried the Pyramid Cafe.
  I expected mediocre food with sketchy service. On the contrary, the Pyramid Cafe classic cheeseburger was thick and juicy. The fries were tasty. The waitress was on top of beverage refills. 
  Although the Pyramid Cafe exceeded my expectations, I am still not a fan. A major reason is that I could get better value at off strip casino cafes. Or Denny's. I did not see salad or soup offered with the entres. For a Strip casino cafe, the prices are not outrageous. It is my understanding that the Pyramid Cafe is the least expensive casino cafe on the South Strip [south of Paris]. Fries are included in the price of the sandwich.

1)  The line is so so long even though more than half the tables were completely open.  They just refused to sit us.
2)  The service is TERRIBLE.  When I asked for waters the waitress rolled her eyes at me and disappeared for ten minutes.
3)  Poached eggs came in a small dish on the side, swimming in water.  While blotting the eggs on a napkin, my yolk broke.  That just sucks.
4)  We ordered turkey sausage and they brought greasy pork sausage.  When I pointed that out, the waitress told me we were wrong and that it was obviously turkey.  No. Pork.
5)  Underseasoned and bland hash browns.  

What's good:

1)  Uhm... bacon.  Bacon is always good.

4753468,2012-09-14,1,ZosrzTfiiPhbURA04AQTUA,"Since the Excalibur decided that having a cafe for breakfast was not a good idea we ventured into the Luxor and came across the Pyramid Cafe. Unfortunately they close after lunch time so they are not a 24 hour operation which is most unfortunate because the food they offer would be perfect for late night eats. No matter I guess at least they offered early morning breakfast. I forget the name of the dish I ordered but it was a basic breakfast of eggs, sausage, hashbrowns, and toast. The eggs and sausage were good but the hasbrowns and toast left something to be desired. I liked the decor of the place. The Luxor does a phenomenal job of staying true to their theme. The prices are typical Vegas, which is you pay more than you usually would for something, so I have different price expectations for them. My breakfast was around $9 and for Vegas that is pretty typical so it does not bother me. I expect t spend more money to dine out on vacation then I would at home especially at restaurants in Vegas casinos. There are cheaper dining options on the strip like a Dennys or Cocos so if I did not like these prices I could go elsewhere so I don't feel like I have the right to complain too much about that. The food here was nothing special but it was not disgusting either. Our waitress MaryEllen was a sweetheart and she had great customer service. She made sure we had everything we needed at all times. I ordered a milk and she forgot to bring it out to me and when I reminded her she was very apologetic and made up for it. To her defense the place was packed and she was working alot of tables. The food took a little long to come out but it was very busy that morning.  Overall the place is just basic. Nothing remarkable.

I remember telling my boyfriend that I was staying at a pyramid-shaped hotel and had breakfast at the Pyramid Cafe. He asked whether there were traditional Egyptian beans served at breakfast. As much as I would have loved an authentic Egyptian breakfast, this cafe is a cheaper alternative to eating at the buffet, especially for breakfast.

My friend and I headed over to this cafe for breakfast. It was busy, but there were plenty of tables for us when we got there.

I love corned beef hash. I got it with hashbrowns and scrambled eggs.

The food was hot and good. I am not crazy about crispy hashbrowns to the point where they can injure you if you threw them at someone. I'm not saying that you would, but they were too hard for my liking. 

Service was fine for how busy it gets. If you are in a rush, it's probably not the place for you. Otherwise, come here for a typical North American breakfast.

It is bright, spacious and clean, which is always a nice start to a meal. The menu has something for everyone I'm pretty sure; the service is quick, and the prices are reasonable. My choice: a simple soup and salad combo. The salad was mixed greens with basic vegetables, and the blue cheese dressing was just right. The tomato soup wasn't mind-blowing. It was a close relative to Campbell's. Nothing to be ashamed about. The only thing I truly missed was a basket of warm bread.

Located in Luxor, a casino I've not visited since establishing residence in Las Vegas, Pyramid Café was one of those All-Hours diners that I knew I'd eventually visit and with a friend and fellow blogger happy to meet up for an early breakfast the opportunity finally presented, a long walk through the parking lot and a short one through the casino landing us a table overlooking the expansive gaming floor where a craps table was already getting rowdy...or perhaps still rowdy from the night before.  Sprawling in size and comfortably spaced with a menu chock-a-block full of clever twists on breakfast favorites both sweet and savory it was to the pleasant service of a woman named Debbie that we were greeted and with the meal divided into two courses comprised of five items, including one from the mid-day menu, plus copious refills of coffee rarely would any part of the experience falter - a ninety minute visit tallying $65 all-in for one of the Strip's more innovative breakfasts.  Starting slightly savory before progressing to things far sweeter it was with the duo of three thin Red Velvet pancakes gussied up by tangy cream cheese icing and a custardy masterpiece of a Monte Cristo with fresh strawberry preserves that the meal began and although biscuits and hash browns proved somewhat uninspired as optional sides portions of each proved ample for the price.  Opting next to explore the section entitled ""French Toast and Waffles"" with a pair of the former the plates that arrived would prove even more impressive than round one; both ""breads"" actually sliced cakes dipped in custard and griddled golden, the carrot lacking much vegetable but rich with spice while the tangy poppy seed version served as base to the unbridled flavor of fresh strawberries in a dessert-come-breakfast take on a summertime favorite that should not be missed.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,1,1,4,B27F8VFYIzJVfZrlRoYgRA

So lets say you are staying at the Luxor (Check) You don't feel like walking or waiting in the taxi line to go to another hotel (Check) and you want a decent breakfast but not fast food (Check). Come to Pyramid Café! Yes they are going to be overpriced for the meal you get (Duh) that's expected on the strip. But their food is actually pretty decent, which honestly surprised me. I ate here twice. I had the breakfast skillet ($12.99) with a side of pancakes ($8.99 ish) one morning. I can live without the pancakes *Blah* but the skillet was pretty darn good. I would eat it again. The next time I came I had the Country Benedict ($12.99) which was good as well. I would rate the food 4 stars. Service...ummm...although the servers were super nice, they were slow to take the order, and slow to bring the check. Yes both times they were super busy, buuuuuut, they were not on top of their game. I've been to several places that are busy ALL the time and in comparison the speed of the service at Pyramid Café wasn't the best. Period. But overall 3 stars for this Café. If I stay at the Luxor again I'll definitely will be eating here again.

Note- They only serve breakfast & lunch. They serve breakfast until closing (1pm) and serve lunch from 11am-1pm.

We ate here because we were staying at the Luxor and were too lazy to drive anywhere else. It was sort of last minute at 9pm so we settled. Even at 9pm the place was busy and we had to wait for a table.

When we sat down it took a while for a server to get to us. Everyone working there looked harried, stressed and overworked. When we finally got served our server was very nice and did the best she could to get around to us. Ironically there were several men standing around who looked like managers who werent doing much at all to assist the staff even though they clearly needed it. Also, I saw a server loudly complaining about a customer to the manager within earshot and sight of the entire dining area. This is such a pet peeve of mine.

The food was just ok. We ordered a Cobb salad and salmon burger. The Cobb salad was pretty boring and predictable. The salmon burger was alright, maybe slightly undercooked, pretty small and not terribly interested. 

If I had to do it all over again I would make the extra effort to find another place to eat. Our total bill came to around $28 which certainly wasnt worth what we ate.",A_dC3FJOqvlsDEiDyMrzlA,0,0,2,-hvTF-T2Y3pe0BO7RROu8Q

Walking in seems like an ordinary dine-in restaurant (in a hotel), yet in VEGAS everything is most of the time known to be: outrageous, CrAzY expensive and extremely packed with decor. Well... not here, just waiting in line you notice a lot of different verities of cakes in a Look-See Glass from both ways.

So, as we were seated (waiting around 5-10 minutes at max) GREAT TIMING... I was browsing the menu, which I came upon a unique omelet Ive never seen else were. CHILI CHEESE OMELET for BREAKFAST?!? Yup, as crazy as I may seem (EARLY IN THE MORNING) I choose that as a start off of a GREAT DAY AHEAD OF ME. Honestly, I could have counted to 200 and been notified that my food was ready.

Eating my CHILI CHEESE OMELET... it was FANTASTIC! It was made of egg (your normal egg omelet) which had green peppers inside and full of chili. DELICIOUS!

I highly recommend everyone to stop by and ask for the Chili Cheese Omelet early in the morning.

Is the ""press"" in the kitchen on the fritz or the executive chef doesn't know that most people expect a grilled Panini when that word (we're not in Italy) is used.

The menu has a nice amount of selections, and a great alternative to the buffet.",ZIOCmdFaMIF56FR-nWr_2A,1,1,3,tOIRu_Hd5fQ9Tufb7MdS7w

Asked for my steak rare and it came out that way! My hubby asked if he could have a ham steak instead and they grilled it deliciously! We ate here every day.",4sxsIudqZy7-pm1oO1EtHg,0,0,4,WHyKF2s_EZbbNapVM3GS3g

The bill came to 38.00, so I said "" lets take a piece of cake to go, since its basically free with the coupon.  I asked for one kind of cake, I ended up with a totally different kind.  It took about 20 min to get the cake.  Ridiculous.  The food was decent though, my partner and I shared a salad( overpriced at 7,00) and a chicken pot pie( huge and a decent deal at 12.99).  The pie was loaded with chunks of white chicken in a creamy sauce.  Pastry was good.  The corn muffin it came with was so freaking dry.  I asked for some bread instead.  My partners dad had a club and it was large with plenty of fries.  He enjoyed that.  

Oh, I wanted to take something ""to go"" from here.  I called while I was in my room and was told I'd have to wait on line to be seated and then order from a waitress and then I could take it to go.  Whats the point in that?",FVeD1j9SeczVz-jZyPxBJg,0,0,2,p8uuVLrriboWWfcSaBxNpQ

I had pancakes and eggs with sausage and my wife had yummy chicken and waffles. 

The waitresses were so friendly and nice. Cute older ladies. And they kept our cups full of juice and coffee.

Over all it was a wonderful, cozy, warm restaurant for breakfast or lunch.",kTshOfu5Yf2gyiuefLRErw,3,1,5,bXgbn_qFHNkge5APPQGl_g
