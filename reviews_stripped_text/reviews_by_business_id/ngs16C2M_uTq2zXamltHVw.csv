They gave me, literally, 5 waffle fries approx 2 inches in diameter.  I wouldn't even mention this if they put them on the plate gratuitously But,
they charged me $2.50 . That works out to 50 cents for each tiny piece of potato. COME ON
that is not reasonable.  If you order fries, ask for a generous portion for $2.50.

My love of barbecue was unleashed in Austin, Texas. I can't get there as often as I'd like, so I must search for meaty goodness near home. I don't like chains so for a long time the valley was lacking in options. 

Thankfully, times have changed and the valley is now home to some pretty great barbecue. While some are growing by leaps and bounds, others are just getting their start like Jessie Rae's BBQ. They are a small operation putting love into everything they do. Open for lunch Monday thru Friday, plus an occasional Saturday. 

Just minutes from the strip on Valley View, you'll be greeted with a waft of smoke that fills the air when you pull up to the quaint building that is home to Jessie Rae's BBQ. A friendly ""hello"" welcomes you at the door, the menu is simple but offers variety. If you're lucky, the owner Mike will suggest daily specials. You'll find the best selection if you go early. When they run out, that's it for the day. It's also worth a mention that all sauces are made in house. Prices are not cheap, but real barbecue never is. 

The dining room is tiny so they have a steady stream of carry-out business. My brother and I were fortunate to find a seat. It took only a few short minutes before Mike brought out our grub. My combo was Pulled Pork and sliced Brisket ($14). He opted for the Double Brisket sandwich for ($12). Both had the choice of one side, we each chose the Mac N Cheese. The combo offered a hearty portion of meat, more than I could finish. Both meats were very good. I don't know that I could choose one over the other. Which is going to make the choice difficult on future visits. The brisket was extremely tender, it had a nice smoke ring and it was loaded with flavor. It was great on its own and even better with God's sauce or Fallen Angel for a more fiery bite. The Pig Sweat was the third sauce option, and I know it is customary for pulled pork, but it's too vinegary for my liking. My brother enjoyed his sandwich too; tender brisket with the extra benefit of bold and flavorful burnt ends. The bun was fresh and it was dense enough to support the weight of the meat - which can be a feat in itself. Good eatin' for sure.

Everything was delicious, I mean everything. Usually when I go to BBQ restaurants there's always a food item that I wouldn't order again. But here, I would order everything again. The ribs were smoky and fell off the bone, the pulled pork was extremely juicy, and the brisket was cut thick. The different BBQ sauces they had were a perfect addition to the meats. My boyfriend ate the whole pulled pork sandwich without giving me a bite so in guessing it was amazing too. They even have grape Kool-Aid, sweet tea, and strawberry lemonade.

One sandwich that cost roughly 15 bucks, ($3 more because I made it a combo) was the size of a Mc Double with hard and dry pulled pork and very oddly flavored brisket. The Signature sandwich ""The Jesse Rae"" sounded fantastic, yet it did not have the cheese and the pork was like jerky there was no moisture besides the slaw. This was also upgraded to a combo for $3 more which was to include 1 side and drink. We got both of the sides, corn was ok, the mac and cheese tasted like boxed, but the drinks did not make the journey. Elements of this meal were good, the sausage was great and the slaw was cool and flavored well. When all was said and done I paid $46 ($60 after delivery, taxes and tip) for 3 sandwiches and 2 sides. The driver was kind and polite and the food got here very quickly, but the meal was a dud and there was no napkins, no utensils and no condiments. All in all, would not recommend.

To their credit I only heard about the place because the owner posted a comment on a news story and referenced their restaurant. I did a little yelp research and showed up the next day. They don't attempt to be any other style of BBQ so they get a pass on the flavor and execution.

I'm a fan of pulled pork sandwiches and expect them to be a little pricey and this one did not disappoint clocking in at $11, as of this review. No sides or drink. (Hey you have to support small businesses and good BBQ is not cheap.) So the sandwich arrives and it's a handful and a mouthful- for better or worse. It's a good value, but man when you want pulled pork you don't expect huge chunks of pork to fall out of the sandwich. Everything on the sandwich was just big- chunks of coleslaw, walnut-sized chunks of pork and the bun was big too. I digress as this is ""Vegas"" style BBQ.

Could the pork use a little more flavor? Yes and it could also use a little more char. Can the sandwich be priced a little better? Absolutely! For comparison a two item combo is $14 and that comes with a side! Make the sandwich smaller by using a smaller bun. The bun was good quality, but in Vegas it'd come with a $16 burger. 

Would I go back? Sure. Jessie Rae's BBQ has character, the customer service is awesome and the menu has some exciting twists. But, the flavors need to be kicked up a little, fill the empty sauce bottles and price the sandwiches a little more aggressively and we'd have a winner. .",4vj_0BQeXjCyNB7ESS5mGg,1,0,3,Kh37mAQVtEXiuRNhooczCA

The bread with a special name is not that special either. 

The slaw is a nothing-special-no-twist to it slaw named ""Vegas slaw"" for marketing I'm guessing. 

The Hot links are not hot and taste like they are from a pretty low quality source. 

The Beans...are these beans from a can? 
I swear I know this taste.  Not even a dollop of your own sauce to make it unique? Hrumph.

The 2oz sauce is less than the 1.5 oz the container is labeled as. As they are only filled half way (if you considering to order take out .50 cent for 2 oz that's not even 1oz is a joke) it's not the money but it also is as it's a sad little rip off of what's advertised and what I'm receiving are two completely different things.

I call to to inform them of what I even called ""silly complaints"" but worthy of notification, to someone who couldn't care less about a customers complaint ""over the Phone"". She actually wanted me to call the delivery service to file these specific complaints. I'm ninety-nine percent sure the delivery service has nothing to do with the quality of the meal.

This place, 
If they have to save money by using poor quality products and misadvertising sizes while also overpricing their items and not making them special in any way.  If they couldn't care less about customer complaints that was actual real feedback and out just a pointless hissy fit, they don't need my business or yours. 

If the reviews don't turn you away 
you'll only need to try them once

Absolutely divine barbecue! Having lived in Lexington, KY and a Savannah, GA, I know my way around great barbecue, and the folks at Jessie Rae's are right there at the top!

This is easily **The Most Tender Brisket** I have EVER tasted!

But the real treat is the ""What-The-Hell-Is-This"" deliciousness of the Maniac Fries: an ""American Picnic Nachos"", if you will, of waffle fries, Mac-n-Cheese, hot links, and your choice of an additional barbecue meat. We chose to add the pork, which was great, but next time we will use the brisket.

Although the barbecue stands on its own, be sure to treat yourself to some of the ""Slammin' Bamma"" white (yes, I said white!) barbecue sauce! It's indescribably fantastic.... Amazing flavor!

Jessie Rae's is now in my normal rotation of restaurants to visit, and without a doubt on the ""must have for lunch"" list when friends and family come to town. 

Bonus points for being a restaurant that supports national veterans charities and local firefighters. 

Second bonus: this is a great place to hit for lunch before or after going guns & ammo shopping at Ventura Firearms, which is one block to the south.",twqa9TuTqtB3KAPLdpanuA,0,0,5,oKqMyOeup_r636To1QPMNQ

Everything was delicious and the service was amazing! This is a family owned business the mom of the owner was worker and was the sweetest person in the world. She let us mix our bbq sauces to see what we enjoyed the most. I like the spicy one with the vinegar based one. 

My side was mac and cheese and you want to talk about cheesy and gooey this is the place. there was no place for plain noodle there. Every bite was heaven and I couldn't stop eating it. My girlfriend got waffle fries and they had buffalo and ranch on them which was delicious. 

Great news is that they deliver since they are about 20 minutes but I would want the whole experience. Next time I want to try the corn bread because we didn't get to and on Thursday they have beef ribs. (16.00 a rib) but I heard it is worth every bite and dollar.

BBQ - The spareribs are my favorite!  From the top layer of the slightly charred crust, down-to-the-bone delicious! Hands down better than the other bbq places in the area! Good ratio of fat and juicy lean meat.  I mentioned to Jessie B. how the meats had fruity smoked notes to it. She pointed out to the chalkboard menu on the wall that said peach woods were used. Mike the owner mentioned also the batch was done up North Carolina style. 

I had mention it was Chad S. review and photos that motivated me even more to check Jessie Rae's out when Mike asked me how I heard about the place. Later he passed out slices of smoked Filet Mignon to all dining in. That was the special smoked meat that day. I wasn't expecting it to be so tender. Really impressed. So if you see it on the menu, get it, you won't regret it! 

SIDES - I got the corn with smoked garlic butter. That's nice twist to serve corn. I'm sticking to getting that again too.

AMBIENCE: Yes the place is rinky dinky, but so was the other bbq joint when they first started out, so not gonna fault them for it.  Just heads up though be prepared to take your meal to go if you don't get there first thing when they open.  The closer to peak lunch hour, it got pretty busy. I got there maybe a little too early though just as Mike was setting up, who by the way is the bbq pitmaster extraordinaire and owner, along with his wife. Plus points for being a local family owned operation. 

LOCATION: Not that hard to find. Signage is visible from Valley View and easy parking in front. 

Price - in line with all bbq places I've been to. There are also  some incentives when you check in on Yelp now, I read.  On my visit here, there was only a $12/15 voucher that I took advantage of.

Even with the limited seating, it wont deter us coming here. I already decided that Jessie Rae's is our first choice for bbq when in Vegas area!",2EuPAGalYnP7eSxPgFCNDg,10,8,5,JIlY0zrUjFmgIXoA6HgWXQ

Grabbed takeout at 11:30AM on a weekday, and the food was disappointing. Maybe we came on an off day, but it was hard to find anything to like, though we were unable to try the ribs, which sound like their best meat option.

SERVICE:  An hour after opening, they were out of ribs. When my boyfriend  expressed surprise, she said ""this happens every day."" Uh, basic supply and demand would then suggest you make more. W e'd planned to split a three meat plate. Now, with only brisket and chicken left, we'd have to double up on one. To do so, we were charged an extra $7 for the double brisket. This is ridiculous, and we were put in the position to do so by the lack of other available meats. Takeout box was put  on the counter, had to get bags and utensils separately. If the majority of your orders are for takeout, perhaps someone should be bagging up orders appropriately.  Just a thought.

THE FOOD
BRISKET: My initial thoughts were complimentary. But as we got away from the edges of the piece of meat and into the interior, the meat became dry and unappealing. The brisket was the best of what we tried, but we didn't finish it.
CHICKEN: It was fall off the bone tender, but lacked flavor and was also on the dry side. This went unfinished as well.
MAC AND CHEESE: I found it interesting, and kind of fun, that they used bowtie pasta for the mac. But it was falling apart and the only flavor seemed to be from the seasoing sprinkled on top. The first few bites were fine, but again, as we got more into the dish and the noodles broke into pieces and the seasoning was gone, flavor was very one note. I do like that they were nicely saucy (dry mac is the worst offense!), but this version was lacking.
SAUCES: Okay, even average bbq can be made to shine with a good sauce. BF grabbed two different types for us to try and both were gross. One was sickeningly sweet with a chemical-like after taste we couldn't place, while the other (the Godfather?) was similarly sweet but with a punch of pepper. This wasn't balanced, it was just pepper. No bueno!

Great variety of BBQ sauces. Each one very different and very distinct. Good amount of food for the price? Not so much. But hey, it's a tiny little house made BBQ joint, so that's to be expected. I was in there when a construction worker ordered his lunch...$18! Ouch! 
We ordered the pork'd in Vegas sandwich & the Jessie Rae. Pork'd in Vegas is the clear star. Hearty, balanced. Everything you want in a BBQ sandwich. The Jessie Rae is served on sandwich style bread, very light, very airy. It had potato chips in it along with other unnecessary ingredients. I didn't think this sandwich was filling or balanced. 

But the real reason why I could only give two stars....the flies. The amount of flies flying inside and landing on us as we were eating was one of the most unpleasant dining experiences ever. Even if it was the absolute best food I've ever had...even if the entire world proclaimed this place as the holy grail of BBQ, I couldn't return or even order to go...if there were that many flies in the dining room, one could only imagine what was going on in the kitchen.

I wish the drink selection included something besides a 5 option soda fountain and water from said soda fountain (maybe some brewed tea and lemonade since it's a BBQ joint), and who doesn't love something sweet after all that savory meat (I'm thinking banana & nilla wafer pudding).

Ever since they opened their doors they have been instantly getting raving reviews. Then one day my co-worker went there for lunch and she was hook. I got to try a piece of her brisket and burnt end that day and I too was hook ans was craving for more. I am a bit surprise it took me so long to try them out but I eventually did and I was very happy camper.

Pulling up into to the restaurant in an industrial office area where most cafes and food joint like this caters to surrounding business you don't expect much and as you walk in there's not a whole lot...just a couple of tables and chairs no fuss no muss just the essentials and straight to the point BBQ. 

A guy name James took my order over the phone being super helpful and suggestive, as well as everyone there. I placed an order for 2 sandwiches with one being free because of a handy dandy coupon I had. After checking in on Yelp I also was suppose to receive a free a small kool-aid but they were out so I got a full bottle of soda instead, ""sweet I scored thanks Jessie's BBQ"". The amazing smell of BBQ when you walk in makes your stomach growl and your mouth water. I couldn't wait to dig in.

The Jessie's sandwich was full of juicy pull pork and amazing slaw and I hate slaw but their's was so good. The sauce was freaking awesome and even though I didn't get potato chips on my sandwich like I was suppose to it was still bomb. The Brisket sand was killer, of coarse it was because of the brisket, the Mac a cheese was cheesy and deliciousness. The sausage though tasted a little like store bought sausage when the the menu made it sound like it made made in house and amazing. I'm not sure if it is made in house or store bought but I really didn't care for it and. Any how all of that was sandwiched between two amazing buttery buns with softest warmest and not over kill with the dough. 

Each sandwich costs around $11-$14 bucks with no sides or soda but for about $3 or so more you can make it a combo. A little too much for an everyday lunch for me but it was worth it and that's BBQ price for you.

The food was delivered on time and the person that delivered it ""I believe he was the other owner"" was awesome he was very helpful getting all the food setup and answered all of our questions as we were hung over and drooling ready to eat.  

We had 55 guest to entertain and they all were blow away about the bbq. If I could write 55 reviews for each person that attended they would all give Jessie Rae's 5 stars with great comment.

After browsing the menu for a bit, I called in an order for pickup. I  spoke with James who was very pleasant. He took my order and told me it would be 10-15 minutes. Jessie Rae's is approximately 2.6 miles from work, so I jumped in my car on my lunch break on 2/15/16 and headed over. If you have any kind of navigation device on your phone it will lead you right to the place. Yes, it's small and the location is in a commercial complex, but there is visible signage from Valley View. Matter of fact it's right off Valley View and Dewey.  ANyway I ordered a 2 meat combo, and went with the sausage and brisket. The combo comes with one side and I choose slaw, but opted to get an additional side of mac and cheese. 

The Good
-Customer service was great. As I said James was very pleasant both over the phone and in person when I picked up my order. He hand delivered the food to me and showed me the food before closing up the box. You can tell he takes pride in what he does.
-The pig sweat bbq sauce was amazing. It's a vinegar based sauce which happens to be my fav, and it was fucking delicious. It was so good that  I drank it out of the little cup (don't judge me).
-The sausage was really good. It was chopped up into bite size pieces, perfect for popping into my mouth. It was a bit well done but that is actually how I prefer it. It had just the right amount of spice and a lot of flavor. I would order this again.
The slaw-oh em gee this shit was amazing. It was tangy and creamy and the cabbage was fresh and had a nice crunch to it. I would order this again.
-The price was super reasonable. I ordered a 2 meat combo and 2 sides for around $17.50. 

The Bad
-The mac and cheese was not good. Although it looked tasty, it tasted like when you were younger and your mom would make you eat reheated Kraft mac and cheese the next day. It was very dry and had a lot of pepper mixed throughout. I can't see myself ordering this again.
-The brisket. Contrary to other reviews this brisket was not dry at all, in fact it was very tender and had good smoky flavor. While it was tasty, it was very fatty. You will have to see my pic to understand what I mean. I would think twice about ordering this again. 

All in all though I think this place is pretty good. I love supporting local businesses and there are a few things I want to try out like the ribs and pulled pork. I will for sure be back.",JYcCYNWs8Ul6ewG5kCYW4Q,11,9,4,vZMnw6oB9NXceFzbcZentg

Came here on a Tuesday night, after hours. This other really cool Sarah got the owner Mike to open up for a Meet Up group of about 14, so we had a catered style event.

Appetizer
- Big Belt Buster: Mac n cheese, burnt ends of the brisket, BBQ sauce, etc, overall it was good but I appreciate good meat so I didn't need it all combined.

Sides
- Mac n Cheese: overall it was good, except the portion I had was heavily peppered, to the point I didn't eat it
- Corn: absolutely amazing with their seasoned ""queue the trumpets' butter
- BBQ Mashed Potatoes: very good and heavy
- Green Bean Casserole (cause it's my restaurant and I can): I love green bean casserole and this did not disappoint.

Meat
- Chicken: amazing, juicy, moist, perfect 
- Pulled Pork: great texture and worked very well with the BBQ Sauce - God's Sauce
- Brisket: A-OK, but I'm a snob on this because of Stefan
- Pork Ribs: tender and fell off the bone, good flavor
- Rib Tips Sausage: wow - this was new to me, they make it in house, grinding and all, it was spicy and really different

Overall - I'd come back when I'm in the mood for a heavy lunch, super close to work and only open during the week for lunch.

2304002,2015-09-25,1,ngs16C2M_uTq2zXamltHVw,"Talk about literally the definition of hole in the wall restaurant. But one well worth going out of your way too try! I came for late lunch for recovery meal after long training day. The bad thing about coming for late lunch is most of the good stuff is out. They only open for lunch service and am sure since small operation just started up might make limited amount everyday The owner assume telling me the sausage one of the first things to go. =(( Talk about mouth watering description making the sausages fresh everyday incasing them and the whole works. Really nice! More times then not see sausage on the menu it not in house made fresh everyday. I feels like speaks volumes about not just the sausage but talking about my pulled pork sandwich I ordered. You can tell the amount of passion the owner has for bbq and love that in any business owner more less small business owners just starting up. I love talking about food. 

So the pulled pork sandwich (We Porked in Vegas) talk about hearty sandwich. You know its hearty when the meat is overflowing from the bun and the cole slaw on top doing the same. The names they have for the dishes I think is pretty cool idea. The natural dripping added another flavor and brings it all together. I reading about the God Sauce. I feel like totally legit. I honestly put that up there with just by itself! Top bbq sauces of all time. The other two sauces honest thought was ok but the GOD sauce. You need make sure get some when come visit. It had little kick but just the right about of balance that not pure heat in bbq sauce. The waffles fries was good. I really the enjoyed the seasoning that was on it. 

Say hole in the wall. There was no cars in the parking lot when pulled in. I walk in no one at the cashier stand no one around. I see bell ringer like checking in hotel or something. It felt odd for me hit it. Not very long then someone think owner came out of the kitchen. I told him first time explaining me the menu. I went with the pulled pork sandwich. He went back made it served me and cashier. Now if that not small business?? What is?? The place only has two tables of four and three bar stools. So if planning on eating in all about timing or just order food to go. No fountain machine. The drinks not sure since came late if full selection. You pick something out of stand up refrigerator. I had iced tea. They do make three fresh gallons of different juices or something that pour into cup. I forget the names of them. I just got bottle drink. The prices are very reasonable and get great portion. Not sure about the sides. I never really notice much of selection. Everything was new too me.

I can only go here on my weekends because I don't make it for dinner when I am working. Jessie Rae is the boyfriend who lives in another state just to keep you interested. 

Once I get over the betrayel to my schedule that is closing at 6pm, I love this place. I love the hole-in-the-wall, home town barbeque vibe. The place is really small, I didn't see a maximum occupancy sign but I assume anymore than 15 people would be some sort of fire hazard. There are only four tables covered in plastic table clothes, which is what I like in my BBQ joints! It's the down to earth backyard BBQ realness that I crave. My only complaint here is that I did not see or could not find any wet wipes or hand sanitizer. I left with my hands feeling pretty sticky which is uneccesary in our day and age of magic, one-time-use disposable hand cleaning clothes. 

The loaded plate was literally everything. Tater Tots and waffle fries with cheese and pulled pork and BBQ sauce. Next time I get this I am going to ask for some sauce on the side so I can SMOTHER it. It was delicious. 

The mac and cheese was good too, as well as both of the meats on my boyfriends plate. The only thing I would not get again is the green bean casserole. I thought this came out watery and the only friend onion crunch was on the top. I make green been casserole every year for my family's thanksgiving so I am some what of an expert - lol - avoid this for the other delicious sides offered by Jessie Rae's",JB4_tH5U_oN7Xl3MA4aeHw,6,5,5,lcWXHr5kG-ITmcAcMDfxBQ

Jessie Rae's BBQ is a small BBQ joint that you'll should try if you haven't already done so. Yea they're small 10 slim people could maybe fit inside. There were only 2 tables and a few stools on the inside and a few tables on the outside. They get busy during lunch and I've heard they do run out so come early. Got there at 11:30 am no one was there but a few minutes later it was packed.

Obviously when it comes to BBQ everyone is gonna have their favorites mines ribs and brisket and of course that's what I went with. The ribs here were tasty. It had a nice bark, a good smoke ring, and was real tender. Mmm I'm craving these ribs right now. The brisket I got were served a little cold, not sure if that's how they usually do it but would've enjoyed them warm or hot at least. Will need to try again.

If you like sauces on your BBQ they have three of them. The Pig Sweat which is their Carolina style vinegar sauce, the Fallen Angel which is their spicy sauce made from Carolina reaper peppers supposingly one of the spiciest peppers out there, and their God Sauce which I didn't get to try. Enjoyed the Fallen Angel and didn't care to much for the Pig Sweat.

They also have these things where it starts with a pile of waffle fries, mash potatoes, or mac n cheese then top it with sauces, cheese, spices, and meat. Doesn't look like its good for you but I want one.

Come early for a seat during lunch or you can always sit on the outside benches. They recently expanded to the seating area inside so now they have even more tables. I have tried the Jessie Mac sandwich with a side of Mac and cheese 5/5 and thought it couldn't be beat. 

Today, to my delight I found a new favorite! The belt buckle (guaranteed to make you loosen your belt buckle if you finish your plate). It comes with a bed of Mac and cheese and then topped off with BBQ beef brisket perfectly seasoned and add some signature award sauces to make it even better. Today I had the God Sauce and Fallen Angel which is made from the hottest pepper on Earth, the Carolina Reaper. They have also recently added a couple sauces to the tables: Slammin Bamma (similar to ranch but even better) and Mustiah (mustard based sauce).

It was certainly one of the better BBQ sandwiches I've ordered and the combination, while sounding daunting, worked well together as the various barbequed meats worked nicely with each other and the spicy scotch bonnet BBQ sauce they had tableside.

I could even handle that if there were either napkins or decent quality paper towels.  There were no napkins and there was a roll of paper on the table that wouldn't soak up water and wasn't perforated.  You just tear off a sheet wherever you can.

The four of us used the groupon for an awesome meal.

We go to Vegas lots, usually for a few weeks at a time.  Eating at different places is big on our list.  We've been to many over the past few decades. 
 My 10 year old daughter said after the meal, ""this is the best place in Vegas.""  I couldn't discount her statement.

The bbq plate we got was lots of good food.  Pulled pork, chicken and sausages were done right.  We also got two sides included.  The mac n cheese was the best.  I loved how they did the mash potatoes.  Still chunky with some peels in there, using quality spuds.  We ordered more sides they were so good.

And drinks included.

Not only was this great food, the value was spot on.

This is a small place.  But we loved the whole time we were there.  The lady running the place was on her own out front, but she knew what she was doing.  

I've known for decades the the best places in Vegas are off the strip.  If you're not renting a car and checking these places out, then the best of Vegas is missing you.

It's a small place in a business district. The young tatted girl working the counter was polite and helpful.

After perusing their menu I decided to order a full slab of beef ribs, a order of mac and cheese and two orders of coleslaw. With a tip it came to $53

I wanted to get a bottle of soda to go but they don't sell it by the bottle and I didn't want to spill it in my car on the way home. So I passed on the soda.

We found the entire meal to be okay. The ribs were very pink in the middle. I suppose some like it that way. But they were much more pink than we prefer.

Neither of us liked the mac and cheese. We found the macaronis to be way over cooked. We prefer them to have a little bit of firmness.

The cole slaw was the best part of the meal, although it was a bit dry. If there was a little slaw juice in with it it would be great!

So would I stop here again. Perhaps, but I think I'd try something different.

The sausage was slightly spicy and oh so delicious.  The ribs which were the wife's choice were fall off the bone tender and really tasty.  They have some unique sauces - we tried the sweet Carolina style and the spicy vinegar based sauce.   Both were very tasty and went well with all the meats.  The side dish we all got was the Cole Slaw and it was really good.  More of a sweet vinegar taste and not the mayo heavy type I have tried at other restaurants.

3216236,2015-11-02,1,ngs16C2M_uTq2zXamltHVw,"On Friday, i had a hankering for some BBQ.  So i phoned by buddy LJ and decided to meet for lunch at 1130 to beat the lunch crowd.  This place is tiny!!!  When you say hole in the wall, i think it is smaller than a hole in the wall.  it is kind of like a crack in the wall.  You can fit 8 diners comfortably in here.  

In total, 6 of us went to lunch together.  When we walked in, the place was empty.  In typical ME fashion, i wanted to try a little bit of everything.  So i went for the 3 meat combo which included a side.  Thanks to my YELP check-in, I was given a second side and kool aid for free!!!  The 3 meats i got were ribs, brisket, and pulled pork.  Sides were mac n cheese and green beans w/ pork belly.  My meal came out to $18.  This is a lot cheaper than other BBQ joints around town.  

Here comes my food.  Initial reaction was WOW that is a big portion!!  3 pork ribs, 3 large slices of brisket, and a nice scoop of pulled pork.  Portion wise, you definitely get more than what you paid for.

Now the all important part... the taste.  I dug into the sides first.  Green beans were good.  And little pieces of pork belly make any dish better.  Not sure if I would get this again, but it definitely wasn't bad.  The mac n cheese was a bummer.  Wasn't as tasty as I hoped it would be.  My complaint about both sides would be that they were both a bit bland and lacked seasoning and kick.  Mac n cheese was my least favorite item.  Next, i dug into the brisket.  Thick and juicy brisket slices got my mouth watering.  This brisket was very good.  Best brisket in town in my opinion.  Next came the pulled pork.  This fatty, smokey, juicy mound of deliciousness was delightful.  This is some very tasty pulled pork.  Last, the ribs.  the smoke ring, juiciness, tenderness, flavor... everything about these ribs made me say these are without a doubt my FAVORITE ribs in town!!  Hands down #1 no doubt about it.  

I've been reading about everyone raving about this God sauce.  Well, I don't know about this God sauce, but Fallen Angel is my new favorite BBQ sauce.  I drowned my food in Fallen Angel and it was so good.  This sauce will slap you in the face and let you know its there.  So spicy and flavorful.  I could probably drink a cup of it, its that good!!!",1JEXL5K6VTx01tAs6Jskkg,2,2,5,mk7XL2NuCk2LxBtHtvcH0A

However, this was not good BBQ. I ordered brisket and pulled pork. It did not taste like it was smoked or slow cooked or anything like that. The brisket was dry, the pork needed more time in the smoker.

Maybe it's supposed to be this way in Vegas? If so, count me out. I would not recommend this place if you've ever had good BBQ before.",O_k5cIz59f5iC0S5ijbkBQ,2,1,2,ZpTCHOdQGjG0kA_btSyIuQ

The menu is posted on the wall. Orders are placed at the counter and delivered to your table. A small variety of sodas are available in the self serve refrigerator. Plastic is used for the utensils and plate. The wait time for the food was short. This seems to be a one person operation as the same person worked the counter, filled the order in the kitchen and delivered it to the table. 

My order consisted of 2 meats and one side. I chose the spare ribs, pulled pork and green bean casserole. The ribs were meaty and tender with a deep smoke ring. The pulled pork was tender and smoky. However there was too much fat . I prefer much leaner pork. Sauce is not required but the God sauce is delicious and kicks up the flavor. Definitely try it.

The owner Mike? was out back when I pulled up and I asked him if this was the BBQ place and he said it was.  He said they had some chicken but I had wanted some pork or beef ribs.  He said they had one beef short rib left and said I can have it for $4.  I said sure because I was really looking forward to BBQ.  I had a bite and it was delicious.  Had to give the meat a little tug but it came clean off the bone. He gave it to me in a Styrofoam box so I did not see the inside of his place.  He was very friendly and also gave me a bunch of paper towels.  

I asked him what kind of smoke he uses and he said he used peach, maple, and something else I don't remember but he said he will change it up daily, weekly,... depending on what he has.  I was thinking when he said that, that he should really just stick to 1 combo, since it imparts flavor to the BBQ and the BBQ will taste different if you use different wood.  My 1 suggestion to him is if he has to change his wood (keep you minds out of the gutter) maybe stick to certain woods on specific days, that way if you try it and you like a specific type of smoke flavor you can always come back the next week for the same BBQ.  Otherwise if the smoke flavor is good one time and is not to your liking another time it would be a hit or miss if you get the same BBQ, but if you used the same wood on specific days then people would come back on that day knowing it would be good to their liking.  

Unfortunately, I do not live in Vegas otherwise I would go back earlier and really try it out.  He also said to me if I called prior to my coming and it would be late again he would make sure he would have what I had ordered.  Which when I think about it I would hope so if I ordered it before hand.  lol.

3345939,2017-05-25,3,ngs16C2M_uTq2zXamltHVw,"This review is for their food, service, and catering.

First of all the food was 15 minutes late. May not seem like a lot of time. But when your business meeting starts and there is no food to serve it's a total embarrassment. Unacceptable.

Second, the delivery driver dropped the food that was in bags on the counter and bolted out the door. He didn't say 1 word to me or the others in the room. I was confused because I thought he was coming back. But he never did. Unacceptable.

Third, I began unpacking the food from the bags. First bag was a 7 ft long roll of brown paper towels. I guess they don't give you napkins when order their BBQ. They just pull the handle on the roll of brown bathroom paper towels. Unacceptable.

Fourth, they packed the food in Styrofoam containers. Not aluminum trays. I thought this was weird. Never have I ordered catering and gotten Styrofoam containers that you typically get when you get a doggie bag at the actual restaurant. Unacceptable and very unprofessional.

Fifth, the food was all crushed from being in Styrofoam containers. Baked beans were literally spilling out the edges and onto the bag and counter. The mac n cheese also was mostly in the bag and not the container. Unacceptable.

Lastly, the food was just not that good and my business associates were extremely disappointed in the overall presentation and service provided. The last straw was the bbq sauce. They literally gave me approximately 10oz of bbq sauce for 10-12 ppl. It wasn't enough for everyone to get some. So some people got dry unflavored meat. Unacceptable.

Please use caution when ordering from this restaurant.

EDIT:

Here is the response from the owner. Great customer service...no apology, no trying to make it right. Just blaming it on the customer. Nice work guys...nice work. 

5/27/2017  First this review is because you didn't get to eat because you though the food had glouton in it and it didn't and I told the stooge you had call me that.  I would have resolved the other issue them. So let's break this down

15 minutes late. I am sorry. Give us more notice before larger catering and we will be more prepared. We did our best with the time given.  We are slow smoked bbq not McDonald's a 

We have an option for set up if you want it.  It's was not ordered.  You ordered. Just delivery.  That's what you got. 

Those rolls are not from the bathroom. We use them on our tables like most bbq restaurants do

Sorry you thought something was weird. It's what we do and never have had an issue.  An opinion like this is hardly basis for a review 

We are very sorry for it spilling.  Never have had it happen but you use the word literally a lot.  

For your next point saying literally approximately 10 oz.  sauce is an ordered item. You didn't order any so I gave you some trying to be nice 

You meat also had sauce on it. So nothing was dry and I flavorful. 

Again all issues I would have handled with your guy who called.  All which weren't not brought up.",tuiR8GCh5eX-Z8twljeueg,6,1,1,vR_kHR7Hd3vy8VnKU4rp9g

Inside it is small and there aren't very many tables, but by the time we ordered our food there was a table that opened up. They have expanded some, so there's at least more places to sit than before. Hole in the wall bbq is the best way I can describe Jessie Rae's after walking inside and honestly I wouldn't want any less. Inside was clean and there were different bbq sauces on the table all of which were good. I recently came by with a group of friends for dinner and they were giving half off the entire menu (just for that evening) to celebrate their Best of Las Vegas win. Nice! 

Three Meat Combo ($19.99) - Pick 3 meats or triple up on your favorite. This combo includes one side. The pulled pork has been inconsistent when I've visited as far as flavor, texture and look. The hot links are tasty with a nice kick of flavor. It's the brisket though that shines. Tender, juicy and flavorful brisket can be chopped per your request should you like.

Jive Chicken ($8.75 regular size) - Waffles fries piled with smoked hand-pulled chicken? Sign me up! The waffle fries had just the right crispness and held up all the toppings well. The chicken had a great flavor and was well l liked by others in my group also. 

The Belt Buckle ($11.25 regular size) - This is like the Jive Chicken, but we asked for tater tots instead of waffle fries on this one. The tater tots were crispy, tasty gems. The brisket was piled high they did not skimp. The tots really did well holding up the juicy brisket. This with either the tots or waffle fries would be a great thing for a group to share and they have a larger size also. 

Corn with Smoked Butter ($2.75) - This sounded better than it was. The corn wasn't bad, but it honestly tasted like corn from a can that was heated up in butter. 

BBQ Beans ($2.75) - I ate every bite of these beans the first visit and did the very same on the next. They drizzle a bit of bbq sauce on the top of the beans and I could have eaten another side because these beans oh my they were so good! 

Mac and Cheese ($2.75) - The first time I came the mac and cheese was very good. This last visit the mac n cheese wasn't at all the same taste or texture. I'd have rather doubled up on beans! Maybe it was just an off night for the mac and cheese since they were so busy, so I won't rule it out again in the future. 

They have a variety of sandwiches on the menu and mini cobbler for dessert. There's a private parking lot, but when it gets busy cars park on the street at the side of the building.",Fv0e9RIV9jw5TX3ctA1WbA,69,65,4,mjl3ukpDR1pbQQkFR7wvpw

 it was the not the wrong meal that was sent the owner claimed that postmates switches my beef rib to pork so that's why I got that but if that was the case why did my postmates driver call me to tell me that there was no beef ribs and I have to call you guys to switch to pork ribs? Because obviously that's what I ordered!! .... at the end of the day the order was wrong I received no refund and the meat was not good tasted like it was probably something that was returned, heated back up and gave to me and the macaroni I don't even understand how but it tasted nothing like macaroni more like green beans I swear idk if you guys are using some kind of box macaroni then just heating it up over and over again but that was just gross and I suggest you use real food cause that couldn't of been. Lastly if the food was still good but the service was just bad I'll be honest and say but this was sadly not the case for this place bad food and service.",TPMr9gc-tCSA2dwVM2eWyA,2,1,1,-9oGOx3rRQKYF0vA3EhhZQ

This is a very small place with about 4-5 tables and about 15 seatings. It's good for take outs.

I love their Maniac fries and I have to say their Pig Sweat Sauce is the best Carolina sauce I have had in Vegas . The other 2 sauces are Fallen Angel and God Sauce.

We also had pulled pork, ribs and cole slaw. The pork was close to the best I have ever had. It was really tender with a great flavor.

Coming in on Veteran's Day since the place is only up from the morning til 4 on the weekdays, I wasn't surprised to find out they had run out of a number of meats.

I did get to try the brisket, pulled pork, and rib tips, but I really did want to try some baby back and beef ribs (the latter of which is not available every day). Confusing as it is, they are also open on alternating Saturdays. The BBQ I did get to try was quite good. The quality of the brisket stood out, as well as the taste of the rib tips. Pulled pork works well with their sauces, which is really the highlight of Jessie Rae's. The God Sauce, ironically, is my least favorite because it is quite sweet. I enjoyed the hot sauce and the vinegar heavy sauces much more. They were probably the tastiest BBQ sauces I've ever had.

The sides were just okay for me here. Because someone hadn't picked up their order, I got to try some green bean casserole, waffle fries, and corn. I had expected corn on the cob but got some corn in clarified butter instead which came out a little too heavy. The green bean casserole was okay but the waffle fries were probably the best, but nothing particularly special.

Service here is friendly and being a small joint makes it have some of that charm that gets lost at big BBQ place. I definitely hope I can come by and get some baby back and beef ribs sometime soon.",KbwOwQZTOfrtaeJdmucALQ,0,2,5,xx6zZmaj7N_PBo7pQJMaUw

It's hard enough having to keep a stash of napkins with you just about everywhere you go, but trying to explain that the spot of sauce on your lapel came from another disappointing attempt at barbeque in this town is about as heartbreaking as it gets. Somedays, I wish I could just go back home to Texas. 

Jesse Rae's is not one of those barbeque places. In fact, the meat is pretty damn good. With a few exceptions on some of Mike's selections of sides, Jesse Rae's is damn good 'cue. The Fallen Angel sauce is my favorite (despite being a Carolina sauce), but the ribs are awesome without any sauce at all.

We catered in from Jesse Rae's for about 70 people a few weeks back and I have to say Mike did a bang up job. Certainly some of the best smoked meats you will find in the valley, and if Mike keeps perfecting his technique, he is not far from  being as good as you'll find anywhere in Texas.

This was borderline Jerky. Cesar Salad, was shredded cabbage with croutons and yellow and white cheese. No dressing. Who the heck makes a shredded cabbage Cesar Salad? This place might win awards for thier cherry picked items cooked to perfection for judges, but the day to day fare has no quality control and just generally sucks.

The brisket wasn't done, it's was more than likely pulled too early. Has the texture of a med rare steak. 

The chicken is chopped thighs that had the consistency of rubber. 

The ribs were fantastic especially with the Ghost pepper bbq sauce. 

The maniac was also delicious. Waffle fries with Mac n cheese and pulled pork and hot link.

It's so hard to find decently priced good BBQ in Vegas and I stopped eating Rollin' Smoke once they sold out to Pawn Stars and raised their prices. I was super excited to try Jessie Rae's after driving by it on my way to work and  decided to eat here yesterday, 11/15/17, for the first time and it will probably be my last. It was the lunch rush so it was crowded and considering how small the place is, this was handled pretty well. What I didn't appreciate was my food. I ordered the maniac fries which, as the menu says, are fries covered in mac and cheese, brisket, hot link, and bama sauce. I was charged a .75 up charge for the brisket, even though it was included with the item, and then I had to remove about 70% of the brisket as it wasn't meat, it was fat. It was a disgusting amount of fat that I tried to all keep contained to the wrapper my corn muffins came in, but it quickly spread outside of that radius and at it's peak, it was taller than the plate my food came in. I was there with a rather large group and the other person in my group who had brisket said he had the same problem, just not as severe as me. It was absolutely disgusting and over the top greasy food. I would steer clear of this ""award winning"" BBQ at all costs. I'm not a fan of Rollin' Smoke with how their prices have gone up, but at least the quality of their food is far superior to Jessie Rae's!

Edit: And what a helpful response from someone who works there! Seeing as how that was my first time there, how am I supposed to know that I need to specify what amount of fat I want for my food? I've been to TONS of BBQ places and that's never been a question. If that's an option, then whoever is taking your order should ask each customer when they place their order how much fat they'd like. And to say it's my fault that I didn't specify it because some of your customers like fatty meats, that's ridiculous. If you don't like the fact that I didn't bring it up to your staff when they were slammed and had a line out the door, or that I posted this review just one day after, then that's ok in my book. Classy customer support from the establishment. And yes, I mentioned your competitor and how 1, I don't go there anymore, and 2, about the quality of their food. If that's referencing them a lot, then I guess I'm guilty. Sorry the truth hurt with this review, but you won't have to worry about anymore from me as I won't be going back again, which I was willing to do because I wanted to try your pork and I think your sauces are great.

This is some of the top BBQ in town, almost as good as Texas BBQ, the portions are HUGE we shared a plate with an additional hot link. 

The sauces were fantastic watch out for the hot one though, because it was HOT! The flavor was very good, but it was hot. The other sauces were excellent, also. 

The ribs were excellent, we had the pork ribs and not the beef, but the table next to us had the beef ribs and they looked amazing as well. I haven't seen beef ribs that looked as good as these west of Houston Texas. 

The brisket was cooked as good as any I have had in Vegas, you could tell it was done low and slow. 

The pulled pork was cooked with care, you could also tell that this was done correctly and that the bone came right out with ease as the meat was tender and delicious.

The only thing that wasn't off the chain was the hot link, which I would have again, but I would prefer my hot links to have more spice to them. Also at a place such as this, I prefer to see them making the hot links & sausage in house, I do not believe that they are here. 

Over all this is an excellent BBQ joint even though it is small. Good things do come in small packages.

The kicker was the ""mini cobbler"" - $4 each for approx. 4oz ""cobbler"" that was almost exactly the same as the dessert that comes in a kids cuisine TV dinner (see attached pic)! So sad.

Jessie Rae's is an award winning BBQ spot that smokes the meats for 13 hours. They are also a rather new business, and in the short time they have been open they have earned quite the following (and rightfully so).  Add these things together, and as any BBQ aficionado will tell you: There is a chance they will run out of things. So get there early!

I love hole in the wall spots, and based on how busy Jessie Rae's has been every time I have gone, clearly I am not the only one that knows about this little gem. On my first visit, I left slightly disappointed as I had planned on eating my lunch there but couldn't due to a lack of seating. When I say this place is small, I mean tiny... There are only two tables inside, with room for 8-12 diners, so again,  get there early!! Or be prepared to eat outside at one of the picnic tables, or take your food to go.

On my second visit, I met Shirley B for lunch and Mike (the owner) was manning the register. What a fantastic guy, I love businesses where the owner is not simply present but actually a hands-on worker, and that's exactly how it is at Jessie Rae's. Mike was cordial and made us feel right at home as we dined. He even brought out a sample of the daily special, a phenomenal smoked Filet Mignon that I immediately wished I had ordered.

What I DID order was fantastic. I always get ribs when I am able to at a BBQ spot, and the ribs here were perfection. Tender, meaty, delicious. The brisket was excellent as well.  I loved the sides, especially the corn that Shirley got and let me sample. And that sauce! Everything I have had is lick-your-fingers good. 

If you love BBQ, be sure support this fantastic local business and give Jessie Rae's a try ASAP.",Ae4uXwFHp-5fGrt6OONaXw,5,4,5,oPptgYhwlwKytIwympBznA

4108245,2017-04-11,8,ngs16C2M_uTq2zXamltHVw,"[UPDATE 3/21/18: Confirmed via phone that they don't offer AYCE any longer. It's still yummy food though.] Having a tiny dining room to myself almost makes me wanna keep it that way, but I'm puzzled that I'm only the 6th person to try the new AYCE offer.

I was going to head back to Jessie Rae's BBQ sooner or later, and they enticed me back (relatively) sooner by announcing an all-you-can-eat offer via their Facebook page on April 1st - but they're not actually foolin' around. It's only available Mondays through Thursdays, 2-6pm, but if you really want to fill your belly with smoked meat for just $25, maybe you'd better take a day off to enjoy this.

AYCE basics here: up to two meats at a time in relatively small portions, including any pork ribs (spare or baby back, two bones at a time), pulled pork, brisket (chopped or sliced), chicken. Beef ribs and burritos not allowed, I'm not sure about limits on sides, and I'm guessing the ""loaded"" dishes, sandwiches, and tacos are good. And, of course, no to-go boxes, but I was welcome to a fountain drink and ended up shuttling my Gatorade fruit punch out the door (but let's be honest, everyone knows that drinks are such a cheap expense for businesses).

My orders went as follows:

- baby back ribs, brisket (chopped; I didn't specify), cole slaw
- spare ribs, pulled pork, waffle fries
- spare ribs, corn w/ smoked butter, tater tots

I don't recall seeing the huge, fatty spare ribs on the menu before, and I enjoyed those more than I did the relatively petite baby back ribs. Brisket and pulled pork were both pretty good, if a bit dry at times. Cole slaw was the same creamy goodness that I'd previously enjoyed, corn was not as bad as I remembered back at their now-closed second location, and both types of fried potatoes were perfect in crispy/fluffy texture and flavor. I can vouch that the tater tots stay crunchy for at least an hour, or however long it took for me to slowly clear enough stomach space to put down the last rib.

Sauces are still the star. I wasn't that enamored with the Pig Sweat (vinegar sauce) this time, but both the God Sauce and semi-spicy Fallen Angel remained addictive. That makes me grateful that they have one of each sauce bottle per table now. It's not that large an expenditure for them because there are only 4 tables inside (and a bench outside). Maybe it's just an off-hour of the day, but I was fortunate to have time to finish my scraps without feeling that I was taking up space (all the while enjoying their Futurama marathon streaming on TV).

Jessie Rae's is still one of the best local options with their ""Las Vegas Style BBQ,"" especially through their regular menu. Those are filling enough as-is, and they have the advantage of portability, so you'll only want to attack the AYCE here if you have a huge appetite and a fair bit of time - but if you do, prepare yourself for one of the better off-Strip buffets of any shape or size.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,11,10,4,Oj4m2B8EKdDpKqLQnh241A

Bad Location:  In the middle of the raw construction supplies district where there are no other restaurants or residences for miles, very inconvenient.  And there are only 5 parking spots.  The inside is just big enough for 5 dirty tables and a sticky floor.

Poor Service:  The girl behind the counter was so inept that I almost felt sorry for her.  It was like they randomly picked a girl at a shopping mall and threw her behind the register to take orders 10 minutes before I arrived.  She was completely aloof.  The menu is not user friendly, some items don't describe to you what they are.  I asked other people in line and they agreed the menu was difficult to understand.

Overpriced Food:  It would take a lot of BBQ sauce to cover the mistakes with the dry $12 brisket.  My order was incorrect but since my first interaction was such a pain I said screw it and tried it.  So bad I just got up and left.  ""God Sauce"" is a stupid name and is mildly offensive.

I was playing at tournament at the Rio when I started craving ribs. Asking the experts at the hotel - security - one name echoed enough times to send me straight to Yelp. Jessie Rae's not only came up instantly in paid ads, smart, as well as a good sign but it was also close by. And it's reviews were terrific. 

My flip flop got stuck under the front door as it closed behind me and it took me three attempts to free it. ""I hate when that happens,"" the lady behind the counter said, removing my embarrassment after a clumsy entrance. Owner Mike Cross wasn't around, after all it was Sunday night, but his mother, Samantha was. ""Are you visiting, this your first time?"" She asked. I was a virgin. But If the food was good as the customer service was, I'd be luckier here tonight than at the casino. 

As I eyed the menu wall, Samantha offered ""Whatever you order, you have to try the god sauce, you'll be back for more."" I was studying the Wall, I began drooling while choosing, a good sign. The smells were teasing me. Her words still ringing in my ears, my choice got easier because I was told I'd be back. I'd try the ""Big Belt Buckle, brisket covered waffle fries covered in cheese"" and the pulled pork sandwich another time. ""Ribs, pulled pork and Mac and cheese for my side"" was my order.
""Help yourself to some sauces and I'll bag you up"", Sam advised.
I chose the house BBQ, which Sam told me was the god sauce. I doubled down.

The lady working there said that happens all the time..I mean, you already are open short hours, why would you be out an hour or so into opening? Anyway, I wanted to get the 3 meat combo. Since all they had left was chicken, pulled pork (which I am not a fan off) and brisket I went ahead and got double brisket. Now normally I don't mind being charged extra for stuff, but since you are out of the very thing I came in for, you might want to stay off charging me $7 extra just for getting double brisket. That and having to bag my own to go order, as I was just handed a togo box with another togo box with my side on top of it ( I guess I should just carry all that in my hands). So I already had a bad taste in my mouth, even before trying the food.

Now for the food. First of all I really didn't care for the bbq sauce at all. They smother the whole order in it, so I really had no choice but to have it anyway. Brisket was pretty dry. There was a good amount of it and the chicken but both were bland. It was probably a little better than the majority of Las Vegas bbq places, but that's not saying much. The mac&cheese was limp overcooked bowtie pasta with cheese..hmm. Baked beans I ordered as an extra side, because it happens to be one of my favorites. They were pretty good, smokey and pretty tasty.

The place is small but very organized. 
I ordered a two meet combo brisket and something else (sorry I can't remember what it was). When we arrived it was lunch hour so it was a bit crowded but we found a table pretty quickly. It's a BBQ joint so it isn't fancy at all so don't be discouraged by the decor because the food is pretty good. 
I personally think he prices were a bit high for what we were served and the guy that took our order was a bit short with us as we tried to figure out the menu.

I've been eyeing this place for a while, all of the reviews and pictures had me drooling. So my friend and I made our way over yesterday and... behold disappointment!
We tried the meat and side sampler that's available with a Yelp check-in ($16pp). It came with Brisket, Pork Baby Back Ribs, Beef Ribs, Pulled Pork, and BBQ Chicken. The sampler produced lots of food but honestly wasn't worth it. Most of the meet was really dry. The brisket and pulled pork were least dry but just OK. Both turned out pretty fatty. The pulled pork was actually juicy in some parts and was fall apart consistency but dry and chunky in other parts. 
Sides were OK, we got Mac n Cheese, Corn, Beans, Potato Salad, and some weird chunky potatoes - kind of like breakfast potatoes that had mash mixed into them? Mac n Cheese is my favorite side but it was not cheesy at all. It actually did not resemble what I have seen in other pictures at all. My favorite side here was the potato salad which I am usually not a fan of but it was the best side here. Food tasted like it wasn't fresh, especially the meat. The beef ribs were especially dry. Like super stiff pieces, dry.
The food is nothing I would come back for but the home made BBQ sauce and the nice owner is what added a star. I actually felt bad because the owner asked how we liked the food and I wanted to tell him! I felt bad doing so in front of other customers. It's a tiny place and you will not have a conversation at your table without all the other tables hearing it. Think, size of a master bedroom.
Who knows may be if the food was fresh it would taste better? I can't see how it wouldn't.",uc9ITBuspRFkl-S3Bo90dg,11,6,2,JbZVkuyvJBmbDMZTDNJGbg

When we got there, the parking lot was completely empty which I took as a bad sign. But, Yelpers promised it was great, so we soldiered on. Inside, the place was packed, which I took as a good sign.


This place is a hole in the wall in every sense. It's in kind of an industrial area, it's a tiny place with maybe 4 tables, and there is nothing fancy inside (broken floor tiles, mismatched chairs, self service drinks/sauces). While we were waiting for our take out order, a family (clearly from out of town) came in and was obviously put off, and even asked if they were in the right place and if there was a 2nd location somewhere. BUT, I can overlook all of it as long as the food is great, right??

So was the food great?? Again, a mixed bag. As far as the meats go, A+. The chicken and brisket were both excellent. Super tender and flavorful. I, also, enjoyed the sauces. They have 3 to choose from, a thinner vinegar based sauce, a thicker/sweeter sauce, and a super spicy ghost pepper?? sauce. I enjoyed the 1st 2. My husband braved the 3rd one and confirmed it's spiciness, but felt it still had a good and balanced flavor.

Where the food disappointed me was in the sides department. I had both the baked beans and the corn with smoked butter. Both just tasted like they came out of a can. Really disappointing given how great the meats were. I was told by another customer to order the waffle fries, and I wish I had heeded that advice.",4guhHcnzrximsz-DeEvskg,9,1,3,sGR_YVfZlKxpudqQ872rVQ

I ordered delivery, I'm not sure if this makes a difference, but I thought it was worth mentioning. I had The Duke (pulled pork) on Mac & Cheese. In the same order, but for someone else, was The Belt Buckle (brisket) on Mac & Cheese, and a few 2 meats and 1 side combos, meats including chicken, brisket, spare ribs, and pulled pork.

The biggest problem was the sheer amount of grease that was on The Duke and the Belt Buckle. It was seriously off putting. The second problem was that the mac and cheese had zero cheese flavor and the macaroni pasta was over cooked, incredibly bland.

The meats themselves were tender, but overall lacking in the flavor department. I honestly mostly tasted grease, even after draining the grease off my meal. The thought of getting waffle fries or tots that would soak up the grease is just terrifying to me.

I felt the food was over priced for what we got. Portions of the Loaded in Las Vegas meals (aka the Duke and Belt Buckle) were good, but the flavor made me feel it wasn't worth it.

1. The place is SMALL.  It's not really worth it to try to eat there.  I was forced to eat outside at the picnic table.  A table that doesn't get wiped down too often BTW.  
2.  The girl at the front counter needs to learn to stop texting when a customer comes up to order.  She also needs to learn to bring napkins with her when she brings food to the guy sitting outside.
3.  They ran out of Brisket.  How does a BBQ place run out of their most popular meat by 3:00PM?
4.  Their current location is in a sorta seedy part of town.  It's not very close to where anybody lives.  Since the store is so small they sort of depend on take out, but I don't really think the place is worth the drive.  

I used to live in Texas and to be honest there really aren't any good BBQ places here in Las Vegas.  So I am hard to please when it comes to BBQ.  I wish these folks well.  I hope they can move to a larger restaurant soon for their own sake.",8YaFdh5fGg-M6KPIHv7ivw,1,0,3,AaHw1E_LKnHhcdUUn-eIfA

Despite that I wanted to return the next day I call to place an order, but they ran out of meat, so whatever I figure I come back tomorrow.

Next day I come in, same issue no meat other than spareribs, I find this out after waiting for two, "" people"" to ask every question under the sun about portion sizes.

These two somewhat minor inconveniences and the fact the location is out of the way is keeping me from ever returning again, there's a lot of good BBQ places here to spend money at that are much more convenient.

It explains why each visit I made only 3 people were there despite the food being good quality, maybe I'll try them again in 2019.

It was cooked ok, the ribs were very skinny and honestly tasteless.  No smoke flavor more like a baked style with a broiled skin.  The ribs tasted ok and the food did stay down, which has become a standard for me here in vegas.  I would suggest rolling smoke, at least there is a flavor, there brisket is actually brisket and you get a roll to die for.  I will not be back to Jessies and will not recommend it to any fares.

Award winning?  Yes.  But accolades aside, the real reason I wanted to try them;  the direct, bordering on rude comments the owner / pit master leaves on less than glowing reviews.  Anyone willing to lash out and defend their food must take pride in what they serve.

Put up or shut up.

Four guys,  all solo meats (sold by the half pound) and ribs (sold by 1/3, 1/2, full rack).  Sides are not necessary and take up stomach real estate needlessly.

Brisket - Fat requested.  Nice bark, excellent smoke ring, sweet smoke flavor throughout, solid rub imparting a good seasoning, relatively moist and pull apart tender.
 
Beef Ribs - Good amount of meat on them bones.  Nice bark, deep smoke ring and once again sweet smoke flavor.  Great seasoning, very moist, and tender.  

Pork Ribs - Beef is king but these were good.  Fall off the bone tender.  Well seasoned.  The sweet bitterness of the smoke works to increase the natural sweetness of the pork.

Though not a sauce guy, let's just say the God Sauce (sweet tomato based sauce) should be used instead of chocolate in the bedroom.  Squirt it on anything good.  The Pig Sweat (Carolina style sauce) works well with pork if you're into that.  The Fallen Angel (sweet tomato based sauce with distinct flavor and spice of habaneros) packs a kick without killing the taste buds though heightens the bitterness of the smoke.

Prices in line.  Service, friendly but no nonsense.  Go early, they do sell out.  

In the end, all the fundamentals of proper low and slow BBQ are present.  A meal happily enjoyed on the hood of the car.",oeAhRa8yFa9jtrhaHnOyxQ,32,33,4,y7zci3Z9aWDU4DC8-v71hQ

Uber dropped me at a hole in the wall that's cramped even by the limited standards of rib joints. Ordered the 1/2 rack of baby backs while dodging the elbows of the guy at the next table. Ribs appear quickly enough, but the sloppy, too-cool-to-want-to-be-good-at-his-job server promptly dumps them on my lap, staining my jeans.  The too-cool-for-this-shiznit dude hands me a couple of feet of the lowest spec of cheap paper towels -- the kind that doesn't actually absorb ANYTHING, much less bbq sauce -- and disappears.

Another guy (the owner? He seemed to care) has noticed and quickly brings out a damp towel for my jeans, which helped a lot.

So, not exactly a great first impression. And I was sitting there thinking I was going to one-star this place like nobody's business.

But then I bit into the first baby back. Holy crap. Kid you not, the best ribs of my entire life. Just amazing. Flawless, delicious, thick, meaty, juicy to the point of insanity.  My mind is still reeling, actually, and it's now hours later.

So count this as a ten-star review for the ribs, because they started five in the hole.

We had some family in town visiting from North Carolina and brought them here for lunch. We ordered quite a bit, as we were a super hungry party of 5, and were accommodated so quickly. My family was blown away. Totally loved it. Said it was better than any BBQ they had in the Carolinas.

But the ribs. Oh. My. God. The spare ribs are to die for. Literally, the best freaking ribs I've ever had. My 5 year old son would agree. I have never seen a kid that size put down that much meat and that many waffle fries in my life. He LOVED the pastrami special last month. I don't think I've ever seen a kid eat pastrami. I consistently have to argue with him to share because he is convinced he's going to eat a 3 meat combo with fries and a full rack of ribs by himself. In the end, he puts down half of it, all the fries, and asks for an additional side of fries to go. 

Back to the ribs. Fall off the bone tender. Flavorful, juicy. PLENTY of meat. You definitely get your monies worth here. Anything you order will be good, I promise you. They have won LV's Best BBQ & Sauce for a damn good reason. Beef rib special on Thursdays, which I am dying to try!

However if you are seeking price value, customer service and food quality this place fell short of my expectations with such high reviews from others. 

I took my family of four for a new BBQ experience only to walk away really disappointed. We all ordered the meat combos and what was served on they trays wasn't worth the price at all. Really the trays were half empty. I ordered chicken and brisket with potato salad. The cashier yelled from the kitchen door they were out of potato salad then walked up to the table and asked what else I wanted which was nothing however the rest of the family got a mac and cheese to share. I got five chunks of dried chicken and a slice of brisket that was 1/3 fat slab. My mom did say the hot links were good and my little did enjoy their mac and cheese. They gave us complimentary corn bread that was served cold with a slop of butter on top which really wasn't a treat; honestly I thought it was to makeup for items that weren't available but no she did it for everyone in the restaurant. It was just really mediocre and I am disappointed we spent $100 for a meal that left us leaving feeling blah and even worse when we walked out we still were not satisfied of having our craving for BBQ fulfilled. 

Also with my oldest son aspiring to be a chef himself one day he found it really disappointing when the kitchen door opened and the prep area was filthy and food was being kept in crock pots. 

As I sit here writing my review the hostess is bragging that no one ever complains or is disappointed leaving well we decided that the four of us won't need to eat here again.",egVbhRsX9Ggf84v_2uA40Q,3,1,2,xcfu_-0Kfyscfr3tbzFrog

He had Jessie Rae's a couple days earlier, but said he wanted to eat it again since it was THAT good. I initially wanted to eat something on the lighter side but I thought what the hell, why not. I'll go to the gym to work it off (we'll see about that).

Ordered about $60 worth of food for 3 people (if you want a full meal with enough sides to go around, expect to spend around that much, which is normal for good bbq). We got ribs and pulled brisket for our meats and mac n cheese, coleslaw, baked beans, and corn for our sides.

Now I'm no southern BBQ connoisseur but I've tried a good number of places so I have a good sense of what's mediocre and what stands out. Jessie Rae's BBQ is the best I've had hands down. The sides were all delicious, especially the Mac n cheese. Cheesy but not gooey or mushy. The meat fell right off the bone for the ribs and when you dunk them into the sauces they provide, ""MMMMM willy don't it make you wanna slap yo mama!!"" (Friday reference, anybody?)

Brisket - spices on it are good 

Baby Back Ribs - fall off the bone and so tender...fire

Rib Tips - so tender, so flavorful, so good and i don't even fuck with pork like that

Mac & Cheese - pretty good however the best I have had

Cornbread - the butter on this was flames...had to be brown sugar and something

Sauces were such boss. That Fallen Angel sauce ain't that spicy but has that shit that makes your soul burn slow and have the flavor that you need for some heat...

I ordered a two meat combo with bbq mashed potaoes,  and my buddy got 3 meat with house made mac n cheese.  I made sure to get ribs and pulled pork,  since any good bbq place should do those well.

5754656,2015-11-02,0,ngs16C2M_uTq2zXamltHVw,"There aren't a lot of great BBQ places in Las Vegas. To be honest, the best brisket in Vegas is in the Caesar's Buffet, which should tell you something. Jessie Rae's is a bit of a diamond in the rough.

Went for lunch, the wait was reasonable but the location is small. There are two picnic benches outside, but you probably want to grab an go unless you have the time.

The Duke and the Big Belt Buckle are both great served over waffle fries. Good sauce, decent meat to starch ratio, and a pretty hefty portion.

The sides are pretty solid as well, the corn is amazing, the green beans are green beans and the mac and cheese leaves something to be desired but is a solid dish for a colder day.

As most have said, the sauces are good. The God Sauce is amazing and has a great balance to the sweetness, the Fallen Angel is not for the faint of heart (if you don't say to people ""I like spicy"" don't try this sauce), and the Carolina style sauce should remind you of good East Coast BBQ (assuming you believe that exists).

Now to the most important part, the meats:

1. Brisket - solid brisket, sliced in relatively thick chunks. Good smoke development and usually a fattier cut (seems like the didn't trim off as much as other places to, the flavor thanks them for this). Not great bark though.

2. Pulled Pork - Another solid meat. The juiciness and the texture is what you want from a pulled port, very soft but not chewy. The flavor is somewhat lacking and probably requires sauce (not that you wouldn't just opt for the great sauce anyways).

3. Ribs - These are the best part. Honestly, they fall off the bone and taste spectacular. I got the three meat plate just so I could try the ribs, and the only thing I realized afterwards was I should have gone three meat just ribs. If you're a fan of ribs, you want some of these, stop looking at those sandwich options, get the ribs.

4. Burnt Ends - I'm really sorry to say, this is the low point of the menu. Not only is there a significant upcharge for the burnt ends, but they just aren't true burnt ends. Some places trim the bark and call those burnt ends, most places don't even try, the burnt ends here are just smaller pieces of the end cap. NO bark, NO juicy/fatty goodness. Do NOT fall in the trap of getting burnt ends (see above, just get ribs).

5. Chicken - Wasn't able to try the chicken, but if everything else is any reflection of the quality, this should be good.

Service: This was pretty excellent. The people were great and the food came out in a reasonable time.

Side Note: if you hop around back you can see a more traditional smoker and a pretty big Traeger. I'm willing to be that these key ingredients keep things pretty moist and flavorful. Big plus.",kpav7NNqI5lGRPzKLzNW_w,0,0,4,4LlRsIIkoboZyZFUxFYZtA

The brisket was tender, juicy and flavorful and maybe a little bit of their award winning BBQ will enhance the flavor a bit more, though not necessary.  The rib tips, though a bit fatty, was again really tender and I expected crispy ends- but I must have mistaken.  I tried all different sauces that was offered and the award winning one tasted the most traditional and my preferred sauce.
The belt buckle- with my choice of waffle fries and tots as my base, I was really disappointed that they were not crispy at all.  I did not enjoy any of the sauces that were laced over the dish, but I managed to pick out the brisket to get a better taste of it.
