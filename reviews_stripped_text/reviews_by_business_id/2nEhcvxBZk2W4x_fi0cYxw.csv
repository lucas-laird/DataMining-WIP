942588,2017-06-05,0,2nEhcvxBZk2W4x_fi0cYxw,Never. Never. NEVER AGAIN! I've had this place on three separate occasions trying my hardest to give it a shot and I've came to conclusion this place is just not it. The past two times I've been this place literally will send you straight to the bathroom. I got the carne asada nachos and my boyfriend got a burrito. My boyfriend literally began to throw up after his third bite and for myself I was in the bathroom for over an hour. Sorry to over share but this place is horrible. Save your money and the trip because it's definitely not with it.,y7EV345ZeCu8qusu1eO11g,0,0,1,oZzuTdFeAta4xFtJ7iXVcQ

You may need to speak as little as possible as they do not speak much English.  They are also one of the few locations with a shrimp burrito, which is very good and always served hot!  This location has a very interesting interior and it almost seems like a converted McDonald's or something like that.  If you use the drive-thru, beware that it may take 10-20 min. for your food.  They have plenty of parking and never have a long order line.",bpJLcSlkjCPtsFWwA_QIkQ,3,0,5,YQAp_0FJCPwTew6PoHX8XQ

2853609,2014-07-30,1,2nEhcvxBZk2W4x_fi0cYxw,"Aint nothing better than good ol' carne Asada fries! 

This location is pretty ungenerous with their portions.. Unlike their other locations! When I order carne asada fries they limit the amount of meat they put on it. And 90% of the time when I say ""No Beans"", they always  give me beans! 

I've only been inside once and I suggest just going thru the drive thru. So you can avoid coming out smelling like carne asada. The drive thru is pretty fast surprisingly. 

There's always this homeless man at the end of the drive thru trying to wash your windows. It kind of creeps me out because he won't stop talking to you.",pxzs-Dy2hXTis-PuNCV37Q,3,1,2,RrgLSmlzzYDncSeY2ZoVsQ
3029593,2010-10-24,0,2nEhcvxBZk2W4x_fi0cYxw,"Well, when I went into this place I did not know what to expect... I walked in and holy cow this place was so not mexican food. I should have expected not authentic duh... But nope. This place is like a fast food version of taco bell hahaha, or a fast food version of Baja Fresh. I ordered a burrito the meat was the only real good part of it. The rice and beans were dull to say the most. Plenty of parking, but the place inside is clean, clean bathroom, but boring colors inside. Weird because it has a lot more of these little stands everywhere here. I would recommend this place to anyone who wants to break into Mexican food and then go to little mexican places after this then to the big boys.",un5LELsWFeTx8-B8hcArRg,1,1,2,L1gSCPNZHxNi2duwCgbOFQ

First they mixed up our orders, when I brought it to their attention the cashier told to switch. I explained it to him that my girlfriend is allergic to guacamole, he rolled his eyes mumbled something under his breath & by the time they were done with my order my girlfriend had already finished her meal so I had to put my food in a to go box & leave.  I have never had a problem with any of the other locations except this one & again they will not see my business this location ever again.",icI8UhG6sR9YLIreQeJVUg,0,0,1,JH8dycWFKVfbEbc2SzBcSg

You will also get an equally generous portion of guacamole, and all the ingredients that make up the carne asada fries.  Its prices are fair enough for how much food you get as well.  From what I understand, the other Roberto's locations do a better job, but this wasn't bad at all.",Aeo_Z1FwOjRs6UHdJ3NRHg,1,0,4,5Dqnr_N1UspPAWpXp060MQ

The food has always been good for a quick meal. It tastes the same as it did when it opened. I just wished they would include drinks with their combos. The Large soda is over $2.00.",6UQlnFvSr5dUJuy0RA-M2Q,0,0,3,_QYbl6YJQrV1G2hSUQWvfw
