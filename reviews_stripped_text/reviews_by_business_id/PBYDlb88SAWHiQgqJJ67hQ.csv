124282,2012-12-31,0,PBYDlb88SAWHiQgqJJ67hQ,"I'm sure by now you've probably heard about all the graffiti artists that contributed to the interior of the space, and if you haven't you can read about on their site. The restaurant is laid out with a pretty cool bar along one side decorated with old skateboard decks, some high top seating in the middle, and a few large private booths on the opposite side. There's also an outdoor patio with a great view of the fountains and strip, a large seating area in the back surrounded by neon and many TV screens, and even a mechanical pickle you can ride when you purchase their Rattlecan Pickleback shot. There's plenty to look at in here between all the artwork, carvings on the tables, attractive waitresses... it may be loud and a bit too much for some, but I found it to be very cool.

Their menu is equally stacked: several burgers to choose from, hot dogs, salads, pickled items and a huge selection of beers and cocktails. We couldn't resist one of their appetizer items after reading it, their BBQ pork donut: crisp tempura BBQ pork stuffed roll, honey drizzle with a pickled jalapeno. It was sweet, crunchy and delicious. Their poutine also sounds amazing, and will be ordered on a future visit. 

After much deliberation I went with their namesake Rattlecan burger: custom house blend angus beef, cheese, bacon, caramelized onions, pickle, special sauce, and L/T on a sesame brioche roll. Upon first bite you can taste quality meat and excellent flavor. The patty had great char flavor, and was cooked close to medium rare but maybe a bit overdone. The bacon had amazing smoky flavor, the caramelized onions were really good, and my cheese was perfectly melted and very tasty too. There was just enough L/T and they were fresh as well. The bun was probably the star of the show; it was so dense yet flaky on the top, it was well proportioned and had just really great flavor. Although the picture may make this look like a whopper as some people have pointed out, it is worlds ahead of it and far superior. Easily one of the better burgers I've had this year.

I got a pro tip from a friend that the crinkle-cut fries might be of the frozen variety and that I should go with the house-cut fries instead. Since this burger comes with crinkle-cut I was sure to make this adjustment in my order and I'm glad I did. The fries were great, which came as a welcome surprise considering the fries upstairs at First really took away from what could have been a strong burger meal on my last visit. These were cooked well with the skins on them; crispy and delicious without a lot of the bad oily flavor I refer to often. I'll note that I was initially charged the full $7 for the cost of house-cut fries on both burgers on my bill because of this swap, but our waitress not only had that removed, but also took off the supposed $2.50 fee that should have remained for this change. While there is a $1.50 difference between the two types of fries on the menu, I'm not sure I like the idea of having to pay more to swap these out. I almost always hate crinkle-cut, so I'm not cool with being forced to pick something else. Also, if I were to pay $7 for the small amount of house-cut fries as a side, I would be pretty pissed, even considering how good they were.

Our entire meal with an appetizer, two burgers and two drinks came to a slightly steep $66.75. $12 for my small but tasty cocktail is a bit expensive, and I could probably do without the two small pork donuts for $11. My burger and fries were a very reasonable $16 given the strip location and just how good it was. If you can deal with just a burger meal with two waters or something this is very good food for the money, but it can easily creep up to an expensive burger outing if you're not careful. I'll also mention their gluten free bun option which I think is great; my girlfriend has been trying to stay gluten free but it isn't always easy when eating out around town. It's a .75 cent additional charge, but you get a very large, rosemary-flavored, good looking bun. It was very good compared to others I've had, but it's still not the same compared to a real bun, and certainly not the sesame brioche I had with mine. Also, Liz our server was super attentive and extremely friendly. All the wait staff seemed very attentive and fun, just like the restaurant itself. Rattlecan is certainly an amazing burger, and finally gives some other places in the property a run for their money.",0G9BcXSQscv_GnhlNwFfjw,1,0,5,vK71PQd4yG13a9WRWgcGhQ

The Rattlecan Burger was amazing. DEFINITELY THE BEST BURGER I HAVE HAD IN VEGAS... and that takes on some pretty strong burger joints. The Hot Mess is one of the most unique dishes I have seen in a while...think of it like a comfort food Bi Bim Bop., Great micro beer selection.

then, the KILLER ART! The place is completely tagged by some of the best graphitti artists in the country. Solid classic, indie and alternative rock music playlist. I have more respect for the Venetian Hotel now--this was cool and contemporary and i bet it becomes the hot new destination restaurant in Vegas. Go now while the lines are still short.

In other news the prices are steep for what you get. We ordered the sliders which I believe were $12 dollars. We received 3 White Castle tasting burgers. They were good and came out fast, but i'll be damned if I couldn't go to the local grocer and get a Family Size box of 12 for $6.99. Usually sliders are ground, formed and grilled in house. These tasted like White Castle.

No sides to speak of with that price tag. The drink was $13 and with tip we spent $29 for 3 sliders and a drink. I'll hit up with Slidin' Thru next time.",4vj_0BQeXjCyNB7ESS5mGg,1,0,3,kCg4WaiMv18n-o-cErtBGQ

Rattlecan was a great place for burgers, appetizers, and drinks. You can choose from a variety of toppings and dips for their fries/tater tots. It WAS located at the Venetian Hotel and Casino. I thought it was a good idea for them to have Rattlecan here on property because not everyone can afford $$$$$$ restaurants here at the Venetian. Besides Grand Lux Cafe, nothing else was really ""within budget for an average tourist.""

My boyfriend got their signature Rattlecan burger while I got some burger with spicy sauce (forgot the name of it...sowwie!!) If anyone had Fuku Burger before, my burger tasted something like the spicy burger from Fuku. It was delish! I cut my burger in half and wanted to save the other half for lunch the next day, but it was so delicious that i HAD to eat the rest of it!!! =D

I was sort of glad I did. Now before I go forward, it was new years day and after a long night I was not feeling good. Midway through my meal I really started to feel awful and started getting the chills. I left and went straight back to my hotel room and soon after I was running a fever.
Now, back to the restaurant. I liked the setup of the place, and as soon as I walked in I was greeted by the sounds of the stones. I sat at the bar and just ordered a coke. I ordered a burger named after the place and it was good. But around the time I started eating, I started to feel bad. I had to take the bacon off. I did finish the burger and it was very good.

3026260,2012-11-10,4,PBYDlb88SAWHiQgqJJ67hQ,"Chef Sammy D and Antonio Ballatore have a great little gem on their hands. Amazing graffiti wall to wall, great food, a well stocked bar, and a mechanical pickle!

The Graffiti is done by many artists (way too many to name), everywhere you turn there more art, there isn't really a surface that was left untouched. There are also QR codes all over so that you can find out more info about the piece/artist (QR codes should be operational in about a week). The bar was showing a interesting video medley of music videos, old tv show clips, and videos of all of the artists painting the walls.

The menu is pretty big, there's an entire section of pickled items, a salad selection, an expansive burger menu, plus a decent side of fries. The Kitchen was insanely fast and our food arrived pretty much right after we ordered.

We started with Pickles, the LVS Fries (which are Sammy D's take on poutine), and BBQ Pork Doughnuts. The  Pickles were good nothing special, but a nice start. The LVS Fries are a unique twist on Poutine, Hand Cut Fries with Gravy, Cheddar Curds, and a pepper (maybe a touch too much pepper) but all in all a great side. I had the Wildstyle Burger, a big patty (cooked to a perfect medium rare), Smoked Gouda, Pulled Pork, Cole Slaw, and pickles on a Pretzel Roll. The burger was much bigger than I expected from a place on the strip. The flavors blended together well, my only regret was not adding the Nueske's Bacon.  The meal ended with a present from Antonio Ballatore, he sent over a free order of the BBQ Pork Doughnuts. Imagine a deepfried pastry filled with delicious bbq pork, coated in honey sauce, with a hint of pickled jalapeno, served up in a basket. A great combo of savory and sweet.

The Bar selection was impressive, a wide variety of beers on tap, several seasonal and micro brews that are not readily available anywhere else on the strip. They also have Jameson Shots with a pickle back, drink them both and get a token to ride their mechanical  pickle, you you read that right they have a mechanical pickle that you can ride.

I will go back and give it a more formal review, this was just a soft opening and there were a few glitches (nothing major). The food was great, the portions were bigger than I expected, the price point is right on par for the strip, and it's conviently located next the Venetian Poker Room and Sports Book, which IMHO is a great location for a Burger Joint.",hyIVFPfm3TyPWQf0Xh9u1Q,10,6,4,c5ZAD-F_dhCLtWsswHG0Tw

It's too bad because the lvs fries were pretty good.

My brother and I were traipsing all over the Palazzo and I had decided to take him to lunch at First Food & Bar upstairs. Unfortunately some changes must have been made at First because they routed us downstairs to Rattlecan, stating that the menu was by the same chef and so would be similar. 

Well - yes and no. For starters, Rattlecan is kind of synonymous with everything that I hate about the cheesiest parts of Las Vegas. Garrish, loud decor spills out from around every corner and pops out of every wall. The Urban Daddy piece written about RC describes it as ""This feels like a place where Axl Rose would have started a fight on the Appetite for Destruction tour,"" but my response to that is ""Not hardly."" 

For one the menu is priced way to high for anybody on the Appetite for Destruction tour. For too, I doubt Axl Rose would have ventured past the entrance to the restaurant after casting his eye inward. 

Anyway...the food, which is REALLY what this is about. We had the Pastrami Sandwich and Mini Wagyu Burgers. 

The Pastrami sandwich was very serviceable, along with the mini Wagyu sliders, although, I seriously doubt that the sliders were made with real Wagyu. Tasted like burger meat to me. 

Unfortunately I'm going to have to pass on this experience and I can't really recommend it to others. The food was decent, and the service was good too, but at the end of the day there are just tons and tons of better choices to be made in Las Vegas.

5204214,2012-12-08,0,PBYDlb88SAWHiQgqJJ67hQ,"Yelp told me this was a hot new place, so I figured I give it a try. Initially I had a bit of a tough time finding the place, as there was no hint as to where this was from the Yelp reviews. Turns out it is in the Venetian casino area. It's new enough that when I asked someone who worked at the Venetian where it was he said: ""I don't know. Is it new?""

I ordered take out from the bar as I was grabbing something to go to eat with my girlfriend. I was not too big of a fan of the atmosphere of the restaurant, luckily I was getting food to go. I ended up ordering a veggie burger, an ahi tuna burger, fried pickles, and pickled beets. All told around $50. While I was waiting for the food, I figured I would grab a beer. It took me a bit to decide what I wanted, and when I finally decided it turns out that the beer was nearly tapped out so there wasn't a full glass to be had. While the bartender went to look to see if the keg could be swapped, the food came. I was surprised at just how quickly the food came. So in the end, I got to taste the beer, but did not actually sit and drink a beer. Oh well, maybe next time.

Now onto the food! My girlfriend and I ended up sharing the burgers. The veggie burger seemed like typical fare to me, having previously been a long time vegan, though when my girlfriend tried it she exclaimed ""I don't think this is a veggie burger."" So it apparently does a decent enough job of masking that it is a veggie burger for some folks.

The veggie burger was topped with guacamole and was pretty good. I thought the burger itself was a little over done, but overall yummy. The ahi tuna burger, was tasty as well, but my girlfriend and I both agreed that the veggie burger was still a little better.

Now for the pickled delights! This is the first time I've had fried pickles before, and I have to say I really liked them! It's definitely worth a try. If you've had pickled beets before, well these will taste pretty familiar. Overall, I liked the pickled fare as a nice compliment to the burgers, though I really like pickled stuff.

Overall it was nice. It is a change of pace from a lot of the other burger joints in the area.",5iOHz6pHmXi9SoB5qomRWQ,1,0,4,2MZ5XvXcKUNcNiDLcyERAQ

As we were walking past the sports bar area, we found this joint and felt like trying something new. The décor of the restaurant is definitely different from the Venetian; it kind of reminded me of Hot Topic. We made our way into this restaurant/bar and as we sat, we immediately saw the specialty of this place to be burgers. We all ordered the Rattlecan burger with a side of tater tots and fries. 

On my Rattlecan, I chose to put an egg and ordered a side of the ghostbuster chili just to add some kick to my burger/tater tots. My friend ordered a drink but didn't realize it came late until the nice waitress came with the drink and apologized for the drink coming late. On top of that, she comp'ed it since she felt bad for it. Now this is the type of Vegas service that makes me LOVE Vegas. 

When our burgers came out, we didn't realize how HUGE these burgers were! The burgers here are definitely big enough to share so for those with a lighter appetite, keep that in mind! Also, this restaurant doesn't ask how you want your burger cooked. They automatically cook it to medium (pink in the center) and that's how it should be! The burgers come with the usual fix ins: tomato, cole slaw, and pickles. The burger itself was pretty good but for those wanting a kick, order a side of the ghosbuster chili and smother your burger/tater tots. **FYI The ghostbuster chili IS spicy so for those that aren't too keen on the heat, don't go overboard!

The food here was relative to Vegas price: 16-20$ for a burger. All in all, I liked the burger here and see myself coming back here again!",jcvXH02Iax1M_fCkruXelQ,4,2,4,nx2LpZKhugPTHxLh__-FEQ
