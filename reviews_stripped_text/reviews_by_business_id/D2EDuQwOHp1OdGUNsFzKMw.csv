164598,2015-03-15,0,D2EDuQwOHp1OdGUNsFzKMw,"I rarely eat at Taco Bell. As in, never. It's been a good year or more & instead of fighting off the bean burrito no red sauce craving, I took a lovely 30 second drive down the road to the nearest Taco Bell. 

The first thing I noticed in the emptier than empty fast food joint was how filthy it was. Floors a mess, tables needing a thorough wipe down, dried sauce splatter & drippy drink trails everywhere. And it smelled. What was that awful smell?  

Since I've not looked at a menu in ages, everything was new to me. And it all looked really good. The poster of the 2 rolled tacos had me at first glance, how disappointed I was when told ""We don't got those no more.  That's a promotion item.""  So why is the sign up?  ""It's a promotion that ended.""  Oh?  When was that?  ""Today. They're changing the sign tomorrow.""  Um....o-kayyyy

Shortly after placing our order, a mad rush of hungry folks stormed in. They must frequent this place as the filthy state of this place phased them not. Or they were just too hungry to care. 

There was an employee walking about emptying the bins. She was a hot mess, or wreck. Whichever is worse, that is what she was. Of note, when I arrived she was standing right in front of the door smoking. By no means am I an anti-smoker, but you work there!!  Stand aside, go elsewhere, but don't stand right in front of the entrance & drag on your fag. 

Upon leaving, I realized where the awful smell was coming from. The bathrooms.",9BuTUHt6Zlm-UCjaGD6aJQ,1,0,1,6Rj1q4e2F4oWzYl7bRPfOQ

last week while in mesquite i went to a del taco and had their chicken burrito and had an ice tea.  it was excellent

so long taco bell until you get your act together and stop ruining a fine nation-wide product.

They water down their sour cream to the consistency of water.

I would for sure get the beef again the chicken I'm not so sure about and at 3.50 a taco you better know what you wanna do.it's too bad they only have the breakfast stuff until 11am since I'm rarely out of the house before 1. 

As far as this taco being bigger than the base drop - it's falls flat of that but it is a tasty taco.

Bigger than the internet? Now I feel I've been oversold - which saddens me.

Good tacos but not worth 3.50 each. Next time I'll try and barter!",DURSuU5TYOy-7ya77gzb9w,0,0,4,rAw1EK57es8za1sZVTMDHg

I had Chris as our server on 8/17/16 and we went in around 10:15. I got the shredded chicken burrito, cheesy gordita crunch, and my husband got the smothered burrito and fiery gordita crunch and smothered burrito. All the food was what we ordered, was delicious, but what sold us today was the customer service. Chris was very friendly over the speaker and was patient and polite with us as well. Ive had ok service at fast food places but he was so nice and welcoming, I had to write a review. We will be going to this location from now on. Its nice to see people who actually are friendly when they are working with people because I know you probably come across some horrible customers.

Its a solid 50/50 shot everytime I come here that they will mess up SOMETHING with the order. I don't understand. This happens even when its slow and I'm the only guy in the drive thru. It's just not that difficult.

One thing this location also does for me is underscore the fact that the TB on Serene is AWESOME! This location is slightly closer to my house, but after multiple dissappointing visits over the course of the past few months, I have finally gotten to the point where it is well worth my while to drive to the Serene location.

This particular Taco Bell used to be horrible but the remodel jazzed the place up some and breathed new life into it. With it getting unholy hot now this restaurant as usual, was iced cold from the air conditioning so bravo for keeping your employees and customers happy.

I ordered breakfast this morning a grilled breakfast burrito with bacon. I also ordered the potato grilled breakfast burrito too. They were both made fresh and tasted so good. The cashier that took my order was very friendly and welcoming. I was so impressed with the redo of the restaurant it makes it look so modern and beautiful.

4262363,2012-03-01,1,D2EDuQwOHp1OdGUNsFzKMw,"It's pretty difficult to review fast food chain restaurants.  Everyone knows what to expect anyways.  Thus, I think 95% of them would just get a 3 star rating from me.

This location is a bit cleaner than most.  I've never had to do the grab a napkin and do the table wipedown myself.  Sometimes when places get busy the tables go uncleared for a while and you have to wipe them yourself.  This location gets a little busy during lunchtime but they handle it real well.

Additionally there is an employee who works at the register (Chelsea) that is always just super friendly and happy.  She's there most weekdays.

As with most taco bell's the food is prepared really fast.  Sometimes I won't even bother sitting down because I know they'll call my number as soon as I do sit.

edit: I have a new crush.  The original Chelsea isn't there anymore, but there is a new girl also named Chelsea.  She's got pink hair with streaks of blue.  She reminds me of Princess Cadence from My Little Pony.  She's my destiny.",Hv_q_ZnSIoZwdcoH0CyV2Q,0,0,4,r6X-LibAh_hQ6UwD4Mvjaw

The staff is friendly, and I would say mostly (key word: ""mostly"") proficient at their job. The manager saw to it that we were taken care of and on our two visits where our food was not patently awful, it was actually good. So if I'm in the neighborhood, and want a taco, I'll probably stop in.
Actually, I'll go through the drive-through, because the place still smelled like there was a sewer problem after a week, with no sign posted to apologize or indication they were working on it.
