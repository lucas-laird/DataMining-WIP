You get to cook your own food at your own pace, put in whatever veggies and mushrooms you please, and control the spiciness as you desire. The only drawback is they don't have an alcohol license as far as I know, and I like to have sake or beer with my Asian dishes. Still 5 stars though.

1469540,2018-02-24,0,Jyub3kujlSOTgxwr9wEKFQ,"We recently visited Yobo for the 3rd time. I wanted to give this place 5 stars, but I just can't do it. Not yet at least. I think it's just too new, but has good potential. 

Food - 5 stars 
Ramen was a miss for me, but everything else was good. Lamb kiss, cucumber salad, vegetable pancake/pocket, green onion pancake, king noodle dish were all quite good. Shabu shabu is solid. There many good broths to choose from, all the proteins are high quality and includes a bowl abundantly filled with fresh vegetables (about 2.5x as much as Yoji√©). 

Value - 5 stars
For the amount of food you get (especially shabu shabu) and the high quality of food and ingredients. They definitely deserve an A+ rating. 

Service - 3 stars
Hit or miss here. They are still going through new servers here, during our 3 trips we've had 3 different servers. I'd rate our three trips as 5/1/3 stars. On the plus side, the servers here are all pretty nice...many Asian restaurants are full of negative and rude servers. However, a couple of them here are forgetful and don't remember to bring you things you asked for like an extra bowl or spoon.",jGKMAlMNbgonyeZBdqMpEg,0,0,4,LzrOER7vfQKtadWdIGVnpQ

Try the Thai tea- ITS DELICIOUS! I was very impressed with the generous portions, variety of flavors, and the quality. I was really pleased with the miso base. Beware the sukiyaki base was more sweet than anticipated. We have tried this base at many different shabu locations and although it is nothing like real sukiyaki, theirs was exceptionally sweet. We haven't found a decent shabu place in town since Swish closed it's doors, and we are ecstatic to try it again and again.

1599475,2018-04-06,0,Jyub3kujlSOTgxwr9wEKFQ,"In pursuit of hotpot, happy coincidence brought my family to YOBO. Our original destination was closed but this was a more than capable stand in. The individual shabu shabu stations are definitely less of a social event than a communal pot, but they do let everyone try a different broth without having to make a choice for the group.

I had the beef sampler, which comes with a nice assortment of vegetables as well. Chili broth, chili sauce, let the cabbage cook in the broth far longer than it needs to ... delicious. The beef was good quality and cooked lightning fast - the sauces on the side were all a fun way to change flavors.

Service was friendly if a bit slow, and while it wasn't a traditional shabu shabu experience it was delicious regardless. I'd definitely come back next time I'm in Vegas - totally affordable and adorable little spot.",UpWWRCal0KLaaZzec9h_Kg,1,0,4,Fg_U1uSymRmT4vKg2tAnRQ

One section is for customer that dine in for noodle and another section is for customers who are dined in for Shabu Shabu. We tried its noodle, ordered tomato marinated beef noodle soup($6.98) and Rib Rib noodle soup ($6.98). They are both recommended by our server.

1. Tomato marinated beef noodle soup: very strong tomato flavor....and i would say it is less of a soup noodle..more like tomato sauce with noodle is in..the marinated beef pieces were super TINY..and kinda dry and flavorless..

2. Rib Rib noodle soup. the ribs are okay..lack of flavor..but it is soft..the soup base reminded me of wonton noodle from a HK restaurant..

Overall, the noodles are really fresh and tasty..but the soup base and meat are just alright...but the price is really reasonable considering it is in Vegas (off strip)",h949ZwQiQAXD5GR3G5wMCQ,3,1,3,Ros2YoYVOKz_024aM-UzrQ

1701332,2018-03-13,7,Jyub3kujlSOTgxwr9wEKFQ,"One of my resolutions is to stop being such a control freak in 2018. Even though I have a great go-to hot pot spot (say that five times fast), when I friend suggested dinner at Yobo, I kept my mouth shut and met her where  she wanted. And I was pleasantly surprised!

Placed in a packed plaza, Yobo had solid business even during early evening hours with separate dining areas for the shabu shabu counter and a dining room for their noodle dishes. Menu is easy to follow with step-by-step directions for broth, sauce, entreee, and add-ons, along with a small apps menu. Staff were helpful about making suggestions.

Shared a pot, some apps, and dessert with a friend, and for around $30 total we both left satisfied. Got the Yobo tomato-beef bone broth with the beef sampler plate (ribeye, chuck, and brisket), with ponzu (citrus), goma (sesame), and sasha (traditional) dips. Order included a dish of veggies, noodles, and rice. While waiting for our pot to heat up, we got the spicy calamari and edamame. 

The broth could have a bit more developed flavor but was solid. The meats portion does not specify a weight but seemed okay portion-wise, but I could not taste a distinct difference between the meats and found it odd the server also did not seem entirely clear which was which. Veggies and sauces were fresh and added flavor. Apps were about average. Snagged some mochi for dessert and was surprised to see each order in pairs, with fresh fruit inside, seemed to be better quality than usual. We were pretty pleased overall with the meal. Interested to revisit and check out their noodle dishes, but with so many other options in the Spring Mountain corridor, it may be a while til I make it back.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,20,13,4,lL1GEFV6MYVX002QxqLxyA

We decided to get shabu shabu, but our waiter provided no explanations to the menu which would have been extremely helpful in making decisions. My cousin and I ended up ordering the sukiyaki and beef tomato broth, both of which were pleasant in taste. I accompanied my meats with a sesame and shacha sauce which heightened the taste of the meat.

2006077,2018-03-10,0,Jyub3kujlSOTgxwr9wEKFQ,"Went here with my family a few weeks ago. The restaurant is divided into 2 main areas. Half of it is for regular table dining and the other half is for shabu shabu. My family and I opted for the latter. 

The menu shows you how to order with steps 1-4. 
Step 1: You choose your broth. I decided to go for the spicy miso. I loved this broth. It has the right amount of spice and the flavors were just right! 

Step 2: you choose 2 dipping sauces. I went with ponzu and goma. I liked the ponzu way more than the goma sauce. Ponzu had a strong lemon flavor which I liked. Goma tasted more on the bland side. 

Step 3: Choose a main entree. So there was a miscommunication with us and the waitress here. My dad got the large order of the beef sampler and I was going to share it with him since I wasn't super hungry that night. Waitress informed us that we cannot share entrees which I thought was odd (I can understand from a business standpoint though). To make a long story short, EVERYONE needs to order an entree. You can share the entrees as long as EVERYBODY orders one, but you can't order just the soup base and share 1 entree btwn your group/date/significant other. 

Step 4: Add on/extra. I didn't add anything extra since we had plenty of food already. 

So would I come back? Yes I would. I did enjoy the broth and I feel like you get a huge amount of food for the price you pay. I do think the staff needs a bit more training because service was kind of sl",60skTN6p8SdQ2sGNKL0vRQ,0,0,4,Issq-_kj5GDKibtcqO3WDQ
2075083,2018-02-12,0,Jyub3kujlSOTgxwr9wEKFQ,It was just ok. Not sure if I'll give them another shot or not. I had the shabu shabu with rib-eye and added a side of salmon. Good amount of rib eye. However I had to do extra add on for veggies as two mushrooms is not much and neither was the amount of cabbage given.The napa cabbage was cut oddly and did not cook right and they gave more of the hard stem instead of the leafy pieces. Shall bowl of rice given. The shiritaki noodles side to be added were in little piles of knots and I had to take the knot out or else it wouldn't cook right. The salmon was good but they only give you six tiny pieces. The Sesame goma  sauce was way too watery and didn't have a lot of flavor even with garlic added to it. Not even close to being as good as the restaurant Swish that was previously there for years. I'm gonna have to re think before trying them again.,Bhni6QoCIQ3Kaxfcpcxlmw,1,1,3,FhuSgeolN9esVfSSMm4Z0A

2367764,2018-03-18,0,Jyub3kujlSOTgxwr9wEKFQ,"Hot pot: the broths were very good. Sukiyaki and Yobo spicy broth. Sukiyaki is not overly sweet, which I liked.  Wife thought her Yobo broth was slightly sour. 

The servers are very kind, but the service is still a bit lacking.  You have to ask for utensils, chili oil or spices. Also, the choice of bowls/plates makes the food less convenient to eat. 

Advice to owner, maybe dim the lights a little bit. Decor looms expensive, but would create atmosphere if it were slightly darker. 

Big frustration: $23 For 8 oz of salmon, but they gave a ridiculously tiny portion. (8slices of sashimi) When i asked, they told me it was a full order. I politely disagreed and my server brought the plate back to the kitchen. 10 mins later, management finally decided that more salmon was the right answer. They brought me a full order, plus the original small plate. 

The wife's lamb was tasty but extremely fatty. Protein quality seems lower cost/quality to me. 

Warning: the dipping egg is NOT pasteurized, as it is in other shabu or hotpot joints. I chose to cook mine in the broth.

2619343,2018-03-21,7,Jyub3kujlSOTgxwr9wEKFQ,"YOBO took over the former Swish Shabu Shabu on Spring Mountain but I sure do miss Swish. The new owners did a complete remodel and I can't even recognize it anymore. This restaurant is now 2 restaurants in one: Shabu Shabu Bar & Fresh Noodle Bar.

Like many handmade noodle shops in Vegas, they include a glass window so that you can peer into the kitchen and watch the chefs twirl and roll out handmade noodles. We didn't get to try the noodle side yet.

This restaurant is Chinese with a touch of Japanese influence. So If you are looking for traditional Japanese shabu shabu, this is not the place to be. However, they do offer a variety of classic Japanese style broths like sukiyaki and miso. They also offer the traditional Chinese version of spicy hot pot.

I went for the sukiyaki and my husband got the miso broth. I had no complaints with my broth but my husband's broth went from tasting like a watered down miso soup to a salt bomb towards the end of the meal. The broth boiled down and made it very concentrated. I wouldn't suggest getting the miso broth. The lady next to me got a spicy broth and I kept overhearing her say to her husband that it was really hard to eat since it was too spicy.

The best part of our meal is that they don't skimp on the veggies, the bowl was overflowing with napa cabbage, enoki mushrooms, onion, tofu and udon noodles. I was curious as to why their udon didn't taste fresh or handmade from their noodle bar side. Maybe they did make it in house but stored it away in the freezer or refrigerator. 

I wasn't impressed with their sliced meat, it was cut paper thin and didn't taste quality. Also the goma and ponzu sauce were crazy skimpy. I had to ask for a sauce refill several times and I didn't even eat yet! I miss Swish for these reasons. Swish use to hook it up with their generous portioned slice meat and their sauce was really tasty.",u_wqt9RshdZsoj8ikLqoEQ,13,11,3,gFOt0QrTvK1-aiVh1uCnRQ
2647825,2018-05-16,0,Jyub3kujlSOTgxwr9wEKFQ,"My mom and I came in for lunch and we were craving ""hot pot"" but wanted to try a place we haven't been to yet. There was only two other people in the restaurant so it was definitely dead. Service was okay, one of the waiters spoke way too quietly even though the music was very loud. My mom ordered the Sukiyaki broth with the Beef Sampler (regular size) and I ordered the YOBOHOT Spicy Soup with the Vegetable Party. We did not notice that we didn't receive our rice with our food until we were about to start eating. The waiter seemed confused when we asked for rice (even though the menu states that it comes with rice). 

I love spicy food, so I was excited to see what YOBO's ""spicy"" was going to be. I was disappointed, though, because it lacked depth of flavor and wasn't at all spicy (I may have a strong tolerance for spicy, but this simply did not taste spicy at all). My mom liked the portion size for her meat but said her broth was more salty than sweet when it's supposed to be a balance between the two. Big problem we noticed as soon as we started to put our food into our pots was that there wasn't enough broth. For me especially since I was eating only vegetables, I felt like I needed more broth to efficiently cook all of my vegetables. What I ended up doing was only putting in a handful of vegetables at a time so that they could evenly cook and cook quicker compared to having just dumped it all in my pot and having everything unevenly cooked. I also was not offered more broth until I asked if I could take home my leftovers (at that point my udon noodles were stuck to the bottom and breaking apart into tiny pieces). I was sorely disappointed with the amount of udon noodles offered; in my experience, I have always received a full serving, not an extremely frozen block of udon cut in half. 

We did not like that we could only pick two sauces. We're from Hawaii where there are tons of hot pot/shabu shabu places and we are used to being able to walk up to a stand containing a crap ton of sauces that customers are able to mix and match in little bowls that they then bring back to their tables and are able to go back and get more if so desired. Here, there were 5 to choose from, so having to only pick two can be difficult, especially for those who are unfamiliar with sauces typically served at hot pot/shabu shabu restaurants and want to try them all.

Biggest plus here is cost. We only paid about $25 for lunch. We didn't get any drinks (other than water which was served in take-out plastic cups with lids - odd) nor did we get any desserts. 

Also, this might be good or bad, depending on who you are: they play music that is more popular like EDM (not the hardcore stuff), Ed Sheeran, pop music, etc. My mom and I enjoyed the music so it was no problem to us, but they did play it quite loud which might make some guests uncomfortable. Clearly, though, it is not marketed as a traditional dining kind of place, more upbeat and for a younger crowd. 

We enjoyed YOBO, my mom more than me, but we probably won't look at YOBO as the first place to go to for a hot pot/shabu shabu restaurant.",Jc-bW5Mzktn0o65r3-I1aw,2,0,3,5ZWxAaPuFp1FP8jrMYq8UA
2686718,2018-02-19,1,Jyub3kujlSOTgxwr9wEKFQ,"I hope the owner reads this email in a positive manner and makes changes. This meal should have been right up my alley but on a road (Spring Mountain) where there is so much excellence YOBO currently falls short.

Dashi broth basically taster like water and the sauces were basically lackluster and flavorless. While serving sizes were sizable flavors and seasoning just wasn't there.

We had both the Lamb Kiss and Lamb Meat sandwich. Fried dish was to oily and sandwich had way to much (Curry?).

We ordered the shrimp tempura because the Fried Soft shell crab was so good. Problem is the shrimp tempura was terrible. Tiny skrimpy little shrimp in an overly oily batter.

Multiple items ordered for the Shabu Shabu came 10-15 minutes after the main ingredients but even if they came on time it still lacked flavor.

his place will blow up if they address these isues but die if they do not. I hope they sit down eat their own food and address what many are saying.

The service was better but still needs to be worked on as the servers kept mixing up our orders and sauces. The meat was clearly way fresher than last time. They really have stepped their game up as this time when I went there were lots more people and the broth didn't taste watered down. If they can keep this up I'll have a third Shabu Shabu place to go to. 

For this Shabu Shabu place it's quite a simple way to order.

Step 1: Choose your broth 

Step 2: Choose two dipping sauces

Step 3: Choice of meat (comes in regular or large size)

Step 4: Extra items to add on, such as protein or vegetables",hMwPqwbNQV94fWSBhM4QaQ,4,1,4,Zm_4VqscDd_hNBSonkctEw

2977803,2018-04-16,1,Jyub3kujlSOTgxwr9wEKFQ,"We were craving for ramen and wanted to check this place out. Upon entering, we waited a bit to be greeted by someone. The entry way consisted of relaxing decor which included plants, small water fountain, and a picture of someone sipping off of the YOBO bowl (neat!). The decor was modern industrial.

Our waitress - she was sweet and nice but didn't know the menu. She didn't sound too confident on what she was saying. We told her we were there for the ramen, not shabu shabu so she directed us to the ""ramen"" tables. Right before we were seated we told her we needed a high-chair. She gave us the menu - 4 shabu shabu menu and just one ramen menu which looked like two pieces of paper stapled. Oh and Take note, we were there for the ramen. And then we asked for the high-chair again. She forgot. Which was fine. 1ST STRIKE. 

2ND STRIKE-my husband asked her a few questions about their menu that she couldn't answer. She kept saying she will ask the people in the back. 

FOOD - we all ordered tonkatsu ramen and a variety of difference toppings, which by the way, you have to pay extra for. The tonkatsu bowl only comes with 3 slices of chasu and onions. The ramen to soup ratio was off. We had more ramen than soup. Soup was a little bland but the noodles, you can taste off the bat that they're fresh. We also ordered gyoza and the sauce that it came in was good! Btw, I don't think their water is filtered.

SERVICE - 3RD AND 4TH STRIKE...(unfortunately, there is also a 4th one). 3rd was, the waitress forgot to ask the people in the back about what my husband asked her which was if they had any chasu bowls. 4th, after finishing up, I asked for the check. My family and I were in the midst of talking after receiving the check so our payment wasn't ready. Our waitress came back after a few minutes stood there and asked for it. It felt a bit awkward. It wasn't busy at all. And by her asking for the payment, i found it a bit rude. (Girl, you kicking us out?! Lol.)

She did apologize to us multiple times because ""she's new."" And she did also ask if we had any suggestions to better anything. Which is great! But it would have been a better experience if our waitress was knowledgeable of  what she's selling from the beginning. I may be back for the shabu-shabu though.

I like the ponzu and Chinese sauce available. My friend tried the spicy dipping sauce and it was really spicy! And he can generally take the heat, but this caused him to stop in his tracks.

Prices, you can't find a better deal for shabu which generally is about $20+, whole Yobo is $15 for a medium size meat platter. The extra toppings are about $3, but you definitely get $3 worth!

3405398,2018-04-07,9,Jyub3kujlSOTgxwr9wEKFQ,"Where do I begin? 
I think i'll start with the food first. Oh my shabuuu! I am so thankful to finally find a place that has the best sukiyaki broth in Las Vegas. I usually go to the Swish on Sahara for it but the prices were pretty high (i believe it was unlimited tho). Not sure. But Yobo, i believe used to be another Swish location. I did not enjoy that location back then due to their broth being very bland and watery. I'm not sure if the owner of Swish and Yobo is the same. If it is, great job on fixing the broths. I'm a huge fan of sweet broth! Pair it with their brisket and a bunch of veggies. You'll be good to go! Oh, don't forget to order the rice. You also get to choose two sauces for your main entree. I personally chose the Goma and Ponzu Sauce. Goma or however you spell it was not the greatest. It was bitter to me with a hit of sesame taste at the end (it is made of sesame;suppose to be sweet tho?) I did however enjoy Ponzu Sauce. It had a salty/citrusy taste to it. 
If you also want, you can order sides. Their gyoza was perfect along with their calamari. Dip those in the ponzu sauce and you'll be satisfied. Although i wasn't a big fan of their garlic chicken. 

Now about the service. 
They were short staff that day. They did mess up on our orders, which was fine. It happens in the server industry. It wasn't a big deal. Just politely notified the server we were missing a few of our dishes and sauces weren't right. They took care of it immediately and apologized. They were all very attentive. Refilled waters here and there and checked up on us. 

All in all, i'm definitely coming back. Writing this review got me craving it again.",hPoyOGAnbjJ6IKbJQ1UABQ,21,12,5,Fu8DtvKzUp7R_JRVmSGRWg
3406679,2018-04-29,0,Jyub3kujlSOTgxwr9wEKFQ,"I've been to this place before and enjoyed the experience. Last night was an exception. 

The meat that came out was all fat. That's not exaggerated at all. It was all fat. 
I spoke to the waiter who apologized and then brought out more meat. This meat was better. 

Then, I noticed the udon. The udon with the broth at the end of the meal is the best part of shabu for me. Yobo served just scraps of freezer-burned udon. Not even enough for a bowl. I asked if this was the correct amount that comes with an order and the waiter stated that it was.  
That's bull of course. You can look at the pictures on yelp and my udon order was half that. Not just freezer burnt scraps which were served to us. 
Also, looking through the pictures I noticed that we were served less cabbage and tofu then the pictures posted lead you to believe comes with an order. 

I will add that we did not come in for lunch. We paid full price and arrived at 8:30 to a mostly dead restaurant. 

I love shabu. Eat it all the time in Cali, Vegas, and I even have it at home on an induction cooker.  
This was the worst experience I ever had at a Shabu restaurant. And the only reason for the extra star was because I've had good experiences there before, and the broth was fantastic as always. 

I will not be back to this restaurant and will drive farther to other Shabu spots for better experiences. 

One final thing, if the lack of vegetables, fatty meat, and lack of udon was because their business is struggling, then I feel sympathy. Maybe though, if the food was consistent, then you would not be in this predicament.

Update 6/17/18
After eating here again last night I felt the need to come back and add something. It's super disappointing to read people's negative reviews on this place. Every time I come here the service is impeccable and the food is delicious. With that being said I notice that there are people in attendance who have never eaten shabu/hot pot before. DO YOURSELF A FAVOR and research a little bit before you come here and decide to rely on the staff to explain everything to you and give you the recommendations you are asking for. This isn't food for the reliant. If you lack basic cooking skills, don't come here. As an adult, if you don't know how long you should cook broccoli and you can't tell if your chicken is raw or not, this isn't for you. Just stick to eating your cup of noodles at home or go to a regular restaurant where your food is prepared for you. This is an experience, a place that isn't your kitchen but you get to customize and cook your own dish. No one has time to sit and hold your hand. 

If you really want to try shabu (which you should) go online and read about it and make sure you understand how boiling water and basic cooking works. Try bringing a friend who has gone before. Don't rely on the staff to pick and chose for you. 

And as a reminder, you are coming to an Asian restaurant and legit Asian people work there. There can be a language barrier. You are here to experience their culture and their food. Have some patience.",-PhbXQGlSGdPb0cqGJTysA,0,0,4,xNsF6ym6dhbJ-0bHOYe4BQ

I ordered the prime rib beef platter and my boyfriend got the beef sampler platter. I chose the tomato beef broth and my boyfriend got the sukiyaki. Both broths were good and flavorful. Sukiyaki was sweet almost like teriyaki and my was tart sweet and savory. No complaints with broth. 

The veggies that came with it were awesome as well. I loved the spinach and cabbage and tofu. They paired well with the Goma sauce, which was delicious.   Don't bother ordering the YOBO special spicy sauce. It's like regular hot sauce and there is already hot sauce on the table.  

My prime rib was sliced nicely but the meat took a long time to come. Way after my veggies so I just was eating rice and vegetables for a while. That puzzled me because I thought all they had to do was cut it but maybe that takes a while. Also there was a piece of bone in almost every piece of meat that I had to spit out.   I bit on it a couple times.

5159637,2018-06-14,3,Jyub3kujlSOTgxwr9wEKFQ,"This place was a nightmare bc of the service... I'm going to be honest right then and there.

Came here on a Sunday afternoon and there wasn't a wait. Also, I'm confused on why there is some kind of shabu shabu/ramen thing going on but when I asked the waitress she has no idea what kind of ramen or noodles that they have here....?

Sat down and got to ordering. I ordered the rib eye with the spicy miso broth, with goma and sha cha sauce. The waitress was not helpful at all in recommendations. I asked her which meat is popular and she did not know the answer...

Okay first of all, why is everyone given sesame seeds and a grinder if not everyone gets goma sauce? I think this is a little wasteful but I don't know if the place just has other uses for it. The goma sauce they give you also comes with plenty of sesame seeds in it already, so it just seems a little redundant. I did not enjoy the sesame sauce since it tasted way too sweet and had a weird consistency. I blended it with a bunch of the sha cha sauce to make it a little salvageable.

 The food takes a WHILE to come out. Even the broth itself took a long time to come out, when usually that should come out so it starts to get heated. Everything needed had to be asked for - they didn't have the green onions and garlic already on the table, which should already be there. When the food comes, I noticed I had the really cheap prepackaged udon noodles while everyone else had normal udon noodles..? Weird, but I didn't mention it. The food is actually pretty decent, I do wish the meat had thinner cuts though but it's all okay.

Now for the service... I don't even know where to start here. The waitress was completely lost. We would say excuse me and she looked around as if there wasn't a circle of her customers around her (it was a bar setup). My friend asked for more broth since her soup evaporated for the most part, and the girl says that they don't have broth and comes out with a bottle of water... WATER.... She fills her soup up with water and walks away. Tell me why later, the other waiter comes out with a whole kettle pot of soup broth? She was also very awkward in attempting to create conversation.. She asked if the soup was good at first before the water...?? She dropped the broccoli off of my friend's vegetable bowl, and picked it up with her hands and put it back on my friend's plate. When my friend asked why she did that, she said ""You're going to cook it anyway haha."" UHHHHH...NO.

This service needs major improvements and I wish I knew her name but this is just not going to fly for me, and I have never experienced anything like this. I suggest just not coming here. The only reason I even give it a 2 star is because the food is decent for Las Vegas shabu.",JSyGk0fedJYmF4TTQsfIbw,2,2,2,PNv6gB3gHtuOdD00HcmEug

I called her a few times but she seems to ignore me. Not sure if it was on purpose or she was not pay attention. The food was okay but it's a little pricey. At the end, this is where she really pissed us off. She gave us the wrong check and didn't even apologize. Well, we were disappointed by the service.",wL9IAuNN1OczqJIRIhT_rA,0,0,2,IKtS61rewJ6a1fujx-LY-g

She needs a proper training about service. She needs to see in customers' point of view because I know she'd be upset and irritated too and not ever come back if she experienced what I experienced today. 
A server with short hair was good. She knew what she was doing and she made sure all table were well taken care of.",7TAs5KhvHZYC7grJ8a6xZw,0,0,3,_7k-JCNUf3PeHHQRzTdkOQ

When we first entered it was kind of slow.. but as we were finishing up our meal the restaurant got more crowded. We didn't want to be bother the waiters since people kept coming. Anyways food was good. We got the miso broth and the sukiyaki broth. The broth was so good that we didn't need the dipping sauce. We had the meat sampler and a side of the Australian wagyu. You have to get the Australian wagyu it was delicious! We also got the dumping and spicy fried chicken dish. Over all it was good but staff seemed like they were under staffed?

5602760,2018-04-15,0,Jyub3kujlSOTgxwr9wEKFQ,"Located where the old ""swish"" used to be.. still keeping it somewhat the same with serving shabu shabu... and they also added some ramen in the menu.. so that's cool..

Walking in.. host seemed or looked to be little confused.. like I wanted to ask her.. are you guys open or not because by the confused look you're giving me I'm not even sure if we're suppose to be in here lol.. 

Anyways.. she asked if we wanted shabu shabu.. and I said no.. we will just have ramen today.. so she pointed us to what i assumed to be the ""ramen"" side or the non shabu shabu side to be seated..

Furniture and decor was very nice with wooden tables also with some wooden slab walls and a bench style seating on the wall side and a couple booth style seating in the middle of the restaurant.. there's more seating on the other side but I couldn't tell if it's just normal seating or the shabu shabu style table where there's a person in the middle.. 

Music playing wasn't too loud nor was it too soft for me.. and the choice of music seemed to be a set of your typical top 40.. 

The host that sat us down was also our waitress.. she started us off with some water in plastic cups with plastic lids.. then she gave us 4 menus of shabu shabu plate choices and on the back is a beverage menu.. with 1 ramen menu that seemed like a 2 year old put together.. (piece of paper on a cardboard stapled on) 

Waitress comes back after a few minutes and asked us if this was our first time.. and I replied.. yes, first time at this place.. she then started explaining what shabu shabu was as if she was confused about our reply to as our first time here... I then replied saying we know what shabu shabu was that's why we chose ramen... 

Our waters came out.. definitely unfiltered.. :(

Ramen came out.. noodles tasted fresh.. but I felt like the noodle : broth ratio was off.. as all four of our orders had more noodles than broth in each bowl.. good for those who like more noodles /:

Service was fine.. but the confusion with the hostess/waitress and the fact that it came off as she was new to the industry.. maybe even new to the food itself because she didn't know what cha-siu was... /: 

Won't return for ramen... because the ramen comes basic and you'll need to add toppings (add money) to make it just the way you want it... or how normal other ramen spots serve... 

Good luck and I hope this place works out.. I'll try the shabu shabu when the time comes..",A0Sy2srGc-AhXEuFoErDkw,1,0,2,CV7tjfV_Mi7HIsBu2zaLqg

5679733,2018-03-18,0,Jyub3kujlSOTgxwr9wEKFQ,"Not bad....you pick your broth, pick 2 sauces and pick your meat--comes with veggies and rice. You can order extra things if you want. We decided to do sukiyaki and the raw egg of course. We had the assorted meats and shared a pork. It was a lot to eat. You could do a large or a regular size. It was me and my daughter and the regular size was more than enough-we felt like you had to roll us out of there. I did ask for the garlic-green onion-hot chili oil sauce dish...and that wasn't easy-slight language barrier. Service was great on the front end. They didn't check on us at all during our meal. I did like that we could control the heat of our own burner. And when you turn your burner off...it turns completely off-it didn't even seem like it needed to cool off, your broth goes from a raging boil to nothing. It was good. They need some ladles or something to round up some of the veggies in the pot, or the noodles. But we enjoyed it and will be back.",IPlLcdNG426qOopHH4EwkQ,0,0,4,BOm5xsLJOglB4GUlj5d-Ow

You can choose from a variety of noodles such as knife cut, yobo style. I appreciate that their kitchen is fully visible through their modern glass panoramic windows; you can see the chefs working on freshly handmade noodles. So when I came back for more on my second visit, I tried the shabu shabu and everything was also very fresh and delicious! Their ingredients such as the meat and toppings were excellent in quality and I loveeed the broth! I tried their appetizers as well and everything overall tasted IMPRESSIVE.
