For a morning I'm usually used to McDonald's being unnecessarily busy, whether it's the drive through or in-store. I guess since this one is located in the Walmart it's not frequented as much as the other ones in town. I walked in and was able to order immediately.

I've been to countless McDonalds' where they pre-cook the sausage burritos and let them sit for hours, then the tortilla gets hard and it's just not enjoyable. Here, I forgot to ask them not to, but was VERY happy when we got the burritos and they were hot and fresh with soft tortillas. Everything else was pretty standard. I had a sausage egg & cheese mcmuffin that was surprisingly well assembled (but I'm sure this can vary by cook instead of store location) and a coffee that was made how I like it.

Everyone here was friendly and the dining area was spotless. There isn't much more you could ask for in a McDonalds.",zmiovtxmVIieqG7_AKzLvw,1,0,5,-pvXb4sYFOVgUE911j5rgA

2583617,2017-01-15,0,ZzERMgdUTkAeFKZFDwPh-A,"I don't know if this is the right one but I'm talking of the McDonald's in Walmart. I stopped in one day and there was a very rude customer yelling at the man behind the counter. The man was calm and professional and the woman was irrational and very angry over something she ordered and didn't specify, I was witness. The man behind the counters name was Steven I believe. He was obviously bothered by such the rude guest but he still managed to smile and take my order and even politely have a conversation with me and he's gotta be one of the most patient cashiers I've ever seen. He is an amazing person and needs to be told this by management or at least a supervisor because many cashiers I've seen roll their eyes or give attitude. This kid was amazing. Sorry I just had to do a good deed cause I saw how shitty that person treated him and it was wrong.",dMJe7vcCe3mDZnW6iet4qg,0,1,5,Y6vliM5HvVKdy4SNI1bcqA
2878135,2013-02-24,3,ZzERMgdUTkAeFKZFDwPh-A,"My very first review on a McDonalds!! :-D The food here is what you expect from a fast food place so my review really isn't going to focus on that. I can go out on limb and assume most people ate at a McDonalds before....if they didn't well, most likely they won't be reading my review ;-) So with this said....I love coming to this location for multiple reasons and every reason has to do with the customer service :-) If I am going to a fast food place it's mainly because I need to get a fast bite and I need a drive thru because getting cuteness in and out without a hassle is near next to impossible ( toddlers are awesome ;-)  So my experience is solely based on the people at the drive thru. Everytime I drive thru and I have either my little girl or my big dog the workers are super friendly to them :-) Everytime I have my dog with me they have a treat for her. I just love this! They always have a little conversation with my little girl which just makes me smile :-) Any person that likes my little girl and my big ole dog is cool with me ;-) And any business that goes that extra step to make my babies happy will have my total loyality :-)",Bj_MarPEKBe2xN12YimekQ,1,4,4,QCcW6WwpXwnB4wF-iUH7IA

I purchased a feed the whole family meal that comes with 20 piece chicken McNugget, two big Macs sandwiches, two medium fries. The guy only would allow me to have three sweet-and-sour sauces and charged me $.25 a piece for extras. I have never in my life been told I can only have 3 with a 20 piece nugget. I recommend driving down to Tenya and Craig where the people are very polite and courteous",eiW_IAgr9a3YLxzEoqhyrw,0,0,1,HEXcDYj2W4hFY1jE9LSKNg
