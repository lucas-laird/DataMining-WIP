The smoking in the club should be a big hell no cause that turned our group of 11 away. The DJ was cool but too many slow songs. I was try it again on a Friday or saturday night!,cpGCsFHaZzsn2o03uwbA8w,2,0,3,1dqGE6xNCpx3Oli7rMCIKg

-1 star because it's a bit off the strip. It's not too bad though, about a $10 cab ride to the strip.",AbLTqFGxpsk6EmWpCW2ypQ,5,0,4,P2zVJMKjAnZQ9sd6FRhKBw

But im from la so were so not used to it, Arrived at this place after midnight on a Saturday night it was popping! Good hip hop playing but the Spanish never came!!! Well it did but until 2am??? Why!!!!!! It would have been awesome a little sooner not only that the person that performed on stage live couldn't rap or sing! Not appealing to look at or hear just wasted a good 45 mins of dancing time all and all drinks were good well priced big dance floor.",JzUo8PEap0Up0SfDDmSNVg,5,0,4,0o18L62zIEtEDhNOG9tE6Q

Tried to send us to La Jolla Tavern and only 6 people were there. A waste of a Friday night!,rAHO5F7WCCiMP39wMg-wqQ,0,0,1,FGtWFuT3JZJFC02p6c54wA

I'm kind of a two-drink max type of girl.  No tolerance for alcohol really, and after four margaritas I wasn't even feeling it.  Stiff pricing on weak drinks.  No matter though, I will come again.  I just won't be spending my money at the bar!",I4pJCk_6BRXlE9yLDhQovg,3,0,3,WErbw-vXorgmIZerInTuqw

I am now a HUGE fan of this place. Went on a Saturday night, this place gets crackin around 11:30, but get there early so that you can get a nice-FREE- table to sit at. It is a very spacious area. They even have a stage for live bands. The dance floor is decent but if I had to complain it would be that the dance floor itself had some cracks and holes in it, which is not good when you have 3 to 4 inch heels ;b

The music played: Reggaton, salsa, cumbia, merengue, bachata, old school, new school, YOU name it. The crowd is mixed- older to young. The drinks are not that expensive. Sunday nights is BANDA- yeahhhhhh buddy!!",3hWJxx8-gMutgaKY2T7IKQ,14,3,4,vQxn9Z7wuSkvsV2PBNRH1Q
5913297,2013-10-20,0,VXWCXy_wYgg5sbcz0kx_Qw,The music is a variety the drinks are mostly juice. I orders two cranberry and vodka at $7 each and they where both watered down w little vodka. Also we ordered buckets of beer but every time we stood up to dance the staff would clear the tables even with beer still in the bottles. We literally could not leave our table without bottles jacked!,E0RnU2Z6qxPLjgrpuFrw8g,3,1,2,5Nom9Xr9iulhHMDL7ATzOQ
