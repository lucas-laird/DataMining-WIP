261643,2012-02-09,0,Zmfq3DVhHdtVChhSxzoUHw,"It's not too often I'm in this area of town, but when my nerdy husband wanted to make a stop at Maximum Comics one night I figured it was a good time to try a new restaurant.  So we made the stop at Panna Thai for dinner.

The interior is beautiful and would make a great date spot.  Great art on the walls, comfortable seating, an overall lovely atmosphere for enjoying your dinner.

I started with the veggie soup after being told that it was ok for vegetarians.  It was good- a light soup full of veggies- but I have the sinking suspicion that it wasn't veg-friendly.  Well, on to the next...

We had the summer rolls as an appetizer and I really enjoyed them.  Lots of veggies packed into the roll and the peanut sauce helped round the out the dish.  This might have been my favorite thing we ordered.

For our dinner, we ordered yellow curry tofu, tofu basil noodles, and the asparagus with shitake mushrooms.  The yellow curry was good but a little bland and really only consisted of giant chunks of tofu with a few potatoes.  I still enjoyed it- I just thought it could have used a little more oomph.  

We asked our waitress which noodle dish she recommended and she suggested the basil noodles.  This dish was really good and I'm a big fan of Thai basil.  However, I think it could be a great dish if there were more noodles to match the amount of tofu and veggies.  

I'm not quite sure what I was thinking ordering the asparagus since I'm not too fond of shitake mushrooms...  I guess I was just assuming there wouldn't be a lot of them on the plate.  Well there were a lot but I did my best to be a big girl and eat them.  The asparagus and mushrooms were fresh and this dish had a lot of flavor, but it was another thing I had that left me questioning if it was vegetarian or not.

Overall, I think this is a nice spot for dinner.  The atmosphere was great and our waitress was very attentive and friendly.  Some of the dishes needed a little love (and please more rice!) but I still enjoyed my time here.  I don't think I'd make the trip from North Las Vegas just for the restaurant, but if I were in the area would come back again.

Heads up to vegetarians, they say they can leave the fish sauce out of what you order (whether you believe a restaurant or not is up to you).

The only reason I decided to eat here was because I received a special coupon from Restaurant.com -- it was not a coupon I purchased but a promotion Walgreens was running and I got a $25.00 gift certificate. During my lunch break, I met my boyfriend here and immediately saw an unprofessional sign which said they are no longer accepting the Restaurant.com coupon. I was instantly disappointed and I spoke to the waittress and said I had no idea it was no longer accepted and no where on the certificate does it say management may refuse to accept. Her manager cut in and told me she was no longer accepting the coupon. I said I didn't realize that but is there anything you can honor? She replied in a snooty attitude that she can't accept the coupon and it is not her fault and I can receive my money back from Restaurant.com. I told her I didn't purchase the coupon and so there's no money to be redeemed except for at this restaurant. I asked for her manager and she said the owner was not working today and I asked for his card so I can email him and she said she wasn't allowed to give out his contact information. I asked when he would be in so I can ask him about the coupon and she said he doesn't come in everyday and she has no idea when he'll be here. Throughout the whole time she was be very rude and pointing in my face and I told her that because of her lack of resourcefulness and inability to be polite, I could not eat here so she right away told me she can give me a coupon for $15 and I decided to take it and order some food.

Little salty but I like salty, plus the sweet chili sauce with it was yum. 

For dinner we had the Pad See Ew, Green Curry, and the Asparagus vegetable stir fry with Tofu. All 3 were amazing, especially the asparagus and tofu, it had shitake mushrooms in a brown sauce, that was just a great combo. 

Now Pad See Ew and Green Curry are a staple for me when I eat Thai, so I can use them to compare other places and I have to say this is one of the best places in town. Beats Archies hands down for sure. Proportions were big leaving plenty of left overs. 

To top it off it was really nice inside the place. Subtle lighting with dark woods and stone work, make for an excellent atmosphere. Could definitely bring a date here to impress at a cheap price.",x16Fl_5h9aX4tn38kKSGHw,1,1,5,lS_sRRDLXSPILvtZKVW3mg

I'm not a vegetarian or anything, but after eating In-N-Out all week, I decided to eat a ""healthy"" meal. So I ordered broccoli mushroom with tofu. That could be why my food took a long time. I found it odd since most places try to serve a group's meal within a few minutes of each other.

Papaya salad - spice level 4 but papaya was really soggy with the sauce and wasn't sliced the authentic way, which really changes the texture.

After much consideration, and a coin flip, we decided on coming to Panna Thai for dinner last night.  The interior was clean and inviting.  I loved the giant golden elephant paintings on the wall and their Christmas tree made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside.  

The service was fine as well.  The food is what deems Panna a 2 star joint.  We ordered the fried calamari and the pad thai with tofu.

Fried Calamari - Large rings of calamari were a bit tough and quite dry.  The breading had an interesting flavor that wasn't offensive, just not something I was eager to eat.  It was served on a plate of shredded lettuce, but much of the breading fell off, creating a swamp like pile of dusty breading, very unpleasing to the eye.

Pad Thai w/ tofu - The Pad Thai here uses a tamarind sauce, which tasted like Gochujang (Korean red pepper paste) and not much else.  This was like boiling spaghetti noodles, adding ketchup and calling it Italian.  The sauce was heavy, and slumped on my palate long after dinner.

Panna falls short of being good Americanized Thai food.  I prefer the authentic flavors found at other restaurants (where's the kaffir lime leaves, fish sauce, galanga, etc...??)

Delivery took a bit of time but I assume that as average for southwest area. Around 30-40 minutes. But when they arrived super nice and food was nicely packed and hot.

Beef and basil was very flavorful and that was my favorite out of all three. 

Pad Thai was decent, it was good but wish it had better noodles or maybe a richer sauce. But it's by no means bad at all.

Yellow curry I have had better and wish that it was less watery a bit more flavor lacked a lot of spice and the curry wasn't very thick.

Always order my favorite:

Chicken Satay $7.95
- These are HUGE. Feels like you almost get a full chicken breast with every piece and the peanut sauce is good!

Crab Wonton $5.95
- Not something I always order when out eating thai but I did here and they were cooked perfectly. I know they are fairly easy to make but I think everyone's had some pretty horribly cooked (burned, no filling, ect.. I know you're thinking of those bad one's right now) CW's and these are not the case here.

Pad Thai $8.50
- 5 spice & tastes like 5 spice. Comes with sprouts, carrot shreds, lime & peanuts on the side for flavoring as desired.

All three of these are plenty of food for two people (this evening it was me -starving & my preggo buddy & there were leftovers!).

The restaurant itself is beautiful. Large in size compared to most others & with a modern decor. I'd say pretty good choice if you're looking to impress someone & not break the bank here. Not to mention service is awesome.

I ordered the Pad Thai with chicken and was craving rice but did not want to order another entree since I wouldn't be able to finish it. A convenient feature they have on their menu is that you can order a single serving of rice which was what I was craving for! I ordered the egg fried rice single serving. My boyfriend ordered the pepper steak. We both ordered the crab rangoon for a appetizer.

The appetizer came out very shortly after we ordered and tasted very fresh. There wasn't a lot of stuffing in the crab rangoons, which didn't bother us since we ordered so much food. The only thing I thought was weird was they didn't ask for the spice level I wanted for my Pad Thai which came out not spicy at all. I would compare it to a 0 spice level from 1-10 scale. I prefer mine to have some spice but it didn't bother me because I could make it as spicy as I wanted.  The pepper steak came out with a generous amount of steak. We couldn't finish everything! We had plenty of left overs to take home!

They took our dirty plates as well as replace each dirty plate with a clean plate after each entree.

The restaurant was very spacious and clean and the host was welcoming. There was only one other table occupied as I came in at a weird ""limbo"" time of about 4pm. I ordered Thai coffee and Basil Noodles with seafood ($13.25) spicy level medium. I gotta say, pregnancy seems to have made me into a wuss when it comes to spicy food. Either that, or subconsciously I was not looking forward to the punishment that is severe heartburn. The portion was extremely generous, I would say enough for two people to share. I had them box up about half of it and had it for dinner little bit later. It may appear pricey to some, but it was an entree big enough to share. My total with tip was a little over $20..so not exactly cheap for one person, but as I said before, the portion and the quality justify the price. They did not skimp on the variety of seafood either. 

Their menu has a tapas section with many appetizing options. I am only giving them a four star because I want to try more of their menu before I decide it is emergerd the best thai food eva!

I've had dining occasions where everything came out perfectly timed and had a flawless experience. I've also had experienced where the boyfriends entree came out before the appetizer. Then his pre dinner soup 5 min later then the appetizer 5 min later. THEN 10 min later MY entree showed up and my boyfriend was already done eating. They gave a 10% discount off the whole bill which was a nice recovery. She was also extremely apologetic which helped.

Came in with a party of four on a Friday around 5:30. Place was full I open tables. We ordered bang bang shrimp and spring rolls as appetizers. My fellow dinner mates said the shrimp was on point and the summer rolls were fresh. We also had the wonton soup and tom kha with chicken. I do not eat meat but I tasted both broths and they were so so so YUMMYYY..tangy and lemony. As an entree I had the green curry with tofu, which I asked for ""spicy."" Seriously, they are not playing here, the curry definitely was spicy. My one complaint about the curry is that it was really lacking in the liquid department, which made it more like a tofu entree than a curry for me...still delicious though.

Our few experiences at the restaurant have been pleasant. We've never had to wait for seating. The service is always prompt. We've had the same waitress during each visit and she always has a smile on her face.

We've come to like their Chicken Pad See-Ew with Chinese broccoli and their Beef Satay dinner. It's more than enough for the two of us. The satay is always tender and well seasoned and the fried rice that accompanies it is quite flavorful. The Pad See-Ew, though it is one of our favorites, can be off sometimes. Most of the time it's spot on (the chicken is tender and the noodles are al dente), but there have been a couple of occasions where it has been bland or too peppery. But again, it's not all the time and that's why we continue to get it. 

We have, also, tried their Garlic Short Ribs, Wings of Angel, Shrimp Panang Curry, Pad Thai, and Tom Yum Soup. Everything has been good, so far, so we'll continue to enjoy our friendly neighborhood Thai restaurant.",5OW5HpsyZe1-hoxHHZKbsA,1,1,4,uQ1MwX5SN1MEFg7lnVFpsw

Had a craving for Thai after studying for finals so i went during dinner time on a Monday night. Not exactly ""A"" material.

Pad Thai (Chicken) 7.50
For a togo order it was a bit...small. Other places fill the whole box up but one section was left empty for a wedge of lime and ground peanuts, that section could have had a few extra strands of rice noodle!
Taste wise it was...sub standard. It was missing a lot of spicy and strong flavors associated with Thai food. Sugar must have been on sale, bit into a large piece of scrambled egg and tasted more sweet then egg, or sauce, or spicy for that matter.

Yellow Curry (Chicken) 8.75
Piggybacking on the Pad Thai, yeah sugar was on sale cause there was more sweetness then anything else in this curry. Had slices of chili but no heat. Very weak curry essence. Strong coconut milk presence.

If this place was an authentic Thai restaurant it would get Zero stars. But they advertise as an Americanized Thai restaurant so for that they get the job done.",7A7FOLZZKL0iokQVOAEbgA,0,0,3,ijHDzgIKP52ElF_MEWrANg

   Stay away from the scallop tamarind dish and the steamed dumplings, two that I can recall that aren't stars on the menu..  Soo my issues come from the service, and yes I know that service may be lacking in a Thai restaurant.. 5 years ago!  I think it's an area that definitely needs attention and if their food wasn't as amazing as it is I wouldn't set foot in there again.  
   Tonight the server didn't greet us just walked up with a miserable expression saying ""something to drink?"", when did we give up on saying welcome, or how are you this evening or nice to see you again..  He took our order by pulling a piece of register paper out of his pocket, unwrinkled it and asked what we would like, leading to a deep sigh once I ordered two courses.  Mind you it's 8:45pm and the door says open until 10pm. 
   We finish eating our amazing dinner minus the steamed dumplings, not that they knew of us not liking them since no one asked us if our meal was good at any point.  Then that wonderful server came over dropped the check and reluctantly offered to box up some left over pineapple curry and rice.  I never asked for the check so when he came back I said ""can we not get dessert?""  He said ""the kitchen closed at 9:45"" and I followed with ""the door says you close at 10"" it was 9:48.. his response ""that's what time the restaurant closes"".. 
   I was annoyed at this point and suggested they adjust their sign, or at least give their guests the option to order at 9:45..  Why let sales walk out the door?  I spent $50 on Thai food and undoubtably would have purchased two desserts!  Unfortunately we will probably skip this restaurant next time I crave Thai food and start a search for my next favorite.

Pepper steak
Spicy pad Thai 
Golden cups 
Royal duck
Bang bang shrimp
Pad se ew beef
Thai tea

When I called to order I had my husband there reading off that I wanted and he texted me what I told him I wanted because I wanted to make sure NOT to forget. 
When I ordered the pad Thai the male and I discussed how hot I wanted it.

The food took an hour to come and it was cold, but I was STARVING so I didn't really care. My husband pointed out that there was food missing so we checked and it was the Spicy Pad Thai. I wasn't upset, shit happens so I just called and the guy I spoke to apologized and said they will make it and bring it right over.

Soon after I get another call and it was the guy that I originally spoke and who took my order and he said I didn't place the order. I reminded him that he and I spoke about the hotness of the pad Thai and he said yeah, but it wasn't ordered so I need your credit card number again. He said I will leave a note when you order again to give you something free and I said no thanks, I won't be ordering again.

The food is really good, but it took an hour to be delivered and then they accuse me of lying and won't fix what they messed up. I will have this resolved tomorrow during business hours... Guaranteed!!!!!!",WJs5AlCadaqe39wIDEYRYQ,1,0,2,YULbyVU2hvbdKjvJw4HGzQ
2375314,2011-05-23,0,Zmfq3DVhHdtVChhSxzoUHw,"So this is the 3rd restaurant we hit for my birthday dinner marathon.  =)

The food really deserved the 5 star rating, and I'd take 0.5 star off for the waitress failing to refill our water/tea.  Since I had to round it, 4 star it is.

The three of us ordered one appetizer, one salad, and two entrees.

Satay Combo - two beef and two chicken skewers grilled to perfection!  I'd say that Panna Thai delivered the juiciest beef Satay in town!

Yum-wun-sen (the silver noodle salad) - there were only 4 shrimps in this salad and no any other seafood.  I'd say this is seasoned to appeal to the locals since it did taste kind of  ""americanized.""

BBQ Spare Rib - Fork tender and falls right off the bone!  The sweet BBQ sauce wasn't just poured on, it was completely absorbed by the meat itself.

Sweety Duck -  I have to give this two thumbs up.  I'd say we eat duck pretty often since we visit the Cantonese restaurants in town all the time.  The Sweety Duck is up there with the tops, if not, even better!


The decor and atmosphere are WAY better than the Noodle House 2 that's only one block away.  We'd definitely come back again!

I had 2 or 3 very unsatisfactory deliveries and insisted the next time we go for dine in.

Last night we ordered a couple simple dishes and the were all terrible.

Soft shell crab wasn't crispy, the batter tasted like a mouth full of pepper and was soggy.

The flautas used to be my girlfriends favorite; now she won't even finish half an order.

The pork jerky was undercooked (I'm at a loss for how this is even possible).

We ordered the combo basil noodle last night and it was horrific. The thing with this type of dish is because there are so many components with different cooking temperature you really have to know what you're doing...this chef obviously doesn't. The pork component was well overcooked while the shrimp were half translucent still.

2594048,2010-10-28,2,Zmfq3DVhHdtVChhSxzoUHw,"This review is going to sound harsh, so let me preface by saying that I tend to review Thai restaurants based on my own opinion of the flavors in the food.  This means that quality of service, atmosphere, etc. are not necessarily going to sway my review much.  With that said, this place had GREAT service.  Even though I came in with a coupon for $25, I felt like a regular customer within minutes!  The atmosphere is very upscale, and easy jazz music fills the dining area.  Oh, and they do have good Thai tea.

Now on to the food!  I ordered the tom kha soup with chicken (khi), the papaya salad, and the green curry with beef.  None of these were very memorable or impressive, unfortunately.  I also think that they Americanize a few dishes to some degree, but not as much as some other Thai restaurants.

The Tom kha was sweet with no lemongrass or galanga root.  The over all flavor was quite Americanized, in my opinion, and there wasn't anything that really stood out here.  The papaya salad was vinegary in flavor, and otherwise not notable.  The papaya was very crunchy though.  The green curry was suggested by my waitress as her favorite curry, although she didn't seem very enthusiastic about her own choice.  The green curry was a bit thicker than a lot other places, however it was rather light in the flavor department.  It seemed more like a stew with coconut juice mixed in.  On the plus side, it wasn't overly sweet.  The beef was a little tough though. I asked the waitress if the sweet sticky rice with custard was extremely sweet, or just a little sweet... she said that it was too sweet for her, so I passed on the dessert.  

Overall, I would say that it would be very easy to fall in love with this place if I lived in the area, and I didn't have a particular taste when it comes to Thai food.  However, I can't say that I can squeeze in that extra star for Panna Thai due to my picky, snobby opinions.  Sorry, Panna!",wOGfOjBaP-lCS1NW_En2LQ,3,4,2,zx53r0OAFwRy4EuA7VvDkg

Polite and helpful service with generous portions of flavorful Thai food - and the price is fair?! I'm seriously loving this place. Here's what we tried:

* Chicken pad Thai ($8.95) - extremely moist chicken with juicy noodles! It was super flavorful and a heaping size! 5/5

* Beef pad see ew ($8.95) - fat, phat, noodles done right! Everything was moist, seasoned well and the beef was also super tender. 5/5

* Chicken and beef satay with peanut sauce, egg fried rice and cucumber salad ($12.95) - we were able to get a mix of 3 beef & 3 chicken tender skewers. Great flavor. I also loved the peanut dipping sauce!  Get extra. So good. 5/5

* Bang bang shrimp appetizer ($8.95) - this was my least favorite dish. The curry sauce was a little lackluster, watered down and the shrimp flavor was off. My party enjoyed this appetizer, but then again they aren't as critical as I am. 3/5

* Coconut sticky rice with mango (mango sticky rice)($6.95) - a perfect end to an amazing dinner! I always feel like you need a special occasion to eat this, but man, I'll make an exception to have this every time I dine here! They make it exceptionally yummy! 5/5

I love the fact that they offer free refills on the drinks! That alone made me a strong believer. It's just a huge bonus that their food is also tasty and juicy! Panna Thai, put that on your radar. ;)",u_wqt9RshdZsoj8ikLqoEQ,27,29,5,g9X-83vOSlUq3cwD6dGggw

Then he gave us our water finally they never checked up on us none of that. Then we wanted a refill and he told us to hold on with hella attitude. Then he goes to his coworkers and proceeds to talk shit and points at us. It was completely noticeable. And keep in mind there was no one else there we were the only ones. So it wasn't like it was super busy. When we were done eating the guy came up to us and said ""are you going to get your fucking food?"" And my boyfriend said ""we're done eating thank you."" Then the guy said ""pick up your trash don't leave it here."" Then I butted in and said ""it's your fucking job to clean up the mess if you don't like your occupation then quit.""

This time around I came to dine in during my lunch break. It wasn't busy which I appreciated because I was having a short lunch today. They had recently changed their menu so when I had ordered the ""monster salad"" the waiter looked at me clueless. It's now called the ""grilled shrimp salad"".

My salad came out as quick as I devoured it!  It was so delicious. It had just the right amount of spiciness where you can still eat it and not kill your taste buds.

After some delay I ordered the cucumber salad as a starter and the Sweet Basil Chicken with steamed broccoli (they offer sliced or ground chicken options which is nice.  Overall assessment was that the staff was attentive, flavors of the main dish needed some work (ie. Soggy and cold egg roll, watered down sauce for the Sweet Basil Chicken - some ""sliced"" pieces were stringy and varied in size, and the veggie soup that comes with the special is mainly cabbage while still bland).

We were greeted and seated when we came in. I handed the man the certificate and he looked at it and said okay. We got our water and looked over the menus.

We ordered chicken panang curry, bbq spare ribs, beef pad see ew, and beef pad Thai. Each dish was a medium in spicyness. 

When we ordered, my boyfriend asked the waitress if it all comes with rice and she said that the ribs and curry did, so he asked her if it was enough for all of us or if we should order more rice. She said that we don't need more rice because we have the pad thai and the pad see ew and that's what you eat with the dishes. EXCUSE ME!? Who are you to tell us what we eat with our dishes? We're Filipino, we eat EVERYTHING with rice, even noodles! So of course we were a little embarrassed to even order anymore rice. 

The food came after about 10 minutes. My favorite dish was the panang, sooo good! The ribs were really good also, so soft and soo flavorful. The pad see ew and pad thai were average.

The reason why I'm giving them 3 stars instead of 4 is because of their service. No one EVER smiled, asked us how we were doing, or initiated any type of conversation. I saw some other customers come in after us and the servers started talking to them, smiling, and even laughing, so they're obviously capable of doing so, they just didn't with us. I guess it's just one of those places that already have their favorite customers and don't do anything to try and get people to come back.

To be honest... that is one of the main reasons as to why I decided to try this place. I saw a review that said they had free refills on thai iced tea which I had never heard of at any other resteraunt... hahaha

Service was good although we had a girl that was still new I guess... she was a little hesitant but she held through very well. I'm sure she just needed a little more training on little nit pick information. We were greeted right away & seated in a half booth table. The decor was clean & not so cluttered with high ceilings which gave the place a very spacious feel.

SATE BEEF or CHICKEN $7.95 - on the lunch menu... we got both for extra charge. Served w/ cucumber salad, egg fried rice, & DERICIOUS peanut sauce which i also used to eat my pad thai as well!!

I walk in and am instantly taken back by how current and sharp this space is. They spent money in making it look appealing and it does! They were also playing some current American music which was unusual to me, but I liked it. Only one table was occupied by a couple when I placed my takeout order. 

The order taking was slightly awkward as I mentioned to the guy (because I am always entirely too friendly and can't help it. Unless I used expensive, yet bad moisturizer that is making my f*n face stink and the smell is killing me!), I mentioned that I have been dying to try this place.. He asked if I have ever had Thai food before. I wanted to ask him if he had ever brushed his teeth before. Again, I was nice about it. I placed my order for Panang chicken no rice and he then said,"" Medium or Mild"". I responded with,""HOT"". He gave me the look, but than wrote down my order. I paid and he said it would be a few minutes.....

I don't mind waiting because I am in an especially good mood these days. The only couple in the restaurant pays and leaves. The music is turned off. The music never comes back on. I waited close to 30 minutes in silence for my order. I would have waited longer if I didn't get up and walk towards the kitchen. It had been sitting there for who knows how long. RUDE. I smile, grab my food and leave. 

Immediately I open the container upon walking in the door since I'm ravenous for some spicy curry. First impression- Panang sauce is really watery..... Second impression- Panang Chicken has tons of Thai chiles, but zero flavor other than heat. No basil or kaffir lime leaves. No complexity or richness to the sauce. Only pure coconut milk taste or lack of. Dinner fail. 

I really wanted to like this place and had hopes that this would be my new go to Thai spot for date night, but they just don't deliver on any level here. My suggestion is go anywhere else in the area for Thai unless you belong to a Coconut Milk Meetup Group or something. In that case knock yourself out.

The service is always great, the dining room is always clean, and the food is always fresh and hot. One thing we'd like to change is to have fountain sodas instead of the can... But oh well. We definitely keep going back and keep telling our friends and coworkers, too.",oW7-mWT9ghhNDIuAk0-HTg,0,0,5,BsvKWo4dnNH1-uIHFDmttA

3248173,2011-01-22,0,Zmfq3DVhHdtVChhSxzoUHw,"Satay is something rather ubiquitous in my home country of Australia. Being situated close to South East Asia we have quality Asian restaurants in the same way the South Western United States enjoys incredible Mexican food. Satay dishes are so commonplace that in Australia they appear on the menu at regular Chinese restaurants.

Living in Vegas now I've missed satay and even though Malaysian satay (my preference) can be hard to find, Thai satay is an acceptable alternative. Panna Thai takes that alternative and makes it in the best possible way.

Every time we go here I order the Satay Chicken as a dinner portion and both sauce and chicken are incredible. It comes served with egg fried rice and the standard little cucumber salad and is delicious from first bite to last. The chicken is exquisitely basted and marinaded and the peanut sauce perfection itself.

When my wife and I go here we usually enjoy the vegetable summer rolls as a pleasant, fresh appetizer to share and she raves about her vegetarian pad thai with fried tofu. 

I've also ordered the BBQ pork noodle soup which is similarly tasty, but overkill when you're ordering a big plate of Satay.

Service is always attentive and friendly.

My only real gripe with Panna Thai is their lack of a fountain drinks machine and the requirement to buy cans of Coke (or whatever) if you want something non-alcoholic other than filtered tap water. This, of course, means no soda refills.

Overall though, Panna Thai is a great option. Their menu might not be as extensive as some, but they have more than enough to satisfy everyone.",U1XB9-3lh8Z3Eki6qU-v2g,2,0,4,o-O5lCWjWwJzzGU6berywg

To start with, we both had Thai iced teas that were fantastic and refilled before they were halfway empty. We shared a bowl of Tom Kha Gha, which was the best I've ever had.  For entrees, we had the Red Curry with Chicken and Sweety Duck, both of which were fantastic.  The duck was moist with a nice crispy skin and honey glaze, served with steamed broccoli.  The curry had a generous amount of meat and the veggies were fresh and not overcooked.  

Dessert was the house specialty: Mango with Sticky Rice.  Excellent, though it's seasonal, subject to ripe mangos, so take advantage in the springtime! Homemade Coconut Ice Cream is also on the menu, though we didn't get to try it because we were stuffed.

As mentioned in other reviews, the portion size is generous.  Neither my wife nor I were able to finish our entrees and it was packed up with extra rice to take home.

Yellow Curry ( chicken)
Pad Thai ( Shrimp) 
And Crab Rangoons

The curry.... Was kinda bland.. I ordered it to be spicy but it has barely any flavor at all... The chicken was good though.

Pad Thai was delicious, but for an extra $1 for shrimp there should be more Han just four of them in the dish... That's kind of a rip off. The pad Thai was tasty though!

Crab Rangoons were great, full of filling and there were a lot of them...

Tired and hungry, wouldn't really care less driving to other Thai restaurants in the Chinatown area. It took a while for the two of us to get seated. No one was waiting in line, but the one hostess/server was busy serving the tables and taking take out orders. Hence the wait for a table. 

We ordered wings of angel which was boneless chicken wings stuffed with a combination of minced pork and clear noodle, green curry chicken, pad thai, and duck noodle soup. The stuff chicken wings were excellent with just a perfect blend of seasonings in the minced pork and rice noodle. The duck noodle was also delightful. The soup had very nice flavor to complement the duck. The spicy green curry (even though we ordered it mild) was a little bit too hot for me. The pad thai was bland. Couldn't figure out why the pad thai (a staple in all Thai restaurants) was so tasteless. It wasn't until I got the bill that I found out the waitress put the order down with special instructions that said ""no spice"". No wonder it was bland. 

I would definitely come back and try some more of their other dishes like the yellow and green curry. Well worth the money, especially since we had the restuarants.com coupon. When we arrived there wasn't too many tables seated, but when we were about leave the restaurant was quite full. Pretty good business for a Wednesday night.

My family ordered: Tom Kha soup, combination Pad Thai, Beef Panang, & BBQ Spare Ribs, Mango & Sweet Sticky Rice, & Fried Banana (ala mode)

PROS:
* Free refills on the Thai Tea... And they even refill it for you without asking them. That's a major plus!
* Tom Kha soup, Pad Thai, and BBQ spare ribs tastes very similar (and even exactly) to the ones at Thai BBQ
* Mango & Sweet Sticky Rice was delicious!
* Serving size is reasonable & sufficient
* Their lunch menu prices are awesome! $6.95 - $7.95, you can't beat that. Although the meat would be less than from the dinner menu, the lunch menu includes rice, soup, and an egg roll
* The owners were super nice & friendly
* Cute decor inside

[CONS] 
* Unfortunately, their Panang was just okay. That was a major bummer since that's my favorite dish. It wasn't as creamy & sweet. However, the owner said that next time we order Panang, we can request for it to be more creamy & sweet (and even mention for it to taste like the one at Thai BBQ). So, I'll give it another shot the next time I eat here
* Fried Banana had too much coconut on the outside. My sisters love coconut, but even they said the coconut pieces were overwhelming.. On the plus side, the vanilla bean ice cream it came with was yummy

So dinner and 3 lunches for 42 bucks. Super Yummy, lots of flavor, big portions, cheery staff and very reasonable prices, what more can you ask?

Came in toward the end of the night, party of 2. We were seated quick...the staff and Chef (see below) were great and attentive.

Ordered:

Yellow Curry Fettuccine Alfredo...I know! Fettuccine Alfredo in a Thai place?!? Thats what made me want to try it and it didnt disappoint. Though I had to order a side of steamed rice to help with the spice, cus no i didnt have an option of choosing a spice level. But, I would order it again.

Divine Scallops....4 scallops on the plate. God, they melted like butter in my mouth...but again. It was too spicy for my like. So I ate some rice with them. Lol it helps! 

BBQ Chicken....it was about 3-4 pieces of chicken, comes with its own rice. What can I say? Its a classic. It was great. 

For Dessert: We werent going to order any however the Chef happened to be taking a breather while we were having dinner and after a good 15-20 minute conversation about work and life, to our surprise he sent us some dessert, on the house! It was.....

Banana dipped in tempura and deep fried, on the plate came strawberry sauce and on the side a large scoop of fresh coconut ice cream. Wow it was delicious and next time ill order it.",T4S0tAaQR6elsMtWTIc__g,1,0,5,qaz-dwiYWTOPZuSeLOm30A
3780993,2017-09-14,0,Zmfq3DVhHdtVChhSxzoUHw,"I've been going to Panna Thai since it first opened and it's still my favorite Thai restaurant in the valley. I used to always eat at their first restaurant (Thai BBQ on Jones) when I was in high school and when they opened Panna my family would come here almost every other week for dinner since it was closer to home. I love their Thai Tea and I've yet to find any place that beats theirs. It's pretty sweet, but very refreshing and creamy. Their service is always great and their takeout business seems very lively. 

Now for the food, I'll throw out a lot of recommendations but keep in mind I always eat in so I'm not sure how well things keep for delivery or takeout. For noodles, their Pad See-ew and Pad Thai are consistently delicious. I typically go for Beef Pad See-ew or Chicken Pad Thai. For curries, I almost always get a Beef Panang Curry because it's probably my favorite thing on the menu. You can adjust the spiciness to whatever you want too. If Panang isn't your style, I'd recommend the Green Curry with chicken. Other amazing things include: Herbal Fish Salad, which is a bunch of strips of crispy white fish with a unique vinaigrette on greens. Tom Kha soup with chicken, which is like a sour soup with coconut milk and mushrooms. 

They have affordable lunch specials here too. I usually go for the Beef Sate (~$8) or the Garlic Short Ribs (~$7). The short ribs are packed with a lot of flavor in a garlic sauce and the beef sate is like three skewers of meat with good egg fried rice.

All in all, I've been to Panna a bunch of times and have never had a bad experience. They're very consistent and they make good Thai food as well as some specialty fusion dishes. It's a great place to go for large groups too. They serve beer and wine and have a TV if there's a certain game you need to watch. But seriously, get the Thai Tea.",ETGRhvDSYHw-hoz2nA_ewQ,0,0,5,451xl_bdDL3lnVx84hPR4Q

Pad se ew with tofu: I didn't realize that the tofu was fried and was cut into big chunks. I was't a huge fan of this, but my boyfriend loved it so I ended up just giving it to him.

My friend and I came here over the weekend at around 3pm; so no one was in the restaurant.  We ordered: Pad See Ew Beef, Garlic Short Ribs, and Papaya Salad.

The salad was refreshing, the short ribs had a great crispy texture on it and wasn't too salty; just the right amount of garlic flavor, and the Pad See Ew was one of the best I've ever tasted!  It was full of flavor, had an abundance of egg which I love, and you get to choose whether you want american or Chinese broccoli.  Awesome!

Panna Thai is very cute inside.  Much nicer ambiance than your average Thai restaurant.  

In addition, they have a selection of wine and beer.  Also, exceeded my expectations for a Thai place.  We had San Miguel.  Dark and tasty.  No cold glasses though. Boo.

Started with two apps: Wings of angel and royal duck.  The names are a bit whimsical.  The wings are stuffed with glass noodles, and ground pork then fried ultra light and crispy. Very good!  The royal duck was a really pretty presentation.  It was rolled in a tortilla/crepe thing and served with a way to sweet BBQish sauce.  We just thought it needed salt and spice.  Also, the duck was tough. 

Ordered two entrees: Choo-chee shrimp and Pad see-ew noodles with beef.  The shrimp were in a flavorful spicy red curry sauce with keffir leaves, served with rice.  They were good.  The noodles were chow- fun esque.  We ordered a 6 for the spice and they were HOT! We were sweatin' but it hurts so good!

The portions were generous and the prices fair.  We had 3 beers, 2 apps, and 2 entrees....bill was $55.

I ordered the crab wontons and pork pad see ew. I have been on a pork kick lately so that was the reason instead of going traditional with the beef. I was really eager to try the crab wontons as I saw that it was made with real crab. Sure enough it was as delish as other Yelpers had said it was and I even told my husband he HAD to try it. The consensus in our household was that it was pretty great. The pork pad see ew was good but I'm a carbs person. The pork to noodle ratio was about 2:1 so I felt like I was eating a lot of meat. Overall the flavor was good I just didn't like the overbearing meat but if you are a meat eater than this is definitely for you. I have to say I felt like I did get my money's worth in regards to both items. 

The next day I wanted to try the BBQ pork noodles. It's BBQ pork noodle soup and I really really really enjoyed the pork. It was tender and there was plenty (which in this case I appreciated). Yes, I know I'm picky but I felt that the pork to egg noodle ratio was just perfect. I also ordered the spicy basil pork. Now that dish was just ok...definitely not my favorite place to order it from as I missed the cucumbers that do come with it at other Thai places. Overall, I def enjoyed this place. They do get busy though because the second night even though we ordered it at 7:30 pm it still was a 20-30 minute pick up time.

I've frequented MANY thai places (all in LA except for Lotus of Siam), and this place is pretty dang good. 

LArb- 5 star. THe best I've had. Maybe they had a good day, I dunno, but it had a great amount of lime and cilantro with a serious kick. DELICIOSO!

Drunken Noodle- 5 star. AKA Pad Kee Mao.  SOOOO GOOOOOOD. LOVE. 

Panang curry- 2.5 star.  Meh, I'd skip this. It was heavy on the cream and tasted a bit too americanized for my taste. 

In general the food here is a bit more americanized than authentic thai. I like the decor, and the prices are awesome. 

My fave here so far is the THAI ICED TEA.   I can really taste the black tea in there instead of the one's that are just diluted with a bunch of cream in it. And free refills? Too good to be true. That's unheard of in L.A.

An hour before closing, we were the only ones there. (Two women showed up a bit later.) They were already doing some cleaning up, which may account for the very bright lights that weren't in evidence on previous visits.

Surprisingly, there were two Rieslings available by the glass. Our adorable server, Fon, couldn't tell me how the domestic or German offerings differed in terms of dryness, so she offered to bring a sample. She returned with a tray of four tiny sake cups, for both of us to taste the two wines. My husband was a little embarrassed, because he wasn't planning on drinking anything, but the wines were already poured. Very elegant presentation!

We ordered the grilled veggies as an appetizer. The zucchini and eggplant were wrapped with a wide slice of red pepper and topped with a drizzle of lime-infused oil. Delicious.

For our main courses, we chose Massaman Lamb Curry and Mango Tango Salmon. I made sure to say that I wanted the salmon cooked medium. Though her English was very limited, Fon repeated our order verbatim. While the curry was very good (though not the best ever), with lean lamb, as we requested, the salmon dish was a huge disappointment. It looked beautiful, with lots of basil, cashews, some mango, and a few flecks of red pepper. But not only was the salmon a tiny portion, it was thin, with one end not more than a millimeter in thickness. You can't possibly cook it medium when it's that thin. It was so dry and overcooked that we had no choice but to send it back. In its place, we ordered the Thai Pepper Steak. 

While we waited for our replacement, Fon brought us a couple of complimentary cream cheese wontons. It's something that I would never order, since I try to avoid fried foods, but they were fabulous, and it was a really classy thing to do.

The beef dish was very good, with nicely tenderized beef, though not as exotic or spicy as I would have liked. While it was well-executed, it's probably my fault for not choosing something more adventurous.

I didn't really care for the dumplings. They were good, but they had an off taste that I couldn't quite figure out. The dipping sauce that came with the dumplings was a bit too strong in flavor. The tasty ginger with shrimp was my favorite. It had just the right amount of ginger and spices and the shrimp (peeled) was perfectly cooked.

Beef Salad was the best item in my order.  As another reviewer mentioned, the beef was nicely smokey, and it was okay quality meat, not gristly.  The salad is mostly meat, with light lettuce and some tomatoes and cucumbers.  The dressing is mostly lime juice, which I like.  A good low calorie fairly-healthy choice.  I would have liked cucumber slices that were a bit larger.

Chicken Fried Rice was kind of weird, there were clumps that were really sweet (maybe it was sweetened eggs?), but mostly it was really bizarrely bland.  Tons of onions.  Not much chicken or tomatoes.  I would not get this again, myself.

Green Milk Boba was overpriced, the cup was small styrofoam (12-16oz if there wasn't any ice), 50% ice at least, and barely any boba ($1 upcharge).  The boba were super overcooked to the point they had melted down small.  For $4.50 I could have a monster-size boba somewhere else.

I don't think I've ever been more disappointed in other reviews as I was that night. 

Entering, this place was empty...like uncomfortable empty. There was another couple with a child, and even though the atmosphere was great (the ambiance earned them the two stars!) it was just too empty for 9pm at night. 

We order several dishes including papaya salad, pad see eu, pineapple curry, masaman curry, and pineapple rice (which was actually never brought out to us, but after tasting some of the other stuff, we were pretty ecstatic that we wouldn't have to waste more of our money). We also ordered thai tea (one with boba) - which was decent and we weren't charged for refills (which is a plus compared to other places). However, the boba was rock hard -- this might be because it was late at night and they just wanted to get rid of leftovers, but that's not OK at all. 

Out of all the dishes, I ONLY enjoyed the papaya salad and the pad see eu. I felt as if the pineapple curry and the masaman curry were the EXACT same - the only difference was that the pineapple curry had pineapple. The curry was also too watered down. 

All in all, the atmosphere is what's given them my two stars. Service was also on par, no one was rude.

The place is cute and a little modernized.  However it's chilly inside.  And I am not talking about  the spice in the food either.  So if you visit bring your sweater.  The waitress was hard to understand but we got our orders in.  We requested to put no salt in the food because my father-in-law was sensitive to it.  The  choices are typical but the presentation for the food was fancy.  The food came out one at a time (15 minutes wait) but it was still salty!! I  did like the appetizer.  We ordered all seafood dishes except for the bbq chicken.  We also ordered coconut  ice cream for dessert.  The waitress said  it was for one person but it's huge! Also,  if you are planning to come here after the gym make sure it's not ARM DAY!  They must have the heaviest teapots.  It weighed as much as a baby elephant!    
Overall it was a good experience with lots of laughs.  I recommend bringing a date here.  It was nice and clean.

My recent order pad see ew, asparagus with beef, and bbq ribs.

The Pad see ew uses large egg noodles. Very soft. More sou sauce based unlike the pad thai. But very delicious. They offer choices between regular broccoli or the chinese broccoli for the dish. 

Asparagus and beef stir fry. It was seasoned perfectly. Not too salty, asparagus had a crisp to each bite and not overly cooked. 

Bbq ribs. Gives you 3 large ribs marinated with a soy sauce asian bbq sauce. It was great as well. It came with a sweet and sour dipping sauce and fried rice with it as well. The meat was very tender, and came right off the bones.
It's a musy try!

4805337,2016-01-02,1,Zmfq3DVhHdtVChhSxzoUHw,"Two stars for decent Thai food. But tonight will be the last time I order from Panna Thai.

Let me recap. On 12/28/15 I placed an order and it took 2 hours and 13 minutes to arrive. Because of this inconvenience, I was told I would receive a free order of pad Thai.

Tonight I said to my wife, ""Oh hey I have a free order of pad Thai babe!"" so I placed another order with them. The woman who took my order was able to see the note on my account immediately which was great. She took my order, and gave me my total and reiterated I was receiving the pad Thai for free. -Not once did she read my order back to me-. (You will see why this detail is important later)

The delivery was prompt this time, about 40 minutes as opposed to the atrocious amount of time it took on Monday. I ordered the following:

-Thai iced coffee
-Chicken pad Thai (the freebie)
-Beef Sa-te (my wife's fave)
-Chicken basil rice 

I received all of the above as well as 3 free egg rolls, which was nice. However, they gave me chicken sa-te instead of beef. Mind you this is my wife's favorite, and if I order sa-te it's going to be beef.

So I call just to let the restaurant know, thinking maybe this is something that was miscommunicated due to an error in their order placement system. I wasn't asking for a handout or anything. But instead the woman on the phone tells me that she was the one who took my order, and I definitely ordered chicken sa-te because she read my order back to me. ""This is part of the rules."" she says, so I must be crazy. My wife doesn't love the beef sa-te, and I must have ordered chicken. I responded to her telling her that it's not a big deal, I just wanted to let them know, yet she tells me I'm wrong and hangs up.

Needless to say, my family and I will be ordering from a different place when we get the craving for Thai in the future.

Thank you for the free egg rolls though, that would have been a very nice touch if things turned out differently.",3ZD_4uyt1luAfA5TZOsZJQ,3,0,2,arOdelkiI5l0MlygNoi-1A
4813839,2017-07-12,0,Zmfq3DVhHdtVChhSxzoUHw,"I have been to Panna Thai a handful of times over the years. It's never busy, but it's never empty every time I have been.

It's simple to call & order pick-up, which would be ready in 15 min. However, I suggest to never order Thai Tea if it's pick-up. It's great when you dine-in & you can get unlimited refills, but as for pick-up, it's never as good. I'm going to assume that they make the Thai Tea when you call, which in time, will sit & be watered down by the time you pick-up. I also suggest to pass on adding boba. I never find it fresh.

Other than that, their food is good & their portion sizes are good. I have always liked all the food I tried. My go-to is the Spicy Crab Noodle, which is made with legit crab & large enough to share with another person. Panna Thai is a good option to eat at with a family & share different items on the menu.

1 Star Because the service is very good and nice.  They know every person that comes in by first name and provide a friendly atmosphere

1 Star Because the Thai Tea is very good.  Any that restaurant for me should have excellent Thai Tea.  The portion is a bit small but standard.

1 Star Because the parking is easy and the spot is big enough to fit everyone and you are seated immediately.

4973801,2010-12-03,0,Zmfq3DVhHdtVChhSxzoUHw,"Another Thai restaurant experience - lunch specials are the way to go I tell you!

First off, Panna Thai Restaurant looks a bit more upscale than your average Thai joint, which I think reflects in the price as well.

We walked in to a relatively empty restaurant on a weekday.  As the waiter brought us to our table, he immediately asked if we had any coupons (before we even sat down).  We did not, but apparently they do have a lot floating around and are a bit restrictive about how they are used.  I think they are also on restaurant.com too.

Lunch specials are available everyday from 11 am to 4 pm.  They all include a fried wonton, fresh salad, steamed rice, and soup of the day.  (You can substitute fried rice or brown rice for $1 more.)  

Started off with miso soup.  Interesting choice. 

I went for the Yellow Curry Lunch Special with Tofu ""Thai yellow curry and Thai herbs served with Jasmine rice."" ($6.95).   Fried tofu and potatoes were the main components of my dish.  Raw bell peppers decorated the top.  I wished they cooked the veggies with the curry though.  The fried wonton had peas and carrots in it - a bit different than what you normally find inside one of those things.  The biggest problem I had was with the rice.  It was mushy - too much water in the cooker!  It's never a good sign when the rice gets messed up! 

The Husband tried out their Garlic Short Ribs Lunch Special ""Deep fried short ribs sauteed with garlic and black pepper sauce served with Jasmine rice."" ($6.95)  It was a tasty dish and lots of flavor, but then again it's deep fried and it sounds like it would be tasty.

Overall, we found Panna Thai to be just an okay experience.  There are definitely a few other Thai restaurants in the neighborhood that has a foot up on selection, taste, and price.",rt3PC7WCgCKsoufmQJELfw,8,6,3,LsgwBk0pIkQdwQDznOYGvg

They have an amazing variety of spices in all of their dishes that really put them ahead of other options, and I am obsessed with their noodle based offerings including their massive ramen bowls, pad Thai and chow mien.

In addition to take away, the restaurant interior is modern and relaxed and makes for a great lunch or dinner spot. It's never super busy, which is great for a quick or long meal. The staff is friendly and have provided awesome service every time I drop in.

They also provide complimentary refills for their Thai iced tea AND Thai iced coffee. Have you ever had Thai iced tea or Thai iced coffee? They are the BOMB and rarely ever offered unlimited at restaurants. They also serve beer and wine, including Singha the greatest Thai beer to ever exist.

I like the atmosphere here...it's very clean and friendly.  The food prices were also good, especially during lunch time!  Most plates were around $7.

On to the food!

Basil Noodle ($8.50): ""Pad Kee Mao"", Pork, Stir Fried Thick Rice Noodles, Chili Basil, Scrambled Egg, Bell Pepper and Onion. This was not bad...not very hot though for a 10/10. I also found the pork to be a little thick and tougher than I am used to at other Thai restaurants.  THIS is one the dishes I compare all other Thai restaurants in town...and this one wasn't very noteworthy :(

Chili Basil ($6.95): ""Pad Ka Pao"" in Lunch Portion, Ground up Chicken, Sauteed with Sweet Basil, Onion, Bell Pepper, Fresh Chili, and Jasmine Rice. This was a great version of the staple! The most spicy out of all the dishes...it was still far from a 10/10 though!  It was good though, and better than most out there!

Panang Curry in Lunch Portion : Coconut Milk, Curry Paste, Thai Herbs, and Jasmine Rice. This was a great version as well, with just the right amount of spices, flavor and heat! I love Panang curry...and they have a great one here!  Again, better than most I've had out here!

Pad Thai in Lunch Portion : Chicken, Stir Fried Rice Noodles, Scrambled Egg, Shallot, Bean Sprouts, and Tamarind Sauce. This was Grandpa's order...it was good! A bit sweet, but good overall!  I'd say it would be on par with the others I've tried.

Thai Iced Tea ($3)...unlimited refills! It was a good rendition as well, but you can't beat free refills...yeeeee!

Great choice for Thai food if you are in the area!

The server was very accommodating to my bf & I who were the only vegans in the table and helped make our entrees vegan friendly - we got the Spicy Basil Fried Rice (no eggs) with steamed tofu, Pad Thai with fried tofu, a small order of Tom Kha soup with steamed tofu (big enough for the both of us to share) and all were mild spice. I also ordered a Thai iced coffee and my sister ordered a Thai tea which both have non-dairy creamer in it. We loved how it's refillable - just like their Thai BBQ locations! 

The food was pretty good and tasted exactly like their counterpart restaurant but none of our dishes had the spice level we asked for. We were really looking for that spicy kick to our food but had to ask for the hot sauce spice rack to add it in ourselves. Heads up that their ""mild"" is probably considered a 1 or 2, not like your usual mild at a Thai place which is usually at a level of 3 or 4.

My family enjoyed their dishes which included the shrimp Panang penne, pork jerky, BBQ chicken with fried rice, chicken pad Thai, crab fried rice and pork BBQ ribs. The only comment they had was the crab fried rice barely had any crab in it but overall they had a good experience. 

Service was good and the restaurant definitely had a fancy ambiance.",rKdGiLfeE55TClso9GtjsA,4,1,3,R2hbOJeNOtPNCXaOwUtXDQ

The fella orders the crispy duck which is heavenly! Very well seasoned, perfect crisp, delicious hoisin sauce and overall truly unforgettable. 

I order the crying tiger and OH MY I cry tears of joy every time!! The meat is so tender and flavorful with a sauce that though is quite delightful is not truly needed. However, I do at times use the sauce for my veggies!

This place does it well. Very much comparable to our favourite Thai place which is just a little further from home - Archi's on Rainbow.

The first time we came, I ordered the lunch special - both of us agreed that the soup that came with it was so tasty! I had the Pad Thai and he had the tofu Panang Curry. Both delicious!!

Not sure if they hired new folks but they were just rude.  My family and I a total of 6 of us with two little ones went in and the service was super poor.  There was only 2 other people in the restaurant.  
When we went to order we just asked to have a chicken breast for my daughter and they said no whole meal...they were so focused on serviing whole plates they couldn't accomadate.  I even told them to charge us the full price but just a chicken breast is what I needed but they said no that they couldn't do it.  We asked for a side of broccoli and carrots and they said no.  It was ridiculous.  At that point I didn't care if they charged me $20 bucks for broccoli that is what we needed but they couldn't do it.  Finally my husband went to talk to the gentleman behind the counter and asked for the manager and he was very rude and said no manager here and there was nothing he could do.  My husband said we would leave so we all got up and went next door to the sushi place where they always treat us great.  

The gentleman tried to make excuses saying it wasn't his fault and he didn't serve us and he was busy with the two other people in the restaurant.  They still charged us for food they never brought us and we were so frustrated that we gave them the money and left.

Ok, I gave it 4 tries. This time it really did it. 

I would give three stars for food. Here is why: I don't think it's anything great, but it's not too bad either. Although yesterday my husband refused to finish any of the dishes and my 3 year old is literally throwing up as I write this. Last night he had fried rice and soup (she hadn't eaten anything else for dinner - very slim chance of a coincidence).

All four times I've been there, it takes 40 minutes to an hour + to get done. And we are usually ""fast"" eaters. We sit down, we know what we want, we eat, and we're out. We go out every day and don't have time to sit around and talk like some people do.

Ok, I can understand that also, but when it takes 10 minutes between asking for a check and actually getting one there is something wrong here. My husband had already left by then as my 3 year old had enough of sitting there that long. Good thing I paid with cash or I wouldn't be able to wait for another 10 minutes for them to run a card.

We entered the restaurant with no issue as we were seated right away. And that's when everything went wrong. The waitress took a long while to get our order,  and when we were ready, my girlfriend asked if we can have all our orders delivered at the same time. This is because her main dish was tom kha kai which tends to come in first because they're served as an appetizer. She also ordered pineapple fried rice with that because that's how she enjoys the soup. Back to the order, when she asked the waitress if all our food be delivered at the same time, the rep retorted a not-so-reassuring, ""Uhm... I hope so."" She chuckled and walked away. Experiencing was displeasing as if they weren't even going to try and make it happen.

We waited a while for our food to come in, and guess what? They all came in separately. First, it was the chicken satay which we ate pretty quickly. Then we got the soup and my noodle entree. My girlfriend tried waiting for the fried rice when she realized that her soup was getting cold. Very displeasing to see her not eat with me. At that point, she started eating the soup and thinking twice about the other order that was still late. So she went up to another server to tell them that she didn't want that order anymore. 

The food was very basic. Nothing about it stood in mind. My noodles lacked a little bit of sauce as it appeared dry. The satay was rubbery and the peanut sauce that went along with it was bland. My girlfriend liked her soup but was not impressed about the mushroom used with it. Still, it hit the spot. 

Overall, would we come back for a second round? No. The restaurant was courteous enough to give us a 10% off discount for the trouble, which was surprising because it didn't really seem like they cared from the beginning. Anyway, we're too paranoid for repeated offender so I think we'll pass this restaurant and go somewhere else.",PJjpm8Kb4u2DHvj8yBhn0w,2,0,2,MHBhYQ9-pVd9zvS82QO3rA
