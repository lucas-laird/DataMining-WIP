I had the gtoza for an appetizer and they were cooked to perfection. I had the steak and salmon for my entre and it was juicy and tender and the salmon was fresh. I highly recommend the garlic butter with the steakt as it tastes incredible. They were nice enough to let us sample the seaweed salad and it was very tender and flavorful. Everything tasted very fresh. For the price, it truly cannot be beat! I will definitely be back again soon!",6Rc0nOBzDKg74mrknfW_hw,2,0,5,yRA2Gi_KCPt0q77v74xO9w

I ordered the rib-eye steak and it was cooked perfectly.  They even show you the steak before they cook it.  Once I got the steak the owners then gave me 5 different kinds of sauce to sample.  It was my first time and whenever I am in town I will be sure to stop in for a great meal.  Only about 15-17 dollars if I remember correctly.,aZVKlf_c4h8t7-Y04xgisQ,0,0,5,dhcG_Dk-PVVNDlAdeYgXaQ

287404,2015-12-28,1,w6zW6gIyg1sI5V6Wag_SYg,"I've been wanting to write a review for Teppan Bento for a long time. The staff here is always friendly. The gentleman that works the register greets me with a smile and always ask if I've been here before. 

The Angus steak double meat with garlic butter is succulent and savory. I normally ask for my steak to be cooked at medium for melt in yo mouth goodness. Marinated chicken is the wife's fave here. Veggies are good. They tend to go overboard on the onions, but it is a good pairing with the carrots and zucchini. 

Although the meats are cooked to perfection, what makes it over-the-top is the sauces. Make sure you ask for extra teriyaki sauce for the chicken. The mustard sauce and garlic butter compliments the steak well. 

Clearly, these guys don't get a lot of business especially after Fresh and Easy closed next door. I'm sure these guys were getting a lot of their business do to proximity walk ins and convenience. 

You can get a double portion of protein, two cups of rice and veggies for about $11. That's about what you would pay for a three entry at Panda Express. But I'm the kind of dude that doesn't mind paying more for less if the quality is there. Teppan Bento is one of my go to places for a macronutrient friendly meal with phenomenal taste and a decent price.",cbe6OifsNSj_qc5hYrWzmA,0,0,5,wWhb8SljtStIOEcMVxw3OA

They have a seaweed salad that is better then half of the sushi places I've been to and they give you a way bigger portion probably double the size.

Usually get the ribeye, which is always cooked perfectly and extremely tender and flavorful. The garlic butter makes it even more outstanding. Also there are several sauces to choose from as well if you desire.

My only wishes would be the addition of broccoli being added to their veggie mix (onions, squash, carrots) and a regular house salad of some sort being added to the menu.

The steak bento box was suggested when I asked for recommendations, so I got that  - medium rare, and an order of gyoza and chicken katsu. Service was friendly, but they seemed very overwhelmed. To my surprise the wait was minimal. 

Our meal was still piping hot when we unpackaged it. The 110+ temps might have helped. Digging in the gyoza was fine, but rather run of the mill. The katsu was fried crisp and tender, but it was pretty greasy. The steak was bland and the pieces ranged from rare to well done. It was quite bizarre. Two scoops of white rice - yawn. Sauce of some sort was needed. It's possible we were given the garlic butter sauce in the bento box, but it was thick, clumpy and not at all delicious. Sadly, the veggies were the highlight.

The chicken fried rice is so good I don't even have to doctor it up like I do with all other fried rice. It's a family run business and they are very friendly and helpful. They need to work on a few things to make it 5 stars for me. They need real glasses instead of tiny mouth rinsing size paper cups they offer water in. They also need fountain drinks or at least need to offer some diet or no calorie drinks. They've been open 2 months hopefully they will be around. Food is good and fresh .. Decently priced.

Great family run business with excellent food and service. The nice gentleman cooking the food has experience working in some of the finer dining Teppan places around town so he's got the skills. I ordered the Ribeye lunch medium rare and he nailed it. My wife got the marinated chicken and shrimp combo and both were cooked to perfection. Nothing was chewy and everything had great flavor, spring for the fried rice too. Finally, we are a big fan of dipping sauces and Teppan Bento didn't disappoint.

1049987,2017-05-30,3,w6zW6gIyg1sI5V6Wag_SYg,"***UPDATING MY REVIEW***

I have been going to Teppan Bento for years. My only complaint is that it is inconsistent.

FOOD: Teppanyaki is referring to the way the food is prepared. It is sauteed on a large steel grill. The bento refers to the divided compartments allowing you to have a few sides with your dish. For your starch, you can chose their white rice, brown rice, or fried rice. For your meat, you can get a wide variety like chicken, pork, shrimp, beef, calamari, salmon, and more. All bentos are  sevrved with mixed veggies. For sauces, they provide a garlic butter in the bento and you can ask for additional sauces on the side like their popular yum yum sauce or mustard sauce. My biggest complaint is that it is always a hit or miss with this place. Some days the veggies are overcooked while others the steak is overcooked.

ATMOSPHERE: Their food is served in a plastic bento box whether you dine in or out. I prefer not to eat in the restaurant because the smell of food definitely sticks on you. You can watch the cook make your food in the open kitchen.",LTCxnnAQGaGZPHZx4KbvGA,7,7,4,Rz2SAP0Fpb3dEFj06-hy8g

For a teriyaki style take out place, the quality of food is excellent. For someone looking for healthy, protein-packed options; this is a grest spot. The mom - pop feel of the place was nice as both people working went out of they're way to make our dine in experience enjoyable. They even brought us some free samples, to sweeten the deal! I would definitely recommend for anyone looking for a quick, inexpensive, and lighter fare lunch/dinner.",BgxXfxC-qPNFpD5c_pY9pw,0,0,5,dwnoFYClp0mRzRCPlSesPQ

I tried their shrimp tempura and it was not very good. I guess I was expecting more of a ""panko"" crust. The shrimp was really crunchy, almost too crunchy. Almost $7 for only 6 pieces is a little too expensive (I had to finish it all, or I would've felt bad); it would've been worth it if the crust was actually good. The reason why my review is going from a four star to a three is because I saw a cockroach underneath my table (I can only imagine how many are in the kitchen).

My fiancée had the calamari and chicken while I got the steak and shrimp. She really liked the calamari and I found both of my options to be excellent. The boxes came with rice (we both got brown), veggies and sauces. The sauces were a spicey sauce (get it if you like the heat), mustard and spicey mayo. The steak was cooked exactly how I like it and the shrimp were perfectly prepared. Overall I can best compare the qualitie to other high end teppanyaki places.

The service was excellent and very attentive. Our waitress checked in on us several times.

Empty when I entered around noon, I grabbed a booth and settled in. 

Quickly the owner greeted me with a smile and sat menus down in front of me. 

I asked for hot tea and he said he had several options. Me not needing any caffeine I opted for the jasmine, it was amazing. It came with a super fresh juicy lemon. He brought me another cup with my entree. 

It smelled sooo amazing in there I got hungry. I ordered seaweed salad, veggie tempura and a vegetable sushi roll.
Veggie tempura is NOT on the menu, I took a risk and asked for it, he said they could accommodate. 

Seaweed salad was plentiful and the flavor was on point. I like a lot of sesame flavor and it has it.

Tempura came out and I was super excited for my Friday cheat day meal. (we don't eat oil and almost wheat free(vegan) 
Praying my tummy would not hurt later, upon first taste...I didn't care.

The veggies were quick flash fried and the carrots and other veg were super crisp and fresh inside. Broccoli, carrots, asparagus, onion layer, and white sweet potato! 

The roll I ordered never came and thank goodness it didn't! It would have been waaaaay too much food :)

The owner is super nice. He asked how my day was going, what I do, about my electric car, and was super sweet. Made me feel welcome and like family.

But the overall atmosphere in the restaurant isn't that great. Definitely better for take out than dining in.
The portion size was okay. 
I got the salmon poke, and I really liked how they let me switch out the rice with the salad! But the big thing that got was how SALTY everything was.
Food would've have tasted so much better if they didn't put that much salt. It was getting to the point where I couldn't take another bite without having to drink a huge gulp of water right after. 
My friend got the steak and salmon bento, and the salmon was really salty as well and it was dry. Steak was good, but was also too salty.
The shrimp tempura was also too overcooked. Though tempura does mean ""fried"" in japanese, fried shrimp in Japan is totally different from the American fried shrimp. The shrimp tempura in this case was just like the ""fried shrimp"" that's breaded and not coated in the traditional potato starch mixture of the japanese shrimp tempura.

I always get the steak here and they always cooked it the perfect medium rare but since they have a new cook , most of the steak pieces were well done & some that were a bit on the medium rare side turned well done right away. Server did not initially ask me how I wanted my steak but all the other times I dined here they always made it medium rare (tastes best like that anyways) so I just assumed my steak will be cooked the same way. Overall , the steak tasted bad and the main reason why I came here is for their steak.
They don't have garlic butter anymore when we asked our server. I never ever ever get butter on the side at restaurants except for this place. So my friend & I were a bit disappointed about that since their salmon and garlic butter go so great with each other. We would get a lot of sauce options already given but they seem to not do that anymore unless you specifically ask. The pinkish sauce my friend got w/ her salmon tasted more like thousand island sauce - I did not like.
The vegetable options were just terrible - it was mainly ALL ONIONS !!! Mixed with cabbage. With few pieces of broccoli and carrots.
Used to be a great lunch option but now I'll just skip :(",qtOCfMTrozmUSHWIcohc6Q,3,1,2,9VN16BUqU2E4bE9CeOuGNw

2. I have no idea what's going on with their website.

That's it for the negatives.
The food was very tasty. I had the beef with salmon bento with fried rice option and I ordered a chicken katsu bento to go. They give you a lot of delicious dipping sauces too which I love. Who doesn't love Garlic Butter anyways? And it was prepared very quickly. The staff is extremely friendly too but I'm beginning to think it's because they are trying to justify their slightly high prices. I was trying to get up to throw away my trash and they all insisted I sit back down so they could throw it away for me.
They also explained to me at length (without me asking) the quality of the beef that they use and the different levels they use relative to other places, which is why I believe that they know they are pricey and are trying to justify it to me so I'd come back.

If I had 3 wishes Mr. Aladddin sir, it would be to have perfectly cooked steak, shrimp, and salmon.

The bento comes with different sauces; I had garlic butter, spicy wasabi, and garlic butter aioli I think it was? Regardless it was good. And service was A++
They consistently checked on us, asked us while cooking what our preferences were, and offered us sauces to try. They were pretty attentive and polite and I think that makes the establishment a ""diamond in the rough.""

I've been thinking about this review a lot. I think this is my favorite place to eat at, and id probably pick this place before a lot in Vegas. 

The food: absolutely delicious. Their sauces are great, their meats/seafood always tasted fresh. The food alone is worth everything it me haha. 

Delivery: I ordered from grub hub twice. Their boxes for the food are cute and I always liked the way they came. Very clean and proper. 
The second delivery, our steak was cooked medium instead of rare. I called about it and he said no problem, we can come in whenever we want and he will make us the meal we originally ordered. And THIS is why you should come here if the food, service, and presentation isn't enough for you. 

Two months later I call and ask if he remembered us and if we can come in. (Our car was broken down so we couldn't really make it over there for a while). The same guy picked up and remembered the order/problem right away. He said yes come in! We showed up and it has a very homey vibe. It was just him and a lady working there, we asked for just one cup but she was nice enough to give us two. He cooked the same order we had, we didn't even have to tell him anything. The way they treat you here is very respectful and I am so happy we tried this place to begin with. We live across town, but I will always go out of my way to come here when I can.

Located on the southeast corner of Bermuda and Silverado Ranch, I was greeted and seated by a nice elderly lady.  Darius was the guy handling the kitchen (I knew because the elderly lady kept calling his name whenever someone placed an order or needed anything).

The interior of this place is plain, but you are going to be amazed with their menu.  

I Looked at the menu with pictures on the wall and was sold on the certified angus beef bento.  The pictures looked great, so I'm hoping that the real thing is great!  They did not disappoint!

In about 5 less than 10 mins I got my hot steak bento.  You can get a choice of steamed rice or fried rice.  I figured that my bento would have enough going on, so I decided to stick with the plain steamed rice.  Other than two scoops of rice, the steak bento came with a very generous portion of steak (cut in cubes), veggies, garlic butter, hot mustard sauce, and spicy sauce.

The garlic butter was amazing!  The garlic butter had chunks of fried garlic.  The hot mustard was not too strong, but whoah....the spicy sauce was really spicy!  And if you didn't catch the spiciness the first second, it will creep up to you in a few seconds!  Spicy as hell, but awesome!  

My steak was cooked medium rare, and it came out juicy and full of flavor.  The steak is great with a bit of garlic butter and dipped in the hot mustard (or the spicy sauce....or BOTH).  Every bite was like a taste of heaven.

Their tap water is flavored with lemon/lime (you can see the water jar full of lemon/limes on the counter when you walk in).

The day I went, Friday evening, the place wasn't crowded at all. There was only one other group there. Seemed like the entire place was being operated one guy who was personable and pretty attentive. I did notice that the back three booths seemed to be piled up with misc items (dishes, a baby stroller, etc). This didn't really take away from the ambiance, but just a little disorganized looking besides I was there to chow down and not romance my girlfriend. I mean c'mon, wining and dining my girl requires a visit to KFC or at the very least - Chuck'E'Cheese (Baller!!!) 

So the menu is pretty straightforward and varied. I ordered the chicken breast/thigh and calamari box, but was told that there wasn't any more chicken thigh so it would just be chicken breast and calamari. No biggie.

The food came out and it looked okay, nothing impressive. The amount of chicken breast provided was a little skimpy in my opinion. I thought I'd get a bigger helping since there wasn't any chicken thigh that day (Guess not). The veggies looked tired like they just pulled a 12 hour graveyard shift. The calamari was in box form (Usually prefer tentacle form).  However with any food review the tastes trump the looks.

So how did it taste? It tasted okay, nothing to write home about, but nothing really warranting a return visit either. Chicken was nothing special. Calamari was chewy and also nothing special. Veggies were a bit soggy and tired. The same tired like a single mother coming home from her third job serving tables at Chuck'E'Cheese and finding out that Little Billy lost his retainer at school again. C'mon Billy!!! That thing is expensive! You think money grows on trees? .......So I digress........

Teppan Bento - it's okay if you happen to be in the area, but the value and quality for the money wasn't really worth it. There are better places out in Vegas (like KFC).",UwnDzkmn1P4b8YjhqI7pgw,1,0,2,yDlCI0qaczDiiSrKhYuvtg

overly oily. Veggies were cut with thought and again cooked with care and tasted delicious. Excellent seaweed salad and gyoza too.

I ordered hot tea, the seaweed appetizer, and the beef & shrimp combination bento. The beef was prepared to a perfect medium-rare, much to my surprise as most restaurants, including some fancy ones, tend to over cook the meat. 

Sauces were served ""on the side"" for all of my orders, including the garlic butter for the brown rice. This gave me the opportunity to try different protein/sauce combinations as well as the option to stay healthy by dialing down the sauce.    

Despite the unassuming deco, the restaurant is very clean. The menu, though simple, offers great value. Service was friendly. The icing on the cake - diligent employee when no one is watching bodes well for the consistency of quality.",CuPtwt2pWM-DP-hxjSH59w,0,0,5,2uuJizEtr1mmR2RwvSrcWw

We walk in and the lady (who I assume is part owner or something?) tells us to sit down. She asks us what drinks we want, notices that we have water bottles just says ""No drinks"" and immediately leaves. Leaving us confused if we can or cannot drink the water we brought.

We decide what to order and ding the bell on the table (a bit strange in my opinion, but the lady did say to ring it). She gives us a quick glance, serves the other table of 1, seats another table who just got there, and takes the new table's order. Then finally gets to us (a table of 4, and we had already been there for 20 mins).

She asks us what we want, we tell her as she is rushing through getting our order (and the place isn't even busy!). Most of my table asked if they could also get drinks. Her response was ""you can go get it.""

5 mins go by and the table who came in 15 mins after us gets their food. Great. We proceed to wait another 15 mins and get our food. Each dish had problems. Also, my dad's seaweed salad never showed up and my mom's whole entree was nowhere to be found until she asked 10 mins later. The server completely forgot to tell the chefs, and it's another 10 mins to get her food. By now my mom doesn't even want it. We spent so long at this place waiting even though there were barely any customers and the orders went missing/got messed up. No wonder they were empty.

To top it all off though, when we finally get the bill the place is empty and she asks for a tip!! Nope. We usually tip well since we know what it's like to be a server. I know she was trying I guess, but not once did she at least apologize or acknowledge that she messed up multiple times.

My boyfriend and I started with chicken and shrimp fried gyoza. They weren't bad but not memorable. I ordered the chicken and beef bento box with brown rice and my boyfriend got the shrimp and beef bento with fried rice. Since it was our first time there, they gave us all of their sauces to try and gave recommendations for which sauce went well with which meat. 

The best part of the meal were the sauces. My favorites were the yumyum sauce (creamy and tangy) and a spicy sauce, which had flavors reminiscent of Thai cuisine. And if you like garlic, the garlic butter/dip that comes with each bento was delicious as well.

I love supporting mom and pop shops too, but it's even better when you get to patronize them because they're great and not just because you're tired of the big guy. Teppan Bento is run by a son and his aunt, uncle, and mother. Total small time establishment.

I ordered the Chicken and Salmon bento, and my girlfriend ordered the steak and shrimp bento with chicken fried rice. We also got a gyoza appetizer. It was a lot more food than I had anticipated. We both split all the food and tried everything. I'd break down the food as following:

-steak 5/5
-chicken 4/5
-shrimp 5/5
-salmon 5/5
-gyoza 3/5
-chicken fried rice 5/5
-vegetable side 5/5

All the food was delicious, but especially the steak. It was cooked perfect. Also, their copious amounts of dipping sauces were amazing. My favourites were the mustard sauce and yum yum sauce. 

If you're in town and looking for some good teppanyaki-esque food, or just a good bento lunch/dinner, you HAVE to give this place a try. You would definitely be missing out if you didn't come here.

I went with my girl friend and it was strange to say the least. Menus in the front but booths to sit so I didn't know if we put in an order at the register or the table. 

I did use the free gyoza appetizer by checking in. The chicken ones were average. Oddly enough, they smelled like McDonalds french fries. We ordered a shrimp and chicken combo bento box with fried rice. We had full intentions to get another order if we were still hungry but we didn't even finish half of the first one. They also serve water in red solo cups?? What??

When I bit the shrimp I could feel the puncture of the skin and the squishy texture. Most of them still had the feces line. The chicken was fatty and had a weird taste. 

The man who took our order was really sweet at first but did not say goodbye or that he appreciates the constructive Criticism when I told him it was not good. I did not mean it to be offensively and I'm sorry you saw it that way.

This place is about 5 minutes from home in the Fresh & Easy shopping plaza on Silverado Ranch & Bermuda. I have passed this placed for months wondering. Now I wonder how It took me this long to try! 
We were too lazy to cook one night and read of all the reviews so decided we'd give it a try. Cute couple greeted us nicely at the door and mentioned the specials on their board and if we'd ever eaten there. We explained it was our first time and he went on to explain the quality, and sauces and that he suggested the steak. 
I really wanted to try the Ahi steak and ribeye steak, so my boyfriend and I ordered 1 Bento of each. He let us know we could dine in even as it was closing up soon. But we didn't want to bother them and wanted to just rush home. We sat for a bit as the wife I guess clarified the available sauces that were their own homemade recipes so I asked if we could try them all. 
Our order was cooked quickly, packed neatly and with all the utensils and additional sauces requested. They even packed us an extra Chicken Fried Rice order. 
We got home, and dug in! FIRST bite was phenomenal! The medium steak was premium quality, juicy and tender. Vegetables were not over or under cooked. Mixed with the chicken fried rice, I swear I felt like I was sitting at a teppanyaki grill with the chef right in front. We scarfed down both orders quietly as we tried each sauce. I loved the ginger sauce. The spicy mayo with the ahi has more kick than I expected.
Service was so welcoming, food was top notch and portions are heavier than they look. Our meal came up to about $32+/- pre-tip for 2 full meals and I swear ever dollar was worth it.",QZXASwZ2RYTexiY0J0xAcw,4,4,5,irwWVQh2ZOR6eiwB4i4dVQ

Being greeted by the entire staff like a good pal that has finally come back home. Now this is based off of my own individual experiences but nonetheless these are very nice people running an honest to God business.

Interior: Fairly open with maybe 7-8 tables so if it's not busy please take a seat, they will bring you all sorts of sauces to try and just chat, they like to get to know the customers that are visiting their establishment.

Food: I love their salmon which is personally selected by the chef/owner every week. Sometimes there is no salmon and I respect that.. why? because he refuses to compromise with his ingredients. He loses money potentially by not having that dish but there are still other great options. I really like their marinated chicken, very tasty and super tender. The steak is also a good option and ask to have it with the garlic butter its fantastic. The food is incredibly fresh and also a great healthy alternative.

Service: A+ 

Overall: fair prices, friendly service, and quality ingredients. Also in an area where good food is hard to come by. My new favorite restaurant",lXZ7aziyUJyA6V0FlIR1Wg,5,3,5,Dqe6bpzF_ZhxFLnyZs_NIA

There was more fried rice than anything else in the bento box so I would suggest less rice and more steak and veggies to balance the bento box out.

I do recommend calling in your order ahead of time if you're in a rush since it did take about 10-15 to get my food and that was with no one else ahead of me. I was in no rush so it didn't matter to me.

I chose the combo bento with calamari and steak.  I asked about the tofu steak and learned it is being phased out of the menu.  When the chef heard me discuss it, he offered to make me the tofu steak on the house since it is going away.

I tried 4 sauces - the house made chipotle hot sauce, the garlic hot sauce, gyoza sauce, and ginger sauce, and got steamed rice with my bento.  The bento came with veggies (onions, carrots, and zucchini).  I really enjoyed the meal - everything was cooked perfectly and tasted very well-seasoned.  I was able to order my steak cooked the way I prefer.  The sauces complimented everything.  Ginger sauce goes very well with the veggies.

All sauces are homemade and so good, the chicken Katsu was crispy crunchy and not oily or greasy at all. The shrimp tempura was like fried shrimp and ver crunchy as well. The beef steak my daughter ordered was good without too much seasoning as you would use the sauces for dipping the meat in. The mustard sauce goes very well with the steak. We both had a lot of food left over enough for another meal.

4933328,2015-06-24,1,w6zW6gIyg1sI5V6Wag_SYg,"We were on vacation in Las Vegas and the only food we knew our whole family would agree on was Japanese food.  My husband found Teppan Bento on yelp and was impressed that it had such a high rating and so many great reviews. 

There are so many things I like about this place.  First, the ambiance.  It is a small, quaint establishment with nice acoustic music playing in the background (music like what you'd expect at a coffeehouse with live performers).  Next, the menu has just enough selection (not too many choices and not too little).   The service was a bit slow (and we were REALLY hungry), but all was forgiven once we were served.  I ordered the bento box with marinated chicken and calamari.  I have never in my life had calamari that was so fresh.  In fact, all of their ingredients seemed to be top notch (the only downside was my vegetables were cold...but still tasted great).  If you are a fan of ginger, be sure to request the ginger sauce; it complements the calamari nicely.

On finishing our meal, the chef came out and asked us how we enjoyed our food.  I really like it when the chef takes interest in how well received their dishes are.  Of course, we told him how much we enjoyed it! 

Our server was also very polite and attentive to our needs.  On our next trip to Vegas, we will definitely be stopping here for a meal!

Thanks, Teppan Bento!!",nYRPJQVS8AtgL3dgVoUyZA,1,1,5,f0KJaLzsGQ95aMxWjZHQoA
4934791,2016-01-14,2,w6zW6gIyg1sI5V6Wag_SYg,"I am gonna give this place a 3.5 star and so for this review, I have upped it or rounded it off to 5 star.

1.  Service - Fantastic. The chef and the waitress of this family style restaurant are very nice, friendly, and very good cooks.  I enjoyed their personal touch and accommodating whatever we needed, including asking tons of questions being our first time.

2.  Ambiance - Interesting. This place feels more like a fast food establishment although it has plenty of seats and benches.  There is no problem with parking at this strip mall. On a Saturday at 6:15 pm, we were the only ones at the restaurant, although within 30 minutes, there were quite a few more.

3.  The food- Interesting.  The food is served in disposable containers that are like  small bento boxes.  When I say small, I mean that they  seem to be about 70% the size of a normal bento box. It is also a bit shallower as well.

a. Calamari and Salmon - Very tasty calamari and tender overall considering it is not fried or breaded.  However, there was very little of it. I would say 2-3 ounces.  The salmon was very tasty and just that it was such a small portion. Again, 2-3 ounces and fairly thin.  I like thick portions of salmon.  Rice, and some other tidbits rounded out this meal and it was good.

b.  Teriyaki Beef and Chicken Katsu - the wifey had this one and the beef was good and the katsu was very, very thin.  Normally I like a very juicy piece of chicken and you can bite into the delicate katsu, with the right amount of crunchiness and then you get all the juicy bits of chicken.  This was thin, crunchy and easy to eat, just not what I was expecting.

c.  Tuna Poke - Our friends had this and I did not try it.  Although, you get a lot of poke mixed in the salad.  Looked good to me!

d.  Drinks are served in small 8 oz plastic disposable tumblers.  It was okay.  We had water.

The people are GREAT, the food tasty, I guess I may have been slightly underwhelmed by the pricing.  I have had teppanyaki style at many places and so you definitely are getting teppanyaki at half the price.  You are also getting a lot less in size and ounces too though.  

Eating say, Hawaiian plate food in disposable dishes seems to be okay and I guess it is because you get a heapin full of really good and tasty food. Here, the disposable dishes and the small servings kind of made everything feel a bit...well underwhelmed.

I was truly surprised by all the 5 star reviews and this place being the best and tastiest.  I may have to go back as I am totally not convinced at this time.

GK says, worth to check it out and inexpensive overall.",owlUazXSDLaxlOV7z8181g,3,5,4,DO_j_FvoyL1FskIOMLLUlA

4968709,2015-04-18,2,w6zW6gIyg1sI5V6Wag_SYg,"If you know what Teppan-yaki is then you have probably frequented a Benihana's establishment at some point or another. You may have experienced the wonder that is known as the ""volcano,"" or been lucky enough to witness the ""train,"" and this may lead you to believe that you know something about Teppan-yaki - but take it from a former vet in the Teppan-yaki game (I worked at Benihana's in HS from 96-97), Teppan Bento is legit. 

Don't let me mislead you...there are no chefs putting on a spectacle of chicken fried rice mounds and shrimp tails flying gracefully through the air here, but when you really get to thinking about it, isn't that the extra you're paying more for to somehow justify the $25 price tag for a ""meal-and-show?""

You will definitely not pay the extra at Teppan Bento but you will get all of the delicious food that would have accompanied the flare - shrimp, marinated chicken, some delicious squid and Black Angus steak all cooked up to your liking with an army of sauces to choose from, served with grilled veggies and rice. I was partial to both the Garlic and Mustard sauces but there were several others. Oh yeah and don't forget the garlic butter - slather it on that meat!

Other reviewers were on point - the Chicken Katsu is some good eats. Simple and delicious. My young, rambunctious son who eats up Chicken Katsu was appeased so it had to be good. 

They just opened about a week ago and were working out a few kinks but the owners' level of customer service was obviously apparent - my wife even said it was ""like we were family!"" Although to my wife, everyone is like family :) 

Bottom line - good, healthy and quick eats at a great price. I can totally see myself picking this up for my family, especially the kids, or as a meal before or after a workout (maybe add brown rice to the menu?), or just to nosh on myself when I'm working late.

Lets just say the food was worth the wait--over a 40 minute wait. Since the guy whom took our order and his assistant were very nice im going to let the wait time slide as well as the fact that my order was missing an item as clearly the place was short staffed on the night of my visit. 

I ordred the pork katsu and the caterpillar roll. The pork katsu met my expectations. It was fried perfectly and the breding was light and flaky as you'd expect with this dish. meat wasnt try and the katsu sauce of course was fine as well.

Catepillar roll was actually really good. the fish tasted fresh and I personally found with each bite the flavor to be superb.

I thought I had discovered a new & still unknown gem. I needed to write a review for this place--gosh, maybe I'd be the first reviewer!? Well, here I am, reviewer #232.

One of the reasons I thought this place was new is that it's usually empty when I stop in. But hey, I'm probably often their first customer of the day when I stop in at opening time on my way home from grocery shopping or something. At 11AM my taste goes toward sushi. At $4.95 for 8 pieces of California Roll or Vegetable Roll I've got a satisfying small lunch for myself. Only problem is, I know they have the best fried gyoza ($4.25 for 6 scrumptuous pieces) I've ever tasted so I often have to add that to my order. Yum!

Such a friendly and delicious place!
The salmon poke is to die for, quality is GREAT.
I love how buttery the texture is for being so fresh. Definitely get this if you're a salmon sashimi lover + it has huge fresh avocado chunks and a delish home made ginger dressing on the side salad (This is my personal favorite).
Also the shrimp + garlic butter is also a killer! The shrimp is super tasty and prepared better than a couple other teppan restaurants I've been to (Benihana, Musashi). As a bonus, they provide juicy limes to squeeze all over it. 
Another popular item I got to try was the black angus rib-eye steak, mmmmm yummy & flavorful!
You can order it however you want- I preferred mine medium rare. It also comes with rice and grilled veggies (which are also delish).

Don't forget to claim the free goyza appetizer during check in ;)

5391544,2015-06-25,1,w6zW6gIyg1sI5V6Wag_SYg,"While looking for a place to grub for dinner, a group of friends and I were attracted to this place by the 5 star rating. As we walked in we noticed it's a pretty small sized space with the cashier right in front as you walk in and 4 dine in tables. Their area of strength that was instantly noticeable was their excellent service. For example, one of my friends, the asshole he is, brought a soup from a neighboring restaurant. The kind woman at the cashier offered him a spoon to eat, as well as a cup of water. If that's not good service I don't know what is! Onto the food...

The menu is fairly small with a few starter dishes and their main bento boxes have meat choices of chicken, shrimp, and beef. 

We ordered the chicken/shrimp box and the ribeye box with sides of seaweed salad and fried shrimp. The highlight was definitely the ribeye and the garlic butter that came on the side with it. Meat was requested as medium-rare and it came out as such. Very tender and full of flavor. The above mentioned garlic butter is a delicious compliment to the ribeye (or to any of the meats for that matter), and it's not a surprise why it's featured in so many of these reviews. The seaweed salad was also excellent, might be an acquired taste since some people don't enjoy it. 
 
Pricing is extremely fair for the serving size and quality. For 2 bento boxes and 3 sides we paid a total of 50$. 

The place has a nice homey, hole in the wall feel to it and the complimentary water cooler with cups is a nice touch if you don't drink soda. 

Great place, great food, will def be visiting again.",FsbgLI_0UUnEQMZY3ZgTRw,0,0,5,7CpiGwDRGuoULuraNwnHSg

It's the perfect amount for me and the flavors are incredible. I'm really picky about my steak because I like it cooked medium rare-rare and at most places it comes out too over cooked. The chef/owner knew exactly what I meant when I asked for rare plus. The meat was tender and melts in your mouth. The garlic butter sauce was amazing. I suggest trying the chicken fried rice as well. The price was really reasonable, less than $10. The place is really hole in the wall, not super decorated but the food was well worth it.

Everyone was so incredibly attentive and informative. The owners brought out all different kinds of dipping sauces (HUGE fan of the sweet and spicy sauce) and gave us dishes on the house. Although we did also order a massive amount of food so we could have a taste of everything.
My family and I ordered: steak bento, steak and shrimp bento, 2 chicken katsu bento, shrimp bento, and shrimp tempura. We also got a free appetizer for ordering 5 bento boxes. It's usually a free chicken katsu but they allowed us to substitute it for the calamari, which was delicious and juicy. Everything was cooked fresh since it's teppanyaki and everything tasted great! I'd definitely recommend the calamari appetizer and steak bento for sure! And most definitely ask for the assortment of spicy dipping sauces. We're a condiments family so we were in heaven! And beverages come with the meal. They don't do fountain drinks, they offer cans and bottled water. The service was so wonderful that we couldn't help but to leave extra tip.

The katsu was great, crisp with panko and served with flavorful sauces. The marinated chicken was good, especially with the complex ginger sauce that accompanied it. But the star performer here was the ribeye, served with spicy mayo and mustard sauces.

We upgraded from white rice to chicken fried rice, which was also delicious. The vegetables that accompanied them were obviously fresh.

The service was friendly and prompt. We were raving about this place the rest of the weekend after eating it. We'll definitely be back.",n-U5fa4B0hKfmRSZ-M7BMg,1,0,5,DaZNentJraGwfOKNfAfPWQ

We both ordered a bento box and both were tasty, fresh and hot.  They asked several times if we were enjoying the food and it was endearing and not annoying.

Dumplings tasted like frozen food. THe bento boxes were great and all the dishes were cooked well. They ended up giving me some fried rice but it was super old and inedible.

I got the steak and salmon bento for $12.50 and upgraded the rice to fried rice for like $2 more.  The steak was cooked perfectly to medium and the salmon was delicious.  Even the veggies had a great flavor to them.  Next time I would pass on the fried rice though because it was not tasty.  It looked like it was just colored brown with miniscule chunks of chicken in it.  I prefer my fried rice with some veggies in it and I like it to have that nice charred flavor from the wok.

Honestly the price was fair and service was better than most in and out restaurants like this. Owners were working which is always a plus in my book. $30 for steak and shrimp with fried rice and steak and salmon with white rice.

Steak was slightly overcooked which is understandable since its such small cubes of beef, but flavor was good. Could use a bit more seasoning on the steak itself, but with the sauces provided it was still pretty damn good.

The highlight by FAR was the salmon which was cooked perfectly medium like I requested and the shrimp was cooked perfectly as well. The garlic butter they serve with it is laced with crack cocaine for certain.

Our waiter seemed a bit distracted ...he told us it was the cooks fault or something like that .. I just know he blamed someone back there lol... I had the steak and calamari. The steak was cooked medium well and was pretty good the calamari was tender but could have been cooked just a tad longer for me. My gf had the chicken and salmon. The salmon was not too bad and the chicken wasn't over cooked. We also ordered the mixed tempura which was a bit smaller than I expected it would be. I did enjoy the yummy sauce that loves up to its name. The yummy sauce is a citrus and creamy at the same time with some tang kick to it ...went well with the salmon. The teriyaki sauce I tend to like a thicker sauce this one was just way too thin for me. I would give this place another try ... I just hope the service is a little better the way other people described and next time I shall try the other options. My experience was subpar but I'm willing to give them another try..
