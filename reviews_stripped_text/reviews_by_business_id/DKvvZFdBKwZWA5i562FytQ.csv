Along with the delicious fried oysters. I will definitely be ordering again from here again! Five stars all around.,MF1bASWyf8ManBtyK5jSQQ,3,1,5,iBX5XJDgw49PwZvusuy9QQ

I am originally from Louisiana and the food here is a combination of spices and flavors of cajun south with a sprinkle of west coast, that gives the food a unique taste that's guaranteed to please the toughest critics. Keep up the great work Cajun Cafe!!!!",w9U5mWQMo7xCQ1niqD8A3A,0,1,5,dMWo6suW83Rjwue6Ltta6w

The food was disappointing. We tried the  lobster with pasta, Cajun shrimp tacos, and the fried oysters. The lobster was dry and tough. I am still picking lobster out of my teeth. The pasta tasted good but was over cooked. The Cajun shrimp tacos were tasty but dry. I wish their was a sauce or coleslaw to go with the tacos to help combat the dryness. I didn't eat the oysters because I found a metal scrub pad bristle in the one I was going to eat. They looked good though!

The service was great! They were very prompt to get back to us (over Facebook and through text). And they were happy to answer any questions we had. And they were on time when delivering our food. 

Though I commend what they are doing with their delivery only restaurant, I was disappointed with the quality of food.",jyqQzxt5XEceAomRY1oQSw,0,0,2,oRyluCo2LU_Ra7g4Vme1vw

There's NO better grits out there, and I can't begin to tell you how flavorful and plentiful the food will be if you order from Cajun Caf√©...

I don't normally like food with any spicy heat, but THIS guy knows how to marry flavors better than most - so when I heard about the business opening, I couldn't WAIT to find a way to praise the efforts of this chef...

I see big things in the future!  Including a bag of shrimp boil, bacon wrapped peppers, and that amazing bowl of grits delivered to me too!",R_O9tbY8RgPybQ032xY1bw,2,1,5,Fi9j_-GmXVyAsmn7tWJsMg
