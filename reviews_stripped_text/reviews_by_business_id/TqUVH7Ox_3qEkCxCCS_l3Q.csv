The person that paid for this meal thought this was a more reasonable price for similar quality meat.

As a veggie, the veggie preparation (seasoning and cooking) was not as good as the preparation of veggies at Lawry's, but the raw ingredients were MUCH better (for Las Vegas.)

The next time we are in Las Vegas, we will choose to visit here instead of Lawry's Prime Rib.",D2XYOmuylBWLBEyDjC_l9A,0,0,4,wmfkXX9KnyCuTho2LeUEBw

139185,2011-06-30,0,TqUVH7Ox_3qEkCxCCS_l3Q,"Hello all,
When reviewing restaurants I use a rating system that looks at all aspects of their Menu, Decor, Food, Service & Price. A restaurant can score up to 5 points per category and a perfect score would be 25 points.

Menu:  2 Stars: The menu was available online which I really like and it was presented in a clean and easy to read format.  I am giving a low score here because I got turned off when I saw  a vegetable tempura app on the menu of a fine dining steakhouse.  Typically I like concise menus, however this menu was lacking options.
Decor:  4 Stars: I found the decor and ambiance of the restaurant tomb fantastic.  I really liked the look and style, it blended well with their concept.
Food:  2.5 Stars: Average is all I can say about the food here.  The appetizer I selected for the table was a crab stuffed mushroom which was deep fried and served on a plate with 3 different sauces, 2 on the plate for garnish and one for dipping.  I would not order this again. My salad was terrible, I am still not sure how a fine dining steakhouse can mess up a house salad and as for my entree the only thing I liked about my steak was it's size.  Although after I cut off all the fat there wasn't much meat left.  Did not get dessert as the choices were less then impressive.
Service: 3 Stars: I liked the fact that bottled Voss water is flowing like champagne at at a wedding at no extra charge.  The wait staff was efficient but not that which you would typically see in a fancy steakhouse.  I asked about the daily specials and for a dinner recommendation and was not impressed by their knowledge and delivery.
Price: 3 Stars: I would say the average entree was $25, a little high for the location and quality but not outrageous.  Overall dinner was about $40 per person with tax & tip.

My overall rating, 14.5 of 25 lands this place 2 Stars, as I would not return here nor would I recommend it.

159015,2013-05-07,0,TqUVH7Ox_3qEkCxCCS_l3Q,"My husband and I recently stayed at the Orleans, Apr. 16-20.  We decided that we would have dinner one night at the Prime Rib Loft.  In all the years that we've stayed at the Orleans, we never made it to the Loft and this time we decided to do it.  In a nutshell, it was just outstanding!  

From the moment we walked in, I knew I was going to like it.  Very nice atmosphere for a good, relaxing dinner.  Our waiter, Daniel, was just awesome.  He was very helpful, paced the diner well, never rushed us.  Daniel told us he had been working at the Loft for only 5 weeks, but his experience spoke otherwise.  I would recommend Daniel in a heartbeat!  

We started out by sharing an appetizer of shrimp cocktail.  It was a plate of about six very nice sized shrimp with an interesting sauce.  It was homemade cocktail sauce with some hot mustard drizzled on the top and on the plate.  I absolutely loved it; then again, I haven't really met a shrimp I didn't like!  For the main course, my husband ordered the sea bass; since I'm basically a carnivore (!), I had to have my prime rib.  I had the small cut.  My husband absolutely loved his sea bass, and the size of the fish was a very generous portion.  My prime rib was extremely flavorful and so tender (I always order mine medium rare) that I really didn't need the knife.  For my side, I ordered the garlic mashed potatoes and there was a generous amount of garlic in them.  It didn't overpower the potatoes at all.  Then again, I'm a garlic lover and there really isn't any such thing as too much garlic!  

Who I presume to be the manager came over to our table.  Unfortunately, I don't remember her name, but she was extremely friendly.  We told her we chose the Loft because we were celebrating our wedding anniversary.  A few minutes later, Daniel came over with a complimentary dessert that was just out of this world!  My husband, who rarely eats chocolate and even more rarely has dessert, ate quite a bit which says something.  It was almost a ""death by chocolate"" cake - the cake itself was chocolate, the inside and top was covered with layers of chocolate, and the back side of the slice had shaved chocolate.  If that wasn't enough, it was drizzled with fresh raspberry sauce, and there were several fresh raspberries and blackberries (my personal favorite) on the plate.  It was by far, hands down, the best chocolate cake I have ever eaten.  

Also with dinner, my husband ordered a bottle of wine for us.  Ordering wine is a little bit of a challenge as he likes sweeter whites and I lean toward the dry reds.  We compromised and ordered a bottle of Mc Murray Ranch Pinot Noir, and it was just wonderful.  It went well with both of our dinners.  

All in all, I definitely recommend the Prime Rib Loft if you're looking for a quite, relaxing, top notch dinner.  I can't say enough about Daniel - he did an outstanding job.  When we go back, hopefully he'll be there because I definitely want him as our waiter.  The Prime Rib Loft is very reasonably priced; and the food is fresh and very flavorful.  This place really is very underrated and people truly don't know what they're missing.  

My rating is really 4.5.  One thing bothered me and while this may be just a personal preference of mine, I wonder if other people are bothered by this as well.  The dress code at the Loft is basically business casual.  While we were there, we saw two different parties, one party being mostly male, that walked in with T-shirts and baseball caps, some turned backwards.  Really?  While I understand that the dress code is not formal, considering the ambiance, service, food, wine selection, etc., that one is getting and paying for, I think a little more respect should be shown.  If I wanted to see t-shirts and baseball caps, I could have dined at an outdoor cafe or bar!  I really would like to see management change the dress code so that t-shirts and baseball caps are not allowed.  

All in all, a truly wonderful dinner and we'll be back to dine again.  Keep up the GREAT work, Prime Rib Loft, and hope to see you very soon!",rndSHtiaFqw5f3lQYtYSyg,2,0,4,mAKHRn7YRaT5bt_rsJig0A
159059,2011-06-25,0,TqUVH7Ox_3qEkCxCCS_l3Q,"Pros - very food prime rib and surprisingly inexpensive
Cons - Presentation, ambiance, sides

I enjoyed this place. Sure there were a lot of negatives interior is dated, appetizers, mash potatos and sides are so-so, but the service is solid, prime rib is very good (4 - 4 1/2 *'s) and the price outstanding. 

Appetizer
We started with the crab stuffed mushroom caps - don't order them. Crab tastes frozen or canned. Not good for $12

Salad
Cesars Salad - nothing spectacular but it was good. I enjoyed it.

Dinner
Prime rib - Excellent.  (4-4 1/2 *'s) If I had gotten it rare as ordered instead of medium rare, I would have probably given it 5 *'s. 
Mashed potatoes - so-so

Sides
Asparagus - good
Creamed corn - good but a little sweet

No dessert - too full at end of meal

Price - I chuckled when I received the bill. It was much, much cheapr than expected. Only $100 for 5 (86 yo MIL and 93 yo aunt split a meal - no split charge)  also included generous 8 oz 'glass' of  wine for me.

The overall dining experience is 3 *'s - there were a fair amount of negatives but service and the prime rib are excellent and considering the price I gave it 4's

We started out with shaved onion loaf, which was good, then I ordered 22 oz. prime rib (med rare) and my boyfriend ordered the lamb chops. My prime rib was very dry and over cooked and the lamb chops were also dry. We didn't care to order desert. So all in all, I definitely wouldn't recommend this place.

(Sometimes I even make the reservation for 30 mins later than what I tell my fiancé so we can be on time!).

Please don't increase though!!! The place is clean, never has dirty forgotten tables, hostess (usually a manager) is quick to acknowledge and smile at us- welcoming us back and thanking us for dining, food is always hot and bursting with flavor and timing is always perfect. Everything and anything you would want from a restaurant is HERE! Jose Fernando, my hats off to you, cannot wait to see you again and write another review!  Ask for him when you decide to dine, you will not be disappointed!  Although, the place is ran with great pride and love, and I am sure any server will be great!  Jose Fernando- WE LOVE YOU!

276335,2013-05-23,0,TqUVH7Ox_3qEkCxCCS_l3Q,"Had high hopes, but was average at best....

Good hot bread to start. Steak was tough and chewy but had decent flavor, baked potato was huge and pretty good...Salad had dressing that was from a bottle. Lobster was from frozen and not fresh...mashed potatoes tasted like they were instant from a package!

Ordered a chocolate martini and was served some nasty minty drink and returned it....food was not bad for the price, but it was like going to outback pretty much. Also the waitress vanished after she took the order, we has to beg a busser to get more cocktails.

I thought $10.00 for a martini was a bit excessive for a place this far off the strip. 


Might give it another try sometime to see if it is any better, but other ratings here of 4 and 5 stars I think are unrealistic at this point.

2.5 stars here, glorified buffet food is my opinion on this first trip.",U4RVxbj8DxG68fI-qZbZzw,0,0,3,wpQE1C53pbeWDcs_CqOtjA

Service was meh, server didn't really check on us very often, and the place was dead.

This place's biggest flaw is probably its perception: prime rib at the Orleans does not carry the same ""chic"" reputation as a restaurant on the strip. But don't let that hold you back. The service is always very good, and there is not a way you will ever leave hungry.

I've tried both the English cut and Cajun Style (among other items), and both were fantastic - specifically, Cajun style is a personal favorite. Incredibly savory, incredibly satisfying. As if the prime rib alone wasn't enough, I've also tried many of their sides, as well - including the shrimp cocktail and baked potato with choice of toppings. The shrimp cocktail was nothing spectacular, but it's hard for me to find a flaw with any of the food here overall.

My service was fair at best. I may be nitpicking but just the fact that I'm eating a $24 piece of meat and the waiter asks me to keep my salad fork was a little off. Not to mention he only came by a couple of times during our meal and the entrée came out while I was finishing my salad... Like I said thought I'm probably nitpicking at silly things.

The food was fine. Though, Prime Rib is something of a staple in Vegas and this was just average, it is what you would find in any Station Casino cafe. The Garlic Mashed potatoes were terrible in my humble opinion.

So this review is kind of harsh. I think I just might of been expecting more. Go here if you want a Prime Rib and you're already in the Orleans. Don't make a special trip.

Nothing really wrong with it per se, but it was fairly bland and the horseradish was the same fake horsey sauce you get at Arbys.  I paired it with the garlic mash potatoes instead of baked. It was essentially a gummy glop served on a small plate. Ever had Red Lobster's garlic mash potatoes? Tastes exactly the same.

Service was pretty bad. The hostess was really nice, but we waited about 10 mins after being sat for a server to come over, pour us a glass of iceless water and inform us that our server would be with us in a minute. A minute? I guess she meant 10 mins. Finally our ""real"" server showed up, took our order and promptly disappeared for another 20 mins. Finally she brought the grub....and then apparently went on a permanent break. About 20 mins after we finished eating, we had to ask the hostess for our check (we couldn't wait to get out of there, keep reading) Finally, our server reappeared with the check (she's alive!!!) and then....promptly retreated to the back. We never saw her again. After about 10 mins we went back to the hostess to see if she could handle our check (she did). 

All of that would have been bearable if not for this... Unfortunately we were seated right next to a party of 11 middle-aged women having a ""girls night out"". Apparently this party of morons thought they were eating prime rib at a rowdy bar. Remember the tv show ""Roseanne"" and how she would laugh at the end of the opening credits? Multiply that laugh X 11 people, every 5 seconds with the volume turned all the way up. Two tables asked to move to another part of the restaurant and several other people kept covering their ears and looking over their shoulders. Alas, these weren't big enough hints for the clueless  staff to put together and ask the ladies to pipe down.

A shame. It seemed like an otherwise nice place to eat, but I think next time I'll go elsewhere.",uZoEkK-yCrsbKtmCerq55Q,1,0,2,-F_-gBXAGWKOxb6vc_S4lQ

It is a medium-sized, low-ceilinged dining room with an eight-seat bar. Although showing a little wear, it is pleasantly decorated with booths and tables covered in red tablecloths, and the walls are adorned with large murals of band and dance scenes.  The menu is small and heavy on beef dishes.  Indicative of the restaurant's name, the signature food is prime rib.

I recently dined there and had the Orleans Cut, which is 10 oz. of prime rib, accompanied by a chopped lettuce salad and mashed potatoes.  The quality of the meal was satisfactory and the service good.

The ambiance and menu of this restaurant is a throwback to the popular prime rib joints of a bygone era - thick cuts of meat with just passable house salads and vegetables as well as reasonable prices for the food and drinks.

The Prime Rib Loft is not a destination restaurant, but if you find yourself at or near the Orleans Hotel, which is off the Las Vegas Strip, like prime rib, and have a hankering for a decent drink, stop in.",jJmAqgOflbx57NHjuLdQPQ,1,0,3,WlYxBYYKB9uvvKQ3fbDX2A

Pretzel Rolls: Complimentary before the meal. They were okay.. I usually don't like to complain about free stuff, but I'm thinking the ""butter"" they serve is actually margarine. 

Ceasar Salad: The actual salad was ordinary, but I especially liked the crisp parmesan wheel that was served up top. 

Prime Rib: I got the 10oz Orlean's cut (medium-rare), Stephan got the 14oz Gambler's cut (medium-well) both were ordered cajun blackened. The amount of meat generous for the price, and the cajun seasoning was pretty good- a bit spicy, but wayyy too salty. My cut was overcooked to medium, which was fine for me. I flipped my prime rib over and washed away some of the seasoning in the au jus. Stephan liked that it was served in the jus, and not on the side.

Garlic mashed potatoes: A total let down. The potatoes came out of a box; I didn't believe it until I got a chunk of still dehydrated potatoes in my mouth. There was no flavor what-so-ever, and I'm still baffled that a place like this could serve such sub-par side dishes. Get the baked potato instead. 

Service: Sub-par. Stephan counted to 4, the number of times someone looked directly at his glass without refilling. Our server was pretty nonexistent, thankfully our busser took care of the soda refills. 

I was really underwhelmed by this place; the prime rib was good (especially for the price), but I was really disappointed by the service and the lack of selection that offered for side dishes and appetizers.

The beef is dry aged for 21 days in order for the enzymes in the meat to make it more tender and the drying process evaporates the moisture in the meat intensifying the flavor.  

While you wait you get a warm bread basket, but don't eat too much because you want room for the rest of your meal.  I like to have my prime rib barely licked by the flame rare.  The meat comes out thinly sliced, hot and really tender while marinating in a pool au jus.  The waiters are attentive and they bring a toppings cart along with your meal.  You get to tell the waiter how they should dress your potatoes.

Go for the gamblers cut since the meal comes with a soup or salad and a large side of garlic mashed or baked potato.  You're going to be stuffed after the meal so get ready for a massive food coma.",shy_Zu1lK_hU0SGO7IlPqQ,2,2,4,U1CxAgcTkc8zHoJaoAMPtA

Cajun spice was a load of common table salt (!!), some paprika and nothing much else. So the combination of Cajun spiced prime rib? A total disaster.

I was so accustomed to steak dinners for under $20 that I forgot how much restaurants really charge for a good meal.
I have to say it can really smack the happy Vegas frame of mind right out of you.

The Prime Rib Loft is one of the restaurants guilty of distorting the prices of food.

To start, the quality and flavor of meat is nowhere close to The House of Prime Rib.
But for the price, who cares?

But to be fair to The Prime Rib Loft, my meal was comparable to the ones I've had at either Broadway or San Mateo Prime.

I usually get the biggest cut (to the dismay of the wife) and spend the next hour trying to stuff in down my belly (again, to the dismay of the wife).

The meal comes with a salad and choice of two side dishes.
The prime rib is tender and juicy, but it is also a little fatty and in need of more seasoning.

For dessert, I usually ask for another sliver of meat to top me off and was about to make my request when I felt a sharp pain.
It wasn't from my heart but more from my shin.
It was my wife's subtle way of telling me not to even dare.

Overall, 3.5 stars but rounded down since they don't have my requisite super hot horseradish.",vRjVhl3ONG2GfWY4NXJZbQ,14,13,3,0oRz1Ml6ft8vly17G4dWUQ

We wanted to get away from the strip for a quiet relaxing dinner, and indeed that is what we got. The dining room only had about 3 other parties, one of which was a large party. Our male server was extremely attentive although his female helper could have been a little nicer when offering to refill our teas and sodas and could have handled the utensils and dishes a lot more quieter and gentler. 

My boyfriend had been here once before and thoroughly enjoyed his Gamblers Cut (14 oz. $22), medium. This time he said it was tougher than he'd like. The rest of us got the Orleans Cut (10 oz. $18), medium rare, and they all tasted great. The prime rib is served already laying in its own au jus on the plate while the horseradish sauce and sides like sauteed mushrooms (extra charge) and garlic mashed potatoes were on separate small dishes. We each also had the option of soup or salad. The garlic mashed potatoes arrived plain with table-side service to add bacon, chives and sour cream (complementary). It didn't taste like it was out of the box as a previous Yelper stated in their May review, and I actually saw a potato hair or two in it (that's what proves they're real!)...wonder if the restaurant had changed this. 

The only hiccup we had was the steamed clams appetizer we ordered was too salty. I thought my mom was exaggerating or being picky but we all tasted it and agreed it was too unbearable to eat. We sent it back and our server apologized, agreed it was too salty and suggested perhaps they weren't washed properly. He offered to bring out another batch but we chose the fresh grilled artichoke instead - this appetizer was so good we actually ordered two orders! Also almost forgot to add, they serve a basket of delicious bread and whipped butter in the beginning. 

We can't wait to return - great value for the quality of prime rib, and off-strip so that you're away from the dinnertime hustle and bustle.

Service was good, and was typical of one to expect when going to a high end steakhouse. The interior of the Prime Rib Loft was also pretty swank, and a little too dark for my liking. 

The food here was also very good, and the prime rib did not disappoint me one bit. For appetizers, I got the crab stuffed mushroom caps, which was paired with three sauces. It was a decent dish, but I thought it was not worth $12, since the crab taste was not as great as the mushrooms. For the prime rib cut, I got the 14 oz one, and it was seasoned really well and juicy for my liking. The baked potato that came with the prime rib was also good and did not lack any required dressing on it. If you or companion is not a prime rib fan, they also have a pretty good sea bass dish and it tasted fresh.

The ambiance is pleasant- I liked that it's almost like a loft & feels separated from the casino. 3 of my g.f.'s were all over the beef selections & made their choices fairly quickly; however, the 2 of us who didn't go the beef route had a hard time with the 4 alternate options. I'm on a pretty restrictive diet right now (it's totally raining on my yelpventuring parade, by the way!) so it was frustrating to almost fear I'd be eating bread & a side of garlic mashed potatoes. Thank goodness I put my big girl pants on & decided on the bourbon chicken... because the bread was mediocre (soft, yes. but that's it.) & a monkey could make better garlic mashed potatoes (watery? where exactly does the garlic factor in? if my BBQ sauce hadn't dripped onto them, they'd have been bland.) My entrée came with a salad that was just ok. The tomatoes were diced & the red onions were sliced paper thin; nothing to get nitpicky about except that they contributed to the salad being almost soggy. I didn't super care for the cut of chicken but the sauce was incredible (I've been eating pop tarts, potato-anything & Panera Bread, since I've been sick, so their bourbon sauce made my tastebuds smile!). Also, while it's a tad too salty, I highly enjoyed their whipped butter- it gave the bread, potatoes & green beans much needed flavor. The girls who got beef all enjoyed their dishes, along with my partner in poultry crime who got the marsala. The service was satisfactory, no complaints. Overall, I'd go there again...

Most places at least will grant you a small birthday dish of ice cream. We will not be back.",nBJ2GCMxiYu-F1ATV3aC7g,3,0,2,GIo3I07Cb11yugakZ3-kzQ

When I was in Vegas I wanted a good, substantial, reasonably priced prime rib, and I got it at the loft. I'm sure, there's better prime ribs in the world, but if you want high quality, bang for your buck, I recommend this place. Here's a cut and paste from their menu.

Roast Prime Rib
Featuring our 21 Day Dry Aged Prime Rib of Beef
To insure the highest quality and tenderness we dry age our prime ribs on property,
season with sea salt and cracked pepper then slow-roast for your dining pleasure.
The Orleans Cut
$ 17
10 oz. of our most popular cut
The Gamblers Cut
$21
14 oz. sliced thick for your pleasure
The Beefeater Cut
$28
24 oz. for the serious beef eater. Served bone-on

I got the beefeater, and it was fantastic, but couldn't finish it. My wife got the gambler, and she couldn't finish it. My father in law got the chicken, he liked it, but it was a weird choice. Anyways, nothing bad to say, good stuff.",38cgt11QdCnWnSnz19I63g,1,0,5,H5AGZpb6RCD65n0IPvZrOA

Having never been to the Orleans Casino I was a little skeptical with it being out of the way and off the Strip or downtown. We drove over and the casino itself was pretty crowded. We walked in and went the wrong way and found another restaurant that served Prime Rib for a near identical price. The name of this restaurant didn't sound familiar so we walked in the opposite direction. From the outside it looked really expensive. We looked at the menu and decided to go up. We were seated after waiting about 10 minutes without a reservation, even though there were several open tables. 
The pricing is fair. We decided on the Seafood appetizer and the Beefeater Cut with mashed potatoes and a Caesar Salad to share. The salad was a little skimpy but had good flavor. The Seafood Appetizer was also very good. When the Prime Rib arrived the meat was perfectly cooked medium rare with a slight amount of fat. The peppercorn crust made the meat very tasty with the horseradish sour cream and the Au Jus. 
My only complaint is the water that is suppose to be some special water (don't remember the name of the water) but appeared to be recycled bottles that are refilled by the wait staff.

As usual, the best prime rib in town for under $50 a plate.  Must order Bone In (BeefEater Cut) and Cajun Blackened.  The Blackened makes your order naturally come out 1 degree more done than you order, so if you like medium rare prime rib, order rare.

They have upgraded the stemware and the wine list, points I had noted in prior reviews through the casino surveys and on yelp.  Bravo.  Its the Orleans, so its not ultra high end fine dining, but its good food at great prices, with a decent atmosphere.  Tough to beat. 

If you like prime rib, you really need to try the cajun rubbed bone in.  Its just amazing.  Comes with a salad and a potato.  The ""loaded"" baked potato is prepared tableside, a nice touch.

I discover the hidden Prime Rib Loft. You take stairs from the casino floor up to, well, a loft. Thus is the Prime Rib Loft. A kind of dark restaurant hidden away in an off strip casino. However, due to the location, you get to stare at the Orleans' creepy faux Mardis Gras float heads as you dine. I wish I would have taken a picture to share - it's almost surreal. 

The food: as you can tell by the name this is a vegan restaurant. Not a single dead animal on the menu - nawh, just kidding. The name says it all. A basic dinner: a salad (I had the Cesar - not bad), a decent cut of beef, and your choice of baked or mashed. It's not great but it's solid. It's what you expect. That's never a bad thing! 

The wine list was surprisingly good considering the restaurant. I had a by the glass Malbec that went well with the beefy dinner. The only actual disappointment of the night was the dessert - the cheesecake was a bit dry and tasteless. Oh well, it's not called the Cheesecake Loft is it? 

Also, the prices are quite reasonable. 

Bottom line: is it worth a $20 taxi ride from the strip? No. But if you happen to be in the Orleans - it's a pretty good meal at a reasonable price!",LbtFyFzsdt-d2XDlIGVsaQ,0,0,3,HJ0rq4o90iQeYxn8lkd9FQ

Now I'm not a big yelper but I wanted to reach out somehow to the loft in hopes that things will change for the better. 

Change is what they have done. They've changed the decor from the dark and misty cellar ambiance you'd find in a steak house in New Orleans to a bright, less authentic, setting. 

After the initial shock of he decor change I brushed it off because the food is awesome and my favorite dish in this town is their Oscar filet. Not only was the filet removed from the menu but there was not a filet period. 

The menu used to be a sturdy book menu that you'd find in traditional steak houses but this was replaced with a thin paper menu that totally took away from the luxury. 

The bread- petty I know but I love carbs- was different and transferred from delicious buttery rolls to bread sticks. Again, luxury removed. 

Lastly, the carb fan inside me again emerges, mashed potatoes were not offered where they traditionally had been. I'm sorry- when I go to a steak house I want masked potatoes. Instead baked and au gratin were offered which is strange considering mashed potatoes are cheaper for the house to make. 

In short- the loft used to be an amazing place to eat if you wanted to spend a little more on a popular local haunt.

Asparagus fries were $8.50 for 5 fries. Best tasting  part of the entire meal but way too small of a portion. 

House salad looked like it came out a stale bag of lettuce from the dollar general, with a huge slop of ranch dressing on top. There was about 6x the amount of dressing needed. All either of us could taste was ranch dressing. It was actually really good dressing but that's beside the point. 

Baked potato was lukewarm and the server put so much butter and sour cream I couldn't taste anything else. Au gratin potatoes looked like they had been sitting all night on the warmer and my girlfriend had one bite before refusing their brown cheesey garbage again. 

Both of our cuts (Gamblers + Cajun) were extremely fatty and nothing to write home about. I'd estimate about 1/3 of each was pure fat and thrown out. We recently dry aged some prime rib roast at home for 3 days and it was amazing. These 21 day dry aged cuts didn't have anywhere near the flavor of what we made at home in 3 days. 

When we were clearly ready to get boxed up, our server and his assistant went to the back and mysteriously vanished. Waited about 8 mins before the manager asked if we wanted to get boxed up and we could finally get the hell out of there.

The good: there's no shortage of beef when you order the prime rib. It's a tad chewy compared to what you might find closer to the Strip, but it does come out to order

The ambiance in the room is that of a Holiday Inn dining room. It's low-roller nice, not high-roller nice, and service is good but not that of a fine dining restaurant (which this really isn't.) The same music playing in the casino plays overhead, complete with announcements about slot tournaments and the Players Club.

But they're not charging Strip fine dining prices for the experience of parking your car yourself and walking past the TGI Friday's and Fuddruckers in the casino to get here either.

The restaurant has a full bar, but there is only a wine and beer list available at the table, so no mention of specialty cocktails.  When our waiter arrived he was unshaven and dour.  When I asked if they could make a Bahama Mama (a fairly common rum cocktail), the waiter stared blankly and said he'd never heard of it.  He did inquire and they were able to make the drinks, but our waiter never once smiled or engaged us in any way other than the most perfunctory of requests required to get our orders.  Basically, his attitude was a wet blanket on what otherwise would have been a really fine meal.  While I can eagerly recommend the restaurant, I would also request other seating if this guy was ever our server again.",KKZjXdm4tYtqTXHfI5PQuA,1,0,4,om3uHrAn7SuCES1trZ5fwg

The atmosphere is very nice, the murals fit with the general feel of The Orleans. Prime rib isn't my first choice so I had the New York strip. Maybe this is where I went wrong. If you are looking at patronizing this restaurant I would lower your expectations. Think: less steakhouse, more Applebees.
The salad was typical of a house salad: watery lettuce and a few olives. No big deal, it's to be expected at a steakhouse.
The steak itself was very dry. The server asked us if needed A1. This should have been a red flag. A good steak should never require any additional seasoning. The steak was cooked medium and had the appropriate amount of coloring. Taste itself was pretty bland and disappointing. It needed some pepper or basic seasoning. It seemed to me that the steak was finished cooking before other people's and they left it under the heat lamp too long. Unacceptable, especially at the price. I really love the mashed potato cart, it's rare to find restaurants that still do this.
Overall, I would say the atmosphere is good but the quality is disappointing. The service was decent but if they got busy I would worry. There are so many great steakhouses in this town, this place is not one of them.",eISOiIHotFoEvwgxUddsNg,0,0,3,6q23AELnO5ok7wYZwf5sSQ
3281389,2011-12-22,0,TqUVH7Ox_3qEkCxCCS_l3Q,"The Prime Rib Loft at the Orleans Casino
The Prime Rib Loft exemplifies attention to detail, something sadly overlooked in many restaurants nowadays. From the moment you ascend the gracefully curving stairway to the dining room, you are subtly soothed and relaxed, likely without even being aware of the cause. From the calming patterns of the flagstones set in the walls of the stairwell to the subdued red teardrop shaped lamps lighting the hand painted Jazz Band murals lining the walls you find the stresses of life and that tenseness of your posture slowly easing and a relaxed smile brightening your visage. For those desiring it, one wall of the dining room offers a lofty vantage of the main casino floor, allowing the diners to remain aloof from the noise and bustle yet still enjoy the ebb and flow of the vibrant casino life. I was pleased to note that I could not detect even the faintest hint of cigarette smoke despite my location above the casino, a credit to the architects or interior designers in my opinion.   

After being seated by the charming hostess, I was immediately offered a glass of water kept constantly full from unique styled bottles rather than the standard, boring pitcher. The water hadn't the slightest hint of chemical taint so often found in public restaurants. Along with the water, I was treated to a basket of fresh, hot rolls, one type of which was a delicious pretzel bread and a ramekin of soft, sweet whipped butter.

Finding myself relaxed, at ease and feeling decidedly pampered, my server Jose arrived to inquire if I would like to order. He skillfully assisted me in narrowing my choices to the exact correct meal with the perfect choice of wine.

I have to assume the blue cheese dressing for my salad was crafted in house as it had the perfect blend of creamy dressing to blue cheese crumbles, creamy and flavorful without being overpowering. The salad had a nice blend of color with a clever flatbread garnish and a chilled salad fork.

Jose displayed his superior skills by not hovering but being readily available and, most importantly, his timing, delivering my entrée after I had completely finished my salad and had a few moments for it to settle. Again, this is something many people seem to be oblivious to, but I greatly respect. Having my meal unceremoniously dumped in front of me when I am half done with my salad, soup or appetizer, in my opinion, displays both discourtesy and a lack of experience or skill. Among other things, it makes me feel rushed and leaves me deciding if I wish to waste half my salad or attempt to enjoy cold food.

The prime rib was absolutely perfect! Done exactly as I requested, coated with an incredible blackened seasoning with a delightful bite to it and containing exactly enough fat to ensure a marvelous flavor and meat that is moist and tender, without leaving an enormous clump of fat as is so common with lower grades of prime rib. The au jus was obviously fresh and well made, light and flavorful, not the thick, dark, salty liquid I can only assume comes from a can that is so commonly provided. 

The reasonably priced domestic Merlot suggested by Jose was the absolute perfect complement to the dinner!

A flawless experience is rare in the extreme, and I have to admit that in this case, I found the garlic mashed potatoes moderately uninspiring with little noticeable garlic flavor. The baked potato may have been a preferable choice, though I would honestly have preferred it if replacing the starch with a vegetable selection had been an option. Ala carte vegetable dishes were available for additional cost (and I should note that I found the price of the prime rib extremely reasonable at less than twenty dollars) but with the popularity of low-carb diets, I would think replacing the starch portion would be an option. 

For the perfect finish to the meal, I chose the daily dessert option, which today was Black Forest Cake. Fortuitously, this is one of my favorite desserts and I was not disappointed in the slightest. This was served with a modest chocolate syrup drizzle for a garnish, not swimming in a pool like many places. The cake had a perfect moist, puddingy texture. 

In summary, what would have been a delicious dinner transcended into the realm of a dining experience purely as a result of the details. The attentive, friendly staff, the ambiance, the timing, the chilled salad fork, the water in bottles, the softened butter; these are the things that exemplify a quality restaurant over the common corporate eateries. In a state of near reverence from the dining experience, I took the time to speak with the manager, Susan, and compliment both Jose's outstanding service and her obviously skillful management. It was the service above and beyond the normal that prompted me to write this review.",Xpkz9sv0W71NEnBhOGBevA,0,0,5,5dm4XV3uqYP4vtpzivYSLg

If your reading this your probably hungry and looking for a good place to eat. So the question your asking is this place any good. The food is okay. The prime rib was a bit too dry and bland. Still eatable. The baked potato was AMAZING. Sadly that's all I have to say because I had a horrible, embarrassing experience here and I invite you to read my experience at ""The Prime Rib Loft"". 

THE NOT SO GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY

GETTING A TABLE: I dinned here with my family a party of 6 on Saturday at around 8:30 on a not so busy night. So getting a table won't be a problem, we were seated right away after our reservation was honored.


SERVICE - Let me start by saying I work at a restaurant here in Las Vegas, so I have the experience and knowledge to recognize good or bad service. Our experience at this restaurant was overall: disappointing. 

Our server took her sweet time in greeting us, taking drink orders and finally 30 minutes later the dinner order. Ok no problem, no need to be rushed. Suddenly I noticed we were being ignored by out server. Refills were not handled at a reasonable time, and salads took more then expected to arrive. The busser/food server assistant was the only professional worker there. Finally after probably 30 more minutes after our salad our dinner arrived and by then, our party lost their appetite after feeling neglected after waiting so much. The manager was not helpful at all. There was a prime rib at our table that was served warm, so we flagged the manager and we asked him why did our dinner take so long? They replied with one of the most stupid excuses, ""because we are busy"". I've learned that this excuse it's irrelevant to the guest, it doesn't fix the problem it only makes the guest feel like a dumbass! After that the manager failed BIG time! He brought out a smaller prime rib and I told my friend, ""didn't you order a larger cut?"" 

So enough was enough, I was disappointed and embarrassed that the manger and waiter couldn't rise to the challenge at making the rest of our dinner outshine their mistakes. The manager comped a few things and never offered a dessert menu. Sucks because we were celebrating a 60th birthday, and we told them twice! 

I walked out embarrassed at receiving one of the most dullest, laziest customer experiences. Thankfully the food wasn't half bad. 

To conclude I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to anyone. I know it's located at The Orleans and you shouldn't expect greatness. But can I ask you ""The Prime Rib Loft"" to put a smile on, and give better service and to turn on some music, lol. Everyone here looked like they didn't want to work.

This recent Thanksgiving 2014 trip, bro and I were going to go to Gallagher's or some other fancy steak place, until a good friend told me to try this place at the Orleans. We were not disappointed. The price point was reasonable - the meal included salad, sides, and necessary sauces. I got the 1.5 lb prime rib medium rare and bro the 14 oz. NY steak. The prime rib is gargantuan of pure reddish beef, not too salty, just tender and flavorful. I took the bone home to trim and give to Fido for his enjoyment. Au jus is just the right amount of saltines, nothing too salty or bland. Creamy horseradish sauce a delectable accent, and the garlic mashed potatoes were plentiful and unique. I did not even eat all of the mashed potatoes. I got to try some NY steak and at medium, it had a great char and tender flavor. I would have ordered it med.-rare if I ordered it, but bro likes it a bit more done. Nonetheless, the steak is a true NY steak and aged well.

At this place, a prime rib is a prime rib, and a NY steak is a NY steak -- why state the obvious you ask? Because in my other review of Sam's Town Firelight buffet, they were passing off prime rib AS NY steak. I thought it was really funny that they do so. Therefore, I add pictures here so there can be no doubt which is which.

A big filling meal for two big guys, just under $60 before tip (no alcohol)...cannot go wrong. Very close to THE Steak House in Circus Circus in value, taste, and presentation, although, we missed the charming accent of the attractive and shapely Eastern European hostess at THE Steak House.

Décor was New Orleans style, kinda old school, but the place was large enough and since we went on a Monday evening, quiet. Service was impeccable and prompt. As far as value for this price point, here in Vegas, it cannot be beat. Next time when we raise the price point a notch or two, then that's a different level of comparison.

Try this place! We were not steered wrong (no pun intended), just an honestly-priced place for pure beef.",9LX0aIyVbmhfEjqJEbt4ZA,2,1,5,UPupjEM3ludoy_a6VQac4Q

The Orleans cut is 10 oz and the Gamblers Cut is 14 oz.  They also have a gigantic 24 oz on the bone if you have a hearty appetite. Our server said the Gambler's Cut is the most popular.  Overall I thought the prime rib was tender and juicy  (au jus on the platter); they also give you a large side of horseradish which complements the meat. I don't know what 21-day aged prime rib tastes like?  But that is their claim! Their servers serve everything on a rolling cart with silver covered platters.  It is pretty old school, but it works. 

Funny, but their Chambord berries and vanilla ice cream was a delicious dessert that was a large serving. There were a few servers helping our area and they were all pleasant and worked at a steady pace.   Every few mins we'd see a rolling cart go by and it seems they have system down.

We were greeted warmly and seated immediately at a both.  The mellow and upscale ambience felt soothing, and our efficient server Donna took our orders as soon as warm rolls and butter hit the table.

Our shared appetizer came out fast, but started the meal off SO badly:

Lump Crab Stuffed Mushroom Caps ($12) - 5 deep fried balls served on inedible green leaves of some sort, on top of a bed of crispy rice noodles.  Dijon mustard, some kind of creamy sauce, and warm marinara came alongside.  Talk about an identity crisis!  

The mushroom inside the thick fried coating hid under a ball of salty, dry crabmeat.  None of the sauces made any sense at all, nor did they taste good - alone or with the mushroom.

It was so awful that when I told the busser, he sent the manager over.

When I repeated to the manager how awful and dry the shrooms were, he looked down, picked up the plate with the remaining 2 mushrooms, and literally slunk away without a single word of apology or offer to take it off the bill or replace it with something else.  It was a very strange reaction, especially for a manager level person, and we were left pretty much speechless by his odd wordlessness.

When Donna came back with dinner salads for me and Friend #2 and a Jambalaya soup for Friend #1 (they came with our meals), she did apologize for the awful appetizer, which was the first proper acknowledgement we had for it.  Maybe DONNA should be the manager - as she had way better communication skills than their actual one.

Salads were basic - iceberg, red onion, sliced cucumber and diced tomatoes.  The soup of the day was the Jambalaya, which it didn't resemble in chunkiness, and the flavor was totally unimpressive to me.  Both came with a Cheez-It-tasting cracker that was mildly entertaining.

Dinner finally looked up when our entrees arrived:

Me: The Gambler's Cut ($19) - a 14 oz cut of prime rib, rare, with steamed green beans and carrot julienne instead of the mashed or baked potato choice.  My meat was perfectly rare, perfectly fatty, super juicy, flavorful without being overly salty, and the creamy horseradish that came with was great!  The veggies were good too - tender and skinny green beans, still al dente.

Friend #1: The Beefeater Cut ($25) - this 22 oz bone-in MONSTER was a gorgeous hunka meat!  Same meat as mine, only bigger!  My friend got a huge baked potato to go with, and Donna served him sour cream, butter, bacon bits and chives from her serving cart.

Friend #2: The Orleans Cut ($16) - my friend requested this 10 oz prime rib grilled, and Donna didn't bat one lash when taking her order.  It came out with nice grill marks, and still perfectly medium rare as she likes it.

Since we were rushing off to a show, we didn't have time for dessert.  But if I erase all memory of the stuffed mushroom appetizer, I would be open to returning for just the prime rib in the future - and definitely try their Bananas Foster dessert!",SIZOfo7jTjCXnL8ZtpM2aw,10,9,3,CkshxSLymc9ooAfCawVaoA

To us it was okay because we are in the mood for prime rib.  

We ordered the southwestern spring rolls.  They are very good.  It came with an avocado and chipotle sauce that was very tasty.  My boyfriend has a salad and I had the chicken orzo soup.  The salad is a salad, and the soup was good.  

We both ordered the gamblers cut prime rib. Come from the Midwest, my expectations for prime rib in the west coast wasn't very high.  I would rate the prime rib 7/10. So it's above average.

You go up these stairs to a loft area overlooking the casino. There was a mix-up on my reservation but it didn't matter since the place was empty at 9 pm the Monday before Christmas. I was seated in a comfortable booth.  

 I started out with a good martini, then a non-descript house salad with fresh warm rolls.  The main course was the ""Gamblers Cut"" 14 oz. prime rib, with a fresh grilled artichoke with lemon aioli dipping sauce, and  garlic mashed potatoes.  The beef, which I ordered medium rare, was thick, tender, and uniformly pink. The artichoke was grilled but still juicy, the potatoes suitably garlicky.

The meal was reasonably priced. I paid with player club points. Service was attentive but nonintrusive. Overall it was a relaxing experience before I hit the tables again.",qw6w0dLPA6miMjcCAWc7BQ,3,0,4,EyEscYVqL0MfHy6VLrMwBg
3970171,2016-11-11,11,TqUVH7Ox_3qEkCxCCS_l3Q,"I really like this place.  I liked it when it was a dark and I like it now with the lighter, upbeat looking decor.  Since prime rib is only on the higher priced buffets, one must search it out at other restaurants.  The Prime Rib Loft fits the bill nicely.  Boyd sent me a food voucher good at four of their properties.  Prime Rib Loft came to mind immediately.

I made a reservation for 5:30 so I had plenty of time for dinner before going to a play at Las Vegas Little Theatre in Chinatown.

I was seated as soon as I arrived and I had a view of the entire restaurant.  At first, the place was very quiet.  Soon, as more people arrived, the energy level picked up and with it the sound but it was never a bother.

I wanted to get the four onion soup but when you get one of their prime rib meals, with it comes corn showier or house salad and either baked or au gratin potatoes.  It's odd you can';t substitute because both soups are the same price.  The option given to me by my server, Rudy, was that I could order the onion soup à la carte and then get a salad.  I didn't go for that.  Too much food.  I ordered the Orleans cut prime rib--their smallest at 10 ounces--the corn chowder, and the baked potato.  He asked me if I wanted it loaded and I said yes.  Butter, sour cream, bacon bits, and chives.  For dessert I got Oreo cookie cheesecake which isn't on their printed menu.  The menu says to look for their daily dessert cart special and this was it for the day I was there.

I was brought a small bread basket.  I was so glad they downsized the amount for one person.  There's nothing I dislike more than waste.  I can always ask for more.  My iced tea was brought quickly and was refilled often.

The corn chowder was blisteringly hot which is good and which was good.  I got some freshly ground pepper on top.  There was plenty of time to slowly eat the hot soup without being rushed with an early arrival of prime rib.  That just didn't happen.  Rudy kept an eye on me and put the prime rib order in at the right time.

I had ordered the rib the rarest they had.  It was rare and it was very tasty.  Before starting, there was a small show table side.  The baked potatoes are on a cart pushed to your table where your server puts in the items you selected.  

The meal was very enjoyable and all plates were clean of food when I finished.  After Rudy gave me dessert choices and I picked the Oreo cookie cheesecake, he brought it to the table.  A good size serving and very tasty!  A very nice ending to a good meal.

Service was excellent while I was there.  The table was patrolled for empty sweetener packs and the staff was polite and helpful.

I will be back with or without Boyd food vouchers.  (People at Boyd--disregard that sentence!!!)",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,24,16,4,pnO4H5CJSKsO7slO0WgLlA

My husband had the filet Oscar, beef medallions topped with crab, asparagus and bearnaise sauce, and it was cooked perfectly. I had the top sirloin - very good. The garlic mashed potatoes are a favorite of ours and they didn't disappoint, especially with their yummy house gravy (you have to ask for it.) 
We had a comp and we were paying the rest with a credit card. Our server insisted we fill out the credit card slip before he ran our card - he said to just subtract the amount of our comp.

It came out more as a medium, but that's close enough. The menu claimed that there was an $8 dish splitting fee, and they didn't charge us for that, but the fact that it was inscribed in the menu bothered me.

They didn't have an explicit combination platter, so we had to spend an additional $20 for an 8oz lobster tail!

1. That's expensive. I get that Las Vegas is a little speckle of a city in the middle of a giant desert, but still.

5050034,2010-08-08,2,TqUVH7Ox_3qEkCxCCS_l3Q,"So mom and grandma in law wanted prime rib. The BF has been before and had a pretty good comped meal here so we head to the Loft instead of the usual buffets where they like to go.  The decor is dancing and musicians signatures and pictures on the wall. The food is rolled out onto carts so it has the very ""old world"", kinda dated way of doing things. It is a appropriate place to bring the parentals, grandparents, etc. I dunno, it just gave me that vibe and most of the other diners are older couples or middle adult groups. 

Salad is pretty standard iceberg with some onions, cherry tomatoes and cucumbers, but all the veggies were fresh and crisp. They serve warm bread and butter that were pretty decent with a crisp outside and doughy inside.

Prime rib is the game so we all grabbed that. I think the prime rib was good- mine was juicy, tender and the right amount of fat on the rim. I got garlic mashed potatoes for my side- good garlic flavor but not much else. It needed more butter to make it creamier and it wasn't seasoned, but nothing a little salt and pepper I added myself couldn't cure. We ordered a side of the broccoli with beer cheese sauce. The sauce was good, but for everyone they wanted the broccoli cooked more. I like my vegetables a bit more crisp so I ate it up. Veggies were a big complaint of the table- mom in law was specially bummed that there's no creamed spinach, but we all love it so it was a big hitch for us. I would think that's a pretty standard accompaniment for prime rib but they only had broccoli, creamed corn, or mushrooms. I would think creamed spinach would fly out more than corn if they switched them. 

We got a bananas foster to share. Good flavors, but needs a lot more ice cream....most the ice cream was melted and not enough to go around to break up that strong, very sweet Foster's sauce. 

Service was pretty decent...we got refills and were checked on. We didn't wait on food too long. 

 I get why people like this place. Is it the absolute best prime rib available in Vegas? No, but you can't beat $14-22 for a slab with potato and soup/salad.  I feel you get good quality for your buck. It probably is one the better prime rib you can get in this price range and the best that Vegas has will be double the price. 4 people for $88 bucks is not bad at all. I don't know if this would be some place I'd go to that often...normally I would just go up a notch and get the best, but it was nice to try this. I left satisfied enough for what we paid and I guess that's what matters.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,3,3,4,dX1ZjZO42p98LwFWxmLBUQ

Food was meh at best. Started with the artichoke crab dip appetizer. Came out quickly and with with only enough bread for about a third of the dip.  Had to ask twice for additional bread.  Hubby and I both had a salad.  Came with a entire slice of raw onion.  Inedible no reason to be on the salad. Cucumbers were not peeled,came with skin on, bitter....I had the 10oz cut of prime rib and added the lobster tail and chose the baked potato.  The beef was a bit over cooked for medium rare and not hot.  True to that cut of beef, very fatty and seasoned with large pieces of cracked pepper which made it incredibly terrible to eat if you bit into one.  The epic fail was the lobster tail.  It was so over cooked and was not one but two very small tails. Bottom line for $130 meal head to Lawry's where they specialize in prime rib and seem to have it figured out.",Z7Gs2qCOkILyP_kSjWI7bw,0,0,2,BpyRxli3i1hk0A5UoiKZkg

My ex and I would always come in here and order the same thing- the 24 oz. cajun style bone-in prime rib TO SPLIT... for $24. And the kicker? Aside from the requisite bread basket (which was just OK) It normally comes with potato of choice (baked w/ all the fixings or french fries), vegetable and horseradish + side salad but every time we went and ordered it to split, they would split the potato between us, still give us a ton of fixings, AND give us our own side salads! Very nice service too. 

The salads and potato aren't out of the ordinary, but they are simple, complete and done well, and the ambience is ""upscale casual"" (not even exactly dressy) but for the price (at about a little over $24 for the meal, we both just had iced water) we each got 12 oz. of meltingly tender, juicy, deliciously seasoned prime rib, a good size portion of potato and our own side salads.

came by for the boys steak dinner for March Madness. staying at the Rio but took the Gold Coast shuttle to here. very nice way to save cab money.

located at the far end of the casino floor, it's situated a top the floor with a great view of the gaming. surprisingly not busy during MM and spring break. got seated rather quickly and had the drinks coming shortly thereafter. the staff were very attentive and pleasant. the layout of the place is very classic, red velvet teeming from most parts of the restaurant.

very fair price for the bottle of Merlot that we ordered. even better pricing for the menu selections. i ordered the Beefeater. i wasn't messing around. at $27 for 24oz, it is a STEAL! almost half the price of Lawry's. i had initially thought that the quality would be sacrificed because of the price. boy, was i wrong. that cut of meat, on the bone, with the au jus was PERFECT. PERFECT i said! sooo mother effing good. i asked for green bean subsitution so as to make more room for the meat monolith. i ordered it medium and it was juicy and tender. they provide complimentary sourcream and horseradish which totally excentuates the flavors of the prime rib. damn, i can still taste it.

We both got the garlic mashed potatoes as a side, and they were also really good.  You can see the roasted garlic swirled throughout, and of course we ate those parts first!  

As for dessert, we got the chocolate fondue.  It was thicker than what I was hoping for (they just melt chocolate chips....) but it wasn't horrible.

The tableside potato prep and the chilled bottled water just adds to the experience. I always get the prime rib and I'm never disappointed. I have dined here with a variety of people who have ordered a variety of entree options and all have agreed they have nothing to complain about just compliments. 
I can't help but mention the cost.... I don't mind at all any amount of money for a memorable meal BUT if you can get a great memorable meal for a fraction of the cost of the celebrity steakhouses on the strip  and you aren't walking away still hungry this place is a fantastic value. Menu items are cheaper than some big box stores that aren't nearly as good and certainly don't have the old school vibe. 
Though the Orleans is off the strip sister casino resorts on the strip offer a free shuttle or a taxi ride is only about 6-8$ The casino is older but still large and very lively so an after dinner stroll through the casino and maybe funky NOLA inspired cocktail before or after a nice dinner really rounds your visit out and makes the trek off the strip worth it!!",_7H26ZwyiUe4gpn9AoCECg,2,0,5,bJzGaRkq8MsyHtPcAuLxvA

The flavor burst in my mouth with each bite of the succulent cajun spices smothered over prime rib excites me beyond belief, I should have really had a towel to sit on, eh hem....really a jean soaking experience to me lol. I always order the cajun style prime rib, nothing like it around I must say! This is another restaurant where in my experience during my meal I am once again finding myself moaning without control.

This place is great, my complete meal runs $14 bucks, a slab of cajun style prime rib, soup or salad and choice of side, giant baked, or roasted garlic mashed taters! A steal of a deal for such awesome flavor! Plus pre-meal bread is provided to snack on! Also ice cold complimentary imported bottled water served tableside wine style! A nice classy touch :) So is a good time to get your fill of water! Afterall your skin and kidney's are counting on you! They have the freshest salad you will ever have the opportunity to stuff in your mouth! A killer Ranch dressing I just can't keep my composure when I am finger licking my bowl, every last drop! This is no lie!

This place is dark and romantic and is located upstairs overlooking the casino. A great place for a fun date, really anytime!

5857986,2016-04-22,0,TqUVH7Ox_3qEkCxCCS_l3Q,Took my mother here for her birthday dinner as it is pretty hard to find a steakhouse that has prime rib that's not too far off the strip. My New York steak came out medium well and extremely charred when I had ordered medium. Server immediately apologized and offered to get me a new one. My mother got the New Orleans prime rib which she absolutely loved. Our server was awesome!,cdSYzf9huIgYaRx7wHyhWg,0,0,4,NFGlFe2y68mSVjdyarIvBQ
5875937,2015-12-11,0,TqUVH7Ox_3qEkCxCCS_l3Q,The prices are great. Staff is wonderful. Atmosphere is very relaxing. I love this place it is the second time I have been here and each time I get the Cajun style beef eater which is absolutely wonderful. My wife feels the same and swears by the steaks. I've already told at least 6 of my friends about this place five stars to this restaurant along with the casino that is awesome,_Lh-pOke6f8p_lCu_hU-0Q,0,0,5,lxQUrsKp9rIoZwBzPBMSNQ
5876914,2012-04-02,0,TqUVH7Ox_3qEkCxCCS_l3Q,"The GF was in the mood for primerib and I figured a place with prime rib in its name has to serve great prime rib but she wasnt impressed. Complained it wasnt cooked the way she ordered it. That didnt stop her from wolfing it down and looking at my plate though.

I had the steak medallions and they WERE top notch. Cooked to a perfect medium rare. We split the stuffed mushrooms and they were great.

A rather robust couple well over 3bills each ordered prime rib at the table next to us and when their food came out the server asked if they needed anything else and in the greatest hick voice they asked for ketchup, mayo and A1 sauce. The server was so confused! At a  place like this one the chefs earn their reputation and you are going to ask for ketchup mayo and a1 for prime rib? 

We laughed about it all night!",Yg08tRMxm0eaL-rXyNIAHw,0,0,5,42XRe9mOcPWfcc1RHV6Ykw
5889630,2016-10-09,0,TqUVH7Ox_3qEkCxCCS_l3Q,This place is amazing. Randomly ended up here one night and now it will be a usual. Rudy our server did not skip a beat. He took amazing care of us. All the staff was great and the prime rib was perfect!,E6Hecy3vMShBy-f3zK9BuA,0,0,5,0XtaQ3Hc1gfSmBOKhU8Lug
5890674,2013-03-21,0,TqUVH7Ox_3qEkCxCCS_l3Q,"No thanks to our server, we will be back.

The food was very good.  Although my husband did regret getting the super large size prime rib (he orders it medium rare, and it came out pretty cold).  I had the sea bass, and it was quite good.  Next time, I will ask to have the sauce on the side though.  It had a nice flavor, but masked the taste of the fish.

Our server....was awful.  We ordered appetizers that never arrived, because he forgot to put them in.  He was not attentive to refills, nor did he come back to check on how our food was, etc.  Also, when we ordered dessert, my sister got hers first, and had to start eating it (because it had ice cream).  She was completely done and my husband and I hadn't received ours yet.

The busser was quite attentive, definitely filling in where the server was lacking, and was given a separate cash tip handed to him, as we very much appreciated his service.  Our server only got 10% - sorry, but if you provide bad service, your tip will go down accordingly.  Then he had the nerve to complain to the manager about his low tip, within our earshot.  We went over and informed the manager of exactly WHY his tip was so low.

Again, despite the poor server, we will be back.  We just hope José isn't our server again, and if he is, we will request a different one.",ER4VikNscGAqk8O2pX61WQ,5,0,4,kQKnkwCYeLNpJTQFv2byMw

Made reservations for Saturday evening and of course, as soon as we arrived, we were seated right away.  I ordered the Caesar Salad and the English Cut of the Prime Rib.  Everything was just outstanding and the next time I'm in the area, I will be sure to drop by for dinner.",IhY66GZIeA9jTjwPRVhpLQ,2,0,4,ScBOOVyFl65oY6qAAEQH4g

This place is in a Sam Boyd casino so temper your expectations for a 5 star dining experience. I have nothing against Sam Boyd casinos I just want to be real about it. 

When you walk into the Loft, you feel like you are walking into a spendy michelin rated restaurant BUT it's classic looks are deceiving... You are walking into an classy cafeteria. 

The good
Can't beat the price. At $29.99 for a large cut prime rib meal it's a great deal. 

The meh:
The bread was hard and a bit stale. I'm not a snob but serving warm bread is almost an expectation when ""dining fancy.""

The food presentation was very room service-esque. All of the entrees came with service lids pulled at the table. 
Props to the tableside baked potato dressing.. I think that this is one of the few places that still does this... 


At $29.99 for a large cut of prime rib, it does the job. It's the little things that detract from the experience.",E_Ts8j758tpiAZknHR7k4g,4,2,3,SEShY-P3oNtXgks7RKnCJQ

5938737,2015-09-27,0,TqUVH7Ox_3qEkCxCCS_l3Q,"This place is a hidden gem when it comes to prime rib!
I always order the 24 oz bone in prime rib, cooked to medium rare with mash potatoes...and sides of asparagus and mushrooms.
$28 for the 24 oz prime rib is a bargain....and delicious to boot!
I also order a bottle of their Mondavi house Cabernet wine (under $20) to wash down my meal.
The final outcome to this great meal is...there is never any room left for dessert!
I always bring out of towners here to eat when it comes to prime rib.
