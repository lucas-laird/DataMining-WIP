65618,2013-06-21,2,6bYgKI5JaQmS2xDoofS6cQ,"So this is a mom and pop place in a not so great neighborhood.  We decided to give it a try since our favorite Korean place closed down and it is close to Nellis Base.  The name implies that they are known for fish and chips?  We didn't try it but maybe we should have.  The place is small ( only 5 tables).  Very amateur decor.  They were friendly enough.  They do make food as you order and only take cash.  We ordered fried wontons, egg rolls, spicy pork bulgogi, and mild beef bulgogi.  The wontons weren't Very flavorful.  The egg rolls were mushy and bland.  The bulgogi was just ok.  Barely.  We have been to Korea and this just wasn't good.  It was $40 for both of us.  A bit high for low quality.  We will continue our search for good Korean food.",r79QdFrVcIwO4mxNNCjfEg,3,2,2,eGRCe9i1s0uNm94CBNLEGQ

First and foremost, this is a Korean restaurant, but supposedly, they do have fish and chips.  Secondly, and equally important, is that this is a cash only establishment.  Now it's no secret that I'm especially critical of Asian cuisine.  It's not that I'm that much of a connoisseur (I wish); it's that my expectations have grown to be that high.  Don't let my rating fool you away from this establishment.

I also need to curb my enthusiasm some because I'm such a big fan of mom & pop restaurants.  This place quite literally is only that: pop serving up front and mom cooking in the back.  That fact alone makes me giddy about this place.  The locale has something to be desired, but as a lunch option, it's nothing scary.  Also, for being cash only, I thought this place was kind of pricey.  Entr√©e portion size wasn't too bad, but the kimchi selection was definitely sub-par.  Luckily, it was all friggin' delicious.

I got the pork bul go gi.  Those unfamiliar: it's Korean BBQ.  Those familiar: no, they don't have the DIY grills -- it's served already cooked on a cast-iron hot-plate.  They offer in mild, medium, or hot.  The hot will get your attention, but I recommend going for medium and supplementing with the hot sauce they have at the table.  I swear they must lace that sauce with something-something because it's that awesome.  The food is all made to order by the one-woman-team, which means in a group, someone will get their food before someone else.  She doesn't make it all at once, and he doesn't wait until the whole order is ready.  Yet that signifies how freshly the food is prepared.  Service was prompt, courteous, and friendly, with the language barrier not really an issue.

Places like this seem to be a rarity in Vegas, so I highly encourage local support.  At least give it a shot.  I yearn to find more places like this, but in the mean time, I'll probably be back here.",0c0d6-jwJoAlwMVcOowEQg,1,0,3,HDzPloY7DV7VDkLbZ3EECQ

Fish and chips? Korean food? Chinese food? On las vegas Blvd? Ooooooooooo k?

Walking in, it's everything you expect. Plastic cheap chairs and tables. Ripped up posters on the wall. A big ass crab hung on the wall. It's definitely a ma & pop restaurant. 

I ordered a beef bulgogi (bul kogi in their menu) and it was delicious. The spiciness was perfect and the taste was sweet. They don't give you enough rice though. I definitely had way more beef than rice. 

Bulgogi -4/5

Price is iffy. $12 for a bulgogi plate? With 2 tiny scoops of rice?

This Friday I have decided to no go back ever again. I got my usual order of bulgogi and my meat tasted funny it didn't look the same and it was PINK! I even asked my coworker was hers good  and she said no and agreed that she also thinks my meat was pink. I tell the couple and they recooked my meat. Between then I saw them heating up a customers food in a microwave before my food was returned to me. It was still gross so I waited until no customers around to ask for a refund. I got a refund but was met with an attitude and them proceeding to talk about me while I was still there. I can't believe they would act like that when I was a loyal customer and brought new customers to them. I'm so disappointed in this place.,LOCL4-9I5TwBa-9RFC-Tbw,1,0,2,tV1uItDy-kj9Rzsgp2Mbtw

2594035,2011-08-01,10,6bYgKI5JaQmS2xDoofS6cQ,"Welcome to Dan's adventures in the ghetto. A friend and I decided that we needed to explore the options in our work neighborhood (emphasis on 'hood').  Our first pick, USS Fish and Chips.  

I'm not a big fish and chips person.  Most of the fish and chips dishes I have tried have been soggy, dry, or just plain nasty.  Even though USS is a Korean restaurant, I decided to try their claim to fame cuisine.  A big plate of 3 big fish strips and potato wedges costed about $6.75.  I was completely blown away.  This was the best fish and chips I think I have ever had!  They were pleasantly fried, not too thick and greasy.  The fish was tasty on it's own, but even tastier with some malt vinegar and tarter sauce.  The potato wedges were shaped like little chips, about a centimeter thick. They were light and fluffy, but meaty at the same time.

You don't come to USS for the atmosphere.  You probably don't come for the gourmet service either.  You may have to dodge the occasional drug dealer or hobo, but for a decent fish and chip dish it is worth it.  Pleasantly surprised.  I would return.  Beware of the Cash Only policy.",wOGfOjBaP-lCS1NW_En2LQ,8,4,3,pxTw5sArtXZcbHxoF8aQIA
2741647,2014-05-13,9,6bYgKI5JaQmS2xDoofS6cQ,"Yet another decent hole in the wall/mom and pop type of place to check out if you're in the area! Before you come here, let be known that its CASH ONLY!

Just like any new place I check out I usually go with the namesake of the place if it applies. So what I got was the Fish, Chicken, and Chips Combo ($8.25). 

You get two pieces of battered fish and chicken along with potato chips. The fish was tender and flaky. The chicken was bit chewy because it was a bit dry. The potato chips are comparable nilla wafers thicknesswise but were just a tad bigger. Im thinking if dude  makes it with some kind of seasoning, it would surely be a hit for it was already decent the way it was.

If you refer to my pic, when the guy brings it out to you on a tray, it comes complete with ranch, ketchup, tartar sauce, and hot sauce. That's awesome! You have all the condiments you need!

While I was eating, I noticed that other people that came in ordered Korean dishes mainly Bulgogi and Kim Chi Soup. Man, all it did was give me more incentive to come back and order those very same items. Oh, before I forget, this place is an American/Korean/Chinese type of cuisine. 

So basically, you can eat here every day for about 6 months and not have the same thing. Here are just some of the things that you would probably catch your eye after looking over the menu. Frog Legs, Oxtail Soup, Fried Pineapple, Kalbi Short Ribs, and Deep Fried Eggplant.

Minus 1 star because of the cash only policy and the location. Quick story. As I park my car and get out, this guy comes out of nowhere asking me if I wanted to buy some weed from him. I said, no thanks, I am here for the fish and chips. He responded with oh yeah, the fish and chips are bomb here. Then off he went like nothing happened.

In closing, food and service here is great. I just dont think coming here at night would be a good idea especially if you are alone. Which reminds me. The business hours are Monday thru Saturday 10:30 am to 8 pm. Closed sundays. These guys are located in a strip mall on the corner of Las Vegas Blvd and Cheyenne Ave. Check them out.

For ambiance alone I would have to give this place a 2 star. They're definitely not a normal sit down restaurant. The drinks are in a cooler on the side wall and you walk up to the man at the counter who writes your order down in a notebook. There's not much talking involved so it's a bit confusing as to how the service is supposed to go. Almost more of a self serve type of place, but the food is legit.

I had the beef Bulgogi which came hot and fresh with a side of steamed rice. I got it a medium spicy which was just right and the portion side was very good for the price.

This lady had rice just sitting out with nothing covering i over looked that then i see her grab meat with a dirty a** glove with red stuff on it then go in th back fridge and grab a silver container that wasn't covered no dates or nothing so i say excuse me are you gonna change your gloves you just touched raw meat and i definitely don't want that ish on my food . Then she says it the same as at home ? Tf first of all i don't cook like that i wash my hands after touching meat because it's feels nasty and second of all this is a restaurant you definitely don't tell me that she was like well take your money back and ""GET THE F*CK OUT"" so all the people behind me were like eww i don't wanna eat here either so they closed the doors an hour early all because she didn't wanna server food the right way . This is exactly why i cook at home ? u.s.s fish n chips",Yy2swJRaQO8X5bxr5BqjEw,0,0,1,BpdReQ7XO1hPIvXBd8zZhA
