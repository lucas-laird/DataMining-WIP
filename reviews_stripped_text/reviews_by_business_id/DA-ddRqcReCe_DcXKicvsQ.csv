I enjoy the quick lunch specials when I'm not trying to invest my days caloric intake in the AYCE. The roles are tight and tasty. They are made originally and don't taste like every other role you've had everywhere else. I find the music incredibly annoying. I know that's sheerly personal preference.

1935631,2017-05-03,0,DA-ddRqcReCe_DcXKicvsQ,"Seeing yelpers have given this place a 4-star rating, we decided to go for dinner last nite. 

This is a small place in a strip mall. When we were there, there was only one chef making sushi. 

We ordered a bunch:

1. Spicy Tuna handroll and Spicy yellow tail handroll. Nothing to get excited about. Somewhat flavorless. Grade C-.

2. A dragon roll - somewhat flavorless -- knowing it is a sushi roll but without the excitement. 
Grade C-.

3. Spicy tuna on rice cake -- again nothing to discuss about -- it is sushi alright but nothing worth mentioning. The rice cake is baked, not deep fried, which really lowers the caliber of the restaurant. I name this ""non-spicy tuna on hardened rice "".  Another Grade C-.

4. Terriyaki Chicken Bento Box -- chicken is simply awful. The cook needs to be taught how to make terriyaki chicken. 

5. Tempura Shrimp Udon - taste is ok. But the presentation is awful - in a bowl with two pieces of small shrimp tempura. But I really dislike is the amount of sliced carrots, onions, cucumber covering the bowl. This presentation is not enticing at all. Taste is again ok, but nothing to get excited about. 

All in all, you can find much better sushi restaurants than this one. But if you come, you will find the food edible but not terribly exciting. Pricing per non-strip Vegas restaurant standard is on the high side.

The appetizer selection is most interesting, and includes oysters, various pokes, sashimi salad, screaming o salad, lemon tako sashimi, jalapeno yellowtail sashimi, and  seared tuna sashimi (most limited to one/person, dinner only).  Nigiri selection was solid, with long, generous slices of fish and small portions of rice.

We only tried two rolls- the namesake Arata roll, which was odd and used mango (but it was underripe and had no flavor), and their one riceless roll (Rock N Roll).

They have a new owner and a new chef, therefore reopening the place; so I am guessing any person reading this yelp can ignore most of whatever is below my review. Overall, the fishes were so fresh and delicious! I recommend!

First time, I ate sashimi with my family. I usually do not eat sashimi without this Korean red pepper paste with vinegar, but then this sashimi was still so good without it.
For the second time, I had AYCE. Everything was good; I was really surprised again how fresh fishes were. I once ate amaebi (sweet shrimp sushi) at another place and it was so bad as it was not fresh; from that time, I did not even look at amaebi. But then, when my friend ordered it here, just being curious, I ordered it, too. And, it was so delicious! I am thinking that it is because it is so fresh.

I really love this place. I know it can be a little far, but it is worth going! I am planning for the next visit already. Lol.",AIh98YvEqu7VeRlJBbYqow,0,0,5,rmVIR_0vYSD5MSi25BiH0w

That being said, staff is friendly and try to address customers needs. It looks clean but it's stuffy with lack of air flow and Korean pop is on full blast. The sushi is okay, but relatively warm when served. Thus after leaving it made me sick. You can order half orders of sushi rolls, but much of their fish doesn't seem fresh. It's an okay place to grab a bite if you have a desperate need for sushi and lacking time. But it wouldn't be my first choice until the experience gets a little bit more elevated. Also- the dessert (i.e. Mochi) is not included in AYCE. Overall, I'd give it a 2.5 star rating for their friendly staff.

4137828,2016-08-24,0,DA-ddRqcReCe_DcXKicvsQ,"I remembered enjoying the Shrimp Tempura Bento Box when I worked near this restaurant about 10 years ago. So last night we were in the area and decided it was time to revisit this place. It was a Monday night at around 6:45pm and not a soul was in there. After we ordered our food I shared with the BF that I hope the sign of no one dinning with us was not a sign of horrible food. Sadly, my thoughts were proven correct. First I want to say that I love Japanese food!!! Sushi, Tempura, Ramen, hibachi ect.. whatever it is, if it's Japanese I'm bound to like it. Everyone that knows me knows that I always default to Japanese food when asked were I would like to eat. So I was completely surprised when the most flavorful thing I ate was my Tempura Sauce. Yes - the sauce! I love Japanese Ginger Salad Dressing but the dressing here was just awful. It was bitter, sweet and watered down. When my thoughts were shared with the waitress she offered me spicy mayo or yum yum sauce but I just asked for salt and pepper. I even added a sprinkle of Soy Sauce. I couldn't eat it. My salad was wasted. My Bento box just looked sad. Visually it was not appetizing. Everything we ate was mediocore and lacked that yummy delicious distinct flavor that you can only get from Japanese food. While one may like steamed Shumai instead of fried shumai in which case I normally love Shrimp Shumai no matter how its prepared the Shumai on my Bento was steamed, mushy & cold. The BF had Shrimp Tempura Udon and it just tasted like a package of make at home instant udon that you can buy at a Supermarket. We also ordered the Spicy Tuna Crispy Rice which was ok. Nothing special - the Spicy Tuna once again like all the other food items lacked flavor. That's all we ate. I've noticed all the great reviews that this place gets so maybe we ordered the wrong items? Maybe the cooks were having a bad night? All I know is that I feel like I wasted my hard earned $35.00 on a dinner that we were not happy with. As we were leaving I couldn't help but notice that still not a soul was entering the restaurant or calling to order take out.

Fish to Rice ratio: if you've read any of my other sushi restaurant reviews, you know I love a good fat healthy serving of fish to rice.

I had at least 15 pieces of salmon nigiri because it was so good. 

Fish quality: the quality was definitely great. The salmon and tuna were so good. It was a plus that they had salmon belly. It's not listed so make sure to ask. 

Rolls: They offer half rolls on most of their selections which is always great for those of us that like experimenting and trying new things.

-Menu offering: 26 specialty sushi rolls on the menu, donburi  (rice bowls), udon, fried rice, bentonite boxes, few skewers, 
-""Rock N Roll"" is served with a spicy mayo sauce, not in picture or description. Would've preferred it plain without the salad dressing sauce

OVERALL: No frill AYCE sushi spot for a great price.  A good place for someone who prefers nigiri.  No 'specials' of the day in terms of fish or food offering.  Family friendly restaurant. Minus one star because of the hair in food and a few still half frozen fish.",1y1T-gONnhnC68JlR6RNgA,0,0,4,Hcp3fOyzfj-dokTlGKSEXQ
4792889,2018-01-06,0,DA-ddRqcReCe_DcXKicvsQ,"Management is a joke! Picked up take out today and shortly after getting home, I called to complain. I had ordered the chicken teriyaki bento box and it looked like chicken soup. When I called the really nice waitress that was working said she'd call me back after speaking to her manager. A short while later she called me back and said I could come in for a refund because they couldn't do it over the phone. I let her know I would be in later and she said as long as it was before closing it would be ok. I later go in to get my refund and the ""manager"" asked where the food was. I let him know that I threw it away. He stated the waitress I spoke to told me to bring it in (which she didn't) after explaining the situation, another woman comes out (maybe his wife) and they start arguing in their language and then with me. I  let them know that no one told me to bring the food back in and it was in the garbage. I wasn't going to go digging in the trash for it. They both continued to state they both heard her tell me to bring it in. After seeing their frustration, the woman comes up to me and hands me a receipt (very rudely) and says my refund was completed. Never again! Not even if the food was free!!! Not to mention the lack of professionalism when talking to customers is a joke! I even offered to come back until the waitress that helped me worked and they weren't having it. Next time I much rather pick up teriyaki chicken from Jack in the Box or better yet get sushi from the grocery store.",YMELY6B0TthIZ1c-H044ZQ,0,0,1,eFCcjsfrEw68NCeri8R_yA

My wife came and intended to just have a soup, but decided to try.
She was all on board for the next trip she enjoyed everyone so much.

I've been passing this place for some time ever since I bookmarked it awhile back. The opportunity open up for me to give this place a shot with my siblings, we have a special love for Sushi!

Upon entering, we were greeted by the friendly staff and was seated promptly. The ambience is not to trendy like other Sushi places but had a simple and straightforward appearance with J-pop & K-pop Music video playing on the tv. Water was served along with the norm you would expect from a Sushi restaurant including wasabi & ginger. Our server, Irene was a pleasure to have and was knowledgeable with the menu. We ended up getting AYCE, because we wanted to try a bit of everything and was feeling famished. 

Everything was delicious including the Nigiri pieces. We are quite picky with our fish but tonight it was spot on fresh and well balanced. Their special rolls were notably good and you have the option of getting half sizes too. Will have to return to this homey restaurant for another delicious meal!

Everything is really fresh and I love how they take care to package each roll individually with the corresponding sauce on the side so the rolls don't get soggy. The extra thought doesn't go unnoticed. Each time I've ordered I've decided try at least one new roll each time and every one has been absolutely delicious.

5517567,2017-08-15,1,DA-ddRqcReCe_DcXKicvsQ,"We popped in one night, immediately greeted-immediately seated. I didn't catch any weird vibes...good sign. Though, the restaurant did give me a diner feel rather than your conventional feel when eating sushi.

This was the first time I felt so disgusted eating sushi. I've had better sushi at a grocery store. I ALWAYS order spicy tuna, salmon skin,  and a Philly roll to start because it helps me gauge the spot...but also because those are my typical go-to if all else fails. Super basic.

My rice was soooooo frickin mushy and overly wet. My salmon skin was chewy. The spicy tuna was bland...bland plus mushy wet rice...no bueno. My husband went nigiri happy, and honestly...as long as he is eating nigiri he could careless. So he doesn't count. What also appalled me was the amount of shine his nigiri had. Sorry, I know some places brush their fish with oil, spray it with some sheen...make it look shiny...but I don't like that let alone like seeing that happen. If that's not what was happening, then wth was that being sprayed like we are in the 80s battling for the poofious hair. We opted for ayce and I couldn't make round 2. 

Should I have said something? Sure! But most times I have this philosophy if I have to tell someone how to do what they hell they've been doing...speaks volume and I shouldn't have to go do that. Service was all right...our waiter had personality so not much complaints there. 

We did go back another time and though my first visit was a little different than the second...i still thought the food was a tad mediocre and not somewhere I'd do ayce again nor would I recommend it especially to a person who has a go-to ayce. 

I'm only giving it 2 stars because the staff was friendly, and I feel bad I'm even rating this so low...but it's my personal experience. I wouldn't recommend them based on my experience as you can tell others have had a better experience...so feel free to give them a shot for your own experience. And if you care...they do have fresh wasabi on their menu.

Definitely stroller friendly!",MC0aQHT7mQ1WJknOD6u8pg,5,1,2,iKFHJ8OqAkI6LLSp42jWkA

Its  a little whole in the wall restaurant but the atmosphere was welcoming and all that we asked for.  The service was great we were greeted with a smile and every time we ordered we still got a smile.  We each had the AYCE and it was worth every penny of $24.95.  

The fish was fresh and was always presented so nicely.
