He always gets pan dulce (sweet Mexican bread) which the bakery was in charge of ringing it up or keeping count of how much bread u were purchasing! Today he went as usual and when he went to pay the Cashier wanted to touch the bread with her bare hands to 'count' it, he asked if she had gloves, and she said no! He went to the bakery to get her some tongs. He asked to speak to the store Manager. When the 'manager' asked what was wrong my dad proceeded with telling him that Cashiers SHOULDN'T be touching the bread, he simply responded ""Then DONT BUY BREAD."" My dad became very irate and told him that was the stupidest solution. My dad threatened to call health department so the ""Manager"" didnt allow him to purchase ANYTHING and told him he had to leave the store! What a ""Nice"" way of treating your customers!

As I was looking at my receipt and noticed she still charged me for 7 breads, I was telling my husband why I was heading back into the store,;a lady overheard and said this has been done to her too and when she complained, she  was accused of eating the bread and basically sent on her way.

There are a few places I like hit up when I'm looking to make carne asada fries or some tacos.  I will be coming here more often.  There is a full meat section with different types you need like flank or marinated types.  Also for you taco makers, they have a tortilla factory here as well.  Fresh tortilla!

2887684,2014-12-15,3,woJ0p5-_bc1BCezm16qtZQ,"Take a break from the traditional super markets sometime and try something different.  Not just a bodega of unusual imported items from some far off land.  A good ethnic market needs to have all the specialty items and also the usual things anyone would need from any other super market.  Shopping for the weekly groceries is a monotonous experience at my age of domestication.  Thankfully I find La Bonita to be a welcome unaccustomed shopping experience.  

Back when I was vegetarian for years (& much leaner) I couldn't shop at these stores.  The butcher section emits so many particles of animal carcass in the air that I could not allow myself to breath in the smell.  The meat section is kind of like a mini DMV line.  Everybody takes a number and the butchers call your number before you go to town by telling them how many pounds of what kind of meat you want.  The meats here are perfect for the college student or lazy house chef.  All those different Mexican style meats are already seasoned and ready to cook out of the bag!  

Oh yes and I do mean BAG, lol!  When they fetch you the meats they are then stuffed into a red bag and tied.  LOL, I love that part.  Better for the environment with no styrofoam or blood soak packet.  The only way it could be greener would be at a real butcher shop that wraps meat in paper.  Seafood selection is pretty standard.  Most every domestically available cut from most standard animal are represented along with some specialty parts and pieces for the gastronomically daring.  It's all pretty dang fresh and at very low cost too.  5/5 for the meat dept.

The isles are very Latin oriented.  I will have to say that most of the ethnic dry foods are very fair priced.  However those average items for American shoppers may be a bit pricier by a few cents to a few dollars.  Quite the opposite as at regular grocery stores where the ethnic foods are way higher.  Also the variety is custom tailored for Latin shoppers, many small items are missing altogether.  I go to Smiths or Winco for those anyway.  Dry goods isles 2/5

Snacks are not a giant double section isle here.  Big difference from their counterpart super markets.  The chips are usually full retail price and tucked all the way to the back corner.  Which is a good thing I suppose.  One thing they do go big on is the bakery section.  My borderline diabetic partner has a hard time walking past the Mexican sweet bread displays.  She is Mexic-asian (and also my translator) so she grew up on all those partially sweet crusty bready colorful creations.  I'm more of a O-face Doughnut guy, but the Mexican sweet breads have grown on me.

The whole place is pretty fun and cheaper in many aspects.  Not the cleanest out there, but not filthy in any way.  Like I stated this is the perfect market for college students or lazy home chefs.",ZngF2uBYrqyFjXd6LvuluQ,5,4,3,9OjFXAQBPLHQFXfTyB1bKw
3031330,2016-05-09,0,woJ0p5-_bc1BCezm16qtZQ,"This is my favorite grocery market. So much better food than in all the American ones, like Vons, Target, Walmart all together. I shop there for vegetables, fruits, meat and bakery. I highly recommend delicious bread rolls (3 for a $1, or 4 for a $1 on some days). Everything is extra fresh and of a highest quality, like it just got there from a garden. Its super cheap, I was able to buy there cucumbers for 20 cents and tomatoes for 11 cents! Lala sour cream is awesome, more to the delicate side than to sour and better than your regular sour cream, its the only one I will be buying since I tried it. 

The customers are almost 100% Mexicans, as I am white I feel weird being there, but I will continue to frequent this place, awesome prices and produce. I don't understand why anyone would go anywhere else, if you can come to La Bonita.",ytTGUBSEf4t-tD1f-NJjOg,2,0,5,8X9nmR5-hH3z434HwVL_zA
3234556,2017-04-07,0,woJ0p5-_bc1BCezm16qtZQ,"I look forward to seeing their weekly ad in the newspaper. No other place I've found has better sales on fresh fruits & vegetables every week. Tomatoes, cucumbers, squash, zucchini, cantaloupe, watermelon, onions, potatoes, radish, bell peppers, mangoes, etc. are some of the things I buy every week. The best day to go is on Wednesdays where they have extra special deals on specific fruits and vegetables. Thursdays are best for meats. They also have a food court area where they serve up popular Mexican dishes at a good price. I've never eaten ate the food court but the food looks good. 

The market gets very crowded on Wednesdays so be prepared to dodge all the other shoppers looking for a great deal. Parking out front is a little tight so I always park far and walk to avoid the people who hold up traffic to get a parking stall a few feet closer to the entrance.",Ou5obbkoCSZcZIt8Jku4Bw,0,1,4,L_Gtwfjh2inLxSNoLvS98g

Being a fan of veggies, this is the only place I buy fresh veggies. I come out of there with 6-8 bagfuls of groceries for around $10!! Can't beat it. Also, sometimes I can find amazing deals on ground turkey and seafood here. 

Due to it being a very popular store, it is always crowded and a lot of the time, I feel rushed to get my stuff as I'll get trampled upon. LOL. Also, never been here where I haven't seen kids running around without their parents with them.

The tacos come with beans and rice in a takeout container. The smells would even get to the credit union members in the lobby. They were yummy- I told my husband he had to try them sometime.  Good place for cheap eats. There's a little seating area too if you want to eat there.

My mom wanted rides here, so I started shopping here, too (on my own, after work, usually). Believe it or not, we're not the only asians shopping here. The produce is soooooo cheap (5 pounds for a buck). The prices are hard to beat. I always consult the weekly circulars before heading there. I mainly come here for the produce. Sometimes I leave with two bags and the final cost is under $10.00! My visits are short and to the point.

4750096,2014-07-20,0,woJ0p5-_bc1BCezm16qtZQ,"Wow, I feel like I really discovered something here! When it comes to fresh produce, meat and bakery goods, this is the place to go! Ok so it's technically possible to find higher quality (whole foods for instance) but who the heck wants to spend that much and I'm not about to drive all the way to Henderson to get hosed! What you'll find here is really great prices, extremely high quality and quite a bit of atmosphere too. There's an in house taqueria and here's something I thought was really cool: there's a big window in the center of the back of the store and behind it, there's actually a crew that is physically MAKING tortillas! Maybe I've just spent too much time at Walmart and Smart & Final, but as a neophyte, I thought that was pretty awesome. This may not exactly be the place where one would want to do ALL their grocery shopping (gallon of milk is 3.99 for store brand as opposed to 3.19 at SnF). But really, if you're going to buy a lot of produce, meat and bakery items, the price and quality of La Bonita will more than make up for it. And while you're there, go ahead and eat a taco.

4826416,2015-02-17,1,woJ0p5-_bc1BCezm16qtZQ,"If you want to over pay for EVERYTHING you need to fully stock your kitchen cabinets in Las Vegas, come to La Bonita Supermercado.  

Actually, this isn't true if you're not put off by off-brand products.  But if you like your Best Foods, or Mazola or Kraft Cheese, you're paying over $6.99 for it (Yes, this market LOVES that price tag on name brand items).  Stick with the off-brand stuff, and you'll pay what you'd typically pay for the name brand stuff, only, you're stuck getting what you could have bought at a 99 cent store.....sigh...

The produce here is REALLY fresh though, and THAT is about the best thing you can purchase here, for a decent price.  I picked up 2 pounds of grapes, a pound of apples, a cantaloupe and few other things for under $6.00.  Not bad to feed all the kiddos.

The line for fresh meat from carniceria was waaaaaaaaaay too long for my liking.  When I asked a local if the meat was that good here I was told it was the ""best in Las Vegas"".  Hmmmmm, maybe.

The check out lines were also too long for my liking.  I waited, with a hand basket, in line, for over 10 minutes (no, there was no ""10 item or less"" line). 

Interesting to note that I've never seen Caucasian's begging Mexicans for money while coming out of a grocery store.  Nothing against it or anything, I'd just never seen that until the day I went shopping here.",bmOuwh_dy0n3GIccYJpZ5g,0,0,3,xzvvNYqg68GoRoLH7-nKng
