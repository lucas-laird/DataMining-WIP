I love the convenience and that all her meals are packed with flavor. You would never know they are healthy. 
Everyone should know about this!!!",B_zj9vmuhjHZ1KERCtud7Q,1,1,5,TNPthbxKr6W9yUMn0PiK1w

Thank you Chef Nikki for customizing our meals to perfection every time! We are so grateful for the care you took in preparing our food for us, to achieve the results we were looking for. WE DID IT!!!! And you and your delicious meals made it feel effortless!

We have used several other food delivery services and meal prep places in the past. You truly surpassed all of them! You simply rock, woman!

If anyone's looking for a delicious portion controlled meal prep place, this is your gal! Yes, she does delicious vegan/vegetarian low-fat dishes, as well. I also believe she ships!
Thanks again, Nikki!",KSSRgXHRRXR7lybTspmSTA,0,0,5,tiD0eNkP90jMIAt4TTPTIw

Her HCG meals are unbelievable and so tasty! Honestly I can't believe these meals are soooo good and really fresh every time I pick up they're fairly warm! I love Nicole as well, she's so accommodating and she knows how to cook! All my meals are different every order so I don't get bored. Her chicken and turkey meals are juicy and not dry. I can't get enough of her seasonings!!! Her meals are reasonably priced! I highly recommend Murdock meals! Thank you Nicole",YlfxzYM84u2tPVepMjwkrA,0,0,5,TsXQwODpIsuRpgIqK9_aYA

However, Nikki's personality and how helpful she was sold me. I did not regret my decision once I saw all the meals she prepared me. She has helped me lose weight and is always prompt with her service. She's just an all around genuine person, truly cares about your diet goals and never hesitates to help out. I'm so happy I was referred to her!",WkPVsf0EVqHm4IU7tsejIg,1,0,5,7DRI_3Yx_WDh-PNUi2D4FA

Really helpful, flexible on the meals and the cost is really reasonable for the service and quality of food.  I highly recommend it.

They listen and helped me adapt things to my particular chemistry.  I was really happy with how they work with me and my particular needs.",ZY97y3X3CcFgHx4QlK6mfA,2,0,5,I6RN9zmv2wZrB9jRnHH7oA

My boyfriend has diabetes and needed a low carb low sugar menu.  She accommodated his needs and helped get his diabetes under control.  Then he had his jaw wired shut after a medical problem, and she made all the diabetic meals into liquid that could be eaten through a straw.  

I joined a gym called Raw fitness that gave you a meal plan consisting of healthy proteins and lots of vegetables.  I am a terrible cook and I did not want to fail on this fitness program.  Again, Murdock Meals came to the rescue and cooked for me per the instructions.  

Finally, my boyfriend is currently in the hospital and cannot stomach the hospital's food.  I called Murdock Meals and he is now getting the nutrition he needs to get better.

To conclude, whatever your diet requirements might be, Murdock Meals can accommodate.  The food is cooked to order fresh, delicious, and affordable.  Even if you can cook (unlike me) and do not have enough hours in your day, I highly recommend Murdock Meals.",910aDZmt_jkOy9YBNf5PfA,0,0,5,lWPtPnPv5AahFDZZVpYBLw
