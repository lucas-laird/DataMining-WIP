I tried the beach club and that was delicious! Will for sure be coming back and checking out their other sandwiches",AdEBa40pkeeY43Wxyx_ZzA,0,0,5,6x9mT6ULTl-DgmBX0OpOpQ

1925614,2018-04-30,0,L8VUDJOdhOm4yyWMzlD5iA,This is the best Jimmy John's in town. It's not just the sandwiches but it's the customer service. The owners and everyone that works there takes so much pride in what they do and the food they make. Wasn't sure about the tuna but they let me try it first and the tuna was delicious. Tastes freshly made even though it was already 9:00 at night.,e45rh4-M3hnzAybZZi05VQ,0,1,5,v2aib-A3XJV-0FkWQaXvuw

2463635,2018-04-03,0,L8VUDJOdhOm4yyWMzlD5iA,"This store just opened up like in January of this year. Ive been working at Smiths pharmacy for almost 6 years the manager Jordan is a real dick and he is so rude!!!! He was trying to tell me I can not park my car in front of his store. First of all my i purchase a new car in 2-2015 my car got hit in the Smiths parking lot 6 months after I got it and ever since than Ive been parking my car over by the Jimmy Johns/Wingstop area. At that time Jimmy Johns wasnt even over there. The Joint and than it was Verizon and they never had an issue with me parking my car over there. The manager Jordan threaten to tow my car if I did not move it. There is no signs where it says I can not park my car there. It is not private property if I am employee here and there is no sign saying private property.Jordan is a miserable man that probably has not gotten any sex within months and he is taking his fustration out on me for no reason. I will most def address this matter to their coporate office.  I will tell all my friends on IG and Facebook not to eat there. What kind of business offer ""free smells"" to get customers to buy there dry ass sandwiches. My friend order food from them one time and they didnt have her order ready and she order her food 30 minutes before she went to lunch and it was not even ready when she got there. I will continue my business with Firehouse Sub and Subway. Talk about rude services!!! If your ""so called parking space"" is apart of your lease why couldnt you show your paper work to our store manager where are the signs where it states only Jimmy Johns customer parking only?? Falles Vales, our smoke shop has their signs for their customers parking.  I believe Applebee's have them as well. If Smiths employee cant park their car in front of Jimmy John then Jimmy John's employees should be able to park their car in the Smith's parking lot. I wouldnt recommend this Nellis and Stewart Jimmy Johns to anyone.",GETSjPFM3PSiVgMrBofaSQ,0,0,1,7MrUDw-R_UyG0cFS5MF6fQ

It only been on the east side a few weeks March 2018, but it is so good.
