I ordered the braised chicken with vegetables and rice and it was AMAZING!! my friend ordered a panini with cranberry sauce and caramalized onions and it was INSANELY GOOD!!! I couldn't believe it.

the atmosphere was so lovely too. It was so comfortable there: they had couches, tables, a breakfast bar table like thing, benches with tables. Oh it was adorable and I loved it there. what could be more great besides the lunch items and the Nutella cremé bruleé. one of the best deserts i have ever had....

Every 10-15 minutes one of the employees came out and wiped down the empty tables and picked up the up the dirty plates and cups from their spot to get washed and squeaky clean.

if you plan to go to a bakery try this one first. It will knock your socks off.",7QRec81IeLgHcG6Tln0D8w,1,1,5,LyqTxQbzX4sL_mKgFLZeqA

We emailed Chef Megan and she responded within a week. I later tried to contact her; however, she would take so long to respond, I had to ask if she was even still interested in catering our wedding. Once she responded, she mentioned that we should meet up to further discuss. Since we do not live in Las Vegas, we had to plan a special trip to meet her. Chef Megan was nice enough, but she was extremely scatterbrained! After we perfected our order and paid a deposit, we wanted to try some pies. They only had mini berry pies available, so we said that we would love to try one. That was no problem, and then she proceeded to ring us up...for the $4 pie. I was a little taken back that we were buying $600 in pie, and she charged us to taste a mini $4 pie!? One the day of the wedding, I received an email saying that the pies had been delivered; however, they forgot something in the order, so could I please pick it up. Of course I can't pick it up - I'm getting married, and I've already paid you $80 to deliver everything!! By the way, the $80 delivery is literally just that - they do not set anything up; rather, they just hand the pies off to the venue. 

The pies were pretty good; some were better than the others. I think that this little business could really be amazing if Chef Megan stayed in the kitchen and hired someone to run the place. C&S needs someone less scatterbrained that knows how to deal with the public.",m8YyF2ufkk9Xh_cNsBGk7A,2,0,3,RfmtGWlGx1iLV5iYvp8e5A

158255,2015-12-30,1,nYzCr8fcJ2ci4aiB1-hB6w,"Service: As soon as we walked in we were not greeted and gave a very mean look from the counter girl. As we were looking for what we wanted to order, she rudely scolded us about how they're closing when it was literally an hour before they were supposed to. As we asked for more time she walked away and gave this really disgusting ""tsssssk"" sound. Basically she told us to settle with what's made and not to order more because ""they're closing."" Afterwards, when asking what's good she was no help whatsoever and gave more attitude as if she was so eager to get out of work already! As she was packing our treats she was having an obnoxiously loud conversation with her coworker and swearing left and right. She was touching our food with her bare hands right after she was done texting on her phone on shift: unprofessional to say the least! And who knows where her phones been? Anyways, her coworker was nice enough to start a conversation with us and being generally friendly aside from the front counter girl's nasty attitude. Service wise, from this girl alone, was absolutely terrible! If this is the standards of customer service in this establishment then the management ought to be ashamed. The pastries were great nonetheless, but this one worker was absolutely ridiculous.

Cannoli: very tasty! Not too overpowering in sweetness and perfect in balance. A bit stale however.

Nutella chocolate bar: so so chocolatey! And a good kind of rich and creamy consistency when you bite into it. Just one is enough chocolate to satisfy cravings.

Espresso chocolate cup: favorite by far! Perfect balance and the espresso cream inside is to die for. The only thing I didn't like as much was the chocolate cup itself. The design was adorable but the chocolate used was a little bland. 

Caramel tarte: the texture of the caramel was strange although it definitely was good.

TLDR; I came here with my BF because we've been dying to try the desserts here; they looked amazing from the other photos on Yelp! But service here was one of the most terrible experiences I've had so far. The counter girl was outright obnoxious, rude and unsanitary. But the four pastries we took a shot at were pretty delicious and a nice surprise. Will not be returning unless service experience is taken care of, despite exceptional treats.",KLJ7SypKNaB1G3xhLjh2Dw,2,2,2,Bzoo38MCDWvWNkeS3_PZjA

Their turkey sandwich and salad were good, although the lemon vinaigrette was oddly not lemony, but tasted mostly of olive oil. The pumpkin chocolate cake I had was in a league of its own and I'm a chocolate cake snob. It was moist, had the perfect balance of cake and frosting, the frosting was light and chocolatey and I detected maybe a little cream cheese or maybe it was buttermilk, whatever it was it added a depth of flavor. And the pumpkin was a brilliant compliment. The second time I went, I had the egg white frittata with pesto, a blueberry scone, and Mexican hot chocolate. The pesto was so fresh I wanted to take a bottle home or definitely try there pasta another day. The frittata was eggcelent! So fluffy and tasty, I never missed the yokes. The hot chocolate was too sweet, but would be amazing with that one correction. And of course...the scone...crunchy ouside, soft inside, buttery, lightly sweet, magical.

She is highly skilled, trained, and uses the finest quality ingredients and she is a local business owner who braved the Las Vegas recession to follow her passion. Second, just go get your average, machine made croissant at Starbuck's where you will pay the same amount and keep your negative comments to yourself. I guess yelp is like a person, there is always one ass*&%e!
Anyway...Went there on a Sunday morning to dive into all of her offerings. WOW! We met Megan herself and she was so gracious, helpful and friendly. We ordered the banana cream pie, very fresh and creamy for sure. We also had the ham and Gruyere fritatta, nice savory start to our spiral into sugarland. We enjoyed the chocolate and hazelnut tarte, super velvety chocolate with a hazelnut crust and gooey caramel. Then we had the espresso chip shortbread cookie with a caramel and chocolate filling....ummmm WOW. Nice balance of salty sweet flavors and smooth, crunchy textures. Nice to dip into my espresso. Then...it gets even better because Megan brought us out a almond cake with warm fig compote and marscapone cream topped with fresh peaches-this is a must! We finished with three gelatos (house made of course) the grapefruit, my favorite, strawberry watermelon, and cantaloupe.

Looking at the inventory of what we indulged in now has me heading to the gym. It was worth the sweat and hard work to enjoy all the beautiful and delicious creations Megan Romano has prepared for our town. Embrace her genius!",UHBFDZ-TC0dCc_2Ga6sjlQ,4,3,5,u17cmkVeCd_5KrmH7tLdvg

The crust is similar to a Napoleon... light, flaky and crispy and the insides are a creamy ""bnanna"" melt in your mouth custard, topped with ample whip creme, a caramel drizzle and choc shaving.The peanut butter bar and mousse were rich and chocolaty. The strawberry pie a traditional treat with fabulous crust. The staff was welcoming and friendly and more then willing to explain in detail choices. We came at 6:30pm and asked if they close promptly at 7pm, to make our decision to stay or go and the counter staff indicated they would stay as long as we needed.

I was extremely disappointed that my order for a sandwich was incorrectly done and I got a wrap instead. Also, my iced mocha was forgotten completely. I thought the girl at the front counter was just slow, but after 15 min,  I walked up and she said she just forgot. There weren't even a lot of people in the bakery when I ordered (just me and a friend and 2 other people). When the iced mocha was finally brought to the table, it was just an iced coffee. I took it up to the front and she said they don't make iced mocha and that she thought I meant that I wanted an iced coffee when I clearly asked for an iced mocha. Umm, okay. Lastly, I asked for a copy of my receipt because one was not given to me when I payed. She couldn't locate the copy and told me that she'd bring it to my table with my drink. Of course she didn't, and I didn't press it later because I was already frustrated with her forgetfulness. I didn't even want to waste my time getting a dessert before leaving. I will never go to this place again and will not recommend it to anyone either. It's a shame because I was really looking for a nice local coffee place to frequent.

We came in from one door and a family came in through the 2nd door @ the same time and no one acknowledged us at all although we were the only customers there. It seemed like everyone was busy (at least 3 employees) doing the same thing. We were just standing there for a while when 3 other customers came in at different times. A lady walked back and forth by the register and she finally looked annoyed and left. A gentleman was looking over the pastries trying to get someone's attention and everyone still had their backs turned away so he also left. We waited patiently until a sweet girl helped the family and a 2nd equally sweet girl helped us as well almost at the same time. I think this cute cafe is doing okay but if it was more organized and they had some kind of timer for the pastries & other goods to notify them when its time to throw them out, this place would really be an excellent $ maker for the owner. When you walk into a Starbucks everyone has a different duty & that's part of the reason I keep going back. There's always someone at the register, someone making the coffee, and someone else handling a different duty whether its getting the pastries or drive thru. Team work people.

Special Kudos to the bakery's sous chef, Keris, for getting up early and making the best  homemade donuts (with chocolate ganache) for my daughter's birthday.  She wanted donuts....  I don't even like donuts and these were amazing.  Unlike most donuts these were not too sweet.

587511,2015-08-25,1,nYzCr8fcJ2ci4aiB1-hB6w,"This place is so cute that I desperately wanted to love it! I first came when they had just opened. Came in every day for lunch, looking for that one thing that was going to wow me and keep me coming back for more. I did like their chocolate croissants... but then everything else just fell flat. Noticeably flat was the Mexican Hot Chocolate.... didn't even taste like it had chocolate.

Today, I came back after over a year of not visiting. I thought that maybe it had improved since then. Not so. 

My intention was to buy the chocolate, but went during lunch time so I decided to have lunch as well. They have a sign that says the lunch specials, and it talked about a salmon sandwich. I decided to go with that. Turns out there's no salmon. 

Let me think about this for a second: your lunch special is a salmon sandwich, it's 12:15 pm, there's people here but it's not exactly packed (there's not even a line)... but you have no salmon. 

Ok, I go for the half soup half wrap lunch combo. I go for the tomato soup and chicken salad wrap. I also get my chocolate, there's only seven flavors to choose from, so I take one of each. I paid $29 for a half wrap, half soup, a cappuccino, and what turns out to be six pieces of chocolate (after repeatedly telling the attendant I wanted one of each, she still left one out). 

I get my food and get to business. The soup is lukewarm! Before I could even make it halfway it was straight cold. Ok, the cappuccino is not very hot either. The chocolate was given to me in a crappy paper bag, despite the fact that they have chocolate boxes on display. They also seem to be sloppily made. The chicken salad wrap was good but nothing to write home about. 

And then I remembered, I never really liked this place and I probably never will. It's too bad because with a famous name attached to it, and all the work and money they seem to have put towards it, you'd think they would they would put the same amount of effort towards the food. It is what they are selling after all.",QMaG6jItCW03LpzWmQeNrw,4,0,2,stg10Za9heZXA-drAAfP_A

Does Megan Romano still own this, because she must not be hanging around here, I expected so much more!  Arrived after 2 p.m. assuming there would be a rush.  There were 2 people in the whole place.  Set up was very confusing about... do you sit down?  Do you order at the counter?  Looking into the pastry case (somethings were labeled with tiny labels, others had no label and we had to guess) there were sandwiches displayed that were obviously days old, with the edges of the cheese and the eggs all dark colored and curled up, really disgusting and totally unappetizing.  The girl behind the counter (who later I discovered was in a rush to leave for the day) was not helpful and kept asking 'is that all you want', 'is that all you want'.  We assumed that what was in the case was all there was.  I am short (5'1"" tall) and I didnt even see those chalk board menus way over on the other side of the kitchen, until after I had already ordered!  There were no printed menus, and nothing close enough for a customer to see, take a look at and maybe take a minute to decide.  When I asked what kind of salads they had she said 'we only have the house salad for $7.25'. $30 for two croissant sandwiches, two teas and a 'house salad', WOW in a place with no customer service tableside.   The high point of my lunch was that the croissant roll itself was fantastic, great job!  Otherwise, my ham and gruyere was just that..several slices of ham and a slice of cheese.  No condiments, no lettuce, tomato. (I was craving some great boutique kind of mustard or maybe that apricot aioli that was stated to be on the turkey sandwich).  My partner had a BLT.  Two strips of bacon in a $7 sandwich, really guys?  The salad would win the award for worst combination of a ton of ingredients in a salad.  The lettuce used was romaine, and it was the pale inner, sour leaves of the romaine, sliced up but some werent even sliced up, I had to wrestle some of it with my plastic fork.  The dressing was so sweet it was like pouring simple syrup on the salad, which already had figs, cranberries, candied hazelnuts, and what I think was pear poached in vanilla syrup (overkill).  It was like eating dessert, except I forgot to mention there were tiny slivers of what I think were salami - like that ingredient seemed so random among the rest of them.  It took me 20 minutes to get that sugar taste out of my mouth.  Tables were dirty, the floor looked like it had not been mopped in days or a week, the front windows were dirty inside and out.  The cabinet that was doubling as the trash receptacle and at the same time held your forks and condiments  (ewww that they are right next to each other) was an area that was dirty, confusing, and I really objected to using a plastic fork taken from a plastic cup full of forks, in a place charging this kind of money.  No napkins.  The interior was fun and hip, but between the decor design and ALL the stuff in the two pastry cases, and then the 4 different chalk board menus, piles of cookies, popcorn and candy in packaging, I really felt like this place was having an identity crisis or trying to be too many things to people.  Would you go into a place and order a 'Kalbi Beef Rib' dish at the same place where you can get an egg white frittata?  Just a really confusing all over the place menu.  And to call it a bakery and 90% of their items are cakes and chocolates and no bread or rolls in sight, is a bit of a stretch as far as identity as well.  It should be a cafe that sells baked goods.

I will definitely be back for more great pastries but also because Lola is a gem of a employee who can turn someone's day around for the better with a simple hello.

That day I didn't have a lot to spend but some of the prices of some items put me off.

Dang.

So...have been meaning to stop into this bakery for a while, and when I realized I was passing by a place with the word ""chocolate"" in the name, you can bet I made a quick turn and headed in to find something sweet. NY Resolution...over. 

The signage caught my eye as this is now Rolling the Dough Bakery and Chocolate and Spice. I was intrigued as I entered I noticed that the sitting area was cute and there were lots of goodies in the case.

I have to say that my experience with the staff was great and the mini chocolate cake that the sales associate suggested was DELISH! I wanted to get more but if I did, I would eat it. So.

Now. This not my style at all...but I have to say something. They say, if you see something, say something, right?

I have to commend the staff the most for the professional service they provided to the incredibly rude woman in line ahead of me. I will not recount how she behaved, as you can read it in her Yelp review that she posted recently. Her nasty words and tone match exactly as you would think she would be in real life.  I have never in my life encountered someone so entitled and belligerent and I honestly watched in awe as the patient staff members accommodated her every ignorant demand. 

I try not to meddle, but when I saw the review she posted on Yelp, I had to be sure that someone represented what actually happened. The staff here can be proud of how professionally they responded to the classless display of raving lunacy by the ""lady"" in front of me. Congratulations on a job well done. The cake was superb and the service was 5 star. I should deduct one star for making me ruin my diet, but that was bound to happen.",-XN6b7pqV2lghQgrIgu3vQ,3,4,5,pzYzSXq-YczEkV1lFdLbOg

1001224,2012-05-20,0,nYzCr8fcJ2ci4aiB1-hB6w,"I read about this place and was excited to try it. I purchased a banana cream tart (individual) and a whole Red Velvet cake (6 or 7 inches tops).  Here are my thoughts. 

The banana tart was amazing. Truly an elevated product involving pastry and confection. The crust was a perfect puff pastry, the filling sublime, real whipped cream (in a nice pattern like little balloons), topped with a few drzzles of caramel and white/milk striped chocolate curls.  You can't even compare it with anything else in town. I think it was $5 and was worth every penny if not more. 

I have to admit I had specific ideas about the Red Velvet cake (for a variety of personal and culinary reasons). The cake did hit 2 very important marks.  First, the cake itself had some chocolate flavor notes (I think a proper Red Velvet cake is a derivative of a devils food cake).  Second, I was wondering what they would do with the standard frosting (which is heavy with cream cheese and cloyingly sweet). I am pleased to write, the cake was perfect and the cream cheese icing was light and smooth (like a mouseline).  I think that little cake was $45.  On one hand, that's pretty damn expensive for such a tiny cake  On the other hand, there is no comparable bakery in town (that I know of). 

Everyone I know orders cakes from Freed's. They are pretty cakes, but I don't really think their product is much better than a grocery store cake.  

Since i just criticized Freed's, I guess I should admit that I don't care for fondant and when I make buttercream I start with a sugar syrup  I I don't think Freed's does and I believe C&S does.  Contrary to popular belief, a real buttercream is not just a muxture of confectioners sugar, butter (or worse, Crisco) and extract. 

Everyone deserves some decadent pasty once in a while. 

Reward yourself (or a foodie you know) with the taste of excellence at Chocolate & Spice.",m59fIhwg02w2y86sKQ9MrQ,0,0,5,hVeZhXgrqcw_SXMwN4VmmQ

After reviewing multiple Yelp reviews, I settled on Chocolate and Spice as I loved the elegance and detail that Megan put in all her previous work.  Despite being a new establishment, Megan is by no means new to the high-end pastry world.  Let me tell you, she is perhaps one of the best pastry chefs I've ever met or had the pleasure of working with.  Having lived in New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Boston, and all across Asia, I have never met someone that could produce such deliciously consistent, yet beautiful desserts.  Her French Macaroons are just as good as Bouchon, her shortbread espresso cookies are to die for, and her pistachio biscotti are amazing.  She may not produce a huge variety, but I'd rather have incredible quality as there are many other dessert shops out there that have tons of variety but mediocre quality.  

Given her work experience and tenure at some of Las Vegas' top hotels, I emailed her a quick picture of what I was thinking of and she came with her staff to do a full setup.  We had people comment all day on how great everything looked.  We were giving out 5 different small dessert varieties and each one was carefully packaged and delivered.  I can't tell you what a professional she was.  She even took care to weigh and measure her desserts given the restrictions we were working with at the Hotel Convention Center.  I would highly recommend her for any wedding or catering job as you're not going to find someone better in Vegas area - she's as good as it gets!",dLc9NyYXmcCVbdxPT6JzOA,1,1,5,v-wE7iTDLAA2Bs4BRUjmAA

I ordered a half-sandwich and a banana cream pie. The sandwich started sort of non-descript, but the more I got into the cranberry bread and the light mayo/dressing, the more I liked it. A half ($5.50) is plenty if you plan to eat dessert. Oh, by the way: plan to eat dessert.

I worked at Mandalay while Chef Romano was at Aureole and had the privilege of enjoying her work multiple times, so I came in knowing what to expect. The cream in the little flaky pie shell was fantastic, light and rich at the same time. The caramel was unreal, a total standout. I paid $4. If you're wondering if that's good or bad, just know you could easily pay $10 for the same dessert if Chef Romano were making it inside a casino.

Yeah, I know $2-3 for a croissant or bun seems like a little extra. For the quality, it's worth the money. Go enjoy something of a quality you don't often get to enjoy at a fair price and without walking through a smoky row of slot machines to get to it.",GuhSD-jy--l7yG2HvFR8TA,2,2,5,ornrCXTL16yUYmtaK_ph8Q

I ordered the egg white frittata which is simply egg whites, Parmesan, spinach, and cherry tomatoes. My order came with a beautiful display of fresh fruit though the menu does offer options of a potato salad, mixed green salad, or fruit. 

The frittata was probably really good for what it was but it wasn't filled with flavor and the size made me pout a little (a bit bigger than the size of my palm). I loved that the side of fruit wasn't mixed together, keeping the flavors distinct. 

I did see some large sandwiches being served so you can get full here. 

I also heard a customer request the french toast 2 hrs after breakfast stopped being served and they happily accommodated. 

I ordered a hazelnut latte ($3.75) and I loved it for the price. I'm a sucker for good foam and even though this one didn't have it, I still liked the latte. 

There is ample seating here with 5 4-tops, a 6-8top and bar-style high top table/seating. Boarding the windows are tiger striped, comfy, high backed recliner like chairs that really add flare the the place.

Chocolate Tart - When I put my spoon into it, the first thought that came to mind was ""uh oh, my teeth are going to hurt.."" Usually chocolate desserts that are this dense and heavy are overly sweet. But this shows Megan's brilliance. After I put it in my mouth, it was perfectly balanced and not too sweet! I was delightfully surprised.

Brioche, - Soft buttery brioche. It was mixed correctly and baked correctly. Well done.

Had to wait long, there were only two other customers dinning at this time. 

Ordered:
-Grilled cheese with tomato soup: grilled cheese was good but the tomato soup had a consistency of puréd tomatoes, was not very fond of it.
-Macaroni & cheese: excellent, simple.
-Portobello mushroom sandwich: had too much balsamic vinegar. 

After we ordered my niece pointed out that some of our meals should come with a side which they failed to ask what sides we wanted for our meal had to remind them.  Ordered fresh fruit for one of them, never made it out until my 8 year old niece made a reminder. 

Checked in on Yelp and asked them about the 1 free-tart offer, had to remind them AGAIN.

Ordered a hazelnut almond milk ice coffee to-go. It was made wrong the first time..there was no almond milk at all, tasted like a cold brew. 
Made it a second time. Still was not right but i had already spent a longer time than I intended being there and i was not willing to wait any longer to get it correct. 

When i received my drink.. i tasted it, wasn't right. tried getting the waitresses attention to inform her, but when i look she was at the register on her phone! Did not even try to hide it. Pet peeve. So instead i had to walk up to the register to deliver my concern. Wow. 

It just feels like service is not very consistent, poor performance, kept having to remind the waitress. Never came to get the check when we paid for our meal, had to go up to the register. It was just a awful experience all in all.

1694617,2016-01-14,8,nYzCr8fcJ2ci4aiB1-hB6w,"Visit here for a decent pastry, but prepare thyselves for an exercise in patience and miscommunication on simple matters. It shouldn't be rocket science, but rocket science is what you will be dabbling in at Chocolate & Spice (now Rolling in Dough, what a name). Walking in here is like walking into a barn and watching all the mice scurry away. A customer! Panic! 

Service here is excruciating. This being my third visit, it's safe to say that confused-and-bumbling service is the norm. Quite unfortunate--and quite odd--for the interior presentation leads one to believe that this joint has its act together. The design is cute, the seating comfortable and plenty, music is at an appreciable level, the menu for food is short yet diverse, and the pastries are easy on the eyes. 

I have never had an unpleasant item here; everything has been quite tasty.

But man, the service kills it. Never to return. Today, for example, I ordered the breakfast croissant sandwich with omelet. I was met with a confused look, and asked, ""what would you like on that?"" I returned the confused look with one of my own and said, ""what do you mean? I want exactly what's listed on the menu, it's item #4, so the ham, the cheese, the omelet, etc."" The waitstaffer turned to look at the menu for a moment, a long pause, until she turned back and asked, ""so on a croissant? This is a croissant,"" and she points to one under a glass case. 

Yes, I am AWARE of what a croissant is, thank you.

This is not the first time I've met someone in Chocolate  & Spice who appears utterly confused by their own menu. I looked at that menu for one minute and had it figured out and mostly memorized. This isn't a matter of ""we just hired this person,"" it's a matter of what seems to be a systemic issue with the types of people they hire to take orders. They are confused, frantic, inattentive, and preoccupied with whatever other tasks they think they should be doing aside from giving the two customers they have in there their undivided attention.

It makes for an often uncomfortable and (to put it mildly) frustrating customer experience. 

My first visit? There was one person working and no one else in the joint. Just me, and her. She's racing around, chatting on a phone, and tells me to just shout her way when I'm ready. No opportunity for pleasantries or to ask questions, SHE'S JUST SO BUSY! 

Back for seconds--only because my edible espresso mousse cup was so good--I have another lackluster exchange with staff. They just seem so disjointed, like it's a challenge or a pain to work in what should be a delightful and quaint Vegas cafe and bakery.

This third time, though? Between the confusion on my simple order, the weird carnival smile I was given with my coffee (what did you put in there??), and the major cashier fiasco for the friend I decided to introduce to this place, I can't take it any more. Is their litmus test for new staff just complete ineptitude and social awkwardness?

We decided to get some coffee and ordered the caramel vanilla latte, this was very good. Just sweet enough, not too sweet to where you can't finish the drink. The latte had a pretty little snowflake on top!

If you are in the mood for a breakfast pastry, ice cream, fancy chocolate confection, exquisite dessert creation, or even an artisan loaf of bread, Chocolate & Spice will make your decision that much more complicated, because everything is delicious. I suggest visiting with a group and ordering a great variety to share (or fight over.) Stop in for breakfast, lunch, or an early dessert, as they close at 7pm.

Today was the grand opening, and I stared at the many options in the display case for a long while before ordering an iced coffee and a honey brioche sticky bun to enjoy in the store. To take home, I also selected a blueberry financier (I don't know how to say ""no"" to a financier) and a strawberry lemon napoleon with layers of puff pastry, lemon cake, strawberry jam, and lemon cream. Savory selections included fritattas, quiche, sandwiches, salads, and pastas. While I placed my order, a freezer case was being stocked with freshly made ice creams and sorbets. Additional shelves held bags of candy and caramel nut popcorn with dried cranberries and golden raisins. Before leaving, several baskets of bread behind the counter caught my eye, and I picked up a baguette to take home. This bread, along with everything else I tried, tastes and looks like it belongs on a table in a fancy restaurant.

The dessert suggested by the owner, who was very nice and informative, was called a chocolate bomb.  The sliver of chocolate on top was WOW!! and it got better from there.  The chocolate bomb is a spherical, chocolate-enrobed chocolate cake with chocolate mousse/cream filling on a chocolate crust.  Both decadent and delicious but not overpowering.

I called and emailed a few places, but the reviews and pictures of this place won me over. I was also impressed that the same two women (Megan and Keris) who did everything from take my email order, phone calls, bake my goods, and deliver it! Never did I speak to anyone else.

Banana Cream Pie is one of my favorite desserts; the individual portion here is truly outstanding: generous slices of banana beneath delicious, fresh whipped cream juxtaposed with a light and not-too-sweet pastry cream and anchored by a flaky, buttery, white chocolate lined crust and finished with a drizzle of caramel. Love.It.Every.Time. 

Lemon Meringue Tart -- actually lemon or citrus anything, for that matter -- is another personal go-to dessert; the version here hits all the best notes: tangy citrus, sweet, fluffy, brûléed meringue, cradled by the aforementioned superb crust. 

My recent visits were the first time I'd been by in several years; space is still pretty and the staff are all welcoming. The average rating is based on the fact that almond croissants were once underbaked and a second time nearly scorched and dry; the latter also being an issue with a chocolate cupcake my chocoholic Mom did not even finish, pronouncing it ""kind of dry and not sweet enough."" Not being a fan of chocolate at all myself, I defer to her on that. Hence, 3* overall.

Chocolate & Spice is a quaint bakery located in some random strip mall on the West side of Las Vegas.  The place is quaint and very nicely furnished with dark wood and large printed artwork. 

The bakery consists of a small case of pastries and desserts. I decided to order the petite banana cream pie as it looked so pretty with its flaky crust, fluffy whipped cream and a tuille of chocolate to top it off. It cost about $6 but if the dessert is good, I'll pay for it! Unfortunately the pie was nothing to write home about. It could be my choice but I've had my fair share of banana cream pies and made them myself. I will say that the crust is perfectly buttery and indeed flaky. The cream was light and the chocolate added a hint of sweetness. But the banana and custard hidden under all of that lacked a sweetness that you'd associate with a dessert.

I will definitely go back next time I'm on that side of town and give it another try. After all, I only tried one thing and they had so many other options. I'll choose time when I haven't already gobbled up an entire Chinese menu. ;)",C8HJdSggJI_MC58vTDBE3g,3,1,3,74euNog0uleGkr4i8zq60w

When I walked in I wanted EVERYTHING... from the sandwiches to the cakes to the chocolate bonbons to the freshly made gelato... so I did get all that :)  

The vegetable panini was THE best veggie sandwich I've had, it was tasty without being salty, it was perfect with that pesto sauce.  The Nutella bomb was devilishly decadent and the chocolate bonbons were awesome, I especially liked the sage gooseberry one.  My beef with the pretty banana cream pie was that there was too much crust in ratio to the good stuff inside.  More filling and less crust please.  The chocolate chip mint gelato was PERFECTION, creamy, not too sweet and the mint was significant but not overpowering.  

The red velvet cake however, robbed this place 1 star from a perfect score.  The frosting was not made from cream cheese, but rather a very sweet buttermilk frosting.  Sniff.  I wonder if their red velvet cupcakes suffer from the same sacrilege.  Cream cheese frosting please.  

This was one setback in my first glorious visit to Choc&Spice and I can't wait to go back for more.

They had a selection of desserts, pastries, and cakes in the display window to order right there, as well as a lunch menu that included soups and sandwiches. My friend got an egg salad sandwich on toasted wheat bread, I got a pistachio cannoli, and she got a mini lemon meringue tart. Let me say that we are NOT picky eaters, but we do have somewhat high standards, and we appreciate quality. We were definitely underwhelmed with the desserts, and probably wouldn't go back given the choice of really amazing bakeries in the area. My cannoli was filled with something resembling frosting, not a thick ricotta as usual. Her meringue and lemon curd tasted like the eggs curdled in the process, and wasn't smooth and tart. Nothing was inedible, but nothing was good, and not worth the splurge. 

The egg salad sandwich was definitely good, so we ended up sharing that, but if you're looking for a sweet surprise I'd head elsewhere.",bkcWR-bVxx4wjRkjZdUfNQ,5,1,2,rURmL08eABbdY0IBGsAFgA

2837549,2012-06-06,2,nYzCr8fcJ2ci4aiB1-hB6w,"Upon entering Chocolate and Spice a few miles west of the Vegas strip, there is an immediate sense of sophistication and class to this recent bakery opened by Megan Romano, former pastry chef at Aureole with one Michelin star under her belt.  A copy of her new book ""It's a Sweet Life"" was open at the counter and I was struck by the quote on the back of the book:

""A great dessert *speaks to you, yet it never shouts. *Invites you to linger over the flavors, not to loosen your belt. It is made to *impress, not to overwhelm.

For me, dessert has often been an afterthought to a great meal, and with the selections of sweet goodness here, I may have discovered my long-lost sweet-tooth.  The counter is filled with a tantalizing selection of sorbets/ice creams, pastries, and artisan chocolates.  Yet there are also mouthwatering savory selections including a brioche bun baked with blackforest ham and gruyere, gourmet sandwiches, and freshly made frittatas still intact in their baking pans.  

I opted to order a cup of coffee, a slice of the veggie frittata, and a personal benchmark for any bakery I venture into, the pain au chocolat (chocolate croissant).
The frittata was drizzled in a freshly made basil pesto and had a delicate texture akin to a fine Japanese chawanmushi topped by a crispy crust of golden shaved parmesan with intermittent nooks and crannies of fresh spring vegetables such as chive and asparagus.   The pain au chocolate stayed true to her philosophy with just enough chocolate to leave you wanting more but not in excess so as to prevent one appreciating the buttery and flaky croissant which is the primary star. 

The decor and layout of the venue is beautiful, very much reflecting Chef Romano's fine arts background, and no attention to detail is spared.  There is nothing short of ""everything nice"" to be enjoyed here in addition to Chocolate and Spice, and I can't wait to return for more.",syA7uYoDjohc7gWBWaEZmw,12,9,5,LPXQ4i57bfVSoHLQFe-VnQ

3167780,2013-09-01,0,nYzCr8fcJ2ci4aiB1-hB6w,"Just found Chocolate & Spice here on Yelp a few weeks ago and knew we had to try it. We stopped in today at about 3pm and the place was pretty much dead. There was only one girl working behind the counter but she did a good job of getting us and the customers ahead of us taken care of.

They obviously focus mainly on desserts and treats but they've also got a decent selection of other foods such as sandwiches and soups. I went with an egg salad sandwich on brioche and my wife had the BLT. The egg salad sandwich was pretty good size and I actually had quite a bit fall off on my plate. Flavor-wise, the egg salad by itself was excellent but the brioche completely overpowered it. I believe they offer it on a croissant as well which I'd definitely opt for next time. The BLT came on a croissant which was super good but was definitely lacking in size compared to the egg salad. They give you a giant croissant with just a couple pieces of bacon and not much for the other toppings. There is a lemon aioli on the BLT though that was really good and worked well with the sandwich.

As far as desserts go, I noticed another Yelper mention that some stuff in the display weren't labeled and that's still the case. Quite a few items weren't marked and the menu on the wall is kind of confusing so I really had no clue how much most the items were. We ended up getting a banana cream pie and a brownie parfait. I think the crust was either a little overdone or had been sitting for a while cause it was pretty dry and parts of it were hard. For the size of the dessert, there isn't much of the banana creme inside but it had good flavor and I believe the whip cream is homemade, which was my sons favorite part. The brownie parfait was ok, the brownie was a little dry and the mousse stood out more than anything but for the most part, we liked it.

I feel like they are on the verge of being nearly perfect but just little things hold them back, especially pricing. They charge $3.75 for a large iced tea! And for $7.25, I think the sandwiches should come with a side...chips, fruit, or whatever. They've also got to work on their organization. The menu is sloppy writing on a chalkboard and with stuff in the counter not being labeled, it just makes things confusing. Since the food and treats were tasty, we would go again if in the area, but it's definitely not something I'd go out of my way for.",QqRSNjWhfUFv1ZU0OnYKZQ,1,0,3,UH8KaVEcRbEFvC4God3keg

I'm never too excited to order anything from their menu since there is nothing really special or original on it. Don't get me wrong, all of the food I've tried has been quite delicious, but I could go other places and get more for a cheaper price. Their names might sound intriguing! Like the creme brulee French toast, but after the first bite you start to realize it tastes just like normal french toast. If you're into tea, their blueberry tea is a must! Their desserts are fine. Nothing I haven't seen before, but it fills the void in my life when I'm in the area and craving something sweet. 
      The problem I have with this place is their customer service. I've been here a number of times and I find myself waiting for a refill on water or tea because their too busy chatting it up. They seem to get confused a lot as well when I'm ordering a simple item or two. Last time I was there I said I wanted two desserts and that I would be consuming them there. She insisted that she put them in a box. I had to tell her twice that I wanted both on a plate and one of them heated. I don't understand how hard it is to comprehend. Seems like the time generation either have their heads either in the clouds or buried in the sand. They're there to collect a paycheck, not tend to their customers.

We ordered a banana cream pie (most popular according to the server), red velvet cake (looks like a mini trifle), turkey-cranberry bread sandwich, ham-lemon herbed focaccia bread with aioli sauce and several kinds of bread (to go). The banana cream pie was good and something different. The cream's sweetness was just right and puff pastry was flaky. The only suggestion I would have to make is to put more bananas in the pie. I only saw 3 small pieces inside the pie.  The red velvet was also sweetened just right.  The cream cheese frosting balanced well with the moist cake.  I haven't tried the sandwiches since we just had lunch when we went here so I just took it home. But I believe their sandwiches looked a little pricey especially the ham sandwich since it was kinda small. 

Oh we also had some of their pomegranate iced tea...it's ordinary and I think this was way overpriced.  $3.95 for a 20 oz and its not even sweetened.

I truly believe that the cafe gods answered my prayers (complaints) for more locally owned cafes that serve hot caffeinated beverages in large mugs, and sell delicious desserts not packaged in plastic or cellophane wraps. 

Breakfast foods, sandwiches, soups and salads, as well as assorted baked goods and ice cream, are served here; however, I came for the desserts! There's an array of desserts behind their display case, but once I heard ""Nutella Bombe"" I was sold and chose the last one. The Nutella Bombe was, well, BOMB. It's a chocolaty dome with a cookie bottom. It may look rich and decadent but it isn't. On the other hand it also wasn't overwhelmingly sweet. I also ordered a regular latte that was served in a big  white mug. Warm and frothy, it complemented my Nutella Bombe.

The plush chairs are definitely a nice touch to the place. If you plan on being there for a while, they're the best seats in the house to get comfy and cozy. 

So it looks like Chocolate & Spice is going to be one of my new favorite spots in Vegas. I'm already looking forward to trying their Nutella Latte and each of their individual desserts.",epkRB3J_oBEiyiwahvdmGg,5,2,4,haC4CUobZZBhX-Vy2y_dnQ

I would say it did somewhat surprise me that it had a loungy type of feel. People were sitting with their laptops out, kind of reminded me of a coffee shop. I wish they had patio tables.

The pastries I've tried, like the apricot croissant ($2.75) and caramel brioche sticky bun ($3), were average, as was the sausage and pepper frittata ($4.75). But, there's plenty that makes up for their shortcomings.

Sandwiches are delicious and perfect to grab and go if you need lunch on the run since they're pre-made. The roast turkey ($7.25) with gruyere cheese, apricot mustard aioli, bibb lettuce on a cranberry multigrain roll, in particular, is excellent and a good value for what amounts to a 7 or 8 inch sandwich.

Where this shop excels is with desserts like the chocolate hazelnut tart ($3.75). The strong hazelnut flavor and varying textures from the nuts, caramel, and chocolate make it a winner. The mint chocolate tart ($3.75) is equally delicious with it's subtle mint flavor and sweetness.

Most items have an understated elegance in both appearance and flavor. Bolder flavor doesn't always translate into better taste. The food here is subtle and refined. While some desserts are sweet, they're not sickenly sweet. Most are similar to European desserts in that sense. They don't hit you over the head with sugar but, instead tease you with their sweetness and leave you wanting more. Their sweets are addictive and for Strip quality desserts, this place is tough to pass up.",C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w,3,2,4,Ksim0PzFrKKfatisqbzMjQ

3621018,2012-05-28,1,nYzCr8fcJ2ci4aiB1-hB6w,"I've heard so much about this place ever since it was opened 3 weeks ago. Their good reviews were everywhere (Vegas Seven, Vegas Weekly and Yelp). People said the east side has Bread & Butter, and now, the west has Megan Romano's Chocolate and Spice Bakery (the former executive pastry chef of Aureole in Mandalay Bay). Although I live in Henderson area and a fan of Bread and Butter, I was attracted by all the rave reviews for this place. 

I came here with family on Memorial day weekend. It wasn't as crowded as I thought it would be. A plus for me so I can enjoy my food and its cute deco without the crowd and noises. Bakery looks very bright and trendy with a feminine touch. They have great selections of chocolate bon bon, fluffy pastries, savory sandwiches, salads, soups, cakes, quiches, frittatas to homemade ice creams.  We ordered breakfast frittatas (with oven-roasted Vegetables and parmesan pesto), brioche (with mozzarella cheese, tomato and prosciutto), sandwich (with mozzarella, tomato, roasted eggplant, basil, balsamic), banana cream pie and mocha latte. The food we ordered and desert were fresh and light. The breakfast frittatas and banana cream pie were lovely. It was the best banana cream pie I ever had!

No wonder the banana cream pie is their number one selling item! Crust tasted really fluffy and filling tasted light not too sweet. You could actually get couple pieces of fresh banana from there. It was simple and perfect. I was also impressed with their mocha latte. It was good quality stuff. 

We ended our lunch with their homemade ice creams. Blackberry crumble and cookie n cream both tasted super creamy and silky. Chef was generous with fresh blackberries when making blackberry ice cream. I got 5 big blackberries in 2 scoops of ice cream! 

I also got 4 chocolate bon bon to go. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nYzCr8fcJ2ci4aiB1-hB6w?select=K8KU2CzmC3AnHzXvqwCMXg#s_Qjnoobaz8s4Wk_hMMXYQ)

Each bon bon is $2. I felt it was fair price for high quality chocolate, design and pretty box comes with it. I would say peanut butter bon bon was best out of  four flavors I got. (mountain berry, peanut butter, earl grey, strawberry balsamic) 
I can't wait to try their cake selections when I go back next time. This bakery is definitely a local gem. They can also create custom pastries, cakes, personalized catering menus and unique cooking classes.

The cashier asked how my day was going, probably out of sheer boredom because this place is DEAD. I have been here for an hour only one other person came in.

I read the reviews before coming here and decided to just go for it. I was tempted by the Nutella Bomb and didn't get it...wish I had.  I had a perfectly nice bland red velvet mini cheesecake. It was plopped on a chocolate wafer that was soft, I felt it should have been crunchy. It was glued to the gold cardboard with an overly sweet dollop of frosting. The cheesecake itself was thick and creamy but nothing about screamed RED VELVET except for the blaring red color of it. It didn't taste chocolatey it just tasted like regular cheesecake with vibrant red dye. A better description would have been Red Food Coloring Cheesecake.  It was topped with glazed tart red raspberries. They were delicious but a bit overpowering and inappropriate topping for this particular dessert. I would have eaten a whole bowl of them. 

The real reason I didn't get the Nutella Bomb was because I ordered (against reviewer suggestions) the Nutella Latte. WEAK. Tasteless. I got a slight hint of Nutella, but I wouldn't have said THIS IS NUTELLA! if I didn't know what it was. I even ordered it with non fat milk (cause I am healthy like that) which should have enhanced the flavor of Nutella. It did not. I hardly tasted espresso. It was hot milk with subtle notes of espresso and Nutella. Ask for an extra shot or more Nutella, Because the reviewers are right. 

The shop itself is cute.  It has an upscale vibe and almost hits that mark if there weren't Pepsi vending machines. Tacky. Especially the empty one. Lose them or get unmarked refrigerators. Cleanliness is an issue. The baseboards haven't seen a good scrub down in awhile. The ledges on the floor to ceiling windows are crumb encrusted. The floor needs a good mopping and waxing. Three employees, one customer, someone could break out a broom. 

This place almost hits the mark but misses. Maybe my expectations were too high.  I think this place tries too hard to be too many things. Get your cafe (espresso drinks) up to par and improve the desserts a little, (Dear Famous Pastry Chef Owner, I expect better, so do others if you care to read your reviews. No, we aren't professionals in the industry, but we are your consumers, we give you our money. Our taste buds don't lie.

3837750,2016-02-25,2,nYzCr8fcJ2ci4aiB1-hB6w,"The fiancé and I walk in around 4:00 just after my classes end. He promised me a trip to a bakery since I got an A in Philosophy, and this is relatively close to the CSN campus. We walk in, a tad bit confused as to where to stand (my fault, long day = no common sense), and I lay my eyes upon the most beautiful display case I've seen in quite some time (I'm a sucker for pretty colors and icing). The girl at the front was somewhat new, so I'm not going to criticize the wait or service. We've all been new hires and, frankly, it sucks until you finally settle in. Still, who I presume was the manager, had an awesome personality and waited on us a couple times. She was awesome. So, overall, this was a great find.  

I went insane with ordering for myself, parents, and fiancé. Perhaps not having eaten since the day before had something to do with it. I checked out with a chocolate ""Blackout"" cake, two apple crumble pies, two orders of mac and cheese, a chocolate-dipped french macaroon, a raspberry crumble bar, and the adorable little fruit tart that's free with a Yelp check-in. 

The decor is great, it's very quite, and there's a little vial with fresh flora at every table. Everything is clean and presented in a lovely fashion. It's a very open and friendly environment with a little bar at the front and lounging chairs. It took some time to get what we ordered, but we're patient people and that's no big deal. Again, new girl was sweet and professional - that's what really matters early on. 

The mac and cheese was by far the most wonderful thing there. I honestly don't think I've had mac so creamy and wonderful in my entire life. Absolutely delicious. It is pricey, though. After tax, about $9.00 a bowl; the portions are enough to fill you, but not enough to have for later. Let's just say the fiancé was still a bit hungry afterwards (the pie filled him, so he was happy). Nonetheless, awesome. 

The Blackout cake. At least that's what I think it was called. The presentation was awesome. It was very sweet, and insanely rich. I had about a fourth of it and took the rest to go. But, it had great flavor, and it was an awesome dessert (in small quantities). 

Apple pie. I bought one to-go for my fiancé and another for my father (we'd be seeing him later). The presentation was so cute. I loved the portion size and the price was great. The fiancé loved it (he's not even that big into apple pie). The apples were baked to perfection, and still maintained a slight crispness. The crumble on top is phenomenal...no really, it's great. Now, my father is an apple pie connoisseur, of sorts. He really liked it, but it's not the best he's had (that would be in a little restaurant out in Boulder City). I still believe that's an impressive feat, despite his criticisms. 

The raspberry crumble bar is tasty. The raspberry is a little powerful, but it uses that same crumble topping as the pie. The trouble was that I didn't order it. I'd purchased a strawberry cheesecake to-go, and found this little cutie inside instead. No big deal, it was alright. The same with that cute little tart (check out the pictures, it's adorable). Nice presentation, and the berries were incredibly fresh without that odd glaze topping that adds a sort of artificial taste to good fruit, as though a preservative. The macaroons are good. As expensive as any other french macaroon in Vegas. Honestly I'm not sure why there's hype about macaroons in general...they're cute and sweet, but I guess I'm missing something. 

As a response to a previous one-star review: I got paper beneath the desserts in my box. Not sure what you did to fluster the girl enough to just throw your cake in, hoping you'd leave. Or maybe she was new? Who knows. 

Overall, service was okay, food was incredible, desserts were great, and we intend to come back and revise my review based on how it goes!",2YOWAF4_uQZ3ToABzRh4hA,4,4,4,JOhmb5uEPjAY2xsB8OEWAA
3850741,2013-06-21,1,nYzCr8fcJ2ci4aiB1-hB6w,"Stopped by to pick up some desserts for my girlfriend's dinner. Had a lot of potential, but it seemed like the workers were a bit preoccupied at the time I arrived because no one came to help me after 15 minutes of waiting there in an empty restaurant. This gave me plenty of time to look at the excellent looking menus. I assumed they would only have desserts but they also had many interesting lunch and dinner options. I would probably return just to try these and make a separate review. As for the desserts:

Red Velvet Cheesecake - Not really fan of Red Velvet anything, and this didn't really sway me otherwise. Was more of a Lemon cake than anything else.

Buttercream Chocolate Cupcake with Chocolate Covered Bacon - I love buttercream and bacon, so the both of them together sounded like heaven. Wasn't as good as I expected. Wasn't very moist and did not melt in my mouth like I had expected buttercream to react.

Nutella Bomb - This is where it's at! My girlfriend and I couldn't keep our hands off this one and almost devoured each other in the process. The texture and taste of this is one of a kind. They also had a Chocolate Mint Bomb which sounds just as great. I would for sure come back for this again.

1/3 dessert successes + spotty service should equal less than 3 stars, but I can't account for their lunch and dinner items.

Atmosphere: the place itself is adorable. It's definitely a type of place you would feel comfortable grabbing a cup of coffee and having some catchup time with a friend. 

Food: everything looked so delicious. My friend and I decided to share 3 different desserts: strawberry cheesecake, pumpkin vanilla bundt cake, and banana cream pie.

Strawberry cheese cake: the cheesecake part was delicious. The cake that was under it felt stale. It was hard. It felt so stale and dry that we thought they did that on purpose, but why would someone purposely make cake dry? 

Banana cream pie: it was hard to break into the crust. It felt like bananas topped with whipped cream in a crust bowl. It just was not what I was looking for.

Pumpkin vanilla bundt cake: the only dessert that was a little more satisfying. It definitely stood out from the other two. I enjoyed the pumpkin. The cake felt a lot less dry than the strawberry cheesecake.

I went before work to get a crossant and coffee at 7:15AM on Friday 12/18. The door was locked, however there were two women behind the counter. They heard me trying to open the door, because they turned around and looked at me trying to open the door. Then they turned right back around and continued working on what they were doing and never opened the door. Never told me that they were closed. BUT the sign on the door says that they open at 7:00AM. 
Ok, I was stupid and went back for a second time on Tuesday 12/22 at 7:45AM. The door was locked once again. But on the door the hours are from 7:00AM to 6:00PM. Also your website states the sames hours. As I was pulling out of the parking lot, I see someone running to unlock the door. A little to late!
So now I see that there is a different name on the marquee of the building. It now says Rolling in the dough and Chocolate and Spice. Did the two bakery's merg? 
I have visited Chocolate and Spice more than a dozen times, I will NOT be visiting them anymore. 
Sad to say, Chocolate and Spice has lost a customer! Since you can't seem to get in the door to order anything because you don't know the hours of operation. You try to follow the information on the door and on their website, but it has the wrong hours.

I have a sweet tooth but am watching my diet but since my New Years resolution don't start till the following week, we ventured here based on the many great reviews we've read on Yelp. We arrived about 45 mins before they close and i'm sure that's why we were'n't fully truly impressed with the dessert. We ordered the Banana Cream Pie, Tiramisu and the some Chocolate dessert (forgot name)
The BCP was delicious. The sheer presentation was impressive. Tiramisu was meh... aight. It looked better than it was. It was too sweet and didn't melt in my mouth. The ""Chocolate Dessert""  was way too hard. Not sure it's supposed to be like that but it was not eatable for me. We're thinking maybe it was sitting in the display case for the entire day or maybe from the day before but it wasn't Fantastic. We expected all of it to be super fresh and will dissolve in our mouths but it didn't. Again, i'm sure it's the timing of our visit. I'll give this place another try the next time we're in Vegas and give a 2nd review. But this time we'll get there earlier.",DH1RJp2dUrq2U94-70HELw,0,0,4,Vl6yRINB3j4IrR3l6CINHA

The strawberry tart consisted of two fairly hard top and bottoms with cream filling.  It was very sweet, almost cloying.  My wife at the chocolate bomb and the mousse and she thought they were good.  I finshed the purchase by eating the lemon meringue tart.  The crust of the tart was hard and it was difficult to eat without sending pieces of crust go flying.

Overall, I was OK with what I got but there are so many better choices that I doubt I'll be returning.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,13,10,3,ajkZx8xvjSIK3mQAF3cHkg

I read a good review for the bakery in the newspaper so I figured it was worth a try. I ordered and paid over the phone for a white cake with blue bordering. I also spoke to two different people on two different days regarding the order and was confident they would do a good job. I sent my husband to pick up the cake an hour before the party and whenhe got there they told him that the order must have gotten lost because they never made the cake. They said they would hurry and make one and asked if we could come back. since we had no time to come back they did offer to deliver the cake which I guess was the least they could do. Unfortunately the cake was prolly the ugliest looking cake I have ever gotten. My daughter was upset because in her words the cake was hideous. Everyone felt that the cake was very poorly decorated. They definitely rushed making the cake. The taste was decent however I've definitely had better. The cake was expensive and after all of the mix ups we were not offered any discounts. To top it off my husband said the customer service when he first entered the store was horrible. We will not be returning to chocolate & spice.,MRT-ATaxazcfwD0AwDd3Lg,2,0,1,Qj3Uw4vP5kXVOeG4BwRzOA

My boss enjoyed her egg salad sandwich on a savoy croissant, but liquid ran out of it.  (?)  My coworker thought the gazpacho was not to her liking, but she liked her sandwich.

Interior/ambiance was cute but odd. I liked their bookshelves with all the decor and thought their wooden tables added to a cute touch but their zebra print arm chairs made no sense to me. Are you trying to be cute or edgy? I also didn't like the background music. They are playing radio station which plays lots of ad so you will end up eating lunch while listening to an add about insurance company. Personally, radio station with pop music & ads didn't quite set the right ambiance. 

Service was alright. One lady (Robin?) working the whole place all by herself while another lady just stood and watched Robin work. It was as if she was an ice sculpture because she didn't move whatsoever, and at the same time giving this ice cold stare. Service would have been a lot better with more attention to detail if this ice sculpture lady helped out in cleaning and serving. 

We ordered their daily special that day which was a french dip roast beef sandwich. We also got a turkey BLT. Wait time was fairly long, being the only party there and still look a good 20 mins only for the food to come out cold. My french dip roast beef sandwich was alright. I wish they toasted the sandwich. Sandwich was meaty, but wasn't filing. I wasn't a fan of their turkey BLT. Overall dry and bland. 

Lots of improvement needed on service/teamwork and food was nothing to rave about. I won't be back, at least for their cafe side.",mEzc6LeTNiQgIVsq3poMbg,6,6,3,E4RbwOFd4lzncAFRNspO3A
4010322,2014-04-11,0,nYzCr8fcJ2ci4aiB1-hB6w,"First, let me say that I love this place and I will continue going back.  That being said, I gave it 3 stars because it's truly hit or miss every time I go in.  Sometimes their scones are fresh out of the oven and delicious, others they are rock-hard stale and should be thrown in the trash not actually sold to people - for full price.  The muffins sometimes have the crunchy sugar on top, sometimes they don't.  This is disappointing when you're expecting to get what you had the last time (the crunchy sugar) only to find out they don't have it. However, the blueberry muffins are always totally full of blueberries  Most of their treats in the dessert case are delicious but, again as other viewers have pointed out, no labels, so you have to ask what everything is.  I've always had good luck with their croissants - scrumptious!! I've had their frittata, chicken salad wrap, roasted chicken, chicken pot pie, and a salad.  The frittata was good, the chicken salad wrap was delicious, the roasted chicken was way too salty, the pot pie was just ok, and the salad was bland and boring.  I've gotten two cakes from there and one had zero taste and the other was fantastic.  Obviously, they have different chefs.  Problem is their stuff is not consistent.

The young lady at the counter is absolutely darling and most times she is very attentive however it's clear she doesn't have waiting experience.  I would LOVE to be able to rub off many of my years of experience on her.  She has the personality but needs more experience.  It's hard to watch her get so easily flustered when she's just so nice!!

As some others have said, this place is just on the brink of perfection and major success.  I'm patiently waiting for that to happen.  In the meantime, I'll continue to go in, enjoy the decor, eat some good food (most of the time), and just chill. 

Cheers to a good local business!!",rc5Yz3Vqt7lCu0_6TEV92A,1,0,3,ozXF5chTXku4Yk4Y8oqkXg

I used to come religiously over the Summer mornings but lately I haven't been coming for it's intended breakfast/lunch purpose.  I come as late as 7PM but the croissant sandwich I like tastes just as good at night as it does when I used to order it in the mornings. 

The delicious sweets behind the glass used to be labeled but not anymore.  I prefer it this way because I like asking the employees and having them describe what it is and what's in it.  My favorites by the way include the Nutella bomb and Banana cream pies.  At night, the chocolate croissants would be gone so I would bring my own pre-packaged nutella packet and get plain croissants then drizzle it on top and nom nom nom away.  

Croissants here are heaven.

The decor inside is impressive and calming (and I don't even know the least bit about interior design).  The extra room straight ahead from the entrance can host a party.  Actually, I'd recommend hosting a party in here.  It's one of the most ideal settings I have actually seen.  

The employees which include (owner)Chef Romano, Chef Hawaii, Ms. Alaska, and everyone else who I have encountered or helped me out during each visit has been kind, knowledgeable, friendly and helpful.  

If you're ever in the area, stop by and grab a quick bite of dessert and be on your way.  You can't really go wrong when choosing anything.  There's a board with daily specials so keep an eye on it.

We decided to try breakfast here.  We had a egg croissant sandwich and banana waffles.  Both delicious.  They even took the time to caramelize each banana slice with the blowtorch.  That little detail adds a world of flavor.  Waffles were also topped with a crumbled brittle.  Very good.  

Nutella latte was hot and yummy and served in a real mug.  Always a plus!

It is very cute inside with tables or cozy velvet chairs.  

There are loads of cakes, truffles bon bons and goodies to choose from but they are not cheap.  Chocolates are like $2 a piece.  They are very pretty though and there are some exotic flavors like Guinness and lavender.

My adventure to hit all the local bakeries with chocolate croissants with the baby brought me here. It was a windy chilly Monday afternoon but this place is perfect for a cup of joe, latte, etc. 

I wasn't in here long so I didn't get to look around too much, but the one thing that caught my eye was the display case holding all the yummy treats. Of course I was going to get the banana cream pie but then I also decided I needed to get the cheesecake or brownie parfait. The guy helping me told me to get the cheesecake. Unfortunately my tunnel vision missed and forgot about the chocolate croissant. It looked delish, but I decided then that I would be coming back. 

Verdict: loved love loved the banana cream pie. The crust was my favorite....so flaky and awesome.  The filling was good but the pie crust was the winner hands down. 

The cheesecake wasn't my favorite.  It was a bit salty for my liking.  The crust was similar to a cracker and that's what made it super salty.

I went when it first opened, I had been anxiously waiting for it since I had tried Megan Romano's desserts at Aureole. 

We went there for breakfast wanting to try a bunch of things, chose a breakfast sandwich and a quiche as well as a blackberry scone and gelato. The space is decorated really nice and you can tell a lot of thought went into the details. Everybody that works there is really nice too. Anywho, the breakfast items and pastry were ok, nothing out of this world. I thought the scone was kind of dry in fact. But the gelato was OUT OF THIS WORLD! We tried grapefruit and strawberry and they were incredible, the taste was so pure! It was like taking a bite out of the freshest fruit out there!

On my most recent visit I went in the evening (they are open til 7 so that's a major plus) for the sole purpose of getting my husband a treat. I ended up getting some bon bons, truffles, chocolate-covered graham crackers and oreos. In theory, they were all for my husband but since I purchased two of each, I decided when I got home to try one. OMG! I ended up trying one of each and let me tell you, they were all FANTASTIC! This is some seriously good chocolate folks. It is on the pricey side, 1.50-2 dollars a piece but well worth it. I think if they were cheaper I would end up buying 20 pieces and eating them all by myself! So tis way, you feel like it's a treat to eat and you don't devour it. You are able to savor each bite.

Everything about Chocolate & Spice is above standards for cafes in Vegas. Mostly because there are so few of these gems around town.

But C&S comes to the rescue with a spacious cafe with multiple seating options and numerous choices as to what will delight your palate. 

My friend and I came here after having had lunch and we were on the search for something sweet. We both chose the Nutella Bomb Cake. I got mine with a vanilla latte. Both were perfectly prepared. The cake was not super sweet, but provided just the right amount of dessert for me to be satisfied. I especially enjoyed the Kit-Kat like crisp wafer on the bottom. My latte was actually even better than the cake - served in a nice large cup, accompanied by a saucer so I could sip and enjoy my beverage without the fear of burning my hands while doing so.

There's maybe 3 people in total who work here, including the chef, so the service is a tad slow. However, once the food came - I was glad it took a little longer. The chef really took her time with each meal. I had the Nutella latte and New Jersey egg sandwich on a croissant. The runny egg was cooked to perfect & the hash browns were extremely delicious . My bf got the egg breakfast burger , which he said was absolutely perfect. The price is very straight forward I think we paid $8.50 per meal. Overall I gave it 4/5 only because it took a little long considering it was us and two other couples here. Compliments to the chef, she was amazing!

Banana Cream Pie = Probably the best thing here. Tasty and packed full of heavy whipped cream. Mine had some semi-ripe banana slices (tasted green). I think the whipped cream could use some additional flavor infused (vanilla bean?) cause right now it just tastes like plain old piped on whipped cream. The tart shell could also be a little more substantial. Right now it crumples too easily just from picking it up. I would urge the pastry chef here to try the Banana Cream Pie at Tartine.

Chocolate Bomb = Looks fantastic. Nailed it as far as looks go. It looks irresistible. Too bad, the taste didn't match the visual spender. Not enough chocolate flavor for me, but that's just my opinion.

This place is 80% of the way to being a great bakery. The details will propel this place to legendary status. The poached egg brioche plate for example was very well done. The dried prosciutto chips were amazingly tasty and intensely 'porky'. The dressing on the lettuce, complimented the poached egg perfectly.

I was having incredible macaroni and cheese.  But something strange happened.  I guess the owner and staff bring their kids after school.  They really need to speak with their kids about speaking to guests-customers.  Yes if there is an emergency or problem let us know.  But their kids need to be controlled about what they say.
I needed to use the restroom.  There was a trash bag in between the two restrooms.  I wasn't sure which restroom was being worked on.  A little boy said in an authoritarian voice ""There is an employee in there"".  Okay I look again at the trash bag, both restrooms, at the child and up and down the hall.  Again the boy says ""What are you looking for?""  So I go back to my table.  Later,  I try to use the restroom. By this time another child was sitting down with the little boy.  They were starring at me.  The boy said ""Do we know you?""
All the boy had to say was ""I think there is someone in there.""  But this didn't happen.  I really don't want to deal with ""Malcolm in the Middle"".

The elegant decor was the first thing that caught my eye and the classy touch to its color scheme had me peering inside every time I passed by for church at St. Joseph Husband of Mary. 

Today, I finally got a chance to try the bakery out with a galpal and soon after I got in, almost immediately hopped to check out the cute little creative goodies. There were truffles that started at $1.50 each and pastries (including creme brulee and this nutella cake bomb thingamagigy) that cost about $3.75, both excluding tax. Be ready to indulge yourselves in some high quality sweets but don't forget to pan your gaze to the right of the bakery wall where the menu items are listed in colorful chalk. Why? Because they actually have lunch/breakfast specials that range between $6-8. My friend ordered braised chicken with vegetables and aromatic rice while I got a pastrami panini with fontina cheese, caramelized onions and cranberry. Both orders were classic, savory & tasteful, and if you're especially hungry, opt for the latter because its size is merely an illusion to how filling it actually is. 

I found myself spacing out a number of times to the aesthetic atmosphere the bakery brought. It had some familiar, classy tunes playing in the background and I found it adorable how everything was neatly arranged, from the napkins to the water dispenser (which had oranges in it!), to the artistic couches and beautiful displays. Even the Christmas tree and bathroom were color schemed to the familiar purple, green and brown flowery swirls.

We all had bites of each others including: the banana cream pie, nutella bomb, and the cheesecake with blueberries.  The banana cream pie was so flakey and the bananas and cream weren't overly sweet, the perfect little touch was the little bit of white chocolate at the bottom.  The cheesecake with blueberries was just right and the nutella bomb was good though more chocolatey tasting than nutella.

I'm always a little reluctant to leave a review that includes negative feedback. What business owner wants to read that? However, it's from honest feedback we can take a close look and make corrections when needed. 

Almost none of the huge array of deserts were labeled.  A big chocolate covered ball could contain anything. While it looks pretty. I have no idea what I am getting. Please label the deserts.

If you cannot label the deserts, have someone at that area of the counter to tell me what they are and help me make a selection. I had to wait until I got to the register (away from the deserts) to ask what the items were, all with people waiting in line behind me. Who wants to be the person holding up the show?

My chocolate croissant tasted faintly of meat. I am a vegetarian so that made it even more unwelcome. Some may actually like chocolate and turkey. :-)

Finally, when I went up to buy another item, I waited a long time before anyone helped me. I was the only person waiting. The counter staff were busy making sandwiches. No problem there, but I was not acknowledged for quite some time. I'd rather get my order taken quickly so I may sit and enjoy myself than stand there for 3 or 4 minutes while a person makes a sandwich. 

Its interesting because as I stood there, I noticed how nicely the drop shadow of their logo was painted on the wall. They have the details right in many way. Its wild how so much work can go into a place and yet my perception diminishes over such small things as waiting an extra 60 seconds, but it does.

The egg & cheese croissant was mighty fine.
My latte had no froth and was basically milk and espresso. Not so great.

In short, please:
Keep up the great work on the egg & cheese croissant. Excellent!
Make it easier to choose a desert. 
Pay attention to my order. (Simple mistake... it was QUICKLY and kindly corrected.)
Get a solid latte going. 
Minimize my wait and/or make me feel like you care that I am waiting. Don't wipe down the counter and arrange stuff while I stand there unattended to.

The quality is great and I think the prices are very reasonable...put those two things together and I think it's quite a steal for gourmet treats (I put up pics of the menu w/ prices). 

This time around the BF and I had a hard time deciding what to get but settled on: 

Banana Cream Pie ( pastry crust shell coated in white chocolate, vanilla bean custard, bananas, whipped cream and caramel honey sauce) . BF and I don't like banana cream pies in general. We never gravitate towards them since jell-o pudding stuffed diner pies have turned us off. The fact that it is the most popular item though, we had to try. The white chocolate on the crust shell was a good call as it made sure that the crust will never get soggy but added a nice texture and flavor. The custard was wonderfully done, bananas were fresh, the whipped cream and caramel were just perfect. If someone can make me like something I normally don't, I am a believer. 

We also got a oatmeal currant cookie - they asked if we wanted it warmed which was nice. It had a citrusy profile about it which wasn't expected but nice. I'm not a crunchy cookie fan too much and had the greatest desire to see this as a crust to something though. 

BF got another caramel latte here as theirs is good. 

To take home we got a peach apple cobbler pie and a espresso shortbread cookie sandwich with expresso chocolate bits and dulce de leche in it. Cobbler was pretty good with the ice cream we had at home. That cookie though- that is a epic cookie. I want a box full of them.

Their savory items look quite nice so it is something we need to make plans to try sometime. 

The staff has been very nice, both times. This time we even got samples of the vibrant and fresh sorbets and ice cream to wet the palette while we were trying to decide. With the warm staff and the pretty yet comfortable surroundings makes this a place that you can hang around a while. They encourage it - there are board games in the back even. 

I want a place like this to succeed and for a month in it seems they are doing alright. Would like to spread the word so will be planning a Sunday brunch UYE (unofficial yelp event) coming up in July once my nutritional study in June is over.

 I think the ball truffles were my favorite, the Acai berry was a definite winner and the champagne was a little on the hard side, but still delicious.

I tend to express enthusiasm when I arrive to bakeries, so I start off by saying ""this is my first time here what's popular?"" or What's your favorite dessert?"". I was expecting to get a brief genuine synopsis instead it was bunch of short answers and a sign to checkout. I felt I wasn't given any incentive to come back, except for my own knowledge of what dessert to try based on what I read.    

I tried the Quiche with salad and I ate the banana cream pie for dessert.
I felt the Quiche tasted good, despite it being over baked. 
Banana cream pie was awesome, with a buttery flaky crust.
Chocolate mousse is a hit or miss on freshness.

The cheery atmosphere alone makes it a spot worth visiting, especially if you are sporting two X chromosomes. I would describe it as Parisian while noting that my Paris experience is limited to a couple of days when I was 17, so there. 

While I was there, a group of ladies were hosting a baby shower, and it definitely has the perfect baby/bridal shower vibe. 

Don't think that it is merely a bakery serving up sweet sensations. Yes, they do offer a case filled with tempting sugary selections, but they also have savory items suitable for a light brunch or lunch. I called ahead to see if they were serving quiche, and they were! When I arrived, I was tempted by everything. Their display case is a thing of beauty and wonder. However, I had came for the quiche, so although the chicken pot pie and vegetable frittata were strong contenders, I stuck with egg pie and coffee. 

Take note: they also have gelato, or it may be ice cream...they have a frozen, delicious treat. 

Served in an individual, miniature pie pan, the quiche featured caramelized onions and ham. The ham was deli-sliced, not chunky. The quiche execution was tasty, although a tad salty, and I could have dealt with a few more fillings. I was sad that there wasn't a little salad to go with it, but that is just being picky. 

Regardless, it was a delightful brunch experience. The coffee was strong and good. Plus, I saw no less than 10 reasons to return. I have no doubt if you have a sweet tooth, you will be enthralled, but even the savory suiters (like myself) won't be disappointed.",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,20,18,5,Yt5i-rDw5YJuwRJpDzZM_g

Nutella bomb.... Amazing! Not too rich, and every bite is perfect. 
Banana cream pie.... Never had one like it. It's pretty and the crust is flaky and delicious.
Strawberry parfait...delicious, but I thought the cake was a bit dry. Still very tasty.
Strawberry macaroon...I did not taste this one, but I got three different opinions. Husband said it was too rich, and the in laws loved it. I guess it depends on how sweet you like your pastry. 

The service was good, not excellent. The girl behind the counter is young, and seems to get slightly irritated when you ask what she may consider too many questions. My advice would be to display what each pastry is to avoid those questions. The bakery itself is very pretty, and clean. It's a great place to grab a cup of coffee and girl talk.

Owned and operated by Las Vegas Boulevard veteran Megan Romano, last seen during a December 2012 trip with friends before relocating to Las Vegas, Chocolate and Spice had long been on the 'to return' list, and when absolutely atrocious customer service from the new team at Bonjour Bakery quickly turned me off to ever recommending their goods again the timing proved fortuitous, though the simple pairing of the words ""Aunt"" and ""Jemima"" soon left me wondering just how 'artisan' anything else could be from a pastry chef so bold as to peddle her goods at the Downtown Summerlin ""Farmer's Market.""

Admittedly a hit and miss experience during the previous visit, some items shining while others were texturally compromised or simply over sugared, trip two to the cute West Sahara space saw little changed in terms of décor or execution, the oft-raved scones still as delicious as ever with blueberries in place of cherries while two cookies fared quite well as crisp rims encircled buttery centers that avoided the common pitfall of trending too sweet.

Tempted by a half-dozen cakes, even at the early hour of 7:30am, it was unfortunate that the brightly colored red velvet was fairly faint with cocoa considering cream cheese frosting that was appropriately tangy with a texture smooth as silk, and although the brownie upped the chocolate content plenty there was something strange about the brownie's overall texture - neither salt nor caramel really prevalent, instead replaced by a cloying sweetness and 'coating' sort of mouthfeel that leads one to question the presence of paraffin amongst the ingredients used.

Moving last to one of the restaurant's prepped-to-order signatures, a ""Crème Brulee"" French Toast that proves a bit of a misnomer as the bread is never actually torched after being dredged in custard and pan fried crisp, it is here that the main source of my complaints truly came to light - the answer to a question of whether the maple syrup was 100% pure answered with the name of Monsanto's favorite racially tinged pseudo-syrup making me thankful I always carry my own while putting into question the quality of every single item I'd earlier consumed.

Considered by some to be one of the city's best locally owned bakeries, but clearly willing to cut corners despite prices that that certainly aren't ""cheap,"" one is left to wonder how Chef Romano has gotten so far with such a business model, an Trotter alumni who would no doubt disappoint her former employer if he were able to walk into Chocolate and Spice today.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,9,6,2,RUadSVtUGtkqQzgZ7xPPcQ

Banana Cream Pie:
I love banana cream pie and their version is just delicious. It's light enough and not super sugary. 5/5

Macaron with Cream and Fruits:
I love straight up macarons but I'm not too fond of adding cream and all kinds of other stuff to it. Just give me 2 macaron shells and filling in the middle - anything more than that is too much for me to handle. 3/5

Pineapple Upside Down Cake:

As a bakery a little on the higher end clientele wise, you would hope for better customer service. 
My friend and I are regulars so you would also think that service would be really good for us, but no. We are barely greeted, sometimes not at all. Our order has been messed up several times. 

Today I finally talked to the owner to ask why I was given different cheese than what's on the menu. She said because she ""assumed"" that I wanted cheddar instead (this wasn't the first time). So I began to explain that I wanted what is advertised on the MENU and she cut me off and walked off. No apologies. The funny part about this is I had just told her earlier that another one of my orders was messed up several weeks prior.

Also, the ants crawling around in the back seating area are not very welcoming. 

Its just extremely unfortunate that I have given C&S so many chances to prove themselves  because I love the place. But I continuously get let down. A deep hearted sincere apology would be nice but is never offered.

If you are wondering, my family has also purchased a $300 cake from you.

On one occasion my friend asked if you guys had anything with peanut butter in it, in which we were told no. However, when we pointed to a candy and asked what it had in it your staff replied peanut butter. This also happened with another item containing banana.

I was a little intimidated walking in the first time and expected to be bombarded by lots of creamy goodness that I can't stomach (literally), and so I planned my exit strategy accordingly as I approached the counter.  I was bombarded as predicted by several amazing looking pastries and desserts, but luckily I found sanctuary in a sandwich.  That first visit I got there relatively late in the day (1:30 or so) and the sandwich options seemed picked through.   The only one I saw still seemingly available in the display was the Turkey with Gruyere on the Cranberry Wheat bread.  Luckily this sounded delicious (and usually Gruyere cheese doesn't affect me as much as others) so I went with it and also got an iced green tea to go.  Result: I'm officially never going to a Subway or Port of Subs for lunch ever again.  Okay I was never going to go anyway, but what I mean to say is NONE OF YOU SHOULD EITHER.  All of the ingredients from the turkey, veggies and gruyere worked so beautifully with the cranberry wheat bread.  It was almost like another take on the popular Bobbie sandwich from Capriottis sans stuffing the way the turkey and cranberry bread went so well together.  

On the 2nd visit this afternoon, I asked if I could customize the sandwich a little and they were very open to it, simply asking ""What would you like?"".   I asked for the turkey sandwich without cheese and with added applewood bacon which I saw being used in another sandwich.  Not a problem apparently and they asked if I wanted it toasted.  I tend to always answer yes to that question so I went with it.   I thought it was even better this 2nd time around proving for the 4,345,315,524th time that bacon makes everything better.  I'm officially in love with this cranberry bread.  

The sandwich runs about $7 and with a drink it comes to about $10 and is worth every penny.  Both times service was done efficiently and with a smile.    The only minor gripe I have so far is neither time was I provided a bag to carry the sandwich out in (only in a small cardboard box) which made it a little more difficult to transport than I'd like.  Such a small price to pay for a perfectly crafted sandwich.

One of these days I plan to trek down to Chocolate and Spice on my way home after work or on a weekend so I can try some of their dessert and pastry offerings and then go home and die.

We started off our morning with an amazing assortment of Fresh croissants and other light flaky pastry items. They use a lot of dark chocolate in the twists and other pastry and it is just enough to sweeten it up but not overpower it with sugar. I decided to walk into the bakery and get a mocha since they also offer a full selection of Coffee and teas.  Bingo another great offering, the mocha was perfect, and not overly sweet, I was also able to talk to the main chef Megan Romano, she can sure get her bake on.

Take the time to go support this awesome bakery, not only is it locally owned but the decor is very modern and comfortable, With nice seating available for a quick bite or a coffee or book club meeting with a group this a must visit. Get your baked good, Breads, Coffee, Tea and to die for candy and cakes. This is a place I think you do not want to pass on. Enjoy!!",sqJZt_Z144RWGk4bdKTpSw,16,12,5,QvZX3d1roYU5_3PP_P3HoA

Too bad their close through the Labor Day weekend coz we have to drive back home to L.A. on Sunday. Otherwise, I'd make another visit.  It is that good!

The coffee was very fresh and perfect! I love Italian coffee. 
Everyone's reviews (great pictures) helped me decide. 
I was big so I shared with my daughter. The couscous was soooo amazing I had to order an extra side for my kids! Turkey BLT was fresh and did not disappoint.

And my daughter loved her hot chocolate. At almost $5/drink, it's still not much more than a Starbucks but tasted so much better. 

My last visit, I decided to try food with my drink. For two drinks and one breakfast sandwich split between us our bill was over $18. This is ridiculous to me. The sandwich was nothing special at $8. I also had to wait almost 10 minutes to get a workers attention in the back. When I finally got her attention, she acted like i was putting her out. When she brought us our order, my iced caramel macchiato was nothing more than an unsweetened iced coffee. I had to wait another few minutes to pull her out of the back again and explain that she gave me the wrong drink. Instead of making me a new one, she just dumped a spoonful of caramel in the drink and handed it back. Not cool! I couldn't even wash down my $8 sandwich with my $5 drink...",R1R33699GRsW3cz_2YIaJA,3,1,3,T2srAs1DL16xOyS016bsNA

I'm gonna try their chocolate covered strawberry next time. I got the trio chocolcate mousse and the nutella bombe. They're very chocolatey so make sure you have some milk or lots of water or something.

It's my second time there and I do wanna head back down there (when I'm close to the area) to eat. I would like to try their croissant-wich among other stuff.

So I came in and talked to Megan as well as her sous chef, they were very nice and gave me a great price! It was finally the day of the party and the cake was delivered to my suite (they only charged a small fee for the delivery which I thought was a huge plus!) . I was so amazed at how beautiful it looked! Not only was the cake beautiful it also tasted really good! We got three flavors which were red velvet with creme cheese filling, chocolate with chocolate ganache filling, and pound cake with raspberry jelly. I have to say their chocolate cake was thee best out of the three! I wish I had made it the biggest tier!

5802185,2015-02-16,1,nYzCr8fcJ2ci4aiB1-hB6w,"I'm very on the fence with this place. My first experience was very lack-luster but the second time was better. My opinions of restaurants are usually influenced heavily by a cost-benefit of 'is this food tasty enough to warrant me paying X for it'. On my first visit I got the Croissant Sandwich. It was okay - it w:as exactly like something I can and do make at home for myself. There was no time consuming aioli or specialty greens put on it - it was a croissant, with egg, ham, and cheese. Not worth an outrageous $7.95. 

On my second attempt I got a lunch special (1/2 sandwich, and soup) with the Roasted Turkey sandwich that I thought was outstanding and totally worth the outrageous $7.95 price tag. I highly recommend that sandwich, it was great.

We've tried several of the cakes as well and they are good. Not amazing. Their website is somewhat cumbersome and not user-friendly (like when you click on ""Menu Pricing"" and get a menu with absolutely no pricing). All in all I think it's a little over-rated and overpriced. ...apparently because it's a Megan Romano venture, as if that means you can charge higher prices for simple/average items (ex: croissant sandwich).",5Eo9TdRJt9YXMy4kfdUbcQ,2,1,3,RHWCXc-7oUd3WXmhVhBz-Q

Unfortunately, we were disappointed.  It is a bakery specializing in a very limited quantity of dessert breads and other dessert products.  And, while its Chocolate Truffles were good, they did not particularly stand out, and were quite expensive at $1.50 per small truffle.
