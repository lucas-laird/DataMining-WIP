Why can't fast food employees follow directions on how you want your food made. So disappointing.,KEerqlFNhzl1I-yVK6mHVA,0,1,1,ysuU3uf0fU-gPd9Ow2z6xQ

I ordered their new lucky charms shake for my son and sent him to get our order when our number was called and they refused to give him his shake, only gave the food. I sent him back with the receipt and told him not to come back without his shake, teaching him how to handle these situations without getting out of character. He showed it to prove we paid for it but didn't get it and they made it for him. But what was terrible was when I got back in line to order myself an ice cream cone I had to wait 10 minutes, then they asked me what I was waiting for. I gave them my receipt so they made my cone, but the girl that handed me my cone had filthy hands like she was outside playing in the dirt. I told her that her hands are filthy while she touched all on my cone, she didn't care just turned around and kept handling food.",98h9g4U5eAw4HoJB1Kq50g,1,1,2,rsJXVgDe2eUnpALwBUS6Dw

Other people will gladly take that job off your hands. People don't realize them homeless people that's around that store probably can do the job better. Smh corporate should do a pop up and see this place.,S0I7sHnJ820Bn6wkwETyxQ,0,0,1,nzTOjxiTGhBv8INKt9ssxA
