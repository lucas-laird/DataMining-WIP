Is it closed for breakfast and lunch during the week? Yes. Is there a limited food selection that pretty much sticks to the basics? You bet. Is the quality of food questionable? Absolutely!

But for $8.99, it is the best buffet around. Just make sure you flash your shiny player's card, which takes only 5-20 minutes to get (depending upon how hard someone is arguing for a comp over their $30 slot play for the day). Or else you pay $14.99 for dinner, which is a ridiculous rate for what you end up getting. Heck, I can admit this. 

There's the typical salad bar, carving station, Mexican/Chinese/Italian offerings, and some ""American"" choices that change depending upon what night you go, but with no identifiable schedule. They claim every night is Prime Rib Night, but I think that's a tall tale...it tastes like roast beef. You be the judge.

They also have an impressive selection of pizza that tastes nostalgically like the stuff they used to serve in my elementary cafeterias. One time, they had out a pizza that I swear was topped with Baco's Bacon Flavor Bits. Oddly enough, it was some of the best stinkin' pizza I've ever had.

The husband was quick to disagree, however.

The drinks are self service and include a wide variety of sodas, juices, and milks. The coffee is some of the worst I've ever had the displeasure of trying.

The dessert selection is all right. The diabetics really win in this category. The selection of sugar free goodies is staggering. And delicious.

The staff is friendly and efficient. Seating is ample. Food is always stocked, and generally fresh. Not always. But for $8.99, you can't have it all.

You want it all? Go to the Rio or the Bellagio.

Me? Imma stick with my low expectations, cheap budget, and iron stomach.",owlCjxNkDW02M3ABygGgag,0,0,4,nba07dVGRBH2LRrqAxft0Q

Luckily we signed up for the card and paid $6.99 a person but even for that price the food was HORRENDOUS. Half the buffet food area was closed and the food was bland and unappitizing. Carving station either served the meat too raw or overcooked.  Manager there was pretty rude too.

Only come if you just want a cheap and  quick meal.",ZlgN353ETLzPa9zFm7tcrQ,0,0,1,nPRD2pPWtlt_44Ob7wxEzg
426045,2007-12-10,0,0lxyY2bwmpde2QHcnh8fZQ,"I had comps from Sahara so I gave their buffet a try.  Overall it is a reasonable value for the money but with a big warning.

The Sunday brunch has prime rib, cold crab and shrimp and decent variety for additional dishes such as potatoes, rice, string beans, etc.  The prime rib was more rare than is typical at buffets which usually serve medium done prime rib.  It was pretty good quality.

The carving station also had turkey and ham.  The ham was very good as well but I didn't try the turkey.  The crab was a bit on the small side as were the shrimp.  I couldn't find hot butter and the cocktail sauce was alright.

A major weakness was the lack of desserts.  They only had about 8 or so choices.  Nothing looked very good.  Almost every other buffet in Vegas has choices of pies and cakes and often ice cream or gelato.  Not here.

Some of the lesser dishes were duplicated in identical lines to better serve a big crowd but it wasn't extremely busy.  I would have preferred more unique dishes but if it does get crowded an identical line would speed things up.  They were set up for an additional serving line but it wasn't be used this past Sunday morning.

The major caveat here is that it is very dimly lit and looks dirty.  Not from the plates which are face down as they should be or the serving stations but the decor.  I'm not sure how old it is but I wouldn't be surprised if it has never been remodeled.  This detracts from the buffet more than one would think.

One of the reasons why the buffet is cheaper than typical is beause there is much less service.  You get your own drinks and bussers don'[t come around that often--perhaps because there so few of them.

The cost including tax was $13.24 and it includes the cold seafood and champagne from a cart operated at the left of the buffet.  A beer is $3.00 extra.  The champagne was semi-secco and probably pretty cheap but I couldn't see the labels.  It was served in a plastic clear cup.

Overall, it is okay for the money but probably just if you are in the casino.  I wouldn't go out of the way for it and if I didn't have a $10 comp, I would not have eaten there in the first place.",DBzVCu2k2z-l5nl0rbVqmg,1,0,3,vzp11wHZ56yu22EldWJrxg

For $6.99, it got the job done.  And I was there late, around 9:45.  Line is a mile long, so go early.

Pizza was terrible. Fine.  Everything else was okay.  Like I said, for $6.99 it was good enough.  better than the $25 we spent at Harrah's Cafe.

We got in right before they closed, and they told us that they will be taking the food away at 10:20. It was 9:55. Okay, 25 minutes. Which means, go and get as much food as you can first, before they start to clean up. Grab the salad... oohh, tacos.. mmm, prime rib. Corn, you can't screw up corn, some green beans. Let's top it off with some clam chowder, and you're good to go. The desserts looked horrible, so i didn't touch that.

So total ghetto-ness.  It was a little sad that I actually saw a wedding reception here but to each their own.  The meal was just $6.99 with the Sahara Player's Card.  If not then it would had been $12.99.  Seriously not worth it.

The only good thing was actually the Prime rib.  It was better than some of the other higher end buffets on the strip and I've been to them all.  Everything else (yea... all 15 other items) were less than appealing.  it was disappointing to see that the dessert and fruits had more variety than the entrees.  I only had the ribs, prime rib, ham and the fruits.  Everything else didn't really seem fitting to eat.  The ambiance was non-existent as it failed to portray a Saharan Bazaar.

No ambiance or even a remotely pleasant environment in which to enjoy a meal.  There are no servers.  Everything, including all your beverages, is self service in old, plastic plates and cups.  We visited one time for breakfast.  

The only thing I would consider decent was the omelette that was freshly prepared for me.  Everyting on the buffet appeared as though it had been under the heat lamps since the beginning of time.  Limp, soggy bacon, thin gravy, and watery scrambled eggs.

Orleans' French Market Buffet has better food and price without the Club Card and they are far from the strip. I'll save my comps for rooms and the Caravan Cafe. 

It seems that their Buffet is situated in a former Poker Room or Gambling Room and right next to a Studio or Showroom. Its so far away from the entrance that its not even worth it. 

I highly recommend you to stay away as a VIP Sahara Member. If you have no taste palettes, go eat away. I have been going to the Sahara for two-three years and it tastes bad. Go to the Nascar Cafe...eat the B3 Burrito and its yours free...or go to the Caravan Cafe and actually eat something.

Several times, he cut me the cooked edge of the slab of meat. When I asked for something more medium rare, he cut me some tiny wedge. I was pretty pissed off. It was as if he was intentionally giving me the worst parts of the slab of prime rib, but then I watched and saw some other people get mediocre slices also.  A few lucky folks got slices where a normal buffet would give you what you expect in a slice of prime rib.

I seriously think Hometown Buffet is better. What stood out here was they had flavored water on their choices of fountain drinks. The Pasta and pizza station was ok. Several different pizzas rotating every so often. Usual pasta selections that you would expect/see from a buffet like Hometown or any other big chain buffet. The main entries they had on a Tuesday dinner was nothing special. Rice pilaf, Beef Goulash, chicken, squash and zucchini, friend calamari, some other items that didn't look too appealing to be quite honest. Carving station consisted of ham, turkey, and prime rib. The prime rib was WAY too rare for me. But I believe some people like that. I mean the juices were straight red. along with most of the cut I had. I went for another try, and same thing. They had a Chinese and Mexican station. Make your own taco, if you saw the one at Sizzler, its almost identical. The Chinese station had your sweet and sour chicken, Veggie chow mien, and a few other typical entries you would see at a Chinese take out place--imitating their quality and appearance as well.  They have the usual salad bar, where you can make your own, and also pick from premade ones. Average at that, nothing to say here. Horrible was the dessert selection. Looked like things you can get in bulk at Costco and just put in individual wrappers and served. No cheesecake so don't expect that, nothing extravagant or exotic, or anything that comes close to it. There is ice cream machine but that is expected. I forgot to add, NO SUSHI.

Positive thing are lines move fast. There are a lot of seating, and the area is very big. 

Would I ever eat here again, maybe if I was on a budget and at $6.99 you do get what you pay for there. Anymore, probably not. But being in Vegas, why eat average--in other words; I probably won't be going back here whenever I'm in Vegas.",Qv0xMxEs9XHEqI_9zb8vcQ,1,0,2,1l9fJ9cIDwfVZveEWM7MMg

Anyone who rates this buffet above ""negative eleventy-billion"" either was smashing drunk at the time or eats through a tube.

This is the worst food I've ever had in my life. I've eaten at a lot of shitty restaurants, had tremendously ill-advised home cooking, and back in college, eaten things from the fridge that had their own ecosystem.

The buffet at the Sahara is the culinary equivalent of being cockpunched. If you don't have a cock, just punch yourself in the uterus; that'll do.

Despite it being a multi-national buffet with over *two dozen* entrees, there was nothing actually edible, save for the three-bean salad which was likely pre-made. Let's go down the things that were wrong, shall we?

- Champagne for the champagne brunch is served from a Miller Lite beer cart in the corner. In plastic 4-ounce cups.

- Cheese blintz: Dried out to the point of being crispy. Filled with cottage cheese. GROSS.
- Sausages: Squirted grease at me like an angry sea creature, then exploded into a grey powdery substance. 
- Scrambled eggs were unnaturally voluminous, like a bright yellow angel food cake. I think they jiggled at me.
- Bacon was a sad pile of fat strips with meat bits. 
- Roasted meats: They looked okay, but I stood at the station for 5 minutes without being helped; the only person back there was the egg station attendant. 
- Belgian waffle? More like Barfy ROFL. Chewy in all the wrong places.
- Every single thing at the Chinese food station was affront to humanity. Wonton soup was like alien eggs in seawater. Sweet and sour pork tasted like cleaning solution. 

Naturally, the management refused to give us a refund because we'd been there longer than 15 minutes. Heaven forbid we spend some time to talk to our fucking friends who got married at this hellhole. 

$14.99 per person down the drain. If you're savvy enough to Yelp, you shouldn't even be within spitting distance of the Sahara, much less IN it. Why are you reading this? Go down the street and eat an omelette at Bouchon, or a croissant at Jean-Philippe, and do the real eating someplace where they don't try to poison you.",8RamU2tsOai1MIokiYqC1w,8,5,1,K25-vQrnta-mEGiGjwRDVA

The buffet was cheap--under $10-- but somehow, I still feel like I didn't get my money's worth even for $10.  The food was terrifying.  There was salad that looked like it was about 5 days past the expiration date, everything at the hot side seemed to have some sort of white or brown sauce to cover up it's flaws, and all of the food seemed to have this desert camouflage sort of color to it.  Everything hot also had that light crusty-ness to it, the kind where you know it's been sitting out in the open for awhile and no one has touched it.  Surprisingly, the heat lamps that the food had been sitting under for hours failed to keep the food hot but rather a non-appetizing luke-warm temperature.

Your stomach will be mad at you if you go here.  You'll be mad at yourself for spending money here.  $8.99 is enticing and I'm sure that it's one of the cheapest around; don't be fooled-- stay away for your health's sake.  You're better off going to a fast food place and ordering off the dollar menu. If someone in your group suggest this place, even if they're on crutches, tell them you'll be happy to help them hobble away from this place.",GomlzJ2OiLCsiowRfWUl8g,2,1,1,-b7By0bxldK1aVLSyV57Jg

It took 3 tries for us to finally make it here.-

The 1st time the players club line was 100 people long,so we left.
2nd time we got the card but the buffet line was ridiculous, so we left.

This time I forgot my card so ONLY the card holder gets the discounted buffet-otherwise its $14.99!!

It is a small buffet--the food is bland & boring, hardly any desserts and Self-serve drink station with PEPSI products,coffee,tea and milk.

The carving station had a turkey end & a beef ends(at 6pm mind you-acted like they didn't have more)

 There was nothing special,very limited choice Its salad fixins &----salisbury steak,bbq chicken,bbq ribs,tacos,spaghetti,pizza,and sides like mashed potatoes,green beans and corn.

ok so for $8.99 w/players card it pretty cheap for a dinner buffet (you get what you pay for)BUT....FOR $14.99 WAY OVERPRICED.

I liked the Sahara though, nice selection of hot and tasty options. Also we won some money so the casino already gave me a good vibe. Not much could have upset me at that point, not even a bad buffet.",vgwdQ0fpDZdoTidJuwYq7w,0,0,5,BVljX4oL9T8e1B7BBMcStA

The food was bland - really lacking flavor.
The dessert selection was lacking - at least they had the ice cream machine.

The service - well, the lady cleaning the table and taking our used plates was really nice.  But everything else is self serve.

My friend and I were staying in the hotel because it was cheap and well, the buffet was definitely on the cheap side.  Even the buffets at Primm (stateline) are much better.",QPgXLWsDRplZilp2OciAiw,0,0,1,q-CuT6rVNyFie_XmJsexTg

We paid and sat anywhere we wanted, one lady took our cash and another lady just stood there telling us we could sit anywhere we wanted. 

The food was pretty good and even had a section for beer and wine, wasn't sure if that was included. The sushi was made for looks and not for flavor. 

There was this black guy working the ham and roast beef station, complete ass. Asked him for a second slice of beef and after giving me a dirty look, he chops off a chunk and literally tosses it on my plate.",BOU25_BWQnLdFJBKUe2XdQ,0,0,2,oyNLhApUx5VzRIL9_qrbCA

Went with a group of friends for dinner after we ate at another buffet for breakfast and we were not really that hungry or willing to spend a lot of money on food at another buffet or sit down restaurant. The food was filling. There was something for each of us to eat. It was cheap and we were not expecting anything overly exciting. Service was decent as with all of the food.

This place has four lanes of excess to choose from, multiple carving stations, frogurt, yogurt, cake, free softdrink refills, etc etc. Why is there no beer here, damn it? Getting trashed in Vegas is becoming surprisingly hard when you're doing all the stuff that has to be done here. 

Next stop is the Amazing Jonathan show, which was pretty funny. If I can ""blow"" one of the jokes, is when his assistant appears claiming to have won tickets to the Blue Men show and comes out with the blue markings all round her mouth. A very coarse show and funny.",1p4wP0QzgdWXWYnRSR7MBw,0,0,4,Vj1Hr4HrObU6DsXX42dttA

They should have called it (the TV dinner buffet)
