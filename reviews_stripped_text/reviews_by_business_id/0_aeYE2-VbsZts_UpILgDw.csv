I ordered the Hawaiian sticky ribs. The manager Phil came over and apologized that they were taking so long. He stated that the plate was not made properly, and he wouldn't let it leave the kitchen. That is how you do it in the food industry... If its not right, don't send it out and apologize to your patrons.

All in all the management was great, and all of the food was great. They definitely redeemed themselves for this 5 star rating. I recommend this restaurant.",IOP8E2EChwLy_Cn7FufZmw,0,0,5,wySJO2nllo8NyUbFHLOZ7g

Oh but there is more.  I ordered wings.  I'm still waiting for them.  Lazy Dog gave me a final bill but not an itemized statement.  You can guess what happened next.  When we requested the itemized statement, we were billed for the wings.  The bartender said, ""oh, you never got the wings?""

I started off with a Greens, eggs and ham.  It was a very fun small dish. It had small broccoli pieces, bacon (no ham) and a poached egg.  It's great for sharing.  The rest of the family had different culinary items varying from Italian (Chicken Parm and Pizza) to Mexican (Carne Asada) to Caribbean   Chicken.  Everyone loved their food.  

The Caribbean Chicken had a jerk sauce that while definitely not authentic was a nice hearty portion pared with thinly sliced cucumbers with a zesty sauce and rice.  It went well together.  They also serve Chinese food there also with a twist (I didn't try it).

If you are tired of eating the same old stuff, go to Lazy Dogs.  It's American Cuisine that's really good.  Oh yeah, people can bring their dogs to the restaurant outside.  All the dogs were well behaved.",FEJhYnXdFHhBqPwhAxsGmQ,1,1,4,fPHXFW-c3dU9rzEHh9fHgQ

265349,2015-06-29,0,0_aeYE2-VbsZts_UpILgDw,"It's not always about the food.

First off, the food is average, no gourmet here. It's all about the fat and smell which  makes it taste good.Therefore it's good....uh hah...   the staff is friendly..... as they should be, tips depend on it.
Next the noise, it's off the charts so there is no real possibility of carrying on a normal conservation without raising your voice. Everyone is trying to talk over the next to be heard. Add the music..... well ya get the point. We've been here about 6 times or so. About 8 of our friends have complained and also refuse to go back. We just wanted to see if it would settle down some.
We stopped in 6/28/2015 for ""one and done'' just to get out of the heat 114. Sitting at the bar is usually quieter. A ""dude"" next to us had other ideas. His menu spread out beside his phones to point that it interfered with our service area,  2 phones, not one but 2.... ear buds to make his calls and talking very loud. Ya know the drill ya always talk louder with your ear buds in. To make it worse he aimed his conservation in our direction not towards the service bar next to him. We politely asked him to direct his conservation in the other direction and we were told to F off. Next we called for the MOD to intervene and he was told to basically f-off also. (he always used the F bomb) I instantly thought..... what would happen on an aircraft at 32,000'........ slowly open the door...... and
The manager was totally unequipped to handle the situation. He stood next to us and he himself had to raise his voice to be heard over the ""dude"". .....but did nothing. Most people would take the conversation...... ""or would have been asked by management to take it outside or into the lobby"". That wasn't gonna happen. So we give it only 2 stars because the line staff is good at what they do but not paid to intervene.  The MOD on the other was in over his head and thought the use of a phone at the bar has now become ""acceptable etiquette"" and interfering with a patrons quiet space is now allowable...... wait till we catch him on an aircraft.......

A trip to a restaurant should never end this way.

And no , we will not return and will relay this to anyone who wants our opinion of Lazy Dog including our 8 friends in Summerlin.

Just as we left ""sexual preference"" also became an issue. Lucky for him we believe in the rule of law and not mob rule, in the old days......32,000 would be at ground level.",s3uivg3LZ_4lZ_hDsIBQWg,0,0,2,483kdTbL9N7O8tT99tihCQ

First we had to wait because we had six people and the Manager ""Melissa"" must ""approve"" all groups over 5-which the employees all discussed in front of us and I found to be weird and very uncomfortable as did they.  The food took a long time-service was friendly but slow.  Wrong dishes from other tables were waved in front of us.  The chicken pot pie was the worst we have ever had-no veggies that we could see and at the end after discussing our take home order portion, the waitress still got it wrong.  Needless to say it was a long grueling experience with poor but friendly service.  The manager-GM did come by and apologize (then more mistakes were made) and give us a partial credit.  The décor is nice. The Tater Tots are good. The specialty drinks are nice.  Fun place to take a dog. I will re evaluate the next time I visit.  The staff needs to be trained.  The worst part was at the end when my 6 year old had to go to the rest room and went in to a stall to be told to wait (as he was already in it) by a young lady who wanted to put toilet paper in all of the stalls-there was already toilet paper in it and she could have started on another stall.  Obviously she doesn't have kids or she wouldn't tell a 6 year old to wait for such a silly reason when she could have done another stall.  Plain silly and rude.

The food was very good and great quality and this means a lot coming from a picky eater like myself.  I started with the peach sangria that was perfectly sweet but not too sweet. They comped me a flatbread since it was my first visit. That was a very nice gesture and it was a perfect texture with light cheese and garlic, very tasty.  For my entree I enjoyed their chicken stir fry with hot and sweet sauce and brown rice.  The flavors were perfect and the cuts of chicken were good quality.  I was perfectly satisfied with my meal, but couldn't pass up dessert, so I went for their house made butter cake. It was nothing short of heavenly and topped off with vanilla ice cream.

ORGANIZED & CLEAN!
I have never seen any other bartender work so hard at keeping the bar so clean. Drea never stops moving her ninja like hands. If she is not serving the guests or making crazy drinks like some kind of robot, she is organizing and cleaning. I always see her serve a drink immediately followed by cleaning the bar top, wash a rack full of glasses, put in a food order, finished with making countless drinks for the rest of the restaurant.

The interior is warm and approachable, but I couldn't put my finger on its design inspiration. Looks like New Mexico meets Claim Jumper? So curious that I actually looked into it when we were waiting for service. Turns out it's inspired by a lounging dog near a fireplace at a lodge in Grand Teton, WY. Pretty cool and touches home as my husband has fam up there. 

The food is verrry eclectic, reminds me of a Cheesecake Factory in terms of - ""here is a bible of mediocre food offerings bound to interest somebody."" However, our selections were really tasty! The green chili mac n cheese app was amazing, very flavorful. Ordered a low calorie pasta salad with great citrus under notes.

We came around 7:30 or so and were promptly seated. Initially we were seated by our hostess at a small table for two, but asked our waiter if we could move to a larger table where it would be more comfortable for us since the patio area (which is for patrons who are dining with dogs) was mostly empty. The waiter happily obliged us. 
I've eaten at Lazy Dog's before with friends, but this was the first time I've been here since I became a dog owner and thus it was my first time dining in the patio area. Overall the patio area was nice. There were other patrons with their dogs, there was plenty of seating, several tv's, and a fire pit in the center. 
Our waiter was friendly, attentive, and accommodating. He took our orders for the pot roast and fish tacos. We also ordered a hamburger patty w/ brown rice for our pooch. He even asked us if we wanted all the dishes to come out at the same time, to which we said yes. Our dishes came out after about 10-15 minutes. I enjoyed the pot roast along with its gravy and the mashed potatoes and spinach that it came with. I just wish there was a little bit more of the pot roast because I was really hungry. My wife enjoyed the fish tacos and the Spanish rice it came with. My dog on the other hand, didn't really touch his food, but that's mainly because my pug is very finicky and it was served in a plate that was unfamiliar to him. That and he probably didn't like brown rice it came with (though he has no issue at all with white rice). Once we got home, he had no problem with the hamburger patty and ate it with zest.

She initially treated my wife rudely, raising her voice at my wife because she didn't understand our last name. We were with out of town guests and didn't want an issue. It was clear to Santana we weren't happy with her attitude.  We were then conveniently forgot about while waiting for a table. I complained about the wait, she said our table was being prepared and it would be about 2 minutes. Approximately 15 minutes later I told Santana I wanted to speak  with a manager. We were immediately seated. My son handed Santana the pager, she aggressively pulled the pager out of his hands. The manager, Eric,  was very good about our situation and we were comfortably reimbursed for the issues. Upon ordering our food, one of our of town visitors had ordered a half of a turkey sandwich. She removed the top of the sandwich and right there in the middle was a bug. She lost her appetite and the server took the sandwich to Eric. Eric returned to our table and apologized profusely, agreeing there was a bug in the sandwich. We were again properly reimbursed, Eric was great, managed his customers as he should. However the question remains if you piss Santana or another hostess or host off is your food compromised. Some make ask, ""Was this a coincidence""? I personally don't believe in coincidences.

The restaurant sits in the far northwest section of Downtown Summerlin.  It's a stand alone building, so it's pretty easy to find.  We were greeted by very friendly staff and were seated right away.  The waiter showed up promptly, offered suggestions from the menu, took our drink order and returned with our beverages very quickly. He was friendly, knowledgable about the menu, and professional. 

The menu is robust without being overwhelming.  There are interesting appetizers, salads and entrees for just about every appetite.  I decided on the Spicy Thai Chicken Salad.  The food came out in under 15 minutes.  My salad was fresh, filling and had just the right amount of kick.  Kudos for mixing the chicken throughout the salad, rather than piling it all on top.  And some extra recognition to our server for excellent service.  Jack was literally taking the last sip from his drink when the waiter showed up with a refill.  Awesome!

With the cool paw print decor everywhere, excellent service, and some pretty tasty food, Lazy Dog will certainly become a regular spot for me.",pphrt7iAXMjg8QqLHHUA2Q,1,3,4,u6bZRb1faxlvEmQq2Yr5Ig

We were sat within the 15-20 minute wait time they quoted, outside with our pup and there was a dirty bowl of water and dirty bowl of rice on the ground under our table still not picked up. Fine. We ordered our drinks and food as well as new clean water for the dog with our waitress.  first up was our soup. It was very bland, and I had to add a generous amount of hot sauce to flavor it. At this point we didn't have silverware or napkins, only the soup spoon that had come with the soup which was a bit messy because of all the melted cheese. The water for the pup still wasn't out yet so I asked the food runner to please get us some. We sat and chatted for a while after we were done with our soups and before our main dish came.  When the main dishes came we still didn't have silverware or napkins. My friend had to ask for them, and when they came they were filthy. My first bite into the pot roast was cold! The gravy was dried up and you could tell just by the sight of it that it had been sitting out quite a while.  I let the waitress know it was cold, but it seemed like we always had to get her attention because she didn't even bother to check on us.  I didn't like the pot roast at all, it was cold to begin with. The second time around the gravy was not a solid, so I could see that it was at least warm but so so dry. I could barely eat it. We tried to quickly get over the horrible entree and order dessert which was not so bad, but the spoons were soooo dirty- like food gunk crusted on it dirty. After we finished we wanted to get the hell out of there because it seemed like we were there forever and we were- Almost two hours. We waited for her to come back to check on us, clear the table, and drop our check but she wasn't around. I stood up and just remained standing until she saw I needed the check asap so we could leave. She finally noticed me, and gave me the ""I'll be right with you.""  It was probably 5 minutes after that, that our check was dropped.  I wanted to use a credit card but I knew that would have taken years to accomplish with this service so I paid cash.

First thing we did was ask for some ice water for four. The person who seated us said she was only a hostess and couldn't get us water. We waited another few minutes and our server came out. We asked for water as soon as possible, and some for our dog. It was about 105 degrees out, cooling off but not fast enough. After waiting for 12 minutes (I checked my phone as I texted our friends when we arrived), we still had no water and we decided to leave.

The busier this place gets, the lower the quality of food is I've noticed. It is a popular spot though because the food here is shockingly cheap compared to a lot of other restaurants and they have a wonderful beer selection but I have a major beef with this place, hence the reason it only gets 3 stars. 

The dishes they do well, they do great at. But the problem is that their menu is constantly changing so instead of getting better at their dishes, they would rather put out mediocre seasonal items, and constantly change their menu instead of getting better at what they are great at and giving their menu a little stability. For example, they had some the most amazing chicken tenders and fries basket. I'm talking some of the best chicken strips on the planet but they pulled them from their menu and replaced them with these mediocre buffalo chicken pops. Why do that? Why not just keep making what people love instead of making them feel forced to try something new? I get having seasonal items is important but not when the quality of food suffers. That said, they do have a lot of wonderful regular food items to choose from but they have no problem taking it off the menu with little or no notice to try something different that may or may not work out.",JaM27EA6DqGU-SLfk4aExw,0,0,3,2v-m7ni1sCb4Zn7V2XWnqA

997584,2016-11-01,0,0_aeYE2-VbsZts_UpILgDw,"Woof Woof! Man's best friend can now go on a date with you.

No matter where I am, I love to try new places even if they've been there for a while. Luckily, this place just opened in Downtown Summerlin. 

Met my human friends here for a get together dinner. Like all Yelpers, I turned to Yelp to provide me with the important details of a place. After looking over all the essential pieces for planning a dinner, I screenshot the location with address to them. 

We showed up without a reservation but the wait wasn't too long. We were seated inside near the fireplace. Talk about warm and cozy with your friends. Our server Laura was awesome! We were all about a few under by this time of night and very glad to have a server who could roll with our humor and craziness. Since it was everyone's first time eating at Lazy Dog, we were very dependent on her suggestions. She gave us a few minutes to look over the menu and would come back to take our beverage order. 

The guys ordered the Lazy Dog House sampler. The best way to try their house brews without going under the table before dinner. I had the Rum Barrel Punch and my girlfriend ordered the Snow Cap. The guys were satisfied with the sampler. They really liked the Blonde Ale. I liked my rum punch and after tasting the Snow Cap, I think I would order that next time. It's very similar to drinking iced coffee with Kahlua. 

Laura was back and ready to take our order. Sorry, we will still need more time...but we will order some small plates to start. We placed an order of the Hush Puppies,  Caramelized Brussels Sprouts and Cajun Fries. The first two selections were Laura's suggestions. The Hush Puppies was basically a bite size baked potato. So good but be sure to cut it in half before eating. The insides were very (temperature) hot. If you are not a big fan of Brussels Sprouts then you might want to try it at Lazy Dog. You can hardly taste the Brussel sprout flavor. It is completely overpowered by the lemon, garlic, butter and capers. I love Brussel sprouts so it was too flavorful for me but it was a new way to try it. 

We finally ordered our entrees...items that were ordered includes the slow-braised lamb shank, the bone-in pork schnitzel, and the chicken poblano. It seemed like our food came out in lightning speed. Talk about fall off the bone braised lamb shank. It was so juicy with the sauce and the mashed potatoes complimented it very well. If you have tried a schnitzel from Switzerland then you might want to visit the Lazy Dog. Their schnitzel isn't exactly like Switzerland's but it's darn close. Don't forget to squeeze the lemon to bring out a new flavor. The only part of the chicken poblano that I tried was the crispy corn cake that topped off the dish. Those little cakes are packed with a spicy kick. 

Sweet & sinful ending to a wonderful dinner meant ordering the Butter Cake. This delectable dessert could make a man who normally doesn't eat dessert take a bite. The cake that is the foundation of the dessert is baked to perfection. This filling cake is topped with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream. The best ice cream flavor ever! The strawberry compote is absolutely lovely and I wish they would pack it in a little mason jar and sell it. 

It was a great night with friends at the Lazy Dog. Thank you Laura for an amazing experience!",b55p0Ga74GiedqtrLbWIFg,1,0,5,FK7u6htOEY_iu6wXfxz4lA

From their fun drinks to the delicious entrees to the comfortable outdoor seating, it's always a win. Aside from the aforementioned things, Lazy Dogs does something really right, and that's customer service. Tonight my girlfriend and I were served by Jennifer - she was awesome! I got the chicken pot pie for the first time, and she got the campfire pot roast, which is one of our collective favorites. Both were amazing. I drank the housemate ginger beer (nice ginger zing and super refreshing) and she got the Jamaican lemonade, which is hard not to choose every time we go. Their alcoholic drinks are good too, St Ruby is choice. Tonight we got dessert, the s'mores brownie topped with a housemate toasty marshmallow. So. Good. I was so full but this had to happen. Jennifer took that extra step and gave my girlfriend not only an extra take-home container of gravy, but a separate one of the sautéed spinach that topped her pot roast.

I've been there once before and was t crazy about the food but figured since they have such a variety on the menu I'd give it another shot.  As we were looking over the menu options it said that most entrees come with a ""sidekick"".  The list of sidekicks were nowhere to be found on the menu.  When the waitress came by my father asked her where to find the sidekick list and she said ""they're in my book"" and walked away to help another table.  Ok, that doesn't help.  So she comes back and just hands my dad her book so he can read the options himself.  My mother, now putting on her reading glasses, read from the list also.  Isn't it the waitresses job to be helpful and courteous to her table? My father then asked what a ""Japanese cucumber salad"" was. Her reply was ""a cucumber salad with a fancy word in front of it"".  There was no further explanation.  Then she went on to talk bad about the company and how she doesn't like working there.

1264249,2016-01-31,0,0_aeYE2-VbsZts_UpILgDw,"To quote my husband, this place is basically ""a more expensive Applebee's."" But with one big difference: It's dog friendly.

Although we did not have our dog with us, there were plenty of people with their pups on the patio. Looks like that would be a fun and novel dining experience. But, as we sat inside with the other dogless folks, I can only comment on the food, which was fine but nothing special.

I ordered lamb stroganoff with a wedge salad, because I make a mean lamb stroganoff and the spouse makes a killer wedge. I wanted to see how they did it here, and while it's always unfair to compare a restaurant's food with your own, I think they should have put ""Our take on ..."" in front of each of these menu items, because they were far from traditional. The wedge salad was lacking bacon, and instead of blue cheese dressing, there was a ranch-style dressing with blue cheese crumbles on top. The addition of tomatoes and onions was also unneeded and unnecessary. All in all, not a good start. The stroganoff was much better, although it was served on fettucine instead of egg noodles and there was a pronounced lack of sour cream. That said, the lamb was delicious, and I loved the mushrooms and peas (which I haven't used in my recipe, but maybe now I will!).

My husband had fish and chips, which is one of his standard orders. Their take on this dish was to mold the fish into burger-shaped patties and to give thin-cut fries instead of fat potato wedges. The fish was greasy, and the fries weren't very tasty. Another dud.

Service was a bit slow, but the place was packed so I can't fault our waitress. Although the menu items we selected weren't all that great, I would be willing to give Lazy Dog another try, maybe next time with pooch in tow!",55bAo20xQNIA2CfMKIDtPA,1,0,3,sRvaorpYb1OQOWE6L03D_A

This was a nice place to eat with friends and the NCAA Football National Championship was on that evening, so we could watch the game as well - lots of TVs.

I can't help but think the place is overpriced, though. You DO get large plates, but it's not really a place I'd go often.

The location is great and the restaurant was clean and decorated well. You can tell all the servers were properly trained because they were extremely friendly and knew the extensive menu very well. They had a great happy hour menu and have both an early and late night happy hour which is great.

I ordered the cucumber mint martini which was fantastic and on the happy hour menu. We also tried the inside out quesadilla which was phenomenal, with crispy cheese on the outside of the quesadilla, a concept I want to go home to try! It was also on the HH menu, so for only $4 or $5 bucks, everyone should order it at least once!

I ordered a personal black and bleu pizza from the happy hour menu and a side salad since the  pizza is only 6 inches. The pizza was great with the strong taste from the bleu cheese and a generous portion of bacon. My side salad was amazing as it could be. Most restaurants use cheap lettuce and ingrediants, but this one was very tastey,

My husband ordered thai noodles which was a generous portion of pad thai with chicken. My husband found a small eggshell in the dish, which showed they use fresh ingrediants and the manager came by immediately to handle the situation and gave us his meal for free. 

We also ordered the key lime cheesecake which was perfect to share and delicious at only $5.

The plus side is they allow dogs, the down side is you have to be outside, which is fair. My only complaint is sometimes it can get cold in the winter months when eating outside. They even have dog dishes consisting of hamburger or chicken with white or brown rice. And they bring out a bowl of water for the dog as well which is nice. Ok, enough about the dog food.

The food there is great, and there is a widddde variety to choose from. Whatever you're in the mood for, from pizza to thai noodles to chicken sandwiches to cheeseburgers, they got it. I personally love the bleu cheeseburger. I also tried the thai noodles with chicken which was good too. Considering it isn't an authentic thai place they did a nice job making it and the portion was huge.

The location is perfect at the Summerlin mall area. After I'm done eating at the lazy dog it is nice to walk over to other stores and sometimes the farmers market is out.

1438065,2017-10-30,0,0_aeYE2-VbsZts_UpILgDw,"Came here for the first time (officially) as a diner recently, right after the Breast Cancer Walk, that was held in front of Red Rock Casino. 

Had been to their sister restaurant previously with another friend once, to pick up food for her doggy. This is a unique restaurant as it is one of the few that allows dogs (outside patio only) with a small menu for dog's. Of course there are some rules to follow but hey, easy enough if you have them trained well. 

The restaurant opened at 0900AM on Sunday which was 2 hours earlier than it usually does on weekdays, and 1 hour earlier than it does on Saturday. 

There was a few parties from the same walk here already when we had arrived. We were a party of 12 so i thought we'd have some trouble in getting some seating arranged. They had asked us if we had a reservation, when i answered ""no"", the hostess had a mild disappointment/sad emotion but stated it would take 10 - 15 minutes for our table to be ready. That in itself was really surprising and we were happy. Indeed, we were seated in 10 - 15 minutes. Surprisingly, we weren't the largest party in the restaurant. 

We were greeted by our server (Gerardo) fairly quickly and had drinks served. One of our friend's had a yelp check in offer for free fries. 4 of us had checked in and did not see this offer. Not sure why? I have heard about some offers being random so i just left it at that. One of my friends had asked the waiter about this and he said he would ask his manager about it. A few minutes later, we had told us manager had allowed 2 more orders for us.

Cajun Fries - Crispy french fries with cajun seasoning and a side of chipotle ranch dipping sauce 

YUMMY ! When we had originally got that 1st plate, the fries were disappearing fast. I decided to move the fries back to the person who ordered it before it disappeared in front of us. These fries are DANGEROUSLY DELICIOUS ! (i dont say this much). When 2 more orders came, we went at it. Very well seasoned. Deliciously crispy and well made. That dipping sauce wasn't even needed ! Best cajun fries i've ever had ! 

Hair of the Dog Bloody Mary - Vodka, tomato juice, black pepper, fresh lime + horseradish, garnished with olives, pickled green beans + celery

This was the brunch cocktail i had picked. I haven't had a bloody mary in ages and thought it was worth the try at the cost of $5. Pretty good pricing. Granted it was smaller than what i've seen what other restaurants offer but it was still fairly decent sized. I tasted the vodka and tomato juice, and some lime (since i squeezed that wedge of lime into my drink). Black pepper, horseradish was indistinguishable. Celery was a bit weird XD Surprisingly the pickled green bean was tasty. I don't really like olives but i ate that anyway XD (asian habits of not wasting food). As for the drink itself, eh. Was ok. I think there are better versions. 

Was pretty indecisive with what i wanted to order. Not much of a breakfast/brunch fan typically so didn't really know what to order. Especially from the Brunch menu

Country Chicken + Biscuit - crispy fried chicken, housemade chicken sausage, two sunny side up eggs, housemade buttermilk biscuit, cajun gravy, spiced maple syrup

Aside from this one, i had my eyes on the housemade carnitas + tater tot hash. Some other friends ordered it and it looked really good. The country chicken and biscuit was ok. The biscuit was pretty yummy. The housemade chicken sausage was not that good. Less ""bite"" than i had expected from a sausage. The fried chicken was mildly dry and definitely wasnt crispy anymore. The gravy was good to mop up with the biscuit. Couldn't really tell the maple syrup was spiced or any different from a normal syrup. XD

My friend had ordered the pork fried rice. It includes smoked bacon, pork sausage, veggies + cabbage, topped with an egg omelette. The fried rice was very typical from an american establishment. Includes shredded carrots, and peas... Lol the rice was a bit undercooked and hard. The omelette is the weirdest part of all. Ok omelette on top of fried rice. Doesn't sound that weird right? But this omelette... was like... a dry quiche, without all the unique characteristics of a quiche and ingredients.. It seemed like it was thrown in a round pan and thrown into an oven for a long period of time... or even worse, microwaved. WORST ""OMELETTE"" EVER ! 

Price wise for the brunch items, was very good. Most items were under $10, which was quite cheaper than most things on their main menu. 

Best item we had was the fries definitely. Service was great as well. My water was always filled quickly. Very attentive server (Gerardo). Weird that he asked to make a review with him in it but hey, he did do a good job. So it was deserving. If anything, this helped me notice his name and be able to recall it in this review.

We told him it was fine and he insisted!  Now that is customer service and we will be back!  Gisselle, our waitress was also Very accommodating!!!

Atmosphere :
5 Stars I loved the open lodge , and tunes ambiance. 

Service :
5 Stars. Fast , and just enough personality shared with the server. 

Food...meh!
Sweet potato tater tots. Great dipping sauce. Rather hard and greasy for my taste. 

Martini. 4 Stars. Great unique flavor. 

Ribs: quite sweet. Quantity of meat on the bone-very very sparse. The side of fries had a fancy name ( umami) w.t.frick, They were mediocre Applebee's,Red Robin quality. not worth eating I expected more fir the price. 

Pork shank. Flavor great. Quantity of meat.....adequate, yet the surface of the pork was dry. I expected better for  the price. 
The pork rested on a side of spicy Kimchee flavored rice. Way too spicy and was a serious detractor to the pork. Not. Good match 
Pork shank is a more delicate flavor imho.
Polenta or cous cous , lightly, or not at all spiced would've been a better , and less costly food marriage. 
I walked out tasting kimchee flavor on my palate , not pork. 

I think it's a food sin to plate a main, with a side that is stronger. 

Two mains 
One appetizer 
Three drinks 
99.00 plus 20 tip. 

120.00 was way to much for what  we ate. 

It's an 80 dollar experience. Not 120.

Not planning on returning.

Came on a Saturday night around 7:00pm and were able to be seated immediately. It is a pretty big restaurant with a large patio area where people are able to eat with their dogs. There was a decent sized crowd for a Saturday night. The menu is comparable to Cheesecake Factory where they literally have a little bit of everything, so many options it can be overwhelming. We started with drinks - pineapple mojito and sangria sampler. The sangria samplers was ~$9 and came with three little mason jars of peach sangria, raspberry sangria and Im not sure what the other one was, it just tasted like iced red wine to me. My favorite was the raspberry for sure. I took a sip of the mojito and it was pretty good. For food we ordered a Spicy Thai chicken salad, really good (but I have had it before) and a turkey burger. The fries seemed as if they were cooked earlier this afternoon, mushy and cold. Service was good after we had to wait 7 minutes to have our drink orders taken our server was on top of it from then out. The bill was around $50 which isn't too bad.

First off I've only been here a couple times and within those times left a good enough mark on me to not want to go back or let it be my last option. So first time I went there was with my girlfriend and our dog. It took forever to get a glass of water and it took forever to order after the water. BUT WAIT.. No literally wait, because after the order was more waiting. I got so fed up that I was becoming uninterested with my food but it came. I tried their chipotle chicken quesadilla which I think is really overpriced which I can get better ones at Denny's for cheaper. And I got a side of French fries which I never got because they forgot and I wasn't about to wait longer because getting the check felt a lifetime. At least they didn't charge me for it. Second time I came with another couple plus my girlfriend and out dog again. Everyone got chicken Alfredo and one side of fries and I got the black and bleu pizza and Cajun fries. Yes I got my fries this time but the one guy who got the one side of regular fries didn't because they forgot. Saw that one coming. We got our table at 8. We wanted to eat and go get ice cream after but after all the waiting we didn't finish until 11. Trust me it was the same situation as my first visit. It was almost parallel to each other. BUT the reason and the only reason it barely made the third star is because their black and bleu pizza is absolutely amazing. I took it home and ate the leftovers the next day and it still tasted amazing. I don't know though if I would want to wait that long for a pizza. I guess it's nice also that I can bring my dog, but I'm better off ordering Dominos or Pizza Hut and relaxing with my girlfriend and dog at home.",jDcEgczm7r2zlzV1keoW2g,1,0,3,bmFa_THOz2pPCDAvZNePvg

Another waitress stopped by and told our waiter to come over. He finally came over and took our burgers back. About 15 minutes later, we got new burgers but this time they were so well done they were dark brown all through. Again, the waiter never came by to ask how everything was. They were completely tasteless and dry. Never did see the waiter again. We finally asked a different waiter to get us our check, which he did.

1745835,2017-09-30,0,0_aeYE2-VbsZts_UpILgDw,"I normally would rate Lazy Dog 5-STAR, up until an incident today.

We frequent your establishment located in Downtown Summerlin, Las Vegas on a regular basis, dining at least four to five times a month with friends and family, and have always been pleased with the food and service.   We raved about your restaurant and your food to many of our neighbors and community associations.

However, I must relay to you an incident that occurred today, September 30, 2017.   It had us questioning whether or not we want to subject ourselves to the rude and obnoxious behavior we encountered today from one of your employee. The employee in question is the hostess, Brenda.

We always arrive early when your restaurant open in the morning on weekend, so we get a table in one of the far corners of restaurant. The reason being we have a large-senior-service dog and like to isolate him so no other patrons are bothered by his presence.

Today, being the first party to arrive, we politely requested to be seated in one of the far corner table.  We were rudely told by Brenda that those section were closed and we had to sit in the middle of the restaurant.  After seating us she snidely said, ""Do you have a leash for that dog!""

Two minutes later another couple arrived, and the same Brenda who informed us that the corner section was closed to us, seated the couple at the table we had requested minutes earlier. 

To make matters worse the table that Brenda assigned us, was in direct sunlight, with no shade, and since my wife is sensitive to sunlight she was extremely uncomfortable.  To top it off, Brenda processes to squeeze two parties of families with children, each on both sides of us, virtually boxing us in, and making our dog anxious and apprehensive.

Needless to say this was quite an unpleasant experience that resulted in our loss of appetite and a half-eaten meal.

My wife took our dog and walked out of the patio to go back to our vehicle.  It left her aggravated and with upset stomach.  She went to speak to the Supervisor/Manager, Christy.  My wife pointed out and informed the entire incident to Christy, and the extremely uncomfortable surroundings, as well as the rudeness and snotty attitude of the hostess named Brenda.  

Once again, we are regular-satisfied patrons of Lazy Dog Restaurant, but this incident today is unusually disturbing, upsetting and extremely disappointing.

We hope to see that this incident does not happen again.  When a customer is politely and respectfully requesting a particular seat, the least for a ""representative"" or hostess of an establishment should do is respond back politely and respectfully, no matter the accommodation.",BbVQi9aAN26vFKtHD9uRqA,1,0,2,qgLe0P8dsbYV8IAkZWxkig

Our table shared Cajun Fries and a Brick Oven Spinach & Sundried Tomato Cheese Dip for starters. The dip was too salty for me. The fries were okay. 

I chose to share a chicken pot pie and a Tex-Mex salad with my friend since we wanted both things. The chicken pot pie was huge, but it only had a crust on top. It was basically the easier way to make a pot pie. The pot pie also had huge chunks of chicken which I didn't enjoy because that's basically all you would eat in one bite. The Tex-Mex salad was good and very big. Next time I would probably do without the black beans since I'm not a fan of them. The dressing was a nice accompaniment too.

Chicken was good but it's more like chicken fried steak. I was expecting traditional fried chicken. Still it was a delicious meal so not a big deal, though I'm sure future patrons who are pickier will point that out.

THE STAFF:  We got there and the hostess was great. Really friendly and helpful. She even made sure to let us know in this busy night that the seating at the bar area was first come first served in case we didn't want to wait.  The person who delivered our food was also super nice. Unfortunately, there was a chatty waitress who would not stop talking with us. She kept telling long stories to the point of things getting awkward. Now don't get me wrong, I don't mind the quick joke or chat with the wait staff, but when my girlfriend and I are both taking bites out of our burgers, it's time to hit the road. Very weird staring at you while chewing.  Keep the anecdotes under 2 minutes, please.

There was also a hostess who wasn't so friendly.  Just an attitude that really made you feel like she didn't care at all. It also seemed awkward for nobody to say ""bye"", or ""come again"", or ""thanks for choosing Lazy Dog"" when there were like 7 employees that you had to walk by to leave. 

THE FOOD:  Food was really good. Not 5-star good, but I'd say a four. I was a bit upset that they were out of 9 of like 25 draft beers.  Not sure why that was the case.  

We had the loaded potato hush puppies. Really good. I'd say a 4 of 5. Mac n cheese. 5 of 5. Definitely good.  My blue cheese burger was solid. 4 of 5. Girlfriends pasta was, I thought, 3 of 5. But I'm also picky about pasta.

The atmosphere and decor is nice. The bartender, Brandon, was a pro. I'd say go there for a drink for sure. Go sit down if you want super salty TGI Friday's type food. But don't do pick up/take out.

But...

I've ordered food for 'pick up' there twice. The first time I felt like the service was just ok. The staff seemed kind of indifferent about helping me, and they were slow. The food took a long time, too - over 20 min the first time. 

The second time was MUCH worse - almost 40 min to get my food and 10 minutes before that to wait for the only person who can take an order for pick up. Even though there were 4 other people roaming around the hostess area, only one can take your order and they would not let me just order it at the bar, which was 100% empty. 

The worst thing is not the wait - that is bad, but, you know, sometimes things go wrong. The worst thing was that when I finally had to go ask the (manager?) about my order and tell her it was over 35 minutes since I ordered it, she seemed annoyed by me. She did not apologize, or seem concerned at all. She didn't ask if there was anything she could do - could she offer me a coupon for 10% off next time? Nothing. 

When I asked her why it took almost 40 min when I was told it would ""for sure be under 20 minutes"" she said that there were a couple of large take out orders that cam in right before mine. The restaurant, in general, was not busy at all. And, let's be honest. If they took 40 min to serve guests sitting at tables, no one would ever come back. So I guess it is just the take out side that is the problem. Either way, the food is not good enough to make me go back despite this kind of poor service.",ynb_ap1tEiswb8LlGMOW-Q,1,0,2,K0teJ8JQgQrvQhC2qjmoqw

This is the best restaurant of with wait service tableside that allows dogs. We consistently get great service and are never disappointed with the food quality.

When you're seated, alongside the people menus they also include a dog menu. you can choose from a hamburger patty or grilled chicken over brown or white rice. Each dog gets their own complimentary bowl of water. We have ordered both the hamburger patty and grilled chicken with brown rice. Buddy the dog seems to like both alot as he can finish his food here in 60 seconds flat. 

As for the people food...  They redesigned their menu a few months ago, and since then the quality of the food has been excellent. It seems they prep most of their recipes from scratch at the location and you can tell the difference with the freshness of the vegetables and subtle tastes like garlic and citrus zest.

As a vegetarian, I order the Tofu Coconut Curry bowl.  It is REALLY good.  The tofu is breaded and cooked perfectly. Flavors are excellent. And all for 9.75, you can't go wrong for what you get.  I highly recommend it.

I have a confession. I am a cat person! I love dogs, too. I just don't own one. YET. I kind of avoided this place at first because I thought it would be packed with canines and their owners, but other than a bunch of dog-theme décor (check out the fire hydrant draft beer spouts!), I didn't see much of the furry critters.*

Menu is a smorgasbord of apps, Asian dishes, pizzas, classic American dishes, and some soups, salads, and sandwiches too. In other words, you may have a hard time deciding. The VEGGIE LAVASH SANDWICH is indulgent but healthy (650 calories but packed with fresh veggies). I especially liked the thick-cut Gouda and sundried tomato hummus! Upgraded side of Cajun fries with spicy ranch dipping sauce is worth the $1 surcharge, even if they invalidate your healthy entrée decision.  The CHICKEN TORTILLA SOUP is hearty, and the RED POMEGRANATE SANGRIA ($4/HH) is also fair, but not must-get dishes.

I found myself at their other location in Town Square recently, and their food seemed way better. My party there REALLY enjoyed their food.

The food was okay, but there are other restaurants in downtown summerlin that have far superior cuisine (crave, CPK, public school, etc).  When I pre-bussed the table by stacking empty plates, the manager asked me if I'd like him to take the dishes out of my way.

First, this place is just so fun because I can bring my big, black lab along with me to dinner, which is always a treat. Most places (even if they are 'dog friendly') really only cater to small dogs. This makes my 100 lb hard to bring along. This place does not shy away though! They have a lovely outdoor seating area that is very spacious. You never feel cramped or uncomfortable outside as they have shades/fans/heaters for all types of weather. To top it off they even have a small 'doggy' menu for your fur-baby to eat from. They automatically provide water for your dog as well, you don't even need to ask it just comes out with your own drinks. 

Speaking of menus, the people menu is very large and offers a ton of variety. This is always great because we like to come here frequently, and being able to try plenty of new dishes is always a huge plus. To add to this, the food is just delicious. I've had everything from pasta and salads, to burgers and pot pies. Each item has been wonderfully delicious. They do offer a full bar as well and have many fun house cocktails to choose from.

This review will be based on the last 2 or 3 times we've been there (always in the patio, always with a toddler and our pup) Service in the patio has gone WAY down... I'm not sure if it's management's assignment of servers in that area or what, but something bad is happening and patio guests and their dogs are being neglected a little.

The most recent time we were there we sat for a solid 15-20 minutes waiting to be greeted and for our drink order to be taken.

You're the hostess, shouldn't you know who is supposed to be serving us?? So eventually a female server came to our table and said she wasn't our server, but she could take our order. Oh cool!!

The iced teas came about 10 minutes later, but no dog water.  As a dog-themed restaurant that prides itself in being dog-friendly, it was kind of like pulling teeth to get water for our dog... Anyway, eventually after asking a few more times, we got some water for the dog and ordered our food. Food came out wrong, but was fixed quickly and tasted good.  

We also noticed the table next to us irritated about getting their food for their dog waaaaaay after they got their meals.  They ended up just getting it to go because they were done with their meals by the time the dog's food came.

I called in advance to make a reservation and was told that they take reservations 24 hours in advance, for parties of 7 or more. The person on the phone told me they were always busy and there is always a wait.  I did not love the response, but our friends really wanted to bring their dogs so we happily went.

Our group was told it was about a 20 minute wait... We sat and waited patiently on the patio with our party of 4 people and 3 doggies.  No offer of water or a beverage while we waited, for humans or doggies

At 45 minutes we were told we were 2nd on the list.  At one hour we were still number 2 on the list. We were hungry and wanting to know how much longer it would likely be.  We were told some parties had been at the tables on the patio for Over 4 Hours and they had No Idea when we would get a table:( 

We discussed the situation and no one wanted to wait on the stone benches any longer... 

We left and walked next door to another restaurant's patio, sat down immediately and enjoyed a Fabulous meal on the neighbor restaurant's patio.  They welcomed us and our dogs.  See Spot Run next door",Dkb-TJFNSWl4PYR8wEcWcw,9,6,2,XD-pBPCBw24mBWnJNH1c4w

Went in for a quick lunch on a weekday and came away disappointed.

Just FYI -  this joint is highly popular with the Summerlin crowd. 

I ordered the chicken pesto salad which came with a little scoop of sun dried tomato hummus and two miniscule slices of flathead. The grilled chicken had that rubbery texture and was rather pale color with some grill marks on it. It definitely was not tasty. Worse yet was the super odd pesto it was slathered in. The hummus was completely bland. To be honest,  I prefer the Sabra's (yeah! the listeria laced hummus brand) over the the hummus I tried here.  The marinated tomatoes were unpleasantly sour and mealy while the portion of greens was rather small. Meh,  definitely had better.

The hubs ordered the fish tacos which sucked. He only got two tacos which featured dry bland mahi mahi. The pico de gallo was tasteless. It was served with rice and beans.  The hubs thought the beans tasted straight out from a can. He'd rather hit Rubio's. 

Service was solid and quick. We were tempted to send stuff back but we were in a rush and didn't want to bother. Instead we went home so I could wash the horrible aftertaste of the pesto from my mouth. 

It's hard to justify coming back here when the food isn't even good. Portion sizes for the price are also not that great but then again,  do you really want more of a bad thing? Avoid this joint like the plague (2 starred review)",h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q,3,2,2,SWaUaRlyGkoOMQwi1eQtgQ

The bun was toasted perfectly and the patty was seasoned in such a way that I didn't miss the beef at all. The strawberry citrus soda is light and refreshing. Brunch time here is busy and noisy, so anticipate that. 

On a more recent visit, I ordered the carbonara. The menu says there is supposed to be a poached egg on it, but I opted to have it without. The pasta was good but I think the cook was pretty heavy-handed with the salt. The Chardonnay cream sauce was nearly drowned out by the saltiness.

We ordered the Black and blue burger which came with both blue cheese crumbles and dressing, the Bison burger which came with havarti cheese, and the Chicken Dinner. For drinks we got the House Beer Sampler and the Seasonal Peaches + Moonshine. The seasonal libation was quite fresh, though a tad strong but very tasty. I'd say that Hefeweizen is by far probably the best Hefe I've ever tasted--really smooth! Jaime mentioned that all their House beer comes from Golden Road brewery in California. I can't believe it, but we were actually able to save a little bit of room for dessert (which was on the house thanks to Jaimie) and decided on the Housmade Butter Cake which was beautifully topped with minted strawberry compote and vanilla bean ice cream--gorgeous and delectable! Similar to strawberry short cake which is one of my favorites :)

The only two things that would have made the experience a little better was if maybe they'd lower the music a tad because I felt like I had to shout across the table. The other thing was that the silverware and some of the glasses weren't the cleanest. Other than that, I'd like to come back here very soon!",hqTVG-jmbYrw1pFZJa7y7g,2,2,5,rU1b0wMsEviVVhoVZX9M1g

Unfortunately, the last few times we stopped in for dinner we had issues being seated.  We also keep getting the same waiter who clearly doesn't stay focused on waiting tables.

Regarding patio seating - when we first started going here the entire outer patio was reserved for people with dogs, allowing you to tie your dog to their railing.  Then they changed and only allowed dogs on the far end of the patio, including in the middle of the patio.

This time, we were told that there are only a small number of dog friendly tables on the patio and they they are all near the entrance.  This means that our dogs are distracted by the people waiting for a table, children running around outside and other dogs waiting with their people.  Thankfully our dogs are well behaved, but multiple children ran up to our dogs and stuck their hands through the railing to pet them.

When we inquired as to why the dog seating had changed, we were told that too many people were complaining about dogs on the patio and they reduced the number of dog tables in order to accommodate the other guests.

This restaurant is called Lazy Dog, they offer a dog menu and there are multiple signs indicating that there will be dogs at the restaurant.  If you are offended by dogs or allergic to dogs, perhaps you should either eat somewhere else or eat inside where there are no dogs.

Despite really liking this place, I'm not sure if I'll be back.  There has to be other dog friendly dining options in Las Vegas.",5eYM5rscKlAarV_v8DUeWQ,2,0,3,g37ZUTkD3gzHz6O5wsUzHA

Lunch was decent, I had the shrimp taco special while he had the blackened chicken bowl. The blackened chicken bowl was HUGE, but had a ton of mix-ins that made it really great. The chicken also had good flavor. 

My shrimp tacos were pretty good, but came with a lot of plain slaw that could have used some dressing. They also came with a cup and a half of plain white rice. Next time I'd ask if they could swap it for Spanish rice. The blackened chicken bowl was the winner of the two.

For dinner I had the pot roast while boyfriend had the portobello burger. Hands down, the pot roast was the best I've ever had! It's super tender, comes with spinach, and garlic mashed potatoes. So good!

We also split the Lazy Dog flight to try their beers, all of which were good.

People that had brought bags were just leaving them in the planters as opposed to bringing it into restaurant.
Once inside the only place for your dog was to tie it to your chair. Not cool at all as other dogs coming in were too close.
Waitress did bring a small bowl of water to table for dog which was nice.

It took an eclectic group in search of an outdoor patio to bring me back a few years later for a fun evening around the fire pit. Then as fate would have it my love and I found our way back again at the request of our oldest daughter less than a week later. I wouldn't argue with those that shell out four stars for Lazy Dog. They do a pretty good job with the price-point they are working with. In fact the food may be a little better than that of your typical Bar & Grill, but after sampling nine different items this week, I didn't come across a reason I need to rush back Lazy Dog. 

The most recent visit led us to the patio for an early dinner. The weather was magnificent this evening and the bustling patio was entirely full by the time we left. We might have been the only table free of a canine at our feet. Needless to say, we were serenaded by the squawks and barks of many a four footed friend throughout our time there. Why is it that the smallest dogs need to yap the most? Alas, I digress. Here in lies THE reason to go to Lazy Dog: they are certainly one of the most dog-friendly establishments around. That is, here in lies the reason to go, if you have a dog, the weather is great, and you don't mind the obvious accommodations that come along with a patio of dogs. So...I also wouldn't argue with those that would offer up two stars on atmosphere alone. 

I enjoyed the Fish Tacos and Wok-Fired Calamari the most, but also had some love for the Caramelized Brussels Sprouts. The Grilled Garlic Flatbread & Marinara, Seared Ahi Salad, Sweet & Spicy Shrimp Bowl, and the Lentil Soup were all fine, as were the Seasonal Honey Thyme Old Fashioned and Asian Pear Cocktails...I might even order these A-OK items again if I was here.

The dog-friendly patio even comes complete with a dog menu of three dishes for you pooch to enjoy while you eat your food.",A5A34ixb-yy6nwL42iZsnw,27,21,3,5UGS7-4svN0TVzvV2UUSTg

These items were not only favorites of mine but they were top sellers!!! Honestly, it was really STUPID to take these popular items off the menu.

I like that their menu is so large, I feel like there is something here for everyone if you bring a big group of people with varied tastes. There's even a low calorie section, which is nice for people who are watching what they eat. Also, you can find nutritional information via their website.

2692061,2016-04-15,5,0_aeYE2-VbsZts_UpILgDw,"This is a fun place to have lunch/dinner. There's a lot of these located in So Cal...particularly in the OC area. Haven't been to a Lazy Dog since 2011 I think. Menu is very extensive, they got everything to fit your current food cravings. From burgers, steak, chicken, fish, sandwiches, Asian inspired wok entrees and your grand salads. I would group them with Yard House and BJs. Prices are about the same too. 

I ordered the Bahama Chicken-grilled chicken breast, grilled and topped with sweet sauce, served with brown rice, cilantro black beans, pickled cucumbers and topped with sesame seeds and cilantro. 
Sounds like a pretty healthy dish. Erm, at least I would hope so. I portion controlled that so I wouldn't be packing on the calories plus I have leftovers the next day.

My friends both thought their entrée choices were alright. Wasn't ""freakin delicious!"" but it wasn't ""disgusting"" either. They ordered a black n bleu burger with fries and an Asian inspired sweet and sour chicken bowl.

Food was a solid B+ but the service was terrible. Our waitress wasn't too attentive...seemed like she forgot about us for a second. We didn't care too much because my friends and I had a lot of catching up to do....but if you're pressed on time. Be aware of that. We came here for dinner on a Thursday night.

2716973,2015-10-04,0,0_aeYE2-VbsZts_UpILgDw,"After just one visit, I love this place.  We'd been hearing the buzz about Lazy Dog's for a while and as usual, seemed to resist the urge to just fly over there.  Then finally, the schedule was open and we dove in.  Wow!

It was an expectedly busy evening and we didn't make reservations, but the wait wasn't bad.  They told us ~40 minutes and that's what it was.  With two adults and a child in our party, we figured we'd get to test the service, a good assortment of the food and get a little feedback from our son in addition to what we thought about it.  When you walk in, the place is decorated with a kind of western, domestic pet, industrial flair.  Go and see.  Somehow it works.  There are two cool industrial sculptures when you enter:  a horse's head and a dog.  Very cool.  We opted for first available seating which landed us on the patio, and a great time was underway.

Right up front, the place is dog friendly, as you might or might not suspect from the name.  Yes, you can bring your four-legged buddy.  The menu has a great selection for the humans, and several nice choices for your critter companion as well.  The pup will also get a bowl of water.  We weren't sure if there would be the calm we saw in Germany when we lived there (and it was common to see dogs at restaurants), or pet pandemonium.  Without exception, all the critters in attendance were well-behaved and under their owner's control.  Nice.

Since we sat on the patio, we had several dogs around us.  After ordering and waiting for our food, my son politely asked if he could pet a couple of pups near us and with the owner's permission, he had some new friends to keep him occupied while we chatted with the owners and waited for our food.  The menu is not too big but full of a real diversity of items, with something for just about anyone.  They also had a kid's menu for our little guy.  

Here's what we ate:  we ordered the Wok Fired Calamari and the Hatch Chili & Bacon Mac n' Cheese (off the small plate menu) for appetizers.  The calamari was made from nice sized strips (rather than the traditional small rings) served over rice and cooked with mild green and red peppers.  The Mac n' Cheese was some of the best I've had, with the chili's giving it just the slightest bite.  Perfect balance with the bacon and cheese, none of which overwhelmed the pasta.  For our main courses, my wife had the Pot Roast Beef Dip and I ordered the Chicken Poblano.  Both were fantastic.  The pot roast variation on the traditional French Dip resulted in my wife declaring this may be her favorite French Dip sandwich in the Valley.  The Chicken Poblano was perfect, with the sauce just perfectly the right spice and heaviness that it complemented and didn't overwhelm the chicken.  We were stuffed and while we were relaxing before paying our bill, we saw the Lamb Shank and Campfire Pot Roast delivered to a nearby table, somehow making use hungry again. They both looked and smelled fantastic.  I'm definitely going to try the Lamb next time we're there.

As the weather cools, don't forget there's a large fire pit in the middle of the outdoor seating.  Obviously surrounded by the tables on the patio, it's also designed to allow guests to use the side of the pit as their table, so if you're wanting a seat up close and near the warming flames, be sure to ask.

Located on the north end of Downtown Summerlin, there's ample parking all around the restaurant.  If you really crave keeping your car in the shade, it's not far to the nearest parking garage.  Very convenient!  Definitely give Lazy Dog's a try.",djb61X-vkg5PF16qM_wI5Q,3,1,5,-G-hS_YGLyJhYx5F-tQRbg

Our experience here was great.  The food was delicious and the service was top notch.  Lazy Dog was the perfect place to sit down for dinner and take a break from all the shopping we did around downtown Summerlin.   

Lazy Dog has a wide range of food that was offered on their menus.  Pastas, meats, wok-fried foods, Hawaiian style ribs,  ahi tuna entrees, burgers, seafood, brunch foods, and so much more.  If you're trying to feed a group of diverse tastes, you will have no problem finding the perfect something for everyone.

My pot roast over mashed potatoes with sautèed spinach was amazingly good.  The meat was so tender and flavorful and the hearty gravy complimented it and the mashed potatoes very well.  There was so much in this one dish that I had to ask for a box to take home.  

My wife had the sundried tomato pesto pasta with a hefty portion of sliced chicken breast.  The flavors of their walnut-pesto cream sauce mixed with the tossed mushrooms, onions, and broccoli make this another winning entree.  

Onto their desserts: 

1) Butter Cake-  ""Don't resuscitate me.  I've died and gone to heaven.""  Home-made butter cake topped with strawberry compote and a scoop of vanilla ice cream surrounded by a sweet balsamic reduction.  This simple dessert filled me with such warmth and joy with each bite.  The butter cake was so delicious that I can't even type without pausing to stop myself from drooling.  I left the restaurant thinking and dreaming about my next time having this.  (Soon!  Townsquare location incoming!)  

2) Kid's meal ""Create your own Sundae""-  This was a very fun take on a sundae.  A large bowl of ice cream was accompanied by side dishes filled with sprinkles, nuts, chocolate, and caramel.  My daughter was able to decorate her ice cream as she pleased.  She loved it.  My only question is how was this less than $3 ?!?  It was MASSIVE!  Truly, any kid's sweet dream come true. 

I can't wait for their second location in Town Square to open up as it's much closer to me than their Summerlin Location.   Until then,  I will gladly drive out of my way again for such a great meal.",Mho2GibREwsPesKEyQbt8w,8,4,5,6JylakhNdjSLusrV2kce3A

We were starving and started out with Passion Tea, Hummus Trio and Corn Wheels as appetizers.  Another waiter brought us homemade chips as a ""welcome"" gift.

  (We also had our main meal:  Curry Tofu Bowl and Blue Cheese Burger, on hold in case we could eat more)....

 We ended up cancelling the meals as we were stuffed with the three appetizers.  Amanda could have not been more delightful and had held the order back as per our ""eyes being bigger than our stomachs""!!!

So we decided to try a dessert, Banana Pudding and a Butter Cake ....in the end, she wanted to buy the buttercake for us...it was the best darn cake I ever ate...

When we arrived there was no one at the hostess stand and waited about 3 to 5 minutes for hostess to show up. After we were seated it took at least another 5 minutes for the server to acknowledge our presence. Based on the timing so-far we immediately ordered the entrees with our wine and cocktails. The entrees arrived cold, but the server never checked back to ask if everything was satisfactory. When she arrived with the check I informed her that the food was luke warm/cold. She said she would inform the kitchen.

It was a fun place to hang out and the atmosphere I give an 8 out of 10. The patio was nice and you can bring your dogs but wayyyy to hot in this heat during the summer. It has a nice fire pit in the center so sitting on the patio come fall/winter seems more ideal. The house sangria was terrible. I got the sampler because I wasn't sure which I would like and I'm glad I did. The peach tasted more like vodka and rubbing alcohol and the other two tasted like a cross between a jolly rancher and cough syrup, not good. I did however get an extra dry extra dirty martini and it was fabulous! The happy hour menu was pretty delicious and had quite a number of options. We got the nachos, chicken tenders, and Cajun fries. The nachos were great! Perfect amount of cheese, avocado, salsa, etc for every chip. No chip was uncovered! The chicken tenders were basic tenders nice size and very moist. The Cajun fries were my favorite yum yum not too spicy but just enough flavor! If you looking for a laid back spot with a good happy hour this is the place to go; avoid the patio in summer and don't get the sangria you will regret it!",VQriMYuWKY4RETg_iGreww,0,0,3,AyXlN3zLcRjb999q3K_EKQ

Served on a bed of rice (we opted for brown), and what appears to be prepared stir-fry style, the rings were cut into strips and breaded and tossed with sweet and sour style sauce.  Very light and a nice departure from the way calamari is typically served.  For lunch, I had the Tomatillo Chicken Enchilada off of the 650 calorie and under menu and it was honestly one of the best dishes I've had in a long while.  It was full of flavor, bright with lime undertones in the tomatilla sauce but what really kicked it up was the sriracha crema that was drizzled on top of the enchilada.  My hubby had the shrimp tacos, and although he said they were good, he ended up finishing off my food (for 650 calories, there was A LOT of food on that plate).  He said he'd definitely get it next time we go there.  Loved the atmosphere and feel of the place, it was open yet warm feeling and not overly loud.

The patio is comfortable with a fire pit in the middle and several tables for dining. Dog diners are only allowed on the patio so if you prefer to be away from the 4 legged lovers, you have the option to eat inside.
The menu is basic, offering sandwiches, burgers and chicken/beef entrees. The also offer weekend brunch until 2pm. For the pups the servers bring out water and you have the option to purchase chicken and rice, hamburger and rice or a bowl of rice for their lunch. I always order the turkey and havarti sandwich on herb focaccia bread for myself. They have other great options but I just love this sandwich. 
The patio fills up fast on weekends so expect a small wait. It's nice to know I have somewhere to take my boys after the park for a nice lunch before work. Not all dogs get along but for the most part it's peaceful. I do appreciate the ""dog rules"" of no barking, biting or begging and they are not allowed to sit at the table or eat off human plates.

The chicken wings and cajun fries are the kind you find at any bar.

I went there close to midnight and there was one server working the entire time. There were about 7 tables and it's just too much to ask for one server to handle! Needless to say it took forever to put in our order and to get the check. Can't blame the server but management should really have more than one person working??

All in all, it's a decent place but it's a very tough sell considering all the other food choices you can pick from around the area.

It was a beautiful, sunny day in Vegas, when we opted to grab a table outside on the patio...and as you may already know, if you decide to sit outside, then you should be entirely ready to be serenaded by dogs in every possible note.  

I have so far had the following items:
Fish Tacos
Wok-Fired Calamari
Grilled Garlic Flatbread & Marinara
Caramelized Brussels Sprouts
Seared Ahi Salad
Sweet & Spicy Shrimp Bowl
Lentil Soup
Seasonal Honey Thyme Old Fashioned with buffalo trace bourbon
Asian Pear with grey goose pear vodka


Most of the food items I have had were delicious and were good portion sizes. Service has been prompt and professional, and they were willing to accommodate some simple requests, and even suggested another modification to help ensure that it would come out the way we would like. 

Lazy Dog Restaurant & Bar is the perfect choice to bring your dog out, or hang out with a big group of friends on the patio. They also have seats around the fire pit, so if you are a little chilly at night, this is still a good choice.

2999508,2015-07-31,0,0_aeYE2-VbsZts_UpILgDw,"Quick Look: Brand new, large restaurant structure in Downtown Summerlin. Unfortunately, the nice new build out could not make up for the bland and tasteless food. 

In Depth Review: I know it's a corporate ""chain"" restaurant, but I had driven by a busy Lazy Dog several times and thought it must be good, just look at all those people. Tried it on Wednesday, July 29th at 7pm. The restaurant was packed out and bananas. People seem to love that chain restaurant food here. The hostess sat us in a small two person booth in the back near the kitchen and a fireplace. Was not the best seat as a serving station was directly behind me, and I had servers chatting away and pounding on a point of sale system over my shoulder. 

Our server was attentive and very friendly. We placed our drink and appetizer order. I told her we would wait to place our dinner entree order as we did not want to be rushed out. She seemed confused by this. Glad we made this decision as the kitchen was cranking food out at a super fast pace and timing was off. Our drinks arrived, and then our brick oven spinach and sun dried tomato cheese dip was brought out. About 5 minutes after we ordered it. It was in a baking dish and it was a boiling hot liquid. Did not look like any cheese dip I have ever seen or had before. Had the consistency of water. Was so hot we had to stir it for another 10 minutes before we could eat it. Sadly, it missed the mark and was bland. Could not taste the sun dried tomatoes, or the cheese flavor at all. 

For our entree we ordered the new fennel sausage, goat cheese and mushroom pizza. We also each ordered a Caesar salad. The salads came out and were a generous size. Within 2 minutes of our salads arriving they brought out our pizza. The table was a small two person size, so we were now sitting there all crowded and trying not to make a wrong move and knock something off the table by mistake. Timing was off big time, would have been nice to enjoy our salads prior to bringing out the entree. Our server apologized and blamed it on the kitchen. The pizza did not come with a spatula (pizza server). They said they did not have them to offer. Never experienced this at a place that offers a entire section of pizzas. Buy some dang spatulas (pizza servers) and offer them to your guests. We had to rip the slices by hand. The cheese and toppings that had not been firmly cut through in the kitchen slid off a few slices, this was annoying. The pizza looked great, but again it fell short and tasted bland. The dough was fluffy and the crust was very chewy. Not the typical brink oven taste we expected. It wasn't a horrible pizza, it was just not memorable. They give you a Styrofoam container to take the slices home that you do not eat. Most places that offer pizzas (think BJ's) will give a small pizza box to put slices in. So we had to stack and bend them to get them to fit properly. We would pass on desert as we were not feeling it at this point and just wanted to go home.  

In Summary: The drinks were good. The beer was cold. The service was attentive and friendly. Sadly the kitchen and the food failed to deliver. The entire experience was not that memorable. If I want to go to a chain restaurant with a similar festive atmosphere, I will take my business to the consistent and tasty Yard House up the street. Besides being able to sit on the patio with your dog, I guess I am failing to see what the big attraction is at Lazy Dog?",yuoaisepxm6QaBKiBxz6AA,0,0,2,mKB0qnIb31OCLOUqzTDAiQ

They asked if it was our first visit and we let them know that it was. They walked us through the menu, specials, and drinks, and we decided to do a full meal experience.

Starting with complimentary cheese Flatbread and an order of wings, we were really happy. With an order of beer samplers,the wings were hot out of the fryer and crispy. We downed wings with 6 samples of beers and that made the start of our weekend a good one.  All 3 sauces the wings came with are delicious but we really didn't need it.

My husband ordered chicken, wok fried, teriyaki style, and I grabbed their classic cheeseburger. Both dishes were fresh and tasty. I loved every bite of both! Their teriyaki chicken is crispy and well balanced of sweet and salty. The burger was well seasoned and juicy. A great dinner. 

To come full circle, we grabbed the butter cake. I will dream of that buttery goodness until our next visit. We ordered the balsamic reduction on the side to keep the cake pristine in flavor and we're so glad we did. I'd order it again as my only meal. Sweet, creamy with crunchy edges...it was addictive.

We choose to sit at the bar to avoid the wait and sat immediately.  The bartop itself was pretty dirty but the real issue was the drink lists and menus: they were sticky and had crumbs on them.  We ordered 4 items, all described below.

Edamame- 3/5
Great flavors but they were really the smallest I have ever seen and many of the pods were empty.

Bacon egg mac and cheese 2/5
The flavors were ok but it was super small for $7.  It also was just very underwhelming and did not have much bacon or egg.

Havarti Turkey sandwich 1/5
Sandwich was dry, the bread was burnt and the fries had no seasoning.

Pork egg fried rice 3/5
The rice tasted ok but there wasn't much pork in it.

On the way out my friend and I used the restroom and it was a pretty unpleasant experience.  There was little to no toilet paper, no hand soap and an overflowing trashcan.",DCKvIfwBPxTUzb9Y1PGXCQ,1,0,2,G6XEmbMSXKK4lK5T8kkqlA

     It happened to be durning happy hour and there were a lot of really good items on the menu. For drinks, we settled on the dark horse Cabernet (great value on happy hour $4) and a pitcher of sangria ($15). Our friends ordered shots of Jameson. We requested our food be prepared vegan. We ordered the edamame, stir fry tofu and veggies, hummus trio, and Caramelized Brussell sprouts. Our friends ordered the ahi poke and chicken lettuce wraps. I received my drink pretty promptly. However, the shots and the sangria... Took over 15 min to come out. They hit the table with the edamame. The edamame... Now I love salty food... But this... It wasn't edible... Overly salted.  We actually sent it back:(. 

     The manager came out and let us know that The tofu is bathed in egg, but the Brussel sprouts could definitely be done with no butter and made vegan yay!!! We wound up canceling the stir fry and getting the veggie lavash with no cheese. Highly recommend. As the food was coming out, we noticed we were missing a few items and just thought it was taking a while. Well... A while turned into the end of our meal. We couldn't tell anyone because no one came back to check on the table. The server, although very sweet, seemed a little overwhelmed. There was an incident with an ambulance and a diner right next to us. Perhaps that threw him off his game a little bit. By the time we were able to tell him about the food, we were pretty much ready to go. Apparently the manager never communicated to him that the sprouts could be prepared vegan, so the order was never inputted and the hummus... I'm not sure exactly what happened to it. Not entirely his fault by any means. 

    Our experience here was unfortunately underwhelming. I'll probably be back for happy hour in the future... After they get it together a little more.",p9942XebvxZ9ubHm4SXmMQ,7,4,2,NNdwxfllWT0ZhxBWhyd52A

3157550,2017-01-22,1,0_aeYE2-VbsZts_UpILgDw,"Lazy Dog is in a great location, it has an amazing, comfortable and beautifully designed building. But let's start talking about what matters, their food. I have Lazy Dog 4 starts for a reason, obviously, so let me explain it for you in a feel lines.

Their food was good, their drinks were amazing, but I feel like they did not have many dishes in their menu that would justify 5 stars, for example: 

-No truffle Fries
-No File minion
- no picanha  
-No Sushi  

So, with the competition around them, being around many trendy good restaurants at Downtown Summerlin, it pushes Lazy Dog to improve their menu. It's not just about having a 6 million dollars building with an expansive kitchen and good service, it's about food!

So, Lazy Dog is a very good option for large groups and very hungry and thirsty people. However, I feel like they would benefit from improving their menu a little bit. In addition, I feel like they should have an amazing hot dog there since the name of the place is Lazy Dog, but they dong!

Thus, Lazy Dog is a true 4 stars restaurant with great potential to reach 5 stars, like they are really, really close from getting that 5 stars from me. Just gotta add those truffle fries and a couple of options for sushi like a Temaki or a jalapeños yellowtail sashimi!",J4sI9iOi0ZmB7Q1t1vSqPA,1,0,4,NbXClxRd0P6dvEkVYe3w1A

3165357,2017-08-20,1,0_aeYE2-VbsZts_UpILgDw,"First time dining here for me. Birthday dinner for a good friend. Six of us total. Great experience overall minus a very odd encounter with a management type after we were seated and before we saw our waiter. First the good then the odd. Arrived without a reservation. Waited close to an hour for a table - but that's all good - It's a Saturday night on the Island of Las Vegas. Not a bad wait outside the patio area watching people and their dogs. When we were finally seated (this is where the encounter with the management person happened - but more on that later).  When our waiter finally made an appearance after a bit of a wait he was excellent. Terrific all through the dinner. His name was/is BJ and I was very impressed by his demeanor and service. After going over a few items (my first time - I never know what to order) he suggested the Bison meatloaf. Great suggestions. Excellent. Not as good as my wife's but for restaurant meatloaf it was close to that level. Came with very good mashed potatoes. My wife had a roasted chicken sandwich which she gave a big thumbs up to. My daughter is vegan and she had some kind of a veggie burger as did another in our party. Both said it was terrific. Mother-in-law had the Tex-Mex salad and she was happy - and as long as my wife AND my mother-in-law are happy - I'm happy. Finally, the birthday girl had a grilled cheese. Grilled cheese? I can't figure that out - but she liked it. 

I ordered the banana pudding for desert - something you don't see often on menus. Very good. Our wonderful waiter, BJ, brought over a big slice of their butter cake with ice cream on it and some other stuff. Superb. And of course; he had a candle on it. Right after taking our desert order, BJ did something that really impressed me. He saw that I had my credit card off to the side, kind of hiding it. My plan was to pay for dinner before the birthday girl's husband could reach for the check, which he ALWAYS does. I asked BJ where the restroom was - hoping to see him off to the side when I returned so I could tell him about the birthday girl and give him my credit card before he brought the check. He was very attentive and very sharp - he replied, ""I'll show you where it's at, sir...the directions are little tricky."" Well - he had actually intuited that I wanted to pay the bill and got me away from the table very discreetly. ""I thought that was your intention!"" he said. That was impressive. 

Now the odd part. After were first seated in a booth we were all very thirsty after waiting in the sun for almost an hour. Now, under these circumstances, five minutes can seem like an hour. But at least 10 minutes passed and no one came by our booth to inquire if we wanted water or drinks or anything at all. It was a bit too long for such a quick and simple check-in. Finally, the hostess walked by and I got her attention. ""Excuse me, could we please get some water."" She seemed like she was caught off guard and just mumbled ""Sure"".  A moment later another lady, who I found out later was named Carrie - and was a management type - came over and abruptly said ""I understand there is a problem?"" The way she said it and the timing was very uncomfortable. I'm thinking 'what the heck?'. I was about to say ""What do you mean, 'problem'?"" when, just then, a busboy came up with a tray of waters. Carrie realized that I was saying we just wanted water and she kind of laughed and said ""Ask and you shall receive."" I wasn't exactly laughing. It was odd. What did the hostess say to her? ""Hey Table XXXXX has a problem, can you speak with them""???? You would think she would just let someone know there were some thirsty customers patiently waiting.

Unedible: I ordered the pulled pork sandwich. The seasoning or sauce was off. I didn't taste any vinegar or tomato or spice. I tasted fat. Lard. Butter. Bland, fatty meat sandwich. The bun was the only thing winning about it. That was until a fucking bug flew on my plate and landed on my bun. A type of fruit fly or something all up in my business. Just great. My dining partner had the Chicken Parm which completely fell flat as well. Maybe we ordered off the dog menu or something. 

Speaking of dogs that's the only thing I like about this lazy place. Dog doors, dog theme, dogs can dine with you outside. I think they would be much better off turning this into a full on dog restaurant and dog park. The dogs would have a hard time writing reviews about their experience though. Dogs are so real so they would write bad reviews for this place, too I bet. 

Overall I will not be fining here again. I believe this restaurant fell under the Yelpers free event equals shiny reviews category. Clearly I don't play for that team. Hated it!",Sv48jgljDP-CRfXmU8uSgA,11,7,1,YG29J-HKdOcHPegt1W0tSA

Arrived for a late lunch and the restaurant was doing a brisk business. Given the choice of seating we chose a booth near the kitchen. In advance it looked to be a little quieter then the seating closer to the bar. And it was. The dining space is large but separated by half height walls. The decor the a nice mix of wood and steel. Wall art is a combination of dog photos and metal sculptures of various animals. The background music was not loud enough to interfere with our conversation. The restaurant and bar is well lit by large windows on two walls

Our server Daria greeted us and asked if this was our first visit. She extended a warm welcome and offered to answer any questions.

The menu has many choices both for dinner and lunch. After receiving our drinks a large round flatbread cut into 8 slices arrived at our table. Daria explained that it was a complementary welcome starter for our first visit. The flatbread is made to order with garlic and Parmesan cheese. It was very tasty and filling.. Enough left over to bring home. 
The general manager Phil stopped by the table and extended us his personal welcome to the Lazy Dog family.
 
The entrees selected were the Blackened Chicken Burrito Bowl and  All-American Burger
Blackened Chicken Burrito Bowl contains chopped chicken breast on top of Spanish rice and shredded cabbage, served with avocado, black beans, hatch chiles, jack and cheddar cheeses, house made salsa and fresh cilantro. This is a lunch special and is large enough to serve as a dinner entree. The flavors were fresh and delicious.
The All American Burger is two charbroiled quarter-pound beef patties layered with melted American Cheese and topped with shredded lettuce, tomato, red onion, pickles and a large mound of french fries on the side. The burger was cooked perfectly as ordered and had a great beef flavor. The fries were firm and  UN greasy. In order to get through the burger some of the large bun had to be sacrificed.
We look forward to a return to sample the Happy Hour menu which begins at 3 PM and can be a Late Late lunch and an Early Early dinner.",ywEB0MB_2U11NIGPs35pew,0,0,5,4AoI5DUHHGQS5-3ngHh-ew

When I asked the hostess who gave us our table if the music is always this loud she responded with, ""pardon me"" and moved closer to hear my question.

3255647,2015-06-07,2,0_aeYE2-VbsZts_UpILgDw,"Not impressed. (Be careful if you can't have gluten)

The service was---weird. Staff was really friendly and welcoming. BUT it was just odd that we constantly had people coming by and checking on us. I'm all for attentive service but we could barely have a conversation because someone was coming by every few minutes to see how we were. The hostess seated us and then we had two different waiters taking orders, and two other staff coming by just to check on us. It went from ""this is really nice"" to ""leave us alone already"".  We also had several staff walk by the table and simply stare. We were seated right near the kitchen which would account for all the traffic, I guess. But the staring was very unsettling. It was just odd. 

Food--everyone enjoyed their food. No one raved about it. Everyone in our party of five agreed there were better places to eat. But the food wasn't terrible or anything. 

However--I have a complaint with their gluten free menu. I do not have Celiac's but I do have autoimmune thyroid disease and have a gluten sensitivity that can severely exacerbate symptoms. So, I'm as careful as can be. I was really happy they had a menu catering to those who are gluten free. 

I ordered the grilled salmon with mashed potatoes and the Japanese cucumber salad. All of these are listed on the GF menu. So, the waiter comes back to the table to inform me that they cannot serve me the cucumber salad because it comes with sesame seeds so it is not gluten free. ????  Sesame seeds are not gluten. They should pose no problem. And if they do, why is the salad even listed on the GF menu and what is hard about leaving the sesame seeds off the salad?  But I make a point not to argue with the people making my food so I just opted for the fruit instead. Imagine my confusion when they bring out my salmon and it is covered in sesame seeds. It was also covered in some kind of asian ginger sauce. Most asian sauces do have gluten. The GF menu did not mention any kind of sauce in the description. I waited until the waiter came back over to check on us and asked him if he was sure this was a gluten free item because of the sauce. He assured me that the salmon was gluten free. 

I ate it but shouldn't have. Later that night I was severely ill and have had the usual symptoms I get when getting ""glutened"".  Yes, this is partially on me because I should have trusted my instincts; especially when they refused to bring me a salad with sesame seeds because they are supposedly gluten but then bring me a salmon covered in sesame seeds and tell me it is GF.  I do think if they are going to offer gluten free items though, they need to better train their staff. I'm pretty sure they were not supposed to include the ginger sauce on the salmon--a soy sauce that most likely contains wheat. 

The third star is because I seriously enjoyed the cucumber thyme lemonade.",abwO4VF4JcVYQ7CURAwsyw,0,0,3,qooOpCcnd-nFHKQewTdu3A

Food 3.5/5
Chose a beer and appetizers, I should have got a burger because definitely not good decision. Got sin city say hello to Amber pint. HORRIBLE do not get this it taste like dirty water. Definitely should be replaced. I ordered loaded potato hush puppies. Which were awesome side dish moist potato and bacon taste. Good enough to share. Also Japanese cucumber salad. Which was just a bunch of cucumber wish Asian dressing nothing amazing. My friends say the burgers were exceptional tho. 

Service 1/5
This is why I will not return. We were at a booth right behind a p.o.s. Which at any given time had 2 to 6 workers around it. After we received our food we were checked up on once with a water refill at that time. Then we finished our meal eventually. For a minimum of about 20 minutes we sat there with finished plates waiting.... And waiting .... And waiting. As at any given time with no lapse there was 2 to 6 workers standing 2 feet away. I eventually spoke up to one of the servers for checks. Which he basically said ok and told another server not even coming over to our table. Our waiter spent most of this 20 minutes at another table about 8 feet away from us having a convo with a couple. She came over once this happened. We asked for checks and boxes. She brought checks. Which we immediately had cash and card ready. Yet we waited another 5 to 7 minutes while there is still minimum 4 servers standing 2 feet away. Our checks obviously ready and standing. She came back took our checks. Cashed out and returned with all but 1 check which was 3 dollar change but she assumed it was tip. AND no box. We waited another 5 minutes or so before announcing to the group of about 3/4 servers we need a box. Finally got our box and was able to leave. The restaurant was less than half full, over staffed and yet had no attention from any server.

There is a reason it is called lazy dogs
Lazy workers. 

For the most part it's pretty much a yard house. Save your self the trouble and go to yard house. At least until they train their workers properly and have management team that keeps their workers busy.",xIfaUaUW1rvoQaVAJH2vRg,2,0,2,VBRyX7QY9hRHSS8qwiCmpw

Good thing Yelp is here to guide us to this awesome restaurant. Food portions were generous! Once you checked in via Yelp you'll get a good for 4 Cajun Fries...and it was good! Complimentary flat bread was also given which was very nice. So before our main dish came in we were already full! I had a delish chicken parmesan and my husband had capers. Yummy!

I am giving three stars because the service was slow, the restaurant was insanely loud, and the food is good but not outstanding in any way. As far as service was concerned, this was half be served experience and half serve yourself. There were sharing plates on the table which I like because it makes one less thing for a server to forget. Sadly though, we did not have any utensils. My dad had to get up and walk to a bus station to grab some. They were busy so no biggie... But we also had to help ourselves to pepper. (hence the serve yourself comment)

We all ordered an alcoholic drink. I had the sangria sampler...not worth ever ordering a glass. They were all boring. The presentation was cute though. We had the lettuce wraps as an appetizer and they were excellent. We each ordered an entree. One burrito bowl, one lunch soup and sandwhich, and I had the fish and chips. The fish and chips were actually really really good. Super crispy and flavorful. The other two, lackluster. Lastly we had the peach crumble dessert. It was okay. Nothing special and it took forever to get to our table. 

Bottom line about the Lazy Dog is: it comparable to a BJs restaurant. The service isn't great. Don't go here to have an intimate conversation. It is good for groups and families.

They were packed (It was a Saturday night, so it was to be expected), but we only had to wait 5 minutes. The atmosphere is absolutely amazing, very warm and inviting, classy but very casual. I felt like I never wanted to leave! 

5 stars for customer service alone! My bf ordered the Sriracha Chicken Sandwich, which I thought was a little out of his picky eater comfort zone, and naturally he wasn't a fan. He said it was ""not hot enough, not spicy enough, needs more cheese and less cucumber."" So I kindly asked our waitress if she could box that up and bring us the menu so he could order something else. I had every intention of paying for it, but she said she would just take it off the bill. I thought that was A++ customer service. THAT is what builds patronage. 

I had the Sundried tomato pesto pasta, and it was awesome. 

But what I really came here to write the review about. THE PUMPKIN CHEESECAKE  (If only words could echoe)

Was. The best thing. I have. Ever eaten. In my life. 

With whip cream, candied walnuts, chocolate and caramel syrup. This is legitimately what happened:

We both took a bite at the same time. Chewed. Eyes lit up. Swallowed. Looked at each other and we both said ""wow."" in synchrony. Continued to take more bites and saying wow after till it was all gone.

Only con is that it is seasonal! So please, if you value your life at all, go to Lazy dog before winter is over, get whatever you want, but order THE PUMPKIN CHEESECAKE.",IBfXie3My8uh8aYmynC3Sw,0,0,5,w8aZuJvZRt2S15EkFTofYw

Perfect dish if you love over salty and overpowering flavorful foods.  My mother in law got the Alfredo fettuccine but this dish just tasted like heavy cream.  No flavor!

We ordered the Hawaiian poke. That's a slap to the Hawaiian people. This poke was on a tortilla chip with smeared guacamole and 3 pieces of small tuna. I wouldn't have even fed it to my dogs. Next, the pizza. Wtf, seriously, the pizza wasn't even a pizza. I ordered the all American burger. It was so gross, I couldn't even eat half. It came out so cold, I felt like I was eating a hamburger that came out of a refrigerator. Even North Korea wouldn't feed it to their enemies. The vegetable lasagna. Oh Jesus.. Where do I even start in this. It reminded me of lean cuisine. Prison inmates get fed way better than this slop. What was the best part of the meal? The dog food I ordered. I ordered the grilled chicken and hamburger with brown rice. It was the only thing that looked fresh and delicious. Yes, the dog meal looked way better and apparently tasted way better than the food because someone in our group was still starving because they didn't want to eat their own food. They said the grilled chicken was really good.

Since I like beer I had to try a flight of this microbreweries best not so hoppy offerings. I fell in love with the Hefe. My hats off to the brewmaster for blending a honey toned hefe that is now amongst my favorite. The blonde and the stout came in for silver and bronze respectively. I cant forget to mention that we started our meal with the Hummus trio, which was delicious. But dessert was the icing on the cake pun intended.

I hadn't read the reviews or the menu, and despite my love for dogs, and the ability to bring them here, I just wasn't ""digging"" the place. I certainly get the appeal. I wanna like it. I really do. But, I just doesnt do it for me.
We arrived a party of 10, at 5:30 on a Tuesday night. The place looked empty at first, but once we got seated, it was quite crowded. (Bonus for us not having to wait more than 5 minutes.) The service was rather slow, and although busy, there seemed to be a lot of staff walking around. It took a while for them take our drink order, and it took quite a bit for them to be delivered. Which really sucked when they brought lousy drinks. My cadilac margarita was gross. No Grand Marnier floater as indicated and required of said drink. Just a way too sweet, yucky margarita. I switched to a mojito after first drink and liked that one better.
Reviewing the menu, I wasn't impressed. Nothing really jumped out at me. I did order for an appetizer the brussell sprouts. They were quite good. We really enjoyed them. I ordered the mahi mahi tacos with flour tortillas. I didn't really care for them. They weren't bad, but they weren't good. Something just didn't mesh well for me. My side wedge salad was pretty decent. 
For dessert, I got to try the keylime cheesecake and the brownie. Both were ok. Nothing to get all jazzed up about, but certainly fine.

The burger, on that very nice bun, was a totally uninspired frozen patty, which was ordered medium, came out red inside and cold (not not warm, actually cold) inside. Disgusting. Fries were the most basic, unseasoned, dull fries you could imagine. Absolutely forgettable and without a drop of creativity.

Some owners are completely oblivious to what their dogs are doing. There was one big one climbing  on top of my kid and I had to yell at the dog to get down and the owner to watch their pet.

The food is better than your average chain restaurant, but still has a calculated, impersonal feel to it. The Tex-Mex salad was a standard, serviceable version. Hawaiian sticky ribs weren't as tender as I expected, but the Asian flavors delivered a powerful kick of tanginess and sweetness, served with fries covered with a spicy mayo sauce. The best item I've tried at Lazy Dog was the Carolina pulled pork sandwich. Served on a brioche bun, the combo of tender pork covered in a tangy BBQ sauce and the sharpness from bleu cheese was a winner in my book.",C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w,7,6,3,aUtfXm0c8DTw4bwQl6qYBw
3519803,2017-07-28,43,0_aeYE2-VbsZts_UpILgDw,"I have been a fan of more than one Lazy Dog location in California. We travel with our fur baby, Brownie, and it's convenient when wanting to stop and grab a bite to eat and have that restaurant feel without having to hit up a fast food drive-thru. This location in Downtown Summerlin was nothing like any of my experiences at other LD restaurants. I came in with a group of friends and inside was pretty busy at first, but really cleared out half way through our meal. Regardless of the amount of customers inside, getting our server to acknowledge us was a major chore. We only ordered some nachos and mac and cheese, so I can't figure out what the problem was and getting drink refills wasn't easy either. 

Mac and Cheese ($6.50) - Smoked bacon, hatch chilies, five cheeses, green onion crumble make up their take on this dish. The bacon was very fatty and not good. There was so much green onion crumble on the top, which had a super funky taste to it (one person at my table described it as mold) and it didn't complement the mac and cheese at all. When we asked our server if the mac and cheese from the kids menu was anything special so we could maybe try that also and he responded that it's basically just Kraft mac and cheese. 

Chicken Chile Verde Nachos ($10.50) - hand-cut chips, slow-cooked tomatillo chicken, black beans, jack, cheddar, guacamole, salsa, tapatio crema, pickled jalapenos andqueso blanco. The nachos came piles high. Some of the chips were burnt. The toppings tasted decent, but there just wasn't enough of it for the amount of chips. Once we got through the top layer it was all chips after that.

The one plus about this place is that the patio is dog friendly and it's got a decent amount of tables/seating including an area with a fire pit. There's a menu for dogs and they will bring out a water bowl. I can't say I am eager to come back however I'd be open to giving this location another try down the road.",Fv0e9RIV9jw5TX3ctA1WbA,71,55,2,-WgR3537yKL2Rua-eIPFfw

His manager Jake called me so I could go over my experience at the lazy dog.  Jake called and was apologetic and said he would address both the issues with his employees and get them the proper training. He was very nice and empathetic with me.

It's the little things sometimes that make you happy.   Also tried the  grilled cheese and for sure those two were amazing and worth the trip for good hatch chili and  grilled cheese made to perfection, especially when you need some tasty comfort food!   This place is ultra dog friendly, hence the name Lazy Dog  you can sit outside and enjoy the view, the dogs and the amazing fire pit. I ordered the Chicken Poblano, it was good, but came out a little cold. The concept of the crispy tamale cake with the roasted peppers and cream sauce which was really more like a tomatillo sauce, but still tasty.  It would have been better if it was hot and  served over the tamale cake and the roasted peppers with the white chunks of chicken.  Nonetheless a place worthy of return especially with friends for an evening out and your furry friend.

Besides the area on the patio that accommodates dogs, it's a lovely ambiance that you can sit for hours (literally!). I was here for at least 4 hours talking the afternoon away. Soon it was evening & dinner time. You just feel warm and cozy here. 
So now let's talk about the food -  I found the choices to be different and ecclectic. Very nice presentation and my pesto/basil pasta was delish! My friend had the blackened chicken salad which I took a bite from. It was somewhat spicy but not too spicy. I thought it would be a great dish if there was some ranch on it.
I'm definitely going to return to this place. There's quite a few items I'd like to try. The clean and clear cut menus make choosing simple. However, on the flip side of great, I'd like to see more variety of sauces. Campfire sauce, creamy pesto, creamy blue cheese, etc. In addition, please try adding crispy chicken to your menu. I'd like to have the chicken salads but prefer crispy chicken strips sliced up.

3592613,2015-06-22,5,0_aeYE2-VbsZts_UpILgDw,"Lazy Dog provides us with a perfect example of average. Good, but not great. A true 3 star restaurant in every way.

Let me break it down for you:

* The food is good. It is not great, but it doesn't try to be. The architects of this place have sought out to appeal to the largest percentage of tastes. All the right options, all the proper ingredients so that everyone can find something. It is the ""smart business"" way of doing restaurants, find the middle of the road dishes that appeal to the greatest number of people. This approach is very popular with the large corporate chain restaurants.
* The service is good, but does not stand apart. Great service can only come from one place - it comes from servers who love what they do. There are several ways servers get to the point where they love what they do: great money, great schedule, great coworkers, great food, great management, great clientele, great location and great reputation are all factors that can affect how servers perform. This typically occurs when there are more ""great"" than ""good"" factors in this list. From the looks of it, Lazy Dog must have mostly ""good"".
* The prices are poor, to say the least. Yes, I understand that the location is prime and rents are most likely higher than many areas on the east side of town (no offense to East Siders). But no matter how you try to paint your picture, people always have a sense of value when they eat out. We all have this inner voice that can accurately balance the price point of the meal to the overall quality/quantity. A good tasting meal that comes in large portions and is inexpensive is always a winner. A good tasting meal that comes in small portions and costs and arm and a leg is always a disappointment, except in the case where it adds a notch to our culinary bedpost (i.e. a meal at Masa in New York City, which costs $585 per person).

Lazy Dog will be a success, mostly because of the disposable income crowd who, amazingly enough, always have the worst taste when it comes to food (yes, I did mean to offend them). 

Lazy Dog will always follow along with its namesake and keep making dishes that are just average. They will never takes risks, they will never go out on a limb. Their offerings will be good but not great, the prices will always be too high for their portions and their service will always be mediocre...

...because that is the great American business model for success - be average.",pWEzY3YY0zEAJLlGSSucrQ,9,5,3,Gs-JPtP8gmAdGa_qik0d7Q

First off the service was beyond excellent. Our waiter was super friendly and took amazing care of us. Plus the manager brought us out some free garlic flat bread when they found out we were first timers. How cool is that? 

Every dish we ordered was great. No, this isn't a gourmet expensive restaurant. It's a bar and grill kind of restaurant but with much much much better food. The hummus trio was a delicious start and I loved the ahi poke. It was super fresh and definitely a good snack. We also enjoyed the chicken verde nachos which were absolutely massive!

ATMOSPHERE:
I've only sat outside, as this is where your to be seated with your dog. I actually really like the outdoor area, there's a nice fire pit in the middle and TVs mounted as well. Plenty of tables, the wait is never too bad. Nice place to have brunch with your family. 

FOOD:
One word. Mediocre. 
I've tasted too many things here and while I can appreciate that lazy dog is trying offer a menu full of variety and it lacks flavor. Tried the nachos, plain, bland, and not enough toppings.  Tried the oven baked pancake, someone should tell whoever came up with this idea a pancake shouldn't be baked, it sticks to the pan they bring it in and is flat. The one decent dish here I would suggest would be the fish and chips, nothing special but the fish is always cooked just right. Also definitely try non-alcoholic drink creations here I really appreciate that part of their menu. Love the pineapple coconut water drink, perfect for the Vegas heat.

CUSTOMER SERVICE: 
Hit and miss, I've had awesome waitors and oblivious ones. It does getbusy here on weekends and they seem overwhelmed at times. I don't like to bash people because we never know what's going on behind the scenes. I love that it's pet friendly, my dog has never gotten sick from the food and that's why I return. 

Overall, if your looking for a casual day out with your pet and family I'd recommend this spot. If your not with your pet and looking for a nice dish, there's better options in Downtown Summerlin.",xX1wftld9-ndtISAAihqng,2,1,3,1qjY0SbIvoBhIWMRSlAWFw

I ordered the lunch special: Half Sandwich (Walnut Chicken Salad Sandwich) & Half Soup (Cream of Asparagus) w/ fries = $8.75

Portion size: 
They give a pretty generous amount of food for a lunch menu. The soup was more than a cup, and the half sandwich was pretty big. I eat a lot, and this was sufficient. If their lunch size was sufficient, I'm assuming regular menu would be more.

Taste: 
The Cream of Asparagus was delicious. It was creamy & thick, and that's how I like my soup. They also top it with fresh pieces of asparagus. The Walnut Chicken Salad Sandwich was creamy, generous amount of chicken, but the bread was too dry for me. Fries were average - not bad, but not the best.

Price:
Their prices are standard. Meals start $5 (small plate) and can go up to $27

Ambience:
Decor & interior is nice. Very cabin/woods-y. And of course, a lot of pictures & artwork of dogs.

Than 15 minutes later we received our entree. 
Overall not impressed at all and will never come back. I could have cooked at home and not wasted time waiting an hour and half for chicken breast. While the managers or people who had keys were at the bar chuckling it up with their friends. No one even acknowledge the mistake. Overall slow service & the food was burnt which was also disappointing !

Me and two others  had the bison meatloaf. I thought the flavor was unique. I enjoyed my meal. They used barbecue sauce, and other spices. There was nine of us and all of our food was luke warm!  I  would have preferred to have my dinner served hot. We didn't have time to send it back. We had plans after dinner.
The service was so slow, .
I was afraid I would get sober before I get my next drink!

Sat inside and it was cozy without feeling overcrowded.  Peeked out on the patio and saw a nice fire pit and several canine pals dining with their people.

Menu price and selection is excellent.  Our server was Finn and she was outstanding.  Her great service alone would have been enough reason to come back, but coupled with the good food, it made for a totally winning evening. We will definitely try to sit in her section again.  I'd also like to note all the staff members were pleasant and friendly.

So many good menu choices to please everyone from appetizers to small plates to entrees.  My partner chose the pot roast dip sandwhich with red mashed potatoes.  I had a small bite of the pot roast and it was tender and so good.  I chose the cast iron turkey meatballs with pine nuts, marinara, mozzarella,  and basil.  Even though it was a small plate, it could easily be considered as a filling small stand alone meal.  For my next visits, I have my eye on the cast iron trout and the bison meatloaf.

Definitely recommend this as an upscale casual experience that won't break the bank.  I also look forward to possibly dining with my little guys and girl (dogs) here soon.",TFfFBvt2GM7uj3LmLie_7w,1,1,5,_bjrmRVfLOtlDw5KNzNwJA

I enjoy the ambiance, the food, and the service.  The prices are right and I will continue to frequent this establishment. 

Let's get down to the details... 


Ambiance: 

Lazy Dog offers a casual and easy-going dining experience.
Dog inspired decor everywhere (don't forget to check out the restroom signs).  
They have a great patio that is dog friendly. 
Choose to sit on the patio. It is a great option in the Fall/Winter/Spring in Las Vegas (they have heaters for chilly nights)

Tip: Don't like dogs? Don't sit on the patio. 
 
Food: 

I've been here breakfast, lunch, dinner, and happy hour. 
I've been happy with everything I've tried. 
I've tried a lot more than what I listed. 
I take coworkers, family and friends here. 
It's a solid crowd pleaser with an extensive menu. 
They speckle the menu with a few seasonal dishes to keep things fresh. 

Here are a few of my favorite items I've tried. 

Wild Blueberry Pancakes (brunch menu)
Yum. I really liked that they loaded it with blueberries (my favorite).

Beer Battered Fish n' Chips (lunch/main menu)
I've had it for lunch (smaller portion). I liked it and they even bring vinegar for my fries. It also comes with apple cider vinegar slaw. 

Butter Cake (sweet tooth menu)
This is a butter cake topped with a strawberry and mint compote with vanilla bean ice cream and splash of balsamic. It was fantastic! 

Edamame (small plates- main menu) 
It was  spicy and delicious with a hint of citrus notes. 

Seared Ahi Tuna (main menu)
This sesame Ahi Tuna Steak is served over mashed cauliflower (don't knock until you give it a whirl).  It's topped with a light coconut curry sauce and is under 500 calories. It's delicious! I've ordered this at least 3 times.. 


Hummus Trio (starter) 
This is exactly what you think it is. A trio of hummus. A walnut-pesto, sundried tomato and traditional classic hummus. These are served with toasted garlic bread , sliced cucumbers, and tomatoes. They will also bring more bread and veggies is you ask with a smile (say cheese).  


Cocktails: 
Moscow Mule:
This is a solid choice. This is what I normally order. 
I like the fact that they have a clean cocktail menu.
The clean cocktail menu offers tasty drinks that are low on calories/sugar. 
They have list of drinks under 175 calories that are made with no artificial ingredients. 


Wild Blueberry Lemon Drop:
Another one of their clean cocktails under 175 calories that are made with no artificial ingredients. I loved this drink, too! 

Mango Chile Margarita 
My Mom and Husband's go to when they're here. 


Service: 
Their service has always been super friendly and efficient. 
They usually have a manager walking the floor checking in on tables (always a welcomed gesture). Servers have always offered their opinion when asked to about their favorite menu items. 

Overall, this is a solid 4.5/5 star establishment in my book!

We met a few other couples here for dinner and it was very bad. The food is just okay but for us the service is just absolutely horrid! Orders were wrong, service was at a snails pace and just a cold atmosphere. 
One person in our group had to get up to go to the bar to order another round of drinks for our party cause out waitress was mia and never offered to get another round for our table. 
Everyone in our group left feeling like it was a huge waste of time and money.... Which it was!! So frustrating!!!

We will not return ever. Our experience was so bad. We felt like the staff could care less about the customers.

""Now I lay me down to sleep, I pray the Lord my soul to keep.
If I die before I wake, feed Jake, he's been a good dog,
My best friend right through it all, if I die before I wake,
Feed Jake""

Here's my suggestion, take Jake to The Lazy Dog. 

My wife and I went, just the two of us for lunch, to see how good this restaurant is with our two daughters, and maybe even one of our four dogs.

From the moment we entered, we were impressed. The decor was interesting to look at. The staff was friendly.

The menu, I don't know where to start. The options were great as well. My wife, she ate a BBQ Ranch Bacon Cheeseburger with Cajun Fries. I opted for a Carolina Pulled Pork sandwich topped with onion strings and blue cheese coleslaw. 

There is patio dining and if you care to, bring your four legged family member with you! I love this idea, we will return and when we do, one of our four dogs will come alone. Maybe the wife and I will bring the kids along too.

One complaint, after we ordered, I noticed ""ring stains"" from a cup or glass sitting on our table for too long. We arrived about 20 minutes after the restaurant  opened, so I am unsure how long the table had this ""ring stain"" on it, which leads me to wonder how long it had been since the table had been properly clean,

3781948,2015-09-11,1,0_aeYE2-VbsZts_UpILgDw,"At first glance, I was thinking, just another novelty over-hyped Summerlin 'must go because everyone else is' restaurant, you know the ones... I don't get the dog thing though. I have a dog, love dogs, but when I go out to eat, my dog stays home. At least they keep those who cannot be away from their dogs for an hour out on the patio. That being said, this review is for the food and it was pretty good.
To start, we tried:
1) calamari - Asian sweet style, unique in my book, not the typical fried with marinara stuff. Tasty!
2) Hummus sampler. Good hummus...not so good on the lack of bread for dipping. You don't get pita bread, you get some kind of super thin cracker...and very few of them at that, plus some sliced tomato and cucumbers, was more like a salad or something. I'll pass on this next time.
Main course, we tried:
1) I attempted to try the pulled pork sandwich but they were all out of pork (this was a Saturday around 630) either they don't make enough or it's that popular.I was told it'd be 20 minutes to make some more and I passed. Got the chicken sandwich, was okay, nothing great. Lacked flavor.
2) Margherita pizza. This was good. Nice crispy crust, good sauce, good cheese.

This is a noisy place, don't come here for a romantic dinner. Also, it seems really busy at the front reception, but wait times weren't all that bad, like 20 minutes",CwzhFRwIkYFGkaggG0sTlA,2,0,3,hyaFj83diw3faJ7x_CI6HQ

First time around I ordered the spicy Thai chicken salad. When it arrived at the table, it looked like they had opened a store bought bag of $.99 mixed lettuce and mixed it up with salad dressing. Second time around I had the Turkey burger. It really was nothing to write home about, or recommend. The only plus side about this place is their craft beers are decent and my coconut mojito was really good once I got past the rotting pieces of mint floating around in my drink that I fished out with my spoon. However, I will give an A+ for my dog's food as she seemed to love it and I was very happy to find a place that we could bring her with a nice patio. Unfortunately, not happy enough to come back a 3rd time because the food quality here is lacking. I wanted to like this place, so much so, we gave it a second chance.

We then had a black and blue cheese pizza and an asian teriyaki salmon and rice dish....crazy good! best salmon i have ever eaten...and i live on the pacific beach and know my fish.

If you want to meet a girl, bring a puppy to the outdoor patio and wait no more than a minute or two before you meet 10 new people. Or, if you want to just meet other dog owners in general. But seriously, Lazy Dog is a dog and dog owners' heaven. There's a sign forewarning that if you're not canine-friendly, then you should probably sit indoors. But sitting outside was really fun seeing all types of furry friends out and about. 

As for the food, the menu is huge and it really got to the point where I had no idea what to order. It did remind me of a dog-friendly version of Cheesecake Factory with its choice of pastas, salads, and sandwiches. I ended up sticking with the carbonara, which came with a generous helping of bacon, romano, and a perfectly poached egg on top. 

Some of the smaller plates attempt to make healthy items taste better with some fat and grease, include the buffalo cauliflower and sweet potato tater tots with roasted jalapeno-lime aioli. Or you could just not care about what you're eating and just go for the mac & cheese, which features 5 cheeses with bacon topped with a green onion crumble (slightly healthy?). 

The food was decent, but you really come for the atmosphere, which is a perfect place to take all dogs on a carefree day.",fgkJ6KUlrmbKyLDQervxsw,5,1,3,yNxZiLbxKY3EHLwMTm0lIA

It was a Thursday night and it wasn't too busy. We were sat pretty much right away. This is the place to go if you want to bring your dogs because it's dog friendly and they even have an outside area to dine. We didn't bring any dogs though, so we sat inside. 

The menu had many options from appetizers, burgers/sandwiches, pastas, salads. I ordered a Ahi Tuna Burger with fries on the side and it was delicious.

I think I highly underrated Jen in my last review because we were excited every time she was our server! She moved to the Town Square location which is closer to our house so we love seeing her there now.

My only negative feedback is that they have gotten quite a bit of new staff at this location (summerlin) and they are far more lackluster, besides a few gems. We have had the same hostess greet us at least 4 times and she does anything but greet us. She usually stares at us blankly and waits for us to talk... she doesn't ask us preference or ask anything about happy hour seating or make any friendly conversation. A greeter should make you feel welcome, excited, and accommodated from the second you walk through the doors and every moment till you're sat where the server takes over. None of those things happened and we almost feel like we're inconveniencing her.

It wasn't bland or overpowering but came out hot and fresh with plenty of flavor. I could tell their kitchen takes pride in what they do.

I ordered the chicken curry bowl for my lunch/dinner.  My iced tea was brought quickly and was refilled without needing to ask.  The menu describes the bowl in this way:  Chicken and vegetables, slow-cooked in our scratch made coconut curry, served over steamed white or brown rice with our fiery carrot slaw.  The carrot slaw was not fiery to my taste but it did have some red pepper sesame oil poured on the carrot thins and it was very good.  You have the option of white or brown rice and I chose brown.  The curry chicken had a good curry flavor and the serving size was very generous.

Throwing caution to the wind (when don't I?) I ordered dessert--the Simms Family S'more.  The menu describes it thusly:  ...this house favorite is made with layers of rich chocolate fudge, graham cracker crust, peanut butter and warm brownie, topped with a giant, fire-roasted, housemade marshmallow and crushed peanuts.

The s'more was OK but I'd get a different dessert the next time.  The chocolate was very good but the marshmallow was a bit of a challenge.  Since it's one thick piece of marshmallow, you have to attack it with your spoon, hold it up off the dish, and wait for the lower part to slowly drop away.  It was a bit of a challenge using just the spoon.  It was tasty but I never like fighting with my food.

Service was outstanding.  What would normally me a 3 star review earned the fourth star with the friendliness of the staff.  Although it was a rather slow time, I'm guessing it's generally that way.

There wasn't anything special about their all American cheeseburger. It was basically a regular cheeseburger on fancy brioche bread. The Cajun fries had flavor, but it seemed a little stale. You really had to bite into the fries to consume it. Not really a fan of their strawberry lemonade as well. I had to switch to a Sprite. 
However, The roast beef dip sandwich was to die for. The aju sauce was on point. My girlfriend almost died eating it, it was that good. 
On the down side, the hostesses there were rude. It was our first time there, and they looked at us like we were idiots.

What a cool joint! Great ambiance. Big patio with giant fire pit. Very doggy friendly. There were lots of doggy diners...looked to me like they served them bowls of water and brown rice. How cute! 

I'm not familiar with the lazy dog chain...apparently there are 15 in California. It's a very family friendly, bustling, tasty, affordable restaurant. 

During my 2 visits thus far, I've had the sausage mushroom bisque, hatch chile and bacon Mac and cheese, loaded baked potato hush puppies, poblano chicken, hummus and chicken salad, rhubarb crumble, Jamaican lemonade, and cucumber thyme lemonade. The lemonades are fun and not too sweet at all which I love! The Jamaican lemonade comes with a fun little squeezer of coconut milk. Both are served with a trendy chevron straw. The bisque is absolutely delicious. Creamy and scrumptious. A bowl is huge. Easily enough for a meal. The poblano chicken was packed with flavor. It is served with corn cakes and loads of peppers and onions. The Mac and cheese was tasty but salty; very cheesy. The hummus chicken salad was a conundrum. A very eclectic mix of ingredients. The salad part was disappointing. Cheap wilty shredded lettuce. The grilled chicken with walnut pesto part was delicious. Moist and flavorful. The sun dried tomato hummus and pita were yummy too. All these things combined with balsamic and tomatoes- just so strange. The rhubarb crumble was absolutely delicious and massive! It could easily feed 4 people. Warm, gooey, tart and divine.

This review is based only on my experience at the bar for Happy Hour only.

It's not possible to convey how we feel about this establishment with a Star Rating, because the review must be broken down into several, yet extremely opposite parts.

We went to Lazy Dog Restaurant & Bar for the first time yesterday.  The atmosphere and restaurant is very pleasant.

The staff, bartenders and manager provide five star services.  I have to say that they are great and the management should be proud of every one of them. However we were very disappointed with the happy hour food.
 
We had three selections; Wings, Calamari, and Nachos.
My opinion is that this restaurant completely dropped the ball here. The chef tried, but terribly failed with the preparation, taste and presentation of the Calamari.  It tasted like they opened a bag of frozen calamari, fried it, threw some Asian sauce on it and presented it over rice.  Wow!  This was not good at all.  

 I ordered the chicken nachos; unfortunately I was violently ill for 12 hours immediately after consuming this dish.

 I feel badly that I have to write about this but I think it's in the best interest of my fellow readers.  Hopefully the Lazy Dog will be more careful with what they serve.   I wanted this place to be a home run and it was just the opposite. 

Fantastic service cannot overcome terrible food.  I hope they will improve and consider reviewing the menu and putting in place a better system to monitor safety and quality in their kitchen.",jk_jaNf4FEkh51mQWdGQrQ,0,0,2,dYQCXx_Wf9XQGMQsqiNOhg

Tasted like Kung Pao over rice. Will order that every time. 

We ordered brunch/lunch after that. The soups and salads were pretty standard. The burger was cooked perfectly as ordered and was very juicy. Seems like something they do well consistently. Also had the Country Chicken and Biscuits off of the brunch menu. It was hearty and savory. Great dish for a late breakfast.

The hostess was very friendly and personable! She talked to us about our day, about some menu items and was all in all great! I wish she had been out waitress! After we were seated our waitress who was nice, but not memorable came and took our orders:

Drinks:

Bloody Mary
Jamaican Lemonade

Appetizers:

Garlic Flatbread  

Lunch:

Baja Burger W/Cajun Fries
Warm Chicken Focaccia 

Drinks were 5/5 I would definitely recommend the Jamaican Lemonade!

Appetizer: 5/5 but we substituted Ranch instead of the marinara.

Lunch: 3/5 The Burger was great but huge and messy and the Chicken Focaccia had a bunch of hard dried up pieces of chicken in it like it had been sitting under the heat lamp too long, which would make sense given the fact that we had to wait almost forty minutes for our food to come out.

Okay I'll get real. This is now one of my new favorites. We just so happened to come in on happy hour. Woot woot! He ordered a draft Coors light and i ordered the sampler. If you get in on the happy hours I highly suggest ordering the lazy dog sampler! Delicious! My favorite was the stout! Very smooth very satisfying like coffee. 
We ordered the nachos, fire roasted pizza with sausage and chilli oil, mac n'cheese, and the stuffed hush puppies.  Now at the start of the night I already new I wanted nachos so I might be biased, but those were some killer nachos! Next their hush puppies were terribly good! Mashed potatoes breaded and fried. Very good. The pizza should have been a lower price but very good. The mac n'cheese was almost good. Didn't really hold up to everything else. We ate everything! After all that I ordered a lazy dog stout and dessert. I ordered the s'mores and he ordered what is so highly recommended by Yelp and by the waitresses, the butter cake. The butter cake pales in comparison to the s'mores! Omg it's like my favorite thing now even as full as I already was! That marshmallow!! Heavenly!
The service could have been better. Now this place is pretty big but it was nearly empty. The waitress didn't come by nearly as often as she should have and she took far too long to bring me my beer. I was done with desert by the time she brought it though I ordered it before we ordered dessert. Very uncool. Then we waited far too long for her to pick up our check. Also as i said this place was nearly empty yet we were seated across or next to the waiters station. So we got to listen to their talk and so on all night. That was ridiculous since the whole place was clear for seating. It's literally 3 feet at the most from your table so all these waiters and waitresses are on your lap all night yet we didn't get the attention we should have. :-/

Went here for dinner, for my friend's dog's birthday.. we had a ""bark-day paw-ty"" at the Lazy Dog! It wad really nice how accommodating the staff was for the celebration. You can order a bowl of beef or chicken with rice for the dogs. Seating with your pet is outdoors. Because it was dinner, the weather was nice sitting outside, not too hot in Sept.

Had the Campfire Pot Roast & Ceviche Tostadas.. both were so good! The Pot Roast was tender, the meat just fell apart easily & it meshed well with the spinach & mashed potato. The ceviche was fresh & light, a good appetizer - 3 tostadas an order.

I hear the other locations have great tasting food & service. For this being my first time, it was definitely a nice experience. Planning on going back to try their Brunch menu.",dII18XDmrddFBaldkcLOvA,0,1,4,fQLUsaf24TvSGn48_kB9ew

4110118,2016-03-20,1,0_aeYE2-VbsZts_UpILgDw,"We decided to come here right in the middle of the Sunday brunch rush on the first day of spring (3/20/16). The sun was out and it was about 80 degrees so we weren't surprised to see the crowd gathered in front of the patio/waiting area.  I decided to go in anyway to see what the wait was like.  The hostess asked if we wanted inside or outside, since we were dogless and was really just looking for a place for a quick bite and cocktail, I said inside.  She said the bar is open, self seating with full menu or we can wait about 10 min for a table in the main dining room.  I took the bar offer and realized there were plenty of seating inside, everyone just had their dogs so needed to wait to be sat on the patio.  
The inside was still nice and had a good vibe so I was happy with not having to wait.  We started out with 2 orders of ""Hair of the Dog"" Bloody Mary's on the brunch menu ($5/each) and from the full menu ordered the 1/2 soup and salad.  The soups you get choose from is either chicken tortilla or the seasonal special which was cream of asparagus.  The salad you get the choice of is either Caesar, wedge or house greens.  
When our lunches arrived we were surprised how big the portions were.  The salads were served on a good size plate and the soup was more of a bowl then a cup.  This soup/salad combo came out to $7.95 each with the exception of my boyfriends tortilla soup + avocado which $1 was charged.    This wasn't a big shock though since Chipotle charges .50 for guac and avocados can be pretty pricey.
The bartenders were attentive and when we told her how surprised we were of the portion size she mentioned that everything is made from scratch also, you can't beat that!

I wouldn't say this was the most amazing food I've ever had, but I also wouldn't say this was the worse bar food I've ever had.  I really like the atmosphere (with or without a dog) the pricing, the service and the menu options.

Yes this restaurant is dog themed but it is done in a way that is surprisingly tasteful and not overdone.  You can also bring Fido along and dine out on the patio area if you do.  Luckily my party of two only had to wait about 15 minutes for a table.  Our server was friendly and attentive, she asked us if this was our first time dining there and we said it was.  Our drink and food orders were taken and brought out quite quickly.  The manager even stopped by at our table to introduce himself and bring us out a complimentary garlic flatbread since he heard it was our first time eating at Lazy Dog.  The food and drinks were all delicious, this place is definitely one of the better and more reasonably priced restaurants in Downtown Summerlin.  It looked like this place had a decent happy hour too so I'll have to come back and check it out.     

We ordered:
-Spicy Thai Chicken Salad ($9.95) - I had a pretty big lunch so I ordered this thinking it would be light, but the portion size was generous!  I had left overs of this salad, it was delicious and filling.  This menu item did have a flame next to it meaning it would be a bit on the spicy side.  I didn't find it too spicy but I think that's more of a personal preference type of thing. 
-Chicken Pot Pie ($13.75) - My friend ordered this and I had some of the dish.  It was quite tasty one of the better chicken pot pies I've had.  The crust was nice and flaky and the inside had the right amount of chicken to veggie ratio inside too.   
-Coconut Mojito ($8.75) - Super light and refreshing perfect if you want a cocktail but nothing too heavy that'll leave you feeling overly bloated.  
-Southern Lemonade ($7.95) - This drink was delicious a bit on the sweet side, couldn't taste the alcohol in this drink at all (which I guess is a pro or con depending on what type of drinks you like).",hgfqysg2htnJI5bvtIIUjg,2,2,5,iZkKl4CHG-dMduMIBYPdLQ

The menu on Yelp is so easy to use and order from and you can choose from take out or delivery (which is FREE). Most places charge a fee, or force you to oder a minimum amount, which can be annoying when you don't eat large portions and just want something small. 

Anyway, I was looking for something without Gluten due to intolerance, and this place has an entire GF section, and I love and appreciate them for providing me with that peace of mind. 

What I found was DELICIOUS, yet simple (and super cheap, if that's yo thang). A cup of the Chicken Tortilla Soup and a side of mashed potatoes left me satisfied AF. 

So if you're in Vegas, check this place out, you will not regret it!

I also ordered a ginger ale and whiskey and was surprised to get not that but something better and new lol. They gave me whiskey with a ginger simple syrup, I now have a new drink if the place I'm at is as fancy as lazy dogs and decides to carry ginger simple syrup lol.  Anyways they always have new recipes on their menus as well as seasonal deserts and appetizers or starters. They had a crazy twist on elotes pretty much instead of corn they used hair loom carrots and I loved it.  Also decided to get their version of pad Thai and it was nice to get something like that out of a place like lazy dogs totally unexpected!

I had heard you could bring your dogs with you here but until I saw it firsthand and was asked by the hostess how many people and how many dogs I wasn't sure I believed it!  How awesome to bring your pooch with you to a restaurant!!  I recommend this place for anyone looking for a dining option in Downtown Summerlin, dogs or not, this place is epic!

Positives
1) Menu is gigantic!  I don't think there is a way that everyone visiting couldn't find something that they would enjoy on the menu!  We had the ""Grizzle Fries"" and ""Chicken Lettuce Wraps"" for appetizers and I recommend both.  I enjoyed the Fried Chicken Sandwich while my wife enjoyed the Black & Bleu burger as main course and both exceeded expectations.  There is also pizza, salads, noodles, along with a variety of meat dishes!  I can't wait to come back and try more of the menu.
2) Brunch menu available until 2pm on Saturday & Sunday.  We didn't have brunch on our most recent visit but look forward to trying the bananas foster French toast, steak & eggs Benedict, breakfast nachos, or breakfast burger!
3) They allow dogs on the outdoor patio and even have a ""dog menu"" with some basic dog rules: https://www.lazydogrestaurants.com/img/content/NUTRITION09252017054106.pdf
4) Service is exceptional, I cannot stress enough how important great service is at a restaurant and this place checks that box emphatically!  Well done.

Negatives 
1) Not the fault of the restaurant but this place is popular and wait times could be extensive during peak periods!  Not sure if the take reservations or are on Open Table, may be worth checking out.
2) Parking is adjacent to the mall and was crowded.  I got lucky and found a spot right up front but saw many people walking quite a distance across the parking lot to enter the restaurant.",bK83JqfkLOOayKXjoaR62A,2,1,5,KZ0Z28IgH3UBdjuAoknqHQ

The first time I came I was impressed by the variety of food and I loved that it was so noisy that kids are welcomed. The second time I came was with coworkers for lunch. We sat at the bar and I got my sandwich as well as my other coworker a good 10 minutes before my other coworker got her soup. I thought it was a bit strange but I didn't really think it was too big of a deal. It took them awhile to get us the check so we could get out there. I think we were there for a hour and a half and it wasn't because we were wasting time. My 3rd time here, I made reservations for a party of 10. It was ok but my brother's entree took a good 15 minutes to arrive after all 9 of our entrees had arrived. Service was quick in the beginning but lacking at the end. 

Fast forward to my 4th and last visit to this place. We made reservations for 5 pm. It took them 10 minutes to seat us, I'm assuming that they didn't have the tables ready. There were about 4 hostesses up there. After we were seated we had our drink orders taken right away and the appetizers. We then had to wait another 15 minutes for her to come back and take our order which would be fine but I saw that she took a drink order for another table, brought them drinks and took their order. I know we were a big table but you would think that you want to get rid of us first. She came and took our order and it took another 15 minutes to get our entrees. Well one of my brothers didn't get his entree and we didn't see our server for another 10-15 minutes after that. I asked about it and she said she would check. I saw her check the computer as well as her notes. His food came out about 5-10 min later. By that time we were all done eating and when they brought it out it was the wrong thing. They brought out the manager and said that the entree would be comped blah blah blah. My brother said he said he ordered a certain type of chicken but when she repeated it she said another thing  but she changed it to what he said so in his head he was like oh crap.

When we first arrived there were 3 people ahead of us, so it took about maybe a 15 min wait to be seated which wasn't that bad considering it was a Sunday afternoon. Once seated we were placed all the way in the back behind a pillar which is fine I guess, but considering that there were a couple chairs in front I don't know why we were seated so far. Ok, fine whatever. Once seated, no one came to greet us, it took literally 30 mins for our server to come greet us then take our order. Even with that, we've been sitting there without any utensils and no water for quite a while. I was ok to wait since we had my dog with us and well it was an outing occasion for him since it was his birthday. 

Once we got our food, we had already been there for an hour. The food was mediocre, the only thing that had taste was the Cajun fries even then it was tiresome to eat cause the flavors out did itself. I got the Tex-Mex salad which had a recommendation paw next to it, I thought it was ok. Nothing special to it, and my bf got the lunch special wok chicken which he said was all right. The rice was undercooked, and the flavor was just not there.  I ordered a hamburger patty and brown rice for the little one, and he agreed the rice was undercooked cause even he didn't eat it all, and this boy loves rice lol.

Overall the doggie sitting outside experience was ok, my little one enjoyed being near us. But the food and service was terrible, I'm sad to say I would not be going back again.

Food and drinks are pretty good. I enjoy their martinis and wine flight. Great bloody mary's for brunch too.
Food wise, sticky ribs with slaw are awesome - meaty with good flavor. I really enjoyed the ahi burger and like their twist on the calamari app. The calamari is stir fried in plum sauce and comes on a bed of rice. Really yummy!
The service has been great every time. Accommodating and personable staff. I take patio seating since that is the only area where pups are allowed. My favorite part of the bring your dog to eat concept is that your pup will eat too! They will serve your fur baby water and you can buy them a protein and rice bowl. You have a choice of white or brown rice and either chicken or beef patty. My phatty loves the patty (hehe).

The manager (I'm guessing) was so polite. He made us feel welcomed like and comfortable. Te little gesture of helping my brother take his jacket off was very impressive. He continuously walked around and made sure everyone, not only our table, was having a great experience. He even offered to turn off the fire place because we had long sleeves and what not on. The food is good. We had the chicken nachos, wings and tuna poke to start all were very delicious. The nachos are a big portion. we were full off of the appetizers. We ordered the lamb shank with mashed potatoes it was yummy! the lamb was so soft and juicy it literally melted in your mouth. The make your own pizzas on the kids menus take  a little longer so i recommend starting it right before or around the time you start appetizers. I love the fact that any burger can be substituted with a turkey burger.

The place was crowded and we sat there for about 10 minutes as I looked around for a waitress. A waitress sees me looking around while she's carrying a try full of drinks and stops over to ask if anyone had helped us yet. She delivers her drinks and immediately returns to help us. Such a great way to show great customer service!! She ended up being our server for the night until she switched shifts. I wish I had a chance to thank her for being attentive and giving such great service. Her name was MARIA. The next server was SELINA and she was also very good with us!

If given the choice, go for the outdoor patio! The patio has awesome fire pits and is dog friendly. Part of the fun of eating here is dog watching! 

The menu is fantastic - I recommend the calamari as an appetizer. It's not your run of the mill calamari, rather it's Asian seasoned and served with rice. They also have fantastic fish tacos and sandwiches for your main course. The best drink on the menu hands down is the coconut mojito. It tastes like a tropical vacation. 

The bathrooms are clean and the wait staff is friendly.

4484782,2015-04-26,7,0_aeYE2-VbsZts_UpILgDw,"Lazy Dog was crowded, but we only had to wait about 15 minutes for a table at around 8:30 p.m., and it's Saturday night.  That's because it's a big place, and offers a variety of seating in the restaurant, bar, and also the patio, where (wo)man's best friend can join you for dinner.  

The only canines with us tonight were in our mouths, and they wanted to do their work.  But first, the drinks.  I was thrilled to see that Lazy Dog hasn't copied every other chain restaurant.  They actually have the drink prices printed on their menus!!!  Having been burned more than a few times, we always ask, and we didn't have to endure the waitress saying ""I THINK the price is...,"" or have a server run back to the bar repeatedly to ask the bartenders.  I deplore this practice, so it was refreshing.  And so was the Peach Bellini I ordered, which was served in a tall, skinny glass with the peach puree , and a fresh individual 187 ml bottle of Freixenet Cava on the side. The draft beer list is extensive, and the prices are reasonable - my Bellini was 7.25, and I could have had a margarita for less, and his draft Tenaya Creek was 4.00 for 16 oz.

My husband ordered the Chicken Pot Pie, and I decided on the Chicken with veggies and pasta in a lemon caper sauce.  We also ordered a side salad, and our waitress properly asked if we wanted it before or with our meals.  We wanted it before, to share a little nibble before the main event. The one downfall in the service is that it never appeared, but the runner came out with our entrees.  Rather than have the food taken back to get cold, we cancelled the salad.

The hubster loved his pot pie.  I wasn't all that crazy about my pasta dish:  it was bland, the eggplant cubes were undercooked, and it was way too salty.  Though I have no trouble sending back a dish that isn't prepared properly, I was going to just stick with it.  But suddenly, unbidden, a young woman appeared, introduced herself as Lorena, a manager, and asked how my food was.  Not my husband's, just mine.  I told her all about it, but said I was going to keep it, even after she offered to get me something else.  Turns out that she's not a manager at this branch; she's from corporate, and is charged with getting this new restaurant up and running.  It's their first location outside of California, and they want to get it right before their next venture into Texas.  She said that they'd had a number of complaints about my entree, namely all of the things I found wrong with it.  She stated that she was already taking it off the check, and insisted I get another entree, even if I had it boxed up to take home, which she also was going to comp.  How could I resist!!

Act II was the Walnut Chicken Salad Sandwich, on the brioche roll instead of the multigrain bread, at Lorena's suggestion.  All the stuff I love:  walnuts, curry mayo, cranberries, and more.  It was delish!!  But more important, that experience was Service, with a capital S.

We both really love Lazy Dog, and their very big menu - plus a nice Happy Hour menu - and with the location pretty close to home, we'll be back again and again.",m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,9,7,5,gc3AsxUq6MBO_O0f9xPLpg

Despite the place being packed, I felt welcomed immediately.  None of that ""oh you are a party of one"" face to which I have become so accostomed.  Not the standard broken record, ""hello my name is"" but truly welcomed.  

He immediately asked if I would like another drink--the first came from the bar--and gave me his suggestion for the mango jalepeno margarita when I asked for something different.  Excellent suggestion!  And, it paired perfectly with my burger.

The veggie burger was delicious.  The cajun fries were a good upsell.

Honestly if they did not have the dog friendly patio I would never come back here, but the ambiance of the patio and the fact that you CAN enjoy a drink with your pup is enough to bring me back. I have been here 4 times and every single time it seems to be the same story...
Pros:
1.Service has always been great especially the waiters and waitresses. My friend had a complaint about her food and the manager came by and it was handled with nothing but professionalism and her meal was comped which was very nice.
2.Drinks are ALWAYS on point. They have some great bartenders here. 
3.Great atmosphere and kept really clean seeing as to how there are dogs everywhere! 

Cons :(
1.the food is SOOOOO mediocre! I have never been wowed by ANYTHING here. It's very much a Applebee's, Chili's type quality. I've had the strawberry french toast, the chicken pot pie, the spinach artichoke dip, the veggie lasagna and the fish and chips and every single dish was just really lacking in taste, quality and freshness. 
2. As awesome as the doggie meals are, I worry how fresh the chicken and meat in them are as even though my dogs have never gotten sick from them, my friends dog within hours became severly ill with vomiting and diarrhea. Makes me worry that maybe the meats they use in the doggie meals are very low quality. We called them after to let them know and they were very apologetic.

So again, great spot to chill with your pup and get a drink but don't expect some out of this world meal. I think with maybe just a bit more effort and quality with the ingredients in the food it would be SO much better.",otgJn5Z4Ka7xTO2Pn8QKKQ,0,0,3,qCl0aMpUnTUL-aVosrMvPQ

My boyfriend's mom and I came here for a bite to eat with my little man, Logan. The wait was about 30 mins which wasn't bad for a Friday night. We lucked out and the weather on the patio was perfect. The only downside to being on the patio is how crowded it can be once all the dogs are out there. 

For food this time around I had the ahi tuna sandwich. It wasn't the best I ever had, but still tasty. 3/5 I did like the option of a watermelon slice as a side though because I love watermelon.

While there she took our food order in which we ordered appetizers and entrees.  Fifteen minutes after that we were descended on by three wait staff with all of our entrees. 

We immediately complained that we had not yet received our appetizers at which our appetizers arrived. We protested again then one of the wait staff remarked ""so you want us to throw away all of this food?""  

Fortunately a manager passed at this time seeing our confusion and frustration.  And assured us they would re-fire our entrees. We pointed out that we had still not received our drinks. He went to the bar to retrieve our drink order while we began to enjoy our appetizers. Shortly after that we received our initial drink order followed closely behind by a duplicate order served by the manager.  He then took away the duplicate order again apologizing. 

We finally were able to enjoy the appetizers with our drinks. Once finished the fresh entrees did arrive.

4655351,2016-12-25,6,0_aeYE2-VbsZts_UpILgDw,"3.5 Stars: Very Good:

  Lazy Dog is a California - based casual family owned restaurant chain that opened this 10,696 square foot restaurant in late 2014 (Eater Las Vegas). Despite its roots southwest of Las Vegas in Southern California it's inspiration is northeast of Las Vegas in the snow capped mountains of Jackson's Hole, Wyoming. Owner Chris Simms was a fan of the ski lodge where he would spend a plentiful of time in a place that had warmth and excitement. He came up with starting a restaurant that resembles a ski lodge. It is fitting that he was getting into the restaurant business since his parents started Miami's Cafe. Chris Simms was also inspired by a lazy dog that hung out in the lodge. Here is an excerpt from the Lazy Dog website:

"" Where did the Lazy Dog name come from? One snowy afternoon, walking back into the lodge after a long morning on the slopes, Chris noticed a dog lying by the toasty fireplace. Commenting to his buddies on how much he loved his time hanging out there, he told them he wished everyone could enjoy life as much as that ""lazy dog' by the fire.""

  I am also a fan of the lodge. Unfortunately Red Rock Canyon a spot where I hike, is in need of a lodge. Fortunately this replica of a lodge is a few miles east in the northwest quadrant of downtown Summerlin closer to Red Rock Casino than to Macy's. Recently, we'd end up here twice after Red Rock Canyon. 

 The visits started out fresh with plenty of parking. The nearby seasonal ice skating rink compliments the lodge theme. 

  As soon as we walked in I noticed a wire statue of a dog. Adorning the walls there are more pictures of dogs. And toward the back by the open kitchen there is another wire dog statue. Until I read the back story, I was thinking,  ""what  is the deal with all these dog pictures?"" I was impervious to the fact that there is a dog friendly patio where the food is for the people and the dogs. 

   My food wasn't for the dogs. On both post-hiking meals, I ordered off the lunch special. On the first visit I spent $8.50 on the chicken parmesan with pasta and on the second I spent $8.50 on the fired-wok chicken over rice. This was before the fountain beverage. The food was good. Missing from the Lazy Dogs dining experience is complimentary house bread. The scenery makes up for it. 

   True to Chris Simm's intentions the inside resembles a lodge. My eyes took in an interior design that merges urban with lodge. In the center is a large bar adorned with a sundry of flat screen TV. In the back is the open kitchen. Through out the restaurant are the dog pictures and statues. There is one wall near the rest rooms that is adorned with license plates. Just like a lodge there is plenty of space in a room with a moderate to low noise level. 

   Walking from one dog picture adorned wall to the other were the servers. In similar fashion to the dogs in the pictures, they smiled. The servers were friendly and efficient. 

   My return factor is foreseeable. In the near future I would like to try their newer and second location that opened up in Town Square. In writing this review I am spreading the word that Lazy Dog is an upbeat replica of a lodge where people and dogs can enjoy good food.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,8,6,3,BbYCvGjy0cA2_q7fBpiQew
4657679,2016-03-05,0,0_aeYE2-VbsZts_UpILgDw,"UPDATE 06/14/18

I'm changing my review to 5 stars because this restaurant is the only place I go now with my dog. I've probably had everything on their menu by now and the quality of food and drinks is awesome. Service is great too! I can take my dog to any restaurant with a patio in Downtown Summerlin but we just keep coming back to this place all the time! The vibe is awesome and my beagle likes socializing with other pups. It's very easy to drop $100 on dinner for 2 people here but it's totally worth it! 


UPDATE 8/10/17

Food quality and selection has improved amazingly since my last review. Everything tastes delish and I especially like ahi tuna with coconut curry cauliflower purée. We keep coming back to this joint all the time because of the dog friendly patio and chill vibe. However, Lazy Dogs service is still major HIT or MISS and one time it was so bad that the manager ended up comping our drinks. I'm not sure why they can't hire more people to fix this issue. 

---
I've been here 3 times and it's always HIT or MISS. The only reason why I keep coming back is location and dog friendly patio (btw, a lot of restaurants with patios allow dogs, so the concept isn't new). 

The food is definitely just OK. We ordered roasted brussel sprouts and they were burnt, swimming in oil and lemon dressing. I can do better at home. Same thing happened with my chopped salad - lemon dressing was overpowering and my dog's chicken tasted better than the one in my salad. I sent my dish back and got tacos which were not bad. 

Drinks are great. I ordered Blueberry martini made with natural ingredients and it was phenomenal. 

Dog menu is just chicken and rice and portions are huge, suitable for a great dane and not a beagle (which is my dog). 

Last but not least, service. Well... that's another hit & miss here. Sometimes it's slow and they forget your order and sometimes it's pretty good.

Bottom line - next time we are going to try another place and just take food to go and eat it by the ""rock"" fountain.",PchA9aLWOG7fwFUAVlVQgw,0,0,5,a2GoOAPErgw-RyzJCMJsog

Last time I went to Lazy Dog and saw people sitting INSIDE, I almost ran through the restaurant screaming ""Do you know what is just outside those doors???? Puppies! Dogs! Furry creatures! Why are you not outside giggling over the cuteness of all the doggos?!"" 

Our four legged friends get their own menu at Lazy Dog (chicken or burger with brown or white rice btw) and these guys love it! Also, watching my Goldendoodle ( @boomgoesthedoodle on Insta) impatiently await the arrival of his burger, as his head whips around each time a server passes him by, makes me say, ""Same.""

Oh, right, they also serve people food. Everything is prepared from scratch (no frozen bagged fries here) and all in all, it's a solid meal. They're good about customizing and have a nice happy hour.

It comes with 2 pieces of pita crackers? I think that's what it is. & they definitely don't skimp on the shrimp! I'm not quite sure what the name of the dessert I took a pic of but it was delicious!

The menu is eclectic and it's a great spot for a big group since there seems to be something for everyone. The Kids Menu was equally great with several options that you don't normally see. There was edamame as an appetizer and Ruben's nephew enjoyed that!

Cajun Fries ($5.50): Really tasty fries. I love Cajun seasoning and these fries are just done right. This large serving is easily shared! I didn't like the Chipotle Ranch that comes with the appetizer. I'd request regular ranch dressing.

Wok-Fired Calamari ($10.75): Calamari strips tossed in sweet soy plum sauce; topped with peanuts, bell peppers, green onions, sesame seeds. We opted for brown rice (no additional charge). The calamari was okay, though I didn't care for the dish overall. The sauce that doused everything was grossly sweet and sticky. Not my type of ""Asian"" dish.

Chicken Poblano ($13.95): Chicken breast sauteed with sweet white corn, peppers, and onions in a roasted pobalno cream sauce, served with crispy tamale cakes, micro cilantro, and tapatio crema. This was really tasty. The chicken was nice and the sauces were flavorful. I really enjoyed the crispy tamale cakes!

The restaurant is located in the new downtown area.  

Upon entering I was greeted by two friendly hostesses and offered to sit either inside or outside.  The wait was 45 minutes.  There were plenty of seats at the bar so We sat at the bar.  

The inside of the restaurant has a great atmosphere and I personally love the decor. It's a combination of wood and stone. There are cool metal sculptures of dogs and some other animals in the place.  

The bartender was awesome.  He made some recommendations regarding the local beer selection. He was more than willing to provide some samples if we were not sure how a particular beer would taste. Based on his recommendations I went with the bad beat beer and was not disappointed.  Obviously beer is personal and what I like, others may not like.  

After what seemed like a short wait, we were escorted to a table. 

Jennifer, the waitress, quickly greeted us and brought some waters for the table.  She was just awesome.  Incredibly friendly and willing to help us in any way possible.  

For an appetizer we ordered the spinach dip and edamame.  Both were excellent but everyone agreed the edamame had a little too much salt.  They were dusted with a spicy run with sesame seeds.  It really gave a nice kick to the edamame but had just a little too much salt.  

For dinner I went with the chipotle chicken.  I was a little concerned that the chipotle part was a chipotle cream.  I asked Jennifer if I could have it on the side.  Her response was the kitchen will make any meal the way I want it.  That impressed me!!  Quite honestly I did not expect that.  I was glad I had it on the side.  For me, it would have been a little too heavy for the dish. I am not into heavy cream sauces on chicken.  

Everyone at the table enjoyed their respective meals.  Everyone agreed the meals had great flavor, were cooked perfectly and everything on the dish had separate flavors and did not taste bland.  

I didn't have any dessert but a lot of people at other tables were eating the butter cake.

From start to finish this place was a disaster. Our ""server"" was so bizarre. When she finally came over to our table she never introduced herself so we never knew her name. She took our drink order then returned about 15 mins later to take our food order by saying ""do you know what you want?""
Never offered specials/recommendations or asked if we had any questions about the menu. 

Long story short, our side salads came out(which was wrong) then 5 mins later our appetizers came out then 1 min later our entrees came out. So basically our burgers were cold by the time we were ready to eat them. 

Our waitress was aware that she was struggling to stay afloat, but kept laughing and joking about it. There was nothing funny about it. 

I would never come back or recommend this place to anyone. There are soooooo many other options to eat in a 1 mile radius. My advice is to avoid this place altogether. Don't say you weren't warned.

The hostess was friendly - I guess she deserves the 2 stars.
Don't get me wrong, I am a dog lover, but my dog is 6.5 lbs and a non-shedder, very well mannered, never makes a sound in public. Does not beg, bark or bite.
With that being said, I took my dog and sat on the patio. She sat under my chair without making a peep. Out of courtesy of others, I would never bring a shedding dog to an outdoor patio. Have some respect - not everyone likes dog hair in their food!!!
I should have expected that with so much advertising as ""dog-friendly"" that the patio floor would be filthy and it was. Clumps of dog hair all over the floor, dog hair flying all thru the air! Gross!!! Their ""dog rules"" clearly states no dogs on chairs or in laps, the lady at the table next to me held her dog in her lap the whole time. Some kind of big dog at another table was licking a soon-to-be occupied table! DISGUSTING FOR THE POOR PEOPLE THAT WAS NEXT FOR THAT TABLE. Dogs are dogs, people please control your dogs, or better yet, leave them at home if they shed, bark, beg or bite!
The waitress/server said, ""I'll bring your dog some water"". I said, ""thank you"". 20 min later, no water. Asked for water, she blamed it on someone else. 
Asked for Parm cheese for my pizza, half way thru my pizza, she brings the cheese.
I ask for a to-go box, waited 15 min - had to ask again.
My dog wouldn't even drink out of their water dish because it had dog hair (not her's) floating around in it.
Please, Lazy Dog - make some rules...... half off a section for dogs and half for no dogs.
i will probably never go back, but if I ever do - I will not bring a dog and will not sit outside on the filthy dog-hair, barking, begging, licking dogs everywhere patio!
Also, with so many dogs shedding and shaking, if you don't get dog hair in your food outside, you are likely to get it in your food inside because the hair is flying around in the air, sticking to the servers clothes, they walk inside, take the dog hair with them! ughhhh, I'm done with my rant!",tR5J6oCwfiikC8AgrAwQOw,2,1,2,oJNFh1RzxMRHRIqMYzZHDg

My party of 4 (3 plus a dog) showed up for lunch at around 11:30am. The hostess saw us from afar once we parked and walked towards us to greet us warmly. This was such a nice gesture. It really made us feel welcome, especially since it was all of our first time coming to the restaurant. We were seated immediately and introduced to put server. I wish I got everyone's name but I was too busy running around making sure Hilo (my dog) was secured appropriately (his leash tied to a chair). The server was very professional, very nice and accommodating. He brought out a water bowl for the dog immediately.

The server brought out a complimentary flat bread for first timers, which was very tasty. We ordered an Poke Bowl, Ahi Tuna Salad, Hawaiian Ribs with fries, Edamame, and a Tuna and Walnut Sandwich. All great choices but my absolute favorite were the ribs! Definitely a must try!!!

Before our meal came out, the manager also introduced himself to us. The staff really goes above and beyond to make sure everyone feels welcomed and it did not go unnoticed and was very much appreciated.

I told him I was leaving and refused to pay for anything and left in disgust. Ten minutes later I decided to call and speak to a manager about the incident. He told me from my understanding that they had tried to spray for roaches early in that day and had their monthly spraying from their exterminator. So then I asked him ""how long has this problem been going on?"" He assured me that they don't have a cockroach problem. I find that hard to believe. What I do believe is they have a roach problem. Either recently or for awhile now and refuse to admit to the issue. He then offered me a $25 gift certificate for my next visit.

Me and my best friend snagged a seat at the bar and were accommodated by the bartender Adam. He was very intelligent, knowledgable, and very accommodating. My water was literally filled right as soon as it was empty. 5/5 service that's for sure.

For their drink prices, they are soooo reasonable and delicious. I tried their Moscow mule (yum), blueberry margarita, cucumber martini, and the sangria sampler. Everything was spot on and perfect. As for our food, it came out so fast and their portions were huge! We ordered off the happy hour menu their hush puppies, ahi, Cajun fries, and cheese quesadilla.

 Today had some errands to run at downtown Summerlin ( returns ) and so we decided to check out one of many restaurants in Downtown Summerlin. Funny thing is out of all the ones we have not tried yet, this was our choice as we have been repeat diners here. Bring your furry friend for outdoor patio seating. 

Happy Hour is where it is! We ordered a plate of Nachos, some Mac N Cheese and i saw ""Fire fried rice"" so i just had to try it. The Nachos are HUGE! Repeat, HUGE. Had we known they were that big, we would not have ordered the other stuff.

 We ended up taking enough leftovers home for a whole other meal. The rice was just as depicted plus it had a nice sunny side up egg sitting right on top!  A little Sriracha and we are off to the races! The Mac n Cheese was awesome as were the Nachos. The rice is a must try!

Well, we decided to save money and just order water but the beer selection was just to tempting not to try. A pale ale for the wife and a Hefewiezen  for yours truly. All of that and we got out for under 27 bucks. 

There are plenty of servers and the service is top notch here. They are on their ""A"" game here. I love the rustic lodge decor depicted. 

As for the story of Lazy Dogs ..... Read Below .... I love Jackson Hole!

Growing up, Chris and his family would vacation in the breathtaking mountains of Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Whether it was skiing in the winter or fishing in the summer, Chris will tell you that even today it is the place he goes when he wants to get away and relax. 

When you are in any one of the Lazy Dog restaurants, you will see how Chris has tried to capture and recreate the feeling he gets when in Jackson Hole. He wants you to feel like you are walking into a place that is the perfect balance of warm and comfortable, yet full of excitement and positive energy. 

For Chris, the lodge represents vacations with family and friends. Jackson Hole is a small town with a true sense of hospitality. Get your car stuck in the snow, and the next person who passes by will stop to help. Most likely, they'll even know your name.

Where did the Lazy Dog name come from? One snowy afternoon, walking back into the lodge after a long morning on the slopes, Chris noticed a dog lying by the toasty fireplace. Commenting to his buddies on how much he loved his time hanging out there, he told them he wished everyone could enjoy life as much as that ""lazy dog' by the fire.

On their last run down the ski slopes in Jackson Hole, everyone has one thing on their mind: get these skis off and head to the lodge. Whether you're sitting by the fire or bellying up to the bar, the servers and bartenders know what you like and treat you like you're one of the family. The lodge has cold beer, hot chocolate, incredible food and great music, making it the place to be in town. 

Just like the lodge in Jackson Hole, the Lazy Dog offers the perfect environment for all ages, making the entire restaurant the place to be for a quick dinner with the family, a meandering meal with friends or a night out on the town.",DAbc7OsqoRwEomJEaBYDuQ,0,0,5,l6Xbt4OVz1hPvrBrVZCXBA

Another tip: the stick ribs are good, but beware. This is more of the Asian style BBQ sauce, not Hawaiian. But, they were still good.

I truly enjoy their outside patio. They have this huge fire pit and if you're sitting next to it, you don't even realize that it might my a cold windy Vegas night- because you're warm by the fire! I absolutely love it. 

Every time I go I have to indulge in their amazing Chicken Tortilla Soup with avocados. They pair it with this cheese pita cracker that really hits the spot! Perfect. I crave this soup and I always order this. My husband likes to get a little bit of everything when we come here- and the flavors are so great!

This place has a nice dining experience in a very easy and relaxing atmosphere. 

They have amazing staff services, our server was super knowledgeable about the menu, and gave us feedbacks and opinions on certain dishes and he was always ready to answer any questions. The only complaint i have was when i was first inside, 2 host didn't realize that i had gotten there first and seated someone else before me because they weren't looking, so tip just make sure you flag them down constantly. But that's the only complaint i have because the rest of the other workers were so sweet and helpful. Clean place (with adorable dog deco) & environment with a beautiful scenery.

Tips: (w. your furry ones) 
-You're not allowed to have your pup on your lap or chair so they must be on the floor 
-Staffs can't pet your dog 
-There's menu options for your pup & waterbowls!
-You can't share with your pup 
-They have to be on leashes

The food was high quality and delicious! I was here for the happy menu this time (for this review purpose only w/ pictures) i got the chicken wings, the carbonara pasta, the sweet potato tator tots, and Banana pudding. The food was so good and comforting!

Chicken Wings: (Happy menu) 5 pieces per order ; juicy chicken wings with bbq and spicy flavor, creamy ranch and celery sticks 

Carbonara pasta: Had bacon, sweet peas, garlic, romano, poached egg, chardonnay cream sauce! (With cheese chips) This was so creamy flavorful, and all the ingredients really balanced out with each other. 

Banana Pudding: It was a HOMEMADE banana pudding, with banana slices, whip creams and vanilla nilla wafers! The pudding had a rich creamy and thick constancy with layers of banana slices and wafers

Sweet potato tator tots: 
Super crispy and sweet, with homemade lime jalapeño aioli

The food has the sort of flavor that keeps wanting to eat more despite how full you are. This is not a trait to take lately people. Flavor is everything. So many restaurants out an emphasis on entrees and forget appetizers. Not here!  These guys make sure all their tummies, are yummy. 

Drinks are generous and they don't skimp on the spirits which is important in this ""increase those margin"" society we live in. Their microbrews are super awesome and I especially dig their IPA. If you are into the IPA's then make your way over to this one cause it's good. I've had people who aren't fans of IPA's tell me how much they like it. Fortunately I'm already a fan and this one moved to my top tier. 

Now let's close with service. Lazy Dog staff are friendly and accommodating. I think they either have a 4-year college degree requirement or they just plain hire intelligent folks. I'm no snob (well maybe a little), but I like a server who understands the world around them. I see this here and it's been consistent. 

So why 4 stars and not 5?  Too new. I need to see this be consistent into the next year.  But I'm pretty certain they'll get it from me. They have the right ingredients to make it happen (pun intended). I'll just keep going there and I know they won't let me down.",5zY__KNZZEll48LU1bAQlg,1,1,4,RRKIrBU-2ptYVJLWzS8duA

BAJA CALIFORNIA BURGER ($10.95): Any burger patty can be substituted with a vegetarian Gardenburger! The burger was huge and messy. So messy in fact, that I had to get all European and eat my burger with a fork and knife. Keeping it classy. Taste wise, the burger was just alright. I wouldn't order a burger again. Thankfully, there's sooo many other veg options to choose from at Lazy Dog! There's a tofu wok dish, Thai noodles with tofu, grilled cheese, and lavash tacos to name a few choices. The vegetarian friendly menu is one of the reasons I bumped my rating up to 4 stars. 3/5  

HAWAIIAN STICKY RIBS ($15.95): Husband really liked the ribs, thought the Asian slaw was meh, and ate every single unami fry on the plate. 4/5

WHITE CHOCOLATE CHIP BROWNIE ($5.95): Presentation was kind of weird (fudge smear looked like a poop smear lol) and it tasted like the boxed brownies I make at home. 2.5/5  

SERVICE: Our waiter was on his a-game. He got us refills without having to ask and was so damn proper! 5/5

VIBE: Pretty crowded and kinda loud. I was confused on the theme. There were paw prints on the table and Americana decor and license plates on the wall. Is it Western? The vibe reminded me of Claim Jumper, but not as hunter-ish. 3/5 

PRO TIP: 10% discount for military! Wooooo

Worth a Return Visit?
The Happy Hour deals seem great, so I'll definitely be back for that! Late Night HH is 9-close Sunday through Thursday at the bar and patio. $3 drafts and plenty of cheap apps too

My friends and I came here this past Sunday for brunch. We had just finished the Breast Cancer Walk so we were pretty tired and hungry. There is a yelp check in offer for cajun fries .. if you're lucky enough to see it pop up on your yelp app. It popped up for one of our friends but the rest of us did not get the offer. However, our server, Gerardo, was nice enough to get two extra orders for us.

The cajun fries were delicious! They were a little on the thicker side -- sort of reminded me of frites. And they were seasoned so well! They also came with a dipping sauce but honestly, you don't really need it. It is definitely a dish worth trying. 

There is a brunch menu for Sundays and it lasts until 2 PM. On the other side of the menu, there are $5 cocktails just for brunch! They have sangria, mimosa, peach bellini, bloody mary, and micheladas. I decided to go for a peach bellini -- I mean, why not?! Peach juice with a small bottle of champagne! It was decent but I have to say that I do prefer the frozen version better. 

As for my meal, I decided to go for their pork fried rice: it has BACON, pork sausage, carrots, peas, and cabbage with an omelette on top. It was a HUGE portion and I definitely didn't finish it. I had to take it home. Unfortunately, I did not really notice much pork sausage in the fried rice but there was definitely bacon. It went quite well with the rice. The rice itself was kind of dry so it was kind of hard. The dish also needed more flavor...the bacon could only do so much. It also looked two-toned. The dish wasn't really prepared that well -- I think they used soy sauce but they didn't use enough to cover the whole dish .. either that or they just poured soy sauce into it but did not bother to mix it. The omelette on top? Ugh. Overcooked and looked like it was prepared in a microwave. I prefer my egg to be mixed in with my fried rice. 

I think if they used enough soy sauce, used some ham (or maybe even spam) with the bacon, mixed the egg into the fried rice, add some green onions, add in sesame oil, and some garlic bits ...it would have turned out better. Oh and better rice ... they might have used rice that was too old. 

Overall, I think their service is fantastic. Our server was nothing but helpful and was definitely on top of everything. As for the food, I was not that impressed with my dish so honestly, it's not really the type of place that I'd rush to come back to.",oqTZC9WriodTCby6jl0LfQ,1,1,3,ijU1tNz985KiG12ltJEsCw

Upon arrival, I observed a large number of large families and groups. We were seated in booth right across from the large groups which made the environment loud. The service was okay. The fiancé ordered a cocktail and our server came back with the incorrect drink. The service is what heavily reflected on this rating. Took awhile to have my water refilled, fiancés drink was never corrected and took an extended bit of time to receive our food. As for the food it lacked flavor. I choose a burger as I believed was impossible to mess up a burger. However, they managed to prove me wrong. The burger was dry, lacked flavor and was not filling. The dish wasn't presented well either, granted it's a burger, but presentation aside the food was lacking. 

I highly doubt I will return here as I was not impressed. The restaurant had plenty of parking and was located on the northwest end of downtown summerlin. They were adding more stores near by (which have been completed by now at the time of this review) so that may affect the availability of parking if you choose to come early.

The last time I'd been there, dogs were allowed on half the patio & the patrons w/out dogs on the other half.  Not the case now.  Five women showed up with a poodle & 2 guys with an Airedale.  The noise level, due to a barking dog on the other side, Crate & Barrel construction that abuts the restaurant, & the garbage on the stereo were over the top for an afternoon lunch outdoors.  But we just had to be outside on this beautiful day.

Our server appeared shortly and we ordered 2 salads:  chicken/sundried tomato/feta, and the new strawberry w/goat cheese, both of us requesting dressing on the side.  Though the restaurant had few patrons, the food took way too long to appear.  When the salads arrived, I added creamy balsamic to mine & soon discovered the chef had already added dressing, so I had a bowl of dressing.  But that wasn't all... each cherry tomato was old & squishy, there was a small sliver of cheese, a few gushy strawberries, and for some reason they had little gobs of crunchy cereal throughout.  And this was whose idea?  My friend said her salad was okay, but it came with the lettuce shredded which restaurants seem to think is so cool these days.

A pet peeve of mine that leaves me frustrated & curious is why servers don't seem to be trained on seating arrangements (assuming there are enough other alternatives)...  i.e. if 2 seniors arrive, why would you seat them next to whiney children?  Or:  why would you seat two diners next to a table of 5 cackling women with a dog?  Or next to the kitchen, or in winter next to the outside door?  Know what I mean?

I soon realized that the great manager Phil has been gone for a few months, explaining why this trip (as well as the last) left a lot to be desired.

I signed up for their club and got a coupon for my birthday which is 2 days after our dogs birthday so we went to do a double celebration dinner for both of us.
There were a few other dogs there when we arrived, when the hostess went to seat us 2 of the big dogs there barked and snapped at our dog who is not aggressive. So we asked to sit away from them in a nice quiet corner. They obviously don't enforce the ""rules"" they advertise because the group with the two mean dogs stayed about an half hour longer. 
Staff was great, they loved our dog but unfortunately can't pet him because of food service rules. They gave him a bowl of water and we ordered him the Chicken and Brown Rice off the doggie menu. It was very rice heavy so he dug out all the chicken and left most of the rice behind. Lol!
We started with the Chicken Lettuce Wraps, not as good as PF Changs but tasty nonetheless. I ordered the Fish and Chips which was pretty meh, I wouldn't get it again. Doug got the Grilled Cheese and a bowl of the seasonal soup (Sausage, mushroom and brown rice). It was tasty. We got a beer flight of Lazy Dog beers to sample along the way, not bad.
For dessert (ha ha) I got an Asian Pear Martini...yum! I would definitely get it again! Doug tried the Coconut Mojito, it was a waste of liquor, thumbs down.

The chicken palbano is slighty spicy, both times ( I had it last time, mother in law had it this time) there was just enough heat, spice and ratio of peppers to chicken. 

The burger was huge cooked just a little to long and was just a tad on dry side for medium cook, lots of blue cheese, fries could have been fresher. 

I had chicken tortilia soup, very cheesy and big chunks of chicken, moist and tender shreds, served with wedge of flat bread, pretty good! And I had the warm chicken Focaccia sandwich, moist chicken, plenty and stacked with lettus and tomato. 

For apps we had sweet potato tatter tots with a yummy dipping sauce lime cilanto and roasted brussel sprouts with capers and bread crumble, both good size and very good.

Everyone in our party of seven was satisfied with their food and we had an enjoyable meal. The casual atmosphere allowed everyone to relax and the large menu provided something to the liking for everyone in the group.

Arriving at 6:30 on Saturday night, we were first quoted a 45 minute wait. But when we denied the offer to wait, the hostess stopped us and offered us the long community table in the bar, which we accepted. Even though we were seated in chairs without back support we had plenty of elbow room. Service throughout the meal was excellent and they tackled our party without issue during a very busy dinner. Our server was quite friendly guiding us through the menu and the kitchen was efficient and there were no significant waits for anything.

The restaurant with the Rocky Mountain lodge decor and atmosphere has a large menu covering almost every cuisine. There was something for everyone in the group. I had the sticky ribs which were flash fried baby backs brushed with a molasses barbecue sauce. Your primary concern is that they ""flash"" fry the ribs opposed to deep frying them into leather. They did a good job as the ribs were fried perfectly with a crunchy outside and with moist, tender meat on the inside. I don't know if umami is an accurate descriptor of the fries, but they were still delicious. The portion did not completely fill me and I had plenty of room for dessert.

Also ordered were the chicken chile verde nachos, fettucine alfredo with chicken, chicken parmesan, house club, ginger soy salmon, carbonara, and the sesame crusted ahi. For dessert, the salted caramel creme brulee, butter cake,and white chocolate chip brownie. The nachos were full of toppings and did not last long on the table. The pasta weren't anything special, but sufficient for my daughter and her friend. The butter cake and brownie were absolutely devoured. I would recommend those two for sure if you have room. After we finished, the $$ price point for the entire meal was completely accurate.

Lazy Dog does a lot of things with their menu, but nothing is really outstanding. We did like the atmosphere and the family got to spend quality time together. Because the menu is so large, I wouldn't give up on them if you don't find something your first time around. Happy hour might be an ideal time to sample the menu because they offer a wide variety of food and drinks at very reasonable prices.

Now to the food.... It was all so good. We got the potato hush puppies, ahi poke, calamari, the snake river salad, and the peach crumble. I know we're fatties. Everything was on point and so delicious. I will for sure be coming again for those items and can't wait to try other ones.

5464783,2018-06-03,0,0_aeYE2-VbsZts_UpILgDw,"So on Friday, after doing some Ikea shopping with some of the besties, we were driving by downtown Summerlin shopping and wanted some grub, after some back and forth, we decided on Lazy Dog's. Since this was my first time here, I wanted to share my thoughts based on my experience

What I liked - The building is a stand alone on the North side of Downtown Summerlin mall complex with ample parking, thou the area was busy, we still had no problem finding a spot. As you walk in, the decor is pretty cool with 2 sculptures made from tools and locks in the form. Thou we didn't have any fur babies with us, we ate outside and the honestly the outdoor seating was really huge with a massive fire pit in the middle (thou not on).  Thou very busy, I felt our wait staff did an excellent job ensuring we were well taken care of.  It was also cool talking with everyone about their puppies and letting us pet them while we chatted. I really appreciated the design as outdoor seating is contained so no dogs can get out.

opportunities - The only thing keeping this from the convented 5 STAR RATING was the food quality. Myself, I got the fish and chips, OK, I know fish and chips is more of a coastal thing, but if I see fish and chips, I try it. I felt like the fish was just meh and was dry, took a lot of tarter sauce. My friends 6 year old got the kids Mac and cheese and it looked and tasted like something from a dollar box of Mac and cheese. On a positive note, the sweet tater tots were pretty good. 

In conclusion, cool place to hang out and puppy watch, not sure if the restaurant is known for a special dish so let me know if there are any recommendations, but unless I'm out with my puppy, don't think I need to go back",nPDFmoDt6hKkb7TbDHLGVQ,0,0,4,Z6kYUavM_ZJI6TsbgJ-G5Q

5502828,2015-12-27,0,0_aeYE2-VbsZts_UpILgDw,"My husband and I along with our daughter and grandson ate at the Downtown Summerlin location of TheLazy Dog this past week. I usually enjoy leaving positive reviews because I believe too often, people share anything that is bad and usually not the good. But, unfortunately we had an awful experience at the location. I ordered the turkey with cranberry salad sandwich. It had very little flavor.  My husband ordered shrimp tacos and honestly there had to be half a head of lettuce left over after eating the tacos. He said all he could really taste was the lettuce. My daughter ordered a pizza and had to wait over 20 minutes for a waitress to return so we could ask for red pepper flakes. Granted, this was 12/23  and the place was busy with holiday shoppers, but that doesn't excuse waiting 15 minutes just to turn in drink orders. Then we waited again to turn in food orders. Once food was delivered, we did not see our server,Isabel, again for at least 45 minutes, we only saw her because we snagged another employee to please pass a message that we needed more drinks since we'd been out for over a half hour by now.  Being without a drink for 30 minutes is no easy task when faced with a flavorless turkey sandwich and a head of chopped lettuce. I loved the atmosphere in their restaurant and although I though the staff was friendly, I won't be returning. My husband and I make it a habit of leaving 25% minimum tip but in this case, Isabel only received a 4.00 tip on a 50 something dollar tab. I figured I should tip because we did get our drinks and the correct food thaws ordered.  The fact that we didn't enjoy the dishes is not her fault but that if the cook.

Have been to another Lucky Dog in California and I like this one better, probably cause it's newer.  Very pleasant upbeat atmosphere with 80s music playing in the background.

We didn't order any cocktails, however, really like the layout of their bar and have a great selection of beers on tap.  Also, appreciate the nod to local Vegas brewery Banger as they have their Jalapeno Hefe on tap.  Try it, it's really good. 

So we ordered the boneless wings which were served on blue cheese slaw; really crunchy outside with tender chicken inside. Yum.  Just wish there was more slaw. The sweet potato tots were another bite of deliciousness with a zesty dipping sauce. Mmm.  Just note that some of the portions on happy hour are smaller compared to normal apps.  Didn't order any this time, but have tried the edamame before; really great with the spicy Asian flair. 

My only complaint was my water glass was empty for 10 minutes; but had a nice time and  I look forward to coming back.",jx7w1ztxqpRrA7pBoOfu6w,1,0,4,VlQR31V0hkoIU3dVnIMoNA

I've been here multiple times. From when they first opened to recently. They've definitely improved on everything service-wise! 

Eating with a pup:
We took our dog here for her birthday. They have you sit outside in their patio area. If you have a more rowdy dog, I don't recommend going during their peak hours. We came on a weekday afternoon, and were able to find a table far enough away from all the other pups. They give your dog a water bowl just as your table gets glasses of water. We ordered her the chicken and rice bowl. Great portion size because she's a fairly small dog. She loved it! Nearly finished it. 
The waitress was friendly and all was dandy. 

Happy Hour:
One of my favorites in the summerlin area. Delicious sangria! (Order by the pitcher for $15!) the chipotle fries are great for the price. All of their snacks are yummy and affordable. Happy hour is in bar area or patio during specific times ONLY so keep that in mind! 

Inside dining:
This is why the review has 4 stars. Eating dinner here is nothing more than eating at an expensive Applebees. The food is alright, but nothing memorable. Service is fantastic, though!",-IM1qwYck6nqKizjCzR_ww,1,0,4,f2EcPRvwr7xTwYu-uH4-GA

We went to Lazy Dog for the first time yesterday and we were amazed. When we first arrived the hostess was pleasant and guided us to our booth. Immediately after seating, we were greeted by our waiter named Oscar. Oscar was very attentive to our needs, gave us a few suggestions after we had asked him for some and answered any questions we had about their plates. He even offered us healthier alternatives that were listed on the rear of the menu (probably since were were dressed in athletic gear).

As we were trying to decide what to try, the restaurant manager surprisingly brought us flat bread (pictured) to try for it being our first time at Lazy Dog. The Flat bread was great in taste which we decided to save a portion of to eat with our entree. 

After deciding what to order, we went with the Sweet Potato Tater Tots and Bahama Chicken (both pictured). The Tater Tots were positively delicious and the Bahama Chicken was great. The Bahama Chicken is described as a Jerk Chicken which normally has a kick (spice) to it but this plate had a ever so slight kick.

Oscar also informed us of the Cajun Fries (pictured) that are free if you were to place a Yelp Review for the restaurant, which we completed. The Cajun Fries were delicious and were a relatively large portion.  We would definitely order these again.

Throughout our experience, the manager visited our table twice. Once to deliver the Flat Bread and second to inquire how everything was turning out. Oscar was also very attentive to our tables needs and didn't let our waters run dry (I must add that I drink tons of water).

Overall, we felt that our experience went very well for our first time at the Lazy Dog. There was not a wait at all (we arrived around 1pm) and upon us leaving, the restaurant was getting a good flow of guests. The work staff seemed to be very pleasant and happy to be there, especially the restaurant manager (whose name I forgot, sorry if you're reading this) and Oscar our waiter. The dishes were excellent in taste and reasonably affordable. Their menu had a great deal of selections although slightly wordy making the menu a little intimidating.

They even have doggy items on the menu just for your pupper. Although dog friendly, it's not overly crazy as they have a good set of rules for our four legged compadres. 

Aside from the great atmosphere and friendly staff, they have the best edamame in all the land. I've never been a huge 'mam fan till I moved here but I'm hooked. Hummus ain't bad either. Happy hour menu is great and they have one of the best beer offerings in town.

There is a great bartender there that looks like Wolverine; he told me I'd be back often after the first time I was there, and well, Hugh Jackman wasn't wrong. This place rocks.",eXAfCH1gHkASm4eJF0v_xw,0,0,5,9ulsgszjNe450XsjIRHz5Q

5667397,2015-09-20,1,0_aeYE2-VbsZts_UpILgDw,"I have been three times now, and I feel like this place is really suffering from inconsistent service and food.

We have always come for late night Happy Hour, never had to wait, and have sat on the Patio which is great. We have had a really great waitress, an ok waitress and a really odd waitress. The last one was the really odd one and she was very flighty, couldn't seem to follow what we wanted and just not all together there.

This last time I ordered a drink I have had each time, a sparkling Strawberry Margarita, and while it was great both times before, this time it arrived completely flat. I tried to drink it but it was gross so I asked if they could remake it, they did, this time it was fizzy but I am pretty sure it had zero booze in it. Very disappointing. I gave up and got the house Hef, which was just ok. 

Things we have gotten:

Late night burger: Comes with different things on it each time. Last time husband said no mayonnaise or sauce, comes with sauce, had to send it back, waitress insisted it was the wrong burger and husband says that the girl that delivered it said it was the late night burger, waitress comments ""well we don't hire them for their brains""......that was rather shocking.

Hummus Trio: Hummus is good, cucumber has ranged from good to soft and floppy, bread has ranged from great to terrible

Mashed potato bites: Have been good each time, but the heat of the sauce has varied a lot

Buffalo chicken bites: Horrific....weird rubber texture

Canjun Fries: Yummy

Edamame: Yummy



So, after last time, which was the worst visit so far, I have no idea when/if we will be back. So far the nice patio has been the only consistent thing about our visits and frankly if sitting outside is the best part of your dining experience, then something is wrong with the place.",YJNVwDdzwjwhptzh9y2vBg,2,1,3,qyX1RnZOx5ESQDF1JnsQyg

5688139,2015-06-10,7,0_aeYE2-VbsZts_UpILgDw,"So I come here to try their Home Cooked food and surprisingly I didn't feel like vomiting  I ordered the Chicken Tortilla soup  and I was pleasantly surprised.  It was actually really good. Good chunks of chicken breast the avocado was firm yet supple to the bite and the broth was a good clear consistency filled with bites of Tomato , cheddar cheese and tortilla strips. So I ordered the fish and chips and instead of fries I got mashed potatoes because nothing says home cooking like homemade mashed taters.  And this creamy Apple vinegar coleslaw was surprisingly delish! Creamy in all the right places without being overbearing it sweet. The acid of the vinegar balanced it all out and kept each bite as pleasant as the next.  My friend ordered the chicken pot pie and next to my own it was also a surprise. A huge round helping of pot pie perfectly built so all bites keep a good amount of edible warmth. I had to have two bites ! I got the loaded hush puppies but it was too much mashed potatoes not enough puppy for me. It's a bit misleading because there is no bread like texture however that's my error for not reading thoroughly enough.  It was too much potatoes on potatoes.  So dinner was not a disaster lastly we ordered the Butter Cake ! House made butter cake topped with a minted strawberry compote & vanilla bean ice cream garnished with sweet balsamic.  Ok so the butter cake and ice cream are to die for. Now me coming from the land of derby I'm picky with where mint intermingles with other organic natures.  The strawberry mint compote was a tad overwhelming.  The balsamic seemed pointless I can see they wanted it to cut through the richness of the cake and ice cream however it clashes.  A strawberry lemon compote with a different component would have been nicer however we still destructed the whole thing. When I first walked in I was angered they seated us and for 5-7 minutes no one came to get us drinks.  I explained to our server Sarah that I was pretty upset and throughout the whole dinner she was pretty, pleasant and polite. Her demeanor totally helped calm me down and helped me to better enjoy my meal. She truly cares about her customers and it shows!   She is definitely the kind geared towards management.  Thanks Sarah! I'll ask for your every time I come back and we will be back! How can we not have our friends try the goodies you have to offer :)  Everyone Ask for Sarah she's amazing!

Richard took me hiking again at Red Rock. I like it there. All that hiking made me hungry and extra thirsty. When we passed by Lazy Dog, I told him to stop XP

We didn't go inside - dogs like me can't go in. But there's a big outdoor area with TVs, fireside seating, and lots of other dogs! So many dogs today, I thought I was at the dog park. [WOOF]. The table next to ours, there was another cool dog and his name was Champ too!

Richard told me there are rules: (1) I can't sit on his lap or the table (I'm too big anyway), (2) no begging, barking, or biting; no problem, (3) I can't eat from his plate (I'll get my own), and (5) he has to keep me on the leash always.  OK! :)

Our kind server brought water and I drank it up. There was chicken on the dog menu, but I wanted hamburger. I even got to choose how it cooks.  [DROOL]. I went with medium. Even comes with choice of white or brown rice - I'm a brown dog so I chose brown rice.

The menu is pretty extensive and covers a wide variety of cuisine-types. My girlfriend and I both ordered off the lunch menu. I had the spicy garlic chicken noodle bowl and she had a personal pizza and salad. Everything was great.

They carry beers from the Pub at Goldenroad out of LA which is a big plus for us.

Once seated our server was very nice and took care of us well during our meal. The menu isn't as extensive as BJ's but that's not a bad thing either. One can get lost in a large menu and personally I like one smaller and hits all the points which Lazy Dogs does. The Ahi Poke severed on 4 crispy fried wontons was an excellent starter. Our main dishes were the Pot Roast French Dip, which was outstanding. I never thought to take moms pot roast and making a French dip out of it. So much better than thinly sliced beef. And the aujus, superb, it tasted like it was made from the Pot Roast itself and not some watered down beef boulon. Second dish was the hand formed Turkey Burger with avocado. Sorry, I love a good turkey burger and this version was good, not great but good. The Sweet Potato Tots on the other hand were some of the best I've ever had anywhere and I'd take them over a stack of fries any day.

5841402,2016-02-25,0,0_aeYE2-VbsZts_UpILgDw,"My first and most likely only experience at this place is only a 3 star because of the manager saving the day. I will break it down here:

Arrived and it was pretty busy, noticed small table in the bar area and was told we could take it, PERFECT, no wait. Our waiter was on us right away, drinks ordered quickly and then it all fell apart. We weren't ready to order, so we asked for a couple more minutes. After about 15 minutes I finally asked my wife if she had seen our waiter, he was completely gone. I don't know if he had a smoke break or was helping in the main dining area but we was gone. We asked another employee if we could order and he said yes and disappeared, I assume to find our waiter.

Twenty minutes, we finally order, and a water re-fill. Then it's another waiting game, food took another 25-30 minutes and no check in from the waiter. We track down our waiter to inquire about our food and he says he will check. He shows up a couple minutes later, ""Just Finished"" he says, we begin to eat our food. COLD! At this point I had had it, I didn't care, we had been there for over an hour I knew we wouldn't see our waiter again, empty water glass, so we ate.

30 Minutes for two cold sandwiches. Grilled Cheese and Pot Roast Dip. Grilled Cheese was nothing special, my wife said it was okay. The Pot Roast Dip had very little meat and the onions were super sweet. The bread was good but overpowered all the other flavors, except the sweet onions. I told the waiter it was cold when he finally did come to see us, his reply ""I wish you would have told me I could have done something about that."" How can I tell you when we only see you every 25 minutes?

This was a one star experience but it turns out the waiter did let his manager know the food was cold, so I guess he did do something. I'm sure he didn't mention that my food sat in the window and this is the only reason why the french fries were cold and the sandwich lukewarm at best. The manager did apologize covered the cost of my sandwich and comped a free desert. I appreciate the manager quickly coming to us and apologizing more than the comped food, but I appreciate that gesture as well. 

Overall poor experience: Poor food, poor service, but nice manager. I liked the waiter when he was with us, I just wish he checked in on us more.",LDfurrtj2C3hygYEt2a9WA,0,0,3,8o1eHtE2eID8san2Wf4VWw

If you like the food here, you literally have no taste and should live off of grocery store dog food.

The tortilla soup is a must have.

I got the chicken Parmesan, pretty tasty. The first time I ordered with white sauce but I didn't like it so I sent it back for the regular tomato sauce. The waiter didn't mind this at all and he was super nice about it. Creme brulee for dessert, also delicious. The drinks are an interesting, flavorful and delicious mixture.

The Poke was a little different than your normal poke flavor. They pickle Cucumbers and radishes and serve it in a mason jar with a side of the wonton ""chips"". The house brews were really good as well. This place is perfect for just sitting at the bar or getting a table and taking the family.

She has been raving about it since we left. I, however, had a different experience. We ate outside and didn't bring dogs and it was nice watching everyone else with their dogs there. The service was great as well. I ordered a Wild Blueberry with Lemmon cocktail and sent it back. Normally I make due with the choices I make but this drink was all syrup and overwhelmingly sweet. I had the other people at my table taste it to make sure I wasn't being too particular and they agreed it was bad. The waitress was great in taking in back and getting me a different drink. I didn't ask but she removed it from the receipt as well. Second cocktail, a greyhound variety, much much better. I ordered the cheesy eggs and avocado toast with hashbrowns. When my plate arrived I was both perplexed and pleased. The toast looked amazing, the eggs ok, but the hashbrown was a balled up fist of the shredded potatoes thrown in the deep fryer. I took the first bite of the toast and it was great. The bread was slightly charred on top and it was chewy and crunchy. That was the last good taste. The second bite clued me in to the salt crust. The bottom of the toast had a salt crust on the entire bottom of it. I tried to scrape it off to salvage it but it didn't make much difference. The eggs were runny and an immediate turn off. I will not come here again nor will I recommend it to anyone. The dog feature it neat, that is all.",FfbI9vkkQWBOZfww6_nuOQ,0,0,2,AP5afnxfD-jS0M6G6N35VQ

The husband and I were shopping at Downtown Summerlin on Mother's Day, and although we figured this place would be crowded, we decided to walk here and find out how long the wait was. 45-55 minutes. No thank you. Came back a week later and as we were parking, I was afraid the wait would be long again. The parking lot was packed for some reason and a lot of people were waiting outside. But I guess people were just hanging out. We walked in and hostess seated us at a booth right away. 

Our server was attentive, but I didn't feel like he was too friendly. A manager also stopped by our table to ask how everything was going. The food was delicious! I ordered the Hawaiian Sticky Ribs, which was cooked perfectly and I loved the generous amount of sauce that was on it. Juicy and full of flavor to the bone! Honestly, I don't like to order ribs too often because most places never prepare them right. It annoys me when they are dry and barely have sauce on them. It also came with Umami Fries, which had a kick to it, but it was good. I could have done without the asian slaw on the plate, which was really soggy and bland. My husband ordered the Country Chicken and Biscuit, which is part of their weekend brunch menu. I didn't try it, but he said that it was one of the best chicken and biscuit dishes that he had. We didn't leave any room for dessert, but definitely next time because the Butter Cake does look good!

I would like to come back again to try different dishes. I like the wide variety of food that they have to offer. Also think its cool that you can bring your dogs to dine with you on the patio, along with a dog menu!",FOoN3DJzDUnl4EAQaTJIGg,6,6,4,0hqbhSLPgIGftGaQ2hOQvw

I must have sat at the bar for 10 minutes before the bartender greeted me. Didn't catch her name but she was an Asian female. I asked her for a food & drink menu and she never bothered to come back over and take my order. Ridiculous. So I moved to a table hoping to get some service. My friends came, went spend about  $200 on food and drinks between the 4 of us. The food was blah (nachos, hummus, etc)... the drinks were waaaay watered down (we tried several different ones on the menu). Our waitress was ok, nothing special, nothing memorable. I just think there's so many other good places to go in this area with better food and service.  Big disappointment :(.",bvPS4vrfiO7ZZ4KAo8KBTw,0,0,2,nwVilc3F2vUbUPYpZG-FPg

The server (Fin) was quick to greet us and very pleasant. My 11 year old son was with me and somehow started talking to one of the bartenders (Drea). He's totally a ladies man so I shouldn't be surprised!! Haha!  She came from behind the bar and was chatting it up with him. She totally entertained him and I thought it was pretty cool. She went out of her way to make sure he had a good time. And it wasn't for the tip, she wasn't even our server. Fin was great too. She explained everything we asked about on the menu and was patient with us when we couldn't decide. (The menu has SO much to choose from!). The food was out quickly and I had the grilled cheese (maybe the best ever) with Cajun fries (so yummy). My son had chicken fingers. He said they were delicious and they looked like they had been freshly breaded. The manager (I didn't get her name, taller with dark, curly hair) checked on us twice as well. 
Bottom line. Food is great. Kitchen was fast and they really ""get"" great customer service. We'll be back for sure. Next time we'll bring the fur babies and try the patio!!",0CTYn9z1R8oLjCTqUsvzlQ,0,0,5,vHSmbwEXiLEjeOCdvoC6NQ

I came with a group of coworkers for lunch and despite making a reservation well in advance they had nothing prepared for us so we were left to wait for the table to be set up which took about 15 minutes. We had a limited time for lunch so we were nervous about this slow start. 

Finally seated slow service plagued the meal. Our server was nice but given that they assigned her our entire table of twelve along with a few surrounding tables. A little too much for her to handle so although we understood she was trying her best we needed to address the issue and hopefully get some help to expedite our meal. After speaking with the manager we noticed many more servers and bussers helping out with refills and bringing out the food. This should have happened before we asked but we appreciated the effort.
