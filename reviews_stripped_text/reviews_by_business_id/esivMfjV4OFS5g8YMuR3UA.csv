I started with the ceaser salad that had homemade croutons, Frito Misto (crispy shrimp and vegetables- that came with an aioli sauce and pomodoro sauce), meatballs, and focaccia di recco that was stuffed with ricotta, all of my appetizers were so good I can not choose which I liked the best. Second course I had a spicy pepperoni pizza that was drizzled with honey, soooo freaking yummy! Then I tried four types of pasta; the fettuccine with ragu, agnolotti, cacio e Pepe, and the linguine with clams. All of the pasta was amazing but my favorite was the agnolotti, soo rich and creamy!!! For dessert I had the lemon ricotta cheese cake and the olive oil cake- both were amazing but that olive oil cake was the most moist and delicious cake I've tried! To top it off the manager and a chef came to ask how everything was. I would definitely recommend eating here.",iOnWjmxEW1qzGodLfZ-YDw,0,0,5,L2lblfqDWyjCnrlse8cCCg
1170502,2018-03-19,0,esivMfjV4OFS5g8YMuR3UA,We decided to eat here before a show at the Mirage. As a result we were early by LV standards. We had the Linguine with Clam and the breaded veal chop. The veal was very bland and really needed a sauce. The food was well prepared but not outstanding. The service was almost intrusive. The waitstaff and bus people literally hovered over our table. I understand that this is a relatively new restaurant and just probably needs to work the kinks out. Overall I would recommend it as long as you expect pleasant but not exceptional food.,J6C072-HFrU44AwE75WW8Q,0,0,3,mfQvpYdkiR3Wc-mOdhKIUg

It was all delicious and the server, Christina, was a delight.   But I'm going to focus on one thing:   The croutons on the Caesar salad.   OMG.   If I could just order a side of those, and maybe have it FedEx'd to me on a daily basis, I'd change my will to include the kitchen genius who came up with a tasty, buttery crouton that does not threaten dental work.   Those gems melt in the mouth.   Anyway, this place is a great option for dining on the Strip.

1536972,2018-03-07,0,esivMfjV4OFS5g8YMuR3UA,"We decided to try this new Italian restaurant in the Mirage when the hankering for pasta hit us. There was a little blip when we arrived since we (six of us) did not have reservations, but the estimated wait time of 2 hours was quickly and mysteriously reduced to immediate seating (only a little more than half the restaurant was occupied)-so I am not sure what warranted that but I'm not complaining.The decor and the staff were dressed in theme, and all the wait staff was very knowledgeable about the food and drink menu. 

The menu itself was varied, and had some great options for starters, pasta, and pizzas. We started with a few various salads and the calamari. Calamari and Caser I would recommend, the salad with the arugula was a pass- drenched in dressing with soggy greens. Perhaps ordering dressing on the side would be my suggestion. The 3 pasta dishes we tried were fine, but nothing that would leave me rushing back anytime soon. 

I appreciate the effort the reach for authenticity in their cuisine  but was not overly excited about the choices on the menu that we made.Overall, I would say this was an OK meal in Vegas, with so many choices on the strip I would not hurry back. Our bill with drinks for 6 people was around $300+.",EMMKdK1cGrLSo08wgSYHJQ,3,2,3,KkpMpmLL7e2HJhiobHn_Dw

I decided to sit at the bar and was pleasantly greeted by Anthony my bartender/server for the evening. I asked for his recommendations for a cocktail and he suggested the 'Orange' which has a mixture of ingredients including cardamom!! It is a must try. I also had the Contessa which is all the feel goods you're looking for especially if you like Bombay gin!! As far as the food I died and went to heaven! Chef Michael LaPlaca and his team do an amazing job with the Meatballs infused and served with fresh ricotta on the side. After consuming the first bite I knew it was game over. Hands down the tastiest and mouthwatering meatballs I've ever had!! After recovering from the Meatballs I also had the pleasure of trying the Fritto Misto made with crispy shrimp accompanied with thinly sliced zucchini and Fresno chili peppers topped with lemon. Let me tell you!! The shrimp was cooked superbly and perfectly seasoned. I am pretty picky about how my fritto misto is prepared and this one at Osteria Costa is a MUST TRY!! Lastly, I tried the Tiramisu and have no regrets!! The harmonious combination of marscapone, cocoa, and coffee left me so content. My overall experience was so enjoyable and pleasant I'm coming back twice in one week with my girlfriends and telling all my friends and family to make a stop here at Osteria Costa while in town.",154yADsdXX8RtSjkmA7qDQ,2,0,5,kGDSDMhKj2NoRqBs7Bds0g

(As an aside, we used to love Lupo at Mandalay Bay but they changed up the menu and everything is ala carte.  We would order the Chicken Piccata which would come with pasta.  Not anymore.  Not worth the price.  Plus the service is SO slow.)  Back to Osteria Costa.  Service was wonderful.  Water, bread and olive oil for dipping was immediately brought to the table.  We ordered a bottle of Emeritus, Hallberg Ranch; a wonderful Pinot Noir from Sonoma and a Sgroppino cocktail.  Our waiter (I'm sorry I don't remember your name), explained the menu in detail.  Now I know we can all read a menu but having someone tell you about the dishes and ingredients is very helpful. Our party of 4 decided to try a little of everything.  We shared a Caesar salad with THE  best homemade croutons.  I will say, there was a tad too much dressing for me.  It was delicious but a little too much.
Altogether we ordered the Margherita Pizza, Fettuccini, Vitello Milanese Veal Chop, and Bucatini Cacio E Pepe along with a side of short pasta with an amazing red sauce.  The food was delivered in a timely manner and was hot and oh so tasty.  We loved everything.  When our waiter asked if we saved room for dessert, we said absolutely not.  Until he went through the dessert menu.  From his description alone, we decided to force ourselves to try the Olive Oil cake and again, we were amazed at the moistness and flavor.  Topped with whipped cream with dribbles of smooth olive oil, we devoured it.  Now, we really were done.  
All of the above for a party of 4, with excellent service was $260.  
Bravo.  We will be back.",ocsPC9FDGl9lNDOP_wsL5w,0,1,5,XVKgHxe6IeiXvR_m2LYvHw

I find a lot of Vegas restaurants try a little too hard, but this was wonderfully understated and classy, with a focus on really good food. We had the meatballs & buratta to start, both were excellent, but I would pick the buratta again if I had to pick one. 

We shared the beet salad (delicious pesto!) and linguine with clams. I want to figure out how to make the linguine sauce at home it was that good. 

Vern did a great job of guiding me to a wine I loved (the Nero D'avolo) and even figured out where the tea was from for my husband. 

We finished with tiramisu and doppio con pannas & they surprised us with their rum cake to celebrate our anniversary. The best meal of our vacation. I'll definitely be sure to come back next time I'm in Vegas. 

Bonus: the decor & tablewares are perfect for the style of restaurant. Everything exudes a cool, relaxed, costal Italian atmosphere that makes you forget you're in Vegas.",ojMDhTbaxUZHa_1NqWi3ig,0,1,5,MOzD5cT0ChX2x1nuv0Z3ng

So far, this theory has held up and Osteria Costa proved it once again. The two hostesses were miserable. They didn't smile, they didn't make eye contact and they displayed a bad attitude. We asked for menus and their body language screamed of snobbery. When we decided the menu looked appetizing, one of the hostesses grumbled, ""Um, do you have a reservation?"" 

No.

""You can sit at the bar then."" She looked down and pointed at the bar. Obviously we were chopped liver.

We sat. The waitress walked by us several times. No one said diddly to us. 

That's when we left. We apparently weren't worthy to eat here.

We started off with the Misti salad, meatballs and Fritto Misto. The fritto misto was excellent - with shrimp (no calamari), thin sliced zucchini and peppers. Meatballs were served with ricotta cheese and toasted bread - also very good.

The highlight of our meal was the Bucatini Cacio e Pepe, which was bucatini pasta in a light cheese sauce, with cracked black pepper. Perfectly cooked, the sauce wasn't too heavy and the pepper added just the right flavor.

We ended with the olive oil cake, which had a hint of citrus and was served with fresh whipped cream. I've had olive oil cake at other places before and did not like it, until I tried this one.

However, this is a new avenue for this hotel and trending towards lighter and brighter and upscale but not pretentious Italian food.  Not sure why it's called Costal Italian but it is.

We were seated promptly but had used Open Table to make a reservation which I recommend.  As always in Vegas you are offered their filtered water or bottled.  I see nothing wrong with filtered.  They have a good menu of starters to share as well as salads, pizza, pasta which is house made and entrees.  the server was very knowledgeable and told us about the menu and then added that there were two kitchens, one for entrees, and the other for pizza and pasta so things might come out at different times.  Good to know

We each ordered a salad, huge, and we could have ordered one and split it.  As it was I only ate about half of mine.  Nice vinegrette, too much grated cheese and primarily lettuce with a couple of tomato pieces tossed in.  Hubs had a Caesar which he said was ok.

For entrees I had sea bass which was cooked perfectly and it was the entire fish and of course I could only eat about half.  I ordered a side which was an eggplant something or other and not very good.  Hubs had lasagna which he said was really good but huge portion and he couldn't finish it.  We didn't try any desserts absolutely no room.  I had wine, he had beer and the bill was just a bit over $100.  Not too bad for a hotel in Vegas",1HvVTMBEs8ZArJ62IGMbCw,0,0,4,CbWW_GbN6dLAX8o1p_OE-A

I was lucky to get a seat at the pizza bar, as all tables in the restaurant were apparently spoken for through reservations. This place is advertised as a rustic, casual reprieve, but it felt a little more upscale to me and I definitely felt out of place with my tourist shopping bags, yoga leggings, and sandals.  

The female staff were all dressed in really cute bridesmaid style dresses and gave us some serious attention. We were checked on every few minutes, it was great. Sitting at the pizza bar was actually really fun because we were able to watch the chefs toss and prepare wood-fire pizzas, handmade pastas, and salads. This place cranks out a high volume of pizzas and I can see why. My margherita pizza was fairly priced, cooked perfectly, and adorned with soft and delicious mozzarella with a perfect, tangy tomato sauce.

It is exceptionally well decorated, but, I am sorry to say that I, personally, was not at all comfortable seated in a counter high chair that had an extremely low back side. I felt my legs dangling (I hate that) and I couldn't lean back as I might topple over backwards! Poor choice of seating.. very pretty, but very uncomfortable. The menu was varied, not too overwhelming, so it was easy to make a choice. The servings size was ""normal"", but small for the price! Everyone's food was very good, but again, not exceptional for the high price tag. I ordered white wine and the server poured it into my glass from the bottle... very classy I thought  till I saw a guy sitting at the bar with a glass of white wine that had quite a bit more wine in it than my glass! I guess he knew the bartender and I didn't have that advantage! Yep.. I was bummed! My meatballs were beautifully presented and plentiful for an appetizer so I was happy. I thought my friends serving size were skimpy. The pizza was just okay. 
The one over the top exceptional part of dinner was the service!  The waitress tended to us with outstanding warmth and enthusiasm. She was helpful and very friendly! Several times a manager would check on us and ask how everything was.. they were all sincerely interested. I was overall pleased and would have given 4 stars if I had been comfortable in my chair and had I received the same amount of wine as the guy at the bar! One glass of wine was $14-$15.

My friend remembered the time she stumbled past this newly opened restaurant last time she was in Vegas because the lasagna she had ordered made a lasting impression so we decided to check it out. We came to the hostess stand without a reservation and were able to get seated fairly quickly (I believe we only waited 5 minutes or so). Immediately you could tell how attentive each and every staff member was so that was a huge plus. Once we were seated, the waiter introduced himself and was very friendly and had good options to recommend for us. (I think his name was Luis) He was very nice and polite, and was very patient with our party of 4 not knowing what we wanted to order. The wine was amazing and the sangria was perfect (on the fruitier side). Once we got our food and started eating we knew this was the best meal we had so far in Vegas. I had the ravioli and it was INCREDIBLE! Everyone at my table kept picking at it and stealing it from my plate because it was that good. The other plates that were ordered included the lasagna (perfect in every way, size just right and sauce was delicious), shrimp spaghetti (on the spicier side but came with a lot of shrimp so my mom was very happy), and lastly was a pasta with sausage that I do not remember the name of (great flavor but pasta seemed slightly undercooked but still absolutely delicious).

Osteria Costa is the Almafi Coast transported to Las Vegas. The staff were neat, well composed, friendly and hospitable. The kitchen is obviously very talented.

We started off with the Burrata.. that was sooo good, and helped with my hunger pains, since it was late at night and I had not eaten in many hours.

I'm sure since this will be a positive review management will look and comment but won't comment on the ugly attire of the staff. Come on, wake up.
Ok, that was the bad. Now the food. The food was excellent in every way although I will say all dishes were overly salty as some have pointed out. Had the meatballs. Very good. Also had the spaghetti. Homemade pasta was excellent. Wife had the linguini and clams. Also very good but portions a bit small for the price. Never the less very tasty. The caprisese salad was a bit unusual with 3 small roasted vine tomatoes. Would have enjoyed the standard better than this version, but again, it was good.
Service was good and the drinks very good. The house Chianti was sub par but mixed cocktails were great.

A bit over priced for the portion size but I would still return. Seems like any time homemade pasta is mentioned, the portions shrink.

3871361,2018-02-19,0,esivMfjV4OFS5g8YMuR3UA,"A little hiccup at the hostess stand. I had arrived sans reservation but on the assurance on Mirage's reservation line it would not be required. House seemed to be at 20% occupancy and I was told I could not sit in the dining room due to reservations. After a short conversation with Joe the Manager I was seated in the lounge. It is comfortable table seating though a bit louder due to its proximity to the casino floor. Quickly greeted by Christina, my server who went over the menu and rotating lemon cellos.  I chose the Cara Cara orange. It is quiet nice. Not as astringent as lemon cello usually is but still quiet sweet. 
Joseph brought out a sliced quarter loaf of a good crusty wheat bread and evoo. I then ordered the meatballs and frito misto asking they be staged meatballs first. 

The meatballs are nice. Tender a mixture of beef and pork. But what really makes this dish is the ricotta from a family farm in Wyoming. It is soft, silky and absolutely delicious. The sauce would have been only good. But hear the combination made a perfect combination that made up for slightly dry if not otherwise wonderful meatball. Got give this fish 4 1/2 stars. 
Now on the downside my frito Misto arrived half way through the meatballs.  That aside this is a must have dish. Huge in flavor. Huge in execution. Huge in value. Forget the sub par red sauce that accompanies it and instead slather everything with the lemon caper aioli.  Fresh perfectly cooked shrimp in great abundance accompanied by wafer thin zucchini and three paper thin slices of Fresno pepper are tempura fried with parsley and should be your go to happy hour snack. 
Pizza Margherita came next and frankly seemed it had sat and waited for me after I asked Joe to please slow it down.  The fish arrived with a lack luster fan fare but that doesn't detract from this attractively prepared fish. It has had head and bones removed before cooking which I am not sure is in keeping with Italian sensibilities but is delicious none the less. 
The Branzino, simply prepared, grilled with fennel on the side. Tasty but as you can imagine a bit much after all this food and anti climatic after other dishes so masterfully imagined and prepared. 
Baba Al Rhum for dessert with a expresso dopio. Both good though the desert was a bargain at $6.00. Save some of your dining dollars and spend a grand evening dining on the best of the Amalfi coast in Vegas.

3973999,2018-02-06,5,esivMfjV4OFS5g8YMuR3UA,"Four of us met here to try this new restaurant which had only been open a few days.  It takes the place of Samba Brazilian Steakhouse.  Chef Michael LaPlaca moved here after the Mirage closed Portofino.  The new spot is completely different from the old one except for the amazing food prepared by him and his staff.  Osteria Costa is open to the casino, it's brighter and noisier, and it leaves some of the more sedate and closed environment of Portofino.

We had chef's choice in what we shared Saturday night.  Out from the kitchen came a procession of dishes that were all excellent.  We were served:

House bread with olive oil
Housemade mozzarella with caponata, peppers, olives, and toasted bread
Beef carpaccio
Seafood salad
Tuna crudo
Fritto misto
Flatbread with straccino cheese and olive oil
Meatballs
Piccante pizza
Sausage, fennel, and onion pizza
Linguini and clams
Fettuccine
Rigatoni
White sea bass
Roasted mushrooms
Broccoli rabe
Garlic potatoes
Eggplant rollatini
Lemon ricotta cheesecake
Olive oil cake
Tiramisu
Neapolitan gelato with rainbow cookies

Three of the starters that were my favorites were the tuna crudo, fritto misto, and the meatballs.  The misto has lightly battered and fried vegetables and some pepper rounds that serve up a small amount of heat depending on your tolerance level.  The meatballs are simply excellent.

The flatbread was really good.  One of our party said it was like quesadilla without a top.  The stracchino cheese was superb!  I'd recommend the sausage and fennel pizza and for pasta, the rigatoni and linguine were outstanding.  If you like fish, don't pass on the sea bass.

The desserts were good with the Neapolitan gelato, cheesecake, and olive oil cake being the standouts.  I felt like a kid eating the gelato.

Portion sizes are good and the prices for a Strip hotel are very reasonable.  Service was excellent!

I'm sure this new restaurant will be successful.  Putting out great dishes like they did just a few days after opening is indicative of a group of people that know their craft and execute very well!",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,16,11,5,RICLRdnLVekcv4UFglXWRg

Decor is on point of what you'd see on the Amafli coast, creating an airy, cottage like space - perfect for dining!

STAFF: Our server, Brian, was beyond friendly, made a great wine suggestion and made great conversation with us! He checked back frequently (but not enough to be annoying) and ensured our waters were constantly refilled. 

SUSTENANCE: SO so so good! It's hard to go wrong fresh tomatoes and basil, gooey cheese and perfectly crafted fish! Everything we ordered tasted so delicious! Being that we had a party of 6, we opted for a few appetizers to get started - Fritto Misto which featured crispy shrimp, vegetables & lemon, along with the meatballs, which was stuffed with whipped ricotta and basil!

5279438,2018-02-21,2,esivMfjV4OFS5g8YMuR3UA,"Although Osteria Costa is not ""officially"" open until the end of this week, the geniuses in MGM Public Relations apparently needing three weeks to invite all the 'media' and 'influencers' who will only visit once, tweet some photos and never return, it was prior to QotSA at The Cosmopolitan that a second meal was enjoyed at The Mirage's newest Restaurant, a tasting of all nine Pastas plus a Pizza once again proving this a space to be reckoned with in Las Vegas' often underwhelming mid-priced dining category.

In reality serving guests since February 1st, Chef Michael LaPlaca and General Manager Chris Zadie carrying over a large number of their staff from Portofino to a more casual space jutting out into the gaming area, it was on the Osteria Costa's third day that a visit with friends found the space already humming along in high gear, the two weeks in between producing largely positive accounts on Social Media and the Restaurant  doing good business with both reservations and the walk-in crowd.

Focused on the Cuisine of Naples and the Amalfi Coast with a menu divided into six sections, a collection of housemade Pastas the largest and most relevant for those familiar with Michael's work at Portofino, it was shortly after the Restaurant's 5:00pm opening that a seat was offered at either the Pizza bar or one stocked with Booze, the former an easy choice for those who would rather watch the Chefs work than whatever sport is being shown on TV.

Already familiar with much of the staff, though a pair of open kitchens allows diners far more access than did the former location, it was shortly after taking a seat that Iced Tea was delivered along with Warm Bread and Olive Oil, the decision to tread lightly with the latter well advised as it was no more than ten minutes before a Margherita Pie with imported Mozzarella di Bufala was being painted with Olive Oil from a Rosemary Branch and presented with light hints of char plus a puffy cornicione.

Dinning before a show but leaving plenty of time, the tasting pre-arranged to maximize variety in the setting of Osteria Costa's surprisingly large portions, it was with slices of Pizza once again proving to be the Strip's best that three plates of Pasta were delivered, the emerging signature Rigatoni alla Norma once again a highlight with tender Eggplant and boldly aromatic Red Sauce while the Fusilli was fairly similar though lacking in textural variance, a situation certainly not applicable to al dente Bucatini Cacio e Pepe that serves the Noodles just as they should be with good Cheese and an extra bit of intrigue contributed by Pink Peppercorns added at the end.

Producing every Pasta on-site, some machine-cut and others hand-formed, it was as first bites were being enjoyed that an additional trio joined the tasting, silky ribbons of Fettucine from visit number one again forming the backdrop for meaty Ragu that doesn't hide behind Tomatoes while the Lasagna with housemade Sausage is reminiscent of the version at Portofino and therefore quite good, as too is LaPlaca's take on Spaghetti Alio & Olio that features plump Shrimp and particularly hot Serrano Chiles barely tamed by Garlic and a touch of Mint.

Served in 1/4 to 1/3 portions, prices ranging $18-$22 for full-size plates that will easily make a meal for most, it was as part of the last round that Linguini & Clams was placed between Cannelloni and Agnolotti, the hollow tubes packed with herbed-Ricotta tender but fairly pedestrian while Michael's best Pasta from Portofino still shines in a more simple presentation than the legendary one made with Corn and Lobster.

Unable to pass on Dessert, the only one missed at last visit requested alongside another look at Osteria Costa's Neapolitan Cookie Gelato, it bears repeating that at $5-$7 each there may be no better Restaurant deal in Las Vegas right now than this collection of Sweets, the frozen treat studded with and topped in Rainbow Cookies featuring three sizable scoops while the Brioche covered in freshly whipped Cream and housemade Limoncello tops Alain Ducasse's version at Rivea for half the price.

****1/2  Unable to judge Osteria Costa as one would Portofino despite the same Chef and General Manager, the concepts and price-point simply different, two early looks at Michael LaPlaca's new Restaurant hopefully provide a glimpse of what is possible but seems long forgotten in the era of Celebrity Chef nonsense, and that is a space serving great Food that is at the same time accessible and affordable without compromising on style or service.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,11,12,5,k3YuAvTLJZb6Jb6z7CWqGg

Crispy croutons, finely shaved Parmesan and delicious dressing.  My husband loved the rustic, flavorful taste of the lasagna.  I wanted something other than a red pasta sauce, so our adorable sever ""Jordan"" recommended the Bucatini Cacio e Pepe. And she didn't let me down. Also at her recommendation I added chicken and it was a perfect, tasty addition. 
I look forward to returning to try more items on the menu. 
Highly recommend dining here.",JKppTWBmzmyOWlvsizE4og,0,0,5,iik80-UheJTnqLASOUM_yg
5698263,2018-03-04,0,esivMfjV4OFS5g8YMuR3UA,"I was in town for work this week and was nosing around for some good italian cuisine.  I typed in ""cacio e pepe"" to see what hits I would get.  I first had this dish in Rome last fall and I was jonesing for a fix.

I arrived by myself around 7:00pm and had no trouble getting a seat.  I chose to sit at the pizza bar, even though I wasn't planning on getting the pizza.

Zenia was my waitress and she did a great job.  I came for the cacio e pepe, but she talked up the meatballs enough to pique my interest.  She was willing to give me a smaller version of the meatball starter (essentially a side of two meatballs in sauce).  She asked if it was okay if they were plated together and I requested that they be plated separately.  I was brought some bread and olive oil to nosh on while waiting for my meal.  The bread wasn't remarkable, but it did a find job of sopping up some of my leftover tomato sauce.

My food arrived extremely quickly and it looked beautiful.  The pasta was terrific.  The noodles were nicely al dente and that familiar black pepper taste was prominent.  I ate it all.  The meatballs were good, but didn't wow me.  Which is fine, because I'll eat that pasta all day.

One of the most enjoyable parts of my dinner was being able to chat with the folks on the other side of the pizza bar making salads and pizzas.  They were extremely friendly and happy to answer any questions that I had about their pizza oven and how they make their pizzas.

The next time I'm in town, I will happily make time to venture up the Mirage to chow down on the cacio e pepe at Osteria Costa.  And I'll try the pizza.",SwgCR62v2RKU3mQo1S-dlQ,0,1,4,j9e1JfSnRB5EshK8eVgwOw

My girl had the salmon and I had the fettucini. The salmon was cooked to shit and cost over $30. We sent it back because the texture was literally like chewing on dry steak. Also the side of brocolli rob was INEDIBLE. Ive had brocolli rob before on sandwiches and pizzas, but this brocolli was bitter to the point it tasted like I was eating tylenol seasoned brocolli, it made me literally make a disgusted face and I really wanted to spit it out. HUGE miss.. the chefs really must have not tasted it because it was inexcusably disgusting to serve to paying customers. Like no joke I had to wash my mouth out with other food because it left such a bitter taste.

We had meatballs, they were just okay, noras cuisine has better.

Now on to my fettucini, which was SO bland. Like when you get a pasta dish you expect buttery cheesy saltiness. All you can taste is sweetness and a light clove like flavor from the ragu. Didnt offer any cheese on it like every othe italian restaurant ever made. I literally took 3 bites and didnt want to eat anymore because it just WASNT GOOD lol.. I dont know about you but who the hell wants to eat sweet, bland, not cheesy or salty tasting pasta. Not I.

The saddest part was the side of roasted mushrooms was BY FAR the best part of the meal, but its literally imposible to fuck up garlic flavored mushrooms so not that impressive.

Our server was excellent, cant remember her name but she was a tall caucasian lady. The ""managers"" and chefs on the other hand were more interested in flirting with the women patrons instead of checking on us. Whats hilarious is our server even gave us a complimentary desert because of the overcooked salmon, but surprise surprise even the chocolate cake was dry and mealy in texture with weak ass whip cream on top. We both ate a single bite and didnt want any more at ALL. Our server even noticed that we didnt like it and offered their olive cake instead, but we were just ready to leave at that point

All this happened, and the chef never came and said a word to us, not a single manager in their nice blue suits came to apologize, because they were busy talking to one table of girls the entire time we ate, literally the entire time lol..

These early reviews Im pretty sure are fake or they just tried better dishes, because YIKES this was one of the worst dining experiences ive ever had on the strip of all places.

Our nice server and the mushrooms are the only reason this isnt a 1 star review.",2r0CnsEbhBo75KYoVF8eGA,3,0,2,Avks1dOJGVIyO5EWC34ptQ

The flavors and freshness were on par with what we loved about the former ... and some of the choices familiar such as carpaccio with arugula. We also enjoyed burrata with roasted tomato and lasagne, highly recommend! We finished the meal with baba rum cake topped with whipped cream and doused with limoncello. Our meal was orchestrated very pleasantly by server Savannah and wine steward Derrick. All-in-all a wonderful pre-Valentine's Day celebration.",uZ8dsc3aRSps0DcItGgtfw,0,0,5,p0I_w77DxUPwTZcjv-V8uA

We had chicken parmigiana and the sausage pizza which were good. The chicken parm was literally chicken and sauce no noodles.
