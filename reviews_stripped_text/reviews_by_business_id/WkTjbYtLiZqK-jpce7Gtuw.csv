I been to plenty of Ethiopian resturants and it something i miss dearly from home in Seattle. So when i went the first time, things were enjoyable.But the last three times ive tried bringing others here its been disappointing to say the least. The service has went down hill completely not sure if under different management. What you order is not normally what you expect, its extremely bizarre. I normally dont write reviews but felt like i needed to, so people would not be fooled, im currently not sure of where else to go but we will definitely not be back.

437407,2008-08-15,0,WkTjbYtLiZqK-jpce7Gtuw,"Okay... I may not be from Ethiopia, but I've had my share of Ethiopian food.  I've even been to Ethiopia and had the food there (a friend is from Ethiopia).  But, this is a place for opinions, and here's mine.

Food:  For about $10 a dish, I've had much better tasting Ethiopian food - in Chicago, Minneapolis, and Los Angeles (and Addis Ababa).  I've been to Abyssinia restaurant about three times, and each time was a subpar performance.  I kept hoping each day was a fluke, but the food had always been below average.  The veggie combo is questionable.  Some parts are okay, like the lentils (misir wat), while other parts smell and taste spoiled like the collard greens (goman).  I've also had the shiro which was sometimes gooey and other times pastey.  The zil zil tibs (strips of beef) are too tough and chewy, and I was too afraid to try the kitfo (raw/rare beef).  As far as I'm aware, zil zil tibs is one of the more popular Ethiopian dishes, and if they can't even get that right, then something is wrong with the cook.  The one decent dish I did have was the quanta firfir.  But I guess it's difficult to screw up beef jerky.

Service:  The staff (Ethiopians) are generally friendly, but I think they are skeptical of non-Ethiopians walking into the restaurant.  Everytime I went in to order food, they would give me a look, as if to say, ""Are you lost?""  But would lighten up and smile, when I start ordering food.  The food arrvies quickly - about 15 minutes for two dishes.

Atmosphere:  A very small restaurant, there are about 10 tables designed for 2-4 people, Ethiopian music playing softly in the backgroud, generally all Ethiopians for clientele, the decor isn't very impressive, but again it's a small restaurant.

Location:  If you blink, you'll miss it.  The restaurant is located in a strip mall near a Target store.  The only distinguishing feature is the Ethiopian colors (green, yellow, red) running across the front windows.  You don't even notice the restaurant's name until you're right next to it, and you're looking for it.

Advice:  I have yet to find a decent Ethiopian restaurant in Las Vegas.  I hope to find one soon, so I can sugget a different place to go to for Ethiopian food.

Note:  ""Google maps"" lists this place as ""Abyssimia"" with the letter 'm', instead of ""Abyssinia"".",G2-j7wrT5MZFxgK2a291XQ,0,0,2,89ImlNILuFxCUesixeAgfg

She ordered beef tibs and a side of red lentils.  All the food was very good and flavorful.  The injera had a really nice tangy taste to it.

Got the veggie combo. Very tasty. I could, however, do without the collards, but understand it's part of the combo. Plenty of injera, which was also very good. We were stuffed for $20.

It wouldn't quite earn a four-star rating if this were a city like, say, Washington, DC--where there's a huge Ethiopian community and hence lots of competing restaurants--but this was very, very good place for this area.  And, crucially, it is authentic.  In fact, there is bilingual Amharic-English signage to prove that and cool African TV shows running in the background!  Food wise, the Injera was spot on, made properly with teff flour (healthy for you, btw!)--delicate, delicious.  We got one of the veg + non-veg assortment plates and liked most of the many things on it.  The service can be a little slow.  (Be patient.)  But the servers themselves are incredibly sweet people.  Don't expect much in the way of alcoholic beverages.  Just come for the food.  

I should say that we liked the place so much that we went back, even though we were only in the Vegas area for 5 days.  A much healthier option that hitting the buffets on the strip!",Fp91_r8vZqtoTTt7LrNB2w,0,0,4,zr22zvpng8bnkO-a4Llbvw

I can't remember the names of the dishes but my party got the combo so that we could taste everything.  We weren't a fan of the raw meat though because it had a weird sour taste.  I am also not a fan of the bread.  It is just too sour for my taste and the texture is not something I'm used too but everyone else in my party loved it.  To each their own!  The only reason I'm giving this place a 3-star is because of lack of service.  We waited 40 minutes for our check because our server was busy entertaining a customer at the bar and waited another 15 minutes to wait for our change.

Terrible attitudes from the staff (started off with, ""What do you want?""), then completely ignored the entire time (except when of course we just got up ""as if to leave without paying"" they finally took a break from the only two other tables in the place to to rush over), no water, no offer of anything else to eat or drink... only to attempt to take a very undeserved 40% gratuity off the table at the end. This would be a 5 if it weren't for the horrific service. The food was exactly as it should be. Being the only white people in the room and seeing the interaction with the other patrons, with an instant shift when we walked in, it was clear we weren't welcome.

1255348,2017-11-07,0,WkTjbYtLiZqK-jpce7Gtuw,"Very tasty & a bargain for what you get!

My friend and I ordered the vegetarian sampler plate - which came with six different items plus a bit of salad - all served on a single large plate that was covered with injera - the spongy crepe-like bread that you use in lieu of utensils.

Language can present a bit of a challenge here. Although our servers spoke enough English to order and to get the basic ideas across, details were vague. We asked to server to tell us what each dish was before we dug in, and the answers were ""This one is sweet ... This is cabbage. This is Spicy and red"" etc   No names, or even even what was in them (except for cabbage).

No matter; we figured out that basically there were several lentil/legume dishes with various spice treatments, a cabbage stew, and collard greens. Each was delicious. 

Usually when eating Ethiopian food, I enjoy a glass of Tej, the sweet honey wine that is akin to European mead. Unfortunately, here they only serve it by the bottle, so I went without. 

Also, the music (which was pretty awesome) was unfortunately very VERY loud - to the point where it was difficult to hold a conversation. One of my party couldn't take it, and wound up leaving early. 

As others have mentioned, this block gets kinda sketchy at night. Lock your car, and keep your eyes open. Don't be afraid, just aware.",8la7DygWKVkfpDatXztktg,2,0,4,KcQfjARnqMh5IUM-O2oU8w
1345598,2011-11-22,1,WkTjbYtLiZqK-jpce7Gtuw,"Have been wanting to try this place since I read the Yelp reviews a few weeks ago.  Last night, the group was feeling a little adventurous, so we headed over to Abyssinia.

The restaurant is very nice and clean, and was quiet enough to have easy group conversation, which I believe is key to having a shared table meal.

The only negative points this place got was the language barrier for us non-native language speaking folks.  Being there are approximately 90 languages spoken in Ethiopia, I wouldn't even know where to start to remedy that.  The menu items were in English, but descriptions were in local language, so it was a ""best guess"", which if fun anyway.  The waitress had a difficult time getting our message sometimes, but she was very sweet.

We ordered a meat and vegetable sampler, a jerky dish, a vegetable dish, and one of the group wasn't feeling so adventurous and ordered spaghetti.  I guess that's the default American dish for the poor person who was forced to tag along.  :)

The meats and vegetables were amazing!  I wish I knew what everything was.  We were able to determine the chicken, beef, and lamb, but the spices and sauces were a mystery, yet wonderful!

The sour flatbread (injera) was nice and soft and not too sour.  This, being the utensil to pick up all the food, makes for a fun night.  Everyone tearing pieces of bread off and pinching morsels of yummy food from the common plate.  Make sure you're comfortable with your party.  Don't take the guy who doesn't wash his hands in the bathroom!  Oh, and it's culturally acceptable to only use your right hand for eating....I'm pretty sure we all were, but not sure.  

In summary, great food & atmosphere.  A recipe for a fun night.",6x3aIb8SLZcOFcHEcWBLog,1,1,4,JXZdtWlUGBIj-hIEY74iFQ

1874676,2016-07-14,1,WkTjbYtLiZqK-jpce7Gtuw,"Abyssinia was another surprise find in the area.   D discovered this place when heading to Walgreens and made a mention to me.    It's been well over a year since I've had Ethiopian food so it was exciting to hear about this option less than ten minutes from our hotel.    We stopped by to get a menu to review.

I checked out the menu and immediately zeroed in on their meat and veggie combo as well as a sambusa appetizer.     We returned to the restaurant Thursday evening around 8pm to dine.

I will say it does seem to be an authentic restaurant since the majority of the patrons appeared to be of Ethiopian descent.    We stood around for about a minute before a random patron sitting at a table (perhaps a family member) called out to a server to seat us.

She wound up being pleasant though providing average service.   There was a separate server that gave us water.    The water was warm which was disappointing.

We ordered tea and was disappointed to see a Lipton bag.   D thought he tasted a hint of spice (similar to the tasty tea we had at Ethiopian Diamond in Chicago) but I didn't taste anything.    

The sambusa appetizer was served dry, cold and pricey.    We received two in total at $2.50 a pop.   We also didn't get any extra plates to put our own individual sambusa on though since it was dry, there was no leakage to worry about.   Some kind of dipping sauce would've made the dish slightly better.   Meh so far.

The main event came in the form of a meat and veggie combo platter that we ordered.   There looked to be three different varieties of lentils, spinach, cabbage/carrot dish, two varieties of beef, two varieties of lamb, cottage cheese, and a main chicken dish with an egg.   We were given a basket of injerra bread that was served cold.   The lentils were all cold.    One of the beef dishes was raw (which I believe is their speciality).   I did try beef tartare at a French bistro a long time back and wasn't a fan.   I wasn't a fan of Abyssinia's rendition either.   I also didn't care for the cottage cheese.    The meat dishes were lukewarm overall though they had a nice spice.   D found the spicing strong but his tolerance for spicy food isn't the greatest.  I found it average.  Eh (a step below meh...LOL).

With our hands being dirty from the food, it was disappointing to not get even a basic wipe packet.   I wound up washing my hands at the Orleans.   

I definitely need to make my way back to Ethiopian Diamond soon.",PVG8Mven0Swjrwxg_C5a4Q,2,1,2,t25UMHasI3I0KBL3WNcuhg

So we took a shot and got one of those platters that comes with a variety of things so we could try a little bit of everything. All the ""toppings"" were really good...but we didn't enjoy the meal because of the ""bread"" or ""dough"" that comes with the platter. The dough had a spongy texture and tasted like sourdough, which I am not a fan of. I would have enjoyed this more if I could have ordered rice to eat with all the toppings :) 

The 3 star is not for bad service or bad food, I just didn't have a great experience because I was not sure what to order and because I didn't like the dough.

The best part to me was the ""coffee ceremony"". Its one of those things that you have to know about and ask for to get. Coffee ceremony is where the coffee beans are roasted over coals and fresh roasted in an authentic black coffee kettle.

First impression of the restaurant itself was not too impressive. It's in a dicey strip mall near the Orleans. The inside isn't very welcoming or decorated in any special way. It's a mix of sparsely placed ethiopian decor mixed with cheap tables and chairs circa cheesy 90's. 
Service left much to be desired. I sat for quite awhile before even getting water. Then had to wave down the waitress to take my order. She was also less than helpful when I told her it was my first time there. Food took a loooong time to come. There were only 2 other tables in the whole place, so the bad service and long time for food to come didn't go over well for me. I was hangry. 
Okay now the good part...THE FOOD!! I ordered the veggie combo plate and it was sooo delicious! There were 3 or 4 different stews and then some veggies and a salad. The injera bread was in the top 2 that I've ever had. I also had the beer (can't recall the name, but it was very refreshing!). The food alone was very good, if I were just rating that it would be a 4 star rating. However, the service and lack of warm and fuzzy feeling inside take it down to a 3. Bill came out to $60 for a veggie plate and a lamb plate, and 2 beers. Not a great deal, yet not awful.

We walked in and there were only a couple of tables filled. We sat and perused the menu. The last time we had Ethiopian food was a few years ago in Amsterdam. We decided on the veggie and meat platter. A unique dining experience where you eat with a soft spongy flat bread instead of silverware. The food was served on a huge platter which included veggies with something sour, sweet, savory and bland. The contrast of flavors was enticing. The meats included chicken with a delicious sauce, beef and lamb. Again some of sauces were spicy, savory and marinated with interesting spices. You rip a piece of the spongy bread and grab from the piles of food on the platter.

I had a Sambusa and Doro Tibs. The Sambusa was Very good! The outside was nice and flaky, but the inside was very flavorful. I should have ordered more than one. The Doro Tibs is a chicken dish, with onions and sliced jalapeno peppers. You can tell them the level of spicy you want. You get a choice of rice or Injera, and I chose injera to be more authentic. The chicken had a good flavor and I imagine it would go well with rice as well. I would use the injera bread sparingly, since it will make you full quickly. The service was casual, and a little on the slower side, but that didn't ruin my experience at all.

I've been to only a couple of Ethiopian restaurants in my life, once in Washington D.C. and another time in SF. I went to Abyssinia for lunch with 4 coworkers and we were seated on regular dining tables. For dinner though, they make the entire dining area available. So if you're into a much more interesting experience, opt for no table and sit on the stools surrounding a basket which holds the food that you and your party will be sharing. There will be no plates and don't even think about asking for utensils. Ethiopians eat this stuff with their hands. and everything just tastes better when you do the same. If you're grossed out by having other people's fingers in your food, this might not be your cup of tea.

Our server recommended we share 2 meat combinations and their veggie combination. However, the food came out around 40 minutes after we ordered. Not sure if this was the norm but it was exceedingly slow since we were there on our lunch break from work. The food came on a large platter of stewed dishes on top of Injera bread and more bread on the side. Injera, an Ethiopian food staple, is a spongy flat bread used to sop up the food. The dough is fermented (like sourdough) which gives it a mildly-sour flavor. There was an assortment of meats (chicken, beef and lamb) and stewed veggie dishes. Wish our server took the time to give us a quick rundown of the dishes. I knew we ordered lamb but sadly couldn't tell which meat was which. Maybe it was due to the strong flavor of the stews. Some dishes were spicier than others and good overall but not the best I've ever tried. I will be returning - curious about the experience at dinner time. ""I'll be seeing ya.""

2927242,2010-08-16,0,WkTjbYtLiZqK-jpce7Gtuw,"This was my first time trying Ethiopian food, balancing out the service, ambiance, and the food, I'll give it 3 stars. 

When we just walked in, we weren't greeted by anybody. There was a very strong aroma of some sort of incense that clouded the room. It was pretty overpowering.  We saw some lady sitting in the corner of the room staring at us. We assumed she was a customer since she didn't say anything, but eventually she got up and we asked her if we could sit anywhere, she said yes. We sat down and she brought us one menu for the both of us, which was a little awkward trying to read from two different sides of the table.

 There were a lot of plates on the menu, but since we never had Ethiopian before we didn't know what to get. We opted for the #16, which was the sauteed beef strips for $10.99. We decided to share since we weren't sure about their portions. Good thing we did that, cuz their plate was humungo. 

 For our drinks we ordered coke ($1.50) and tea ($1.50). I was kind of expecting the tea to be something different, but when she brought it to me she just gave me a glass with hot water and a Lipton tea bag on the side.  My boyfriend just got a can of coke with a straw. 

Our food came and it looked like fajitas and salad on top of a giant crepe. She also gave us a basket of more crepe looking things (sorry I never found out the name). He ate a little piece of it on it's own and he didn't like it, it had a salty vinegar taste to it. Surprisingly it actually tasted pretty good when wrapped around a piece of meat and salad. 

I enjoyed being able to eat with my hands and not be stared at, but I think it would be nice if they provided some sort of wet towelette to wipe our hands with. 

All in all this was a pretty good experience for us. Ethiopian isn't my favorite type of food, but I'm happy I can say that I tried it. I've actually had a few people tell me that this is one of the most authentic Ethiopian places in Vegas.

DO NOT GET THE TIRAMISU. Why one would order tiramisu at an Ethiopian restaurant and expect it to be good I do not know, but it was TERRIBLE.

It's actually my first and only experience with Ethiopian food, so I don't really have a basis for comparison, but it has turned into my must have food. I moved out of town for a couple of minutes last year, and though there was an Ethiopian restaurant an hour away from me, it made more sense to drive the 12 hours home to eat here. (It's my ""only experience"", but I've been here a dozen times, don't get me wrong..) 

 My friends and I usually get the meat and veggie combo platter, and two or more of us fight over the hard boiled egg. Not that it's particularly better than everything else, but there's only one of them, and no silverware to split it up.. :) (I'm sure they would bring us some if we ever asked, but fighting is better.) The Injera breadstuff that you use to scoop up some filling is my favorite. Also, the honey wine is amazing. Don't ever go here with unadventurous eaters. They're downers, and they will probably make noises and turn their noses. It's a simple presentation, and the spices are harsh, kinda like Indian cuisine. I guess that's the best comparison.. If you like Indian, I think you'll LOOOOVE Ethiopian. 

There was a time that even though there seemed to be no one else in there, our waitress would not check on us often, but this has not been a problem the past few times I've been here. Either they have started to like me or they realized it was a problem.. Either way, I love this place.

We ordered a veggie dish (my friend is pescatarian) which includes plenty of lentils and veggies (duh). I ordered the lamb tibs (bite sized chunks of sauteed meat onion and spices) and what is considered by many Eithopians as their national dish, Doro Wat. Its a chicken leg and hard boiled egg covered in red pepper spices (berberé). We wash our hands spread some injera and get down to eat, all good stuff, pretty standard Ethiopian fare, for what its worth you get plenty of food for around $20.

My vegetarian friend was in town for the NAB and needed me to take her anywhere as long as it was off the strip. Abyssinia hit the spot again. For the uninitiated, Ethiopian food is eaten the same way you eat fries and burgers -- with your hands (to be technical your right hand!). Don't be a cultural square and ask for a fork or spoon por favor.

I've been to two other Ethiopian spots here in Lost Wages: the now closed Axum and Merkato, and this gonna be my go to spot next time I have a craving for Ethiopian food for sure.

Facility:  it's located on the end of a strip mall by some massage spots. The decor is simple yet unique. They have a small ""coffee ceremony"" table as soon as you walk in to the left, and the rest of the room is normal tables and chairs. They played some ethnic music to set the mood too. 

Service:  my friend warned me as I was looking up reviews on YELP that the service was not the greatest.  The lady who helped us was nice, but pretty quiet and lackluster. English is not her first language, so my friend struggled with trying to make changes to a dish. They are a little slow with the food too, so just come prepared to sit back and enjoy the company your with, while you wait for authentic food. 

Food:  I liked the food. There wasn't anything I tasted that I didn't like; however, there weren't a lot of dishes that made me swoon either. Most of it was just good. 
Warning....if you've never eaten Ethiopian food, you eat with your fingers.  They serve a sour porous pancake to scoop the food up with.  I liked them, but only used them a little, as I didn't want to fill up with the ""bread"". 
I ordered the massive meat and veggie combo plate, so I could try a little of everything. I don't remember the names of the dishes, but I'll describe the stand outs. 
I loved the cabbage, but I'm a big cabbage fan. 
The salad was good with a nice vinegar dressing. 
The greens were pretty good, considering I'm a southern girl and we always cook them with meat. 
I liked this spicy dish with whole boiled eggs in it.  I loved the spiciness and I'm an egg fan, so it worked. 
Also liked the raw/marinated meat. It was also spicy, so I enjoyed the kick. 
There was so much food, it took 2 large Togo containers to take the rest home. 

Overall:  I liked the unique flavors. I liked the authentic flavors and eating with your fingers. I may not be banging down the door tomorrow, but it's a good restaurant I will come back to again someday.",-50XWnmQGqBgEI-9ANvLlg,3,3,3,t7Z845vepT8_S-MW_LvnQA

I, along with many friends and relatives, used to frequent the establishment, and until about six months ago, we received quality food and excellent service. However, since the restaurant experienced a change in management, the place has gone downhill.
I am Ethiopian, and I grew up eating (arguably) the highest quality of my country's cuisine. In an effort to expose my Hispanic boyfriend to a part of my culture, I took him to Abyssinia, and we encountered a rather inattentive and condescending waitress who not only took fifteen minutes in between each visit to our table to take orders, ask us how we were doing/if we needed anything, but actually flat-out refused to replace a couple components in our meat combo platter. Now, I would understand if this is  major inconvenience, but I wouldn't have asked for it if A) I was capable of digesting raw meat (kitfo), B) we weren't willing to pay extra, and C) they hadn't customized my order in the past. This happened to us not only once, but TWICE.
I was extremely disappointed and completely unsatisfied. My boyfriend did enjoy what little he did get to experience of Ethiopian cuisine, but I'm sure he will be delighted to get the full experience when we take our business elsewhere.
Abyssinia has also lowered its standards in giving equal portions of food; the ratio between injera (the tortilla-like bread used to scoop up meats/stews/veggies, etc.) to wot (stews, et al) balanced more heavily on the injera, which, if you've had Ethiopian food, is not the flavorful part of the meal.

Highly disappointed. I doubt I will return.",LeQEvE7FjxSVDxXRibfg5g,4,0,2,wS-ibkEqFXLOzxWaqlTh6Q

Every person I have ever turned on to Ethiopian food is always extremely pleasantly surprised by it. It is so delicious. I constantly crave it. Ethiopian beer is good as well, and Abyssinia carries it.

So we had their meat/veggie combo with about 8 dishes and added another veal dish and each was was fresh and full of flavor. Had some Ethiopian beer but it's Vegas, so they do have a full bar.

4934529,2016-07-31,1,WkTjbYtLiZqK-jpce7Gtuw,"Following up on my weekend of amazing foods, I always wanted to have some Ethiopian food here in Las Vegas.  Having had it in San Francisco and in New York, i wanted to have some of it close to home.

What I love about Ethiopian food are three essential things:

a. I can eat with my hands only,
b. Many of the foods are stewed or in bite size pieces in a gravy.
c. The flavors are so good.

I have to add a fourth, now that the daughter has been a Vegan the past few months and of course, you can get that here in Ethiopian cuisine.

To make this an easy and good experience for the daughter and wife, i simply ordered two dishes, the Meat Combo and the Vegetarian Combo.

The Meat Combo consisted of Beef Tibs, Kitfo, Stewed Lamb, Chicken and another spicy stewed lamb dish.  This was tasty. I had the Kitfo for the first time as it is traditionally prepared which is raw minced and with spices. Yummy!  Loved it. Also, really enjoyed the stewed lamb.

The Veggie Combo, my daughter mostly had, but you know me, I do love the veggies.  It came with a Salad, Ater Kit or Split Peas, Yatakilt or boiled chopped cabbage, Yemisir Wot or Split Red Lentils, Collard Greens and more Chick Peas.  I liked the Lentils and Chick Peas the best. 

They give you PLENTY of Injera to soak up all the goodness.

While I enjoyed the combinations, I did that just to make it easy.  Next time, i will focus on specific ordering as I really like stewed lamb and the Kitfo as a few other dishes.

They also serve alcohol here, so that is an added plus. Probably bring some of my friends here. Darn it, now I will really have to wash the hands well.....

The ambiance of this restaurant is interesting. It seems nice, but also a bit commercial or less than cozy.  The restaurants in San Fran and NYC are very cozy, small, uber cool and decorated.  It is an ambiance that transports you as part of the experience. Here, it was okay, just a bit spartan in comparison.

On this visit, we knew exactly what we wanted and found it easily on the menu.

#10 Vegi-Combination (#s 3,4,5,6,7,8,9) $11.99 - This is a great way to experience a large variety of typical Ethiopian vegetarian options.  Although 7 were listed, we actually received a 8 different kinds.

#3 Abyssinia Salad ""Special salad with tomato, onion, jalapeno, touch of fresh garlic with our secret Abyssinia style salad sauce."" - This is a refreshing salad that was probably the first to be finished.

#4 Ater Kik Alicha ""Mild yellow split peas cooked with onions, oil and garlic with a touch of turmeric and subtle blend of herbs and spices.""

#5 Yatakilt Alicha ""A delicious vegetable: Boiled chopped cabbage, sliced carrots, and simmered with onions, garlic, ginger, and vegetable oil.""

#6 Yemisir Wot with Red Pepper ""Split red lentils are stewed with onion garlic, pepper, and a blend of Ethiopian herbs.""

#7 Yemisir Wot with Turmeric ""Split lentils are stewed with onion, garlic, and a blend of mild Ethiopian herbs.""

#8 Collared Greens ""Chopped collared greens simmered in a mild sauce of oil, onion, and herbs.""

#9 Shiro ""Roasted and powdered chick peas are simmered in our unique, hot and spicy berbere sauce with vegetable oil served with injera.""

There's just something about the way the spices are utilized in Ethiopian stewed dishes that make it all so tasty.  Soaking it all up with injera makes it such a great meal.

The highlight of this dinner was the kitfo, of course.  Since discovering kitfo, I just love it.

#9 Kitfo ""Finely chopped, ground beef with spiced Ethiopian butter, homemade feta cheese, mitmita (spiced red pepper) served with injera. (Served raw, mild, or well done.) $11.99 - Amazingly good.  That's all I can really say about it.  We ordered it raw and I like it with the accompanying red pepper for that little bit of heat.

Overall, their veggie combination and kitfo portions are very generous.  I could easily compare their portions to some of the other Ethiopian restaurants in town and will say theirs is very large.  It was only the Husband and I during this meal, and I still had leftovers for two lunches following.  Don't be shy about asking for more injera too.

There were a few other diners on this Sunday evening, and two waitresses.  When we walked in, we just stood around for a bit until someone told us to sit wherever we liked.  Once we started eating, both waitresses were attentive and asked us often how everything was.  I'll definitely return again.",rt3PC7WCgCKsoufmQJELfw,7,10,5,u-WIEr-rZXX1i_GTtndeQw

My friend & I each ordered iced tea, which at  $2.50 each was very pricey, especially since it apparently was just regular iced tea, not Ethiopian iced tea, which I like a lot but they don't have here.  She asked us if we wanted the ice tea sweet or just regular and since I normally put a little sugar into my ice tea I asked for it sweet as did my friend.   What we were served tasted exactly like Nestea powdered iced tea mix, with way too much sugar added to it in fact the bottom of our glasses each had about a quarter of an inch of sugar.

They were simply regular sized glasses of iced tea not huge mugs or a carafe or pitcher of it.  We both eventually asked for refills since we were thirsty despite way too much sugar being in them, and were both shocked and irritated to see that when the bill arrived we were charged another $2.50 for our second glasses of iced tea!   That is utterly ridiculous since their price for iced tea was very high to begin with and the iced tea they made was clearly just some powdered instant iced tea mix.   She did not inform us when we asked for refills that we would be charged for second glasses of iced tea.

We will not be back.   Thankfully there are other Ethiopian restaurants in Las Vegas and I will continue to patronize them instead of this place.",8KWR1qLgN2rTZ4VSGW9yvg,2,0,2,_3kK9DjOwlk6hT4M02kcWw

The woman who took care of us was very kind and had a (lovely) thick accent.

In regards to the menu, it was mostly the standard fare I've seen for Ethiopian restaurants across the states, plus some extras. Ethiopian coffee and beer, sambusas as appetizers, individual meat and veggie dishes that could be combined into a hefty sampler. 

We ordered our regular Ethiopian picks:

Ethiopian beer: B
Sambusas: B- (they were just a titch over-cooked and didn't have the traditional chili sauce with them, as well as being a bit minimal on the pastry filling.)
Vegetarian sampler: A+ -- the tomato salad and carrot/ cauliflower dishes were better than my fave Ethiopian restaurant offers, while the two lentil dishes and the spinach dish were on par.

My true review of Abyssinia would be 4.5 stars, due to the sub par sambusas (my fave part of the meal) and very dark lighting. But if I lived in Vegas, I'd definitely visit them again.",mDkdURvN4_rWCLnPKaqFQQ,1,0,5,s0xNmx8pDBZfTdTnf28cKQ

Adam suggested that we start with something small and if we like it, we'll order more. What a great idea that was! The vegetable combination platter that we ordered, although seemed small, was so filling that we were stuffed after going through a quarter of it. 

You get four-five items sitting on top of a bread called injera. There were collard greens, stewed lentils and three different types of stewed peas: a mild version (yellow), a medium spicy version (orange) and a super tangy and spicy version (red). The mild peas and collard greens were sooooooo good! I loved them. I'm not into lentils so I skipped that while the red peas were the strangest thing I've ever tried.  It had such a strong kick to its taste, and did I mention how spicy this particular item was?!! 

Injera, the bread, came in a basket; a bundle of fluffy spongy goodness for you to tear up and dip into the stewed vegetables. I've never had anything quite like it. It was subtle and strange and yet very much agreeable with my palate!
