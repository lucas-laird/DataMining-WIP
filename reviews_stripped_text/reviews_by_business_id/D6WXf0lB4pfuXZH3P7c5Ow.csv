We ended up ordering an okonomiyaki and chicken kara-age for starters. We also got an udon each: mentai cream udon, japanese style rich uni udon and spicy chicken miso udon. 

I really enjoyed the okonomiyaki and chicken kara-age as starters. The okonomiyaki had good flavor and wasn't too heavy. I would definitely give it a try since I don't see it at many places. The kara-age was a pretty good size to share (everyone getting 2-3 pieces) and was fried well and had a good tasty batter to it.

The mentai cream udon was good but not the best I've had. The noodles definitely were well done and had a good texture but I have to say the flavor could've been better. I tried a bite of the other udons and thought they were pretty good too. 

I would definitely recommend checking this place out if you're in the area. The food is good and the prices are very reasonable. I will definitely be back to try some of their other starters and udons!",WUbIK69vpDlFnSDgxzB_Kg,0,0,4,1L8HH7iTZrFQrztxGs0x0Q

I'm so impressed that we can have an authentic hand made Udon in this town. 
I ordered Kamaage Udon because that's the most simple way to taste noodles. The texture was literally doughy and sweetness comes out from the flour. Yep, this is the real Udon! 

Tsukedare (dipping source) was very tasty. The fish (Katsuo) broth will tell you that the owner is spending hours and hours to make the soup stock. 
Very simple menu but the most enjoyable dish to taste authentic Udon. 

I as a native Japanese recommend this restaurant! Everything was very nice! Price is very reasonable, too.
I'll definitely come back. ;)

1195940,2017-08-27,0,D6WXf0lB4pfuXZH3P7c5Ow,"We came here for lunch and ordered their lunch combos. Only $9.50 for a udon with 2 toppings, a mini rice bowl, and salad or $10.50 for a rice bowl, a mini udon with 2 toppings, and salad (+ $1 for drink). A very filling and inexpensive meal.

The salad came right away, but the rice and udon took at least 30 minutes to make. The salad was a very refreshing seaweed salad with some lotus roots, sesame, and a hint of ginger. 

The mini rice bowl came around 30 minutes after. The tuna rice had many pieces of tuna which were quite fresh and tasty. The tempura rice was nothing compared to the tempura in Japan. The tempura had a very thick batter which made it very hard. There was so much sauce that all the rice was soaked with the sauce. The chicken teriyaki was a little on the sweet side.

The udon came while we were eating the rice. The udon itself isn't bad, much like the frozen Japanese udon you can buy in the supermarket. The deep fried fish cake wasn't what I expected. It was a piece of sweetened fish cake smothered with something like the tempura batter. Since it was in the soup, all the batter was soggy and wasn't sticking to the fish cake. The deep fried tofu was very sweet, nothing like tofu at all. I personally liked the cold udon more because the sauce used was much better than the broth in the hot udon. 

The server taking our order was helpful and friendly. Saving the worst for last. When we first sat down, the server asked us what we wanted to drink. We asked for some water without ice. The server came back shortly with water WITH ice and while she was putting the water down, she poured an entire glass on my dad. She just said sorry quietly and gave him some napkins. My dad's pants were soaked with water for the entire meal. The water was also all over the floor and the table next to us. The server didn't even bother wiping the tables and only wiped the floors briefly.

Overall, the food isn't very bad for the price, but the servers need to be a little more careful.",qr06IGEdVEIQmyv-NZe-og,2,1,2,bevo_El5P-qfgIhBpXnFug

Food: 
Okonomiyaki (5 stars): very tasty. This dish has veggies and an assortment of seafood. Tastes a lot like takoyaki; it had the same sauce and bonito flakes on top. This is definitely worth a try and is not offered at many japanese spots. 

kaarage (5 stars): came out piping hot. Great marinate and very good fry on the kaarage. Also it was a pretty good portion of chicken.

Spicy chicken miso mix udon hot (4.5 stars): This dish comes hot or cold. I chose to have it hot. Comes with a dollup of minced chicken that's marinated on top laying on a bed of sliced cucumber and topped with thin pieces of nori. Very flavorful and a bit salty and spicy soup broth.

Now for the million dollar question: is marugame monzo better than oodle noodle?

Here was the breakdown:
Uni udon: mainly looked for uni quality and presentation. Both exceeded expectation.

Curry udon: while marugame monzo's curry was savory and heavy, the introduction of the cream inside the curry leaves oodle noodle on top.

Carbonara: Here I felt the opposite. The Carbonara at oodle noodle is delicious and light, but the Carbonara at Marugame Monzo hit you with more flavor that didn't overpower the palate. It's marugame's win here.

Totally different udon bonus round: i get the tiger at marugame and the salmon udon here. Both made me feel the same way for different reasons.

I can say that in terms of food, both are separate but equal. Marugame hit home with heavier flavors while oodle noodle's composition of light flavors are no joke. While I like oodle for its dessert, marugame has shiso tempura. There is no clear winner, and there doesn't have to be. They're both good eats.

Oh, and the food is solid. They have a variety of dishes from noodles (duh) to soups, hot and cold apps/small dishes, and raw fish dishes.

Both are very similar (like specializes in udon and have bar seating where you can watch the chefs hand make them) but I love the variety of food options they offer here and it tastes better (although Marugame is still good).

We have tried their salmon and uni carpaccio , beef tataki , energy bowl (basically a sashimi bowl - salmon , scallops , ikura , uni & seaweed on top of sushi rice) and mentai cream udon. I would personally skip the beef tataki since it was just alright for me but definitely everything with fish and the mentai cream udon is a must order ! The raw fish was super fresh , especially the uni. I've tried the udon dishes at Marugame that had same creamy consistency like the mentai cream udon dish here but I didn't like theirs at all. Our server insisted us to try their mentai cream udon and it was actually the best I tried out of everything here. I also want to note if you order something like the salmon and uni carpaccio or beef tataki , it has a strong wasabi flavor to it.

We also ordered their Japanese ice cream sandwich (green tea & vanilla ice cream w/ fruits and red bean in between pancakes) , apple crepe w/ vanilla ice cream & caramel , and baked matcha cheesecake for desserts & I absolutely loved them all. Entree portions aren't really that big so you can have room for trying out their desserts without being completely stuffed :)

This place took over izakaya cocokala and has been open since April of this year. Indoor now mimicks that of an open kitchen much like most places that feature homemade noodles.

This place is great for lunch time;  combos are pretty filling and reasonable. 

We both got the cold udon with broth with mentaiko and kitsune, mine was a mini. I got the pork bowl since they didn't have shrimp for the tempura bowl and my partner got the salmon poke bowl. For dessert we got the Japanese ice cream sandwich

-The pork bowl was bomb and i was glad I ended up having to choose it. The pork was suuuuper tender. I'm pretty sure it's kakuni, braised pork belly. The sweet soy sauce was not too sweet like teriyaki sweet and it tasted more on the savory side. 

-salmon poke bowl wasn't that great, the cubed pieces of salmon were tiny! As in 1 cm cube small! It didn't come with much either. Salmon was good though, fatty and fresh. It comes as a rice bowl. I wasn't fond of the sauce.

-cold udon was refreshing and average but tasted on the salty side; this was without mixing the mentaiko into the soup. The kitsune fried tofu was seasoned so nicely, loved it. I wasn't too crazy about the noodles, being homemade, they were just okay to me but I'm like that with udon. I would prefer cold udon/soba at another location.

-the daily salad was the least fav of the meal. It was seasoned seaweed with tons of sesame seeds and lotus chips. I couldn't eat it but the bf did not like it

-ice cream sandwich
I was expecting bread lol but this sandwich was comprised of two pancakes! I was definitely surprised, you need utensils for this one. In between was a scoop of vanilla and a scoop if green tea ice cream. The green tea ice cream was quite bitter, but it was a good balance to the vanilla. Overall it was more than enough for two to share.

We had two servers that waited on our tables and the Japanese lady seemed inexperienced but very nice! I asked for no sesame seeds and green onions but my food came out with both lol.. I still ate it without complain. The daily salad also came out after all our food was served.

Service, though it was not busy, was quite slow like when we were waiting to order. Food took a while as well especially the dessert which was peculiar. No refills were offered/made ): 

I'm sure service will improve the next we come at least I hope. We weren't in a rush today but sometimes the wait can get a little frustrating when you don't expect it especially at a place dishing out noodles and bowls. I can say that I prefer this place over Monzo

We'll be back to try the fusion noodles for sure!",mt9mKxvSo1c_8DarT29RGw,1,0,4,CxyM3pa2q9uvcSycn73FdA

The black seaweed salad, salmon and uni and the takoyaki like pancake but with cabbage. All of these apps were so good.

There was no wait but they did have a good amount of patrons. My mom and I were sat near the back of the restaurant by the restrooms. Soo before I get to the food, let me say the restaurant isn't that big. The decor is cute but I think the way the tables and walls are set up could've been better executed. Where we sat, there was a huge wall that blocked us from the main dining area so it was easy for servers to forget us. Now they do have a button (see pic) where you press to get the attention of the servers. Even with the button, I had to press it a few times before we got someone. 

Even with that minor issue, I will still come back because of the food! I seriously have a love obsession with udon. If I see udon on a menu in any restaurant, best bet I will order it. We ordered the grilled squid, kimichi hot pot udon, beef sukiyaki udon, and spicy beef tsukemen. 

1.) Grilled squid: it was cooked perfectly. It wasn't chewy at all. It comes with a side of mayo-based sauce to dip in. I would definitely recommend. 

2.) Kimichi hot pot udon: I was craving kimchi that day and it for sure hit the spot. It had a nice spicy level to it that wasn't overwhelming.

3.) Beef sukiyaki udon: I liked this too! The broth wasn't too sweet. It was actually more on the mild side but had a nice balance to it. 

4.) Spicy beef tsukemen: this was my least favorite. It wasn't spicy. Instead, it was sweet and became too sweet for me after a few bites. 

Bottom line, I would recommend. I will be back to try the other items on the menu!",60skTN6p8SdQ2sGNKL0vRQ,3,1,4,yGvlGJa36PsN57sSkxNYjQ

A tiny shop window, almost invisible from the plaza.
I decided to give it a try yesterday since I was craving something simple, healthy and cheap.
This place perfectly met my three requirements.
- SIMPLE: genuine Japanese food is always a pleasure of simplicity yet with great flavors and tastes. You can see the chefs through the large windows to the kitchen.
- HEALTHY: homemade ingredients make a whole difference. The noodles preparation is a cool show, while waiting for these to land straight into your udon bowl.
- CHEAP: OK, I admit, I wasn't super hungry. I had the fried tofu udon. Hot, with the thick noodles. And a hot green tea. Like... less than 2 miles away from the World-Famous Las Vegas Strip (haha). And guess what? It cost me... $10, tip included. Not bad for a Friday night.

We wanted to do this becuase it offered a bit more variety but was kinda upset that we didn't get a large portion of the pork belly rice because we weren't sure if it would be as good as the udon noodles. Best tasting dish was the pork belly rice bowl and the udon was ok just wanted some protein in there. All tasted very good. 
Lunch special gives you 4 options:
Udon bowl + sides + choice small rice bowl 
Large choice rice bowl + small udon bowl + sides
Large udon bowl + sides + salad

2156687,2018-04-19,0,D6WXf0lB4pfuXZH3P7c5Ow,"Small looking restaurant with a nice interior. Noodles were great. The perfect texture of how I like my homemade udon noodles to taste like. The only complaint I have is that portion sizes are very small. It took me ordering two noodle soups to fill me up. I felt like a fat ass having to reorder after finishing off one bowl. I wouldn't mind paying more per bowl if the portions were larger. It also did take a while for each bowl of udon to come out. And I was one of two tables dining there. 

The service was mediocre. The ladies waitressing were talking to each other nonstop and while I sat at the bar, a wooden wall blocks the view of the waitresses so they were hard to get a hold of and they were not very attentive to guests. They were attentive to each other laughing away... on a Wednesday night there were 4 waitresses/hosts and two tables of guests; me by myself and a couple. That's more than one server per person in here yet service was lacking and we were not being acknowledged! I would not suggest coming if you are in a hurry or are super hungry. But overall the noodles were great. 

For as great a noodle place I feel bad rating this place 3 stars because the noodles really deserve a solid 5. But portion sizes and the neglectfulness of the servers really diminished the experience for me. If I come back and service was better I would rate it 4 stars. Tho I rate it 3 stars I would definitely be back tho. This place really could do better in several ways. What a shame it is to have such a good product but not know how to service your customers better as a result.

We waited 5 minutes to even get waters for just a party of 2. When the server came back she dropped the waters down and immediately left even though we were ready to order. Finally after 10 more minutes of waiting, she finally came back and took our order. We both got the lunch combo; ramen with mini tempura bowl & salad. We got the tempura bowl about 10 minutes after ordering & then our ramen about 5 minutes after that. I was assuming the salad would come out first but decided to wait. After we were almost done, the same server comes back and asks if we got our salads. We said no & she walked away. We were done with our food for some time & were STILL waiting on our salads. I was so over it already & decided to flag down a different server for our bill. I did let her know that if the salad was still coming, we didn't want it anymore. She comp'd us ice cream which I guess made up for it since my bf is a desserts person. We hadn't gotten our waters filled not once during our meal either.
We left semi satisfied, but I won't dock off too many stars since they're still fairly new. I hope that eventually the servers will be more aware of their customers.

(Good noodles but I thought they were going to be hot so completely threw off my balance of the meal). Instead of a broth it comes with a dipping sauce. It is also not spicy by any means. The noodle to protein portion is very skewed. You end up with more noodles than pork. The whole experience was very underwhelming and just left me waiting for my bf to finish eating so I could get the heck out of here. At first I was going to try their Japanese pancake ice cream. But after such a lack of warmth and disappointment in the noodles probably won't come here again. If you're going to try this place out. Don't be a first timer, know what to order or ask. Don't have expectations that it'll be like ramen, because it's not. Just don't have any expectations at all.",yxtwZzmnCYiMatSeT65rAA,0,0,1,NXMv1kZXp_2hud5aqxehLg

Lots of others knew about this event too! The line was really long and we waited over an hour to be seated. The people working here were very thoughtful and brought out iced water for everyone waiting!

After finally being seated, it took a while before we got water or have our order taken. It was understandable as the restaurant was filled and they'd been extremely busy all day. What wasn't okay was that we ordered a total of eight items, but only five arrived, all at a very slow pace. We waited so long for the last three but they failed to arrive. Even after notifying the staff, it was still a long wait and nothing came.

The food that did come was good. We tried their daily special, which included a chef's choice of four items. Everything was fresh each item was unique. My favorite was the clam dish, which was slightly spicy and didn't taste fishy at all despite being served cold. 

We tried two types of udon- cold bukkake and white curry. The cold bukkake noodles were amazing- perfect chewy texture and tasted just right with the light broth. The tempura flakes were fresh fried and provided a nice crunch. I liked the curry and cream broth of white curry noodles but found both the chicken and the noodles to be slightly over cooked. 

Our grilled squid was very tender and smoky from the grill. However it was under seasoned and didn't pair too well with the side of mayo. Okonomiyaki was spectacular- super tasty and stuffed with cabbage and meat. 

I can't rate this restaurant based on this experience alone due to the special event causing it to be much busier than usual, so this review will solely be for the food and the service, which was spectacular despite how busy the restaurant was.

We ended up ordering the beef sukiyaki udon as well as the carbonara udon. I always try carbonara udon at other places and this is my absolute favorite. The egg they put in the carbonara makes the dish! They also have this amazing fresh green tea that tastes incredible. Like other udon spots you can see them making it nice and fresh through the window while you wait for your food.

It took me awhile to order but I finally went with the seared salmon and avocado tar-tar bukkake udon and takoyaki.

The bukkake udon, on the other hand, was cold and left a strange sensation in my mouth. I couldn't detect any type of taste from the dish either but it's maybe because my mouth wasn't having it anymore.

Situated in a little plaza off of flamingo, away from the strip, this place is really good.  

Trying to figure out what to choose, I ended up taking some recommendations from other yelpers. I ordered the spicy cod roe udon, chicken karaage, and beef udon hot pot. 

The hot pot was big enough for two to share with an appetizer. Rich beef stew, it came with cabbage, tofu, mushrooms, and of course, the udon. Very tasty for a cold night. 

The chicken karaage came out freshly fried. It wasn't as crunchy as some but still good enough to crisp. Squeeze the lemon on top of it to make it sweeter, so good. 

Now the spicy cod roe udon was the highlight of this meal. My thought of it was that it has the creamy texture of fettuccine alfredo, but richer and tasted way better. Btw, fettuccine alfredo is my favorite pasta, but I would definitely put it aside for this dish. It's well worth a try.

When I'm sad, I think about how good this udon was and all my worries go away. 

Beef sukiyaki udon is so good too. My second recommendation. It is also a really big portion. They bring it in a pot, and it is built for two. However, if you've got an appetite you can eat the whole thing. If you split for two though, definitely get something else to share on the side, because it won't fill you after splitting it. 

VENUE: Super cute inside. I think it's cute for a date, but please expect to not have personal space like you'd want to have if you went because everyone is so close together.

You can see the process through the window but there is not much excitement to it. It'll just be to reassure that what they make is fresh.

I came here during lunch and got one of their lunch special combos. Each one seems like it's going to be a big meal but it's really not (well to some it is). 

BASEd on what you feel... the first option will be your biggest. For instance, you can choose between 3 options (hot udon, cold udon, or rice). I was more hungry so I got the chicken teriyaki rice bowl. It was ok, just thought it was something I could have made at home.

So I went with the 3rd option. The next item you get is your mini selection. If you got rice you'll get udon and vice versa.

I got the hot udon and with that you get two toppings. I got the seaweed and fish cake. Both not too bad but I didn't think the udon was all that. All the other toppings didn't sound so pleasing and i find it odd that they can have shrimp tempura udon but don't give you an option to select shrimp tempura as a topping for your udon in your lunch combo. 

The most disappointing part about this place is the salad. Each combo will get one... they were very small and not appetizing. 

The service was alright. The server we had was really quick on her feet but they were just so unorganized. Food was dropped off at the table and the server gave the soups to the wrong people... but we ended up being ok with it.",vGjn_E-9rGiqPdJhcBi9og,2,0,3,-WfOX3vRCCnETWV4plqh0A

Oodlebeef: I had high hopes for this because they said it was popular, but it was just okay. The beef was just placed on top of some lettuce, but I could pass on this next time.

Grilled squid: Whatever they grill this squid with was delicious. The dipping sauce was so good too. If you're a squid fan, give this one a try!

Okonomiyaki: Basically a large tayaki. But I was a huge fan of this. I loved it. It was nicely balanced with flavor and definitely a must have. 

Beef sukiyaki udon: I could drink this broth all day. It was so good. It looks huge when you get it, so if you got some appetizers alongside this, I would definitely share it. I'll definitely be back for this.

Service: Our server was nice and attentive, she kept the dishes coming and the drinks fresh.   She'd check on us throughout our visit and gave some good suggestions of new things to try.

Food: I had the Carbonara Udon which was great! Udon, Bacon, cream, oinion, parmesan cheese, butter and a boiled egg.  Very tasty. We tried this shrimp/ebi kind of dumpling with cereal flakes? (see pic)  Forgot the name, but I remembered it was bomb and I'll remember to order it again on the next visit.  The Takoyaki was also tasty and everything we had was made with good ingredients and prepped well.  Chefs had some game...

Value:  Here's where I'm really feeling Oodle Noodle. The Carbonara Udon was only $9.80 and the quality and preparation was great.  Oodle Noodle is kind of like Costco, you come in for some great value Udon, next thing you know all kind of other Japanese plates on the table along with a bunch of beer and Sake.  Yep, it's the Udon's fault I was throwing down beers this visit..  Be careful, but it's a win win no matter what you order for the price..

Ambiance: It's located in a strip mall and from the outside, I would have never guessed the quality of food that would be served.  As soon as you walk in, the restaurant opens up considerably with vaulted ceilings and a lot more sitting area than you would assume.  Not a first date place, but a higher end contemporary casual dining atmosphere? lol.  Great place to come with your foodie friends to catch up, find out one of your bff is 5 months pregnant, and 
 order a bunch of different dishes to try over some sake and beer.

I was pleasantly surprised to discover that this place wasn't just an Udon joint.  Lots of different side dishes to try and a very reasonable price.  Location, Location, Location is great as it's only a couple miles off the strip and very close to the 15 freeway.  This is a Great place to grab a cheap, tasty, Japanese dinner before a night out.

4107114,2017-11-11,6,D6WXf0lB4pfuXZH3P7c5Ow,"Japanese cuisine is awesome, so it's a shame that I've focused on ramen while ignoring another type of noodle. This visit was the first step toward correcting my oversight.

Oodle Noodle is one of the newer udon restaurants to emerge in Las Vegas, a city which certainly has no lack of options for the aforementioned ramen. Similar restaurants devoted to the thicker udon noodle have been sorely lacking in the local scene until the past year or so. Having read plenty of positive Yelp reviews for these relative newcomers, this trip has been far overdue.

This location was a little more convenient than the other popular udon spot for my friend and I after we'd finished phase one of our Friday night plans. It's in a little plaza on the southwest corner of Flamingo and Arville, which contains a motley crew of non-food businesses, an unfamiliar Italian restaurant, and the overrated Umiya Sushi. We arrived during what appeared to be the dinner rush, but we still found seats immediately (and saw the rush abate surprisingly quickly).

I chose the uni udon ($15.80) because I've read trustworthy reviews about it and because I'm a fan of uni, which are the edible parts as well as the reproductive parts of sea urchins. This uni was more briny than I'd anticipated, but it was clean and had to be that strong to hold up to the powerful soy sauce-based broth. Did I mention that this is a cold soup? I can't imagine that strong broth being served hot, and the noodles may have held up better this way too. These were al dente but not too tough, and they were surprisingly ginger-scented. This is a departure from anything which I've eaten before, but despite the unfamiliarity and the price-to-portion ratio, I really liked it.

My friend went for a more traditional wakame udon ($6.50), which is served hot in a seafood-flavored broth. You'll barely find any protein here, but the broth is so enjoyable that it doesn't matter. The noodles were not quite as al dente, but it still worked in the brief tastes that reached my mouth.

The restaurant also boasts a variety of non-udon foods. My friend and I both have an interest in finding good takoyaki ($5.00/6 pc.), so we ordered it. I would profess that the recipe here is above average but is still not worth a repeat order. Although it was creamy and even came out hot enough to make some of the bonito flakes dance, I found the tako (octopus) a little too tough. Also, my friend pointed out that they didn't add a requisite dried seaweed topping, which surely would've added at least a little depth of flavor.

I'd definitely come back to Oodle Noodle in a heartbeat. This is one of the times where I strongly feel the need for the ""half star"" to give a 4.5 star rating, and I've reluctantly erred on the side of 4 due to my small concerns about my particular meal. Perhaps I'll come around to a confident 5 after revisits or after taking in other udon experiences.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,12,11,4,k21vcZJsyi-Bro8Zj9GBkw

We pick large rice with small udon, when we got the order, I was in shock....they are honest about the ""large bowl"", but the inside barely filled up 1/3 of the bowl, and they call it a large?

* SW corner of Flamingo & Arville

What (I like)
* My favorite dish here is the Chicken Karaage Bukakke Udon with tartar sauce. All of the Udon dishes here are excellent but I always want something more to fill me up than the basic Kake udon. This one has delicious fried chicken, a small salad with tartar sauce sitting upon the bed of udon noodles so it's almost like two dishes in one. I also don't feel super bad about eating it as I would about eating say a cream based udon.

Why (the rating) 
* There are 2 other Udon places in Vegas which I highly recommend but what I think sets Oodle Noodle apart is the accessibility of the place. What the heck does he mean? Of the 3 Udon restaurants, Oodle Noodle is the easiest to find in terms of location and parking BY FAR. It is such a PITA to find parking at the other two restaurants. Oodle Noodle also has a very reasonably priced menu with a lot of familiar dishes as well as specialty udon dishes should you decide to feel adventurous. Really high up my priority list is also if a place is kid friendly and I would say of the 3 restaurants, Oodle Noodle is the most kid-friendly.

They're cooked perfectly with some bite into them that give them this wonderful chewy texture. Also amazing takoyaki. They also have a large menu consisting of various takes on udon to chose from.

4347809,2017-06-20,0,D6WXf0lB4pfuXZH3P7c5Ow,"Before I walked into the restaurant they had a display window outside where there was fake food and the price of the dishes. I thought it was a good idea so if people didn't know what they were going to eat they would get an idea. The decorations inside was very cozy and place was clean. I love the chairs because they were soft because my skinny butt needs cushion. I sat at the counter because I went to try their lunch special. You can watch the chef prepare your dishes at the counter because there's a glass screen. Their menus are Big in size so you can see the dishes and the prices well. I like their lunch special because it let me try the udon and the rice bowl with their salad of the day. They give you lots of choices which I like. 
I really like the bowls and dishes they use to serve your udon and rice in. The udon noodle dish came with a big spoon. I love the concept here and the food is really good. I got the hot udon bukkake with the salmon poke bowl. Their service here was good! I read the other reviews before I came and I guess customers were complaining about the service but I got great service when I came here for lunch. 
The udon was Fresh and tasty. I would bring my friends here to let them try. I highly recommend if you're an udon fan to come try this place.",lQBZo8_mm80dbwI5bo5c_w,0,0,5,IuIxeHCXlP9M6xYk77_WFQ
4352962,2017-11-14,0,D6WXf0lB4pfuXZH3P7c5Ow,"So I have an obsession with finding the best udon in las Vegas because my trips to California spoiled me,  and many places here try and fail.   The very first time I went here I felt like the establishment was modern and nicely set up, they even have a whole glass separation where you can watch the chefs prepare your noodles from scratch.  There is a bar seating option so you can observe them,  like a live food network.   The menu is extensive and actually the size of them is comically large,  you can play hide and go seek with your dinner mates.   However, the service was a bit of a train wreck.   They had been open only a month and it seemed like it was the first day our server had ever served in his life,  lots of order mix ups,  and timing issues were occurring not with just us, but with every table around us.   However, because the sukiyaki udon my friend had (which is basically a Niku udon) was so freaking delicious,  I decided I would come back later when they had time to work out the kinks.  

So the next time I went everything went much smoother.   Now the last time I had personally ordered the tempura udon which I had found a bit basic and bland (unlike yu yus which I truly wish would open back up again).   Now I wanted that amazing sukiyaki udon all to myself.   The portion is very large compared to most places.   The noodle chew is on point,  broth super flavorful,  a good serving of beef as well.   Currently my favorite bowl of udon in the valley!

I'm excited to try their uni udon,  the first time I went I had wanted to order that,  but they were out of uni because apparently a whole group of uni fanatics whiped them out the prior day. 

The chicken karage is pretty text book,  nothing to write home about.  They really need another dip,  I think they literally served it with mayo. Also their salmon poki bowl was a bit salty the first time I went, but that one bowl of udon makes up for all of it. 

I will be back soon for sure to explore the menu further, and get me my uni!",XYZw8rWQ0wjMWQChRCU8Hg,3,1,4,MWx1uoVq6iEgJ2hnBaEdfA

4395469,2017-08-29,5,D6WXf0lB4pfuXZH3P7c5Ow,"Stumbled upon this place after looking for udon places that were open in the afternoon.  It's located in the same plaza as Umiya.  

It's nice that you are also able to watch the chef at work while you are at your seats.  We ordered the beef tataki appetizer, uni udon, and spicy pork udon.  

Beef tataki - I would pass on this.  It isn't raw beef, it was more like roast beef deli meat on a bed of salad with a drizzle of wasabi mayo and ponzu sauce.  I mean, it wasn't horrible.. it just isn't beef tataki.  

Uni Udon - I have been wanting to try this for the longest time and I finally got to sample their take.  Mmm it was delicious!!  It was my first time trying cold udon. I loved how delicate the broth was and the consistency of the noodles.  There was 2-3 pieces of uni on top of the udon and the uni was fresh and went so well with all the components of the dish.  I would definitely order this again.  I thought the portion was on the smaller side for the price, but I was stuffed at the end of the meal.

Spicy Pork Udon - My boyfriend ordered this and I was able to snag a bite.  The broth is served on the side.  It was also very favorful, without being overly spicy.  He usually doesn't have cold noodles, but he admitted that it was pretty tasty.  

The server was very attentive, coming every couple of minutes to check on our drinks.  I also saw that they have an awesome deal for lunch.  I'll have to come back to try it! But I am a fan of their noodles.  Just skip the beef tataki and you're golden.",z4RytucxI_XfcMFaEI2DRg,13,9,4,OKYhEfWaRq2ExC8sgrltRQ

Boooooom.

Order a bunch of things and share.

The noodles are of course amazing. Super fresh. I got the Uni one and that was bomb. My dad got the tempura udon and he seemed to like it. We also got the Mentaiko cream one and that was yummy too. 

We had one of their basic salads (Chawan Salad) and at first I was like that's it? Cause the server recommended it. But then we ate it and we couldn't stop. A subtle sesame flavor with just a touch of salt. Reflection of a good chef that knows restraint in flavoring and knows that you don't always have to go wild with ingredients, if you can achieve an umami flavor with simplicity. I feel like current cuisine is getting too fancy sometimes for their own good (with the exception of Americana, farm to table). I guess it makes sense this is Japanese cuisine, which traditionally really highlights the basic form. Woah I sound like a food historian and not some jerk that just likes to eat. But no bright lights vegas baby in this salad. Ok moving on....

Yeah dude we had some tasty tempura. Agadashi tofu was on point (not on the menu). We had a chicken dish with sauce on it. Like a tartar sauce. Not my fav dish of the night. 

This place deserves to be busier though. Hard to find great udon anywhere. I live in LA and there's 3 spots that do Udon well and they're all over town and have long waits. As soon as this secret is out, it should get packed.",qc1CYNRValSIHBRKodT_fg,3,2,5,qPq3jL8PN7i62iMnFkRTwA
4554363,2017-10-08,0,D6WXf0lB4pfuXZH3P7c5Ow,"A couple friends and I came here after seeing all the other rave reviews from fellow Yelpers. It's located in a strip mall next to the Palms sort of in the corner. Once you walk in it's very nicely decorated, very sleek and modern design. There's also a button at the table to call over a waiter once you're ready to order or for service.

For food we shared the Grilled Squid to start. The portion size was huge & the squid was nicely cooked. I also enjoyed the mayo for dipping which came with it. I would have never thought to put mayo on squid before, but it was actually pretty good. (4/5) For an entree I had the Mentai Cream Udon. The flavor was excellent, almost like an Alfredo sauce and not super fishy at all. I could probably eat this everyday of my life and be completely okay with it. (5/5)

The only reason I have to give them a 4 star rather than 5 was them being out of two different drinks we had originally ordered. It seemed a little unprofessional to run out of drinks that are on the menu.

Either way I will definitely be back here again for the Mentai Cream Udon and maybe try of the fresh poke bowls too. So glad we found this place!",OXSJCjKtvZPf-YPDCXcWZg,2,1,4,onMYMjiVt8-Q2WDXe8OeDA

I had the shrimp tempura. The udon noodles were great. The noodles had a nice texture and cooked perfectly. Soft and chewy and not overcooked like other places. The broth was light and refreshing. Also came with this mini ladle as your spoon which i thought was cute.

After trying Cafe Sanuki for the first time, my friend then suggested this place for me to try next.

I've been a few time and have enjoyed both the normal menu and their lunch special menu.

For the normal menu, the portions are definitely enough to get me full. Do I need to do a full portion of Udon and then an order of rice bowl AND a rice ball? No but the portions are deceiving that you should only do a full Udon dish and a rice ball, but not all three haha. Especially for those that complain that the portions are small. I would usually ask for a second round of noodles but I definitely don't need to here. My next items to try are the fusion udons.

It's fun and interesting to watch your Udon noodle being made fresh by the chef, just like the Chinese noodle houses. Not much flare going on but definitely worth while to see your food being prepared for you, like you would at a buffet with a live action chef station.

For me, I would always add a shrimp, mushroom and another vegetable tempura if I need an extra crunchy texture to my meal. 

Rice balls I've tried were salmon and the mentaiko (roe). Salmon was not as flavorful but definitely the mentaiko for me is the winner. I might eventually try the plum.

As for the lunch special, I've done the cold udon, a small rice ball and 2 tempura items. Just know these are half portions it seems, so definitely add a rice ball to get you definitely full. Otherwise, it is a steal! Get there before 3pm to enjoy this lunch special.

Wow, this is such an amazing place, coming here for lunch is such a great experience. I came in here about 1:00 pm and got greeted right away. We were seated right away and got our menus. I choose the lunch combo which is worth it for its price. For the lunch combo, you are offered at a price of 9.95 a choice of ramen, sides with the ramen, small rice with whatever choice you want, and house salad to along with everything. They all tasted really good and filled up my stomach, enough for desserts to spare. 

Pro: 
- Good choice of ramen and rice
- Affordable prices 
- Salad and ramen tasted really good 
- Recommend the salmon poke bowl, tasted really good and they have good portions of that 
- Great staff that are helpful

I went here with a group of friends to celebrate the restaurant's 1-year anniversary because they were offering 50% off everything. However, I think their prices are still affordable despite the discount. 

Anyways, we waited a little over an hour to be seated, but it was definitely worth the wait. Also, the staff was kind enough to constantly check on the line and serve us ice cold water considering the Las Vegas heat. 

Our server, Evangeline V., was very friendly and took our orders right away. She also checked on us frequently ensuring that our waters were filled and that we were doing great. Together, my boyfriend and I, ordered takoyaki, edamame, the tuna poke bowl, the kimchi hot pot udon, and beef sukiyaki udon. 

The takoyaki was so delicious we ended up ordering another one after we finished the first one. The tuna poke tasted fresh and the serving was a good amount for its price. As for the udon, this is probably the best udon I've had thus far in the Las Vegas heat. The udon noodles are made fresh inside the restaurant every day, and they are thick, soft yet sturdy and just overall, delicious. Not only are the noodles delicious, but the broth is flavorful. The sukiyaki was a perfect amount of sweetness and the kimchi hot pot had a tolerable spiciness to it.

5314304,2017-12-04,0,D6WXf0lB4pfuXZH3P7c5Ow,"My first visit,  I hated this place.
I ordered this udon that comes in a pot.
There wasn't much food in it at all and it was super salty.
It's not salt they add, its just MSG for that umami.
MSG isn't really harmful but it is a lot of sodium so still be careful.

When you come here, portions are small.  like snack small.
You can literally count you got about 10 strands of noodle in there.
My wife is barely over 100 pounds and its not enough for her.
It wasn't until I asked about getting extra noodle.

They'll do it for 2 bux,  so getting the mentaiko or carbonara suddenly becomes totally worth the money.  Its made well, tastes good and filling.
Now I gotta be honest.  The Udon is just so-so compared to Tokyo Town.

But in Vegas, it's probably the best, because c'mon, outside of eating at the Bellagio, food sux here. There's only a handful of gems like Lotus of Siam or Pizza Rock that we all agree is good.

Every other restaurant you might think is good, I simply ask you.
Have you tried it outside of Vegas?  For example.
You like some pizza place,  ever had it Manhattan Pizza?
You like some BBQ Joint, ever had BBQ in Memphis?
You like some Chinese Place, Ever been to Hong Kong?
You like this Pho place, Ever Been to Westminster?

5337049,2018-04-14,0,D6WXf0lB4pfuXZH3P7c5Ow,"Throughout Las Vegas, there are a number of emerging Japanese restaurants that offer dishes aside from ramen and sushi. Oodle Noodle is one of them! This is hands down one of my favorite restaurants - the service is on point, the food is on point, the ambiance is on the point, and even the location is on point. 

Service - Everyone here is always very friendly and attentive. In the instance that you are seated in the back booths, there's a button that you can press to alert the servers that you need something. You're treated the same regardless if there's zero customers in the restaurant or fifty. Everyone is very knowledgeable about the menu items and always ready to give suggestions with a smile. 

Food - I have never had a bad dish here. The Udon broth is so, so yummy. My favorite one is the Kim Chi Udon (w/o pork). There's so much flavor in the soup regardless of which udon you order. I'm not a meat eater; however, everyone I have been here with loved the beef sukiyaki. The poke bowls are delicious too if you're not craving soup. I would highly recommend the salmon & avocado poke bowl or the tuna & avocado. You can even ask them to combine both if you're feeling indecisive. The portion sizes are huge and will definitely leave your stomach feeling satisfied. There's also appetizers with my favorite being the chicken karage (it's only five dollars too!) Or the takoyaki (also only five dollars)! 

Ambiance - Very intimate restaurant with nice decor. It definitely does not correlate with the low price that
 you're paying for the yummy food.

Location - Very convenient and close to the freeway and Las Vegas Boulevard. It's in a strip mall on Decatur and Arville (near the Palm's Place). There's always plenty of parking spaces! They have late business hours so this is definitely a good place to go if you're nearby and looking for a midnight snack.",52FeOAXrqwKuwZXmH5q_fw,0,0,5,-NPXl7bDoYIpyqwkVTWXHA
5349139,2017-06-30,3,D6WXf0lB4pfuXZH3P7c5Ow,"Hello Oodle Noodle. Welcome to the udon scene. Don't worry, there's not much competition in town for that so you're relatively safe.

Oodle Noodle is a restaurant that specializes in udon, which is perfect because we need more of those places. I love having udon. What makes this place different from Marugame, you ask? Well, first of all, Oodle Noodle provides a much bigger variety as far as menu items. The udon quality is about the same to me so whichever place you go, you still win.

The plaza for Oodle Noodle is much easier for parking the both times I've come for dinner. They're never busy -- we always got sat right away whenever we went. Oodle Noodle used to be a Japanese tapa place. I think they just re-branded the establishment because they still have a TON of items on their appetizer menu.

We've tried their grilled chicken thighs, white wine steamed clams, and a mentaiko onigiri. Their grilled chicken thighs were pretty simple and it actually tasted a tiny bit bitter due to the charcoal and it's seasoned lightly with ponzu sauce. The white wine steamed clams were really yummy. The clams were decently sized and they were flavored really well! Except they only give you about eight clams and the dish was about $9. A little bit pricy. Their onigiri was yummy :) I think it would be great if they had an option for the rice to be cold. I'm so used to the ones I get at supermarkets haha!!!

For their udons, we've tried the japanese uni udon (cold), salmon avocado udon (cold), wakame udon (cold), and kimchi hot pot udon (hot). Their udon is fantasic -- al dente, with just the right amount of chew to it. All their broths were light and complimented well with the udon. 

The best thing about Oodles Noodles is that they offer cold udon. During these super hot summers in Las Vegas, cold udon is simply refreshing. Their udon is also fairly priced. Depending on which udon you get, they range from $6-16ish. Our wakame udon, which was just udon and seaweed, was only about $6-7. I mean, sure, it's cheaper to buy a packet of udon at a super market and make it yourself but that would require you to cook and clean. Who has time for that when you sometimes work 10 hour days?!!

Do yourself a favor and go to Oodles Noodles. Get a cold udon and enjoy the refreshing feel of goodness. I would definitely be back for their noodles.",oqTZC9WriodTCby6jl0LfQ,7,3,5,1_eTt8TUzsfCEcxPUXm5yw

5401453,2017-08-13,0,D6WXf0lB4pfuXZH3P7c5Ow,"I decided to try this place out as it made one of the 15 hot places to try in Vegas for August 2017. Whoever claimed this place is a must try and allowed it to make the must try list is either helping a buddy out or has a strange taste in good food. This place is a disappointment. I wanted to see what made this restaurant make the list at there is no way this is a top restaurant for Las Vegas.
I love Udon and I've had it many places. This place was just confusing. To begin with, we ordered a berry sake that showed a can of sake on the menu. When it came to us, it was a small glass of jelly sake like a Jell-O shot. Why in the world the menu did not have the actual picture of what you were getting rather than a whole can of sake is beyond me!
The shrimp shumai was good and that was the only thing I can say was decent at this restaurant. I went ahead and ordered a cold udon dish which comes with sweet potato tempura and shrimp tempura. It also comes with mushroom tempura. When it got to me, I was confused. Where was the cold bowl of udon? Actually, the tempura, including the sweet potato and shrimp and mushroom, came in a separate bowl. The sauce for the tempura was in its own bowl. The udon was bland noodles on a big rock of ice and I was told that I need to dip these in the same sauce I dip the tempura in and that's how I eat it. Very average to below average and I would never order this again. I really like cold udon but this was just bland and boring. My friend ordered a cold udon dish with shrimp and it was also bland.
At this point, I wanted the check. We ended up going somewhere else to get something. I would never come here again and was grossly disappointed. Part of the problem could be that our waitress was very nice, but it seems like she barely spoke English, which likely caused her not to be able to tell us what we were ordering.
I did not let anyone at the restaurant know how underwhelmed I was as I knew I would be reviewing it. It wasn't horrible so I'm giving it two stars but it's not deserving of three stars.",leY7FqJ3NKPzpM5awAQ2-Q,0,1,2,bdRToxyU9YlIm_q5F1Ogog

This was my first time here and I wanted to eat some noodles and my cousin said to try Oodle Noodle. At first I thought it was some fancy schmancy store but it not. The restaurant is small (like super small). 

I ordered the Okonomiyaki (appetizer) and the Shrimp Tempura Udon, while Chicken Kara-age Tar-Tar Bukkake Udon. The chefs hand make the Udon noodles fresh and it was definitely yummy. Portion doesn't look to big but they are seriously filling. 

Big bonus: cheap!!! Each bowl of Udon are under $10, so it's definitely a great place to eat at when you have a budget in Vegas.",7-EFC0ldH2qDau7sMN4bTQ,3,1,5,B3rnCvtKtPZhQUpu3MoE7g

Awwright!  I picked up my girlfriend and had my sibling come with me to this celebration.  I told them that there can be a 30 minute wait just to get in the door just because of the special and we were all okay with that.  We got there at 7:00pm. 
 Whilst outside,  A male server were serving us all ice cold green tea and ice cold water and that was so nice for them. 
Unfortunately, the man came out once more and exclaimed to everyone that he can only take 25 people in and everyone after will be turned away because they ran out of noodles.  He said they ran out of noodles becuase they extended the 50% off deal to take out orders.  At 7:30pm my party of three made it in!  We were seated on the far black booth on the corner by our server and the manager. 
 We placed our order of beef sukiyaki udon, two orders of takoyaki, chicken Kara-age bowl, chicken Teriyaki bowl,  salmon poke bowl, tuna poke bowl.  The female server read it back and around 7:50pm we got one of two orders takoyaki balls. Around 8:30pm we asked where is our other takoyaki balls and we got it around 8:40pm.  
We waited and waited until 10:30pm, a server came around and asked ""Are you done eating, did you order?""  I said we waited for 2.5 hours and we didn't get our meals yet.  The manager came out and said ""I will make things right!""  She 10:50pm we got our udons and our two poke bowls.  Mind you everyone after us they were all fed and left already.  
11:30pm rolled around, I pressed the buzzer for service and I asked where is our chicken Kara-age bowl and our chicken Teriyaki bowl?  The server said ""Oh, we didn't make your order because we ran out of chicken!""  
Upon leaving, my girlfriend stated they didn't give any effort to make our time there right.  They should have made the 50% off special only for dine in guests only.    The beef sukiyaki udon was spot on, the kimchee udon was overpowering with old kimchee and it made the broth sour. Takoyaki balls plate came with six pieces and it too was delicious. My little brother stated his shrimp udon was good but, can use more vegetables.  We left around 1am.  Wow, I was real disappointed in this one.",DsVnd4PH2nkbxo8UeGW3Mw,1,1,1,e-oCq9ZfvZETc-Y5GsVeRQ
5945809,2017-05-10,0,D6WXf0lB4pfuXZH3P7c5Ow,During our visit to vegas this past weekend we came across this place while we were looking for noodle soup place. We decided to give this place a try. Sure enough we were not disappointed. The udon noodles were freshly made there and the flavor was so delish. We were there for 4 nights and had 2 meals out of the 4 nights we were there. Definitely give this place a try you won't be disappointed. The price is very reasonable and the portion is good size.,5TrL2F8QzYF2IDOx_RRoDQ,0,1,5,ly8iPOxGQtAc_w_jGyOSnQ
5954489,2017-06-03,3,D6WXf0lB4pfuXZH3P7c5Ow,"The food was delicious but the service was terrible.

I had the uni udon which was delicious! The udon was cooked perfectly and the uni was sweet and savory. I enjoyed the food very much.  They have a lunch special which is great also! You can get udon, a bowl, and a salad for about $10. It's a good deal! My friends and I tried 3 different desserts together. We had the ice cream sandwich, the panna cotta, and the baked matcha green tea cheesecake. The ice cream sandwich was probably the best out the three because it had a yummy either brown sugar or honey sauce on it. The panna cotta was good too, but it lacked some flavor. The earl grey sauce that was supposedly on it, was indistinguishable. The cheesecake was dry and flavorless. So 2/3 on the desserts. 

The service was terrible. They never checked up on us to ask if everything was okay. We literally have to call them over just to get a water refill and our checks. They were too busy talking to each other at the front. I honestly think they're nice people but they should try to check on their customers so we don't have to call for them from across the room to get some service. 

I might try them again because the food was good.",ZsjuEgOdvx9l5GKZdtwYIw,5,5,3,mS3L7VgnXmSMqqDKHc2H0g
5966627,2017-05-24,0,D6WXf0lB4pfuXZH3P7c5Ow,"This place was hard to find as the Outside sign is in white block and ""Oodle Noodle"" is written really small against it. It is in the plaza across (south west) from Palms. The ambience is very nice and setup like traditional Japanese style. Mostly black interior with black wooden seats, black wood facade tables, and creative lamps made from Japanese umbrellas make this place modern and nice to sit and dine.  Can see the cook make your dishes behind a big glass wall. I came for the one of the pictures posted but it wasn't the accurate dish from this place...luckily they did make that plate and I posted the correct plate. It was the salmon roe Udon plate...Very Delicious! I also ordered the  fried balls with squid inside and that was delicious too! Best of all it was only $5!! My friend ordered the beef sukiyaki udon and it was his new favorite. It comes in a pot that looks like the ones used for open camp fires...very unique!  (Also pictured). I'll definitely go back to this place again and again. Best is they are open later than other places.",TXbIl_9ogHdALGlqYl3NvA,1,0,5,ho00vgxhX9vACz_QEORBDg
