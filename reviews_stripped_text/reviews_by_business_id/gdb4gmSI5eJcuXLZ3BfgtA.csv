Nevertheless I actually think it's pretty funny.  
Ok, the food is really not too bad. Actually for the amount of food you get for your money is really good. Most take-out places don't even allow you to take soup to go, but they offer you 2 choices and package everything up for you. I usually get the dinner special, It usually comes with whatever you order, i.e. kung pao chicken, soup, rangoons, rice, and sweet and sour chicken. 
I have yet to try the Thai portion of the menu, but I would suspect it wouldn't be as good as the Chinese? That will be for another day.",FWHbXUCndMVogI5EuH_TTQ,0,1,3,DJT2Z2VIoOxUL8-GYPSmug

We ordered the ""large"" general chicken and pork fried rice. I'll start with the pork fried rice. It was okay. Thoroughly mediocre. Not terrible, not great. Wouldn't even say it was good. I think Panda's fried rice is better and honestly you could make it just as good at home. 

The big failure of this meal was the chicken. First, large? Really? There was maybe ten pieces of chicken total. Ten pieces of chicken that were thickly coated in some fried goop that within minutes becomes soggy and nasty, separating from the chicken itself resulting in small tidbits of chicken and a shit ton of yucky, soggy, fried dough that tastes like old funnel cake with some random sauce on it. I like fried food, I really do, but if Jacky Chan wants to be more honest they should put this on the menu as fried dough coated in general sauce served with a minuscule amount of chicken. 

Save your money. Go to Panda, make your own, just skip this place unless you're desperate or have a coupon.",t5nkLYfi7spS8uvX-eRLag,2,0,2,RFQQryms8EaMmWnlgf2Gnw

I ended up being applicable for spring rolls, and an upgraded order of my crab rangoons.

The food isn't awful, but is absolutely lacking in originality and soul. I get it, it's americanized chinese food. But taste is important, and the flavors before were so, so good. The recipe the old Jacky Chan owners had for Wor Wonton Soup was unbelievably astounding. As was every other recipe we tried. The broth was out of this world, tasted like it was made with real bones and meat in the broth. The new soup: broth is flavorless and bland, the extra veggies are nice, but it's SO not the same. We also ordered a combination veggie/meat dish to go with our soup, and the result was the same. A complete lack of flavor. We are so, SO sad to see our beloved Jacky Chan change into new hands. New owners: I wish you the best of luck, but please: secure those original recipes, or consult with an actual chef who can teach the ways of the broth.

Something you should know: Least greasy Chinese food I've ever ordered. 

Target Audience: NOT somewhere you take a date. Somewhere you take your spouse after you have lived together forever and have seen them burp at the dinner table. This place is great for the lazy person, or the person too sick to get out of bed.

Food: Non-Authentic Chinese. (but i'm okay with that!)

Food Price: Under $10. Their lunch special is around $6, dinner special is $9.50. Each comes with sweet sour chicken, one choice of entree, crab ragoon, fried rice, and choice of soup. Add a Boba drink for $3.50! There are 24 different flavors, on ice or blended as a slushy. Lots of food for the price, it takes me about 2 sittings to finish. Because there is so much variety, I don't get sick of it by the second day. I always have leftovers. Enough food for a guy though. This is as healthy as Chinese food is going to get. Yes, the food is smothered in sauces like panda express, but it's not as greasy. They use lean white chicken breasts for all their chicken dishes and they cook with crisp fresh vegetables. When I'm hunting for delivery yet attempting to be healthy, I order Shrimp & Snow peas off the regular menu. Not as much variety as the Lunch/Dinner Special. But it's the same price, clean, simple, Low-carb, Less-sodium.

Ambiance: Mom & Pop, hole in the wall :)

Cleanliness: SPOTLESS! There is definitely nothing fancy about this place, but you can see that the kitchen and seating area is clean. They are always wiping their counters, tables, chairs. Wet towel, dry towel. I've NEVER sat at a wet table or chair. No drips on their soy sauce ramekins. I've seen their employees wash their hands multiple times. They get a extra star from me just for that. I'm all about hole in the wall places that are clean.

At first I thought ok well I guess it's my fault for ordering Thai food at a Chinese place but then again even the Chinese food was horrible. I'm not sure what happen that made this place go from bad to worst but it did. 

I order the Thai Mint Chili thinking it was going to be the ground meat with mint stir fry. I was wrong. I order port with curry ""Sauce"" that should've been the first red flag and a big give away and the beef and broccoli. Then there was the combo app and they got the pot stickers wrong. How can you get pot stickers wrong! Ugh. I ended up throwing everything away. 

The egg rolls were super skinning with almost nothing in it but it had a decent Chinese five spice flavor to it. The pot stickers tasted stale like they have been microwaved too long and then deep fried if that. 

The pork with curry sauce was Chinese BBQ pork and some package curry sauce. What the heck why wasn't it regular pork. I never even imagine they would use that pork. But even if they did use regular pork it wouldn't have made up for the big let down. The Thai Chili woof I don't even know what that was. Weird favor and no mint in sight. 

The beef and broccoli....really it had the worst bitter taste to it and the meat had this weird tasted almost like propane and Oyster sauce only. My wife and I stop eating everything completely in fear of you no the F.P. Cross my fingers I'll be ok tonight! 

I guess there was a reason why we stopped coming to this place, I was getting burnt out with Rice and Noodle, dang it I should've stuck to what I know was good!",YLeDSZ1Nh1N0hNsSyQdE3A,7,5,1,Jo5kObotMfjZcrpSpJgXyg

Ok... To the review.

My sweet and Sour Chicken came with hardly any vegetables and the sauce was off. I can't put a finger on it, but it wasn't right. The wonton soup had too many tasteless vegetables and not enough broth. the crab Rangoon was tasteless and had almost zero filling. The egg rolls are micro-small. 

I gave this review three stars because if you order over 30 bucks worth of food, they throw in a free chicken fried rice, which wasn't that bad. 

So if you go here, just order the chicken fried rice, k?

I opted for eating in so as to get the hottest freshest food possible. I also ordered from the whiteboard specials menu. These options are usually all spicy, wish they didn't have everything on special be spicy and an extensive menu otherwise. For the price at $9.50 for a regular combo, they better serve ginormous portions. Granted, they are pretty much the only game in this area for Chinese food. They have to compete with good Chinese restaurants that are downtown that have prices for food ranging from $3.50 to $4.50.

I had the udon noodles with chicken as the special, but it only came with the noodles & chicken, after my waitress said the special was the same as the combo and would include everything. There definitely was an understanding barrier, but she was nice. They did make the meal the way I wanted with the spicy sauce on the side.

I had just tried another Chinese restaurant last week that had good specials served all day, several courses for less than what I paid for here.

The wonton soup was hot and just right. Very well prepaired. The waitress served it in the proper manner as any high-end resturant would do. The bbq pork rice was prepaired perfectly. Not too flakey or compressed. All entres were exceptional, including the chow mein.

When we were finished, they offered to box the leftovers for us and did so promply.

I've only been once, and had the Pad Thai.  I enjoyed it very much. It was served with a slice of lemon (YES!) which I squeezed over the dish and it brought out beautifully subtle and well balanced flavors.

The bottom line is this: Is this place going to revolutionize the way you view Asian Cuisine?  No.  But is that what they are trying to do?  NOPE.  They want to provide a decent meal at a reasonable price and try to make a living along the way.

4089633,2015-01-22,4,gdb4gmSI5eJcuXLZ3BfgtA,"We've been in the area for a few months now and really needed to find a decent Chinese restaurant that delivers to us, which being in a new development in an underdeveloped area the choices are pretty scarce. So, we had two options, Jacky Chan and XO; after reading the reviews here on Yelp we decided on Jacky Chan's. Since we were driving by, we figured we would stop in and try them out for when we wanted Chinese delivery. Our bill came to a little over $53 and let me tell you that the food wasn't worth half that! We ordered the combination appetizer platter, 2 extra eggrolls, sweet and sour pork, beef with snow peas, general chicken, chicken pad thai and beef chow mein. Because the order was over $50 we had a choice of free items and the only thing that we liked from the offerings was crab rangoon. To keep this brief I'll give a quick rundown: 
1. All of the fried items had a horrible old taste, I'm assuming it was due to the fryer oil since everything was made to order. 
2. The eggrolls were thin and mostly wrapping no real filling to speak of
3. Crab rangoon was ice cold, and did not actually have very much crab in the filling mix.
4. Sweet and sour pork was rock hard, even our dogs turned their noses at them 
5. Threw the chicken pad thai out! After two bites I was afraid it was spoiled because of the God awful sour taste and smell, even the color was an off orange. I've had pad thai from many places and have never seen anything like what they offered. 
6. The general chicken had barely a taste to it other than the old fryer oil taste, the sauce wasn't enough to even mask the stale taste. 
7. Beef chow mein wasn't the best but it was edible, though rubbery and oily. 
8. The only dish that we liked was the beef and snow peas, it was hot and had a lot of taste. If it wasn't for this and the chow mein we would have been ordering a pizza.

4655187,2016-06-26,10,gdb4gmSI5eJcuXLZ3BfgtA,"Jackie Chan is not in the house, But.... 

   Jackie Chan is one of a couple Chinese restaurants alongside Blue Diamond Road (Nevada Route 160) in Mountains Edge. It is a short drive from Exploration Park where I had just done some hiking. 

   After hiking in Exploration Park in this hot June afternoon I was up for some Chinese food. I headed to XO to find out that they are closed for refurbishment. In hopes of enjoying some Chinese food, Jackie Chan would come to the rescue. After typing in ""Chinese food"" Jackie Chan appeared. Henceforth I headed .06 east on Blue Diamond to the Walgreens - McDonald's shopping center at Durango. 

  The parking spaces seemed to be tight and few. I was left to park my car by McDonald's. 

  When I walked inside I looked at the lunch special board on the right wall. The lunch specials started at $5.95. They included an entree, fried rice, a sweet and sour chicken, crunchy noodles, and egg drop soup. In my opinion this is a better deal than the place I parked my car by. 

  Jackie Chan seems to have a popular take out business. The man working at the counter was engrossed with take out phone calls before getting to my order. With an additional fountain Coke, I opened my wallet and handed him close to $8.

  From there I seated myself at one of the few tables. I observed that this is a take out restaurant with the staff delivering the food, first round of Coke, and cleaning up the food. Moreover, I observed that Jackie Chan is not in the house. I saw zero pictures, articles, or memorbelia celebrating Jackie Chan. But I did see the Chinese food on my table. 

  Jackie Chan isn't a styrophone and plastic takeout style Chinese restaurant. They serve the soup, food, and drinks on real china. The food that they served me on this real china was ok and nothing to write home about. The egg drop soup and crunchy noodles that proceeded the meal were decent. Ditto for the pepper steak with onions, one sweet and sour chicken, and fried rice. What stood out about Jackie Chan besides the name is that it is the first Chinese restaurant where the lunch special included a sweet and sour chicken. 

   After a hike in Exploration Park, the lunch special got the job done. My opinion of Jackie Chan the Chinese Restaurant is that it is decent but not great.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,11,10,3,DqP7yNCQ-iw2rDqv_wXRyw

The lady that I talked to didn't speak any good English at all, I had to tell her my address so many times and i told her what I ordered I made it so clearly. 
Anyways, the delivery was really fast but when I started to check my food and was about to take a big ass sip on my soup I see a freakin shrimp umm I'm allergic to shrimp like I almost ate that thing! I called them back and this time it was a guy and I told him that they messed up my order and he wasn't really nice about it and I told him to get it right and send me the right one. After 45 minutes later of waiting he finally came and got the order right but I felt very skeptic to even eat my soup cause they seem very shady but I ate it anyway and now I'm sick.

He would probably be insulted if he found out a place like this named theirselves after him. This is my first time trying this place with my husband. I got the orange chicken with wonton soup and he got chicken curry. The flavor was not there for almost anything. Sadly, the rice was the best part of the whole meal. We decided to order Thai tea boba since we love boba and we love Thai tea. The boba itself was made well however the Thai tea part was very watery. Yuck. To top it off we spent about $20 and asked to use a coupon for 3 free rangoons with purchase of over $16 and were told no that it's for take out only. Sad. We may come back one day but for now it's not looking likely. I would probably give a solid 2 stars but will give 3 for price and the fact that the food was okay, not good but could do better.",4YEGTdvHShVvzv1GFrrI0w,0,0,3,xEMDrmSllh9HKTC6Wfg5dg

the prices are decent, and they literally make your carry out order in 5 minutes!

some dishes i recommend:
-mongolian beef
-won ton soup
-salt and pepper pork
-fried rice (any kind!)

beware of the chow mein if your looking for the pan fried noodle type.  its pretty much lo mein and i was disappointed when i ordered it last time we went.

don't forget the carry out order coupons.  i think they have free egg rolls with purchases over 20 and free fried rice with purchases over 30. :)",JHFuMHQBLuQ3TtkWwx1bmQ,6,1,3,bqESBiZ2cCeXWccBH9CZDQ

But I was hungry as hell today and just finished attending Church and didn't want to go anywhere far from where I live.  So today I gave it a try.

Wow, I'm glad I tried it.  Not the best Chinese food you can have but for what it is, I like it.  Fast , small but clean, and friendly servers....unlike other asian restaurants where they are always yellin' wondering if they are in a bad mood or thats just the way their culture are.  Very affordable prices also, especially their lunch $5.75 special which comes with fried rice, sweet and sour chicken, sour soup, crispy noodles, and another meat of your choice given on the menu.  I got  the general chicken combo which was my first time trying and tasted pretty good.

Maybe at its early days when it barely opened, the food was bad from what I can see from the early reviews, but it seems ok to me now.  Thumbs up if you're hungry, craving chinese, and in a rush.

Jacky Chan definitely kicks ass, you get it? Jackie Chan and kicks ass because he's a martial artist....ahh nevermind.",6kvGowEk1AvUUwWHLkJyNg,5,2,3,-NjfbEYkeIqrD0X690IPyg

So what I got is plain noodles with no sauce. I called them and they stated I had to bring the food back otherwise they couldn't do anything. I told them I had driven all the way back to work and only had a 45 lunch. They didn't care. They said they couldn't do anything unless I brought the food back. The manager refused to talk to me. I took the food back and told them I wanted a refund and my correct food due to the hassle and inconvenience of having to drive back. The manager still refused to talk to me in person. They refused to give me another order. The worst customer service ever. Save yourself the trouble. Even if it's their mistake, they don't try to make to make it right.

Soup, five different boxes of rice/noodles, pan fried potstickers, pan fried veggies, papaya boba. I think nine items total. I barely got to taste my rice and veggies because I simply could not stop eating the soup! It was so delicious, best egg drop soup I've ever had. I ate the entire bowl. Not cup, BOWL.

5761235,2015-01-19,0,gdb4gmSI5eJcuXLZ3BfgtA,"I literally only get one thing here and it's the House Special/General Tsao's chicken. I hope a restaurant review based upon a sole item won't be frowned upon but in their defense, this dish is so so good!  It is much more different than other general tsao's I've tried. The crust or ""fry"" on the chicken has a lighter and airier crunch than most. I think it is attributed to the higher cornstarch vs. flour ratio in the batter. The pieces are also cut into larger chunks which makes me feel like I'm eating less processed, good quality white meat chicken.  I don't know what all they put in that general tsao's sauce but I could literally eat anything slathered in that sauce. It seems to have a lot of honey or brown sugar that makes it much more caramelly than other sauces I've tried. I've never attempted to make a homemade version of this sauce but I know it will never compare so why bother trying.  
The egg drop soup is on point and I especially like the fried noodles they serve with the soup. Eggroll is perfectly crisp and filling is good. For their lunch specials, I find it strange that there is always a portion of sweet and sour chicken included. Frankly I would like to have it all general tsao's style but hey I'm not complaining. Maybe it's their signature dish or something Idk.  I want to try the boba one day but it's most likely a powder mix and no fresh fruit.",Tw3_-eahwaTZJjEsos1gpg,0,0,4,otvCPYAUNn-LH5wt39Z2rQ
