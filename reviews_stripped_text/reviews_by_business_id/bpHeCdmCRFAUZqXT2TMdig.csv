572172,2010-12-11,0,bpHeCdmCRFAUZqXT2TMdig,"Located on Main Street just a couple of blocks north of Charleston Boulevard, in what I've heard a second-rate TV celebrity refer to as ""the sketchiest neigborhood,"" El Sombrero Cafe is a bonafide Las Vegas institution, with a provenance that goes back to 1950. Across the street is the always-interesting Gambler's General Store, and just down the block sits the Opportunity Village Thrift Store and The Attic.

El Sombrero Cafe is a little place, with only about a dozen tables & booths wedged into a single dining room accessed through a door that's actually smaller than the one on the front of my own home. On today's visit, the place was so busy that the Princess & I had to be seated at the staff table, the TV-tray-sized table at the back of the dining room near the kitchen door, where the waitresses usually keep the stacks of menus & pitchers of water & soft drinks. No one seemed to mind the handwritten sign on the door stating that their credit-card machine was down and they could only accept cash.

This is normal, as the El Sombrero Cafe does the majority of its business nowadays with the noontime lunch crowd from the downtown legal district. I would recommend coming here after 1 o'clock to avoid the rush. Full disclosure: I have never been here for dinner. The ""sketchy"" neighborhood encourages daylight visits. In fact, I don't think this place is open at night.

I have previously written about the merits of comfort food. And El Sombrero Cafe represents one of the best comfort food bargains in Las Vegas. The Princess has declared it her favorite place for feeding her craving for the simple burrito (i.e., meat, lettuce & cheese bundled in a tortilla). I prefer the combo plates that are available for about $10.

The food is here is uniformly delicious and shows what can be done when simple recipes are executed with real expertise and care. For example, my taco was generously filled with perfectly-cooked spicy ground beef (properly drained of fat so that the shell stays crunchy), the shredded lettuce was fresh and crisp, and the grated cheese was creamy and tasty -- not that processed crap I've been served at lesser eateries.

And the service at El Sombrero Cafe is also uniformly excellent. Two waitresses glide through crowded dining room, keeping drinks filled and refilling chip bowls so that everyone can keep gorging on their delicious salsas. Adding to the homey atmosphere is the fact that, every time I've been here, people are constantly waving & saying hello to each other from table to table. (Anecdote: at the table next to ours, a newly-paroled former local politician was sharing prison stories with some lawyer buddies, and I shamelessly eavesdropped all through my lunch.)

While the fixtures here are bareboned, the walls are festooned with celebrity pictures, and one can spend their waiting time checking out all the signed portraits. These are not mere decoration. Their sheer number bespeaks the landmark status of El Sombrero Cafe. Above our little table hung a photo of Kenny Rogers, standing in the kitchen with the chef and a busboy, with a scrawled inscription extolling his love of the place.

Our total bill for 2 lunch plates, soft-drinks, and an endless amount of chips & salsa: $26 plus tip. A bargain, considering the quality, the atmosphere, and the entertainment.

Lest you think that my opinion of this place is entirely idiosyncratic (and the evidence of the always-crowded lunch hour isn't enough), John Curtas's excellent review of El Sombrero Cafe can be found here.

To round out a perfect lunchtime visit to downtown, head over to Luv-it Custard for dessert -- unless, that is, you haven't already stuffed yourself with El Sombrero Cafe's excellent sopapillas.",waadolhBnW9k2YexoLruLg,4,1,4,p2wTaZgE5PMkIrgZwH2kSg

After 66 years, this longtime downtown eatery is closing its doors, so we decided to stop in for one final meal. We got there a little before 1 on Tuesday, and the waiter told us we would be the last customers of the day because they ran out of food! Good news for us, but bad news for the dozen or so customers who came in after us. One of those groups instead asked for a carry-out order of chips and salsa, and the waiter scrambled to comply; these were obviously longtime customers, and they said they'd be back later in the week for a complete meal.

Most times I've eaten here, I've had the taco and chile relleno combo plate, so I decided to stick with tradition. The relleno was as good as I remembered it, and the taco was even better. My husband had a beef taco and a chicken burrito; both were equally good.

Service was good with quick refills, which was appreciated because it would be easy to slack off when you have only days left on the job. It seemed like everyone in the restaurant was a longtime customer, and while there was an air of sadness due to the imminent closure, it was clear everyone was enjoying their ""last meal.""

2021146,2012-05-01,1,bpHeCdmCRFAUZqXT2TMdig,"You may have been told at one time or another by old time locals that El Sombrero is ""the"" best Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas. Myself as a Hispanic find this to be completely false, and I strongly disagree.

I'm not sure why so many people have told me that this place is the best. It is definitely old. The exterior has lost the paint and you may have driven by it on Main St. and not even see it. Inside it is quite cramped, but that is a plus. You can chat with other dinners. It gives off that hole in the wall feel. I like the character of this place.

The food, is far below fair. I always say that if a restaurant claims to serve a certain type of food then they should be able to make the simplest staple of that type of food perfectly. Example: an Italian restaurant should be able to make a great meatball and marinara sauce. Hence, a mexican restaurant should make a great taco. If they screw up a the simplest dish, how will the rest of the entrées turn out?

I love tacos, so I ordered their taco dish. I was highly surprise to receive a very generic, un-freshly made tacos. The shells were the packaged hard ones you can purchase at the grocery store. The meat was ground beef with a very noticeable taco mix seasoning. There was way too much lettuce. I was very displeased.

Not sure how this place has gotten such a notable reputation. My only conclusion is that these ""so called"" old time locals don't really know what is good Mexican food.",dC0x1wWD5mOvCyiKw8tSSw,1,1,1,_-a2T32fo47qBpIgBQOS9w

The ceilings are '70s-motel-lobby-low as well, with underhung rafters to boot. The rent cannot possibly be that much here, yet the food is not cheap, and at it's current, more-than-you-would-think pricepoint, it's not even close to a good value...

Every item of food on my plate (#11 Lunch Combo: One Tamale & One Burrito with Beans & Rice) had a funky aftertaste, which is unacceptable in this day and age of survival-of-the-tastiest-restaurants. Especially when a $5-looking plate of food costs $10. This place should be $$$, not $$, relative to all of the other Mexican options in town. So, these aftertastes made me think, is the water quality bad in this part of town? Has the grill been cleaned recently? Even both salsas (a Red and a Pico-looking one) were pretty terrible and both had weird aftertastes which made me think, how many days ago was this salsa made? Is there some kind of salsa 'filler' that I've never heard about that I'm tasting, like baby corn and water chestnuts at a crappy Chinese restaurant? It only took ONE chip full of each salsa for me to immediately give up on both. That says A LOT, because I am typically a chip monster and usually ruin my appetite on chips & salsa at Mexican restaurants. Both salsas actually had a *sour* aftertaste which last I checked was Szechwan, not Culiacán...

Not to mention the chips at our 1PM lunch were already stale, and I wish I hadn't peeked back at the servers' prep station where there sat a sad, gray bus-boy tub of stale chips sitting unappetizingly in the window. 

Impressed (and surprised) by the seemingly loyal customer following, the place was packed and the energy was good - people laughing and talking. Service was fine.

YES!

We had first tried El Sombrero when we first moved to Vegas from LA about 9 years ago.  At the time, although I LOVED the building and the history, I found the food didn't live up to my LA-grown Mexican food snobbery. Nine years later, I think I've changed my mind.  

As we poured over the menu, the waitress (pretty sure the owner) graciously said we could still order off of the lunch menu, even though we were late for it.  Nice.  She also suggested a whole bunch of combos when she found out that we don't eat pork or beef as a rule.  They don't have much (or any?) vegan dishes, so I broke my 7 month moratorium on meat and splurged on a chicken taco / cheese enchilada combination.  

The taco, although served in a hard shell, tasted great.  The beans were top notch too. The enchilada sauce had almost a cinnamon flavoring to it I couldn't quite place. Pretty different to any other enchilada sauce I have had - and after reading other Yelp reviews I think I know why.  My palate was an LA palate that hadn't been exposed to much New Mexico style food, so I initially judged it harshly due to my inexperience. (tsk, tsk)  Lesson learned.

I didnt have to wait very long and was asked if I wanted some chips & salsa to take with me and I initially declined but the nice waitress sold me saying ""Its all fresh & Homemade"" I ate the chips on the way home and they were as advertised = very lite with a little salt and the red ones were very good.

When I got home I was very disappointed in what I had got for my $8. The burrito was good enough but only a medium sized portion compared to Roberto's or the other Mexican place I have reviewed here which sell bigger & better for $5. In hindsight I should have had lunch there and ordered a special from the menu, which is what I will do next time I'm hungry & in the area.

The place was almost full so they must be doing something right.",pFnRSBFyU7IEF-9Z-UHP7A,0,0,2,3Igy8q2ZphpJXePon_YY6A

The quality of the food, the service, the value, and the ambiance is always consistently very good. What I like is the owner remembers me to boot, and she always speaks Spanish with me. 

THIS IS THAT LOCAL DIVE THAT YOU HAVE BEEN SEARCHING FOR ... Yep, that's in caps for a reason. It's been owned by a husband/cook and wife/waitress/cashier for years. Just check out their lovely photos on the wall as you enter/exit. In a city marked by transiency and inconsistency in so many facets, this is that reliable restaurant that is consistent. 

I ordered Chile Rellenos - should I be so excited that I every time I order it and chow down, it's great? It is. I am. But before then, the fresh chips just kept coming, the drink refills were there, and an appetizer with guacamole just added to our selection of dips already provided. 

My friend, another long time patron, loves it as well. Although I forget exactly what he ordered, two items, the main entree, the flour and corn tortillas, all very good. 

So, having dined here at a minimum two dozen times over the years, yeah, this is the place you should go.

If there is a downside, that area of downtown is sometimes sketchy, and parking is sometimes difficult - be careful about lunchtime, and once inside, it's a little like a German beer hall. Be prepared to practically sit in someone else's lap - it's that close. But these issues also lend themselves to the experience.",k_eKYlkhI11VGzb5RxHmOA,2,0,4,-uhfNQD315iwK0NvYsJuWw
3517008,2012-10-23,1,bpHeCdmCRFAUZqXT2TMdig,"Why has it taken me so long to eat at El Sombrero?!?!?! I told the owner while eating there that I can't believe I am from las Vegas (we wont get into how many decades tee hee) and have never eaten here! Well, I think I was more into the historic meaning and longest running Mexican restaurant. I set the bar too high. I did however give a try to this mom & pop establishment. The woman who said she was the owner (theresa) was actually rude. She made comments I couldn't believe. A little girl was calling her name to tell her good by and to thank her for the food and she ignored her only finally to tell her ""I'm busy not now"". I was heartbroken for the little girl. 

The place is very small inside. They have booths along the walls and tables in the middle. I would recommend calling before heading down because they aren't open every night. In fact, they are open nights on Friday and Saturday and it is just until 9 pm. 

We started with a ""Cheese Quesadilla"". So simple yet so overpriced.
She also brought us some chips and 2 kinds of salsas. I have to admit, the salsa wasn't the best. I ordered a combo platter that had a ""Cheese Enchilada with Onions"" and a ""Guacamole Tostada"" which also came with the normal beans and rice. These beans weren't normal though they are thick not runny and I would like that if they just had so,e flavor. I asked for my Enchilada to be made with a flour tortilla and it was big and very yummy. The guacamole was not fresh and frozen. I don't know if that is a regular thing or if she was out of avocados. Gross. The other 2 in my group enjoyed there meals too but, agreed the salsa and rice could use some help. The rice seemed like it was leftover and re-heated. Very dry.

We capped the night off with some ""Sopapillas and Honey"". This by far was the best part of the night. 

Meals range from $10 and up. They have a Beer and Wine liquor license so if you order a margarita it will be made with wine.

I don't plan on visiting here again anytime soon. This is noted as the oldest Mexican restaurant in Vegas. There are certain tables that have ""reserved"" on them for local lawyers such as Richard Harris and a few others who escape up to 3 times a week from their downtown office to have some lunch or even conduct a business meeting.",Fv0e9RIV9jw5TX3ctA1WbA,8,5,1,2NBsasvH-7Uzwm947DYRpQ
3544050,2013-04-09,3,bpHeCdmCRFAUZqXT2TMdig,"Let's see.....

Apparently, this place is a pretty big deal in the downtown area of Vegas. Mostly within the legal field due to its location by the court house and all the law offices. Was invited to El Sombrero for lunch with some coworkers and figured, well, why not. 

Pulling in, I thought maybe, just MAYBE we were cutting through  a parking lot as a shortcut to El Sombrero ......nope. Parking lot is tiny and creepy. This is a door ding, side swipe and car theft area of high risk! Luckily, i wasn't the one driving. 

Finally, we make it out of the car and into the restaurant....During lunch hour on a weekday and of course the place is super busy, however, we manage to get seated within minutes. The place was hot (as in humid and no air conditioner) and service was very slow. The server was friendly and helpful in answering our menu questions. The items are all simple mexican dishes but for some reason priced pretty high. I ordered tacos and exactly like some of the other Yelp reviews mentioned, I got hard shell tacos with ground beef?? Seriously?! Someone in my group ordered Enchiladas and they were super runny, almost as if they used pre-made canned sauce that you purchase at Food-4-Less....Was not impressed AT ALL.

I would say this place needs improvements on their menu items, and/or lower prices. The clientele is there, they need to make some changes before Dona  Maria's and Casa Don Juan takes over.",LZ6IVvfitr_eFGxaFmND-A,2,2,2,KrIxSBju7WdC7ame8KvgmA

I had the pork chili verde with beans and rice and corn tortillas.  Standard chips and salsa--the salsa having some great zing to it!  The chili verde was good.  I used a fair amount of Tapatio to give the cili verde some zest.

For dessert, I had some flan which was a great custard with caramel sauce that was quite tasty.

Polite Service

CONS:
PLACE looks like it's closed, dark, small (which is fine), and horrible lighting.
SUB PAR is a nice word to describe there food - My friend had the #3 and the burrito was bland; salty chicken wrapped in a wet tortilla.
TACOS-  a step up from taco bell. You're choice of meet is ground beef, shredded beef and chicken. What happened to Carne Asada and Al Pastor or the typical cilantro, onion & lime? You get copious amounts of lettuce, sprinkle of tomato and cheese, all Americanized.
RICE- are you kidding me?!! it's boxed rice...that is NOT actual rice, it's boxed and  every spoonful is a taste of the over seasoned, MSG, sodium laden, processed product.
BEANS- have some flavor but very dry, I've tasted better.
SALSA- we had two salsa's. The one that I am assuming is supposed to Pico de gallo looks discolored and old..the taste, like stewed tomatoes with cracked pepper. The second, assuming salsa roja, tasted like canned crushed tomatoes. There was no flavor and would be closely compared to a spicy marinara sauce.
CHILE VERDE- not sure where to start here. I am guessing people who ate this were hung over or haven't developed their palate yet. 

Everything is over priced for, I hate to write this, below mediocre food. C'mon, one serving of chips? I don't blame them, I wouldn't order a second. Only one refill on a flat cup of soda...no thanks. LOL, and MARKET PRICE for a LEMON? SERIOUSLY?! 

I see there are loyal followers but then again, if you haven't had anything else...you wouldn't know any better. I wouldn't suggest this to any one and the food isn't that great.
