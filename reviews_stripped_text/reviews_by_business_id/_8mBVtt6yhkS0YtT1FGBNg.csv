They are so knowledgeable about everything on their menu and VERY friendly. Every time you go in there, they always have smiles on their faces. I am so happy that I tried their toxin flush. It is AMAZING and it definitely makes a difference in my life. Needless to say, I made some new friends. They really do care about you and your health! Thank you Nikki and staff!! I am a regular customer now and it's great!! It's hard to get exceptional customer service these days for sure. You guys rock!!  Keep up the good work! Life is good with you in it!!

I got to Nékter at that time to pick it up, and the girl in there didn't even start my order yet. I had plans at 1, but instead I had to wait yet another 30 minutes for her to complete my order. Since when does it take an hour to make 2 bowls?? I have been to Nékter several times, and every time there is the same girl in there. Judging by other negative reviews of the service at this establishment, I assume quite a bit of people are referring to this same girl. She seems absolutely MISERABLE to be working there. I honestly wonder if the manager has ever seen her work before, because I sure as hell wouldn't have someone like that as an employee. She takes forever to acknowledge someone, let alone take their order, and she is rude about everything she does. It is sad because although I absolutely love the bowls, the customer service is just horrible. I've been very surprised that the same negative people work there, considering the store is losing lots of customers due to employee attitude.",w-YM7BItCVysSkrX58iizw,1,0,1,GcagamhwtT5ANcyKA-JXyQ

The smoothies im in love with the pink flamingo and if you like things a little more tart ask to subsititue the coconut water for orange juice. Ive had a acai bowl im not sure which one but i asked for no coconut flakes and the workers kindly asked me if i would like to sunstitute it for something else and they let me get strawberries instead. The acai bowl was great and had a lot of the granola banana strawberry and i think there was a honey drizzle topping. It was delicious and the smaller size was plentiful.

I have experienced an unfriendly vibe the other times I have come in, however the product was always great so I've looked past the negative energy. Today not only was there an especially bad vibe, but the $9 bowl that I made a special trip to get was pretty sad (see photo). I'm not sure what's going on here and why employees seem so unhappy to be working in what should be a really great business.

The previous time I went in, I had to order a different product than usual because they were out of açaí. On top of that I ended up having an allergic reaction to this other product...which is not their fault (never knew I was allergic to mango). I probably should have just stopped coming to this location then, but even still I gave it another chance.

I had the Greenie the other day and it was just blah. Like super blah. 

I don't think they are organic and it seemed like this green selection was filled with mostly celery, yea the cheap stuff, as filler. 

I came home and my sister who was visiting said ""dang! smells like celery juice!"". She knows her juice, she owns a $2K juicer, can't remember the brand name, beautiful like a car.
For $8-9 for a 24oz plus a dollar tip I threw away the last 1/3 of the juice.

I will stick with Whole Foods, they really get juices right. Or of course Pressed etc. 

The customer service was not really anything, just asked me what I wanted (I didn't know so I checked out the menu) and verified what I wanted. Called out my juice when it was done, that's it. Believe me I don't need a song and dance but the place was empty and super quiet. Like eerily quiet. It was about 3pm so that's not a high traffic time but at least turn up some music or something. 

Maybe I'll try them again if I'm in the area. Meh.",zgV0ZroIF956gw4cul8MHA,6,4,2,TFZYPzJlBmgxQh66qSbIIQ

Also I don't care about your personal problems in your life, when you greet customers you need to be happy and go on like everything is good.

There were two girls sitting in the back on their phones. The hadn't started my order yet so I waited. Then they informed me one of the shots they didn't have. I said OK I'll just take the ginger. She handed me a shot which was supposed to be ginger and it was pure apple juice. 
When I told her that she remade it. But still made it wrong. Rediculous. 
When I tried my smoothie I immediately had an allergic reaction. I am severely allergic to Nuts and my throat closes. I told the girls numerous times of my severe allergy and they truly didn't care. 
When I called to tell a manager no one was available so I called the other location (in downtown summerlin)  I spoke with a manager there and she said her GM would call me back that night. 
Fast forward 3 days later and no word. I called the shop and the head the GM call me back. He pretty much said they can't accommodate people with allergies and can't guarantee safety. I sure wish I would have been told this prior.

I'm surprised a healthy juice store hasn't updated in that way as agave is pretty widely accepted as being bad for you while honey is a great alternative and health boost especially if local. 

Onto the things I like. Their acai bowls are some of my favorite because the consistency and flavor is good and their granola is yummy! They are huge bowls and very filling. 

I really enjoy their fresh pressed juices but I do not recommend the bottled ones. They have too long of expiration dates and from what I've read, cold pressed juices lose a lot of value the longer they sit. They also start to taste weird the longer they sit.

 My favorite juices are the toxin flush and the sublime. I like blending the sublime with pineapple- delicious!! The Popeyes smoothie is really yummy as well and I personally like it with cinnamon.

Three weeks ago, my son and I stopped in hoping to get, well, juice. There were no grab and go options made and the girl working (who was super nice!) told us it would be a long wait because she was behind on orders. A week later we came back. Again, no grab and go. This time, they were only accepting cash orders. After we ran down to the ATM, my son ordered a health nut and it was just kind of....gross. I can't quite explain what was wrong with it, but he ended up throwing it away. Having learned nothing, I went back today to pick up a cleanse. The two kids working were, again, really nice.

Come here for juices, smoothies, and acai bowls.  Nekter also offers their Nekter Cleanse line, 6 cold-pressed juices daily to be taken from one to five days.  I don't juice, but I know it's a popular thing these days.
I'm a fan of the Acai Banana Berry bowl and the Popeye's Acai smoothie.  Their products have just the right amount of sweetness and I like that nutrition info is available for everything on their menu.
Grand opening is set for Saturday, September 12th, from 7:00am - 11:00am.  The first 50 customers get a $25 gift card.

HOURS:
Monday-Friday 6:00am-8:00pm

Tasty and if you use the app it's fast to walk in and out, however; the last 6 times I came in the online order machine is broken and I've been late to appointments for work because my order was not started until I arrived. If you own this business please fix the machines. I want to keep using your services.",F0CTDOFxdE1DrzB786ayQQ,0,0,3,ZuaJjV_FzY-nZSf05qCMVA

I'd visit more often if it wasn't for the service, sometimes you get a nice girl upfront or a total rude one. To say the least when I asked for a bag the girl behind the cashier grabbed it & just threw it on the counter. She was quick to realize that that wasn't the smartest thing to do and put my bowl in the bag. It's unfortunate to have to stop yourself from coming to this location due to bad service but maybe the drive to a different location isn't so bad to get treated better.",fesmBxZyYQSElqWD11F4bQ,2,0,2,EaHTnahxfYNWNO9SQNnIVQ

Clean and bright shop. Limited seating. 
Friendly service!
Long-ish wait times 
Juice is fresh, and tastes very healthy!

Came here for breakfast and had a blended juice (smoothie) - Supreme Green- and it was super fresh and tasty! They juice and blend all the fruit right when you order :)  Since there was only 1 guy working in the morning, I waited prob more than10 mins for my smoothie (due to mobile orders before mine), but he upgraded me from a medium to large drink. Great service!",cQU8IWVEJYcklBJbW9CzdQ,0,0,3,zdy7Ypmi4VGvmxkDfBHJ2A

I figured that going to Nekter would do the job and it did more than just that. The girl working was very knowledgeable and patient with what I wanted/needed. I ordered the green apple detox and she recommended to add oranges, so I agreed. The drink ended up being so refreshing, I wish I ordered a size up. Thanks Nekter!",0Md3sO3sRR3GE4eQLtqZbw,0,0,5,cYNHU46w9cZ1HAOENsXxKg
5979435,2018-05-15,0,_8mBVtt6yhkS0YtT1FGBNg,"When my friend and I arrived, there was only one other couple waiting already for their order. I ordered an açaí peanut butter bowl. The cashier (Miranda) misheard as a banana berry bowl. She didn't repeat the order back to me and I didn't look at my receipt so I didn't know this. The other woman (who was really nice!) asked what I had ordered after we had waited for ten minutes, and I said the peanut butter. I look at my receipt and it says banana berry, and asked if it was okay if they made the peanut butter (since I saw they were he same price anyways). Miranda made an honest mistake, and I was totally fine with it, however, Miranda is standing in the background, with a hands on hips/one eyebrow raised kind of attitude... and seems annoyed that she had to make another bowl because there was a miscommunication. Once she's done making it, she looks at me, abruptly places my bowl on the counter, and walks away. Where is the customer service? Non existent. At least with her anyways. 

The açaí bowl itself was pretty good! It was very creamy, and the peanut butter wasnt overpowering. The açaí wasnt tangy and acidic like many other places I've been to. However, my açaí was only filled less than halfway to the bowl, pretty much drowning it in granola. My friend got the banana berry and she had much more açaí with hers. 

Overall, it was okay. Will not be returning.",PZRTv_0b0XE_yfEJ0p8-Rw,0,0,3,gpcMBvv5vTknLoRi1aQzBw
