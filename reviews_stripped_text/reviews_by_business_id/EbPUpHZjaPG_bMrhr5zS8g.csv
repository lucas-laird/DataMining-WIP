2809029,2017-10-22,0,EbPUpHZjaPG_bMrhr5zS8g,Sorry but this address does not exist. 302 Rampart is not in the Tivoli center nor is it Angel Park Golf Course. Apple Maps says you arrive in the Tivoli parking lot. Total waste of time looking for your establishment.,8PA4SEwplKHl9mUyZO9zgA,0,0,1,Nm-ePlkOj1BEUmDnOYmitw

Super delicious. I tried the sweet potato zucchini bread...  Wow. It was soft, moist, and perfect out of the microwave. We shared a piece of the pecan brown sugar coffee cake:) I literally had a bite... Because my non vegan friend was so impressed... He basically scarfed it down. He told me they have cookies and brownies and some other breads and cakes. I am not sure if they do birthday cakes, but this is definitely somewhere I would consider ordering from If they do. He did say they were at the farmers market. I will definitely be checking in and seeing what other snacks they have to munch on when I'm craving something sweet!",p9942XebvxZ9ubHm4SXmMQ,7,6,5,Dq8RNVmLuMrDBFOpunNdvA
5096314,2016-11-08,1,EbPUpHZjaPG_bMrhr5zS8g,I've been coming here for over a year... Melissa's baked goods are amazing! She also does GF/Vegan baked goods which is often hard to find (since her items taste good). I am totally hooked on the sweet potato/zucchini bread... not to mention the cookies. My only downfall is that I can order TOO much :P,hXOHumtKuh0180dT6VV_oQ,2,0,5,7zrcI-1B-z8PkZhiKj4OOg
