As I pulled up I noticed a drive-thru (wooh too!).  I ordered a carne asada burrito with cheese and the cost was close to $9.  WHATTTT?! That's reckless.  A good burrito should never cost that much.  When I finally had the opportunity to taste the burrito, I wasn't impressed. It was stuffed with rice and the carne asada was bland. I had to soak the burrito in salsa in order to taste any flavor.  I couldn't even get through the burrito before throwing it away.  Sorry, but I can't say that I'll be coming here again.",-xVqWqhOMFN7X35ME-IA6w,1,1,1,MWnlMQRlE8N0gGWPw7o77w

Also, there are honest employees here. I once forgot my IPhone at the dining table and they saved it for me. Knowing that this place is in a shady part of town, I was truly thankful for their honestly. 

Tip! If you like really spicy salsa, try their VENENO AZTECA!

Inside was clean and the service was fast,  bit the food is mediocre at best.  I had the al pastor tacos and chips... both were extremely dry.  In my opinion,  pastor tacos should be moist and juicy.  The tortillas were nice,  but it could have used 2 because they fell apart on first grab.  The chips seemed home made,  but might have been baked? I can't put my finger on why they were so dry without being super crisp either...",qNeMBnzJc3Kwk8Z39TDZEg,1,2,3,3JCpavtGJUZqMvmOqS5Lkw

Had an asada taco, fish taco, chicken, pastor and lengua tacos.. all tasted great. Rice and beans were worthy side dishes, one might think how hard is it to make rice and beans...apparently you've might not have eaten in Utah where the local flavor is ""bland""

If you love Americanized Mexican food and never venture of the well beaten path then do not bother. This restaurant is definitely on the road less traveled and turned out to be a fantastic experience for me.

No way.

These things were huge and I could barely get the breakfast burrito finished.

If it wasn't for the deliciousness of it I may not have. The bean and cheese was amazing later on as well.

I give this place one star for a simple reason. My sopes came with guacamole. It wasn't until I got home and was getting ready to eat that I saw that the guacamole was almost black. I wouldn't even feed that to my dog. 

When I went back to the restaurant to have them change it they just looked at me like of there was something wrong with me. After explaining to them that I refuse to eat it because it was obviously very old, they made me fresh sopes WITHOUT guacamole. I expected the guacamole on them but apparently they didn't want to made fresh guacamole. 

I'm very disappointed with that simple fact. I refuse to ever go back or even recommend someone to this place. There are places with fresh food that is just as tasty.",k6XN1VBPmnqlw1DFPYnedQ,0,0,1,6G9CCiNmkNCtMzwRUYcxKw

I came across this place and looked at it and decided not to eat there.  It just looked gross and there were a few homeless people at the door.  I walked away and pulled up yelp and saw that it got good reviews....hmmmm.  I decided to give it a try.  I ordered the Carne Asada Combo.  It came with beans, rice and tortillas and it was damn good!  The portion was amazing and the guy that made it for me was very nice.

Like others have said it is in a bad area, I was ok with it, been in worse, but if you are the yuppie type or scared of these types of places, might be best to stay away.

Definitely a ghetto shopping plaza with some shady characters, but you could tell from the outside that this was authentic Mexican. Went inside and ordered two carnitas burritos and flautas with chicken.   The burritos are enormous!! Don't understand all these people who are complaining about the price. $6.45 for a loaded carnitas burrito that weighed around 3lbs. 

The one mistake we made was not getting the sauces.  You really need to add the sauces to you burrito or else it will be a bit dry as they don't add any to it.

4882455,2014-07-17,0,IHnh6sKnutS_7IRHguW0PA,"Another great find off the beaten path.  I ordered two cabeza, two carne asada, two al pastor and one fish taco.  Off all of them the al pastor were the best.  The cabeza was great and the carne asada, according to my dining partners was ""pretty good.""

The fish taco turn out to be grilled tilapia.  My partner was expecting the baja style deep fried.  I brought it back to the counter and asked if they indeed offered that variety of fish taco.  The owner/cook explained that they only have one deep fryer, primarily for french fries and that frying fish in it would taint the oil.  Perfectly understandable.

But here's where it gets good.  He offered to make another taco, any version I wanted and to go ahead and keep the fish offering.  He understood that my partner didn't like it but insisted that I enjoy it myself.  I have to admit, it wasn't my style either.

HA!  Minutes later not only did he bring back a replacement taco, but two of them!  Outstanding customer service.

They have a self serve salsa bar that has a better than average selection of salsas, a highlight being a very unusual white based sauce that was very spicy.  Cheers for offering a Oaxacan based, very very rare salsa.   Limes and carrots are also offered.

May be considered by many to be a Yelp 3 star, but the customer service absolutely bumps this place to a 4 star.  Buche, birria and other varieties of tacos are offered.

Location may seem somewhat undesirable, but it is what it is.  I will be back and would recommend the place to anyone jonesing for tj style tacos.  About 1.5 miles from the strip.",fF-jCF2VcKDD3RkDkXNzDA,0,0,4,G0_2A0QeYfTS-V1SKJzKWw

One evening, driving around running errands, just wanted a classic, divey, street taco. Haven't found a solid Mex place like that but Las Famosas looked like the perfect spot. At the tail end of an auto repair shop, it looked promising. 

Ordered two carnitas tacos with verde sauce. Over $6. A little pricey for two small tacos. Oh well, hoped they were amazing. 

They weren't. They just weren't. The lime, which came with the taco, literally had no juice when squeezed. Dry.

The carnitas meat was tough and obviously laying around for quite some time. Dog gone it! I threw it all in the trash at home after the first bite. Very frustrating when you're excited to try something new and it just turns out to be garbage. 

You should know better. You know full well when meat and lime for that matter, is fresh or if it should be tossed. Very disappointing.",MxFNcMUjU5FXG2uqFYiP_g,0,0,2,IFwKdURn7C9ETBEiFEGlqA
