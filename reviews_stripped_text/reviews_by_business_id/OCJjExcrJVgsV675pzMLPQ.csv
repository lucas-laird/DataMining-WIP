The gentleman that was taking our order was super rude. While taking our order it seemed like an inconvience, like we were interrupting his time! As far as us calling our name to pick up our hot sandwiches, they set it on the counter right where our stuff was so I took it while we were ringing up. So of course I picked it up thought it was ours when I realized it wasn't ours,  I took it back up to the counter he then told turned his back toward us said ""unbelievable"" ""are you kidding me?"" And continued to shake his head! It was an honest mistake. On top of the other rude comments he made when he turned his back. Really? I'm a customer paying for my sandwich on vacation! I shouldn't have to deal with the attitude and unprofessional manner! If you don't like your job, then simply don't work at Jersey Mikes! I'm really truly upset at his dimeanor! Usually if you want customers to tip you or to come back you would treat them with respect! If I would have known I was going to be treated this way then I would have gone to McDonalds and paid $10 less vs paying $27 for a terrible experience! This is the worst location!

When I walked in management team of about 7 was having a meeting so it seems they are genuinely interested in making their chain/store better.

I ordered the California Club Mikes Way with no tomato & it was very good. I can't believe other sandwich shops are in business with chains like these. Meat, cheese, lettuce, avacado, etc. all tasted very fresh. I also got a free cookie having it been my first time here :)

One minor complaint is the location of the store. The plaza looks a little run down & could detract from their business.

I would suggest it & would like to see one of these chains in the East Bay. They'd do good business.",XYkXzGqurWJ7DNWUU2UC2A,0,0,4,bp-9QhZpaBgk351OdnUxsg

The sandwich full to the brim with ingredients..steak..peppers and amazing tasting cheese and chipotle mayo...mmm..it was to die for.. I can still taste it.. Mmm.. so of course the following week I was treating a Co-worker to lunch and talked about this amazing sandwich I had ..how big and tasty it was.. so she's like great let's go... When she came back with the order I called in on.. Wednesday? (can't remember the day for sure) lets just say I was less then pleased... It looked like a subway sandwich with the amount of meat that was on it barely any cheese... filled to the brim with ingredients? I think not..I tasted one bite with chipotle mayo.. so first sandwich was perfection and the second was just pathetic.,bzyCDsmVa3Iq1Ev--heu5A,0,0,3,AyOKDrACKVdIekVmojcsYg

One of the guys behind the counter was cool and recommended the Big Kahuna Philly which was really good.  It comes with extra cheese but I had them keep it to the normal level of cheesiness.

Another thing is that you can get a punch card where you buy 12 full size subs (or, 24 halves) and get one full size free or buy 6 full size and get a half size free.  I definitely plan to bring that card back with me on my next trip to Vegas as I need 3 more full subs for a free half (shouldn't be a problem).

Most of the time, they screw it up, so I finally decided to write a review about.

Called yesterday (24 hours in advance) for one tray of subs.  I asked for the tray to have equal amounts of 3 different subs.  I also asked for it to be delivered at 11:30am.  When placing my order, I felt like I had to ""coach"" along the girl on the phone.  ""do you want my name?  do you want my phone number?  would you like my credit card?  what about expiration date?"" she didn't ask for ANY of these things!

At 11am, the sandwiches are at my office.  I guess I would rather have it there 30 minutes early than 30 minutes late?

The platter had mostly Turkey & Provolone, NO Club and just a FEW (like 3-4 pieces) of the italian.  I asked for the onions to be on the side- no onions at all.

Even when we order a normal one sandwich they seem to mess it up AND take over an hour for delivery.

I came in and ordered the Club supreme or whatever they call it... The sandwich was great, they sliced a ton of meat on to it, the toppings were perfect and the bacon was suuuuper crispy. On top of that, the service was great! People who work here were real nice. The friends I came with had a the Chicken Parm hot sandwich, though it sounded good, it came out to a hot mess literally.

This one is different because the meats and cheeses are from back east. The subs come on white or wheat rolls- crusty on the outside and soft on the inside (so it can get messy with crumbs). We had a BOGO coupon (from the weekly local circulars) so the pricing was not bad- $12- for two subs, two bags of chips and two drinks (free refills). We also have a stamp card, so we'll get a free sub soon. My husband got the italian- mikes way- lettuce, vinegar, oil, salt and pepper, minus the tomatoes and I got the heated/toasted big kahuna steak (jalapenos, onions, and extra cheese). My husband had a bite of mine and liked it (surprised because he usually avoids heat/spice, unlike me- I love it spicy!). 

We've come to this one several times; especially since the one on Trop/Eastern closed. The parking lot was crowded tonight so we had to park in the next lot across the way (still in the same center). There are a lot of ethnic restaurants in the general vicinity and a an office building in the back of all the restaurants.

We ordered a Club Supreme, Mike's way.  I understand when having these types of sandwiches, they tend to get a bit messy.  What it a huge pile of lettuce on there and all.  Our sandwich wasn't cut fully, so we had to tear our pieces off of the Giant which made it messier.

Another thing we noticed, was that there was no bacon in the sandwich.  We thought, not a big deal.

For the longest time I wouldn't go near another franchise (Subway, Quiznos, etc). Lately however, I find the prices at JM to be rediculous for some of their sandwiches. $10 for a giant?! Seriously? They used to be 8 bucks. For someone like me who gets their philly steak with just cheese and onions it makes for a pretty measly sandwich. We used to throw in a little extra meat if someone didn't want any other toppings otherwise the meat gets lost in the bread.

This location is by far the worst I have ever been to. The employees at McDonalds and Taco Bell have a higher IQ and a better attitude. Ordered a philly steak with just onions. How easy is that? Not easy enough I guess. Luckily I was watching and noticed her throw on peppers instead of onions. I would understand if it was a busy day and there was a line of people with lots of orders how it can get mixed up but the store was empty and I was the only person there. There were other employees hanging out on one side of the store talking loudly with either friends or co-workers cursing, making out, etc.

One of the girls even mentioned loudly how she had to go pick up her mom from prison bc she just got released. (lol)

I watched the attendant make 3 sandwiches before mine was made and on each of these sandwiches, there was one pass with cheese and two passes with the meat.  When I ordered my sandwich, I ordered it with double meat, which based upon the sandwich history should have been 4 passes down the sandwich with meat.  The attendant only provided 3 passes.  I challenged her about this and was told that she did 17 cuts,  Not sure how 17 would be double the original, since is it not evenly divisible by two.

When it came time to place the onions, tomatoes and lettuce on the sandwich, the female attendant told the male attendant that they needed more onions.  He agreed with her and told her to go get some and cut them up.  Neither of these employees seems to get along with each other. They are either married to each other or brother and sister, but there is a definite conflict with them.  Not a good face to be showing to the public.

The place was filthy and will be reported to the health district.  Trash can behind register, overflowing on to the flow and almost to the register itself. The floor where the employees walk had sandwich rolls laying on the floor and they were being walked over.

Now once my sandwich was made, I was charged for double meat 3 times instead of once.   IT was the females way of letting me know I shouldn't challenge her decisions on what I eat.  

When was the last time you or your store won and argument with a customer.  You can do much better than this when it comes to hiring quality employees.

But I'm from Jersey. And when I think of a submarine sandwich, I don't think of turkey and stuffing, or pastrami and cole slaw.

Ask me to imagine a sub and I'll close my eyes and picture a Jersey Mike's #13.

I've said it before and I'll say it again - a great sandwich starts with great bread, in this case a soft, crusty roll dusted with a ton of cornmeal.

Meats and cheeses are sliced to order, cut thin and piled high. In the case of the #13, we're talking about ham, prosciuttini, cappacuolo, salami, pepperoni and provolone.

There aren't a ton of veggie choices, ""Mike's Way"" is the traditional lettuce, tomato, onion, spices and oil and vinegar, aka ""the juice."" This is definitely a place where sticking to tradition pays off.

That's it - no gimmicky sauces, no toasters. Just a great, authentic Jersey Shore style sandwich.

Their cheesesteaks are also pretty fantastic, a much more moist and well-blended steak and cheese mix than Cap's steaks. It's not a POP'S whiz wit, but it doesn't claim to be.

The sandwiches are fairly expensive but so, so, so good - and I get coupons in my inbox and mailbox every month. And besides, for a taste of home like this? Well worth it.",n-U5fa4B0hKfmRSZ-M7BMg,1,0,5,Sku8GBI4zTe_kWCiYmX5Iw

I really wasn't that impressed when I stopped in for lunch this last time. The bread was really good, but the sub was kind of bland and not what i had remembered. Maybe I will have to go back again and see if my mind will change. It was simply ok, nothing exciting about the sub.",wmyoMUiW6YU9Audm0lACDg,6,5,4,0xIa1V6Gr1VAHS2sIQUG5A

I called in to have it ready when we picked up only to find that they never started it.  Apparently they guy took my order down wrong and the manager had to correct it.  Unfortunately she had to take care of another helpless staff member so my husband ended up with a completely different sub than he ordered.  The subs were fine but of the two times I have been to this location in the last week it's clear there is only one person who knows what to do!

I seriously hope they are paying the manager big bucks because she is running the shop and having to do everyone's job for them!",GuIzALLrXveJSnjFusc6DQ,0,0,2,eTlR5BZvKoz17Rgp3ls3PQ

Service was great, not ""Jimmy John's"" fast, but not ""restaurant slow. About $7-$8 for a regular sub. Filled me up, that says a lot considering in an eat a big portion. Good amount of meat, not that super thick bread like other places. 

I ordered the Big Kahuna, Philly cheesesteak style hot sub. Pretty good, never been to Philly to know what a ""real"" Philly cheesesteak taste like, but for a franchise sandwich shop, pretty good. 

I would recommend this to ppl, something different than the norm. Average price, and fills you up.",GilRfh0shxVu0qX4chj_VA,0,0,3,XgE7cwp0RFNFb-GqAmNKew
