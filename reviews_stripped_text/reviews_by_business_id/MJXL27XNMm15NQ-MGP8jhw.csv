1025644,2016-06-01,0,MJXL27XNMm15NQ-MGP8jhw,Okay So I ate here this afternoon with my husband and first off he was really upset about how the deluxe burger he got had no lettuce or onion just an old patty and pickles! When we ordered our fries we asked for it to be well done and no sir it was still soggy when we got them!Then they told me there were no tortillas for the order I wanted and at first did not want to substitute anything on the menu for that! Then the bathroom there for women are out of order(they just opened up!) my man told me they did not even mop the floors with clean water and that they didn't even have fishnets or gloves on making the food.i wasn't sure if they washed their hands!ugh I noticed that too and that they don't give a fuck about customer service just want their weekly or biweekly check..will I come back and eat here or order here?.. Oh hell no..not after my experience today.,PSCqmrpLuFBF3xApmocAtg,1,0,2,CbjI5OWzMTNcD-2S_HMEzg

The service is nice and so is the people but I don't know how it is inside considering I use the drive through. I've been here multiple times and always get what I want.

1382233,2016-11-16,0,MJXL27XNMm15NQ-MGP8jhw,"WOW!!! What an attitude and what a DISAPPOINTMENT this place was tonight!  First off, I pulled into the drive thru with my son and right away someone tried to take my order.  I said ""one moment please"", no response.  Next the Drive thru operator (female) says - ""well tell me when you're ready"" very rude.  I then said ""I'm sorry"" and gave my order.  When I pulled up to the window I noticed an attitude right away.  No smile, no thank you.  Then I asked for a lid to my blizzard and was given a lid for a soft drink!  I also asked for napkins and she shoved three out the window at me.  What's the problem here??",CXTEm80fN8V2k4FuD5ub1g,2,0,2,JXgU6I9lGYK9Ygikgyab3w

I asked for a water cup and was given a bathroom disposable cup. I am handicap and had to make several trips to get water to get through my meal. I asked to speak to manager and got the owner who raised his voice at me he was rude. I ordered chicken strips and only had half a container of gravy.

some good chunks of dough. not skimpy at all. 

**triggered my desire for another.**

unfortunately my second visit wasn't as great, which just took place earlier this evening. 
the gentleman who took my order was pleasant also. i was super excited...til i wasn't  
the quality of my cookie dough blizzard (ordered with extra dough this time) was lacking...extremely...i was so dissatisfied and disappointed after only getting 5 (at best) very small little bits of cookie dough out of a whole MEDIUM cup of ice cream. melty ice cream at that. 
**coaching moment for employees**
just take the time to read the order. 
the whole order. not just the first part. 
i order extra for a reason. k thanks! 
might try again in a couple months.",FQCtbINL2lYlUBp0mm_o9g,0,0,2,nvGhmU1QZ8vu0-wWsP3Muw

Being brand new, it seems like they are still working out some kinks. We ordered in a group, so we noticed a few things were inconsistent, such as the volume of ice cream among identical orders, a few communication issues, all very minor things.
The staff however was very friendly and good senses of humor about everything, so it was very easy to forgive. 
I'm not sure how often I would be coming here other than to deal with an occasional insatiable desire for a Blizzard, but it's nice to know there is one close by.",mmUsLiQDb--7BBAxA6wKrA,9,6,3,SNOhUA3jntZldMYAqI6pdg

The burger was a little small. But it was really good and the blizzard was delicious. I rarely go to Dairy Queen but I was feeling nostalgic so we decided to have lunch there and I'm glad we did.

3813571,2017-01-31,5,MJXL27XNMm15NQ-MGP8jhw,"Where do I start? Let's start with the owner.  I was prepared to YELP this DQ based on the service I got.  I went to the Spring Mountain DQ in Chinatown. That one was out of everything and really just poorly maintained tonight was my first and last time in there. I asked for a PLAIN cheeseburger and said PLAIN several times. It wasn't plain which I found out on my way home.  

I decided to stop at this one on Rainbow because it looks nicer. I figured I could get what the Spring Mountain one was out of and get my burger done right.  I had my receipt which clearly shows my burger is seven whole minutes old. I explained to the counter girl who was very nice that my burger from the other place was wrong and they were out of things can they help me? 

The owner REFUSED to replace my $2.85 cheeseburger.  Because it's different owners. WHAT?? It's the same company. It's DQ right? It's not a steak and lobster dinner that we are talking about.  IT IS A CHEESEBURGER!!!! No, I don't have anything else better to do tonight as a fat, white, single woman than complain about a stupid cheeseburger. He can't file some sort of thing with the company that he needs to be reimbursed for almost $3.00? I bet competitors like MCD's would NEVER say oh we can't get you a new burger because it's a different owner.  I said I was never going back to the other location.  Wouldn't you want to be a hero and ensure I put my money in your pocket instead? So you got my money ONCE. And that is the LAST time you'll get money from me. Don't spend it all in one place. 

I'll also be contacting headquarters because I spent $2.85 on one cheeseburger that was wrong and a second $2.85 on one an owner representing a brand name chose to charge me for a second time rather than ensure brand quality and BRAND LOYALTY. From the looks of the empty parking lot they can use all the customers they can get. And while my second burger that I paid for from Rainbow was correct it tasted so vile I tossed it out the window.  If I'd gotten the customer service from the OWNER I expected my review would have been more favorable and I would have left out the gross food. No, I don't want gift cards I never plan on going back to ANY DQ ever. My first time to DQ was Spring Mountain.  I gave DQ a second chance and RAINBOW blew that one as well.

They have a variety of food and desserts from DQ and Grill & Chill. 

DQ: Classic treats like sundaes, banana splits, and cones. Blizzards, desserts a la mode, frappes, shakes, and malts. They also have Orange Julius smoothies.

Grill & Chill: hot sandwiches, chicken strips, salads, $5 lunch specials (11 am to 4 pm), hot dogs, burgers, and a kids meal. 

I only got the desserts and they tasted fine. I came in during a slow day so they were really quick with my order. Nothing to complain. I'll definitely be back to try the burger & fries menu.",TJZ773c6IobB29sEwkBAyg,3,2,4,tw-gCaF1pu2ex9FbgOEvzg
3972960,2017-11-08,5,MJXL27XNMm15NQ-MGP8jhw,"I stopped for a pumpkin pie blizzard on the way home as I had a need for some dessert.  It was 45 minutes from closing and the store was empty.  A pleasant woman took my order and said it would be ready in a short time.

She went behind the counter to the cooking area and I had a seat while she was making the blizzard.  Before she was done, I got up and walked to the counter and she came around and held the blizzard upside down to show the thickness of the mix.

The pumpkin pie blizzard is a mixture of pumpkin pie pieces and vanilla soft serve and topped with whipped cream and some nutmeg.  The concoction is quite good.  The pieces of pumpkin pie give the blizzard a nice texture.  

This was a good stop for a treat but it's not something to do often.  I can just imagine the carbohydrate and calorie count but it was good.  Maybe one more time before the pumpkin flavor departs for another year.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,8,8,3,Y9T_7d9UjyDBTEymNT8Wfg

On Sundays when I go wash clothes at the laundromat on rainbow I stop in to this DQ and grab ice cream or order One of the combos. I've never had any issues in this place, and I've always had good service.

This place is really clean I have never seen it unorganized, and you get your food fairly quickly. 

Mainly what I like to buy is the Oreo cookie blizzard, it's so good especially on a hot day. I would give this place a 3.5 stars rating.",cRDQuBEgxaYQoSPHAiEgHQ,1,1,3,yDBz0YpoFUXz6HTu9p4nWw
