The plate of Pad See Ew was really big, high, and popping with thousands of crispy cubes of tofu.  As an interesting option they had a big mound of fresh ground pepper on top which I was not sure I was going to like, but I ended up really liking.  It was $9.98 with tax, which is not cheap, but not expensive either....so you might say, it's somewhere between cheap and expensive.

When we were looking for a parking, my first impression was really bad. The surroundings was really ghetto, i must say.

I got scared for a moment...i went there around 10pm (they close 11pm) there were bums everywhere and the garage looked so haunted.
When i got in, the restaurant was okay, not so fancy. I didn't really care. We were greeted by a very nice guy, whom i think was the supervisor or something like that. He chatted with us for a bit telling us how this restaurant has been established for over 20 years now. He gave us really good customer service all in all. Right before we left the place, the crew sang him a happy birthday with a cake. It was really sweet. And whats even sweeter was, he gave us a slice of the cake he was given! Made my night!

It don't look like much, really, and unless you're looking for it you can drive by it for years and not see it.  It's odd to get to - coming off of LV Blvd. takes you on a crazy little loop to get to their tiny parking lot.  The dining room is tiny and sectioned due to the fact that it's actually been expanded.  (The first time I went here, in the mid 90s, the dining area had enough room for 4, four-person tables.)  Despite its outward appearance, the BBQ is an absolute delight.

My preferences don't tend toward the spicier side, but there are plenty of non-spicy choices on the menu.  My favorite is the sweet and sour chicken.  Unlike it's 'Chinese' counterpart, the meat in this one is sauteed, not battered and deep fried.  It's cooked with big, fresh chunks of red and green peppers, onions, cucumbers, and pineapples, and tossed with a sauce that has a sweetness and a tang and is completely different than your usual 'sweet and sour sauce.'  Other excellent choices are their BBQ chicken (I mean, it's what they're famous for), their satay, and the chicken with baby corn.  (And who doesn't love baby corn?  Don'tcha feel like a giant eating it?  It's fun!)

Don't miss their Thai iced tea.  Yep, it'll putcha into a diabetic coma, but they make it right.

2621882,2010-08-22,0,AxeQEz3-s9_1TyIo-G7UQw,"After reading the mixed reviews on this little hole in the wall Thai restaurant, I decided to try it myself.  And after experiencing this place for myself, I must say that I have mixed feelings!  

I ordered the Thai Iced Tea, Drunken Rice, and Rad Na (spelled differently on the menu).  I'll give my impressions starting from the bad to the good.  

The Thai Iced Tea was a bit bland, but it is just Thai Iced Tea.  That's no biggie.  I suggest sticking with a coke, or better yet save your $2 and just get water.  Moving on...

Next up was the Drunken Rice, which I have to admit is a dish that I have not had before.  The Drunken Rice wasn't bad.  It had a decent spicy taste, with various peppers and tomatoes.  I felt like the rice was bit greasy, but maybe this is just the way this dish is prepared.  I didn't taste any superb flavors that made me go ""Wow!"", but this was a nice way to start the meal.

Finally the Rad Na.  I consider Rad Na to be the best dish to try for a first impression of a Thai restaurant.  If a place can make good Rad Na, then to me that means that they take their food seriously.   At Thai BBQ, this is the dish that really gave me mixed feelings about the place.  The gravy sauce was probably the third or fourth best gravy I've had, on par with other above average Thai restaurants in Vegas.  It is hard to find good gravy in Rad Na, and Thai BBQ does a good job of it.  It was flavorful, with a very slight hint of sweetness that I actually really enjoyed.  The pork was nicely prepared, as were the fat noodles.  However, the dish came with American broccoli.  I asked the waitress if they could make it with Chinese broccoli, and she informed me that they don't have Chinese broccoli at Thai BBQ.  In my opinion, this really docked their score.  This dish was really good, but it would have been even better with some fresh Chinese broccoli.  I even told the waitress so, and she smiled and said, ""I know.""  

Unlike some of the other reviews here, I had no issues with the service.  The waitress offered to box my left overs for me, which was very nice of her.  My glass of water was never empty.  

With the disappointing lack of Chinese broccoli, I'll be giving this place 3 stars, but I think that if the owner wanted to, they could really step this place up with just a little extra effort.

Anyway, the place has character!  It's in a tough area but once you get inside it is very comfortable and quaint.  The server and manager were both so nice and friendly.  

Went for an early dinner around 6:00pm and was surprised we were NOT the only people there considering the location (also BTW you can't turn south onto 3rd from Charleston because of some road repairs).  In fact, by the time we left more than half the tables were occupied (on a Tuesday, no conventions in town).  Also saw multiple customers come in for takeout.  

BBQ Chicken - this is the house specialty and it was solid, although the only thing that really made it Thai was the sweet-tangy sauce they served it with.  Be sure to eat it all while it's hot - there was a piece of chicken left at the end of the meal which had gotten cold and I ate - defintely better hot!

BBQ Pork -  Also solid and also couldn't tell they were ""Thai"" except for the sauce.

Pineapple fried rice - This was very well executed.  Some places add too much curry spice but this was not the case here.

Drunken Noodle with Shrimp - Extra spicy, ""9/10 Thai Spicy not American Spicy please"" - Even with all that request it was still not superhot.  However, it had a decent amount of heat and the dish was phenomenal.  I enjoyed this dish so much that I placed an extra order to-go for lunch next day ""just a leeeeetle bit more spicy please!""

I wouldn't make the trip to downtown just to dine here but if in the area I would go back, especially if I was in the mood for BBQ.  Apparently there are two other locations, but a friend told me that this is the best location of the three.

anyways, this restaurant was referred by our beloved friend Bone who said this place has really good BBQ, of course we took his advice and I took the courage to make our second attempt... 

This restaurant is located at the end of the vegas strip and the beginning of the downtown vegas strip.  It's very hidden so becareful and don't run any red lights looking for it.  In an abundance of caution, it's on the left hand side.  This restaurant is very small, the outside looks like a restaurant that doesnt even open anymore...but it does.  The parking lot looked like someone is going to jump out and rob you so becareful.  

Once you open the door to the restaurant, it instantly makes you forget how the outside looks and reminds you that you are at a thai restaurant.   The first and last time i was there there were a couple tables with thai family - good sign.  Thai people eating at a thai restaurant cannot be bad.

The low point of this terrifying journey occurred when we saw Thai BBQ from the outside.

Fortunately, the inside looked much nicer and, most importantly, the food was great. We were starving, thanks to a complex disruption to our daily eating cycle caused by gorging at the buffet in the Paris casino the day before, and so we over-ordered. 

We weren't particularly adventurous in our ordering because pretty everything looked great to our empty stomachs. For starters, we ordered chicken sate with peanut sauce, which was great (and not really a starter), though to me it's hard to go wrong with chicken on a stick with a spicy peanut sauce. For entrees, we ordered pad thai with shrimp (yeah, I know) and the Hawaiian curry with chicken. What made it ""Hawaiian"" was the small pieces of pineapple sprinkled about the dish. Both were great if not inspired.

I can kind of see why this Thai Original BBQ closed down though, it was really in a 'questionable' part of town right in between The Strip and Downtown Las Vegas, and right next to a shady (and I mean Eminem Slim Shady) motel/apartment complex.  Although if I remember correctly this was the first location for this restaurant.  So original, yes.

But the surroundings do not atone for the food at Thai Original BBQ.  It truly was near authentic, tastefully done.  Once you got past the funky parking lot (potholes included), and the quirky little restaurant building, your taste buds were in for a treat.  

Many traditional Thai dishes can be found at Thai Original BBQ, and the menu is vast but not overwhelming.  Newbies to Thai food will find something familiar to eat, and more experienced diners will find some hidden, lesser known gems.  For our meal we stuck with the more familiar fare this time around.

*Spicy Beef Salad - Slices of marinated beef, cucumbers, carrots, red onions, cilantro, fresh green chilies, and lime juice

*Chicken Pad Thai - Noodles stir-fried with bean sprouts, and scrambled egg in a mild-spicy sauce topped with green onions, and ground peanuts

The Spicy Beef Salad was excellent, cold, crisp veggies, hot, juicy beef, and the sensory taste explosion of sweet, tart, and salty from the dressing.  Umami bomb!  I practically ate the entire thing by myself and almost didn't get around to sharing.  The Chicken Pad Thai was great as well, noodles were cooked just right, chicken was sliced thinly and moist, the sauce overall complemented the dish perfectly.  I don't like Pad Thai that is too sweet, and this one from Thai Original BBQ was very spot on for me.  With a squeeze of lime, I was consumed by eating.  Carbs?  What carbs?

Servings were pretty generous.  But watch your heat level!  We stuck on the low end of the spectrum, a 2 or 3, but were still hit with a nice punch of chili.  Nothing my gut can't handle though.  

Since the restaurant was a bit out of the way for us (and we didn't like wandering there after the sun went down) we hardly got to visit.  Unfortunate for us because the food at this That Original BBQ was exceptional.  I guess if anything, we can go to their other location on W. Flamingo Rd., which funny enough is closer to our neck of the woods!

Ordered Pad See Ew with pork, Beef Jerky, and Rainbow Trout Dinner.  Pad See Ew was decent, but pork was extremely dry.

Go down the strip, pass Stratosphere, make a left and a couple rights somewhere and you're there! It's the smallest Thai restaurant I've been to right next to a very beat down motel. At least they have a big sign to make it an easy find.

Ambience
The surroundings may look beat down, but the inside isn't too bad. Looks newly painted (maybe I was just hungry and everything was a blur) with a lot of wood panels and bamboo deco. Walkways are kinda small. Lighting is average, neither dim nor bright. When I went here with my two buddies at 8pm on a Friday, there were 10 people here so it was pretty quiet. Tables are small, but I'm pretty sure they'd allow groups to link tables.

Service
Decent. They do their job.

Price
The most expensive item here that I remember is $15.

Food
The three of us shared a pad thai, bbq chicken with white rice, and thai tea coffee. It was the most flavorful pad thai I've ever had. Just the right amount of seasoning. Their bbq chicken was good for what it was. I'm biased against ordering this dish at restaurants cuz I can make it myself at home so I didn't enjoy it as much as my friends did. Thai tea coffee was definitely tastea. Too bad the caffeine content was not strong enough for the events that followed that night!

You have your typical Thai dishes here. MeeKrob, pad thai, currys. I usually order a bbq chicken which comes with this great sauce, chicken satay, pineapple fried rice, mint and beef, steamed ric, and definitely Thai Iced tea.

Im sure that, if they do, they will go down in sincity history.  Before all the other newcomers like Le Thai and Pin Kaow, there was that ol' dinky lil' shacky restaurant with that mysterious Thai gift shop that I've never seen open, along with the freaky boarded up Motel on the same property which introduced Vegas and Non-Thai folk alike to dishes like Pad-Thai and the well known S-1.  I don't have to go on giving my review on any particular dish simply because of the fact that every thing on the menu is incomparable.

It took almost 10 minutes after we were seated before someone came to help or acknowledge us..and from there the waiting just grew.. our first dish, pad thai- came out 10 minutes before the rest of the meal, and the dish was bad..the noodles were broken and the flavor was bland and dry...10 minutes later, came out our garlic ribs w fried rice and our papaya salad.. The papaya salad and the garlic ribs were just okay... then another 5 minutes later came out our pad see eww with beef and that was a big disappointment.. it was way too sweet for me, it tasted like I was eating a sugar glazed dessert.. after our meal came, we requested boxes and our check..another 10 minutes flew  by again and we had to flag them down for service... what a big disappointment..",FCGCxiXBrj1p_8cscTeQXg,0,0,2,cLwiM9cdu50g-AACgKXKOg

There are better Thai restaurants for a sit-down meal, but for delivery or quick takeout, this is the best in the area.

I've never tried their Pad Thai, so I can't comment (weird, because that's usually my go-to dish). The Drunken Noodles are very good; this is what I normally order. I really like their spring rolls, both the meat and veggie versions. The chicken Satay was excellent too, the one time I ordered it.

I haven't ever had a bad meal from this restaurant. The quality is consistent. I haven't sampled very much of their menu, but everything I have tried has been spot on. I wouldn't recommend Thai BBQ to the Thai food elitist types out there, but it's a great little place to pick up some dinner on your way out of the ghetto.",Uz_0Tcvq5KcF4XQltYKjnw,1,1,4,nIAh7VhotvYO0oZEo0RLIg

It is soooooo yummy!!! The location isn't the most fancy and neither is the restaurant but that doesn't bother me. I prefer good tasting quality food over a fancy atmosphere. I don't understand the negative ratings on here unless it is because they were expecting a fancy place or a better part of town. I will continue to come here in spite of the neighborhood because the food is just out of this world. I have been here at lunch time which seems to be their busiest time and I have been here late at night which is when it is very slow and we will normally have the place all to ourselves. At all times I have noticed police officers frequent this eatery....as well as some local TV news anchors and prominent attorneys. 
   Some of our favorites dishes that are AMAZING are the Spicy Beef Salad, Drunken Noodles, their famous Thai BBQ chicken, mint chicken and my all time favorite: chicken curry! Just amazing!! I always try a new dish when we go in along with our favorites and I have never been disappointed! If you like Thai Tea that is awesome too. We can never figure out how such a small compact kitchen can crank out such amazing food in such a short amount of time. We have never had to wait for any long length of time for anything. I would suggest going here for lunch time. The busier they are the fresher and more delicious the food seems to be.

I am confident in my formula for a good thai place: a grungy, ghetto-fied exterior with a clean and tidy interior packed with actual thai folk.

Excited by the nasty, dirty exterior of the building and its sketchy location, I was disappointed to find the inside to be less than spotless.

I was quickly, if nonchalantly, greeted and seated with a menu, among about 2-3 other full tables.

After sitting over 10 minutes with nary a glass of water or a peep out of the staff, I had hope that the approaching server was on the way to take my order.

Alas, my hopes were dashed when the server went to the table that was already busy enjoying their meal and proceeded to take a To-Go order from them, so that it could be ready when they left.

Seeing that the other two tables hadn't received food yet, and had been there long enough to deplete their thai teas completely, I was very upset to know that I would be sitting starving, waiting for my food to be cooked AFTER these folks who were already eating their food had their To-Go order cooked.  

Uh uh.  I left the menu I'd nearly memorized by this point and my non-existent glass of water on the table and skeedaddled.",BxV2pTVmYCW15gSZAPMFKQ,10,7,1,mOacLhsCWuOnlMXf0AuYeQ
