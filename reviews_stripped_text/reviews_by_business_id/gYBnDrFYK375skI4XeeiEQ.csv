We would recommend the patatas bravas, the stuffed artichokes, the veggie empanada, and the house-made red sangria, all were just fantastic. The manager Ramon introduced himself and spoke to us several times.

Live music is available on Thursday and Friday evenings! Check this spot out! :)",uts3v9NkJ7VKLVihwl5pLA,0,0,5,wscMFmDn_y_kL8zk808McA

I wasn't sure what kind of food ""Latin"" would be but assumed tapas from the ""bites"". Cuba Cafe in the next parking lot promotes tapas as well but Casanova is the tapas everyone expects. 

The night we went in it was very empty (they haven't had a grand opening and haven't done much promotion yet). We sat at the bar with a few other patrons. The restaurant is huge, with plenty of dining seating and a banquet room in the back. The walls still have murals of Italy I assume and the ceiling is painted with clouds like the Venetian Grand Canal Shops. Regardless, I could easily see this place bustling and full. They plan to offer live music three days a week with Latin Nights every Saturday. 

The menu is very similar to Firefly or Barcelona in Southern Highlands. In fact the chef is the same chef from Barcelona. We ordered the fried goat cheese, bruschetta, beef empanada, dates, mac and cheese and sliders. The fried goat cheese was maybe just a tad over-fried but the combination of the sharp goat cheese and balsamic reduction was fantastic. The bruschetta was another favorite with the light and fresh tomatoes. The beef empanada was smoky with meat similar to stew meat. The dates and mac and cheese were standard but enjoyable. The sliders were also great, with sweet pickles that the chef makes himself. In fact he says everything is made in house. 

The food here is right on par with any of the best tapas in town. I think as long as they can get the word out about the restaurant it will do well. It's definitely nice to have some upscale late night food in the area. I'll have to go back for one of their live music nights soon.",rYPjqZO89ABei1fsZBSUbA,4,1,4,B_3620ldtXPT9_FRo69hqQ
