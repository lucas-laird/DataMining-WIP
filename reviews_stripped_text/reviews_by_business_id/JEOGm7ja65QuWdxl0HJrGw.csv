You never know what crawled in there literally  I posted the pictures on here as well so you guys can see what kind of fruit they are selling!,RP1MQaAoao1n3qjcDtv1gw,1,1,1,5jBQcqVkz94k-Ycc3dQ8MQ

2060641,2018-04-11,0,JEOGm7ja65QuWdxl0HJrGw,Love the prices but hate that management refuses to help the few cashiers they have stating they are busy. Lines were backed up to almost the back of the store and only 5 cashiers out 12 were open. Corporate needs to talk to his management here. It's not the first time I've seen this.,FUhmY8SAeZtboKGqI7igww,0,0,2,QgkLL3-5tD0B4bxtGIHFGQ
2208438,2013-06-25,1,JEOGm7ja65QuWdxl0HJrGw,"As I walked in to El Super, the appearance and store layout reminded me of Food 4 Less. As I bagged my own groceries, ready to leave El Super, I was again reminded of Food 4 Less. The main draw here is low prices, especially in the produce department. Also, the store was organized, and not too busy. The checkout lines are much shorter than Cardenas. However, they do not have the prepared foods selection of La Bonita or Mariana's. No aguas frescas, fresh fruit cocktails, burritos, or raspados. Come here if you're looking to cook dinner at home, not eat inside the market.

I was impressed by the bakery department, with a large selection of celebration cakes, tres leches, pan dulce, and other breads. This is the first bakery I've seen offering birotes, sandwich rolls typical of Guadalajara, in addition to white and wheat bolillos.

Just your typical neighborhood market, and I'm not likely to return unless I'm in the neighborhood.",PSI7wvuqEhhV9Jh_fP2eZQ,0,1,3,YRePVAZQXWRhtluxGCYG1A
2242275,2017-08-21,0,JEOGm7ja65QuWdxl0HJrGw,"Due to the low prices or slow cashiers at El Super, you can expect long lines. When I say long, I dont mean Wal-Mart long. This is like trying to get a ticket into a Swap meet kind of long. Try not to come here on the first of the month if possible. You will find everyone and their mama and her mama here.

The store is pretty messy, hence the rating I  gave. Everyone is just tearing apart Powerade packs stocked up in the middle of the aisle as if they were running out of Powerade on the shelves. 

Anyway, I'm still stuck in this ""Express Line"" at the moment and am getting a little frustrated of waiting because I have dinner to cook. Until the next Yelp.....",ARvvk5AcVtNREPiT1ZHNcw,0,0,3,Of_xyoqjRAHxIx5u3wjJbQ
2631885,2014-05-26,2,JEOGm7ja65QuWdxl0HJrGw,This store has good prices on produce and meat and the produce is always rotated fresh.  They don't have a food court which is a big miss with me.  I usually like to grab a bite while shopping at the mexican grocery store.,qbq4zC9SrZuaQ4-J-wtRuw,3,1,3,1IDni5seiIInrI14ZGKXXA

I can't compare to other ones I. the area, but I liked this place - very much like a Food 4 Less with more Spanish.",ak2s0KroDIf-F8nvFhFGuA,0,0,4,zBzb0arowiOTmw-A6tq0rA

No bad. Staff was nice but the meat section smelled funky. Meat didn't look very apatizing and looked like it had been setting there a minute. Great fruit and vegi prices",FyAhIB-IqIMV43lIpXVl8Q,2,0,3,V7s_KpX59lP4l0RZcJBegA

Walked up to the cashier to pay my items and I politely asked The cashier YOSELYN ""Hi do you guys take Apple Pay"" and she ignored me. So I stand in line and waited for my turn. She did not say hi did not make eye contact and just started scanning my items. I paid my stuff and she handed my receipt without saying a word. Very unprofessional will not be coming here again very bad experience",709LxrjYCUQKahjo0MtYHA,0,0,1,9aLEmVpKlQE3ehLxaGR3iw
