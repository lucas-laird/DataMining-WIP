My first time there today and I really enjoyed myself, my fianc√© told me about this place a couple days ago and decided to check it out.. And boy was I in for a treat this place was sooooooooo freaking good, the service was pretty amazing and the gentlemen who helped us was well spoken and knew everything and anything that we had questions about.. This place cured my sweet tooth big time, if your looking for something sweet try this place out..

Thank you for that amazing service and wonderful cinnamon roll..!!!",OIRsIoCptJANi2lakFOg2g,1,0,5,KmK6xzwcArnF_Pwlfizu-A

53039,2017-04-07,0,YVd2yYNjpiFg2s4ToMRmPA,"I really wanted to love this place but the rolls are way too sweet for me. I got a bun with cream cheese frosting, caramel sauce, pecans, and apples. The bun arrived warm and fresh. I saw them chop the apple in front of me, which was pretty cool. Anticipation turned to disappointment when I finally dug in. Not enough cinnamon, too much sugar. Like, I had to take two sips of water for every bite I took just to wash it down. 

The concept is great - it's like the Coldstone of cinnamon buns. I also love that everything is vegan and fresh. They provided phone chargers at every table, which is a nice touch. It's a cute little place with retro decor. 

It's worth checking out if you're a fan of super sweet things. Next time I would consider trying a bun without any frosting. I hope they add more cinnamon!",uQozn8McPuXwiWMrS7po6w,1,1,3,DmFJMYZ8PNFaXvw4Of4CCw
66944,2016-10-02,0,YVd2yYNjpiFg2s4ToMRmPA,Mmmmm. Cinnamon rolls + tons of icing flavors + lots off toppings = many options for yummy in the tummy. Decided to go with some of their daily specials and went with a pb&j crunch and coconut cream pie. Total came out to about $13 which is decent considering its gourmet and with all vegan ingredients. Cinnamon rolls where a good size with a generous amount of icing and toppings. Workers were nice and rolls were came out fairly quick.,w_B8hRcgXOzntK4MFNefXQ,0,0,5,mLZJs1Rw4S5iRQenpX2FwA

I went in and asked what was the most popular and the lady who ""helped"" us said, ""Whatever is in that case over there"", and walked to the back. Didn't say welcome, didn't say hi, she was rude. Someone else came in, I was ready to order, and then someone else walked in and she attended them first and had their cinnamon rolls ready within 3 minutes. My sister and I waited 18 minutes for a simple cinnamon roll with no toppings just the old school cinnamon roll. The cinnamon roll itself was good, but the frosting tasted artificial. I've had vegan cinnamon rolls before so the fact that they are vegan doesn't mean they should taste like that. But will not be going here again.",9v-WyhnOdFo_1PSaJEESXg,1,1,2,7GjynE8xht8bfAkHCXZoGg

I suffer with serious sweet tooth - I am a sugar fiend and being vegan there are limited options for convenient and amazing sweet treats in town. 

Cue Cinnaholic. I'm there 2-3 times a week and I've introduced every single friend to this place. Even my non vegan friends say it's the best cinnamon roll they have ever had. (DUh!!) 

My recommendation? Go for the regular cream cheese or the peanut butter frosting. If you're feeling really crazy, the pumpkin makes me want to die and float to heaven. 

You can't beat this place. Give it a go! You are gonna for sure love it!

Swung by today. Spent more time looking for the store in the giant shopping center than actually being in the store! Once I found it (hint - 3rd store to the left of Tropical Smoothie Cafe), I went in and ordered:
 -caramel frosting w/chocolate drizzle
 -butterscotch frosting w/apples.

Extremely nice young male counterperson started telling me all about the vegan-ness. I told him I was extremely familiar with the concept and didn't need to convince me to try it!

The frosting is more like a thin glaze, not a thick frosting for cakes. More gooeyness! I scarfed those puppies down like there's no tomorrow.

While I was there, several groups of people came in. He went thru his ""vegan spiel"" with each group. Only 2 of the 7 or 8 made a face and left. Several were incredulous that you can actually bake without eggs, milk or butter. One bite was all it took to convince them.",VrAo40MP-MaHzJb9aSypnA,2,1,5,0kYEEdTaLJ8VOWnPFHF3cw

I can normally handle very sweet stuff but this was so sweet that I didn't want to eat it. It was nice though how you can pick all of the different flavors. The mini buns weren't as sweet however they weren't as soft as the bigger ones.

I get the box & she did the same frosting & topping in sets of 4. I told her that wasn't what I asked for & how can we fix this & she said we can't fix it & I should have been more specific. I then explained that I thought by saying I want everyone one of them different that was specific enough. She then told me that I agreed to chef's choice & that's how she choose to do them because it is easier for her to make more of the same kind.

Cold and blank wall responses is what I got. Whatever, I decided to just order a regular cinnamon roll with cream cheese frosting, going with the classic to be safe.

Walk in, order straight in front of you, and move down the line to pick it up.
They have a flat screen on the back wall playing cute music videos that were upbeat. Loves. 

You pick your bun, like mini buns or original then pick your frosting (alllllll kinds of flavors) and then pick your toppings! Not sure on prices. (Two dressed huge buns and a huge brownie came to $16.)

My fav is the Smores and the homemade brownies. Or a flavor icing and brownies on top.
I was SUPER tempted to get the spiced icing with the fresh peach........but I'll have to try that next time.

When I want cheat time I want cookie dough, brownies, and allllllll the chocolate possible lol.

Anyway I suggest cake batter icing with cookie dough and my usual of chocolate icing with brownie pieces.

I was highly disappointed in our female cashier, tall brunette with her hair in a bun. She seemed very moody especially after my friend showed her the Groupon she bought the other day (one of the reasons we came here in the first place - she wanted a good deal and I'm vegan) She wasn't helpful at all she just recommended I add coconut after I decided on blueberry and was in such a hurry even though we were the only customers inside. She NEVER asked us if we were dining in or taking it to go she just marked it as to go.

The two gentlemen working were so nice especially the handsome guy with the glasses and Star Wars shirt  who might be the franchise owner because his customer service was on f'n point! The girl cashier walked away after my friend was done ordering and I actually wanted to buy one to go for my roommate but she wasn't texting me back but luckily the guy came over and I told him that she just said pumpkin spice and he then recommended 5 different toppings explaining why they balance well! I went with pie crumble and he even signed me up for the rewards program and explained how it worked!! 

The other gentleman accidentally put on pecans instead of pie crumble by mistake and instead of just giving it to me they both asked if it was ok (never know if someone as nut allergies!!) and I explained it wasn't for me, that's why I picked pie crumble and they made a fresh one all over again, which is better than picking them all off lol

My blueberry with coconut roll was delicious! The coconut didn't balance as well as I thought it would but it still worked. My friend ordered a maple with graham crackers. She wished it was less chunks of crackers and more of a crumble. And we both enjoyed the chocolate chip cookie! But it's super disappointing they didn't have any brownies ready for us to try! 

Overall I will totally be back! Would have gave them 5 stars had the female cashier been more friendly and outgoing. Especially over a Groupon...don't put out a Groupon if you don't want new customers, it's not just for cheap people it's to help people discover you!!!

I ordered the Old School, which is a classic cinnamon roll. It was my first time there, I had to to find out how the Classic stacked up. It was SOO good!! I inhaled it. I have to say...I really don't like the cardboard container they put it in...it's too hard to lick the frosting out of it. 

We also ordered a Carmel Apple, which tasted like those Carmel apple lollipops, yum! And we had the special of the day which was Sucker for Smuckers...I think, it was peanut butter with grape drizzle and gram crackers. I can't remember exactly what was in it, but it was really good!!

1518468,2017-03-22,2,YVd2yYNjpiFg2s4ToMRmPA,"Cinnamon is one of my favorite flavors. We were over on the west side on Monday and we noticed a business called Cinnaholic which made ""Gourmet Cinnamon Rolls"" so we just had to stop in and check it out. I got a basic cinnamon roll with vanilla frosting and my GF got one with cream cheese frosting and pecans. We paid about $11.00 for the two rolls.

When I began eating my cinnamon roll I noticed a few things: the frosting tasted off and weird, with a chemical flavor that reminded me of dish soap. The texture of the frosting was not smooth, it was grainy in a way I'd never seen before. The roll itself had virtually no cinnamon taste; it just tasted like a lump of baked dough even though I could see brown streaks in it.  Also, it was impossible for us to tell the difference between the vanilla and the cream cheese frosting; both appeared and tasted exactly the same. I didn't finish my roll because it just didn't taste like a cinnamon roll should, and I wondered how a business that did nothing but make cinnamon rolls could mess this up.

Curious, I went to the company's website and I found the answer: these were vegan cinnamon rolls. There was no notification about this anywhere on the outside or inside the store and the worker who sold us the rolls never mentioned it. It seems they don't want to let their customers know that they're not getting regular cinnamon rolls. This to me is deceptive, bordering on being fraudulent, much like a bar that will sell you a beer and then when you ask why the taste is different after you've paid for it they tell you their beer doesn't contain alcohol.

I have nothing against vegans or veganism. I'm sure people who practice veganism have good reasons for removing animal products from their diets and I respect that. But I am not a vegan, and if a business that sells me a food item that usually contains animal products has removed all animal products from that item I want to know about it before I make a purchase decision. To conceal this knowledge from me is in my view simply a flat-out bait-and-switch and an extremely bad business practice. 

In the company website's FAQ one of the questions is ""Why don't you advertise your products as vegan in your store?"" Their answer is ""...To us, living a vegan lifestyle and consuming vegan products is normal! Why treat it like it's not?""  

Well, let's put the shoe on the other foot: If I am a vegan I will want to know if animal products are used in the food I buy, right?  And if I am a vegan am I going to be satisfied with a food vendor telling me ""To us, living a non-vegan lifestyle and consuming animal products is normal! Why treat it like it's not?""  We all know the answer.",j_TSUybr0hoAu7r_wyehEg,5,1,1,Ctp0nbQIp2H_dGtUvF84tg

There are not that many tables so if you have a big party this place may not be ideal.

Service:
You order what you want and they make It in the back and bring It to you. 

Price:
It is about $6+ for a cinnamon roll. 

Food: 
There are so many options on the display and you can customize It however you would like

Notes:
There is no way that one person can finish a cinnamon roll, I would say 2-3 people are able to share one. It is very sweet so if you don't have a sweet tooth, you wouldn't like this plce",VZrzBM83OSOb01ZHq4_mGA,0,0,4,LxBRRw9ND_aHFKvsLMrLjw

We were in Las Vegas for 4 days and I had to return before we left for more cinnamon rolls goodness. I joined the loyalty club on my first visit even though there isn't a store in my State. I'm glad I did because I earned a free roll on my visit.

They have few different ones that can choose from all in a really awesome display all done up finish product. You also have the option that can make your own masterpiece. You just start the base with the cinnamon roll and the rest is whatever your heart desires. The smores really caught my eye. That the one I went with and my cousin went with made his own up. I forget what he came up with something with lemon flavor. Maybe. It was no way as artistic or had as much components then my smores. It was good. It had all the things associate with smores marshmallow, granola cracker, and chocolate. The only thing that was weird for me. The alcohol or if they do in the sauce on top was strong. I was thinking man getting drunk on cinnamon roll. The portion size is huge. Neither one of us were able to finish our cinnamon roll. I would almost say sharing is good idea if not super hungry. They also offer gluten free ones.

It small place not many seats. I am fan of the checkerboard old school dinner vibe get from the inside. You place order and then pick it up at the end of the counter.

The cashier was new and actually doing a great job, she just needed help. I kept it basic and got one roll with cookie dough and another with cream cheese so it was quicker than others. I took mine to go, but another customer who was dining in had to go to the back and stop the chef from working to ask for eating utensils... and napkins. 

I ate mine on the way. Very tasty and glad they're fresh baked. The combinations of tastes and flavors you can do are amazing, but I feel like the best part of any cinnamon roll is the middle. So save the best for last right? No. Double no. The middle has like 3 tablespoons of hard sugar and cinnamon. Seriously. I had to spit it out. I shoulda remembered to take a picture but I was on the road. And these aren't cheap! I expected more from them.

I tried a Captain America and a cookie flavored, and they were both great. Soft, gooey, delicious, and most of all photogenic! Next time I think I will just try their original though. It's like when I go to boba, if it is a new place I always judge them based on their plain milk tea with boba. Do the original justice and then I'll know you are legit!! Along this line, if I had one suggestion for them I wish they had more funky combo suggestions. Although a plain cinnamon bun is good enough for this classy lady, both members of my party griped about the lack of options. ""Make-Your-Own"" is fun but the business itself knows the best possible combos. Instead of only offering a few, have a menu of twenty combos and mark your best selling. This would be a huge help to first-timers!

Moving away from the food, I did not like the smell of this shop. It was like a mixture of soap and raw dough. I might have been hyper-aware of it because I was so looking forward to cinnamon and icing smell goodness. Who knows, maybe it was a bad day or they just completed a clean up, but it was actually bad enough to give me a slight headache. I couldn't eat there, so I took my gourmet bun home. The girls working the day I went did not want to be there. They seemed angry and distant. They struggled to put on a happy face but made an effort to be cordial which was appreciated. 

Will come back for the bun, hope for employees in a better mood, and cross my fingers for delicious fresh baking smells. Overall a good experience.",JB4_tH5U_oN7Xl3MA4aeHw,2,3,4,l9cQ4rSAD7Urk_ZhJuy6cA

I am not a vegan but a few of my friends are so I went with them but honestly, you could never taste the difference.  They don't advertise being vegan anywhere and nonvegans have no reason to feel threatened here like we sometimes are at other vegan restaurants and bakeries.  They certainly aren't shoving veganism down your throat.  They are also VERY reasonably priced which is not always the case with vegan restaurants or any bakeries.
We came late at night so it was pretty quiet and calm.  We were lucky enough to get fresh rolls which was great but did take a while (NO complaints here but the woman who had ordered just after us seemed to be getting a little impatient).  I got the seasonal apple cider frosting with apple slices, pecans, oats, and cinnamon/sugar on top.  It was amazing other than being a little sweet for my taste.  This is the only reason I gave four stars.  Next time, I think I will try one of their smaller rolls (Baby Buns) so it isn't so overwhelming.

I came in because I thought it was really cool that someone came up with the idea of customizable cinnamon buns so my friends and I decided to give it a try. Service is really nice and friendly and the place itself is very clean.

The only thing I didn't like were their frostings. And I honestly don't think I'd like any of their frostings besides vanilla, which is what originally comes on cinnamon buns. I got butterscotch but it was way too sweet. However, when I tried my friend's frostings, their's was also too sweet. They also drown your cinnamon bun in frosting like crazy. Make sure to sample before choosing your frosting!

There are so many combos of frostings and toppings that I was a little overwhelmed, but the employee was patient to answer my questions and give some suggestions. 
Expect to wait a while for your order, especially if there is a crowd. I took mine to go because I knew that I would need to share my rolls and I am glad I did. At 650 calories not including toppings, I can't imagine having these rolls more than a few times a year. I would equate them to Pink Box donuts. Your mouth loves the taste, but you heart can't handle the ingredients. I would suggest less frosting to better appreciate the flavor of the toppings and roll. It was very messy so use a fork. I cut my 4 rolls in fourths and family members were able to try a sample. The brownie was very gooey- too much for my liking. The cookie was perfect-like something from my childhood. The store was clean and the employees were friendly. Parking can get crowded with all the other stores nearby so careful. Thankfully for my waistline I am only in this area for yoga class so that should keep my visits to Cinnaholic to a minimum but I would definitely bring out of town people here for the treats.

We were finished with dinner at about 8:40pm and your store closed at 10:00pm, so before making the approximately 28 minute drive, one of my friends suggested we call to confirm you close at 10:00pm before we make the long drive, yelp is known to have incorrect store hours from time to time. I called and spoke with a female employee, I mentioned that we are driving from about 30 minutes out and wanted to confirm the store closed at 10:00pm and that it wouldn't be a problem that 5 of us would arrive by 9:15-9:20:pm, she replied "" Yes we close at 10:00pm and coming at that time would be fine as all our ingredients are made fresh so we have everything in stock, come on over we look forward to seeing you"", I replied Thank you and we were on our way. We arrived at the store at approximately 9:20pm, a car full of 5 of us, we walked into the store and the young man at the cashier said to us ""Just want to let you guys know we only have 1 roll left"", we were in complete shock and assumed he was joking with us but he went on to confirm that only one roll was left, I stated to him that we just called about 25 mins ago and your employee mentioned nothing about running out of rolls as even a possibility, he apologized and said there is nothing he can but offering for us to buy the single roll left. As you can expect after driving 30 minutes we were all pretty upset and disappointed especially after taking the initiative to call ahead of time to confirm, definitely affected the mood for the rest of the evening. The female employee who we spoke with on the phone, immediately went to the back room after she noticed we were complaining to the cashier and didn't even have the courtesy to come out and acknowledge her mistake and apologize to our group. I had to request the cashier to have her come out so I could question her why she would tell us one thing over the phone and then this happens, she apologized to me and then with an attitude stated ""Have a Goodnight"". This is by far one of the worst customer service experience I have dealt with, this is completely unacceptable, your management team needs to really do a better job of conveying to retail store location employees to alert customers who call in that due to a limited supply there is a possibility of rolls running out, I'm getting upset just having to take the time out of my busy day to write this letter to your company and live this disastrous night over again. I'm disappointed because was eager to try your Vegan Rolls but more disappointed for my 2 Vegan Friends who could not wait to try them as they were talking about visiting your location for the prior 2 days we in Las Vegas. I wrote a letter to the corporate office regarding our experience, the management team wrote back and stated they confirmed our story with the store location and employees, they stated they couldn't predict this would happen and only offered an apologize, an apology isn't sufficient here when your store dropped the ball BIG TIME. I gave them one more opportunity asking if they can make this situation right for me and my friends as an apology is just not acceptable in this case, the never responded again and here I am letting the yelp community know how this establishment treats and looks after its customer, don't waste your time driving here,  CAUTION STAY AWAY I would not recommend anyone come here and we definitely will NOT BE COMING BACK!",I863eSlvhyP6Zjl5fi3ikw,4,0,1,0niRFyaHnRZd2NLIBQ5BtA

The cinnamon rolls are huge and with the amount of frosting/toppings that they generously top it with, I can seriously share with another person. I can only eat half and save the rest for later. 
I'm a sucker for their cream cheese frosting so I pick that with cookie dough, brownie bites, or blueberries on top.

First off, this establishment is a great choice if you are craving for something REALLY SWEET. And I mean reeeaally sweet.

I would not recommend coming here if you're looking for a more light dessert, unless you'll be sharing with a group of people.

My fam and I ordered 3 different kinds. All with light frosting. They were made to order and all came out fresh, warm, and gooey. Reminds me of everyone's favorite mall eatery, Cinnabon. :] The interior space and seating is pretty limited, so coming here with a big group may not be accommodating.

So when we made our plans this year the wife and I decided to hit several more VEGAN hot spots here and first on that list would be Cinnaholic. I decided to start with something simple.....roll with Vegan Cream Cheese......and Vegan Caramel......the RESULT = DELICIOUS. The wife had a roll with Vegan Cream Cheese and Pecans.....and did I mention by the way.....EVERYTHING.....and I do mean EVERYTHING on the MENU is VEGAN.

Well I am pleased to say the customer service was excellent and while there was a wait because they make these rolls ""MADE TO ORDER"" style.....it was definitely worth it.

Two things to remember as I conclude this review.....they don't print paper receipts so remember to have them email it or text it to you. Secondly they have these awesome chargers for all different devices at each table so for those of you who just have to have your social media fix.....your covered. They have a great rewards program that I signed up for.....it took about 5 seconds. Why only 5 seconds you ask? Well you just put in your phone number and BOOM your in. You will receive a text message confirming your registration and your receive points on every transaction you make.....and all you have to do is enter your number every time you come in......no cards to carry or apps to download......AWESOME Right? 

One last thing.....I promise....LOL.....We also had an awesome COOKIE for 2 Bucks.....and they sell mini buns....cinnacakes.....and even cookie dough for your sweet tooth pleasure.

I am not Vegan. I will never be Vegan. I respect people who are Vegan and I am happy there is some more versatility out there for you. I do not understand why it needs to be punctuated that this place is Vegan. Personally, if there was a giant stamp on the door that stated ""Vegan"" I would likely be deterred. I think this is an awesome conversation starter and not a big deal. Try it!

As far as the cinnamon roll is concerned, frosting aside, absolutely perfect and 5 stars in my opinion. I am pretty boring and order the Old School Roll because I like it simple. But I've tried a few of the flavors and tried their cookie dough which is quite tasty. 

For the frosting though, I have to agree with a lot of other people on some of the issues. One is that it is very sweet. You can taste that the sugar isn't dissolved and it gives it a grainy texture. The second concern is their fruit frostings. I've personally tried the blueberry and I was very disappointed. I knew something was wrong because it wasn't blue. The frosting was still the same white color. This means they use a flavoring. Why not use real fruit? I don't understand that AT ALL and therefore will not order the fruit frostings. They taste like chemicals and fake flavoring and it ruins the entire experience. 

I think if they could create a way to make the frosting less sweet and make them more natural in flavoring, I would give this a five star review for sure. All that said, it is still a great place to try, Vegan or not.",kmXn7iEJWGDGbWUiEmZ_kA,0,0,4,hT7ycuqCdi8yqkZQCpjI2Q

No complains about service or friendliness, but at almost $6 a bun, it just wasn't really worth it for me. The cinnamon bun dough itself was not bad, but nothing to gush about, and the frosting was just way too sickly sweet for me. Maybe go easy on how sweet you make the icing? 

Another suggestion would be to get better coffee! Anything that's sitting in one of those coffee thermoses all day just cannot be good.",A2s1YH0eJZPdZi6c42rnGA,0,0,3,-sf8cahcDdJ9BhOaO5H9cQ

Completely amazing. 
The strawberries weren't old and gross, and the vanilla cream cheese that I chose was probably the best choice I made. I don't even like the cream cheese texture normally, but this was spectacular. I even scooped up the extra. 
Probably the only cinnamon roll worth taking a picture of comes from this place. I've eaten cinnamon rolls all over Vegas because they are my favorite breakfast, and this place has perfected it.

As a first timer, the menu can be overwhelming. There are just so many options. And while you can just go with a classic cinnamon roll, that seems to defeat the purpose. Regardless of what you order, though, it's going to be awesome.

These are absolutely decadent and delicious. I had the Twix cinnamon roll, and my husband ordered one with vanilla frosting, pecans, and caramel sauce. I'm glad it's a bit of a drive for me to get here, otherwise I would come a lot more. They are reasonably priced, so I wouldn't feel bad about it either! 

I thought it was interesting that they don't seem to advertise that these are vegan. You don't really see it anywhere on the menu. I wouldn't have known unless I had read the Yelp reviews. As a nonvegan, I appreciated that they weren't all in your face about it.

The space is very clean and service was extremely quick. We came around 3:30 pm on a Monday and it was pretty empty, so if you want to beat the crowds, I'd recommend coming around then.",37GTo06k6YUmjRgBqVaZBw,6,2,5,U5lY6ua-uU4_3iBB1e7rmg
3516976,2017-01-24,44,YVd2yYNjpiFg2s4ToMRmPA,"After seeing all of the great reviews on yelp for this place I was eager to give them a try. I noticed they had a Groupon, so I purchased one. The Groupon was good for 2 cinnamon rolls, 1 cookie and 1 brownie, which I liked because it meant I could get a taste of more than one item offered here at Cinnaholic. Employees were friendly and helpful with questions. 

There are a couple of things about Cinnaholic that I was not aware of until after visiting this location: 

The first... is that this place is 100% vegan. I don't have a whole lot of experience with eating vegan food, but if this is it when it comes to cinnamon rolls, just give me a damn Cinnabon from the mall instead. I understand some people eat vegan and I am glad there are options out there for all of our preferences. The baking sugars are derived from beets, their marshmallows are free of gelatin and other ingredients are all flavored with fruit, spices and plant derived oils according to Cinnaholic. 

The second... is that they were on ABC's Shark Tank. They accepted a deal to ship their rolls nationwide, but then decided to decline the deal and focus on opening more storefronts. 

So the cinnamon roll is $4.75 and if you add flavored frosting it's an additional $0.25 cents and an additional $0.50 for each topping. Ouch! That's about the same price (or more depending on how many toppings) as one Cinnabon at the mall or 2 Cinnabon inside Maverick. Yes, I know one is made vegan and the other isn't, but I'm wanting a tasty roll and not caring about beet sugars or cane sugars, just texture and taste matter to me. The cinnamon rolls I tried here had lemon frosting with fresh blueberries and chocolate frosting with Oreo cookies. The lemon frosting was really disappointing because the lemon flavor was very faint. I really loved the amount of blueberries they added and they tasted great. The chocolate with cookies was surprisingly good (hubby picked this one) however the rolls themselves were not great. They bake them in a toaster like oven and they come out fresh every 20 minutes, but after that long of a wait I expected a far better tasting cinnamon roll. I didn't care for the outer part of the roll it was kind of crispy and it was missing that super soft center most people crave from a cinnamon roll. 

Brownie ($2.50) - The brownie didn't seem baked all the way, it was gooey and not in a good way. It was very oily. 

Chocolate Chip Cookie ($2) - At first I thought the cookie appeared over baked, but decided to give it a try anyway. Wow! I was pleasantly surprised with how delicious this cookie was. Plenty of chocolate chips in every bite and it was soft and chew, not over baked at all. 

They are opening up a Cinnaholic location on my side of town, so I am up for giving them a try at some point. They currently do not offer any gluten free items.",Fv0e9RIV9jw5TX3ctA1WbA,63,55,3,L6F9mMh9-4EVVn71r-a_yA

First, I just want to say I'm someone who hates driving and cinnaholic is just about on the opposite end of my part of town- but yet, I still make the trip for these amazing cinnamon rolls! 

Cinnaholic offers a ready to pick menu or build your own options. If you choose to build your own you start with your option of roll and work up to all your toppings. The roll itself is $4.75, frosting is 25 cents, and each topping is 50 cents. They offer such a variety of frosting from your typical Vanilla to Amaretto and banana cream! 

We had a Twix roll- off the set menu, and a build your own topped with cookie dough, brownie, and chocolate drizzle. Both were equally as delicious!

There's such a great selection of frosting flavors, that I almost wish they offered a set of 3 mini buns to customize differently.  This option is doable, but might end up pricey.

As for my first and only cinnamon roll, I got the coffee icing with oreos and pie crumble.  Though it looks like the bun is drowning in the frosting (not usually my cup of tea), it is pretty darn good.  It's served to you hot - gosh I'm drooling thinking about it.  

Unfortunately, the drink menu isn't as appealing as the frosting and toppings menu.  While this snack is a definite treat, it is a much earned one at its price point.  Also, I feel like the experience needs to be vamped up a bit.  We were greeted when we walked in, but there wasn't much more interaction after that considering there were about 4 employees behind the glass and 2 of us in the entire store.  I'm not sure what I'm looking for but at nearly $7 for a gourmet cinnamon roll, I'd expect a gourmet level experience.

Upon entering this delicious store, your greeted by a group of friendly and helpful employees. They explained the concept of customizing your own cinnamon roll with your choice of frosting and toppings. Pricing per roll depended how much you put on your roll. I was overwhelmed with selection that they offered. However one of their employee suggested that I try out one of their specialty that are displayed in the pastry case. At that moment, my mind told me to get All but I ended up with a Pumpkin Pecan flavored cinnamon roll. Judging by the ones that were displayed it was more than enough for one person to consume but it depends how big of a sweet tooth you have. I initially wanted mine to go but with all the sweet aromatic scent in the store I decide to eat mine like a Heffer!

Actually, I grab a seat toward the back counter where you pick up your delicious roll and got a few essentials like a fork and napkins to savor my cinnamon roll. From the very first bite to the last bite was simply delicious and couldn't believe that I was enjoying a Vegan gourmet style cinnamon roll.

Order:
My husband loves peanut butter so I ordered him the highly suggested peanut butter cup and I suck with the classic. Our cinnamon bun was soooooo good. I also ordered a chocolate chip cookie that I couldn't eat because I was stuffed.

Menu:
The menu is a bit overwhelming because you can customize everything. Whatever you want they have it. They even have a menu of popular cinnamon buns to hell you out like SMORES, Apple Pie etc. They sell brownies, cookies, and even smaller buns.

We shared the Bananas Foster. Wow! The roll was good and the frosting on top was really delicious. I absolutely loved the flavor of the frosting. The bananas foster part was really tasty too. The roll was not tiny, it would be a large dessert for one and would probably be best split between two. 

It'd be cool if they had a mini roll option as well. I would love a way to try multiple flavors without eating more than the equivalent of one roll. Mini rolls would be a good way to do that or even a mini roll sampler.

Cinnaholic was always on my list of new places to try, but I never got around to it because I kept correlating cinnamon rolls with Cinnabon, which is not the most exciting cinnamon roll.

After I tried the original roll with vanilla frosting, I became more adventurous with their flavors. Every time I went in, I tried a different flavor combo. From seasonal flavors to fruity ones like Triple Berry, I ended up finding my favorite - a cinnamon roll with banana cream frosting. No matter how simple or how crazy your tastebuds may be, you CAN'T go wrong here.
Everything is customizable and made to suit anyone's flavor profile. Cinnaholic is a guilt-free way to indulge because you know that no animals were harmed to provide us with such delectable treats!

I am not Vegan, but I am always excited for that option, especially if it as just as good as the original.

I went with a friend and we each ordered a a cinnamon roll and then shared a tub of cookie dough. The cinnamon rolls are cooked to order so they are warm and gooey when you get them. I liked the concept of being able to choose frosting/toppings to customize you roll. I chose maple frosting with walnuts and my friend opted for cake batter frosting with cookie dough topping.

Mine was good, but far from spectacular. My maple frosting wasn't nearly maple-y enough and the walnuts on top were whole, not chopped, which made eating a little difficult. My friend felt that the roll was a bit doughy, but overall liked it. They are someone who normally wouldn't try anything that even says vegan...and they didn't know what they were eating was vegan...so the fact that they liked it says a lot. Neither of us like that their cookie dough topping was literally a raw cookie thrown on top.

The roll itself left me a little conflicted. As far as cinnamon rolls go, it was average. However, given that it was vegan, and knowing that vegan baked goods can be obviously not so good...I felt like that should get special consideration. If I judge against other cinnamon rolls I would give this a B-. If I judge against other vegan desserts I've had, I would bump it up to an A-.

The little? tub of cookie dough was excellent and neither of us could detect any difference in taste from a grocery store tube or something you would make at home. Taste and texture were spot on. 

I love that there are so many vegan/vegetarian options popping up all over town. Even without being vegan, I like having options. This is definitely a great option for a quick breakfast or dessert!

I like that they have multiple locations with evening hours. If you're a fan of cinnamon rolls you should definitely check them out.",4guhHcnzrximsz-DeEvskg,2,1,3,EFjcYCBls8tDaScwauL1NQ

I don't hate them, but I don't love them you know? So on trip to Vegas, a friend of mine said we had to go and who am I to stop someone from doing what they want on vacation? So I sort of begrudgingly came to Cinnaholic's with her and was actually pretty pleased with the experience.

So if you don't know (I didn't prior to this), Cinnaholic was featured on the show, ""Shark Tank"". These cinnamon rolls come in a variety of flavors and toppings. What makes them so unique? They are 100 percent vegan. It's like my two least favorite things had a child and made something pretty delicious. All of their products are dairy & lactose free, egg-free, and free of cholesterol- but full of flavor.

Options, options, options. So many options. Even from size of cinnamon rolls, you have your pick. I got a mini because I was totally afraid I'd hate it. The mini is kind of the size of a cupcake, which was perfect. You can choose frosting flavors like almond, coffee, maple, marshmallow, orange, and chai. And why not top it off with some coconut, apples, pecans, or almonds? Or just get the frosting. Or get it plain. Whatever makes you happy.

The kid behind the counter was super helpful. Very friendly and you can tell loved working there which makes the experience even better.

Now, I gotta say, I don't know if I'm truly reformed and want to eat cinnamon rolls from now on, but if I'm back in Vegas, I might have to get in my rental car and drive over here for a bun or two.",dsX3MiQiTy3OVI8MKn0I4w,6,3,4,LRrPZRjIBvaFS1zXk6s9Hw

It was my first time here and I was overwhelmed by how to order, but they have a display of some of their pre-made cinnamon rolls. There was another lady who had ordered plain rolls. She loves Cinnaholic so much that once she got her rolls, she gave me a bite so I knew how good it was. And it was! 

I ordered the Almond Joy and built my own with hazelnut icing, almonds and pecans. Both were delicious and both were eaten in one day! I'm going to have to control myself from going everyday because even though the rolls are vegan, they are filled with sugary goodness. The rolls I ordered came out to a little more than $13 but depending on what you put on yours, it could cost more. 

This place is definitely a keeper and my new go to for cinnamon rolls. They've outranked Cinnabon and I don't feel too guilty about eating two in a day. Bring your family here.

The best part is definitely that it is free of dairy and eggs--and they are very careful with nuts. Those with allergies or some type of intolerance to these products have less to worry about. The palm oil is sustainably sourced and the sugar is not filtered with bone char, making these scrumptious rolls vegan.

I have yet to verify if all of their toppings are vegan (for example: graham crackers regularly contain milk or honey, while marshmallows are made from gelatin), as I am aware that their frostings are. I'm not sure why they wouldn't be, seeing as how everything else is, but it's always good to confirm.

Being 100% vegan was not thoroughly advertised in the store. Though, I did see a sticker in the corner of the display case. To avoid holding up the line, I picked a fuss-free topping--walnuts. Unfortunately, those with soy and sensitivity to wheat will have to skip out.

I went on opening day; the process of ordering and picking up was self explanatory. There are plenty of options to choose from, and I have uploaded photos of what my family and I took home that evening.

Concept is similar to any build your own anytime. You start with a plain roll, you add what kind of frosting you want, toppings you want, and sauce you want. There is a ton to select from in each category so there are so many ways to make your cinnamon roll. 

There is also a build menu that they have created so you can order off that as well.

We tried the sticky bun creation and it wasn't very good. I had a bite and that was it. The roll itself wasn't soft, has probably been baked for quite some time. 

There was so much they added on top which made it sooo sweet, yes I know I got a sticky bun cinnamon roll which will be sweet I'm aware, but too sweet is not good.

Being a new vegan, these rolls have made me a happy girl. I love cinnamon rolls and can consider myself a master in their taste and these are incredible. They offer various toppings but I'm a basic cinnamon rolls with icing type of gal so I stuck with my usual. Their display of rolls looks delicious, esp the Captain America with peanut butter, strawberries, blueberries and strawberry sauce.

The toppings are great and I usually get cream cheese frosting and chocolate chips. The cookies and brownies are amazing too. If I ever am on that side of town, I would make sure I stop by their place and get something to eat. The problem I had was it was on the other side of town for me and driving there took some time, but worth it every trip. They have a rewards system and for every ten stars you get, you get a free Old Skool roll. I'm positive that I have gotten over 150 stars and probably spent the money just by cookies and cinnamon buns alone. I took my friends here to try it out and they all enjoyed it!

- Cream cheese frosting, strawberries, strawberry jam, chocolate syrup, and pie crust.  Another amazing combo!

I love the variety of frosting and toppings and I can wait to go back and try more combinations! Nothing was too sweet and flavors did not clash.  The texture of the cinnamon roll was soft and pretty good for it being a vegan dessert!

As I walked inside, I could smell the aroma of the bubbling cinnamon, yeast, sugar, and butter. I just about lost my mind, everything looked exquisite, with an extensive topping combination list. My advice before you walk-in just know what your craving whether it's chocolate, fruity, nutty, or salty-sweet then work way up from there.

The rolls are 100% vegan, dairy & lactose free made with high quality ingredients. I was shocked from the flavor coming out of rolls. I eat everything, I don't have any restrictions flavor is my driving force, however I will recommend this place to my Vegan friends.

The service is awesome, Aliscia & Marco are one of the nicest people I've come across, I believe they have as much fun making the rolls, as we do eating them.

If you love Cinnabon, you'll LOVE this place! 

Been dying to try this place. I heard a lot of great things about it, and plus, they were on Shark Tank! I told my Hawai'i friends who were visiting about it. So glad they chose this place to get dessert after lunch.  

All cinnamon rolls are made fresh daily. I wanted to try the baby buns, but they were still baking it when we got there. 

Here, you get to choose your own frosting and toppings. They have a huge list and variety of frostings and toppings to choose from. They also have popular combos in their display case if you have a hard time deciding. 

Even though I can't have much sugar and they didn't have the baby buns ready, I opted to get a regular roll with chai frosting and gingersnap cookies! Which is an onoliscious combination. I LOVED IT. The roll is huge! I only ate 1/4 of it. The roll was freshly made and soft. The frosting was seductively oozing down the roll. Yummmm. 

I didn't feel a huge sugar spike, so based on my experience I'm assuming it's healthier and has less sugar compared to Cinnabon.  

I also appreciated the way it's served if you dine in. A reusable plastic container and thick tissue paper (not sure what they're called) that can easily be packed in a to-go box if you can't finish it. No mess, no fuss. Easy clean up. I love how they use recyclable and compostable to-go boxes and not styrofoam.

My friends LOVED it and said they will come back to bring some home before they leave. 

Service was great, helpful and friendly. They also had a big screen tv towards the back with Friends on. 

There are only a few places I get cravings for and this is one of them. I will definitely be back! I'll have to pace myself with this one.",825Ol4rTvAZnUyFMke37jA,8,7,5,5-8es_ZiW5MX92hYq_m4tw

5278874,2018-04-11,7,YVd2yYNjpiFg2s4ToMRmPA,"It was almost immediately upon Cinnaholic's announcement of impending Las Vegas arrival that an e-mail was sent to corporate, a refusal to answer inquiries about Ingredients save for ""proprietary"" since expanded to a lengthy list on the website confirming suspicions that little is ""natural"" about the their Vegan Cinnamon Rolls but recent comments from a local Chef enough to justify a visit...if only to see for oneself if it was really as bad as suggested.

Now open for a year in The Mall at Grand Canyon with additional outposts in Henderson and Centennial, a win on the television program ""Shark Tank"" apparently enough to take an idea for DIY-Cinnamon Rolls mainstream, it was just past two o'clock that the small store was found to be empty, a smell of Cinnamon in the air and two young women quickly offering greetings with smiles on their faces.

In reality a simple concept not dissimilar to Fro-yo or Shaved Ice, fresh Baked Cinnabuns ready to be crowned with Frosting plus a vast array of toppings, guests at Cinnaholic are welcome to choose from over forty suggested varieties or build their own piece-by-piece, the former seemingly best to see how their ideas fare and one Bun selected to personal preference while the other was deferred to the servers.

Not a spot where one should expect to wait long, the ""Straight from the Oven"" slogan on a back wall sort of misleading as previously baked Rolls behind the counter are visibly extracted from a warmer, it was with The Rugrats playing on a television that two non-Cinnamon Roll options were tasted while waiting just five minutes, the Chocolate Chip Cookie lacking any crispiness much like Chewy Chips Ahoy while Cinnaholic's Brownie fares far better, the dense fudgey square one of Sin City's best and a deal at just $2.50.

Setting aside more than half of the Cookie and Brownie as Cinnamon Rolls were passed across the counter, one for now and another for later, it was with mild amusement that claims from others about the Dough appearing 'raw' were confirmed upon cutting into the ""Nutty Professor,"" a topping of what tasted more like Salty Caramel than ""Butterscotch"" pleasantly mellowed by toasted Nuts but the texture and color beneath not dissimilar from Wonderbread and thus off-putting, an identical situation found in the ""Crunchy PB & J"" which, although edible, does not justify the price compared to Cinnabon let alone better Cinnamon Rolls found elsewhere.

**Generally put off by eateries that hide behind claims of ""Vegan"" as though it means healthy, the fact that *most* should realize a Cinnamon Roll is never anything but an indulgence, it is more Cinnaholic's base that makes their product unappealing and in a city with the likes of CRAFTkitchen, Mothership, Joe Maxx and others making great Vegan Baked Goods there is really no reason to go here save for perhaps a Brownie or desire to watch Rugrats.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,15,8,2,oz_iMwm5_eESuyNAJMAT7A

I liked the carmel frosting, not overly sweet.  It was a nice size too. My only complaint was that the walnuts were too ""whole"", they needed to be crushed up a bit more. I'm not sure of the one my husband got but it was a messy one! Had pieces of brownie on top and chocolate sauce, he loved it though, said he'd get it again.
Our big disappointment was with customer service, I read all these great reviews about how friendly they were but the girl that waited on us was not great. It felt like we were bothering her, it was an effort to answer our questions.
My husband ended up adding on a cup of coffee, which both carafes were empty when he tried them. Finally a guy from the back helped him out and filled them but the coffee was bad and had coffee ground floating in it.

I have been on the look out for a savory, vegan dessert since quitting dairy back in January. (I can't eat it for health reasons.) Most places I've found either have really plain, gross, desserts, or are extremely expensive. I saw Cinnaholic on Yelp, and decided to give it a shot.

I was so impressed! I got a cinnamon roll with tiramisu frosting and cookie dough on top...omg....so good! I ended up sharing it with my fiance because I knew I could not handle eating all the sugar by myself. The roll was delicious, and I could not tell it was vegan. My roll cost me about $5.50, but I could see how it could easily get more expensive with the more toppings you add. But, since this roll fed two people, I thought it was well worth the money.

I made a custom made order and tried their caramel frosting with pecans on top. I wanted to try it out since I've always loved cinnamon pecan roll from Cinnabon, but unfortunately it was nothing like it. 

It tasted okay, but expected the pecans to be candied and bigger in size, not chopped up in tiny pieces. The sweetness was a little much, but make sure you drink a lot of water with it otherwise you'll get cottonmouth.

Basically, you pick your flavored icing and topping for your cinnamon roll off a board they have on the wall. I went with the amaretto icing and raspberries as a topping. The gentleman making the rolls asked if we wanted to wait for fresh rolls, which we did! (6 minutes). 
The rolls were warm and delicious. The amaretto icing was wonderful with the raspberries. I was incredibly satisfied. So much so that I brought in more family the next morning to try it out!

Now I can get amazing vegan buns in just 4 hours from my current location! I drove up this weekend and made this my very first stop upon entering the city.   It's a bit hidden within a large strip mall development, but it was fairly easy to find. 

They had about 27 base flavors and nearly 20 toppings for you to mix and match.  If you're not in a create-your-own mood, you can choose one of the specials showcased in their display case.  You can also get a plain cinnamon bun, if you're into that sort of thing. 

Chocolate chip cookies, brownies, and cookie dough were also available for purchase.

I got a Cotton Candy bun and a Butter Pecan bun, and my DD got a strawberry one.  They came out warm, soft, and tasty.  These buttery buns rival and beat all other; yes, even the non-vegan ones!

My bf & I have been going here for a while and what keeps us coming back is how delicious their ""Old Skool"" Roll is, which is just their basic cinnamon roll with vanilla frosting on top. We are huge Cinnabon lovers and this place definitely fills in the void and the fact that it's vegan is even more of a bonus! We have tried their other rolls like their Cookies & Cream and Banana Foster but were WAY too sweet for our liking, so we just stick with the straight up, no fuss Old Skool Roll. 

I do love the concept of the place and how you can make your own custom cinnamon roll by selecting your frosting (25 cents each) and your toppings (50 cents each) and they have a ton of choices! They also have other baked goods like cookies, brownies, etc. Also, they have a rewards system where you put in your phone number which is super convenient instead of having a stamp card. But I do warn that if you use their Yelp check in offer for 5% off your order and it's less than $5, your points don't count which is a bummer (I wish they told me beforehand). 

I do agree with other reviews that this place is pretty pricey for just a cinnamon roll but definitely give it a try if you're looking for something new and sweet to eat!",rKdGiLfeE55TClso9GtjsA,1,0,4,avCLw7guu2ZTnMmBaJT7WQ

He informed us that they make gourmet cinnamon rolls and that you can have any type of frosting or topping that you like. For those who like a basic cinnamon roll, they have those, too. I ended up ordering the Old Skool Cinnamon Roll (the basic choice), but I had them drizzle half vanilla icing and half almond icing and add a light sprinkling of pecans and a light drizzle of chocolate. My friend also ordered an Old Skool, but with cream cheese frosting. Those damn things are amazing! It was warm, the frostings really brought it together, especially that almond frosting! I have to definitely get that, again!

Their frosting flavors range from amaretto, lemon, maple, and cake batter to banana cream, caramel, chai, and marshmallow. Toppings include everything from graham crackers, coconut, cookie dough, and pie crumble to pretzels, rainbow sprinkles, brownie bites, and strawberry or raspberry jam!

They also do party packs, but you have to make sure to order ahead. How cool is that to serve gourmet cinnamon rolls at a party, instead of the traditional cake?!",nOv0AvP4doCU6Kg9ge-xFg,32,29,5,LPskoSCEFVIGUQfahxbz7Q

This is an easy ten minute drive from where we live and easy to find. This is another bookmark completed Yay!
We walked in and this cute little doorbell chime went off. There are tables to sit at and the decor is simple yet chic. I explained we were newbies and the helpful clerk walked us through the process. You choose your flavor and then add as many toppings as you like. Everything is vegan which is a plus in my book. I chose the Old Skool roll with vanilla frosting and pecans. My hubby chose the caramel frosting. I wanted to stick with the basic roll to first test out how the actual roll tasted. I was very pleased. The roll is super fluffy and light with a very pure taste. The frosting was yummy and I loved the pecans on top! My hubby loved his roll too and the caramel frosting was true in its flavor. They also had some sample rolls out paired with the maple frosting for anyone to try. Wow! So good! 

I noticed as part of the logo, there was a bird in flight. My curiosity got the best of me and I had to ask if the bird had a special meaning. I was told that this happens to be the favorite bird of the owner. The bird is a swallow. She wanted to make sure to differentiate her label from the other competition. 

Hands down, this is my new favorite place to score some tasty buns. I can't wait to try the other frosting flavors and toppings! I may require rehab if I become a Cinnaholic.....",Y3PQ5P_R7jcgiIS_1dIv-w,5,5,5,HEdoK5EgHjGF5tttVYLAdg

Ambiance- The first thing you'll notice as you walk in is the amazing smell of cinnamon that reminds you of baking at home. It definitely was a huge change of setting, and brought me into the world of Cinnaholic

Food- I was feeling adventurous that day, and I decided to try the Vanilla Frosting with chocolate chips and edible cookie dough. WOW. I was not expecting it to be the size it was. Great portions, AMAZING Edible Cookie Dough, and a fabulous treat.

I tried the Almond frosting with fresh peaches and will return with the family.

Fast and friendly service.",b3tK3CkLOfrWpSuvn9Yo1g,0,0,5,bWVKjjarnRiO46FhRqM-FA

I thought there's no way this exists, now I can't get enough it's so Amazingly Great! The flavor options, the specials, the freshness. You couldn't ask for a better product, and here's the best part.

My husband surprised me with one of these unearthly magestic cinnamon rolls and now I CAN'T STAY AWAY. The Chai frosting is omg good. Go try this place or not whatever more for me.,42D-hgfYwmWsNCvX81ujjg,2,0,5,3-kqjIDHcn6XXmD7vx3xzQ

But, as a first impression, we didn't get greeted at all walking in, and the lady who took our order was rude! 

We didn't really know what to order or how to navigate the menu, so I told her it was our first time. She then told us to just take the steps listed and then order from there. She didn't guide us on it or give any suggestions. 
Not a smile or a lick of care was given. 

We still ordered something regardless of whatever happened to her attitude. I was too excited for dessert!!!

It all tasted great!

I LOVE that's it's VEGAN! 

If I had to bash them on something food related it'd be that the icing is many a bit much? Too sweet if you ate it with all that comes on top. Especially once it melts down, you realize how much just goes to waste. 

But I also noticed that in this place it doesn't say ANYWHERE that it is Vegan? Maybe it might scare away non-Vegans. 

But regardless, I'd go back again 
(for the cinnamons buns, not the service).

5922201,2018-02-04,0,YVd2yYNjpiFg2s4ToMRmPA,"I've never been the biggest fan of cinnamon rolls. They've always just seemed to be a bit overrated and as much as I like sugar/frosting it always just seemed a bit much. All that changed when I discovered Cinnaholic after a coworker brought some in and opened up my eyes. 
I'll be honest with you, it's sweet. Very sweet if I'm being honest , but it's well glazed and not overly cinnamon-y. I also appreciate the fact that they have all sorts of flavors and you can customize them so it almost feels like you're at a customer bakery and not just for cinnamon rolls. I will say I also didn't believe they were vegan, which is mind blowing. I'm not personally Vegan, but I have enough Vegan friends that it's great to have another option. 
The only downside is that it is across from LVAC, so it is flavored with the additional guilt of a wasted gym membership, which is probably why it's so well loved.",KyMkKb5IohKb0S7v4Jv-oA,3,1,5,gdeigHzt9olVHGxACyVRzw
5959370,2016-08-16,10,YVd2yYNjpiFg2s4ToMRmPA,"I didn't care for the flavors from Cinnaholic. I ordered the lemon frosting roll with walnuts and raspberries. The icing had an unappealing flavor that I couldn't quite place. I also tried a bite of my friend's roll with a different flavor icing and I didn't care for it either. 

The texture of the roll itself was fine and I would be interested in trying other flavors to see if I found them more appetizing, minus the icing.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,22,13,2,A_M9ztpXZbN0lGgrN1P5LQ
5987025,2018-04-13,0,YVd2yYNjpiFg2s4ToMRmPA,"Delicious find!!! I'm not vegan but have an egg allergy. It had been at least 10 years that I had had a cinnamon roll, And was excited to try this place on the recommendation of a good friend in Las Vegas. Good thing the closest one to me is about 1.5 hrs away!  I would eat a cinnamon roll for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and all snacks. Lol. I ordered the cookies and cream, and ate the whole thing in one sitting. Delicious! My husband ordered the coconut cream pie. To take home, I created my own- caramel frosting, with blueberries, almonds,  pretzel sticks, and coconut. Sounds weird but it was delicious! I ate it 3 days later, and, warmed up, it tasted as fresh as the one I had in the store. 
The two young guys who are working in the store were extremely friendly and patient in helping the four of us decide what to order. 
I'm not a Las Vegas person, but aside from visiting my two closest friends there, this is one of the food places that I will have to visit the next time I'm in town.",B-ym088HX8oddqYIgJBqTA,0,0,5,pIRxG6ElP-fv_oNHvvPtmA
