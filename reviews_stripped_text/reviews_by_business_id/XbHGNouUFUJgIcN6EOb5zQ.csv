558782,2017-07-15,2,XbHGNouUFUJgIcN6EOb5zQ,"Had the misfortune of spending almost three hours at this place last night. We went there for an uncle's birthday dinner. This was our first and last visit. We have four small kids who need to eat fairly quickly so they won't get hungry, irritable and restless. 

We ordered a kid's water and they brought out an adult-sized water. I never received the water i had requested. My wife's margarita was lacking any tequila.
We asked for bean dip and we are told they don't serve bean dip. 

The server was nice enough but his service was confused, disorganized and infrequent.
This place is slower than the second coming of Christ. We sat down at 7:00, had to send out a search party to get our checks so we could leave after 9:30. We had a large party of 17 at our tables. We were one of the first to order and were the last to receive our cold food two hours later. We ordered food for our little ones which was also served cold two hours later. My wife and I ordered the steak fajitas for 2 which is way overpriced at $28.99. 

The waiter actually told us that they serve the food on individual tickets at the same time so everyone at our table ate at different times and not together. Another couple in our party ordered chicken fajitas for two which came out hot, smoking and sizzling. Our steak fajitas came out with no sizzle, no smoke and no heat. I actually said something to the waiter about our fajitas not sizzling and he smiled stupidly and said the cast iron pan is still hot. The waiter didnt offer to go back and bring us sizzling steak fajitas. The cold fajitas were tasteless and the steak was rubbery and congealed.

The food is crappy and overpriced. That combined with the indifferent service means you'd be well-advised not to waste any of your hard-earned money at this dump.",jW_PfMAKKWDpZ3dW4SghyA,2,0,1,X1lltmlNSaAhMmozmn-rkg

You do not use frozen vegetables in a dish or with a De Cameron Chile rellenos. The shrimp is small and the prices are ridiculous! It's not on or really near the strip so to have prices like that, I'm positive they will not survive and the atmosphere is mediocre. The hostess lied to us when we walked in and told us the food was good of-course. They tried to over charge us and then when I didn't like the dish the raves do much about, nor did my sister, I asked for 2 shrimp tacos and got 2 of them with 4 little shrimp in a flour tortilla and then have the nerve to charge $16.50 for that! The food is nasty, the chef needs to go back to school...but the bartender was super chill. I tipped her and after disputing the check with the Manager Caesar, he still was trying to make us pay $60 bucks! Not worth the time or money! I give it 2 stars because of the bartender only!

Yes this restaurant is very nice inside . I love the decorations. But having nice decorations does not mean the food will be good . What's the point of a nice place when the food taste awful . My mom ordered the chicken mole plate , mole was not from scratch it tasted more like it was from the Doña Maria , The chicken was not fully cooked . Which thankfully she didn't get sense she ate most of it . My Husband ordered the wet burrito he said it was okay nothing extremely bad about it . My soon ordered some nachos witch had more beans then carne asada on them . Also what makes nachos ""NACHOS"" is cheese don't be greedy with the cheese . 
My 18 month old had a sopa de fideo with no fideo in it only the broth , I did ask the server for a new one and showed him the soup . I ordered my self a disgusting Pollo A La Crema . Do Not Order this ! The chicken was not fully cooked it was still raw . The cream was not even seasoned at all it was just the cream no taste what so ever . I can say the only good thing was the rice and drinks that's it . I did tell the server and showed him the chicken he took it back offered for a new . I did not get a new one due to I was grossed out and couldn't eat any more . I do want to say that the server was very nice and he did attend to us .

1941150,2018-01-31,0,XbHGNouUFUJgIcN6EOb5zQ,"The enchiladas are great, the tacos are great, but what I really love is the chips and salsa.  I've had three different kinds there and they were all good.  They all have heat on them, so be prepared for that, but I love it spicy, so it was all good.  The food was not spicy, which was good for my wife.  They have taco Tuesdays where you can get three tacos for $7.99.  We had the carne asada and al pastor, all very tasty.  They also have Enchilada Mondays, which is all you can eat enchiladas for $12.99. Everyone there is very friendly and the service is good except for one minor detail.  If you ask for something, a high chair, napkins, anything, it seems to take awhile to get it.  Perhaps they were busy, or perhaps it's because we were located far from the kitchen, but whatever the reason it would take a few minutes for something that should only take 30 seconds at other restaurants.  However, I'm not docking a star for that because even though there was a wait, we never had to remind them.  I've been to many restaurant where you're waiting and waiting and it's obvious the waiter forgot.  These guys leave and they don't come back until they have what you asked for, which is why I think it's just a matter of distance or something. Anyways, I highly recommend Fiesta Mexicana.  They have tv's for football games all over the restaurant.  The atmosphere is bright and friendly.  The staff is attentive and welcoming.

1999517,2017-06-19,6,XbHGNouUFUJgIcN6EOb5zQ,"THE GOOD: Interior is very nicely decorated, with traditional art and hand-painted booths. It's really is quite nice and sets a festive but casual ambiance. The service is also extremely attentive and the menu is massive. Portions are decently sized. 

THE NOT SO GOOD: If you think $16 for a burrito and $8 for a side salad is reasonable then you probably won't have a problem with this place but I found the dinner menu ridiculously overpriced. Weekday lunch specials from 11AM-3PM are around $10/person, and I can understand pricing for some of their specialty dishes but they need to do some serious adjustments or they won't be around long. 

THE FOOD: Hit or miss for our meals. Chips and salsa were fresh but a crispy beef taco was extremely basic and the meat had no flavor. Combo with chile relleno and a chicken enchilada was okay but not great. I'd come back to try their enchiladas suizas or happy hour for a margarita, but the food isn't good enough to warrant what they're charging.

2212329,2018-03-17,4,XbHGNouUFUJgIcN6EOb5zQ,"I've been here twice now and I ordered the same dish each time. The seafood tostada is actually a seafood salad. You can choose different dressings, but the homemade jalapeno ranch dressing is creamy and not overly spicy. It's really good. Sour cream and chunky guacamole come on the side. The dish features a large crispy flour tortilla bowl with beans, lettuce, cheese, 4 large shrimp and a sauteed hot seafood mix consisting of green and red peppers, onions, octopus, scallops, shrimp, and I think I may have seen mussels, but I could be wrong. 

I asked for no peppers, but I was told they were in the mix and couldn't be taken out. I coukd tell they did their best not to give me many though. This time I only had 4. The last time there were more like 20. I would not have guessed it was a mix. A mix makes me think they were frozen previously. The peppers didn't look to me like they were previously frozen, so I guess it just will remain a mystery. Regardless, it's an excellent salad at a reasonable price and you have enough to share if you wanted to.

The thing that really wows me about this restaurant are the chairs. They're all hand painted and absolutely beautiful with scenes from Mexico. It adds a certain charm to the ambiance. The walls are brightly painted and it gives the bustling eatery a cheerful feel. 

Each time I've come with a party of 8 or more, and despite the menu saying they won't split checks, the attentive and friendly waitstaff absolutely do. We will absolutely be back.",IamJ-OX89_P-i-xkknwpPA,9,9,4,y90YkS5upW2R1v01Gkn2Xg

I will tell you this- I tell it like it is- This Place is very colorful, and the atmosphere is nice, But I'm here to get also Value for My $$$'s  It is way overpriced- unless your a Tourist- and Locals are way to smart that have been here and know exactly where to go.  The size and portion was small.  The chips are served in a small bowl and you need to get it refilled constantly.  The large margarita Glass- normally as a Bartender we call it the Bolla Grande Glass- is so Thick and Heavy by weight, that a average size lady can not even hold that glass in her hand, and is an optical illusion, to make you think that your getting a lot of margarita in your glass.  I didn't even feel any tequila, so I guess it was all filled with sweet and sour, and a dash of triple sec and result =  Lemonade, and not a Margarita.  That's just too bad, NOT even a nitch of buzz.  I guess you need to buy  about 6 Margaritas times (X) $ 9.00 before you can feel the buzz of the tequila.    Oh well- for Suckers that's ok, not for me.   Suggestion;=  Lower the Prices-  change that thickness of the Glass of Margarita, to a normal Glass- where the Lady's can actually have an easy time to pick up the glass. bigger size chips basket, and  salsa,  The tortilla a little thicker, and bigger-  The portion  size larger.   Compared to other popular Mexican restaurants.  you could be in Jeopardy?    The Food was not bad? but overpriced..",Db9I7W8iyDGagap6hym_Aw,2,0,2,4lOwhvsS-InZm4qaC3qqXw

My son had a shredded beef ""burrito"" which looked like an enchilada. A flour tortilla lightly rolled with some shredded beef in it. The beef was ok but nothing amazing. I tried the chile relleno and it was good. But that tamal! Yuck! It was undercooked and just yuck. You can see in the pic how it was still doughy-like and undercooked. I took a bite of it and took the rest to my brothers house for his dog to eat. I hate wasting food. 
The staff seemed to be obsessed with cleaning booths for some weird reason. Like they were obsessing over some small water spot! Weird! About 5 employees got involved into that investigation, LOL! Needless to say, I'm pretty sad that this place is here, I wish it was the previous Mexican restaurant it used to be:( or at least comparable.

Cons: Staff was inattentive. Errors in order. Ground beef was... Idk, strange.

We loved the decor as we came in, and did ask for a nearby table since my Grandmother has trouble walking. But we didn't mean in a unmanned section, just not in the gurthest booth. So we had very bad service. Though our server, Alan, was a very nice and friendly person, he wasn't a good server. We waited 5 minutes plus for water and chips and salsa and told him we were ready to order. He said he had to deliver another tables chips and salsa and he'd be right back. That took well over another 5 minutes. The food came quick enough and we requested extra salsa, he said he'd be right back, and never came. We had to get up and ask someone to get him twice for refills. But he never came to check on us without us sending people for him. By the time he did come we were almost done. My shredded beef enchilada had been a ground beef, which I certainly don't prefer, but normally would just deal. But the ground beef was strange, minced maybe? And watery? Like when I worked at Del Taco and the ground beef bag got water in it. Eventually we complained, which we honestly NEVER do. The manager was sexy, so that was nice, and he was apologetic and offered free dessert, but we declined. We didn't want free stuff just a nice meal out. I chose the restaurant based on it's good reviews so I feel like I have to offset that based on the experience. It wasn't cheap, and wasn't worth it. That salsa was great though. And my moms Burrito Mexicana with three sauces was very good.",0CiUNjNlq4EfycFBxLN5IA,1,0,2,xN6tOqqwsHakauhpF66WDg

4053676,2018-02-13,1,XbHGNouUFUJgIcN6EOb5zQ,"Fiesta Mexicana Las Vegas is a Americanized Mexican restaurant chain with one location here in Las Vegas. In my opinion, it is no bueno.

I wasn't really impressed with the food after my first visit to Fiesta Mexicana, but thought I'd wait to try more of the menu before posting a not-so-great review. After a second visit for lunch with 6 co-workers the consensus is that there will be no future visits. 

Service, while friendly, was so slow. Our waitress took our drink orders and then disappeared for what felt like an eternity. Over 20 minutes passed before our drinks were actually brought out; it took so long that we actually received a refills of the complimentary chips and salsa before we had our beverages, only one of which required much effort (a mojito, 5 beers and an iced tea). We had to ask for waters as well. 

I can overlook slow service if the food is exceptional. and I have not been impressed with anything I have had at Fiesta Mexicana. The salsa is ok, nothing to write home about but acceptable for complimentary salsa. The flautas were disappointing, as was the carne asada burrito. Portions are large, but the flavors are lacking for the prices being charged. 

There are numerous places in the general area I'd pick over Fiesta Mexicana for Mexican food.

Let's talk a biggie item of importance first - the chips and salsa!  Excellent chips and salsa with just the right amount of kick.  Some of the better chips and salsa here in my opinion.  


Next, the food.  I have had chicken a variety of ways here - chimis, chalupa, sopito - all use the same shredded chicken mix which you can actually taste the seasoning in (which is tasty). In addition, I have had chicken mole enchiladas (not my favorite here). Also, I have had a couple of shrimp items.  One was wrapped in bacon (good) and the other with mushrooms (very tasty - but had to pick up shrimp with garlic sauce with my hands and finish peeling them).  This is the best thing I have had here so far but I also had something different, a crispy fried chile relleno. It's almost like a wonton. It was different and I am pretty sure I liked it!  It got soggy fast but had I gotten to it earlier, it would have maintained its crispness and that's what was nice about it. So, overall - I like the food. 

The staff is always very friendly and attentive. And the place is ""festive"" on decor (like the name) providing a nice atmosphere.

I really enjoy this place and have it in my rotation of regulars",McDGTZ5J4ViG46PNrkPOfA,1,1,4,U3GCilCtT1UAQGZQ2OKIhw

I was very impressed with how great the food tasted. For $9.99 I was served a steak chimichanga , a chicken enchilada w rice and beans. Piping hot and fresh. Full of flavor. The waitress was super nice. Very clean facility and great decor. The only thing i would recommend is bringing the AC a little colder as it was pretty hot in there (granted its 110 degrees outside).

The salsa is very flavorful and has a good kick of heat. I also ordered the guacamole served with fried tortilla chips. Good, but I wish it more of an avocado flavor. 

The seafood tostado was top notch. The octopus was cooked well and tender. My desert was a margarita. It had a good balance of tequila and not too sweet with sweet and sour.

Once you walk in the ambiance makes you feel like you're in Mexico. It's bright, colorful and there's tons of artwork. My bae and I came for a late Saturday night dinner around 8pm so we were quickly able to be seated. 

I started off my meal with a cadillac margarita. That bad boy was HUGE & delicious. I definitely got a good buzz going from just one. Next was the complementary chips & salsa. I always judge a Mexican restaurant by their salsa and theirs was very good. They had two types, both seemed medium in heat to me & both were very tasty. For an entree I had the shrimp enchiladas. I love everything about them.. the sauce, the rice, the beans.. ughhh ALL of it. I also loved the amount of seafood they had on their menu. Being a pescatarian, their menu was heaven to me. The prices were a bit higher compared to other Mexican restaurants around the valley, but the quality shows. 

To top thing off our server was very attentive and friendly. We didn't have any complaints on anything. I will 100% be back here again. This would be an awesome place for a fun birthday dinner!",OXSJCjKtvZPf-YPDCXcWZg,4,3,5,wPCjMR1QV562GirdulyXeg

4722068,2018-02-14,0,XbHGNouUFUJgIcN6EOb5zQ,"We have been coming here at least once a month since they opened last summer.  So happy to have a great sit-down Mexican restaurant in this neighborhood.  Yes, it's Americanized, but I'm American and I like my tacos with cheese, lettuce, tomato and sour cream.  I think that's the best way to eat 'em up.     Many people judge Mexican restaurants by the chips & salsa, and I'm no different.  The house salsa is great.  It's medium spicy and has chunks of tomato, cilantro and scallions.  Ask for the habanero salsa and they'll happily bring a green style salsa that is really tasty with sliced scallions, garlic, and habaneros.  Yes, that one time, the chips weren't hot off the fryer, but they were still good chips and nothing to complain about.       The wife and I request to sit in the little booths adjacent to the bar.  The service has always been fast, attentive and friendly.  We enjoy the Cadillac Margaritas and the bartender always puts them together quickly.  The portions are large and we always need a to-go box if two entrees are ordered.  Lately, for a weekend lunch, we'll split the sampler platter from the appetizer menu, have a couple margaritas, and it's perfect.       On a side note, I used to visit the Page, AZ location on trips to Lake Powell back in the mid-2000's.  We always looked forward to stopping there after the 4-hour drive from Vegas.  The food at that location is great and the place is always packed in the summer.  I was so happy to see that they finally expanded close to home.",rBGStJwT8F31ZKfxR-3LDg,0,0,5,uKHJ4DS65USbge4_wjfjAQ

5445361,2018-01-30,0,XbHGNouUFUJgIcN6EOb5zQ,"This was our very 1st visit here...
I am a Mexican food snob! We drove up...to be perfectly honest we were thinking oh no...a white person Mexican restaurant! Now those of you who know Mexican and I mean real Mexican know that if you see a lot of white people walk out or are sitting down eating that it is probably very bland...very americanized! If you see mexican people at a Mexican restaurant, Italians at an Italian restaurant, Asians at an Asian restaurant...you know it will be good... we have turned and walked away from places that have had only white people eating in them...but I kept seeing such great reviews on Facebook about this place and we drove 30 minutes to get there...I thought we better try! 
So glad we did. We walked up to a very well decorated building, great atmosphere, mexican music playing on the speakers. We were greeted and sat immediately. Another waiter came and delivered chips and salsa and as soon as he walked away another one asked us what we would like to drink.
The chips were fresh...the salsa even fresher. Great flavor...not spicy..but full of flavor.
We ordered the chili con queso as a starter...warm delicious cheese, Ortega chilis...served with flour tortilla chips. Yum does not even cover how great it was. The cheese was so creamy and spiced just right and Noone serves flour tortilla chips anymore! 
The waiter was super attentive, asked if we had any questions, was very friendly and fun. We finally decided what we were going to have...it took me a very long time because so many things looked yummy. My man decided to have the chilie verde and I had a shredded beef buritto. 
The chilie verde was packed full of flavor. You could see that the chilies were toasted by the blackness in the sauce. It was spicy but not to the point it was unbearable. It had a Mexican slaw on the top that my man said was super tasty. The rice and beans were really good. Beans were creamy but still had some solid beans. Mexican restaurants for me have to have 4 good things...chips and salsa...and beans and rice! If they pass that then the rest will hopefully match up! My shredded beef buritto was packed full of tasty meat, very authentic. Wasnt packed full of filler like peppers and onions. The meat was tender and juicy!!! 
I have to say that we really enjoyed ourselves...not just with the food, but the atmosphere, the music and the staff. We will definitely be back!",KQkyAtAiSAfxSQ3GCd0QUw,0,1,5,gk6IXNK-XDesTI8s11MxTA

Our waiter, Elpidio, was fabulous! He was patient as we checked over the menu and even warned us that the kitchen might be a little slow due to large (obnoxious) parties in the restaurant. We ordered a three item combo to split, shredded beef chimi, shredded chicken chimi, shredded beef chalupa with beans and rice. Everything came out hot and steamy. It was delicious!!! The beef was tender and juicy and had such wonderful flavor. The chicken didn't have the same spice as the beef and STILL tasted amazing! The beans and rice were good. The atmosphere is fun.

Chips and Salsa: Excellent! Crispy, thin chips and three salsas to choose from. 

Liquor: Good. Small assortment of Mexican beers on tap, including Pacifico. 20 oz. came in a big frosty cup for $6.25. Milady had a mango margarita, which was very tasty. Probably could have used more tequila, but good nonetheless.

Food: Good. I had a combo with a crispy chile relleno (excellent), burrito and chimi. Milady had tacos al carbon, which were very tasty. Combo was $14, tacos were $16. Taco plate probably should be closer to $12, but good nonetheless.

Decor: excellent! Beautiful furniture and decor. Clean, clean, clean!! TV's everywhere and a really nice, cozy bar area.

Staff: Excellent! Everyone we dealt with was helpful and nice. We went on Saturday at around 8, so it was not too busy. Might have had something to do with the impeccable service, but I think Jesus is one helluva server.
