165812,2012-09-17,4,ZW5ReCY3B9_TekUYWhr7HA,"Let's get something out in the open: I absolutely love Japanese curry. I hadn't been able to try Kaba Curry at any of the food festivals it had been at, so I had been waiting in great anticipation for opening day of their (difficult to find) B&M location. I have to give these 3 budding entrepreneurs a lot of credit for trying, and truth be told, I really really wanted to like this place. Unfortunately, I am a Japanese curry snob, and just like so many of its brethren in town, Kaba doesn't make the grade. Its curry is way too watery and the spices far too subdued. It's also a bit too sweet for my taste. The chicken katsu is too small for charging $7. At a comparable counter-style curry joint in LA, you can get a heaping plate of curry rice with a chicken katsu at least 3 times as large and a side salad all for less than $6. It was also odd that it took 20 minutes to get my order. Shouldn't the curry and rice be all ready to go and the katsu take a few minutes to deep fry? I don't understand what took so long. It's not like they were busy.

At any rate, it's nothing personal guys. I wish you the best of luck, but I've got to tell it how it is. In my mind, if you want the best Japanese curry (that I've tasted so far), you've got to schlepp it all the way to Curry House in LA. I eagerly await the day when you can get great curry without leaving town.",LkWNo83Lg92C5V4JEyxOZA,4,2,2,3NyiA9W5U8NMlCwM2mp-ww

The food portion is great and the staff is really nice. Each food item really complements the other along with their drinks (big fan of the plum ramune and melon soda). They bring your food to you, which really gives it that nice dining experience. 

On special occasions, they play some really nice music. It's a great place to meet up with friends and they always make sure everyone is having a good time.

Kaba Curry is located in a cafeteria like location on Charleston near the College of Southern Nevada's (CSN) north campus along with other college friendly vendors for Korean food, Mexican, boba drinks and chicken wings.  Seems as though they've got the right idea:  FEED THE HUNGRY COLLEGE KIDS WITH COMFORT FOOD, otherwise it's pretty empty in the evening once all the students have gone home. 

Between the three of us we got pork katsu/Tonkatsu, chicken katsu, sausage and potato croquette.  The shining star of the set was actually the potato croquette.  It was fried to a golden crisp.  Huge crunch on the outside and creamy potatoey on the inside.  The curry sauce wasn't bad too, and the chicken and pork were not dry and quite tasty.

Conclusion:  They may be empty in the evenings now, but I think word will soon spread.  Get your Japanese curry fix before there are lines out the door!

1930733,2012-10-12,1,ZW5ReCY3B9_TekUYWhr7HA,"I remember the first time i've had Japanese Curry. A few guys i met in the barracks invited me to go with them on their weekly dinner ritual. I agreed and was happy to ditch the barracks room and see a little of the city past the gate. Long story short my first Japanese curry was a chicken katsu at level 1 spiciness from a Japanese franchise chain of curry houses which i cant remember the name of. 

Japanese curry is something A LOT different from other curries such as Indian or Thai. It's a lot different from the Vietnamese style curries i'm used to eating at home too. The curry is thicker and pure from other ingredients, usually, and is flavored a bit heavier but smoother as well. 

Now back to the present and i find myself FINALLY in front of Kaba Curry and they're fully equip to give me something more than a sample cup (First time i ran into these guys was at aniMEGAcon). Ordered a Chicken Katsu with spinach as a topping and thanks to the Yelp app i was awarded another free topping, ended up with mushroom.

Before i ate i already had an opinion of the curry and already decided that it wasnt going to be true authentic Japanese curry. After the first bite i pretty shocked from how non-authentic it was. Then i recalled the ordering process. Anthony, one of the owners/partners, never asked if i wanted it spicy. The first initial flavor was curry then a subtle sweet smoothness at the end.

After the shock of realizing this REALLY wasnt what i was expecting at all i started to enjoy it to the point where i was scraping the to-go box for every grain of rice down to the last drop of curry. 

The rice was perfectly cooked, moist, and fluffy. Anthony tells me brown rice is in the works so look out for it in the future (yay!).

The curry wasn't what i was expect but who needs expectations when it's just that good?

The Katsu chicken was very good on it's own. Light breaded and crispy exterior with a moist center of white meat chicken breast. 

I would definitely recommend this place.",7A7FOLZZKL0iokQVOAEbgA,7,4,5,JHWOuPfl9EqwlJ71UZBJDw

The other dish we got was the loco kaba moco which is rice, hamburger patty, egg and instead of gravy like usual it's covered in curry.

The curry was very flavorful and had some heat to it but nothing overwhelming. Everything was cooked perfect and had so much flavor!

After the success of these shows,  a few more series started coming to our picture tube at home.   Then one of the biggest Japanese cross-over shows came out as Gorenger, which was later bought for the fight scenes for  the Mighty morphin power rangers series.    Well, in Gorenger, there was the Yellow Ranger who ate curry like it was 1999....and If I had a Chance, I would be going off like that guy at Kaba.

First of all, I love curry!   It can be Japanese or Thai, but being from Hawaii, I have a slight favor for Japanese style curry, and I can make a pot of it, and eat it for three day straight days of ; breakfast, Lunch, and dinner.    So I was pretty happy to see a brick and molter Japanese Curry joint in Las Vegas.  

I'll have to admit,  I hardly turn down this part of Charleston, and usually stay on Rainbow, so I sadly missed the turn into their parking lot because of a large brushes that hides the turn into this place,  and I had to make U-turn back..  Oh well, it was no big deal, but I was staving hard  and made a hard U, and turned back.  

When I got there, it was past 9 pm, and Kaba was the only restaurant opened in the building, and I was greeted nicely by one of the owners.   The menu is pretty straight forward, and I picked out a Beef curry with a side of potato croqette.    Within five minutes, I got my plate, and I have to say it was pretty good!    I was trying to figure out what was the sweetness to this recipe, and believe it was graded apples.    The plate wasn't the biggest plate, I ever had, but the base price was good.

They have their own taste, a little sweeter & more ""molassy"" if that is even a word, but decent enough.  I was intrigued by a few items on their menu.  Disappointed that they don't offer deep fried oysters.  We had the Loco Moco and Fried Rice with chicken cutlet.  The Loco Moco was surprisingly small, in a small bowl, but held enough curry sauce.  The Fried Rice on the other hand barely had any sauce on it.  Had to ask for extra sauce ($1.50).  But I have to give them points for the tasty fried rice.  Also disappointed that you have to order Fukujinsuke ($.50), instead of having it on the table like most other curry restaurants I've been to.  Planning on trying Zen's curry very soon.  We'll see how they compare.

Update:  Just tried Zen's curry and it blows this place out of the water.  It was the quality of the curry sauce. Hands down. No argument there.  Each table comes with condiments for you to personalize your curry.  No extra 50 cents for a sprinkle of Fukujinsuke.  And they serve deep fried oysters.  Overall, Kaba has some work to do on quality.  For example, how special is a curry loco moco or grilled cheese sandwich if the curry itself is just mediocre?

3607166,2013-02-06,1,ZW5ReCY3B9_TekUYWhr7HA,"I haven't been to a Japanese style curry house since leaving Japan. My tummy was excited to try Kaba Curry for the first time. I was anticipating a rich, thick and silken curry loaded with vegetables and beef like I had in Japan or even a delicious version of the curry my Japanese mom and I make at home using S&B House Golden and Vermont Curry roux bars. The owner is Japanese so I had high expectations. 

Sadly, my expectations were way to high. I really wanted to like it and support this establishment.  The portions were skimpy. The three kiddy scoops of rice in a shallow pool of gravy with a poor version of chicken karaage  wasn't what I was hoping for. The gravy had an odd ""tonkastu sauce"" taste and the consistency of pureed vegetables in the gravy made it like runny baby food.  I ordered the basic curry with chicken karaage and fukujinzuke  for $7.49, $.61 tax and $1.00 tip my bill was $9.10. Not a vallue at all. If the food is excellent, I don't mind paying more even if the portion is small.  However, I won't return if the quality, taste, value and portion size is poor.

Not only did the food fall short.

I used a debit card and they ran it through a card reader attached to an IPAD.  That was fine.  I thought however, it was rather forward to ask for customers to click on the following buttons to leave a tip. $1.00, $2.00, $3.00 or ""No Thanks"". Why ask a customer to leave a tip before they have eaten your food?  This was my first visit.  I felt I was put on the spot to tip.  I was hopeful I was going to have an excellent experience so a added a $1, but that was with reservation because I really wasn't sure if it was deserving if I hadn't eaten yet.  A tip, in my opinion, is for a job well done.  I am rather annoyed with how businesses have abused tipping. Tipping has become an expectation  and not something that the person wanting the tip should be striving to obtain. Take the humble and tasteful approach- have a tip jar on the counter. 

There is no competition in this town for Japanese curry rice.  I was hoping it was going to pack a punch and have me craving for more. It's a shame because the owner and worker were friendly.  I wish them all the best!",wi0dVER4HBLYEmYHoqu-Ew,2,0,1,GkWdofXLxN0kVxXVCMnypg

Most curry favors I've tasted have that really strong spice and herbal mint taste too it which I can't have too much of and most that I have tasted is more brothy. This curry had a good amount of curry for you to enjoy the flavor without feeling like the spice was taking over your taste buds. 

Thankfully they were at the Night of the Living Neon event and was super thankful to have finally tried this craze that everyone keeps talking about! The staff was very friendly! They guided me through some suggestive choices. The staff explained that each element or ingredient incorporated into the curry can make a HUGE difference on the taste and experience in your mouth. So, all the more reason to go back for more! I tried the beef curry with corn, then the beef curry with cheese, and then with both. I personally liked the corn. It was a really good element to the curry and the beef. It does combine well with the curry. 

Their service was on point and have to admit that their cheery and enthusiastic personality and service does reflect the quality of their food as much as their hipster graphic mascot and company colors!

If you ask me, what more can you do than to support a bunch of people who dreamed up an amazing concept and food and doing what they can to get this out there! Why hide something truly amazing? It doesn't matter HOW they serve it, WHERE they serve it, or WHAT stand point they are in as far as an establishment. What counts is a person or a group of people coming together as sharing something amazing to the public and letting them experience something good too! THAT'S WHAT A LOCAL BUSINESS IS ABOUT. 

Service is great. Staff is amazing and hip. Most of all, the food is good enough for seconds! Can't wait to see you guys grow into something bigger! High fives all around!",a48HhwcmjFLApZhiax41IA,2,3,5,iVaL_JF4lOPNTb7AercO0w

Well kaba beats the pants off the instant kare raisu I make at home. Like, seriously. The sauce is a great consistency- not too thick, not too thin. Rice- perfect cooked. And the chicken katsu- YUM YUM. Seriously, I can't think of a better combination of flavors: plain white rice, the complex curry sauce, and the yummy crunch of fried chicken. My friend who was with me at streats took a bite of my curry, and while she normally only enjoys simple typically american foods, she was pleasantly surprised by Kaba and said ""wow!

1) Pick your base (base, cheese fries, fried rice, udon)
2) Pick your sides (meats, veggies, proteins)

I ordered the Curry Udon with Karaage. The chicken was juicy and not overly battered. I like Karaage more than Katsu usually and it met my expectations. I really liked the soupy curry with the Udon because I believe you can taste the curry more(instead of over rice).

It was $5.50 for a medium bowl filled with rice,curry, cheese, corn, one chicken breast strip katsu (Thanks Kaba Curry for using white meat!!) and one piece of Potato croquette- 
Well, let me clarify the price- $5.50 is for the basic Chicken Katsu, curry sauce and rice- cheese and corn were .50 cents each to add and $1.00 for the potato croquette. So, with all the little add on's it can get pretty pricey.....
The amount of food could be more in my opinion....
There are other add in's like spinach,pickled baby onions, extra rice ect..

I was surprised and disappointed to see that we were only given one piece of a chicken strip - in the picture I thought there was at least 2 pieces....
 And $1.00 for a small piece of potato croquette isn't cool either.... 
-Most potato croquettes are good sized patties-

 Now onto the taste- Yummy!!! I did enjoy the taste of the curry very much - right amount of spice and I love the little pieces of carrots in there - I love carrots - there should be more carrots!!!!

Kaba Curry if you are going to continue using those little bowls them make sure they are filled up so that everyone gets there fill and doesn't leave still hungry cause don't we all hate that???

I found it to be quite good, the texture wasn't runny and it was a little spicy (not sweet).

The location wasn't hard for me to find, since I used to frequent the ""food court"" back when I used to attend CSN. When ordering, the guy used his iPad (which I thought was cool) as the register.

While taste is subjective (I would give taste a solid 2.0), I had to give it a 2.5 and grudgingly round it up to a 3.0 because I do not see the value ($7.99) for six small bite-sized pieces of chicken and 4 small pieces of tofu that still left me hungry.

CSN students are very lucky to have this near campus...

There are tons of provided curry options, a few non-curry options, with lots space to customize as well; it's always great when you can count on a menu and add-ons to satisfy almost any taste and profile. You can do a very traditional curry with just sauce and potato, but you can go all the way up to having spam and/or shrimp gyoza on your curry. The serving sizes are generous for the price, and can be shared if you and your partner are not particularly hungry, but not excessive. The dishes are cohesive, mildly sweet, and satisfying, like Japanese-style curry sauces and dishes should be. The green tea desserts are made with great matcha. Bullet-proof deliciousness there. Definitely trying the chantilly dessert next time.

I love the attention to detail the staff has as well, providing extra spoons when they know you'll be sharing, and remembering people from past visits. That extra touch goes a long way - as a result, it seems that Kaba Curry has quite the loyal following, and for good reason!

The parking lot was empty and there was no signage.  I was starving after getting out of class and wanted to try something else around the area.  I've never been to Campus Commons (even though school is just a few feet away) so I thought I got punked!  I don't normally crave for curry but after the Yelp event 2 nights ago, I had to have it again.  I originally planned on coming back here next week after finals but the urge to have curry STAT was far too strong.  I also had to claim my free green tea Kaba cakes.

The thing I love the most about Kaba is that you can pick a base (curry base with rice, curry fries or fried rice for like $5) then mix and match toppings (beef, chicken katsu, tonkatsu, chicken karate, pork, veggies, potato korroke, lumpia, Japanese sausage, deep fried tofu, spam katsu for $2 each) and sides (corn, cheese, spinach, mushrooms, fukujinzuke, ichimi, rakkyo for 50 cents each). Food democracy!  The ordering process is simple and efficient.  They have a list of options and just circle what you order.  You can have your receipt sent to you via text message or e-mail - save the trees!  On your 5th visit, you get a 50% discount!

So, today I ordered the curry base with chicken katsu, potato korroke, corn and mushrooms x 2 for my sister and I.   There was a 20-minute wait because they serve your food hot and fresh, and the green tea cakes take a while. It's Aloha Friday so, everybody must stay calm.  One of the peeps that runs the place gave me inside information which was a smart move to distract me and it worked!  So, tomorrow the curry udon will be on the menu.  In the next few weeks, expect: curry pizza, melon float with green tea ice cream...I should have left them my number so they could call me when the day comes. But yes, the food is great and the curry isn't overpoweringly spicy.  The green tea cakes were steamed so they were soft moist.  They look like mini doughnuts without the guilt.  They come with a small cup of  green tea frosting.  G-double O-D good!!!

5390416,2012-09-16,0,ZW5ReCY3B9_TekUYWhr7HA,"The Internet Cafe on Charleston across from the CSN Charleston campus where I work has always been an enigma of sorts to me.  In 6 years of working here I literally had never heard of anyone mention eating there even though it's within walking distance.  I knew it had a somewhat revolving door of restaurants that inhabited it and yet I never heard a word about any of them being any good, nonetheless what they even served.  Until Kaba Curry arrived, that is.

I'd heard or read rumblings of Kaba Curry through some of the food truck appearances they'd made, though being someone who prefers to eat sitting down and in climate controlled conditions, I figured I'd never get to try them.  Once I heard they would be overtaking one of the Internet Cafe storefronts, I knew that I would be killing two birds with one visit.  

Upon entering the Internet Cafe from the south side entrance, Kaba Curry was immediately the first stall on the left side.  There are really only a few options as far as curry goes, you either go with Beef or Chicken Katsu curry, and then there are a series of add ons for about 50 cents a piece that include cheese, corn, spinach, additional rice, potato korroke, and some onion looking thing I'd never seen before.  I went with the beef curry with added corn and spinach.  It was presented in a styrofoam container without a bag at first and I had to ask for a bag as I intended to take it to go.  Simple mistake and I never specified I wanted it to go either so no biggie.  The cashier placed my order in a bag and I was on my way.  Word of warning:  I'm not sure if the container they placed my food in is the typical ""to go"" packaging, but as I was driving or carrying it back to my office, curry started spilling out of the container into the bag and it ended up being quite messy to pull the meal out to eat.  

Digging in, I really enjoyed the flavor of the curry.  It had a nice thickness and had a nice level of spice.   It actually reminded me quite fondly of the packaged Japanese Golden Curry you can get in stores that my mom makes (shoutout to mom).  It came with several scoops of sticky rice which tasted delicious smothered in the thick curry.  I thought both the corn and spinach were worth the extra $.50 each, and next time I will try the korroke and maybe the onion add ons.  The beef tasted pretty average, but combined with all the other flavors on the plate it was a very good, reasonably priced meal overall.   They actually had some side dishes available that I didnt see listed anywhere on their website or mentioned in any reviews here.   Thinking on it now I realize I should have snapped a pic.  I didn't pay too much attention to those offerings as I was set on trying curry.   

In the future I'd like to see even more topping options as well some upgraded drink offerings, as they only had Coke, 7up and Arrowhead bottled water available.  At this point I'm happy to have a new spot in my lunch rotation that's so close to the office.

Thus, Yelp to the rescue!  I popped in nearby eateries and got a hit for Manna, a Korean joint that has 4+ stars with 15 reviews.  Further investigation was warranted...little did I know that the place was a food court, right under my nose not more than two blocks away.
 
The first place I bumped into was Kaba Curry, a place ran by a buddy of my be and I have never been able to try it since I am rather find of my own home made curry.  Interestingly enough, there were four other joints in here including Manna, Wing King, Weeziana and Counter Cuisine, all of which I need to take a train check on since they all have menus that sound amazing.  Yet today, is Kaba Curry day!

I asked my boy what was good, he replied, ""go with the Kaba Loco.""  So I did just that.  The dish includes a hinge made hamburger patty topped with an over easy egg on for scoops of white rice drowned with Japanese curry and a rich of red pickled ginger.  The buggah broke da mout but could be a little bigger imo!  I smashed on it so quick that I regret not taking my time.  So I ended up grabbing a spam musubi at Manna. 

Although the initial trip was to try out Manna for the first time, not knowing that my co workers and I would run into a hidden hole in the wall food court just outside CSN.  A blessing in disguise indeed.

I noticed lots of people asking for Kaba's cheese cake as well, unfortunately they were out, but it looks like it's all the rave.  I will most certainly be back to try the other menu items as well.  Best believe.

In addition, you can expect me to be back to try out the other nearby eateries as well.

Recently I was finally here at the brick and mortar abode of Kaba Curry to ordered and tried their entree portioned curry rice + spam katsu (love the non-mail related spam but surprisingly never had it prepared this way before).  The curry was decent, but the spam katsu was a total treat for my mouth. If you love spam, then I highly recommend this side order for your curry order.

Their menu is pretty simple and digitally displayed on their flat screen monitor. You decide if you want their [A] Kaba Loco Moco Special or [B] choice of steamed rice, cheese fries or fried rice ($4.99 to $5.99) with your curry order and tack on as many sides ($1-$2 each) and toppings ($0.50-$0.75 each) as your wallet and stomach can handle. Oh yeah, can't forget [C] desserts.  Fork over the mullah or swipe the plastic. Then wait patiently... and select one or more of the following optional activities or one of your own creation: meditate, people watch (if there are any interesting characters around) or stare deeply into your cell phone as time slowly drains away from your invisible life meter... while waiting for your name to be called,  then walk briskly back to the order window/counter to pick up your order for immediate or near future digestion.

The service was good and friendly on my visit. But it took a bit longer than expected for the food to be prepared and available for consumption. Luckily I was there with some friends, so I did not have to scroll through myriad images posted on Instagram or otherwise distract myself with other mobile games on the phone.

Will I be back? I most certainly think so.

Food:  3.5/5  Katsu-fied Spam for the win.

Service:  3/5  Friendly, courteous, but not fast food take-out quick as I thought it would be.

Price/Value:  ?/5  It all depends on how extensively you want to customize your meal.

The location is a bit odd - found near the entrance of a Internet cafe/food court. But it's not too far away from home, so I can't complain. At least you won't have to worry about waiting for a table here, which is a plus. The menu is small but simple. I have only tried the chicken katsu and will continue to order it because it is the Bomb!! Lightly breaded (not heavy), moist, and easy to cut into pieces without a knife. I don't know how they do it, but they make it so perfectly! I wish I could make chicken katsu that well at home. It is seriously that awesome, you won't be disappointed! The curry is thick and chunky with small pieces of carrots (I believe) but you can't taste them at all. Trust me, I don't really eat carrots. It is also a little sweet and slightly spicy, but not to the point where my mouth is on fire. I am also hoping that they will have a brown rice option in the future. 

As you can tell from my check-ins, I have already been back a few times and will be back for many more. We met and talked with the owner, who is from Hawaii. Even a better reason to support this curry business! Don't forget to check in on yelp to receive one free topping! Also, follow them on Facebook because sometimes they close early due to holidays or events that are going on and will announce thier hours.

Hooray for an awesome curry place in Vegas! Finally!",FOoN3DJzDUnl4EAQaTJIGg,5,3,5,vGhkStiPyBDlrPggdd_RbQ

A couple of my friends and I decided to come in to eat here and they were absolutely amazed at their first curry house. :D
The menu has basic kurry type meals that you can add things on to it in order to make it your own. I always order big, because I have a huge appetite so I ordered the regular kaba curry  meal with spam katsu, lumpia, and extra rice. (This is where the plating deceived me which you will know exactly what I'm talking about when you order. ;o ) I thought it wouldn't be filling, because the pictures look small. ): BUT I WAS SO WRONG. I was soo full at the end of the meal.
The atmosphere makes you think of an ""All That"" 90's cafeteria, which is very nice for the young vibe there. But bring your whole family and order some Kaba Curry. It's a very nice Japanese curry place. ^___^~",8R9VwgFnj3f2JveLAQnCJg,3,3,5,u6C7WlLAtl11eYNU564vzw

I decided to bump it up another star because I can't get enough of the curry here.  I am seriously addicted.  Although it is a food court that caters to college kids, the curry has me coming back again and again.  I take my orders to go.  And I have to do everything in my power not to tear open the bowl of curry goodness while I am driving.  

In my previous review, I was disappointed that I did not have a say in the spice level.  Well, I was wrong- all I had to do was just ask.  Ask and you shall receive. 

Be on the lookout for the yellow signage in front of the building, guiding you to the land of perfect potato croquettes and delicious curry. I may just have to stop in later today...before the withdrawal tremors kick in.",sEpOSEvfLgatlavQKYE7GA,5,3,5,Z0-GeC7DSxob68vwxLV8jQ
