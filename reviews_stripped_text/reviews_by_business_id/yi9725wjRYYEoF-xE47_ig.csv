The tacos were flimsy, the burrito was filled with too many beans and the quesadilla  (probably the safest Mexican food anyone can buy) tasted like processed cheese and I don't even know where the meat was).

Bottom line: there are better places you can go for Mexican food (including the little stand on the corner across from Walgreens)",xpaaV9oV9A6RfxsQjA5H7A,0,0,1,iaN86UykCjlqPQ2HV_mcJg

We found El Nopal while wandering the upper mall level on a trip to Vegas in August 2011.   I love Mexican food and had to try it.   We split the nachos and I had a burrito.  The burrito was good, the meat was tender and everything was fresh and made to order.  The nachos were freakin' incredible!!!  There was so much on the platter it was hard to find a place to start.  What made everything better was the salsa bar.  Again, the little things impress me, and while the selection was a bit limited, the tomatillo salso and the pico de gallo were fabulous.  A couple days later, we went back for more nachos after a night of drinking.  They were perfect again.  We had lunch one more time before leaving.  I stuck with the burrito, this time shredded chicken, and it didn't disappoint.  The last time, there was a bit of a wait, but worth it and the staff brought our order to the table when it was ready.  We went back again in October with friends and again the nachos were a hit.  Clearly the best thing they serve, in my opinion.  We went for the breakfast one morning and it was just ok.  

If you want some awesome nachos, and good salsa, check this place out.  It is quick, cheap, with generous portions and I found the staff to be super friendly every time.  There are probably better Mexican restaurants and it is important to note that they advertise as Mexican-American food.  All I know is that my next trip to Vegas is already planned and I know I'll be going back.",SUF3ApfxDKhm3xLJYZEDAA,1,0,4,yD0Dgq7bz-tam9ss5W6hXw

I have tried numerous items on the menu and I have not been disappointed yet.
I came on a Monday morning with a little hangover! craving Menudo, I decided to give it a try. I waited patiently, and was getting a little frustrated because it was taking a while. Then, the young man brought my Bowl, OMG... it looked and smelled great. This bowl had plenty of meat, just how I like it. I was starting to panic! no crushed red pepper, and what about all the other trimmings. Then, as I looked towards the salsa bar, Hello. All the trimmings! fresh onion, cilantro, limes and fresh red Chile salsa that was Bombay. This was honestly one of the Best Menudo's that i have had, it was on point.

I AM Mexican. So the fact that I was inside the stratosphere, and saw Mexican food. I figured it had to be better than McDonald's.

Turns out their quesadillas are pretty decent as were their nachos.

But what bumped this review to 4-stars are their breakfast burritos! After a long night of drinking, the breakfast burrito was THE perfect way to soak everything up. I substituted bacon/ham with grilled chicken.

Dear god. It was amazing. Not only do they mix the hash browns with cheese and put a layer of it all around the inside of the tortilla/burrito, but the addition of the grilled chicken, then topping it with tapatio really made it fantastic.

I was so happy. I couldn't believe I found a good, hangover burrito in the Stratosphere.

But stay we did because were hoped it would be the ""hidden gem"" other yelp reviews described. I got the carne asada nachos and frankly they were the worst nachos Ive had in a long time. The chips were stale and straight from the bag with the rest of the toppings not being fresh and definitely tasting that way. The steak was serviceable, but just barely.

The first time we visited this Mexican eatery, we were under the influence of Jose Cuervo while visiting the observation deck at the Stratosphere hotel and casino. Often when you are under the influence, everything, and almost anything tastes delicious. 

This time around, the Mrs. copied me
and had chicken enchiladas and she remarked that they were very good. The steak quesadillas are very good and I gobbled them right up. They are so cheesy and the steak is chopped very small which helps it go down easy. 

You can eat as this place on a budget. Everything is priced at $8.99 or less, so you're not going to break the bank to have an enjoyable meal. They have a wide variety of salsa and dipping sauces to satisfy any pallet.

3083317,2009-08-26,1,yi9725wjRYYEoF-xE47_ig,"I was expecting to be crushingly disappointed when I walked into El Nopal. For any lover of Mexican cuisine, *all* the red flags are there--location at the Stratosphere across from Perfumania; sign advertising ""Mexican and American food"" in requisite national colors; kitschy, Aztec-derived decor; Carribean salsa masquerading as Mexican music. Nonetheless, I decided to enter and made a shocking discovery. 

This place makes an amazing, authentic carnitas burrito!!! I've been on the quest for carnitas for over 20 years, and it's rarely prepared correctly. You know what I mean--that grey, pulpy crap with globules of fat that often passes as pork. Ideally, it should be lightly crispy, chopped in small pieces and well-seasoned with salt and cilantro. When it's done right, a thin stream of grease should collect at the bottom of the tortilla. And that's exactly what I got here!

Take in mind, I don't believe in ordering a burrito with tomatoes or lettuce. When you're eating fried pork, there's no reason to dampen the flavor with off-season greens. So here, I ordered the burrito with meat, refried beans and rice inside the tortilla. A bit of tomatillo salsa verde on the side (provided free at their salsa bar) and that's it. 

With the substitutions, the burrito came out to $10, with a few XX Ambers for $3.75. Not the cheapest bite in town, but filling and tasty. Take in mind, I'm not going to vouch for any of the other items on the menu. I also have a difficult time believing what I experienced, and plan on returning soon to see if it's a fluke.

The girls and I were staying at the Stratosphere and after a hard morning of drinking we wandered down to the restaurant level on our way up to the Observation Deck.  After grimacing at over priced McDonald's and cringing at the scent of hot dogs and pastrami we found El Nopal tucked in the corner. 

 I was pleased to find that the food was decently priced as this was a total budget weekend for me.  The three of us opted to split shredded chicken nachos which we devoured.  I've never encountered nachos where you have more ""stuff"" than chips and these were them.  We also ordered a side of rice in hopes of soaking up some of the booze in our bellies and it was actually really tasty.  I think the three of us were satisfied for about $8.  Woo!  

The next morning we rolled, bleary eyed, out of bed and all we could mumble was ""eggs, bacon, breakfast burritos...""  My two eggs and bacon and a Nerga Modelo was under $10.  The eggs were cooked well and the bacon was gloriously greasy.  Throw in some toast and hash browns and I was almost human again.  Vanessa R. said the tacos were sub par and other non-Yelper friend said the burrito was ca-ca, but I wasn't grading too hard I suppose. 

I will gripe about how long it takes just to place your order.  Both visits in a 36 hour period began with us watching the lone cook work the griddle while we waited for someone else to appear to take our order. We got no ""be right with you"" or ""just a sec' which goes a long way with me.  It also a shame there is so little seating.  Whenever we walked by the place looked packed and before I had put my napkin in my plate a woman was breathing down my neck like a vulture.  Also too bad they close pretty early.

Next time I stay at the Strat I'll stop by and see if this was the booze talking or just the prices...",Rd_UNnJ3TEd8Xa3bykWahw,3,2,4,YDPEHFKIoT9x1GEIwn5u8g

The horchata here is delicious. I ordered a carne asada wet burrito. My sister got enchiladas and my dad got a taco salad. The menu selection is wide and so there are a lot of decisions to be made. You can help narrow your choices by choosing the form of food (e.g. tacos, burritos, and enchiladas). My sister's shredded chicken enchilada was better than my burrito and my burrito was better than her shredded beef enchilada. The shredded chicken was nice and moist.

My family and I decided to come back the next day for breakfast/lunch. I got the shredded chicken enchilada and again it was good chicken. I was also able to consume the refried beans with the rice quite happily. Finally, I had a taste of my mom's eggs. I liked the taste. The eggs were prepared with cheese and green bell peppers.",IpR1FnfHF7M5SwuzMT7Aww,0,0,4,6QZzdx2pMdzwBhOoE_VHNw

You can have a completely diff experience tho, if you don't order the right things. Like ordering the veggie platter at a steakhouse... It's never gonna be that good 

If you come here get the Huevos rancheros (farmer eggs) meal it's amazingly delicious. Fresh protein and it's 5.99!!!! Best deal ever and best breakfast ever. It does take a while to get prepared tho but it's worth it. Other than that my gf got the chicken enchiladas and  she ordered that every single time we went so I think it's safe to say she liked it (even when I offered to take her to fancier places she ended up picking this place!!) 

Get the horchata and be greedy at the salsa bar!! Load up on the pico de gallo!!! And the salsa it's gonna make your plate more healthy and filling without increasing the cost and it taste way better. Skip the coffee tho",fzAuSEDhTLz4z-lCxC0paQ,0,0,4,Wnvptm0zhIJDFH-7o9wUsw

Kinda lower end feeling place but fantastic food. I got a quesadilla and shredded beef and it was very flavorful. The wife got a fajita salad which she said was good. We also got some nachos with shredded cheese on top and a couple drinks.. Paying $26 for a meal in Vegas which isn't bad. If you want a little cheaper McDonald's is right there but I can't suggest that.,kmDxJFnA3JoI0QX7JSOsZA,0,1,4,o3zFlJfwB8wo00Nnvqpz-A

I love the salsa table, pick what you want for mild to oh ya that's hot!!!  Down fall, person at the counter seems like she was put out taking our order, Then the person that calls out your number called the wrong number and then all of her tacos were put on one plate instead of two separate orders. If the leak issue wasn't really that big of a deal until the young man went back to get a second plate and cook argued with him. I was standing right there at the salsa counter listening.

I ordered the carne asada nachos.  When they came out they LOOKED good...but the steak wasn't hot or even warm.  The steak was very chewy.  There was barely any cheese on the nachos.  I was expecting awesome liquidy queso cheese...instead...a few strings of shredded cheese here and there.  

El Nopal was not worth the money spent.",dRabkHVTSdpYp6D5mD4uSA,0,0,2,p9Rme20hdktxyT2TL1E_DQ

The family and I planned on having dinner at the diner inside Stratosphere but found out they were temporarily closed. We didn't want to drive out so we walked around trying to figure out what we wanted that would also fit our budget. 

Came across this restaurant in the retail shopping area of the hotel. It looked like a slow night as they only had 2 tables occupied with 2 diners each and judging from their facial expressions they weren't having any fun. My brother said that they had the supreme nachos here before and it was good so we decided to dine in. Mom wanted the Nachos supreme with carne asada. My big boy ordered the carne asada quesadilla and my bro planned to split the carne asada wet burrito with his wife. I ordered the carne asada taco salad. They were all very good. The carne asada had a really good flavor to it and it was grilled just right. Although the wet burrito was a little disappointing due to more lettuce inside than carne asada I'm not going to dock a star for that. We'll just order all meat burrito next time. You get free refills on fountain drinks, too. For our sweet tooth we ordered the caramel and cream-filled churros. Both were good but I loved the caramel the best. We also got a slice of tiramisu cake, it was ok. 

All in all we were quite impressed and happy with our dinner selection. I'm definitely coming back for more next time.",ctWAuzS04Xu0lke2Rop4lQ,25,25,5,91C_oSmxsDKp_ZJpEodxyQ
