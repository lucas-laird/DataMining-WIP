1993544,2015-11-21,10,2BHReLgbinzeO7rYuxWZ8Q,"Tried this spot at a recent car meet that was on my side of town- the truck can frequently be found outside of a popular strip club, but I couldn't justify the trip across town just for a dog. 

Truck staff were cool and friendly- didn't mind boxing up my order to go, were helpful with menu suggestions. Save for the lobster-on-a-stick thing, prices are average: $6-9 for a dog with tons of toppings.

NACHO DOG: I've been drooling over this since I saw it on Instagram but found it a little disappointing. The frank seemed light it might have been sitting out for a bit, and there was a ton of guac. Usually this is a good thing (and a good value!) but the guac itself didn't have much flavor and overpowered the other toppings. I was going for a bit more crunch and cheese than I actually got in this version. I liked it, I just didn't love it. 
STREET TACOS: I have no idea what possessed my BF to order tacos at a hotdog truck, but these looked better than they tasted. Meat was dry and tortillas were a little odd (quite thick), flavors were okay. I wouldn't get this again, but I guess it's good to offer something aside from the obvious for hotdog haters?
SEASONED FRIES: Another BF pick. Fresh, could have used more seasoning because it was tasty, but at the end of the day, they're fries.

Overall, solid experience. The truck music and outgoing guy taking orders made the experience a bit better than your average transaction. But the owner/managers(?) unprofessional responses to other honest and valid reviews are what made me round my rating down rather than up.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,16,12,3,NG49q6QN6GzdWCqFgUubPw

------------------------------------

I guess I was bound to run into a big disappointment after trying so many food trucks.

Dude Where's My Hotdog is yet another Las Vegas food truck pumping out wieners. Unless those other trucks, they actually did show up to the Great American Foodie Fest. Another difference: they're not as good.

I visited this truck at the end of a long day, and I let my friend scope out a food truck because I had already tried all of the savory food trucks that I'd really wanted to. I tried a new hot dog called The Laz (butter sauce, sliced ham, mayo, Swiss, pickles, mustard), and the Lobster Corndog.

The Laz, which they described as a take on a Cuban sandwich, just wasn't that good. All of the components tasted boring and plain, and I didn't find much of a butter sauce if any. The bun was especially underwhelming. It brought no texture or flavor to the table.

The Lobster Corndog had good texture and temperature in both the meat and the corn shell, but the flavors were simply bland compared to something like a lobster roll. The sriracha mayo wasn't coming through at all. It needed more oomph.

They have style and charm, but their food is not impressive in comparison to their competition. I don't understand at all how they were voted as Best of Las Vegas in 2015 when there are so many other superior hot dog places, let alone hot dog trucks.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,6,4,2,VjFMyx7fjGeUl3ONLDGfjA

I had the lobster dog which was pretty big for the price. Came with spicy mayo and a lime. Yum! Me and my girl demolished it.

4554921,2018-04-30,0,2BHReLgbinzeO7rYuxWZ8Q,"I stopped by this truck during Foodie Fest over the weekend. What personally caught my eye was that fact that they had vegan dogs available for any of their menu options so that vegetarians could try the dogs too. 

I decided to try the nacho dog with the vegan dog. I was hoping they would use something similar to the Light Life brand which tastes more like a traditional hot dog, but theirs was more like a sausage. I wasn't a huge fan of it and the toppings on the dog were just kind of meh to me as well. 

I'm not sure I'd try them again, but kudos to having options and having a friendly truck team.",OXSJCjKtvZPf-YPDCXcWZg,1,1,3,Qeyj6_HjV87Exov6d13zZQ

The lobster corndog was actually full of lobster meat--impressive and filling. The chicken street tacos were well-seasoned and the cabbage adds the perfect amount of crunch. Chicken street tacos in this situation are, as the kids would say, bae. Seasoned fries didn't disappoint but also weren't spectacular like, ""OMG, YES. THIS IS LIFE."" 

Service was friendly and also, homeboy looked reminiscent of a hipsterfied/Patagonia vest-wearing Team Iceland from Mighty Ducks 2 coach. This should be reason enough to check this food truck out.",kOlK8YZY25h38ikR-s1Bjg,2,1,5,L9pLFgztgTIdzgi-zMTftA

This Vegas food truck takes the American favorite to the extreme and it's one my favorite go to food trucks. On weekends late night they are parked in downtown LV at Atomic Liquor. 

These guys make crazy looking hot dogs, from the Lobster Corndog, Taco Dog wrapped bacon and the famous General Lee which consists pineapple, teriyaki, and bacon. I'm sorry to use the old cliche' everything looks good, but it really does.

I ordered the Nacho dog - tortilla chips, salsa, guacamole, cheese and crema. 
Super tasty with great crunch similar to nachos supreme but only 1000x better.
The Rebel is chili, cheese, bacon and crispy onions. It was delicious and had great smokiness flavor. The links were cooked evenly with the right spice balance, and juicy.

As you would come to expect the staff is zany, funny, and down to earth friendly people. They seem to have to that work hard, play hard mentality that's contagious. That's really all I want to do is eat and have fun too.",bLExVDNKxXMjjZcx3YG36Q,5,5,5,RK1xlggEexCIbatl2LqMeA
5302077,2015-07-03,1,2BHReLgbinzeO7rYuxWZ8Q,"The best Hot Dogs I've had in my entire life!!!! Since leaving LV it's hard for me to even eat any hot dogs now. The ingredients are unique and very gourmet, not your ordinary hot dog stand. Tied with Fuku Burger as my favorite food truck in Vegas! Ash Hoff (owner/head chef) offers many delectable culinary creations. I've had just about everything on the menu and it's all so scrumptious (never been disappointed once). Hot Dog wise, ""The General Lee"" is by far my favorite. The Rebel Dog is a Chilli Dog with a twist (crispy haystack like onions). My new current favorite is the nacho dog. Aside from hot dogs they offer the innovative lobster corn dog (a fresh lobster tail battered and fried, drizzled with chili aioli a lime and micro greens), it's worth the price!!! Street tacos, their own line of sauces (great for your own personal cooking) and fries. Ash is always experimenting and trying new recipes so there's usually always a special menu item. Can't wait til they get their own fixed restaurant. He deserves it and Vegas (or somewhere in the States needs it). If you ever catch them out somewhere (even if you're not hungry) stop by and just say hi. Aside from eating there it's always fun just chilling at the truck with the crew.",hhPyIM-HBKIOmgdSdJzTfg,1,0,5,lj791f09ZUfye0d0LVsN_g
