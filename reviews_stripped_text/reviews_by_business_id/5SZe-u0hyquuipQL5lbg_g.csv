A lot of small plates and cheap prices so you can experience a little bit of everything!


They also had specials on sake and a good selection of Asian beers and sakes!

The ika yaki was nicely done and served with a citrusy spicy mayo sauce for dipping. Menu also has classic vegetable and meat skewers, but don't think you're going to get a discount Raku experience. Food is decent but not great. 
The sushi appears to be a new addition to the menu. Rolls are fairly typical, but I was disappointed that mine were falling apart. The Tropicana (coconut shrimp, cream cheese, salmon?) was a unique offering but was not to my liking (too sweet, too much cheese). 

Service during visit was polite and attentive. They have a TV over the bar showing KPOP music videos, which I always enjoy. Location is a bit hard to find. It's behind the gas station at the Tropicana/Pecos intersection, close to the Dunkin Donuts. Drove by several times without noticing it!",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,2,3,3,J1OfPgfXweXuDaYl7hpB9Q

We've been here twice now. The first time we ordered quite a bit - trying to sample as much as we could. I also ordered the mackerel plate, which was very good, a large cut and  not boney at all like the smaller cuts. 

Service is good and the chef takes his time to come visit with the patrons. They also remembered us the second time through. 

The second time, everything was still as good. I didn't eat much as I had recently had a tonsillectomy. Husband said the food was all still great and we'll definitely keep this place in mind for meals from now on. 

They also have a TV hanging on one wall playing K-pop music videos. 

We like that you order the same as some of the sushi places, where you just put the quantity you want for each item - be careful, though, as it can all add up quickly!

Ribeye and beef tongue tender and tasty. Chicken breast with wasabi not well received, bland chicken meat and unusual tasting wasabi topping. Bacon wrap asparagus and scallop are good. Soft shell crab is large and fried well. Squid rings are fried well and the sauce had a good kick. Only things not like are the salmon and yellowtail carpaccio.

We got the grilled yellowtail collar and it was undercooked and pink in the center. I told the server I wanted to cancel the order. She says hold on, goes to kitchen and asks, comes out to tell me ok and took the fish back. When the check comes out it still had the order on the check. We didn't say anything, left a generous tip and left. As for the other food it was mediocre at best for the price.

Their sushi rolls were actually the highlight and the price is unbeatable. We tried the sweet heart roll and the big eye roll. We also had the bacon wrapped scallops, cheese corn, Korean spicy ramen, tuna jalapeño poppers, and tempura green beans. The only thing I wouldn't recommend is the ramen. It's actually even advertised in a picture as a ramen packet and the noodles are obviously from a ramen packet. The jalapeño poppers could have used some cream cheese just because I think everyone is expecting it but very spicy and good. Everything we had plus sake was only $40 and we were stuffed (two people). Definitely beats all you can eat sushi. So glad there's an izakaya nearby and I hope it stays! Seems like they do a lot of takeout but it's definitely worth it to come in and experience it.

4078444,2014-12-08,1,5SZe-u0hyquuipQL5lbg_g,"Living in the Whitney Ranch area of Henderson, it's a pain getting into ""Chinatown"" for some more authentic Asian food. Fukumimi in SE Las Vegas is a godsend when the ramen bug bites (and it does quite frequently in our house), but any other Japanese cuisine, other than sushi, had us circling half of the valley on the 215 or 95 to get there, and with the a 2 year old, it's like driving with a time bomb. So when we noticed Yatai on our drive home from Fukumim a few weeks ago we got our hopes up.

I'm glad to say our expectations were exceeded.

Interior: larger than you expect when you walk up, very low key interior design but modern. Very clean.

Menu & Pricing: Large selection and the pricing is very good. We didn't see any specials, but the menu was large enough for us not to notice until we were talking the next day. Pricing was very good, most skewers ranged from $1.25 to $2.00, and other al-a-carte items were on par with other restaurants (i.e. karaage was $4.95). We ordered a grilled squid ($6.95 I believe) at the end of the meal that was big enough to be a meal for one person if you threw in a side of rice.

Food: Delicious. There were no 'rave' level items we ordered, but everything we did order will be ordered again. I did find the karaage on the bland side, but my wife, who's born and raised in Japan, told me that it's exactly the same way she would get at  izakaya in Tokyo and the other places in America serve it more the way mom's cook it at home.

Location: Make sure your car is locked.

The location is a bit unusual simply because the east side is not really known for this type of food.  However, I can see that this location may appeal to the east side or even the Henderson residents.  This is definitely a positive for me!

Tucked in the back of the shopping mall, you can easily miss it if you don't slow down.  Upon arrival on a Saturday around 7:30 p.m., we were the only one there.  Not a problem to us - this means better service! 

After being seated right away, our drink order was taken.  As a November special, $1 for a small hot sake or $2.50 for a large hot sake. What a deal!!!  The large hot sake was delicious.  We also ordered a pint size of the Sapporo on draft and some hot green tea.  (The green tea was from a tea bag and didn't taste like green tea at all.  Order the matcha if that may be an issue for you.)

Our server explained the menu and the ordering sheet and left us to decide while she gets the drinks.  We had the chicken hearts, chicken gizzards, chicken thigh meat, beef tongue, calamari rings, grilled squid, mixed vegetable tempura, and wasabi tako.  I think that was it.  There was absolutely nothing to complain about any of the food we ordered.  The grilled items were delicious; it was not too ""char-y"" or burnt like some places do it.  All the deep fried items were perfect; the oil was very obviously fresh.  The batter on the fried foods was perfect; not too chunky not too light.  And the wasabi tako was fresh as it should be.  Lastly, the grilled squid was very tasty because you can really tell the squid flavor (in a good way) and not burnt.  Some places grilled the squid so much at such a high temperature that it becomes burnt and dry - not here at Yatai!

And again, the service was fantastic.  Albeit we were the only table there, the server and chefs seem very eager to perform their jobs.  The chef actually came out and asked how everything was; I thought that was a nice touch. 

We bought the $10 for $20 deal, so our bill came out to $53 plus the $10, so $63 before gratuity.  We had 3 hot sake and a couple beer and we reordered a couple of the grilled items, too.  So this is a very good price for this kind of service and quality of food.

We ordered a few yakitori parts such as hearts and livers, cow tongues. The menu was huge! So it might just take a little while to go through it all. The cucumber salad was nice and the Shioyaki salmon came out moist and delicious . All in all the food was good and the prices are very fare.",LJLoIfcfsaRnizaKCPBx6A,2,0,4,1W5lv--XZhZ77yiERbyyLw

Came in at 6pm was empty and wasn't sure if to go in or not. 
Decided to take the chance and I am so happy we did. 
The food is great, prices are even better and service with a smile. 
Can't ask for more :) 

Decided to take over the menu and try a lot of things. 
As you will be able to see in some of the pictures. 

I think this is a great place to come in have a few drinks with friends and quick bite to eat.

If you are looking for full course meal you can get it but finger food that is great and drinks that come quick. 

Come inside take the chance it is definitely worth it :)",_Ym_SaC-SI1AJr1uT8TOXw,3,1,4,fLFx1L0OAP0O-FNo1D3Xcw

I think the location may be a sticking point for Yatai but I would definitely encourage people to stop by and give them a try.

The steak skewers were yummy, the bacon wrapped scallops were very good, the chicken hearts were overcooked and chewy, the calamari was great, bacon wrapped mushrooms were good and the shrimp tempura was good as well.

The customer service was excellent. Our waitress was very polite, prompt and we were even brought a free mango drink to try, which was really yummy.",0KeT9NKimYkHN0wlrij-dg,1,0,4,iqaNdOuGuNuItyTFUe-zVQ
