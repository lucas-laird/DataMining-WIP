The word I would use first to describe this restaurant. Its food is so very close to the flavors found in Peru. This is not to say that Inka or Lima Limon are bad restuarants but the flavors I find are not as authentic as Las Americas. They have food for just about everyone there. Whenever I go the smell of the food brings me back to peru when I am on the beach with my late Grandfather.

Friendly

The word I would use to describe the staff. They are always so friendly and they are always around to ask you how everything is going. Other restaurants have that kind of service but I personally have found it hard to find service like that in that location.

The only con I would give it is its location. Because its location is on Sahara and Eastern it makes it hard for me to drive down there all the time because I live in the opposite direction from it.",7QRec81IeLgHcG6Tln0D8w,1,1,5,W1WtjYu6zhXRNaaSFa4mNw

1662815,2014-04-05,0,4VXIS8vpNzEysXZVN5xGDA,"So my husband is Peruvian. When his grandparents are out of town and they obviously can't cook for us, we like to stop by Las Americas to get in our fix.

I've traveled to Peru twice and have been eating the food for years, so I'm familiar with how it should taste. Las Americas does a great job with their recipes. The food really tastes authentic and makes you forget that you're still in the States. My favorite dishes here are aji de gallina and pollo a la brasa. I also drink about half my weight in chicha, which is a drink made of purple corn. It tastes like this weird iced tea, but it's sweet and delicious. My family has never complained about the food and this is a regular spot for all of us.

The ambiance of the restaurant is casual, yet a bit relaxing. The windows are blacked out, so the temperature always stays cool and the sun won't ever glare in your eyes. The restaurant also has large pictures of various regions of Peru, which is a beautiful sight and perfect for photo op's with your family. 

Las Americas sometimes has live music on the weekends and they also serve picarones on Saturdays. They sell some Peruvian goodies like alfajores (my fave!), turron, Inka Kola, and they even sell custom cakes. The servers are always friendly.

I think this and pho are the only things I won't even bother trying to make coz it's just not with the effort (time and money wise). The only thing I didn't like was the tub-o-fries that came with it. They were just the same old boring frozen shoestring variety, and having a ton of them didn't make them taste any better or make me feel like I got a great value. There was a shady street kid who walked in and took over one of the tables. He laid out a bunch of merchandise to sell to whoever was interested. Nikes, shampoo, lotion, and other beauty products.

I never tried Lomo saltado before but it was so delicious. The beef was lean and tender, the onion slices were crisp and the fries were so flavorful. The green spicy sauce she gave me was very good, too. I'm not sure what was in it, but it wasn't just green chili pepper sauce. It was spicy but mild. Maybe avocado was in it??

I have never had Peruvian food and didn't know what I was looking at on the menu.  However they do have a description written in english so you can decipher it without a problem but then how do you know what is good?  Well, we each made two or three choices then ask the waitress and she had a definite favorite of them and went with what she said.

The nice thing about being a Yelper is having your friends hand you food off their plates to try.  The bad thing is I need to start working off some of this food!  So here is what we went with.  Tamal with sliced marinated onions and lime juice, the Masa was nice.  The boyfriend had Parihuela Peruvian Bouillabaisse a Seafood soup with fish, clams, shrimp,mussels and squid in a delicious beer broth.  He was happy and full.  Our friend had Saltado de Pollo Chicken sautéed with tomatoes and onions and french fries.  It had a rich hardy flavor extremely filling.  Sadly mine is not on the to go menu so I can only describe it without a name.  I had a Spaghetti made with a Basil and Cilantro sauce with a lean beef and fried plantains.  I really enjoyed it, similar to a pesto sauce only in Peruvian.

The experience all in all was good the food was good.  It is not a gourmet restaurant nor did I expect one, the food is huge in portions and the flavor is good.  The prices are a bit high but for the amount of food you get I guess it is fine.  The service was good I think she was not used to seeing many White and Asian people come in to try the food maybe a bit intimidated at first.

4558263,2011-07-14,3,4VXIS8vpNzEysXZVN5xGDA,"As one of a handful of Peruvian(-ish) restaurants in Las Vegas, this place was a semi-favorite of mine when I worked in the area. Now that I work and live further away, I come out here sparingly.

You see, I'm Peruvian. I mean, I was born there, but  was raised here. So my concept of Peruvian food has always been stuff that my mom cooked growing up. But one of the things my parents never cooked and we only had in restaurants was ""pollo a la brasa"" (rotisserie chicken) made the Peruvian way. So whenever my parents had a craving for this, they loaded us kiddos in the car and off we went to get pollo. I haven't been a kid for quite some time, but you'd be a fool if you thought I didn't get in my parents' car when I found out they were on their way to the Peruvian restaurant. They go for the chicken, which they think is the bees knees, I go for the Peruvian ceviche. You should also know that Peruvian ceviche is different than the Mexican variety. And I might be biased but I'm pretty sure the Peruvian version is better. 

Anyway. The food here is ok. It's not at all something to scream about, though it is better than other Peruvian restaurants I've been to. The portions always seemed smallish to me, too. The service is ok, though I swear the guy who works there is ALWAYS there. I've gone on in different days/times and he's ALWAYS there!

The prices are fair for Peruvian cuisine, specially if you're just in to get chicken and fries and salad. If you upgrade to ceviche or lomo saltado (which is almost Peru's national dish) you'll be more in the Tony Roma's price range than the Applebee's range.

4939638,2012-03-27,0,4VXIS8vpNzEysXZVN5xGDA,"so I went to this place with a Peruvian friend of mine.  

As a Summerlin resident, going to E. Sahara and Eastern is quite a trek, not to mention having to drive through sketchy part of town.  

I am no expert of Peruvian food, but I must say that I DID like the food.  I had typical Peruvian cusine such as Ceviche Mixto, papa a la huancaina, choros a la chaleca, arroz chaufa, and aji de gallena.  

I guess Peruvian food is sort of like Hawaiian food.  Melting pot of many cultures from the Spaniards, the indiginous people, and Asian immigrants. 

It's quite out my way, so I can't imagine myself going there frequently, and I cannot vouch for the authenticity of the food as I have only had Pervucian food a couple of times, but I did like it.  It's certainly something slightly different from what I'm used to, and I'd have no hesitation returning should I happen to be in that par to town.",I510KttlB4dxqER7AueQnA,1,1,4,hC7zGC79BLP3dIw7PzdfEA

- The ceviche de pescado was perfect.  Tangy, spicy, smooth.  Just really nice
- The whole chicken had so much flavor.  I'm not sure how you get that much flavor into the chicken (not just the skin), but they did and I loved it
- The fried rice with everything (i.e., beef, chicken, seafood) was pretty good.  Lots of flavor and the seafood tasted very fresh
- The fried steak had so much flavor for such a thin little steak and the juices that covered the fries made them irresistible

- Very friendly service",Z1Ce1N6F7vw9pKnsv8MtRA,1,0,5,yAOsVIWGtbawYWK4wtchSQ

Once I ordered, bread was provided and I had to wait 5 more minutes for butter to arrive. Chicharron was really fatty but did had good flavor, tamales were good.

I wish we had something this good in the SF Bay Area.  The service and prices were more than reasonable and the Lomo Saltado, Anticuchos, Papa a la Huancaina, and Inca Cola were great.  Two thumbs up!  We will definitely be back for more!",_F2l0TYflE-DWz0qJYo00w,0,0,5,7b6TqNYBi415-RlbErCb2A
5469684,2012-08-25,0,4VXIS8vpNzEysXZVN5xGDA,"I was here during June 2012. I came to Vegas and was really craving Peruvian Cebiche. Not being frrom Vegas I called to make sure that they would be open and for the location. Since they were really close to closing I decided to call for 2 Cebiche Mixtos'. The only thing I was disappointed as far as Cebiche was that they did not offer spice. I am not an expert in Peruvian food but I do know my Peruvian food. 

Well, the waitress was really nice and allowed my group of 4 people to dine-in while she finish cleaning up, which I really appreciated! =]

What I order:

-Cebiche Misto: Really good (8/10)
-Jalea: Eh (5/10- I do hate Jalea, I order it in accident, was drunk)
- Chicha Morada: GREAT! It was really, really good, and the price for the pitcher was unbelievable (10/10)",XfqdFKArSR8dgC2RGa7FoA,0,0,4,X27Vw3yi9xzEsADU7UvJRg

The whole baked chicken is also great. Don't miss out on the lovely Peruvian wines they have behind the counter!,soG9o5PqmXilKJHpAB777A,0,0,4,n1V5CSab_YVUUjoOeG2zJw
5745827,2012-10-29,2,4VXIS8vpNzEysXZVN5xGDA,"I love my country and its food. Peruvian food is hands down my favorite and Im very happy to see that its getting more and more popular throughout the world. And now, in Las Vegas.

There are a couple of options in town and Las Americas is one of the top ones that have its pros and cons.

Pros are simple: The food. It tastes awesome and portions are good. Im getting punched by Incas right and left when I take a bite of anything that I order. And I ordered everything  already..dont judge me. They have this hang over secret called ""Leche de tigre"" (means tiger milk but its not real tiger milk) it is very sour but its liquid cocaine for me. 

The aji de gallina and carapulcra taste like heaven. See, Las Americas has some plates that other Peruvian restaurants don't dare to have .Very authentic dishes like Patita con Mani or chicharron breakfast. Every dish taste good and the presentation is good as well.

Price is also in the Pros department. Comparing between the other spots in town, this place is really affordable. With a very big menu you can chose to be budget conscious or just go all out on a gallore of Peruvian food indulgence.

Cons are a couple : Location. It is not located in the best side of town. Ive seen (and filmed) a couple of homeless people fights at the parking lot , had some people selling random things walking into the restaurant (and they let them) or just some ghetto /dangerous situations. If you took the bus , good for you, but I drive there and
it is a little scary to leave your car outside. At least you can see your car through the windows.

Another thing I don't like is the decoration. It looks cheesy/ghetto.It makes me sad sometimes because it scares people out. Just doesn't look good. For example I was eating my delicious carapulcra on a MonteCarlo casino plate and im sure they are not part of the chain.I cant bring a group here because it just doesn't look good and even though the food is good , presence and location will murder the experience for a Peruvian food noob.

The chef is awesome. He cooks and checks on you while you are dining. For a small stablishment I think that was a pretty cool touch. The servers are nice. Always smiling and greeting; However they tend to forget things . Today they forgot two things on my order and refills were taking a while. I give them a B for effort and warmth but they
could do better

All we saw was fast food and accidentally found Las Americas. At first we thought it was Mexican food. When we asked for tacos the woman smiled politely and said, no this is Peruvian food. Awesome!  So she recommended some things and it was EXCELLENT.  I am so glad we stopped there.  It was like almost as good as a mini vacation.  Decor was cute. Food was authentic and so delicious. The waitress was very very nice and even brought us sample drinks. Yum! I highly recommend a visit over there even if you don't live near.  Totally worth the trip!!",lezrRiKYN5UiCKeHFOY4oA,0,0,5,JOPMerKIburfJjvaIpr00w
