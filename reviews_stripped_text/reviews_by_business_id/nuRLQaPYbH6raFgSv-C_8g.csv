22742,2013-11-13,0,nuRLQaPYbH6raFgSv-C_8g,"Like most people you go to sushi places I love sushi, and Sin City is some of the best in town. Their all you can eat is fair priced at $25.95 for dinner ($22.95 for lunch) and if that's not for you their rolls are all priced between $8-11.

I had three rolls in my visit the Spider roll, the Jackie, and the Durango. The spider and Jackie where absolutely delicious and some of the best sushi I have had in Vegas. The Durango, which is a deep fried roll, was just ok. They put cream cheese in it which I normally like but the taste was too overpowering and was all I could taste, even with my soy sauce and wasabi. For desert I had the fried banana which normally comes topped with chocolate syrup and vanilla ice cream, but they had neither so I substituted the strawberry ice cream and it was still very delicious.

The service here was also wonderful. It was pretty empty when I first entered and there was a lady dotted at the back near the cash register. At first I was a little skeptical since instead of seating me she talked across the restaurant to me and said I could sit anywhere. After this though they where very attentive and took my order vet promptly and I even got a few suggestions from the chefs even though I was sitting at a booth and not the bar. So all in all I would easily recommend Sin City Sushi to anyone who loves sushi.",Eve-8Glwh0jCMVo_6xbYdg,0,0,4,ZjdB1XFbuKNx5sCevAn6pQ

Hopefully they keep it up, because I was here last Spring and I couldn't give them the same review. The spicy tuna roll has an extra kick of spice and they put kaiware daikon in it, so it has a fresh, peppery, smooth creamy feel. The nigiri was all fresh and sweet, the hamachi was from the belly.

I now know what Simba felt like eating grub in the lion kind when I bit into the rubbery mess that is the udon noodles. The rolls, I'm not sure where to start. I know realize why it's called sin city sushi because it's a sin to consume this vile 3 day old supermarket sushi. As I sat here I saw the looks of unsuspecting victims that couldn't fathom the level of disappointment that was about to ensue. The only reason this place gets 1 star aside from the fact that I can't rate it 0 stars is that the Japanese lasagna was the only thing that didn't make me wanna go to the bathroom and throw up.",zcxzTxxwOrsyYgmB5C1tdg,0,0,1,5MeJ0LwhQGzxc6zF9yFKJQ

523625,2013-08-13,0,nuRLQaPYbH6raFgSv-C_8g,"For the people that said service was Excellent, I question your opinion in Excellence.
   The food here is Pretty good if you're really into sushi. The Vampire roll is my fave and has garlic ponzu sauce on top, they have Great Udon and Miso. LOVE their Poke and seaweed salad and they have a few other good ones too AND out of the 6 times I've gone, I never had to wait for a table. 
   BIG But however, Absolutely Trust in these words and the others that say the service is not good and the woman that are waiting on you are mostly standing in the back doing nothing. I have not sat at the bar yet.  
   
   If you have somewhere to be, do not come here. It's the slowest sushi restaurant I've been to in LV and I've been to at least 10 in this city. Look forward to them bringing someone else's order to your table, not checking up on you for water until after it's gone (not every time but enough times to be parched), they take your AYCE card away and don't return it so you can order more; you have to ask for it back. And thats about it. They're pleasant though, not mean at all, they just don't have things very organized and don't tend to you as they should.  

  Great food, bad service. I have not been there once out of 6 times and the service changed. Literally. I don't just bash restaurants and I hope you see I'm not doing that. I'm not hard to please and LOVE sushi. I wish SO much the service was better b.c the food really is good, it's just not here. Thats the only reason for the 3 stars, the food. So, go for the food and if you're hungry, expect to be there for a bit.",uzN7j_1lhtUuoRgc8fJ1UQ,0,0,3,eMLG8URDzXiBHgvcbD3e0g
576511,2013-01-26,0,nuRLQaPYbH6raFgSv-C_8g,"Ok so this isnt really a typical review. I know i know, what am i doing this review for?

WELL, im happy u asked! :)

 I reviewed the menu. As i usually do before i go to a restaurant. and this menu was uhhh, hmmm. eh :/ who made this menu?!?!?, LMAO. jk (am i?)

ANYWAYS, after trying to read this menu. im curious if this highly rated sushi spot has a few things:

 ICEE (i see) Uni, is there a limit and is it fresh or that usual ayce pre boxed stuff. IDK, but id like to know :) ICEE (i see) Salmon, do u also serve salmon belly? like goyemon does. MMmm... oh oh and ICEE (i see) Tuna, but i dont like tuna, but i LOVE white tuna (like oyshi) and fatty tuna (like yonaka). Would you happen to have white tuna at least?

IDK, maybe im blind and i dont see these fishes in the nigiri part of the menu. maybe i have to call and ask, but then what is the online menu for. maybe they focus more on the rolls and appetizers (meats) than the nigiri, but its a suhi place isnt it?  sice when is deep frying, adding mayo, cheese and extra sauces the right thing to do to fish :(
no offense to all of us over eaters, because we need the extra sauces :) (do we?)

but i shall not leave without saying something nice. from the pictures. awesome food presentation. just not a fan of all the extra fatty ingredients. 

AND sorry for eating ""my friends"" brownie on accident and thinking it would be fun to write a review about a places menu and pictures. but hey, its still my first impression, and its my personal opinion. and you may be able to pay (a lot of $) for my silence, BUTT!!! u will never take away my thoughts..

Bottom line is that the food and service were exceptional. Only held off on giving 5 stars because the ambience, although clean and modern, was nothing to write home about. Besides that, this place rocks. I've never had fish so tender in particular. This from a certified sushi hound. Jessica, our server that night was super friendly and attentive. Their all you can eat is also a good deal if you're ready to fill up on sushi (which is pretty much always for me)./",sL65zbKhD4uwqfzfzpM8gQ,1,1,4,Uk3Zqsi5_jEhj0w5kUPCJQ
596479,2011-03-14,2,nuRLQaPYbH6raFgSv-C_8g,"I was in the mood for some sushi. I was visiting LV from San Francisco. I had Yelped this place and found the reviews to be overwhelmingly good. Hence, I wanted to try it even though it was off the strip. I was meeting a friend there who informed she was going to be late. I sat at the sushi bar and was greeted by Jesse (sushi chef) who offered awesome customer service as well as great recommendations, i.e., vampire roll. He handed me some sushi rolls while I waited. I ate them fast to Jesse's shocking face. I wanted to hid the evidence that I had already started to eat, lol. What makes this place great is 1. You are eating all you can, seriously. Don't let your eyes be bigger than your stomach because you don't want to waste this precious food. For 22.95 you get all your faves. I wanted Uni for lunch and its only offered on the Dinner AYCE (all you can eat) menu. All they did was charge me for the Dinner Menu 24.95, lol, awesome. You cannot beat this place. The fish is fresh. Yes, FRESH. A lot of people will say some sushi place is fresh when it's really not.  Jesse was awesome, the waitstaff was friendly. A must for any sushi lover. Jesse if you are reading this man, mahalo. Jesse complemented my sushi eating skills, lol. I dipped my fish into the soy and wasabi and put back on my rice and then ate it. I guess that is a proper way of eating sushi. If you love sushi go to this place. If you are coming from the strip and following all the directions remember its on the right side. You can make a right at the lights on Serene. I got lost so I know this is important.  If a place like this was in San Francisco a lot of AYCE places would shut down. Todai and all these other previously frozen places are just not worth it. Sin City Sushi come to San Francisco. There are great sushi places here, but not all you can eat freshi sushi at 22.95-24.95.",MUClC5kb1iw0FY16maGlqQ,2,2,5,4TvzcEIaVFPqj_jEN77ZmQ

Needless to say, we couldn't wait to eat here.  We, of course had ayce and no kidding, everything we ordered was delicious!!! Our favorite rolls:  Stacie, Vampire, Wet Dream, Japanese Lasagna, Orleans & Lew. Must haves:  No Name Hand-roll,  OMG soo good!! Loved, loved, loved the baked green mussels and tako, downed several orders of the oyster shooters and also the Ikura (salmon eggs) is worth mentioning.  We also ordered our usual, California roll, shrimp tempura edamame etc. Waitress was wonderful and the timing of the foods being brought to our table was perfect.  Most  places (that we've been to and we've been to alot of AYCE) bring your rolls out all the same time but here, they brought out 2-3 types of rolls out at a time which I thought was good. It gave our party a chance to really savor the rolls in front of us and just when we thought we just ate the best rolls yet, our waitress would deliver the rest of our sushi.  Yummy!!  Our waitresses were very attentive to our needs and made sure to come & take more orders of sushi from us when needed.  The restaurant is small but I like that it gives you more of a warm, inviting sort of homey feeling.  You have to try this place.  The restaurant is clean, the fish is fresh tasting, so good it melts in your mouth, best sushi chefs and wait staff.  You can't go wrong coming here.  The only thing I wish I knew before coming here though is that they do charge you for your little kids.  It's half price so was $13 per child for dinner.  We had a 3yr old and an 18 mos.  They don't eat much and ate off our plates so I was a little bummed about that but the food was great and that made up for it.  So be ready to fork out some cash if you decide to take your kids along.  If not, go to Island Sushi down the street where we've gone to many times and they never charged us for kids and the food there is good too but in my opinion their sushi is not as tasty as Sin City Sushi.",hFWi7hG6fU8Q90eezXCeeA,1,0,5,JiGPz9LYwbH6bEIj4MK6Dg
702178,2011-05-12,0,nuRLQaPYbH6raFgSv-C_8g,"This is my favorite sushi spot in Las Vegas.  I love the atmosphere, location, wait staff, food, menu... everything.  Before I came here, I thought the same thing as everyone else:  ""An AYCE place in a strip mall in Henderson called Sin City Sushi?  No way.""  Let me tell you right now that you're wrong.  The name and location are misleading.  This place has amazing quality fish.

The AYCE is something like $27 per person and that includes appetizers, nigiri, rolls, hand rolls, a bunch of other stuff and a dessert.  Obviously you can't get sashimi and you do have to eat the rice.  But it is still an excellent value given the quality of the food.  Oh, and the AYCE is not a buffet -- you have to order each round.  They don't make you finish your previous round but there is an implied expectation that you'll eat all or almost all of the food that you order -- which I think is a perfectly fair expectation.

The last thing I want to mention about this place is the waitstaff.  They are unbelievably friendly and attentive without being overly in-your-face.  They really put this place over the top.",AtL0xTN2nfJW2Vmrqw5pfg,1,1,5,tusNQxehSSLad6tLgJPsuA

My chief complaint here is the sushi rice, which is closest to the dreaded Costco or supermarket style of sushi rice: bland and mushy. Sushi rice should be fresh and have a slight tang from a little sugar and rice wine vinegar. You should not be able to smear it on the roof of your mouth with your tongue. 

You could do a lot worse though. Service was fine, but strained due to severe language or accent barrier. Hey, we had a good time and we left full and happy, so there you go. Yeah, we'd go back.

Shrimp/Veggie Tempura - (the usual)
Edmame -  (the usual)
Dessert - green tea ice-cream /w mango/strawberry mochi. Yummy!!

The BAD:
-fish were sliced paper thin, and too much rice on the nigiri sushi.  Seriously this is just a waste since most people are not going to eat the extra rice anyways.  The thinness of the cut also impacts negatively on the overall taste/mouth feel of the nigri.

The UGLY:
-took foreeever to get our food.  Apparently they had too many customers that day and they were short staffed.  I hope this is a one time fluke as the server apologized repeatedly. 
-many items were out of stock.  Seriously we showed up around 6:30pm yet they were already out of the good stuff like uni, giant scallops, clams, torro.. WTF

NOTE:
-everyone gets only one order of sweet shrimp & uni
-each order of sushi comes in 2 pieces.  marking 6 orders = yup u guessed it, 12 pieces.",voeAG_bLCRYVCxNKStIYfQ,0,0,4,UTsEEFK28hAf90QRk6hakg

We had a lot of questions and our waiter was very patient and answered everything. We ordered a ton of food between the 4 of us and it didn't take long before they were bringing out appetizers, rolls, drinks left and right. It was great because we didn't have to keep calling him over. They kept clearing our plates and filling our drinks. Everything was delicious and priced fair.

They didn't even set up our plates, they just threw a stack on our table and we set it up. We had to walk to the front and grab menus for ourselves and when we were done we had to pass it to the tables around us because they didn't even get a menu yet. Our family ended up leaving an hour after we got seated because we were barely just getting our appetizers. They had one person bussing and serving the whole time. Everyone was getting their food before us after arriving after us. They even had the nerve to charge us for food that we didn't even get or order. I'm obviously not one to complain, but seriously..the worst service...and before I arrived here I expected 4 stars and didn't believe the picture of the poop still in the shrimp, but this place doesn't even deserve one star and there was poop in the shrimp!

It was a very family like atmosphere. All the sushi chefs were very nice, both the manager and the owner were there and they took great care of everyone. 

As I read in other reviews, people were complaining about the fish to rice ratio, to me it was perfect! I had a lot of fish for all of my sushi and just the perfect amount of rice. Everything tasted fresh too! I will be back, possibly on a weekly basis.

1298625,2014-04-06,0,nuRLQaPYbH6raFgSv-C_8g,"I've been eating sushi for 26 years and the last 18 of those here in Vegas. I've been to sushi bars, sushi restaurants, restaurants that 'serve sushi', and of course many 'all-you-can-eats'. That being said, the chefs are nice, the fish quality is average, and the service is so bad that I can't understand how they keep the doors open. 

You'll find a lot of reviews where customers get so excited about all-you-can-eat that they'll eat a sh*# sandwich and smile about it. I won't. As with most other AYCE joints, you're servings will contain a lot of rice and little fish. This practice is normal as rice is cheap and they want to fill you up. If you love rice, this is your place. I don't want to eat two servings to get one serving of fish. You also won't find many of the more exotic items on their menu. Uni isn't exotic and it's also not on the lunch AYCE menu. Figures.

Service is horrible here. Many new sushi hobbyists won't mind the rude and callous behavior of a waitress if they think that reason is 'the way it is' or language barrier. In Sin City's case it's neither. I was told about the waitress and was warned of her behavior. My friends were right, and she lived up to her reputation. At one time our party of four sat with empty drinks (soda and water), and a stack of dirty plates so large we could barely eat around them. To top off our experience, she spilled a scalding bowl of soup on two of the guests in our party. The waitress had no response. No napkins, no rag, no clean up, no apologies, and still continued her callous, rude, and insensitive behavior. Can I at least get a refill?

Like Janice, Erin, and Nestor said, stick to your guns and go get better service and sushi elsewhere. The chefs are really nice and I feel bad for them. The food is average, but the chefs do what they can, with what they have. The service is what kills it for me and we won't ever return. See all the good reviews for this place? Those were written by noobs.

Located in the shopping center (Eastern/Serene)  the exterior is nothing fancy but upon entering the interior was simple, clean and with other Asian restaurants, specifically Japanese/Sushi, you are greeted right away. The staff were all great and made us feel very welcome. 

We ended up going after 12PM which turned out to be great timing. It wasn't that busy so we easily got seated up at the sushi bar. The main chef was very nice and quick with preparing various rolls. 
One of my favorite rolls that I find just about everywhere is the Dragon Roll. It was as delicious as ever. Upon recommendation from the chef I had their Stacie Roll and loved it. My friend had their Moon Roll and Vampire Roll so I sampled both and added to my list for next time. After doing some of the larger rolls I need to get my nigiri fix with some Salmon, Hamachi and upon the chef's recommendation tried their Albacore which was prepared spicy. Loved it all and although I was stuff I couldn't leave without some strawberry mochi. 

This will be one I definitely visit again, hopefully sooner than later. Next time I plan on doing All-You-Can-Eat dinner with some tasty beer to wash down some rolls.",aBk7XEmxhc1RE0Gcgeofvw,2,1,4,0hnEsMw4Yt1zQZZehtgeDw

1559843,2011-05-17,1,nuRLQaPYbH6raFgSv-C_8g,"After reading the reviews on yelp, my wife and I decided to try this place out.  By the way, we are avid sushi diners.  In a month, it would not surprise me if we go to 4-5 sushi dining experience.  Yes, they are AYCE too.  Fortunately, I run alot.  Otherwise, I would be a big hippo.

Anyways, here is the deal with this place.  The sushi selection was not that great.  My wife and I love sushi with cooked eel.  They had like 2-3 selections only.  This was a bit of a disappointment.  In addition, per the sushi chef, they only serve ""half"" orders when you ""make"" your final orders.  This kinda sucks.  By ordering ""half-orders"", we could experience a greater selection.

We ordered the catepillar rolls, dynamite, unagi, edaname, cucumber salad, miso soup, seaweed salad, and other rolls.

The seaweed salad and cucumber salad was served in a micro-size bowl.  It was like a ""doll"" size serving.  We had to make a couple orders.  Seaweed was a bit salty; however, cucumber salad was very good.

Sushi was average.  It was nothing that you could say WOW about.  you know???  Towards the end of our meal, our sushi chef made a recommendation to try the mussels and oysters.  Unfortunately, because we had the ""full"" order sushi, we were stuffed.  Granted, we still took his advice and tried the mussels.  Surprisingly, it turned out to be their best dish.  I wish they mentioned this to us before we started to order.  Wished I had room to try the oysters.  Maybe, next time.

Overall, with the exception of the mussels, the food was a ""2"".   Mussels was a 5.

Now, for service... The reason why this is a 3 or 3.5 is due to service.  The wait staff are very friendly, professional, and really took care of us.  They made the restaurant feel ""welcoming"".  It was a bit ""homey"".  Everything was clean and down to earth.  We kinda like that.

Funny thing, my wife and I agree that we would be back because of the service, not the food.  Total price came to about 70bucks with tip.

In our opinion, our two favorite sushi spots are still Sushi Mon (quick, good sushi, great selection) and Extreme-Sushi (slow service - depending on the chef - takes forever for sushi orders to be made, but has the best sushi in town -- also great selection).",qy47UXcmGYsPhDSc6iHWPA,3,1,3,gcsEiYiM0Hp7jhprosDc-w

I been eating his sushi for since I was 15 and I'm now 36... so 21 years now! I have had sushi all up and down the west coast in such places as: San Diego, LA, San Fran, Portland, Seattle, ect. and as well as many places in Scottsdale, Phoenix, and Vegas. Nobody does as good as JImbo! Though many of his old menu items are not offered at this place he has brought a few of the items craved by many with him. Even so the rest of the folks there and the menu is still to die for! The service is great and the sushi is the best in all of Vegas no matter who is making it here. It really doesn't mater if it's the the little guy in the Titleist golf cap, or the funny hyper Hawaiian, or the ""old man"" its all great! I have told many of my friends and coworkers that are traveling to Vegas to make sure to try Sin City and make sure to set aside the time to go there while in town. Not one has had any regrets! Many have made sure to tell me it was the best they have ever had. I now live about 2 hours away but try to make it at least 2 times a month to get my fix. Due to health reasons now  I'm on a strict diet and reward myself with a ""bad night"" on sushi 2-3 times a month. If it wasn't for Sin City Sushi I wouldn't have a cheat night at all! If I lived closer and wasn't ill I would be there twice a week just like the old days with Jimbo at Manda. 

If your traveling to Vegas make sure you eat here... It's only 10 mins from most of the strip and a cheap and easy cab ride over if you didn't drive. The place is simple to find and located just feet off of the freeway exit. If you have a guest in your party or a picky spouse this place is a great choice as well. They offer more than ""raw fish"". Decent menu of beef, chicken, cooked fish, noodles, and some of the best tempura I have ever had. They also have plenty of room for a larger party and also offer a big screen TV to watch the game on if that's what your into. They offer a small beer selection and a few premium hot & cold sakes as well. There are also plenty of other places to eat in same parking lot if you need to accommodate others in your party that don't want to try anything on the menu.... their loss!

I recommend you try:
Star Roll
Oyster Shooters
Special Scallops- if seated with Jimbo
Baby Tako
Paradise Roll- one of the best things you have ever tasted.
My Girlfriend Roll
Vegas Roll- cut or hand roll both as good as other.
Blackjack Roll- Salmon and cream cheese stuffed Jalapeno deep fried =YUM!
Vampire Roll
Halibut (Hirame) and the Red Snapper (shiromi) is the freshest I have ever had and they almost always have it!
Caterpillar Roll-If you like a Dragon Roll and are a avocado lover this roll is for you! Though very popular at most sushi joints theirs puts the rest to shame!.

If your ever headed there or wanting to try it and looking for some normal friendly down to earth company I'm almost always down. I'm always looking for a sushi partner... Just give me a day or so heads-up.",m-uvp7ZBeT7z94-GlYrlgg,0,0,5,-Pxjq9gq5ylABKq9snm_Kg

If I order a burger and dont want to eat the bun you cant tell me that I can't do that.  I finally the second time asked her to please stop yelling at us and to get away that if he does not want to eat the rice he does not have to..  If you need to charge us al la carte fine but leave us alone and stop being rude.  She then proceeded to yell in Japanese to the other waitress for 15 minutes.  we had to ask for our check and wait for another 10 minutes while she yelled in Japanese about us.  the sushi was just ok the sushi chefs very nice but the wait staff was absolutely rude and horrible and I will never recommend this to anyone.  She could have simply said if you do not eat the rice we will have to charge you al la carte pricing.

If you want waitresses who practically throw your food on the table and run off before asking how your meal is going, or waiting thirty minutes between rolls when getting the all you can eat (or really any type of meal), or never being able to catch the attention of the waitress who never comes back after dropping off your food to merely ask for a napkin, then this place is for you as well.

I will say that the only reason I keep going is for the sushi!!! I have found better service everywhere else but the sushi doesn't even compare to Sin City. I put up with the waitress (really one in particular (an older lady) who we manage to get every time we are there.) because the food is so good. The owner is very friendly and the chefs always greet you when you walk through the door or say goodbye when you leave.  

The Lion roll is my favorite and the soft shell crab practically melts in your mouth. So good! My 3 year old gets a free bowl of rice (which is usually all he will eat there) so that's nice. The all you can eat for $25.95 for dinner is worth it if you can get your food in a timely manor (which for this place is rare).

2338421,2013-04-18,0,nuRLQaPYbH6raFgSv-C_8g,"I would give this place zero stars if I could. I've never written a review on yelp before but this place was so terrible I felt I had to write one. I have absolutely no clue how this place has so many good reviews, as eating here was one of the worst dining experiences I have ever had in terms of both food quality and service.

My friend and I were seated right away but it took at least 15 minutes for someone to take our drink orders and bring us a menu. We ordered some nigiri, a couple sides, and two rolls - nothing overly complex and not a lot of food. It took about 45 minutes for them to bring us one order of nigiri and more than an hour and a half for us to get everything we'd ordered. 

The fish did not taste fresh at all. I hate wasting food but we couldn't even finish eating some of the items we ordered because they tasted so bad. My friend started complaining of an upset stomach before they'd even finished bringing the food and I was sick as well by the time I got home. 

We politely informed the server that we did not enjoy the sushi and that it did not taste fresh. She insisted that if we didn't like the food it was because we didn't know anything about sushi and didn't know how sushi is supposed to taste. I was struck speechless at this incredibly rude response. 

The server then went on to claim that they had never had a complaint about their food before, that their sushi is the best in town, and that everyone thinks so. I responded that their sushi definitely isn't the best in town and the server abruptly walked away. It then took them another 30 minutes to take payment on our check. This was, without a doubt, the worst customer service experience I have ever had in a restaurant. 

On top of all of that, the restaurant was very dirty; which, in hindsight, probably should have been our first clue as to the quality of this place. The menu they brought us was soggy and gross from (I guess) food and drink being spilled on it. There were also streaks of food/drink/who knows what on the wall next to our table. I was also given a dirty plate to eat off of. 

In sum, everything about this place was terrible. I will never eat here again and would not recommend eating here to anyone.",5W5UNe6M_cg7T6qDn5S0Dg,0,0,1,PIZWsn4qn2bTNPNWDfCTOg

Our party of 3 got the AYCE.  After being ignored after several hand waves to come over to our table (that got direct eye contact), I finally had to yell at her to get her to stop & take another order.  We never received several items we ordered & were there for over 2 hours due to the fact that it simply took that long for her to take our orders via checkoff sheet & finally give us our bill.  

Also, the AYCE is not truly AYCE.  Apparently during lunch time, the sweet shrimp is off the menu unless you are willing to pay dinner prices.  We were told this after we had ordered.  You are also limited to ordering other items...baby octopus & soft shell crab come to mind.

2566067,2013-03-14,0,nuRLQaPYbH6raFgSv-C_8g,"I was looking for a new sushi place in Henderson and Yelped in my area. Found Sin City Sushi, and when I walked in, I realized that it's owned by Young and Moon, the husband/wife couple who owned Sapporo Sushi off of Stephanie and Sunset years ago. Young's sushi is what made me fall in love with sushi 15 years ago, and he still does not disappoint.

I don't order off the AYCE menu, since I truly believe that if you are going to pay $20-$25 for AYCE, you get what you pay for, and if you're going to complain about an AYCE at a good sushi place (like Sin City), you are probably one of those people who  A) don't eat the rice the way you are supposed to and/or B) you are one of those freaks who end up eating 10 rolls by yourself in one hour (the AYCE rules are made for people like you)... OR C) you are a sushi snob who honestly thinks they are going to get a la carte sushi quality at an AYCE price. NOBODY does that. They'd lose their asses on profits. Business 101, people.

So, for those of you looking for good sushi at an AYCE price or REALLY good sushi off the a la carte menu, then Sin City is for you. 

Their baked mussels are delicious, and most sushi places should take a lesson from Sin City on the baked topping, mussel quality and SPLITTING the mussel so you can enjoy it in two bites.

Great handrolls. My old time favorite is the zesty salmon with mayonnaise, masago and lemon. Give it a whirl, but FYI, it's not on the AYCE menu... with good reason.

Baby tako is tasty and not rubbery the way many sushi joints give it to you. Another tasty bite is the oyster shot, which is tangy with a bit of spice. 

I'd comment on the cut rolls, but honestly, I ask for most rolls in a handroll. Their ingredients are fresh, their sushi chefs are friendly, and their atmosphere is just fine.

Read the AYCE reviews with a touch of caution. Sin City is a good sushi joint. Period. And those of you All You Can Eaters who are bitching about ""quality"" and ""staff rudeness,"" you get what you pay for, baby. Stop walking in like a fake baller and order AYCE and then complain.

I have yet to leave there getting glutened, but at the same time, I don't eat the wasabi, I bring my own soy sauce, and I don't get Uri or anything that is normally marinated in soy sauce/ponzu, and I don't eat anything that is deep fried either. The prices are also very reasonable for the quality, and they've never timed me for the AYCE which is nice. Nobody breathes down my neck to finish eating! Thank goodness!

The nice thing about their rolls is that they are small and tight. The rice doesn't break apart, it isn't overcooked, it is just right. I love that the rolls aren't all rice, especially if we have every decided to do AYCE. The sake bombs are only $2 all day long, so my husband is a happy man after a couple of those. A large sake is about $6, but it comes with your glass already full of sake and is very good. They do not have a happy hour, but a happy hour isn't needed when the prices are so reasonable and the food so delicious!

Really?? Since when?? Should have told me earlier or...better yet, DON'T EVEN BOTHER putting the item on AYCE menu anymore. They complained that people have been coming in and ordering a huge amount of oysters so they run out by the end of the night. So what's the problem? order more.

We arrived here around 7 for the dinner buffet which was only $22 dollars.  There was no wait time for a table and the service was fast and very friendly.  We had a pretty good size group and they were very accommodating.  I LOVE sushi and i am always very skeptical when I go to sushi places, ESPECIALLY for an all you can eat sushi.  I have a very weak stomach, so FRESH is definitely key.  Some buffets that you go to that serve sushi usually have their sushi sitting over ice and sitting there for who knows how long.  Here at Sin City, you order all that you want and they make them fresh as soon as you finish eating some of your other rolls.  Also, I'm not a big octopus fan, but they offered us some octopus dish that was cut up into pieces, it was very good.  They offer an array of custom roll's, but of all, I would have to say that the Tiger roll is my favorite!  The Ahi spicey tuna on top is literally so tender, it's almost like butter, it totally melts in  your mouth.  It doesn't even have that fishy taste and the spice on it, is JUST RIGHT.

3100634,2011-09-23,2,nuRLQaPYbH6raFgSv-C_8g,"I barely ate anything to really judge the food but it was okay. The service (that one specific server really) was disturbing. I was here with my friend and there was only one other table occupied. I shrugged off the fact that we were seated on a dirty table and our servers only half-bussed it while we were seated. I was in a great mood, I was hungry, annnnd I looove sushi.

So, there we were in a near-empty restaurant. Just one other table occupied. There were two servers. Three sushi makers...

We were told we could only order ONE item at a time. This was really dumb for AYCE. 20 minutes later, first roll comes... it was good! I could also hear the 3 sushi makers talking about whatever...I wondered why none of them were doing anything most of the time. Finally! The second roll comes about 15 minutes later only to be devoured in 30 seconds! We were kinda done trying to keep conversations going because we just wanted to EAT!

OMG. Yay! Our server comes by so we can order another roll! This time, our server goes ""Woah! you're STILL EATING? It's been an hour! Jeez!"" (She should work at Dick's Last Resort tbh) Anyhoo, our roll never came and the nicer server came and asked us about 3 times every 5-10 minutes if our food came yet. Nope. Our favorite (blech) server comes back and shrieks that we've been eating too much of their food and that she should cut us off. She did this while we were just sitting there, still not eating. She was probably joking but she came off as really awkward and rude.

WOW. That third roll STILL didn't come. It's nice to know they are so concerned if that third roll ever came or not and after the 5th time we were asked about those ""bites of deliciousness"" (as that weird server kept referring to) and it still never made it to the table. Lol.. it was pretty ridiculous.. I mean, the sushi makers are like 10 feet away..  I got the impression that this place offers ""All you can eat, if you can even get your food.""

I was tired of waiting for the food and my friend was so annoyed by our server acting like we were eating the entire time. Eventually I felt offended too because she was making us feel bad for eating what we were not eating! She didn't say smack to the people occupying the other table who kept getting roll after roll after roll.. Was it Opposite Day or what? 

Sigh. With a total of two rolls for two people, we left really hungry and ate somewhere else. Way to turn a great mood into a frown :( If this was an off day for them.. Wow. That was off-er than off. Haha. I don't know. OOH. WAIT. OOOH  OH! GET THIS! Ask for the check and suddenly service goes lightning speed and the check comes in 15 seconds! It was amazing!! Yea, you get that check girl.

The restaurant itself could use a fresh coat of paint. It looks like a generic burger cafe with beige walls and no interesting decor, but if they painted the walls Red and added more Asian art, possibly make it a bit more intimate they could probably charge more for the experience.

As it is, the staff was typically friendly. But the food was extraordinary. Every Sushi restaurant I go to I always get their Japanese Lasagna. I have to say that SCS Japanese Lasagna is the BEST in Las Vegas. It is topped with just the right amount of Cream Cheese and Ponzu sauce but they add a delicious smokey flavor to it that makes every bite (down to the last piece) worth the effort. I saved it for the last because I knew if I were full with Sushi (which is typical) I'd still want to finish that.

3146658,2011-03-21,0,nuRLQaPYbH6raFgSv-C_8g,"Fresh fish, tasty rolls & super friendly service make for a fantastic sushi night out. The restaurant was busy- always a good sign. My friends and I, a party of five, originally sat at one of the middle tables as all the booths were taken, but our awesome waitress offered to transfer us to a booth when one was available. After fifteen minutes or so, a booth was available, and we made the easy transition w/ the help of the servers. I wasn't that hungry so I opted for the a la carte menu while my friends went for the AYCE, but seeing how much they enjoyed the food, I will come back for the AYCE when I'm in the mood. 

After looking over the many roll choices, I ordered the Sue roll- tuna, avocado, shiitake mushrooms & cucumber. Even though the place was packed, my order came out relatively fast. Simpler than most of the rolls offered, the Sue roll was the perfect choice as I wanted something light. 
Pros: The roll was sweet (from the rice & tuna) which complemented the salty & spicy flavors from the soy sauce & wasabi mixture, and the crunchiness of the cucumber balanced the creaminess of the avocado. 
Cons: I couldn't taste the smoky, earthy flavor of the shiitake mushrooms, and consequently, forgot that they were in the roll. I also didn't like the deep red/purple color of the tuna (seemed too unnatural). 
But, overall, I enjoyed the roll and thought it tasted yummy. 

And even though sharing is not allowed between AYCE eaters and a la carte eaters, I tried a bite of my friend's sweet potato tempura (no complaints), one piece of the Wet Dream roll (In: Shrimp tempura and cucumber; Out: Salmon, Avocado & lots of garlic cream sauce...awesome) and one piece of the Jackie roll (In: Calamari tempura, yum sauce & masago; Out: Avocado & Uni Sauce...really good). She was getting too full, so she asked me to help her out (How can I refuse? Wasting food is not cool. Don't judge!). 

Only one dessert per AYCE order. I think this rule is implemented because of the low profit margins that desserts bring in, but, still, desserts are usually the cheapest items on a menu, so I think this rule needs to be no more. 

Three stars for the food and one star for the service. Definitely not the best sushi I've tasted, but definitely better than some other sushi places I've tried. I need to go here for AYCE next time!",PspDTd6CrF1aUtdC_k73-w,5,1,4,J0Lv2kaczeZTAJaRPsxpQA

There is an abundance of All You Can Eat Sushi places in town and everyone swears by their favorite. I swear by this one and will fight to the death with anyone who disagrees with me.  

The owners proudly guarantee to their patrons that they have the freshest fish in town.  They truly do. My favorite appetizers are their famous green mussels and baby tako (baby octopus).  I like to order the No Name #2 hand roll, Kasia roll, and the Vampire roll.  Sometimes the owners give us some complimentary nigiri like the freshest albacore belly I've ever had.

But.... Omg the service, or lack of.... I cannot even deal.

We got an older asian lady and her service was so horrible we weren't even going to leave a tip. She took about 15 minutes to even seat us. And it was not even that busy; she brought food to another table, saw us standing there, passed by us and went to sit behind her counter in the back of the restaurant. Looked up at us at least 10 times THEN decided she wanted to get up to seat us. Without even a ""I'll be right with you"" in between. Really?!?!

Honestly, I don't even remember what we ordered. The service was so bad, that is pretty much the only thing I remember. I just remember that the food was pretty good & because the Spicy Salmon is one of my favorite rolls, and I always order it, I remember it was really good.

First orders are made using the checklist style menu which isn't even printed clearly. Whatever you plan on eating, you better order it then because she did not even come back to check on us until 25 minutes into our meal and we wanted to order more food. (We sat at a table because the bar didn't have space for me and my boyfriend to sit together).

FINALLY after several attempts of trying to wave the lady down, a younger guy from BEHIND THE BAR came to help us and take our orders. He was great, really nice, apologized that the lady didn't see us, and took our orders and remembered all of it to the T. Even refilled our drinks!

3660837,2012-10-15,1,nuRLQaPYbH6raFgSv-C_8g,"I've never reviewed a restaurant because most of the time i just don't care enough. I hate the idea of writing a bad review because I'm empathetic toward small business owners. 

However, this restaurant seems to have enough unwarranted raving reviews for me not to feel guilty revealing the truth. I've lived in Vegas for 8 years and I have my regular sushi spots. The only reason I decided to try this joint was because it was a Friday night and my regular choices had a 1-2 hour wait. I remembered reading all of the positive reviews for this place so I decided to check it out. Maybe the fact that there was no wait at 8pm on a Friday night should have been the first indicator...

The service was really slow. The food took a VERY long time. My friend's spicy tuna roll took twice the time as one of our deep fried rolls. Our server was sweet and I had no problem with her demeanor but SHE was just as slow. I say this because there were several times that I saw our rolls sitting and waiting to be delivered for quite some time before she brought it over. The amaebi nigiri that I ordered was sitting on the counter for so long before I got it that the heads were completely cold and soggy. Strangely enough, the busser was EXTREMELY efficient...almost too efficient. It began to irritate me that they were so quick to clear the table but couldn't get any help to deliver the food. I know that sounds extremely critical but it just did not sit well with me. Again, the server was extremely nice and even apologetic for the slow service so she got her 20% tip but I was a server for years...I'm not sure if others would be as patient.

Now I am usually forgiving of slow service if the taste is worth the wait. In this case, the taste was definitely not worth ANY wait. The rice was too watery and ruined the taste of the rolls. The sashimi did not taste fresh and some of it even lacked any taste at all. I ordered the uni and it was literally stale and dried up. This may be one of the worst sushi places I have ever been to just based on taste. Additionally, the AYCE menu is limited in comparison to others in city. Natto and toro were not included on the AYCE. Toro I can understand but why not the Natto? Same goes for the side orders.

There are much better options in town for sushi. I Love Sushi is probably one of the best in town and I would suggest Yama Sushi or Sushi-Mon for AYCE over this place any day. You just have to be willing to wait to be seated...but there's a reason people are lining up to eat there.",bLi-JDTGOCjzm1hLax-HzA,2,1,1,CZnxhvk1MRMIhIBiLRRyXA

The thing I liked about this place is that we kept ordering and our sushi kept coming out right away.  What more can you ask for right?  Plus, the staff (especially the manager) came over and asked for our opinions on the rolls and service and was delighted to receive as much feedback as he could in order to make the experience even better.  They also had a TV behind the sushi bar for the avid sporting fans and actually changed the channel to accommodate the people at the bar; definitely a nice touch.

So pissed! 4 parties walk in and got their rolls and I Asked her, ""why are they getting their food first?! We were here way before them"" And she said because they were al la carte. Wtf!!??? I told the kids to get in the car and told her we're only paying for what we got. So I walk to the register and saw what she was charging us and she was writing the rolls we didn't get and I told her we never got those rolls and she can check the plates that  were still left on the table. Bill came out to 64$ and I still left 6$ tip. I def don't recommend coming here. Sooooooo stupid!!!",lQMPY34fKGIZvcgnRyl6lA,2,0,1,izmlQ8OosEJ_iPVoOxywXQ

4012901,2010-10-10,1,nuRLQaPYbH6raFgSv-C_8g,"Wanted to try this place out because of all the good reviews on Yelp and was disappointed. Bad sign when it only had white folk eating there and we were the only asians to be seen.  Aside from that, there were a number of reasons for the disappointment:

1) First off, when you go to a vegas ayce sushi joint you expect mediocre quality fish because of the sheer volume these places put out as well as the fact that you're in the middle of the desert.  That being said, the quality of the fish at 808 Sushi and both Sushi Mon locations are better imo.  

2) Rice. It was over cooked & gummy, and they put way too much rice on their nigiri!  Good sushi has a nice slice of fish covering a small dollop of sushi rice, but not here.  Each piece had a lot of overcooked rice underneath. Bleh.

3) Selection wasn't very good for the side dishes.  Most of these ayce sushi restaurants have their special side dishes in addition to the sushi to give your tastebuds a rest from all the sushi you consume.  Tried the teri salmon (meh), pork katsu (thin and dry), shrimp tempura (okay), soft shell crab (too much batter), and oyster shooters (pretty good).  Other places offer hamachi kama, kal bi, miso cod (butterfish) just to name a few things--not here. Sides were weak sauce here.

4) I've read about how you ""MUST HAVE"" the vampire roll, baby octopus, and fried banana for dessert, and all were painfully mediocre.  First two I had at the beginning of the meal while I was still hungry, and both were a struggle to finish.  Maybe I'm spoiled from living in Hawaii, but think of somewhere that has tako poke that is ""just alright"", and it probably tastes better than this baby octopus app.  Fried banana was pitiful--after one bite i opted to finish the green tea ice cream that came with it instead (Maeda-en, which isnt that great to begin with).

Maybe all of the 5 star ratings got my hopes up a little, but that doesn't change the fact that this place is below avg when it comes to Vegas ayce sushi.  Service was alright, nothing terribly wrong happened, just had a below-avg dining experience here due to the food.  Seriously--808 Sushi, Sushi Mon (both locations), Oyshi Sushi, Hikari are all better than this place.  Hell, if I was in that part of town jonesing for some ayce sushi I'd just walk across the street to Island Sushi!!  Will not go back.",-NHlY-5Bu4CVDtvl2uuCPg,1,1,1,14pRAHTDjqyOGnEsRC7QMA

Service was quirky but very attentive.  Much friendlier and more helpful than your average sushi place.  

AYCE was $26 and included everything you would want and expect with a ton of specialty rolls, and dessert.

We had miso soup, seaweed salad, baby tako, 7 or 8 rolls, sushi, gyoza, baked green mussels, soft shell crab, and so on.  

The miso soup was very flavorful, the baby tako was a lovely, tender sesame flavored surprise, and the baked green mussels were extra caramelized and delicious.  The hamachi and garlic tuna was fresh and delightful.

We were very pleased with most of the rolls.  

Our food came out very slowly, and was well paced.  Normally, you are bombarded with everything your ordered within minutes and you can hardly discern what is what.  All the items we ordered came out individually, 5 - 10 minutes apart.  It gave us plenty of time to chat and enjoy each item.

4108266,2012-12-10,0,nuRLQaPYbH6raFgSv-C_8g,"Time to add one more AYCE-capable sushi place to my Vegas list.

I was wondering how this place was different from other sushi restaurants, and I was pleased to see a board with a lot of one-per-person or two-per-person options. The more unique ones include bacon skewers, beef yakitori skewers, oyster shooters, baby tako, asparagus tempura, and poke that can come in chicken or salmon or oyster varieties instead of just tuna.

There were a few issues that I wanna highlight. First, the food seemed to come out a little slowly compared to, well, any other of my usual sushi destinations. Second, even though we had to mark our first order on paper menus, they did not really fulfill that order completely and left us having to do at least one reorder. Finally, I was kinda not impressed by the nigiri. The pieces were unusually large, with a slight bias toward the rice that wasn't even done that well. I mean it wasn't normal rice, but the texture at least was off and it didn't stand up as well as other nigiri that I've had in the area. Also, in terms of fish that I tried, only the hamachi was good (disappointments: salmon, garlic tuna, super white).

The one thing that really made me not drop this below a 4-star review was when they came out to explain that they were out of salmon kama and offered to replace it with hamachi kama, which is normally not on the AYCE menu. This type of gesture hasn't happened at two or more other places that I've been to. On top of that, the hamachi kama was actually really yummy and tender, and aside from having to remove the burnt skin, it was the highlight of the night for me.

Other items that I enjoyed: the oyster shooters (I think it's two per order) were pretty balanced, even though I had to reorder them; the baked mussels were good, if mayo-y; the salmon teriyaki was really good and could be a pre-dessert (since this is a one dessert per person place); the soft shell crab was so good (and small, compared to Blue Fin Sushi) that I wished it wasn't one per person; the vampire roll was nice and the surf and turf roll had pretty nice beef on top; the fried banana was sundae-like and was a pretty filling dessert.

Oh, and I also appreciated the lack of lemon in the water. I'm really put off by the lemon that permeates the water. No, I don't really care if it's just tap water that might not even be filtered, I want just water.

I wasn't expecting the next coming of Goyemon or anything, and there's definitely some ups and downs. Still, I think it's worth a first try if you're in the mood for something new.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,2,1,4,6aX0p0OtzZHCJVwoEoCK3Q

The crap of the shrimp is left in the shrimp..... When I told the waitress about it she at 1st she seemed stunned and said she was going to show the cook and even said ""I don't know why it is like that"" refering to our shrimp tempura that had alot of mushed up black shrimp crap inside of it. Then after a few minutes she came back with a different demeanor.... she said all their shrimp is like that and that she could bring us more vegetable tempura but that all their shrimp dishes uses the same shrimp. I said ""I'm sure you use the same shrimp but ""good/clean"" restaurants clean out the shrimp. Her response was ""No one ever complained before"".... 
My sister said well maybe your poor customers don't notice or even know that the shrimp should be cleaned. Your cook is lazy and your customers are being tricked....
We asked to speak to the Manager and she said she was the manager- yeah, I don't think so.... She took off $4.00 -which came down to $1.00 per shrimp that wasn't eaten... 
 I have reviewed this place before a few years ago and I'll tell you one thing if their shrimp at the time had as much shrimp poop inside their shrimp as it did the other day I would've noticed and gave them a 1 star. So they must have had a change in management or they need to review the cleanliness aspect of preparing their food for their customers to eat. 
Don't get me wrong the food itself taste wise is just fine and maybe that's why the shrimp crap is overlooked by most of their customers but it was just disgusting to me. 

We eat out alot and most of the time it is for sushi and I can't imagine a (good) sushi chef who truly cares about the sushi they are preparing and serving to their customers will be willing to serve unclean shrimp..... NO!! That's just a NO!!!

Fish was fresh and tasty. Nigiri was the best. Everything except the uni was fresh and the texture just right. I'm fairly picky with my uni though, so it may have been just fine for some people.

Rolls were hit and miss. 

Vampire,  Lew, Spicy hamachi and Wet dream tasted great. Just the right amount of everything to let the flavors come through.

Lasagna and Poncho was alright. I felt the sauces overpowered anything that the sushi roll could have offered. 

Spider roll and Double seared were total misses. The spider roll was by far the worse I've ever tasted. The soft shell crab was way too mushy. And the double seared, the fish had an off taste to it.

Typically, my experiences have always been amiable. However, warning to the customer that there is a HUGE gap in the quality of service you recieve whether you are at the bar or sitting at a table. Quite frankly, the waitresses are terrible here. Every time I have ever sat at a table, I usually find myself waiting forever for them to come by and take my order.

The food, typically, has always been fairly good, although, my recent experiences with their nigiri makes me wonder if it's just whatever sauce they use to mask the quality of their fish. Despite that, several items I've come to enjoy, the No Name hand roll being probably my favorite.

My last time there, however, I sat in a booth with my fiancee and as we finished a small round of food (which took a very long time to come out), we sat there waiting for a long time. I finally stopped a waitress and asked if I could put in another order, which I did, and proceeded to wait another 20 minutes while the waitresses sat behind the cash register with blank stares on their faces (it was not busy). I finally got tired of waiting, got her attention, and just asked for the check. After paying, I asked if my food was still coming, and she proceeded to tell me that my order was 'complete'. That pretty much tipped me into anger, as I wasn't just sitting around for no reason. 

The waitress scrambled after I was so upset and he had the chef make my order which was out in less than a minute - that made me even more angry. I ate a few pieces, but lost my appetite and left.

-their rolls are tiny-ish.  they don't try to stuff it so much that all you can get is 2 rolls and then you're done 
-the ""screaming 'o'"" is available during lunch
-sides like salmon kama, fried tofu, bacon skewer, poke salad, screaming o....

4540449,2012-02-05,2,nuRLQaPYbH6raFgSv-C_8g,"This was my first time here and I can only give it 2 stars.  Normally I am sure this is an ok place, it was rated at 4 stars with 103 reviews, however, that does not justify the treatment we received on this night.

We had 5 people in our party and 3 of use decided to take the all you can eat sushi.  We each ordered an appetizer and 3 rolls each.  3x3=9 in most places.  

So, first off the staff was friendly upon arrival and we were seated fairly quickly.  Our drink order was taken pretty fast as well as our order.  The appetizers came pretty quickly, however then the service came to a crawl.  First one roll, then finally another, by the end of an hour we had received 6 rolls.  I only got one of mine, someone else got two of hers and of course the last person got all three of hers.

We continually had to ask for refills on the tea as they were not coming over and checking on us.  They would come by and take the empty plates but would not always ask if we needed anything.  Finally our server came over and asked if there would be anything else?  NOW THE BATTLE BEGAN!!!!

I stated yes, I am still missing two rolls and she is missing one.  The server stated no your are not, I was told you received everything you ordered and I was told your table is done.  I stated that was incorrect and the we were still missing three rolls and named the three we were missing.  She again stated that she was told we received everything we ordered.  NOW WE ARE GOING TO BATTLE.  I ordered three rolls and only got one, DON'T""T TELL ME I ATE THREE WHEN I DID NOT.  She then stated, let me go get your ticket and check.  She came back to the table and proceeded to read the entire ticket to me.

When she was done, I again stated by NAME the three rolls we did not receive.  With a frustrated sigh, she said let go check with the kitchen.  NOW HERE IS MY QUESTION; 

If I am ordering all you can eat, WHY ARE YOU GOING TO DEBATE ME ON HOW MUCH I RECEIVED?  The price is the same if I order one roll or twenty rolls, yes???

A few times through dinner we had to request refills instead of it just being done.  To clarify, they came to the table several times to pick up the empty dishes but would not always check to see if we needed anything.

When I am paying for something, I don't expect to be debated on what I ordered and received.  With several sushi places within a 5 miles radius of this place all offering all you can eat for about the same price, I can get better service without being debated by the staff on what I received and what I did not.  If you are the only person bringing me my food then maybe, but when there were two other people bringing stuff to the table, who the hell are you to debate me on what I received???

In closing the food was decent and does warrant 3 to 4 stars for quality.  We still left an 18% tip, 15% would have been too generous for the way we were treated.  None of the five of us have a desire to return to this place.  Like I said there are several places to choose from within a 5 mile radius of this place with the same quality or better and you will not be harassed by the staff or have to encounter and ugly battle or debate about what you received.  

ALL YOU CAN EAT MEANS, I ORDER IT, YOU HAPPILY BRING IT.  IF I DON'T EAT ALL I ORDERED, THEN YOUR POLICY IS TO CHARGE EXTRA.  NO WHERE IN YOUR POLICY DOES IT STATE YOU WILL DEBATE ME ON WHAT I RECEIVED AND PLACED IN MY MOUTH.  

I came here hungry, I believe I would know if I received and ate three rolls.  Two stars is more then generous for the treatment we received.  The good part, we now know a place we will NOT RETURN TO EVER AGAIN....",kzRq4H_nSf4b3F_sdymWSw,2,1,2,kkApd_eckgv9Ybd_6laETQ

I finally got my chance at last night's UYE. Thanks to Nelson Q for setting that up. There were about 16 of us sitting at an elongated table. It was great meeting new faces and conversing over good sushi.

Unfortunately, I can't name everything we ate. We went omakase style i.e. we mostly left it up to the sushi chef to decide what to make next. We did have the option to order whatever we wanted individually, but I opted to just eat whatever came. And boy did I. Pretty much everything that came out was good or very good. I can't say that anything blew me away, but I'd return on the strength of what I experienced.

About them Oyster Shooters. That's definitely a reason to return. A few of us had a couple of rounds. This was actually the first time I've had an Oyster Shooter in my life. Until recently in fact, I just wasn't into oysters.

Another first for me was Uni. I don't remember exactly why, but they've always been on my avoid list. However, Cin T's recent persuasion made me want to give them a shot. I enjoyed them and was surprised at how mild the flavor was. Quite the contrast to how totally NOT yummy they look.

When it came time for dessert, I went with the Fried Banana (banana tempura with ice cream). It was delicious, as expected.

Overall, it was a great night. Although I'm still partial to Yama Sushi, I'd return here for the Oyster Shooters. I also like the idea of coming in, sitting at the bar, and going omakase style.",YwaKGmRNnSa3R3N4Hf9jLw,2,2,4,LcXIG8GAg4Au_iF_oCsgAQ

Sin City Sushi exceeded my expectations. We went for the AYCE since we didn't eat a thing the whole day saving up our appetites for our date night. Sat at the bar, pretty early, around 5:30, was greeted very kindly by all three sushi chefs, and we began our feast. My favorite roll was the Lion, and their Hamachi and Unagi sushi were very fresh and yummy. Everything we tried was excellent, came out fast, and even got a few recommendations of orders to change when the chefs thought we'd like a different roll better than our selection.

By the time we left (7ish) the place was completely packed and everyone there seemed to either know someone's name or were being welcomed back again by the staff.

4981599,2013-02-12,1,nuRLQaPYbH6raFgSv-C_8g,"When it comes to AYCE, we've always been going to Sushi-Mon if we're looking to stay on our side of town but this time, we wanted to try a new place out and came across Sin City Sushi based on the reviews.

Walked in, saw a sushi chef that I previously worked with on the sushi line so we decided to sit at the sushi bar. Sat down then realized that we would rather sit back at a table since the sushi bar table was awkwardly low. To sit there, I would probably have to yell my orders to my friend since the height gap between him and I were extremely long. You're not even in eye contact with the sushi chefs. You would constantly have to look up. Uncomfortable.

My boyfriend and I aren't rolls eaters so we tend to stick with nigiris and side orders. It was about 12pm with about several tables and the service was REALLY SLOW. I cut the waitress some slack since she was the only one on the floor until she would suddenly disappear at times and personally answer her cell phone with food from the kitchen on her other hand. Unsanitary! It was as if she wasn't trying. She was going to keep at her own pace and that's that.

We came to this place very hungry, having to knock out our order with a long list to start. Nigiris shouldn't take more than ten minutes to arrive. It just shouldn't. I've been to a number of AYCE joints (usually all being a full house) and the average wait time for nigiris would be around five minutes tops for a single type of fish. Dug in and was disappoint at the first bite. We've never tasted nigiri so bland before.

Honestly, I don't think there's anything wrong with the fish there. It's just how they prepare the sushi rice is what got me. You're suppose to taste a hint of rice vinegar since that's the key ingredient to keep the moisture of the rice together but instead, it was bland like a side of room temperature steamed rice box from a mom and pop Chinese restaurant.

So we thought maybe a roll would be better. Ordered a couple and was told that they don't do half-orders. (What?!) Told her it was fine to keep them whole in hopes that they'll make up for the orders of nigiri. Rolls came out (15 minutes later) and it was bleh. I think this was the first time we've never finished everything on the table and was NOT charged for the leftovers since she probably guessed that we were over it midway through our meal.

If you're a sushi feen, this place is not for you. I don't think they experience a lot of table turnovers to keep rotating the freshness/quality of the fish/rice around. The restaurant could use a makeover too since it wasn't inviting when we walked in. Overall, this place has a lot to work on. I would rather not have sushi for an entire year than to eat here if this was the last sushi restaurant on the planet.",P49ulSRSHLNnIP-efK-qhw,6,3,2,Qplu3Rk5Ku5rq7WJLO5lyQ
5051594,2010-12-29,3,nuRLQaPYbH6raFgSv-C_8g,"I've been wanting to try this out since it's been hyped up by my Elite buddies. Apparently, my boyfriend beat us all to it and found this place when it first opened with his buddy who lives nearby and kept telling me that ""when we're over there we got to go"". Yeah, we're almost never in Henderson so fast forward a few years and I finally got here. I'm in Los Angeles more often than I am across town. 

They said their grill was down, but hey I wasn't here for hot food so we sat happily to AYCE and stuck with raw or fried. 

The BF and I started off with:

Hamachi- it's good quality and fresh. 
Albacore- most people put a bit of green onion and ponzu, but this is the first that I had a drop of hot sauce on it. It's pretty good that way.
Kasia Roll (soft shell crab with yum yum sauce roll topped with albacore, salmon, avocado, ponzu)- pretty good. I'm not a roll person usually because I find they're uninspired or not balanced. This has an interesting balance of crunchy, creamy and soft textures and flavors from spicy to tangy. 
Soft Shell Crab- noms. a little lemon and ponzu set it off. 
Seaweed salad- it's standard like anyplace. Just a good palette cleanser.

We then thought lets ask for a chef surprise. 

He made us a vampire roll (similar to kasia but topped more simply with albacore), and stacy roll (tempura roll with shredded krab, masago, yum yum and eel sauce with some crunchies) because it's their top 2 rolls. Vampire is good because we already liked the kasia. I haven't had a roll that I've enjoyed in a while though I keep trying rolls at places. Stacy was pretty good considering I'm not a krab sushi kind of person. The two sauces and the crunchies are what sets it off. 

I then go off and order us some No Name Handrolls (fried squid chopped up, masago, chopped tuna, sesame, eel sauce). He recommended a bit of soy sauce on it to enhance the tuna. This was quite nice and again, I was appreciating that they're doing different things. I like that the squid was fresh and soft- not chewy at all so that the BF can eat it too (he has braces). 

I was feeling adventurous and asked if he can make me a piece of uni because I don't know if I like it.  I hear ""its sweet"" all the time and what I tasted the one time I had it was like sea ass- very briny and iodine tasting. He said he wants me to try it when he has fresh good ones since they are down to the bottom of the uni. 

He then asks if I like oysters and proceeded to make oyster shooters. I normally shy away from oyster shooters because at most places it's made to be like some inside fucked up joke with whats in it. Here it's oysters, a bit of sauce and hot sauce. That's it. Just sweet oysters and a little bit of sauce to flavor it. It's not like most where it's also with some raw quail egg, sake, wasabi, hot sauce, etc. etc. I can get behind this kind of shooter.

I then noticed baby tako on a menu. I thought it'll be like little whole ones with a dipping sauce, but it was a nice surprised that it was the Japanese octopus salad I love so much- Tako no sunomono. Theirs has a nice smokey flavor to the tako, a bit of chili slices and the sweet vinegar sesame marinate ties it all in. I also grabbed the ika tempura since the no name roll had some nice fried ika in it and it was quite nice. 

BF starts tapping out so I grab some saba (this was just ok in freshness), and a salmon skin handroll. I like that their salmon skin has the usual components of skin, gobo, cucumber, sprouts and theirs also adds takuan (picked yellow daikon) and a light drizzle of eel sauce. 

Now here is the rub- food came out a bit slow. We were there from 4:30 to a bit past 6. I normally wouldn't complain but I was hungry, yet had someplace to be heading to before they closed at 7pm and there was only a 1 top, two 2 top and a 4 top between two chefs.  Nigiri rice was nice and sweet, but rice to fish ratio wasn't as proportional as some of my favorite spots. Slightly a bit more than ideal. 

It seems the favorite is Jesse who wasn't working so next time I come back I'll try to come in when he is here. It seems that was also the chef my BF had which he said was very good service. 

So far it's a positive experience but not quite 5 stars. I at least gives hats off to some creativity to the rolls and the food was overall fresh.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,8,6,4,hTx9KIVxSu8qn7Pav5BF4A

My staples here are three stacie rolls and two lasagna rolls. Their stacie rolls is always freaking perfect to my mouth. If they could my taste buds would marry the stacie rolls. It has the perfect amount of crunch and the perfect of amount of soft yummy-ness. It always sets the mood right for  a night of ayce sushi eating fun. The lasagna roll is no exception too. IF my taste buds did marry the stacie rolls the lasagna rolls would be that ex-girlfriend trying to win my taste buds back. All you have to do is put it in your mouth and let the rolls do the work. It freaking melts in my mouuuuthhh and as soon as it melts and you think it's over...a explosion of delicious gooey-ness happens and a mouth orgasm beings to happen.

This was the most awful sushi experience that I've ever had. I was in a party of six people and our food was just not coming out. We waited a full hour before getting any rolls. Then they kept bringing us rolls that we did not order and it appeared that this was happening to several other tables in the establishment. 

While this was occurring, two men were at the bar purchasing shots for the chefs. The chefs took three shots in the one hour that it took to get any rolls, their inebriated state probably explaining the complete mess. The servers did not know what we had coming to us as they kept asking us if we ordered anything else. Shouldn't they know what we ordered? We also had to ask repeatedly for drink refills and for mussels. Tables that sat down after us were served before us; the servers had no idea what was going on and the chefs were drunk.

The taste of the food was horrible; everything was loaded with cream of some sort. Our rolls were half cream cheese and all of them were covered with some type of mayo based sauce. Now I enjoy cream cheese in my sushi, and yum yum sauce, but this was overkill. I ended up sending back a whole roll without eating it because I was getting sick. One of my rolls was swimming in cream sauce and literally had cubes of cream cheese sitting on top. My friend's hand roll was filled with scallops and dripping with cream sauce. 

Finally, without being able to handle any more, we asked for our check. We did not finish the hand roll or the roll described above. The server had the audacity to tell us ""uh oh, you have some leftovers."" I explained to him that the food was disgusting, the service was awful, we waited an hour for food and we received rolls we did not order. I will pay for the all you can eat and my iced tea and that was it. He said the decision wasn't up to him and left. He came with the bill and had put a left over charge on it. I explained that they were lucky to get paid at all, as we didn't receive our correct order and barely ate any of it. The commotion caught the attention of the manager who came over and apologized. 

The server went to fix our bill and came back, charging us for six AYCE when we only ordered 4 (2 members of our party ordered a la cart). We finally were able to pay for what we ordered and left.

The unprofessional nature and audacity of this establishment is appalling and I will never return.",RJs8zfeX9ZUZRzohg6qoSQ,1,1,1,1dot2zixj1lneLvZNN4sdQ

I also appreciate the fact that when the uni was not up to standards they warned us, gave us a taste, and did not hold it against us when we did not like it either.

For starters; baby tako, soft shell crab, and baked green mussels are the way to go. As for rolls, many of them come heavily sauced. I am not the biggest fan of that, but the one's without kind of fell flat. They need to meet somewhere in the middle. The Ugly was tasty, but three different dressings and the amount was overkill. The Sapporo Crunch Roll was one that stuck out because of all the different kind of veggies. The generous amounts of avocado and less rice was much appreciated. Their hirame does not come with a ponzu or anything, so I could tell that it was fresh.

Now a days, I have turned into a senior citizen and eat dinner around 5. It was nice to meet some of my Yelpie friends here for a late dinner. Even though I did not eat as much as I would if we had met earlier, I still left feeling full without feeling like dying. We sat until almost closing and no one rushed us out.

I took my daughter there for Thanksgiving we both enjoyed everything we ordered. Everything tasted fresh and it took some time to get our apps so I know it wasn't sitting around. Plus no rush whatsoever. The owner was even pushing us to eat more after we were already full. He was suggesting rolls he thought we would like based on the rolls we had ordered. Usually they want you out! He was so so nice to us and we were sitting at a table not the sushi bar. The service was good and they never looked at us funny when we didn't eat every morsel.

After you asked for something that hasn't come to the table be prepared for the servers to snob you the rest of the time you are there and pretty much throw the food on your table.

The restaurant was at full capacity after we sat.

My wife and daughter loved their teriyaki chicken combo boxes. The combo actually comes with half a Stacie roll instead of the typical California roll. I had my usual nigiri lineup with a couple of hand rolls and a Japanese lasagna roll. No problems or issues with the sushi, it was as good as it usually is.

Some things that I like about Sin City are the cucumber salad has crab meat or fish topping the salad, the oyster shooters, the soft shell crab, and the mussels.

The service was pretty bad. We were there for two hours spending most of the time waiting and not eating. My daughter actually fell asleep at the table because she was tired of waiting. There were three servers working the floor. Two older women and a younger woman. I wouldn't be surprised if the younger server suffered a back injury after that night because she was carrying the other two women piggy back style all night. She was working hard and I felt bad for her, but when she has to cover for the other two, the customers really suffer. One of the older servers was spending most of the time caring for the patrons at the sushi bar and busing tables, the other one was MIA for twenty minutes at time leaving the younger server hanging out to dry.

They have like 3 difft kinds of beer and like 3 difft kinds of sake not a large selection and nothing that got me excited.

Sushi wasn't bad you can't order sashimi so you have to eat your rice, which is something they stress with signs all over the place. I hate being told what I need to eat and don't eat, if I don't like it I'm not going to force feed myself so I can finish my rice. PS I don't eat that much rice and when I do it's typically not white rice, I did not see the option to change your white rice out to brown rice either which I typically do.  They rolls are good size though not too big just right to pop a piece in your mouth and not have a hard time chewing it.

I didn't have any particular roll that I was overwhelmed with amazement on, there's some really good ones at I Love Sushi, anyhow it's good enough.

Our waiter couldn't speak English, didn't understand English, and simply made our experience unbearable. 90% of the time our waitress was actually on her phone and ignored our request for service. She was very short when we asked her questions about the menu items, looked annoyed when we did order anything, and it seemed like she would toss our food in front of us when she ""served"" it.

If you go here you gotta try the Vampire!!!!",2kdYRt0qoxS9vptE7SFBHA,1,1,5,0AL_4AfxCN9kNc9RpQrgmg

We could barely understand our waitress, they were out of both saki's we picked and we ordered ala carte. The food was good, but again average at best.",9xlwSCtOABq2CuzY_REQpw,2,1,3,9am_JSrALdH8K2ztdAV_Yw

Jesse, our sushi chef, chatted with us and introduced us to some regulars. We never really had to wait too long since Jesse could see when we had finished one roll and would promply make another. We were there for around 2 hours and left FULL! We ordered 10 or 11 rolls and a few pieces of nigiri between 2 of us and felt we got our moneys worth. Everything tasted great and was really fresh. We will be back!",0upLXvOe-ejNyeyTifRxJQ,2,2,5,06gFCSR7CCm2_7VeweMI0Q
5757438,2012-01-18,0,nuRLQaPYbH6raFgSv-C_8g,"After hearing great things about sin city sushi we had to give it a try. I'm quickly becoming a sushi fanatic so i had to give this place a try. First impression, super small place and of course we got there on a Friday night @ 730 and was told it would be about a 15-20 min wait but it ended up being 40 mins and the bar top is not first come first serve. I have to say I've never waited that long for sushi but i was eager to try it and see if it lived up to its name. They do offer a handful of special rolls for the day that are on the ayce list. The Ugly roll was a special roll and i hope it stays cuz its to die for! I think it's the best roll I've tasted anywhere. We also had the vampire roll that is a must order too. The mussels are a contender to Yama sushi mussels, juicy and flavorful. My standard orders are a cucumber salad which wasn't impressive unfortunately, it was small and not too flavorful. The edamame was good, hot n salty. My fiance ordered the beef curry but wasn't impressed. I had ordered two rolls myself
that came to the table 20 mins after my finances order (ugly roll, vampire roll and beef curry) even tho we placed the order all at the same time. So that was kinda upsetting being that I helped myself to his rolls and was full by the time mine came out. I ordered the girlfriend roll which was also a special, good but not as good as the ugly roll. They only offer half rolls on your last order which stinks b/c I like variety and half orders allow that w/o ordering too much. Overall a must try for all sushi lovers!",4arRGEGcg5vIAFCg7kbOgQ,0,0,4,eEIzmysqnIdZhA1Fc7Vxhg

The service was fantastic and their decor is a nice. I walked in and sat at the sushi bar. I was immediately given wasabi and ginger. The sushi chef informed me that their stacy roll was their most popular roll. I ordered what the chef suggested along with baby tako, 2 orders of yellowtail and 2 orders of salmon, tiger roll, Kasia roll, and their baked green mussels. 

The baby tako was definitely my favorite out of everything I ordered. Their stacy roll was ok, nothing amazing. Their baked green mussels were definitely better than a lot of places I have tried. What disappointed me, was their sushi. 

Their fish is not as fresh as some of the other places I have tried. Their sushi rice, sorry to say, was awful. The sushi rice was so sweet it almost tasted like candied rice. It was a little gummy as well, a sign of over mixing the rice. Sushi rice is supposed to have some texture to it, a firmness and a subtle but not overpowering sweetness. I was taken aback by all the amazing reviews this place has and everyone seems to like it, however, this rice can't be overlooked, as any sushi place should have amazing sushi rice, regardless if its a AYCE place or Okada. It is just unacceptable to have bad sushi rice. 

I can't see myself coming back here, unfortunately. Their rice is something I can't overlook. I can't go back because of that sushi rice. Their fish is not the best as everyone claims. It is just ok. I have had better at many other places. Yama sushi and Sushi mon both have better fish than this place and their rice never tastes gummy or overly sweet. 

If you do happen to go regardless, try their tempura banana with their vanilla ice cream. That was great! The 3 stars go for the friendly service, and some of the appetizers and their dessert. I can't give many props for their fish nor their rolls. They were not amazing by any means. I was expecting better, especially from a place who is given 5 star reviews.",VUrTgQhEB4Vo04xbnNiNyQ,4,1,3,UCj7alwmtqnfaNKoHpBVHQ
5834160,2015-03-30,4,nuRLQaPYbH6raFgSv-C_8g,A good quality and good service sushi joint. Small place with great sushi flavors. We have ate sushi from many different sushi places but Sin City Sushi is our favorite AYCE sushi (All you can eat) now! A must try sushi packed with flavor is the Vampire roll. There are many choices of sushi and food to be cooked but I couldnt get enough of the Unagi (eel) roll and the Vampire roll only. Also the poke and salmon collar was great as well. Lunch 22.95 Dinner 25.95. A sushi place to try out.,29DWe8SD_RCeZ_A6ihxnhQ,4,4,5,VvZJ4aQJViY_yaSqeNd0WQ

But alas, I am trying hard not to direct business away from business. Sin City Sushi is located in the corner of the ""Wal-Mart-Strip-Mall"" 
Ample parking, bright lights, and a Rubio's right next door!

While the sushi was on par with other places I have tried, the service became the nail in the coffin for my decision to ever return. 

The AYCE is fairly priced, but when we only got to order once the entire 45 minutes and were not checked on nor could we flag down the hostess/server/cashier (2 woman for a pretty decent sized restaurant) I was a bit irritated. 

Sure, if you're in the area and don't mind sitting at the bar where I'm sure the chefs will take great care of you",ANLSKvFmCgRMjxtELq70FQ,3,1,2,znasVcQuNCQYRMJBn2obzw

5938513,2013-08-25,0,nuRLQaPYbH6raFgSv-C_8g,"Quality of food is on point and they have a good selection of different things to order. I did the AYCE sushi. I think it's worth it.
Was a little weary at first because when we walked in a couple was walking out and said, ""good luck getting service."" That's not a good first sign. We still took our chances and I'm glad we did. 
This place seems to be family owned and operated for the most part. Drink orders were taken and brought right away. The food was a little slow to come out so I kind of see where the other couple was coming from. They had oyster shooters which were really good. It was surprising to see on the menu. I tend to just order a lot of nigiri. The fish was good quality and cold like it's supposed to be. Good portion of rice so I wasn't getting full just on that. Waitresses were nice, but you would kinda have to wave them down if you needed something.
Overall even though the service might be a little off I would still come for the food.",86C1YwgebXpzpM4ot2ICaw,0,0,4,VqnoQjDLlnQZj6JF4YeLvQ

You order from the menu so it's made to order, which means FRESH!!! We ordered baked mussels, fried soft shell crab, seafood salad, cucumber salad, fried tofu, edamame, cut rolls and nigiri. AYCE dinner is approximately $25 per person, this includes dessert. The server checked in on us constantly to see if we wanted anything else.

5950147,2015-01-25,1,nuRLQaPYbH6raFgSv-C_8g,"This place needs to learn some customer service or hire enough waitresses to put up with the demand. I stood for 10 minutes without being as much as acknowledged, same for the couple next to me who had been there before I arrived. There were two seats at the bar, that couple could've been sat down.

As for us, we had a party of 5 and expected to wait but without being acknowledged what is the point? 
The two waitresses walked around helping customers, they were obviously busy which I under stand but really how hard is it to say ""hi, I will be right with you""?

We arrived and were seated promptly. I recognized a few of the staff from my the now defunct Kai Sushi from a few years ago. We decided to order a few rolls to share and then I was able to get a little bit of nigiri to try as well. I don't normally order many rolls when I go to AYCE sushi places, but was trying to accommodating. The food came out pretty quickly and everything was pretty good. Some of the rolls we ordered were a little over sauced, but everything was solid and the flavors were really great. My favorites were probably the salmon skin handroll, mussels and nigiri. 

Service was friendly and very quick. Definitely a plus when you have a limited time for lunch. I look forward to coming back really soon and trying out more of their nigiri and hot dishes from the AYCE menu.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,5,4,4,5nHW7MSHCwk-rH9B4gcVpA
