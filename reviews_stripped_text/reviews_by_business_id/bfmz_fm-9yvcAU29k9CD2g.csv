The strawberry sensation is my fave and I would highly recommend if you are a cheesecake or strawberry fan. I love how you don't need a fork and spoon to eat it, you just squeeze and eat it like a burrito! Unlike most places their crepe is thick enough so that the ice cream and goodies inside don't make it all soggy and messy. They also have board games to play which makes for a fun experience too. The only down is that they don't have all the same thrifty flavored ice cream as the Henderson location since they aren't allowed to compete with the neighboring Perfect Scoop.",lzr7VA0h_YTYEY-mkK1eZg,0,0,4,SYGm8JELEsQ2AJ9mLK4yxA

I used to go to the original location in Henderson but it was so far that it was something I could get only once every few months, if that. Now that it's closer, it's great that the Westside can now enjoy it more frequently without the trek over to Henderson. 

I normally order the Rebel Special with green tea but was a little disappointed to find out that there's only vanilla, chocolate and strawberry ice cream and not the array of ice cream that is available at the other location. That and the fact that I think that the Rebel Special at this location is a slightly flavorless because the Nutella is added on top and not inside the crepe like the other location. These are the reason for the 4 stars.

Aside from the sauce issue, it's pretty much the same. Today I tried the banana cheesecake with Nutella instead of the white chocolate sauce and it was SCRUMPTIOUS! It's going to be fun going back to try new flavors now that it's so close to home. I've also tried the macarons and they aren't too bad either.

They have a huge variety of crepes, different types of ice cream and different fruits that you can mix and match. You can also make your own crepes or waffles, add whichever toppings you want. The crepes and waffles are huge so if you don't eat much sweets or is not a huge fan of crepes, definitely plan on sharing one.

I really didn't have time to check out the menu in detail. The staff was so helpful and friendly, They went out of their way to help us choose the right dessert. I ended up getting the Maui fever, shredded coconut, Kiwi, strawberry and pineapple with vanilla ice cream. It was absolutely delicious.

4801755,2016-10-02,0,bfmz_fm-9yvcAU29k9CD2g,"Great dessert place to go to if you have a real sweet tooth. I think they only serve crepes here which is like a thin pan cake like with whatever toppings you desire wrapped into a cone.

There is a lot of different combos to choose from and you could also customize your own. They have a huge wall with the names of the types of crepes you could order but wish it described what toppings were inside. They have a menu on the cashier table where it described in detail of what each crepe contained.

I forgot what mine was called but I ordered a banana, peanut butter, nutella and green tea ice cream. They are all freshly made right in front of you and the process seems simple.

Presentation was beautiful. It all tasted extraordinary delicious and was kinda sad when I finished it because I wanted more.

Great crepe shack to go to for some yummy dessert. Will definitely be coming back soon!",39FT2Ui8KUXwmUt6hnwy-g,1,1,4,wOH6YeNMqDgatxj0VRD2GA

This is exactly what I got at Crepe Shack and ohhhh my goodness. I got the cookie monster without the Oreos (so everything is completely customizable), but they have a ton to choose from when any combination you can think of from their menu. My wife got the Banana Cheese Pie, also super delicious and they were both a good size. The staff was very friendly and helpful. It was our first time there and he took the time to go through everything and explain how it worked. We were greeted both coming and out. Wait time was less than 5 minutes for our crepes.

This location is sort of tucked away. It's fairly new so I don't recall seeing it on a plaza board. It's near Hobby Lobby, but tucked away in the same lot as a Curry Leaf and Good Fella. *I had to drive around the lot for a few minutes trying to locate it myself.

Now, the space is a LOT smaller than the Henderson location. It's not nearly as modern and they don't have a selection of game boards available (not yet anyway), but the menu is the same. It's plastered on a big black board behind them, but there's also menus on pamphlets if you prefer those.

I went with my go-to order which is the Rebel Special. I switched it up this time and got chocolate ice cream instead of vanilla. *I'm such a dare devil, I know!* Same great taste, just a different location is all that I can say.

People might be disappointed in the lack of size this place offers, but.. I'm going for what really matters - the crepes. I'm sure in time this place will become up to date just like the Henderson location. Until then... Just enjoy their amazing crepes.

I'll be back for sure.",VhkjxxBz-A4M-mMncpn1ZA,15,12,5,aeindzStQMp4Q7q5fJLsxA

So I go in and order the strawberry crepe that has the cheesecake in it, some type of chocolate dessert, and cheesecake dessert that's in the display case. I told the guy I did not want any strawberry sauce in my crepe since I hate cheap strawberry sauce. Well what do you know my crepe had strawberry sauce in it and of course it was a cheap brand that was used! I am sure a business like this could skip the Hershey's strawberry sauce and could pay a little extra for something with a better quality. Now let's talk about the crepe itself... it was hard, thick (to the point that it was hard to cut), and had no flavor! The cheesecake had a hard white chocolate shell and the cheesecake tasted like it was rotten! I skipped trying the chocolate dessert since I was so disappointed.
