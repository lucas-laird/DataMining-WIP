Visited this weekend while a major game was playing, wanting to grab a pizza- Subway pizza is delicious, try one if you haven't already.

Employee was polite but incredibly slow. Between carrying on a conversation with his coworker and staring at the game screen, the guy barely had the capacity left to focus on making my order. It was simple, too.

Received it finally, hot and delicious. Only complaint is that veggies were not chopped up prior to adding to the pizza- other locations have cut them into smaller pieces, as for the salads, before baking, but not here. Giant pieces of pepper and onion tore up the cheese as I ate my individual pieces.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,0,0,2,HJ34bvDxtQsz4IieHX2IfQ

Came in here before going food shopping because it was pretty much on the same street. It is your typical Subway set up, nothing special. Our subs were made good, not sloppy; the staff was fast and efficient. No real complaints.",rypcWiSNGM0suWsiSLh9xA,2,2,3,g5m_ZuhILYHYcB4AURCdaA

3371666,2010-01-18,0,F_grYTnIPE1_Wwlfvt0J4Q,The sandwiches had a lot less greens and vegetables than I'm used to at Subways I've frequently eaten at in California. Also didn't have any avocado... Overall the sandwiches were of much poorer quality than I've come to expect from Subway.,m6H6RIgGpJk8xCwnOrJbig,0,0,2,HZPXCWY0Apm689Bp5I808w

Probably the freshest meatballs I've ever gotten. Then I noticed here instantly restocking what had been used. This restaurant is fortunate to have hired a polite, hard-working like Carmen. 
 

Thank you for the pleasant lunch!",NPKHkoZsVJYUK_78uJuJBg,0,0,5,l1x5EvNMTyNn8_Mcdl6a3w
