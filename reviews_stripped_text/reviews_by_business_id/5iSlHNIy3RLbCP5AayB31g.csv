As soon as we walked up to the door, we saw they had happy hour until 7PM so we decided to sit at the bar and enjoy a drink or two as well. The host was so welcoming when we came in and kept a smile on his face. The bartender was very nice as well and helped us almost right away. I decided to order the $12.99 deal with half a rack of ribs and my boyfriend ordered a burger. Food came out within 10-12 minutes, in the meanwhile I enjoyed a $3 margarita and he enjoyed a $2 beer. While sitting at the bar, you can see the kitchen. I noticed that the cook had a good 12 inch braid with no hairnet on which made me feel quite grossed out at all of the possibilities. Additionally, we were charged for full price beers even though we arrived and ordered around 6:18 per the receipt. 

Food was good but it I ever come again it will be based solely on the fact that customer service was good and it is a better alternative to Applebee's.",d-iDP50UnoiE6QuXNz-lmg,0,0,3,Vbv7sOcJC2SgGz2rGN0x_w

The staff was horrible we asked for a manager and they didn't even come to our table and see what went wrong.  Me and my husband didn't even want the salad bar it was so gross.

The Chicken Parmesan Pasta was too cheesy (it has never been THAT cheesy) and didn't have enough pasta sauce. The chicken on the pasta was very hard and dry on the outside.

961143,2015-04-12,0,5iSlHNIy3RLbCP5AayB31g,"One of the worst meals I've had in a really long time.
My wife and I had decided to try Ruby Tuesday's since we were looking for something different rather than the typical fast food restaurants there are around here. When we arrived the hostess sat us right behind the booth that the waiters use to ring up their orders, when there were plenty of other booths to choose from. We had to ask waitress if it was OK to move, which she obligingly moved us to another booth. 

We then ordered our some strawberry lemonade's and they were absolutely disgusting. They tasted like pure concentrated crystal light with liquid sugar added in. We sent them back and got the wild berry iced tea, and they weren't any better but we didn't want to send them back again. 

Our appetizers came in about 20 minutes later and they looked like they had been sitting under a hot lamp the entire time. I would understand if the restaurant was slammed with customers but there were only about 5 tables seated at the time. Our entrees followed about another 20 minutes later and the food looked disgusting. The ribs we ordered looked like they had been boiled and then just dabbed some BBQ sauce on top. The only thing that tasted good were the fries. The spaghetti squash tasted like old hash browns and I couldn't take it anymore.

We decided to order dessert to take the taste out of our mouths, so we decided to order the chocolate cake and tiramisu. You could tell they had just taken the cake out of the fridge, drizzled some chocolate sauce and powdered sugar on top and called it good. The tiramisu was even worse and tasted old. 

All in all, we got stomach cramps from the food and wasted $58 dollars on a meal that should have been served with pepto bismol and a disclaimer.

Then why come to the only remaining Ruby Tuesday's in Las Vegas? It was purely to spend time with a friend who likes chains and I will not hold that against her. My friend remembered when we arrived my avoidance of big chains and said ""I forgot. You are not into big chain restaurants."" Great, thanks friend! It was ok, I was there for the company.

I ordered the Coastal Mojito for my starting cocktail. I think the word cocktail is stretching it a bit as well as the word, mojito. For a time, the mojito was my go to drink. Ruby Tuesday's version of a mojito was more of a ""Get Out"" than a ""Go To"". It was very sweet and did not have the same qualities as your normal mojito. NEXT!

My friend and I decided on the salad bar, that seemed safe enough. The salad bar was mediocre at best. It was just your average run of the mill,
low cost produce setup in a bar. I just chose what seemed appetizing and threw on dressing. I did take it up a notch and pay extra for the add-ons of the salmon and chicken. It costs more but it did add a bit of normalcy to my lunch. Both the salmon and chicken were ok, it tasted like salmon and chicken. No real bragging rights. NEXT!

I still kept trying and ordered the Cheese and Broccoli soup. NEXT!

That is all I can say about the last remaining Ruby Tuesday's in Las Vegas. It just confirms why I am not into many big chain restaurants that focusses on the price rather than the quality. There is a market for these big chains though. To each their own.",quDu_Z0-i9TCYvdHRnULEw,4,2,2,sGgrUtKeqGX1z3tkJisykw

I went on their website and joined the email club. They emailed me a 2 for 1 coupon(up to $10) right away.

1691139,2017-04-10,0,5iSlHNIy3RLbCP5AayB31g,"So I was craving for a really good salad a couple of days ago and of course a nice salad bar at Ruby Tuesday came into mind especially after hearing about their new 55 ingredient salad bar. So my husband and I came, got seated, and I searched for my usual  quesadilla and salad bar combo. 
After searching and not finding,  I asked the waitress about it. She informed me that they now have a NEW menu and the quesadillas are NO LONGER on the menu. So of course I was shocked and had a hard time knowing what else to get with my salad bar entrée. 
So I ended up just eating salad. 
Don't get me wrong, the salad bar was GREAT! They had every ingredient I would want on my salad EXCEPT diced turkey. They have diced ham, but that's not my preference. Other than that, it was delicious. I even went back up for a second plate. 
So the salad bar was worth it in the long run. But towards the end of dinner I did request that the  quesadilla entrée be returned and that an addition of diced turkey be added to the salad bar.

The only things I might have a problem with is, The prices are a little on the higher side as You get a burger and it costs about $12, and you only get to choose 1 side, so when you get your plate it looks kind of bare.  And I like Salads so I picked the ""Salad bar""  On the commercials it looks like its 15 feet long with everything.  But in fact it has less then the bare minimum for a Salad bar.  Just lettuce, about 6 toppings and 5 dressings.  I mean when I want a salad, I want enough choices that I could make a cobb salad of sort, not just lettuce and dressing.

I walked out feeling the most satisfied from a restaurant experience in a long time...  There was another gentleman complimenting the experience he had with the hostess also when we left....

Last time I went to Ruby Tuesday my family and I had a great experience, so this time we decided to come and enjoy ourselves again. 

This time, was not as great. My waitress was nice, gave us refills, and was nice to my kids got everyone's order right but mine. I ordered the chicken strips meal (the small portion, which comes with four pieces of chicken and a side of fries.) I added a salad bar, which was yummy, but then when my food came I was missing my side of fries. She said that she substituted out my side of the fries for the salad bar, which is something I never agreed to. She said she could bring me an order of fries for an additional cost! What? lol. I said I was fine, at this point I just wanted to eat my tiny four pieces of chicken that I paid ten dollars for, so whatever. 
But, when I got my check I was surprised to see that she had not substituted out but instead charged me 1.99 for the salad bar. Now look, I know at some places the salad bar is extra, but you cannot tell me that you switched out my side of fries for a salad bar and then charge me for it. That is not a sub, that is an add on. 

So in total for my four tiny pieces of chicken I paid 9.99 and then an additional 1.99. and that is not including my 3 dollars for my drink as well. I basically paid roughly 15 dollars and was missing the fries that it automatically is supposed to come with. And she would have charged me for the fries that I was supposed to get. To put this into perspective my husband got a full steak meal with two sides and only paid a couple of bucks more then me. 

I already sent my email info to corporate, I actually really liked my server, but I feel she needs to listen better and then don't assume that someone wants something a certain way when you didn't even ask them. 

My whole check for a family of five was 67 dollars, not including the 7 dollar tip I left (I usually leave at least 10-15, but not this time)  The value was definitely not worth it. I will not be coming back.",v281gE-nk3jozr_5hWFAug,1,0,2,cgOo_5JDs8Mv8psDhwfEpg

The food wasn't great, and even with a free bday burger coupon, and free app coupon (which they graciously allowed us to stack), the total still was about $15 pre tip, although the service was really good.

This place is just like Red Robin. I wasn't really impressed with RR's burgers either, and RT's was on the same level. I just expect more for $10+ burgers. The bday coupon is for ""any burger up to $9"" though no burger is $9. They are $9.50 to $12. Thankfully you can just pay the difference. I got the bacon cheeseburger. Kind of dry, not very flavorful. We also got a chicken sandwich, and while I usually don't care for chicken, it was actually very tender and I liked it better than the burger. For our app we got the shrimp fondue, which was sooooo fattening, but it was good, though a bit on the salty side. They also offer small cheese biscuits on the house. I was hoping for Red Lobster cheddar bay biscuits, but these were much more dry and kind of sour for some reason.

Bf said the men's room was filthy, but the ladies room was fine.

I'm new to the area and although Vegas is known for being a service town, it doesn't always happen once you get off the strip. I've experienced it far too often in the few months since we moved here. In both high end places and middle of the road places like this. 

That is why when I come across amazing service, I like to acknowledge it. 

I ordered food 20 minutes before they closed. I had to call since if you try to order online at that time, you can't. I arrived about 7 minutes before close and instead of being nasty, they were welcoming. They instructed me to go to the bar to pay and pick up my food. When I arrived there, the bartender Ashley took care of me. To say she was sweet is an understatement. She was the perfect hostess. When I informed her that it was my birthday and my son's birthday this week, she offered me a sundae!

We arrived late on a weekday night, so there weren't many people there. We sat at the empty bar to watch TV and keep the bartender from falling asleep. The thing I remembered most about Ruby Tuesday's was their salad bar that  you could add as a side to any entree and when I walked in I was glad to see that was still the case.

I've always liked their burgers and decided to try the turkey burger this time with the salad bar option for an additional $2.99. The salad bar was clean and everything looked and tasted fresh. Since there were only a handful of tables being occupied, our food came pretty quickly. I was barely half way through with my salad when the entrees arrived. My turkey burger was extremely juicy and perfectly cooked. The only challenge was eating it along with my salad and fries.

The bartender was friendly and conversed with us the entire time (probably because he was bored). We asked if happy hour started at 9 PM and since it was 8:45 PM when we asked, he said we didn't have to wait and could order drinks if we wanted to. That was nice of him but happy hour prices are a measly $1 cheaper than the menu price! What a joke, no wonder nobody cares!

We took my grandparents out for dinner for my grandma's birthday and we asked another patron to close the blinds at the booth they were sitting at because the light was shining in our eyes. He rudely refused and we asked the bartender to please assist us. When he did so, the other patron became belligerent and complained to Ryan. While it is unfortunate that the other patron was so upset over a simple request, we felt that as patrons ourselves, we deserve some level of respect from the manager for the situation. While the other patron was reseated, we watched as Ryan visited their table multiple times but never once approached us to address the situation. He even helped serve food to our table and did not take the initiative to be a professional manager and apologize for the situation taking place. He had multiple other opportunities to do so and did not. We also overheard him verbally reprimanding our waitress for ""handling the situation poorly"" when in fact she and the bartender did the appropriate thing by reseating the other party and apologizing to us. 

After we paid our bill, I personally went to the manager to thank him for the excellent service we received from our waitress (Morgan) and the bartender and to give him one final opportunity to address the situation. When he still didn't say anything about it, I reached out to shake his hand and he refused to shake my hand. I am honestly so offended and disappointed by the treatment we received from the manager - the only thing that made our experience even the slightest bit better was the extraordinary service from our waitress and the bartender. As the only Ruby Tuesday's in Las Vegas, I hope Ryan reflects on his role as a manager and understands that he is responsible for EVERYONE'S experience, not just the individuals that complain.

We sat down and ordered some drinks, apps, and the meals. My boyfriend ordered one of their specialty drinks but it tasted like just juice, not good! They brought out a sample of their bread or something. It was a little dry. We ordered a sampler to start which wasn't bad but how do you mess up chicken fingers and onion rings. The food just didn't seem fresh. I was cold. Luckily I went for the salad bar which was actually the best part to me. I got to make it the way I like and add whatever I wanted and go back if needed. They had cucumbers and cheese and crutons and all kinda of dressing. We got our meals soon after and I ordered a burger that just didn't taste right. I couldn't finish it. My boyfriend ordered the salmon and it was awful. He asked me to try it and I literally spit it out. I had a side of fries that were soggy and gross. It was just overall a really bad experience.

We asked for a manager and the waitress brought mayonnaise saying she thought we asked for mayo. Kitchen manager finally comes politely stated she isn't the floor manager. 

She doesn't have an excuse but she will take care of our food if we wanted. So we took the opportunity to leave since we said we were just about to leave anyway. 

She offered to at least pack the kids food. I declined after she stated my kids could of just went to the salad bar because the the plates are readily available which no one communicated.

Atmosphere: Nice and quiet
Upon entering the establishment, the lighting compliments the red-color surroundings. The restaurant is clean and easy to maneuver. 

Service: Pretty good!
My party of three was seated right away and were asked for our beverages right away. The waitress was nice and polite to us. We were served our food in a reasonably quick fashion. 

Food: Good moments, bad moments
The food served to us was both the best and worst part of my dining experience here. We enjoyed the Appetizer Sampler, which was pretty good.  The fries and mozzarella sticks were my personal favorites.

I had the chicken with crab cakes, onion rings, and zucchini. The chicken was ok, but it was too buttery. The crab cakes had a strong crab taste to them. Yes, they're called ""crab"" cakes, but I didn't taste much of the ""cake"" part. I also ordered a side of zucchini, but the zucchini I was served was thinly sliced, oily pieces of zucchini. That didn't look to appetizing, actually.

For dessert, I shared the cheesecake sundae with my friends. I was not as great as it looked. I thought that since it was a ""sundae"", it would all be cold. It was an unpleasant surprise to know that the cheesecake part was warm. This made the consumption process a little difficult since the sundae kept melting on me. Still tasted like strawberry, cheesecake, and ice cream, but with varying temperatures and textures (Weird, huh?).

Overall: Would visit once in a blue moon
I really like this place the first time I went here about 2-3 years ago, but I guess the quality of the food had waned since then. I won't stop anyone from visiting this place. It's by no means a horrible place, but definitely weigh out your options.

3163894,2009-05-01,2,5iSlHNIy3RLbCP5AayB31g,"Ever seen one of those commercials TV of a restaurant that exists nowhere near where you live? Enter Ruby Tuesday. As a Bay Area resident, I have seen repeats of their commercials on many occasions, especially the one about revamping their image (something about a lamp?). At least I think thats what was one of the commercials. 

Anyway, I went to Vegas this past weekend and crashed at a friend's house in the area. Granted the house was half an hour away from the Strip, there was one night where we didn't want to drive all the way there, and so when we discovered this place, it was a no-brainer to try it. 

This particular location was rather empty on a Sunday night, but then again its not a heavily populated area. There's a salad bar right when you walk in, and silly me I thought it was free. As a carnivore I tend to ignore salad bars, but if that's your thing, add that onto your tab. 

I ordered the Brewmaster burger. Remember, if you order any burger, it comes with unlimited fries. It's like T.G.I. Friday's and Red Robin had a child and bore Ruby Tuesday! They even have some decent strawberry lemonade, with real strawberries. The burger itself, was pretty delicious, and the wheat bun is also a plus. It wasn't drenched in BBQ sauce, and you could taste the hint of beer in the meat. 

Another reason why I like this place is.... Leinenkugel's Sunset Wheat on tap! You know I had to get it. Suddenly, Yard House isn't the only franchised place to find this. By the way, if anyone knows where else they carry it in the Bay, please shed some light. 

Our waitress was awesome and very attentive, but then again there weren't too many people eating there. What's even more awesome, the bill was split per person and how much food they ordered. Basically, the overall receipt showed how much each person needed to pay. No need for separated checks or the need to write down how much to charge to each card! 

I bet you if this franchise was more common in the Bay, I'd give a lower score. Then again its not. Eating a pretty good burger with unlimited fries, enjoying a brewski, and watching the NBA playoffs with some good friends is a wonderful experience. 

I still hate this place for showing commercials when they don't have any locations nearby.",cVHGXQFo2roQGH0wvZeWHA,2,2,5,7ilYUcKBQH2fBH0xTg0lvg

I love the peach iced tea.  I sit in the bar area, and the service is always excellent.  The salad bar is clean and they fill it regularly.  The food does not always come out the way you would want (raw fish, or missing some part of the meal), but if I tell them, they are very apologetic and make sure that it is right.  

For lunch (and dinner) they have reasonably-priced combos - two sliders, fries (or a side) and the salad bar.  You can also get a piece of meat (such as chicken or fish) with a side (say, mashed potatoes) and the salad bar.  The salad bar is unlimited, so you can fill up on the good stuff. 

My experience may be different because I go at least once a week.  I need to unwind, and I can sit there, drink tea, eat, read, watch TV, or play games on my cellphone without a lot of interruptions.  I would give them 5 stars, but problems with the food stop me from doing that.  I had to send back grilled chicken a couple of times because the sauce was too heavy or there was just too much seasoning(too spicy for grilled chicken).  The last hamburger that I had was very ""grissly"", and it was supposed to be a bacon cheeseburger, but they forgot the bacon.  Once, I got raw salmon. They fix the problem, and the cook usually says ""oops!""  I admit that the quality of the food could be improved.

They were everywhere in Florida so when I moved here I was a little disappointed that they did not have one close to where I live.  I live in the Southwest area so it is a drive for me and my husband to go to the north side of town.  We had a coupon so why not right?

This was our second trip there.  We were seated immediately which was great.  I noticed that the place wasn't even busy so I thought great we don't have to wait long for our food.  My husband and I waited a while for someone to ask us for our drinks.  I noticed around that there were a lot of servers cleaning the tables so I was a little confused why it took so long for someone to get to us.  Someone finally came and took our drink.  My husband and I always get the New Orleans seafood.  

We got our food and I have to admit it was so good.  I loved it.  I can't complain.  If that is one thing that annoys me is if my drink is not filled.  I am usually patient when it comes to servers because I know that they are busy, however this place was not busy at all.  Our server came to check on us once and did not even bother to get us a refill.  I noticed that our server actually went to another table and was having a chat with them while my husband and I were sitting waiting for our drinks to get refilled which is a good 10 minutes.  I ended up having to get someone else to get our drinks.  

We finished our food at this point after we finished our drinks.  We were still waiting for her to even give us our check which by the way she never came to give us.  She never did.  We both had to get up and find someone so we can pay our bill.  I mean this is ridiculous.  We should never have to wait for them.  We are giving these people our business.  

So pretty much we drove 30 miles for us to get bad service with good food.  I was wondering whether or not I do want to come back because the service was just that horrible.  I am glad that other people had a great experience, but we didn't.",PYlSKW6t_SHMxd2N-kWcBA,4,1,2,BvXpshFqt_60C5ZbwenJ5w

-Triple prime burger HAS to be ordered medium rare or rare.  The taste of the meat is way off if cooked more than medium rare.  Send the bitch back if you have to.  Juice should be dripping out of this bad boy.
-get the fire wings hot
-try their flavored teas. Peach tea is my favorite. Their mixed drinks are also very well made,
Almost everything I have ordered from this restaurant was good, if not great.  I had my burger cooked medium and politely sent it back for a medium rare, and yes, the difference from medium rare to medium really does have an effect on the taste.

I remember we'd always get the same things: broccoli and cheese soup, loads of the queso dip with chips and my favorite, Sonora chicken pasta (because the sauce tastes the same as the queso dip). My sis and I were just talking about it tonight and will swing by next week, even though it is 30 min out of our way. I want to stuff my face with the queso and the pasta.

We shared the Boston Blue Burger and the Avocado Turkey Burger, and both were very, very good. They seriously don't skimp on ingredients either, and the wheat bun just made everything better. It's amazing how you can stuff two people for under 10 bucks. They have unlimited tasty fries too, but man...you have to be able to eat a lot to need refills. The full salad bar for just $2.99 was very tempting as well, but I knew I couldn't put all that in me. Although maybe the better idea would've been to get the salad bar and doggie bag some burger.... We tried the Ruby T, which is supposed to be pomegranate juice with iced tea, but it tasted more like plain iced tea than anything else.

I like Ruby Tuesday if for no other reason than the salad bar. Its tasty and has a decent selection. 
Came here with my pops on a random wednesday night outing and was pleasantly surprised. I hadn't been to RT in several years so i was delighted when I noticed they had seafood gumbo on their menu. 
Now don't get me wrong here, It ain't the Oyster bar but its still some damn good gumbo. It had shrimp, chicken, and sausage (they said anduille but im not convinced) despite that I was still pleasantly surprised. If they worked on their gumbo to rice ratio (2:1 NOT 1:1) it would be spot on for a nice, inexpensive, bowl of tastiness.

So, I am on a diet.  Annoying!  But they have some great options on their menu that state the calorie count.  I ordered the Creole Catch, which is labeled as having 335 calories.  Wow!  It was really tasty.  Husband had a bacon cheeseburger and the kidlings had pasta and fried shrimp, respectively.  The salad bar was pretty impressive.  

They bring those little cheese knot biscuits to the table.  They looked yummy and disappeared from the table, but I didn't want to even think about the calorie count in that!

4014424,2013-04-17,0,5iSlHNIy3RLbCP5AayB31g,"Ah...not my favorite place for eats.  Honestly, main reason we went there for date night dinner was because I had a coupon for 25% off our meal!  Yes, cheap date.

The one and ONLY Ruby Tuesday in the entire Las Vegas is on Craig Rd., thankfully this is closer to my side of town.  Unthankfully, that means, yes, this Ruby Tuesday is VERY close to the piggie farm!  Ugh, if the smell of leftover slop doesn't make you hungry...I don't know what does, ha ha!  So just be aware that if you come to Ruby Tuesday here, that funky smell outside is probably not from the restaurant, but from the stench of the leftover buffet that awaits some happy pigs.  Pigs which will later, in a round of great irony, be part of a buffet.  Oh the Circle of Life...

I should have been wary once we entered Ruby Tuesday that even with this coupon floating, and on a Friday night, this place was pretty much empty.  There were open tables everywhere!  But only a small handful taken with smaller parties of 2-4 people.  It was quiet...you could almost hear the sound of an owl hooing, and the brush of a tumbleweed passing by.  However, I was determined to use my 25% off coupon!  I sucked it up, placed my eating gun in the holster, put on my @$$less chaps, and tipped my cowboy hat to prepare for the ensuing dinner shootout.

Our server was pleasant, and quick to the draw for drinks.  For some reason, she KNEW I had that darn coupon on me.  Either she's good, or she knows that her Ruby Tuesday was only busy when these coupons came out.  Bad, bad sign.  I should have high-tailed it out of there and rode out into the sunset.  My stubbornness persisted as I ventured into the menu.

Being a chain, Ruby Tuesday encompasses just about all the types of food you see on a typical chain menu.  Burgers, fries, steaks, chicken, sandwiches, wraps, sliders, salads, some seafood, desserts, and a kids menu.  They do have some special items for a brunch menu, as well as a 'Chef Inspired' menu to showcase what they do different.  A GOURMET Ruby Tuesday if you will.  

If I had tons of money like some of you YELPERS who get to eat at a steakhouse on The Strip once a week, I would probably be doing that too.  I'm middle-class (BIG PIMPIN'...SPENDIN' CHEESE), so luckily my niche is around cheap eats or places that give you the best bang for your buck.  For many of us, that buck is getting smaller!  I will just wait until Yelp offers me some extra moolah and a side job as their goodwill ambassador to dine if finer establishments.

With most of Ruby Tuesday's entrees, you get a choice of two sides to go with your main.  I chose the 'Chef Inspired' Caribbean Chicken, rubbed with jerk seasoning and topped with mango salsa.  I chose a side of Creamy Mashed Cauliflower.  My date for the evening chose Louisiana Fried Shrimp, with cajun spice breading, and a spicy chile sauce for dipping.  She chose a side of onion rings.

For our other side dish, we both chose the Ruby Tuesday salad bar!  Yes, it was the other main reason why I drove down there for dinner.  I love a good salad bar that comes with a meal.  It's almost like having another entree if you build your salad right!  As I like it, more bang for the buck.  This salad bar wasn't half bad either.  All the produce was fresh and crisp.  I made myself two FATTY salads before our entrees arrived!  Surprisingly enough, their bleu cheese dressing was pretty killer.  Chunks of bleu cheese galore, I was game.

The salad bar, unfortunately, was the highlight of the night.  Our entrees?  Not so much.  They were really kinda bland.  Very BLEH.  I wasn't impressed by my 'Chef Inspired' Carribbean Chicken.  The portion wasn't the greatest, two tiny breasts!  I don't mind tiny breasts...but these ones just had no substance to them.  The jerk seasoning on them wasn't salty enough, there was more heat from pepper than anything.  They were cooked ok (kinda hard to mess up a chicken breast), but the mango salsa on the chicken didn't bring much to the party either.  I could have easily made this dish with a better salsa at home.  The Creamy Mashed Cauliflower was ok, but again it wasn't seasoned well enough so they were bland.  

My lady's Louisiana Fried Shrimp failed to impress.  The breading was way too heavy, and they were overcooked.  Golden brown crispy was not so.  This bordered on dark caramel, a sign of too done!  Funny enough, these shrimp were OVER seasoned...too much salt and spice.  The spicy chile sauce for dipping didn't help since when you used it for the shrimp, everything was just overpowered by heat.  Killed the taste of the little overcooked shrimp inside.  Her side of onion rings were ok, nothing worth noting except these were better to dip with the spicy chile sauce.

Not too impressed Ruby Tuesday.  Of course you are a chain so I guess that puts you par for the course.  Even with the amount I spent for dinner after coupon, I could have gotten a better meal at a number of other places.

The food was tasty and the salad bar was well-equipped but the cost was higher than I like for a lunch spot. Good value? Eh. I didn't feel like I was robbed but would have opted for a fancier place for that cost. Our server didn't bring us the complimentary bread until our meal was done and only after we hunted her down for it. She made an excuse about having tried to get us some earlier but there being none available. Would have been believable if we hadn't seen another server take some to the table right behind us.

I withhold a start for the fact that the salad bar has taken away some of the items I like.  There was no longer any pasta salad on the salad bar and they replaced the ham with what is basically diced luncheon meat.  It's not a large salad bar so a couple of changes make a big difference.  Still it's only $3 to add it to your meal so it's worth the money to add it.

I like the burgers, the steaks are OK, the seafood items are pretty good.  The coastal trio which consists of a lobster tail, shrimp on a skewer, and tilapia that can be prepared two ways - were all excellent.  The ribs were not bad, but not as good as you'd get at a real BBQ place.  The mac 'n cheese is excellent.  The children's menu is a little strange in that it's all a la carte.  I prefer a kids menu to include a drink and small desert as one package.  Prices are not bad, but I usually recommend waiting for a coupon to go there.

One, I love their salad bar.  It is always fresh and has some great topping and greens options.  I have to get the salad bar every time I come in.  

Two, I was disppointed after not having been in a while to see that their menu had changed drastically.  They used to be known for their burgers.  Today, some of the burgers are still there but not like they used to be.  For instance, I was impressed that they had a bison burger in the past.  Now, it is no where to be found.

Three, given the change to their menu, I have found other items to be quite satisfying.  I think I have tried something different each time I have gone in during my last few visits.  Most recently I tried the new spicy chicken tacos.  They were indeed spicy.  Not too overwhelming though.  It was enough spice to make its presence known in a big way.  Spicy grilled chicken, sauteed onion and bell pepper, cheese, cabbage and salsa in a soft flour tortilla was very good.  There were two on a plate.  

Those two tacos plus my self-assembled salad were satisfying enough on their own.  For some reason, though, I was unable to pass up dessert tonight.  The cheese cake was calling me.  So I answered the call.  I'm glad I did.  It was a thick cheese cake.  At least three inches tall and topped with raspberry sauce and crushed fresh berries.

Our waitress, while sweet as pie, looked like she'd just done the walk of shame. Her black shirt, front and sleeves, was *covered* in crusty, dried food, like she'd spent the day feeding toddlers. It was only NOON, and the place was empty, so this told me it was yesterday's shirt or one she pulled out of a pile on the floor. Her hair was just thrown up in a quick pony, the kind you do to wash your face or sneak out of someone's apartment the morning after.  The whole package wasn't very appetizing. It didn't say a fresh ""Good morning! Let me serve you edibles!""

She also forgot the biscuits that came with our brunch until we'd almost finished and I had to ask her for them. (Biscuits were tasty, though. Size of a half dollar and only two of them, but tasty. I assume we could have gotten more if we'd wanted them.)

Our meals started with a ""parfait"" of plain yogurt, blackberry puree  and granola. What it seemed like was plain yogurt, jam and a crushed up Nature Valley granola bar. But it wasn't bad. In fact, it was surprisingly good, but a bit too filling.  That's essentially a whole meal in itself.

We each got an omelet (their brunch menu is fairly limited) and the arrived hot and with ""homestyle potatoes"" which were basically cubed Ore-Ida out of the bag. They tasted ok, but were a little dry and served with a side of ketchup. 

But what wasn't dry was the butter/oil drenched omelet. It was so covered in grease the edge of the omelet were crispy and butter was pooling on top of the eggs.  Did it taste good?  Yes, it wasn't bad, but way, way, way too oily for me. WAY.  

We casually mentioned it to the manager who picked up our plates and asked how we liked everything.  She said they had a new ""spec"" that required them to brush the omelets with butter before sending them out to the table.  I could see where people would like that -- it's just not for me. I prefer a healthier omelet.

We left with mixed feelings. The food wasn't bad -- but we wished it'd not been as greasy and had a few more options on the brunch menu.  It was also a little on the pricey side for what you get, considering Vegas is full of amazing restaurants and buffets.

We were fairly turned off by the details, like our booth being dirty and our waitress so unkempt. That sort of killed it out of the gate, to the point that we almost just paid for the OJ and left.  Dirty doesn't inspire confidence.  If she'd been tidier and the booth cleaner, I'd say 3 stars with more pending other meals, but I don't think I'll be back now, unfortunately.",eH5cPO1SV9hTVktzenjYgw,4,1,2,fAZMH8SEyDHnouyU5_9LGA

4655081,2017-08-08,10,5iSlHNIy3RLbCP5AayB31g,"The Last Ruby Tuesday Standing in Las Vegas :

In anticipation of sharing the places and restaurants that I visited in Denver this past week on Yelp, this will be my last Las Vegas review for a few weeks. And speaking of ""last,"" this review is a recollection of my experience dining in the ""last"" Ruby Tuesday in Las Vegas. 

Unlike the famous 1967 Rolling Stones song that this chain is named after, Ruby Tuesday has lost popularity. As far as number of locations, the chain is a shadow of its former self. Just last year in 2016, Ruby Tuesday announced they were shutting 95 locations. It's a shame because when I was a teenager living on Long Island, Ruby Tuesday was a popular and growing chain offering good Americana food with the famous all you can eat salad bar. Ironically, when my hometown Ruby Tuesday came to Lake Grove, NY in the late 1990s it was a Red Robin that they replaced. In contrast to the dismal corporate developments that I mentioned in this paragraph, the last Ruby Tuesday standing in Las Vegas is an upbeat casual dining restaurant that may have you singing ""Ruby Tuesday."" 

A couple of Saturdays previous, my brother and I decided to dine here after hiking up in Mount Charleston. It had been a decade when I last had Ruby Tuesday back on Long Island. 

When I walked inside, right in front of me stood the all you can eat salad bar. Right in front of you will stand the all you can eat salad bar in one of the photographs below. The all you can eat salad bar is the centerpiece of one of the two rooms that make up the restaurant. When I looked to the left of the salad bar, there was a view of Craig Ranch Regional Park. When I looked to the right, the enthusiastic hostess greeted us to Ruby Tuesday faster than my eyes took in the salad bar. 

The neat aspect of the last Ruby Tuesday in Las Vegas is that it has a mom and pop vibe more than a cookie cutter chain restaurant vibe. It's as if Ruby Tuesday's cream of the crop represented the restaurant. If you were to look up ""friendly server"" in the encyclopedia Jessica. M would be an example. From the time we were seated to the time I left with ""Ruby Tuesday"" playing in my head, Jessica. M  provided outstanding service from topping off refills to volunteering expertise on food selections. For example, she let us know that Ruby Tuesday is known for their ribs and burgers. I'd heed her recommendation. If there were more servers with Jessica M's attitude, perhaps Ruby Tuesday would be opening 95 restaurants a year. 

We sat in the second of the two rooms. This dimly lit room overlooked the bar. In place of a view of Craig Ranch Regional Park was one of Professional sports on the TVs above. 

The vast menu offered pages of dining and drinking choices. Jessica M's recommendation simplified the decision making. I opted for the USDA Mushroom Swiss Burger with fries. I passed over the additional $3.99 all you can eat salad bar. My taste buds were agreeable to the burger. The thick burger tasted as if it just came off a barbecue grill. The complimentary ingredients including mushrooms, onions, lettuce, and mustard complimented the barbecue taste of the thick burger. Sharing the plate the fries tasted better than average. With a bottomless Coke that Jessica. M was quick to top off, the dining experience came out to $14.58 before the tip. 

After leaving Ruby Tuesday in the dawn, I could of been singing another Rolling Stones song called ""This Could Be the Last Time."" On account of the fact that this is the last Ruby Tuesday remaining in Las Vegas and that they are shutting down so many stores this could be my last time here. However, this shouldn't be the case. From my experience, this is a well managed restaurant with an attentive and enthusiastic server that delivered tasty Americana food to my table in an upbeat restaurant that left me with a good taste and good tune: ""Ruby Tuesday.""",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,19,16,4,mYtsi5gTdVinQk40g9Zfwg

She takes the bill and takes forever to come back only to say that they will take the chicken off but now charge me $9 for the side salad. Waited again.

4744355,2012-06-04,1,5iSlHNIy3RLbCP5AayB31g,"When it comes to lunch in North Las Vegas, there are a few things I try to do: Stay away from fast food.  Eat something reasonably healthy.  Keep lunch cheap.  Surprisingly, I've been able to do those things at Ruby Tuesday!

I've always sat at the bar during lunch and ordered an entree; I haven't done the salad bar.  While sitting at the bar, the bartender gave me a card that gets me $2 off my lunch at the bar if I pay with a card.  I've been ordering entrees from their petite lunch menu, which is a smaller (and cheaper!) serving than the regular dish.  Each petite lunch is $8-$9, so after that sweet $2 discount you're looking at a $6-$7 entree at a sit down restaurant!  It seems that nowadays you'll be spending that much for a combo meal at a fast food spot.

I've had the chicken lunch and the cajun fish lunch, and both are decent meals for the price point.  They come with a side of mashed potatoes and broccoli, and the portion is enough to keep you going until dinner time.  The fish has been overseasoned before, but it's not a regular thing.

It makes more sense if you really want salad and your really hungry.  And if your up for a large salad, ask your server for a large/square plate and avoid the standard tiny size plate.

4974439,2010-12-23,4,5iSlHNIy3RLbCP5AayB31g,"A day out with our 7.5 year old nephew and we tired him out!  It was a fun-filled day with his Uncle and Auntie in Vegas and we did it all - black light miniature golf at King Putt, Tater Tots with cheese (his favorite) from Sonic Drive-In, jumping around to pure exhaustion at Sky Zone Indoor Trampoline Park, a new shirt from Old Navy, and driving the cars at Las Vegas Mini Gran Prix Family Fun Center.

Now, we needed to end his day on a high note and where else could we get a good mac 'n cheese that would satisfy a kid's craving?

We're in luck - Ruby Tuesday offers just that and I had a coupon for BOGO free entree!  Sweet!

The Husband orders their Signature Item - the Classic Barbecue Baby Back Ribs (Half Rack) ""Our half-rack slow-cooked for hours then covered with our tangy barbecue sauce."" It comes with two Signature sides - he chose the Baked Potato and Baked Mac 'n Cheese ($1 extra).  Although one wishes for meat to be tender, he wished the meat didn't fall off so easily .  

I ordered one of their Signature Items - the Parmesan Shrimp Pasta ""Tender, spicy shrimp are seasoned and sautéed, then served over penne pasta in Parmesan cream sauce and accented with diced tomatoes."" which was creamy and heavy!  Generous portion! 

And of course, our nephew ordered from the Kids Menu (10 and under) -  Kids' Mac 'n Cheese Pasta, which came with your choice of beverage.  Being the great kid he is, he asked for milk with it!  The best part was when his order arrived, he asked if he could extra cheese.  I asked him from where and he mentioned that he saw shredded cheese over at the salad bar.  We asked the waitress and she brought over a little container of cheese for him and he was just so pleased!  As he devoured his favorite meal - he finished up his milk and asked for another!  (What a kid!)

Service was attentive and when our waitress was busy, another waitress would cover for her - they definitely work as a team there.

Be sure to ask for the Made-From-Scratch Garlic Cheese Biscuits - we had to ask for ours.",rt3PC7WCgCKsoufmQJELfw,5,5,4,D6c1fTnJ8eUTN4xIAiNW-Q

The ordering of the food was easy, and our waitress, Morgan, was very nice. We both ordered lemonade, which, for some reason, was carbonated and tasted horrible.  I couldn't stomach it.  We both ordered steak, one a New York, the other a petite sirloin with coconut shrimp.  The steaks were good and were cooked to our specification.  The shrimp was ok, as were the sides...zucchini, tomatoes with balsamic, and green beans.  I don't know if they left the food out before serving it, because it wasn't as hot as it should've been.  That's one reason I wasn't entirely impressed with the food.  Food doesn't taste the same when it's lukewarm and not hot off the grill.  The one good thing was the salad bar.  They have a good selection of options. 
We didn't order any dessert  so I can't speak on that. Our check came out to roughly $38.00, which wasn't bad EXCEPT our 2 lemonades came out to $7.00.  I'm sorry, but there is no way a glass of lemonade should be $3.50...especially when it tasted so badly.  
Overall, I can say I tried it out, but I don't see myself going back again.  For the price and quality, I'd rather stick with Applebee's or TGIF. At least the food is hot, and the lemonade tastes tart and refreshing.",sWIfYMexnUHb9UvroNSw-A,0,0,3,7kX9fN_j4jkZn4FrNB69SQ

The service was just so-so and the food was not very appealing.  First off, I ordered the Santa Fe Chicken Quesadilla/Salad Bar lunch Combo (which I usually order).  My salad bar plate was as expected.  My absolute favorite part about going to Ruby Tuesday is getting the croutons at the salad bar. They have the best croutons I've ever had and this time was no exception. The reason I think the croutons are the best is that they are crunchy on the outside and warm and soft on the inside. I should just fill up my plate with croutons and forgo the salad because nothing else is memorable.  Just unbeatable croutons!! 

When they brought out our table's orders, mine was the only one messed up,  they brought me some tacos. The server appologized for making the mistake and reordered my quesedilla. She kept on saying that it'll be right out (about 3 or 4 times), but it took 10-15 minutes. When I received the quesedillas it looked like they put a lot of stuff in there to make up for messing up the order, though the presentation of the food looked like it was just quickly thrown together (then why did it take so long?). There were tons of onions and lots of salsa and not very much chicken in it.  However even picking up the limp piece of the quesadilla it was not very good--plus most of the bottom side of the quesedillas was all soggy, even with my first bite. I wasn't very happy about this, but I didn't complain about it either.  Most everything about this visit was way below par (except for the croutons).

I ordered a rasberry iced tea but didnt really like it so instead i asked if I could get strawberry lemonade. She looked at me & said ""ill see what I can do"" really? I thought that was so rude I even asked if it was an extra charge that I'd gladly pay it. She ended up giving me the lemonade so idk why she made it a big deal to begin with. Im also a server at a cafe & I'd never treat any of my costumers like that specially over a drink. Thats ridiculous. I still left a good a tip for the other people who helped us. I really hope you have a talk with the servers.",fesmBxZyYQSElqWD11F4bQ,0,0,3,mXe6S5u-9nuKoYpeZkwnMg

The server we were given at first did not listen well at all.  My mother needed information about the nutritional facts of the food.  She is on a low potassium diet and he offered her a gluten free menu.  We explained that menu wouldn't help and he told us that he would send a manager over to give us the information.  A manager didn't come to the table.  He kept forgetting things that he said would be right back.  My final straw with him was when he dropped off the appetizers, but didn't bring any plates.  I went for the manager to let them know I needed a different server. At first I was informed that they each had their section and then I was told they would see what they could do.  We finally got a new server.  Unfortunately, the person that took our order seemed to have things messed up.  I had to send my meal back to correct it.  My mother's meal had to be sent as well because they over cooked her steak.  Don't give a large party to someone that can't handle it.  Our second server did her best to make up for the issues, but there was no redeeming the experience.  At the end, the only thing removed from the check was what we had a coupon for.  Another member in our party told the manager that because of the horrible experience something should have been done.  After that, the only thing removed was the appetizer that had to be sent back because it was freezing by the time we got the plates.  We ended up with 3 mothers in the party that did not enjoy their mother's day dinner, myself included.",26SE5Kfqh2669tKw3MHptA,0,0,1,y-g9x6YNM3YMOg9gf3eQ9w
5837931,2014-09-05,3,5iSlHNIy3RLbCP5AayB31g,"Things did not go as well on another visit with a different couple.  First of all, one of my favorites, the Asian Dumplings, having been cut from the menu, are no more.  And Mango for Mango Iced Tea has been replaced by a mango-flavored syrup which was not well received by two of my fellow diners.  A new app, Thai Phoon Shrimp is billed as tender and crispy shrimp tossed in a Sweet & Spicy Chile Sauce, but I and a table mate found the shrimp to be too heavily breaded, and the sauce too cloyingly sweet.

My Jambalaya Pasta, consisting of chicken, shrimp, and slices of Andouille Sausage mixed in a creamy sauce with linguine was hot and spicy but not that flavorful, and the sausage tasted like thin, spicy pieces of fried hot dog.  As usual, the make your own salad from the Salad Bar, this time with French Dressing, was excellent, although few spring greens were on hand to go with Iceberg Lettuce and spinach leaves.  Diane very much liked her Coastal Trio of sweet lobster, tilapia, and skewered shrimp.

Service was good, and booth seating comfortable.",s2o_JsABvrZVm_T03qrBUw,3,3,3,0Wr1kHAO21ltrFnZpHNosg
5847246,2017-09-19,0,5iSlHNIy3RLbCP5AayB31g,"I give their food of five out of five but their drinks were a two out of five - food outweighs drinks so I give them four stars. The service was amazing so I cannot complain but the drinks tasted nothing like what they were supposed to be. We ordered a salad bar (free birthday meal) and burger (free birthday meal) along with two peach Sangria's. Salad bar was amazingly fresh and had quite a few options for a basic salad. The burger was cooked perfect and came with any side so we got a caesar salad that was just as fresh and delicious as the salad bar. Now down to the drinks, we ordered peach sangria and they tasted like beer! That is the only way I can describe the taste I could not taste any fruit it  taste like a Bud Light with a splash of grenadine. To make matters worse once we told the waiter about it he walked away as if he spoke with someone but came back rather quickly. When he arrived back at the table he announced to us that he could not take the drinks back because his manager would not let him, my best friend asked if there were any other way that we can be compensated or maybe change the drinks and he advised her no. At the time we should have called corporate but we didn't know. I will not blame all Ruby Tuesdays but I will definitely say that the bar customer service needs development at this location.",BlpxUHM0gGKXsaOb7NSjcA,0,0,3,JXVQFw8m0MebHRIv1mAS9A
5863393,2015-02-27,0,5iSlHNIy3RLbCP5AayB31g,"Since we don't have Ruby Tuesday restaurants in So Cal--at least, not at the time this review is being written--going to a RT in Vegas was a MUST for me when the BF and I were in ""Sin City"" for a conference last spring. The nearest RT wasn't too far from where we were, and we ended up meeting two of our friends there for dinner on a Wednesday evening.
 
The restaurant was pretty busy when we arrived for dinner around 6 p.m., but the eatery itself wasn't hard to find (plenty of parking) and our party of four was seated right away. This restaurant location was right on par with all of the other RTs I have been to -- clean and the salad bar was sufficiently stocked. I was more than happy to enjoy those fresh croutons during this particular visit as well! Those are seriously my favorite croutons ever.
 
I made up for the fact that we don't have any Ruby Tuesdays in So Cal by overstuffing myself with that salad bar during the meal ... so much so that I didn't even have room for the limited-time peanut butter dessert they were featuring at the time! Though I was disappointed about the dessert, dinner was very, very good and satisfied my craving for those croutons. I think I made 2-3 trips to the salad bar just for them.
 
Here's what I got during this trip, as well as menu items I would recommend:

""Create Your Own Garden Bar"": I usually get the ""Garden Bar"" with my meal, and sometimes it's my only entrée. I love the assortment of toppings included in the salad bar and often make 2+ trips to get more. I usually get spinach salad, cheddar cheese, bacon bits, blue cheese crumbles (the chunks of blue cheese at this location are huge!), grapes, pasta salad (I love the pasta salad that's studded with ham and peas), cottage cheese, blue cheese dressing and, last but not least, the famous, crispy, spongy and salty brown croutons that I absolutely CRAVE. Those croutons alone make a trip to the Garden Bar worth it. This location did a GREAT job keeping everything in the Garden Bar section well stocked, and I really enjoyed the fresh basket of those croutons. 

""Southern Style Chicken Tender Dinner"": If I'm going to RT for dinner, I'd want to get this entrée one day. It features all white-meat chicken, dipped in the eatery's signature batter and fried to a crisp golden brown. The chicken tenders are served with fries and a side of honey mustard. I like the chicken tenders that are featured in the appetizer dish, so I know I would be more than happy with the chicken tender dinner. Definitely a good choice if you're in the mood for deep-fried, savory goodness for your next meal.

""Parmesan Chicken Pasta"": I don't usually order pasta from RT, but this entrée sounds delicious. It features Parmesan-crusted chicken breast over penne pasta tossed in Parmesan cream sauce, then finished with tomato-basil sauce and Swiss. I would ask for my pasta to be light on the tomato sauce, since I prefer cream sauce over anything tomatoey. But I'm sure the Parm-crusted chicken breast gives the entrée some extra cheesy flavor and the breaded crust provides welcomed texture and crunch. If any of these entrees come with a side, I would go for the onion rings or French fries ... and if I was really craving it, I would pay extra for the premium sides of baked mac 'n cheese or the loaded cheese grits. I don't remember the cheese grits being on the menu before, and I've tasted really good cheesy grits before, so I'm interested to see how this RT version compares.

""Buffalo Chicken Burger"": This is a step up from the Buffalo chicken sliders that I usually get. This burger features southern-style chicken breast tossed in spicy Buffalo sauce and is topped with melted Swiss cheese. All burgers come with tomatoes, pickles and mayo--and are served with fries--but if I got this burger, I would get it sans pickles and tomatoes. I already know I love that buffalo chicken, so if I'm super hungry and want more than those sliders, I would go for this bigger entrée.

""Bacon Cheese Pretzel Burger"": The pretzel burgers were a more recent addition to the RT menu, and I do love a good toasted and salted pretzel bun. This burger features applewood smoked bacon, melted cheddar cheese and bacon mustard mayonnaise. Great combo for a bacon lover like myself.

""Double Chocolate Cake"": I've never ordered dessert from RT before, but this sweet treat would be the first one I'd try. It features a chocolate cake with a molten chocolate center and is served with a scoop of creamy vanilla ice cream and strawberry sauce. I love the molten chocolate cake at Chili's so I'm sure I would like this version as well. I would ask for the strawberry sauce on the side, though -- don't want nothin' marring my perfect chocolate dessert!",q6xgj7izoqXoTOWE2QyS1w,2,3,4,deDa7--AuKg5xU1o2cD9zw
5883680,2017-04-30,0,5iSlHNIy3RLbCP5AayB31g,"I really love the salad bar, they keep it pretty well stocked, but don't order anything that requires them to cook vegetables, as they don't seem to know how to get that right. I had to send back multiple times my pasta primavera, and they still couldn't get it right. The vegetables were hot, but essentially still raw. They don't seem to understand the difference between cooked vegetables and hot vegetables.",hBlphHToHI3ayPw1Vy2n0A,2,0,3,kdVCsIqz9VORCvwgxe7MYw

Service was ok. Fairly speedy. But not super friendly, just again kind of...average.
One thing that irritated me was that the gluten free menu was only on their website.
I'm glad they have a gluten free menu at all! But it kind of defeats the purpose if it's on a website that doesn't really work all the time. I struggled getting it to load at all on my phone. 
I ordered the gf pasta and it was good!
Again, nothing spectacular. But good.",q8nS2KzwuClGzEY5ulcbiA,1,1,3,aZdttIx1U5fYRIoifoO6RQ

We were seated faster by the next staff member that walked up to check in kiosk.  Service was slow, one server for entire side of restaurant.  Food was not as described.  Husband ordered kale salad and got a Caesar salad.  Took an additional 20 minutes just to get our check.

Had a sirloin steak, cooked perfectly, medium rare, juicy, no veins or marbling at all!
Side of zucchini was good, a little garlic and lemon juice would have made them excellent!

Wait wasn't bad, service was good but a little slow at times.  Only comment is that the table was greasy and sticky by the window.  The manager said it was due to the heat but I think it was due to poor table maintenance.

Best value for the money.  Haven't found a deal like this in Southern Nevada since the mob left the casinos.

My kids were happy with their meals.  Son got a kids pasta was about 30 noodles my other son had an adult bacon cheese burger he liked it but his fries were also cold.  Husband's meal was all warm he had the smokey mt chicken with mashed and mac n cheese.  Probably won;t return for dinner but may stop in for salad bar and the mini burgers.,wUVrP0IB2jMRmvO5meDCfQ,0,0,2,09SWXlt-RNxEAaxflXCkBQ
