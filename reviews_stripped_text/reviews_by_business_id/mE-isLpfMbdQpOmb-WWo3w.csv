I bought an entertainment book as a donation to my childs school less than a month ago.  The coupons do not expire until November of 2012.  However, when I went inside the establishment they said they were not longer honoring the coupons.  How can they do that?

Pizza crust was a pre-made frozen mass produced type, sauce-  our pizza was drowning in it, cheese it was regular mozzarella not buffalo mozzarella which you normally find on a margarita pizza (that too was piled on) - so such sauce and cheese that the center of the pizza pie was raw - gross.
Chicken pesto sandwich - let's clarify the chicken was a chicken cold cut the type you find at major wholesale distributors not a chicken breast or cutlet.  The spinach dip was definitely poured straight out of a can.  Bottom line you're paying for restaurant  food and getting cafeteria food.

The item that really stood out for me was their potato pie pizza.  It is my new favorite type of pie.  It comes with thin sliced garlic potatoes, caramelized red onion, bacon bits, cheese and spinach (I got mine w/o spinach).  It was absolutely delicious!

My first thought was that the menu was rather small, and nothing looked too appealing.  It was happy hour so I decided to order a glass of sangria... Not a good choice.  It was watered down, very sweet and was not good in the least bit.  I ordered a panini because none of the pasta sounded appealing.  It was mediocre.  Definitely not worth an over priced 10 dollars.  It came with a side salas that consisted of a small slice of tomato, a thin slice of onion and a nice big handful of lettuce.  I have no interest in trying it again...

The place inside is all right and food is OK but ultimately I like their pizza. Its a good Cali style flat pizza with special ingredients. For example last night we got the Fig and Prosciutto pizza. It has Fig compote, prosciutto, gorgonzola, and fontina cheeses sprinkled with some fresh basil. Its thin crisp and good.

My wife had the Ravioli special, with a bolognese sauce. It was also good, but a bit small at the regular price of $16.95. Although it did come with an ok Caesar salad.

$2 bottle beers and only $5 for a nice size Italian Margarita helped get a star here. A Thirsty Tuesday and Thursdays special they run.

So to sum up, this place has good pizza and is worth coming with a coupon or with drink specials.",x16Fl_5h9aX4tn38kKSGHw,2,0,4,5icMSpi72uclt8NUiZxKBw

But sometimes you get the server who is tired, at the end of their shift, and couldn't care less about the last 2 hours of work. Throughout the meal, our server was friendly and attentive, and kudos to the great service!
We started with the mediterranean salad. The salad was huge, with a lot of olives (pitted), and artichokes, and they brought it out on split plates. It was very good, and came with some delicious bread. 
We also split a pesto chicken pizza. The pesto makes is a little oily, but it was exactly what we were craving.

I have been here before for Happy Hours and their pizzas were decent, but the stand out attraction is the Garlic Knots ($2.50 HH or $4 normal). These come in massive orders of a dozen or so and are very doughy which is a good thing and have enough garlic that it is not overwhelming. These same knots appeared during my lunch and were knocked out of the park as usual. The only issue is the marinara sauce is more watery and thin than normal, but get used to it because it's been that way for years. Keeping that in mind, I ordered pasta (penne) with their Rose sauce and threw in chicken and carmelized onions to round it out.  I wouould have preferred strips, rather than chunks of chicken, but that is just quibbling. The sauce was tasty and even had some kind of peppery kick as I drenched the remaining knots in the rose sauce. Lunchtime is when the prices are bit better, but noi matter when you order the knots you can't go wrong.

Therefore, I had to set aside my innate SF disdain for commercial eateries or otherwise I'd starve or be forced to cook at home.
And we can't have either happen. 

So I braved my fears and finally tried this cozy looking place in the middle of nowhere that serves pizza, panini, and pasta.

I'm saddened to say my initial trepidation was well founded: our food turned out to be very average.
The mozzarella in our Caprese Salad wasn't fresh, the cheese tortellini tasted like it came from Costco, and the pizza sauce was bland.

Their menu is just not too interesting. I know for a fact that their panini sandwiches always miss their mark. I've had it once before and hated it and my 2 co-workers had a similar experience today. The bread is too thin and a little weird. Seems like a cold sandwich except for the grill marks.

Today I had the rose cream sauce (marinara with alfredo i think) over a wheat penne (kudos for offering this) and I added mushrooms ($1.50 per addition of extras so I think that's way too expensive). The lunch portion of pasta was huge but it had like 4 mushrooms. The sauce was actually pretty good.

I had a half order of mozzarella salad and the pesto cream pasta with chicken. My bf had a half caesar salad and the bolognese pasta.  Along with that we shared a Weezitini (Vodka and chocolate liqueurs), which was actually very good. The mozzarella salad was good but a little plain and both pastas were extremely bland. We tried seasoning them both with tons of salt and pepper but it didn't change much. Not to mention they didn't add chicken to my pasta (which I asked for twice)!

I've stopped in during the day a few times, but I must agree with Dustin D - if you've not been here for karaoke, then you just haven't been.

First off - service is always great. The bartenders are friendly, get to know you if you show up regularly, and the servers are fast. The food itself is VERY good - their pizza is hot and very tasty, the sandwiches are delicious, and the pasta is fantastic.

On to the heart of the review - happy hour! They have great happy hour specials on drinks AND food. The garlic knots are the shiznaz! Friday night is ladies' night from 10pm to midnight and they do giveaways on Saturday night. TJ rocks the place with Karate Karaoke on the patio (weather permitting). They have heaters there if it gets chilly, so karaoke happens on the patio most weekends.

Simply put - if you've never been here or haven't been in a while, GO. If you're a karaoke nut like me, sign up with the dojo and get cool prizes while you're at it. You see a lot of the same people there on the weekends, so if you're looking to make some friends while you're having a good time (like I did) this is a great place to try it out.",glYwn0bUfowzSEujf4Tmcg,4,2,5,T07RdPJ_24RQ4IHYAymRXA

Stay away during a weeknight when they are probably only three people working to service about 20 tables plus a bar.",5fQ9P6kbQM_E0dx8DL6JWA,1,0,2,ibpQpP5JciR2ZO_UG5JWGg

And those are some very important elements when choosing a restaurant. It was a nice touch handing the kids a magnadoodle to play with when the are seated, but a big dissapointment to put the kids menu on the back and not tell us - even after we ordered for them!

Watered down drinks and pizza that I could barely swallow down, it was bad! How can you mess up BBQ chicken pizza??? I have no idea! I had one slice and I was done.  Also, the place was pretty empty at 6pm (should have been a clue right there - duh!), so to be placed at a table that couldn't accomodate the four of us, our drinks, and our food, is kind of sad. They should have placed us at a six top and let us spread out some instead of cramming us into a tiny booth which would have been better for a couple on a romantic date. Oh well, you live and learn - and the lesson today is to avoid this restaurant.",Zo2qav3-2dUMTxlitYFWLQ,1,0,1,89iltWJIRt_woNrmzQuzuA

DELICIOUS! wasnt too oily and just the right consistency of creaminess. my friend had the grilled pesto panini and she was pleased.. very surprising considering she doesnt like pesto too much!.. i havent had the tiramisu but i heard its superb here. i'll have to come back and try it! they have happy hour between 4-7 and lunch specials until 4pm. the lunch special is a good sized portion for 2/3 the price. i'm afraid to see the full order. 

this place gets 4 stars cuz it doesnt have a large variety of pizza or pasta. basic pastas with red, white or pesto sauce. nothing fancy. just fettucine, spaghetti, or angel hair pasta. extra dollar for tortellini. and the waiter checked on us every 3 minutes. it was very annoying. i mean i like to be checked on but it felt like we were beign harrassed. haha. couple times during the meal is great but i swear he came and asked us 7 times how we were doing. and when he was refilling my water he didnt ask if i wanted more he just stuck his arm in my face as i was trying to eat my pasta and said 'dont mean to reach!'... but he did.. and if i didnt move my head back he would have grabbed my nose. lol.. other than that i really like this place.. might be a little pricey if you dont get the lunch special. $11 for spinach artichoke dip? it cost more than my pasta (8.50)..",SssXdhbeYJOCF6sfSFwC-Q,4,4,4,3ul9RElg4ajXU2v4AjKA6A

When it's warmer out, it gets pretty busy since they do the karaoke on the patio.  It's a really good crowd of 20s and 30-somethings and most of the people who sing are pretty talented.  The bartenders have been pretty great each time we've gone.  The last time I was there we finally tried the garlic knots.  All I can say is Day-hey-hey-hey-HEY-YAM!  They are baked just golden and crispy on the outside and soft and buttery on the inside and then carefully smothered with butter and garlic salt.  Holy SHNIZZLE.  The best part, they were 3 friggin dollars!!  If I could live off those bad boys and not grow two chins, I'd do it in a hummingbird heart beat!!!!",LwVUO_5jjHuJRhvl6hlHVg,1,2,4,hwZF2smu_XHcw2-NBI5MgA

Went here Friday night for a charity type event that was packed, on the patio. Unfortunately, my friend and I were the youngest people there and the median age was probably mid '40's. :( Wah. Anyway, the restaurant couldn't control the event goers. What made up for it was the $5 small pizza my friend ordered and shared with me and the $3 Guiness I split with her. The heaters on the patio definitely helped because otherwise I would have bounced right quick.

Happy Hour prices are bomb but the rest of the regular prices are a little steep for what you get. Also, the bartenders are sometimes just not at the bar and are a bit slow (I'm excluding the pregnant bartender from this because she has an excuse.)",OLn8EvPsu4hNug8V5PF2jA,1,1,3,hMCWcQsHFCJbZHEwJY-S8w

My fella had a Groupon so we moseyed on over for some take-out. I've been a few times before, so I knew what to expect. I ordered the angel hair pasta with pesto and my fella got the eggplant and chicken neopolitan. Mine was just ok. Luckily, my fella liked mine quite a bit and was willing to split the two meals between us. I enjoyed his quite a bit more than mine, but they were both still good. 

I like the atmosphere in the restaurant typically and I know they have karaoke on select days. Not really my thing, but it's good to know.

It's a good little spot, definitely worth the trip if you have a BOGO coupon.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,4,1,3,Q-dsNfutn13IGydLDdaSOQ
