8269,2016-01-11,1,NfM1YE-FJCToO1LB36T6lQ,"First time here and I can honestly say I WILL NEVER BE COMING AGAIN!! 
Jason's deli was horrible ordered 3 items of the menu and disappointed with all 3. My turkey wrap which is a top pick was horrifying. My entire tortilla was hard and cracking apart as I picked it up. The wilted vegetables and over ripped fruit that came with it didn't help. It had no flavored and the sauce didn't help it just over powered. The half sandwich and soup option was no better actually worse. The soup seemed like powered cheese clustered into one ball and the sandwich the best out of everything was literally two bites. My panini was horrible the bread was some hard nasty plain white bread and the sandwich had no flavor. It was dry and flavorless. What a disappointing experience now I know to never come back.",zj8ulrRi68FGKLiv9rdmGg,0,0,1,Rp78zL9StZ43xV0M1XJlsw

We took an order Home to eat, and once we arrived we realized that the desert we ordered didn't make it in the bag. I called in and spoke with Jayden, she was very polite and I asked if they could just take the charge off my credit card because I couldn't drive back down. She placed me on hold to speak to a manager and came back to tell me they would deliver the missing item to us. Very promptly a driver knocked on the door. Our desert was here along with some extra gingerbread muffins, and a note from the management apologizing for the inconvenience. The note finished with enjoy a cookie on us. There were a couple of chocolate chip cookies in the bag! 

Now this may not seem so amazing, but there are a couple factors to think about : 
1. My wife is pregnant and this made her night! 
2. My wife and I have both worked in food service in the past, and highly respect when people take that extra moment to make an experience memorable.

Final straw, I turned around and left.  Not coming back here again even if the next thousand meals were free.

Back when this place first opened, it was packed.  But there's simply something about this location that doesn't cut it.

We've already seen the closure of Mimi's Cafe just next to this spot, I wouldn't be shocked to see this location gone within the next year or two.

I was a little ticked - I initially wanted a deli Club but i was told they ran out of bacon - on a Saturday during lunch hour ?!?! So i asked the cashier, if i get it do you give me a reduced rate since there's no bacon , big surprise, the answer, "" No ! "" 

I then start to pay the tab ( $21 - included 2 drinks ) with a $100. the cashier says, "" I don't have change for that . "" Holy Shit Batman, here's an idea , go get some frickin' change Elroy ! So i paid with a debit card. 

The food - the sammie - nice portion of meat, decent flavor but dang, they must store the meat in a vat of juice because the one side of the sammie was soaked - overall, it was good but drain the meat a little or maybe put it on a grill for a few minutes. I went with the hot mustard but they didn't come close to put enough on to add to the flavor.

I opted to build my own sandwich with chicken, pesto, jalapeños, and pepper jack on focaccia. All the sandwiches come with your choice of chips. I opted for the baked, but I didn't even eat them. I would much rather have fries. 

The pesto was great. They added plenty to the sandwich. The chicken was also good. I wish the sandwich had been warmer - the cheese wasn't even melted. The jalapeños were pickled. I really only prefer fresh, so I took these off. My biggest complaint was the bread. It was closer to a ciabatta than a focaccia. The bread was a bit too crusty and chewy for my liking.

The only genuine complaint about our visit happened during the dining in option. The restaurant was not very clean in general. The fountain station was a mess and the floors were filthy.

We get our food, which was served by one of the employees who was playing with his phone. He didn't even say anything as he delivered the food, he wasn't wearing gloves, and I have no idea if he washed his hands. My sandwich looked gross, like it was thrown together. I didn't even eat half of the half I ordered. He ate all his pastrami but had an eyelash on his chips. Gross.

1717197,2015-08-28,0,NfM1YE-FJCToO1LB36T6lQ,"Brief Overview:
Jason's Deli is a healthy dining option that offers meals and salads that meet most family budgets and is kid friendly.

Pros:
- The ambience inside the restaurant is nice and the location is convenient right off of 215 and Rainbow
- They have a nice selection of veggies and toppings at their salad bar for about $8-ish.
- They have a nice 8-12 person conference room for meetings and classes

Cons:
- Not all their food is organic and Non-GMO (after watching Food Inc and Food Matters, I wish all their food was organic and non-GMO, it's kind of a tease with just some it being this way)
- Their company website shows the ingredient lists of their salad dressings and other foods like hummus and I was disappointed by what I saw. This is big for me since they talk a lot about premium and more natural food on their website.

Final Verdict:
I like going here because they have an all you can eat salad bar for a reasonable price and the food tastes great. There's sandwiches, soups, salads, and other prepared meals to keep your tastebuds entertained.",s1DTIKX-ZXcQOMDlcOI6Tg,0,1,3,mZgAjX8ie7LJXUJakFkwYg

We entered the restaurant and planned to order to take out. We were greeted by Gerardo ( I believe he was the manager. He had a different uniform than the others) He handed us a menu to look at and told us if we had any questions let him know.

I ordered the deli club (Yummy! De-licous) and chicken noodles. My BF ordered the deli cowboy (he thought it was okay) and chicken noodle as well. Ah, yes....can't forget the complimentary ice cream that comes with every order

As we waited for our order there was a lady ahead of us and she must have been waiting a while because Gerardo was so awesome and was so apologetic to the lady because of the wait and offered her an extra cookie or chip for the inconvenience I know, it's not a whole lot to some BUT just the gesture and service was just really nice to see. 

Everyone was friendly. The place was clean and quiet. This was around 6pm and there was not a whole lot of people in the restaurant. 

While we waited for our food. Gerardo offered us water while we waited and apologized for the
A/C not working (which btw felt fine inside the restaurant) and not long after our food came out.

First impression is this place is nice and clean with a decent size menu. We both decide to go with the manager's special which is half a sandwich with either a cup of soup OR a cup of fruit with chips and a pickle. I emphasize the ""OR"" because when we get to ordering and my sister tells the girl behind the counter that she would like fruit she tells us that its $2 extra. We point out that the ""special"" is either or and she continues to argue that we would still have to be charged extra...OK...fine...whatever, can we just get the rest of our order in???? Then she asked what kind of soup she would like and again we try to tell her that she doesn't want soup, she wants the fruit instead. Again, the girl tells us that no matter what it comes with soup and the fruit is still extra. On to my order, again I order the ""special"" with a Ruben and not wanting to stand there for another 5 minutes arguing I just order a cup of soup. She then asked me if I wanted rye bread, sour kraut and Russian dressing, at this point I'm thinking ""isn't that what makes a Ruben??"" Instead I smile and just say yes. She then informs me that it would be extra....WHAT?!? She asked if I wanted the chips and pickle to which I said yes. OK that's two strikes which I chalk up to it being newly opened and working out the kinks.

So we grab our drinks and wait for our food to arrive at the table. The food comes and I notice that neither of us got chips and/or a pickle. I looked at the ticket just in case I was wrong but no, it's there. I showed an assistant manager who happened to be close by and his response was "" did they not bring your chips out?

Pros-
- Large, clean, and well lit dining area! This actually came as a pleasant surprise. In a lot of ways it reminded me of Cafe Zupas.
- Very friendly service! The young ladies working tonight were all so helpful and friendly, plus someone was always walking around the floor bussing and cleaning tables.
- An extensive menu with a ton of food options! Plenty of soup, salad, and sandwich options! Plenty of things I want to try on future visits!
- I had the Beefeater(hot roast beef sandwich)($6.99, sandwich comes with either regular chips or baked chips) which was yummy and delicious! My friend had a pastrami sandwich on wheat bread(also $6.99, including either regular or baked chips as well). We each swapped a half of our sandwiches out so that we could try each one. I actually think I liked his pastrami even more than my roast beef! Both were very solid though.
- Free ice cream after your meal! Nice touch and I'm sure I will appreciate this all the more when it is not 38 degrees out!


Cons-
- a tad bit on the pricey side for what you get. At $2.09 each plus tax for the medium sodas, I felt they were overpriced. I would never buy this if I wanted to grab something to go, only if I was going to dine in. Actually, this place seems like it would be best served as a dine in experience only.

   The free corn and ginger mini muffins are so awesome.  Despite the very fulfilling Beef Eater Po'Boy I save room for one of each of them.  You can also get a soft serve ice cream cone to go.  I never do due to the Beef Eater filling me up.

Ambiance: 
This spot is a casual cafeteria style deli where you order at the counter and eat with efficiency.
It can get really busy and loud with the lunch crowd. However, you can expect the line to move fast (which is great when you're rushed).
  
Food: 
I've only visited this spot for a quick lunch a handful of times. I usually get the salad bar with my coworkers. On occasion, I order my Spud Au Broc for a cheesy guilty pleasure.

Salad Bar: 
Their salad bar is freshly stocked with chopped veggies (carrots, cucumbers, olives, mushrooms, spinach, tomatoes, red peppers, green peppers, broccoli etc.), fruit salad, beets, crackers, croutons, shredded cheese, cottage cheese, peas, pickles, hard-boiled eggs, potato salad, watermelon, artichokes, pasta salad, chocolate mousse with chocolate chips, vanilla pudding, and mini corn muffins. You also are offered soft serve ice cream (included with the salad bar).  You order and then grab your plate/fork at the 2nd station before heading to your table of choice. 

Spud Au Broc: 
Their spud is huge! It's covered with broccoli cheese soup, melted cheddar cheese, steamed broccoli, bacon bits, and green onions. This is made behind the counter and a food runner will find your table and number and deliver it to you. 

Tip: They offer this spud in half size. 

Service: 
They have a fantastic team of employees at this location. They do their jobs very well. It is always clean and everyone seems to be focused on their task. All the cashiers and food runners that I've encountered have always been outgoing and make you feel welcome. There is one older gentleman that is always walking the floor at lunch time. He busses the tables and is an exceptional employee. He asks if he can bring you anything and always has a smile. It always makes my day.  He's amazing and has a stellar work ethic. I will update this review when I find out his name. Service here has always been a 5 star experience. 

Overall, this is a solid lunch spot that I will keep it on my rotation solid 3.5/4 stars in my book.

I had been waiting for this location to open for a while, as I work fairly close to it and we are always on the lookout for new places to get lunch. I needed to run an errand on my lunch break recently, so I called in an order to go for myself and a coworker. 

My first impression upon arriving was that the management didn't care enough about the customers waiting to order or pay. I called in my order to try to save myself some time... When it was my turn to pay, the cashier was being spoken to by both district manager and the store manager (I could tell their position by their name badges) which is fine, the place had just recently opened and it's likely there was still training occurring.

What was not fine in my opinion was that after another employee asked me if I had been helped, he tried to get the cashier to ring me up. BOTH of the managers looked over to the register, saw me waiting as well as multiple others behind me, and decided to continue their conversation with the cashier. When they finished talking, all three walked over to the register and made eye contact with me, but only the cashier apologized for the wait. 

Thankfully my food was ready by the time I was rang up so I didn't have to wait any longer. The food itself was good, I had the Club Royale which had a lot of meat which is nice, some places skimp.  would have preferred a fruit cup rather then cups for a side but the additional cost for the healthier option was a little ridiculous. 

I don't see myself going back for another try for a while, hopefully another month or two the staff of Jason's Deli will get their system figured out and hopefully management will realize the importance of respecting their customer's time.",Ae4uXwFHp-5fGrt6OONaXw,2,0,3,2z0UbE_eA7oWD-NKd27Nig

The salad bar is good when it's stocked. I've eaten here several times when the cherry tomatoes were wrinkled and way past their prime, the sad broccoli was floating in a tub of water, and the lettuce and other containers have been close to empty. Other times I've encountered a bountiful, fresh salad bar. 

The food can be hit or miss and the portions have been shrinking while the prices have been rising. At least they seem to understand when I ask for ""no bread"" with my sandwich (low carb style), but you'd think they'd knock off 50 cents or something since I'm not being served the bread (which is the bulk of their sandwiches, believe me). I often leave here hungry because the portions are so minuscule. I've been served strawberries that were so mushy they had thumbprints in them and chicken breast that was microwaved so long that you couldn't even chew it. I don't tend to like restaurants that have microwaves out front and center -- what kind of message does that send about the quality?

Bonus points for the fact that they always have tasty, fresh strawberries all year long. I don't know how they do that!

However, there's something I just don't like about this place. I've been to some really good delis in New York (and even around Las Vegas) and it's hard to really compete. I wasn't expecting much, but still, this place just seems like one of those compromises you make because you're really hungry at lunch and don't feel like arguing with your co-workers. My first trip there I ordered a pot roast sandwich and received some sort of pastrami monstrosity that I had to dissect like a pig fetus before I could fit it reasonably in my mouth. The pastrami was gristly, dry and salty and I was kind of turned off. 

The next time I went there I got some kind of California croissant with avocado and turkey that wasn't bad. But it's kind of expensive - like $8 - $10 bucks a sandwich. I could go to a lot of better places for that kind of money. After a soda it's like 12 or 13 bucks. 

Now when I go I just get the chili, which is pretty good all around. I've never been disappointed with the chili. The ambiance is loud. There are usually tons of people there at lunch (many with kids running around and screaming their heads off - like a Little Rascals episode) and usually some sort of supervisor woman yelling ""Service!"" or something to her servers every time an order needs to go out which adds to a kind of 1930s Soviet sweatshop vibe. Again, kind of a turn off, but I'll still go back if I'm really hungry. It's convenient.",lTrFOWPEb_NkbOLNN9Dkrg,2,1,2,uB4j1mz8BiWcztrJRZ2Ebg

We sat down and I started drinking my $2.70 tea, not worth buying it there, but I really wanted it! Our food came and my wrap had sprouts........really? I was a bit cranky after that and the wrap was so measly (the sprout to turkey ratio was like 2:1) that it could barely make a 2 year old full. I think a manager came by and asked if they could remake it for me, but I was already 1/3 of the way done with all the sprouts taken out. The hubby enjoyed his sandwich which could definitely fill someone up. Overall, I was really disappointed in the lack of food for the cost.

Chicken noodle soup - SUPER concentrated. I needed to put ice cubes in it to cool AND water it down. After the ice cubes my children ate a little bit

Chili - it's like hot dog chili. Not good at all!! I took it back to the cashier and he has ask permission to switch it out. We had literally dipped 2 crackers in the bowl. Not even a spoonful worth was missing. Yuck. 

Muffeletta- I regret not taking a picture of the aftermath of this. We got the whole turkey sandwich. When it came to the table there was like a 1/4 lb of meat to 2lbs of olive tapenade!! It was down right gross. After my husband opened the top and bottom of his sandwich up to let all the olive mixture fall out his whole plate was COVERED. I understand olives, celery, and pepperocinis are cheaper than turkey but REALLY. I love olives and I still let alot fall out without eating the remnants. 

Chicken Caesar salad- Standard. Safe. If someone drags you here (by your hair) order this. The chicken was warm and the dressing was good.

They have a manager's special, which lets you select soup, salad or sandwich. You get to choose two. And it includes chips or a side of fruit.

The way the employees are too is a little weird. They remind me of the children of the corn.
I've never been to a Jason's deli, and I'll never come back to one.
Oh yeah, I forgot they ID'd me for a $1.50 cup of coffee when I used my card to purchase it- which was pretty weird.",soFNjo1-ao4grGSJ0u9S4g,0,0,1,4EcWZcPb681EzZMfaX_Q1g

I usually order the chicken club salad with the balsamic vinegar dressing. The décor is nice with hints of Vegas and the facility is pretty clean. The food looks healthy for the most part but some of their dishes push close to over 1500 calories. I have not tried their unlimited salad bar but it looks like it has a nice variety of toppings and dressings to choose from. However, if you're not concerned with calories, it is a nice spot to eat. Lots of room to cater for groups of four or more.",7ITKX-WWuOXTXFVdJVxgSA,0,0,4,iKpsmRvWAwVLH5RmogJfHg

This location, located in Arroyo shopping area, has great parking among the other business and walking in you are quickly heading to the front order window. I did notice a self ordering system for Salad Bar Only so that's a cool little feature. 
The menu still supports great sandwiches, soups, salads, deserts, and main course bigger dishes. 
After getting your order in, take your number find a seat and they will bring your food. If you have an salad options, just walk up to the prep station and they will provide you with plates and go attack the salad bar which was well stocked and fresh on this day. 

the place was clean and tables got cleared fairly quickly. 
I was satisfied with Jason Deli upgrades and will certainly add them back on my list of places to eat. Don't forget the soft serve ice cream cone you get too!

Now for the wraps, potion size is disappointing!! The wrap is so tiny for $8

Good menu selection and options. I ordered three different items two different sandwiches and a salad. I was prompted a 30 minute pickup time. Showed up in 30 sharp wasn't ready yet I don't think they had actually retrieved the order off their computer yet. I was told 7 mins and it was 7 mins. The staff was polite. Place looked clean and inviting the best part was the food it was very good. Sandwiches excellent salad was fresh too. My only complaint with the salad was more dressing was needed than supplied.

I was expecting the same type of dining experience her in Vegas but was disappointed.

Once ordered they give you a number that you set in a clamp on the table so the server knows where to bring your meal once served; I was sitting within earshot of the counter and I heard them say runner my number and after 5 mins I heard them yell runner my number again; I walked over and asked if I could take my sandwich back to my table on my own; no apology, no thank you, just yeah and they turned their back to me. 

The salad bar is good size and the food was fresh but was missing something unique to make it stand out above their competitors; I did see a sign that proclaimed ""pickle lovers rejoice"" and was expecting to find a few different choices of pickles to choose from; there was only one and they pickles were older/wilted pickles that had lost their crunch. Was very disappointed as I wanted to rejoice in pickle bliss. 

The crowd was loud but that may have a lot to do with the acoustics inside the place but was rather distracting not something I was used to from the store in Omaha; the tables are laid out so you are force to squeeze between aisles but that I'm sure is due to how popular they are and their attempt to give everyone a place to sit. 

They do have good food and I highly recommend the Chicken Pot Pie they serve it in a small size if you want to do soup and sandwich or you can order a full cup and it will surely fill you up and taste delicious. My only major recommendation is to try to go during non-peak hours so you don't get over whelemed by the crowd and your food doesn't get stuck sitting on a counter getting cold while the servers try to maneuver around the aisles and aisles of people hovering.",Yg08tRMxm0eaL-rXyNIAHw,1,0,4,_PAY4tsQ9NLsgO49a2N8xw

I have to say, I wasn't entirely impressed, but it's a decent option for lunch. One of my major turn offs with this location was that the service was spotty at best. The girl who took our order was nice but there seemed to be quite a disconnect between the ordering, pick up and rest of the service. We stood around for a little too long with our receipts to pick up our salad plates, despite having several employees walk past us knowing we were waiting. I didn't entirely understand having to take our receipts just a few feet down the line when it seemed easy enough for the cashier to hand us empty salad plates since she had already handed us empty drink cups. 

Once we were finally seated and had our food, I was happy enough with the food. The soup was perfect to soothe my sore throat and the side of fruit was surprisingly fresh and delicious. The sandwich was decent too although I'd likely ask them not to toast my croissant next time. Just too crunchy and crumbly for my taste.

When my fella wanted a clean salad plate and tried to hand over his dirty one to an employee emptying the trash, he instead directed my guy to the front counter again. I think they could definitely work on their customer service and communication skills, but otherwise it's a good option for lunch.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,13,11,3,VTTfmFpdggxU7HWrHvAdnA

Can I request you open more locations preferably in 89117 near chinatown near buffalo and spring mountain? :) I often look for healthy options when I'm around town, and there are not as many healthy options as I'd like. This places salad bar is the best I have ever had anywhere and I have traveled most of the USA. Tho I wish there plate was a little deeper b.c. I need more space to mix the salad. I haven't tried anything else in this place yet, but I'm sure I will be a return customer. I'm a salad eater. I even eat salads @ home most of the time. I'm a health nut I guess, I like my veggies. They have cheeses, and nuts, best vegetarian salad @ any salad bar I have ever eaten @, and they had cut little melon ball shaped beets. I like beets in my salads.
