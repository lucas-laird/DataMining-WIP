39751,2017-07-27,1,iFCz-xI7CV98fcaB4Chh3g,"Ok. Second time here, first time I had kim chee fried rice and pork belly bowl, both good. 

Second time around , I got the imperial spring rolls with pork and shrimp, couple pickled carrots and a small frisée salad. Really enjoyed the flavors of the dish. Also got the lemongrass and jerk chicken thigh. This is where I give it three stars. When I think of a chicken thigh, I don't think of dry meat. This was very dry and lacked flavor. I barely tasted the lemongrass or the jerk seasoning. The papaya salad was straight papaya and that's it, nothing exciting but decent. 

Also when you walk in, it's hard to figure out where to pick up your food. I'm sure I'll give it another shot down the road but the dryness of that thigh meat was very underwhelming.",LBV0c_eYzt6_HQMSGUEZHw,0,0,3,I0WkvmmY8QLibSc2QaINPQ

Lady had a red wine blend which was tasty, and I had some Hoppy Times. I especially enjoyed the selection from local craft. We ordered some oysters which were $1 each during hh. Lemongrass oysters with the mignonette was la flame. A lot of their menu looked promising but we had already eaten so them tummies wasn't feeling for anymore food. The chicken wings had a description of black garlic being used for which I'll be making a return visit for. Seating arrangement is cool, full bar is huge, and menu is super reasonable. I'd go back just to take advantage of the awesome prices with some of the menu having ingredients you wouldn't find at any other spot.

434689,2017-05-20,0,iFCz-xI7CV98fcaB4Chh3g,"Rule of thumb is to wait at least a few weeks to try a restaurant. Well, I couldn't wait(and happy I didn't).

The staff of course had no shortage of smiles and warm energy. Important to me is they were knowlegable in all the dishes, thus able to advise according to my pallete and their personal pallette. 

Servicescape looks like a very mordern bar/restairant meets barn. Very cool.

To what matters most to me...THE FOOD! I order family style to make sure I have a well rounded opinion of a restaurants food. 

I highly recommend quite a few things... My top favs...

Appitizers: 
1)Beef Crisps -new concept to me its playful and delicious play on a personal food favorite chicharrones. Subtle but you can taste the  beef flavor and a popcorn-like airy goodness.
2)Spring Rolls - I slept on this the first night but thanks to the waitors advice I got to taste a home run. Ill get this every time. Its a unike flavor that you will just need to try, and far from the traditional spring roll flaovr... They are Addicting.

Mains:
1)Salmon Clay Pot: Umami! Scent, sight, taste, its all there. I love when great tasting food is also healthy! The arouma of the smoke puts you in a happy place before you even take the first delicious bites.
2) Duroc Pork: Totally uniqie flavor from all the dishes. I need a bigger vocab to be able to describe the flavor. Felt vietnamese/thai in taste with the acidity. Nothing sweet about it. Savory lovers. It was just so good. 
3) Whole fish: Meaty, Crispy. Flaky. It reminds me of a carribean esqeviche. Its very light for being fried. So good!

Drinks: 
I didnt have any but there is a special black sheep beer drink that sounds like a big winner! Ask your server!

Owners and operators have previous incredible success at both Chada and Chada Street and the wine list here shows those chops yet again. Menu is well-designed in offering strong, impactful dishes while staying compact and focused. We split the supposedly renowned beet salad -- which was incredible (the goat cheese yogurt is flawless and balanced) -- and ordered the chicken curry and short ribs. Both entrees were delightful and displayed the chef's deft grasp of flavor compliments and layers. Service was outstanding and informative and offered informed opinions about dishes and cocktails.

We got a variety of entrées including the short rib, the Scottish king pot salmon, chicken thigh and the hanger steak. Everyone commented on how much they enjoyed their food.

1040956,2018-02-20,0,iFCz-xI7CV98fcaB4Chh3g,"An innobative chef brings her mixed bag to Southwest Vegas. For starters we tried the salmon skin tacos, the beet salad, the crispy beef cracklin's and the Imperial egg rolls. We thought the salmon skin tacos missed the mark. Tha salmon tartare was so heavily spiced with the smoked peppers, we lost the flavor of the salmon. The other three were great. I'd order the dressing on the beet salad on the side next time.

For entrees, we had the braised short rib, the whole rainbow trout and the braised pork belly. Our favorite was the trout, roasted whole and boneless. It was cooked perfectly. The pork belly was nicely braised, developing a creamy, flavorful texture in the fat during the braise. The short rib was good, but not a favorite.

Portions are fair, the service is very good and the atmosphere pleasant. We'd go back, which is a high recommendation.",ZL_zmesRw89J8PrsdJg6Uw,0,0,4,Juc7NrAIUKhYlBdxnDNNUg

We randomly stopped in and lucked up on happy hour, it was decent $5 wines $1 oysters and I think they had a beer special. I think they should expand on the happy hour though maybe offer all house wines as they only had a cab, Pinot Grigio, rose and a sparkling and maybe add well drinks and possibly discounted appetizers, anyway the food was good the oysters were so so but we didn't expect to much for $1 I could have passed on the bed of salt the oysters were sitting on as the oysters already had a naturally salty flavor which I wasn't sure how I felt about but the bed of salt made me feel like I needed to get my blood pressure checked afterwards lol. All the food has an Asian flare which offers very interesting flavor combinations. We went all in and tried most of the appetizers on the menu the tuna was my favorite the rolls were my hubbys fave.

We arrived early and it was pretty empty at 545pm. They sat us right away in the middle of the restaurant. Our reservation was at 615pm. At that time it started filling up and by 630 it was packed, the place is not that big so get a reservation for sure.

We told them it was our first time and the waitress explained the favorite dishes and they were the ones I saw on the reviews I read. We ordered the Bao sliders, which were great the bun was fresh and yummy. Next the Imperial roll which didn't disappoint. 

While we were enjoying these items we saw another table get a large clumped item with something drizzled on it. We asked our waitress and she called it a beef skin popcorn. It's called Beef crisp. It is like pork rines but beef with a spice truffle oil. It was really good. 

Our mains were the braised Duroc pork belly and beef short ribs. The pork had the best flavor and a must order. The short rib was just ok, good but like other places.

Our finally was the Chocolate Très Leche Cake. It was delightful, so light not rich since it's sponge cake you have to get this one.

All in all a fantastic time. The service was great, friendly and you will have to try The Black Sheep when you come to Vegas. Off the strip but you won't be disappointed.",l4DR96r3o5fguyezVij5iw,2,0,4,iV6bhh2kHs0Ay-4italzgA

To start the night off, we had Bao Sliders and Fried Beef Crisps. The buns in the sliders were made of bao dough, the pork sausage patties were juicy and flavorful, and the jalapeño aioli that topped it gave it a hint of spiciness. It also had a fried quail egg on top with a runny yolk; I was very impressed by this because I have ever only seen boiled quail eggs! The Beef Crisps were amazing; it is a sophisticated take on pork rinds. Beef tendon is air dried and deep fried, creating this exquisite dish. It was dusted with black and red pepper and drizzled with a citrus-y vinegar table side. Both appetizers are must tried. 

For the entree, I had the Grilled Creekstone Hanger Stone. They recommend it being cooked medium rare, and wow was it delectable. The steak was juicy and tender and had a buttery texture. It had a smoky, thick glaze that covered the entire steak which gave it a good flavor. It was accompanied by fingerling potatoes, cooked very tender, and half a cob of corn. The corn was their take on Mexican street corn, which was covered with coconut Gouda and cilantro.

I have been to The Black Sheep several times now- from after they opened, to Restaurant Week, to cocktails and food at the bar, to a sit down dinner with friends - every experience has been solid. 

I am a Cocktail Darling so when I find a place that serves original delicious cocktails, I can make myself a regular. The first cocktail I tried here, several weeks after their opening, was their now famous La Flama Blanca. That bit of heat was incredible and genius. I somehow felt this place was special for cocktails so over time I have tried Mr. Brownstone, The Black Sheep and numerous others. One of my favorites has to be Mr. Brownstone, not only for the presentation but the smoothness of this drink. They have a wonderful wine selection and after dinner liqueurs that I have also indulged in. Their alcohol selection is thoughtfully planned and worth coming back for.

As for the food, the genius vision of Chef Jaime Tran creating upscale fusion food sets this restaurant apart from others in the same food genre. Chef Jamie is such an upbeat and joyful person, every bit of her spunk translates into the dishes she creates. I have dove into many of their dishes and all of them are fabulous. 

One of the owners, Andy, is very personable and has a good memory for faces and names. He always makes you feel welcome as he makes his rounds about The Black Sheep talking to customers and calling you by name. Such a sincere and personable touch. 

So far the dishes I have tried, loved and recommend are: Vietnamese Imperial Rolls, West Coast Oysters, Braised Duroc Pork Belly, Scottish Salmon and the Short Ribs. The Black Sheep has added more desserts beyond their original Chocolate Tres Leches, which is divine and sinful. On my last visit a few weeks ago,  I tried a some of my friend's Horchata Crème Brule and it was insanely delicious. I am very curious on their new desserts and I know it is time for me to go back in and do more indulging!

See you soon Andy and Chef Jaime!",quDu_Z0-i9TCYvdHRnULEw,4,5,5,BFBcY6Drg_txzKCIfII52A

Pickled veggies, visually very inviting! And the sourness opens an appetite.  Fried octopus was delish with the sauce.  The short rib personally was under seasoned and not as tender as ones I've had before else where. But the ratatouille underneath was flavorful!

Anyhow, my friends and I happened to go on the last day of restaurant week. So you got an app, entree, and dessert, ALL WITH A WINE PAIRING for $40. So ok BOMBDIGGITY DEALIO. So, I got the egg rolls, short rib, and macaroons. I love fried food, so egg rolls were bomb. I just wish they didn't put the fish sauce on the egg rolls bc I don't like TOO much fish sauce but whatev - it was still hot and crunchy and delicious. The short rib was a little dry but the veggies and gnocchi around it was moist enough that if you had all 3 on your fork it was an even distribution of moist and flavor. 

I did not like the macaroons. There was something in there that kinda made my mouth feel numb? I don't know. It was weird. I've had a lot of macaroons in my time and these were def my least fav. 

My friends got the hanger steak? They all cleaned their plates so I assume they hated it (insert sarcastic font). Anyways, cute new spot (with the most atrocious parking situation) in the southwest side.

This place is always packed and open for a short one-hour happy hour and for dinner.

I would go back here just for their Flama Blanca cocktail. It is shochu based with lemon and thai chili syrup. Probably one of the best cocktails I have had.

I love their ahi tuna tartare drizzled with chili citrus oil on top of a tapioca crisp. For entree, I ordered their fried rainbow trout. Crispy skinned trout on top of jasmine rice with ginger and white wine vinegar.

Very fresh, clean (no sand and hardly any shell at all, which comes with the territory), and perfect size. I prefer smaller oysters so these being petite made them even better. Rich, our waiter, was amazing. He checked on us often, explained the menu and drinks well, placed our orders quickly so we would be able to get the oysters in the frenzy of happy hour, and just had an all around great personality!

Had the Mai Tai, Penicillin, Black Manhattan, White Negroni, and one other (as well as a $4 Ballast Point for Happy Hour). All were great. Particularly liked the Negroni. Still not completely sold on Amaro Montenegro substituting for vermouth in a Manhattan, but more research needs to be done. Perhaps Jessica (the bartender, who was fantastic) may be willing to try it as a Rob Roy for me (not super fond of Rye).
The food was also great. $1 oysters for Happy Hour (5-6). Big fan of the gelee sauce. Boa sliders. Salmon tacos (with crispy salmon as the shell). Whatever those spring roll things were (sorry, I've been drinking), The wings seemed out of place, as they were a bit heavier than the other dishes, but I'll still probably get them on my next visit (a bit heavy, but still yummy). 
Need to try an entree next time, and I'm guessing desserts will be very interesting.

My girlfriend and I decided to just share a few appetizers (trying to watch our weight). The first appetizer was the Heirloom Tomato and Watermelon Salad, it was served with some creamy burrrrrata cheese which I'm not the biggest fan of, but it complimented the dish very well. The next appetizer was the Crispy Mediterranean Octopus and just to note, anytime there are little Spanish Octopus babies on a menu, I will always order them. I really enjoyed the vadouvan sauce, it was a very light and tangy curry sauce with just the right amount of spice and of course the babies were cookies to perfection, tender and crispy! Our last app was the Ahi Tuna Tartare, it was a very simple and elegant dish. I am a big fan of doing less is more (it's how I live my life), this was a very simplistic ahi tuna tartare, which is what I prefer. Most Ahi Tuna Tartares I've had are always overpowered with tons of sauces and obnoxious toppings and as for this one I really enjoyed just having the fish with the chili citrus oil on a creative crisp rice taco shell, simple yet divine!

The starters were definitely not what I was expecting.  We had the crispy octopus and 1/2 a dozen oysters (west coast).  The oysters had so much shells from shucking that I was scared to have more than 1.  Sauces cost extra so just be aware.  The crispy octopus was a little bit my taste; but there was something in it that I bit into that had this disgusting bitter taste and killed the whole plate for me.  Again this may just be a one time thing so please don't be afraid to try those dishes because they are phenomenal.  Now let's get to the good part of this review.  Being that I'm Cambodian I had to try the Jerk Chicken because the dish came with papaya salad and my family always love to try new styles of papaya salad.  OH MY GOODNESS.  It was AMAZING.  I have nothing bad to say.  The tenderness of the chicken and the spice from the papaya salad made me feel like I was eating my grandma's cooking and we all know grandma's cooking is the best.  My friend had the salmon which is another must try.  I only had a few bites so I wouldn't be able to tell you what the full flavor profile of the plate was; but I can tell you that we almost licked our plate clean.  Service was amazing.  She was attentive and kind and gave us enough space to enjoy our dinner without feeling like she was on us.  Great job with this one.

Chef Jaime Tran's dishes are thoughtful twists on classics that add a little extra flavor and finesse worth crossing town for.

I came in with a pescatarian pal and we tried most of the dishes suitable for her diet, starting with a half dozen happy hour oysters and the oft-'grammed Ahi Tuna Tartare on crispy rice. The oysters were fresh and briney, and we paired them with their spicy rooster cocktail sauce for a bit of a kick. The tartare was beautifully presented and palpably fresh, with micro cilantro garnish and chili citrus oil. 

We moved on to the Crispy Mediterranean Octopus and the Charred Peach & Mesclun Salad with the Fried Whole Rainbow Trout as our shared entree. The octopus was fried rather than the typical grilled preparation, and the spicy chili and vadouvan sauce is not for the faint of heart. The portion size on this dish was happily a touch larger than expected. The summery salad was decent, but the peaches needed a bit more time on the grill and a slightly larger dose of acidity in the prickly-pear vin. The fish entree was the most traditional of the dishes we tried and it was much enjoyed, filleted boneless with a complementary ginger and rice wine vinegar sauce that went well with the greens and rice.

Service was attentive throughout our visit and the bustling space was busy but not bursting.The dining room could benefit from a bit more light, as supported by most snap-happy diners taking their food literally outside in order to get a good shot. Looking forward to revisiting with a carnivorous friend for the sliders, wings, and short rib.

We arrived around 6 and they only had 2 other tables and a few people at the bar. We seated immediately, our server got us water and took our drink orders immediately. He explained the menu and made recommendations, food came out pretty quickly and he came back to check-in our us regularly. Towards the end of our meal was then they got busy, the restaurant filled up and it was clear they were under-staffed. I asked for a soda re-filled and waited about 15 minutes until I got it, we just asked for the check and left. Even though service lacked a little towards the end I would say service was really good. The 3 start is for the food. 

Presentation was excellent, very instagram worthy. I think they have unique ideas and concepts but lacked flavors in my opinion. 

Oysters - We got them with the spicy cocktail sauce which I liked and the Thai chili granita which I did not care for. But my biggest issue with these oysters as that they were very warm, like a couple degrees above room temperature. I am not an oyster expert or anything but I have always had oysters cold...these were so warm they feel like eating cheap Chinese buffet oysters. That totally killed the dish for me. 

Crisply Octopus - Love the idea of fried octopus and really liked the curry sauce that came with it but the octopus itself was too tough and hard to eat. It is very lightly breaded but too tough to eat, doesn't have have chewy sharpness that octopus usually has. 

Bao Sliders - These were so cute to look at! The buns were fluffy and sweet, love the quail egg on top, but even with the pork sausages and the aioli it tasted very bland. The flavors did not pop at all, I tasted the slight sweetness of the buns and the slight saltiness of the sausages, no strong flavor to hold everything together. 

Salmon Clay Pot - Extremely disappointed with this dish. Big and delicous piece of salmon...the only good thing about the dish. The eggplant and the farro were so bland..none of us liked this dish. If they had some sauces on top or on the side that would have helped. Salmon is bland on its own, the farro and eggplant added to the blandness. 

Duroc Pork Belly and Slow Cooked Short Rib - These two dishes were delicious. The meats melts in your mouth, so soft and sweet. Strong flavors, love the sticky rice that came with the pork belly. Very impressed with these two. 

So out of the 3 appetizers and 3 main dishes I only enjoyed the two main dishes. I think this place has potential, they have interesting ideas but I think they need to work on adding more flavors to their dishes. Most of the dishes were bland and just did not satisfy my appetite as much as I would have liked.",7svBs9qqPJHPRXZ56Q3ZuQ,4,1,3,NKGp_HSIS52fyC2LyzkebQ

I really enjoy the ambiance of this place. If it wasn't for a lady laughing her heart out in a neighboring table, the amount of noise is moderate. 
Though I'm used to more acidity in my salads, to my wife the apple salad was perfect. The tuna tartare was really good. It is served on crisps that resemble pork rinds.
My wife ordered the pork belly and it was flavorful and tender.
I'd been staying away from beef for 15 days and I was ready to break my diet, so when I saw the ribeye on the menu, I immediately started to crave the flavor and tenderness given by the marbling in this particular cut. I ordered it medium.
When the food arrived, the steak was served sliced and the center was clearly medium rare. I can live with that, however, it definitely didn't look, felt, or tasted like a ribeye. It had no marbling whatsoever, and it was too thick and narrow. It felt like a sirloin, which is too lean and much less flavorful and tender (and usually way cheaper too). I felt cheated, but I was hungry and in no mood to complain about it.
This is a small business, a really nice place, and it's been open for less than a year, so I'm definitely giving it another chance. I would much rather go there than to one of the big chain restaurants. I guess I'll just ask a lot more questions before placing my order.

The staff were very attentive and informative and told us about the whole menu.  The timing on the dishes were great.

We got the ahi tuna tartare, vietnamese imperial rolls, spicy vietnamese curry chicken, and the beet salad, the tres leches cake, the tequila cocktail, and the two rum cocktails.  The tuna tartare was good but not mind blowing and the imperial rolls were quite tasty!  The chicken was pleasantly spicy but not overwhelming and that shows that the chef really knows how to work with the ingredients.  The flavors were nicely balanced and the portion was just large enough.  I tried my date's beet salad and although not bad, it wasn't my cup of tea.  It was also my first time eating beets.  The tres leches cake was good but I am not a fan of coffee so when I got to the coffee whipped cream it was a bit off-putting and overwhelming for me.

The best octopus dishes we have had in years.

Cocktails are great here, especially if you like yours slightly (but not too much) on the sweeter side.  Food is good too but not amazing, but maybe our expectations were too high considering all the kudos from eater.com.

* Flama Blanca:  This cocktail deserves all the accolades as the spicy kick of the Thai chilies blended perfectly with the sweet richness of the lemongrass and egg whites.  5/5

* Mr Brownstone:  this starts as straight bourbon so very boozy as first, but as the ice cube melts, more sweetness and ginger becomes prevalent.  Problem is that once you find the right portion of bourbon to sweetness, you need to drink it quickly.  4.5/5

* West Coast oysters:  the lemongrass ice would be great on a hot day, but the portion added to each oyster was inconsistent -- some it was barely noticeable and some it added a refreshing flavor.  Too bad they no longer have a late night Happy Hour.  4/5

* Beet Salad:  deliciously rich and flavorful.  Probably the least healthy beet salad I've had.  4.5/5

* Braised pork belly:  the belly was nicely braided to be so tender, and the fried pigs ears gave a nice constrast.  4/5

* Spicy Vietnamese Curry Chicken:  my husband is Vietnamese and he was puzzled by this dish as it didn't taste like his home land except for the way the chicken thigh was cooked.  Nice kick in the curry.  4/5

* Vietnamese Coffee Tres Leche Cake:  more of a solid chocolate cake than anything else.  The coffee flavor was mild, and we wish there was more tres leche sauce.  But still a good cake.  4/5

If we lived in the area or had reason to be nearby, this would be a good local restaurant but with so many great food options on the Strip and in Chinatown, we aren't in any hurry to come back.",gipgMGX89Jp0jLqJ-y4rhg,4,2,4,LlFPTrOo0Z8DOYEnyYhcgw

First the drink...vietnamese coffee martini. Wow! So good!!!

On to the food. Oysters!! The lemongrass oysters by far my favorite! Salmon skin tacos were not my favorite but it was definitely worth the try. 

I recommend the pork belly dish. Wow it was amazing! The pork belly melted in my mouth and was full of flavor. The steak was pretty normal, nothing too special.

Let's start with some good beer and a bourbon cocktail. And have that with the Bao Sliders. Two little sliders with a side of lotus root 'fries'. Perfect starter portion. Definitely taste that Viet notes.

Tried the Salmon Clay Pot and the Short Ribs for the main event. The portion was perfect, not stingy but you don't feel sick after eating the whole thing. The salmon was cooked well with the crispy skin and not too dry, sitting on farro and veggies. Only thing is too much sauce at the bottom making the last couple bites a bit salty. The Short Ribs were cooked well and served with Gnocchi and veggies... cleaned the plates.

Only one option for dessert.. as our server calls it, the Vietnamese take on Tres Leches. Unfortunately... not impressed. There's nothing Asian about it except the mint leaves. The cake is very dense and chocolatey. The ""bird's nest"" chocolate piece on top of the cake is hard to break. I'm a dessert lover and chocolate lover for sure, but this wasn't the best way to end my meal.

I've tried many items on the menu and my favorites are the adorable bao sliders, the west coast oysters (the r month rule has been shucked recently if you hadn't heard), the mesculn greens salad with charred  apricot, the short rib, and the hanger steak. 

The hanger steak is the very best I've eaten anywhere, including my own kitchen, and I can make a mean steak. The combination of the meat with the street corn is incredible. And speaking of incredible, that's also how I would describe the short rib, and the ratatouille and yucca gnocchi it's served with. Ideal scenario is for my husband to order one and let me order the other so I can have a little bit of both, because after having both, I don't want to have to choose!


Service is excellent; the staff is super attentive without being obtrusive. The Common Law cocktail is spectacular, and the wine list is fantastic.

I went again last nite for the 3rd time, mainly bc I got the night off and they added a new salad I needed to have in this heat! 
So, I went at the end of HH and had a few oysters and their house cocktail, The Sunburn. Perfect for the heat! Followed up with the new Heirloom Tomato, Watermelon, and Burrata salad. Then the Hanger Steak. 
The salad was everything I was looking for! A perfect blend of flavors and freshness! It was bright and fresh and the burrata added the cream aspect! I would go back today to do it again! Steak wise.... yes, yes, yes. It was perfectly cooked and the potatoes and summer corn were amazing! This subtle coconut cream with cilantro were just perfect.  
I am so happy to have this place so close to my home! Thank you Chef Jamie! Thank you Andrew Hooper! 

Being that I went on the first nite open, I can't give it 5 stars yet, however, I have nothing but good to say! First, the setting itself is welcoming and comfortable and upscale, while still being non pretentious and welcoming to the neighbors. I love the decor and color scheme! I stared at the bar for happy hour, while waiting for my friend to join for dinner. I had a $3 craft beer and a half a dozen fresh oysters! I chose 3 with mignonette and 3 with their lemongrass ""sauce"". I'm glad I let the bartender convince me to order the lemongrass ones, bc they were even better than the classic ones! 
Once my friend arrived, we got a table and moved to the dining room. 
We hadn't intended to eat an entire meal so we ordered the tuna tartare, hamachi crudo, house pickles, and the green salad. Every bit of each of these dishes was fabulous. Great flavors all around. I could eat a few orders of that tartare! We needed up ordering the slow cooked short rib, on the server Riches recommendation. SO glad I we did! I never would have ordered that without prompting and it was great! The gnocchi was yucca based and so tasty. We rode ed a couple glasses off their happy hour, followed by an Amazingly priced Planta Cerasiolo DI Vittoria. What a great dining experience! Everyone from the owners who greeted me, to the bartender, to our server Rich, gave us such genuine friendly service. Chef Tran even came out to talk to us after our meal!

2420476,2017-06-13,0,iFCz-xI7CV98fcaB4Chh3g,"Hm I was pretty excited to check out black sheep when some friends told me about it. 

Online pictures of their menu looked pretty good and promising at first to us.

We came around happy hour times at 5:00pm and ordered a couple oysters to start off. I'm very..ehem, VERY picky when it comes to oysters. If I get a tint of fishy taste I don't think I really enjoy them at all. Especially after having such an amazing fresh oyster experience in San Francisco, I just can't seem to find a place as good.

The oysters at black sheep aren't the most perfect ones, they're mediocre id say, but the thing I didn't like about them is that they were really salty; probably because they sit in a bed of salt for presentation. But it really distracted me from enjoying their sauces or really much of anything., even when I tried to rinse them off with my water.

Next I also tried the whole trout. The char is pretty good and has a nice flavor sauce on it. It was probably the best part of the dish, but I felt the trout didn't taste as fresh as I was initially expecting. It sort of had a little bit of a frozen fish taste to it. But it wasn't bad I suppose overall. It also comes served with a bowl of rice and in a pretty decent sized portion for what you pay.

A friend of mine ordered the chocolate cake dessert towards the end of our meal. It had a decent flavor and wasn't too sweet which is a nice touch considering that chocolate can be overwhelmingly sweet at times, but I felt the texture was a little hard for a cake. I guess I was expecting a more soft and moist cake,so it was very different.

The last thing I remember trying was one of their cocktails which isn't offered on happy hour, called the sunburn. This was probably one of my favorite orders. It had a nice light refreshing taste and very present grapefruit citrus note. It's nice and sweet for a summer sipper.

Our service was pretty good as well, both our host and server were polite in refilling our water cups and the owner came back to check up on us and inform us about their menu maybe 3-4 times.

I felt black sheep was a pretty good place to try if you've never experienced it, but taste wise I didn't really think it was all there for me unfortunately.",oJV6f25IK_UeghoFmalPvA,2,0,3,3if9tc9FEZ5Jmz11JIkK0A

Highlight was the Lemongrass Jerk Chicken with papaya salad, nice and bold with refreshing texture and acidity. 
Salmon Clay Pot didn't have quite the dimension of the chicken but was well prepared and though slightly over smoked table-side very enjoyable. Peach and mesclun salad was solid, addition of vinaigrette to tendon crisps is a nice touch.

When you think American ""small plate"" appetizer, you're probably thinking decent size portion. Black Sheep delivers great tasting and great presentation, but under delivers with portions for the location. I wouldn't question the portions if this were on the Las Vegas Blvd. It just doesn't make sense for a suburban area. 

The Lost Word...The Last Word cocktail was great as it was refreshing and evenly balanced with the food ordered. 

The dessert was Tres Leches and Brownie. Similar to the apps, the presentation was beautiful, but nothing about the two were a wow factor. Truthfully, it tasted like an average brownie and tres Leches cake plated with beautiful garnishes.

Literally, this place is located right behind my condominium complex and I couldn't be more ecstatic every time I have an excuse to go. Which, is basically when any of my friends come in from out of town.

It's a little bit on the pricier side, but for what you get, it is well worth it. It's a restaurant you'd expect to see in one of the hotels on the strip, so it does come with the strip mentality price tag. However, their happy hour serves up fine dining food for half the cost! $1 oysters make me HOLLLAAA!!! Plus, if you're ""boujee"" like me, you love to feel fancier than you really are. Like I said, I live next door; so instead of a limo, I get to walk my happy butt there.

Boujee (definition found on Urban Dictionary):

High class, flossin', ballin'. One who possesses swag. Elite, rich.


First course, I highly recommend trying their Vietnamese Imperial Rolls or their Bao Sliders... or just say screw it and get both! Both accommodate to completely different taste palates. Every time you bite into one of the crispy, flaky rolls it tastes like you are skipping through a meadow of goodness. As for the sliders, every time you bite into these little, doughy stacks, it makes you feel like you're in a Sir Mix-A-Lot music video and will have you looking at your server when they ask if you are done saying, ""Unless you got buns, hun.""

Second course (yes, this is a three course kinda restaurant, bare with me), their menu is ever-changing, but so far my favorite has been the Grilled Verlasso Salmon that comes served in a clay pot. Once you take the top off and the piping hot steam hits your face, you'll think you were at a spa retreat. If only you could get a facial and the best meal of your life at the same time. Someone look into opening a place like that, and remember to give me a shoutout on Yelp!

Third and final course, is dessert. Now I'm not much of a chocolate person (yes, you read that right), but their Chocolate Tres Leches is to die for. I am a huge sucker for mint anything and I think that the mint pairs perfectly with the dish making it a light dessert after having two courses prior. Cause we all know we always think we have room for dessert but never do once it comes out and is placed in front of us. The hardened chocolate on top kinda looks like a birds nest. But don't let it fool you into thinking you're going to eat it like a bird... Nope, you'll be scraping your spoon across the plate to get every last bit of the vanilla whipped cream.",RE3rs-sETuqKtNGDcC8fqw,0,0,5,nftLymIFri8eLZJLQ2c5XA

I liked this place.  I went here with my fiance for Restaurant Week, but we priced out the menu and figured it was a better deal to just order what we wanted.  We ended up order oysters, the Hamachi Crudo, the Chicken Wings, the Heirloom Salad, Slow Cooked Short Rib, and the Jerk Chicken.  

The oysters were good, had a nice fresh flavor and were reasonably priced.  The Hamachi Crudo was excellent.  The Chicken Wing was the entire wing that was smothered in a fish sauce / sesame oil mixture common of Vietnamese / Thai flavors.  It was a strange dish.  I was hoping for a fried chicken wing tossed in a sweet chili sauce, so this was a bit disappointing.  However, the taste was interesting and the chicken was cooked properly.  Finally, the Heirloom salad was very good.  I would order the Crudo and the Heirloom salad again.

As for the entrees, the Slow Cooked Short Rib and the Jerk Chicken were both overcooked and dry.  These both were simply execution errors.  The Short Rib needed more braising liquid as the bottom of the short rib was excellent.  However, the top and middle were dry and unpleasant.  As for the Chicken, it was dry throughout the entire chicken.  The jerk sauce is very similar to the one used by DW Bistro.  Neither dish were memorable and I would not order either one again.  

All in all, I'm a fan of the restaurant.  The flavor profile of the food is interesting and I enjoyed the dishes that were cooked properly.  I would return again to try different dishes on the menu.  It is a good neighborhood restaurant that has excellent service and you can see the inspiration in the menu.  That's worth 4 Stars.  :)",7cgp0EXG11v-y4F6sDU1hg,0,0,4,g7qSi7kSOPd4U2w0nLrc8w

This place is small, so I highly recommend making a reservation. With that said, because it is small, the atmosphere is lovely. Intimate and welcoming; perfect for date night! 

The cocktails...if you are looking for a delicious drink with a spin, then this is the place for you. I ordered the Mr. Brownstone. Bourbon and ginger with herbs. They put a simple syrup infused ice cube, and slightly melt the cube with a torch before pouring in the bourbon. As the cube melts, the cocktail flavor becomes more delicious. It was fantastic! 

For an appetizer, we ordered the beef crisps. Holy the cow, these are like pork rinds but a million times better. They put a garlic and citrus oil to finish, and it's just a flavor explosion of joy. I could have eaten about a 5lb bag of these, if that was an option! 

I ordered the short ribs with the polenta for the main course and my husband got the chicken curry. Both were extremely flavorful and beautifully presented. Short ribs are beyond melt in your mouth, and just fall apart. Served with some sort of marinated pear and greens. I literally cleaned my plate. The chicken curry comes with veggies and lentils. It's a little spicy, but absolutely delicious. I'm not a fan of spicy, but stole a few bites and it was tolerable even for me. The taste is just so good, you will not even feel the spice. 

We didn't have dessert since we had other plans, but I definitely would have liked to try some. I've seen others complain that the portions here are small, but I disagree. The portions are perfect! Not too small and not too big. You can eat all of the food and not feel stuffed. Just perfectly satisfied and you'll even have room for dessert. I think this is great, because who wants to feel beyond full on a date night? 

Aside from all of this, they apparently change the menu seasonally. I think that is awesome! 100% this is my new date night spot. I will be going back regularly.",fzM6LdoYN5OhLxA4uIGn0g,0,0,5,qRbzCBeitoiqG5aF0jsHKQ

The ribeye in Vine leaf was underwhelming, not much seasoning and flavour it was pretty disappointing for a 46$ plate. It came with some ginger rice which was nice but didn't work at all along the ribeye and the whole plate didn't work as a whole. The high point was the fois gras mousse in a sesame ball appetizer but that came with a really boring salad. The desert was a bit better but still pretty forgettable. Overall it was a lackluster dinner and while everything was well cooked and nothing we had was bad, I think that for the price it should be a lot more exciting.",Y0QhcfVksz1xBm2rTCIg4g,0,0,3,97jc7n6gBuF9UVaQj_PX8w

Black Sheep has been one of the most buzzed about restaurants in Las Vegas over the past year and I can see why. The food really is very good. However, the service on the night I went was so poor that I cannot give it more than three stars. Our server's demeanor during our entire experience was so off putting that I don't know if I could ever return. At one point, he actually insinuated that we were taking too long looking at the menu to order our entrees and essentially said ""this is Black Sheep and even though it's a Tuesday night, because we are Black Sheep we are going to be busy and need to get the orders into the kitchen early and need your menus for other guests coming in and oh did I mention that you are at Black Sheep?"" It's a small restaurant and yes, while they were busy all night it's not like hundreds of people were dining there. There was always a huge stack of menus at the hostess stand at all times. So for them to insinuate that they were short on menus was ridiculous. Anyway, while the food was amazing (standouts included the Octopus appetizer and the salmon entree) the service was SO slow all night. Everything took forever - drinks, water refills, food service, clearing our plates, etc. I don't know if being pretentious is part of the shtick at Black Sheep? If so, that's too bad because while the food is good, it cannot make up for the abysmal service and attitude of the staff. There were a few misses on the menu too. The Penicillin cocktail smelled like an old bandaid. Seriously. It was so off putting that we had to send it back. And the dessert we ordered - the chocolate brownie - was mediocre at best.

We tried the hamachi which was just okay, the tuna which I think needs a little citrus to brighten it, the octopus--the texture threw me off but my boyfriend liked it, and lastly the Vietnamese rolls which he thought were too fatty/greasy but I liked. If all of the apps were amazing they'd win me over completely and it would be our go to date night spot since it's off the strip, and just a few freeway exits away from home.

The salmon clay pot and drinks are what killed the night for us. The clay pot was so amazing. We asked the server which of the main dishes he liked best and went off of his recommendation (which we were probably going to order anyway.) Mushrooms and farro are staples in our daily diet but this was just cooked perfectly. The salmon prepared medium rare was so tender and flavorful that I almost thought about ordering another one just to be gluttonous. To drink my boyfriend had two negronies. A rare thing because he's usually very picky with how they're prepared. I had the Green Lightning with matcha and gin, followed by the Sunburn with Hangar 1 mandarin blossom, aperol, & ginger lemonade. Both were really good.

3333549,2017-07-04,0,iFCz-xI7CV98fcaB4Chh3g,"This review is for 4.5 stars.

Black Sheep lives up to all my expectations.  I came during Happy Hour to get an affordable first impression and was not disappointed.  They have 2 Happy Hours each day from 5:00-6:00 and from 10:00-11:00 (close).  They offer $5 wine, $4 beer, and $1 oysters - pretty solid if you're on this side of town.  So obviously I had to try some West Coast oysters with the house spicy cocktail sauce and other oysters with their lemongrass sauce.  The spicy sauce was phenomenal while the lemongrass, although refreshing, was not my type of oyster topping.  I also had the imperial rolls.  I was expecting the typical Vietnamese rolls with the rice wrapped skin, but these came deep fried over a tasty salad.  I really enjoyed the dish but was just perplexed when it was served as it resembled more of an egg roll than a spring roll.  I really wanted to try the pork buns that Black Sheep is already known for across town, but they were sold out at 10:00pm on a Monday night; this is the main reason I'm knocking off half a star.  The service was exceptional, the company at the bar was fun, and the wine was very good for $5.  I will most certainly be back to try the buns so will update my review if they're as good as I'm expecting.  But overall, on my first experience, I am very excite about Black Sheep and hope that more restaurants of this style and class open on the Westside.",JaqcCU3nxReTW2cBLHounA,0,0,4,YCxXm1Rj0kTfEAB7ldkk3A

3352545,2017-10-18,0,iFCz-xI7CV98fcaB4Chh3g,"I tried this place when they first opened and I wasn't impressed with their food, which was a shame because I loved the way the restaurant is set up and the overall decor. It felt intimate and upscaled, but still had a local vibe. I didn't plan to come back, but I'm glad I did as my second visit was a much better experience. 

My first visit, I got to try their happy hour (from 5-6 PM) oysters, which was $1 each. Oysters were great and tasted fresh, so I thought this was a good deal. They didn't have many drink selections for happy hour. One white wine, one red wine, and a couple beers. I had the red wine (a pinot noir) for $5 and one of the beers for $4. I also tried their hamachi crudo (no longer on menu per my second visit) and disliked this dish immensely, as it was very fishy. The crackers and whatever dressing they put on it didn't add anything to the dish. I've never had hamachi that was that fishy, so I'm glad they took it off their menu. Last, I tried their slow cooked short rib, which was tender but very bland. They asked for a feedback, so we told them that the short rib was bland and they got us another one, but it was pretty much the same taste wise. Service was awesome though, as they readily tried to fix it. Anyway, from my first visit, I thought the food was not that great for the price (entrees are around $18 - $25).

I went for my second visit last weekend by chance, as the original place my friend and I wanted to try didn't have its liquor license yet. Being it's the weekend, we needed our drinks on, so we went here instead. We shared the Mediterranean octopus, braised pork belly, and curry chicken. The octopus was made like a calamari, so even though the flavor of the sauce was good, I still much prefer my octopus to be simply prepared, either raw or just grilled. That way I can taste the octopus. The way it was made here, I had a hard time differentiating it with a squid. The pork belly was a melt in your mouth, cooked perfectly, very flavorful dish. It came with a cauliflower puree. I though this was a great dish, so I'd definitely recommend it. The curry chicken had a little bit of a heat to it, so since I enjoy it as well since I like spicy food.

For cocktails, I tried the louisville sweet peach (bourbon with peach liqueur) and my friend tried the la flama blanca (shochu based with lemon and thai chili syrup). I think they could've been stronger, but they both tasted good, so I'm looking forward to trying out more of their cocktails. We had the chocolate tres leches for dessert. It's like a denser sponge cake, onto which they poured some condensed milk. I liked it, as it's not too sweet. Nothing amazing though.

My second visit was a much improved experience, so I'd give this place a 3.5 stars. Service was great both times. Definitely a great option for a date night!",A5RC8s-n2FEbAR5GRUNHDA,0,0,3,Zyg7wsM_hONiElFbwS9qOQ

My SO got the restaurant week menu which was pretty decent and included that wine pairing! That was great. I forgot what was in the menu, unfortunately because it was his meal. Not a fan of the dessert though, I believe it was a tres leches dessert.

I ordered away from the restaurant week menu though. I got the rainbow trout dish. It really is an entire whole fish with the head and the tail. It didn't bother me! It was delicious but I highly recommend you eat it with the rice! I didn't want to eat rice so I kinda skipped that and I regretted it. It was a bit on the salty side if I ate it without the rice. (I guess that's why they included rice with the dish duhhh!)

Those $1 oysters were pretty awesome too! Happy hour = $1 oysters. Yummmm! I tried all the sauces they had and the jelly was my favorite one. 

Although the service was good, my server talked too much. A little bit too much where it was just uncomfortable. Not like he was being impropriate on conversation, its just we would be socializing with each other and he came up around weird times.

3417750,2017-09-11,1,iFCz-xI7CV98fcaB4Chh3g,"Entering the restaurant comes with a very modern feel to an otherwise unnoticeable lot. Down the plaza from SkinnyFats, a Las Vegas highlight, the restaurant invites a more intimate crowd; black being the covering most of the restaurant's corners. 

Greeted by the host and promptly seated, the service was quick to introduce the menu which consisted of a small but select menu. Unfortunately by no fault of the staff, the restaurant soon became overwhelmed. The full house caused the two waiters and single host to continually divide their attention: I was only able to see the waiter upon ordering and delivering my food, leaving the small glass of water I had continually empty. 

Of the appetizers they had offered I selected the oysters and the sliders. Las Vegas has a plethora of Japanese, Vietnamese, and other Asian fusion that offer oysters; the Black Sheep's was about average at best. The salinity of the oysters were its biggest turnoff (Other than calling Sriracha a ""Rooster Cock Hot Sauce""). The sliders, while small, do pack a delicious bite (Literally one bite). 

My entree was excellent; the slow roasted short ribs upon gnocchi and ratatouille was nothing short of what I had expected from the location. The tangy entree is very balanced and fulfilling. My two dining guests and the hanger steak and the pork belly. While the hanger steak was presented beautifully with the corn, the steak was incredibly average. Though tender, the taste resembled $3 midnight steak from South Point; not bad per say, just not to the quality of flavor that the price point equivocates. The starch pairing with the dish was fantastic however. The Pork Belly tasted about as good as it looks.

The saving grace of the restaurant came from their Tres Leches dessert. The flavors were excellent, playing with a variance of levels of sweetness.

The place essentially gets a three stars due to a myriad of issues. While the place is decent for a meal, I simply did not enjoy the flavors presented in several of their dishes. The server, while incredibly kind and engaging, didn't have enough staff to help him work. Even after hanging in my card for payment, I had to wait an additional 4-5 minutes for it to be swiped out. I really wanted to like the place, unfortunately I can't.",w4ytv-D3eqJ4jesbQA2o9g,0,0,3,bIYWsZdT0zx5x1yjKxOONg

The added flavoursome poached Asian pears is perfectly balanced and add an extra explosion for the senses. I cannot stop thinking about this dish, it was that incredible.

I've dined all over the world at several Michelin star restaurants, this is a chef to watch. The Black Sheep delivers Michelin-starred food without the Michelin snoot or sacraments. The staff is extremely friendly, Oh and by the way I nearly fell off my chair when I got the bill.

3556600,2017-08-27,0,iFCz-xI7CV98fcaB4Chh3g,"A small restaurant in an intimate atmosphere with a modern, and rustic feel.

The Black Sheep has been getting rave reviews, so we decided to pay this restaurant a visit today. I made reservations for 6 and I recommend doing that.

We got there to catch their early Happy Hour which runs from 5-6 pm with $5 wine, $4 craft beers, and $1 fresh oysters on the half shell.  There's also a late 10-11 pm Happy Hour for the night owls.

Here's some of the breakdown of the plates my bf and I shared.

Vietnamese Imperial Rolls - the server mentioned this is the customers favorite. It was fried but the sauces were well- balanced.

Bao Sliders - This is our favorite. The combination of pork sausage and jalapeño aïoli was flavorful and juicy, and the crispiness of the shallot was perfect. I loved the fried quail egg that was paired with!
 
Crispy Mediterranean Octopus - It was good, just not anything special. Doesn't stand out in comparison to the other octopus at other restaurants in my opinion. It would be better not fried.

Chocolate Tres Leches were a little done. The chocolate was overwhelming at first, but then with a little fresh Tres leches butter it all came together and was quite good as a spread.

I wished they had more deserts but this is the only one they had. 

The service was excellent, fast, friendly and efficient.

I am a pretty picky eater, all the food have to be excellent to get a 5 stars rating, I would give a 3.5 on the food but because everything else like the ambiance, music, and service were really pleasant, the place deserves a 4 star. Everyone else in our tables were really pleased on the food they order and we had a great time here.",8dxkcmAXY4ttrVFD1GhbdQ,0,0,4,Thj26K0fNgvOkgeEm0_MIg
3591802,2017-10-27,1,iFCz-xI7CV98fcaB4Chh3g,"I really enjoyed my birthday dinner here :)

First of all, their slow cooked short rib with all it's trimmings is absolutely delicious. Combining the polenta with the Asian pear and the short rib in one bite gave the perfect amount of creaminess to go with the intense flavors of the meat. I'd order this every time.

The clay pot salmon is also very good - some people said it was kind of bland, but I couldn't agree with them here. The salmon is well seasoned and the sauce that sits below the farro mixes well. I'm not a huge fan of farro - it reminds me of barley, but it worked well with the rustic nature of the dish.

Dollar oysters for happy hour is an excellent value, though I can't say my oysters were shucked particularly well. A couple little pieces of shell managed to make it in there and some of the oysters didn't have much brine left over. Still, the oysters tasted fresh and were quite creamy.

We also tried the fried beef crisps which were kind of like pork rinds to me. While relatively plain in flavor, the sauce they drizzle over it is an excellent accompaniment and brought the dish together.

Dessert was their chocolate tres leches - a very tasty tres leches, but was honestly lacking in the chocolate flavor that I was looking for. Don't get me wrong, the milk flavor is beautiful but the chocolate aspect of it seemed to be a little bit lost if it wasn't for the chocolate crisp topping.

Our server was quite attentive and answered all our questions with a lot of honesty, which I appreciate. He swayed us towards a couple choices and his recommendations were spot on. The only thing I might say is he almost over-hyped some of the stuff so our expectations were possibly too high (mainly for dessert). But he was spot on about the short rib!",KbwOwQZTOfrtaeJdmucALQ,1,1,4,tE-37Zfrkw6qtjB6mf6Y4g

We had:
Starters
-salmon skin tacos (get these! We had 2 orders - they are small, but plated so well and amazingly tasty!)
-Vietnamese imperial (pork and shrimp spring) rolls (great flavor combination, served in a bed of frisee salad)- no dipping sauce, but none needed
-octopus (excellent spicy sauce with asparagus and brilliant plating)
-bao sliders (so tasty, quail egg and aioli adding great moisture- bun is nothing special, but that wasn't why we ordered the sliders anyway)

Entrees
-salmon entree (tasted fine, but not my favorite of the night.  The accompaniments- red quinoa, tomato, a green were tasty
-slow cooked short rib (so tender, with just a few (wish there were more!) kimchi cucumbers, and dumplings)

Desserts
-warm brownie with marshmallow, chocolate, raspberry, pecans (which is sort of a deconstructed brownie- brownie with marshmallow on top and the other parts are scattered around the plate and your goal is to eat a bite with all the components- quite nice!)
-Tres Leches with Vietnamese icing and regular white icing on the side (not nearly as sweet or chocolatey as the other dessert, but lovely and simple and a nice ending to a fine meal)

Highly recommended.  We booked reservations weeks in advance as we read about Jamie Tran and didn't want to miss her in action during a recent visit to Vegas.  Now I look forward to following her in the future.

Price point is very affordable- most starters are ~$8-12 and many entrees ~$23.  Don't miss this restaurant- well worth coming off the strip.  Or if you are a local, you're just lucky... go and enjoy her culinary genius tonight! (And then again tomorrow, because I would!)

3608452,2017-12-26,2,iFCz-xI7CV98fcaB4Chh3g,"Perhaps the reviews I read on here prior to visiting the Black Sheep raised my expectations a tad too much. 

CUSTOMER SERVICE: Let's start with good ol customer service, I'd say the staff in general were all very friendly. Pretty basic and nobody is going to go the extra mile if not need be, and I get that. I went to black sheep on a very busy Friday night, with my mom who has severe back problems, when we walked in all the tables were taken so we sat at the bar. However I made it clear to the host we needed a table so my mom could be comfortable, my wishes were acknowledged. About 15 minutes later, two tables clear up, I'm confident they're gonna move us to a table, they cleaned them off and everything. Still nothing, so finally, after 10 mins of staring at the empty tables, we spoke up, asked about being seated at an open table... and apparently this was unheard of to the host. Come on dude this isn't a ground breaking idea here... that left me a tad bit confused. But we were moved. 
GRADE: C+

FOOD: So after I had to fight for a table, I'm thinking ""okay the foods gonna be bomb though "" so who cares about anything else. Started off with their octopus appetizer, which was easily the best and maybe one of the more creative ways I've had octopus, fried up perfectly, on a tangy curry sauce. Also had an apple salad which was a bit bland to me, just had greens, cranberries, and dressing..needed some more to it, maybe cucumbers? Both my mother and I were in the mood for steaks so we got the two different cuts provided. I had the flank steak dish which comes with rice (I'm not crazy about rice) I asked to possibly substitute my rice with... wait for it... POTATOES! Absolutely unheard of right?! When I asked the waitor looked at me like I was crazy so he explained ""the chef doesn't normally change her dishes for anybody buy I'll ask"" I knew then it wasn't gonna happen. So I took the rice, since this MASTERFUL dish was created this way by the chef. Here I get my steak and rice (it's as stupid as it sounds) and this I will say... 
the PRESENTATION at the Black sheep is STELLAR, if you like to take pics of your food this place is pic friendly. 
Back to my steak and rice, with greens on the side... it was average at best, I'm gonna go on a limb and say the presentation got more attention than the flavor of the dish itself. I'm still trying to figure out what about this dish was so concrete that the rice  (served aside) couldn't be substituted. I actually thing my Brownstone cocktail (cube of torched brown sugar garnished with thyme) was more mind blowing. 
GRADE : C+

Atmosphere : Last but certainly not least, located in a pretty busy plaza when you go inside the Black Sheep you certainly forget the outside. Great decor and music make you want to take a seat, the only downside is the actual space in the restaurant. But it's great for a date night since its dimmed lights and cozy. Really nice place to grab a drink. 

Overall, I feel this restaurant is decent. Whether its HANDS DOWN better than SkinnyFats or Plantones (both in the same plaza) is debatable to me.

Our server Danielle was very specific when she explained the dishes we had questions about. 
My partner ordered the Hangar steak and I ordered the Lemongrass jerk chicken. We ordered our son the Bao sliders with lotus chips. For our drink, we ordered the Mr. Brownstone. 

When our food came out the presentation was nice and everything looked good. I took a bite of the chicken and realized the bone was in. I was waiting for an amazing flavor to hit me but it tasted like regular chicken. The papaya salad that it came with was nice and refreshing. My dish was disappointing for me because it's something I feel can be cooked at home. For $18 it wasn't worth it. 

My partners' hangar steak was medium rare, pink and bloody. I took a bite of her steak and it had no shocking amazing flavor. It was just chewy meat. She wasn't too impressed with her meal. $25 and nothing amazing. 

My son had the Bao sliders, it was cute and small for him. The perfect size for him. The slider had a breakfast sausage patty with a thin slice of Chinese sausage and quail egg. We ordered it as plain as can be since he's picky. He enjoyed it.

Our server (Danielle?) was amazing, her personality is one of the best ive ever encountered in the service industry. She deserves a raise or promotion lol

For drinks we ordered La Flama Blanca and also the Vietnamese coffee martini.
La Flama blanca was refreshing and it had some spice to it that lingered. I really liked it.
Ive had Vietnamese coffee before and i figured id like the martini and i did. Imagine a bailies but better. 

For apps we got: 

pickled veggies, i loved these. I actually enjoyed them in between bites because the taste almost cleansed my palate. 

Calamari, this is just an average breaded calamari. I can do without it next time.

Bao sliders, wow yum. The bao sliders were so soft and tasty. Especially the side of chips it comes with. They were small but they are apps so. I would like to try them with a sauce on the bun though because at times it was a little dry. 

For entrees we got:
Short rib, wow this was delicious. Id order it again. The baby pears that got poached in red and wine were so good. The short rib itself was tender,melt in your mouth.

Trout, its a whole fish, deboned. Which is amazing. However i felt it had way too much sauce, it overpowered the whole dish. I was disappointed that i was given forbidden rice instead of white rice (because they were out of white rice?) 

I was also disappointed that they were out of salmon skin tacos. I hear its a popular item. They should stock up.

For dessert we got an off menu item, horchata creme brulee with pumpkin gelato. It was tasty but for myself, too rich.",T4S0tAaQR6elsMtWTIc__g,5,1,4,bfCjOy6-zJvR6Ql9T44hGg

The decor of this restaurant is so different and unique. Love the huge wall with the decorative places. There is a good sized bar and enough tables to accommodate large parties. Our bartender was a sweetheart and I loved that she recommended her favorite dishes because every single one of them did not disappoint. 

We tried a variety of drinks however my favorite was the ""La Flama Blanca"" - great choice for those who like a little spicy. 

My other favorite drink was the Green Lightning - Matcha tea infused gin. I'm not usually a gin drinker but this really hit the spot. 

For food:
Oysters - must get because on top of the oyster is a lemongrass Thai chili kind of jelly that's just so different - it's like an explosion of flavor in my mouth. 

Ahi tuna tar tar - 3 pieces, the tuna was well marinated and the texture was silky smooth on top of the crispy rice. 

Vietnamese Imperial Roll - 4 pieces of spring roll deep fried. The inside is pork and shrimp and it's extra extra crispy which I love. 

Bao Sliders - who doesn't love the white fluffy bun? It's a pork sausage patty and the jalopeño aioli was so good I wanted to ask for an extra side of the sauce. The lotus chips are very thinly slices and crispy. 

Rainbow Trout - my FAVORITE dish. Don't worry about the bones because chef de-bones it for you. The sauce is to die for. It's a ginger and rice vinegar sauce and I'm going to be dreaming about it for forever because I would like to make this sauce at home. 

And finally for dessert, this chocolate brownie madness - I forget what it's called but the cake is so moist and on top of that, they drizzle condensed milk all over. One bite and I wanted the plate to myself. This is not for sharing. Everyone needs to get their own.

3877266,2018-01-24,4,iFCz-xI7CV98fcaB4Chh3g,"Everyone seemed to give rave reviews to The Black Sheep when it first opened and ever since it won Eater Vegas' ""Best New Restaurant,"" category this past year, even more praise was heaped on this new Vietnamese fusion restaurant. The thing with many Asian fusion restaurants is that it attempts to gentrify the food with pretty plating and an increased price tag at the cost of portion size. Nevertheless, there were a few menu items that I really enjoyed.

The starters have a couple of favorites of mine including the salmon skin tacos and the bao sliders. The salmon skin tacos are an ingenius way of wrapping salmon tartare with a crispy salmon skin taco. Topped off with tobiko, micro cilantro, and smoked shishito peppers, this is everything that I envision fusion to encompass. Three small tacos for $8 is quite reasonable. My other favorite was the bao sliders, which come with two house made pork sausage, topped with a fried quail egg, shallots, and jalapeno aioli. Many times, people rely on the fatty flavor of pork belly to carry the bao, but the pork sausage, with the egg and aioli really made for a great flavored slider. I almost forgot that I also loved the fried beef crisps with table side pouring of the chili lime sauce. This was an appetizer that made you want to keep on snacking. 

When it came to the entrees, I really was disappointed by the portions. The Vietnamese curry chicken came with one single piece of chicken thigh. Priced at $18, you could get an entire bucket of KFC for that. The flavor was reminiscent of home cooking. I get it, it's a nice restaurant, but seriously, a single chicken thigh for $18. As for the slow cooked short rib, I was more impressed with the alcohol-infused poached pears than the short rib itself. 

The tres leches chocolate cake for dessert is probably the most photographed item on the entire menu. I was impressed by the bird's nest-like aesthetic, but it was just that. The flavor was one-dimensional, which could've used some nuts, citrus flavors, or coconut shavings in my opinion. I'm glad to see Vegas having these types of restaurants, which seem to be successful in up and coming neighborhoods such as the Southwest, but by California standards, it would ultimately be average at best.",fgkJ6KUlrmbKyLDQervxsw,10,5,3,1PtHbJdr20OmYfOBXA1FDQ

We were here for happy hour which was from 5-6pm. They have $1 oysters and $5 glasses of wine. Yes, please. But let me tell you, this isn't even the best part. The food is amazing. We started off with three of the appetizers. We wanted to try as much as possible. Salmon skin tacos. The skin is the taco shell filled with salmon belly tartare, tabiko, smoked shishito peppers, and micro cilantro. The difference in the texture here was the thing. The crispness of the skin shell opposed to the softness of the tartare. There wasn't a ton of flavor here, but it is definitely a unique dish that I am glad I tried. We also had the imperial rolls. Think Vietnamese egg rolls. The sauce these are laying in on the plate was divine. They were so yummy, I could have eaten a whole plate of them. Lastly, we tried the bao sliders with pork sausage, fried quail egg, crispy shallot, and jalapeño aioli. They also came with a side of lotus root chips. I love when I get to try something I have never had or even heard of before. I am telling you these should be a thing. The buns I am told are made in house daily and are pillowy and delicious. My problem here was the fennel in the sausage. It was overwhelming. I will admit, I am not a fennel fan so maybe this was more the issue. The jalapeño aioli and lotus chips were really good though and saved the whole thing for me. For my entree I had to have the braised Duroc pork belly. It came on a bed of cauliflower purée, sautéed kabocha squash, and crispy pig ear on top. This meal was one of the best I have ever had. The pork belly was absolutely the most tender and delicious I have ever had anywhere. The flavors here all worked together and I could not have been more pleased. My friend had the spicy Vietnamese curry chicken. It was a chicken thigh with lentils, potatoes, and carrots. She loved it! She said the spice level was perfect. Our server Danielle was a real professional who was personable and friendly and only added to the wonderful night. We will absolutely be back the next time we are in town. They run on a seasonal menu so we will be excited to see what is offered next time. I highly suggest you get there and soon!",wrZ81OY3ss8YpWSa4HgIYQ,0,1,5,aDEEBEYlDPYLJNT-gEdj5g

We got:
--oysters w/ spicy rooster cocktail sauce, which were good but I feel like should've come on ice to keep chilled.
--vietnamese rolls: yummy fried deliciousness, kind of small portion though.
--clay pot salmon: I really loved this dish! the eggplant/farro/plum beneath it was so good and brought it all together for me.
--short rib: good, smallish portion, squash ratatouille was yum!
--chocolate tres leches sponge cake: the BEST. loved how refreshing it was with the mint and just an overall nice-but-not-overwhelming way to end the meal. 

Presentation was nice, pleasant service and they were accommodating about letting us move tables away from a large party of people.

What I didn't like:
Small menu, small portions, and small area overall- not many seats. The smallness also made it SO loud inside which really bothered me- they could invest in some soundproofing as all the surfaces seemed to be pretty echoey.

3972845,2017-06-24,6,iFCz-xI7CV98fcaB4Chh3g,"Review is for Restaurant Week 2017 menu.

The Black Sheep is a relatively small place on Warm Springs that I found while checking the Restaurant Week listings.  I made a reservation but they were unable to find it.  There was no cause for alarm as it was early and there were plenty of tables available without taking one at the bar.  (The reservation was later found and the gentleman told me about it so I would know I did indeed make the reservation.)  This was the beginning of what was to be excellent service and attention paid by the people in charge to make sure their guests were enjoying their  food and that your being there was appreciated!

Items ordered along with their menu descriptions:

Vietnamese imperial rolls - Duroc Pork & Shrimp, Pickled Heirloom Carrots, Garlic Citrus Vinaigrette
Slow cooked short rib - Yucca Gnocchi, Summer Squash Ratatouille
Chocolate tres leches - Chocolate Sponge Cake, Condensed Milk

All meals for Restaurant Week were served with wine pairing for each course.  I don't drink so they did two things for me.  There was no charge for my iced tea and they brought me a bowl of house made lotus root chips that were absolutely addictive.  They were very thinly sliced pieces gently fried and salted.  A good starter to munch on while awaiting my appetizer.

The imperial rolls had a thin coating of gently fried batter around the pork and shrimp ""sausages.""  The garlic citrus vinaigrette was excellent and added so much to this simple dish.  The short rib was tender and could be pulled apart just using your fork.  The yucca gnocchi need some work as they were not soft at all.  The summer squash ratatouille was very good with the short rib.

The chocolate tres leches needs work too or it needs a change of name.  While it is a sponge cake and it was a bit moist on the inside, it doesn't come near being what tres leches cake should be.  It was quite firm.  There was a chocolate ring on top and the server poured white chocolate sauce over the chocolate ring.

My server was Shepherd and he was very good.  As I said at the beginning of the review, service was superb here.  Someone was coming by often checking to make sure everything was OK.  A few changes in the cooking would rank this as a 5 star place in my estimation.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,23,13,4,saCXuoTikHdZ81RkjlUhDQ

For our next course, we got the salmon skin tacos and bao sliders, both delicious. We got the short ribs to split as an entree, it was AMAZING; tender and flavorful. The dumplings that came with it were fantastic. For dessert, we got the tres leches and again, it was fantastic.

4108200,2017-09-22,9,iFCz-xI7CV98fcaB4Chh3g,"This ain't yo mama's fish sauce, noodles, and chopsticks traditional Viet food, but it's just as good.

The Black Sheep is a relatively new, dinner-only restaurant with Vietnamese ""fusion"" cuisine and an alcohol-forward menu. It's nestled in the corner of a plaza with neighbors ranging from local gems such as SkinnyFATS and Plantone's to casual chains including Carl's Jr and Roberto's Taco Shop, so parking can get tough at peak meal hours. However, it wasn't packed at 7:30pm on Thursday night, and we had our group of 5 seated easily without needing a reservation.

I'd been looking forward to trying more of Chef Jamie Tran's cuisine ever since enjoying her offerings at the recent Hopped Taco Throwdown (my review: https://www.yelp.com/biz/elite-perk-hopped-taco-throwdown-las-vegas), but first I was cajoled into trying some cocktails by our loquacious waiter.

Green Lightning ($9): matcha infused Russell Henry gin, lime simple syrup, cardamom bitters. I ordered this for the variety of flavors, and unfortunately the matcha and cardamom were either too light or simply overpowered by the gin and lime syrup. I did enjoy the cocktail nonetheless.

La Flama Blanca ($9): Kai Lemongrass Shochu, spicy Thai chili syrup, lemon simple syrup, egg whites. Took a sip of my friend's, and the chili carried strongly but didn't cling to my palate. Tasty overall, so I would definitely consider ordering it next time for myself.

Mauritius Lychee Martini ($12): Absolut Vodka, Housemade Lychee Simple Syrup, Dynasty Mauritius Lychee. A very simple cocktail that didn't really taste sweet enough, but the essence of real lychee fruit carried through.

We got into the food not long afterward. For simplicity, I'll list them all consecutively (this time omitting full ingredient lists, which can be seen on the web site or photos), but we got the appetizers at roughly the same time after the cocktails, followed by a rather distinct period of conversation (read: waiting), and then a simultaneous entree presentation.

Fried Beef Crisps ($6): surprisingly fantastic appetizer, with dried beef tendons taking the place of pork rinds in what otherwise strongly resembles chicharrones. However, this version is much lighter and more airy while retaining an excellent crunchiness.

Crispy Mediterranean Octopus ($11): surprising letdown of an appetizer. I wouldn't describe it as very crispy outside, and the inside skewed far toward mushy rather than simply tender. The curry-esque sauce was fine, but I wouldn't get this again based on the mouthful of a bite that I took.

Bao Sliders ($9): juicy, medium-rare pork (seriously) patty is the star of this slider-shaped, Taiwanese-inspired dish that does have a fairly Vietnamese flavor mix. Definitely second-best appetizer out of what we decided to try.

Ahi Tuna Tartare ($12): it's a pretty good rendition of a popular sushi restaurant appetizer, but it feels overpriced for what amounts to spicy tuna atop a rather inexpensive-looking Vietnamese puffed rice cracker. Props to the chef for captivating others though.

Braised Duroc Pork Belly ($18): I only tasted parts of my friend's entree, but to the restaurant's credit, they nailed this and all subsequent proteins. This tender and fatty pork belly is definitely among the best in town, and the chicharron was good, although I would've appreciated a less mushy rice.

Scottish King Salmon ""Clay Pot"" ($23): let's just say that the technique is quite a departure from clay pot cooking, so thanks for the double quotation marks. This was my entree, and I loved every bite. The salmon itself was super tender and moist, the crispy skin was spectacular, the eggplant was remarkably savory, and the farro was surprisingly addictive. Applewood smoke lightly permeated and enhanced all components. I would've cleaned my ""bowl"" had they presented me with a spoon to use, but a fork and knife aren't really the right shape for the job.

Slow Cooked Short Rib ($20): our waiter billed this as so tender you could cut it with the dull knife edge, and he was right. On top of that, they instilled plenty of flavor, including a proper salt level. The squash ratatouille was also delicious. I'll probably have to order it for myself next time rather than tasting a friend's plate so that I can get to the yucca gnocchi and threads.

Decor is upscale / dark-colored but not tablecloth-fancy. Music was surprisingly full of hip-hop tracks, but not loud. I gotta get one of those small portable light sources that are becoming popular with Instagram-aholics. That's how dark it was, and my photo quality and visual enjoyment of the colorful ingredients suffered for it. Maybe that's actually a testament to how delicious everything was?

Although none of what I tasted truly resembled anything traditionally Vietnamese, I loved the meal overall. I found only a few things lacking (octopus and other apps, cocktails, perceived slow pace of meal), and I'll definitely try to return despite price and distance.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,12,11,4,-2kNzHHhyIVvIItDkPnHvg

The experience was above most of the restaurants in the local restaurants and maybe even than the ones in the strip. 

We ordered the emperial rolls and pork belly.
The rolls were very unique and the sauce drizzled was very well-balanced with the crispy rolls. All the garnished veggies on the side went well with the dish as well. I would say it is a great appetizer to go with white wines. Also, their pork belly is a must try. The meat was really tender and the rice was very flavorful as well.

The host was very pleasant, and offered us a seat at the bar.  The bartender not only made amazing cocktails, but was a great server as well.   From the Blonde Negroni to the Vietnamese-coffee-chocolate-dulce del leche cake (seriously!), and the fabulous entrees in between, this little gem didn't disappoint.  The short rib with polenta and poached pears in white AND red wine, and the salmon with forbidden rice were exceptional.  

It's located in a strip mall with several other restaurants, and random businesses, so you won't get the glitz and glam - or the crowds, thank goodness - of the strip.  But that's a good thing!  So take a break from the overpriced buffets, and make your way across town...after you make a reservation. :)",IW5I4zHWXB-ik0RCV8ODzQ,0,0,5,N1Tsf6hAionGGILxQ-0TOg

I had a heirloom tomato and watermelons salad for appetizer. My friend and I both ordered same salad.  I thought it was gonna be too much if we order two since we both ordered steaks for entrees but they were perfect portion. 
For entrees I ordered grass fed rib eye steak.  Wow! Delicious!! My friend ordered hanger steak and he loved his dish as well. 
I was hoping that they had more choices for desserts but they only had two. I'm a big fan of dessert so I was looking forward to dessert list but when I found out both of them are with chocolate. I was little disappointed. Rockey road brownies and Chocolate cake.  But they still taste great it wasn't the best dessert I tasted but still great.

However, I wanted to see if I would have the same feeling while trying their full menu. I was informed that they recently changed their menu and created new dishes. I have to say that the new menu was as good as I remembered it. The drink menu has several unique and tasty drinks. I tried ""la flama blanca"" which had lemongrass and eggs whites. I truly enjoyed the drink as it was very refreshing. For my main entrée we ordered the Vietnamese curry which was very good as well, great flavors and awesome presentation. Please be aware this dish is a bit spicy if you are not used to the heat. 
my 2nd option was the rainbow trout which was perfectly cooked. The fish came all in one piece (head, eyes, teeth lol) but is was a very enjoyable dish.

We've been back 3 more times since I started this review. Apparently the menu changes constantly. The protein stays the same but the prep is different.

Being a snooty foodie in Southwest Las Vegas is tough... there really aren't any upscale restaurants with good food. Pier 215 is probably the closest thing we have to upscale but the food is just A-OK. 

I saw The Black Sheep when I was on a Skinny Fats food run and thought I'd look it up... after seeing the photos and reviews, my boyfriend and I came in for a happy hour to give it a try and  holy shiitake mushrooms was the food incredible!!

The Vietnamese Imperial rolls-- absolutely incredible. Tasty crispy outside with a warm delicious inside.

West Coast Oysters-- Not big weird oysters... succulent smaller treats that are buttery and flavorful with no fishy flavor. (Only $1 for happy hour, score!)

Bao Sliders-- Orgasmic. Don't be afraid of the quail egg, it's just like a regular egg, only smaller. These little sliders have so much flavor it's incredible. One of the best sliders I've ever had. An absolute must try!

Watermelon, Burrata, and Tomato salad-- this too was incredible. Tasty frisee and delicious fresh tomatos. The watermelon... perfect. They could have given a bit more burrata, but I'm kind of a sucker for cheese! Delicious.

Hanger Steak-- Now I've never been a fan of skirt steaks or hanger steaks. TBH, I've always thought they were inferior cuts of meat being peddled as hip, new cuts to try. This hanger steak is the best think to happen to me in EONS! The steak was incredible! Juicy, tender... perfect might not be too strong of a word lol. The sweet corn was also incredible.

This place is fantastic. It's not a cheap dinner, but it's well worth the price of admission. There's no way anybody could ever have a bland meal at this place. Will definitely be returning!!",mYNZLYcnZol-oSfU-WP4CQ,11,4,5,NVIwcQ8DUi2oGk5aDyBMdw

I remember it was a poke bowl spot that didn't last longer than 6 months.  I have to say, I think it's the location and not the right type(poke bowl) for this plaza.  

Last night my husband wanted to eat somewhere before 10 PM.  I was browsing OpenTable and saw that The Black Sheep was still open and only a mile from our house.  I booked it and we came within 15-20 minutes.  Since I booked our table online, when we walked the guy at the front asked me by my first name.  Attentive service since we walked in.  We both really like the vibe here, dim lighting and the music.  Love the decor and how clean it is.  The server was very knowledgable of their dishes with all the ingredients.  This is very helpful for food allergy people.  We ordered a lot of appetizers and one entree.  

SALMON SKIN TACOS (I liked it, husband didn't, he thought the skin was weird.)
AHI TUNA TARTARE (We both loved it, fresh, simple.)
VIETNAMESE IMPERIAL ROLLS (Liked the presentation, but not much flavors, only the strong pickled veggies..it was salty and too sweet for us.)
CRISPY MEDITERRANEAN OCTOPUS (We'll have to try this dish again next time.  The way the server describe it to us, it came out differently.  They took care of this dish for us.  To me it was little chewy, like only battered.  I couldn't really taste the octopus, very char tasting like burnt.  We ate most of it, trying to figure out the ingredients in it.  The curry sauce was super thick, lots of cumin in it.)

FRIED WHOLE RAINBOW TROUT (My husband thinks this dish was ok.  I personally really liked it.  I didn't eat the stuff under the fish, since I'm allergic to soy.  The minimum the soy intake the better for me.  The fried fish part really reminds me of my mother's home cooked dish. It's simple and tasty.)

I had the common law cocktail, it was good, little too sweet for me though.  If I end up getting this one again, I'll ask for less sweeten.

Overall, I'm happy with our choices.  Looks like a great spot to come grab drinks at the bar.  We're looking forward to come here again.",MMxRLgkd-MgwowmggmR2Dg,4,3,5,_4I89TStXgm_USG0igE37w

While this is a hike from the Strip where we were staying, it's worth the ride. This is clearly a place where locals go and the prices are much more reasonable than the casinos, of course.

They had a small but impressive cocktail and wine list, with some unfiltered wines from California that were pretty uncommon.

Across the board, the food was delicious. The standouts were Thai basil shrimp ceviche (very tangy) and the grilled octopus (perfectly cooked). We stuck to a bunch of the appetizers, but the Duroc pork belly entree was a very good dish.

Overall, a great meal and service was friendly. The table kind of wobbly, and even though we didn't ask, someone came around and noticed that and put a piece of wood under the table legs so it didn't wobble anymore.

Tonight we had oysters with lemongrass Thai chili granita, red rooster cocktail sauce. Oysters were fresh but they were in room temperature, the lemongrass chili granita is like a spicy lemongrass jelly than granita. It gave an interesting flavor to the oysters. The rooster cocktail sauce was like chili Sambal sauce mix with cocktail sauce! 
Crispy Octopus was quite good, crispy, crunchy baby octopus with curry sauce! The Bao sliders were small patty with Chinese Sausage, frisée, fried quail egg, and home made Asian style bun/Bao. Wish it had pate in it then it will be a better Vietnamese style. 
For entrees, we had salmon clay pot, pork belly and short ribs. I'm not favor the salmon, missing some quite of sauce. Pork belly was great with mushrooms, stirred fired mustard green, it reminded me of Vietnamese style braised pork( Thit Kho). Short rib had a great flavor with yucca gnocchi.

Good originality and creativity with punchy flavors.  Perfect to pair with a few drinks.

Straight to it, crack chips, AKA beef crisps are a must order. Think chicharons but with the flavor of beef. Instead of skin, air dried tendon, deep fried beef tendon dusted with cayanne. Good alone, great when splashed with the accompanying citrus vinegar sauce.

The bao sliders, a must.  Finally something other than boring braised pork with hoisin.  An in-house made, ""Asian"" flavored pork sausage patty, oily in all the right ways, topped with a fried quail eggs and crispy shallots, greens, all on a bao ""bun"", slathered in spicy jalapeño aïoli.  The pile of accompanying lotus chips so addicting. 

Tuna tartare, would be ordinary if not for the controlled use of a spicy, aromatic chili citrus oil and salt as the only seasoning. Micro cilantro adds a hint of flavor.  Unlike poke, nothing gets in the way of the fishes flavor. Crispy rice crisps, on which the tartare is sat, great texture.

The oysters have bits of lemongrass citrus jelly in each. Zesty and perfectly matches the briny bivalves.

Mains are more straightforward.  The rice flour dusted, deep-fried whole rainbow trout with accompanying ginger and red wine vinegar sauce, solid.. The stand out, Scottish salmon cooked in clay pot. Smoked eggplant is a brilliant foil to the rich fish. The fresh plum salad, refreshes the pallet after every bite. The only thing it could do without is the farro (personal preference).

While not everything is perfect; the imperial rolls, not very crisp and oily, the braised short rib, tender and flavorful but the accompanying gnocchi, pasty and become stodgy with the squash ratatouille, in general very good.

Tip: HH 5 PM to 6 PM with $5 wine, $4 craft beer, and $1 fresh oysters on the half shell. Reverse HH 10 PM to close.

Value priced wine list. Well selected. Well selected craft beers as well.

Very friendly off Strip service.

A great HH spot that rolls seamlessly into a full-blown dinner.

I made a reservation but we ended up eating at the bar because the bartenders we're good company. So many things look great on the menu. Since I wasn't that hungry I went with the highly recommended beet salad which was delicious. The smoke flavoring on the beats was a fantastic twist.

 We also ordered the sliders, unfortunately it only came with two. We could have eaten those all night long. We also ordered the short rib with cauliflower puree. That was excellent as well. 

Here for two nights and eating  at the black sheep both of those nights! That says everything. I would definitely make sure you have a reservation as there are not a lot of tables.",hgrRDhCvo6NUnRPrK-geMQ,0,0,5,oULGl3toWEms7_W1-KgIJQ

They take reservations, and that's always a plus.

Crispy Mediterranean Octopus - The sauce was amazing.
The Hanger Steak
Braised Duroc Pork Belly
The chocolate tres leches cake... Omg. Amazing.

The ambience and decor was very nice. Music was a little intense and kinda loud. Noise level was high. 

We came on a Wednesday just before 9p. The place was full. It's small with about 50 seats total. So we waited about 10 minutes for a table. 

We were seated by the door. The table was very wobbly. The server said he'd do something about it but he never did. My son had to keep his foot on the table stand throughout our meal. The server was nice but not very personable or attentive. 

The appetizers were hit and miss. Wings were delicious but we didn't care for the hamachi crudo or the sliders. Hamachi was bland and the sliders had a weird off putting taste to it. 

Our entrees were a lot better. We had the trout, pork Belly and braised short ribs. All the dishes were flavorful. My favorite was the trout.

""Oh, yeah, where SkinnyFats is, right?"" was the first reaction to a rumor that one of the Las Vegas' best new Restaurants had opened on Warm Springs Road while attention was focused on traveling outside city limits, yet after doing a bit of investigation the rumors quickly found confirmation in the respected palates of Friends and Chefs repeatedly stating that Chef Jamie Tran was turning out Strip-quality Cuisine at a fraction of the price inside a small kitchen at The Black Sheep.

Officially opened on May 16th inside a former Poke place, the constant turnover of Sin City's dining scene making such a thing no surprise, The Black Sheep is part-owned and operated by Boulud and Batali veteran Andrew Hooper who brought on his young Chef from the now closed db Brasserie to reinvent an area long suffering for something of interest, the concept largely Vietnamese American with a 'Comfort Food' focus but a lot of classic French technique.

Currently open only for dinner, though Mr. Hooper confirms that his charismatic Chef arrives as early as 9:00am to begin preparation in a kitchen that is 'no more than 350 square feet,' The Black Sheep follows a model similar to Dan Krohmer's Other Mama in that the menu is well-culled and focused while the Bar Program rivals Strip-based Mixology for pennies on the dollar, the foamy ""La Flama Blanca"" with subdued spice and citrus in a Shochu base already a hit at just $9 while ""The Louisville Sweet Peach"" goes even more artisan with the Bourbon infused with Mint in-house and the Peach Liqueur likewise smoked on the premises.

Still doing the 10+ hour a day routine with a smile on her face, years working with Vincent Pouessel at Aureole and then in the final days of Daniel Boulud's latest Las Vegas failure elevating the Vietnamese recipes learned from her mother to a level that makes them both elegant and accessible, it was largely from Chef Tran's hand that the part self-selected and part-suggested menu was served, a plate of puffed Beef Tendons with Togarashi crave-worthy and nicely spiced despite getting a little soggy beneath the Chili Lime Sauce while the housemade Bao and Pork Sausage 'Sliders' reinvent a stale idea by way of an umami-fest featuring Crispy Shallots, a sunny-side Quail Egg and Jalapeno Aioli.

Playing a great soundtrack throughout the meal, everything from the xx and Vampire Weekend intermixed with Led Zeppelin and The Doors amidst a sleek interior featuring organic flourishes and a wide panorama of a field filled with Sheep, plates three and four were suggested by Chef Tran as two of her favorites, the Vietnamese Imperial Rolls improving on traditional Spring Rolls by way of locally sourced Vegetables pickled in House and a crispy skin that plays well off the slightly funky center while her Ahi Tuna Tartare takes no shortcuts with snappy pieces of Flesh lightly kissed by housemade Citrus-Chile Oil on Rice Crisps.

Separating appetizers from entrees with a Salad, the 'grilled' Peaches unfortunately still a bit too firm and not at all smoky while the Prickly Pear Dressing overwhelmed the rest, those who don't fear a bit of fat are strongly encourage to order Jamie's Braised Pork Belly that deconstructs the idea of Porchetta by presenting the skin as a detached Chicharone atop Forbidden Rice, tender Mushrooms and Mustard Greens as good as anything you'll find down South.

Consistently playing with textures throughout the meal, no two bites ever the same, it was on Andrew's advice that savories concluded with The Black Sheep's Short Rib that puts fork-tender Beef at the center of garden fresh Ratatouille with Yucca Dumplings and Crispy Roots on top, the restaurant's lone dessert taking a similar approach with Dark Chocolate Sponge Cake thoroughly soaked in White Chocolate Milk beneath Fresh Mint and a Chocolate Candy Nest.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,9,5,4,3DXjAFhTKUDasUTIvjUpcg

5349181,2017-10-13,0,iFCz-xI7CV98fcaB4Chh3g,"My husband and I have been wanting to try out Black Sheep ever since it opened but we never had the time. However! My husband had made the request to dine here for his birthday night and whatever the birthday boy wants, he gets!

We got to Black Sheep about 1-2 minutes before their happy hour ended and they were nice enough to continue to honor happy hour prices for us. Happy hour runs from from 5pm-6pm. Their deals include $1 oysters, $5 wines, and $4 bartender's choice beers. They only have one cocktail on the happy hour and it's $6. 

We started off with a dozen oysters, a cocktail for me, and a beer for my husband. Their cocktail of the day was a raspberry mojito and their bartender's choice beer was an IPA. We also got their beef crisps for an appetizer. For entrees, we went with their smoked clay pot salmon and beef short ribs. 

Their oysters tasted really fresh and for $1 each, it's a great deal. The only problem I have is that I wish there were more brine in the oysters and whoever shucked them needs more practice. I forgot what kind of oysters these were but they had a creamy texture to them. They were delicious.

My raspberry mojito tasted really light. If they never told me it was raspberry, I would never have been able to guess what it was. 

The beef crisps are dried thin tendons that are deep fried, sprinkled with Japanese seasoning, and then a lime sauce is poured onto it. They sort of reminded me of the shrimp chips. I really liked the sauce they poured on it but other than that, I don't really care for them. It wasn't mind blowing or particularly memorable. Honestly, just have some chicharron.

The smoked clay pot salmon is a piece of salmon on top of farro. You can definitely smell the smoke. The salmon was delicious. It was perfectly cooked, tender, and juicy. The flavoring is just enough -- not too salty. The salmon does still have the skin and the skin was crispy ... perfect. The farro was not my favorite. I think I would've preferred regular jasmine rice with it. 

The short rib was perfectly done. The meat just falls apart. It was very tender and juicy as well. Their short rib dish contains a bit of Asian influence since they use Asian pears. Despite all that, I've never been a fan of short rib so I can't say that their version of the dish changes my mind. If you're a person that doesn't care too much for braised short ribs, then please don't get it. I'm pretty sure you won't like it.

We also ordered a dessert and it was really delicious. It was like a chocolate sponge cake drizzled in sweet milk. Very easy to eat, not too rich, and yummy.

Overall, their execution on their dishes is good. The quality of their food is good as well. The creativity is a nice twist to what we normally know. However, taste-wise, I feel it could be better. Other than the oysters and the salmon, I didn't care too much for the rest. I would definitely come again for their $1 oysters! :)",oqTZC9WriodTCby6jl0LfQ,0,0,3,U6lA3tzELZTpyvUWSHNIzQ

I ordered the burrata and asparagus salad with grapefruit... it was good but it could have had a lighter citrus dressing instead of a creamy dressing which I think took away from it. I also ordered octopus appetizer. The problem is it was way spicy. My friend who was there with me and loves spicy food said it was even too spicy for her. Just not good.
She ordered the pork belly for the entrée and she liked it. The last time she got the braised short ribs and she liked that too. I tend to like food on the lighter and healthier side so pork belly and short ribs are not attractive to me. I ordered the salmon. It was on top of a bed of sweet quinoa or something similar. The salmon was under seasoned. Had it not been for what was under it, it would have been extremely bland. We did not order dessert. We got there at 5 PM and they told us they had happy hour from 5 to 6 PM which only consisted of oysters and only certain types of wine ($5/glass), specifically three types. I ordered the syrah wine ( a glass) and it was not that great with very little smooth finish. My friend ordered the white blend wine and she said it was OK.
I have now been there twice and can say with confidence that I will not be returning. There are many people that love this place. If you love healthy and light foods, this is not the place for you.

Starters:

Bow down to their ""Bao Sliders"", consisting of pork sausage, fried quail egg, crispy shallots and jalapeno aioli; THIS is an absolute must order.  The pillow-like buns and thin sliver of Chinese sausage combined with everything else it had going on tasted like the best news I'd get all day.  It is a remarkable bite that I totally wish could be made as a full size burger. 

The ""Crispy Mediterranean Octopus"" was another outstanding appetizer with Spanish baby octopus and the amazing lick off the plate purple basil vadouvan  (curry) sauce that shot it up several levels.  Shareability would have improved had there been chopsticks for everyone, which they don't have, which is kinda weird.  

Entrees:

The ""Scottish King Salmon"" is a dish that could easily have been on the menu at Harvest by Roy Ellamar at Bellagio.  Scented farro, smoked eggplant, fresh plum salad with a gorgeously cooked salmon filet (that skin!) sitting on top was superb and arguably the best entrée they offer.   Free parking made it taste even better.  

I detected distinct Taiwanese flavors from the uber tender ""Braised Duroc Pork Belly"" with mustard greens.  The eye pleasing sticky rice encased in a flavorful bamboo leaf that accompanied it was a nice play on the classic ""bah-tzang"" I used to pig out on by the dozen as a kid.   

No one could go wrong with the fantastic ""Slow Cooked Short Rib"" coupled with the summer squash ratatouille, which made for a great flavor combination.  I also fully enjoyed sampling my wife's ""Fried Whole Rainbow Trout"" with sautéed rainbow Swiss chard and ginger/rice wine vinegar sauce.  Big thanks to our server for advising me to eat the fish head!  It was an absolute joy of crunchy fried goodness.  Do it!!

The only entrée that wasn't on the same level was the hanger steak.  Perhaps just having had a magnificent one at Jaleo days before raised my expectations too high. Potato/potahto though!  Clearly there is plenty of stuff to like from this unique eatery and I'll be back for more soon.

Unique cocktail menu is alluring.
The appetizers are all good: burrata salad, ceviche and especially the octopus. Interesting ingredients in unexpected combinations.

I'm not a fan of Vegas, but find myself here at least 3 times a month for work and I'm always looking for an eclectic restaurant/bar off the Strip. No clue why I hadn't book marked this before, but Yelp fixed me up this time!

I was able to get a reservation late on Friday for 7.30, and lucky I did because there wasn't a seat open at the time. The bar seats about 8-10 and will be my next parking spot when I come alone. I had their Mr. Brownstone cocktail, which was basically straight bourbon poured over a sweetened ice cube. I had to chop that sucker up and let it melt, melt, melt, but after that, it was delicious.

Fresh oysters get a choice of 3 sauces and the lemongrass granita was tasty. The tuna tartare was small, but just enough. It was wrapped in a nice little crunch cocoon to make eating with your fingers feasible. The beet salad I had was amazing. There's no way that thing was healthy, doused in a creamy, heavenly sauce, but oh so worth it. My husbands flank steak was cooked perfectly and rather hearty by still left room for dessert. Good move guys! Always make sure there's room for dessert!

Three dessert offerings. My only issue here is that the tres leches cake (and the coffee martini) had sweetened condensed milk-bleh. I bake that cake a lot and refuse to use that crap. I went with the Rocky Road and it was fantastic. Maybe just needed a little extra raspberry sauce, so if you get it, ask for extra raspberry to break up the sweet marshmallow and chocolate.

Service gets an A, he wasn't amazing, but decent. On it, on it, on it, then disappears for a long time. Repeat. The bathrooms are beautiful and, as I mentioned plush, soft toilet paper-yay! I liked the decor in a monochromatic scheme. The place is intimate and parking is tricky in that lot (it's pretty full).

My only recommendation, as I give to many places, is to have a list of mocktails! For those pregnant, recovering alcoholics, or just plain already drunk, it nice to have these fancy choices without feeling left out. Mocktails are all the rage.",EW3jDZFPhUEKPxPMhxLN8A,3,0,5,qK5wJD-lCtnliFuZkHtfRQ

Prices are very reasonable too!

I highly recommend the place. 
We got oysters and salad beets for appetizer; followed by braised rib and pork belly entrees... accompanied by blonde negroni (made with aperol instead of Campari) and old Law tequila. 

The dessert was a Vietnamese coffee cake with Mint and coffee infused ice cream. Truly tasty and not too sweet!

I had three items: salmon skin tacos, the imperial egg rolls, and the tres leches dessert. I enjoyed all three, a lot. The salmon skin tacos were an interesting item that tasted good. The imperial egg rolls were perhaps the tastiest tolls I have had. The dessert was a solid closer.

The service is also very good--I sat at the bar and the bartender (whose name I missed) was friendly and observant.

It is definitely worth checking out.",YE54kKTuqJJPNYWIKIpOEQ,0,0,5,9R4cExb9yauCuSOBnk2w4Q

Overall flavor is on the lite side, if you're looking for something bold full flavor, try the trout. The only thing I don't like about this dish is that they pair the fish with sautéed chard which I think it's powering the whole dish in a bad way. Something like garlic kale sauté with a splash of lemon would be lift the Flavor of this dish way better than chard.",a3yOeL5b0lzbo1ORHF2yHg,2,1,4,U6GqU5LJaF6210Hgq-1iDg

Our sever was fantastic.   At first I thought we weren't going to like him because he started literally describing the entire menu to us but it turned out he was just excited at the fact that a new menu had started that very day.  Turns out he was awesome.   Friendly, helpful and available but not too available.   He never hovered or seemed to rush us.  He even poked his head out the door while we outside and made us laugh. 

The drinks I got were pretty good.   There was one that I think I'd come back to get even if I didn't like the food served.   

Now to the food.   Can I just say...  wow!  Everything we ordered was above average except for one dessert.   There is almost never an occasion where I can't rank my favorite dishes but this was definitely one of them.  If I had to pick a favorite it would have to be the pork belly.   Orgasmic!

I'm definitely going to brag about this place for quite some time so if you're thinking about going.. just do it!",byV70bKT87SHgN0uRtow6w,3,3,5,1QYY2OE-3BPUbmhe463Ohw

Food was fresh and tasty and the variety of offerings is well thought out. I sat at the bar and sampled a multiple of dishes and the service and knowledge of the staff was on point. 

I have to say my favourite thing and my experience was the variety and pricing of the wine list. Well done and I can't wait to return and sample more.",pdTB9kWbH-v4InpFQL3n7g,1,0,5,n5KGSFD6VGkqDqO256DZeg

5902817,2018-02-18,5,iFCz-xI7CV98fcaB4Chh3g,"Black Sheep offers entertaining new flavors, a seasonal menu, and great service.

I RECOMMEND 
Thai chili and lemongrass oysters -- They were surprisingly fresh and a great alternative to the more traditional tasting mignonette. 

Smoky Heirloom Beet Salad -- I'm not even a fan of beets, but this salad turned me into a believer. I love how the earthiness of the beets and the creaminess of the goat cheese play off each other. 

The Pan Seared Scottish King Salmon -- the entree was phenomenal. A perfect medium rare nestled atop of beautifully cooked forbidden rice, flavorful mushrooms, and sauce that balanced the meal perfectly. My boyfriend got the 8 oz. Grass Fed Ribeye, and while good, he was clearly jealous (and he's not even a fan of salmon)!

I'D SKIP
The crispy Mediterranean octopus -- it was just okay, but the texture and flavor weren't nearly on par with the other items on the menu.

Salmon skin tacos (a close runner-up) -- It's an interesting concept, so it's something I'd order at least once just for the novelty of it. 

OVERALL
Black Sheep is one of my new favorite date night spots. Dimmed lighting sets the mood, the staff is friendly and helpful, and the food was both delicious and exciting.",ZIqkcApOQh8QfiydYSiLaQ,7,6,5,Y4yAB-k9q-YjqF37_7pNag

We were greeted before even entering the restaurant. The gentleman was hospitable and quick to get us a table. 

Upon entering. Perfect ambience, very classy sophisticated. Our drinks were served first, excellent customer service and delicious food was all highlighted and presented here, but these aren't all what made this place distinctive for me. 

Opposed to other restaurants, it's the Chefs, I  personally never had a Chef introduce themselves to me/our table. She even brought out our plate to and explained to us in details what it was and how it was made. I really like that, it shows me that they care about who they are serving their food to and by them doing so, is astonishing and appreciated. They earned my respect. 

With every plate they served us, they are very precise and strong on detail. Art is robustly presented in their food and is tangible here at The Black Sheep.

Then a beet salad to share for a starter. Crazy good. 

I had the flank steak steak and it was absolutely great. 

My wife got the Rib-eye.....hands down it made my flank steak taste like a new cook had made it. The waiter (Shepherd....no joke.....that's his name) told us the rib-eye was better, but I wanted for us not to try more than one thing. 

Now the last name of the Chef is Tran....so we were educated enough to think their may well be some Asian flair with our food. We were not disappointed!!!!

As I said. Flank steak is great. The Rib-eye is stunning. One of the best Rib-eyes I have ever had. The meat was perfectly cooked.....the sauce and sides to this....sun-choke.... yum.....slayed me. Shepherd says that the pork belly beats the Rib-eye......next time. 

We had an extra glass each of the Malbec with dessert. Fantastic finish. 

Please go if you're hungry and in the area. This place is fantastic and I'm a little ticked cause we used to live round the corner.
