I came here late at night and the cookies still tasted pretty fresh. I got one turtle cookie (I love turtles!), and the staff gave me three mini chocolate chip cookies for free. I'm not sure if free cookies come with every purchase, but that was a major highlight! They offer so many mouth watering options. Choosing just one cookie was nearly impossible, but I did it and now I regret not trying more. I highly recommend coming here for fresh cookies!",nJVS18mJIB1hCHq1YsFbUQ,1,1,5,4Az3u2xnj1tq4lF9Mh9J_Q

When we were ordering our cookies she just stood there with a blank stare and would say ""anyyhing else"" like we were bothering her. Once we paid she COULDN'T EVEN HAND US OUR COOKIES FEOM THE COUNTER!!!!! She immediately started fumbling around with something on her counter and I had to reach over to grab my order! I mentioned it to my husband if it was just me and he said no I noticed it too! So he told her ""you can at least hsnd them their cookies"" shebagain gave a blank stare and no reply.

The Mrs. Field's out here are bogus, they have a limited selection, which excludes all my favs. Anyway, the Nestlé is reasonably priced considering its goodness and location.

I had just enough time before the Jacksons' show to have an ice cream sandwich.  When I asked the young thing behind the counter what flavors they had, she explained you pick any two cookies you want and any of their ice creams.

I chose a Snickerdoodle and a s'mores cookie and the ice cream I chose was cookie dough.  That's one from each of my 3 food groups.  She placed one cookie on a wooden thing, put a large scoop of ice cream on the cookie, pushed it down to even out the filling, and then she placed the other cookie on top.

She placed the ice cream sandwich in a cardboard ice cream cup and placed a spoon in the cup with the cookies and ice cream.

The dessert is a bit pricey and sitting on a cushioned bench in the Miracle Mile Shops is not a classy eating experience.  I knew that in advance so that's OK.  The ice cream and the cookies were good .",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,10,6,3,mNRXxJZv--jlR1A5UZeVew

We went over and decided to share a cookie, better than eating the whole one by myself! 
we split the chocolate chip and walnut. so flipping good! WORTH EA. AND EVERY CALORIE! AND would have been even better if it was warmer.

I blacked out my diet conscience and ate about half a dozen right then and there. Boy were they good! I would definitely recommend coming here! The staff was very friendly and helpful.
