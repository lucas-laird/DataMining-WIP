We got tired of driving that far on week nights so we thought we'd grab some tacos at Roberto's (in spite of the fact that they changed their name). I have eaten at Roberto's before and it was good but this wasn't so nice. They wanted $5 each taco and their rolled taco dinner was my only reasonable option so I got it and a couple tacos. Yuck! Brand and over priced for takeout Mexican food. Will make tacos at home next Tuesday.",hSX7pEEiyVzVPEzZt_1Pdw,0,0,2,jUwTYxhnJYKTGoNEyQEOXQ

Maybe days old food their serving. I don't know about anyone else but I would rather wait 10 minutes for three tacos if that meant great savory and fresh cooked meat. My boyfriend had a California Burrito and he literally threw up. Yup we don't have the stomach for this kind of food. I live Mexican, hey Im Mexican but this food is a no go.",dDPPXBv2o8dWeRwzJeemVA,1,0,1,_ZgHkaPfMX7iji03W9hFyg

Roberto's are a well know sight in Las Vegas. This location is fairly new and is usually clean. The staff are friendly, the food is good, and the prices are affordable.

I'm not sure what happened, but the name at this location is now Laurita's Taco Shop, but everything else is still the same.",Si3aMsOVGSVlsc54iuiPwA,0,0,4,phDVhqiZ1FjL22xRqZCzcg
