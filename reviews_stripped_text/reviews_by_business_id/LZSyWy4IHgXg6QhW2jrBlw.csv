However, after I finished meal I found myself wanting to leave. I ordered a Grilled Salmon. My first impression of when I first received it was that it visually looked very good. After I stuck my fork in for the first bite I was a bit disappointed. I struggled to stab my salmon and my meal completely fell apart on me. The interior of my salmon was undercooked while the exterior was overcooked. As for the taste, it was decent. Nothing special but it wasn't terrible as it sounds. Wouldn't order it again if I came back a second time.

Since it's my birthday, I was given a small birthday cake with a candle. Another worker had accompanied our server and sang Happy Birthday to me in Italian! I was quite pleased with this. His voice was great! 

As for the birthday dish itself, I was excited to dig into it. I took the candle out and began eating. Unfortunately, the dish was rock solid. Being optimistic I thought it would just be hard on the outside and soft on the onside. I was wrong. It was very hard and dry all the way to the bottom. 

All in all, it was a generally decent atmosphere and environment but I do not think I would come here again if I had a choice.",e-ivuE87F0pD4Vnvh1hRGw,1,0,2,7vGhYqwSE0LUPF7BkmV1LA

The night my husband was leaving for a long tour, he decided he wanted to go to olive garden for his last meal since its his favorite place to eat. well I called and the lady said we didnt need a reservation. well when we arrived lets just say that they had a wait time of 45 minutes I was so pissed off, and i explained our situation that hubby was leaving for a military tour and he was about to leave in 3 hours is there anything she could do for us since someone gave us wrong information and since he leaving for a long tour. she said no but you can sit at the bar, well the bar was packed too. so after walking out in tears because I was emotional wreck with hubby leaving and wanting to give him a nice dinner before he leaves. we almost just decided to give up and just go to airport but then i mentioned about a pasta place down the road, we decided to just try it. the Macaroni grill was on the 95/rainbow, lake mead location

I was shocked that this place had freaking AWESOME SERVICE!!!!! I told the waitress that we had little time and that once the food came out just to bring check and not only did we have food in less than 20 minutes but the food was amazing. I had the salmon dish and hubby had some pasta meal. we also the waitress sing opera music to us and suprisingly she was good. we also had free dessert on us for being military. I loved the food, the table you could draw on, service and the cost. I would highly recommend this place to anyone. This place def. knows how to treat their customers. we were in and out in less than 40 minutes. I was just amazed that someone listened to me and actually took the time to please the customer.

392652,2014-12-23,1,LZSyWy4IHgXg6QhW2jrBlw,"Need to start off with a quick, all encompassing comment to sum up this dump, BOOOOOOO! 

It took literally ten minutes for a waiter to meander his way to our table ofter being seated, and the restaurant was only about half full at lunch time. And this is the reasoning for the BOOOOOO! assessment...

Service? I was there with my wife and son, but there were only two place settings on the table. I asked for an additional place setting prior to ordering our meals, and when did they bring it? Not two minutes later, not five minutes later, not ten minutes later. It was around five minutes AFTER our meals had arrived that I finally got up and took a place setting from the table next to us, on my own accord! And our waiter walked past the station with the place settings AT LEAST eight times during this period. My F-in pasta was cold by then! In addition, we had to ask for water literally three times before we got it, and again, this was over a ten minute period! Our son's lemonade required equal prodding and requests, we asked at least three times over a ten minute period. Management needs to seriously re-think training, or just cut their loses, and rehire fresh help that knows what they're doing. 

Food? my spaghetti was mediocre, I've made better at home. Wife's pasta, chicken with cream sauce was very, very dry, as was the chicken. same problem with our son's butter noodles, way too dry, butter almost non-existent. I understand that the sauce is the most expensive component in a pasta dish (pasta itself is dirt cheap, especially in the volume that restaurants purchase), but you can find more effective cost cutting measures than skimping on the sauce. 

I hate to say it, but overall, all of the Macaroni Grill trips we've made of late seem to be on par with our experience here. We're from California and the trend of bad service and management seems the norm now. This sucks because we get Brinkers gift cards all the time. Between these jokers and the other Brinker options, Chilis, Maggianos, and On the Border, the one stand out is Maggianos. Their food and service is always top notch. We're sticking with Maggianos from here on out. With the classic pasta dishes there, you get one meal there, and one to take home free. You can't beat that with a stick. 

And the really bad part? You'll never see ANY Macaroni Grill manager ever respond to ANY YELP feedback at ANY location. When I chase my son around to tickle him and I finally get him cornered, he'll turn around and put his hands over his eyes, a child's thought being, ""if I can't see him, he's not there"". Same modus operandi with Macaroni Grill management, it seems.

BOOOOOOOOO!

Cheers.",6WRhaGqJ2dpNVDPpVEc4Vg,2,0,1,kKAHjKNB07fZpE3OUS3euQ
463319,2012-07-03,0,LZSyWy4IHgXg6QhW2jrBlw,"My Daughter had her wedding reception here, just this past weekend. 
The staff answered all her questions and took care of everything we needed and helped her plan the reception. 
 The food was top notch, the service was the best I have ever had anywhere and the staff were both helpful and kind.  The prices were very reasonable and they even allowed us to bring in and store beforehand a cake for the reception. They did not charge us extra to serve the cake to the guests after the initial cut by the Bride and Groom.  
The staff put up the decorations that I had left with them for the occasion and even set up a couple of side tables for gifts. Even tho we were a bit late getting there, everything was served smoothly and every part of the dinner from the appetizers, to the salads to the Main courses and the drinks was delicious and all the guests were satisfied.
 We had vegetarian options for those in the party that wanted them. And the servers were kind enough to take direction to not serve those who did not drink alcohol sprite instead of Champagne for the toast.  It was a stress free reception and I could not thank them enough.  So, if you are looking for a place to hold a small reception of 50 or less people,Romano's is an excellent choice.",RS8PS1MWM_ZxGhS4tFrErA,0,0,5,8aNylZOsLkojHPI4e-z0UQ

I love Italian, but when you have a spaghetti and meatball dish and they run out of meatballs that's just a little sad! Then when you substitute with italian sausages and they are over cooked.. You know something is not right! Oh, but wait, there's more!!! The shrimp was over cooked and the sea bass I had was really over cooked and lacked flavor! What makes this bad, IT WAS ONLY LUNCH!!! Don't get it twisted, it was no late lunch, it was a 12:00pm, I would consider, early lunch! Geez!!! So, we took a chance and had desert, Cheesecake, well that too was disappointing! The strawberry goo looked every bit the part! The only way we knew it was strawberry was the pieces that weren't quite obliterated! Sad sad sad! Okay, that was the negative part... As for the good parts. The crayons for drawing kept us happy until the food showed up. The wine was quite tasty and the water was equally good!!! Oh, our server was cool too!

We went to Macaroni Grill for dinner because we had a BOGO coupon. The food is usually pretty good, but that night it was lacking. Mine turned out fine, but my boyfriend's was totally wrong! He asked for ""sun dried tomatoes"" and got just regular chopped up tomatoes, he also asked for fresh garlic and got none! 
The waiter was very anxious! He barely stopped to listen to what I was trying t ask for and before I was even finished with my statement he was off doing something else. It took him at least 20 minutes between coming back over to our table and doing other stuff. But when he finally did come back, he NEVER offered to refill my drink. I had to ask another waiter to get it for me. Even then, I never got it until much later!! By then, I was almost finished with my meal anyway. 
Then, when he brought us our check, he had the nerve to say ""now that I've helped you, can you please help the kids?"" I thought he was kidding at first, but he wasn't! He then went on to explain that they had some sort of contest going on to see who can get the most donations. We obviously declined.

We got there early, just after 5 pm, and were seated promptly. We ordered the ""two for $9"" appetizer and they were brought just minutes apart. After finishing the appetizers but before the main course came I noticed something out of the corner of my left eye. I turned to see what it was and was astonished to see a cockroach crawling along the back of my booth seat! I grabbed my napkin and squished the roach. We called over the waiter who at first seemed to be apologizing for the slowness of the main course. I didn't want to raise my voice but he just wouldn't listen to me so I handed him the napkin and said, ""There's a cockroach I just killed in here. I need a new napkin."" He took it away and a couple of minutes later the manager came over and apologized profusely, which would have been great except he said they had just sprayed ""last night"" to get rid of roaches. So not only was a roach crawling around our table but there was bug spray all over? 

Even though the restaurant wasn't that busy our waiter seemed to be. He complained to us that he had ""3 or 4"" large parties (I didn't see any table with more than 6 people). They were one cook short in the kitchen (overheard a waitress telling the table next to us). What should have been an hour meal took almost two hours.

We ordered two of their skillet specials from brunch menu, one egg and bacon breakfast, one Caesar Salad with chicken.  After an hour of waiting we asked what the hold up was, we were told our food would be our soon.  Finally it arrives.  One breakfast had a piece of toast completely black on one half this was served bottom size down so it did not show on the plate. The eggs in the skillet were are the sunny side up and were underdone.  The manager stopped by and asked how breakfast us, I told him about the long wait and his response was the menu is new to the kitchen (3 weeks old) and they did not know how to prepare the food.  I called him on it and said it was a few eggs potatoes and meat. Pretty basic. To encourage us to return he offered to give us some thing.

They've changed the menu and added calorie counts.  Ordinarily, I get Shrimp Portofino, but upon noticing that it had a higher calorie count than Lamb, I opted for the Lamb.  I didn't mind paying a little more ($16.99 vs $12.99) for something I enjoyed especially if it was better for me, if only slightly.  

Anyway, the portion of lamb they brought out was 4 small pieces of meat on 2 skewers.  It wasn't much bigger than an appetizer portion.  In fact, if the vegetables were smaller, I would say it was an appetizer.  I realized the smaller calorie count was due to the significantly smaller portion.  For $16.99, it felt like a rip off.  For that amount of money, I would expect a dinner size portion, not a glorified appetizer.

I used to love the Macaroni Grill in California (Westlake Village) and was expecting this one to be on par.  It was not.  

It took OVER 35 minutes for our food to arrive, and when it did, it was not good.  How freeking hard is it to cook pasta?!  Not very.  The restaurant was not particularly crowded but it seemed like we were waiting forever!  As I eagerly dug in to my pasta, I was immediately underwhelmed.  I guess the pasta iteself was okay, but the toppings and chicken were really not good.

For starters, I always need some of their Brick Oven Formaggio.  Melted, bubbly mozzerella and parmesan bread crisps with either chicken or sausage and pepperoni - this stuff is awesome.  Since it's, you know, cheese and meat it's pretty heavy so it's great for sharing.  Also, I usually can't help but sample some of the rosemary bread dredged in the cheese as well.

For my entree, I always always always get the shrimp portofino.  If you're a shrimp lover like I am, especially if you like scampis, this is a delightful dish.  Shrimp sauteed in a light lemon butter sauce and served with linguine, pine nuts, mushrooms and spinach - it really is just a great, simple dish.",VeYSD3Xgxd-R4yowet51tA,0,0,4,9wqplRYkKYfqmg05Y3U4wg

Pros:
*  Calamari (I think I can speak for my gf & say that Romano's Calamari is bomb)!
*  Bread (gotta get that bread and don't forget the oil with fresh ground pepper..yum)!
*  good service
*  the ambiance feels upscale (the butcher paper on your table will take you back to reality though). 

Cons:
*  Its seems that the portions have gotten smaller (presentation has changed too).
*  It took a little longer than normal to get our bill.

Overall:  
This is some good food and decently priced too.  I can't come to this place without ordering Calamari and filling up on some of that bread!  Romano's never disappoints.  The one thing that I noticed has changed though is that the server does not write his name on the butcher paper like they used to (they used to introduce themselves and write their name upside (to face the guests) with a crayon).  They also do not bring a bottle of house wine upon arriving to your table with fresh bread like they used to.

Tips:
*  Like them on Facebook & get $5.00 off an entree.  You do not need to print it, just show them on your phone and make sure to give them the coupon code #.
*   As if I haven't hyped it up enough.. Try the Calamari!
*  I didn't order it this time, but the Bellini here is good too!
*  Romano's encourages drawing on the butcher paper so if you want to have a nice dinner with the family and you have kids that have a short attention span, this place can deliver.",G1O-KAFicH00OW14aPfw3g,2,1,4,nsTp_tVvVZGP6HYBkx-mQg

I've only eaten at one other Mac Grill, and that was back on the east coast.  The one in Harrisburg, PA (new location) rocks with outstanding service, fresh foods, and a clean/inviting atmosphere.

The location on Sahara in Vegas, has much to live up to!  Our server was a little on the untactful side.  He offered NO spices/herbs for the olive oil for our bread.  Those spices/herbs make a BIG difference!

I ordered a side salad before my meal.  The lettuce was old and wilted.  Our server did NOT offer any fresh grated pepper or cheese.

I ordered the Chicken Marsala and was now offered fresh grated cheese but no pepper.  My meal was good but maybe a little overdone.

My boyfriend ordered the Mama's Trio.  His lasagna was clearly burnt and DRY!!!!  It looked like lasagna you get from a buffet.  I can't remember how the other two parts of his meal were but, clearly remember the less than desirable lasagna.

Overall, the service (at this location) was adequate but not great to any extreme.  The employees all seemed to be either grouchy or in their own worlds.

We ordered calamari for our appetizer. I love it so much! Perfectly breaded, not too salty, and the marinara was amazing!

We decided to share a plate of pasta since we usually never finish our food if we get our own plates at an Italian restaurant. We did the ""create your own pasta."" Spaghetti noodles, marinara sauce mixed with alfredo sauce, chicken, mushrooms, spinach, and broccoli. Hella good! I kinda wish I had leftovers now...

We didn't mind the lack of a wait and were greeted and seated immediately.  Our server was pleasant and attentive and gave us ample time to look over the menu.  
We opted for the lunch special cause really, you can't beat a $9.99 lunch at a sit down restaurant.  It starts with a caesar salad that was a bit lackluster but the flavor was decent - so far, so ok.  They also give you a breaded mozarella triangle that was the highlight of the meal.  It's about a credit card sized piece of scrumptuous mozarella lightly breaded, fried and then served on a plate of delicious marinara sauce.  I wish I had ordered 2 more of those and then called it a lunch.  But alas, my entree arrived.  I went with the gorgonzola alfredo and it was just...um, ok.  The pasta was cooked al dente but the sauce wasn't what I was hoping for.  It was topped with approximately 3 extremely small pieces of pancetta that I almost needed a magnifying glass to find.  My husband did the same lunch special but went with the marinara penne with italian sausage.  His pasta was undercooked - not just al dente - like it had an obvious bite to it and should have stayed in the water for a few more minutes.  He was as underwhelmed as I was.  
I guess I shouldn't complain for $20.  I mean - the rosemary bread and fried mozarella were worth that alone.  I guess next time I'll stick to something more tried and true.  Penne rustica, anyone?  Mmmmmmmm...",vpvW58vXP9xuOsWg-OCFxg,0,0,3,ucudlHOTgfXLRl_53Jjd0A

So going out to eat at a restaurant encompasses two major components: service and food.  Sometimes one can outweigh the other and save the outing.  Not here though.

Today's lunch was a birthday lunch for some friends from the office.  We call ahead and place the order so we can accommodate the hour lunch, which kudos to this place, they took the order ahead of time.  That is the only good thing I can say.

So a few of us arrive and we're gestured to our table. Not led, not even directed, just gestured in the general direction.  Uhm ok. 

We find the table by counting the seats at the table, we sit, and we're waiting for the rest of our party.  I'm thinking they're going to take the drink order, but no, the server says our food will be right out.  The entire party isn't even at the table yet.  What about the drink order, what about the bread, what about a greeting?

I go to the restroom, and I'll say they have clean and well-stocked restrooms.  Good job. 

I return to the table and our meals are set around the table.  People are still missing from the table, there's no bread, and the server hasn't even asked about drinks.  Uhm ok.

So since the food is getting cold I try it.  It's bland, flavorless, and the pasta is undercooked.  Really?

The rest of the party arrives.  Everyone has furrowed brows in confusion.  The server reappears and then asks for the drink order.  Still no bread.  

A friend's eggplant parmigiana was burned.  The replacement that came a while later was just as bland and flavorless as my pasta dish.

After a few requests, there's finally bread on the table.  Which would be exciting if it weren't stale.  

Past halfway through our meals, the server offers up fresh-ground parmesan.  Thanks, that would have been great at the beginning of the meal!

So the meal ends.  I am doodling on the table (they do provide crayons and the table cloth is white butcher paper, so that's cool).  The check is paid.  We leave.

Sadly, this is not the only bad experience here.  I've had visits where orders have been completely wrong and replacement meals have come after everyone else is done with their food, where I've been made very uncomfortable by the way-too-handsy server who creeped me out and I had to clearly indicate to not touch me again, and where I've had to flag down a random busser just to get some water.

If it weren't for the fact that they take orders in advance, the clean bathrooms, and the fact that I can doodle on the tablecloth, I would only give this place one star.",x2KHPyEmsg0VL3B40-xfDQ,1,0,2,labHbEFVHI4f6r7LSdZ3GQ

4014466,2012-02-16,0,LZSyWy4IHgXg6QhW2jrBlw,"This is a big chain restaurant so the review here will be pretty short.

Not a bad place to spend dinner with the family.  Food in my opinion is around the same caliber as that Olive Garden place.  I don't mind it, but it doesn't entirely ring true Italian down home food in my mind.  Romano's is fast, efficient, and consistent like most chain restaurants are.

I'm on the cheap cheap, so I kinda don't like the prices here!  Seems a bit overpriced to me for pasta and bread.  Does anyone realize that you can easily make fresh pasta and sauce at home with some basic ingredients for a fraction of the cost??  Takes some elbow work but the results can be astounding.  Plus, guys...you can impress the girls (or guys if that's your sort of thing)!  Nothing gets the wheel turning more than cooking a meal.  Try it!  Have you ever seen Nigella Lawson on tv cooking?  She oozes pure sensuality!  Ooh la la!  She's sexy and she knows it!

Back to the restaurant.  The loaves of bread are good if they come out oven warm and fresh, if you get a cold one send it back!  It can get hard as a rock.  Nothing in particular raised my eyebrows on the menu so I settled for the make your own pasta deal.  It was reasonably priced too at about $12.  You get to choose your type of pasta, sauce, and toppings.  I went with the rigatoni with meat sauce, topped with mushrooms, roasted tomatoes, and asparagus.  It was ok, but nothing to get worked up about.  Pasta was cooked al dente, but really it's just not the same as fresh made pasta.  Romano's uses pasta from a box (I think it's Barilla) but at least the quality was on the higher end.  Sauce was good to sop up with the bread.  I wish though that the dish was a larger portion, and had more of the toppings I chose because they were a bit on the stingy side.

Service was with a smile, excellent dude with a good attitude and kept our drinks filled and our table clean.    

The menu was fairly varied, with lots of choice between antipasti, salads, pizzas, pastas, and entrees.  I don't mind coming again every once in a while for a dining visit but it's not something I would plan out.  Typical chain.  Too many taste buds and too little time to not dine somewhere more exciting!",QCtHk02W_Asu2LFfdmGQDA,0,0,3,OOgYAl3jhwubIm-9XqiZdw

And the paper table cloth to draw on, childish but still fun.  Also great for passing the time between your servers visits and when the food comes out.  Speaking of the food, I was less than impressed.  My table consisting of myself and three co-workers started our lunch with two appetizers.  We tried the goat cheesed stuffed peppers which were probably the best part of the meal.  They were sweet and creamy and topped with a drizzle of thick balsamic.  They came out a lot smaller than I had expected.  Still good though.  We also tried the spicy sausage and peppers.  This dish was okay but not wonderful.  The peppers had a spicy and slightly smokey flavor.  The sausage was crispy.  Almost too much so for me.  For my lunch I ordered the chicken and mushroom canelloni.  It looked great but was lacking a very important feature.  Mushrooms.  I think I found one piece of what looked like canned mushrooms.  That was a disappointment.  And the chicken was not like what I expected.  It was small chunks of chicken that seemed previously prepared and arrived in bulk.  The pasta itself was dry as if the dish was put under a heat lamp or into an oven before the sauce was added.  The quality and freshness of food here was just lacking from my perspective.  as for the service, not bad but not outstanding either.  Our server, Chris, was new and claimed to be fresh out of training.  He was noticeably nervous. He did get all the orders correct and I give him credit for that.  I have to knock a few points off overall service though for seating four people at a table with clearly two settings and wating until we asked for more before bringing more.  We told the host/hostess that we were a group of four and waited 10 minutes for a table to be ""prepared.""  I would think with the time that passed they could have managed to put to extra settings on the table.  I think from now on I will stick with Olvie Garden.",eOIMO2wT_WbNqmavhnCRxw,3,2,3,BJBQUQzMLhJ9QnJmaB13ag

So I went ahead and ordered their new addition of chicken melanese with roasted potatoes and green salad and I was pleasantly surprised at how amazing it tasted.
The service was good and so was the food and everyone at the table seemed to enjoy their meal. 

On the other hand another downside to this revamped menu is that it was way more expensive than usual and I'm not quiet sure if it was really worth it. Each dish on the menu was about 5 to 8 dollars more and I did not expect that kind of price hike.

I mean that FIG JAM was outstanding!!!

After about 10 minutes the bartender refilled my beer and brought out my Lasagna with extra sauce!! At that moment it hit me-I said Brushetta he heard Prosciutto?!?! I wasn't gonna be seeing any tomatoes tonight ...

In town for business, my colleagues and I wandered here for food one night after a long day.  We stood at the host stand for so long without being greeted that we genuinely wondered if we were standing in the wrong place.  After flagging someone in an apron down, we were finally seated.

Service was friendly, but slow and, dare I say, bumbling.  Seemed like it took two tries on everything from drinks, to bread, to appetizers to get things right.  The menu was fairly limited, but there was a Make Your Own Pasta option, so two of us went for that.  We both ordered the whole wheat pasta with different sauces and toppings.

Now, whole wheat pasta can be iffy sometimes, but we had faith that a pasta place could get it right.  It was, hands down, no question, the worst pasta either of us had ever had.  Undercooked, stiff, and gross, we both ended up picking around it and eating the toppings.  I couldn't tell you the last time I sent food back, but I would have sent this back if I wasn't super tired and if I thought they had any hope of doing better.

It was different. I like the atmosphere and warmth this place gives, it was very inviting. The vibe was calm and I enjoyed it. At first I thought this place literally grilled macaroni and I had no idea it was based on Italian food.

Service is quick and our waiter was very informative, she told us what the specials were and what kind of foods were good like the calamari. She also informed us about what kind of wine they had.

At first I got water because I didn't really know what kind of drinks were available but later when I felt comfortable enough I went ahead and ordered a Mojito and it was alright, I enjoyed it though. As for my main entree, I ordered the Filet steak with mash potato w/lobster. It was good, the meat had a good sear and was juicy, not too juicy though since I got it medium well done. I loved the mash potatos, I just wish there was a little more lobster, it was something new to me and it was great experiencing it... mash potato's and lobster who'd knew?

This place emphasized extra virgin olive oil almost on everything especially with the bread which left me wondering if they wanted us to hurry up and leave or it was made to make us feel full and satisfied, I assume it's to make us feel full and satisfied and I appreciate the strategy. Over all I enjoyed my experience with Macaroni Grill. I'd like to come back and check out the pasta dishes next time.",kgtBZKbNTQrGMDPog3ASdg,1,0,3,53vtHuL51xpPtMo7yGrhIA

We walked in at about 12:00pm.  The restaurant was about 1/3 full (surprising for lunchtime.)  No host to greet us, and a small wait.  Finally was seated by a waiter.  Was never told about the 7 minute menu or how to order it from the host, therefore, we asked our waitress when she finally arrived (waited about 4-5 minutes.)  I really hate that wait, especially when the restaurant is 2/3 empty.  When asked about the 7 minute lunch, the waitress pointed to the board menu and said that we had to order and pay from there (in other words no table service.)  It would have been very nice if the host mentioned that as now we already wasted 10 minutes of our lunchtime.  We went up to order and there was complete confusion with the staff taking our order.  I agree with some reviews here...TRAIN your staff or hire new staff!  

I had the Pepperoni Calzonetto, friend had Chicken Parm, other friend had Pronto Caesar.  When the cashier asked for drinks, I asked if they had Sweet Tea.  He said yes, and ran down all the flavors of teas.  I again asked for just Sweet Tea.  He then said, ""Sorry we only have what I said.""  Obviously, he did not know what Sweet Tea was - TRAINING folks!

We did sit back down at our table and received our lunch in 7 minutes 40ish seconds.  I thought it out of their guarantee of 7 minutes, but my friends disagreed so we did not say anything.  Well I wish at least I did, because my lunch was horrible.  But I guess, what do you expect for $7 and 7 minutes nowadays?  Well, I was expecting what numerous articles said about their lunch..fast, but no quality lost.  Wrong (at least for mine.)  The cheese in my Calzonetto had gotten hard by the time I finished my first section (they cut it into four pieces.)  The sauce was also very lacking.  Lastly, the flat bread that held all that greatness together was burnt.  When I pointed it out the manager, she said that was how they cook the flat bread.  I wanted to laugh.  I then explained that it made the whole meal taste burnt.  She did offer a replacement, but like I said at the beginning, we had to be in and out.

Both of my friends said that their orders were ok.  Nothing to write home about, but they would return.  As for me, I will not.",0krIXTM-fNED7ozGt11UmQ,1,0,1,Z_G73idk6IASB32zNEjTrw

All Macaroni Grills are pretty much the same. You walk in, the bar is to the left and the kitchen is to the right. You walk down a ramp and the tables are in the middle and back part of the restaurant. There are table tops and booths for you to choose from. On each table, there's butcher paper with crayons to doodle on. The servers come, write their names, serve bread, olive oil and balsamic vinegar. Our server was personable and loved to make small talk.

For dinner, I got the Pasta di Mare for $18. Pasta with scallops, mussels, shrimp, fettuccine, white wine sauce, pomodoro and garlic. I love this dish! Lots of seafood and lots of flavors. This dish is is packed with protein, you feel like you're getting your money's worth. I loved the flavors!

My default spot is Macaroni Grill. Not in the sense of, like, ""Well, guess we should just go where we always go,"" but more like, ""Yes! It's my birthday and I get to go to Macaroni Grill!""

The place is nice looking, with raw stone walls, fancy glass lanterns, a pretty bar, and a kitchen that's open for public viewing. Service is prompt and courteous, and each table is topped with butcher paper, and you get a couple Crayolas to go with it. If there's ever been a wait for my meal, I haven't noticed, since I'm always so busy doodling. 

The house wine's mighty fine. I recommend you try the Past Milano -- bow tie pasta tossed with grilled chicken, sun dried tomatoes, 'shrooms, and fresh basil in an asiago-cream sauce. With the bread they serve (a fresh loaf of rosemary bread, brushed with olive oil and lightly salted), a salad, and the huge portion you receive (I'm not talking Bucca-big, family-sized, but huge for one), there should be plenty of leftovers for a midnight snack.

Oh, and for birthdays, you get a slab of rich, dark, chocolate cake, smothered in a scrumptious chocolate ganache. And they have people who will sing to you with a beautiful operatic voice.

I completely understood. I suppose that many people complain that they don't get their food on time. The guarantee is only applicable if you ordered it at the counter.

I actually opted for the $10 three course lunch special. I would not call it three traditional courses though. The Mozzarella Frita was a bite sized portion of parmesan breaded with mozzarella and arrabbiata sauce. Instead of the caesar salad, I opted for their green salad. It wasn't really that great. You don't get a choice of salad dressing as it is dressed with undesirable vinaigrette sauce. Finally, the Penne Arrabbiata was plain in that all you could taste was the sauce and the pasta.
