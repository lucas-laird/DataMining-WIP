53920,2013-09-29,0,ni4ppUp4oHq-OSSCgUIGiA,"First, read Rod U's review and take his comment about cost to heart.  This is NOT the place to go if you want to get your basic sushi, tempura and teriyaki bento boxes. You can get that for less money elsewhere in Vegas and it'll be pretty good.  barMASA is the place to get out of your comfort zone and try things you haven't tried before, or tried elsewhere and didn't like.  Because if it isn't good at barMASA it probably just isn't for you.

Case in point: uni (sea urchin).  I've tried this at many Japanese restaurants, and universally, it made me gag.  Literally.  That is, until I had the uni at barMASA.  At barMASA the uni is creamy, tasty, and delicious.  My only explanation is because the ingredients are really fresh and well prepared.   A lot of the other items on the menu gave me similar experiences.  ""Toro"" in a lot of restaurants suspiciously tastes just like regular tuna, but here it's rich and delicious.  Octopus is often chewy and kind of tasteless, but here the hibachi octopus is perfectly cooked, tender, and tasty (they put some kind of sauce on it that is really delicious).

We tried a number of other items, and the only one that I wasn't really impressed with was the yellowtail collar.  It was good, but was basically roasted fish.

The service was good, but a bit confusing.  We had three different people come up to us and tell us they would be serving us; we weren't really sure which one was our waiter or whether they all were.  But they took good care of us and gave us very good recommendations on food and sake.  We were having trouble picking a bottle of sake and they poured us a bunch of shots to try several bottles. 

Overall, the food is very good.  But it is very expensive, and if you're coming just for sushi, sashimi, and tempura, you're better off going elsewhere.",uOmGw_dh7nwRI43drtsGWQ,2,1,4,zp3Bz38SX_cqP3TfMTd-pg

The quality of fish here was good. I enjoyed their toro tartar caviar dish. They actually loaded it up with more caviar than toro. The grilled mushrooms with white truffle was good, although I would have preferred more truffle (it still was a good amount). I had a yuzu sorbet for dessert (tastes like a sweet lemon, kind of like frozen lemonade). I've been here before to their more private shabu shabu section. Where they serve a very expensive omakase. It was a great experience, but one of those things you try only once.",aN5q5_vC8TiFc5wKngmTaw,1,0,3,LH14C3YpP7j0AXQ431yC8g

Proper service requires the proper etiquette. The Sommelier TJ is a fine addition and helped me pick  a fine choice for a novice drinker. The tasting menu was well done as an introduction to understanding truly quality fish. It was simple and clean allowing one to understand the different flavors and textures involved. The udon was obviously hand made in the traditional fashion. I have eaten sushi from the finest chefs near world wide and still love this place when I am in Vegas.

My boyfriend and I went there on dec 20th. The decor is so so n there is no theme. Our waiter is not knowledgable at all!!! When we asked for recommendations, he told us ""fried chicken n popcorn shrimp""?!?!? What? Are we in Popeyes?? We ordered the beef sukiyaki, it's pretty good but small. N it was probably the best dish for the night.

Man, don't get us start on the sushi... For $15 a piece of a tiger prawn sushi, u expected it to be pretty darn good right? But nope.. It tasted like rubber w a slighest hint of freshness. They said the fish are from japan, and I really doubt that. They may hav been from Japan, but had been there for a long time and the freshness is all gone. O, and a toro roll cost $68!! For  4 pieces!!! We had better from any Japanese supermarket.

We will never go there again, it is a rip off. It costed us $380 for 2 dishes and 10 pieces of sushi, it's totally not worth it!!!!",3nmO2KHy1EOyVeno0I2l-w,1,0,1,TVgih1LJiKEiafcz7c2NcQ

If you are looking for decor? Nope.. Think of a warehouse with high ceilings and them drop lights. tables, linens, chairs ordinary... 

Looking for good food? Expect to pay the price! You get one. yes, literally one! piece of sushi for at least $8 a piece... believe me.. i thought it was a joke.. the piece came out the size of a half dollar. Take a half dollar and put it up to the screen and you will see what a freaking California roll will cost you... remember, one, uno, 1 piece!!! $ 8 dollars! That's more than some people make in an hour... all for you to devour and still think you still have some more coming. yeah right! keep dreaming. 

OK.. now lets go on to service.. You go there, and hostess, very nice..but boy do they train their servers well.. you don't know what to what to eat cause the place is new.. so what do you do? of course, ask the server?!?.. and what do they suggest? they most freaking expensive thing on the menu. yes..the caviar thing.. price?? $240 EACH! Damn! I would love for them to work for me if I had a restaurant.. And of course I did not get it, but my neighbors did.. and guess what happened? It got returned after the first bite... so $240 per person well spent? I'll let you answer that one. 

So, overall, if I were planning to go try this place...PLEASE DON'T!! IT SUCKS!!!! Such a waste of money!! If you want good Japanese in Vegas.. go to Yellowtail in the Bellagio. You get more food, better price, cute servers, nice view, and a better selection on Sake... So, I will end my story here. 

I love to try new places, but this is the first time I EVER had to Yelp a place.. Save your money and try something else. I am pretty sure  95% of you will get come out of here unhappy and  willhave to fnd somewhere else to eat to make up for the portion you did not get.... 

TRUST ME!!!  i so wish Yelp had a ""0"" rating!!!!!!!!!!!",S-z6ldrR2vy71-pfIRXZNg,0,0,1,2elQ3BY8lYPa2lNzywdLOg
146231,2015-09-07,0,ni4ppUp4oHq-OSSCgUIGiA,"Enjoyed an exceptional dinner here. We had a concert later in the evening so we were dining pretty early on a Saturday night. We sat at the bar for a pre-dinner cocktail and enjoyed our service there so much we decided to just stay there instead of being seated at a table. The bartender Tommy was gracious and gave us excellent recommendations. I cannot recall the name of my cocktail but it was rum and yuzu with something spicy on top - it was probably the best cocktail I have ever had. We tried a variety of dishes based on the recommendations from the bartender and they were exceptional. The standouts were the octopus and jalapeño sizzling plate, the toro handrolls, and the tai truffle. The beef udon noodles were also really satisfying. I would say it is pretty typical upscale Vegas pricing, which is high. But when you have excellent food and service you just don't mind. The fish was so fresh tasting and truly was the star of the raw dishes. There was great thought to texture and flavors that didn't distract from the fish and only enhanced each bite.

179634,2010-04-21,2,ni4ppUp4oHq-OSSCgUIGiA,"Eek! doesn't quite put the enough emphasis on just how bad this place really is. I am also quite shocked to see how my fellow yelpers could rate this place with any more than 2 stars. 

The boyfriend and I along with the buds came here to eat after not being able to decide on a place and we were running out time since there was soo much do in while in Vegas. I was connected to the restaurant from room service since we were staying in Aria. I wanted to see if I can get us a table for that evening since the gang was planning on eating within the hour. I should've known when the hostess told me that a reservation as last minute as ours was not needed and we can just walk in whenever that this was a bad idea. So after getting ready, we strolled downstairs and was promptly greeting and seated probably only because the hostess were bored our of their minds. 

I was not visually wowed by this place at all. For being a restaurant inside Aria, I had higher expectations for the atmosphere and interior design for Bar Masa, have you seen Aria-nothing like it! It looked like a airport cafeteria. It had such a big and open space but the colors and furnitures were soo bland and boring. They used a lot of different shades of whites/off whites, brown, and dark gray. 

We looked at the menu, yes some of the items listed were a bit pricier but we thought since it's Vegas, it might be the norm as well as being chef Masa. Oh how naive I was. The food was terrible. We ordered a spicy tuna roll, a yellow-tail roll, Kobe beef fried rice, and a mushroom udon soup. Not only was the food we order expensive, the portions tiny, and it made us very sick. 

The rolls were decent but way over-priced for 5 pieces each roll. The Kobe beef fried rice was like an average bowl of fried rice. We couldn't tell if it was just regular beef or actual Kobe since it was ground up and very little of it. It was more like fried rice with onions and rice that tasted like butter and soy sauce. The udon was horrible. The broth they used was bland and was just disgusting. I couldn't believe this was the food being put out by chef Masa. It just looked plain. No visual presentation either. The atmosphere and the food is comparable to fast food-Japanese style. 

The waitress however was very friendly. She's from China and chatted us up like immigrating from there and her life now. I think our waitress was the only highlight for our night there.",bJ7BUQoUiC7vgOICe_49-g,3,2,1,7F8GKkLotOqbsYJpHAUE6Q

231906,2009-12-23,1,ni4ppUp4oHq-OSSCgUIGiA,"The food was good and I'd consider most of it slightly better than what I've had in SF and probably on par with sushi in Japan, but it doesn't seem like the cost premium is worth it especially since we're talking about double or more, although flying to the Tsukiji fish market for sushi would cost a lot more. We had a $100 dining credit from the hotel where we stayed which made the cost a little easier to stomach, but it wasn't enough to cover the full cost of the meal for 2 and we wished we used the credit at another restaurant instead; taking the dining credit into account, I would've rated this place 3 stars for just the food.

+ Can taste the fresh ingredients (according to LA Times, the fish is from the famous Tsukiji fish market)
+ Menu highlights geographic origin of food
+ Homemade soy sauce without MSG
+ Warm wet hand towels brought to the table before dining
+ Accommodating when running late for reservation (had to call MGM's central number and wait for awhile before being connected to them)

- With one piece of sushi for $6+, the nigiri were the smallest I've ever seen vs good sushi places in the SF Bay Area and maybe even Japan, though the waiter did tell us they were served as individual pieces; the sushi rolls are a much better deal, but still expensive
- Decor seems to look modern, but not a fan of the mixed industrial feel of the place and the concrete floor, walls, and bar as it doesn't quite reflect ""fine dining""; if you turned up the lights, you might have felt like you were dining at artsy cafe in the SOMA district in SF
- Bright lights from the kitchen clash with the dimly lit dining area which makes it seem like someone forgot to install double doors to the kitchen
- A wooden open wine? box with ""BM"" scribbled on the side in what seems like permanent marker is used to bring out the food, but looks more like supplies being carried to/from the kitchen rather than a classy touch (not sure if this is supposed to be a rising trend as I saw another fine dining restaurant use a wooden wine box for serving bread).
- Very minor, but our second sushi tray had the sushi roll pieces laid out but not as cleanly as one would expect for ""fine dining"" (or the judges in Chopped on FoodTV)

Dinner Notables:
+ Hamachi Nigiri $7 - buttery and melts in your mouth
- Yarika Nigiri with Salt and Yuzu Zest (Squid) $7 - a bit too slimy for my tastes, but liked the citrus bursts
o Tarabagani Nigiri (Alaskan King Crab) $9 - just ok
o Spicy Tuna with Fresh Green Chili $18 - tuna was on par with budget sushi places in SF

Also, I'm Asian and fine dining Asian cuisine hasn't really made a lot of sense if it's not fusion, but maybe it's because Asian food is just ""food"" to me.",_dqRcJqA2gW3R6Pf5Orexw,4,1,2,o8hYP9s-GfLo9iRJQC1S1A

261604,2011-06-23,0,ni4ppUp4oHq-OSSCgUIGiA,"Went to this beautiful restaurant looking for some delicious sushi at a pricey high end restaurant at one of Vegas' newest hotels.  Wow, what a disappointment.

Michelin star?  Really?  They must not have checked recently.  The wife ordered two sushi rolls for about $25 each (normally price around $5-8 range at other great sushi places.)  The California Roll had a crunchy tendon/shell fragment in it and they replaced it with another.  But, that second roll tasted as though it was rolled in salt and was inedible!!

I (The Mr.) am not a big sushi fan, so ordered their angus rice for $34.. wow, what a surprise when I received 2 cups worth of rice (if that) and small bits of beef to eat and it was mostly soy saucey.

To finally top it off, our drinks ran dry many times before they finally came around to refill.

They did take the bad sushi roll(s) off the bill, but didn't appologize or even say they removed it from our bill when the slapped down the check and walked away.

Stay away...  Far far away.  Now we know why it was mostly empty. This place needs to get some new cooks or management.  Does not reflect well on the MGM brand at all and we're long time MGM customers.",70V5gsV5e1sA9wSxEI14iA,1,0,1,1uv4rnpAeb6I2dO3Y5Gt6Q

332787,2010-06-29,1,ni4ppUp4oHq-OSSCgUIGiA,"Always heard about Masa in NYC and was excited to stay at the Aria and be able to try it closer to home. The reviews have been so high from such a variety of places that it seemed a good choice. We love sushi and have eaten it from NYC (Nobu/Morimoto) to Hong Kong to Los Angeles to Northern California. We are fortunate to live on the West Coast and be able to partake in some very fresh and unusual sushi treats.

Unfortunately, Bar Masa, Las Vegas was a large disappointment. I know the prices are NYC style where things have to be flown in from Tokyo (and probably to Las Vegas as well), but none of the 4 of us felt that we had anything of exceptional value. It was fresh and lovely, but we left starving and had to eat elsewhere to be satisfied. We would have ordered more items, but 1 sushi or sashimi per order is a little silly. The appetizers like the Sizzling Spicy Octopus was so small you couldn't even taste the octopus. It was tender and a nice truffle broth, but really, it was just a tasting, not a serving. The waiter even said the appetizers were served family style. Good luck with that.
 
The portions were the smallest I have seen since the days of Nouvelle Cuisine...even smaller. Ama ebi was like maybe one small sweet shrimp sliced into 3 pieces that were almost paper thin. Nice knife skills, and lovely on the palate, but it was too small to really enjoy even letting it melt on your tongue. The other choices on the sashimi tasting that night were almost all white fish with very little variation in flavors. It was just not a Wow to the taste buds and with 7 varieties portioned into 3 slight pieces each.....not a good experience for $98.

As I said, we have had some wonderful, fresh and exciting sushi (we generally choose sashimi btw). This was not a treat in anyway and to those who say it is, sorry, but you apparently haven't had many exceptional choices of venue in the past.

Long story short, it was way too much to spend on nice, but unexceptional food/service/ambiance. The stark atmosphere and odd service was off-putting as well. One reviewer noted as we did, no interaction with staff in any part of the restaurant other than ""practiced and pre-approved lines"". Maybe if we had gotten a smile out of some of them we would have felt more welcomed and satisfied, but to leave a place hungry after $300, no liquor....not acceptable.",r0zvDDsTMsdWbRYe351vXA,3,1,1,6QJZ94WYgbLik3H5EUmilA

Toro Tartare Caviar-Served with toast points.  A very simple, but elegant dish that is so transparent if the ingredients are not of the freshest quality, it would blare out at you.  Wonderful toro tartare topped with Osetra caviar.  If you need more flavor, soy sauce and wasabi are always available.

Seared Beef Tataki with Summer Truffle-Beef and truffle shaved thin.  The truffle was too subtle for me.  I did not get the earthy, musky? taste I was expecting from the truffle.  I thought the dish would be a lot heartier, but it was very dainty.  Paying extra for the truffle was not worthwhile.

Yellow Tail Collar-Grilled perfection.  Hamachi Kama is one of those foods that you wonder if you ought to pay a premium for.  Granted this was the most expensive I've ever paid, it was also the best one i've ever eaten.

Assorted Sushi-Just the right size.  I don't have a big mouth (contrary to some people's opinions) so the sushi were perfectly sized. If you are unfamiliar with the eating of sushi, they are supposed to be eaten in one mouthful. The rice was cooked perfectly and sushi construction was expertly done.  We had a spicy maguro roll (not very spicy), amaebi, uni, and king crab( for the wife).

Seafood and Vegetable Tempura-Delicate batter, fried to light crispiness.  You only get one of each thing (except you get 2 shrimp) so if you want to share, you better be really intimate with that person.

This is Vegas, baby, so you are going to pay extra.  That means nothing here is worth it, but you gotta eat.  Do you think if we complain enough, Las Vegas Strip restaurants will lower their prices?

The manager recommended a red wine that was too heavy and strong for the delicate taste of raw fish. The service was ""meh"" and the roll that came in the end was mush. The rolls fell apart when we tried to pick it up. Cannot believe I wasted a meal there.

504632,2010-01-07,0,ni4ppUp4oHq-OSSCgUIGiA,"Reading up on all of the glowing reviews for Masa in New York and the fact that the chef/owner got 3 Michelin Stars, expectation was high. LA has great sushi restaurants so couldn't wait to compare the East Coast version. The restaurants have expensive, distinguished ingredients, but the preparations were standard, and the executions were not that great. We ordered either theis specialty items or ones that seemed different than what you see in other sushi restaurants.
Verdict:
1. Chilled hairy crab appetizers with chyrsantemum salad - a bit fishy
2. Sushi Roll:
* Masa toro toro (toro sushi roll) - good, fresh, toro but not special.
*sushi canape - fishy especially the shrimp one.
*Chiba beef sotomaki with black trumpet mushroom - this is different and very good. It is a sushi roll filled with the black mushroom (inside the rice) and topped with grilled beef.
*Lobster tempural roll - good but standard dish u find in many sushi restaurant. I prefer LA Katsuya with the creamy sauce
*Unagi/avocado roll - good
3. Jalapeno yellow tail - dry - Katsuya in LA prepares this so much better for half the price
4. spicy tuna tataki - not seared and the dressing is bland. 
5. kobe beef sukiyaki - tasty kobebeef cut thinly and still a bit rare almost like what you get in Pho. Good but the broth is a bit too sweet.
6. kobe skewers with yuzu spice  - this is is grilled perfectly and the sauce is great. 
7. Uni risotto with white truffle ($78 for small bowl) - lots of uni but a bit too dense/rich for me
8. Winter mushroom yakisoba and winter mushroom fried rice- very tasty and the noodle has great texture.",JbDuV1aoUEfNbdX3_H-OdQ,0,0,3,0Jeu06PFoYNhgewVKRkpZw

There's no doubt that the prices are a little intense, but I found the cuisine to be inventive, super fresh and tasty. I loved my blueberry cocktail and we enjoyed a number of small plate dishes, including the habanero beef tacos. I settled on the spicy chicken udon as an entree, and while I like spicy, it was just a little too. We split the miso creme brûlée; it was delicious. 

If you are mulling this place over, check out the menu first to see if you want to spend that much for relatively small portions. If you're OK with it, I don't think you'll be disappointed by the quality or freshness. I found the service, led by Mayou, to be impeccable.

The negative reviews are mostly around the price/portions, but you're in Las Vegas - everything is expensive there if you're going to eat a nice dinner. If you're not used to that or don't want to spend the money, then don't go to a nice restaurant. BarMASA was fantastic. We went on NYE and they had a limited menu, but it was still pretty large and had a lot of different options. Bonnie was our waitress and she was just so full of positive energy and cheer - she really made our experience wonderful. TJ was our sommelier and he was also great, and knew his wine! He recommended a bottle of something we weren't familiar with, and it was awesome with the food. 

We started with the california rolls, which sound boring, but were not at all. They had fresh lumps of crab meat with no fillers or mayo. We then proceeded to try the tuna tataki, which was so amazing I got a second order for myself. The beef garlic fried rice was also heavenly, and I could've eaten it for days and not minded one bit. My husband tried the unagi roll, which he enjoyed. It was served with the chef's grandmother's homemade sauce -- so you can't go wrong with that! Overall, this was our favorite meal the entire time we were in Vegas. They also have great cocktails!!! Do yourself a favor and check it out.

590702,2009-12-29,0,ni4ppUp4oHq-OSSCgUIGiA,"I recently dined at Bar Masa at the new ARIA Hotel at CityCenter in Las Vegas.  Having heard of Chef Masayoshi Takayama, a holder of 3-Michelin Stars, I was more than excited to dine at his new restaurant.

We ate at the restaurant on 12/20/09, less than a week after ARIA opened.  There were 4 people in my party.

The decor inside was generic at best.  Cold concrete floors and walls throughout gave this restaurant zero personality.  Not that we expected your usual Japanese restaurant decorations: fans, masks, kimonos and tatami mats, but frankly, the restaurant could have been any other restaurant... an Italian restaurant, a steakhouse, even the 24-hour hotel coffee shop, and the decor would be fine.  Like I said, generic at best.

Getting down to the food, we were disappointed by the menu's selection.  The ARIA website did not have a menu online for the restaurant for us to look at ahead of time, but after checking the menu for Bar Masa NYC, we figured the menu would be similar.  We were wrong.  The menu had a good selection of sushi and sashimi, but when it came to hot items, it was lacking.  There were a couple of Yakitori and skewers items, a couple of udon and soba, some fried rice, soups, and other items that were not very inspiring or much different from the usual Japanese fare.  It felt like the menu was watered down to cater towards the general masses who are used to miso soups and california rolls.  Do note that this restaurant serves a la carte style, so there are no entrees.

We ended up ordering the sashimi box and the sushi box.  Unfortunately our waiter was not very familiar with the menu and could not quite confirm what were included in these boxes.  He guessed there were 6 or 7 types of sashimi, and ""maybe 13"" pieces of sushi.  The boxes were $99 each.

Food was brought out in wooden crates with the letters ""B.M."" written on the side which made us all giggle because ""Bar Masa"" was not the first thing we thought of when we think what ""B.M"" stood for for.  I don't understand why they chose to use crates over trays.  It looked like a cheap way to try to be different.  In addition the crates hid the food as the waiters brought them out so you don't really get to see what others  were ordering.

Unfortunately I do not remember the number of pieces of sushi/sashimi were in the boxes either.  What I do remember was they were absolutely delicious.  The sashimi, sadly, was sliced very small and very thin.  However, I was surprised to see 3 pieces of toro in there, even though the 3 pieces equaled to one regular piece of sashimi you normally would get at a regular sushi bar.  The fish were extremely fresh and I had not tasted such fresh sashimi and sushi since dining at Matsuhisa.  Even simple maguro tuna was delicious.  The price for the boxes was very fair for sushi and sashimi of this grade.

In addition to the boxes, we also ordered my favorite, flying fish roe or tobiko.  The waiter somehow ordered ikura instead.  Big oversight in my book.  We ended up getting both, and both were also delicious.

Lastly, we finished off our meal with a Kobe beef and garlic fried rice, and a winter mushroom fried rice.  While I don't generally do not order fried rice at restaurants, it was something that can be shared with everyone at the table.  The fried rice were $28 each.

The fried rice was not the typical egg stir fried style of fried rice that you find in Asian restaurants.  First, they used brown rice, and it almost looks like risotto.  There was no egg used in the rice either so you get to taste more of the flavor of the ingredients.  They were very well done even though the Kobe beef was cut into small cubes, which was unfortunate since you really do not get to taste the beautiful flavor and tenderness that is Kobe beef.  The winter mushroom fried rice was very flavorful and I enjoyed that quite a bit.

We opted to skip dessert and instead went to the incredible Jean Philippe Patisserie inside the ARIA.  Including drinks and several bottles of beer, the bill came out to about $100 per person.  About average for a high-end restaurant.

Even though the food we ate was excellent, the decor, the service, and the uninspiring menu made this dining experience less than memorable.",zpTP5V_53AJyW4ITdi4nBg,1,0,3,BQGVU8QiWtJusv9YdP79Ow

However, for the cost of this place I would definetely go somewhere else.  Based upon a review of a certain white suited self proclaimed food critic in town we went here.  We got the $120 Omakase menu. 

First off, the decor I thought was nice over all but not what I was looing for. The front door was impressive but inside the place was a bit trendy, which I could appreciate but I was really looking for a nice classy dinner out not somewhere they are playing pop music in the background. That alone though I wouldn't knock down a star for. But the service was lacking. We had to ask multiple times for the water glass to be refilled. I had to ask twice for the sake menu and that was after waiting awhile the first time. The busser kept trying to take my plate while there was still food on it and I was still eating. One of the courses he brought out while my husband was still in the bathroom, he mumbles off what it was ... couldn't understand him for the life of me and when I tried to ask what he said he quickly wandered off.  For the life of me I kept thinking he said it was some sort of tongue but then after trying it I figured out it was cod. 

The servers that work here have mastered the art of not making eye contact and thus making poor service even worse. I truly felt like flailing my arms about to try and be noticed for more water. 

Ok on to the food, I will say out of the ten courses a few of them were excellent. They had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and I liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle. However, the presentation was nothing out of the ordinary and neither was the sushi if which I had one piece of red snapper, squid, toro and blue fin tuna.  For having ten crouses and spending close to $150 a person we left hungry and ended up hitting up Roberto's on the way home. 

All in all I was disappointed. Based upon the cost and the experience I would definetely try elsewhere and as for the emphatic recommendation from the white suited self proclaimed food critic from now on his recommendations will only be given the weight it deserves.... after researching yelp!",xECpt0seSDbTmt1mGcfffA,0,0,2,spOn32zQcIf3co7PfQHZCg

Many of these 1 star reviews complain about how small the portions were compared to how expensive it was. But, to be honest, that's just sushi/sashimi for you... and that's to be expected at a high end Japanese restaurant. 

The corn and summer truffles were yummy and refreshing. The wagyu beef fried rice was one of my mom's favorite's.  The dish that had the most amount of food though was the garlic chicken karaage, which was also delicious. Our chilled Akami was perfect. Or to me at least because it had cilantro in it and the Akami was ugh so gooood. 

Their truffle sushi was really unique, it had mushrooms and black truffles in it which had an almost odd taste at first but were matched very well. The seared salmon was surprisingly amazing... usually I never eat salmon but I ate almost a whole roll of this. 

Although the Toro is kind of expensive, it's 100% worth it. I don't even have words to describe just how good it was. The rice, wasabi, and Toro all made to perfection. I liked the Tai much better than the Akamutsu mainly because it was less fishy in taste. The Unagi looked really good and got eaten up really quickly. 

For desert we tried one of everything and my favorite would be the miso creme brulee. It sounds really weird or gross even but it tastes like the best creme brulee you've ever had. It's salty and sweet at the same time and has the perfect custard texture. The yuzu sorbet was fresh and clean tasting but too tangy for me. and the Grapefruit sorbet was not my type of dessert but my mom really liked it.",SRb67qTvNGauDjecDPnx2g,5,1,5,X_0nByRRwE96u8AWKTnTfQ

The menu is pretty extensive. If you asked me before last night I would have told you that ""I don't eat sushi."" We ended up getting the Chef's tasting menu. There wasn't a tasting menu option, but we asked if they had one and the server said they could do one for us, no problem. 

We had close to a dozen different menu items and each one was more delicious than the last. Even food that I would never expect to like (ie Eel sushi or live octopus) was so yummy. We finished off two rounds of sushi and the server asked if we wanted more. The tough thing was that we all wanted to keep trying new things but were so full we had to stop!

A few of my favorite items were the soft shell crab, salmon sushi roll, and these fantastic little beef skewers. 

As a side note, my husbands opinion was that the food was delicious, but he's had equally good sushi that didn't cost quite as much. But for more on that he'll have to write his own review.",ksbW8EM2R_P__2Bjed3deQ,1,1,5,Ne4eGRNknlBqYy7nhPy7rA

We wandered into Bar Masa as we were browsing the various restaurants at Aria and decided that while high, the prices might be feasible for us to do on a whim since it was Valentine's Day.  What the heck - let's go for the best!  

I had very high expectations - after all, would chef Masa really attach his name to something that would deliver bad food?  (I've been dreaming about going to Masa and Urasawa the last 5 years!)  I figured that at worst, I would leave not so full because I ran out of money but I would have enjoyed every bite.  

Sadly, that is not the case.  

Here's what we ate:
1. Grilled Eggplant - awful.  I commented in the moment that the stuffed eggplant at dim sum tastes better.  This cost us $18 and was recommended by the waiter as being a ""must-try.""  It bored me to death with what is essentially eggplant with teriyaki sauce.  

2. Kobe beef skewers - The saving grace of this meal.  The beef is juicy, tender and marbled.  There was some tendons in it but overall this was the best dish of the night.

3. Braised cod with Daikon - The fish was well cooked but too sweet.  The daikon was not tender enough - again, dim sum is better.  I enjoyed it but it wasn't perfect and you expect that when you are paying that kind of money.  

4. Kobe Beef udon - What do you get when you cross kobe beef with a $5 bowl of instant udon?  You get Masa's $28 version that includes some overcooked meat floating in it.  The broth was just so...average.  No one should ever order this.  Ever.  

5. Seasonal tasting of Sushi - Here's where I expected our menu to shine but here is where the biggest letdown is.  Some of the big reviews you read with pictures have gone piece by piece, detailing the flavors, textures, etc.  And apparently the NY Times says the sushi is flown in from Tsukiji?  Well, my guess is that flight must have destroyed all of the sushi that ended up in Bar Masa because it was just average.  There was not a single piece that was impressive.  I doubt that you could tell the difference between what was served at Bar Masa vs. the sushi special at Teriyaki Boy.  I was utterly disappointed and yes, I'm a sushi snob.  

This was definitely one of my worst dining experiences in Vegas - ever.  Average to below-average coupled with very high prices will result in that.  At least with buffets, you always have a choice.  Here, the only choice you have is to empty your wallet and surrender your taste buds.",jljERGzkhzlFT5F6A8q95g,1,0,2,nlckeHyl2LDcDIq_yFcNvw

The service was excellent, the drink selection still one of the best in America, and the food held to the same high standard as seen at Tetsu.  

My wife and I are vegetarian; I switched over a year ago while she has been for several years.  Sushi was the most difficult thing for either of us to give up.  That was...until the tempura asparagus roll.  The asparagus keeps the consistency of a fish and the tempura puts a flavor that just has enough hint at the fish while continuing to let the asparagus be its own food.  Talking with other diners who do eat meat, they have labeled the asparagus roll as their favorite vegetable dish ever.  I cannot disagree.  

A big complaint about this restaurant seems to be the amount of food received for the price.  Part of that problem is the Las Vegas surcharge, and part of it is that you are substituting quantity of food (a la California Wok & Roll Susih) for a quality rare to all but the highest of restaurants.  Fine dining is not taking its nod from a buffet but working to help you enjoy your food and explore your palate.  There's a fine buffet upstairs if you need a massive amount of food; if you want excellence this is your place.",Splhu18GE4FGTwOZWCaAaQ,5,1,5,kiN1eGagmiEzKyxM2bIS2A

I cancelled a reservation at Kabuto to go to Bar Masa just because it was in our hotel.  I felt bad for cancelling on Kabuto and even worse after dinner because didn't listen to Yelp which said Kabuto was #1 for sushi in LV and Bar Masa turned out to be a let down.

It started with getting there 15 minutes early, not being seated immediately even though the restaurant wasn't busy, then being forgotten by the hostess.  Was seated by another hostess who was wondering why we were sitting in the lounge without drinks.  After being seated we were not greeted by the server for another 5+ minutes and then another long wait to order.  We ordered a salad, oysters, a hot cod dish and sushi in the first round.  The salad came first and then the cod.  They didn't change the plates out even though they were covered with salad dressing.  Asked the hostess to call the waitress and was rudely blown off but finally flagged the waitress down for new plates.  Plates for every course were also not cleared until next course was brought far after finishing.  10 minutes after finishing the cod we asked where the oysters were.  The server said they were being shucked.  Did they also need to dig them up?  The ceviche was also blah and the scallops in it were a little fishy.  Definitely not super fresh from Tsukiji.  More like from Safeway.

I have no problem paying $500 for dinner and the food was good but not anything significantly better than I can get at any one of half a dozen sushi bars in Hawaii.  They didn't even have otoro.  

Having been to both Robuchon restaurants, Guy Savoy, etc in LV, I've never been anything but blown away by the level of service provided.  I got better service at the 24 hour restaurant in Aria than we got at Masa.     There were certainly enough employees standing around that I would have expected better service.

1472424,2013-03-09,1,ni4ppUp4oHq-OSSCgUIGiA,"Disappointment is an understatement!! It doesn't even deserve one star.
I am still reeling from last nights mistake decision to dine here. I wish I would have yelped it first (I won't make that mistake again). 
Let me start by saying that they couldn't get us a reservation until 10pm, however the restaurant was over half empty when we got there, although you wouldn't have known by the service (or lack of).
My husband and I are bi-coastal seasoned sushi eaters from New York and LA. We dine out twice a week or more at Japanese and sushi restaurants.
I was absolutely astonished at the cost of food here! Our overly distracted waiter explained that the food was tapas style. Again, I was thrown for a loop based on the cost listed on the menu. My husband did point out that other sushi restaurants like NOBU are similar in price, however, when you dine at those restaurants you get your monies worth in portion AND flavor! 
The ceviche' was about 10 dime sized chunks of sashimi. Enough for each of us to feel like we licked a plate rather that ate something. 
 We asked for naruto rolls (understanding that not every sushi restaurant lists them on the menu- but have always been able to accommodate by omitting the rice) and was informed that they are very strict with their policy on not changing what's on the menu but that he would ask the kitchen. A while later he returned and said they could make the roll for an additional cost! Wow! 
When our food arrived, I was astonished by the ""tapas"" portion. Our rolls circumference were literally the size of two fingers put together.  It was more like they were feeding a tiny bird... ONE tiny bird. 
$250 later, we left feeling starved (I am 5'4 & 112 lbs... not a huge eater) and went to a nearby pub to get food to fill our bellies.
DON'T waste you time and money! If you are going to spend the cash, go to NOBU or SushiSamba and get your monies worth!! 
PS: I think the reason they wait until 10pm to give a reservation is because by the time you figure out how badly you are being ripped off, the other fine dining restaurants are ready to close (typically 11pm) so you either dine at a pub with fried & fatty foods, or are stuck where you are trying to get a non-greasy, somewhat healthy meal.",-GcUypJf_Y9-cSNNvgP9Hw,1,0,1,3JOEIyW5QVr_xeJD_rC89Q

With Chef Takayama's reputation and fine menu in NY, we were expecting a similar culinary experience, well, I'd have to say bluntly, Not Here.  

The space is large with high ceilings reminiscent of an airplane hanger with modern-ish light fixtures.  I could care less what the place looks like as long as the food is good.  

The menu is written such that most plates are almost tapas like (not priced that way though) until you get to the slightly larger plates in the rice and noodle sections.  A few items we had were the Foie Gras/ duck which were like 4 tiny tacos.  Very good but pricey.  We had the Victoria beef which was their Wagyu, which came with a bowl of rice and a soy dipping sauce.  In short, I've had better flat iron.  This cut should almost melt in your mouth and I had to bite hard to split the pieces.  For $68 you get 6 small slices which were approx 1.5 x 1.5 inches.  NOT worth the price even if it was 3/4 the price.  Had the asparagus with morels, basic baby asparagus with mushrooms (which when brought out, were baby oyster and not morels, server said nothing), 

Continued on with sushi, had 2 rolls (spicy tuna with green chili and the king crab) which were both very good, then to the nigiri.  Had the toro, hamachi, uni, mirugai, sake.  They were all decent but very small pieces again, especially for the price.  I'm knocking the rating down from 3 to 2 just because there was absolutely no value here at all.  

In summation, leaving with over a $300 tab, we left hungry and unsatisfied with the experience.  I would not recommend this place especially if you are looking for good Japanese food.",s7lyoCAlevNi5NaslaUwVA,3,0,2,dPaH48HW8Atiq_BlHkgHhQ

Setting: a warehouse? Whatever, it was cool. But it seemed like they got first pick of the real estate and picked the wrong place after all was said and done, ""Ya, the ceilings a bit tall....""

Cast: Friendly service. Knowledgeable front of the house staff. Server forgot our waters and only brought one soy dish for the two of us. That balanced things out on the wrong end for sure. 

Plot: I appreciate the plate presentation and the actual food quality. The ingredients and overall variety on the sushi menu is fabulous but I had to reason with this lasting impression on the bill -----

i was looking forward to a great space to eat in since it was
hyped as being showcased in the new aria hotel, but
the ambiance is ruined because the space is ginormous and cold.
 they left the concrete unfinished and exposed, i believe they
need some warm drapery or wall fixtures to warm up the place.
but what kills it is the height of the ceiling combined with the extreme
openness of the dining room.  there is not an ounce of intimacy to be found in this severe space.  restaurant guy savoy also has high ceilings, but it feels more intimate rather like dining inside a small cathedral. with bar masa,  it's like eating sushi in the middle of a costco warehouse.
not to mention the prices.  everything is extremely overpriced.
i had the sashimi tasting menu, and everything came on one
plate.  it was $95 for one small platter of thinly sliced sashimi.
 they did give 3 pieces each of seven different types of fish,
but the presentation was, shall i say, most underwhelming.
some of the sashimi was fresh and tasted very good, but others were
so-so.  overall, a mixed bag for the sashimi tasting menu.  
in comparison, for a similar price, one can get omakase at nobu, shibuya or sushi roku that will yield plate after plate of delicious, artfully presented dishes that will knock your socks off,
 wow you and keep you yearning for more.
to top it all off, when i bit into the red snapper sashimi, i felt something
very hard and plasticky, and it turned out to be a fish scale.

My wife and I dined at barMASA on New Year's Eve.

We had a wonderful private bubbly and cheese planned for later in our room at Vdara, so we aimed for a light supper.

The ambiance was nice.   Lots of exposed concrete and 60 foot ceilings made it feel industrial and a tad uninviting.  The air temperature was cool making us not want to shed our outer layers.

I had reviewed the vast menu several times and tried to get a table several times and has always been booked.   I equated that to exciting and popular, and so my expectations were 5 out of 5.

We ordered a miso soup to start, the king crab California rolls x2, Sashimi sampler (a $140 item) and a soy based crème brulée.   I would definately say the food was good.  Absolutely the best Miso I have had in years and the brulée was a unique and delightful experience.   I really struggled with a limited menu and ending up with a $300 bill for what didn't amount to a full course meal.  Overall on food I would say a 4 out of 5.

When it comes to the service. ..  I have to comment on three things :  first,  the hostesses. .. the night before I tried to get in by myself...  after seeing the lay of the land on my reserved visit,  I realized that the two empty tables I saw were in fact open tables and not just a waiting area...  possibly had resos but the attitude and way the hostess conveyed the 90 minute wait, left feeling like a dirt bag for even asking.     

Second,  the overall observation was that the majority of the waitstaff wasn't really the right mix of talent for a place trying to be upscale Japanese.  I had 2 questions about ingredients  (ie variety of mushrooms in the miso soup), and both questions resulted with a blank stare and a trip to the kitchen for an answer.  Seemed to lack a finesse you would expect at a place like this.  Felt like the buffet staff were on rotation that night.

Lastly, the assistant servers were über gungho and eager to please.   Worked their tables with hussle and were very passionate about your satisfaction .

Service I would rate a 2 ot of 5.

Overall, for me a 2 out of 5, am very disappointed in my experiences and the low bang for my buck.  I won't be back to barMASA.",QBNu2k6xxXLWJPRemsy5fA,4,1,2,O1JZXbzcvYahMAUWP2CmqA

The portion was very tiny, though not as tiny as the Bluefin Tuna Steak which Jon ordered. When the dish arrived, I truly thought it was the wrong meal.  But, no...it was the correct dish.

Interior was stark, modern and no hint of the cuisine to come, even most of the wait staff were not Japanese.  Our server was stoked I spoke Chinese, um, really unprofessional and it got old after a while.  

Yes, Bar Masa is still super pricey, but our bill after taxes/tip was in the low $400s, expected, actually I thought it would have come out to more.  The Kobe Steak put the bill over the top at $68, very simple, very good, and not too heavily marbled.  The sakes were decently priced, go with the junmai daiginjo by the carafe, less than $30 a pop.  

LOVED:
-Kobe Steak
-Kampachi Jalapeno, excellent quality of fish, great texture & nice heat
-Yakisoba, delicious
-Salmon Avo Tempura Flake roll, melted, the flakes were wonderful.

Not so much:
-Sashimi Tasting $98, price a little high, but if it was good, I would not be baulking.  
-Kobe wraps, tasted like something from a Chinese resto, sauce was thick and not delicate as Japanese cuisine should be.  

If you're walking from the dining room to the restroom, ladies, go to the LEFT of the reception and boys go to the RIGHT.

Portion sizes are just laughably small and hi-friggin-larious when paired with the price tag. How hilarious are we talking about? Steroid shrunken penis on a 400lb all muscle body builder hilariously small.

Food was just ok.... and expensive for what you get.  Here is what the three of us ordered:

Tai Truffle - $38 I can't remember what white fish the truffle was served on, but this was delicious.  The fish and truffle melted in your mouth.  This was, personally, worth the price.

Spicy Chicken Wings - $18  I didn't try these but my friends said they were just ok.  Definitely not worth $18 for 6 small wings.

Shishito Peppers - $12  Grilled with a side of lemon.  They were just shishito peppers.  Not worth the $12.

Beef Sukiyaki Rice with Poached Egg - $28  expensive... but this was delicious and was the table favorite for the other two girls.  I really like it too, I just liked the truffle more :)

Shrimp Tempura Roll- $18  Nothing special here... shrimp tempura in roll with nothing additional like cucumber or avo!  I would've happily paid $6 for this but not $18!

Mushroom Udon - $18  They used really seasonal mushroom and therefore this dish was good.

Service was just ok.  Friendly but not super prompt for how empty the place was.  Good wine choices.  Bottles priced from $48 to make it more affordable.

After a bottle of wine and food plus tip, the three of us spent $280.

Seaweed salad: Disgusting. Tuna tartare for $39 was on par with what I'd expect at a gas station for $4. To boot, served in a glass bowl that was dirty. Miso soup was the worst I've ever had. Crappy seaweed salad, a handful of low grade tuna squares, and a bowl of lousy Miso soup set me back $96. In San Francisco at a third tier Japanese restaurant, I'd pay $14 for this.

The husband and I decided to swing by barMASA for a nice dinner on my birthday last August. I wanted sushi. He wanted sake. And we were staying at Aria. So, go figure! 
We walked in rather late without a reservation (like, 30 mins before the kitchen was about to close for the night). I expected us to be thrown out. But service was beyond phenomenal! We were promptly seated. And we were assigned an awesome waiter. I wish I'd gotten his name. He's a little on the bigger side and very knowledgeable about the menu and makes fantastic recommendations. It was on his cajoling that my husband tried uni for the first time and is now hooked :)
Between the two of us, we pretty much sampled all that the menu had to offer.
I highly recommend their handrolled sushi (Uni), the spicy tuna roll, the julienned potatoes, the maitake roll, tempura soba, the hamachi nigiri, scallop with garlic butter. The seafood was super fresh, which is great given that LV is nowhere near the ocean. The hamachi was perfect, the scallop was seared perfectly and the shrimp tempura was fried to perfection.

We ordered some sake to compliment our meal as well. We asked their resident sake expert to make recommendations. I was ready to pay the price to get in house recommendations. But no, the price was reasonable and we ended up sampling sake we wouldn't have otherwise ordered. Again, I wish I had his name but I failed. 

Yes, you will fork out $200 and upwards on this meal. But trust me, it doesn't get better than this. If you want more bang for your buck, this isn't the place for you. If you want a great fine dining experience, then step right in! :)

YELP doesn't lie.  

I hate to make the price sound like the reason for the low stars, but it is worth mentioning that you will be paying $12 for ONE piece of nigiri sushi.  The claim is that the fish is not more than 24 hours old.  For that price...I should have gone to somewhere else with older fish and at least (2) pieces of nigiri.  :-)

The taste of the food was actually very delicious, the portions were smaller than small and the service was horrible.  

high price + good food + small portions + bad service = 2 stars

Maybe the fact we walked in with no reservation on a Friday night at 8pm and there were only three tables occupied should be a sign. But we wanted good sushi, so we ignored the red flag. Empty house on a Friday night in Vegas means something, and it means awful.

To start, our server was unenthusiastic and said they did not offer Omakase.

He sounded like a sketchy used car dealer. We were like ""um, never mind, thanks"".

We ordered the small sashimi sample plate, small sushi sample plate and a steak dish. We asked him ""is this enough for the two of us""? And he said ""absolutely"". When the food arrived our first reaction was ""is this part 1? Where's part 2?"". Obviously we had to order another small sample plate, and a bunch of other stuff. For the grace of God, the only good thing we got was the jalapeño octopus. It had a lot of flavor and a great kick to it, awesome sauce we later used to dip our tasteless sushi in.

Our server left without saying good bye (rude) and a new friendly and attentive server took over, praise The Lord. Her name is Bonnie. Bonnie was the only positive thing about our night. She was sweet, attentive, she listened well to our disappointment and was very apologetic. She said they get that complain quite often (that the portions were ridiculously small), which made us wonder why in the world don't they do anything about it? Bonnie was awesome.

I understand the concept of fine dining because I worked as a sommelier for a fine dining restaurant back in San Diego. I understand that they dont serve huge portions and I get that sushi is a delicate art, therefore the quality is more important than the quantity. But when you drop $80 on a plate with 5 tiny slices of fish you really expect something mind blowing out of it. Leaving a restaurant still hungry after ordering more than 6 items when this is not a tapas place is simply unacceptable.

$570 later (6 items and a bottle of unfiltered sake plus tip), we headed to our show. Feeling like the two most stupid people on earth for getting so ripped-off. I will never be back again.",4z2AFE6MtXiYNYgoxpQ4vQ,9,2,1,vCQ7gtbKnwiHeZeKDosN-Q

I figured there had to be at least one thing that was good.  The sushi should be supremely fresh at this place and its only average. The service is terrible.   I came late on purpose to meet up with friends to void eating here. Thank god I did so and ended up paying just for my sake and the grilled octopus I ordered just to be considerate. Which was crap. There was an eggplant dish that tasted really weird and not good.

My husband got the Yuzu champagne ($18), which is Yuzu, rose water, and Argyle sparkling wine.  Pretty good but sweet.  I got the ginger shiso mojito ($15) which is rum, muddled ginger, and shiso leaf.  The ginger shiso mojito is kind of bland - no strong ginger flavor or shiso leaf flavor.  So I opted for the gingertini ($16) as my second drink, which was much better.  A much stronger ginger flavor.  They also serve a Wasabtini for $20, but it appears to be just vodka and wasabi. Not worth it, in my opinion, plus you better love wasabi.

For food, we ordered the kanpachi jalapeno sotomaki roll ($24) which is a kanpachi tuna roll with spicy, fried julienne potatoes and jalapenos.  We've had this before and it's always tasty.  

We also ordered the sushi tasting ($75) which took a while to come out for some reason.  The restaurant was pretty empty so I'm not sure why it took so long but the bartenders were really apologetic.  This comes with two toro nigiri and then a variety of single nigiri or rolls including akami, hamachi, hirame, sake, and aji.  About 12 pieces in all.  Very high quality sushi.  Smaller sizes than your average sushi restaurant but they make up for it with the quality of the fish.

The soy sauce and wasabi is also very high quality and you can tell in the flavor.  Real wasabi, not made from a powder.  Big difference.

The bartenders were friendly and chatted with us. They told us their sushi shipment got stuck in NYC with the weather so they did not have all the menu items.  They also showed us how they make wasabi.

It's a fun restaurant but also a restaurant for people who really appreciate high quality sushi.  If you are really fond of AYCE in your average strip mall sushi restaurant, then this probably isn't the place for you.  But if you understand the difference between that and high quality sushi, and are willing to pay for the quality and service, then this restaurant is probably a good bet.",iAevEfcmtCr2cpd6IRqnTA,5,4,4,33uXNugKtKzu8GAJ4pAxVA

LOBSTER TEMPURA ROLL
I don't remember the exact prices for each but I know the salad was AT LEAST $17 and the other dishes were around $20. The slaw was good. I liked the kick of the wasabi in the dressing which I never had before. The octopus was ok. There was no sizzle to the plate it was served in so it just tasted like marinated octopus. The salmon roll was good but tasted ordinary and there was nothing crispy on that sushi. The lobster tempura was the best dish. I could taste the quality of the lobster. I wish it didn't come in only 6 pieces though. Our bill was around $100.  I have to repeat what most people are saying and that is the prices DO NOT justify the taste of the food and the small quantity.

I wish that I could pretty much copy and pasts Albert H.'s review of the restaurant, especially the first paragraph.  Those very reasons are why we decided to try the restaurant.

Some of the best cuts of sushi that we've ever had. It was delicious.  Yes, quite pricey - but worth it for the quality of food that we received. I got the Wasabicress Salad and the Sashimi Sampler.  My husband got various types of sushi and the daikon / granny smith salad.  All seemed perfectly crafted.  The toro and the buri melted in our mouths.

The reason why it got dinged two stars is because of the time it took to get our food.  I saw the various reviews about the slow service and will echo it.  Our server, Mike, was great and the blame was definitely not on him.  The delay seemed to be with the kitchen.  There was a 20 something person group that had arrived about 30 minutes before us and that was likely causing the delay. They were greatly not prepared for it and all the other patrons in the restaurant suffered.  It took almost 30 minutes to get our first dish, and it came out in a weird order.

My friend picked this place since we were staying at the Aria and we could eat small plates style and then move on. Sadly she did not check the yelp reviews. It was August so I didn't think too much of it when I saw the dining room was basically empty, but I think people just know this place is terrible. The dining room is ugly too.

I was shocked at the prices. I know there's a markup for the resort but this is highway robbery. In response to Rod U.'s review, I ordered the lobster risotto and I don't consider that Japanese cuisine and it was the size of a Dixie cup. For $28 (or $38 with shaved white truffles) I expect a least 2 Dixie cups. I had a cold lobster appetizer as well which was excellent. My friend got the restaurant week menu (~$32) and laughed at it when it was presented. She got the steak and it was something you would expect on a children's menu. The presentation was beautiful and the food tastes good, but after the 2 of us spent $130 on food (no alcohol) we had to leave because we were still hungry and getting terrible value for the money. We might as well have put that money in a slot machine. We complained to a person on the staff who refilled our water and cleared dishes. He said it wasn't the first time he had heard something say that.

Each item on the menu is at least $18 alone but usually more. A typical $5 roll elsewhere is $20 here and not worth it taste wise. I was pretty disappointed since I love sushi and ended up ordering udon because the sushi wasn't good. 

I think the miso is cooked with mushrooms and possibly lobster so it's very fishy and has an odd taste to it I didn't like. The service was great but the busser was insanely hard to understand his thick accent when he would talk to us and he always did so with his head down.

So when I was headed to Vegas I was excited to see that Masa had a more ""affordable"" option and it happened to be in the hotel we were staying in.

I will say that it was knockout. It completely lived up to the hype. We also got a roll with sea urchin which was extremely delicious. The dining room was gorgeous but felt kind of cold and I did not like how there was no sushi bar. The sushi came out of the kitchen which felt kind of weird.

After all, I'm not going to a restaurant like BarMasa to ""tank up."" But that said, I feel that BarMasa reaches a level of absurdity in the portion sizes. 

The Octopus dish, as an example was particularly funny. We ordered one for a table of 6 amongst other things. No word from the waiter that this seriously was prob a 1 inch piece of Octopus cut up in little pieces. Now it was well seasoned and I enjoyed, but COME ON - Octopus isn't even that expensive. 

The Kobe skewers were good, but when our party of 6 asked if we could get an addt'l skewer instead of the normal 5 this was not allowed. We offered to pay the difference and this seemed absurd to all of us. 

I could go on here - just a shocking waste of money honestly. There are tons of amazing foodie choices in Vegas and I just feel you are going here if you want to drop stupid amounts of cash with nothing to say for it afterwards. 

The service was the saving grace - great wait-staff that seemed to know the problems with the restaurant and help us through the experience.

2594581,2013-03-23,2,ni4ppUp4oHq-OSSCgUIGiA,"WARNING: Please follow this ""choose your own adventure"" to determine whether or not you will enjoy barMasa: (1) Do you think specialty rolls are what sushi is all about? Don't go here: You'll hate it, think it was too expensive, etc. There are plenty of cheaper places that will handle that. (2) Do you like huge portions and love all-you-can-eat sushi specials (it's when the sushi bar clears out all the about-to-expire fish)? Don't go here: the portions are small, it's quality over quantity. (3) Do you think nigiri (just fish on rice) is nothing special and not the pinnacle of sushi making? Don't go here, this isn't your type of sushi. (4) Do you totally soak every piece of nigiri in a self-made broth of soy sauce and wasabi (rather than a light dab)? This may be a waste of time as you're going to overpower the subtleties. That's not to say your tastes aren't valid, but this will be a waste of your time and you'll probably be giving the 1-3* reviews that misunderstand what this place is about.

What is Michelin 3-star sushi? Simply: the sushi itself. The they only rate the food: taste, quality, and consistency. The 3* sushi bars are all about traditional nigiri and sashimi with only the most basic rolls.  barMasa is _not_ Michelin 3-star sushi (it's the service of Masa Takayama himself at his restaurant in NYC), but it is still exceptional and still worthy to be a Yelp 5* because the Michelin 3-star experience is transcendent. This isn't transcendent. This isn't sitting across from someone like Jiro. Still, on both my visits they've delivered sushi that is of the highest quality and freshness, brought in from Tsukiji Market in Tokyo (an exceptional experience that I recommend to any visitor to Japan). The fish actually does a quick stop in NYC for Masa's core people to inspect it personally before it then goes here. To get the best fish, you need a buyer at the market to make sure you don't get the 3rd rate stuff that often gets shipped to the rest of the world after the Japanese are through with the fish auctions. 

But let me first mention the weak spot: service and ambiance. The dining room's design is a notorious flop in the otherwise gorgeous City Center architecture. After passing a gorgeous entry you're sitting in what feels like a fancy airport waiting area; the ceiling is far too high, and it feels sterile. The server I had was very friendly and accommodating, what you'd expect from a good Vegas restaurant, but he was surprisingly clueless about basic sushi. That's no problem, I was able to essentially hold his hand through my order and he wasn't rude about it (and neither was I). I first visited barMasa right after it opened: the portions then were only 1 piece of nigiri per order. Now they've changed it up to be 1 or 3 pieces per order.

In the end, so long as the fish is great, I can forgive those issues. Thankfully each and every piece was excellent. If you appreciate the different flavors profiles and complexities of each fish, the sushi here will open your mind to subtle aspects you might have missed when fish isn't served with the same quality or at the right temperature. And temperature can make a difference! Most of the fish here comes out at room temperature, with fish cut to traditional cuts (some overflow over the rice). If you're willing to explore the depth of minimal, arguably ""pure"" sushi, this is a lovely place to start. I don't know if I would recommend this to a novice, because spending well over $100 to test what you like might be overkill. 

Overall, I recommend barMasa to anyone looking to enjoy the subtle complexities of traditional sushi. Can you get equal or better sushi in Tokyo for less money? Of course, but that's the point: the fish is shipped here from Tokyo!  If you were able to remain interested after my little serious of questions, give it a look.",n41SjnxHE4t_Vwh5FhNkmg,1,1,5,Td2t6oYNeLYtbFxWRbMToQ

We did order 2 300ml bottles of Pure Dusk sake.  It was recommended by our waitor.  So, we drank while were getting annoyed at times watching everybody get their food.  We were just starving.  We were curious if our waitor was attentive enough to notice we weren't getting our food and wondered if he was proactive enough to get it checked on.

Once we got our entree, they forgot to give me my rice on time to go with my kobe steak.  I did get it after I started eating, which was a waste.  That got me much more annoyed.

For dessert we got the Miso Creme Brûlée.  I didn't even taste any Miso.  Out of this whole experience the Sesame seed Ice Cream was awesome!  I was amazed it tasted just like it.

The waiter did give us a local discount, which was very nice of him.

We had ordered a variety of the starts like the calamari, the Yellowtail, Ahi tataki,  then evolved to the Hamachi Kama and shared a Halibut. All were good but not extraordinary. If I had a choice, I would have went to SushiSamba for sure or Nobu for the expierience. Being local , ""I Love Sushi"" in Henderson, definitely is a better call. Apologies for this.

I ordered the Sushi sampler for 75$ which came with about 12 pieces of chef's choice sushi, 3 piece tuna roll, 3 piece cucumber roll. The friendly waiter (the only thing good about this restaurant was friendly service) had bragged that all the sushi was flown in exclusively from Japan.

The sushi quality was just about as good as one you'd find at a Sushi restaurant that sells 10$ bento box specials.

I've never been to a restaurant categorized as fine dining to be this horrible from start to finish! 

stayed at ARIA couple of weeks ago for the wknd and wanted to dine inside the restaurant mainly due to convenience. saw this beautiful lobby to the restaurant and looked at the menu...i think the uni risotto and foie gras was the decision maker for us to go here. 

got to the front to ask, 
first question: do we need to make reservations?, their response was ""it's highly recommended"" OK!! not even a ""hello""! WTF! 
second question: do you have an opening for 8PM?, their response was ""no, but what about 7:45PM. OK!! really??? 
third question: what's your next availability after 7:45PM, their response was ""unfortunately, we do not have ANYTHING available"" 

WOW!! so i'm thinking sure 745PM is good....get back to our room to relax a little then we hurry to get ready in order to make our reservation. I was very apologetic b/c we were 15 minutes late and the host takes us to our seats. WTF! the place is more then half empty!! Who are they kidding???? REALLY? You couldn't give me a later reservation?? 

OK, so we look at the menu and ordered the Uni Risotto with Black Trumpet Mushroom with Truffle, Peking Duck with Foie Gras in Moo-Shu Skin and couple of other items not even worth mentioning. Everything came in such small portions and it tasted like CRAP!! I also asked for a recommendation for sake and the waiter said the sparkling sake was really good. I warned him that I do not like sweet alcohol b/c most people just assume that girls like sweet drinks. The sparkling wine was sweet...yuck!! 
We literally stayed for 30 minutes which cost the 3 of us $300 and we ended up going to another restaurant right after b/c we were still hungry!! 
I wish I did my research before going here but we were in a hurry and didn't have time!

I ordered the unagi roll with avocado and my company ordered a California roll, since they didn't know what else to get, lol. My unagi roll came in 5 pieces and was good.

5. Oh so a simple avacado roll was like $17.  Really!!!!  

Good. 
1. The jalapeno Martini- delicious but very spicy so it kind of killed the sushi tasting at one point. but it was good because it hid the not so super fresh tasting fish. Oh yeah for $75 it should be almost still alive.

Anyway, we had 7:30pm reservations, which we figured would be enough time to eat light and head to the Rio for Penn & Teller at 9. Little did we know that it would take 30 minutes from the time we placed our order, to the time we received our first dish (Kobe Garlic Soy Steak), then another 30 minutes before we received our Sashimi Tasting and plate of 6 Nigiri sushi pieces. Everyone around us, who got seated and ordered after us, got their sushi before us and much faster. Service, nonetheless, could have been MUCH better. Granted the place just opened 10 days ago, for the price we were paying for the food, we expected better than average service. This was unacceptable. 

The food, on the other hand, was high-quality sashimi/sushi. Sure, the pieces were small, but there are not many places you can get the selection of fish they have outside of Tsukiji fish market in Japan. The prices are what they are because of the environment you're in and the quality of the food. Don't go in expecting the same mediocre rolls you see at the corner Japanese Sushi bar run by non-Japanese. The other commenters below (except for Jen L.) had ridiculous expectations. This is a high-end restaurant in a high-end hotel. If you're going to try Barmasa (or Shaboo for that matter), expect a significant price tag and a menu of different kinds of high-quality fish (and meats -- kobe and wagyu) that you won't normally see. 

All-in-all, I hope that the service becomes more polished fast. The food alone would have warranted a 4-5 stars from me, but the fact that the waitress didn't know what she was talking about and our orders took considerably longer than it should have keeps me from rating Barmasa greater than a 2.

And to promote the new Aria hotel, MGM has giving away $100 dining credits to any of the Aria restaurants.  So hearing they opened a Bar Masa in Las Vegas in the brand new Aria hotel, we figured we'd try it out.  $100 dining credit would at least put a bit of a dent in the huge bill that we anticipated.  Because this place is very expensive.   More so than I expected

I absolutely love sushi so I was really looking forward to trying lots of their sushi.  Unfortunately, we learned from our server right away that their orders of nigiri are for one piece, not the normal 2.  That really took the wind out of my sails.  So after ordering tuna, salmon, yellowtail and toro, and the kampachi jalapeno appetizer, the $100 dollar credit was pretty used up.  We realized that this would get super expensive if we kept ordering sushi so we stopped.  Their sushi selection is very good though, having lots of things that you won't find at most other sushi places.  But we stuck to the stuff we knew for our first time there (Who knows when the next will be) and the quality was really great.  However, I didn't think it was so amazingly better than a lot of the great places I've eaten at in California.   30 dollars for 2 pieces of toro is alot.  12 for salmon, etc.  The kampachi appetizer also had salty potato bits on it which I though took away.   We also ordered a yellowtail with scallions (negi hama) cut roll which was great.  The wasabi was great and my wife enjoyed the ginger, but that should be expected.  

We then ordered some hot food.  We got the kobe beef sukiyaki and their black cod dish.  Both were very good.  My wife thought the cod dish at Ame in San Francisco was a little better but both were very similar.  The kobe beef was very tender and flavorful in a good sauce.  The mushrooms in it were excellent.  

I know others have complained about the service, but I thought it was great.  They were very attentive.  Our food came out fast and our server was definitely helpful.  He told us before ordering that sushi orders were only one piece.  

So overall, it was a different and good experience.  The food was very good but it was definitely pricey.  The $100 dining creidt helped alot, so I recommend taking advantage of the deal MGM has been running.  At this point though, knowing I can get very good suhi at other places for half the price, I can't give this place too high of a rating.  I am glad that we tried it though.",Cea45bU6zSRZSer822iobw,1,0,3,3ejGDEHSo9lkio7jpHt6ww

We really don't care about how expensive it is as long as it taste good. We ordered the Sashimi Tasting Plate, the Kobe beef and Uni. Surprise, surprise, the waiter came back and told us that they ran out of Uni. How do you run out of Uni at a sushi place with barely any customers?

Our food came out and the Sashimi plate was a big disappointment. How can you say this taste fresh or even good? You don't have to be sushi expert to know this was so mediocre. The Kobe beef came out next and it doesn't look very appetizing. It tasted okay but it didn't ""wow"" us. 

My boyfriend says the only thing he liked was the steamed rice. Yes, you absolutely read that. At least with steamed rice there's no high expectations on what it's suppose to taste like. It taste like rice and you can't complain on how horrible it taste.

The ambiance is kind of a modern concrete and wood surreal with a hint of airey awkwardness, the service was pre-meditated snobby, with a twist of yes we are only a third full.

The menu looks more interesting than it is. The sushi was also for Lilliputians, WTH?? If it was awesome quality I could almost understand, but it was just, fine. The sushi size was about half a pinky, I shit you not.

3333258,2011-06-08,4,ni4ppUp4oHq-OSSCgUIGiA,"I'll preface the review by saying that Masa in NYC is one of my favorite restaurants.  I fully understand that, often enough, Vegas satellites tend to be only a shadow of their non-Vegas counterparts, but I was not prepared for the level of my disappointment at BARMASA.

Even approaching the hostess desk at BARMASA I felt a sense of excitement (despite the incorrect signage in the Aria Casino directing you to ""Masa""--I can now speculate on the story behind that).  That excitement immediately evaporated the second I turned the corner around the entryway and viewed the main dining area:  Certainly ""consistent"" (to put it as kindly as possible) with the rest of Aria's decor, but uninspiring and, frankly, gloomy.  Granted, it was 6pm on a Wednesday, so possibly the ""vibe"" of the restaurant was not at its peak, but I could not help but feel utterly deflated...and this was even before I thought about the food.

Even though I was meeting up with a friend, I was first invited to dine at the bar.  I thought this could be a real treat--the ""bar"" area at Masa (where your food is prepared right in front of you) is an incredible experience, especially on top of the NYC restaurant's beautiful Japanese hinoki wood counter.  Not at BARMASA:  Their bar is just a plain, old uninspiring bar.  A little surprising for Vegas not to splurge on a highlight like a hinoki wood counter (even if it might be at the cost of the quality of the food).  I opted for a table--the host explaining how the bar overlooks the entire restaurant reminded me of a real estate agent trying to explain away a defect as a design feature.

With respect to the food, all of the reviewers are spot-on in saying that it is overpriced.  I would be okay with the prices if the food was of matching quality, but this was not the case at BARMASA.  The Kobe Beef  and Garlic Fried Rice ($34) was rather pedestrian, and nothing about the dish appropriately highlighted the kobe beef.  The Nameko and Tofu Miso Soup was okay and a relative bargain at $9.  The Masa ""Toro Toro"" Roll ($48)--a slightly-on-the-large-side five-piece roll featuring the fatty Bluefin tuna--was a bland mess.  I would recommend instead just getting a $9 piece or two of toro from the a la carte menu.  There was very limited substance taste-wise to the Chicken Yakitori Skewers ($30).  The lone bright spot among the dishes we had was the Peking Duck with Foie Gras in Moo-Shu Skin ($26).  It was so good (and relatively small at just four pieces) that we got another one.  (This, sadly, should also give you a sense of the small portions you get for your money at BARMASA.)  In fact, the Peking Duck is the only thing that is saving BARMASA from getting a one-star review in my book.

Service was good, although maybe a little lacking in attentiveness.  Do not expect a high level of service that you might expect when spending the same amount of money at another restaurant.",kHGRDaZt4nHgNSJcjOTDeQ,5,3,2,tib4ZAG8nEwwm3O26QfUnA

$22 for a standard boring salmon / avocado sushi roll you would pay $6 for in an average sushi joint. 
$28 for ""BBQ Lamb"" which was small bowl of greasy and fried onions! The lamb wasn't even nice! It was mixed up and greasy like you'd get from a kebab truck!!!  EXTORTION!!

And I left there still hungry.  Not only were the portions small, but the food itself had no taste.  We ordered Kobe Steak Yakisoba... sounds good right?!  Um, NO!  They used singapore noodles, which would've been okay if the dish had flavor.  It tasted like dry noodles.  And the ""kobe steak,""  um, I think not.   We also ordered a Hamachi Kama dish.... fish head/collar.  The collar is supposed to be super meaty.  Well, at other Japanese restaurants it is.   The dish comes out and all it was was bones and eyeballs.  YUCK!  And then we also tried the sushi platter... um, yeah.  The nigiri sushi was miniature toy size.  Unbelievable.   Oh, okay, I take back what I said. There was one dish that I thought was ""ok"" in terms of taste. The agedashi tofu.  But you get three bite size tofu and the dish was $20.  Yep.... all in all.

During our stay at the gorgeous Aria, the bf and I were craving some delicious sushi so we decided to check out barMasa. I really wish we hadn't. After seeing the beyond elaborate descriptions of each item to play up the menu choices, limited guests in dining area and the tiny plates we started seeing come out, we regretted having put our order in. We we're in for a total disappointment once it came out...

This is exactly what we ordered to start off:

Shrimp and Scallop skewers (five skewers/order): there was literally one shrimp and one scallop cut into quarters on what looked like an oversized toothpick to give you an idea  of how small each skewer was.

Kanpachi jalapeño sotomaki with spicy potato julienne (sushi roll): each piece was half the size of golfball; you get five pieces to an order.

a martini...I forget which one, but it was drinkable.

A Japanese canned beer, ""Aooni"" less than 12 ounces (there isn't any draft beer BTW).

We ate the food-- it was bland, and gone literally in less than10 minutes. We  continued to sip our drinks in disappointment  and decided not to order anything else. We were on a mission to get a real meal elsewhere. When our server came by to check on our experience, the bf was honest: the food was bland and truly disappointed on the portions. Our server apologized to which we said, ""It's not your fault"". It truly wasn't, his service was on point. 

While waiting on our check, the manager walked over  to our table and expressed her concern about our disappointing dining experience. She apologized and asked what we didn't like about the experience. My bf and I commented on the bland and plain taste, not to mention the lacking portions. I am quoting the manager on her response ""That's how our chef makes his food- plain and simple. Very little flavor."" I understand traditional Japanese cuisine is simple, but it's NOT bland and lacking flavor. She apologized again, nicely, then walked away. 

Suggestion to barMasa: Customers should come in hungry BUT NOT leave hungry, so amp up your portions, otherwise keep your prices as plain and simple as your food.

The food at Masa was good. Not great, not exciting, just good. For a check to come out to $180 for 2 people and , even at a high end restaurant, and only provide so little satisfaction,  is simply unacceptable.

Between myself and my dad, we had chicken yakitori, shrimp fried rice, wagyu beef fried rice, and a piece of o-toro for myself (I can never resist)

The chicken was ok, but incredibly small pieces on the skewers.  4 times more expensive than the next most expensive yakitori i've ever ordered, and i've had a lot of yakitori in my day.

The rice dishes were ok, but not particularly better than what i'd eat an any local chinese takeout in any town in america.

The toro was delicious, as toro should be. That being said, even in a fine Tokyo establishment they have given me at least a larger piece that the minuscule morsel at Masa.

As for the atmosphere, it's a nice place, it really is. between the high ceilings, minimalistic interior, and low seating, the openness of the place felt off for a restaurant though. Kind of like an airport terminal. 

There is plenty of Japanese food to be found in Las Vegas, and it's sure to be cheaper and better. There is absolutely no reason to choose BarMasa.",AjxhPBEM7J1Pll9QQ4EgUA,2,0,1,LorjXBLMkRiDWfJQSuumCw

We visited BarMasa (finally) after many years of staying at Aria and just never giving it a chance, and now that we have tried it - we cannot wait to go back!

The restaurant is huge, and to be honest, the concept is a little confusing.  You have to decide which side of the restaurant you want to sit on (BarMasa vs. Tetsu), so if you want sushi, go with BarMasa (but menus for either are available at both restaurants)...and if you do, ask for Michael's section!!!!  He is the reason for this review, and the main reason we want to go back to this restaurant.  From the moment he greeted us, we liked him, and by the end of the meal, we were following him on Instagram.  We let him guide us through the menu, and were not disappointed.  He introduced us to some new, exciting flavors & ingredients, as well as some excellent 'secret' sauces that are not on the menu.  His service, and his personality really elevated our dining experience and lifted our spirits for the rest of the trip.

I wish I could remember all of the delicious things we tried...but I was truly so caught up in enjoying the experience, I completely lost track of everything we ate!  BUT - I do know that we had a raw hamachi dish that was wonderful, and a chicken satay dish from the Tepanyaki side of the menu that my husband said was some of the best chicken he has ever had (with one of those signature/special sauces along with the regular sauce), but other than that, it's all just a happy memory of good food and good conversation, and I know we'll be back!

We ordered the yellowtail with scallion roll, salmon roll, kobe beef udon, chicken karaage, kobe beef fried rice, and salmon sashimi.

The udon was delicious according to my friend, so I guess that's that. The fried rice was waaaay too salty, tender meat tho. The sashimi was ONE piece of fish the size of my small toe at $6.

My friend Susan D. and I made reservations for Saturday night at 7 PM.  Sporting my brand new crazily blingy sparkly new shoes, I trounced through Aria with anticipation.  We were escorted by our beaus, who trotted off to the Aria buffet while we went in search of opulence.

We were seated in this stunning restaurant, with lights hanging from the ceiling and red accents everywhere.  Our server was Chase.  I started off with a Jalapeno Ja cocktail (house made jalepeno vodka with lime and muddled cucumber, garnish: 2 slices of Persian cucumber on a toothpick) and Susan opted for the Kyoto Cheers (soju, lychee, pomengranate).

Our 3 course meal: we both started off with tuna-yellowtail ceviche (normally $28 on the menu!), then each got the 10 piece sushi sampler at Chase's recommendation (over $70 if ordered a la carte), and then for dessert Susan ordered the miso creme brulee and I ordered the yuzu sorbet.

The ceviche: cubed maguro and hamachi, grated daikon, fresh snipped chives, tiny diced raw jalepeno with a yuzu-esque sauce.  Scrumptious!

Our chef's choice sushi: 2 pieces of chu-toro, 2 pieces hamachi belly, 2 pieces of tai, 2 pieces nama sake, and 2 pieces amaebi (no heads).  Someone had a heavy hand with wasabi on the fish (okay to Susan, a bit too much for me).  The toro was a surprise for this type of menu.  Tai was too tough.  Amaebi was something special.  A very nice chef's choice for sure.

We ordered a few things off the menu before getting to dessert (so yes, this did not end up as just $50 per person!) - Susan ordered the peking duck and foie gras fried rice - I tried it and it was very tasty.  I got one piece saba (smoky, unusual flavor), one piece anago (sea eel, hard to find but nothing exciting), and uni (small but very fresh and flavorful - POW in my mouth!).

Then, Susan peer pressured me into another cocktail!  Still thinking of my gal Jaime W. and our spicy drink pursuits, I went for spicy drink #2 with Bacardi O, yuzu juice, fresh mint and floating shichimi togarashi pepper flakes.  

Finally we made it to dessert.  Her miso creme brulee was very tasty, but my yuzu sorbet (which actually was more like a granita) was outstanding, bright citrus-y with a sprinkle of mint.  Overall, great food and service - big plus to the generous offerings for restaurant week and getting about 55% off the price of what we had.

FIRST AND FOREMOST....we had the best alcoholic beverage of our entire lives here! It's called the Very Very Berry.....a 6 month fruit infused Vodka. Seriously dangerous. I had 3 of them and could have kept going but glad I didn't.

FOOD: We started with the sizzling Wagyu filet that came in a cast iron skillet simmering in clarified tallow. OMG. Soooo good! Then, the Toro Suji, grilled Fatty Tuna, and Wild Bluefin. We also had my favorite thing...the Beef Garlic Fried Rice. I will fly back to Vegas just to have these dishes again. We finished with an off the menu Sake Ice Cream.....and also the AH-MAZING Miso Creme Brulee!

However I feel the need to add onto all these existing negative reviews about Bar Masa because it was just such a disappointment.  Did Masayoshi Takayama really open this place?

I loved my stay at Aria during Memorial weekend, so I expected the restaurants to be just as fantastic.  Unfortunately I was totally let down by all 3 restaurants that i ate at inside Aria, the worst one being Bar Masa.  I was really looking forward to my dinner here because I read how great their location in NY is.  Upon walking up to the restaurant, I was wowed by the entrance, those massive copper doors and the gorgeous orange lights were amazing.  But that was pretty much all I found to be amazing about this place.  After stepping into the restaurant and turning the corner to reach the main dining room, I was kind of shocked to see how huge and cold the space was.  I usually like modern and minimalistic decors but the ceiling was just way too high, and all that space was just unnecessary, it made the restaurant look extremely unwelcoming.  

Now onto the food, I can pretty much sum it up in 2 words - unreasonably expensive.  The food was not worth it and the tiny portions were not justified by the quality either.  And can someone explain to me why they bring out your dishes in wooden boxes?  Is it so that we don't see how small the portions are until they put it right in front of us?  If the sushi and sashimi were melt in your mouth delicious then I wouldn't mind the stinginess but no, it was just ok, hence the stinginess is insulting. None of the dishes I ordered excited my taste buds.  My bf and I walked out $200 poorer and hungry.  Shame on you chef Takayama!",EWJMLFFl9po0E8dRWuHOOA,3,1,2,0Ly0oY6iHbDDv8bNoWkjaA

I read some of the other reviews telling others not to complain about the portions and pricing. Sorry, but I kind of have to. The portions are way too small for its price.

Here's what we ordered:

Sizzling Scallop Garlic Butter - I remember this dish was $28 and it came with FOUR thin scallops. It literally looked like one big scallop thinly sliced into four pieces. The sauce just tasted like plain butter with a hint of lemon.

Uni Califlower Risotto with White Truffle - The flavor on this dish wasn't bad, but it had no Uni flavor to it whatsoever. This was the dish I looked most forward to. It was so small, we finished it in four bites.

Yellowtail with Scallion Roll - Hamachi didn't taste fresh and neither did the scallions.

Beef Garlic Fried Rice - I have no complaints about this dish. It was portioned pretty well and the flavor was great. The beef was really tender.

Grilled Chilean Sea Bass - It was a decent sized portion of the fish but it lacked flavor. It just tasted a little like lemon. 

The service was just okay. The workers were friendly but not attentive. We had to flag down a busser to grab someone to take our order.

If you balked at the portions or prices, barMasa is not for you.

Before you judge, no, I do not believe the prerequisite for a great dining experience be an incredibly expensive menu or use of exclusive ingredients.  My most memorable Vegas dining experience came from a burger at In-n-Out.  That said, for those who are willing to try, barMasa delivers the best, most authentic Japanese cuisine in Vegas.

The manager himself pefaces your meal by stating ""this is a kaiseki like meal"".  Kaiseki literally refers to monks holding a stone against their stomach to ward off hunger pains.  This is a meal of appreciation, NOT volume.

The maitake truffle nigiri, the perfect bite balancing the earthy flavor of the maitake and supercharging the umame overtones.  The incredibly high quality, gently compacted rice providing a hint of sweetness, its seasoning providing the kiss of acidity.  The flavor of the mushroom goes on and on.

The same is said for the king crab nigiri.  The very small piece of crab is the right size to balance all the flavors yet finishing with the incredible sweetness and oceanic goodness that is king crab.  Simply put, more crab would lessen overpower the dish and lessen the appreciation.

The grilled maitake mushrooms finished with a pinch of salt, flawless.  Meaty texture and an incredible explosion of flavor with each bite.  A sip of sake whose flavor profile provides the same earthy, mushroom flavor, and the dish is perfect.

The signature Masa toro tartare caviar so perfectly balanced.  Every day toro (not o toro) is topped with caviar.  The yolky, briny, salty flavor of the caviar brings out the gentle sweetness of the toro and heightens the fresh fish flavor.  The chef's decision not to use the highest quality toro is brilliant as higher fat would have marred the clean mouth finish.

The list goes on and on, from an exquisite mixed tempura plate to a fried rice of duck and foie.   Each dish highlights a single, primary ingredient so brilliantly with portion sizes appropriate not to ruin the experience.  True Japanese sensibility.

The largest selection of sake in Vegas backs the menu.  The sommelier is very knowledgeable with the offerings.  Typical Vegas resort markup.   Decent wine list but do try the sake.

Service is very friendly and professional.

Simply put, the best Japanese cuisine in Vegas.",oeAhRa8yFa9jtrhaHnOyxQ,30,25,5,Gi3ZiMVZ7si7PKcZi3nTog
5113511,2011-12-06,0,ni4ppUp4oHq-OSSCgUIGiA,"I always feel kind of sorry for the plight of good sushi places in America.  Even back home in the San Francisco Bay area, no matter how masterful the sushi chef, no matter how recently the exotic seafood was flown in from Tsukiji, no matter how inexplicable the characters on the menu posted on the window, no matter how high the prices are, somebody is going to walk in the door, ask for a california roll to go, and complain about the price.

Bar Masa is a beautifully huge space in a brand new Las Vegas casino.  It's impressive what they're trying to do here, but it is also perhaps doomed to failure ... not so much because folks here don't regularly drop large amounts of money on good food, but because the generalized expectation of sushi in the USA is still that of a lower quality product, still considered one of the more expensive options for dinner.  To expect to fill such a large space night after night with folks who understand and seek out high quality Japanese cuisine with the willingness to pay for it is perhaps overly optimistic.

So - what do we have here?  Some of the best, most carefully prepared fish I've had in a long time.  A decent bar with a good sake selection.  Some interesting rolls, cooked dishes and combinations.  A lot of fatty tuna belly - something often reserved for a single piece of sushi topping off a great meal is sprinkled around liberally.  It's possibly to easily spend several hundred dollars a person here without really trying ... but knowing the ingredients, that is not surprising.

We sampled most parts of the the menu, except maybe the fried section - the food was generally among the best in its category.  Uni risotto is rightly famous.  The nigiri sampler is a good deal and quite interesting ( and since the sushi chefs are tucked away somewhere else, you can share the individual pieces without risking wrath from above ).  I think that the raw fish dishes are the best thing here by far, but I just like good, high quality raw fish.

Service, though not always the quickest, seemed to us friendly, accommodating, and well able to adjust to customers of different goals and expectations.  The inexperienced table beside us sent back some toro because it was too strong tasting; maybe just not what they expected.  I was surprised that they were accommodated.

I liked the food here a lot - the best Japanese food we've had in Las Vegas by a long shot, and surprisingly not as far below someplace like Urawasa in LA as you might expect.  The experience in a vast space rather than a cozy sushi bar is quite a different one, but the quality of food has withstood the transition remarkably well.  Four stars, not five, because it's difficult to pay this much for an experience that in the end is much less personal than one could get elsewhere.  No reflection on the quality of the food.

In the end, I'm just not sure that the demand for this sort of cuisine is going to be enough for the restaurant to survive in this form ... but while it is here, if you are ready to pay for really good sushi, this is *the* place to go.",JjTusdmnjHxKe-Kqwr0YGA,5,2,4,6dLVcBkYkkyP87QJWXri8A

This place was a high end robbery.  According to husband.  They ordered Uni sushi, seared wagyu sushi and a yellowtail sashimi nigiri.  The size was so small they had to laugh.  The yellowtail was $12 for 1 mind you 1 piece of sushi.  It's half the size of what you would get elsewhere, but most places gives you 2 pieces of sushi, not 1 piece.  The length of the yellowtail sashimi was approximately 1 1/2 in. long and approx. 1/2 wide.  All their sushi is 1 piece only.

Hubby and Dad had garlic soy wagyu steak which only had  8 thin slices.  This should have been on the appetizer menu not the dinner menu.  The cost for this dish was $68 each.  

The miso soup was  ala carte and was served in a tiny bowl, don't know what was in it since Dad had it and the cost for the soup was $12.  

Brother had sukiyaki.  He said it was good but not for dinner just a teaser.

All the entres' are appetizer portions, so beware if you go.

Over all this was a sad experience, everyone left hungry with a tab of $400 for their experience.

Hubby had to get something else to eat elsewhere.

There are lots of other upscale restaurants that give you  more bang for your bucks.

We don't think this place will survive unless they change their portions for their prices.

Aside from that the great specialty drinks and very knowledgeable staff the food leaves something to be desired. There are exceptions to certain dishes so take that in mind. TJ was upfront and honest with the highlights of the menu and what to skip. I just wish I would have asked before ordering. Starting with the Chicken Dumplings with cilantro.  They were good though nothing extraordinary and your local Japanese spot could muster these up just as well. Skip the Garlic fried Chicken in which TJ was honest in skipping everything off of the fried menu. Chick Fil A has better tasting chicken nuggets. The Calamari with Jalapeño salt was great, crisp flavor not overpoweringly spicy  The name is a bit misleading ask if you have questions. The yellowtail with scallions was normal sushi there was nothing that stood out, I'd skip that as well.  The rib-eye steak with garlic soy is another item that didn't appease the taste buds. If you want a great steak head over to Gordon Ramsay steak or one of the other plentiful steak spots in Vegas. The highlight of the meal was something that wasn't on the menu. Masa was in the process of switching from their winter menu to the spring menu. Ask your server if their are some hidden gems left off the menu. Fried Rice with Foie Gras sounds simple but was amazing. I'm not a liver fan at all but this dish I enjoyed.  It's a must and definitely the best bang for buck at Masa.

Very expensive restaurant, I would call it a restaurant version of HERMES;)
So expect the bill to be $$$$$, even lunch for two with drinks(beer and iced tea) was over $150. We ordered Akami tuna with avocado roll and some appetizers. 
The roll was really tasty, thin layer of rice with big chunks of bluefin tuna and avocado was very satisfying.
Rolls usually start at around $30. Tuna & avocado roll was $28, I think. 

Waiter was cool but we didn't receive the service that's worth the amount of tip we left.

Overall I give BarMasa 4 stars. I shouldn't complain about the price because I went in knowing this is the most expensive restaurant in the U.S. But!! I expected better. Appetizers were good but I've had something similar to their quality at much more reasonable Japanese restaurants in LA.

I usually do not factor in price to my reviews.  I try to concentrate on the experience itself and give a rating based on that alone.  I do that because I always am aware of the cost of my dining experiences and am willing to pay for what I get.  However, in the case of Bar Masa, I had such a case of sticker shock that I had to factor it in.  I stopped in late one night after a poker tournament and ordered some Sushi. Salmon, Eel and Hamachi.

When my order arrived it was one small piece of each for $8.00 each.  They were all very good, but I was still hungry so I ordered the special Mushroom Roll. It was one of the best Rolls I have ever had.  Thin, seared beef outside and a mix of exotic Mushrooms inside.

My food was good, but at almost $80 for three pieces of Sushi, one roll and one small carafe of Sake, it should have been amazing! Another thing that bothered me is that even though this is a Sushi Restaurant, there is no Sushi Bar.  As a frequent solo diner I  like being able to sit at the bar and interact with other customers and the Chef.

Service was prompt and professional but rather stiff and stuffy.  They are a brand new restaurant, so they are obviously wheelchair accessible. Since Bar Charlie is closed, I was hoping Bar Masa could match it in terms of quality and value.

In reading the reviews on Yelp it seems a good deal of the negativity is based on the prices.

Yes, Bar Masa is expensive.  So are all the other 'finer' restaurants I've eaten at over the years that are on The Strip.

With my expectation set that the meal was going to be pricey, my focus was really on the food and service, both which i found to be EXCEPTIONAL.

We had a saki tasting which was fun and informative.  I highly recommend it and I really have an entirely new appreciation for saki.  Our meal consisted of the seasonal sashimi tasting (more than enough for 2 people and included melt in your mouth Toro), an order of wasabi blast tuna, and three  rolls - The Toro Toro roll, a spicy tuna roll and a Kanpachi jalapeno sotomaki with spicy potato julienne roll.

I love sushi, and living in NYC I have access to many excellent sushi restaurants.  With that said, hands down, Bar Masa is tied with #1 in my book (I give it a 'tie' with Sushi Yasuda in New York).

I really felt compelled to write this review based on all the negative ones that I've read.  If money is an issue, there are certainly other sushi restaurants on The Strip that are quite good, for less money,  However, if you want a real treat, give Bar Masa a try!!

We ordered quite a bit of food, but were still hungry afterwards. The prices were extremely high and the portions were small. The waiter did warn us that they were tapas. We had a few rolls. A few that stood out were the yellowtail with scallions and the salmon roll. They were both so delicious that we ordered more of each roll. It was demonstrable the fish was fresh and of good quality, which was then confirmed by the waiter, that the fish has been dead for less than 48 hours.  

Other than the sushi, we also tried the lamb and chicken skewers. The chicken skewers were a joke. I understand they are tapas, but putting chicken on a toothpick and pretending it is a skewer is a tease. The shredded lamb (I don't recall the actual name of the dish) was bland. It lacked a certain ingredient which I couldn't figure out what.

What really turned me off was the atmosphere and decor.
The place is massive, cold and the lighting was very flat, depressing and unflattering.  Though the interior was modern and cool, it was nothing special and felt like I was in an empty half built cafeteria (there must have been only 3 tables that were occupied in the carnivorous space) devoid of any character.  There wasn't even any music, which made the space errily silent.  I did not feel comfortable at all.

The menu looked rather uninspiring, and after hearing all of the disappointing reviews here on Yelp, I was happy that I didn't take a chance eating here.

Tiny portions and a typical tab of $500+ on top of that would have made me really angry.  I have had excellent shabu from other restaurants with much livelier atmosphere, satisfying portions and personable service for a tenth of the price here.

Seeing how expensive the restaurant must have costed to build and the near empty dining room on a typically busy restaurant night, I can't see this restaurant surviving much longer.

The restaurant is very modern with a super high ceiling so it feels very open. I loved the feel but my mom preferred a more intimate setting such as the vibe at Sage.

I took my mom here and we ordered: toro tartare, chicken karaage, sweet shrimp and uni roll, and a wagyu garlic fried rice. (my mom and I can put it away!but then again the portions here are not big at all)

 everything wass really awesome and fresh! There wasn't any sauces that covered up any of the ingredients so you can really taste each thing and you know that there is quality in their stuff. 

The tartare was pricey($68) but the amount of caviar we got on it made it more than worth it. 

The chicken was super juicy, and the crispy skin was as good as pork rinds. Add a spritz of lemon and I was good to go. No mayo needed! 

The sweet shrimp and uni roll was something I've never seen before but I love both ingredients, and this roll did not disappoint, because their uni was that perfect balance of briney and sweet. 

Lastly the fried rice was muy bueno. The rice was fluffy and loose and most importantly not greasy! & The beef? Super tender! My mom wanted less green onions in it but I didn't mind one bit. IMO garlic/onion makes everything awesome!

So far so good! Definitely going back to try the rest of the menu with a emptier belly!

If you haven't been to neither Masa or BarMasa at the AOL/Time Warner in  NYC, you will feel that this sushi spot is overpriced. However, if you admire Chef Masa Takayama in NYC with his Omakase style at Masa or the 26 seats BarMasa, you will appreciate the type of freshness fishes & ingredients he brought here to Aria.

I've been to both places in NY & at Masa there, the chef doesn't allow pictures taken when I was there a few years back. At this place, I'm allowed to take pictures, so that's a big step!

The inviting door with red illuminating lighting was really nice, via left takes us to the spacious dining area which I was at shocked kept staring at the architecture, unsure whether or not I like it! It reminds me  of airplane hangar. It wasn't warm at all as I was imagined. The architect and designed like the rest of Aria hotel was quiet futuristic for my taste. And to compare this & his NY spot, this place missing the cozy, intimate, & warm feeling.

The food was on point, just as good as the one in NYC. Pricing is the same as well. These dishes I highly recommend:

- Sizzling Spicy Octopus with black trumpet mushroom $28 - a nice dish with a light subtle spicy kick to it.

- Tai Sea Bream with black truffle - Summer Truffles 5 pcs $48. Really refreshing dish, exquisite.

- Kobe Garlic Soy Steak $68 - 9 pcs sliced nicely perfectly pink inside & warm outside on the iron plate - this was so an awesome treat!

- Seasonal Sushi Tasting $98 - 13 pcs from Japan & you can't get any bettter quality of sushi than this. & also coems with 3 pieces of  Tekkamaki Tuna roll, & 3 pieces of Kappamaki Cucumber roll
           1. Sake salmon, scottish king
            2. Toro fatty tuna, boston blue fin
            3. Hirame fluke, wakayama, japan
            4. Hamachi young yellowtail, kyushu, japan
            5. Kanpachi amber jack, shikoku island, japan
            6. Shimaaji island jack fish, wakayama, japan - the shiniest fish! I love it!
            7. Aji horse mackerel, chiba, japan
            8. Amaebi sweet shrimp, ishikawa, japan
            9. Mirugai giant clam, chiba, japan
           10. Amadai tile fish, chiba, japan
           11. Hokkaido Scallops hokkaido japan
           12. Seguro baby anchovy, chiba, japan
           13. Saba mackerel, miyagi, japan

Food was as fresh as it can get, the service was a bit off. Our server was very nice, but when i asked him 3 different time of certain ingredients where they came from; he didn't know the answer. I wish he would wen tot eh kitchen to ask the chef & came back. Instead of told us he didn't know right away!  This wouldn't never happens in NY location. Although he was very attentive to us.

Chef Masa Takayama was in town this past weekend, but he left by the time we got there. 

Note: Also @ shaboo it was $500 for Omakase, it went down to $300 on Friday 4/16/10 to attract more diners I'm sure.",JADdo9NEeO5Az9aOYbyvZA,6,5,4,cBVuEfH65527VzqE-g7gjA

We got a cucumber salad that came with a few pieces of cucumber in some mediocre sauce and cost $18! The waitress told us how great the seaweed salad too so we got that but was so nasty I couldn't have more than 2 bites. Everything there tasted weird in some way. We got their salmon sushi which the waitress claimed is flown overnight from Japan daily. It was very mushy and soft. The taste was ok, but the texture didn't feel right to me.

We had to head to another restaurant to eat.....",Yb14C72rNSQW3vylBP8fTA,3,0,1,5Og_9N8Iv5s5X--aOZEQ8Q

What I really didn't like was the price,  it is way over priced.  We paid $350 for 2 of us and we didn't order anything special or pig out.  It's expensive bc a bottle of Fiji (I think it was Fiji) water was $8.  I wouldn't go back bc the price point and I'm not sure if I liked the food.

I would skip any of their cocktails ($20) I ordered a Japanese mule (I forgot the name) and I swear it was about a half shot of vodka and a splash of ginger beer and the rest was crushed ice.",HIvLc_kktuTfCxlSAfTAPg,0,0,3,3WrW__2xj3axmlL2YJK2HQ

I'm not a stickler when it comes to paying up for GOOD food, but I pay up for GOOD food. I do not pay up for mediocrity. At Bar Masa, that's what you get. 5 star price for 2 star food.

I should have known when we went during prime dinner time before the 9 PM Zarkana seating (Zarkana was ok but there are much better Cirque shows than this one) and the place was practically empty.  But it was easy because it was in Aria by  Zarkana and we thought it couldn't be that bad.  I should have Yelped barMASA before eating here.

Here is why barMASA fails: (1) the food is very average (not horrible but not good either - bland and super small portions), (2) service is average, and (3) the prices are ridiculous for what you get.  And this ridiculous prices comment is coming from someone who spent over $1,200 at Joel Robuchon for dinner for 2 the night before (there is a reason Joel can command that price - because you get what you pay for).

When the waiter tells you their signature dish - the hamachi with jalapenos and crispy potatoes isn't good - there is something wrong with this place.  The black cod was literally 2 bites and the texture was off.

Do not eat here you won't enjoy your food as its nothing special and you definitely won't be full.  After I got back to LA I had Sushi Gen (4.5 stars) and Hama Sushi (4 stars) - both were excellent and I paid less than half of what I paid at at barMASA and got twice the amount of food at significantly better quality.  Don't waste your time nor your money here.  This place was so bad it compelled me to write my first review...that says something.",W-2m0R_ZdMoqQ66XUT-kLg,1,0,1,og6eDKHOofVyxIu071gOMw

Stay away and goto Yellow Tail @ Bellagio or Blue Ribbon @ Cosmopolitan. Sorry, Manager, you have your work cut out for you. Best. 

PS Try Katsuya in SLS hotel or Yakko San in Miami. * Best place in Vegas for Japanese is Yonaka just off the strip. 5 stars.",MoDBPHjeHwFIJfYkjNuTrA,1,0,1,543XGz1MgyflzY9eTXEQPg

Surprised that this place has such bad reviews. I didn't think it was that bad. Ordered the sashimi tasting and the fish was fresh. The fish was so good that several pieces would melt in our mouths and the uni was so creamy. The uni risotto and lobster ceviche were also delicious. For dessert, we ordered the miso creme brûlée which was yummy. However, I would only come here for a special occasion. I do agree that it may be a little overpriced which is the reason I knocked off one star.",4-pOz1BzZ88w2LaPPdl8rg,0,0,4,hyUT_fVpUNfivcPPftypzA

My husband took me here for our Valentines Day date. We were seated right away, the hosts handed out single roses to the man to give to their lady. Our server was really polite. The fish were fresh, like butter it melted in your mouth.  We tried some skewers and had desert. They didn't have fusion rolls, most of their sushi were authentic and not too laborious. 

The service was outstanding, the food was par. I've had better authentic Japanese food. Although, great presentation. I wasn't too crazy about their cocktails and their was desert good.

My husband and I didn't have huge appetites that night, the prices didn't scare us, but our check was almost a whopping $300.00 

It was nice to go out for fine dining but I think we will be back to our regular sushi joint. 

Thank you for the experience.",at41ymjb1OVu34ii08bCEw,4,2,3,CLIlcguvrQTc2WZGnCaGkw
5921738,2016-11-07,4,ni4ppUp4oHq-OSSCgUIGiA,"Insanely expensive. Dinner for 5, without alcohol, was $320, and all we ordered were rolls, sashimi, rice, edamame, and soup, in reasonable quantities.

I didn't realize until after we sat down that fried rice was over $30, and each roll (i'm talking your standard tuna avocado, not one of the crazy rolls) was pushing $20+. 

Given the price point, I had pretty high expectations. Nope. The fish was fresh (but not like ""wow this was flown in this morning"" fresh), but the rice was overly mushy and too cold, so the consistency was far too sticky; it reminded me a little of rolls that a grocery store puts out after it sits there getting far too cold for hours on end.

The apps (soup and sashimi) were nice, the rice was good, but not worth anywhere near what they were charging. When we got home, we had sushi at our spot in Hoboken, $45 total for two, and it was significantly better than this.

The atmosphere was gorgeous and the staff was amazing, but the prices were nowhere near justifiable for what we ate.",p7OZx3RIeJPxSM4hP6wqEA,8,3,2,SflbeeaPmOZs_7QMgFtIAA

Don't be deterred if it's not packed because it's not for everyone. I'm indecisive and my wonderful waitress made it easy on me - just tell her how much I want to spend! Genius! When you go to a restaurant of high caliber, I'd rather the chef chose something for me and that's exactly what they did. You can set a price you want to spend per person, they ask you what you don't like and they bring out dishes until you hit that price. Ours was $150 per person and I was stuffed before the final few courses came out. Loved all the chef selections. The sashimi with the truffle on it was divine. Melts in the mouth. The dishes were clean, fresh, made of quality ingredients and inventive. I enjoyed the ambience, the somm, my waitress and the constant attention from the manager. Nothing to complain about. If you like sushi/sashimi and you want an elevated experience, this is the place. Romantic, catching up with friends or business - it caters all. As a Las Vegas local, this is one of the better restaurants on the strip.",RArQt74He3Ok8asTRUw2FQ,3,3,5,INxvgOH3xrrayZUiRfUQhg

Ordered the sampler roll (48 dollars) and fatty tuna-avocado roll.  It was not bad fish, but there was nothing special about it to have paid what we paid.  The sampler roll had fish that had a pureed texture.  Not appetizing at all.  Not a big roll either.  The tuna and avocado roll was so plain and not filling that my friend and I decided that was the end of this dinner.  No more wasting money here. What a  huge disappointment.  We of course went somewhere else to have a real dinner.  Just because a seemingly nice restaurant is in a nice hotel, does not mean it has five star food.  Next time I will look on yelp.  I would of known better if I had.",fvIlcKJnecE5Yha7X9siFQ,2,0,1,1JzHwzcwpEw-pDsneBL5KA
