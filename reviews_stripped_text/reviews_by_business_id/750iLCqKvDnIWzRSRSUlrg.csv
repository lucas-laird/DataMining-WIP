92198,2016-06-06,0,750iLCqKvDnIWzRSRSUlrg,This place is close to my work.. my boss introduced it to me a while back and have been hooked ever since! First off everybody that works there has great customer service even when they have been slammed. I have never had to wait a long time for take out or delivery. There is no delivery fee which is a huge generosity to their customers and also helps when I am slammed at work and can't leave for lunch. Seems like it's a family owned joint and very personable business. I get their chicken salad sub almost everytime it's quite delicious! I have gotten a few other items as well and have never been dissapointed by anything I have tried! I would say this is one of my favorite spots to eat at in town.. thanks Bobs Deli!!! :),o--xGNATdBK5JrzFwsV3XQ,0,0,4,msQgYOJzyUBu6TzTpHuVcA

335592,2007-05-17,1,750iLCqKvDnIWzRSRSUlrg,"OK. This is HUGE news. I have found the absolute best deli in Las Vegas. Seriously. Bob's East Side Deli offers a great selection for breakfast and lunch. You would never notice the actual building, because it is smack dab in the middle of two office parks, but if you find it, it's like finding the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. Hot subs, cold subs, salads, side dishes, and great homemade desserts are just the beginning of the lunch menu. The bread for all of the subs and sandwiches is baked fresh as well. The actual deli is not a place I would recommend  for a quiet, peaceful lunch. It is buzzing with traffic constantly. Businessmen, students, and nearby residents jam pack this smaller deli around lunch time, so make sure you know what to order before getting to the front of the line. Or, they offer delivery, faxed orders, and call-ins. If you work in the vicinity, or are simply searching for the perfect sub, Bob's is the place for you.

Recommended sub: Marino's Special, which is a meat lover's delight! 

Recommended dessert: The chocolate brownie is perfection wrapped in plastic.",HaPtQKTZmtIDjyKzjaCmqA,6,7,5,QvcPC6Vnzi-MHZuJamlZ7g

1072401,2017-01-04,0,750iLCqKvDnIWzRSRSUlrg,"DO NOT go here!!!! This place is a joke!! My wife and I finally decided to go here after driving by the sign 100 times. We sure regret it!!! I should've known right off the bat when we asked a question about the corned beef hash and our answer was IDK, it's not homemade... We ordered the ""hungry man"" breakfast! Disgusting!!! It says it comes with a huge slab of ham along with eggs, hash browns, toast. The ham was a perfectly cut square THIN slice. It looked and tasted like an oversized slice of ""spam"". The hash brown was a oil soaked , soggy, frozen piece of slip!!!! I ordered a English muffin instead of the toast and that was also a soggy, cold muffin that seemed to be put in the microwave for 20 seconds rather than toasted... my wife got the sausage instead of ham and that was exactly like McDonald's patty and barely heated.. To be honest, McDonald's big breakfast is 10 times better for half the price! The hash brown was exactly like McDonald's too rather than real home made hash browns.At least McDonald's serves theirs crispy unlike this place. So my suggestion is DO NOT go here and if your looking for a breakfast like this, just go to McDonald's!! You can even get a large iced coffee there along with your breakfast and still not pay as much as this so called deli!!! We looked around and noticed all the meats for subs are already cut with cheese on it placed on a pan rather  than sliced fresh when you order. I can only imagine what the subs are like but I'll never know because this place will never receive 1 more penny from us!!!!!!",YfX1vV_IZCn-6IMVGQ7Mpw,0,0,1,VDE6fUJshQ8vmmNw6D_c3g

1565802,2015-01-22,0,750iLCqKvDnIWzRSRSUlrg,"After completing my online order for a company that orders from this place weekly. I was charged a different total than my confirmation. When i called to question this i was given a story of a website glitch and extra charges that was never discussed, nor was i contacted. I was then hung up on. I called again and was called ""Baby"" and transferred to Bob the owner, where i was ridiculed and spoken to as if i was a 5 year old. I explained that the eCommerce of their site should have added ""these extra charges"" or at least i should have been contacted when the total was dramatically different than what was confirmed. Bob proceeded to give me a lesson on his use of commas on his menu and his menu pricing suggesting that it is common sense and adding totals should be easy from their. I explained that my total was in fact correct and the lines of his menu suggest a different price entirely. Bob laughed at me repeatedly through out this call.
I asked why i was being held responsible for a glitch in his system and he continued to argue with me. He then told me he is taking down his site, i request a refund in the difference from HIS mistake and hung up on me. What happened to customer service?
BOB- you are by far an arrogant person that does not have a top customers well being nor dedication in mind- TERRIBLE experience...  and this company will never support your ""Deli"" as well as the entire business park surrounding.

1658182,2016-08-17,0,750iLCqKvDnIWzRSRSUlrg,"I've been to this place twice in the last week, and while the experiences weren't bad, it wasn't what I hyped it up to be.  

My girlfriend raves about this place for awhile now, so we went on Saturday and ordered two sandwiches.  It was my first time, but she had been there previously.  She ordered a chicken sandwich, I had a Marino (Italian sandwich).  My sandwich was decent; not great, but not terrible; though it was missing mayo, but it wasn't a big deal, I just like it and they said it automatically comes with it.  I'd definitely go again.

For that order, we took it to go, but yesterday we went during lunch rush to dine in and the restaurant was packed.  This is to be expected, it's lunchtime and the place isn't that big, so I wasn't too upset with the wait time.  I ordered a chicken finger sub, but they misheard me and gave me a chicken finger meal with fries.  It wasn't the end of the world, as I was hungry and it was good.  

I want to go back again, because the menu is pretty big and I haven't found that dish that floors me yet.  Service is good, and it's a quaint little NY-themed place.  So far, it just hasn't matched my expectations.",PgcpupLBmQ3idKPIrqhmkg,0,0,3,yuisxcYysGj6at_1lK9QuA
1673264,2015-05-29,3,750iLCqKvDnIWzRSRSUlrg,"Oddly set in the corner of a business park, Bob's is the kind of place you can drive by a million times without really noticing. It doesn't help that there's no OPEN sign, so after their lunch rush it looks pretty deserted from the outside.

But if you stop in during business hours (they close at 4PM on weekdays, 1PM on Saturdays), you'll find a positive alternative to the $5 foot long. Bob's makes a better sandwich at a similar size, thick with fresh-cut Boar's Head meats and fresh veggies. The Marino's Special (Ham, Salami, Capicola, Pepperoni, Cheese, Lettuce, Tomato, Onions, Oil & Vinegar) is my pick, and the portion is enough for two meals, and only $7.

Come by after about 2PM, and you'll see a few students around from nearby Del Sol high school- found the NO STUDENTS IN BATHROOMS signage to be a little off putting, but the kids present were quiet and respectful. I also noticed that all the students were getting the chicken strips meal, maybe something else to check out if you don't dig sandwiches.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,6,6,4,wvHIKT1RQCMFxE1NOGcoLw

It's sort of hard to find, tucked away in some pseudo-industrial officeplex on E Patrick (just west of Del Sol, on the north side of the street). You can definitely tell it's a locally owned and operated kinda place. It would get five stars, but my corned beef sandwich was, though completely satisfactory, not stellar. My friend's meatball sub, however, WAS stellar. So get that. They make their meatballs fresh by hand. In fact, the owner is the one who made our sandwiches. Nice guy, in an east coat deli proprietor sorta way. Really, they deserve five stars just for the ""no students in the bathroom"" signs on the bathroom doors. Pretty damn funny if you ask me. Definitely worth checking out for a quick lunch, especially on your way to or from McCarran. As far as delis in Las Vegas go, you're really not gonna do any better.

1983909,2011-01-17,0,750iLCqKvDnIWzRSRSUlrg,"Chris and I had errands to run and little time for food. We decided that we'd do sandwiches. Chris had eaten Bob's before, I had not. Chris is picky, so anything he'll eat more than once is always a good sign. 

We stopped off for lunch at this little side shop that I would never have noticed otherwise. It's tucked next to a business area on a non-arterial road. 

The place is small, though big enough for the crowd. The customers range from bikers, businessmen, college students, etc. It was a wide array of patrons when we went in. The place is run by the family, with reminiscent decor. The tables and chairs seemed as tough they were taken out of an old cafeteria, though they were not uncomfortable. 

For the price we paid, the meal was worth it. Chris ordered the Toll's Creation, a generous helping of roast beef, turkey and ham with toppings specific to Chris' taste. Aside from the fact he ordered EXTRA mayo and still received a meager rationing, the sandwich was great. 

I ordered the Chicken Philly, sans peppers. It was large, juicy and delicious. The portions/servings were adequate to the price (both our orders being between $6.50 - $7.00).

They slice their own deli, and EVERYTHING is homemade. The prices are so cheap, and you get a good amount of food for the cost. It is a bargain. I sandwiches are huge and range about 6 to 7 bucks. I personally love their reuben and corned beef hash sandwich on rye. Its full of flavor, and loaded with meat. As far as breakfast dishes, I recommend their breakfast steak sandwich, and their 2.99 corned beer breakfast. You also have to get a side of hash browns with anything! The hash browns are lightly brown, extra crispy, and soft in the center. Just the way a hash brown should be. I mean...I even close my eyes sometimes when I take bites of their hash browns.

Located in a business park off of Patrick Lane, Bob's is an unassuming joint. There is a sign leading the way for you though, so do not be afraid of the business-like exterior. Inside is a no-frills sandwich shop bringing you cold and hot sandwiches alike. Tables and chairs scream community kitchen, but do no be afraid, go ahead and order a sandwich. 

I went with the simple cold, turkey, cheese, and salami with everything. Lettuce, tomatoes, and red onions. Also comes with mayo, which by the way, you should probably ask for light mayo if you are watching your figure, OR if you just don't want to have an over-slathering of mayo on your sandwich. Next time I'm there I'll opt for the lighter option. Other than the mayo the sandwich was great. Just enough meat and cheese and fillers in my opinion. There wasn't one prominent part of the sandwich. The bread was also incredibly soft making for a great texture wrapped around the meat, cheese, and veggies.

My husband went for the French Dip, while on the smallish side, he said was good. We also shared a bag of chips.

Bob's is simplistic. Sandwiches. Chips. Salami. Cheese. Bam. Bam. Bam. Don't expect any crazy aioli sauces or fancy-pants toppings for your sandwiches here.

I have friends originally from NY who say this is as close as you can get to NY authentic in Las Vegas, which is something to note. I personally don't care if it's authentic or inauthentic because I'm not a New Yorker and just want food regardless of label.

The chicken fried steak sandwich is on a sub roll. It tastes good but I think it would be better on a hamburger bun so the steak is whole rather than cut in pieces. It makes it difficult to eat plus it doesn't come with fries. The price is a little high since it is only the sandwich. 

Their omelet is overpriced and small. The taste was also plain. I can make one a lot better at home. I do not recommend it.

And you can never go wrong with some over easy eggs....now if only it came with rice =).",Tdv7HZa4Hyjm-X0MtNmeag,3,1,4,KkepT6zRz5YWGmogElxRkA

I have to say that their breakfast sandwiches, steak & egg on a kaiser roll are the BOMB! Best damn sandwich ever! LOL Pretty much everything that I've tried is good, but those are exceptional. The delivery folks are awesome as well and fast delivery to where we are... all in all very good!",vtVR8rKPb1atOcb6tgw7iA,0,0,5,toUfgQhkNS2hhnYSFgvw9w
5532925,2017-05-26,0,750iLCqKvDnIWzRSRSUlrg,Visited Lost Wages for a Bachelor party. Bob tailored the sandwiches to our liking. Supplied vegetable and fruit trays along with desserts for 30 people. Delivered on time and enjoyed immensely by everybody. I think the price quality relationship is a win/win for any event. I strongly recommend BESD for future get togethers!,dT6Z4tAwfGuHqXix7hmH9Q,0,0,5,YkC1XFPJ0l_HaNDIcLTtSA

Ordered my eggs over medium, and alas, they came out perfectly over medium. Tough to stomach going to McDonalds when Bob's is down the street. Have not visited here for lunch yet but the affordable simplicity of a well cooked breakfast has sold me",hWtv3NXxT6I0Hwb54_4-Vg,1,1,5,UbXew2JN_dNvj5PfEVaJDQ

Service here was so amazingly friendly! The sandwiches were delicious and there was a huge selection (something for all tastes!)  Were I in the area I would be here frequently.  It's a fabulous lunch spot!,gZunx7iVjRJV3QlXzEqWJg,0,0,4,2pK-xl-pFEphxAOVrYTnhA

The portions are for the hungry man, the working man and my favorite is the Marino's Special cold sandwich.  The trick is Bob's is a luncheon and not open during the weekends.",DsVnd4PH2nkbxo8UeGW3Mw,1,0,5,ji6z_v7AlUnhhwrDaq4t_g
