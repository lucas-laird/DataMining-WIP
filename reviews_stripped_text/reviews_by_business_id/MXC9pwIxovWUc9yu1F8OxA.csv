124149,2013-06-21,2,MXC9pwIxovWUc9yu1F8OxA,"I tend to write novel-reviews that could probably be turned into plays. But I can't say enough good things about this place. 

This place deserves more than just a 5-pack of stars. They really deserve buckets and troughs of the things. Big, shiny, red, buckets of obese stars. Get you, your mouth, and your tummy over here immediately. You really cannot wait any longer. If you find yourself in Vegas doing the strip-thing, you need to make the ~10 minute drive to Sushi Twister.  

Three initial must-dos: AYCE, sit at the bar, and come hungry. 

One initial tip: Order carefully, they will charge you for any leftovers you cannot finish. (Great policy in my opinion). 

The man-piece and I came here for lunch before our long road-trip back home to San Francisco. It was probably the best decision of our lives. For around $22, we sat at the bar and enjoyed gorgeously delicious waves of fresh, expertly prepared sushi, and other wonderfully unique dishes. 

We mainly stuck to the nigiri menu. I'm not saying this is what you should do, but these little guys aren't your typical nigiri (and I live in San Francisco, a veritable sushi-snob space station). They really surpassed anything I have experienced. Expect fresh fish (weird, being in the middle of the desert), and really amazing flavors. They are garnished with the perfect amount of wasabi, sometimes green onions, and various soy-ish sauces that give your wee nigiri bites extra-excellent flavor. We probably tried 80% of the nigiri menu, but some must-haves include: 

- Garlic tuna (FAVORITE)
- Seared ahi (OTHER FAVORITE) 
- Halibut (OTHER FAVORITE)
- Sake (FAVORITE)
- Saba (OTHER FAVORITE)
- Red snapper (OTHER FAVORITE)

Before I continue to gush about the food, I must say that the service was spectacular. As soon as we walked in, we were taken aback by the 7-9 people enthusiastically declaring ""IRASSHAIMASE!!!"" I twitched a little at the loud enthusiasm, but we knew we were in for a treat. The servers always check up on you, the chefs are wonderfully receptive, seem to love their work, and also seem to have fortress-like memories considering the slew of orders being verbally submitted by the servers. Be comforted. 

Back to the food! 

The roll menu is impressive and involves unique combinations that I'm not used to. They have a great array of cooked rolls, of which we liked the Dead Dragon, Fire Cracker, . Use caution here -- I can see it being easy to fill up on these delicious rolls and be too full to enjoy other areas of the glorious menu. 

I'm not usually one for appetizers mainly because they fill me up before I get to the good stuff, but these appetizers are cautiously portioned so you can enjoy a variety of dishes and flavors but still have room in your precious tummy-space for more. Favorites: 

- Monkey Balls: spicy tuna and mushroom encased in a satisfying tempura shell. Nothing like their Chimp Nad cousins. (I suck.)
- Hot Shrimp: shrimp, spicy tuna, and cream cheese magicked with tempura to make a seriously delicious snack. You must try.

Needless to say, the man-piece and I were speechless after our meal here. It's both a gut-wrenching tragedy and a wallet-saving blessing that it's so far away from where we live. That said, I can't really complain much hailing from the sushi-space-station that is San Francisco. Sushi Twister should think about storming its way up to the Bay. You'd be welcomed with open arms and mouths. Thank you for a truly excellent and memorable meal!",FgGiQc9zpM_va5JZMvJtMQ,5,1,5,183qUPNxdsZLAudT2Jxd-w

A big bonus to this restaurant is that you can order half rolls! I love LOVE that because sometimes I could eat more, but might not be able to finish a full roll. It also gives me a chance to try a new roll if I'm on the fence about it.

Before me and my fiancé even started eating, the waitress was very rude by sternly insisting that if I was ordering ""all you can eat"" and my fiancé wasn't, that there was ""NO SHARING."" Now, granted, given the area of the restaurant,  I'm sure they have had people take advantage,  however, this didn't start us off well at all. I suggest you police this type of thing when you actually see people taking true advantage of it. 

We ordered drinks, then I started off with some salmon nigiri. It came out with brown edges on every single piece.

That was all she wrote for us. I called the waitress over, told her our issues, and said we will pay for our drinks but we are leaving. They had one last chance to redeem themselves a bit, and cover our drinks. I was being nice to even offer. They should have apologized and covered the drinks for us, but no, we paid for them.

Pretty standard in my opinion, but nothing bad.  We really liked the Mexican roll and I thought the albacore and garlic tuna were really yummy.  None of the others really stood out.

629467,2010-04-22,1,MXC9pwIxovWUc9yu1F8OxA,"This place is probably my favorite sushi joint on the East side of town.  They have a great selection of rolls and have good quality fish.  For some reason, I find it hard to find spicy crab rolls, and this place has great ones.  The boulder crunchy, which is an avocado and tempura shrimp roll, is also great.  Their tempura is light and tasty, although, they are a bit skimpy on the order size (they give you two per order, another place I go to gives you three).

My only quibble with this place is the service.  While they are nice, as another reviewer said, after a few plates of sushi, one gets the feeling that the wait staff as well as the sushi chef is ignoring you while thinking, ""Stop eating!"".  Some servers are better than others about that, but this is the one place I go where I feel like this is almost always an issue, whereas it is not with other sushi places I've been to.  I think that for the price they charge for an ACYE dinner, and accounting for the frequency of which I dine there (and always tip well), this is a bit uncalled for.",XEiocbijRm1YLbZJwvAlQw,1,1,4,yhbcEb8CqQy8h8KCFe6_nQ

Generally we love to do AYCE and have tried a lot of them throughout the LV valley. So this time we decided to give Sushi Twister a try for AYCE since it was late and we didn't feel like driving too far.  The sushi was ok but none of which were fantastic; this time we also tried the Angry Ninja (new item) , ecstasy & Matsuri.  The place was very busy and at first the waitress seemed very nice but as the evening wore on, she forgot an order and wasn't as nice.. maybe it was because we had 3 toddlers with us. Well we were a party of 4 adults and 3 children all under 3yrs of age.  At the end of dinner, my husband gave his mochi ice cream to 2 of the toddlers and the waitress came over and yelled NO SHARING! you cannot share with the little kids!  My goodness that was just 1 little mochi ice cream ball and she made a big deal about it and embarrassed us at the restaurant.  Food wise we would rate them a 3 star because the sushi was ok but not outstanding.  The best place we love for AYCE or not is SIN SITY SUSHIi, I love Sushi is also very good but they do not offer AYCE.  We took off 1 star from our overall rating because we will not give this place our time or money anymore because of the incident with the mochi ice cream and also because they included the 3 kids in our party total and automatically added 18% gratuity.  I don't think this place is kid friendly.  From now on, I would rather spend my money on gas and drive 20 minutes for fresh and great tasting sushi as well as outstanding service other than Sushi Twister.",hFWi7hG6fU8Q90eezXCeeA,1,1,2,ShILLkCk8UZ3H5qJVC5bKA

A few times my friends brought me to Sushi Factory East (which is now closed, perfect timing since I just got a full stamp card...) a few times. One day I wanted sushi of my own for lunch and Twister was right down the road. I went in, ordered a Japanese Lasagna to go, and walked home.

I have NEVER been blown away by food like this. The roll was simply the most delicious thing I have ever consumed and is now my usual favorite here. (I always get at LEAST half of a roll!)

The quality here is unparalleled. The service is quick and amazing. The ONLY thing I don't like about this place is how everyone there hawks you down when someone at your table doesn't have AYCE. Not everyone is a thief, and looking at customers constantly so they don't share is completely unnecessary. Have some faith in people. Especially people who are in there bi-weekly spending $40 on sushi.

If you have a group of 6+ you might have to wait since the establishment is quite small inside and they don't do reservations. Keep that in mind!

I've been going to this place for a long, long, time. Years in fact. But like like all things, change is constant and Sushi Twister is not immune, 

While the food is always good, it's the service that has slowly become an issue. The primary reason for this, as I see it, is that they've simply outgrown their space. The place is too small. They need to expand (which is difficult given that they are on a shared pad with Starbucks with nowhere else to grow) or just plain move. I suppose moving would be a bad idea considering that they have a lock in this area as the only sushi place until you travel all the way down to Topaz and Tropicana or so.  

Regardless, the place is simply too small. When it's busy, which is almost always nowadays, people are literally sitting on top of each other. In fact, I would almost call it communal seating. On my last visit I had a couple to my right that looked to be on their first date (I think they really hit it off!!) and a couple to my left that were an established pair. She was a straight shooter. He liked to tap his feet and hop up and down a little in his chair when the next plate of sushi showed up (he looked to be about 50 years old). He'd even hum a little ditty while he ate. Perhaps he did this for our mutual pleasure? I would have to assume so given that our shoulders were less than a foot apart.

The staff seems to be overcrowded, overworked and overwhelmed. They aren't nearly as chipper as they used to be. This might have to do with the lack of space and over capacity. Or perhaps it's something else. It might be that they've become so busy that a customers business is no longer appreciated, but expected? This is a mindset that seems to occur from time to time when an establishment become wildly popular. 

Purely speculation of course and I certainly hope I'm wrong. Overall the place is awesome and the food is fantastic. If they can work out these couple of kinks they'll be back to old form in a jiffy.",hyBENyHJ43GH8OsTRiT6kw,0,0,4,QFptrjT0rLijW0KZiv3gxg

1245000,2015-09-10,0,MXC9pwIxovWUc9yu1F8OxA,"As an AYCE Sushi ""connoisseur"" I thought I'd share my thoughts. I've been to close to a dozen AYCE Sushi joints in Vegas, over a hundred nationwide. This spot is at a convenient location off of Boulder Highway. Not the greatest part of town, but not particularly bad. 

The price is basically inline with other sushi joints, a dollar or two more than others. However, $26.95 (which is precisely what I paid here) gives me a large sake and superior sushi at Jayde Fuzion inside the M Hotel. 

THE GOOD:
-The Screaming for Vengeance roll is a top 3 roll in Vegas. Excellent. (and I'm more of a nigiri/sashimi guy)
-Server (owner, I believe) very attentive
-Sushi Chefs were also very attentive, skilled
-Booze was cheap. I paid $5 for a large Sapporo - $10 elsewhere. 
======================================================
THE SO-SO:
-Music was constantly skipping throughout our meal. Very annoying. Also, half the songs were Cher remixes. I'm sorry, but no one wants to listen to Cher remixes.. I understand that technical issues can at times be out of your hands, but you should turn down the volume if the music is constantly skipping

-Was very warm sitting at the bar. I was sweating. 

-Fairly bland fish - we ordered about ten flavors of Nigiri, most were less flavorful than competitors in town. Taste-wise, it was on par with my at home nigiri that I make from store bought fish. It just didn't taste very flavorful
======================================================
THE BAD: 
-HOT PLATES- My NUMBER ONE pet peeve with sushi restaurants is serving sushi on hot plates. No no no. It ruins the flavor, the experience, and the build of the nigiri. Every dish I was served here was on hot plates. No one wants warm raw fish. 

-Nagged three times regarding the policy of finishing food. My girlfriend and I weigh 250lbs combined(she's at about 90lbs). We're thin. We know that this is an established rule at every AYCE joint, and we follow it 100% of the time. Never leave a morsel of food on our plate. We ordered a total of two rolls and ten (2pc) orders of Nigiri. If we had ordered those plates individually, it would have came out to less than we paid for the AYCE. And ON TOP OF THAT, we ate everything. She reminded us once when we sat, once mid-meal, and when I asked for the check with two pieces we were sitting on, she mentioned that we needed to finish them (we were already planning on it). It's printed on every menu and all over their signs at Sushi Twister. I thought it was excessive before she even said anything to us, let alone before she told us three times. No other Sushi joint needs to mention it. 

We were certainly the smallest AYCE order on the day. More profitable than any other customers that walked through the door. But really, she shouldn't be mentioning it to anyone. It's on the menu. We get it.",B301ufnpl7TUsY0Im88qrg,1,0,2,F6uEW-yg4IMdFazWr2X-3Q

1380568,2010-12-24,0,MXC9pwIxovWUc9yu1F8OxA,"A few months ago, a friend who loves sushi had told me about this place. I believe the first time i tried this was around May 2010. Located on the east side of town at the intersection of Tropicana and Boulder Highway, it was clearly on the opposite side of town where i lived. Prices were average at $26.95/person for dinner, and $21.95/person for lunch. 

First impression? Upon entry, widely greeted by all the staff in japanese and was quickly shown to our table. According to my friend, the owner is one that stands closest to the entrance to the restaurant at the corner of the sushi bar. He used to be a chef at another restaurant, but later left and opened this place. This is when I first started to rate places i go to, so i didnt have a variety of tests to check the place out, but as of recently i had checked, they passed it all. Fish not presliced and covered with serand wrap in the refrigeration cabinet at the sushi bar. One thing people order initially is the tamago nigiri. It is to test the skill of the sushi chef as well as an initial test for the rice. Both very good. Egg was sweet and cut thick. Rice was a small amount and had a particular nice taste that complimented well. (pride of the sushi chef). 

We had orders the 3 primary fish (tuna, salmon, yellowtail) for nigiri, enough to taste/see the quality before we order more. Small amount of rice, nice good size slice of fish. Rice flavor complimented the freshness and sweetness of each fish very nicely. And then, it was game over. 30+ orders of each salmon, tuna, and yellowtail. Best quality fish ever have tasted at a all-you-can-eat restaurant in las vegas. 

On the side note, you are able to ask the chef what is the freshest fish they have that day is, and try that. Usually pretty good as well even if its not salmon, tuna, or yellowtail.

The waitresses and chefs are very open to custom orders of any kind (i mean almost any kind... oh man, my friend made a weird one - natto and squid topped with yum yum sauce... i shiver at the idea of natto... *shivers*) 

Another note, try to remember to look at the special on the wall opposite of the sushi bar. Sometimes they have pretty good specials that you can order, that is included in the all-you-can-eat plan. Sometimes they have blue fin tuna or fatty tuna ! O_O YUMMY !

Have tried a few of the rolls and they are pretty good too. None with sauces too overpowering but enough to produce a flavor from the sauce without covering the flavor of the ingredients

Also... desserts... all-you-can-eat ice cream and mochi... a plus for a lot of people =P esp since i love green tea ice cream =] 
 
Quality of this place is really good, though its far for some people, but in my opinion, definately worth it.

I've been hearing a lot of people say to me that Sushi Twister makes some of the best sushi in town. Well,not quite. But, Sushi Twister is making some good sushi over on the east side of Vegas. 

First, for those living on the east side near boulder highway and Trop, and around that area, this might be your only option for AYCE sushi. And, it's not really such a bad option.

After walking in and sitting down at the bar, I was later told by the sushi chef that  Sushi Twister is owned by the same people that own Ramen Sora in Chinatown. I was expecting a lot, and I think that they delivered nicely.

Ordered too much to analyse bit by bit, but will try to give an overall impression. I thought the fish and seafood quality was good, but not great. I also thought that the rice was a tad bit on the slightly sour side. I also thought that their signature sauce that they put on many of the apps and nigiri, sort of a yuzu-type soy sauce, was too sour as well. As for the apps, I really liked the chicken karage, it was crispy, well seasoned, and cooked very nicely.

So, I like this spot, but it's a drive from me so i'll stick to my favoritos. But, for those that live in the area, this is a super solid option for those who don't wanna travel to Spring Mtn. Rd., but would still like some quality sushi.",gtwM4ijo65AN4DvXdgCu_w,17,11,4,9pIJtW3LedGkB0t5DmwH_w

I love this place because they have nigiri down to an art man. Their cuts of fish are just outstanding and the taste is like.. OMG WOW SUSHI YESSSS.

I have a few friends that I go to when I want to know anything Sushi so when they said that this is the place, I took their word without question and I was not at all disappointed.

They have a wide variety of fish for nigiri and from my understanding (according to my sushi expert friends) Twister has probably got some of the freshest fish you can find on your nigiri in Vegas and not only that but apparently they know how to prepare the fish authentically.

On top of that their selection of specialty rolls is pretty massive and I definitely applaud them for their creativity. Going back to my sushi expert friends, they really only like nigiri but apparently the rolls here utilize the same great fish that's on the nigiri that they don't mind having a few specialty rolls as well.

Now, I am by no means an expert on sushi but when the food is good.. the food is good and the food here is DAMN good.

My only real problem with this place is unlike Sushi-Mon and the newly opened Goyemon, Twister does not offer all you can eat dessert which is a real bummer since I would love to have like 4-5 pieces of mochi ice cream like I normally do at Sushi-Mon as opposed to the one piece that they cut in half to make two at Twister.

Fortunately for them, I won't remove a star because like I have been saying.. the food is f^&#ing good. :)

For out of towners. This is not within reasonable driving distance of the strip so unless you're staying for a while and you're with other locals.. I wouldn't suggest it. It would be worth the drive if you have the time though.",-u_PHSe7PYi4RnarqtVLGw,2,0,5,ElQ4-AWsVD-i5PHNMlx0zA

It's great that this isn't a buffet and there's no time limit to ordering, but the bad side is that you can't just get food when you want it. This encourages people to order *a lot* at once and invariably the you end up with more food than your stomach can handle.

The rolls themselves are quite tasty, each one a mix of the basic fish (tuna, salmon, yellowtail) with other maki standards such as crab, avocado, tempura, sweet and/or spicy sauces, etc. You'll definitely find a few that you'll like given that there seem to be about 20 rolls on the menu. 

On top of rolls and sushi, the AYCE allows you to order anything else they serve as well, so you could really gorge yourself on dumplings and salad if that was your fancy. I believe the only thing with a limit are the mochi ice creams of which you're only allowed one.  No big deal since by the time dessert rolled around, I was so stuffed that I involuntarily gave our nice waitress the stinkeye when she asked me if I wanted mochi as well.

Sushi Twister is fun with some interesting decor choices (why are there two carpet dryers on a display area near the ceiling???). The wait staff is super nice and friendly if a bit overworked when I went for a saturday lunch; there was only one girl working the whole restaurant.  I really do like this place and have come back quite a few times when visiting Vegas.

Just remember that as with any type of AYCE, be ready for eater's remorse.",m1X1l_d6mEoZJeENiTVsmA,5,4,4,UVk47JaCg5Dia35sr7qXsA

Waiter was very friendly and attentive. My favorite thing about this place is you can order half rolls, I rarely order rolls at other places because I knew I couldn't finish it myself. 
Their rice was very easy to eat, soft, warm, with a hint of vinegar.  
Only con is they didn't have as many appetizer choices. We had like one or two piece left from 2 of our last rolls and when we asked for the check the waiter actually asked if we would be eating those pieces, I'm assuming it was because you get charged extra for not eating all your food, but we weren't going to order anymore and I don't even know how much he would have charged us for leaving 1 piece behind. We finished it of course but it made us feel like we over ate and as we were leaving we couldn't imagine eating sushi ever again... it wasn't a good feeling.",NPLCLcsJbxpwjphfOoZTpQ,0,1,4,cwTw0YHpWtIEvnz4R4kDLA

I typically dont like to review the atmosphere, but for a sushi place, its extremely upbeat. The music is like something you'd listen to on the radio. There's also a projector playing some kind of show like E! I like it. It's different. Kind of like watching a movie while eating sushi.

Anyways, ordered three items. Twister Scallop Mix, Shrimp Tempura, and the Magic Mountain(?) I honestly forgot the name. LOL.

I loved them all. The cucumber is extremely fresh, like it was picked right outside (I actually hope not literally). My girlfriend ordered the Sushi Dinner Plate(?) (Already forgetting names and we're sitting right on the tables...) Nigiri. So. Fresh. Enough said.

This'll probably be somewhere i'll be going frequently. It's about a 5 minute drive from me.

I went there for lunch April 2009 and had the Sushi lunch special for $8.50. This consisted of tuna, hamachi, salmon, tuna ponzu, albacore ponzu, 8 pc calif roll. ( Or spicy tuna roll) and miso soup.

The miso soup was good, using white miso and used dashi, with tofu and wakame. The only down side was it was a little luke warm.

The sushi was very good. Fish was fresh and appropriately fatty, and cut appropriately, to the right size. The rice was properly prepared, not too mushy, not too al dente, with the vinegar seasoning. It stuck enough until you put it it
your mouth when it fell apart... near perect. They, unlike the many fake sushi places, do put wasabi on the rice, as it should.

I also ordered the amaebi. And they took the heads and made tempura out of them.  Just like at home in Japan.

The service was average.

All in all, this place is so far tops on my list.

For me, one annoyance was the constant trans music playing.",-GKr2BY_1smem1y3D1l2Eg,0,1,4,ClZSoDVRzdGL93cpYIo7MA

Came in for AYCE at a friend's recommendation. The fish is super fresh, and I recommend their nigiri. The older Japanese chef served it traditionally with wasabi and a light bit of soy sauce rather than just as fish and rice elsewhere. The freshness of the fish makes the nigiri their strongest point, and I'd stick to that on future visits.

About halfway through out visit, we were passed off to another younger chef who seemed to have difficulty keeping up with orders. We switched to rolls and they were packed with a disproportionate amount of rice. I am not the biggest fan of their rolls, and I finally put my finger on why: I did not care for their sauces. Some have a metallic taste to them, while others like the Japanese salsa are served so cold they are almost icy. Rolls without sauces, such as the Salmon Loves Lemon, were preferred.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,18,10,3,PNSiZy89EbC11_TociHAmQ

There are times when the services is spotty (an older female server will leave you hanging for quite some time), but there are times when the service is pretty flawless. This weekend we had a young gentleman as our server as he was on top of his game. 

Their selection of nigiri is great and choices of baked and regular rolls vast. My favorites are Friday the 13th, Cowgirl, Oh My God, Ecstasy, and Rum Jungle.

I stumbled upon Sushi Twister while meeting a friends' friend there for lunch.  From the location (trop and boulder) I thought that it would be ahem, ghetto.  Upon walking in you are immediately greeted and the staff is all smiles.  You get seated right on the spot, whether its the sushi bar or a table (we always opt for the table).  

The menu has some of the most intriguing and delicious rolls I've ever seen, as well as the favorites of any sushi restaurant.  Things like...  Rum Jungle roll?  Sure!  The Mexican roll?  Sure!   Also they are NEVER stuffed with too much rice...you get the amount of fish you pay for!

For price-wise, they have all you can eat for $27, which I think is a little pricey, but the rolls definitely make up for it.  So why do I only give it 4 stars?  Whenever you get all you can eat, there's usually a rule saying you have to eat everything you order.  The staff seem to be everywhere, looking at every roll that enters your mouth to make sure you do not share it with someone else (like me, who never orders all you can eat sushi since I can only handle 1.5 rolls).

1762734,2010-08-07,0,MXC9pwIxovWUc9yu1F8OxA,"I came here last night for the first time and had all-you-can-eat.  First, it was pretty packed -- the wait was about 20-30 minutes around 9:00 PM for a group of 6 -- but the wait was worth it.

I ordered the rainbow, volcano, and salmon loves lemon rolls and the screaming orgasm appetizer.  The screaming orgasm came out first, it was presented differently than I've seen at most sushi bars, but the ""ecstasy"" sauce was the best part of it.  There is a one-order limit on these, so I'd suggest if you're going with a big group and you want more than one to have everyone in the group order one, whether they want it or not to get the most out of it. 

The rainbow and salmon loves lemon rolls came out together.  No complaints there.  The rainbow is a pretty generic roll, so it's hard to mess up, but the fish all tasted great and fresh.  The salmon loves lemon roll reminds me of a roll at Sushi Factory East (can't remember what it's called, maybe the LA Boxing roll?).  Anyway, I liked the thin slice of lemon on top, it added an interesting flavor to the salmon and california roll underneath. 

The volcano roll came out last and it was pretty much perfect -- not too much yum yum sauce, but enough to get the flavor.  I also love the baked scallops on top.

I also tried pieces of the Mexican and Rum Jungle rolls.  The Mexican roll was tasty and just the right amount of spicy; the Rum Jungle roll, on the other hand, was good, except for the Japanese ""salsa"" on top.  I'd probably get it without the salsa next time. 

For dessert, I had the mango mochi, which was nothing special, but good.  There is a one-order limit on the mochi and only two flavors (mango and strawberry), but the green tea and red bean ice cream is unlimited.

The AYCE dinner was $26.95 and there was an automatic gratuity of 18% for our group of 6.  They also have a punch card, where if you eat there 10 times you get 1 free. 

The service was better than most sushi places I've been to, so that was a plus.  They were pretty attentive and usually came by pretty frequently so that we could order more rolls on a steady basis.

However, since there are so many All You Can Eat sushi spots, I think to each their own when it comes to a favorite but since you're asking this Yelp Elite, hands down, Sushi Twister is the go-to place. 

The AYCE menu includes appetizers, nigiri, hand/cut rolls, specialty rolls and dessert. Of course there are rules, and one of them is the reason why they didn't get all 5 stars. No sharing with others in your party who isn't doing AYCE, you must eat everything you order and there are certain things that are limited per person. That part. That is exactly why they lost a star. 

Mom and I went for dinner on a Sunday and it wasn't that busy but I'm sure if you go on a Friday or Saturday, the place would be packed. We skipped ordering from the appetizer menu and dove into getting some nigiri and cut rolls. For the first round we got garlic tuna, uni, spicy crab roll, tamago, salmon and baked lasagna. 

Garlic tuna- bomb. 
Uni- out of this world, eyes rolling back good. 
Baked Lasagna-insane. 

Now this is where my heart breaks. For the second round, we ordered the rum jungle (Soft shell crab, cucumber inside, and spicy tuna & Albacore on top, splashed w/ Japanese Salsa), hamachi nigiri, tuna nigiri, and seared tuna nigiri and TRIED to get the uni again. Buuuuut,  uni is one of those items that you can only order 1 order per person. Whomp, whomp. 

Sulking about not being to get more uni, I was forced to eat my feelings by ordering more sushi and move on. On a better note, I like that certain rolls you could do a half portion instead of a regular portion, so it allows you to try something and if you don't like it, you're not struggling to eat it because you don't want to waste and get charged regular ala carte price. 

The service was as good as the sushi. Several servers who passed our table would ask if everything was okay and our main server always came at the right time to take our order for the next round, so we always had food on the table. 

Don't let the location sketch you out cause if you ask any Vegas local, this place isn't in the best neighborhood and it's kind of out of the way from the strip. The price for the quality and quantity can't be beat, so it's worth it if you can make it out here.",d5S1y6nL9ZGB5_uJZTjI7g,0,1,4,v3X3_SGcTb4g1csy3JYP9w

We didn't feel like we needed to overeat to get to try more variety and we left feeling well fed but not overstuffed.

My family have been loyal customers for many years and have never had a bad experience here.

The owner and chefs know us when we walk in.  In fact, I suspect they know us too well and when they see our car pull up, someone hits a switch that says ""RED ALERT!"" because as soon as we sit down, out food is already coming out since we order the same nigiri every time.

Their red snapper is my fav.  My husband loves their seared albacore.  They make us special order rolls.

They also have a frequent AYCE diner card so you get a free meal when you fill up the card.  Sign up for their birthday club and they mail you a discount postcard during your birthday month.",3OBUskILk_la6BP8BpmZ2g,2,2,5,0ml1-KHKGD9cV4nle8yqnw

We ordered about 7 different things right away, and ordered more rolls after that. The server kept telling us we could order half rolls, as if he didnt think we could finish the full rolls. Ha! We sure showed him! But it is nice they have the half roll option. 

The salmon loves lemon roll is deliciously refreshing, if you like lemon and salmon you must get this. The salmon nigiri and garlic tuna were my favorite of the evening, and I love that garlic sauce they use on top of the tuna. For dessert I had mango mochi and red bean ice cream. The red bean was super sweet and tasty. Just a note only one piece of mochi per person for AYCE, which I think is a little stingy. After all you are paying around $30 for dinner with tax.

2160345,2014-02-19,0,MXC9pwIxovWUc9yu1F8OxA,"Visiting from out of town, looking for a sushi deal.  Not a large place, very little waiting room. Slight rotten egg smell coming from outside nearby wasn't pleasant.  Kitchen looks a bit chaotic/seedy but they did a good job of making the dining room pleasant (mainly paint the ceiling black and use minimal quality lighting.) 

We had to wait twice as long as stated on a weekday evening about 7.  Got the AYCE (seems pretty standard around Vegas to have the $26.95 AYCE in many sushi places.)  Quality of fish was decent, about what I get for a middle of the road type place in Seattle.  I like that they didn't give you tons of rice in each piece.  Sat at the bar.  After I hit about $35 equivalent value, the chef was definitely not as attentive and you had to be more assertive about ordering more.  Could be he just got busy too.  Was impressed AYCE includes one order of sweet shrimp and Uni (if you want it.)  

Items off the regular menu; scallop dynamite: NASTY - a pool of oil.  Green salad - way too much dressing, couldn't eat it, and it's the spring greens not the crisp iceberg lettuce I'm used to getting in most traditional Japanese places. Tempura Bowl, good, a little on the overdone side and the pour the sauce on instead of giving you a dipping bowl.  Agedashi tofu, good.

All of the servers have been quite friendly and cheerful enough, so we've always felt welcomed when dining here. If you order the amaebi they may offer you the deep fried heads as well- I for one fully suggest consuming those crunchy little craniums, they're delicious! Their screaming orgasm wiz a twist is, naturally, tastegasmic, though if I'm going to be totally earnest I'm enamored with any dish that combines thin shreds of crunchy daikon with a savory soy and mayo sauce. Their baked mussels are fabulous, as is their sea eel tempura. The quality and flavor of the uni and ikura have yet to fail me, and their octopus and hokki are consistently fresh with appealing and appropriate mouthfeel. My boyfriend is quite fond of their ika tempura, which has a sweet chili sauce, while I very much enjoy their seaweed salad. 

Yummy, consistently fresh food in a welcoming environment in an unexpected location.

They offer happy hour deals where some of their more popular menu items are available ala carte at discounted prices. 

You can also opt for a LARGE beer, in a glass that's at least 10"" tall!

The good was definitely the nigiris, not a huge selection but the fish used tasted delicious and looked very fresh. The non-rice pieces were a lot larger then the size of the rice which is always great.  I basically worked my way down the list of nigiris they served. Enjoyed most of them with  the tamago and garlic tuna being just a couple of the ones I like. The one thing I didn't like about the nigiris was the rice didn't seem right or at least made to how I usually get them. They kept falling a part and tasted like it was missing something.  The uni and sweet shrimp is only offered on the dinner menu which for $4 more you can upgrade from your lunch price but I wouldn't recommend unless you really want them, what I was told, the only difference is one order of uni and sweet shrimp.

The Salmon Skin handroll wasn't that bad, two bites and it was gone. They had something called the Monkey Balls and I had to try it.  It was meh didn't care for them. It was something bitesized and fried but runny and taste so good .  I poured some of the liquids or sauce out after the 1st bite. The fried tofu is served hot so let it cool down and poke salad was a bunch of seaweed and little fish both were alright. The salmon and tuna kamas were both burnt, dry, and overcooked. The green mussles were also burnt and overcooked. The shrimp tempura were standard, ended up getting maybe 5 orders just cause I love shrimp tempura. I didn't see any oysters which are another item I love getting at sushi spots. I sampled some of the rolls not bad. I need to try more they had your usual regular, fried, and baked rolls. 

Its a small place and it got busy on Saturday between lunch and dinner. The service started great and got my first orders quickly but after that there was almost 10+ min gap between me finishing my plates and them checking on me. I even got the bill early as I was still a little hungry.

Not located in the greatest parts of town, we entered the somewhat warm establishment. We were greeted right away and sat with a quickness. The server took quite a while taking our drink order and didn't express much in the way of personality. 

The music was quite eclectic, Asian techno, to indie music, to um..??? The decor was bland, much like the chicken dish I ordered but the cucumber salad was sort of redeeming really, how can you screw up cucumber salad anyway, right? 

The other half enjoyed one roll (I forgot which one) out of (I lost count), several and stated that a return visit wouldn't necessary be in the cards. Not that the food or service was so terrible, but that there are plenty of other, ""better"" choices out there for sushi. 

I give this joint 3-stars because it wasn't terrible and it was about as fantastic as an inexpensive sushi place could be to a non-sushi lover.

2470306,2014-02-27,2,MXC9pwIxovWUc9yu1F8OxA,"The selling point about Sushi Twister is the endless rows of items you can pick from that a regular customer could possibly spend a couple months eating here without ever needing to pick the same item. Can't think about which appetizer to choose? Bad news, folks. There's more than 20 appetizers to pick with not one option being any more than $7. Did another AYCE sushi not provide enough nigiri options? This one has another 20.

I actually wasn't in the mood for rolls but just wanted some plain tasty raw seafood. I love how this place seems to understand me unlike other restaurants. I never understood the concept of wanting to buy 12 pieces of the same tuna, so they offer ""mini-bowls"" that provide half the portions so you can order another half of something else.

I left with a lovely Chirashi bowl. Because I'm a slow eater and have odd eating hours, I ordered it to go. Holding true to visual presentation, the my to-go had the assortment of seafood so nicely done over the rice that eating and taking it apart was almost saddening. I never thought I would feel that way about a to-go order.

For those of you who either want to try a little bit of everything and not break the bank, Sushi Twister hits the spot.",cPcStFGBlk-6lWWsttIfVQ,4,2,4,oD6OViM9yPAhKiD235bNwg

I've been really craving sushi lately and since my bf doesn't eat it, I need a close solid take out option. I've had 2 personal friends rave about it, so I ran in (in slippers) and grabbed a menu. I decided on the Boulder Crunchy, the 9-1-1, and the jalapeño popper. The 9-1-1 was my favorite. Jalapeño was my least, BUT it wasn't that I didn't enjoy it. Just not my style, spicy tuna/crab mix inside a jalapeño like a popper. 
The woman who took care of me was SO SWEET. She seemed shocked that I tipped her. (Step your game up non Togo tippers) 
Also I didn't know this was Ramen Sora's sister place. Now I really can't wait to check them out, and also return here for the AYCE option. I will also be getting more Togo rolls as well!

I just pulled in, ordered 2 rolls to go, and then left with the rolls. Took about 15-20 mins to get the rolls. They have a pretty extensive selection with a whole menu section for fried/tempura maki (it's not just AYCE). The place was hopping, very busy for mid afternoon. I got an Caterpillar (eel avocado) roll that was good, and something called a Matsuri roll, shrimp tempura with tuna on top. For the take-out, they separated the sauces in little containers, which is a nice thought but it was tricky to eat in the car that way. ""Ecstasy sauce"" (on many of the maki rolls, including Matsuri) is a bit of eel sauce mixed with spicy mayo and some kind of roe. Matsuri roll was good, better than the eel roll.

I really wanted to like this place because it's near my house and the sushi place I usually go to is VERY far away. I walked in hoping that Sushi Twister can be my new sushi home.

The plate that I was given had a piece of rice and smears all over. I didn't want to make a big deal out of it but it wasn't a great first impression. The sushi comes out relatively fast, and you can immediately tell why this is a four star venue because they are honest with the rice. In a roll or nigiri there is little rice and plenty of fish.

However, a select few of the fish was not fresh. The hamachi was a troubling, dullish hue. I was so disappointed in the hamachi because it's one of my favorites. The shrimp tasted like it had been sitting for a while. I didn't DARE order sea urchin. On a positive note, I think my favorite were the salmon eggs. It wasn't as salty as others I've tried in other venues and it was the most enjoyable, surprisingly!

This is also a place you can bring ""newbies"" to sushi to - they have a lot of non sushi items on the menu. 
Don't miss the Bento Box for 2 deal. It's wonderful if you're craving sushi but a little light in the wallet. You get A LOT of sushi to try as well as tempura, teriyaki and grilled salmon. The staff is also very nice. Once when I ordered a la carte and my tab came up to more than the AYCE price, the manager told me about it and gave me the all you can eat price providing I finished what I was eating- really nice.

AYCE, I did this on a friday, 

There nigiri is very good, and there fish is fresh

There miso soup is good,

There service is good,

Basically there strength is the freshness of there fish, they have some Japanese staff, and they try to stick to traditional Japanese sushi. 

The Bad: There is too much rice on there sushi, there rolls are not as good as there nigiri.

There appetizers suck,

FOOD:
    Lunch buffet (~$21):  Great selection & great tasting sushi.  The salmon was hands down the best, as it melts in your mouth.  They also let you customize the sushi, whether you want cut rolls, hand rolls or something else.  However, their level 5 spicy sushi wasn't very hot & some items are limited to 1 per person (i.e. mochi dessert).

OVERALL:  Great hole in the wall joint I'll def. come back to. I prob shouldn't be telling you about this place since you might end up going here & causing me to have to wait for a table the next time I'm in town.

TIPS:  
They have both a lunch buffet (excludes drink; 11am-4pm) & dinner buffet.

3041376,2017-10-14,6,MXC9pwIxovWUc9yu1F8OxA,"Hmm I did come in for the AYCE but left paying for a la carte. 

My co worker and I discovered this place after going to a pumpkin patch nearby. 
Now, I feel like this joint can be compared to Jjanga on Decatur because every roll I got was a 10/10. 

Upon arrival, there was no wait, and we got seated immediately. The server was so pleasant and patient that it made me feel bad when we made things so complicated for him.

Let me just say that I always go out to eat sushi with my sister and we eat so much. We can eat up to 8 full rolls but that wasn't the case for this place. I went ahead and ordered 6 rolls as my co worker ordered 2 rolls. I was so surprised that she barely finished one roll. Yeah well we ended up having to pay for the left overs and it was either $88 in ayce or $80 in a la carte + we can take the left overs to go. We still got mochi in the end--they only have mango and strawberry--
I've come to a conclusion that most of their sushi rolls come in 10 pieces rather than the 6-8 I'm used to at other sushi joints. Could be why we still ended up with so much at the end but I'm frustrated that I didn't finish everything. I will be back!

I am a tough critic when it comes to fish....whether it's raw or cooked, I can only eat it fresh. I will literally gag if I'm served previously frozen fish.

With that said, Sushi Twister is not only awesome for serving fresh fish, but the AYCE concept just blows my mind. How can they serve such great quality fish at such reasonable prices? I mean, $30 per person for AYCE sushi AND kitchen ala carte items?! What?

Anyway, everything I ate was good. I especially liked the toro, uni, and amaebi nigiri sushi. I'm not into maki sushi but the oh my god roll which consisted of scallops, crab, and yum yum sauce was really delicious.

I started coming here a couple of years ago and now its tradition. I love the AYCE its totally worth every penny starting with the edamame and ending with the Mochi. Every time we come here we try a new roll and have all our favorites, I am a huge spicy fan and my boyfriend like the milder ones. My all time favorite is the Are You Ready? But he prefers the Tiger Yamazaki, they are always the first things we order and sometimes we end the meal with a second one each. I love the 911 and wish i could top all my rolls with that crunchy topping and eel sauce! now onto the service, We have a problem at most places we go because my boyfriend typically drinks 6-10 glasses of water with every meal and most servers are never on top of his refills but not here... They have someone that specifically is for refilling drinks and clearing plates so as soon as you pick up your last piece of sushi your plate is being picked up and our glasses never get under half full!! Sometimes the wait staff can be a little overwhelmed with tables but you never have to wait too long to order your next rolls!! It's a small restaurant but not as small as some sushi places I've been to in town, and defiantly worth the wait if you have to hang out for a few minutes before your table is ready.

Since it was my first time & my friend was bragging about how good the sushi is, we did mostly half rolls. This is probably the most sushi I've ever tried in one sitting :P Thank goodness for those half rolls! Anyway, the server was helpful & attentive. Right when you come in there is an anti-bacterial foam dispenser :) We were sitting in the middle of the restaurant at one of the higher tables. I don't remember them having a tv, but they did have a projector screen above the entry to the restrooms. They also have a Sushi Twister point card; after 10 all you can eat purchases you get one free~

Nigiri garlic tuna - it tastes just how it's described. delicious :P

N.Z. Mussels - not big on mussels, but the eel sauce & cream cheese made it taste better for me!

Call a doctor VS Friday the 13th - the sauces come on the side, but I really enjoyed this roll. it took me another 5 minutes to take another piece, but it was great. the habanera [isn't it habanerO? hm] is what got me

Ecstasy - I barely remember this roll because the Call a dr. was still burning my mouth. haha, but I know it was tasty! Spicy tuna with cucumber inside with more tuna on top

Spider Man - soft shell crab, cucumber, crab meat thats deep fried with eel sauce always gets me ;) dont forget the shrimp on top!!

Angry Ninja - this was new to the menu, same as the ninja roll but with habanera sauce on top. I dont know why, but that habanera sauce always felt like it was burning UNDER my tongue too. haha, weird

Magic Mountain - super duper light. there was barely any rice in this roll, so if you wana take a break with the carbs, eat this!!

Crispy Vacation - Most of the time I have soy sauce with my sushi, but this was the ONLY roll I dipped into soy sauce. Not as much flavor as I wanted, but then again those spicy rolls were probably still messing with my taste buds :/

Japanese Lasagna - This was my friend's favorite roll & he always gets it when we eat sushi. Honestly, they taste the same to me cause there's so much going on. I'm not hating though! I prefer to eat the baked rolls when I'm juust about to get full

Salmon Loves Lemon - I don't remember ever having a roll like this, but it was good! The sourness from the lemon was perfect since the lemon slice was super thin :9

Volcano - same description as Japanese lasagna.. and I have never had these many rolls in one sitting! BLAH

Oh My God - having soft shell crab & eel sauce is cheats! haha, I enjoyed it & my friend said ""it lives up to it's name.. OMG!!""

For dessert we had mango mochi ice cream & green tea ice cream. By this time I'm ready to explode from all the sushi. I went into the women's restroom [no, I did not #2 in the restroom! haha]. The signs on the door are so cute btw! But it was very clean & even had a nice floral scent in there. Sushi Twister, you had me at the foam hand sanitizer!!

3185474,2014-06-29,0,MXC9pwIxovWUc9yu1F8OxA,"I have been coming to this place for over 6 years now and it used to be one of my top 3 favorite AYCE in town. A lot of them have lower quality fish but not twister, that combined with the fact that the sushi chefs are friendly and generous and their 13 meals and get one free promotion, they had me sold. I've eaten here for free many, many, times. Recently though, even I have to admit their standards are falling. Now they have added new items to the menu, superwhite comes to mind, (it was good) and the ninja and angry ninja are still superb, but we ordered the spiderman, and it was not right. Came out as a completely different roll than ever before.. weird, pretty good, but still weird. So we ordered another one to see if maybe they changed the recipe, this one was different than any roll we'd ever had before.. still pretty good but what the hell were they serving us. Not being nit-picky but its pretty bad if the customers know the rolls better than the staff.. One of my favorite things to eat there is the monkey ball, I usually order 3 or 4 to myself but the sauce on these tasted so burnt and not sweet at all that it made them horrible, we barely finished one between us. The service wasn't great this time either as there were more staff in the restaurant than customers and we still couldn't get served/our order taken in a timely fashion. This coupled with the fact that when the guy combined my stamps from different cards he took all 8 off of cards with very long expirations and put them all on a card that had one stamp with a very close expiration. When I returned a week and a half later to claim it they told me I was a week late and most of the cards that I had their expiration was over 6 months away. Looks like they are trying to cut some corners and save some money but I think all that it is doing is driving long term customers away. I mean their fryer wasn't even to temp and all the fried things took forever and came out almost white instead of Golden Brown like they should be. For many years I would have given this place a 5 stars rating but no longer unless they clean up their act they may be another Vegas sushi casualty, especially when there are many better places now that are closer than the 45 mins it takes to drive to twister. It breaks my heart to write this review but maybe it will inspire them to go back to the place they used to be, or head someone away from a bad experience and into a good one.

Our server was really nice. 

But everything else was just OK. The gyoza was so-so. The seaweed on all of the rolls was very tough and hard to chew which I can't stand. 

My friend even got a crunchy piece of seaweed it was so dry.

Sushi Twister is located on the corner of Tropicana and Boulder Highway.  It's next to the gas station and shares the building with Starbucks.  

Service was really fast.  The sushi chef was very friendly.  

My first two orders were the salmon nigiri and the garlic tuna nigiri.  Both really fresh pieces of fish.  What I really liked about the nigiris is how firm the fish and rice are (they did not fall apart) AND the small piece of wasabi they add in the middle of the nigiri!  If you eat it all in one piece, you are sure to clear your sinuses!  My favorite part of the nigiri experience is definitely the surprise piece of wasabi!


Last, I got a half order of the Matsuri - four rolls of shrimp tempura, cucumber, tuna, drenched in Ecstasy sauce.  Ecstasy sauce contains fish eggs, mayo, ponzu, and I believe a little bit of chilli oil.  No need to dip it in soy sauce...the ecstasy sauce was amazing!

3418354,2013-01-26,0,MXC9pwIxovWUc9yu1F8OxA,"Definitely one of the top sushi places in town! It is located in a plaza on Tropicana and Boulder Highway, it's pretty far east compared to everything else I go to (which is usually somewhere on the west side of town). 

Plain and simple, they have one of the top quality fish in town with very good cuts. I would have to say they are on par with sushi restaurants I go to in Japan. Nothing is precut beforehand, they cut as they go. The fish are cut to the right thickness, not thin by any means, and the rice is minimal. 

Do be careful if you do not like wasabi, you must tell them to NOT put it in the sushi as they prepare it with a bit. 

I eat the same thing over and over usually which is ikura, tamago, and masago. I do have the ama ebi, ebi, tako, and sometimes salmon. I have yet to be disappointed by anything here. 

The AYCE is the typical prices you see around town about $27 for dinner at $22 for lunch. Completely worth it, even if you don't like sushi, you can choose from a wide range of appetizers that are delicious! They do have rolls but I go for the nigiri sushi and some appetizers. 

The UNLV Japanese Student Association uses Sushi Twister when they host their sushi nights at UNLV to enrich students in the culture of Japan and such. It is a big hit and good advertisement for them.",dM1HHK4szA5Qs6NSAaEk1Q,2,0,5,n5gMGr786xSbJlkpCGidbw

And it bieng ready when I arrived was nice . They greet you as soon as you walk in the door (which the place is a little small but in a cozy kinda way) the food itself was good.  I had shrimp tempura which the second time was so amazingly crisp I was very impressed.  The sauce is served on the side which helped in keeping it crisp until you bite into it. The prices are pretty good as well. And I noticed they have some decent lunch specials.  I definitely recommend.,3di7NHDH1Mk_YPm6v833qA,0,0,4,3CQx1geqCWilvBThaTG-Cw

So, I ordered the lunch special veggie tempura. It came with miso, salad, and 4 california rolls. The miso was good. Not too salty and it was flavorful. The salad was yum. It wasn't a typical ginger dressing, but it wasnt that sweet poppy stuff some places use. I would have liked a bit more but it was a lunch portion, so I can't complain. The rolls were good. I wish the crab wasn't the ""mush"" it was, but the rice was REAL good. The wasabi seemed ""muted"". I like it nice and spicy and when I put a big glob on my roll, my nose immediately opens up. It wasn't the case here but it was good. The tempura was delicious. Not greasy at all and I love love the pumpkin squash. LOVE IT! The carrot was perfect and so was the broccoli.

The beef lunch special is not bad either. It says on the menu it's a Kobe style filet mignon chip beef.  For $8.50 you can't go wrong.

Also, the servers need to bus their tables more often.  We hate sitting for 25 min with empty plates in front of us.

Ask my husband what his favorite food is and he will immediately tell you SUSHI; hands down!  When we moved back to Las Vegas 2 years ago we did not know where to go in Henderson. When we lived out here the first time, we had a favorite place over on N. Rancho but we moved to Henderson this time. While visiting the Albertson's (in the same parking lot as Sushi Twister, my husband saw this place and we decided to try it. 2 years later we are still enjoying this place and visit them at least 1-2 times a month (sometimes more).

Everything is fresh. Their Screaming O is to die for, their Spicy Tuna rolls are delicious, and their Japanese Lasagna is even better! Best place to eat sushi over on our side of town. The service is alright, could be improved a little it but nothing that needs a lot of complaining about. Even though we have visited them more than 50 times, they still ask us if we want the AYCE sushi and if we say yes, they tell us their ""rules"". Yes, Yes, trust me, I know them already.. but hey, they are doing their job.

The place is small and gets really busy on Fridays and Saturdays but it's cozy and quaint. The decor is good as well. We always sit at the bar because we like the interaction with the Sushi chefs and I like to see them make my sushi (I find it fascinating).

When we got seated we were helped out right away. Our server took our drink orders and then our food order when we were ready. The food came at a reasonable time. 

The only reason I knocked off one star from their rating is the fish to rice portion for the all you can eat. I normally like my sushi nigiri with more fish and less rice. Their so nigiri had more rice to fish. Another thing I like on their all you can eat is that you can place half orders for the rolls, which gives you a chance to try more rolls!

There are a few good rolls like the Freddy vs. Jason, Boulder Crunchy, and the Ecstasy roll but the majority of the rolls I didn't really find appealing.  I like the fact that they had low sodium soy sauce, good prices on Sake, and a giant screen projection for a movie or sporting event, but after going there a few times I'd rather stick to my usual hangouts.  On a side note, the chefs were pretty funny and just a tad bit obnoxious at times but that only added to the appeal of the Sushi Twister environment.

Unfortunately for us they close at 11, so coming late in the evening we were left with an hour or so to eat. When we were seated our waitress seemed a little annoyed, which was just really upsetting. She stressed that the kitchen would be closing in 45 minutes and that she would just rather have us acye-ers place all of our orders at once. We did just that. She made frequent visits to the table and occasionally threw in comments such as, ""Anything else? We all want to go home, you know.""  No one at my table seemed to take offense, but I, however, found it very disrespectful. The restaurant was not yet closing so for her to just hate her life and take it out on poor, innocent customers was just rude.  

It's unfortunate because the food was pretty good. I just can't get over the fact that our server had such a foul attitude the whole evening. It's like: Relax and smile a little.

I was hesitant when he dragged me out after 10 one night about a week ago to a late night sushi in a less-than-picturesque area of town.  I was extremely pleasantly surprised when we ordered our first bits from this sushi buffet.  Yummy food, very fresh seafood.  Friendly staff.  We've already been there a second time!

3896821,2012-11-29,0,MXC9pwIxovWUc9yu1F8OxA,"Pros: 
1. The staff are friendly and attentive.
2. The portions are just right considering the cost of each item.  
3. The atmosphere is upbeat, and the restaurant is clean.

Cons:
1. The chicken & beef teriyaki options are absolutely drowning in teriyaki sauce.  It would be better (and cheaper for the business) if the chef would hold back on the sauce a bit and allow the patron to ask for more sauce if necessary.
2. The all-you-can-eat (AYCE) option is priced a little high (Lunch ~$23, Dinner ~$27), especially when you consider that the Bellagio buffet is only a couple dollars more.  The lunch price should probably be closer to $17-$19, and the dinner option somewhere around $23-$25 (at most).  

Summary:
The AYCE menu has additional rules you need to know, such as a time limit and ""excess food"" charges.  Since these rules can change, I won't waste time writing them all here, but before you order, be aware of these rules.  Also, you may need to adjust your ordering strategy if necessary, such as ordering a lot of food right away because there's a time limit, and since your items are freshly prepared, you don't want to waste time waiting for your food to arrive.  

This place isn't cheap, but the quality and taste almost match the price.  I'm not convinced that this place is special enough to warrant a far commute, but if you're in the immediate area, I recommend a visit.",AZUF5EVwh-W08nrFTbKM4A,2,2,4,GJofdcFTjNDCWYeeEQbLDA

Twister Service:  You are always greeted immediately upon entry by the staff as well as when leaving.  Our servers have always been great with clearing empty sushi dishes and getting our orders in during AYCE sessions.  The sushi chefs are great with getting the orders to your table in a timely manner, especially with their baked and fried rolls. (see below)

Sushi Twister, Sushi:  All their Nigiri selections are either good or great in terms of freshness and they have a great selection.  However I'm a big fan of their rolls, here are my favs: Philladelphia with a Twist: A regular philly roll (cream cheese & Salmon) that adds Shrimp, Crab Stick, and yum yum scallops, all kinds of Gainz.  Magic Mountain: Salmon, Cream cheesed, soy paper and deep fried.  Japanese Lasagna: Crab Stick, avocado baked with cream cheese and yum um sauce.  Catch the pattern here with the cream cheese? =)

Sushi Twister Ambiance:  Smartly decorated with casual Japanese decorations.   They pack a lot tables and seats in a small area, but everything is spaced appropriately.  There's not a lot of seating so their can be a wait if they're busy. 

When I'm in the mood for AYCE with a focus on fried and baked rolls, Sushi Twister is my go to.  Not only are they delicious, they get them out quickly which I appreciate because they take longer to prep.  They aren't on my side of town, I know there's the chance of a possible wait because they're popular but in the end it's still worth it.  Enjoy!",AyjqBovADgbskmLrIBOMlQ,8,4,4,d7wRRL2aNO0mQJmvFDsVWA

The last couple of visits, we decided to have the AYCE sushi for lunch. for 23 or 24 dollars a person, it was A-OK. the menu they have here isn't so different from other Sushi places i've been to around Vegas excluding a small number of other special rolls. The quality is great and the taste is pretty good, but in my opinion not the best. Sometimes the rice is falling apart or not aligned correctly and evenly, that when i try to pick it up the rice slides out. Not too good but it doesn't really bother me too much.

The Service is good. Sometimes i have a feeling the waiter that serves us is in a rush and wants to get our order quickly so he can get on with another task. The Waitresses on the other hand are nice and keep a nice patient attitude which i prefer.

4106890,2015-10-03,4,MXC9pwIxovWUc9yu1F8OxA,"I guess a review update is overdue after 3.5 years.

Sushi Twister is a very convenient all-you-can-eat sushi restaurant because I live so close to it, but it hasn't ever impressed me enough to avoid the long drives to my favorite AYCE sushi spots. It's next to Starbucks and is near the 7-Eleven gas station on Boulder and Tropicana. One of my friends wanted to eat here last night, and I agreed since I most likely haven't been back here in over a year.

The appetizers are pretty good. Aurora shrimp are fried and breaded shrimp with a mayo-based sauce, and they really hit the spot if you're into that sort of thing. Their version of baked mussels either has little or none of the creamy sauce, but instead draw flavor from a dark sweet sauce. The sea eel tempura, which I don't recall trying before, is tasty and has the eel flavor but without as much of the typical sweetness of eel sauce. The tuna poke could've used more tuna but was otherwise a decent rendition. The screaming orgasm was delicious and had extra crunch from the tobiko (flying fish roe) mixed into the ubiquitous sauce.

The nigiri options are solid, although I'm always disappointed that super white tuna is not a standard option. It did make an appearance last night a special, and it did taste nice in spite of being topped with a sauce. I wasn't able to try it prepared sauceless because they ran out, which wasn't that shocking since it was late. I was pleasantly surprised at how good the limited nigiri options were. The sweet shrimp were flavorful and didn't feel mushy (and the fried heads were also nice), and the uni was above average for AYCE. While it wasn't the best that I've tasted on an AYCE menu, it wasn't discolored and didn't have any off-putting flavors. I only recall tasting salmon and tako among the other nigiri options, and both were also good.

I didn't have that much room left, so I kept myself to half rolls. I had to get my ""namesake"" Chris roll, which is shrimp tempura with eel on top. It was as good as I'd remembered. Sadly, I failed at reading comprehension and didn't enjoy my remaining choices. Mind you, they weren't bad in and of themselves, but the Cowgirl was entirely vegetarian inside and only had some seared beef on top, and the baked roll Alaskan Summer was not the best meal-ending option for me because it has a spicy yum yum sauce, rather than a standard yum yum sauce.

One reason that I've avoided returning is the limit of one dessert per person, and that hasn't changed. The mango mochi was an easy choice, and it's the standard mochi that you'll find anywhere. It was yummy, but I prefer having several desserts with AYCE sushi.

I was happy with the flavor and quality (AYCE-wise) of all of my orders, so perhaps I'll be back to Sushi Twister more often than once a year. It's quite a solid restaurant, but for those who don't live nearby, it's not destination-worthy. I'd only recommend it if you're exploring all that Vegas has to offer or if you've somehow tired of all the other places.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,4,3,4,3pFd8iJ4i5HKZ1XULqG5zg

The third was a rum jungle which is deep fried soft-shell crab crab meat and cucumber wrap with spicy tuna and Albacore. I made a point to order all the rolls with no sauce.  My second order of the hot chicken karage, I ordered with  sriracha sauce.  Almost forgot to order the much reviewed about salmon loves lemon roll, which is fresh salmon with lemon in a California roll.

We were a party of 3 and did the AYCE at dinner time. The price was 26-27.00 per person. 
The hostess and waitress/waiters cheerfully greeted us and we were immediately seated. This was our first time here but everything was self explanatory but if you need instruction for AYCE they offered to explain it or they have signage to look back on, well up on ( signs are posted on the walls). 

The decor is simple we kind of wished it was a little less fast foodie ish but the location is small. A fish tank or something might really look nice in there. 

Now onto the best part...THE SUSHI
The sushi was delicious and we ate our fair share of rolls and nigiri. The fish was fresh and served beautifully. Each roll had its own flavor and displayed like a work of art. Our water glasses were kept full, the waitresses were attentive and kept bringing our rolls out to us at a nice pace. 

We ordered: 
*Octopus Nigiri - my favorite it was delicious
*Tuna Nigiri
*Spicy Tuna hand roll- was delicious
*Rum jungle
*San Francisco fire 
*Chris Roll
*Yellowtail Mango wiz shrimp- my favorite 
*Screaming for vengeance 
*Spicy Kist
*9-1-1
*We also ordered a roll that had yellowtail and ponzu sauce that was not on the menu. It was delicious
*Spider- the only one we wouldn't order again only because the other rolls were so good. 
*Green tea ice cream and strawberry Mochi 

Really want to try the plum cucumber roll next time.

Definitely a busy spot, there was a wait for a table during our meal. Our waitress was great. She stopped by often to refill our drinks and to continue putting in our food order. 

The price for AYCE sushi was reasonable, around $26 per person for dinner. The AYCE menu offered a large variety of items. They offer standard rolls, specialty rolls, appetizers, nigiri, and even a couple of desserts. 

My favorite roll was the Salmon Loves Lemon. We ordered this twice because it was so fresh and refreshing with the lemon. The 9-1-1 roll was good and a little spicy, but nothing over the top. Boulder Crunchy was good, but not my favorite. Gyoza was yummy and not overly greasy given that you get to choose between deep fried and pan-fried.

I love the mochi ice cream too. We went home so FULL and we were really satisfied. However, the japanese lady (I think she is the owner) when she was taking our last order, I felt like she doesn't want to take it anymore because we had too much already. LOL!

4520412,2013-07-29,1,MXC9pwIxovWUc9yu1F8OxA,"Craving all you can eat sushi? Well... if you're in the area, throw this place under your radar! Sushi Twister has the fastest service I have experienced at a sushi restaurant.

I went here on a Saturday night with a party of three, after golfing in Tuscany.  I wasn't sure if there was going to be anything around for miles... but sure enough we came across this little sushi joint on yelp, so we decided to try it. 

It's located in a pretty odd place... small building behind a 7-11 in the lot of an Albertsons... yeahhh weird. Building looked like it was cut out of a strip mall from chinatown... 

But anyways, back to the story... as we were driving there I called ahead to make a reservation, the hostess had informed me that they only accept reservations after 9pm, but since I was calling ahead 10 minutes she put us down. As we got there we were seated promptly, there were a few tables still open. All of us chose all you can eat which cost $26.95 a person, same rules as anywhere else except you can only be seated for one hour for all you can eat. At first I was slightly offended by the rule, but it didn't seem like they enforced it much and the service definitely made up for it. 

What I found especially great about this place was the speed of service and sushi quality. I think we waited a total of 15 minutes from being seated to having our first roll delivered to our table. This was awesome and the rest of the rolls were no exception! Not only that but the portion sizes were great too, some rolls only had 5 pcs so if you didn't like the taste it was bearable and if you wanted me, heck that's why it's all you can eat, at least you wouldn't be stuck stuffing rolls in napkins. 

What I didn't like... the plating and atmosphere. The plating was a little disappointing in comparison to the presentation and quality of the sushi. It really bothers me when sushi restaurants use plastic or lightweight plates/bowls... it definitely had an effect on my perception of the overall experience. Also the music totally felt out of place and took away from the average sushi bar look and, it sounded like they were blasting Mix 94.1... I remember hearing a song by My Chemical Romance at one point. Not really sure how that gets you in the mood for sushi... but luckily I was in a group and able to tune it out... 

Recommendations:

Hands down the best roll for the night was the Angry Ninja, it had a bit of a kick to it but the warm crunchy goodness was delicious!

The Mango Moji had a very realistic flavor to it and tasted delicious as well!


Overall, my expectations were definitely exceeded... I wasn't expecting to have quality sushi from a small joint behind a 7-11... I was very satisfied with the speed of service 5/5, the sushi quality was also a 4/5, however the plating and atmosphere/vibe of the place was off 3/5 for each...

I've filled up 3 AYCE punch cards and pretty much every weekend, and sometimes during the week my wife and I end up here. 

Sure it's on Boulder Highway. And yes it's a little small. And if they are busy sometimes you might have to wait a few minutes to get your orders in. They get a lot of Uber Eats orders especially on weekends that can slow things down a little. But when you get a G-Spot roll or a 911 spicy roll on your plate and you take a bite...yeah, even those of us who are grumpy about waiting forget all about it. (The fish from salmon to halibut tastes fresh. And their spicy rolls are not excessively loaded with sauces and spices either. They don't just slap it together and send it out, they try and make sure it's made correctly).

Again, 40+ visits. We've only had one roll in all that time that wasn't made right and when we called it to their attention it was addressed quickly and without any attitude. Even my 7 year old son doesn't mind going with us now as he's a fan of their fried shrimp and their ice cream!

Last night my wife and I ordered the Deluxe Bento Box meal (or whatever it's called).  It supposedly serves 2 people, and it costs $30.  Well, after we had each eaten ourselves to an uncomfortable state of fullness, there was enough food leftover to have fed an additional person.  It came with 11 pieces of sashimi, a reasonably large plate of assorted rolls, and then the holy-crap-there's-more-food? final plate that consisted of grilled teriyaki beef, teriyaki chicken, a piece of grilled salmon, and several pieces of tempura.  For $3 more than the all-you-can-eat price for one person, my wife and I ate until we felt ill.

First off, it is loud in here which is fine I like the music. If the server can't hear what you want she needs to come closer to you and ask, or ask you to speak louder.  
I have a normal sounding voice it's not low. I also always order the same thing which obviously isn't expected to be remembered but ""I know"" I've gotten my simple order messed up at least 3 times I've come here. Screaming for vengeance and angry ninja are two very different sushi's.. yes they're both spicy but seriously? How do you mess this up.

On another note, when you have a huge family and everyone gets all you can eat... it is expected that everyone can get all you can eat. And order whatever you want from the menu within the 60-90 min that you can eat right?
We had all ordered our food, the food was good, it was gone within a couple minutes... the servers would never come around to take more orders of food, no beers, no drinks... I mean it's all you can eat right? Or is it all we can eat when they want?

4934492,2013-10-20,2,MXC9pwIxovWUc9yu1F8OxA,"I was a bit nervous to come here because the first reviews I looked at were more than a few months ago and I did not see a steady stream of timely reviews. However after reading Mike B's review, where he gave it a five star, I thought I should try this place out. Not bad for a non traditional or non authentic sushi restaurant.

a.  Location - 3 star - Near my office, located on Boulder and Trop across from Sam's Town.  I like it because there are not too many great places on this portion of town to go.  However, I cannot give this place higher as this place location is not run down, however, it does not feel totally safe. 

b.  Service - 4 star I rate the service first as this is what you first encounter.  When the service does not seem to be Japanese I actually get a bit confused and wonder what I am in for.  However, I will gtive the service 4 star as I am reviewing this restaurant and an AYCE style place and let's face it, if it has those complex rolls, it is a non-traditional sushi restaurant.

c.  Food - 4 star.  My rating scale for any sushi restaurant is based on traditional foods and then I order all that big mac rolls that these places serve. Yep, I like those goofy rolls.

- Amaiebi - Sweet Shrimp Nigiri Style sushi . Not bad, came out quickly and nice proportion of ebi and rice.  However, I have to seriously question this as they do NOT serve this dish traditionally where they cut off the shrimp heads and then deep fry the heads and serve them after. This means that where they are buying their shrimp is where the heads are not attached? Or perhaps not live?  Let's face it, if you are service LIVE shrimp it will have the heads on them.  It is a way traditionalists know how fresh the seafood is.  In this case, no head, not fresh.  THREE STAR!.

- Maguro- Again, my standard is ordering fatty tuna nigiri style with a thin slice of lemon and jalapeno.  This is a great dish if the slices of lemon and jalapeno are thinly sliced and in this case, it was absolutely not only thinly sliced, it was the jalapeno was artistically done.  FIVE STAR. 

- Uni - The Sea Urchin was absolutely great, nice texture and flavorful.  FIVE STAR.

- All the other westernized rolls - I ate a lot of these and enjoyed them for what they were.  Nothing really stood out for me, mainly due to the amount of flavors.  They have many that are ""level 4,5"" in spice index and I had these and they were not too spicy.  So I would recommend it. THREE STAR.

As the sister restaurant to Ramen Sora in Chinatown, i would say it is cool that they have a sushi place on the far east side of town. There must be great demand for it.   They have a 60 minute limit on AYCE, and mainly due to fact that they have limited seating and it does get busy.  Overall, nice place, I can absolutely recommend this place and it is somewhere I will come back to for sure.",owlUazXSDLaxlOV7z8181g,5,4,4,B3UKjXau8xFgTc92i2Lt8g

First time was for my birthday and this review will be for yesterday. We entered the restaurant just before a rush, so we got in right away and were seating. The Sushi chefs and waiters/waitress' were all very quick to respond to what we needed and were very friendly. 

Rolls are very good here, though a lot of them contain fillers (Almost all had cucumber), highly recommend the Matsuri and Tiger Yamazaki rolls. I also had their Angry Ninja roll which was suppose to be one of the hottest rolls they had, sadly it wasn't hot enough for this man to burn, but hey the taste of the habanero sauce was hot, sweet, and just all around good for people who aren't more accustomed to hot foods like myself.

But for me with any Sushi place I go to, its all about the Nigiri. To me, if a place cannot do nigiri right then I don't have high hopes for anything else in the place. I had just about every type they had and all of them were very fresh, they actually season the rice unlike most places as well.

Now don't be scared if someone hits you up for a cigarette or try to sell you fake flowers, but push beyond that to the sushi goodness! 

I haven't done the ayce here, but my love is the sashimi plate. They have beautiful cuts of fish. I also love that they have a small and large option when it comes to the sashimi plates. For you ayce lovers they also will do half rolls!! 
If you are looking for something to accompany your sushi I suggest the Dynamite. It has scallops coupled with mushrooms and beautifully caramelized onions that totally add a sweetness to the dish. 
If you are looking to kick back a couple cocktails they do offer many beers. They are super reasonably priced.
 I've had their house Plum Wine and their Plum champagne. I definitely prefer the champagne. It has a much lighter and fruitier taste. It does pair well with the sashimi in my opinion. 

The staff! Omg nicest people ever. Plus, they definitely have a sense of humor. I've knocked over several of their plastic menu stands and they are always nice about it and joke with me. They are even kind to my father who tends to get messy with his soy sauce and wasabi mixing. Plus, their music selection is spot on!!!! Props on that. It's something that definitely sets the tone for a dining experience.

5042121,2014-08-05,2,MXC9pwIxovWUc9yu1F8OxA,"Before my Seattle trip, a friend and I had a sushi craving. The wonderful think about living in Las Vegas is having the option to go to AYCE (All you can eat) sushi joints. I've heard some really great things about this place from friends and neighbors. The best thing is that it's located right up the street from my house. This meal was a brainer. 

This joint is located on the southwest corner of a very busy strip mall. Walking into the restaurant, you'll notice that it's cozier inside than it looks outside. The joint has a few sushi bar top seating, a couple of high top tables and a few other table seating. Staying in place for a couple of hours, I've noticed that the servers do a good job turning out the tables so there's no wait. Speaking of our servers, they were very efficient. They always came by the table to see if we were alright and if we needed anything else. For the most part, good service. 

For my meal, I decided to get the All You Can Eat option for $26.95 per person. If you're going to have a few rolls, this would be the best option. Keep in mind though, this is one of  the only places I've noticed that holds everyone to the 1 hour limit. Whenever I go with the AYCE option, I tend to chow down on a lot of Nigiri sushi as it's usually a lot ala carte. On this visit, I went with the salmon, ahi and tako nigiri. The serving size was good and the fish was fresh! For other options, I went with chicken katsu, baked mussels, mochiko chicken, shrimp tempura and gyoza. All dishes were good. The katsu used white meat but had a nice crunch to it. For my gyoza, I asked for it steamed. It was flavored nicely and cooked nicely. 

Overall, the food is definitely worth returning to. The food came out fast, the service was nice and everything was super filling. If you're willing to eat in an hour and then leave, come down and check them out!",CNaaizAUc2c4WIb1M3BBPw,10,4,4,mxUCZvJHufhn7gSjou7Ukg

And I am not talking about plain restaurants, I was talking about delicious sushi chaos! So I knew the perfect place to tame the wild beasts of a family was the one and only, Sushi Twister!  It is also owned by Ramen Sora in Chinatown.

The trip was a little farther than our home. It was on the other side of town and in a sketchy area. As we got there, we were disappointed and excited because of the long wait in line. It took 20 minutes! But once we got inside, the waitress brought our drinks in a jiffy. Now comes the sushiness you've been waiting for!

So we started with a large order from the AYCE menu, the long wait had starved us. We got the usual rolls like caterpillar, dragon, and lots of salmon nigiri along with some of  their special rolls like the tiger yamazaki and the sushi-twister and ninja. The ""salmon loves lemon"" was slightly tart when eating with the slivers of lemon, but was oh so good! The crispy vacation roll was crunchy from the garlic flakes with a nice bit of spicy from the tuna.  The orders came so fast that we had to order MORE! 

We ordered the yellow mango with shrimp though the yellow mango was a bit overpowering. The baked scallop appetizer was a little too burnt on top and a bit oily for our taste. Baked mussels were also pleasing. The ordered chicken skewers brought us accidentally to another dish called the pork katsu with a tasteful sauce. All the rolls had good consistency.  The overall experience with the dishes were outstanding, just like the staff's fast and friendly service! 

The interior of the place was a tad bit tight, thus creating the long line. There was a projector screen which had the Sochi Olympics showing. It was a nice size for entertainment. The atmosphere was busy and the chef's were making those great rolls. The prices are comparable in town with kids 8 and under for half the adult prices.

Overall the service and sushi overcame the long wait and trip so I gave them 5 stars. In the end we came home happy, stuffed, and satisfied!",Fw4UjJ6yBeyPB27Y4wwEUQ,8,5,5,Q9jKv2AG-KV_JKJXSU-M1w

The halloween roll was super yummy. Spicy without being crazy mouth on fire spicy. The fresh salmon is buttery and soft. The seared tuna nigiri is also one of our favorites. The dynamite appetizer of baked scallops, onions and mushrooms is TO DIE FOR. Also the screaming orgasm of fresh raw fish chunks. Yum.

My guy also ordered an order of smelt egg nigiri and I ordered an order of Garlic tuna nigiri. Both of which were not fresh. We alps recieved a salmon loves lemon roll which we did not order but we ate anyway and that was also pretty good. 

Service was alright and the nigiri should have been fresh,but I would drive elsewhere for sushi even though it's convienently located close to my home. 

Don't forget that yelp hours are not correct. They close at 10 not 11!",r0j4IpUbcdC1-HfoMYae4w,3,1,2,P64YFlb_mVc78543b5CDRA

5134651,2011-06-29,0,MXC9pwIxovWUc9yu1F8OxA,"Some of the freshest, best tasting sushi I've had here. My husband got an inside tip from a co-worker that knows that the owner purchases the fish the day it's flown in, so it was worth the drive to try it out. Now that we've made the trip & know that the quality of the fish they serve is top-notch, we will not hesitate to go back. Wish it was just a tad bit closer to home but that's my ""I don't want to get in my car & drive any further than I have to when it's 110 degrees"" side coming out. I will suck it up though & make the drive b/c it's that good! 

We've been twice now & both times we have loved everything we've tried. I should preface this by saying that I am not a huge fan of all the ""fancy"" rolls that have become so popular over the last decade or so. I'm an old-school sushi eater, I like the simplicity of Sashimi & Nigiri. I like to taste the fish. When it's all wrapped up in a roll covered in sauces & tempura crunch, it can be very hard to tell if you're even getting a fresh piece of fish & that worries me a bit! 

The 1st time we went, I had a hankering for Salmon terriyaki & was not really in the mood for sushi. Maybe only the 2nd time in my life that has ever happened! I did order the Poki appetizer & it was AH-mazing. The salmon terriyaki was good although the sauce was way too thick & there was too much of it covering the fish. If I order it again, I will definitely ask them to go easy on the sauce! Hubby ordered the AYCE & from what I could tell, he enjoyed every roll he had. 

This last time we both had the AYCE & I will probably only do that from now on. It's a great value even if you don't eat very much & you can choose from hot & cold appetizers as well as all the sushi choices. I ordered the Poki again along with some Nigiri orders & even a couple of the ""fancy"" rolls, mainly b/c I already knew that their fish was fresh. I liked the Angry Ninja & the Sushi twister roll the best. I think I could eat that Japanese salsa all by itself.. yum!  

I was slightly disappointed that they don't have fresh wasabi. Most of the better Sushi restaurants I've been to have it available for an extra charge so I was surprised they didn't have it. I have developed quite the affinity for it & can't really eat the stuff made from a powder anymore. I hope they consider making it available in the future & would be happy to pay an extra dollar or 2 to have some for my sushi. 

We will be bringing the kids next time. Sushi gets very expensive when we go out as a family but the AYCE deal will make it much more reasonable & they will be thrilled.. ""anything we want?!""",4dSX2TsK3jF-g8HzIpYGrg,0,1,5,i8XjNfqMjs8K1PV6RvjgtQ

The AYCE was $27 which had a large variety of rolls on the menu. I definitely loved the fact that you can order half rolls instead of the full rolls, because this gives you an opportunity to try different rolls without getting full. A lot of california sushi restaurants do not adopt the half roll concept, which is irritating. 

The interior is small, which is a negative aspect because of their large fan base. The interior is clean and the staff is very busy but attend to their customers in a timely manner. The bathrooms contain single person bathrooms. The surrounding area of the restaurant does contain transient stragglers here and there,  but for the most part, they won't bother anyone.

5244620,2017-07-17,0,MXC9pwIxovWUc9yu1F8OxA,"Sushi Twister is pretty much my go-to Sushi restaurant. The restaurant itself is pretty average, but the sushi is always on-point. When you get the AYCE (which is the only way I've ever ordered it), your appetizers come out pretty quick and hot (when it's supposed to be hot). They also don't make you wait too long between rounds of stuffing your face with the last roll you ate. My favorite is the 'Boulder Crunchy', 'Call a Doctor vs. Friday the 13th', 'Angry Ninja' and of course all of the Nigiri Rolls. 'Hot Shrimp' is my favorite appetizer. 

Where do they come up with those names? Your guess is good as mine.

Oh, they also have a punch card giving your 12 All You Can Eat for free. You just have to use it within one year. Easy to go to this place once a month.

I got the poke bowl - meh a lot of rice. My friend got the trio bowl neither of us finished. The happy salmon lemon lover (or something like that) had a half roll that WAS good. the other half roll I think the ecstasy (maybe) was sloppy and just okay with too much sauce on it.

I was there for lunch one day and I sat at the bar in front of the owner. Everything was going fine until his friend showed up with his own fish. The owner started to cut his friends fish and setting up sashimi plates right in front of me and decided to completely ignore all my orders after. He started to give my orders to the guy next to him. It sucked I left with great disappointment. So I decided to never sit in front of him again like I told myself last time. I went in there with my family and wanted to sit at the bar. We waited for about an hour for a spot at the bar because it appeared that again the owner was serving his friend and somebody who appeared to be his brother. I have spend thousands of dollars at this place and I do not get treated well there. We still did not get to sit at the bar and that was it. I am never going there again... I left and found another all you can eat spot that night. Sin city sushi is off of Eastern in Henderson just south of the 215. To my surprise when I walked in. JIMBO!! the old owner of Mandas that use to be on Sahara :) If any of know sushi in Vegas that was one of the most popular spots in Vegas.

I started with some Nigiri mackerel, red snapper, and seared tuna, all were fresh and tasty. I opted for the pan friend gyoza and mussels, they were both good.

- Next to starbucks. Near Eastside Cannery Casino.
- Easy parking. Great timing. No wait. Seated right away. 
- Sit at bar for faster sushi service. 
- For appetizers, order from waitress. 
- Friendly waitress. She actually told us she doesn't mind if you don't eat all your rice. Just try your best. haha! 
- Amazing sushi chef! We had the legit old Japanese guy. 
- My method of attack:
1. Get all the items with a happy face on it. That means that they are expensive and limit one per person.
2. Get the items with the moon icon for dinner only. 
3. Look for the most expensive rolls. 
4. Save room for the mochi. 
- My recommendations unique to Twister 
1. Island tuna poki: good side with sushi
2. Screaming orgasm: great appetizer
3. Salmon loves lemon: for salmon sashimi lovers
4. Spider-Man: for soft shell crab lovers
5. Rum jungle: Great japanese salsa taste
- Only AYCE that I've been to where you can get 1/2 a roll! Great for selection.

5361283,2011-06-26,0,MXC9pwIxovWUc9yu1F8OxA,"**Summary**
       - Sushi Rice - They use their own wooden sushi rice tub so their rice tastes a ton better than other places that just use a simple rice cooker. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/MXC9pwIxovWUc9yu1F8OxA?select=Ibo4zWnSyIkQgruCj7ilVw)
       - Freshness - Their salmon and ikura were especially fresh. 
       - Special Daily Fish - They have daily fish specials like fatty tuna. However, the day we went, they ran out.
       - Service - Our chef was friendly and very quick. The place was packed so I understand why the waitresses were a bit laggy.
**Price**
       - $21.95 Lunch Open - 4pm.
       - $26.95 Dinner 4pm - Close.
**Ordered**
       - Monkey Ball - Spicy Tuna and Mushroom in a tempura ball. The mushroom overpowered the rest of the dish, but it was an interesting idea.
       - Aurora Shrimp - Fried shrimp with Japanese mayo on top.
       - Dynamite - Scallops, onion, mushroom, and imitation crab meat on a big half shell. One of the best Dynamites I've had.
       - Sushi-Twister - Shrimp Tempura and Tuna with Japanese Salsa (Ponzu sauce base with a spicy kick)
       - Oh My God - Yum Yum scallops, imitation crab, and soft shell crab with eel sauce. Heavier roll, but delicious.
       - Yellow Mango with Shrimp - Yellowtail, mango sauce, and shrimp. It was a light roll and the mango sauce added a sweet flavor.
**Recommendations**
       - I'd definitely recommend this place. The fish is fresh, the rolls are inventive, and the appetizers are delcious. It's a no brainer.",37S80IUIfb8yMsSwWWDsFA,3,0,5,zhaXQjHY7vfYR7Cm3qSdXQ
5369457,2008-12-14,2,MXC9pwIxovWUc9yu1F8OxA,"Okay went to sushi twister today due to the fact that my new sushi bar does not open for lunch on saturadays which is ""island sushi"" on eastern ave.  I went here because the yelp reviews were good. here's the low down.

1. went for lunch  around 2pm today price $21.99 for all you can eat sushi.

2. the selection was good including a wide a sortment of appetizers and rolls.

3. Tried my favorite roll rainbow it was okay, too much rice so we stopped ordering rolls and went straight for the nigiri.

4. the seared tuna and garlic tuna, halibut were great. The eel anago was good also.

5. your all you can eat sushi includes dessert, red bean ice cream good stuff.

Why did i give them only 2 stars, it's service the wait staff who took your appetizer orders were good. but the sushi chef started out nice but kinda of ignored us seeing that we eat a lot. Last time I check I payed for all you can eat. We did'nt exceed the time limit which is 45 min for lunch. Also the fact that me and my friend were the only ones in the restaurant, there were two sushi chefs and they were extremely slow, like I said we felt like we were being ignored after few orders. It's like you bastards eat too much so it's time for you to go. Hint hint. The food is good but because of that factor I could not reccomend this place unless all options were closed.
Only bright thing the sushi chef did give us couple of blue fin tuna nigiri but so what, in the end its the service that keeps you coming back. You dont know how many friends i have that eat sushi that could pop up you business. 

""""""I hope that the owners read this review and change their attitude because why advertise all you can eat in 45 min if your not gonna honor it, towards the end i felt like i had to beg the sushi chefs for more. Also island sushi lunch is 1.5 hours double the time of sushi twister and they were so nice and the food was unbelievable****

Then after several of years of knowing what types of sushi i liked and didnt like.  Also, been to dozens and dozens of sushi joints. Sushi Twister is a place I would say is a MUST GO! 

My mom and I went here twice in one week and man their sushi and lunch/dinner specials is a great deal.  

I ordered the Beef Lunch Special ($8.50) and it included a Kobe Style Filet mignon beef steak, & 4 pieces of California rolls. (Amazing!!!) I think the dinner special is about $12 which includes 8 pieces of California rolls, 2shrimps, & vegetable tempura.  Both the Dinner & lunch special is great.
The Kobe style beef steak is very tender,juicy, and very flavorful.  One of the best I have ever tasted.  The price for their lunch/dinner special is worth it.  

Other things w ordered are:
Japanese lasagna
Spider Rolls
Ika (Squid)
& Philadelphia with Twist

It is the focal point of this establishment and got me to venture away from my normal nigiri fixation. In fact, my normal means of choice is lackluster at Sushi Twister. They offer many of the quintessential fishes, but nothing particularly unique.

On the other had, the rolls were not predominantly tempura shrimp based, so my two friends and I went crazy on them. The spice levels next to some rolls made for an exciting adventure, but sometimes falls short of what was promised. I did not find any of the level fives to be unbearable or even tongue tingly. Instead they had a controlled heat that went well with the other components. The Crunchy, Angry Ninja, Kill Samurai were all good. We were even surprised by how much we liked the Cowgirl. Normally we would not order a beef roll, but the meat was tender and cooked medium.

The appetizers comprised of many standard options and a few specials. The oysters are a must get if they are offered. One order per person is the limit, but the two large bivalves should not be passed up. The Monkey Ball is also becoming more common.

My AYCE strategy is that I normally order as much variety of nigiri as I can to try and then have a roll or two. I'll usually order two orders of each fish. But here, the cuts of fish on the nigiri were so large that I only ordered one order of each fish after the first round. The sushi is solid, nothing out of the ordinary as far as selection of fish. But I was filled up pretty fast on the nigiri and didn't have room to try any of the rolls. So rolls will be on the agenda for the next visit.

I should say straight off, I don't like sushi, as such I stuck to the bigger dinner meal. The price point is low, most full meals under $10. I had the steak which was not bad, certainly good for the price, my wife had the teriyaki chicken, which for $8.95 is amazing value.

So the food is good, the price is more than right, so why only 4 stars. Simply the service wasn't good. For example, order a diet coke to drink, waitress bring iced tea, no big deal, but to have to remind her twice isn't good.

And the biggee, a pet hate of mine, unlisted food items in a meal, not a big deal to most people, but to those with alergies it can be very dangerous, as such I asked what came on my dish, steak, rice, soup and salad (told you its good value) of course the part that wasn't mentioned just happens to be the dangerous food for me, onions, luckly they were in plain sight, so no issues, again an issue mainly for me, but still something that even McDonald's can get right.",5XKjVehgGzb5dJocdI-36Q,2,0,4,km0ul_j56tJZs5XILVdCkQ

For big parties (since everytime I'm here, it's with a big party of 6+), they will do split checks. Ask for the stamp card so that you get a stamp for each person and get the 10th ayce free.

Unlike some places, they will do half rolls, but not on everything. They only have two types of mochi ice cream (and it's one per person) of mango and strawberry. For their unlimited ice cream, they only have green tea and red bean. I wish they had chocolate of either :(.

Each time, I'm pretty happy with their service so that's a plus. Pretty consistent, too. The only reason why I wouldn't come here as often would be because of its location. So far away from me :(. If you're in the area, DROP BY FOR SOME SUSHI!",7weuSPSSqYLUFga6IYP4pg,3,1,5,tEQSfxDP7YFdoiID_9fZGw

We decided on the AYCE so we could get our fill of sushi in to satisfy our cravings.

My man had been craving a roll they have that is wrapped in a jalapeno wrapper and deep fried that he always talks about being so good. Well he orders it which is now listed on the appetizer section of the menu and it was not anything like he remembered. The way he described it and the way it tasted was nothing like he had described or had before. The size was tiny not a full sized roll as before, so that was a let down and it was so small I could not even sample it.

Here are some of the rolls that we ordered, 
boulder crunchy roll
spider roll
screaming for vengeance roll
ecstasy roll
shrimp tempura roll
Philadelphia roll
dead dragon roll
angry ninja roll

For some reason the cucumber in my rolls caused a burned taste as if it was char broiled or blackened so I asked them to omit any cucumber from my future rolls.

The rolls were OK, nothing that gives me the oral mouth orgasm that Oyshi gives me on every visit. The flavor was just not there as I was expecting or had hoped for.

This was across town, quite a drive to try a sushi joint that I had never been to however we are spontaneous like that. My sweetheart said the Sushi was good in last visits however it seems they have changed and the rolls that he liked are just not what they once were.

OK so we gave it a shot and it disappointed unfortunately, and I am surprised because the reviews and star rating on Yelp are pretty good so?

I can't go to Monta anymore because the tall Japanese girl who works there figured out who I am and she has been treating me real bad since I posted that bad review about the place. 
I can't go to Shuseki anymore because it turns out the psycho old man from Ichiza eats there every night, and he is still pissed off at me because a few months ago  I made a very unflattering impersonation of him. 
I don't want to go to Anime Ramen anymore because ever since Ryosuke went back to Japan, the service and food has been bad. I hope he comes back soon. 
So, I was just about to go to Yagyu for Ramen when I remembered that SUSHI TWISTER is owned by the same dude who owns RAMEN SORA. So in my head I was like: ""Maybe Sushi Twister will have Miso Ramen since they are owned by the Sora people!"". The very thought of me eating AYCE Sushi and Sapporo Style Ramen at the same time overstimulated my brain. I was very disappointed when I arrived at TWISTER to see no Ramen on the menu. But, after ordering two pieces of Nigiri and having a great conversation with the Japanese sushi chefs, my disappointment left instantly. 

This place actually has AYCE TORO! I have NEVER seen that before. But according to one of the workers, the AYCE TORO is like a random promotion. Some days when you show up they will have it, but most days they won't have it. So coming here for the AYCE TORO special is like gambling. 

The Tuna nigiri has the highest quality Tuna I have seen in years. It wasn't even Toro but it had that fatty marbling. The fish was so shinny that the light reflected off it like a shard of glass. The Tuna literally just instantly melts inside your mouth. 

The Eel Sauce with my Unagi was very strong. I don't know how they get the sauce to have that certain kind of deepness. 

I love places that make their own tempura sauce. Places that use that generic bottled stuff suck. SUSHI TWISTER has possibly the best Tempura sauce I have ever had. 

They got the best Sushi Rice on the face of the earth. It's seasoned perfectly! Many people don't have the sophistication to notice small details like that, but because I am so awesome I can.

My personal favorite ""Ichiro Mashita"" roll is the Dead Dragon. You should try it! 

I also want to point out that this is the only AYCE Sushi place I have ever been to that puts wasabi in the nigri. Other AYCE Sushi places don't do this because they market their restaurant towards ""westerners"". 

I am actually really happy that I came here today. I had a very entertaining conversation with the a chef named Hiro. And all the workers were really great to me. 

When it comes to AYCE Sushi, Goyemon can't touch this place. Also, I rather come to small independent places like SUSHI TWISTER or SUSHI ON RAINBOW any day over one of Martin Kollefs multi-million dollar bankrolled hipster/douchebag sushi orgy places.

UPDATE OCT- I've lowered the rating from 5 stars to 4 because one of the sushi chefs accused me of being ""HOOTO"". When I told him that I didn't know what that was, he began to describe the person. Eventually I figured out that he meant Hootie B.... I was like: Are you f*cking joking? Do I look like a middle aged man with a Korean wife? Apparently, he thought I was ""Hooto"" because I told him about how most people on Yelp want to kill me. Don't get me wrong. I am a big fan of Hooto reviews and his Sysco comments always have me rolling on the floor laughing, but how the hell do you confuse me as him?",JM0GL6Dx4EuZ1mprLk5Gyg,8,6,4,CQJa0ZDlv4QVow4X8xf11w

I had asked for this not to be present on my Chirashi Bowl, and I was fine with it being omitted and still pay full price for the meal, but they included it anyway.  The rest of the bowl was either odd tasting (octopus) and out of places, such as the smoked salmon which I don't typically encounter on a Chirashi or Japanese sushi menu.  Did I mention that the tuna was also stringy?

I'm hoping that this experience was a one off as the rest of the reviews appear to be fairly consistent.  I plan on writing a follow-up review once I get to eat at the actual restaurant.  For now, I hope that everything was a mistake and an accident.",Y_polWPxlC9e9EzAte-6PQ,0,0,2,y04qI7opuLT3ufH94t8NyA
