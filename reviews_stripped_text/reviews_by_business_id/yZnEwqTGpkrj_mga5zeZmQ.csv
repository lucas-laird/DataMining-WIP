The husband ordered the $10 basket of wings, fries and drink. Even though my dog was great, I couldn't resist trying out his wings. Let's put it this way, when we returned the next evening we both ordered $10 basket of wings. The cashier remembered us from the night before and even comped our soda's.

The place looks really cool, like a 50's diner, and is super clean so first appearance was pretty good.  The guy taking our order, who I believe was the manager, lived up to the billing of ""not so friendly"" as he seemed to be incapable of smiling and a bit impatient.  He also asked what name to call out when it was ready and I told him my name.  

So we waited about 10 minutes, then another 10 minutes and then about 25 minutes in (what takes so long to fix some hot dogs and fries??) the guy came out with an order and started calling for Stefanie, which is my wife's name.  My wife asked if I had given her name and I said no.  But then I thought maybe since we had paid for using her card it was our order and sure enough, it was.  Why do they ask for a name to use and then use a name for a card?  Really stupid I think.  Anyways, the guy gave us our order without a word and seemed a bit miffed that he had to call out the name several times (as if it was our fault or something).

The food itself was pretty good, nothing amazing.  The best part was definitely the poutine fries  which were covered in gravy, cheese and were just really good fries.  The food wasn't exactly hot though.  If the fries had been hot I think they'd have gone from pretty good to downright awesome but we will never know I suppose.  My wife enjoyed her polish hot dog and I enjoyed my chili cheese dog but again, just average food.  Neither the chili nor the hot dogs were memorable.

All in all this isn't a bad place if you are hungry and nearby, the prices are pretty good but the wait is too long for what you get, the food isn't anything special and the orders seem to come served with a bit of an attitude.

Fifteen minutes later there still no food, I decided to go back to the same counter guy and told him that it seems like the food is taking so long. He looked at my receipt and told me it's gonna be another 15 minutes. I told him that he must be kidding , because I've been waiting for a littlle bit more than 15 minutes, he looked at my receipt again and he said oh it was 16 mins ago, he asked someone in the kitchen and told me again IT IS GOING TO BE 15 minutes. I told him in the VERY FIRST PLACE he should have told me it is going to take that long, and after waiting for 15 minutes he was going to tell me its going to be another minutes? So its 30 minutes to get a chicken sandwhich? I was already impatient and I just asked for a refund, he told me to wait because his manager needs to do it. I was really pissed off about this, this is a fastfood restaurant, you were not told how long its gonna be while people ahead of you and some people after you already got their food, you asked for a refund yet you have to wait for a manager which was on the other side of the casino. I hate to say this but that is BS! I left because I was already hungry, some 25 minutes of my time wasted. My husband chose to stay to get the refund while I went to the other side of casino in starbucks to get a sandwhich and a drink. GAWD, I already have my frappuccino and a sandwhich in my hand when my husband called if I still want THAT sandwhich because it was just already made that time, that guy in the counter clearly has no proper training on how to understand a customer, we speak the same langguage - ENGLISH and I told him I dont want the sandwhich anymore because I cannot wait anymore I just wanted a refund. Anyways to those who plan to get something quick to eat in Treasure Island, do your self a favour. Go somewhere else & do not waste your time!

3706091,2017-10-08,2,yZnEwqTGpkrj_mga5zeZmQ,"Little Ritchie's was outside our poker tournament. After the tournament, we all decided to grab a bite to eat. I ordered the pastrami sandwich with pountine fries. I always wanted to try the pountine fries. 

My order came out and talk about a disappointment. The pastrami was horrible and was over cooked. It looked like pieces of bacon and not pastrami. It was dry and tasted down right gross. 

The pountine fries was not good at all. Very salty and down right sucked. I should have stuck to plain fries. 

I spoke with the employee about my
Sandwich and he said that's the way they
Make their sandwiches. I guess they are known for crappy pastrami sandwiches. 

Don't waste your time with Richies. It was a total waste of my $. The only reason for one star was for the Diet Pepsi.",dRlCuMNkUiMI0H7mclOSBA,2,0,1,0AOmvYJ3Nunrs8f7Zklmxg

I went with the beef combo based on other Yelper's suggestion, and it looked/tasted fantastic. Even though it's expensive, the polish sausage with beef really hit the spot, with just the right portion. Better yet it goes well wonderfully with whatever sports you watch at the sports book.

Try to avoid peak hours (regular dining hours, drunk people, hungover people) as it can be a little bit of a wait.",tGvJAy7uzAHJsPneHxd_rQ,1,0,4,tHjLxrC5C_WFNT6VQOge4g

The reason why it didnt get 5 stars is because of the lackluster fries. Fountain sodas were typical line up. Also this restaurant was kind of shoved in the corner of the casino so I was lucky to stumble upon it. Try it for yourself.,PSiXU2Fqc7EDZB6s5Exj6A,0,0,4,F1LcqffwQfmlSo5aSpY-tA

The service was quick and the person who took our order was very friendly. You order at the counter and then pickup a little further down.

I ordered an Italian Sausage and Poutine. The sausage and roll it came on were both solid. With a little mustard, I was happy with them. The poutine was fairly good. The fries comes topped with cheese curds, bacon and gravy. It is a good sized portion.

They got rid of the table seating and there's a poker room there now...wth!   My friends and I were in a hurry to grab some food and this was literally the only dining option available at treasure island.  I really think TI is in need of hiring a new director of food and beverage because the restaurant selections at the hotel are so bad it's not even funny.  Anyway, I wanted something quick and easy so I went ahead and got a chili cheese hot dog with coleslaw on the side.  The dog was wrapped in some funny plastic sheet so when I was ready to eat the darn thing it was super soggy and nasty.  I ended up just using a knife and fork to assault my food.  The hot dog itself tastes like any store bought, mass produced amalgamation of meats.  The chili didn't taste that well and I wouldn't be surprised if it came out of a bag.  Coleslaw was surprisingly refreshing and good.  I tried some of their house cut fries and they were nicely done!  If you want eat something quick at TI, avoid this place and go to that pizzeria near the self parking garage or just walk across to the fashion mall's food court.",MuhUC0v3qBBTj6D2DO0H_w,0,0,2,7hUW_XsS2Zu2KLBYR1QSiw
