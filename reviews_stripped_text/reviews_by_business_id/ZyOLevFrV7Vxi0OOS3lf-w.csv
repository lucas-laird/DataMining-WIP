I ended up giving them a chance after they were open for a few days and have been back probably ten times now in their first few weeks of business. Their omelettes have become a morning staple when I'm starting work, and for lunch I'll take their spinach and walnut salad with balsamic over anything up the street at skinny fats.

Fork and Burger is a hidden little place in the middle of a business park.  They serve breakfast and lunch to the lucky ones who find it. It's quaint dining area is kept clean for their patrons. Service from the gentleman working the front was friendly and so helpful.  His genuine smile is a sure warm welcome.

I walked in for a lunch treat.  Treat indeed.  They posted their burger of the month on the wall and it definitely caught my eye.  The Resolution Buster Burger.  Im intrigued!  2 Angus beef patties, 2 slices cheese, 4 slices of bacon and LTO.  If you're rubbing you eyes to see if you read that right, you did!  FOUR slices of bacon.  The thick pieces of bacon topped the juicy burger like a cherry on top.  Delicious.  

I have to mention the mound of sweet potato fries served on the side of my giant sandwich.  My eyes grew a little bigger as I ogled this lovely side.  They were perfect and crisp.

Tucked away just West of the Strip is Fork & Burger. This is a modern day small railroad diner or corner cafe from back in the olden days, no frills, just a few updated menu items and very bright decor. When I came here, this place was filled with suits, hard hats, and a crew of chatty secretaries, definitely the local hot spot for the surrounding business park.  

Wraps, omelets, deli sandwiches, breakfast sandwiches, salads, adult sized PB&J, and of course burgers... America! I went with the burger of the month, ""The Pizza Burger"" fully equipped with homemade marinara sauce, smothered in mozzarella cheese and topped with fried pepperonis, fork yeah! This burger was just plain delicious, the patty was cooked to a perfect medium rare and the red sauce had a great spicy kick. Sorry ketchup, but you've been replaced when it came to dunking my sweet potato fries. 

This is a great place for a lunch meeting or just a straight-up lunch. The customer service is great and they update their social media with weekly and monthly specials constantly, so follow them for a tasty heads up.

4052499,2017-02-08,8,ZyOLevFrV7Vxi0OOS3lf-w,"Fork & Burger!

5 stars just for the name alone.  I bookmarked this place after reading Bethany E's stellar review a few weeks ago.  I knew it was just a matter of time when I would finally get my fork into one of their burgers.  I specifically wanted January's Burger of the Month, which is two patties, 4 thick slices of bacon, cheese, lettuce, tomato, and onions.  Fork & Burger named this burger the Resolution Buster Burger because it's high in calorie, high in fats, and well worth cheating on your weight-loss New Year resolution.  I don't do resolutions.  So, it's all good.  

I just dined here today and since it's no longer January, the burger is no longer on the menu. I knew that F&B couldn't resist my charm and made one for me any way.  Heck, it doesn't hurt to ask, right?  The burger is stacked, very delicious, and worth every extra minute of cardio that I have to do tonight.  At only $12.50, this beast of a burger is a deal.  The thick pieces of bacon are strategically placed between each patty and cheese, which means bacon & cheese on every bite.   

Fork & Burger's menu consist of burgers (of course), sandwiches, breakfast, and salads.  Everything on their menu seems to be priced just right or better.  I look forward to coming back for their breakfast, the patty melt, and their other specialty burgers.  Fork & Burger may not be Yelp famous yet. But they have been recognized by Yelp HQ as a business with a 4.5 star average.  I'm so glad that I was working in the area today.  Fork & Burger is good As Fork!!  

TIP #1:  Located off Valley View & Post.  
TIP #2:  Look for their Burger of the Month
TIP #3:  The Sloppy Jack (Turkey, Pepper Jack Cheese, & FB Sauce) is their signature burger
TIP #4:  They deliver.  Check out their website for restrictions. 
TIP #5:  Churro pancakes and fresh baked cookies at F&B
TIP #6:  They supply outlets and cables to charge your phones.

4991098,2018-01-23,0,ZyOLevFrV7Vxi0OOS3lf-w,"Fork & Burger is located in a fairly industrial warehouse area.  It's tucked inside the plaza and is facing south, so you won't see it at all from Decatur.  If you're looking for the place, keep on driving in and it'll be there.

The interior decor is fairly basic, but gets the job done.  I really like how they have some counter height seats with phone chargers.  I seriously needed some juice and the plugs definitely helped out.

Food: I had the Egg and Avo, and a fresh squeeze OJ.  There was a sign on the menu saying the Egg and Avo can sub chicken for beef.  I asked the cashier which was better, she said she never had the beef and really couldn't tell me.  I opted for the original chicken.  The burger came out OK.  It was a decent size, but the egg was a bit over cooked and chicken was close to dry.  They served those really puffy frozen fries, so nothing to be excited about there.  The OJ tasted good, but it was room temp.  Maybe my issue, but I like my OJ chilled.  Perhaps they can stick the OJ's in the fridge?

Service: I only encountered the cashier, so this may not reflect all employees.  Seriously, she had absolutely no enthusiasm at all.  She was nice, but every word was monotonous and I could tell that she did not want to be there.  

Overall, there's not many burger choices in the area, so this is really it if you want a burger.  The burger was decent, but nothing to crave for.  Service was meh.",2JDWKHpR0g4QA4MHmFDprg,1,0,3,ajWDUw7SdZbiAn1fjpY4Xg

I stopped into Fork And Burger this week while driving through on business. I can't say anything else except WOW!! What a find!! I had an omelette with the fresh squeezed juice and it was perfect!! Exactly the way I wanted. 

I have been told by some co workers that this used to be a different eatery. Many of my co workers hadn't gone yet.  I changed that!!! I brought a few of us 2 days later and got the cheesesteak. It was exactly what I was hoping. Thin meat and melted cheese served with choice of sides. ( I had the cucumbers. ) All of my local co workers thoroughly enjoyed their meal and are happy to report they have found a new local haunt!! 

Kudos to the super hospitable staff. I can't wait to see the business flourish. Go small businesses!!! Wishing every success!! Can't wait to come back !!",Xu-QnevgdiABDtDhCFLwmA,1,0,5,VAAO_5C5dwGTyRjq51CgTQ
