865195,2014-08-01,0,TNjlLA1DdH75TX_J_XQSRw,"We decided to try this place based on the Yelp reviews. I have to say that it did not disappoint. We had a small chorizo pizza and a small Hawaiian pizza and mango batidos (shakes). The pizza dough was light and airy. The sauce subtle, the cheese and toppings plentiful and tasty. The shakes creamy and delicious. (If you have never tried a Cuban batido, you are truly missing out. They are not as sweet as a regular shake, but they are delicious).  

I should mention that they only sell whole pies, not pizza by the slice.

We also tried the pastelitos de guayaba (guava and cheese filled flaky pastry). Also very tasty.  Just an FYI, the menus are in Spanish, and the pastries are located in the back, you have to ask for them. Don't worry if you don't speak Spanish, the staff speaks English.

The place is tiny, but very bright inside and super clean. It is located in a small strip mall next to the Cuban used car dealer. There was no sign out front, you have to turn into the parking lot to find it. I have to admit that we did drive past it, and only found it when we used our GPS. They are across the street from Marketon if that helps.

They have only been open for three months, but while we were there, a steady stream of customers came in, a lot of them repeat customers.

We will definitely be back to try some of their other pizzas and shakes.",6VU0rNcA03q5ef2s_sLKXg,2,1,5,Je44-U1LkIkhfPGnU7oKIw

2016939,2015-06-30,1,TNjlLA1DdH75TX_J_XQSRw,"I didn't know Cuban pizza was a ""thing"" but apparently it is. And it's decently good. A touch greasier than usual, with a slightly denser dough and a buttery crust, I would almost liken it to Little Caesars style. 

Pizzas come in two sizes, indicated as CH(?) and G (grande?)- the smaller of the two is generally $6 with the larger size closer to $8.50. The small is a bargain, as it easily feeds two. Toppings available here include roasted red pepper, pepperoni, ham and pineapple, shrimp, and chorizo. The chorizo is my pick, chopped small but distributed well, salty but not too greasy. 

Service does not speak English, so go in prepared to use hand gestures as needed if you don't speak Spanish. Menu also offers Cuban coffees (cortado seems to be the favorite) and various pastries and cakes. Check the ""tips"" on the app, as the Yelp page hours are currently inaccurate.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,3,3,3,hO1xyAlz7TyJXXXPkkEVww
2029950,2014-07-12,0,TNjlLA1DdH75TX_J_XQSRw,"My husband and I visited for lunch as part of our ""Team Lara Saturday"". 

Cuban Sylvain Bakery is tucked away in a strip mall on the north side of Tropicana. The parking lot is small but parking is ample. Inside are four high boy tables with stools and a small bartop, making seating for just about 12. As such, it seemed most of the orders were to go. 

Let me get this out: this is not, by any means, a fancy place. It's straightforward - menu, tables, and pizza and very fair prices. 

Like the ambiance, the menu is focused: small and large pizzas ranging from $5-$12 with mostly pork-centric toppings (chorizo, ham, or Hawaiian) and a selection of Cuban beverages, including shakes. As far as bakeries go, the pastry selection seemed limited, but they do offer cakes and a few desserts. 

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cuban-sylvain-bakery-las-vegas?filter_by_userid=True&select=pibdh3ESU8EMzTIJ-DPZcQ&userid=5DFshFQlbQiQTvtzH7qwlA#RQzwp3EDKtwkBrt3tpqoEA

Now, what makes a Cuban pizza, you ask? My extensive *cough* GOOGLE *cough* research leads me to understand the following:

1. The crust is puffier.
2. The cheese used is a blend of mozzarella and gouda.
3. The toppings are baked IN to the pizza (meaning crust, sauce, toppings, AND THEN cheese)

All that said, at $13 for two small pizzas (one pepperoni and one ham), a Malta (AKA instant diabetes with 36g sugar 58g carbs), and a bottle of water, I'm satisfied. What stood out for me was the crust, which was definitely puffier, but not at all doughy. It was like a pizza crust had a baby with a loaf of Cuban bread and happiness happened for all. It was well baked and had a lovely cheesy crispiness on the edges. Clearly, from my photo, the the toppings were baked on top, but that's fine with me. We ate the pepperoni pizza on site and it was served straight out of the oven. The ham pizza was devoured upon our return home. I have to say, it was just as good a little cold as it allowed for the flavors of the sauce, crust, and jam to become more pronounced. Also, the jam was far more generously topped. The plan, next time, is to try the onion pizza as it seemed a popular selection among those who ordered after us.

El lugar es acogedor, pequeño pero muy bien decorado, realmente te hace sentir en algún lugar de cuba, la comida en esta ocasión optamos por pizzas, con sabor excelente muy bien cocidas y con un estilo que hace recordar a la pizza cubana, ahora el lugar no tiene un menú impreso, al llegar y preguntar por el menú se nos dijo que teníamos que mirar la pantalla ahí miras hacia arriba y tienes que esperar que llegue al menú de pizzas y obviamente escoger rápido porque la pantalla no se detiene, así que quien tenga intenciones de pedir mucha variedad lleve lápiz y papel.... otra cosa que a mi entender le resta calidad al lugar (Es mi valoración muy personal) es que todo es servido en platos y con cubiertos desechables, que desde el punto de vista higiénico esta perfecto, pero desde el punto de vista estético y práctico le quita puntos al lugar , comer una pizza que no está picada (slice ) con un cuchillo y tenedor plástico resulta algo no confortable a los comensales...y por último el carisma de la chica que nos atendió que la verdad no fue el mejor pero esto es muy subjetivo así que en nuevas visitas al lugar veremos si es su forma habitual de tratar al público o simplemente tenía un mal día.. porque todos tenemos derecho a tener un mal Día somos seres humanos...",lk5bUln6amhl62xeKyZbKg,0,0,3,r6Ka1WMoOAwR5ynONbM2Ig

2263322,2014-10-20,3,TNjlLA1DdH75TX_J_XQSRw,"I've only tried Cuban pizza twice and both times were in Las Vegas. It's a shame I never ate it growing up in south Florida, but my parents usually ordered Little Caesar's. I enjoyed the pizza at Cuban Sylvain Bakery much more than the one at Roly's Bakery just down the street. 

The pizza de ají was baked to order, arriving hot and topped with pieces of roasted red pepper. I really liked the thick, buttery crust and the way the cheese was baked all the way to the edge of the pan so it became crispy. A small pie costs around $6 and feeds two average-sized appetites. A shot of Cuban coffee was rich and flavorful, with sugar served on the side to sweeten to personal preference. The only disappointment was a guava cream cheese pastry. While they do bake pastelitos in house, a sliver of cream cheese the size of a pat of butter as filling was not proportional to the size of the turnover.

The hours listed on Yelp are wrong. I think they are open every day from 10am-8pm and closed Wednesday but already submitted corrections to Yelp and then I forgot.",PSI7wvuqEhhV9Jh_fP2eZQ,5,3,3,gLBfhGNKKgieVh0VVVQjKw
