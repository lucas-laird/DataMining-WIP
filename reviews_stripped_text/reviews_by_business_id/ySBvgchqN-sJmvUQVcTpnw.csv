1340242,2018-05-18,0,ySBvgchqN-sJmvUQVcTpnw,"Del Taco is a little different than other fast food chain. Aside from burgers, tacos, nachos, and quesadilla, they have better savory options like their Pollo Asado Avocado Fresca Bowl and Chicken Verde Wet Burrito Plato. For a healthier alternative, they have Avocado Veggie Fresca Bowl and a good selection of Handcrafted Salad like their Signature Taco and Mexican Chopped Salad. This particular one is in the University Plaza, it's on the corner of East Tropicana and Maryland Parkway. I like how it's so convenient, it's right next to Vons and there's a good amount of parking space. The downside is that dining in is not 24/7 so when it's passed 11pm, you'd have to go to the drive thru to order your meal. Sometimes it can be a bit of a wait when there's a convoy of night owls and an after party crowd. But when I'm at the drive thru they're real nice about making sure my order is right. 

I don't think I'll ever stop being a fan of their Macho Crinkle Cut Fries ($2.79). When I order they serve my fries hot, well-done, extra crispy, no salt, and that's how I like it. Personally I like the mild salsa, it's all that's needed to give it a little spiciness. If you want to fancy it up, you can opt for the Deluxe Chili Cheddar Fries. Usually I always go for their Epic Chipotle Chicken Avocado Burrito ($5.69). It comes as a big tortilla wrap with tender grilled chicken, rice, seasoned black beans, pico de gallo, fresh avocado slice, and that creamy chipotle sauce. It really is an EPIC burrito, they don't skimp on the ingredients, the portions are generous, it's fulfilling and very tasty. For sweet cravings, they make strawberry and chocolate milkshakes, I've tried the cinnamon churros and their caramel cheesecake bites are serve hot and crunchy. But one thing I have a weakness for is their good old-fashioned Chocolate Chip Cookies, you get 3 for $1.89, it's a reasonable price and I would always buy extra for a gratifying midnight snack.",dpvR4LYXr0CYHtHf8BeCKg,0,0,4,UnwKr3UmWSycMy4shrXwZw

The menu board advertised $1 drinks, with plato purchase, in two different places.  Ordered beverage but was told by order taker, Felipe, that he was unaware of $1 drinks. I took a picture of both places the menu board advertised and showed Felipe upon arriving at the window. He again stated that he didn't know how to charge for it on the register.  I asked for a manager and was told there was not one working. He reiterated not having a way to charge for it, asking, ""what am I supposed to do?""  I offered that good customer service would at minimum be an apology and give the customer a fountain drink until he figured out what button to push. He did nothing to remedy their error. Sad that Del Taco doesn't empower their employees to make judgment calls in the name of customer service. 

2 stars given was for the food, it was tasty, but poor customer service trumped getting higher rating.",WXuyC8C3szmJ_b8Lvx5S3A,1,0,2,S6wH3oJJsIj-upKLzn3t9g

I usually always brown bag it for lunch at work, but today I ended up at work empty stomached and empty handed.  I planned on picking up a pre-made salad at Vons, but there was major police action happening outside and inside the market.  Uhhhh, maybe another time...

I haven't had any fast food in months and months, but seemed to remember noticing that Del Taco had added fish tacos to the menu - which is great because I don't eat meat or fowl.  Luckily, there's a Del Taco conveniently located in the same shopping mall.

The drive-thru staff were perky and friendly.  On to the tacos - the battered and fried fish with cabbage slaw and salsa fresca were wrapped in corn tortillas and actually pretty darn yummy.  The fries were kind of meh - but I tend to like fries slightly overdone with some crunch. 

Overall, great place in a pinch.",KFWOn7x19RmrO6kzTJYmrQ,2,1,4,7ikmRWPO7GRuznXvDIFcAA

Once I moved forward he finally told me what my total was and I paid for the food. Then once he gave me my food he closed the window.

When I got the total I asked why so much.  The guy told me it was 40 cents per taco for the tomato.  Even though I didn't get cheese (which is way more per pound than tomatoes).The taco only cost 99 cents and I got no cheese or sauce.  So they charge 40 cents per taco for 1 tablespoon of tomato (that is a charge of $26.00 per pound for tomatoes) .  WHAT A RIP OFF  I hope that the $1.60 extra was worth it because I will NEVER eat at a Del Taco again for that reason.  I would have given zero stars if I could because when I got home there were no tomatoes on the tacos.  If I wasn't so tired from work I would have gone back there and threw the tacos in the drive thru window.  I will more than make up for the $1.60 rip off in the near future, lets just say that it is going to cost them a lot more LOLOLOLOL",s0RnqdmL6tObfdke8BIqlA,0,0,1,DM0VhuXF0rvTdTsA5BU4EA

I do like me some wonderful Del Taco for quick, cheap eats on the go. Not the healthiest option in town...but oh well...shhh..stuff happens..

My recent visit to this particular location turned into a comedy of errors rather quickly..

""Welcome to Del Taco, can I take your order.""

""Yes, I'd like 3 chicken soft tacos with no lettuce, 1 mini quesadilla, and 2 Diet Cokes."" ...(Yes, yes...I don't want to hear it about the Diet Coke lol)

""What was that?""

""Hold on a second.""

""Welcome to Del Taco, can I take your order.""

""It's still me and I would STILL like 3 chicken soft tacos with no lettuce, 1 mini quesadilla, and 2 Diet Cokes.""

""ok. pull forward""

Damn. That was exhausting!

I get to the window and the first thing that happens is some dude pops out of the window and says, ""No lettuce on those chicken soft tacos, right?""

""Um, no.""

....

About 2 long, awkward minutes pass and a girl shows up at the window and collects my money. I got my food and it did the trick...but damn! I felt like I was starring in a sitcom or something!

What in the blue hell just happened??

I like Del Taco, but this is NOT one of their better locations. The people seem nice enough, but appeared to have great difficulty pulling their heads out of their rectal cavity long enough to complete the taxing assignment of getting my 3 chicken soft tacos with no lettuce, 1 mini quesadilla, and 2 Diet Cokes.
