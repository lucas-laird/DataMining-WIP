I stopped in for dinner with family and tried a few dishes including the Mtabal Baba Bhanoush (appetizer) and ordered the Shwarma Plate.  The Mtabal Baba Bhanoush ($8.50) is basically grilled eggplant mashed with garlic, lemon and sesame oil served with fresh baked pita bread.  The Pita Bread here is delicious, we recieved a basket of hot and puffy pita with the appetizer.  I had the Lamb Shawarma Plate ($16.50) and it was served with VERY generous portions of sliced grilled lamb and rice, also included tomatoes, onions, pickles and shawarma sauce. The shawarma sauce is listed on menu as a Tahini sauce, it was very creamy tahini.  The entire meal was very delicious and flavorful.  

The menu has a lot to choose from and includes a large variety of gluten free and vegetarian dishes. I'll be back to try a few other items including their salad and kabob menus.",uLp2Rz4Jpy4FA3NsTnOZ6A,0,1,5,uz0ml2hegS7Xb3NacgHfoQ

The restaurant is certainly pretty and there is truly not a bad table in the place.  They are thoughtfully spaced so that a private conversation is possible.  The service is also excellent.  Our server, Fanie, was very pleasant and seemed genuinely committed to our needs.  The cuisine was excellent and fresher than fresh.  I always measure a Mediterranean restaurant by its hummus and pita bread.  We started with the Jalapeño Hummus which was creamy and flavorful.  It was not hot, but had just the right touch of jalapeño.  The pita was light and puffy.  We also shared a Lebanese salad of tomatoes, cucumbers and red onions, lightly dressed in a minty lemon juice dressing.  It was very fresh and as good as it was on its own, would be a perfect accompaniment to any of the entrees.  We shared a Lebanese sandwich of ground lamb and spices.  It had an interesting savory sweet flavor going on and was quite delicious. The fries were very tasty, too.  Finally, Fanie treated us to an order of baklava.  As full as I was, this was the perfect ending to our meal.  It was sweet but not overly so.

The 2 kabobs were tiny dried up pieces of chicken and ""filet mignon"" beef, which had an unpleasant odor, put on a skewer with similar ""veggie"" pieces.  Kafta was a tiny burned piece of ground meat equally dry and tasteless.  Even the rice was really bad and was ""garnished' with a single broccoli floret. I saw the pita being baked in the oven but it was tough, dry and tasteless as well.  I am from middle east and know what this food should taste like and this was definitely not it, not even close.

I've turned my entire family onto to khoureys and whenever we crave middle eastern food this is where we go. Compared to many other Middle Eastern restaurants in town you without a doubt get more food for your money. For example the kabob meal comes with 3 kabobs, salad or soup and rice!

Their lunch specials are well priced: $10 for a small entree (my guy likes the stuffed cabbage rolls) with a choice of side (their hummus is great!) and pita bread. Their bread is noteworthy because it's made fresh in house, super-soft and chewy.

She then told me that I was her last order (9:30p on a Saturday night when they close at 10p) and that she should have been off 45 mins ago. I laughed but in my head thinking why would you ever tell the customer this? I still tipped about 15% but then realized she left and never even finished the order.

2457309,2018-05-13,0,HsEStDB_LB6x0LuXQ6LP4A,"Eating here took me back in time, to when I spent 2yrs in the Middle East! 

The Good: Menu choices! Right down to Beverages, especially non-alcoholic Bev's. I'm talking about Mint Lemonade and a variety of hot teas plus Turkish Coffee! We got a Mint Lemonade and I was instantly transferred back to Kuwait. They brought out some puffy bread with some Olive Oil and Cracked Peppers- delicious!! The quality of the food was great!! The Khourys Salad, was just as tangy from Lemon juice, as I hoped!! My husband got the Fattouch salad with Gyro Meat- he LOVED IT! I ordered the Combo Kabob plate. This was evening, **which matters because portion & price change for Lunch and dinner**

The Negative: Why am I deducting a star? For one, the menu stated that the lunch serving size for kabobs were 2, dinner was 3 with the choice of Salad or Soup. I was looking forward to getting Tabouleh salad. But it was about $2 extra to switch the salad option. I thought I had a choice, but apparently you only get a choice for lunch. The Combo Kabob plate gives you 3 skewers of your choice of meat ($21.95 for Dinner), yet when I asked for 1 skewer to be the Lamb, it was a $2 upgrade. When I finally got my dish, the rice was cold. But that didn't bother me so much because I wasn't going to completely eat all the rice. What DID bother me, was that for $23 I got 3 skewers (Chicken, Beef, Lamb) with only 3 small to medium chunks of meat, with grilled veggies in between. Only 3 pieces of meat per skewer! I have been to many Mediterranean restaurants and all their skewers were filled with meat and the grilled veggies (onion, tomatoes, peppers) were on the side WITH HUMMUS. This dish did not come with Hummus, they did add a small amount of Cucumber Yogurt dip (which was tasty). Honestly, for a $23 diah, there should be leftovers of meat. There wasn't. They trick your eyes by putting veggies in between. The food itself was delicious. We also ordered fries on the side- because learning this was a Lebanese restaurant, we have had the BEST french fries in Lebanon! But these were disappointing. They were limp, no crispiness whatsoever. Their Garlic Sauce was on point though! As far as Ambiance goes, i felt it was too bright in there and also that they seat you very close to other people. They probably want to deal with one area, but I could literally hear the conversation at the table next to us while the rest of the place was empty (cuz this was around 10pm). 

But I would definitely be back and would take advantage of their happy hour or lunch menu. But I would not order the Kebab Combo plate for dinner again, Because the portion size does not justify the cost.  Service was good. Loved the music.",CBWiAM9pP6w4Jg-PoeV2rg,2,0,4,zwsjeixN0_Glq2T3gyczwA

2477791,2016-06-07,0,HsEStDB_LB6x0LuXQ6LP4A,"Since our former neighbors worked there, my partner suggested that we give them a shot the first time, while they were in the old location. When we did, the food was outstanding, very reminiscent of a small chain of places we used to frequent back in Arlington, Virginia, called Lebanese Taverna.

Alas, although the food was more than up to snuff, the service left a lot to be desired.

Not so for our 'return' to the new location, I am happy to report. And the food hasn't taken even the slightest dip in quality. It's always a thrill to be able to sit sipping wine or some other drinks, and watch while the out-of-this-world fresh pita bread is made, rolled out and baked in their wood-fired stone oven, and then served hot with oil and spices. Surpassed only when you dip it into the tasty hummus, baba ganoush and cucumber-and-yogurt mix that we could just have as a meal unto itself. But then there would be no room for the spinach Ftayir or the Samboosak, both highly recommended apps.

Our last trip for the main course, Bear had the Meat Combo, while I opted for the Lebanese Sandwich (aka ""Lahm Bi Ajeen""), which was a pleasant surprise. It certainly changed my expectations of what a sandwich can be, or what as an American, I am used to seeing - heavy with meat and some veggies and lots of condiments. This was airy, light and plenty flavorful with ground lamb, spices and the fresh tomatoes and chopped onions. I would have it again in a heartbeat.

As a matter of fact, I have even suggested that we could now make it a habit of coming back to Khoury's at least twice a month on a regular basis. The food, though healthy as all get-out for you, doesn't taste like 'diet' food, and it's satisfying, but doesn't leave you feeling bloated. I wasn't surprised to see the number of people coming in just for take-out orders. If they were closer to us (we're in Summerlin), I have no doubt we'd do a lot more business with them, than just ordering burgers or pizza.

Whenever you're in the Village Square vicinity, I would enthusiastically recommend checking them out! Two thumbs WAY UP from this guy!",_Mz4d66zzJUX830jTwCgIQ,2,0,5,MKPAWdI7_MTQcRjqmg757g
2565793,2018-06-08,0,HsEStDB_LB6x0LuXQ6LP4A,"This may be the best Mediterranean (Lebanese) food in town. Sometimes the simple things make the difference between good food and great food. Khoury's hits all the marks for great food.

Fresh, top-notch ingredients stand out in every dish. Tabbouleh is made as it should be made, with abundant parsley, mint and lemon with just enough bulgur to soak up the tangy, refreshing  dressing. The tabbouleh & hummus are worth the trip alone, as are the fresh from the oven pillows of pita served with olive oil & za'atar  for dipping. 

You won't go wrong with any of the beef or lamb dishes, but vegetarians won't feel like second class citizens here. The extensive menu has everything one expects to find in a Mediterranean restaurant plus a few wonderful surprises.  Everything is profoundly fresh, tasty and nicely presented.

The salad was presented on a bed of romaine leaves, which is okay and acts as a filler from plate up.  The salad was by no means how they pictured it on the Mezza pictures.  
     There was hardly a breath of crack wheat used, a fine grind can make it hard to find in a salad, and tomatoes were finely chopped but covered by what looked liked grass clippings(parsley). The dressing had just a hint of lemon.  They serve sliced lemon with the plate to kick up the lemon flavoring if you like.  The bread served, was not fresh and already began drying out. 
     I took the olive oil and zartar spice for dipping the bread and poured it over the tabbouleh which helped with some well needed table salt made it far more enjoyable. (Hedary's down the street does a way better tabbouleh that comes out ready flavored and does have cracked wheat that can be seen.  I think they use a medium grind.).  
   Khoury's  recipe is certainly unique in that I found no mint nor cucumber nor green onion. The cost for this bowl, was $9.95 a little pricey for what's not in it.  I have made Tabbouleh a zillion times and can state for $9.95 you can make a HUGE bowl to feed a lot of people.  Today I just did not want to make a Huge bowl and left the work to some where else and can say it was a disappointing adventure.  
    There is a lot of staff working there and I think probably a big overhead shifted to the food costs is why something so inexpensive to make is pricey...I overheard a waiter tell some guests that a shot of Vodka for their drink was $8.00 and I'm thinking well vodka for $8.00 a bit much???...Oh well...The life of Lebanese food in this town will one day fall into the right hands and we will have a champion that will offer value,flavor and hope in this desert town!

Which isn't too long, except for the fact that people who sat after us had their drinks. That left us plenty of time to peruse the menu. There was a Valentine's special. For a 4 course meal for 2 for $49.95. But looking through the regular menu we saw the same ""deal"" for $39.95. Hmmm, ok. Didn't like seeing that mark up at all.
We finally ordered and got our food in a decent amount of time. Redeeming quality of the restaurant is the food. Everything was really good!  Next time we come here it will ONLY be for take out.",_PBt-xzQvgGjdDzJL_dr4Q,0,0,3,is0huin1OxrYbpgRu8_Jlw

After a movie at Village Square I recommended Khoury's to friends...MY BAD. First of all, the server was overwhelmed and, of course, the service was very slow and inept.....not the server's fault. She was working very hard given her circumstances.
Despite the slow service, we had a great time(I'll get to the food later). We watched this scruffy middle aged man, in shorts and Tee shirt, smooch some famliar tables. We hilariously determined that he was the owner/manager....great entertainment!!!!
So...the food...
I would have not taken the time to write this review if I wasn't embarrassed by my recommendation and if our Lamb Shawarma tasted as I experienced on our previous visits.
My Lamb Shawarma could only be described as Lamb Jerky, Rice, and Tomatoes...

They offer several dishes without meat (vegetarian). Their meat grapes leaves have a great flavor but they are the size of my ring finger. I have never in any other mediterranean restaurant seen grape leaves the small. Their cabbage roles are the same.  Literally the size of your finger.

The moussaka is very different than any other I have EVER had.  It is basically (dinner portion) two slices of eggplant with meat on top and then a marinara. It is clearly not baked in a casserole and topped with a cream & cheese based (béchamel).  

This restaurant has been around for some time (even if this location is new). Many people in the area really like it but at the same time I don't think many people have had a lot of mediterranean options to know the difference.

She asked us if we had a reservation, which we didn't, and seated us. It then took ten minutes (at least) for someone to come over to us and ask us for our drink order. We actually had to flag someone down. When the waitress came over, she apologized for the wait and was very friendly. Another waitress came over and told us that she completely forgot about us and also apologized. They were very sweet. 

The food was excellent. Everything came out hot and you could tell the ingredients were fresh. We did the $40 dinner for two and ordered the Greek and Khoury salads, the meat pies, beef kabob, baked chicken and baklava. The homemade pita bread and dipping oil were also delish.

For the entrée, I got the Chicken Shwarma plate with rice, tahini, and a jalepeño mint sauce.  It was pretty mouth-watering and tasty.  There portion was generous, enough for two meals, so I took a doggy bag home for another meal.

I ordered the grass fed lamb tenderloin kabob which included a house salad, pita and I added a cup of yummy lentil soup. The kabob contained bell peppers, tomato, mushrooms and was served over a bed of rice. I ended my meal with the suggested dessert of Shabiet  - which was delightful.

I don't think you all can see my response so I'm posting it on here as a follow up to my review.  I'm sooooo upset!  How does the owner state she is just a manager when we asked for the owner or manager?  How does the owner prefer to let a customer go and ""investigate"" what happened?  I have NEVER heard of such a thing, especially as I have restauranteur friends and they would NEVER allow a customer to leave unhappy.  Why ask for a phone number when they will NEVER call you?  Why not resolve the matter before the customer leaves?  These are questions that run through my head as I am appalled by Mariz's ownership skills in the restaurant business.
Mariz,
Telling us you're the manager and not stating you are the owner is definitely concerning.  Especially when you allowed us to walk out the door very dissatisfied with the customer service your server provided.  When we refused the dessert because we wanted to get out of there you FAILED to make things right.
If you had pride in good customer service you wouldn't have taken my number as you yet have ""called me back""  It doesn't take a week to figure out where your staff went wrong, especially when we indicated there was disrespect from your staff. 
 My review was placed because you allowed us to leave.  What business owner allows that?  I don't even think a trained restaurant manager would allow a customer to leave unsatisfied.  Understaffed is one thing, RUDE and ATTITUDE is another.  The fact that YOU, as the OWNER, did nothing speaks volumes.  VERY DISAPPOINTED and even if I thought of going back, now that you have done NOTHING in over a week demonstrates you would rather lose loyal customers than resolve TERRIBLE customer service.",GBco3mVxeCDix8FHNBW85w,0,0,1,WW1Tsidv6sV9P72LmDPAgQ

First of all - the fact that they have garlic sauce on the menu is INCREDIBLE - it's rarely found on restaurant menus so be sure and order extra. If you haven't had garlic sauce, do yourself a favor and get your booty over to Khoury's. It has the consistency of mayo, but there are no eggs in it. The only ingredients are garlic and olive oil, so if you're planning to make out with anyone, make sure they have some too. (Also, I have tried and failed to make this at home more times than I can count. Garlic sauce is a thing of beauty when it's done right.)

I've had many of the dishes here and they're all fab. 

There are only two things I don't love, so let's get to it, shall we?

1.) It's a little over-priced. I mean, look - it is the BEST middle eastern food in Vegas, I know...but like, also...Middle Eastern food is home cooking, not gourmet eating. Maybe I was spoiled growing up in Michigan where you couldn't swing a cat without hitting great hole-in-the-wall Arabic food, but the entree pricing seems about $4-6 too high.
2.) If you try and order on Postmates, there are only like 5 or 6 things available in the app. I don't know if this is because that's how they set it up on purpose, or if it's an accident, but I can say for CERTAIN that I would order delivery from them more often if the full menu was available. (The delivery company that's used on their website is awful, it's called Zuppler and the customer service is terrible.

I didn't even get to try the food here because the lady greeting me at the door had such a nasty demeanor instead of a smile she had a bitter look on her face. She asked if I was here to pick up food like as if I was there for some kind of a delivery service or something like that. When she found out I wasn't she had was all smiles and I find that absolutely in comprehensible. I had to explain to her that people that might do deliveries could actually be customers to so how you greet everybody matters. Any short don't come here don't waste your time I'm sure there's plenty of other good Creek options out there.,QKklJNxMq031Qlx0qdM8YQ,0,0,1,S8QzTdoRAFbFr9nBTVqvLg

We keep trying this place because the food is excellent (particularly their jalapeno hummus), but there is now little reason for us to come back. The service is terrible. Yesterday, there was only one waitress and at least 5-6 bussers, so you can imagine how thin her service was stretched. There were people trying to get her attention all around, so I felt for her. I understand that sometimes restaurants are understaffed. When she finally got around to us and took our order, we ordered the Shawarma Plate with Gyro meat, which we have ordered 2-3 times before with no problems.

When our food was brought out, it was chicken instead of gyro meat. We left it untouched and waited almost 10 minutes for the waitress to come check on us, and we let her know that our order was wrong. She spoke to me in a condescending voice and said that Shawarma is chicken, explained to me what gyro meat is (which I know), and we should have ordered the Gyro Plate. According to the menu, the Shawarma Plate can be ""lamb, chicken, OR gyro."" She didn't really acknowledge it as her mistake, even when we showed her in print that the menu says ""or Gyro."" When she brought out our correct order, she apologized and loudly exclaimed ""Here is your GYRO PLATE."" Well, there is no Gyro Plate on the menu, and I will reiterate that Khoury's Shawarma Plate advertises Gyro as one of the meat options. On top of all that, she never brought us drink refills after promising to do so, and I watched her bring drinks to other tables in the meantime.

Until they get their customer service together, which has been deplorable on previous visits as well, we will not be returning. It's really a shame because their food is so tasty, but I do not appreciate being talked down to when the waitress took our order down incorrectly.",OiJvwBK4Eu7vkARWx17ObQ,4,0,1,46ttVQOQvJUYnFCv1h8DDw

Definitely order a side of hummus for this amazing ness! I came for dinner with a big group of 8 so we ordered practically the entire menu haha 

Many appetizers to start, I highly suggest you go for whatever your eyes desire cause these little dishes are the best part of the meal! We had two kinds of salads, which I couldn't stop picking at to the end. They were topped with beautiful Roma tomatoes. For an entree we shared a ginormous meat platter with an assortment of chicken kabobs and delicious lamb. Ask for tatziki sauce because it blends in phenomenally well with the meats! Everything felt and tasted incredibly authentic",0_KCK9S9j5FhlY0Duf6Lrw,3,3,5,p5fYhXgO5iktG0WS-znOoA

There are quite a few options in the area, but my Husband absolutely loves Mediterranean food. I looked at their menu online and we were quickly sold when we saw their 4 course menu for 2 people for $42.

We started with jalapeno hummus, which was really delicious. Then I had the house salad and my Hubby had the greek salad. Their house dressing is so good! We both ended up getting the gyro platter and were definitely not disappointed. Everything was piping hot and obviously very fresh. The portions were huge and everything (especially the rice!) was really yummy. We shared dessert (I don't remember the name, but it was different and very good).

Our server was very helpful and friendly. I got a glass of wine and my hubs had an iced tea and our total bill was less than $50. Overall, we were really impressed and found ourselves wishing they had a location closer to home in Henderson. Next time we are in the area, I definitely see us going back.",rKkpHJkJ27xOwnhy_bMkvA,0,1,4,R95-nQfL5won9k86LksZZQ

However, ever since they moved locations...it has been a nightmare. I've have dined in and have done take out...the last time I dined in with my family was a few months ago-there were 5 of us and the restaurant was dead. It took 20 minutes to take our order. 15 minutes for the drinks to come, and over an hour for the food.  They have amazing pita bread and the waitress was unwilling to bring more as we were waiting for our food. Overall, a terrible dining experience.  Today I called in an order...she told me 25 minutes. I waited 30 minutes before I left the house thinking it would be ready. I got there and she said the food was ready but she just needed to bag the bread.  Well 30 minutes later she accomplished bagging the bread and all of the food was cold. The fries were cold and no microwave could revive them. No apologies, nothing. The back up for carry out was atrocious behind me.  I wish the 5 people behind me the best of luck. Hopefully they didn't order the fries.

Also a man in front of me obviously had surgery on his foot...the girl came out balancing multiple bags of pita bread to transfer to him for a balancing act....and then asks, ""would you like a bag?"" I didn't think she would have to ask, in fact she should have offered to take it to his car-idiotic",IPlLcdNG426qOopHH4EwkQ,6,0,1,byhfTXcLfIN8EHMgbOt1hA

Family friendly and caring. Definitely have recommended this place to multiple people so far and not one has been disappointed. Even had their catering at a few events and everything is so spot on.

I always eat a Greek salad which is one of my favorite items along with gyro meat or the chicken kabab.

The kids love the gyro's and the gyro plates.  They have changed up the kids menu since moving so be sure to take notice that dessert is no longer included.

As of 2/26/16 I noticed that they are now able to serve alcohol.

I yelped Khoury's Mediterranean Restaurant and the reviews were not only positive, there were tons of them!  I emailed Khoury's a ""pre-order"" list and when I followed up with a phone call, I was able to get the pricing right away.  There wasn't any beating around the bush so that was helpful.  We connected the day of the order to confirm the delivery, which was awesome.  The food was delivered on time, the gal that delivered the food even helped us carry the food to the 2nd level.

We would definitely eat at Khoury's again!  We ordered the family catering of chicken, falafel, rice and salad.  The Falafel was a bit dry but everything else was so good!",-mfxkaJCYrsVn8pyMuIClA,0,0,4,8V_1P5XC-DKz3JTL_m9qjQ
5902337,2017-07-29,2,HsEStDB_LB6x0LuXQ6LP4A,"We came here because it was convenient, having just walked out of Settebello a few doors away.  Because we had already had drinks and a taste of the awful pizza there, we weren't all that hungry, so we decided to stick with shawarma sandwiches - lamb for me, chicken for Mr. Cluck, 9.95 each.  Even so, we were served a basket of warm, puffy pita with some olive oil/balsamic for dipping.

Our server was Simi, a delightful young woman from Israel, who couldn't have been nicer, and didn't betray any annoyance that we were ordering so little.    

I loved that we were able to substitute salad, rice or broccoli at no extra charge, and we both went with salad.  It was a large portion, but simple - just romaine, tomato, cucumber and some seasoning, accompanied by a lemony vinaigrette.

The sandwiches were excellent, and we were given cups of extra tahini to put on them.  The pita had that extra bit of crispness around the edges that makes a sandwich great, and we both enjoyed our meals.

Khoury's is a large place, with cloth napkins and tablecloths covered with paper.  Only the lighting - too much, in my opinion - prevents me from thinking of this as an upscale place.  A little dimness would add megawatts to the atmosphere.

When one door closes, another opens.  In this case, you can take that literally.",m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,6,3,4,9iSGdqItl8JlUE-eaDzwcQ
5911026,2016-04-03,1,HsEStDB_LB6x0LuXQ6LP4A,"I stopped in for an early dinner on the weekend. The dining area was spacious and clean with a touch of sophistication without losing its casual feel. The service was great throughout the meal and our server answered every question I had without hesitation.

I ordered the house Mezza which consisted of several small plates and fresh from the oven pita bread. Even though it's a little pricy ($35) I would recommend it to share, as it allows you to taste a wide selection of what they offer. It's very filling so don't be worried that it only has one hot item, falafels.

The baba ghanouch was rich, smokey, and not overly salted. The hummus as well was definitely a notch above your run of the mill grocery quality. A fresh basket of bread was brought upon request and I could watch it being taken directly from the oven, which makes all the difference. If you are more of a meat and rice fan, you can order it easily enough on their diverse menu but for the more adventurous I highly recommend the Mezza.

Lastly,  being curious, I ordered the Mediterranean coffee. This is a very strong, thick coffee brewed with cardamom in a traditional czeve. This is not for the faint of heart, but with a touch of sugar it was better than I expected. Very strong, a slight powdery feel but not bitter at all. This was my first experience with it and would order it again. How many cups of plain ol'joe have you had?

We arrived for lunch and were seated quickly. The menu is extensive and almost everything in the menu was tempting me. It took a few minutes for my friend and I to decide what to order, but the waitress was patient.

I decided to order the lamb and filet kebab lunch plate. They are accommodating with gluten free and low carb requests which is great. I ended up asking for broccoli in place of rice and a side of baba ghanoush. 

Our meals came out quickly and everything was delicious. I haven't loved Khoury's in the past but this experience was much better and more impressive than my previous visits. 

Glad to have this new convenient location and I look forward to visiting again soon.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,12,13,4,HBOD1Is7wVX6arpKg7nymg
