My roughy was a bit sour to my taste but the menu did say lemon sauce. I rated five stars because of the gracious, old school service: a polite waiter who observes when he is needed but otherwise stays in the background, does NOT say he will be taking care of me, does NOT tell me his name, does NOT ask me if I am still ""working"" on my food, does NOT ask me if I"" saved room"" for desert and does not try to upsell me when I order but who does understand that dining out can be a leisurely affair.

I ordered an arrabiata which was off menu and they made it no problem. Bread was delicious. Food even more so. Pricing was good. I think the arrabiata was about $11 ish. Which was inline with the rest of the 'non meat' type pastas.

He had told me a few times before about how great this place was so I was looking forward to it. First of all great atmosphere, very friendly staff, nice Italian music in the background and what a beautiful Italian food smell as soon as we entered. We were welcomed with some nice warm bread. So I decided to have the spaghetti carbonara and my friend got his favorite, the orange roughy. Well what can I say about the carbonara other than AMAZING!!! Of course the orange roughy was excellent as always my friend said too. When we were done with dinner, although we were already pretty full, we decided to have a dessert. I had the homemade tiramisu and my friend had the chocolate eclair. Again AMAZING!! Well that pretty much sums it up. I will be there again very soon!

650531,2010-12-04,0,AZlnpvILz5cEWJifjr2CSQ,"Second time I've been here this was our second visit to Roma deli , our first was the spring mountain location, a few years ago. The pasta was good back then , but the service was soooo slow, we never went back.  
            I decided to give it another shot since one of our favorites JR's closed recently.
            I like the feel of the restaurant/ deli, luv to browse while I wait for my food . 
     The bread was hot , had a thin crisp crust and soft middle.  It just might b a tad better then metro pizza's bread.  
              I had the sausage ragu with fettuccine , nice chunks of sausage in a very flavorful sauce.  The flavor was spot on , but it was just a little dry for me , just a little.  I had a taste of Mom's cheese ravioli, very good , excellant marinara.  
         For dessert had the cannoli and ricotta cheesecake .  The cannoli had an odd flavor to me with a slight bitter taste at the end. I can't figure out the flavoring or spice , I've know I tasted it before jus don't know , what it is.
            The ricotta cheesecake had a double crust. The filling was not to dense or to light and not to sweet.  It was pretty good, I could not help thinking that a fruit sauce( rasberry, strawberry) would put it over the top . 
        Now for the service , there was a few lull's.  I even ask my wife if this was the same server we had the last time.  The server was nice and friendly, just a tad slow, not slow enough to wait a few years to return , though.",3dbkO9K5vcvJXuKrVu4BMA,1,1,4,CJNyOCuza_h3VEinfZIXaA

I almost always order the Beef Braciole, which most Italian restaurants do not have as a regular menu item. Their Roma salad is amazing! It is a chopped salad with tomatoes, red onion, blue cheese crumbles and candied walnuts. My sister and I split that for an appetizer and got the Braciole for our entree. My nephew lives for their meatballs. Sooo good. They have amazing garlic bread or if you are happy with the fresh bread plain that comes to the table enjoy that too because it is irrestible as well. For dessert their tiramisu is so good light and decadent at the same time. Tonight I tried their chocolate cannoli. Best cannoli ever! They don't fill them until you order them so they stay nice and crisp. Honestly it is the best cannoli I have had in Vegas. This place has a wine room and a huge selection of wine as well.

I dinned there Thursday evening the 28th.   I never did know who was my waiter or waitress was as I had three different people I talked with to order. I ordered a 1/2 salad and Meat Raviolis with meat sauce. The salad was good and the raviolis were good, the problem came when they presented me with the bill. I always check to see if the prices were correct and I noticed they had charged me $5.00 for a !/2 salad and $14.99 for the Ravioli's. I asked to see the menu again as I didn't think they had priced the items correctly. The price should have been $4.50 for the salad and $13.99 for the Ravioli's,  I could see someone making a mistake on one item but not both as it is their restaurant and they should know the prices. I call it to their attention and they said sorry, they would change it which they did. I told them that  most people don't ever check the bill closely and they could have been overcharging charging their customer for a long time. I would hope this was an honest mistake, yet mispricing two items on a two item bill a bit concerning. I'm not sure I would go there again as I am not sure what the real story is.",jYcf_e5p0UG0S-9gJq_tNA,2,0,1,33OouxSLK1rtJVtDWOH1dQ

996145,2014-04-09,1,AZlnpvILz5cEWJifjr2CSQ,"My family and I had come here before and had superior service and very good food.  This last time, we got neither.

Our waiter simply didn't like us.  There's no other explanation.  He ignored our repeated requests for more bread; he never once asked us if we wanted more water (I had to flag down the bus boy whenever he served the adjacent table, which was frequently).  He conversed with the customers at the other tables in our area, but didn't even bother to ask us how we were doing.  Two other parties arrived after us, yet they received their entrees before we did.  Once a large party had entered, he served them, and pawned us off to a bus boy.  

I had ordered the veal parmigiana.  The cheese had not melted; it was still in a clump on top of the meat.  It was served lukewarm.  

We spent close to $90 on our meal.  That isn't how you treat people.

I wish I would've taken a picture of the pr*ck so that I could say, ""If you see this guy, leave"".  But maybe you shouldn't bother; just come back after they fire him.  He shouldn't last long.

We've dined in, and carried out, many times over the last few years so it's time to right a review. The deli section is nice. Small but nice. The cookies are good, too. The wine selection is a bit on the pricey side.

The BF always orders one of the specials and usually loves whatever it is. Hands down though (and this is why when I'm craving Italian food but don't feel like making the drive to Gaetano's, I suggest Roma Deli) they have the BEST lasagna I've had anywhere. The meat sauce is so thick and super flavorful. The pasta is always cooked perfectly. It's the only thing I order there since having discovered it.

The only negative on the food at Roma Deli is the pasta which accompanies the dishes. The sauce is way too tangy. Like crazy tangy.",g1_M-7uw6KSGx747Uz16AA,0,0,4,gdQjdGgOiXtRhkiuBYw88g

1244472,2010-12-22,0,AZlnpvILz5cEWJifjr2CSQ,"When we first found this place, we thought it was a blessing. You see, we moved here in Nov. 08' from Connecticut. My wife is an Italian girl from back east. She really hated Vegas, she said the food here sucked. So to find authentic (at the time) Italian was a godsend. They started out doing really well by us. But we have noticed a gradual down hill shift, in both food and service.

It started earlier in the year. My wife's favorite was the Sicilian lasagna, the eggplant was burnt.When the employees were told about the incident, the response was,""Oh really...I'm so sorry"". No offer to replace the meal. Hmmm. So needless to say we haven't been back for six months.

Earlier today I had to run a bunch of errands. My wife called me and asked me if I wanted to give them another shot. Knowing that at one point this was my wife's favorite restaurant, I said OK, give em' another shot. We ordered two lasagnas and two orders of meatballs. 

Beside the fact that the order was shoved in the bag sideways, when I got it home the entire inside of the bag and everything was covered with grease. Both dishes were leaking . OK the food. The lasagna has gone from a work of art and SOME of the best I've ever had, to a greasy mess. The flavoring was poor, (needed salt). I give it a 2 out of 5, and trust me when I say I'm being generous. The meatballs have gone from a work of art to 2 small meatballs with NO flavor, just a ball of meat. Again maybe a 2 out of 5. And overpriced for what you get.

So this place is a great example of how to go from great to so-so. I do believe we won't be going back to this place. It breaks my wife's heart, because she really liked this place.

Fresh-cut meats and cheeses, various salads by the pound, and enough traditional sweets to induce diabetes. Plus a massive wine selection. 

But the best part is the deli- beautiful bread that is crisp and buttery on the outside but soft and chewy on the inside, topped with the aforementioned imported meats and cheeses, high-quality olive oil and fresh basil, and just absolutely perfect.

For cold weather, the chicken parmagiana is just right: the size is big enough to split, just under $10, with so much marinara and mozzarella that it initially smells like a pizza. But sink your teeth into the tender, juicy chicken and you'll be too focused on your food to carry on conversation.
As for our usual warm weather, the Roma sandwich is the namesake of this place and for a darn good reason: domestic or imported prosciutto, fresh mozzarella, roasted peppers, and olive oil. It is deceptively simple, needs no additions or sides. It is just right.

The bottle of Ruffino Chianti (Riserva Ducale Oro) I chose is their store was opened right away, though I felt it needed at least an hour to breathe (in order to enjoy properly), which was unfortunate since we wanted to enjoy it with dinner. I asked if they offered decanters (in order to expedite that process)  to go with big reds such as this, but sadly they didn't... 

*I was also disappointed to find out that the wine I purchased was not in fact under a sale price (which I believed was a $35 discount), I realized this after I saw the price which I paid was the same as at Total Wine. So in fact besides the $10 corking fee which was understood, the $45 paid for the wine was not a discounted price, but in fact a regular price.

The service here is incredibly personable. Osvoldo was a fantastic and attentive server. The owner Dennis, even came to our table to greet us near the end of our meal, and sent over some complimentary dessert.

The food was so divine though, I ordered the Pesto Gnocchi topped with melted mozzarella, which was thick and creamy. It was in fact so heavy, I was only abl to eat 1/4 of it; not a problem as my fiance devoured my leftovers when I got home :) My father had been to La Scala the night before and commented how my Gnocchi was better than the one he ordered there.

My father had the Ceasar Salad; a large spectacular portion. No anchovies though :(

The Beef Carpaccio was pretty disappointing, but not enough to keep us from eating it. 

As we left, Dennis made a wonderful gesture in saying Goodbye. Roma Deli II  is a fantastic Italian eatery, and mixes casual dining with foodie pleasure.",n78PhLGZAiBiQIErPNMn2g,5,2,4,Hq3CREScH72usH-zxwmREQ

The pasta was served in a separate dish which was nice and was cooked al dente. We also got calamari for an appetizer which was pretty good. A little rubbery but that's the nature of the beast. My fiancé ordered the baked ziti which she enjoyed. Baked perfectly with a nice amount of sauce and cheese. I love meatballs so we ordered a side them. They were pretty dang scrumptious.

1st time: As soon as we walk-in to look around and see what they have., a nice older man tells you to come in and sit down..  We explained we just wanted to see a menu and look at the deli.. The Nono, brought over bread and water- and explained that we needed to stay for dinner. This felt like home.  He was very sweet., explaining try this, try that. Just as your grandparents would do.  We have the veal on a bun, and eggplant parmigiana..  The portions were huge!! Very very flavourful.  We left happy and stuffed..  Service and food was 5 star.

2nd visit: Our second visit was during the World Cup.  We assumed they would be showing the game., and have some sort of ""specials"" on to watch Italy play.   When we arrived at 930 am., they were closed.  But the owner was in and setting up for the day.  His name is Fausto.  Fausto invited us in.. He explained the restaurant wasn't opening for a few hrs but invited us to come in and watch the game with him.  He made us espresso., and we tried the cannolis.  It was a very nice morning..  He made us feel like we were at home with family..  We also made sure to give kudos about our first visit.

3rd: our third and most recent visit we had family in town visiting...  There are 40 different restaurants in our 5 mile radius but we wanted our family to experience the wonderful food and service of Roma Deli. 

We arrived for dinner at 6pm.  Fausto was making rounds, introducing himself to tables and ensuring all are having a great night.  Very nice off him.  We ordered the calamari, antipasto, and bruschetta to start..  ( I mentioned in the 1st visit portion sizes., but we still wanted to try everything ). We were full after the appetizers.  Delicious food, and wonderful service.  We ordered 4 different entrées.  One of the things I need to mention--- we were never rushed. The timing of the apps, to the entrees was very well spaced.  We were not just a number.. They let us sit, talk, drink, and enjoy.  I unfortunately cannot tell you to try one dish because everything was amazing, try them all.  Try the wine.  And take your time.  This place is a must see if you are visiting., and if you're a local; this is a perfect date night, or family style restaurant..  It can be whatever you want it to be at Roma Deli II.

I ordered a side of meatballs (I try the meatballs anywhere that serves them, ya I know.. weird.)  and an Italian sub. Little did I know the meatballs came with their fresh garlic bread too. 

The meatballs were friggin great, just like my ex's Sicilian grandma. I finished those and most of the bread which was also on point. The sandwich was very good and fresh as it should be at an Italian deli) but was so big combined with what I already ate I took it home and had the other half for dinner.

A little pricey but the lasagna was delicious. Two of them were very big portions and one was smaller. I won't order the meatballs again because they also went up to $5.99 for two of them. That is a bit pricey for meatballs. Last week we ordered the sicilian lasagna again which has a layer of eggplant on the bottom. The eggplant was burnt. The first time we ordered the sicilian lasagna it was out of this world. After having to remove all the eggplant the last time I ordered it, it has turned me off from the sicilian lasagna forever!

1. The red sauce is salty. I ordered the chicken parm, swapped salad for pasta. The chicken wasn't the most tender, and the sauce... just so much salt! I think hardly any garlic. If you're into chicken parm, check out Parma by Chef Marc... THAT is what you want.

2. The napoleons: they're supposed to have pastry cream in the middle. These have marshmallow fluff (what?!), which is basically whipped corn syrup + various chemistry - something I try to avoid at all costs. I wish I knew that it didn't have the traditional filling - would not have ordered it. The Spring Mountain Roma location stopped carrying the napoleons altogether, and this may be why.

The one thing that I can rave about is the service - great attention. The resto is very clean and can definitely hold a large crowd. Although, between food quality and service, I would much rather be raving about the ""just like gramma's"" food, but unfortunately cannot with Roma. :-(",7Pxx2FehELyKthPj0OY1sg,1,0,3,P0Fk-KVUjlZSpcEAirp5SA

We are always greeted with a fresh warm bread that is really addicting. Especially with the house salad. The salad is big enough for two . The dressing is really good and the veggies are fresh. I  had the chicken parm which was flavorful. They serve the cutlets with the pasta on the side. We had the chocolate cake and the eclair for dessert. The cake was moist and creamy. The eclair was equally delicious!

The second time we came in for lunch so we split an ittalian sandwich and their house salad. The sandwich was a great price for the size. It was about $7.50. I wasn't sure if I would like the sandwich because it looked really salty but it wasn't that bad! We had the Spumoni ice cream cake for dessert which is my favorite ! I saw a picture of this cake on Yelp and I knew I had to give it a try! It isn't always in stock though.

The third time we went was just minutes before their big dinner rush. It was so busy that we were rarely checked on. We only had 1 drink throughout the meal which was bad news for my husband because he drinks like a camel. We were promised a refill on the bread but they never got to us. It was  disappointing because it's so good! I had the sausage pasta that time. I was expecting big pieces of sausage and I asked them to put mozzarella on top.

Last night was a going away dinner for a family member and the honoree picked Roma Deli, a place where many a wonderful meals have been enjoyed in the past.  It was around 6:30 p.m. and only half the tables were occupied.  We were lucky to grab one because within the next few minutes large parties filled the room.  I selected a pricey bottle of wine from the wine shop and immediately experienced the pattern for the night.  Had to wait about 10 minutes to pay at that counter because no one came to help.

Back at the table we sat another thirty minutes with our rapidly disappearing wine before finally getting the salad and a glass of water ordered much earlier.  Fausto the owner came over to our table repeatedly to apologize for the lackluster tempo of the service, but it never improved.  It was all I could do to keep my inner Lou Dragna in check.

Once the entrees arrived it was the usual fabulous quality and quantity, and that made up for a lot of the sins.   It finished badly when the check was delivered two hours after our arrival and there was a $60 charge for the wine which I had already paid for an hour and a half earlier.  Another series of ""mea culpas"" from Fausto and we made our escape.

The location of this place also gets mixed reviews.  At the highly trafficked corner of Sahara and Durango, it's difficult to access unless you are westbound on Sahara.  Once in the mini mall parking lot the hunt starts for an available stall.  Last night when we arrived five were occupied by the Dominoes pizza delivery vehicles and many of the patrons spent a lot of time trying to find a place to park.

The food is consistently excellent, and they actually know what ""al dente"" is supposed to be. Their bread is fresh made every day and as stated in other reviews the Tiramisu is beyond compare. If nothing else you owe it to yourself to try that. My favorite is the spaghetti and meatballs, the meatballs are the size of your fist and have a wonderful flavor.

However, my hub loves linguine and clams, so when I saw a beautiful picture of that dish at Roma, I convinced him we should try it. Generally our snobbish attitude is that we can make spaghetti so why eat Italian out? I think I know why now! Big portions, big flavors, and homemade garlic bread!

We could probably walk here, but the exterior has never convinced me it was a culinary treasure. As soon as you get out of your car , however, your nose tells you otherwise. They are definitely cooking fresh bread on premises as the aromas fill the parking lot.

The interior is very casual. A ""sit wherever you like"" kind place. There is a counter with salads by the pound, deli meats, cheese and a variety of sweets, and there is also a wine shop connected to the main dining area. The cast of characters is interesting from two Italian car sales guys munching on their egg and peppers sandwich to what appeared to be an entire Italian family complete with grandma.

My husband knew what he wanted, and I went with the special rigatoni of the day in a red sauce with peas and mushrooms. We shared the house salad, which was a generous serving of mixed greens with 2 giant pieces of garlic bread. I am always thrilled to see a salad done well! When our entrees arrived, we were impressed (and excited) to each receive 2 more giant pieces of garlic bread! The food was piping hot, fresh, and mouth-wateringly delicious. It was so good I found myself risking a burnt mouth because I couldn't resist shoveling down the perfectly al dente pasta. My husband was pleased as well.

She was friendly and accommodating considering we asked to sit in a closed section.  She asked for our drink order which I thought was really efficient.

The male server took some time to come to our table but once he took our order everything was fine.  We ordered 2 sides of meatballs, Greek salad, half Caesar salad and a glass of wine.  While we waited for our food we were brought some incredible garlic bread!  It was sooooo good!  My aunt who is here visiting from Austria commented on how good it was and she worries how many calories there are in it!

Our food came out in a decent time.  The meatballs were not hot.  They were only warm.  We did not complain so there was no chance given to remedy the ""issue"".  Both salads were great!  The feta in the Greek salad was mild and firm.  So much better than the ""feta"" if you can even call it feta that you buy across the street at Smith's.  The Greek salad had a good amount of tasty olives and artichoke hearts too.  It wasn't your run of the mill salad.  The Caesar was fresh with a great tasting dressing.

We ordered espresso and it didn't taste good.  It tasted old and was not hot.

I would recommend this restaurant.  They have a nice outdoor area with just a few tables to eat your meal at.  Parking is fine but there isn't much.

5322940,2014-05-25,8,AZlnpvILz5cEWJifjr2CSQ,"Please, someone tell me what I am missing here? 

My family loves Italian food. LOVES LOVES LOVES IT. Being super carb sensitive (I think about carbs and I gain 5 lbs. Eating Italian is the bane of my existence for this very reason.

The premise is nice. A family run, Italian deli. I can dig that. We entered, were instantly greeted, I checked in on Yelp (the Elite thang to do), and perused the menu. I was shocked at the prices. A simple pasta dish was $14.99. For PASTA?  None of their dishes came with soup or salad to justify the high cost. 

Anyway, my family ordered, freshly baked bread arrived. Piping hot, crispy on the outside, soft in the middle. I had once slice and savored it. This was the best part of the meal. We each had ordered a cup of soup (70 degree weather in late May justifies as cool enough for soup in my book) They were all  homemade and they were all awful, My pasta e fagoli was nothing but a weird broth, white beans, and pasta. The minestrone was vegetable soup with pasta. The chicken soup was hopeful, but it didn't have any real flavor. Each cup of soup was an additional $5. Decent sized cups, but when the flavor is lackluster...

Next come our entrees. The stuffed pepper was the only tasty thing ordered, a bit salty, but had a rich complexity in flavor profile and texture. I ordered the four cheese risotto. It was far too salty and thankfully my mama put some of her yummy stuffed pepper sauce into my dish and it perked it up a bit. The risotto was cooked a little too short, it was not to the point of al dente (which to my knowledge is how all noodles in Italian restaurants are served). The other dished ordered was the baked rigatoni. Pasta, greasy meat sauce, and a layer of cheese. Ekk!  I tried a bit of it and I swear this AM after brushing my teeth last night and again this AM, I still feel a thin layer of grease on the roof on my mouth (okay, I'm being dramatic). These dishes all ranged from $14.99 to $18.99. I don't understand. Pasta, tomatoes, and buying bulk cheese isn't that expensive. All of the food was wrapped up and taken to go. Again, portions are HUGE, but when the food doesn't taste good, it's just even more of a waste.

Service was great. Attentive. Informative. So kudos there. However, $90 for 3 people to eat at an Italian Deli is ludicrous in my mind. Especially when I would rather eat at Olive Garden and it would have been far more satisfying and lighter on the wallet. The restaurant was also very loud. The high ceilings and the absence of a wall in the dining area amplified noise level. I feel like I was robbed eating here. I ate carbs for you, Roma! Carbs!

I got all reminiscent of the Sopranos when I saw Mortadella in the deli case. Okay on to the meal... the chicken parmesan was simply perfect. The serving was generous, the chicken was pounded thin and breaded lightly with just enough crunch left to provide contrast to the hearty sauce it was covered with. The side of pasta was not necessary yet appreciated. It had the same delicious marinara sauce that accompanied the chicken. The garlic bread was everything a piece of garlic bread should be, hearty and crunchy enough to stand up to the robust sauce and full of flavor.",erJ1HQwavgZx4996SMIxrA,3,3,4,eSgmbgjF9HYMmXkUxS5o6g

VEGETARIAN'S TAKE NOTE

1. Ordered a VEGETARIAN lasagna get all the way home only to find they gave me an eggplant instead. 

2. Returned and even ordered something extra to help balance their loss which was their fault to begin with but hey, we are all human and make mistakes. I choose to give others opportunities to improve themselves. Driving away I check bag and Massimo forgot to add the dessert.

3rd and final MAJOR screw up!

Once again I order a VEGETARIAN lasagna, I get all the way home and am excited for dinner and take 1st bite only to spit it right out. They screwed up yet again and gave me a MEAT lasagna and I have not had any meat, chicken etc for over 35 years. 

I call and Massimo picks up the phone and asked how I paid for it then stepped away for a bit to ask kitchen about order to see if it was kitchens fault or his fault and comes back and says bring it back but didn't mention who's fault it was.

I drive all the way across town and bring the MEAT lasagna back and experienced aditude completely uncalled for by Massimo who conceitedly tried to blame me and said ""he thought it was REALLY FUNNY this has happened 2 times."" 

I remained patient throughout his unprofessional tantrum and politely said ""no, Massimo, it has happened 3 times as you also forgot part of my order the last time and you now think it's funny that you served meat to a vegetarian who has not had meat in over 35 years? I said ""do you know how this feels?"" Massimo sarcastically said ""no, i'm not a vegetarian and showed minimal remorse or compassion for their screw ups.

Masimo you should be ashamed of yourself and consider taking a trip someplace and regrouping yourself as this type of behavior to any human being is completely uncalled for. Your  poor attitude and unprofessional communication was uncalled for and not appreciated.

 I REFUSE to reward poor behavior and it is unfortunate I am forced to give you even 1 star and assure you I will NEVER set foot or recommend Romas to others. 

If you select at top ""view reviews by lowest rated"" you will clearly see from other YELP reviewers this poor customer service is not out of the ordinary. 

To get that angry over a few slices of pasta, eggplant and sauce that probably cost you a few dollars out of pocket for YOUR mistake is truly pitiful.

I don't remember the food being bad, so I don't know why we never tried it again, but, boy, am I glad we did. The whole experience was fantastic, we had family in town and so the four of us went together, we ordered and while waiting for our food, browsed the goodies on display in the deli area, there were extra things lying about with very festive holiday wrap, guessing they do food gift baskets. 

As soon as the bread came, it was back to the table to enjoy a really tasty bread loaf. It was crispy outside while soft inside, had a pizza dough taste, but with melted butter, it was good! I had to have extra put aside for my entree, I had the cioppino, it was suppose to be a bit spicy, but it was only mildly so. There were plenty of calamari but just a few shrimp, mussels and clams. It was mostly soup, but I enjoyed anyway. 

My mother in law got the cheese ravioli and she never eats it all, so she shared one with me, to was good all smothered with marinara sauce. For desert, there are some great choices, we split a cannoli and ricotta cheese cake, I loved them both. 

My only criticism would have to be the service, they were a bit slow to refill tea glasses, and to stop by to see if we were doing okay with our meals.

I had been here before several times since my parents love it (which is usually a red flag), but maybe I was quick to judge the first few times.

I think I probably was because it's grown on me. The all Italian family staff is cute and gives the restaurant a nice feel. Is it one of the must try spots for locals? Lol no chance. But it's good and off the strip Italian is hard to come by.

-Antipasto: Pretty good. Meats nothing special. Vegetables include red peppers artichoke etc and are fairly good. Bruschetta above average. Decent platter.

-Veal Scaloppini: Above average definitely but still pretty standard offering.

-Baked Ziti thing: I don't remember the name of this item on the menu and the online menus are definitely incomplete but it was pretty good. Lots of cheese, lots of meat, lots of om nom.

I've tried other things before but honestly cannot remember much about them. The takeaway is that it's very traditional Italian. They won't have any items that are crazy delicious or highly innovative because it's an old school place. The pasta dishes taste as you would expect but what comes with that expectation is consistency which is hard to come by.

Hands down, the food is 5 stars. It's so fresh and delicious. Feels like you're having a homemade meal. The portions are large and the prices are very fair. 

Now for the service. For the most part, I've had exceptional service. The employees are nice, friendly, and offer great recommendations. Most of my visits here, I've made a reservation. However, my last visit was not so great.  

Came here for dinner on a Monday night, really craving some yummy pasta. Got here at 8:15pm (mind you they have hours posted that they are open until 9pm) and the place was fairly busy. I saw at least 7 tables seated, many of them in the middle of their meals. Walked in and was asked if we were getting take out, no we just need a table for 2. Was told that they were closed...we stated that it says they are open until 9 and was told that it was slow that day and they sent the chef home already and the kitchen was being cleaned. But if we wanted take out they would accommodate that. 

How can they make us food to go when the chef is gone and the kitchen is being cleaned?! Anyways, we left. The place was clearly not slow and I think they just wanted to go home early. I could understand if we got there late, but we didn't. This was extremely annoying and disappointing. We drove 20mins out of the way to come here for a nice date night. 

It's important to honor posted business hours. This experience will probably discourage me from coming back as often as I would like to.",dL4_drDAJAPCsiw1y-xPNg,1,1,3,yzkzI0wYkj8_9hjtCkZcuw
