I think they move back and forth between old school and noveau, but each time it's been delicious.  Their staff is well trained  to interpret customer nuances and are very knowledgeable in their craft.  Last meal? Veg samosas ( non-traditional but tasty wrap, scrumptuous filling) and chicken tikka (perfectly grilled, seasoned and juicy).  Followed with delicious saag paneer (cheese quality was phenomenal, wonder if they actually make it in house or they buy it) and the kabob platter, scooped with plain naan.  I was not that impressed with the lamb, but still good...and the tikka this time around was just a bit dry.  Those two details and the slightly higher prices (with a la carte breads & rice) may take away a bit, but not a full star.  Great meal, great service, very comfortable and tasteful ambiance (definitely Indian, yet with a very crisp feel).  Every meal? Maybe not...but definitely perfect for a night out or special hangout.

92985,2009-09-28,1,ohz8ljVxcZMo2bMGrBZfgw,"One of my favorite restaurants in Las Vegas. And one of the best Indian restaurants I have been to anywhere in the world.  The menu may or may not be ""completely"" traditional Indian cuisine, but their interpretation is quite well done.

I love everything about this place. The ambiance and the food is just spectacular.  They have recently introduced a $45 5 course tasting menu which is a great way to introduce (or re-introduce) yourself to Indian fare. When ordering from the menu, I have never been steered wrong in any selection.  Each dish has been truly outstanding.

Some changes to the menu have also introduced an Apricot and Raisin Naan which is unbelievable and can be eaten on it's own.

The biggest surprise about Origin India? They may well have the best cocktails in all of Las Vegas, and at non-Strip prices. Each cocktail is made by hand with care with fresh ingredients by their master bartender, Joseph. No pre-made fruit juice mixes in these drinks. Try the cucumber/pear martini: one of the best cocktails I've ever had the pleasure of tasting.",tyPhJy0OMJqf9k9Xzck3uA,1,0,5,aiC8W4aDknZepH13jW-kCw

He's crafted some very complex drinks using the same herbs, spices and ingredients the cooks are using in the kitchen. 

 I recommend the Black Mamba if you're getting something hearty like the lamb or chicken tikka. The Cucumber Pearl was light and  perfect for a vegetarian dish. The Lal Dupata (Red Veil) was also very good  with the chicken curry. We had a few more but I don't recall the names. Keep in mind these take a few minutes to make.

165832,2011-08-03,3,ohz8ljVxcZMo2bMGrBZfgw,"My friend and I were in the mood for some Indian cuisine. 4 stars on Yelp is pretty good, right? Unfortunately, the best thing that can be said about this place is it has a nice interior, more upscale than your typical Indian establishment. Otherwise, the food was decidedly mediocre and the service was absolutely atrocious, some of the worst I've experienced in a long time. But let's start from the beginning...

On a big banner right outside the restaurant, they advertised a 3-course dinner for two for $29.99. Upon inquiring about this option, our waiter informed us that special was no longer being offered and they've been meaning to take it down. However, they did have a 5-course tasting menu, served family-style, for $45 per person! Now either the waiter was bullshitting us or their website which advertises the same special is out-of-date as well. Either way, this is what you call a classic ""bait and switch"" and FALSE advertising! We should have taken the hint and walked out then, but we were hungry. Unfortunately this same thought would be a recurring theme throughout the rest of the evening. So we asked what was included in the 5-course tasting menu and were not terribly excited by what we heard and it didn't seem worth anywhere near $90 for the two of us. We asked for a ""few more minutes"" to peruse the menu.

After about 5 minutes, we decided to get the sweet apricot and raisin naan ($4), chicken tikka makhani ($13), seven spice veal ($25), baby eggplant ($11), and 2 side dishes of chana massala and aloo gobi ($7 each). Oh and we had to pay another $3 for a single order rice because none of the entrees came with any! We ended up waiting another 15 minutes before another waiter spotted us looking a bit perturbed and asked if we needed anything. We told him we were ready to order. I thought he was going to take our order but instead he just told our original waiter that we were ready and would be ""right with us"". Our waiter was running a couple's credit card with one of those portable terminals right at their table. After the receipt was signed, the waiter continued to idly chat with them for another 5 minutes or so. Then our waiter disappeared into the kitchen or God knows where for another 10 minutes before finally coming to take our order. He apologized for us waiting ""a few minutes"" (yeah right, try half an hour). I would be more understanding if they were really busy, but less than 1/5 of the tables were occupied. I know, I know, we should've walked out already.

So finally our order is in, but we wait and wait and we wait some more. We continue to watch other customers who sat down after us and ordered after us, get their food first and in one case, actually pay the bill and leave! At this point I am so incredibly green with envy of the customers who have the ""other waiter"". After about half an hour, they finally bring out all the food at once. At this point, we were absolutely ravenous, but our spirits lifted in the hopes that it would be worth the wait.

Unfortunately, while the food satiated our hunger pangs, it was substandard Indian fare. The naan was not crispy at all but rather thick and gummy. It didn't contain very much apricot or raisin and no chutney, tamarind, mint, or any kind of condiments were offered. The chicken makhani, usually one of my favorites, was kind of bland. It lacked the spicy complexity that a good curry should have. The chicken didn't seem to be marinated at all. It was dry and was probably cooked separately and then tossed into the curry at the end. The aloo gobi was mostly potato and contained very little cauliflower. We both got bitefuls of undercooked, semi-raw potato as well. The chana massala, veal, and baby eggplant dishes fared no better.

During this time, no one stopped by to ask how the food was. Nobody offered to refill our nearly empty glasses of water until we were ready to pay the check. After asking for the check, we waited over 15 minutes before our waiter returned and was expecting to collect the check. When we explained that we still had not received the check, he disappeared for another 4-5 minutes before finally returning with our check. We usually pay via credit card, but decided that we better settle up in cash lest we want to spend another half an hour waiting. I almost never leave no tip, but I'm thinking this is one of the rare situations that qualify. However, my friend lobbies hard to leave at least 10%. As we're walking back to our cars, a Black crack whore tries to solicit us. Ah, a fitting end to such a memorable evening!

Here's the executive summary: nice interior ambiance, over-priced mediocre food, horrendous service. I am sorely tempted to give this 1-star but since the food was at least edible (except for the undercooked potatoes) I suppose it just BARELY merits 2 stars. Take my advice: save your money AND time. Don't do it. Just go somewhere else, like Mount Everest, Namaste, or Samosa Factory.",LkWNo83Lg92C5V4JEyxOZA,8,2,2,luKckkYMjdYW6-coQ_pprg

244900,2011-06-21,0,ohz8ljVxcZMo2bMGrBZfgw,"Our second time at Origin India, and it was as good, or better than the first time.  We had tandoori chicken for appetizer - the best tandoori chicken ever.  Not that dyed red stuff you get most places, but moist, tender flavorful dark meat chicken (our fav!)  We ordered papadums and it arrived with two dipping sauces which were fabulous.  The papadums were light and delicious.  We then had lamb shank, baked cod and sag paneer, all of which were terrific and 2 orders of garlic naan  (oh the naan!) to sop up all the delicious sauces and juices.  Our waiter, Ahmed (an Egyptian, actually) went out of his way to make sure we were happy, and we appreciated his attention to detail.

The decor is simple but tasteful.  This has become our favorite Indian restaurant.  The bartender is on UTube making a couple of the imaginative cocktails the restaurant serves.  We didn't have one, but my husband did have a Cilantro Mojito, different but delicious.  

We ate early (about 5:30) but by the time we left at 7:00 the restaurant was mostly full, with a couple of large parties as well.  Everyone seemed to be having a good time, and I know we did.

Bringing the check to the table with the machine to run your credit card is definitely different, but lets you have the confidence that there is no-one fooling with your card.  We like that little bit of safety!",-8bfKCvDClxD3iKX9o7J5w,0,0,4,8AVWpscMXtCkoAmNIM0YEA

303485,2011-12-19,0,ohz8ljVxcZMo2bMGrBZfgw,"So I've eaten at Origin India a handful of times and have had wildly different experiences.  If I were to have judged based solely on the time I came for a lunch during the week, I might have gone with two stars.  They didn't want to serve me off the menu, the server was rude and unhelpful, and the food wasn't anything special.  Or there was the time I came on a late Sunday afternoon and I didn't have anyone even talk to me for the first 20 minutes after I had been seated.... 

So, why am I going with four stars?  Well, when this place is good, it's five-star good.  The servers are friendly and attentive, the food is tasty and flavorful, and you can usually find a deal to help on the cost.  The restaurant itself is beautiful and makes a great date spot.

We are always seated quickly even when the place is packed.  Usually we have someone ready to get our drink orders asap (except on super busy Sunday afternoons) and they are pretty good about refills.

My husband and I always order the same items at every Indian restaurant: a mango lassi, garlic naan, vegetable samosas, saag paneer, and vegetable korma.  All of these are done well here.  I wish the mango lassi was a little bigger and the garlic naan a little more doughy, but overall everything is great.  This is the place where I found enormous chunks of cheese in my saag paneer and that put a big grin on my face.

Just a few fyi's: sign up for their frequent diner card and get $15 off every time you spend $100, find coupons through yelp/restaurant.com/etc, I've noticed their food is a tad spicier than other Indian places so be careful if you don't like heat, I don't really recommend coming at lunch considering the difference in service I've had at dinner time, their food is a little more upscale so they may have some different items than other Indian restaurants.

All that being said, the majority of the time Origin India is great.  Just please don't hate on me if you catch them on a crazy Sunday afternoon.",ELfzWgdf64VBLi5z1ECItw,1,1,4,Cj9rsHKyFIgKWGkie0LmOQ

If you are hungry and looking for an Indian Restaurant, This will not even be my last place to go, I will simply go to any Fast Food chain rather.

We were a group of 4(hungry to eat only Indian food) who ended up paying $100 + , for something that was not up to mark in taste and also not filling. Guess What, We ended up eating again in an hour at a fast food giant. What a pity on us.

I would have given the restaurant at least a 2 star if the Manager spoke nicely with us. He was so rude , I never had such a bad experience. 

If someone gives this place a rating more than 2 , I would say he doesnt know what indian food is and how nicely Indians behave.

I dont know any other Indian restaurants in LV, I googled Indian Restaurants in Las Vegas and saw that Yelp ratings were pretty high and I ended up here having a very high expectation. I am back to the same Yelp to reveal the reality !

But, our server totally ruined our experience.

I went with two of my friends.  We were asking our server some questions about different dishes.  When we asked our server how big a dish was (we were trying to decide whether to order three or four different dishes), he made it sound like it was so little that it would be small for even one person.  He thought that we were going to order just one dish to share.  Once he realized that we were ordering multiple dishes, then and only then he gestured that the dish was bigger than what he had initially told us.

When the food started coming out, we looked at each other incredulous because that particular dish we asked our server about was so big that two people could have eaten it and left the restaurant full.  It wasn't that we didn't want to order more dishes, we were just amazed how the server tried to manipulate his answer so that he would get us to order more.

465595,2013-04-11,0,ohz8ljVxcZMo2bMGrBZfgw,"LOVED this place! Came here as part of a group of seven, which is perfect for this type of restaurant, because we were able to order a bunch of dishes and try a little of each.
 
We started with the onion bhajis and Bombay bhelpurri. The latter is puffed rice mixed with onions and tomatoes in a tamarind sauce. I'd never tried this dish before and it was very tasty. The puffed rice gave it an interesting texture different from most dishes you typically find in an Indian restaurant.

For our mains, we shared the the lamb vindaloo, chana masala (chickpea curry), Rajastani paneer and southern grilled fish. The fish was a bit disappointing (lacklustre and slightly overcooked) but the other three dishes were excellent. I'm not a huge lamb fan so my favourites were the chana masala (very spicy and flavourful) and most of all the Rajastani paneer. This was a paneer (Indian cheese) dish in a carrot-based sauce that also contained bell peppers and cashew paste. Again, I had never tried this particular type of paneer before, but I absolutely loved it and will definitely keep an eye out for it in Indian restaurants in my 'hood. It was rich, creamy and delicious.

The atmosphere was I suppose what you would expect in an Indian restaurant (Indian-style decor but with a lot of modern touches), with the exception that instead of Indian music, they were playing random pop music. A little out of place with the atmosphere I thought, at least until later in the evening when it becomes more of a ""bar"" atmosphere.

Overall, the service was very good and we had a great experience here. It's located a short cab ride from the strip but more than worth a return trip if I'm looking for good Indian food in Las Vegas.",sTaq8WK7In539EGyjOhXwg,1,0,4,-_h56ehnzDxfhgA7h95-8g

While I like the music and earthy tones used in the decor.  I didn't like the cheap decorations and hanging fake candles.  The chair and table combination made me feel like the table was at my throat.  
Once we were seated it took a unreasonable length of time to get water much less drink service.  Water was finally served at the time they took our order. Which was probably about 30 minutes after our arrival.  Our order was taken by a waiter who insisted there portions were very ""generous."" 

The presentation of the appetizers was very nice but not very high on the taste factor.  I can't remember what it was that I had ordered.  Our main curse arrived in a series of small bowls.  The rice and naan were both tasty but the portions were disappointing.  Rice and naan are cheap to make and shouldn't be given out so limitedly.  I again can't remember exactly what I ordered but the food overall was highly disappointing.  The only item I can remember eating because it was probably the best of all 6 different dishes we ordered was the curried chicken.  While better than anything else we had it was still not great.

After dinner was served is when things really went down hill.  Our server seemed to have died.  Everyone at the table ran out of water about half way through dinner and never got a refill.  It took another hour to get the bill during witch time the buser passed our table repeatedly with the water pitcher and ignored us as we tried to wave him down.  Even with money in hand trying to pay the bill we were ignored for sometime.  I was very please to walk out of Origins 2.5 hours later, not because I was satisfied but because I hated every minute I spent in the place.

On one final note they were not busy this night.  Our table was one of about 6 with patrons.  The food was instantly forgettable and the price was way to high.  Hands down worst service in Las Vegas.  I will not return to Origin ever again.",e6KCPZGQn8Km14kLKKPLXQ,1,0,1,NHmok5ck2JwVuFUZ2t-bhA

It's a cozy restaurant with the perfect amount of lighting for a date, which I took my wife.  They have a nice wine selection list.  The service was spot on, we were attended to just the right amount.  

I ordered the spicy lamb curry... and let me tell you, the lamb was so perfectly cooked that it literally fell apart in my mouth and the flavors and textures could not have been better.  I also ordered the lemon rice which if you like rice at all, it's beyond amazing.  Lemon rice + spicy lamb curry = foodgasm. 

There was only one hiccup.  I like spicy food, like biting into a jalapeno hot so I did have to send it back for the chef to add a little more kick.  But that's just my personal preference.

The only thing that I didn't like is that rice or bread did not come with the entrees.

We had pretty much decided on what we were going to order when my sister asked our server, Senad, a few questions about butter, meat broth, etc. He said, ""You're vegan? We have a vegan menu,"" and took our menus and returned with a comprehensive two-page all vegan menu. My sister and I were pumped! The only problem with the vegan menu is THERE ARE NO PRICES! That really annoyed me. We asked Senad what the prices were and he said something along the lines of, ""oh the prices are just like the regular menu."" Not good enough. It seems so strange to go to the trouble of making up a whole vegan menu and then not provide prices. 

The food came out quickly. We ordered 3 vegan samosas ($7) and they were fantastic. The rest of the food came out shortly thereafter. We ordered Baingan Bhartha ($11), Aloo Gobi ($11), and Bhindi Masala ($11). Since none of those dishes come with rice we ordered Pulao Rice ($4), which is basmati rice with saffron.

The Baingan Bartha (eggplant) was really good, too. It had a little bit of a spicy kick. The Aloo Gobi (curried potatoes and cauliflower) was also really good. I am a sucker for potatoes.

I lived in London for several years, which has some of the best curry houses out there. I know what good curry is, and Origin just doesn't have it.

Perhaps the fusion menu is somewhat better than the traditional menu, but I was in the mood for curry so I stuck with the traditional. We ordered 4 different dishes, 2 mains and 2 sides. We had a curried lamb shank, a prawn dish, mutter paneer and dal mahkani. 

Let me be clear, the curry was not necessarily bad, it just wasn't that good. Each of the dishes tasted exactly the same, and looked much the same. The food was bathed in some sort of bitter tasting dark-colored gravy. It would have been fine as a stand alone dish, but getting 4 plates of exactly the same flavor/texture just didn't do it for me.

Personally, we don't love using coupons, even if we purchase them. Dunno, they just make us feel cheap. But way to make us feel even crappier about using the coupon...That we bought!

After we ate, we presented the coupon to another waiter who argued with us again and gave us an attitude when we explained the other waiter said he'd accept it.

Bottom line is: If you have restrictions on your coupons, put it in the freaking coupon fine print! We noticed after the fact that the coupon actually states: ""Business owner: Deal must be honored according to terms on certificate. No additional restrictions may be added at time of redemption.""

I went to this place with my family for lunch buffet, the buffet is over priced $14.99 per person and the following are the items in buffet.

1 veggie soup - flavor less and watery.
2 cheap appetizer 

3 Chicken tikka
4. steamed rice
5. lamb curry
6. Fish curry 
7. veggie curry - no salt and veggies were uncooked and raw.
8 lentils - flavorless, no salt 
9 rice pudding 

Service is very bad, there was a middle aged waiter who has an attitude problem.

The decor is good and looked expensive and therefore it seemed they want to feed customers garbage at expensive rate and make up for the decor cost. 

For the kind of money they charge I could have had better meal in one of the casinos.

The very thought of this place enrages me and my family because we spent nearly $100 for this crap.

So far Vegas has been a big disappointment for indian food. Gaylord's wasn't great nor was Tamba. Origin India however was everything i hoped for. 

For appetizers. I had the Bhajia and my girlfriend had the Aloo Mattar Tikki. For the first time in a long time i ordered better than her on appetizers. I'm not a huge bhajia fan but these were done perfectly. The Aloo Matter Tikki was also delicious and the presentation of both dishes were also great.

For mains. I was deciding between Paneer Shashlik or Paneer Shabnam $15 the manager recommended the Shabnam. The girlfriend ordered Chana Masala $13. Both dishes came with rice, naan and a small daal which i didn't realise and seems great value for money. Since i hadn't realised that i also ordered a daal palak as an accompaniment.

The Paneer Shabnam was absolutely delicious and the texture of the paneer also perfect. My girlfriend's Chana Masala was up until now the best and most well rounded Chana Masala i've ever tasted. Then on top of that the dark daal that came with my meal called Dal Bukhara was perfect too, extremely dark tasting. The manager asked how everything was and i said the daal was one of the best daals i've ever tasted, so then 5 minutes later he brings me another one out on the house. 

The naans were also cooked to perfection with the crispy underside and very soft, air bread top.

The only small dissappointment was the Palak Daal and the Mango Lassi. The Palak Daal was too vinegary tasting for me and i couldn't get through it.  The mango lassi was more like a mango smoothie than Lassi, but still tasted good, my taste might be swayed by the lassi being served in a cocktail glass which seemed strange.

Lastly, inside is very very nicely decorated and the service is extremely attentive. 

All in all, the best Indian i have eaten in Vegas and the third best Indian restaurant i've ever been too. Passe thru Indian in Malaysia #1 and East Z East Manchester England #2.

914558,2012-07-06,3,ohz8ljVxcZMo2bMGrBZfgw,"Mediocre food and the worst attitude I have experienced in a long time. 

Went for dinner on July 3 and ordered 4 Biryanis which were OK but the Raita which came with it was good for one Biryani. When pointed it out they said that's the standard quantity so we ordered more Raita, no Problem still. Ordered some desserts but nothing great there as well. Gajar Halwa was too sweet and luke warm, Ras Malai pieces were broken (happens if they are not fresh) and was not cold as its supposed to be. When the bill came it had few (4-5) items we didn't order. Thankfully my buddy caught it and when he pointed out to the manager he was not apologetic at all and behaved as if he is doing us a favor by correcting his mistake.  

Anyway next day we saw a deal on Groupon next day so we thought lets give it another shot and try their Buffet.  We were a big group so bought two different coupons and they said one coupon per table. We offered to sit on two different tables but the waiter smiled and said it's ok and pointed us to a big table.The spread was good but the food was again OK and very heavy, one positive was that they brought fresh Nans to the table which were soft.  When the waiter got us the bill they again said that they can't accept two coupons. We called the manager and he said ""I am not sure what the waiter said but I see you sitting on one table"" . I don't mind these small things usually but its the attitude that sucks, forget about accepting the coupon there was no apology in case the waiter created the confusion. This is the level of service when they saw us second time in two days .

Bottom line didn't feel that the management/ staff is courteous and and the food tastes edible but is pretty greasy and heavy. May be try another Indian restaurant next time.",psduEJ5pf-a-eY9Q-BuTbA,0,0,1,FGohaNZeUznzLv6_S49Q7w

I'm disappointed because they were so good and the service was so amazing before and this time around it was just not.

My friend and I walk in, get seated, and are immediately approached by a waiter inquiring on our water preference. We receive our menus and start talking and realize that we have no drink menu. Okay? Don't the two usually go together? Mid conversation we're interrupted by another waiter after we just looked at the newly received drink menu. We said we need more time and he saunters off. The menu has become this bizarre fusion without the proper names of the dishes, so it's like uh what? Basically they give you the recipe without saying what it is. My friend ordered the chicken tikka salad that was served over a minuscule bed of coarsely chopped iceberg and romaine and I ordered the lamb curry stir fry, which was really lamb vindaloo. We ordered some samosas and apricot and raisin naan to start. The waiter inquires how spicy I wanted the vindalooo and I say as spicy as it gets and that we would like the naan and the samosas to start. Please tell me why it took 10 minutes to get our cocktails in a bar that was not busy? I mean literally the bartender was just standing there doing nothing and there was no one at the bar. When we received our cocktails that were $10 in small martini glasses we were less then impressed. I ordered the orange peace margarita and my friend ordered a blackberry pomegranate concoction. We both slowly drank them, but they were not that good. So our naan arrives at the table as well as our samosas in a little tower shape with a nice presentation. The flavors were good, albeit dry. 4 minutes after that he brings the chicken tikka salad to the table after he asked when we were taking our order if we wanted the salad with the samosas or with the lamb. We said with the lamb since that was her entree. After 5 additional minutes obviously my lamb wasn't coming and he forgot they were supposed to be served together. So she ate and I just sat there. Fun times. After she was done, the lamb got brought to the table and I literally could barely eat it. My fault because I said as spicy as it gets, but that was ridiculous. I can usually take spicy but damn. He asked how everything was, I said really really spicy and he brought over some raita.  It still wasn't good after that, and when he inquired later on how I was doing, I still said it's really spicy and he awkwardly laughed and walked away. He didn't ask do you want me to have the kitchen make another one for you? Nope, he just giggled and walked away. WTF?! Now I could understand if I ate half of the dish but I had a little corner of my plate with the lamb on it and some rice. It felt like it was his first waiting tables job and it was just off. Yes, the waiter was nice but it felt like a poorly operated faux fine dining experience. They were not trained properly on etiquette, nor timing. We paid our $60 bill and left. I boxed up my vindaloo and took it home and ended up just throwing it away anyway because I knew I wasn't going to eat it, I just couldn't justify spending $21 for something and not eating it. Oh and also, the lamb didn't come with rice it was a $3 upcharge. Ridiculous. 

After the great experience I had to that is just disappointing, and it was my birthday last night to boot. I'm kind of undecided if I want to go back after that.",P62V2QfGKaubelwcdFbquA,5,1,2,yy2SdXBeccgTOITjsfQjCw

I'm not a fan of Indian food. My tongue cannot handle the spiciness this food typically contains. However, I was in Vegas and this town is about leaving your ol' self at home and trying new experiences. 
So, I walked in to the restaurant and they were celebrating an event. They server told me that I had to wait 'til 10 pm to place my order. I waited patiently, and one of the owners came over and apologized. 
He went ahead and took my order. I tend not to eat fish anywhere, so he recommended the Old Delhi style corn fed chicken tikka makhani prepared with ground spices and fenugreek flavoured tomato makhani sauce, served with pulao rice. 
I took it to go. When I got back to my hotel room. I seriously prayed it would not be too spicy. 
I grabbed a spoon and went for taste:
Ummm, not bad. Hot ,but not... wait, crap, spiciness coming in... where's the rice? Found it! oh! yeah... that's better. Not bad. Ok, let's continue.

I know what's good, what's not so good. Years ago (like 5), I went to Origin India and was blown away by the food. It set the bar for Indian food in Las Vegas. 

I took my daughters (7 years old) to Origin India a few weeks ago. Figured it's time they're exposed to their peoples' food. The place still looks the same (which is quite nice, actually). The gentleman who waited on us was very friendly. He even brought my daughters out free Mango Lassi's. The lassi's were delicious. Reminded me exactly of those served in my parents' place in LA (now long gone). 

For the kiddos, I ordered plain Naan, tandoori chicken and plain rice. For myself, the vegetable biryani and lamb vindaloo (my favorite dish in the world when done right). And a Kingfisher, which if you haven't tried it, it's a fantastic beer!

Overall, I was pretty underwhelmed by the food. 

The naan seemed flatter than it should be but tasted good. The tandoori chicken was a little on the dry side. Not unlike that you'd find at an Indian food buffet. 

The vegetable biryani was a complete disappointment: mushy rice, too wet, soft and flavorless (probably canned) vegetables. 

The lamb vindaloo was not good. It kind of tasted like vindaloo but mostly didn't. It's hard to explain but the flavors just didn't seem developed enough. You could tell there were spices and flavors in there but they just weren't coming through. The funny thing is, when I took the leftovers out of the fridge to eat the next day, the sauce tasted a 100 times better. I'm guessing the vindaloo sauce wasn't allowed to mix and marry for some time like it needs before being served.

1150554,2010-08-04,0,ohz8ljVxcZMo2bMGrBZfgw,"Origin India used to be one of my favorite restaurants in Las Vegas, but over time, its rising prices and worsening service have pushed other Indian joints far above it. A visit today was the final nail in the coffin for my girlfriend and I, who both decided we'd probably not be coming back much anymore.

Let me get this out of the way: the food is still good, generally, the atmosphere is upscale-but-comfortable, and the service is professional and courteous. But ... 

The menu has been changed recently, forgoing names of dishes for lengthy descriptions that make finding what you want a challenge. It seems like a deliberate effort to Americanize/fancy-up further the menu. As well, the leaning toward the gourmet seems to have pushed up the prices yet again, as the restaurant offers nuanced, fusion fare beyond Indian-spawned dishes. The gastronomical experiments may please foodies. The deviations from the traditional do not please this eater, however.

One of our favorite items at Origin, regardless of anything else, has always been the vegetable samosa, an appetizer staple. But on this recent visit, the restaurant's traditional purse-shaped, doughy treats were replaced with thin, triangular samosas, similar to what Trader Joe's sells frozen, only not as good.

The service was slow (though it always seems to be slow at Indian restaurants for some reason, so that may just be a cultural difference in pacing), but it took extra long to get things like drink refills, despite a relatively calm lunch time, and when we presented a gift card to pay for part of the meal, it took about 10 minutes and two people to figure out how to get it to work.

Firstly we ordered three orders of chicken makhni - the chicken was really hard and not cooked properly, the flavor was so missing, it was just like having a cream sauce in tomato puree with some chicken pieces in it.

Next night we ordered saag paneer and chicken karahi and some naans. While the saag was just about ok the chicken dish was totally pathetic. The meat was not blended at all with the rest of the stuff - i wonder how can an indian restaurant make karahi chicken without any flavor. 

The decor there is really good but you have to have the food quality to go with it and Indian food with no flavor - its a sin. I hope the owners will pay some attention to the food as well along with the decor.",K_D8wdKjuoHGz2nLX98lEg,0,0,2,gOA-e3OMud4cGon88e_asQ

So we ordered the usual beers (Cobra and Kingfisher) and had a mild heartattack at the cost of a small beer...ok i unerstand that this stuff is shipped from India and all that, but i can buy the same beer at Lees for cheaper...well the resturant charges us $6.00 (domestic was $4 and other imported beer like corona was $5) So we supped our beers very slowly! 

As always you get a ""freebie"" plate of popadoms and chutneys, their chutney selection was mint and some sort of brown sauce...still not too sure what was in that one....but we were very disapointed not to find the usual onion salad and mango chutney in the selection!

The menu is quite limited, you won't find the standard tikka masala, rogan josh, or aloo gobi here my friends. The menu seems to be aimed more towards the veggy market, and seeing as the whole point of curry was a strong sauce to over power the taste of rotten meat (it's true check your history books...look for some time around the British Raj!) the meat side was very limited...a bit of chicken, prawn, fish and lamb.  

All of the main dishes come served with rice, salad, naan and a veggy side dish.....which no matter what you choose turns up as yellow or black lentils!!! The curry is quite a small portion and comes set on your plate (there's no sharing here!) the rice was just plain white...what happened to the balsamic i hear you cry? The salad was mainly red pepper (3 slices) and cucumber (4 slices) on a warm lettuce leaf...yum appetising *blee* 

On our table we ordered the Safed murg korma  (which tasted like Cambells chicken soup), the Murg makhani (which actually wasn't too bad as long as you ask for it hot!) and the Aloo nazakat (which looked and i'm positive it had the same texture of baby sick!) 

The total cost of the meal was $120, that was made up of  the 5 beers and 4 curries; all in all i believe it was over priced with tiny portions!

Sadly it looks like i'll have a bit of a long wait (or a 10 hour plane ride) for my next curry!!",0_dLB7aYv_yCRg13g3cs0g,2,2,2,YuWjIr_e9IYImTievYFXHw

4480 Paradise Rd
Las Vegas, NV 89169

My son and I, who love to try new things and also love selecting favorite ethnic restaurants, have been hitting the Las Vegas India food places.  Most seem to lie in the Tropicana/Paradise area of town.  We tried many of the hole-in-wall lower star restaurants first with not much liking, and now we're trying some of the 4-5 star selections.  Origin India is our third 4-star restaurant to try this week.  We feel our results are better if we compare all of them fairly close together.  We ate here today at about 4pm for dinner service.

Things we are noticing that seem in common for the India restaurants is most service is pretty slow and most food is served lukewarm.  We believe this is a cultural thing with newer restaurants that have opened in Vegas, while the ones that have been here for a long while seem to be Americanizing with better service and hotter temperatures for served food.  But our selections are based on the taste of the food and at least moderate service.

AMBIANCE:  The ambiance of the restaurant was very nice.  The room was large and filled with tables but not crowded together.  A large television set was showing India music videos but it was turned way down so as not to disturb diners.  The tables are set up to show off a little elegance with cloth napkins.  It looks extravagant but yet the prices are not extravagant.  We arrived at 4pm and it was 103 degrees outside, yet inside it was very cool.

SERVICE:  I prefer service with a smile.  It's nice when it looks like the workers enjoy their place of business.  Our hostess/waitress smiled and was very pleasant.  Our waiter/check bringer didn't smile but did provide refills in a timely manner.  Surprisingly, the food was served quickly compared to our other experiences where it took over thirty minutes to receive the first of several dishes.  Our food came out at the same time along with the appetizer.  And the food was a little better than warm, certainly not lukewarm as we usually expect and receive it.  It wasn't hot but it was much warmer than we've been receiving it in other India restaurants.

FOOD:  For drinks we had water and tea.  I asked about flavored teas but was told they only had regular ice tea.  The tea was fresh and good.  We ordered Keema Nan ($4.95) which is naan bread stuffed with ground lamb.  Sorta like a flat bread but the lamb was inside the bread.  Delicious!  I ordered Chicken Karahi ($15) listed under chef's specialty low spice heat which is boneless chicken stir fried with bell peppers and onions with a thick tomato paste-like sauce.  My son ordered Lahori Goat Korma ($15) high spice heat which is goat braised in a spicy ginger-garlic sauce and finished with fried onions and yogurt.  The food was served family style filling two five inch round bowls about three inches deep, to over flowing.  The Chicken Karahi was delicious, only mildly spiced just as I asked and had a surprising amount of meat in it compared to most orders we've requested.  The Lahori Goat was bland.  We tasted neither ginger or garlic.  It was laced with small bone pieces which made it difficult to eat, and although it was selected for top spiciness, my chicken was spicier than it.  Also the Goat did not come with fried onions or yogurt.  Although I doubt that would have helped the dish.

The total for the meal was just over $28 (not including tip) since we used an Entertainment Book coupon for $15 off.  So the prices were good, but the food was hit and miss.  Plus they did not offer ""Buttered Chicken"" which I was hoping to try.",jvmB9pym9-VVf-TBOUMGeg,1,1,4,Wc3v_whEYW0AE9eFepcX6g

We entered and we were immediately impressed by the decor and ambiance. They also had some nice music playing and flattering lighting. 
The restaurant may be struggling as they had a Groupon deal running when we went there and also have a Yelp $15 for 20 running right now.  The issue could be with their pricing. The entrees were about $15+ for vegetarian and $20+ for Non-vegetarian. Typically, either bread or rice is included with entrees, but here it was separate. So its like they have 'on the strip' prices for an off the strip restaurant with less value. Nevertheless, we liked the food, service and ambiance. The server/host was welcoming, he made it clear from the beginning that he can only accept one Groupon per table (we had 2) which is a fair policy. Despite applying the deal, there was no difference in service. We ordered the tadka daal, aloo paratha and some chilli paneer. Out of which, I would rate chilli paneer the lowest - as it tasted more indo chinese and was super sweet. The daal was really nice and aloo paratha was fresh and not frozen crap. Our friends tried the chicken and lamb and also liked it. Our Indian food standards are pretty low coming from Austin, TX - but we had just returned from India so the taste of amazing Indian food was fresh in our minds.

I have called this restaurant twice in the past 10 days to make reservations and each time I was greeted by the work ""Hello"", not thank you for calling Origin India, how may I assist you or something a little more professional than just a hello. 

Last night, after waiting 30 minutes to receive our food (mind you that there was just one other couple besides us in the restaurant and almost 6 waiters working), the tall waiter with glasses (I didn't catch anyone's name since the staff members do not introduce themselves) sticks his thumb in our chicken tikka masala while serving the food which was disgusting!! Then he places the food on the table and simply wipes his thumb down with a handkerchief in front of us. Needless to say, although we paid for the Chicken Tikka Masala, no one touched it. I wished that the health department was present to witness such a disgusting act by a restaurant employee. 

After we finished eating and left a 20% tip for the poor service that we received, no one bothered to say thank you or even acknowledge that we were leaving. 

In fairness, I have eaten at this facility while the owner was present in the past and had a better dining experience; however, the previous 2 visits to this restaurant have been totally unacceptable. 

The 2 stars are for the Tandoori Chicken, otherwise I would give 1 star for everything else including the service. If I were the owner, I would tell the staff to spend less time watching television and spend more time attending to the customers.

I suppose consistency is important, but the restaurant is only 2 years old, and they've gone through a number of adjustments which may account for the fluctuations in quality. All I can speak to is what I ate, which was superb -- the best Indian I've had in Las Vegas, everything tasted fresh and not too heavy, like some Indian food. I suppose it helps that I was dining with one of the owners, who talked to me about the idea behind the restaurant: to mimic the Indian restaurants in England (2 of which they own) and use fresh, high-quality organic ingredients. She'd kinda hyped it up so much that I was dubious until the food came and spoke for itself. 

We had some mussels seasoned with Indian spices and coconut milk. I don't usually like mussels, but these were delectable. Everything else surpassed expectations. Naan was piping hot, doughy, and fresh out of the oven. Chicken makhani, the crowd favorite, pleased my palate like a good Indian curry should. The garlic shrimp curry, fish kabob, and lamb curry were equally fantastic. Kinda expensive, but helps when you're not paying!

I went again this week and I have to say it just didn't live up to my memory. The food was ok. That's it just ok. 

Had a fried scallop appetizer that was heavily coated and locked its fried breading prison begging to be set free. Had a lamb appetizer that was good, spicy but good. I like spicy. 

Had mushroom truffle naan. It was tasty. 

Had the striped bass entree. As a heads up it is pan fried served with all of its bones. Which is fine with me but the waiter could have let me know or given me a side plate to put all of those bones. I enjoyed the flavor but again it was really oily. It could have done with a touch less oil used a hotter pan when cooked to prevent the absorption of all that oil into the fish. 

The hubby had lamb which I tasted and it was average. 

At the end of the meal the hubby had an after dinner drink. The waiter offered me one which I declined. I was never brought a dessert menu. Maybe they don't have dessert?

I made online reservations but they were not needed at all, the place was all but empty. We had to wait while the manager interviewed a prospective employee but that turned out bad, voices were raised and we were caught in the middle. Oh well.

The ambiance was nice, the lighting was low but not like dining in the dark like some places I have gone. As we were seated we were given the wine and drink menu and the dinner menus. A quick note: the menus were dirty and stained from drinks or whatever. This was immediately off-putting because in a place with as high a Zagat Rating of 26/21/21 I would have expected more. OK, maybe I expect too much.

So, the option, bottled or LV tap for water. Let me say up front, I am not paying $8.00 for a bottle of Pellegrino (price not listed, so I am assuming)  that is $2.00 in the store. Local is fine thank you. Am I cheap? No, I am in this restaurant, but I am thrifty, no need to be hosed. Then it took 5 minutes just for water to be served and another 10 minutes for Iced Tea. The tea was a black tea, refreshing, but not unusually so.

I think the staff had to be bored as we had like three different waiters. I was not certain who was serving what and that felt a little odd. We went on to order the Raisin and Apricot Naan which was delicious and an appetizer of Chicken Tikka that was very good. I am not sure it was actually Chicken Tikka, it was not spicy at all except for what looked and tasted like spice grape leaves holding the appetizer to the plate, but it was good.

The entree for me was a Moulard duck leg confit coated in ginger, garlic, cinnamon, honey and orange zest, served with butter poached potato and sweet and sour kumquat marmalade and my wife had Southern Indian style diced lamb stir fry diced lamb stir fry with curry leaves, black mustard seeds, whole Kashmiri chilli and coconut, served with lemon rice. Here is where Origin India shined. Both plates were wonderful to look at and the taste was marvelous. They have earned the 26 Zagat Food Rating (should be 27 in my book).

For dessert we tried the ""Indian Donut Holes"" and while tasty, a bit of a disappointment. Oh well.

The atmosphere was disturbed while we were there by a guy yelling into his cell phone. If I had my way cell phones would be discouraged in a fine dining establishment, they are so annoying. But management just let this guy yammer away even when they saw the dirty looks we and others in the restaurant were giving him.

In all our dining experience was about two hours and that was expected. I have to admit that although the food was superb, they overall experience lacked polish that for the prices charged I would have expected. They attempted to provide a high dining atmosphere but fell short on the details like not replacing silver in a timely manner and by letting drinks to be emptied before refilling. I did not expect the classic ""crumbing the table"" but the little things seemed to add up.

If the prices were a little more reasonable for the experience I would be a frequent diner, but the tab was a bit too steep to make it a regular thing.",h2Ph6OQiFTY1J6CtRWJzLg,0,0,4,Jt3BjJV-rEU_tJEjECgcmg

The staff is very polite, and - if their demos at Whole Foods are any indication (thanks for turning me on to the expensive pink Himalayan rock salt that tastes like regular salt but looks so cool that I still lust after it, SIGH!) - the chefs are genuinely thoughtful about the menu and not just trying to be different for the sake of it.

Alas, I've failed to get an ""ooohhhhh YEAH"" out of anything I've eaten at Origin.

The paneer ""in creamy tomato sauce"" was quite tasty the first time I had it, before I'd eaten a *lot* of paneer dishes, but on the second visit it was just ""nice."" Not decadent, not lapping at my tongue in flavor waves, just nice.

Paneer tikka as an appetizer was wonderfully described on the menu, but what was set before us was just kind of dry and tasteless. Samosas were beautifully presented on both visit, but not especially aromatic or unusual.

(For the prices, compared to other Indian places in Las Vegas, I want a little extra dazzle, you see.)

I avoided the vegetable dumplings on the second visit because when I had them before I found them very heavy and dull. But the baked baby eggplant I had instead didn't really deliver the variety and complexity promised by the menu description. It was, well, also kind of heavy and dull.

Maybe I'm ordering ""wrong,"" but it's so easy to please me with Indian cuisine and any attempt at innovation that not finding a reason to go back to Origin makes me genuinely sad. The menu still looks so delicious! And, although service was slow and a bit inattentive on the busy night when we visited for dinner, the staff do seem so nice. (Note: the middle of the dining room can feel claustrophobic in the small space if it's busy. Hold out for an edge table.)

But the taste just doesn't deliver for me, and the cost doesn't justify a third chance, even with a coupon. (And these days there's always a coupon.) Maybe it's just the vegetarian items, but unless you're staying at the Hard Rock across the street without means of transportation, I'd try a few other places before going to Origin.",l9YOhaPYvTJi_qfD3Y-wBQ,2,1,3,mz3neeVWkLPCodfsSy3CzA

We each had the lunch buffet which had about 6 warm dishes and 3 cold dishes. I had mixed pakora, basmatti rice, dahl, soup, lamb curry, spicy fish, chicken curry, naan, and raita.

The naan seemed a tad under cooked. The lamb was very tender. The pakora was good but on the soggy side. The soup was tasty. The rest was rather forgettable.

My wife got a mango lassi and she said it was one of the best she ever had.

Even after our Groupon, the bill came to $15 for the two of us for two lunch buffets, a mango lassi, and a diet Coke. The food was okay but I've certainly had better Indian food. For the price, I did not think this was a good value, and I have no plan to return.",wc4XAA5pC3b1UgooSypHwA,1,0,2,r7Z82Q9fpTDvNSRLzQGa0g

The lunch buffet pricing seemed a little high and there weren't too many people in the restaurant. If this restaurant wants to gain additional returning local customers, they should offer several lunch specials to bring people in, then they can discover what the buffet is about. Drinks were refilled many times in a short order so that was nice.

I know I'm a bit late, but growing up, neither of my parents appreciated Indian Cuisine, so I never got to taste it til recently! And verdict is, I love it!

I found out about them through groupon and both times came during dinner. The servers are really professional, but might I say a little too professional if that makes sense? Somewhat uncomfortable and stuffy but very polite nonetheless.

HYDERABADI CHICKEN  $16.00
Chicken cooked with southern Indian spices and coconut milk sauce that is not too rich with a subtly sweet warm and spicy flavor. My favorite!  Super flavorful and moist, not too spicy and the coconut sauce had the perfect rich consistency.

DILWALA MURGH MUKHANI (Chicken Mukhani) $16.00
Tandoori chicken tikka in a tomato and cream sauce and finished with butter. For some reason this dish reminded me the best fusion between Indian and Italian food you could think of. Rich sauce again, and       similar spices and flavors to the Hyderabadi Chicken.

BHATTI KA MURGH (TANDOORI CHICKEN) $12.95
Tandoor roasted organic chicken in freshly grounded exotic spices, served with mint and tamarind chutneys. A little dry but great flavor, not overly salty like I've had and other places.

DAL BUKHARA $12.95
Black lentils delicately spiced and simmered overnight then finished with a touch of cream and butter. Definitely one of my favorite Vegetarian dishes. As you can tell I'm a fan of creamy and rich lol 

VEGETABLE SAMOSA (Vegan)  $7.25
Seasoned potatoes and peas stuffed in a triangular pastry fried and served with mint and tamarind chutneys. High five for being vegan! The mint and tamarind chutneys were the perfect pairing for these little flavor bombs.

Everytime I've come here, I think 3 or 4 times already? All times have been consistent in great flavors, service and presentation. I'll definitely be back!

1. Only one waiter was competent and seemed to have the ability to do stuff like take orders, manage the bar, print the check.
2. Drinks took 15 min to arrive and the complementary papad and chutney took 20 min
3. Order took 40 min.. and it was not complete.. after 40 min the waiter comes and tells me that some ingredient can't be found 
4. The waiter tells stories.. customers dont care why food is late or why it is not available.. if it is not, the restaurant has to inform.them.on time and not after its too late to leave for another place
5. The remaining staff was useless. They could not convey simple requests like request for checks or serve food properly (idli came without chutney and we had to ask)
6. Lack of consideration.. we did not get the medhu vada we ordered and were informed after 40 min.. my mother ordered idli instead.. they served stale microwaved idli and still charged us.

The only redeeming point was that the food was good. However I was so hungry by the time the food came I would have eaten a shoe.",-HpgwJUVN1RK5tP5U1dDOw,3,0,1,s81jjV18--SdYKmlaossEQ

The Cabana Salad with added chicken tikka ($10.50) was disturbingly poor. First off, for it to be even a $8 salad (w/o the chicken added) is insulting. It's similar to a side salad you get at McDonalds (yes, this exists). It even had shredded cheddar cheese on top. I'll repeat this. CHEDDAR CHEESE and chicken tikka. Together. WHY? To boot, the tomatoes were wilted, the chicken tikka was dryer than a popcorn fart and I would comment on the dressing but they forgot to give it to me. So, know this going in, they can't even make a salad right... and it costs over ten dollars.  

The rest of the meal was a step up (how could it not be?) from the salad. The Chana Masala was average (a bit greasy) and the naan was baamb. 

My advice? Grab an order or two of naan and dip it in your fave sauces at home. Better yet, find a place that makes great naan and something else to dip it in. NEXT!",NRGJ4IvauajqqCbhT640cw,16,5,2,AgXmdNQqPqgz3mhdROcVAQ

At Origin India, the decor is simple and chic with Hyderabad written all over it. Contrary to the popular Indian buffet, Origin India offers an a la carte menu. 

Dishes on the left side of the menu with ""Traditional Dishes Served Family Style"" come without rice. Dishes on the right side of the menu under ""Entrees"" come with rice. I recommend ordering from the left side, then getting a side of rice. It comes out economically more friendly and portions, according to the server, are equivalent.

IF you're an herbivore, they're vegetarian-friendly and will have provided you with (V) next to any items that are vegetarian. They also have a vegetarian menu slipped in the middle for your green delight. 

To the food...

Home-style chicken curry scented with kaffir lime leaves and smooth onion tomato sauce: I was curry-ous to see how this dish would turn out. My curry hopes were curtailed and there was much more tomato flavor than I would have hoped for. The density was just right, perfect for dipping naan, and if one enjoys tomato sauce with naan, one should order this dish. I, for one, was still curry-ous afterwards.

They have an amazing selection of naan. Their naan is very aromatic with the oven's flavor baked right in. I ordered the

Cheese and Chilli Naan: great oven-baked flavor, very cheesy and went well with the tomatoey curry. Fluffiness with stretchy paneer... yum

Dal Makhani: black Urad lentils cooked with garlic, butter and cream; these bad boys were so delicious, spiced just right with a savory lingering flavor even after you've swallowed. This was on the Vegetarian menu, but we got it as a side, so it was only $7. On the bill, it showed up only as $6. Score! Every dollar saved is another dollar to eat some more!

I intertwined my meal with a tasty

Mango Lassi: smooth and frothy yogurt with natural mango flavor to tantalize my tongue.

As tasty as this drink was, the next dish I had which is the

Oven-baked baby eggplant in Hyderabadi sesame, peanut sauce tempered with curry leaves, mustard seeds and whole red chillies: but it was so disappointing. I only tasted sesame seeds and peanut sauce, but they must have forgotten the pinches of salt.

This dish was made up for with the Vermicelli Pannacotta. Three squares of vermicelli creme with lychee jelly... like something someone would think to make on ""Chopped.""

The menu echoed the mix of tradition and contemporary, including staples like samosas and Rogan Josh, but was also had unique offerings such as Atlantic black cod and Grilled Canadian rock lobster. Everything we ate was delightful and the service was great too.

We went around 4 pm on a Thursday. It was a ghost town - nobody else was in there. Due to this observation, we immediately thought it was one of those restaurants that close in between lunch and dinnertime to partake in the ""siesta,"" but our waitress promptly darted out and greeted us, seating us at one of the many empty sea of tables.

First impression: Fancy and proper table settings (the silverware already set, along with a water goblet, and the pyramid napkin-fold). Also, the leather seats exuded an executive-style feeling to the whole atmosphere. Very nice and well-kept.

I had the PALAK PANEER and my boyfriend had the KALI MIRCH KA MURGH. We shared some naan bread and steamed rice between us with our main dishes. Our waitress made me a sample shot of the MANGO LASSI, which I ultimately ended up getting. (Its consistency is like yogurt for those that don't know. It was a nice contrast to the entree.) Overall, we both agreed that the food was very good - tangy infused with spices, flavorful and fresh. Even his ginger ale seemed like it was just made from scratch. Our taste palates were satisfied, and our waitress (having just one table to attend to) was very attentive. People slowly trickled in as we finished. I found out that there is a happy hour at 5. 

My only COMPLAINT: The prices seemed a bit high, especially for an off-the-strip restaurant. If you look at its surrounding neighbors, you've got a Johnny Rocket's on one side and Paradise Cantina on the other. There are many Indian places near the vicinity of the university, and this ranked higher on the price scale. My dish was priced okay at $12.95, but my boyfriend's dish was $16 and his ginger ale was $4.50. It seemed to me more like a dinner. (Browsing the menu, some dishes went into the high $20-$30 ranges.) Our overall tab would have been about $50 for two people for just a late lunch. Luckily, I had a $15 certificate to use. I guess you're paying for the ambience.

 (Side note: The bathrooms are amazing! Just the right finishing touches and amazingly clean! The ladies' room even had sample hand salts to use.)",HcT3BZLc25R9eekoHBA1MQ,2,0,4,wOnklDJXTucP2Eh6pYiFsw

Compared to the more rustic Indian restaurants I've encountered, I would say the food here is bland. But if I had no point of reference from which to stake a comparison, I'd say the food is tastefully seasoned.

I started with the grilled paneer tikka appetizer: a mildly seasoned tower of fresh cheese. I loved getting little flashes of char from the grill on my tongue. The tikka sauce was sparingly placed on the plate. It was satisfying yet light, and also not terribly flavorful. I had the chicken tikka makhani as my main course. Paired with the garlic naan, it turned out to be tasty, but once again lacked any real punch.

The dining atmosphere is quiet and elegant with a pleasantly minimalistic decor. I would eat here again. The menu options are unique and I'd like to explore them a little further. However, I left the restaurant feeling slightly ambivalent about the food.

We don't go out to Indian food very often because it is soooooo overpriced in vegas and we often make our own instead.   We tried it because of the groupon.  The service was disorganized and not the friendliest.  I think only one guy actually smiled.  Our child has a lactose allergy and the waiter told us they could separate out the cheese naan.  They forgot.  There was confusion about where they put the groupon and our bill had to be redone.  Nothing too big a deal but the lack of friendly attentive service was surprising considering the expense.  The food itself was some of the best we have had in vegas.  There are not that many good Indian places here.  Don't know if I would go back considering the prices and mediocre service.  BTW if a decent Indian place ever opened with significantly lower prices like they have in other cities, we would be there EVERY week.  I don't know whats up with the jacked up prices for Indian food.  We end up going out for Malaysian or Aftican food as an alternative that is more affordable.

(This dinner was for 2)
Appetizer
Chicken thigh tikka-This was very juicy but tasted different than the ones that I had before.  This appetizer is a little bit small for 9 bucks though.

Tandoori Black Tiger Shrimp - This was so sweet and yummy...will order again.  Shrimp lover must try.

Entree
Karahi Goat-Portion is smaller than other Indian restaurant that I have been to.  Flavor was decent, but of course, I asked for a plate of raw onions and lemon wedges and it brings out the flavor even more.

Fresh garlic & corriander naan and roti-very fresh and good!

We had bought an icecream birthday cake that was pretty much hard like a rock (didn't let it thaw enough), and the server was very kind to slice up the cake for us.  The service was very wonderful here.  It is a bit sad to see that this restaurant was a bit empty on a Friday evening.

We have been in there so often, the host/server said ""welcome back"" as we walked in and noted that we hadn't been by in a while.  This is my husband's favorite cuisine and he chose Origin India for his birthday dinner. As always, the food and service was great! We only had one very small issue: my husband and daughter ordered Vindaloo and the waiter told them it was ""very spicy"". My husband is very familiar with the dish and told him he knew the level of spicy and it was okay. The waiter , Tony, took it upon himself to tell the chef that it should be toned down. He did the same with my Chicken Tikka Masala when I told him I wanted it medium, not mild. As a result we didn't get the same Indian experience that we looked forward to; spicy and delicious. 

To those that think it is high priced have you ever considered that is more than just casual dining? Cloth napkins, change in plates and silverware between courses, etc...this is not casual dining.  It is a treat for us because it is not in our ""everyday"" price range, but I do think it is reasonably priced for the quality of food and level of service.

We will continue to choose Origin India as our go to for Indian food as well as recommend it to others. My Favorites: Chicken Manchurian (appetizer), Chicken Tikka Masala & Garlic Naan.",aCdzptysjZ9tFPj9DaOZsg,1,0,5,aDmvg7G7jXnuCC1Va2G5Hg

The food is expensive, especially considering that you have to pay separately for rice or bread. We ordered a chicken mukhani, a lamb nihari and a bowl of steamed rice. The chicken was flavorful and spicy, to my liking but the lamb was a bit plain that it made the lamb overwhelm the dish. Portions were a bit small for such an expensive dish that does not come with rice or bread. Service however was well. We had a living social coupon here, and even with that in our bill it was not all that worth it. Good for an experience but not worthy enough to come back.

Anyway, our our-of-town trips happen pretty frequently, and most of the time, has to involve a hunt for good Indian food.

I mean, any Indian restaurant for that matter, because in Yuma, we only got one. So, we are, obviously, locked in one that just one.

ORIGIN was so close to our hotel, right by Hard Rock Cafe, on Paradise Road. There were several restaurants flanking this place, so the parking lot was packed. But we lucked out and saw somebody pulling out of their spot.

Hubby has a ""great food radar"" it seems, because he suggested we tried the Tasting Menu for dinner. Our server recommended half meat and half vegetarian dishes (to accomodate my dietary needs). It was $45/pp. For a five-course meal. Yup--not exactly cheap. 

The pureed mixed vegetable was served in what looked like a shot glass--slightly taller. I thoroughly enjoyed it even when I kept scalding my fingers just trying to pick the glass up. 

The Naan basket was full of awesome goodness. We couldn't believe the amount of bread we got. 

Then we had a serving of three types of meat--all seasoned and grilled to just the right state of done-ness. The shrimp was fine, but the lamb was heavenly.

My favorite dish, of course, was the vegetarian curry. I almost forgot about the other vegetarian dishes that came with the curry. I tried to look for their names on the web but somehow, none of the items on the menu rang a bell, so perhaps, the Chef came up with some extemporaneous selections for that night. And we were the happier for it.

Now, the true GEM of the evening dinner, was Joseph, the bartender. But to call him that is truly inaccurate. I call him The Alchemist. 

I'm not even fond of martinis (never liked it), but Joseph's original concoctions, from fresh juices, herbs, spices, really intrigued me. He said that a good martini comes from a mixture of several types of vodkas or gins. He also said that Bombay gin makes a fine martini because of its herbal composition. I tend to agree with him, based on how magnificent the martinis he made for me turned out. 

So, for final thoughts--may be too pricey for the dinner portions, or for the tasting menu (but I'm charging it to experience). But a strong 4+ Stars for ""The Alchemist"".",H3bwp9vhosg3UuH-J9FXKw,0,0,4,X3Teh7AFGteZ1WYjKjgrWQ

The overall restaurant ambiance is nice and I remember the nice hostess seating us quickly.  Everything after that was kind of weird, to say the least.  Our waiter constantly kept trying to upsell us, which is good sometimes, but we were pretty set on what we wanted and he kept pushing us to change our mind for something more expensive (I eventually told him I'm not a fan of lamb nor any kind of meat because I don't eat meat and he stopped haha).  The food took a while to come out but it did and it was pretty good.  The samosas were a bit cold in the middle but I didn't bother to tell anyone because I was hungry.  I also remember the Indian tea to be really yummy so try that out the next time you're in there.

Also, for some reason, the staff were bickering at each other all night.  Our waiter was fighting with the bartender and the bartender was telling the hostess to tell the waiter to go away and leave him alone etc, etc.  I not sure what the bustle was all about but it kept getting worse and guess what?  The waiter forgot about us.  A younger dude (maybe a manager? owner?) kept coming over while we ate to ask if everything was ok as well.  I just nodded and continued to eat because after awhile because I didn't want to state the obvious and tell him about the problem between the staff or the samosas.

Finally, we were ready to leave and I called for the check.  At this point, the manager (?) was gone and we had to wait on our waiter.  It took a little bit because he went to the back for something and waited on some people coming into the restaurant.  I thought that was kind of odd.. he should have just given me my check and I could've signed it and been on my way.  But, Origin India does it different.  If you have a card (credit or debit) they have you use their CC machine at the table.  It was a bit awkward because it gives you option to manually put in a tip but I pressed okay and it automatically set me up for an 18% tip.  Now, my experience was nowhere near warranting an 18% tip but THE WAITER WAS STANDING RIGHT ABOVE ME waiting for me to press okay.  I felt weird asking how to go back on my tip for a more suitable tip so I just pressed okay and off the waiter went.

Overall, it was an interesting experience.  I hope the waiter became a little happier with my generous tip.  Not sure how I feel about coming back to this place but if I do, I know how not to get tricked into a 18% tip!",zB1GFKkXqn-vgoIgkjhPYg,4,1,3,3yoFeAWRa0n2ZpT_0Zog2w

Presentation and tons of flavor - not what we are used to seeing at Indian restaurants out here in Vegas. This review really teeters around 4.5 stars...

We started off with the Chicken Chili Stir fry and Lamb Seekh Kabob. Both had intense flavor and were SPICY (just the way we asked for it). 

Following appetizers, we had the Chicken Makhani and Rogan Josh. The chicken makhani was buttery -- just the way it should be! Now, I'm not too big of a lamb fan because of the weird gamey aftertaste it has but the Rogan Josh was out of this world. Tender, boneless and unbelievable. The naan was nice and fluffy (not the burnt kind you see at other Indian joints). They served us a plate of onions, lemons and chilies without us even having to ask!

I also ordered a side of okra which is my favorite vegetarian dish. It was good but not as great as my dad makes :)

The chef served us a complimentary dessert which was a little piece of heaven. Saffron poached pear with vanilla ice cream and an orange panacotta. Out of this world!

Some friends of ours who were in town were here on a layover after flying in some very rich and famous passengers.  

A dinner night was in order and I was excited to hear some tid-bits of their adventures.  We picked this restaurant due to convenience and walking distance to their hotel.

It was late on a Sunday night so the restaurant had only a few guests.  I didn't  have time to Yelp it but so happy to see many of my Yelp friends have been here giving it great ratings.

Service was very, very friendly.  Food was delicious.  Service was prompt and attentive.

Chicken Tiki Masala and lemon rice was fabulous.  We ordered some tasty garlic naan and it was soft, chewy and warm. Yum!

The side of rice that we ordered was enough for a table of four. I asked how big the rice bowl was and he motioned like it was a small bowl-but trust me-like us you'll have too many leftovers. 

We also had the stuffed mushroom as an appetizer and I wouldn't order it again, it was almost like a puff pastry with cream of the mushroom soup on top.  

We each ordered a dish and it was overkill despite our attempts to share.  Three beers, four entrees and an appetizer will set you back $135 so share share share and save save save.

A free Mango Lasee comes with a Yelp check-in so I took advantage of that-and I'm very happy that for free it was tasty. Thank you!

I was very disappointed that the carrot cigar dessert has been discontinued. That was the main reason I wanted to go today.

Pros:
- Can never go wrong w chicken Marsala and naan. 
- Samosa was yummy

Cons:
- Seemed like there was only 1 waiter and so it took awhile to get his attention
- By the time I got my platter, my food was not hot so eating it semi warm made it gross. The prawns didn't seem like they were well cooked or over cooked. Rubbery on the outside and a bit mushy on the inside. 
- Menu was too complex. Like most high end places I guess. I hate reading. Lol. Not a lot of choices

It's not a compliment...

That said, her intent was never bad -- she was just, well, bless her heart...

Best of the night, knock our socks off dish (and there was one) -- the Tandoori Lamb Chops.   I know, I wouldn't have ordered them either -- but they were really spectacular.  If you'll only eat rare lamb, get over it -- the ""overcooking"" is what made this such a standout -- I mean falling apart tender, melt in your mouth, finger licking good lamb (when was the last time you said that?)

The tandoori shrimp -- overcooked too and note to chef in the kitchen-- overcooking shrimp doesn't do anything for the critters...it just makes them mushy.

We also had tandoori chicken legs -- haven't seen chicken legs on a menu ever...they were good!  But not as finger lickin good as the lamb.   

Breads in Indian restaurants are almost always great -- these didn't disappoint.

No one does Poori anymore though -- why?  

I read on their website that they give discounts for UNLV students/faculty and if you're local -- but I forgot when the bill came... 

They had a fairly decent wine list which surprised us -- but years ago, my friend taught me to drink Long Island Iced Teas with Indian food and it's a happy habit that I haven't broken, nor frankly feel a need to.  I don't drink LIITs any other time, except with Indian food either -- so if you've not tried this little combo -- feel free -- just have a designated driver, and drink plenty of water...  Theirs are lethal!

We ordered one dessert -- probably because the cocktails made us giddy and stupid -- sweet, milky balls (yes, that was the name...)  Um...we should have stopped while we were ahead, but it was good for a laugh!  (Yes, we often have 2 year old sense of humor...)

If the people dining there are of the same national origin as the food, I know it is going to be authentic.  This was the case at Origin India last night.  The majority of diners were indeed Indian.  

My roommate and I went last night.  As we walked in we were greeted by a lovely hostess who was very friendly and seemed surprised that I had made a reservation.  Hey, I saw the option on the site and gave it a shot.  A reservation really was not necessary though.  There were plenty of open tables in a restaurant that, from the outside, looks small.  Just because there were plenty of tables available does not mean there were no diners.  There were several tables being used.  As we were seated towards the back of the restaurant I looked around and quickly felt relaxed.  It was dimly lit and I could hear Indian music playing softly in the background.  On the table was very heavy silverware and giant fancy folded cloth napkins.

Our server was very attentive.  He came by frequently to ask if we were ready to order and again to check if we were enjoying our dining experience.  We were.  I ordered the chicken tikka makhani in the entree size (smaller portion served with rice).  My roommate ordered the family size home style chicken curry.  We both ordered naan.  I got the wild mushroom naan with truffle oil while he ordered the fresh garlic naan.  It was not unlike a good fresh pizza crust.  It was fluffy with a slight chew.  Very good for sopping up the left over sauce from the meal.  My makhani was good.  The chicken was very tender.  The sauce has a great spice.  The basmati rice was light and airy.  Amazing.  The chicken curry was good as well.  The sauce had a strong tomato flavor.  It was not quite like spaghetti sauce but reminiscent of though it had a curry taste to it as well.  What made the curry good was the fresh cilantro added on top.  It was refreshing.

I am going to give Origin India four stars today though 3.5 would be most accurate.  The service could not have been better.  The food was very.  I enjoyed it thoroughly.  It is , however, priced high for the amount of food you receive.  I was not starving when I got home but I was not full either.  For $20 a person I expect to be full upon leaving and have leftovers to take home as well.  This was not the case.  Had it not been for my Groupon offer I would not have eaten here.

Hello Ma'am my name is Ganesh and I'm the manager over at origin India. I read your review about our restaurant and to be honest with you this is the first time I am hearing about this situation. Did you get the food delivered or did you pick it up from the restaurant. If you picked it up from the restaurant would you be able to describe the person that took your order? It seems strange that I have no recollection of anyone letting me know about these situations for I would have corrected it. We would like to get to the bottom of this situation because it is very damaging to our restaurant if this situation has happened. We would like you to come back and give us another chance for us to change your mind about our restaurant. Thank you for your constructive review and please visit us soon.

Sir, I appreciate your response. And I always feel horrible giving a business a bad rating, but it's a constant & consistent problem your business has. 

I've been to your restaurant MANY MANY MANY times and literally every single time the service was horrible!!! So I started to do take-out and then even the take-out was just a joke. 

So that's why I will not come back to your establishment which really sucks for me because I think the food is terrific! 

One note I will give, is one of the many times visiting, I attempted to use an opentable check, which is just like a travelers check. Which you are supposed to accept since you are on opentable.com
The servers and supervisor that night had no idea what it was and refused to take it. That was one of my many disappointing trips in. For future, I would suggest you educated your staff on ALL payment methods.

Typically food at the LVCC is just terrible and it's always the same boring food every day like pizza and burgers. So I was excited when I saw that Orgin India had a location inside the South Hall Las Vegas Convention Center. I discovered it during setup and could hardly wait for them to open up on Monday, during the first day of the show. What I really loved was the different menu for all 4 days. No food kiosk here does that kind of variety or even changes their menu like that. 

There were two options to order. For $13 you could get one meat choice & one veggie choice with rice, bread & sauces and for $16 you could add on two more items of meat & vegetable. 

On day one, I ordered the Chicken Makhani, Lamb Rogan Josh, Tadka Dal and mixed vegetables. I must say that everything was delicious. My favorite was the lamb because it was so tender. It melted in my mouth. I really loved the sauce from the Chicken and I mixed it in with all of my white rice. The lentils in the Tadka Dal were really good too. After finishing my delicious lunch I only knew one thing, that I could not wait to eat lunch here again tomorrow. 

On Day two, I ordered the Lamb Vindaloo, Chicken Karahi, Dal Makhani and Gajjar Aloo. The spices were all amazing again. But I thought I wasn't going to get lunch here because the line went down the convention show floor. Obviously word had spread about the amazing food here. The secret was now out. I thought about getting out of line but decided to stay. I must admit the staff served everyone fast and I had my food in no time at all. I was so happy that it all worked out. 

Then on Day three, I ordered the Chicken Curry, Lamb Tikka Masala, Sag Aloo and Chana Masala. Everything was amazing and such deep flavors. The potatoes and spinach in the Sag Aloo wouldn't win any awards for looking beautiful but for taste that dish was a perfect 10. Again the lamb was very tender like it had been all of the previous days I had eaten here. 

I was sad on Day Four because I could not make it over here to eat. I just hope that Orgin India continues making food at the LVCC for future trade shows. 

I also was lucky enough to get to meet the owner Raja. He was a very nice man and I also told him thanks for delivering delicious convention food. He told me that he had another food cart in the central hall. Wow he is a busy man. I also praised his choice of making different food every day. Raja suggested I try his mango yogurt drink called Mango Lassi. It was both refreshing and yummy, in fact I could have had this drink for a full meal. On my walk back to my booth a few people asked me where I got the bright orange color drink. It was a real attention grabber. 

I must also talk about the yogurt on the side. It is so good with fresh cucumber, carrot and spices. It is probably the best yogurt I've ever had. I was also amazed at the fresh herbs and spices they used to make the food. On two different days I found real cinnamon sticks inside the chicken dishes. There is nothing like fresh ingredients and it really shows in the taste. 

So if you are lucky enough to be attending a show at the LVCC I would highly recommend that you find either one of their locations. It's not likely you find Indian food on the show floor of a convention center. I am happy to have found this place and to have met Raja. I wish him much success but I know he doesn't need it because he cares about his food and his customers. He is a very rich man in my book. I look forward to my next trade show in Vegas because I know where I'm eating my next lunch.",CY9iLsE2z_yLhLqJdD1WGw,11,9,5,HcfR7GRKp_s0y4tPI6fCRQ

I ended up getting the lamb stir-fry with lemon rice. It was only ok though. Don't get me wrong, I would order it again, But the description seemed better than the dish. My wife got the stripped bass. It came as a whole fish with the head and tail removed. Skin on and bone in tact. The flavor was amazing, just a little tough to chow down on 'cause you had to be careful about the bones. We also ordered two appetizers (waiters recommendation cause of 2-for-1 apps during happy hour). First we had scallops, which came tempura style. all I can say is YUM! And then we ordered an item called lamb kebabs. Instead what came out wasn't your traditional kebab. it was lamb meat with all the veggies rolled together in a spring roll looking dish. Not fried, (i don't think) and spicy! For me it was on the border of being too spicy, my wife LOVED them. We also ordered a wild mushroom and truffle oil bread. Now that was just plain good. 

Result: Food 5 Stars

As for our waiter, I would have to give him 3 stars. The reason we came in was because Origin India sent my wife a coupon for a free entree which we showed him at the beginning of the meal. He told us that was could order only one of the entrees as the free one, none of the family style selections, ok thats fine. He left to allow us to look over the menu. We knew our appitizer order. He recommended us to get two even though we only wanted one cause it was still happy hour. Well when the check came both appitizers were charged for and when I asked why he said that we could only use one discount at a time! WTF! You told us to get two! We ended up having it taken off. Also, after more review of the check they charged me an extra doller than what was listed on the menu for my beer. 

The waiter was really insistent about selling my wife a cocktail. It got to the point of it being a little weird. She kept declining but he really pushed it. I understand up selling but after the customer declining at least 4-5 times, it was obnoxious.   

Over all I liked it. I wasn't going to this restaurant for human interaction and great service, I was going to eat here. and the food was great. If you do go, just review the prices and the check very carefully!",5z_-LEDdV_zStoVo2pQ3Lg,0,0,3,YFA8OP57W5bEvp-AZFYwlA

The restaurant is very attractive, modern, and upscale, and there isn't much in the decor to identify its ethnicity.  The lighting is soft and just right.  Our group filled most of the restaurant, but it's a testament to the very good service and attentiveness of management and staff that they were able to accommodate walk-in diners as well.

Our group was served a buffet that was set up on a large, round table covered with a tablecloth.  It was an elegant change to the usual steam table lineup.  All of the dishes available to us were vegetarian, most likely chosen by the organization for religious-ish reasons.  There were vegetarian samosas, first bite-sized, later replaced with standard ones, and they were very tasty.  There were potato fritters, naan, vegetable biryani, and a scrumptious paneer dish that was spicy, but not enough to induce fire-breathing.  Bowls of raita, and the standard coriander and tamarind sauces also graced the serving table.

Servers removed plates promptly and were constantly refilling water glasses, and the manager was present and hands-on.

Our dinner included a drink, but we had only a few choices.  I had a mango martini, small but delicious.  The restaurant has a full bar.

I looked at the menu for the purpose of writing a concise review.  Many of the dishes are unique to Origin India.  I've been to many, many Indian restaurants, and there were more than a few that I've never seen anywhere.  The descriptions were very enticing.

The food (we've only tried vegetarian dishes):
- Plenty-large servings (I have a good appetite and have never come close to finishing an entree, especially a paneer).
- Most vegetarian entrees are excellent -- flavorful and well-spiced (and relatively authentic; I always see lots of Indians here so it seems to get their approval too)
- Side rice dishes (the ones at $6 and less) are large but a bit plain; I've seen better at the same price at other Indian places.  The more expensive rice dishes aren't worth it, in my opinion.
- Good variety of veggie dishes, though two are a bit greasy (the Baigan Bharta and Bhindi Masala) and they don't have Mushroom Masala.
- Paneers are all very delicious, especially the Paneer Makhani and Paneer Rajastani which are exceptional.
- If you want them, you'll need to ask for the complimentary Papadum (those thin lentil chips you can snack on before your meal arrives).  They used to always be provided without asking but they apparently stopped doing that; however, they are happy to provide them upon request.

The establishment:
- Plates and silverware are very nice, NOT cheap
- Seats are well-cushioned, high quality, and comfortable.  Nice tables.
- Bathrooms have above average furnishings (granite counters, stone tiled walls)
- Good overall furnishings, subdued lighting, not too loud; excellent for a date or conversation
- Music is usually appropriate though once they were oddly playing 80's music

The service:
- There is never a long wait for our food, even when they are relatively busy
- Some of the waiters are a little on the reserved side (maybe it's an Indian thing?), but all of them are always very polite, friendly and eager to please without being overbearing.",ZCOFxoVUyNLntM056Egoew,4,0,5,90E_B_niV_lOYg6ZUxIQpw
4711577,2010-06-10,0,ohz8ljVxcZMo2bMGrBZfgw,"I rather hate Las Vegas. I mean, if I have to go to a conference for work, I guess I would rather it be in Las Vegas than say Dallas. But for the most part, I'm not a fan of the crowds, of the gambling, or really of the mind-numbing lack of choices in things to do and see. My food experiences in Vegas have been pretty sub-par. Until Origin India, that is.

I first found this place about 4 years ago, when I was last in town for a conference. And short of eating in homes in India (which, yes, I have done), it was the best Indian food in my life. I was introduced to the glories of beet and carrot halwa -- a dairy dessert made of beets and/or carrots. Sounds disgusting, right? It's not. It's delicious. And, I have dreamed of their halwa (occasionally I have literally dreamed of it) since then.

So I am back in town on business. And rather than eating at one of the places on the Strip, I hurry back to Origin India as soon as I can.

It's still delicious. But, it's not the same. I see from another post that there is a new chef. Perhaps that's the issue. I feared it simply suffered from too much exposure -- upon my arrival, I saw that so-called ""chef"" Rachel Ray had discovered the place, and that it subsequently enjoyed a rise in popularity. And, as so often happens with small places that get discovered, they sometimes rest on their laurels.

Don't get me wrong -- some of the things were still excellent. Their naan was fantastic, for example. And the channa was top-notch. But, serving the potato soup in a tall shot glass made for nice presentation, but didn't cover for the fact that it was kind of bland. And, it didn't really help the diner, as it never allowed the soup to cool to a low enough temperature to comfortable eat/drink it.

I ordered the tasting menu. And my main course -- the channa - was delicious. But other things just felt a bit sub-par. The sherbet served between courses felt good to the palate, but it was from the grocery. And the complimentary dumplings were just pakoras in a sauce.

So, Origin India, I still heart you. And I'm hoping you get your groove back, because I used to tout you as the best Indian restaurant in the country. And now, all I can say is that you are a great alternative to the poor choices on the strip.",VEe1XTxBnjZUY31EjQNbrg,0,0,4,nTNpoJBtrLMVaQZQVHMNvw

After a few bites, I have to run to a bathroom, and I pitched the rest of the meal in the trash. I didn't even get to the lamb.

It took an hour to come out, and people were getting their food way before us that came in after us. A very nice man came to our table to apologize for the wait and assured us he would take 15-20% off our bill for waiting. We thought this was very kind and didn't expect it at all. We didn't complain once for waiting, so really it was very surprising to us. Anyway, or food finally comes out and it was killer good. We enjoyed it very much, but when it came you refills on my husband water, the servic lacked. We had to wait a good amount of time for our bill but when it did come we explained we had bought their yelp $15 for $25 deal. The same kind man that said he'd discount or bill 15-20% was confused by their yelp deal and said he'd have to speak to the manager. Some time later he comes back and looks at it again and says he'll just take the $25 off. But then we no longer were compensated the 15-20% for waiting. Okay, fine we understand. Our bill AFTER being discounted the $25 was still $63!! So look at the receipt and see that we have been charged for a lot of things we did not order. We were charged for 2 vegetable samosa's, 1 kingfish entree, 1 tikka masala, 1 glass of merlot, 1 lamb entree (i can't recall the name), 1 other entree (i can't recall the name), 1 coke, 2 garlic naans, and another appetizer I can't remember the same of. I bright the receipt to our server and said hold on, you way over charged us. She knew immediately what we really ordered and ate and really changed our ticket which ended up being $24 after taking the $25 off!! But the extra shady part is is that she was helping the kind man with ringing out our ticket that they way over charged us for! I definitely think they thought they were going to get away with overcharging us. It is so disappointing because the food really was wonderful.

We walked in and the first thing I said to myself was, ""wow, this is nice."" The decorations were very well done, and it looked upscale unlike your typical Indian restaurant. 

Unfortunately, the lunch buffet was atrocious. There were very few choices for vegetarians, a rarity in Indian restaurants. The only vegetarian appetizer was the vegetable pakoras, which they had ran out of when we got there. They eventually made more, but we were already half way through our meal. To their credit, the pakoras were good. They had a half-ass salad along with some kidney beans. 

Both vegetarian sabzis were potato based: aloo matter and aloo gobi. Wouldn't you think not to make two very simialar dishes? It seemed like they forgot to put salt in the aloo matter while the aloo gobi tasted like there was twice as much salt as needed. The quality of the ingredients were good, but the taste was totally lacking.

Also, they had rice, but there was no form of dhal. Who eats plain rice? I understand non-Indians will just mix one of the sabzis, but if you are an Indian restaurant, please make the effort and don't cheap out. 

Finally, there was no dessert at all. What kind of lunch buffet doesn't have a dessert dish?

The service was bad as well. They clearly paid more attention to those customers ordering off the menu. I had to wait about 10 minutes to get my glass of water refilled, and there were only 3 other parties there at the time. 

The other good thing they had was their naan. It was delivered hot and fresh to your table, and it was done perfectly. The only  two things that were good were the naan and pakora.

We ordered the lamb skewers for an app, and then I ordered the HYDERABADI CHICKEN and my boyfriend ordered the Chicken Mukhani. Our server brought us an app but it wasn't the lamb and we didn't know until after we ate it. It was this spicy chicken and apparently the server accidentally sent it to the wrong table. They were super nice and told us to enjoy it and then they brought our lamp app out. The lamb was actually lamb patties, not skewers, and it was just ok.

Both of our entrees were simply chicken in a curry-type broth and then we got a side of rice. My entrée tasted exactly like this Thai curry that I make at home. LOL. I LOVED it!

It good but very spicy.  Which brings up the point, if the server tells you an item is spicy, take their word for it.

Lamb and vegetable briyani are fantastic as is the chicken curry.

If you're with a group, try the family style dishes.  Its more fun that way.

Oh yeah, it isn't as inexpensive as Rachael Ray made it out to be but its well worth the price.

5095383,2015-08-12,2,ohz8ljVxcZMo2bMGrBZfgw,"Great Buffet for lunch. I definitely want to come back for dinner. We stopped in yesterday since we were in the area. It did not disappoint. All the food was fresh, refilled continuously and plentiful for our small party. There are enough tables to get seated right away. Here you won't have to wait like other food joints. This is important when you only have an hour for lunch. 

I have had them at the convention center before and by all means, this buffet was the best deal off the strip. At $10.95 for the lunch buffet from 11:30am-2:00pm, I got enough to eat I skipped dinner. 

The service was impeccable. The wait staff was courteous and always refilling our drinks, bringing over more Nan and asking if we needed anything else. Right now, you get a free Mango Lassi (Mango Smoothie) when you check in. Lassi is a yogurt smoothie with fresh fruit and spices. It's thick and creamy and helps cool your palate if you are eating something spicy.  

The buffet had many choices, from traditional Pulao rice to 5 different curries and 3 choices of chicken dishes, salads, vegan dishes, and plenty of veggies to get your daily requirement. It was very filling. With our food came a large basket of 3 different kinds of Nan to dip in your food sauces. Nan is Indian flat bread used to eat your food (like a tortilla). All 3 kinds were delicious, Apricot and raisin filled, cheese filled and garlic & coriander topped. My favorite was the garlic. It added an extra kick to every savory bite of Chicken Mahkani I ate. I also tried the house salad, which is your traditional restaurant house salad for those watching their figure. The vegetable samosa has a little kick but tastes like a party in your mouth. It's too good not to try at least once. The Chicken Curry, Lamb Tikka Masala, and Palak Paneer were authentic and fresh. Hard to come by at a buffet. 

Dessert, where to we begin? (Yes I had dessert at lunch, YOLO!). To try something different beyond the typical chocolate lava cake you find at every restaurant (gag!), we went for the Almond Kulfi (thick creamy almond ice cream) and the Gajar Ka Halwa (Carrots with raisins and slivered almonds cooked in cream, served warm). It was delicious! You have to try it during your visit.

5097049,2011-05-23,0,ohz8ljVxcZMo2bMGrBZfgw,"So begin in Las Vegas for the first time ever, and being a lover of Indian food, decided to check out this place as per recommendations of fellow yelpers and a great review in the VEGAS magazine. Well... Brace for it.. It was horrible!!!! 

Firstly, the decor left alot to be desired. If your going to be in the restaurant business in Vegas, you really have to great decor, something visually appealing. Trust me the photos posted on the website make it seem like its nice...its not. After visiting many restaurants on the Strip, this one had me thinking "" wow..this looks plain"". Even though its off the strip, I have seen mom and pop shops that look better than this, however I was still interested to see how the food was.. 

The dishes we ordered were as follows: New Zealand lamb shank..veggie biryani..punjabi khadi..paneer tikka masala. The best of all these was the Lamb Shank..the meat was quite tender but the curry felt like it was just warmed up, didn't taste fresh at all. The veggie biryani was kinda sticky, not very flavorful. The punjabi khadi was horrible! It was so salty we had to send it back, after the waiter tasted it himself he agreed, the salt was overkill. Paneer tikka masala was your standard fare..nothing stood out. I would have to think that maybe the owners think they can get away with serving sub par indian food, since Im sure this restaurant doesn't get many people of indian origin visiting. 

So to sum it up, I have got to believe that Vegas has better indian food than this place. I'm quite shocked at all the positive reviews from some people! Maybe next time I will go to Gaylord Indian Restaurant at Rio.",0AnezUtzwmaeAYSMvDdLmg,0,0,2,ByD79JpF2bwh27mvnKtTbQ

I will say this - most of their food was good, but in my opinion, it was very overpriced for a reason unknown to me. I think sometimes it's because it's closer to the strip?? We paid almost $200. That's a lot of money in my opinion. I have a hard time with it because I can get just as good Indian food in a 100% comparable location nearby.

We came here on Friday night with some friends. We had 4 dishes, 2 appetizers and 5 drinks total. 

We had  -

3 beers
1 wine
1 Martini
Stuffed mushroom - Very weird for me. It was a very blunt taste of curry, yogurt and a uncooked mushroom that was breaded.
Saag Paneer - Very good
Shrimp Tikka Masala - Sauce was very tasty and rich. 
Lamb Rogan Josh - The sauce was okay. I felt they used a little too much curry and it over powered the dish with that and nutmeg.
Chicken Mukhani - We actually don't think this was the right dish. It came out and the sauce didn't taste like it normally would for chicken mukhani. It was a bit thinner and not thick like butter chicken typically is. 
Lamb Vindaloo - good flavor, nice and tender meat. 

Overall - the service was not good. It took us over an hour to get all of our food. Mainly because the waiter was not coming around to ask if we were ready to order. It was not busy, maybe 5-6 tables total. On Friday nights at 7, it's packed at a lot of places. So, that could be a sign if they're not busy. 
Again, the food was good - not amazing for a pricier menu. The location and the building itself does not call for higher prices. Neither does the service.",-xDW3gYiYaoeVASXywTPgw,8,5,3,9SaKMD05Ix8FBxZEOfm9jQ

To be honest, I'm really still an Indian cusine virgin.  My friends knew what to order so I just went with the flow.  Everything we ordered were tasty, but a little bit on the mellow side probably because I expected Indian food to be some what spicy (as in certain degree of tongue burning).  I can't even begin to name the dishes, but we had a lamb chop curry dish, and chicken curry dish, and they're both really good.  The chops were tender, and the spices were just right.  We also had some lentile soup, that was good too.  Then we had this thing that's almost like a spinach dip, except its mixed with butter/oil and chunks of Indian cheese that tasted like tofu!

I had last visited Origin India that long ago prior to moving to Vegas, and I had left disgruntled by overpriced, undersized Indian dishes that weren't particularly notable. We were lured back in by the Yelp Deal, and I am happy we decided to give Origin a second chance. Even though the menu is still a bit pricey, the dishes we had were well-executed and flavorful. 

My advice is to stick to the traditional vegetarian dishes, as at $11 they are the best value, and the servings come in a big, deep bowl. You can also get a half-serving, which is not skimpy either. We ordered the saag paneer, yellow dal and a mixed vegetable curry. Both the saag and the yellow dal were complex, savory and non-stop delicious. I wasn't a huge fan of the mixed vegetable curry, but my husband was. Our first order of roti hardened quickly, but the second order was okay. The flavor of our dishes was definitely the standout of our experience. 

Without our Yelp Deal, we could have likely had a decent amount of food for rather affordable, as two vegetarian dishes is more than enough. However, the specialty dishes are substantially more expensive between $20-$25. And, our service was spotty. When we showed up, the lights were still bright, and we felt as if were in a cafeteria. Then, we waited for a long time to be greeted by our server, even though there were staff joking around behind the bar. Once our server arrived, she was very kind, but our water ran dry. Plus, our order was messed up. They corrected it quickly and let us keep the errant dish, but for an environment this nice with these prices, I would expect a higher level of service and attention to detail.

As for the errant dish, it was black dal, and it wasn't as good as the yellow, but we enjoyed it as a snack the day after!

I definitely think this is an improved Origin India, and with the Yelp Deal and an extra ""oops"" dish, we definitely left satisfied.",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,17,9,4,Sg8_Nhnvd6OQA3yPsFC8-Q

Couple of things  I did not like -- 
1: Their service.  They are very very slow. We had to wait quite a long time after we ordered food.  
2: They did not greet well when we entered in restaurant. (Hardly anyone noticed)
3: We had to call someone to take order. No one came to ask whether we are ready for order or not. (we waited ~10 mins which is long time) 
4: After we finished, we had to call them for check. (we again waited ~5 to 10 mins)

They unpacked the food and gave us great service without any complaints or problems even though over the phone he had insisted they have it ready in 3 minutes. (Lol).   Then he asked for ice for the free mango lassi and it took FOREVER.  He was starting to get annoyed until we looked over and one of the staff was coming in from outside with two bags of ice.  They actually sent someone out to hurry and get ice for just us (they had just opened).  It was one of those man-did-I-have-the-wrong-idea moments.   

We ended up eating here three days in a row, which I am not suggesting but my husband loves tikka masala and he is like a 12 year old who could eat the same thing every day of his life.  The butter chicken, which is basically the same thing, was better than the Tikka masala so he ate that the other two days instead after trying mine.

5390814,2012-09-27,2,ohz8ljVxcZMo2bMGrBZfgw,"To continue with my exploration of Indian lunch buffets around town, I invited a friend from UNLV to check out Origin India's version.  My experience at Origin India prior was limited to one visit for dinner years ago which I was completely unimpressed with the flavors (or lack thereof) that I experienced then, but I was willing to give it another shot due to my having experienced much more Indian fare since then (I pretty much guessed what I wanted on that visit), and plus my Currygeous Indian Eats list here on Yelp demanded it!   Pro tip: it never hurts to plug your own lists or reviews within other reviews.

Upon entering, the dining room looked as nice as a I remembered it, and there were only a few other tables with diners which was a stark contrast to what I'm used to at Mt Everest or Mint.  Origin's buffet offering is new, so perhaps this will change over time.   In addition to less customers, another big difference was in the options of food.  I don't know exact numbers and maybe it was just perception, but it seemed like Origin had quite fewer dishes available than Everest or Mint.  

I've adopted a ""one plate"" rule with Mt Everest and Mint due to severely overstuffing myself each time if I don't, but Origin's plates are decidedly smaller so I allowed myself one return visit to the food offerings on this occasion (I'll use any excuse to eat more).  On my first plate I had some rice, chili mint chicken, some potato dish, goat curry, and a dish made mostly of peas.  I thought the flavors were quite nice on each one, but particularly was fond of the chili mint chicken.  It had quite a kick to it which I enjoyed and the chunks of chicken were nice and juicy, and this was all while having scooped out the last of what was in the tray in the buffet line.   This brings me to one of the issues I had: 15 minutes after originally going up for the first plate, I went back up and the chili mint chicken had still yet to be refilled.  Now normally in a buffet filled with a plethora of offerings, one item missing wouldn't be so bad, but with the shorter list of options and what is clearly one of the more popular items, I thought it was inexcusable it wasn't constantly being filled.  In fact, I didn't see a lot of freshening up of the options while I was there.   One could argue that due to the lack of customers perhaps not many of them needed more, but it would have pleased me much more to know that I was likely to be eating freshly prepared food than ones that could have been sitting out for some time.  I'm willing to excuse this a little given that they're new to the buffet game, so hopefully this improves over time.   

My 2nd plate since there wasn't any chili mint chicken to add to it ended up being fairly sparse with just some more rice and a couple curry options I hadn't gotten to try originally.  They don't have any sort of helpful guides on the dish name cards to let you know which ones are vegan/vegetarian friendly so proceed with caution!

It was a satisfying meal, and service was good with fresh hot naan brought out a few times and drinks refilled at a dizzying speed.  Price was about average (I think, to be honest I didn't pay much attention).  Ultimately though it's impossible for me to not compare it to Mt Everest and Mint for their as of now superior lunch buffet options.  Less options and less constant refills of those options along the line will lead to less visits from me to Origin.",v3YOx9T4jRSw8XP9Rd9H4g,3,2,3,KQ2MBiuRekmm-FxVA3_nhw

The appetizers we got were plated beautifully. The scallops were my favorite, nice and crispy outside yet tender and mild on the inside. The stuffed portobella mushroom was tasty too, I just would have liked it served warmer since it was deep fried. I had the lamb shank after being advised by the waiter it was much better than the lamb stir fry i ordered at first. The lamb shank was every bit of amazing as it was expected to be. The sauce was extremely spicy, flavorful as well as hot. I coughed after my first bite. The lamb itself was so tender it fell off the bone. I could cut the meat with my fork. My friend had the baby eggplant dish and loved it. Now I bring myself to the downer of this meal....the LACK of SERVICE! We were never offered refills on our drinks, yet our glasses of water were refilled continually by the busboy. Once we were finished with our meal we sat and waited for our check for over 30 minutes with our waiter nowhere in sight. Thank God my friend was so entertaining or else I would have been more upset. After 40 minutes had gone by I started flagging down anyone i could find to ask for our check. I asked the bartender, the hostess, the busboy...then finally our waiter appears and presents us with our check. The check was wrong of course because he had charged us full price for the drinks and apps he worked so hard to sell us on for happy hour. I could understand though since it was now 8:15. I quickly jumped up and followed him back to the kitchen and asked him if he could fix our check. His response was ""I will speak with the manager about it"" to which I responded ""We are in a hurry!"" Then he said ""Okay I'll take it off right now.""

Now we have our regular Indian restaurant that we love, but that is on the other side of town and we were meting friends close by, so Origin it is.

The decor is nice, the private dinning areas are very nicely done, a different tone from the normal Indian restaurant for sure, it would echo what was to come.

If you are expecting your normal Indian restaurant menu, you're in for a shock, however, on closer inspection, the regular menu items are there, just hidden behind the words of someone who had way to much time on their hands when the menu was put together.

For example :

Old Delhi style corn fed chicken tikka makhani prepared with ground spices and fenugreek flavoured tomato makhani sauce.

The vast majority of Indian places would simply call that Chicken Tikka Massala,  

But you get my point, study the menu and the regulars are there, also, the wait staff were more than happy to run through the menu.

There are also some ""non-standard"" dishes, but those will have to wait till next time as we were really in the mood for Indian comfort food.

So, Chicken Tikka Massala and Chicken Korma were ordered, along with a couple of plain naan and one Wild mushroom and truffle oil naan.

The food took about 15 minutes to come out of the kitchen, it then dawned on us both that they had not asked how hot we would like the curries, mmm, could be an issue, I like mine hot, but the wife likes hers very mild...Luckily for us, they were both mild, but then again (Indian food eaters are laughing) a Massala and a Korma really shouldn't be that spicy anyways.

The plain naan was good, the mushroom naan was very good, it actually made for a nice combination when eaten with the massala sauce.

As Frank S pointed out below, the flavours are very light and delicate, now, IMHO this is not a bad thing, especially when first being introduced to Indian food, the Korma was actually spot on, the massala needed a little more flavour to be just right.

So would I recommend Origin...Certainly, it is a decent Indian restaurant and even more so if you are just stepping into the wonderful world of Indian cuisine.

This place isn't the norm and it was just what we were looking for this evening.  

Having a $25 restaurant.com coupon in hand didn't hurt either.  AND we got a free appetizer just by checking in on Yelp! WEEEEEEEE!!!

What an excellent selection of vegetarian dishes!  My wife gets saag paneer at Indian joints like she gets filet mignon at steakhouses like she gets green curry at Thai restaurants.  EVERYTIME.  

I got the Khadi Paneer (House-made Indian cheese and mixed bell pepper cooked in tomato sauce) which was delicious however we were already at maximum paneer overload after the appetizer.  This was out fault for not thinking this through.  It certainly made for a great lunch the next day though!!

5827677,2015-02-09,5,ohz8ljVxcZMo2bMGrBZfgw,"Situated in an old but accessible part of Las Vegas east of The Strip, this restaurant is a short cab ride away from anywhere. Buffet was about twelve dollars plus drink, tax, and tip. Full bar available. Awkward entering the restaurant... the signage is good outside but when you enter it's like they have construction occurring in the foyer. Anyway, the interior is nicely appointed. They spent some money on chairs and tables for sure. The buffet was decently built up with my favorites: lamb curry, sag paneer, tandoori chicken, fresh-cut red onion, and mixed pickle (achaar). In fact, the food (especially the remarkable quality of the achaar) is worthy of recognition. The people running the restaurant seemed to have a skill at doing so: the waitress kept my water glass full and sat me within a decent amount of time, the six other personnel I  witnessed in various capacities seemed motivated, etc.

Why is this review 2 stars? 
A) This restaurant has a documented history failing health inspections, resulting in immediate closure, and
B) When I  went to the restroom... -My-Shoes-Stuck-To-The-Floor-. Let that ruminate for just a second while I  explain the baseboards in the restroom looked like they hadn't been wiped down in decades... And my shoes stuck to the floor. Shoes. Stuck. To the floor. Of the restroom.

This place definitely takes the cake.  My buddies and I were looking for a place to eat after a long night of drinking.  We figure, what else would be good but Korean BBQ for a hangover, but unfortunately, the Korean BBQ was closed and we settled for this place.

Upon being seated at this establishment, the waiter asked us if we would like to ""supersize"" our meals with lentil soup.  It sounded good, but the additional $6 cost for a small cup is unwarranted, and never mentioned by the waiter or the menu.  The waiter never even mention to us that the cup of BEAN MUSH was $6.  WTF?  You can buy a whole bag of beans for $6.  The management wanted to argue with us over this fact, so hence no tip and a bad review.  

The food is good, but the restaurant staff needs to tell their clients about ridiculous details of the ""supersizes.""  I can go for $2 or $3 dollar additional cost, but come on now.  We all know the restaurants in Vegas do this because they know you won't be back again.

White rice, tandoori chicken, vegetable curry, chicken curry, punjabi curry (not sure what kind of meat it was, it was mushy), fish curry ... a potato soup (which was really salty), fruit salad and plain naan. I guess back home they just have so much more to choose from ... samosas, garlic naan, multiple curries etc. The food was ok ... just lacked variety and used to garlic naan.
