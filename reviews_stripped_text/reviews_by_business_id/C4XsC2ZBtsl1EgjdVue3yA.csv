     We usually order 2 combo plate and one canteloupe drink, comes up to about $16 not shabby for family of 4 :)  kids love the menudo here and I like the pinakbet(vegetable stew) depending on how fresh the diniguan ill usually get a side of that also.

The server/cashier was very friendly and very helpful, he had a smile on his face for every customer. He even told a couple of jokes and pointed to me where the the nearest Goldilock's was. 

The food was good, it was a lot better than a lot of other Filipino restaurants I've tried. I ordered the pork adobo, pancit palabok, and bbq pork to go. All of it was good, I especially liked the bbq pork that I would order again. They also serve you the food a la carte style so the best time to come is early when everything is still fresh. The portions are huge too, I had a good amount of leftovers. 

If I am ever back in Vegas I am sure I will visit them again. They are very welcoming and they make you feel very comfortable.",AL7IdqT20KMwR_XfasRK_g,0,0,4,6tl0-lze_5ztUj3fdPC3jQ

I went Thursday last week, ordered my 2 items + rice to go, and looked forward to eating in the peace and quiet of my hotel room.  When I opened the container, the 2 scoops of rice had the consistency of lumpy mashed potatoes!  REALLY.  Whoever cooked the rice used 2x the amount of water and w-a-y overcooked the rice so that there aren't even any recognizable grains.   C'mon, we're Pinoys!  Rice is sacred and should be the one thing we can cook consistently.  After all, how do we enjoy the soup or the sarsa in the dishes (even if it is just the oil from the lechon)?  I was so disappointed.  How do you eat pochero (which was actually quite tasty) without rice?  I kept hearing my Lola's voice ""Hey, huwag mag pakpak!""  (LOL)  At least I had the upo dish as a veggie as balance but really - not the same. 

Oh, and this is not the first time I've had this rice problem.  But in the past, it was only slightly mushy.  This time it was BAD.  No way to redeem it.

So, I'm gonna have to say 'ta-ta' to PP and try one of the other LV Filipino establishments.  It was a good 5-year run.",ZBKKZeltFfzFM8_-M9sN9g,1,0,1,cirSmCvTnEZuFMIwY7EwtA

Firstly, the dishes were warm to cool except  for the comp broth.  The dinuguan had kind of an oxidized flavor--unfresh.   Secondly, the lechon kawali was hard and dry.  Thirdly, the other dishes would have been flavorful but were cool then only to be complimented by the cool rice.  We don't know if it was our timing or what but we were there during lunch hour both times.

Now I wish the managers would read this to reinforce my mention of the food condition to the friendly wait staff behind the counter.  The franchise is our favorite in Cerritos, CA--because their dishes there are always piping hot due to the high turnover of food(gets very busy).

I just don't like the fact during the slow hours of 3-6pm, they leave the food sitting out, and it looks dry. I don't know maybe there trying to save money by cutting back on food costs. I also don't like the fact that they don't have Longanisa every day. but then again, its really unhealthy, so maybe that's why. my personal favorites, are pork bbq on a stick, pancit bihon, beef caldereta and once in while lechon kawali. the sinigang soup is pretty good also.",3EKm38imhyCk3xcVVQbdZg,1,1,3,dBjVsQ9aSIZOsSIRVB_2RA

2409662,2010-01-04,5,C4XsC2ZBtsl1EgjdVue3yA,"I was very surprised by all the high marks this place got.  I just recently went here with my hubs and mom.  We were very disappointed on what we got.  We went here by chance because we needed to eat, I didn't exactly know where Seafood City was, and I didn't want to drive up and down Sahara.  Coming from SD and I have many selections of different turo turo (point point) places and never really came upon a place that wasn't good.  So I didn't think much of this place on not being good.  There were ppl inside eating...

First off, they make you get a tray.  The tray I got smelled like it was wiped with a wet dirty towel.  It had a disgusting sour smell and I didn't understand why they wanted ppl to eat with it.  The guy behind the counter was pretty adamant on us getting a tray.  I got the tray, but I didn't want to put my food down on it.  SO GROSS!

What I got:
I decided on their beef steak.  The guy asked if I wanted sabaw (okay, the sauce) on my rice, heck ya!  I just wanted one entree choice with my rice.  

Why it wasn't good:
First, the rice.  It seemed like old rice they reheated and put too much water on because it got too dried out.  My beef steak wasn't good at all.  The sauce of the beef steak seemed too oily and it didn't taste fresh.  It also tasted like it was cooked a long time ago and just reheated.  They just looked like they cut up fresh onion and topped with it to look like it was recently cooked. 

What the hubs got:
He got paksiw na lechon and sinigang na HALIBUT.  Yea, thats right, they put HALIBUT in with the sinigang.  I never had and now I know why.  If you're going to make any type of FISH sinigang...fricken make it with BANGUS!  I know they had bangus because they had one all fried up in the front.    

Why it wasn't good:
My husband is on of those filipinos who love really sour sinigang.  When he asked the guy if it was extra sour, the guy had no hesitation to say yes.  When hubs went to try it, the sabaw (soup) was barely sour.  He also agreed to not eat sinigang with halibut, it just didn't taste right.  As for his paksiw, that also tasted like it was cooked a long time ago and just reheated.  The sauce of the paksiw was way over powering and didn't taste that good either.

What mom got:
She also got the sinigang and she also got afritada.  I didn't taste it because I was already disgusted with my food and my husbands.  I doubt that tasted any better. 

I don't know if they were lazy to cook stuff for a Saturday evening and again and just reheated old food.  I surprised that so many ppl like the food from here.  But I will definitely not come here again and will make it a point to find Seafood City, because I heard there are more places to eat around there.

I like Lechon to be crispy, but for my gums to be tender after the first few pieces, I threw in the white flag. I tried to pick apart the skin and go for the meat and fat, but it was dry and by then, I decided to just settle for the Pork Adobo, the second of my two item combo.

2685905,2008-01-19,0,C4XsC2ZBtsl1EgjdVue3yA,"Some of the local Vegas natives are probably wondering why I gave this place a perfect 5 star rating. Please continue to read..

I'm not a Vegas native, I am in fact from the Bay Area. There are a good amount of Filipinos who live here obviously. I myself am Filipino, and as much as I try to support Filipino chains and small businesses, I am always disgusted by them. Why? Because they always seem like a rip off. Not only that, service is slow. Prices are high for below or average taste. And portions are extremely small for the price. It's also surprising how many people still frequent these Filipino restaurants we have here in the Bay Area that are Filipino and not realize the things I just mentioned. Perhaps they are blinded and skewed by the fact that they are supporting a local Filipino business, or maybe because they can't cook Filipino food. It must not be the latter because us Filipinos take so much pride in cooking those who know how to cook the dishes won't think twice to criticize the same dish made by someone else and how theirs is always better. Am I not right? I guess for your quick fix of Filipino food, we have plenty of choices here in the Bay Area, but they suffer from the previously mentioned. If I go to these Filipino chains, it's mostly for buying a Birthday cake or other pastries. The ship for buying regular entrees have long sailed. Be thankful for parents or other relatives who can cook authentic Filipino dishes. It's ashame that future generation of Filipinos who don't even know how to speak Tagalog will think this is good Filipino food for the price. If the price was lower or portions were grander sure no problem. But portions are small, and most if not all the food seems like it's just heated, and hell--they have no shame showing you that they just microwave them. To add insult to injury, Goldilocks (I'm not sure if they still do this practice), will weigh the food from the a la carte dishes to the palabok. Now why do these Filipino owned businesses and chains wonder why only Filipinos go to their stores and restaurants? If the Bay Area wasn't filled with so many Filipinos, I doubt these places would stay open. Vietnamese, Hawaiian, Thai have appealed to everybody recently, and have easily passed up Filipino food as general favorites for everybody. 

While in Vegas, for some odd reason we wanted to get some Filipino food. Not being from around here, we consulted the GPS. Having a GPS is very handy and I highly recommend it when going to places you are not familiar with, but thats an entirely different review on it's own. Pinoy Pinay came up so off we headed. I don't know the area nor it's reputation, but it wasn't too far off from the strip. It was in a small plaza center which seemed like it housed other Filipino/Asian businesses. The exterior was nothing special. It wasn't nice, but wasn't bad either. The ambiance of the interior was that of a typical fast food type of chain. There was plenty of seating arrangements and the space felt roomy. Never did I feel congested. 

Now the differences that I quickly realized were the prices, portions, and service of this place. Wow, its the 3 top complaints that I and other Filipinos and non-Filipinos have about Filipino restaurants here in the Bay. I should have got a copy of the menu and uploaded it, but I forgot to snag one. I can't remember in detail, but prices were very reasonable. Actually in comparison to those from your local Chinese fast food restaurant. The prices were actually CHEAP compared to those of Bay Area prices. But what good are the cheap prices of portions are small. No worries there, the portions were surprisingly generous from what I'm use to seeing from Filipino chains. Us Filipinos are known to run on Filipino time, slow and usually late. Here in the Bay Area, we prove that stereotype by exercising it in the workplace. It's in full effect in Filipino restaurants here. Jollibee, Goldilocks, and other Filipino places are very slow. Just because I'm Filipino does not mean I'm your relative or even your friend where you start talking to me like I've known you forever. A simple hello and small BS will suffice. I'm here for my food and time is money. The staff at Pinoy Pinay restaurant knows this, and have setup the food line in a efficient manner. One person manning a different station. It moved the line quickly and I was shocked that they were waiting on me. Over here in the Bay it's almost always the opposite. 

We went here before the afternoon on a weekday and even then it had a good amount of patrons. Mostly if not all Filipinos, but there was a token black guy that showed up. A black guy in a Filipino restaurant--that was proof enough for me. If the traffic was as it was when we came, I could only imagine during later hours of the day and on the weekends this place would be busy.

This place is what Filipino restaurants are not in the Bay Area, but what should be. What an example.",Qv0xMxEs9XHEqI_9zb8vcQ,3,1,5,zhQ6K1L_5qe0k0FZzMT0uA

One of my friends, however, got bad diarrhea from their halo-halo.  Anyway, I was there yesterday with a friend.  I now have a restricted diet so I did not order except for the buko juice.  My friend ordered lechon kawali and sinigang na halibut, which were fine.  My complaint:  the buko juice was not the real buko juice.  It was mixed with milk and hardly had the buko taste to it.  I knew there was something wrong at my first sip.  I went to the counter and asked it there was milk in it, and was told there was.  Now, how can that be buko juice!?  They're trying to dilute or replace the buko juice with milk?  I have never had buko juice this way!  They should have called it milk buko juice!  Some people are lactose intolerant or allergic to milk, and milk should be identified if it is going to be included in an item, especially buko juice that is not traditionally mixed with milk!  I did not touch the item after that and left it on the table.  They should warn their customers if some of their items are not traditionally made and ""creatively"" diluted!  These days, Filipino restaurants here are all over the place, and if a simple item such as buko juice cannot be done right, it would be very easy to go to the next competitor.",gZBAENqjq7Lq6TwO5lcFZg,0,0,2,WZNvLpFHLEvCJFQ3VK69ag

You'll enjoy the dishes Pinoy Pinay have ranging from Sinagang, Bulalo, Bangus, Lechon, etc.  I ordered the Bangus, Pancit and rice which was tasty and served in hearty proportion.  I also ordered the cantaloupe juice to wash it all down.  The party I ate with, I sampled the Lechon, Menudo and Halo-halo which all tasted as expected, if were made from your kitchen at home.

If you're unfamiliar with the Filipino dishes mentioned above, refer to this site: http://www.seasite.niu.edu/Tagalog/filipino_food_glossary.htm

The service is fast once you start to put your order together.  After paying for your meal and sitting down, don't expect to be waited-on or asked about your meal.  The place is all ""self serve.""  It's setup  where you slide your order tray with you as you walk down the assembly line of food, picking your your entrees and side orders.  

The only drawback is location.  If you have access to a car, this place is relatively fast to get to.  If you're taking a cab from a hotel, getting there is easy, but finding your way back can be a bit difficult.  Not too many taxi's come out to this area so be sure to have your cell phone fully charged to call a cab.",rpqKQErEs36haM0ccKcI9g,2,0,4,k3eHx17O6CmHWYxodb_iEg

I had a two items combo with sisig, bangus and rice, and I also added an order of sinigang. Everything was delicious and authentic in my opinion. My favorite was the bangus. They didn't just give me a tiny little piece like a lot of Filipino fast food places do, they gave me pretty much the whole fish. It was done just right; not too dry but it was crispy enough. The sisig and sinigang were both good, and had enough flavors. I actually took some of the bangus and sisig to go because the portion was huge and I didn't want to waste good food. After a 12 hours drive back home, the bangus and sisig were still in good shape; and most importantly, they still tasted good after re-heating! I was totally amazed and surprised...

4259135,2012-05-12,1,C4XsC2ZBtsl1EgjdVue3yA,"It'd been years since we last ate here, maybe within months of opening (a while ago). I should begin the review with an explanation/disclaimer; growing up, after finding out what everything was, in filipino cuisine, I became a picky eater. I was the one cutting off all the fat off the meat. I don't like greasy foods, in general (plus, being pregnant, things are not always agreeing with my system). I stuck to safe things because in all honesty, I don't eat all animal flesh (limit it to beef, chicken, sometimes pork, turkey, seafood and shellfish). And it's not like I don't eat fatty foods at all, I just select the days (I eat carefully on most days, but on the weekends, I eat what I want; it helps my figure). We don't go to a lot of filipino restaurants (but this doesn't mean that I'm less of a Pinay, I know alot about the history, I do know Tagalog, though I am not fluent, and I could go on and on about Pinoys in Hollywood, believe me, I am proud). 

Located in Amall, on the corner of Sahara and Maryland Parkway (the one with 7-11 on the corner), the cafeteria-style restaurant  (you select your items and pay at the end of the aisle, before sitting down to eat) is located in the elbow of the strip mall. Inside is spacious with lots of seating, tables & chairs. Trays are placed on top of the trash cans located near the doors. Bathrooms are located in the back of the restaurant. It is clean, however, we did see a dirty tray (had food stuck on it), which the employee promptly picked up upon seeing that it was set aside. And when we sat down, noticed that there was a B grade up on the wall. My husband also noticed that something was cleaned up with a dirty rag, which was then placed on top of the counter. 

We had cousins, and my auntie, in town so we met them here for lunch last saturday afternoon. My husband and I each chose the two-item plates (two scoops of rice, pancit, and BBQ sticks), a drink, and I also got the bibingka, and my husband got the turon (oops, forgot to tell him it was made with filipino bananas). The cashier was nice and cracked a joke about the sticky balls on a stick (carioca). The rice was plentiful, the BBQ sticks were cold and more on the fatty side, and the pancit was ok. (Also, another reason why I am picky with filipino food is that my mom's pancit and lumpia were the best. When there is such a high standard, it's hard to have anything else). The caldereta did look good, and maybe I would've enjoyed my lunch if I had that instead. Ok, I have to share this funny story abut our nephew, my sister's oldest. I didn't know that he liked dinuguan, and I told him what it was before he ordered it, when we were in line. He was eating it, and had this uncertain expression on his face. And then said, ""What is this?"" My immediate reaction was to laugh heartily, as I always do (sorry, I have a loud laugh). My husband later said that he wished he had recorded the whole thing (see, he can't have dessert unless he finishes the meal, it's the rule). I did enjoy the bibingka, I do love filipino desserts! Masarap. The turon @ $1.50 was really good and such a generous size too. The cost of our meals was over $21.00. My sister, brother-in-law, and their older boys split a couple halo-halo's- served in glass dishes similar to ice cream sundaes, which looked good, but I love Chow King's version (in Seafood City). If I wanted some filipino dessert, I could stop here, since it's in the neighborhood.  

There were other customers in the restaurant but I would't say that it was crowded, especially for the weekend (when we moved here in 1991, there weren't many choices and now due to a higher pinoy population, there are lots of choices for us; and the most popular is Seafood City).",fiGqQ7pIGKyZ9G0RqWLMpg,1,1,3,dTmpn73-Cn4EaQd11E1l_w

-Dinuguan and menudo

The place looks like all the Filipino ""cafeteria"" style restaurants.  Fairly clean and smells amazing inside.  The staff was very very friendly (as most Filipinos are) and did not judge us when we didn't really speak Tagalog.  He helped us get our plates and even cracked a few jokes.

We got the pinakbet, lechon kawali, and dinuguan.  My girlfriend was quite saddened to see that there was no kare-kare that morning.  But the food was still enjoyable.  The best part of the meal was the melon drink.  It was so refreshing on a hot Vegas morning.  Mhmmm... delicious!

This place is a typical Filipino fast food with a pretty decent size seating capacity.  You get in line, pick up a tray and you choose the most greasy item in the menu because that is the best tasting artery blocking meal.

Two item sir, yes sir.  Turon, halo halo, and coconut drink please.  Then may I have extra napkins please.  Pay for the meal and take a seat.  There was a time where I would not worry about the grease, but now, I spend an extra 5 minutes to get as much of the oil off as possible.  I'd like to postpone my heart attack another day.

Adobo is just OK.  But the portions are huge!  Come early to get the best selections.  We went late one night and all my favs were missing except the lechon.

They had just landed from a 3 week trip to the Philippines.  After seeing them again, they were hungry for some Filipino food.  It's a little ironic since they just came back from there and that's all they ate for a whole 3 weeks.  

On the most part we normally will go to DJ's Bibinkahan but I decided against it since we haven't had Pinoy Pinay in a long time.  I got a little confused as to where the line starts.  It doesn't take a brain surgeon to just walk towards the food and just go from there.  Looking through the glass full of oily food, I was actually confused and didn't know what my stomach was hungry for.  Luckilly, mom was there with me to order something so I could taste more than two items.  

For my first item, I chose Kare-Kare a peanut butter based pork with tri-tip and vegetables.  My second choice was this batter fish that was deep fried and dipped with sweet and sour sauce.  My chose vegetable dishes and a coconut dish.  I wish I remembered what they were.  But, I remember how good it tasted.  :)  

What I liked about this place is that the people were nice and friendly.  They weren't just there to put food in a container or a plate for you but were ready to give suggestions if you're stuck.  Also, they take care in placing the food on your plate and not just slap it on.  As for the food, it's not as greasy and it actually taste like the ingredients are fresh.  Unless we got there in time or just after it left the wok or pan.  If so, then how lucky was that?  

After choosing your food, we got to the cashier and paid.  So it had a Cafeteria setting where you get your food in a tray and line up like cows until you reach the cashier and pay for your food.

My mom's friend's best friend treated us for dinner here at Pinoy Pinay. This is just another typical Filipino restaurant you'd find in any other city. The first impression that comes to me about this restaurant is that, it's a total DIVE! That doesn't mean the food is horrible. I'd say more average but not excellent. 

Since it's in Downtown, the area is not a great place to walk alone. The interior is very outdated and felt kind of dirty. Let's be honest here, the food is not that great but the prices are excellent and saved us a ton from eating on the strip. The place kind of reminded me of an old Filipino restaurant I ate at in Glendale in the 90's. 

The food wasn't that bad, more so and so. I picked up a tray and ordered the two item combo, pork barbecue skewers and chopped pork. Food was a bit cold and tasted old, the flavor in the barbecue was there and so was the chopped pork but they give you lots of rice!

Then one day, we started to not see the big guy like we used to. Although the other guys were just as friendly, after that...it didn't feel the same. Not the service, but food wise. The food didn't taste as good as it used to. We started leaving the place disappointed. Which wasn't the feeling we were accustomed to after coming here for so long. 

It has been awhile since we have come to eat. We just lost the love for the place. I will say their halohalo is similar to halohalo you will find in the philippines. So it's pretty authentic and good. 

I mean, their food isn't bad at all. It's  just, there is something different with it now, and I can't quite figure it out. 

I don't even know if I can recommend this place anymore as I used to. Not even the bbq sticks because it's always so fatty. Lechon kewali is hard work to chew on. It's like eating glass. Their complimentary soups are tasty and hot, though. Ah, just try it out.

Pinoy Pinay is a great place for lunch on the cheap, even if Filipino food isn't your favorite. At $8.25 for two entrees, rice, and soup it's great value especially if you've just blown serious coin on a Vegas buffet.

I got the Dinuguan and the Longanisa last time I came here. The first is a black colored stew made from duck and the second is a reddish meat sausage; both are tasty if a bit tough on your arteries.

If they offer you soup, take it! It's usually made from Sinigang, a light meat-based broth usually containing pork.

The restaurant is a bit older and kind of isolated. Filipinos in town converge here but the staff is super nice. Don't be afraid to ask questions if it's your first time.

Is this is the best Filipino food ever? Not even close, I mean come on. You know how it goes, ""my mom the best Filipino food."" But they do some good lechon and I love their dinuguan.

We always make it a point to come here when In Vegas -  This place never disappoints...and you get plenty of food for what you pay.

My go to place for Filipino food...trust me.",b5Xvksa5eUDfrDJY66Btzg,2,2,4,kPHqO3823fke8u1bbH02Fw

We visit from Denver and this year we ordered lechon kawali, pusit, bangus, and dinuguan. Lechon kawali was good, but the pusit was dry and the bangus was cold. We went for lunch.",d5Zda1xm1OM_REAIuTRCAg,0,0,2,mCcMiU3YZG-ne1WrIRx3nw

For me, the dishes are always a hit or miss in regards to the saltiness. But, I just order a melon juice, and I am content. 

The servings are large, so you can eat like a king on a budget.  The restaurant is clean and quite spacious.  And the servers are always friendly and welcoming.",sEpOSEvfLgatlavQKYE7GA,1,0,3,o2cxi4sPMNkpI7uslWJB4g
