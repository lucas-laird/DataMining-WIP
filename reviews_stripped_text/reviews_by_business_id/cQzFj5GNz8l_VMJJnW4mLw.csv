The first time there, I attributed this to her having a bad day, but last night was the third time I've been there when she was working and she is very rude!  Very snotty! It wasn't just to me.  It was toward all the patrons there.  Never go on Wednesday night.  That's when she's working.  My friend and I like going there to play poker, catch up and grab a snack.  They do have great food there!  The patrons are so much fun too!  I feel comfortable there.

The machines are as tight as can be with no payout, I play all poker games and keno and its a joke! Ive been in Vegas for 8 years and have never been to a worse bar for gambling. Oh and both Timbers down the street are just as bad! Stay clear away from this bar if you want to gamble, if you want some good food then check it out! On a side note about the food.. They serve it in a basket when it needs to be served on a plate. The basket gives no room for the food and makes everything a mess. A plate would be much more practical and classy.

A little later he had what I consider a friend come in. They stood at the entrance to the bar and we're kissing. Inappropriate for a professional in my opinion. They, well he ignored the few people that were there for hours. When I politely asked for a drink. Example. ""Excuse me Kyle, can we get another round?"" I guess he didn't hear me. So I repeated myself.  Never did I say hey just excuse me. Out of the blue he turns to myself and my guest and says, loudly. ""Don't fucking yell at me!"" I was dumbfounded. I explained that I didn't yell at him I just thought he didn't hear me because he was busy with his tongue in her mouth. Yet he got as close to my face as he could and yelled ""don't fucking yell at me!"" If he can't leave his personal life at home and be professional we will never step foot in that place during graveyard again. My girl and I had never been treated like that from someone in the service industry before. We are both in the industry.

You would think that I could have let the server know, but we didn't see him until he delivered the check about 25 minutes later. I have 1 suggestion for him. It looks like you hate your job, go find one where you don't have to work with the public. Maybe he just didn't like working.

Walking in, you go left to the bar or straight to the dining area. The dining room was not full so were able to seat ourselves. High chairs were available.

The French onion soup which I ordered to start, looked sooo much better than it tasted. I enjoyed the melty cheese and bread on top, (who doesn't love that part?) and there was a good amount of onions, but the broth was not very flavorful. For my main course I ordered the fish and chips. It came with one large piece of breaded fish (cod) , fries, coleslaw and tarter sauce. I enjoyed the slaw. It was cold, creamy and tangy. The fish was okay the breading wasn't very flavorful. I did not like the tarter sauce. The fries are breaded which I don't mind. They tasted better dipped in the house made ranch though. 

The rest of the food seemed to be a hit or miss. Mom's mashed potatoes came out cold, but her chopped steak was good. Dad ordered the steak burrito which was huge, but he didn't really care for it. It came with a side of beans that looked like canned dog food. Bf got the ribs unsauced and at least they were fall off the bone tender. 

The service was the best part. Out server was kind and patient with us, and made sure to take care of any issues that we had throughout our meal. For 4 of us plus tax and tip it was almost $80!

My sister got three pieces of chicken fingers with her fries (the paprika on the fries makes them worthwhile). Her BF got the chili cheese fries which he found to be promising as well.

When we were deciding where to go to dinner we decided we wanted some bar food and wanted to try one of the numerous Nevada style taverns. 

Edge of Town it is. Our server was Brittany, she was awesome, very attentive and helpful. Everything on the menu sounds really good. 

I started off with their homemade bowtie chicken noodle soup and he got their chili. Both were really good in fact we're going to go there just for the soup and chili one night. Warning the chili has a little kick to it!  The chicken soup was nice and hearty and had real chunks of chicken in it. 

I could not resist trying the onion soufflé. It was so good! Served hot with toasted crostini and melted cheeses. Yes, it's a delicious heart attack in a crock dish. My companion had the pot roast melt. Let's talk about the bread it came on. It came on a bun that had toasted cheese and onions on top of it!! We asked if next time we could get a burger on that bun and they are pretty much willing to do any kind of substitution or make anything you want as long as they have the components. I tried pot roast melt I don't even like pot roast and I liked this one!

Since the food was so good up until that point, I decided to try to bread pudding since it was back by popular demand. My thinking was this has got to be some great bread pudding if it's back. Apparently people were asking for it. It was edible. It was not terrible. But it wasn't the best bread pudding I've ever had. It really wasn't worth all the calories I only ate half of it. Our server did suggest though that we should try the cookie sundae next time, because its better than the bread pudding. I like honest servers and that was very helpful! 

We are definitely going back and they include coupons our server told us in the coupon value packs you get in the mail.",ElUiVmEMoQgyWcnYeR560w,1,0,5,Zt8h6IRbk8I8xwhmVpSDSw
3829308,2010-09-07,0,cQzFj5GNz8l_VMJJnW4mLw,"This was a classic experience where Less Is More could have been employed to make it better.  After passing by this joint many times, my Mom and I stopped by for lunch on Sunday.

I ordered the Triple Cheese Burger (Swiss, Cheddar, Provolone) with a side of Thai Slaw.  Mom ordered the Blackened Chicken Sandwich (Cajun Chicken blackened in an iron skillet, topped with onions, peppers and melted jack cheese with a cajun mayo on a ciabatta roll) with a side of Thai Slaw.

Here's the breakdown....the Burger has a lot of potential.  I like to put Cole Slaw on my Burger, so I put some of the Thai Slaw on it.  It was juicy, but there was simply too much Cheese on it.  I couldn't taste the Burger and the Cheese flavors were indistinguishable.  The Thai Slaw has some serious potential too, but it was way too runny.  After the first few bites of the Slaw, the bowl was full of liquid so the rest of the Slaw was 'soupy'.....too much sauce and very, very sweet.  Also, there was a ton of Peanuts in the Slaw.  I don't know if they meant to do that, but it overwhelmed the flavor....also, I expect a Thai Slaw to have some heat in it...their version doesn't.

I had 1/2 of Mom's Blackened Chicken Sandwich....again, they should employ the Less Is More Rule here.  The Sandwich was topped with a bunch of Grilled Onions, then fresh Onions....it was Onion overload!  The Chicken had a good, char-smoked flavor, but was lacking a Spicy Kick that I would expect from a Cajun flavored Chicken.

Overall, it was a good experience....not great, but good.

It was a bit later on a Tuesday night, so once again we knew we'd be closing a restaurant.  We ordered two glasses of wine to start, some white zin Koolaid (yeah, I know.  It's not wine, you snobs).  It was not a great white zin, way too flimsy.

Having been shunning red meat since the horsemeat scare in Europe, from whence we'd just returned, I decided to go whole hog :) and ordered a Baja Burger.  The meat was fresh, juicy, and cooked medium, exactly the way I ordered it, and the chopped green chilis and jalapeno jack added the right kick.  It wasn't a problem to substitute mashed for the fries/chips/coleslaw option, and I was happy to taste REAL mashed potatoes with their skins that were perfectly seasoned and not oversalted.  That's a tough combination, but the kitchen nailed it.

Hubby had the Cajun chicken over bowtie pasta, but instead of the cream sauce of the description he was able to get it with the house red sauce, which was thick and delicious.  The chicken was a good-sized breast and, again, well-seasoned without being overly salty.  It came with garlic bread, but instead of Italian bread it was a flat bread, and it just didn't work - way too soft.

Service was excellent, and my only quibble was waiting a bit too long for our food to come.  Odd, since we were now the only diners.  But glad that the food was worth waiting for.",m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,2,0,4,jhdT3SiFB1W1yDemxd0UlA

I have to say due to their way out west location, I understand why the restaurant section is only staffed in peak hours. It isn't a nation wide chain, that can afford to employ bored employees that stand around waiting for people who aren't coming. As far as any specials(Happy Hour/Monday night football/Ladies Night) go, this is a local's joint, people go there because it is close to home & not a PT's or a Timber's or a Station Casino. I really believe that specials would not bring in any more business for them. Of the local's bars, based on food & service, in general, I believe, Steiner's & Putter's are the best, Timber's is my standard, PT's is, in general the worst, but has the best specials. I put The Edge Of Town, ahead of Timber's. Being a 24 hour joint, like all 24 hour joints, the food quality & service is going to vary. I will say at The Edge Of Town, I have always had fast friendly service & someone has always greeted me, even if it is just a: Hey, how you guys doing? Did you need menus, I'll come right over, after I get this drink order, from the lone bartender working Graveyard. This is exactly what I want from my local bar.

My take... I love their burgers & most of the other items on the menu. The service has always been better than every self-seating restaurant. Kid friendly? I have no idea? As a smoker, I have only sat in the bar section. I often wonder why people take their children to any local's joint or places that serves hard alcohol? Lack of specials? Hell, I am a local, I am not looking for the cheapest deal in town & I tip for service. If I didn't live in the area, would I drive across town to eat & drink here, honestly, no, but I wouldn't drive across town just to eat & drink at any other local's bar either. I would drive for Sushi Bomb(next door) & have a couple real drinks after dinner at The Edge Of Town. I am glad that The Edge Of Town is my neighborhood bar. In the same relative area, there are 2 Timbers & a Steiner's. I rarely get good service at any Timber's & the restaurant staff is constantly changing at Steiner's, so their service varies. 

The Edge Of Town is a local's bar & they treat you like a local. If you live way the F west on Cheyenne, give it a shot & tell me that I am wrong.",ns0rK7adREikI6hwFA71Xg,5,3,4,756zWl6oNBB_LU15FyXFvw

5445129,2015-04-30,0,cQzFj5GNz8l_VMJJnW4mLw,"I will tell you this..... Do NOT eat here. The food is terrible, 26 bucks down the drain for an order of chicken tenders, soda and a dip sandwich. I'll let you decide after seeing the pictures. 

With that being said, I have this 3 stars and almost want to do 4 because of the service and the bar vibe. Our waitress was great, which sucks she probably gets screwed on tips because the food is just that bad. Mind you I don't have high standards for bar food but it should be better than mc Donald's. 

Anyway, so the waitress was great. So we decided to throw 40 bucks in the slots. Eh. They wernt the best BUT the bartender was amazing! I mean she made us feel so welcomed and she made the whole experience so much better. I'm an idiot for not getting her name but we will be back for gaming because of the staff.",PHW4Ixb3yO6dFECILUnZnQ,0,0,3,vDEbMixjzAFOYBbIbIqR6Q

I got the chopped salad again and they were more than willing to switch out the cheese and dressing to my taste. Salad came out looking beautiful and fresh and my boyfriend got the meatloaf. He said everything was cooked perfectly and tasted delicious. Potato skins were as delicious as before. Our waitress Nina (nEYEnah, as she pronounced it) was very sweet and kind. She made jokes with us and talked to us as though we were personal friends with her. I would come back just for her. If you come here, ask for her!

There service is always friendly and active which I like. And there food has always been consistently good. However the last two times I've been there I ordered there burger with carmalized onions and the onions came out raw on my burger under melted cheese. I told my server about it and she talked with the cook and he gave her a ton of attitude about how they are carmalized to him. And these onions were diced and warmed at best far from grilled let alone carmalized. I won't give up on them yet but I hope this isn't a bad sign that things are going downhill. 

I would still give them majority stars because there food is consistently good minus there inability to carmalize an onion and there dining room staff is always on point. I wish them the best and hope they can remain a nice local spot.",m_BJLAya0SVqeg1rgRwo5g,1,2,4,8kon9bHit3ua0JF0ynqGXw

Of course it wasn't opened up and presented to me while I was there... It was plastic bagged and knotted... After I get home... 45 seconds later since i live right behind the place i open it up and its not even hot. I can stick my finger inside and leave it there without even the slightest burn... I call them to ask why this wouldn't even be an appetizer for my 6 year old daughter let alone my adult GF... And he says that's the biggest size they have... This is insane! It's smaller than 1 cup. I could literally pour this tiny thing into a 1 serving size measuring cup... Kyle the bartender says basically, ""next time you come in i'll buy you a couple beers."" Fuck that.. My girlfriend is sick, and wants a decent size BOWL OF SOUP! Never come to this place! And to top of off, i also asked for some garlic bread... Which they didn't have, but they gave me some breadsticks... And charged me a buck for each one...  Wtf is this shit? I also asked for NO ONIONS on a side salad... Which by the way actually looks good... But there is onions all over it... Big nasty red onions that I'm allergic too... Thanks Kyle! Appreciate wasting 30 minutes sitting inside waiting for this mess of a dinner that your cook tried to give to me to eat at the place when you put on the ticket that its a TO GO order!",N1SRDhbaevbQZc0NleHUCA,1,0,1,2BwmjPp14GXb3co7qfMQtA
