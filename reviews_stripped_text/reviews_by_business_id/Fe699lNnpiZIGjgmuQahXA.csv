499015,2017-01-29,0,Fe699lNnpiZIGjgmuQahXA,"not a happy camper. Not at all. I had been looking forward to this all day! I pull up to the drive through, knew what I wanted so I ordered right away. I get to the window. There were at least 3 employees in there. Took them a good 3 minutes to acknowledge me. I paid and they gave me my drink in which he had to ask again what kind I wanted. this is where it gets good. Minutes starting going by. Neither one of the three employees would look my way, and one of them eating up by the register, and I could see there was nobody coming into the dining area as they were just talking away. A total of 10 minutes pass by when finally I see them putting my food in my bag and coming to the window. The same girl that was eating hands me my bag without an apology about the time or even a have a great night, not a single word was said. 
I get home to eat my food to find burnt chicken, burnt noodles and a burnt egg roll. And I'm not talking just a little crispy, like you could taste the burnt with every bite, the few I had. You would think with the amount of time it took for me to get my food I would at least get something edible. All I wanted was a good teriyaki bowl and what I got was a disappointment.",iYntY8CgZZmmm-tEkBsnTg,0,0,1,uPUpJdDlAp-8jb8uWsRERQ

Came here to grab dinner to go. ALWAYS CHECK YOUR FOOD FOR TAKE OUT! Got two chicken bowls to go. Got our stuff but it was COLD. We asked them if they could do something about it. They cooked us some new chicken and we left. 

Get home and one of the bowls had raw chicken! Pieces of the chicken are raw and sitting on top of the veggies and rice. That's totally unacceptable. I've never had this happen. 

Now they're closed. I'm out the cost of two bowls. What am I to do? Wait until morning to talk to someone? 

I get it. Places close. But who ever cut the chicken surely noticed.

They need to fix this! They need to have some quality control. Use a thermometer for the meat.

It's just a lose lose situation.

I ended up stir frying the veggies and chicken at home in a pan and nuking the rice.

I understand it was a 30 minutes until closing. They should have just told us they were unable to make any new chicken correctly for the night and sent us elsewhere. 

I hope they get inspected.

I don't post bad reviews for the most part but I am doing so in hopes that no one gets sick.

My girlfriend ordered a chicken and steak wrap but they only put chicken in there. She claims the rice was too sticky.

I ordered a thai tea smoothie and was skeptical about it. It was way too icy and I ended up wasting most of it. I would rate it a 6 out of 10 at best. The taste was mediocre.

I told the lady we wanted the wrap for here and my bowl to go but she did not listen and gave me my bowl uncovered with no top.

I remember the Eastern/215 location to be decent/good but this location on Bonanza is god-awful.",L81XheMK8cTbA5fa6KuGTQ,1,0,1,hFWAEZevb6JRyrbw6pjRCg

The bobas are nasty. They have no flavor and a ton of sugar. When they first opened, their food was ok.

What a menu! They have rice, soba noodles and all kinds of meats and fish to pick from. I ordered the chicken and steak soba bowl. I also ordered their edanama and an egg roll. The soba bowl came filled with chicken and steak. It also had loads of veggies which made me extra happy. I love their teriyaki sauce cause it isn't as sweet as traditional sauces. The egg roll was tasty and grilled instead of fried. I also liked the bowl of steamed edanama. 

They really do live up to their name. They have healthy food that tastes amazing and for affordable prices. I wish they had one in my neck of the woods.",pUQdU4MlkB46jIdYs9oMUA,1,1,5,bZuPT1dOeVl7fIyYV-ZgyA

Unlike most Asian fast food places, they offer good generous servings of rice or yakisoba, which I appreciate. I also love the flavor of their Green Tea smoothies with boba in it! Delish. Another thing, one time I had their steak yakisoba and the steak was super tender, it was awesome. I've also had their shrimp teriyaki bowl, which was good as well. Their food definitely tastes great.

The reason I only give them three stars is because for a fast good spot, this place takes such a long time to complete orders. We ended up turning off our car while in the drive-thru one time.",zI0cogkqx4WQArqzTHXd-Q,1,1,3,I7ryv6XUGplOO_C0U64geg
