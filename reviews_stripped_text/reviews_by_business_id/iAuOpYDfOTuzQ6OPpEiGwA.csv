The food, whatever wasn't fat, all tasted old. Even the normally reliable warm buns had hard corners. The only redeeming quality remains the Apple Blossom iced tea. Service was fine, it's just the quality of food has gone down. And oh my god the bathrooms were disgusting! There were no towels to dry your hands and the  floor and stalls look like they hadn't been cleaned in quite some time.

I pulled through the drive thru tonight and when I arrived home with my food there was hair on the chicken fingers. I ended up throwing the whole meal away. It was actually fried on there and it was obviously hair. The fingers were supposed to be cooked in the spicy sauce and instead it was just put on the side in a container. Waste of money and food. I will never eat there again. Very disappointed!,FAXwAvUGglHexy456_QRYg,1,0,1,JdzY5Md3XeCJS3ExTCYOGg

I wasn't impressed with any of the food we ordered except for the ribs.  

The beef brisket was decent, but it was served at damn near room temperature, and a tad on the dry side.  The sauce is really what made it taste good.

The vegetables were good, but they're vegetables.  

The wings were definitely tasty, nothing special.  Again, it was the sauce they used that made them shine.

The ribs were AMAZING. Juicy and fall-off-the-bone tender.  You know what else made them good?  The Sauce.

148389,2014-06-28,0,iAuOpYDfOTuzQ6OPpEiGwA,"We are in Las Vegas for the weekend and decided to visit Memphis Championship Barbecue. While the ratings for MCB were not stellar, they seemed OK enough to give it a try, especially since it was nearby our hotel. This was not a good choice.

Growing up in Alabama, I've eaten barbecue for most of my six decades. I know the difference in great smoked meats and southern sides. These items were not great.

Service was good. We were seated immediately and our server was at the table within a couple of minutes. I decided we'd order the Deviled Eggs appetizer. The server explained they were rather sweet because of Miracle Whip. She was right, but, they tasted OK. We did note that the plate was wet, usually indicating that the eggs were make a while earlier and stored in a cold refrigerator. Not old, but certainly not made when ordered.

Our server brought us some ""fresh rolls and honey butter"". The ""honey butter"" may have been made in-house, but the rolls were a food service bread that had been heated. We then placed our orders, one pulled pork plate and one two meat plate consisting of pulled pork & brisket. Sides ordered were collard greens, fresh corn on the cob, and red beans and rice. I'll address each item, starting with the sides.

Collard Greens- VERY overcooked (to the point of being almost black and mushy) and extremely sweet. The only flavoring was a heavy spiciness, not flavor, but heat. The only way to flavor them was with green pepper vinegar, but they were so overcooked we sent them back, choosing instead to have fried okra. 

Fresh Corn on the Cob - The corn WAS fresh, but while the collards were very overcooked, the corn was nearly raw. So raw that it wasn't even warm all the way through. The husk end of the corn was still green, not white, as cooked corn is. When I explained to the server that the corn was not cooked she told me that they ""flash fried the corn"". I had to ask what she meant. Apparently they put the raw corn into a fryer basket and drop it into a deep fryer for ""1- 1 1/2 minutes because we don't want it to turn into popcorn"". The server apparently doesn't understand that popcorn is a specific strain of conn, which is dried. So, the cold/raw corn was returned. It was replaced with hush puppies. So now we've had two sides sent back. 

Red Beans/Rice - Apparently canned red beans just heated up. No special spices. We kept them but they weren't good.

Fried Okra/Hush puppies - When okra arrived the breading was very uniform, so I asked if it was house made or frozen. Surprise...both the fried okra and the hushpuppies were frozen food service products. Now, as a southerner I am pretty appalled that a BBQ restaurant doesn't make hushpuppies from scratch. I mean, how hard is it to mix up a corn meal batter and drop it in a fryer? 

Frankly, the best side was the frozen okra. It wasn't overcooked and was hot. 

Sad...truly sad.

The meats, which should have been the star, just turned out to be a black hole of flavor.

While the pulled pork had a nice bark and smoke ring, it had absolutely no flavor. It was hot and not dry, but without a bbq sauce it was bland. The ""Original Sauce"" used on it was not much better. Only the ""Sticky Red Sauce"" had any flavor.

The brisket was tender, but aside from it's smoke ring there was no flavor there either. 

They advertise their ""Magic Dust"", a seasoning that is apparently sprinkled on everything. Unfortunately, they should have rubbed it into all the meats prior to smoking.

But, the kicker was the piece of ""baked"" plastic found in my pulled pork. While I wanted to not believe everything was reheated that made me rethink it all. 

So, the whole meal was extremely disappointing. Fortunately our server, who'd said she'd ""been doing this a long time"" was helpful and apologetic. She came back to our table to tell us the entire meal had been comped. While we did not eat but about 25% of the entire meal, we did not expect that to happen. As everyone should, we tipped her for the total of the whole meal.

My suggestion for the restaurant is to start flavoring the meat, make FRESH well-cooked sides, and dump the frozen & food-service prepped items.",OXfHDNqjexPfFNKFvULF3Q,7,0,2,lsRfj_1vBQ1inYWgG40xrg

156467,2013-08-18,0,iAuOpYDfOTuzQ6OPpEiGwA,"Been eating at Memphis BBQ since I moved to the Valley in the early 90's. Certainly has changed a lot since then. Not always for the better. Still love it though. I miss the original beef ribs, but vendor changes can't be helped. The original location on Craig and LVB seems to be better, but this location does pretty good. The influx of other BBQ options in the Valley has definitely damaged the business as opposed to forcing them to improve. The food is the most important and it still stands the test of time. The only issues I have are it's inconsistenty as far as quality. Some days the meat is dryer then others, based on what time you come in. Some of the sides have changed as well and their quality hasn't always improved. After probably 150 times coming here, I've never had a terrible meal. Sometimes it hasn't been good, but never terrible. The revolving door of staff doesn't help the overall experience either. Maybe I'm just nostalgic and I feel a sense of loyalty to this establishment, but I seriously do like their BBQ. I've eaten at other places all over the valley and in other states, so I do have a gauge on other BBQ. Some are better, most worse. This is a local business that's been providing great food to Las Vegas for a lot of years. And as long as they're still around, I'll continue to patronize this establishment. I suggest you make the choice yourself and don't let a bunch of cry babies who don't eat red meat make the choice for you.",-gQZ1BfxbXEN8XuoYBJd2g,1,0,4,qM-gIm_v5_tBW1nZK9WlKQ

I would bring visiting friends there, recommend it to my clients from out of town as a must visit and eat, but that was years ago. When service was top notch, the portions were plentiful, and the food was great.

Now, when I receive a plate here (pulled port sandwich), I wonder what happened?

My food was absolutely tasteless, and the sweet side potato which I paid $4 (price+tax+tip)....or should I say ""my half a sweet potato"" was clearly cut in half to add to the bottom line. It's a far cry from when they served decent portions of tasty food. It makes me wonder what other short cuts they have considered. I didn't realize there was a national shortage of sweet potato and a well dressed, cooked potato could cost me over $8 American dollars.

When I asked the Manager about the portion size, he simply stated ""that's how we do it"".

I don't know what's happened lately but it's gotten bad. About six months ago I was served ribs that were microwaved, yes microwaved with that familiar super tough dry consistency and discoloration in the bones that only a microwave does.  I sent the food back and didn't eat.  A couple months ago I am craving Mike Mill's BBQ because of the memory of how it used to be so I gave it another chance.  Again ordered ribs and brisket. Brisket was cold and tasted like a 2 day old left over roast from the fridge, tough and dry.  My ribs tasted off.  The meat had the smoke ring as it should but under that was disgusting. The meat was a weird grey color. These ribs were cooked from rotten meat and if that wasn't bad enough they were microwaved gain.  I sent this meal back as well.  My wife sent hers back as well. Even the sides were bad.  The hush puppies were super dark almost looked burnt but were raw dough in the center. The server refunded our meal and said don't give up on them yet. I could hear someone getting yelled at in the kitchen when we sent our food back that they cost him a customer.  I really didn't want to give up on them. I gave them one last shot last weekend. Mike Mill's was in town for the Best Damm BBQ cook off in Boulder City so I thought it would be better with him around.  We went in Friday afternoon and me and my wife ordered baby back ribs. This time they send us cold meat that was weird again. Yes the meat was ROTTEN AGAIN! Disgusting again. I know what bad meat looks like, and this was bad.  That was strike three.

531191,2013-04-10,1,iAuOpYDfOTuzQ6OPpEiGwA,"This is a difficult review to write because my server at Memphis Championship Barbecue (MCB) was just one of the nicest, sweetest people you'll ever have the privilege of meeting.  But she was in no way responsible for the quality (or rather, complete lack thereof) of the food.  For an appetizer, I tried the onion strings with ""magic dust.""  The onion strings tasted like they were frozen food thrown into a deep fryer, and the magic dust tasted like, well, just dust.  Guilty confession here, I have been known, at times, to secretly enjoy frozen food fresh out of the deep fryer.  But only if the quality of the frozen food was decent, which was clearly not the case with these onion strings.

But you don't go to a BBQ joint for the appetizers and sides, you're looking to dig into the ribs, right?  The MCB menu boasts that Mike Mills' ribs have won several prestigious BBQ competitions.  If that's true, then there's no way Mike Mills still owns or operates MCB because any self-respecting BBQ judge would have spat out the ribs I was served.  First of all, as one who grew up in Barbecue Country (Kansas City), I can spot barbecue fraud from a mile away.  What's barbecue fraud, you ask?  BBQ fraud is baked, as opposed to wood-smoked.  You will never see a wisp of smoke coming out of Famous Dave's, Lucille's, or MCB.  And if it ain't smoked, it ain't barbecue.  By just baking the meat, you avoid all the grime, heat, and eye-burning smoke of wood-smoking.  The problem is that the baked fraud stuff is mediocre at best (Lucille's, for example) and horrible at worst (MCB).  The MCB ribs were fatty (the smoking, or baking, process should be long enough to render most of the fat out of the ribs), the dry rub had no discernible flavor, and the sauce tasted like the generic bottled variety.  OMG, Worst. Ribs. Ever.

Because I have such a vicious sweet tooth, a half-decent dessert does much to wipe away the memory of a bad meal.  If only the dessert at MCB were even half-decent.  I would have settled for quarter-decent.  I got the banana pudding, which tasted like an instant pudding mix.  And not even a decent, name-brand instant pudding mix but some cheap, generic substitute.  Blech! it was an awful way to end truly awful meal.

There are only three BBQ joints in Las Vegas that wood-smoke their meat:  Top Notch, Rollin' Smoke, and Annie's Kitchen.  I love both Top Notch and Rollin' Smoke, eat at both places often.  Never tried Annie's, but I'll have to go sometime because I hear from a fellow BBQ-loving Kansas Citian that it's terrific.

BBQ is all about TENDER and JUICY, not DRY and HARD.   I hate to leave such a bad review but if I were the management I would wanna know when the food is going DOWN HILL and brother something is off in that kitchen!",Ku4BS8FoPwpHoyadcJ7R1g,0,0,2,slmBNPo6qjo05NnsvJ-Aig

Long:
Let's say I got comped for free lunch/dinner, all paid for. So, I arrived at 4 (when is was pretty dead), got seated quickly and waited on nicely. Nothing to complain about in the service. Ordered coke (got a large mug) and their ""sampler"" appetizer. This had onion shreds, fried pickles, burnt ends, and some potato skin things. Onion shreds were like all others I've had, pickles were too--so I have to question if they were frozen. Burnt ends weren't ""real"" burnt ends, just boneless--sometimes pure fat--that have been smoked and slathered in sauce. Good, but not true burnt ends. The potato skin things were decent, but the pork, cheese, and whatnot tasted all the same, so it's kind bland.
My entree was baby-back ribs, brisket, and white meat smoked chicken. I LOVED the wing off the chicken--tender, juicy, flavorful. BUT, the breast meat of the chicken was dry as all hell. Brisket wasn't sliced, and tasted like it had been sitting around. Why not slice brisket? Seriously? Half of it tasted like I was eating tree bark. With the half-rack of ribs, the ""towards the center"" was tender, but low on flavor. The other side ""towards the end"" was pretty tough. There was an overall lack of smoke flavor, and flavor at all, from the ribs. (I sampled ribs at Sprouts--a grocer--and found their ribs to be much better). So a chain focused on their awards on ribs fell pretty short here for me. My sides were macaroni and cheese--which had some cheddar velveta--and rice and beans, which was fine but not great.
They do have sauces on the side, but they're too runny to actually stay on the meat, and while the flavor is good, you can't taste it on the meat as the sauces are too watered down.
In the end, It would have cost me close to $50 for all of this, not including tip, and I just don't see the worth in that. Nothing blew me away.

If you're hard set on this place, go for their chicken wings, burnt ends, and maybe ribs.
But, if you're looking, go somewhere else since you'll get better for your money.",kBoCLXsjzpSTpOKC9J6FUg,0,0,3,yl9NV-IHw7sovhyOkHFElw

The waiter we had was EXTREMELY friendly and accommodating.  We were seated very quickly at this time of night.  Trying to decide what to order was a real challenge.  Based on the descriptions of each of the dishes, we wanted to order one of everything.  After some discussion, we decided on the Grand Champion Plate and the dish where you choose your favourite style: baby back, St. Louis or beef plus two other meats.  We selected coleslaw and baked beans as our two side dishes.

It's the absolutely best BBQ I've ever had!  Everything we had was very tender and moist.  The pulled meats were something to die for!!  I was very surprised with the coleslaw.  It is not the coleslaw I was use to having with the creamy sauce but soaked in vinegar.  Very very appetizing!!  Both my kids were a little apprehensive eating the food simply because they've never been here before.  Once they started, they continued to eat until they were full.

Do have two complaints.  1.  On the potato skins, description says they give you four.  They give the skin of one potato, cut in half lengthwise then in half vertically.  To me that is not four.  That is two cut in half.  2.  And others will not find it a negative... they only sell Pepsi products.  I am a Coke products fan.  Maybe that;s why I take it home.  So I can have my own beverage.

Will continue to be a fan.",fFHGP9OIRzvdW0xKZsvigg,0,5,4,iY-sruMg2kQPONw_IMXSDQ
1434025,2013-11-08,0,iAuOpYDfOTuzQ6OPpEiGwA,"Went to pick up lunch today, walked in and waited more than a few minutes before I even saw an employee. Finally placed an order, and the employee disappeared with my credit card to the back. Employee returned with the receipt to sign and it took several more minutes for my food.

I got to my friend's house not far away, and despite the fact it had been less than 5 minutes, the fries were already cold and not that great. Baked beans had a weird flavor and were also kind of cold. Finally, the pulled pork sandwich was also underwhelming and cold. Sauce had way too much vinegar. Cole slaw looked disgusting, like it had been made several days before.

They probably still could have salvaged a second star, except that the customer service managed to drop even after I had left. I realized after I got home that when the employee disappeared with my credit card, she failed to bring it back. So I called, to verify that that's where I left it. I explained the situation to more than one employee and was repeatedly put on hold. They confirmed that she kept my card when she swiped it, but they refused to mail it back to me. Apparently they have a policy that they can only give it back to me if I come in, in person, and show ID. This place is across town, and there's no way I'm driving an hour round-trip to go pick up my card. I just don't see how this policy is anything but nonsense. Do they really think that someone else would figure out that my card was missing, and then be able to figure out where I left it before I do, and then intercept it, and then manage to make fraudulent charges? The whole thing is ridiculous. Not to mention that if they just had a credit card machine up in the front, where they take all of the takeout orders, this never would have happened.

All-in-all, I wish I would have passed, what started as a mediocre, over-priced lunch managed to turn into a real headache.",zcmCg2nsT0pBinXiVEA5Wg,0,0,1,l0EmSZwVhg7ivzt6fG6ydw

Now I will admit that I probably don't know or understand what ""real"" BBQ is.  However, I do know that BBQ is a process and not to be rushed.  Everything about this place to me seems rushed and not in a good way.  I've been to many BBQ places and there is a usually a sense of pride when presenting the dish.  Here....well it seems the focus is put more on the get in and get out mentality.

Now I understand the economics of the situation.  The more customers you get through the door, the more mighty dollars will go in the pocket. Yeah, that is my Econ 101 class for the day.  With that being said, you don't have to serve something mediocre to enhance that dollar.  Now this is just me talking but if it were me (and it's not), I would strive for that repeat customer and make a BBQ that everyone is going to talk about and want to return to.  I just don't feel like that is the case here.  

IMO, the best thing on the menu is their chili.  It's not the first thing I think of when it comes to BBQ but it does taste homemade and is hearty enough to fill ones appetite.  If you must go with something that you can sink your teeth into, I would suggest either the hot links, the catfish or the KC Burger.  All are pretty sold choices and I haven't been let down by any of them.  With regards to their brisket or pulled pork?  Well they are covered in so much slaw, it's hard to tell if there is any meat within the sandwich itself.

Service can be hit or miss. There's been times where we've been treated like kings and others where it has felt as though we didn't exist.  I guess that all depends on the particular server and the time of day that you are there.",PWR1pzxJysOQsc3eG7SkDg,6,3,2,pT12xE79MmO19-GxEfPe1A

First off, I found it a bit pricey, but I guess that's the cost for ""authentic"" BBQ.  Second, I learned the difference between ""Memphis"" and other style BBQ houses...it's in the sauce.  The Memphis sauce is pale and mustard-y, which is something I was ignorant of until this point.  Needless to say, I'm not a big fan...  I got the combo plate with baby back ribs, brisket and pulled pork.  The ribs were nice and tender, but slathered with the yellowish sauce.  The brisket was good.  The pulled pork was a bit dry, so I generously seasoned it with ""Magic Dust,"" which is their brand of dry rub seasoning.  It's delicious.  Now my mouth waters whenever I think about it.  I think they put cocaine in it or something.  I should have swiped a bottle when I had the chance.

Also, their strawberry lemonade was very dull and flavorless.  A far cry from the sweet and refreshing kind at Lucille's Smokehouse BBQ, which was my next stop...

UPDATE: I was compelled back by the ""crack"" seasoning (I nabbed a bottle this time), and I tried the burnt ends and the pulled chicken.

2069235,2010-06-21,0,iAuOpYDfOTuzQ6OPpEiGwA,"The hunt for great Q in Las Vegas is on, and unfortunately I am still looking.

Things I liked about Memphis Championship Barbecue; The concept, design and décor of this establishment is totally top drawer, I loved it and was comfortable just walking in. The service was polite and efficient and that is a big thing in my book. The booths were roomy and easy to deal with; in fact they were so big we had to slide way in to just get to the table condiments. There was plenty of room to stash my cane and hat without dropping them on the floor.

Before we get to talking Q, let's talk a bit about the sides. With my order I chose Cole Slaw and Baked Beans for the sides. As we all know there are two types of slaw out there, the creamy kind and the vinegar based slaw. The reason for the creamy slaw with Q is that it cuts the spicy heat from foods that are too spicy hot. With Q you really want that or you can get spice overload. A vinegar slaw does just the opposite; it opens your palette and intensifies the spicy flavors. This can make an uncomfortable eating experience in my opinions as the flavor lingers and becomes too bold. I know there are people who will say that it can never be too bold, but I ask you, is it worth it if you can't taste the meat and smoke? Isn't Q about the meat and smoke?

Our server saw my predicament over the slaw and asked if I would like to change it out and I took her up on the offer and selected the potato salad (remember I a looking for something creamy to help refresh the palette.) The potato salad was excellent and just what I needed from a side. I would even order that potato salad for take out it was that good, and that is saying a lot.

My other side was wonderful baked beans. There were 3 or 4 different beans, red beans, white beans and a couple others that I could not identify but were good and earthy. I seem to have detected maybe white onion and green bell pepper with some brown sugar that brought it all together. They were not runny and not too thick, excellent.

My wife ordered corn on the cob and collard greens. The corn was boiled (but it would have been nice grilled) so is a no brainer as corn is just coming into season. As for the collard greens she liked them well enough although she thought they were too rich for her palette. 

OK, let's talk meat and smoke...

I have to say this, since I took my wife to a true 5 star Q place she has been a brisket fanatic ever since. Naturally she ordered the brisket from here and discovered that not all brisket is made the same. First off I am not certain the brisket was smoked, because if it was there would have been more of a smoke ring and that seemed to be absent. Also, I am pretty sure it was not cook correctly as there were large streaks of fat still in and on the brisket. (To be honest it reminded my of my Yiddisha Momma's brisket.) It was definitely over cooked though as it was gray through and through. There was some moist meat, but it had that rubbery feel I expect from moms brisket. Here's the thing, brisket is truly the easiest Q there is and this was not up to the standard for what I consider great Q.

I have said this before, I am a beef fanatic and if beef ribs are not on the menu I don't even bother to order. Not that I will turn up my nose to the pig, but beef is where it is at for me. I also consider beef ribs harder to Q because they are thicker requiring watchful temperature control. When I saw beef ribs on the menu I thought, ""Excellent, it is going to be a good evening""; oh how wrong I was. 

There are several cuts of beef ribs, but when I think of beef ribs I think of the prime ribs that are what is left after you butcher the prime rib primal or short loin (back ribs (best) or even short end ribs (ok)). These are BIG AND JUICY ribs because they come from the very best of the steer; all your best cuts come around them. Then there is the middle cut of ribs that is mostly chuck meat and is typically call ""Beef Flanken"". This is a cheap cut and the meat requires a moist cooking (generally braised) application and is rarely used in Q. The last cut is the ""rib tips"" and is not worth talking about in a real Q application (although it is making inroads in wet BBQ circles).

The ribs were beef flanken ribs without the rest of the chuck cut. This is a cheap piece of meat and does not take well to BBQ. Yes, the dry rub was tasty, yes there was a smoke ring (bright pink, caused by the nitrogen dioxide when smoking) but here is the fail, the center was gray, a sure sign of over cooking. Honestly this cut of meat was doomed to leather before it got into the smoker and for a Q place to serve this is an INSULT. I was shocked, then amazed, then really insulted. This was a $17.50 plate of ribs that I honestly should not have been charged more that $7.50, what a rip off.

I was truly disappointed with the Q there; I really wanted to like it. As a dining experience it is fine; as a Q place, consider alternatives.",h2Ph6OQiFTY1J6CtRWJzLg,3,0,2,L79UpoX_OiWM5FLBhahZFg

When we got to the parking lot, you could smell the wonderful wood aroma which flavors the meat. We then went inside and were seated right away. 

The waitress we had was great. She explained a couple of questions we had and we ended up ordering 4 appetizers. (WAAAAAYYYYY too much food for 2 people.) We had the burnt ends, rib teaser (4 bones), stuffed potato skins (stuffed with shredded pork) and the 3 mini sandwich sampler with chicken, brisket and shredded pork.

2102947,2014-07-31,0,iAuOpYDfOTuzQ6OPpEiGwA,"My boyfriend I wanted to get off the strip for a while and we were craving some good barbecue so we went to this establishment at 9:30pm. Hardly anyone was in the restaurant which made me worry but it was late and a Tuesday night. We ordered a full slab of ribs and the beef brisket. The ribs almost tasted like beef jerky because they had been sitting around for so long. I joked with the server and said I bet these have been in the smoker most of the day? He nodded. Once we bit into the ribs it was ok, but the tops and sides of the slab were all pretty much hard and stiff. I'd be curious to see if someone arrived around 6 PM if the ribs would be any better? Maybe they would be because they would be fresh? I agree with the other comments on this site. The rolls did taste like reheated store-bought ones. The honey butter was very good though. The mashed potatoes reminded me of Kentucky Fried Chicken's mash potato and gravy--disappointing that it reminds me of a fast food restaurant. The beef brisket was actually pretty decent. I really didn't like their BBQ sauces though-- they taste very much like vinegar. The only one I thought was somewhat decent was the spicy one. My boyfriend said that his mixed vegetables reminded him of the frozen kind he buys at the store and heats up in the microwave.

Overall, if you're looking for some barbecue off the strip I would recommend Lucille's or famous Dave's barbecue. I know they are chain restaurants but I've been to Lucille's  at 10 PM at night and their food is still hot, fresh, and delicious.

In the early 90's, Mike Mills basically owned BBQ competitions.  Currently, he has about 3 locations in Illinois & 2 in Las Vegas.  This particular location was very large, complete with a bar in the middle.  However, it also appears that it has had no upkeep since it was built.  Chairs and walls were missing paint.  Arrived at 11 am and left at noon on Friday.  I was 1 of 5 tables seated and 3 of those tables only had 1 person.  On to the food.

As a competition BBQ judge, I would have judged it as:
          Ribs       4 (Appearance)   6 (Taste)  5 (Tenderness)
          Brisket   3 (Appearance)   3 (Taste)  2 (Tenderness)
We judge from 2-9.  2 being inedible, 6 being average & 9 being excellent.  These numbers would not get you in the top 10 of a competition.

I got 2 meats and two sides for $13.  The baby back ribs were the smallest I have ever seen and way over cooked.  The flavor wasn't bad though.  The brisket was under cooked, and then appeared to be warmed on a flat top prior to giving it to me.  It was dry, you know the kind of dry that you see in Las Vegas, dry.  The greens were ok - actually the best thing I was given.  The slaw was a vinegar based slaw.  It felt to me, that the cabbage had been soaking in vinegar and then pulled out and given to me. 

Two BBQ sauces on the table, both good.  A sign on the table helping you to vote them as the best BBQ in Vegas.  I sincerely hope that this is not the best in Vegas...

It would appear that Mike's recipe has been lost and if he doesn't pay attention, his business will be lost too.  Now, since we are in Vegas, care to wager whether or not I hear from any management?  I bet not.",VdGROLLl2il5-gXmdKkUMQ,11,3,2,JnQ1HwOW3yhDehOcSfs5tg

2284537,2016-08-21,1,iAuOpYDfOTuzQ6OPpEiGwA,"Let me start off by saying that if we could give halves, Memphis would be a solid 4.5 in my book.  But as is, a 4 is a bit more accurate than a 5 for me.

Memphis is one of my all-time favs.  I've been coming here for about 16 years, and I have almost never been disappointed with the food.  The building is rustic and has a comforting apple & hickory smoke scent that gets my mouth watering.  The staff is friendly (if not a bit smaller than when we first started frequenting the place), and service is generally on pace for a BBQ joint.  I've never felt rushed or unattended, and my sweet tea is always full (so I'm always happy).  

As for what to try, let me start by saying that I LOVE the baby back rack.  It's a solid portion that comes with two sides, has an even and potent (but not overpowering) smoke flavor layered underneath a dusting of magic (Magic Dust, ha!) and a tangy Memphis-style sauce.  If you're a Texas BBQ fan, this may not be your style.  But give it a chance, and I'm sure you'll be able to dig it, too. :)

Other treats on the menu include BBQ nachos (try them!), fried dill pickles (yum!), the spinach salad & baked potato combo (trust me), hot links, sliders, barbecue burger, king pork sandwich, turkey club, country fried steak, mac and cheese, potato salad, cucumber salad, and--oddly enough--caesar salad.  I haven't had everything on the menu, but these are the items I come back to again and again.

As to what to avoid, I'll just say that that's up to you.  I don't like St. Louis style ribs, so I avoid them.  Same with smoked chicken, the turkey dishes (mostly), etc.  As far as things that I've tried & been disappointed in, the brisket and burnt ends are the only things I've had that, in my opinion, were just ""meh.""

BBQ is a really personal taste, but if you're even curious about this one, you should check it out.  My money's on you finding at least one thing you really like.",pw2xAWjNqnldD9y31Rjcjw,0,2,4,qJKx7qY0KZJCYXygqtlJ8g

Wife and I split a plate of chicken and a baby back rib and pulled pork combo.  The chicken was just okay, but the ribs were very good.  This isn't a dripping wet, fall off the bone rib.  It is a super smoked lean rib that has a firm texture and a great taste.  It is not your run of the mill rib, it is very unique and tasty and I can understand why it is their signature award winning menu item.  The pulled pork was very good, flavorful and juicy and definitely on the lean side for pulled pork.

Now for the sides:  mac and cheese is a joke.  do yourself a favor and don't eat it.  tastes like kraft shells and cheese with a stick of butter.

They don't cheat you on the full rack either, usually have to bring the rest home. The ribs are very soft and almost fall off the bone, the bbQ sauce that's already on them is a little bland. The Real tasty stuff is the STICKY SAUCE, i always smother my ribs in it before i chow down. The magic dust, which is a type of seasoning is pretty tasty as well. The mac and cheese is nice and creamy, the greens and okra are quite good as well.

2618633,2014-06-28,0,iAuOpYDfOTuzQ6OPpEiGwA,"While driving past, I started craving some good tasting BBQ. Turned around and pulled in and looked it up on Yelp.  The reviews were hit or miss but I decided to go for it.  Firstly, there was no smoke smell outside from an on site pit nor the tell tale delicious smell inside.  The atmosphere was very nice and Southern and the staff was welcoming and polite. My friend and I looked over the menu and placed our orders.  While waiting for our deviled eggs appetizers, we reviewed all of the great BBQ places we have been throughout the country.  I know my ""Q"" and even smoke at home.  The eggs arrived and they were good and it was obvious that they had been pre-made and in the fridge for a bit. 
  The entre's came and I got the two meat and two sides dinner with brisket and pork shoulder with collards and red beans and rice. My friend got the pork shoulder with corn on the cob and collards as well. The corn on the cob was still raw and the collards were way over cooked, too sweet and nearly burned. We replaced both greens with fried okra and they seemed frozen and quick fried with no flavor.  The corn was replaced with hush puppies which were also bland and seemed frozen as well.  Both of our meat choices were near flavorless and watered down. The meat lacked any smoke flavor or smell as well.
I must add that our waitress was very helpful and did not bat an eye lash at all of our returns. 
  The final straw in the Mason jar was when my friend pulled a piece of plastic out of his pork. It was obviously cooked with the pork and it was cooked and shriveled. 
  The waitress came over to our table and said the whole meal was no charge for all of the items that were not up to snuff.  We left her a hefty tip for being so nice and on the way out we did not wonder why there was'nt any line coming in at 6:00 on a Friday evening.

Well, I am writing a review today for this wonderful BBQ place which I have lived less than half a mile away from for the past year and a half but have avoided trying because of poor Yelp reviews.

I felt compelled to login and post a review because the bad reviews are absolutely undeserved and unfounded as far as I can see.  At least with the food.  I didn't actually eat inside the restaurant - I drove through their window.  The service was fantastic.  The guy who helped me was patient as I perused the menu board and brought my delicious dinner to me very quickly.  I tipped him on the bill even though I drove through. 

The food - oh my word.  The food is delicious.  I bought sliders.  One chicken, one pork and one brisket.  DELICIOUS.  Meat is cooked perfectly.  BBQ sauce is fantastically tangy.  The sides were creamed corn and mashed/gravy.  Absolutely perfect.  I've had creamed corn in 5 star restaurants that wasn't as good as this.  I do make my own and it's good but this place gives me a run for my money.

Fried pickles: ooo you have to order this! It is a must! Little dill pickle chips fried to crispy perfection. The perfect little salty snack to go with your beer before your platter of meat arrives haha.

Meat: Chicken was very tender and falls off the bone. The baby back ribs were flavorful and juicy. My fiance raved about the burnt ends! I guess they take little burnt ends off of the brisket and they cook them again in some sauces and create this new magnificent dish! Gotta try! Hot links: very spicy! 

The one con that we had was the pork shoulder was a little dry, but we drenched it in BBQ sauce and it jumped back to life!

PS. I heard they got a new manager and she isnt up to snuff .. really poor dining experience. Wait staff tried but you can feel how disgruntled they are and have had to deal with irate customers. I feel sorry for them.",1yC8hbQ7b7m7_Tv4ATMXkQ,0,0,1,_-F8yfxDDigD8mtAJtB5Ig

Since we aren't actually in the south any more it is very difficult to find good and true BBQ. Memphis comes the closest out here. The pulled pork was very good but to be honest it is most certainly boiled. It still has a decent flavor though so don't pet the scare you away in the least. The coleslaw is very vinegary.

It was on a sunday evening and my husband wanted to make sure that he could watch football and sure enough they had 3 tvs in the bar area so he was happy. We wanted to try a varitey of things so we opted for:
a pick 3 appetizer with 2 order of smoked wings and skins
and grand champion platter
dessert of apple pie and pecan pie
our waitress was amazing we had lots of questions and asked for recommendations and she was happy to help out. 
appetizer was amazing the wings were perfect nice and smokey with a tangy bbq sauce. skins were crispy and filled with pulled pork topped with cheese and scallions. the dipping sauces were also good. 
The grand champion platter was definatly big enough to share it came with burnt ends, smoked chicken leg quarter, beef brisket, shredded pork shoulder and st. louis ribs. also accompanied by 2 sides. we asked for mac and cheese and red beans and rice. i love coleslaw so added an additional side for 2.49$
everything was smokey tangy bbq goodness no complaints on any of the meats except we wanted more!! 

we took dessert home but our waitress was so nice and gave us our al a mode there so it wouldnt be melted! 

we will def be back a lot of more times lololol

I eat an early lunch and they don't open until 11:00am, but I called them the day before and they said if I called at 10:30 the would be happy to make my lunch a little early and I could pick it up at 11:00.   It was very convenient because they have a drive-thru and my food was ready when I got there.

Pulled pork sandwich:  This was the real deal.  I've been to Memphis in May and had some really good pulled pork and they live up to their name.  The bun it was served on was just average, but the pork was tops.  It is served naked on the bun but they give you a small side of slaw and barbeque sauce.  The barbeques sauce was decent.

Cole Slaw - In addition to the small slaw I had ordered slaw as one of my two sides.  And I'm glad I did - the slaw was great.  It's not a mayo based slaw but a red wine vinegar base and it was delish.

Baked beans - I got the beans and it they were pretty good.  A little sweet for my taste, but I like that they used a couple different types of beans.

Ice Tea - On their website they advertise a ""Memphis House Blend Ice Tea"" sweetened or unsweetened.  I ordered sweetened on their recommendation and immediately wished I hadn't.  Not that it was too sweet - it wasn't - but I just prefer the bitterness of unsweetened in general.  The sweetened version I found to be so-so nothing mind blowing.

Sandwich, two sides, and iced tea for under $10.  Not a great deal but not bad.  I'll be going back.",ybcBGlRG0qYHI9DbXjfznA,5,4,3,z-TKSHRTfQ9ZkN8d4itG5A

The mac and cheese was nothing to write home about, and the pulled chicken was mediocre at best, super salty and a bit soggy at worst. My boyfriend ordered a slider trio and said the brisket was the best, followed by the pulled pork, with the chicken taking a distant third. The Sticky Red Sauce is great, the honey butter is yummy, and the Magic Dust is also really tasty though it packs a salty kick.

They had a special going on where all their appetizers were 50% off until about 6pm which meant we had about 15 minutes to put in our orders if we wanted to make the deadline. Most of us decided it made sense to order appetizers instead of an entree so that's what I did.

I ordered a plate called Burnt Ends which were twice smoked beef brisket nuggets which were then basted in a combination of barbecue sauces. This was definitely a winner in my book in taste. The menu price was $8.99 so 50% off was a great deal! I also ordered the Buffalo Chicken Fingers which are breaded chicken breast fillets tossed in a Buffalo wing sauce and served with ranch dressing. This was good too, not as great as the brisket as I thought it needed more barbecue sauce on it. The menu price for this was $7.99. I also ordered a basket of the Corn Muffins for $2.99. So you can see, I was able to get a great savings on what would have normally cost me $20 and more.

The waitress was a sweetheart and although she had a huge task of trying to keep all our orders straight as well as give us separate checks at the end of our meal, I felt she accomplished her job well albeit with a few check errors but otherwise we were all well-taken care of during the meal.

Ordered some BBQ for take out last night. This morning, all three of us in the house are sick as hell.  The food was well below average, I've microwaved pulled pork from the Costco freezer section that tasted better and had more flavor. Sweet Potatoes were good but only because of the massive amount of cinnamon and butter - the potatoes itself was way overcooked and mushy like baby food.

Daughter ordered the brisket plate. It was ""ok"". Very dry and tasteless. Pretty sure it was actual beef, just not quality beef. Lucky for her getting sick from it means she got to taste it twice. Both times were horrible to her. She ordered a chili which of course never made it in to the bag so I'll have to guess and say its equally horrible.

Wife ordered the burnt ends dinner - was mostly big chunks of solid fat any chunks of actual meat found tasted like it had been sitting on the counter for 2 days before being served to us. The coleslaw? WTF? This tasted like no coleslaw I've ever eaten in my life. It was basically old cabbage chopped up and tossed in vinegar. Not very appetizing so it was thrown out after one bite.

I ordered the potato skins and the sliders. Meh, skins were ok, kind of greasy but thats to be expected when you pile pork and cheese on a potato . Sliders were dry, nothing but bun, meat, and some poor excuse for a BBQ sauce. Literally tasteless and dry. Sadly not equally tasteless while leaving my system.

I'd write more but I am off to my fourth trip to the restroom to let the garbage we were served last night continue to evacuate my system.  In Vegas at 4AM you are not supposed to be hugging your toilet, you are supposed to be out having fun. Ugh NEVER AGAIN.

We came here for father's day and were in the mood to grub on some meat (the west wasn't won on salad...just sayin). Steven was our server and was very sweet, attentive and my little girl thought he was the bees knees. 

We ordered quickly because we were starving and the attention span of a 3 and 2 year old is a bit much to be desired. 

-The burnt end appetizer was so yummy. Bits of brisket that were crispy and soft at the same time over a piece of white bread with their original BBQ sauce. Definitely recommend you start out with this. 

- Kids Mac and Cheese...the kids liked it...and that's all that matters :)

- We each got a two meat combo...both with beef brisket, he got hot links and I got pork shoulder. I am not much of a sausage fan (hehehe...my dirty mind is kicking in) but it was pretty good. The pork was soft and shredded. Very flavorful but not healthy in the least (please refer to the top of this review). The beef brisket was yummy but it could have stood to have a bit more marbling (I am used to Texas brisket). Still very good. 

- The creamed corn is amazing...sweet, salty and creamy. A must have for the sides. 

- The mint chocolate chip brownie was very good...not earth shattering (this isn't Max Brenner when it comes to desserts) but definitely worth it if you have the room (the kids faces were covered in hot fudge). 

Overall a great time with my family. The prices aren't super cheap but the portions are good and the service is wonderful. Thank you Steven for a great time and we will be back to visit you for the country breakfast that you had mentioned.",COjPTDD-tFr73Gly2xL3gw,4,4,4,5mwWvGiHBkXAnnSWKKN0Xg

When ordering, I told the waitress that the last time I came was disappointing and I was excited to try again, years later. As you can tell from the five stars, this a trip was much better.
I ordered a three meat combo with hot links, brisket, and burnt ends. The sides were baked beans and framed corn. My wife had the chicken fried chicken smothered in country gravy with a baked sweet potato and baked beans. 
As we waited for our food, the waitress brought us some rolls with honey butter and let us know that the chicken was made from scratch and it took a few extra minutes to make sure it was cooked thoroughly. 
When our food came, it looked and smelled great. I am always a little concerned about ordering burnt ends as man times it comes tough and dry. These burnt ends were perfect. Full of flavor and tender with just a touch of fat. The hot links were tender and not over cooked with just the right amount of spice and the brisket was tender and juicy. The baked beans at Memphis are always great. Just the right amount of sweet and the beans are tender without being mushy. Many places try to make creamed corn and many places are unsuccessful. My creamed corn was perfect. Again, just the right amount of sweet and the texture of the corn was great.
My wife's chicken was juicy and perfectly fried with a flavorful country gravy. Her sweet potato was covered in all the fattening toppings and very tender.
We both took boxes of food home and look forward to the leftovers. I have learned over the years, that leftovers should be taken home for two reasons only. One, if you have a dog and two if you plan on eating them. I rarely take leftovers home but there was no way I was leaving this food.
Wether Memphis BBQ got a new cook, a new staff, or just made a few changes, it works so keep it up. I have become very hard t please when it come the food and I was truly pleased with this dining experience.

Here is the RIPOFF part.  When we got the bill we were charged $15.99 dinner price for the 2 meat meal.  It should have been $9.99 + $1 for the extra side, making it $10.99.  I explained to the waiter that were charged the wrong price, but he explained that the price would be the same so he charged us the dinner price?!?!?!?  

I didn't understand, so he said he would get the menu and come to explain.  He NEVER came back.  It was 1 hr. 1/2 into our lunch time at that time and we had to go.  I WILL NEVER EAT THERE AGAIN.

3606599,2010-09-29,1,iAuOpYDfOTuzQ6OPpEiGwA,"Okay, so my sister-in-law and her husband were in town and were craving a little bbq...  I made the mistake of thinking this place was ""Memphis BBQ"", like from ""Down Home with the Neeleys"".  OOPS.  Definitely not.

By the time we realized it, it was sort of too late to leave, and everyone was starving so we gave it a shot.

We started with the sampler app platter.  Biggest pile of fried stuff I'd ever seen.  I'm pretty sure they just threw the onion strings and pickles in the fryer at the same time, then poured them on the potato skins, so everything had a interesting fried, bacon, sour cream flavor.  Highlight was the wings, which were NOT fried...  tender, not oversauced, generally above-average.

The ribs (both baby back and St. Louis) were mediocre at best.  WAY over-smoked, sort of overcooked.  My husband said they tasted like kielbasa.  I don't think anyone at the table disagreed.  The funny thing is, you get your choice of sides...  My husband and I got steamed veggies (you have to save calories somewhere), and, it turns out, the portions of the ""good-for-you"" stuff are like half of the other stuff (creamed corn, mac and cheese, baked beans, fries).

There were so many appetizers that we wanted to try ... So we did. We started with an order of corn muffins, a combo basket of fried pickles and onion straws, deviled eggs, and burnt ends. The corn muffins were delicious and my favorite appetizer. Warm muffins with fresh corn baked inside - with the sweet, cinnamon sugar butter, it was tasty. The deviled eggs were OK - oddly a little sweet which I'm not used to and wasn't a huge fan of. The burnt ends were very tasty and my second favorite appetizer. The fried pickles and onion straws were just OK - a little too greasy and the fried pickles were cut too thin. 

For dinner, I ordered the combo plate of BBQ chicken and sausage links. For my two sides, I ordered steamed vegetables and sweet potato. The BBQ chicken was moist and seasoned well. Loved the sausage links - they gave a generous portion and it had a wonderful spicy kick. I wasn't impressed with the steamed vegetables and the sweet potato was too sweet (with too much butter and too much cinnamon sugar).

I have no idea how so many people have so many negative comments. I've never had cold food.

STAFF:
After hearing my friends speak so highly about the quality of BBQ coming from this place, we decided it was time to see for ourselves in April. There was TWO car loads of us coming in last minute, the restaurant was getting ready to close for the night. Instead of giving us the good ol' ""sorry, we're closed!"" attitude. We were asked if we wouldn't mind dining at their second location because the kitchen was closed, a phone call was made to their second location. The staff was incredibly sweet enough to agree to stay late to serve our party. The hostess then apologised for any inconvenience this may have caused. Are you kidding me?! It was our fault for not checking the business hours before going, so thank you! When we finally arrived to their second location, EVERYONE was incredibly hospitable, not once were we mistreated for keeping them late. 
FOOD:
It's a shame that I never photographed how amazing my food looked, and trust me, the food tasted just as amazing as it looked!

We looked up the best BBQ places in Vegas (Google) and this place was at the top. Looking over the reviews on Yelp we figured it was going to be good. 

I ordered the pork sandwich with potato salad. My wife ordered the brisket plate with mash potatoes and collard greens. 

My meal... it's hard to describe... the pork at no flavor at all...it's topped with coleslaw and BBQ sauce. I added salt...magic dust...and two kinds of BBQ sauce to get some sort of flavor going. The potato salad tasted store bought. 

My wife's plate.  Brisket.... brisket should be fork tender... no knife should ever be needed. It lacked flavor as well... and was tough/chewy.  She thought it had the consistency of boiled meat. The greens tasted like they were from a can... no flavor/seasoning. The mashed potatoes...straight from a box.  (her meal was taken off the bill as she didn't eat 95% of it.) 

When you walk in to the place... you see the grand champion signs from 12 years ago over the doors... maybe this was a killer BBQ place back then... but... I can't say the same for it now.

the meats are all fantastic, the hot links are some of the best I have had. The sides are all good and quality. The portion size is a bit small on ale carte sides but the meat and platter portions are very ample. 

They have fresh pork rinds hot from the frier and deviled eggs that remind you of the one's your aunt used to make for family reunions.

They have the best ribs and smoked bbq you will find in Las Vegas. We have catered from Memphis for almost every occasion. Their rolls are baked fresh and served warm with their awesome honey butter. The nachos are a family favorite served with crisp chips, pulled pork, cheese, red beans, green onions, sour creme, jalapeños and most importantly their sauce.

The stand out was the baked beans - delish flavor with several types of beans made this a stand out. The ribs were just average - dry and flavor less. I had to add BBQ sauce to make em edible. Links were just eh and the Mac and cheese was flat!

What was solid here was the service from my waitress Carrie. Very accommodating and whe made sure everything was good throughout my entire lunch. For her efforts I raised the overall rating of this review.

I understand the ""casual dining"" concept and as long as the food is average, the beer cold, the service decent, and the room clean, it gets an A in my book. This place gets an F.

Specifically, I ordered the half rack of ribs and a side of mac and cheese and mash potatoes. The food arrived 3 minutes after I ordered it! Now, I understand that in a place like this the food has to be cooked in advance.But 3 minutes!? It looked and tasted like it had been sitting under a heat lamp for hours. The ribs were pure fat and the mashed taters were lumps of paste. It wasn't edible.

I reserve my special distaste for the service. Yes, it was fast, but when I asked what beers they had the waitress said that she didn't know because she didn't drink beer! She went back to the kitchen to find out and upon her return had trouble pronouncing such foreign beers such as ""budweiser"" and ""coors""

The best part was the check.We had an AMEX prepaid gift card, good wherever AMEX is accepted, including Memphis BBQ. Our waitress returned the card to our table with the excuse that the cash register had never been set up for this. At this point we just wanted to get out of there so I paid with my regular green AMEX card which, surprise, surprise, was accepted with no problem!

Now, to be clear, the restaurant was clean and the food came quickly. But the management really needs to get a handle on food quality and provide some basic training for their employees.

PROS:
-Very spacious, doesn't get crowded; good for big parties/gathering
-Food comes out within minutes!
-Large portions
-Cheap
-Excellent service
-Sell their sauces

CONS:
No matter how many pros there are, the most important thing about a restaurant is the TASTE!
We ordered the Family Style Dinner for Four ($69.99) with full rack baby back ribs, 1/2lb pork, 1/2lb beef brisket, 1/2lb beef sausage, one whole chicken, baked beans, cole slaw, french fries, ane sweet cream corn, and rolls.
-YES, it is HUGE. 4 adults could not finish.
-Food came out so fast... obviously premade
-Food was lukewarm
-Every type of meat in this dish had the SAME EXACT BBQ SAUCE... boring
-Ribs barely had meat and were not tender
-Creamed corn was toooooo sweet 

I guess you will like this place if you love their sauce so much. But in my taste, I think a frozen Tony Romas baby back ribs from the market taste much better.

I don't know if they will give you free refills, but I didn't ask because I would eat those.  The brisket was very tender, flavorful and just fell apart.  Big smoke ring on it.  The pork shoulder is smoked without the skin.  This is a drawback.  The skin provides fat and also has that crunchy chicarone texture.  This pork lacked the fat from the skin and the crunch.  Pass on the port next time.  The fried okra was the hot tip.  The mac and cheese was disappointing.  It tasted good, but the texture is just like the old mac and cheese out of the Kraft box.  I think Mac N Cheese should be baked with a crusty topping.  I didn't finish my meal so I could try the Bread Pudding.  This was the BOMB.  You gotta save room for this pudding.

My office ordered from here last week and we were able to order a variety of items to try. I was able to try four different meats, five sides, and cornbread muffins.

Let's start with meat since that is the main reason one would visit a BBQ restaurant. The sausage was my favorite meat. It was slightly spicy and smoky with a nice amount of moistness. The chicken was moist and had a nice flavor. The burnt ends had a nice flavor and plenty of tasty sauce, but the pieces were inconsistent on moistness. Some of the pieces were most, but others were dry. The brisket had okay flavor, but was some of the driest brisket I've had from any BBQ restaurant. I liked the flavor of the BBQ sauce that came on the side. 

My favorite sides was the baked beans because they had a nice sweet taste. The beans were also a variety of kinds which made it a little different. The fried okra was awesome and I liked that the breading was light. The macaroni and cheese was sufficient, but not amazing. Mashed potatoes seemed instant. The steamed vegetables were good for a healthy side. I liked the cornbread muffins. They were moist when warm and the honey butter was a nice touch. 

The takeout order was well packaged. The BBQ sauce came in individual cups and anything that could leak was inside of a plastic bag. They also included plates and utensils.",3nIuSCZk5f_2WWYMLN7h3w,4,3,3,PeQeiir8ufanxmStmMERcQ

I stopped in at Memphis BBQ because I was on a lunch break and I've been exploring this new part of town where I'm training for work. I figured I would pop in and just see how long a to-go order would take. Apparently not long... dependent upon what you happened to order. But they have a take-out menu located by the cashier area, so they must get a lot of take-outs anyway. The restaurant seemed quiet to me, but it could have been because it was just a  weird time of the day.

I ended up ordering the ""King"" pulled-pork sandwich, which comes with two sides. I opted for french fries because I have been taking a medication that makes me sick unless I have a really big, hefty meal, and I decided to go lighter with my second side and got the cucumber salad (which the menu says is seasonal). Okay, so I sit back and wait.

My meal comes out fairly quickly in a big styrofoam container and I make my way back to work. When I open my container I am greeted by fries and my sandwich wrapped in tinfoil. When I open the tinfoil... I couldn't have been more disappointed. This sandwich looked like it came slopped out of a school cafeteria - NOT a championship BBQ joint. Oh and the taste was the same. The bun was some horrible white-bread concoction I could get at a cheap company picnic. The meat had no flavor... no BBQ flavor at all! They did give me a container of sauce which I immediately dumped all over the meat, but it didn't have a kick to it... it was just kind of blah. The cucumber salad was not refreshing. It was soaked in a very, very sweet slime-sauce. I felt like I was eating straight-up high fructose corn syrup (and I probably was). The fries were uneventful, just fries, nothing more.

I highly doubt I would give Memphis BBQ another try. I'd probably just go to Famous Dave's if I wanted mediocre BBQ.",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,2,0,2,OKgPKZDYciW20_c2o9Ibww

When we arrived (Friday night) there was not too many people there, although people did keep showing up. Which upset me because this place is awesome.

We ordered for an app the Memphis Sampler Plate which included onion straws, burnt ends and Memphis skins with extra dipping sauce, The King sandwich (pulled pork and cole slaw with hush puppies and macaroni and cheese on the side), and the Southern Catfish entree (with macaroni and cheese and fried okra on the side).

The app was great, the Memphis skins are to die for so I recommend those to anyone, the burnt ends were good too but I got a few fatty bits, and the onions stings were actually onion rings but they were yummy and greasy.

My dinner was The King pulled pork sandwich. The sandwich itself was delicious, and the hush puppies were crispy and fluffy on the inside. My macaroni and cheese was good too, nice and creamy.  My friend ordered the catfish meal, she said her fish was very good and nice and crispy although her macaroni and cheese was definitely not as creamy as mine. It was almost like her serving was the last of an old batch and I got a serving from a new one (compare the pictures). Also, her fried okra was not very good, but our waiter had no problem replacing it with another order of (the new and creamier) macaroni and cheese, so it was all good.

I had the pork shoulder. Description claimed it was shredded but it was mostly chopped in to small pieces. The meat was moist but it was missing that smokey flavor. Others had the BBQ chicken and burnt ends. Nobody raved about it. 

The biggest disappointment was the sides. Mashed potatoes did not seem to be house made and were covered in what seemed to be canned beef gravy. One person ordered chicken. Beef gravy doesn't fit. Hush puppies were overcooked. I had the Mac and cheese and it was clearly from a box. In a BBQ joint, that's completely unacceptable.

It was so bad that this is the first place in a long time that I was tempted to call the SNHD and file a complaint against them. 

If you want good BBQ in Las Vegas, this is NOT IT. Do yourself a favor and go anywhere else but here. Their quality has went off the cliff, and they don't seem to realize anything's wrong.

There was no wait for seating, but I wouldn't have minded a few minute wait if it meant we would get a clean table. Instead we got a wobbly table with crumbs on it, empty jar of their ""magic dust"", a black money bag under the leg in a sad attempt to balance it, and scraps of bread and fries underneath it from whomever had eaten there before us. The ac want really putting off cold air, but they have fans circulating the air, making it tolerable, but not completely comfortable. It was not a good first impression.
Our waitress was great, very attentive, interacted with our kids, drinks stayed full, and all the staff that happened to pass near our table were kind and friendly.
For the food, sweet tea was good, nothing to rave about, but it was good quality tea. My son had the kids chicken and fries, not real chicken breast, more like the frozen processed chicken strips. Fries were ok, not too crispy, but edible. The bread they serve is a basic dinner roll you can buy at a grocery store, probably pulled right out of the package and put on our plate because it wasn't hot. Their Honey butter was delicious though.
 My husband ordered the three meat combo, buffalo wings, hot links, and baby back ribs with corn and mac n cheese. He said the ribs were fatty, but ok, wished they had put a bit of a char on the links, the buffalo wing sauce was really hot, he likes spicy food, but these, for him, were the almost couldn't eat them kind of hot, which probably would be enjoyable for some people. His corn was fresh, crisp and delicious, i wish i had stolen a bite, and the mac n cheese was good.

I ordered the two meat combo. I had the burnt ends and the brisket, with veggies and their sweet potato to share with my daughter. Burnt ends were delicious, if you end up eating here, give them a try. The brisket... i could hardly eat it, there was no flavor to the meat, i covered it in bbq sauce, but still couldn't get through more than a bite or two. The potato with brown sugar and butter sauce was good, and the veggies were seasoned well, but definitely were the chopped mixed veggies you buy frozen in a bag, mostly carrots, broccoli was more chopped stalks than the head, and one piece of cauliflower. The seasoning was good enough though, we ate it.
 We won't be back to this restaurant, the people were nice enough, but the food just wasn't real quality bbq.",-ny1Bf-sGl2w1RGMmTOzYw,0,1,2,H062SIhNegrvrgxSxNrbqQ

Last week was our first time, and since I hadn't had anything on the menu, I was a bit unsure of what to order. The head waitress (Patricia) who was handling our table made a suggestion of either the Catfish or the Brisket. I ended up choosing the Brisket, and damn was I impressed.

The quality of the meat is very good. It was not greasy at all. I was informed that it's cooked for 18-20 hours before serving, which makes it very tender. Their sauce is also amazing, as well as their ""magic dust"" seasoning.

Drinks were served in mason jars, since we didn't order anything alcoholic. Their apple tea, sweet tea, and lemonade are all very tasty as well.

We walked in and delicious food smell welcomed us. We were seated right away in a booth. They lose one star because our server took more than awhile to finally greet us. By the time she came around to greet us, we were ready to order. I ordered a full rack of baby back ribs and my friend got a sandwich combo (lunch menu). She came back with our drinks and honestly, I was like 'what is this'. They serve drinks in a huge glass jar (empty jam jars, I suppose). I didn't complain. More drinks, less refills. Food came out fairly quickly. My friend's sandwich combo came with a bowl of chili. It was filled with pulled-brisket topped with coleslaw. My friend said it was good. Baby back ribs were also pretty good. Tender, juicy but one thing I didn't like about it was that it wasn't covered with sauce like other places do with their ribs. You have to put sauce yourself and you have four choices: Original, spicy, sweet and sour (I think?), and can't remember the last one at all. But the sauce were delicious and I was happy to finally satisfy my baby back ribs craving. 

One interesting thing about this place is once in awhile, you will hear a loud train sound, like you are eating in a train station or something. I flinched pretty bad the first time it happened, but after second and third time, I just thought it was kinda annoying. But anyways, overall, the food was pretty good, i think the service could use a little improvement, but definitely a good place to get some baby back ribs.

Easy to find. Next to a BofA.

The basket of bread you get is pretty good. Bread itself is light and airy, but you have to spread some of that honey butter on it. YUUUUM. Makes all the difference.

I got the full rack of St. Louis. HUGE. This might have been the biggest full rack I've ever had in my life. Meat was tasty, but not the best I've had. Sauce wasn't overly tart or overly sweet, and also not so bold. Maybe people in Vegas like their sauces more mild. I got the mac and cheese - tasty. Green beans - just alright. Too much butter and it was sitting in all this liquid. Not too much flavor either. Wouldn't recommend this.

I tried parts of hubbys variety dish with brisket, hot link, pulled pork and chicken. All were average. I enjoyed the brisket the most. Hot link was a little too hot for my taste. Bulled pork was more like butchered pork because it was just too too shreded. Chicken was regular chicken.

Coleslaw was probably the best side that I tasted. It's not the creamy kind, but the vinegar kind. Light and very tasty.

I'm not going to really post a review on the food because we all know about ribs and brisket and pulled pork. do yourself a favor guys when it comes to bbq there's so many better options than this place whoever says that this is the place for bbq really doesn't know their stuff or must be on something.. I will say that do not and I repeat do not order salads here or their red beans and rice because it was garbage. the vegetables weren't fresh at all. if you walk in here as well they don't leave their A/C on so it's kinda hot in here. tried to give this place the benefit of the doubt because a couple of my family members but will never come back,aWXGwath_dSGPwNdFiy9BQ,2,1,2,V69ZnCDMnQ_1udY-s3Lu8w

So, had to at least try Memphis Championship Barbecue during my recent visit to Vegas.

Truth in advertising - I stopped by for a late dinner about 30 minutes before closing which may account for the review that follows.

I had the 2 meat combination platter consisting of pork and ""burnt ends"" which is brisket that is generally double smoked with the sides of vinegar based coleslaw and baked beans with hushpuppies and rolls.

The pork was acceptable, nothing exceptional.  The burnt ends left quite a bit to be desired.  They were dry and tough - not what I expect from my barbecue.  Coleslaw and beans were tasty and hushpuppies were fair.

So my meal wasn't quite as good as I would have liked, but getting the meal right before closing might have had something to do with that.  I would give them a try again, but would ensure it was during the main dinner hour so there could not be any excuses for the meat.",_p-PTWqt7SM3sxilgerjTQ,0,0,3,ZE5IDUCl6lbhoEt0Qd7vPg

Fast forward 18 years though and it is a different story.  The food is just ok.  The service has always been good, especially by Sean, who genuinely seems to like his customers.  The problem with Memphis Championship Barbecue is that they have not repaired, updated, or given this restaurant the TLC needed. The booths are ruined with springs coming out of the seats. The bathroom isn't necessarily dirty, but it is very rundown.

Ownership needs to renovate desperately, or just give up and close the doors.  My kids love this place and every time we are on this side of town, they want to go there, but I have gotten to the point that I don't want to come here anymore.

In an emergency last minute situation, I found myself house/dog sitting for a friend in my neighborhood.

I was overly zealous and ordered  three meat combo so that I would have enough to bring to work for lunch the next couple of days. I got the baby back ribs, pulled pork and brisket. For sides I ordered collard greens and the mac n cheese.  

So let's start with the highlights shall we???

Mac n cheese was solid. Nothing particularly memorable but still delish. Baby back ribs were also pretty tasty and tender.. What really stood out was the collards. They weren't the watery/funky/musky that are found at most places. They had a great balance of vinegar without going overboard. Pleasant surprise!

Pulled pork... Decent. Also not memorable.

Brisket... Blah. Dry dry dry. Even when doused with sauce. Let's just say that part of tomorrow's planned lunch went to the dogs I'm sitting.

Will I go again? Probably at some point when the memory fades to black again. Just because of the pure convenience of the proximity and the drive thru. If I have time to sit down, not so much.",BbwldZQM1i89cAvV7fce3A,9,6,3,8cJBnf8mTuBWHgwmdTdHmQ

No more. Likely, never again.

The burnt ends were dry and sugary. The brisket was tough. The pork shoulder was a wet mess. The mac and cheese was gummy and dry. The sweet rolls were stale and cold. And, the fried pickles, a personal favorite, were burned and greasy.  

The only things that were as I remembered were the apple sweet tea and cinnamon sugar butter for the rolls.

Making matters worse, everything cost more and the portions were smaller.  I might have been OK with this if the quality was there, but it was not.

They have completely butchered them! It used to be that they cut the ends off of the brisket and put them back in the smoker with additional sauces and magic dust for more flavor and over time you can taste the difference. They don't put them back in the smoker. They are tougher and taste like they have been sitting in a warm tub of barbeque sauce.

I know Mike Mills (not the REM bassist, sadly) is like the Alain Ducasse of BBQ. And there have maybe been like two times that I've eaten at Memphis Championship and kind of got a glimpse of what the fuss is all about - but the thing is, I've been there about seven or eight times.

When the pulled pork actually tastes like smoke, it's a revelation - but half the time it's bland and stringy. Their baby back ribs were probably the driest, least tender ribs I've ever had at a 'que joint. Thankfully, the Magic Dust is legit - frankly the best part of eating Memphis Championship BBQ. It's not the sauce, it's not the meat, it's not the smoke - it's the dust.

As for the all-important BBQ sides, the onion straws are addictive, and the fried dill pickles are awesome so long as you get to them before the inside of the pickle soaks through the breading. None of the other sides that I've tried really stand out.

Their sweet tea is pretty off the hook though - I think they use apple blossom honey in it or something. It's like crack.

I dunno. Maybe Mike Mills needs to come into Vegas and whip his kitchen into shape - because a place with this much hype around it and such a big name behind it - should be better.",n-U5fa4B0hKfmRSZ-M7BMg,2,1,3,ZpkVFqdlW2dFCP67aig2Iw

Just like every other time you start making plans for dinner we started out him hawing around and not really knowing where we planned on going until someone threw out Lucille's in the district. Yes, I completely understand that is a chain but at the same time they have awesome food and great sweet tea. As the waiting began some plans changed and we ended up deciding that we would go to Memphis Championship BBQ. 

Walking into this place is like walking into an old country setting which I obviously understand since it a BBQ joint but the place was dead. This didn't make too much sense to me since from what I have heard it is ""THE"" best Barbecue in town.... Our table ordered a few different appetizers to start. The Fried Pickles, Hot link and smoked Cheese and the Onion strings. The appetizers were good, the fried pickles stand out in the bunch but then comes the meal. Now to be honest I was let down by the menu choices, particularly the sides, it was really run of the mill. Green beans, mac and cheese, mashed potatoes and steamed veggies. After deciding on the 2 meat combo Burnt ends and pulled pork shoulder I settled for Mac and cheese and steamed veggies as the sides. 

Now for the meat and potatoes of this review, no pun intended. The waitress came to the table with our meals and the first thing that popped into my mind was, "" for the price this is pretty chintzy""  when I think BBQ I think large portions, sauce all over the place, Tangy Spicy goodness and unfortunately in this case It was the complete opposite, small portions, lacking sauce and overall flavor. My Burnt end which looked like a small pile of beef jerky nuggets could not me much more dry so I attempted to see if they had any buoyancy and floated them in the BBQ sauce that is on the table. As for the pork shoulder, well it was pulled pork shoulder with a splash of sauce in the middle of the pile, it was definitely lacking. 

I can deal with bad BBQ meat, it is a matter of just covering it in BBQ sauce and covering the flavors but the sides which are supposed to be like the back up singers are to lady gaga were much more like the closing of the coffin for the place. The steamed veggies looked and tasted as if they do a daily steaming and just serve them all day until they run out, wilted and dry and terrible flavor and the mac and cheese was just eh. 

From everything I have read about this place it sounds like it may have been the king pit in town at one point but over time some things tend to change, and this must be one of them because i honestly think taking a seat and the table of famous Dave would be a better option at this point, this is sad because of the history this place seems to have in the BBQ industry here in Vegas and well....

  The grilled chicken sandwich texture was like rubber, much like a frozen chicken breast taste after cooking quickly. In addition it was covered in seasoning and that didn't help the taste. 

 The pulled chicken sandwich was fine on top but when getting further to the bun there was a layer of oil to the point the bun was saturated. 

 Don't know what happened but will not return. Looking at the reviews in the past year it looks like this is not an isolated issue",_8HgkWoBTt5cahLRNsd_xQ,0,0,1,y6h4RD2P3YSGHgvihxqJKw

The rolls were flavorless. The only thing good was the fried okra. That is because it is frozen in a bag, drop in fryer and serve. Hard to ruin.

The burnt ends were very good.  Very flavorful and not dried out.  The ribs however were not to my liking.  They were on the dry side.  Just didn't like the flavor at all. There are 2 sauces on the table.  I tried both of them.  Again just didn't enjoy the flavors.   I know the sauces are award winning, just not to my liking.

The red beans and rice, the rice was a little undercooked but wasn't terrible, and the Mac and cheese was a little runny but had good taste.

According to my company I am the expert. So when I heard about Memphis championship barbecue I was a bit excited to come in. 
I came in for lunch and although was in the afternoon there was no one at the door. I walked up to the bar sat down had some small talk with the bartender and place my order. She was not overly enthused about the menu items but I still ordered. First you never put something on the plate that you can eat so the kale has to go. Second you don't put ramekins with coleslaw etc. on the plate because they've been touched. Third The ribs that I ordered were supposed to be the St. Louis but were incredibly thin and reminiscent of baby back's. I asked him to take it off my bill because I was going to eat it. Lastly the beef brisket tasted like brisket. In other words it in fall apart there was no bark and it was a bit tough. All in all I'm not a fan. They should go over to rolling smoke or TC's rib crib or bells and move their operation to be more progressive have a tasting",FRxGcIRukrH5lW2SQSxstg,0,0,2,iao-6yXYf_hrbwivZr7CYw

It took a while for drinks, appetizers, and food to come (possibly because of the hour we came).. but I will say that our time spent with the waitress, she was definitely on it; she ranks higher than the food and kept my Kerr's mug filled to the brim! 

Food wise: We started with fried pickles... yes, I understand they were pickles.. and fried, but they were toooooo salty, and soggy/chewy. I have never had them before, nor have I ever fried pickles, but I now understand that frying pickles may be a hard feat. This marked my sodium overload for the day.

For dinner, I got the sandwich/salad combo and I stuck with a chicken sandwich. It was dry, and I ended up just eating the chicken without the bun because I wasn't a fan of the bun. Still, the chicken was dry, and I didn't finish it.  Will say that the croutons on the salad were pretty good! My dad got the pulled pork sandwich, and he said he liked it.... but dad's taste-buds aren't all up to par:]

What we had to try out was pulled chicken and or pulled pork sandwiches, baked beans and coleslaw.

The baked beans were very very good and the coleslaw was sweet and moist. I liked it a lot and I am picky when it comes to coleslaw as I like mine on the sweeter side!

It was really good I have to say and their catering employees serving the food are very friendly and informative.

Their BBQ sauce is a bit less sweet and more watery than I am used to. I usually like a thicker and more sweeter BBQ sauce.

I will be back, I even brought a plate home for my boyfriend and he really enjoyed it as well :)

5850468,2018-04-15,0,iAuOpYDfOTuzQ6OPpEiGwA,"We first tried MCB almost a decade ago.  The food wouldn't win any competitions and the service was awful.  After food was delivered, the waitresses would disappear.  We looked around the restaurant and saw others just looking around and experiencing the same bad service.  Guests should not have to wave you over for refills. 

We were in the area again recently and gave them another visit, hoping we would see improvements.  Unfortunately, we experienced the same poor service.  When food was delivered, the waitress asked us if we needed anything.  At the time, we didn't and we didn't see her again until she tried to sell us dessert. The restaurant only had three other tables filled.  There really is no good excuse for that level of inattentive service.

Again, the food was forgettable.  Good BBQ requires attention and patience.  Try to rush the process or cut corners and you get a dry, flavorless product.  Their chicken was rubbery and likely reheated leftovers.  The pork was more shredded than pulled and topped with a thin sauce that was mostly grease which is something you do to conceal poor, dry meat.

When the food and service is bad, it's always a sign of bad management who doesn't seem to be involved enough to know they're failing.  This restaurant is in serious need of retraining.",eRsIWgIoaVkzgdF6_bgCwA,0,0,2,xcZ-rkn702xwD25EAMSPyA

I've been a loyal MCB and Mike Mills fan for well over a decade, and I've been regularly eating at various locations of the popular BBQ restaurant in Vegas for at least that long. My recent trip back this week for what was once divine, heavenly BBQ shattered my perception of a longtime favorite. 

The place was deserted on a Tuesday night, and unfortunately, now I know why... 

God help us all, the BBQ at MCB was NOT good on this visit... And after reading recent Yelp reviews, it appears that management is allowing the once high ""Mills"" standards to fall. The pork was greasy, stringy, not very flavorful, and not very smoky. The ribs were better than the pork, but still not what they used to be. Stellar meat, no longer...

Service was slow and distracted, at best. Our server even felt so comfortable that he sat at another customer's table for 10 minutes or so, chatting.

My usual sides of turnip greens and red beans and rice have been reduced from a decent size bowl to a tiny cup, but at least they were still delicious, as were the rolls and cinnamon butter.

Mike, if you're listening, get your ass back to Vegas and crack the whip. The Rainbow location has already closed... It would TRULY be a shame to see MCB go down in flames",uIB8qFzG5E3PUGfiCiUmqg,0,0,3,ibKGUQ228DfwvL80zAzPTw

None of these had any BBQ smokey goodness I've come to expect from a BBQ establishment. The meats were really bland and w/o any indication that it was cooked in an open pit or fire. Hell I would've been happy even with a splash of liquid smoke!
