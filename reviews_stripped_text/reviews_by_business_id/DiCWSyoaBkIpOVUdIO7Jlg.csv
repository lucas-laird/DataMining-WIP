I ordered the chicken pad Thai. The first bite was good. Then it just got sweeter and sweeter. It was drenched in that sweet sauce. I couldn't even finish my meal. The only yummy thing I could finish was egg drop soup. I love crab Rangoon but it tasted like they used a super sweet yogurt as the filling. 
My husband ordered the general tso. His favorite...he couldn't finish his meal. His was also way too sweet. Needless to say we won't be going back.",as0FA-stdOFd3rmx0FBRZQ,1,0,1,TGyRWV3_oju5TeiPqLwMJA

First time here and I must say it was not pleasant. 
2 stars are simple. 1st goes to the outstanding service, 2nd for clean environment.

I wish.. I WISH, I could say the food deserves a couple stars but unfortunately not. Those who gave more than 2 stars must have no tastebuds or could care less for freshly cooked quality meals (just saying). 

I think the egg drop soup was the best out of the meal I ordered. 

I ordered the sweet & sour chicken, egg-roll and pork fried rice combo. 

I knew I should've ordered the white steamed rice.
The pork fried rice looked suspect as hell. Tasted like it was a week old. Very bland and dry tasting. Took one bite and called it a day.. 

Seems like they buy the egg-rolls frozen and just throw it in the oven. Idk but once I bit into it, straight MUSH.. I immediately spit that into my napkin. Like honestly who messes up on an egg-roll? 

The sweet and sour chicken was alright, besides the fact it wasn't as crisp as I hoped it'd be.. Soggy from the watery consistency of the sauce perhaps? The whole meal wasn't even hot! Cmonnnnnnnnn man!

My cousin ordered the magnolian beef combo.. And that just didn't look appetizing at all. Thats all I have to say about that.. 

I believe in second chances but sometimes once is enough. 

Sorry not sorry Little Dumplings. Step it up in the kitchen! You're at a great location thats constantly busy, hope you guys make it work somehow. Take these reviews into consideration for your business's sake.

Being that in my job i am not able to walk away from my post to go get lunch, i decided chinese food sounded great and found this place.. amazing prices and delicious looking meals.. I called to order mine and other coworkers food. The woman on the line was very attentive and kind. Gave me my total and the amount of time it would take for them to arrive at my location. I had asked the woman about the $2 delivery charge on their website. she informed me that the charge is to TIP THE DRIVER. I said thank you and hung up. After the 45 minute wait for my food, a man came into my place of work and dropped it off. i handed him the cash and he counted it in front of me. then he turns around from the door and says ""no more tip for me?"" I had informed him that there was extra cash in there from what our total was and that the woman who answered the call and took our order had said the tip for him was already in my bill.. he began to ask who i had spoken to and kept saying that the tip was not included. 

I must say that i was incredibly upset about this mans attitude. If someone at your place of business informs a customer that tip is already included in their bill for their food, that is what it is.. and if they don't actually do it that way, the woman needs to make sure not to inform costumers of that. 

Besides that, the food smells great, however i am too appalled by the attitude of that man to even desire to try it at the moment. Needless to say i will try the food and possibly go in, if i can get over the attitude of the man.

Although it was midafternoon, I was still surprised that we were the only diners in the place. Maybe that's because the food was hit and miss.

Whenever I try a new thai restaurant, I always order the pad thai. This was a goopy concoction with oversweet sauce and rubbery shrimp. Not appealing at all. My husband lucked out in ordering the beef and snow peas. The meat was served in a tasty teriyaki sauce with crunchy snow peas, onions, and water chestnuts. His fried rice was so-so, and our spring rolls were obviously frozen, but each of our soups (egg drop for him, hot and sour for me) was good, and our server was prompt and pleasant.

This restaurant is far enough away from my house that I'll probably never return. But Little Dumpling better step up its game if it wants to lure diners in a strip mall that's filled with other ethnic offerings. Next time I'm in the neighborhood, I think I'll stop in next door at Geisha House. (Or I might just opt for a Costco hot dog...)",55bAo20xQNIA2CfMKIDtPA,0,0,2,Z7cFxNAzZC98-It5UYIwTA

When I taking friends there, though, they were not particularly happy with the service, but I think it's pretty standard for this type of restaurant. Also, most of the food is cooked with quite a bit of oil so it's definitely high in calories.

1479354,2012-03-25,0,DiCWSyoaBkIpOVUdIO7Jlg,"Finally a decent Chinese restaurant in N. Las Vegas!

Started with good atmosphere inside when we walked in.

Ordered bowl of Hot N Sour soup, looks like you could feed 6-8 with it.  Very tasty, not too spicy to cause hiccups, also ingredients tasted very fresh.  Had a little taste of sweet which was unique.

Next we ordered 2 dishes.  

Hong Kong Pan Fried Noodle w/ Vegetables.  Comes with Shrimp, Beef, Chicken & Pork covered in a very tasty brown sauce.  The vegetables in this dish were cooked to perfection.  Every other place I have been to, the zucchini are mushy and the broccoli are limp, but not here!  They had the perfect texture & bounce.  Also the meat was tender & each tasted as their own flavor instead of everything tasting like seafood.

Orange Chicken.  Very fresh and very crispy.  The sauce that came with it was reduced to an extremely thick glaze that worked very well with the crispy breading on this chicken.  A little went along way.  Also came with white steamed rice which was cooked nicely.

Due to the rest of the over cooked mediocre Chinese restaurants in the area, I am giving this one 5 stars.  Took me a while to work through the rest, now I have found the best in N. Las Vegas.  Thank you Little Dumplings!

I ordered the beef panang.  It's not the tastiest panang I've ever had, but referring back to the price for the whole meal, and the ample portion, I was pleased.  I had a decent portion of beef, mixed with carrots, onions, bell peppers and the panang sauce.  Mixed with a nice scoop of rice, I couldn't finish the meal.  My wife had Mongolian beef.  She complained that it wasn't spicy enough, and indicated that it was more like a teriyaki beef.  I think that if she asked them to spice it up, they'd be willing to put enough chiles and peppers to make her nose run.

The gravy could have used a little more salt and so could the eggs, the pad thai was ok. a little too sweet for my tastes and the sauce was very thin and didn't really stick to the noodles.

Wonton Soup: Flavorless. I think I know how this was made - (1) Boil water and add frozen, mixed veggies, (2) Add 5 wontons. 

Panfried Chow Mein: It was fried, making it the best thing I ate out of the three items ordered.

Panang Curry: Curiosity got the best of me when I ventured to the ""Thai"" section of the menu. Sadly, the curry had a watery consistency. Not good at all.

 I ordered water to drink and he got pink lemonade. This is going to sound crazy, but that water was disgusting. It was stinky and had a horrible after taste. Seriously! Water! I got nervous because I've never had ""bad"" water while eating out. My husband's drink had the same fully after taste. 

I had the corn and egg soup. It wasn't bad or good so that was kind of a wash. 

My husband hand the chicken chili mint. That's his favorite Thai dish. It didn't really look or taste like the traditional chicken chili mint. It wasn't really spicy and was covered in a thick sauce which is not normal either. I had the General Taos Chicken lunch meal that comes with, fried rice and crab rangoon. 

The Chicken was good at first but half way through the extremely sweet taste was too much. It was almost like it was covered in a marmalade. The crab rangoons which are always my favorite were also extremely sweet in the filling. It was almost like frosting in taste and texture. Not pleasant, so I didn't finish the 1st one let alone touch the second. The fried rice was bland. I mean really bland. It was eating white rice that just looked brown. 

Needless to say, we won't be going back there at all. I guess we've been spoiled with the food at other places like the Bangkok Orchid in Green Valley.

I should have known better when the server said ""just to let you know it's American style"". Not knowing what that actually meant, I figured I would try it. Big mistake. It wasn't anything like curry. They didn't even use coconut milk. It was just some chicken in some kind of gooey green sauce. It wasn't horrible, but not what I wanted. Actually I think this was their version of green curry and I ordered the yellow. Who knows maybe the yellow is better?

All that being considered carefully, this was the worst Chinese food I've had.  Ever.  It was so bad that I am not even willing to give them a second chance. 

The Gen Tso chicken - had the texture of precooked, frozen, deep fried, re-deep fried and then deep fried, again.  It wouldn't break down after chewing it & chewing it.  Dry, flavorless, with goopy syrup at the bottom.  I could have soaked it in water and it would have kept its dry texture.
People who have raved about this dish from here have never had good Gen Tso.  

BBQ Pork fried rice - Tasteless.  No bbq flavor except they may have dripped some liquid smoke into it.  Plus, very greasy.

Chicken Fried rice - Weird Chemical aroma and tasteless.  Plus, very greasy.

House special dumplings - These were fairly tasty, I have to say, but again very greasy.

Egg rolls -  these were inedible.  Shiny pools of dripping greasy oil.  No exaggeration.  Almost soggy.

Corn soup -  Slimy with about 5 kernels of corn through the pint.  Tasted like gelatin.

Overall the consensus was that we didn't really have anything great. Everything was just kind of ok. The Mongolian beef wasn't too hot and the eggplant was a little undercooked.

This place is gross.  I ordered 3 things in an attempt to not go wrong.
#1 Chicken wings
#2 Chicken pad thai
#3 Mooshoo Shrimp 

ALL BAD!
The chicken wings are battered in bisquik,  WHY!?  what for?  I'm not saying not to season fried chicken but no asian joint makes wings that come out looking like fried oreos from a carnival.   

The chicken pad thai,  I hate when restaurants don't soak the noodles long enough so they come out undercooked.  The sauce used tasted like Mcdonlads BBQ sauce and they breaded the chicken.  So literally its like a rice based fettuccine with BBq sauce and chicken nuggets.
Instead of traditional sprouts it came with iceberg lettuce and carrots?  just WTF!

The moo shoo , comes in beef chicken or shrimp.  NO PORK which is traditionally what it should be was dripping wet with sauce and came with more sauce on the side.

We took two bites of everything and asked for the check.
I can't stand businesses who will ask you if you want a box to go but not ask you what's wrong if you choose to say no thanks with 80% full dishes.   So I really don't give a rats ass if they gave me service with a smile.  That smile is on auto pilot,  if they really cared, they'd ask me how come I'm wasting all this food.

I actually thought the decor was rather nice and being there was other patrons I thought ot myself how bad could this place be?   WRONG!  WRONG! WRONG!

There is a reason shitty places like these are not in china town, because they wouldn't last a day against real competition.   

Bottom line,  if you're in the mood for anything asian, get your butt to china town.  Otherwise you're better off getting pizza or chipotle across the street.   Holy hell this place was gross.",udSgW1BGOjP4lw9_Fsqqpg,0,0,1,4TpT6Ap1OaHB2GOwBItGHA

I have tired lot of Thai restaurant in Vegas but this is not the best one .  The curry we had was the worst flavor ever.
Pad see noodle was good
Tired this few time since its closet place to my home",p_jqFtAmqAYlcw88GUTPFA,0,0,3,Jekd_f6qhxXMaG7_CProLA

The front of the restaurant was well kept, but the glass to the kitchen was obscured to keep out patrons. I always like to see a restaurant confident enough to display their kitchen. But what I haven't seen is a kitchen bold enough to install glass for viewing the kitchen just to later obscure the glass from viewing. Interesting

Hospitality: 3 stars
The staff was attentive and polite but spoke very little English. When ordering our food didn't come out accurate. They quickly apologized and corrected the meal.

Food: 5 Stars
The portions are very large, the vegetables came out crispy and fresh. All entrees were tasty and hot. The appetizer was smaller than anticipated but the dinner portions were very large.

Overall:
This place is great for a ""quick sit down"" meal and for carry out but not for a dress up date night.",nVNG_EGrrES_KaZx3USxZg,0,0,4,sS-blOSiCoOnuGSsoffcAg

I didn't get it as spicy as I normally would have (I never do the first time I try a new place, just in case!) but it was still delicious. The flavor was phenomenal. I ordered through Grubhub and it arrived early, which was a bonus. They also have good coupons through Grubhub so that was great! Their house dumplings were also fantastic. I'll probably be ordering from here every week!",VruMFEJRddtg2GeoVC7gMg,0,0,5,URRK6ixYsIlgvXDm-Xd2ig

Kung Pao chicken and the beef and broccoli is very good.
Nice quite place. We will be back, cause this is now my favorite Chinese food spot.",OwUwO6wdVSrUUUyXnVMYVg,0,0,4,kqkTyuw7GW_UpGIVnuEZVA

Delivery is always much quicker than they estimate, which is nice...and most of the food has always been great; however, yesterday, I ordered orange chicken and the combo fried rice (lots of it) to take to a family function...and of course, on the day I want the food to be the best, it was the worst!  The orange chicken had this thick, goopy sauce on it and was covered in sugar.  It was disgusting.  The rice had a burnt taste to it, which was weird, because this rice in the past was the best ever.  I don't understand it, but was extremely disappointed.  Also, in the past, I ordered shrimp with lobster sauce.  It was gross, as it was like soup...like nothing I had ever seen before.",iSFnLrF8vHZW_bkfwKFBCw,1,0,3,S9X3iP4IGlBrRWWDN7asCQ
