If you get a burrito be sure to get it enchilada style.

They offer a punch card and every 10th meal is free. Another great perk

Please don't compare this to chipotle. They are just not the same. Very different flavors and a slightly different style.

The biggest failure was in the dining room. All of the shift focus on this day was on the ""line"". No one was looking at service through the customer eye. Tables were dirty and trash cans were overflowing. The regular coke was ""out"" and it took 20 mins from the time I sat down before an employee cleared tables and did a trash run.

I asked the cashier who then looked at the sauce and also noted it looking thinner than normal, so she asked the chef. 

The response she came back with was that they were low on that salsa, so they had watered it down to stretch it out!!

Price Total: $11.08
 
The Good: Fresh Ingredients, Lots of topping choices

The Bad: WAY TOO EXPENSIVE! Essentially this place is doing the exact same thing Chipotle and Zaba's does only Chipotle and Zaba's do it better for cheaper. A single Taco here costs $5 to start with. My tostada (which was more like a Taco Salad) was $9 BEFORE I even ordered a drink! They don't fry the shell like most other places would. You could get 2 HUGE Taco Salads from Roberto's Taco Shop for the price of 1 REGULAR one here. This place prides itself on the idea that they make their own tortillas and the fact they have pork barbacoa. (1) Their tortillas are bland and there is NOTHING special about them. (2) Their pork barbacoa is tangy and tasty but it tastes like that cheap BBQ you would get at a buffet. ""Tacos El Gordo"" makes MUCH BETTER Barbacoa for only $2/taco. The Agua Fresca I had here was $2.50 but ""La Flor de Michoacan Artisinal"" makes MUCH BETTER Agua Fresca and gives you a HUGE cup for the same price or less. When I got to the register, the manager asked me if I want the ""house dressing"" which looked like guacamole. I said no and then he said something weird like ""Well, since he didn't get the house dressing, don't charge him for the sour cream"" (implying that normally I would have to pay EXTRA for the sour cream), which was NOT explained to me as I ordered it.

The Ugly: There seems to be a racial divide in this place. It seems to be run by Mormons. There are NO BLACK PEOPLE on the staff and there's 20-30 people working there (Note: Mormons don't like Black people). There are some Mexicans working there but they get the crappy kitchen jobs while the Mormons get the cushy easy jobs.

1361652,2012-01-05,3,_Kd0kQ8RF70hJ1ykLqCRyQ,"Ah, the oxymoron known as the ""pork salad"". I travel all over Vegas looking for the best. I enjoy Chipotle and Zaba's enough, but I get superior quality and unbelievable portions at Rio. When I have friends stay from out of town, you can bet I take them here. They simultaneously love me for taking them and hate me for the knowledge that they don't have a Cafe Rio in their hometown. Hehe.

Start with the base--the tortilla. They are homemade, warmed up for you as soon as you order, and stay soft all the way through your meal. I order my Barbacoa pork salad (all hail the sweetest and most moist pork around). My man gets a dual-protein burrito which is the size of a newborn and takes him two sittings to finish. The Mahi Mahi tacos are excellent too, as a side note. 

What I love so much about the service is that these guys don't run you down the line like cattle, which I've felt a part of at Chipotle during the lunch rush. Too many times at Chipotle I watch my bowl fly down the line away from me as I yell out ""I'm sorry...would I like what?!?! Oh, salsa! Mild please..."" 

When they ask you which dressing you would like, just say ""house"". I think it's avocado ranch and I could drink it from the cup. A perk of Rio is that horchata is served here. My salad is so massive and rich, though, I can't even finish IT, let alone chase it with sweet rice milk. 

Bottom line: if you're going to pay $7-$9 for one of these meals (and you will pay that no matter where you go) make it worth your while and just come to Cafe Rio. Pull up a chair, because I'll be there stuffing my face.",ci6lQlK1ws2A_RFPkHCFqA,3,3,5,WAMM4C1uwT7xI3xyuXPqgQ

I had the sweet pork barbacoa burrito ""enchilada style"".   I am still daydreaming about it days later.  I wouldn't shed a tear if all the Chipotles and Qdobas here where I live, in Colorado Springs, closed down and were replaced by Cafe Rio.

That burrito was unbelieveable.  Perfectly savory, seasoned, spicy, sweet, and moist pork.  The rice and beans, and the green chili sauce on top weren't a distraction from the barbacoa but were just right.

It was less than 30 mins before I called and spoke to Ramiro the cashier, who also was the one who bagged our food (per hubby) and told him they forgot the Guac/chips. He stated they will credit it back to our credit card.
Ok, so I wait, and of course I forgot and today I remembered. Of course it's a lousy $5.40 but it's the principle of it that pissed me off because it's now 2 weeks later and I still haven't gotten any credit in my bank. If you want to keep customers coming then honesty and good service is all you need. So I call and I got Ramiro right away, informed him we never recv'd our credit and he quickly says ""hold on"", after a minute he comes back on the phone and says my manager said you need to come in for the credit. So I said No, I need to speak w/your manager. Mike, the manager, gets on the phone and I'm telling him about the situation and he keeps talking over me & then says that $5.40 is not a big deal!! Might not be for him but it might be for others. Doesn't matter how much the amount you don't tell people it's not a big deal! No apology or anything just made it seem like I was making a big DEAL out of it. Anyways he ended up saying they can't credit our card after 24hrs and kept repeating he doesn't know anything about the situation! well youre the damn manager doesn't matter, you find a way to fix the situation. Throughout the whole convo he's being sarcastic and condescending with his statements. Then he says what do I want to do, I told him you tell me, it's not my fault you didn't credit me back. He gave me a choice to pick up reimbursement or we had to get reimbursed thru the corporate office. Told him we will come in to pick it up in the store.

Never having been to Cafe Rio, we didn't know that dinner hour would be quite the zoo it was. Since the place was busy, we decided to get our food to go. 

This is what I wish I would have known: (one) it's advisable to read the menu and make your choice while still at home. There is no big-print menu up high so that you can read it from way back in the line. There are two small menus available to peruse as you make your way through the line. The first is in an awkward spot and the second is half a step from the spot where the employees start asking you what you want. I say ""start asking"" because (two) it seems you'll be asked 3-4 times what you want/ordered. You have to remember. (Three) you don't really get the ""choose your own ingredients"" option here like you would at say, Chipotle. The item you order comes with certain stuff on it and the staff will ask you if you want that stuff. But that's it. Much more sit-down restaurant in that regard. (Four) Unless you're tall, you won't be able to see your food being made on the other side of the counter. 

(Five) There are some patrons of this location that think it's totally fine to have 7 kids under 6 and an infant through the line accompanied by a single adult (who is trying to order for his giant party, as 3 other adults sit, kidless, at a table). If that was you or someone you know, for the love of god, sit the kids at a freaking table while you order so they aren't running around, blocking the menu and stepping on other people's toes.

Anyway, we both got tacos; mine were mahi mahi and Boyfriend's were steak. Both came with rice & beans.

Today I ordered a steak taco and a shredded chicken taco.  Menu says $8.49, upcharge for steak of $1.50 or $.75 for a single item. That makes my meal $9.24 (1 regular taco and 1 premium).  I was charged $9.99.  I asked the cashier and she said it's just how it rings up. I said again that this isn't what the menu says.  She came out and read the menu and then actually said ""what do you want me to do?  Refund it?  This is just ridiculous!""  Really?!?  So told her that was ok - refund the whole thing because I'm leaving. I asked for the managers name (Carol?) and was told she was right over at a table talking to 4 other employees. While I'm walking over to talk to the manager, this cashier starts talking about me to other employees.

I introduced myself to the manager and shared my story. Her eyes got big and she asked me to identify the cashier. It was easy to identify her - she was still talking to peers and waving my receipt around in the air. The manager apologized and told the staff she needed to go talk to (I believe she said Amanda?).  Then I left. 


And for those of you who want to give my grief about $.75 I get it. It's not going to break me, but it needs to be right. For $10 I can have lunch at a full service restaurant on a real plate with real service. This is fast food.  I'll pay a little for convenience - but no upcharge for the attitude please. 

Tom's bottom line:  stay the hell away from this store. There are other Cafe Rio stores in the area where you can get the same good food without the nastiness.

First some background. Let's talk about Cafe Rio's tres leches cake. Cause it's not just good-it's wonderful. It's this moist, flavorful HUGE piece of white cake that's made even more moist and more flavorful by the 3 types of milk that it's so deliciously soaked in. But the best part (not to mention the part that makes it so amazing) is that they top it with fresh whipped cream and strawberry slices. It's heaven in a clear clam shell package. For reals.

Ok so last night. Ugh. I went here specifically for the tres leches. The boyfriend and I had done some shopping and we were both in the mood for something sweet. Cafe Rio tres leches. Boom. So we go and order it to go, pay for it, say thanks, take our bag and drive home. About halfway home, I decide to look in the bag (probably just to remind myself of the yumminess that awaited us) and I'm shocked and disappointed and pissed that there's absolutely NO whipped cream or strawberries on either of the cakes. 

'Ok', I think, 'they must have just forgotten it cause we got it to go. I bet they put it in cups and we have to put it on ourselves and they just plain forgot.  Cause they were busy. And this is Cafe Rio. And we've always gotten awesome service here.' (See how I'm so quick to give the benefit of the doubt. Boo. Wrong this time.) 

So we decide to just drive back (cause surely they just forgot it, right? And they'll give it to us in containers and we'll be on our way back home and all will be right in our tres leches world). But nooooooooo! When we go in and tell them they've forgotten it, the girl behind the counter says, ""Oh no, I'm sorry, we're out of whipped cream and strawberries.""

Wait...what?!?! You're out of whipped cream and strawberries? Did I just hear that correctly?! And you didn't think to tell us that when we ordered it? You just ASSUMED that we'd be ok with not getting 2/3 of the freaking ingredients? Oh hells no. Hells to the no!

Not happy, not happy at all. My boyfriend (being the genius that he is) suggested that we drive to the Cafe Rio on Stephanie and ask them for some whipped cream and strawberries. (We're obviously pretty serious about this cake, people!) 

So we do. We go to Cafe Rio on Stephanie and Warm Springs and surprise! They are more than happy to give us whipped cream, strawberries and a big huge ""We're so sorry"" on behalf of Cafe Rio Eastern.

They're thick and delicious, and even on their own ($.95), they're really really good.  Secondly, the meat is very flavorful.  My personal favorite is the pork barbacoa, which is lightly sweet.  

I could go on and on about the salads, the chile relleno, tacos, but really, my favorite order is a burrito with pork barbacoa and pinto beans ($6.95), mild sauce and cilantro, enchilada style ($.95, meaning it's got sauce on top, topped with cheese, and lightly baked), with extra pico-de-gallo.  Good enough for two people, under $10.  

Another interesting thing is that they have a wide selection of drinks and hot sauces.  It's the only place I know of that has Vanilla Coke *and* Cherry Coke.  They have three different kinds of tea, of which my favorite is the herbal hibiscus, and their mango drink is quite good, too.  They have tabasco, jalapeno tabasco, Tapatio, Cholula, and at least three more different kinds of hot sauces in bottles that I hadn't even heard of.  

I have not had any of the desserts, but I have no doubt they're just good and high in quality as the rest of the menu.  Pretty great place to get a cheap meal!  I'm never going to Chipotle, Zaba's, or Qdoba again, Cafe Rio is just that much better.",UIdX_cI1awxvPH7kIFKpXw,2,0,4,DmJ-CkC_ajH6wM4XfOvzfA

By the way this was a vegan salad with NO MEAT OR SUBSTITUTE. How cheap. I hope the manager gets chewed out. Unbelievable. And I didn't even get to how crappy the meals were thrown together.",taTPWpqUQ3hWeTBq74G1cQ,0,0,1,Bg2L7GWkkCjrxzL1yiAaEw
3657489,2013-06-09,0,_Kd0kQ8RF70hJ1ykLqCRyQ,"So, my review is really for this location and the service, as opposed to the food.  I have been to a few Cafe Rios around town and this one always seems to have rude service.  Finally got sick of it the other day, so I'm writing this review!  God bless Yelp.

First thing's first: I love Cafe Rio food.  Their salads are like little (or huge, actually) bowls of heaven.  I could eat them all the time.

BUT, the service here almost makes me want to stop coming.  They are always SO busy and hectic, and the staff tries to be as fast as possible (a good thing) but at the expense of quality service (a bad thing).  They end up rushing you through the line and they get pissed when you ask a question or take one second to decide.  If you are trying something new, forget about it.  They're going to be mad.  The last time we went was a couple days ago, and when we left, we were like ""man, they seemed even ruder than normal!""  It's not cool.  I totally understand the need for speed, but it's not okay to be a jerk to a customer.  CALM DOWN, Cafe Rio staff.  Seriously.",BgF9Iy2wKPLYAcU-1Kfq_w,1,0,3,HSyAOQb2DCGfY_XwNbK1qw

The rest of the restaurant though gets over looked when it's busy.

Either way, if it is an American corporation that dresses like a mexican spot, call me one to turn the other cheek! I'm just in love with the food and flavor.

Coconut shrimp taco tuesdays. Thats what its all about. They are VERY generous about the shrimp too I may add. I also love the pork barbacoa tacos. The burritos are just too big for my hand to hold, so I opt for the tacos. I love the barbacoa flavor because its sweet, juicy, and meaty as well. The pork is tender and perfectly shredded. Its just so full of flavor, and has that nice marinated bbq taste to it. If you like more soft, and less over powering flavors, I'd try the coconut shrimp, salmon, and mahi mahi. Those are primo. It's not filling, the flavors are very soft and subtle, and the fish is tender as well.

But what makes everything perfect and my personal favorite is the torilla. It's freshly made, and because it trastes so wonderful I always ask to DOUBLE the tortilla. It's a thick tortilla and very soft. It has this light, sweet, doughy taste and texture to it. It's not flat and woodfired or stovetop grilled like most tortillas. Expect to see the cooks in the back making the dough and cooking the tortillas fresh for you. My favorite.

Also, they have a stamp card. But 9 meals, and get the tenth free. WHO DOESN'T LOVE STAMP CARDS?!?!!?!",a48HhwcmjFLApZhiax41IA,1,0,4,35umXRc_bXFXILe3trgeiw

This is my 3rd time eating here. My problem is not with cafe rio or their food but the girl who served us. 

I'm very big on customer service and it was bad and made me mad enough to leave this. 

I asked for a quesadilla meal. She moves on the the next person , my wife and says. ""What else. Doesn't ask me what kind of meat or ""did you want anything else but cheese on there""  or anything. So not knowing how things work exactly I figured she'd ask me what kind of meat I wanted in a second.....Nope sure didn't. So I didn't get a chicken quesadilla like I wanted. 

Not only that. There was a new trainee there. Who was standing there not knowing what to do and this girl is just throwing stuff around and not taking the time to show this girl anything! She asked her a questions "" hey how long are you supposed to put that in the warmer"" basically begging to be trained. And she blows off the question and goes and does something else.

That was then, this is now. I now dine at a Cafe Rio at least once a month because it's convenient, the food is pretty good, and I can make their meals as healthy or unhealthy as I want. I rarely go to this location because there's just so many other options off Eastern Ave.  If I do come here, it's usually with a co-worker. My co-worker is on a health kick recently. I think he's one of those New Year Resolutioners. He wanted something ""clean"". Clean to him is switching from a Barbacoa Enchilada Burrito to a Chicken Enchilada Burrito with all the fun stuff. He obviously loves Cafe Rio because he always picks this place. I don't share his enthusiasm towards Cafe Rio, but I am a fan. I always get the same thing at a Cafe Rio and that's 2-3 servings of their Fire Grilled Chicken with Cheese. I don't put any of the sauces and usually skip the tortilla. The meal is a lot better than plain chicken breast that's for sure. The portions are huge only because I request extra meat. Overall, I have no issues with the food and will continue to dine here.

TIP #1: This restaurant always seems to be busy regardless of the time. 

TIP #2:  Wheat tortilla on request only

TIP #3:  The entire staff will yell ""Extra Meat"" if decide to pile it on. Look up the Cafe Rio Extra Meat Legend on YouTube. Hilarious! I want extra meat!! Extra Meat!!!

On our last visit, I decided to just get a chicken tostada because my usual chicken salad would have been too much food. Plus I wanted the crunchy tostada shell. So here's where it gets bad. I order the shredded chicken on the side because I didn't want the juices making my tostada shell soggy. As the girl proceeded to put the chicken in a separate cup, she made a comment about how she hates when people get the meat on the side. The guy next to her then made a comment about how he agreed. Um, I'M STANDING RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU IDIOTS,  I CAN HEAR YOU!!! Then as the guy puts the lettuce on my food, he doesn't let the water drip from the lettuce. So all this water ends up making my tortilla shell soggy. Just what I didn't want. Then to top it off, as I'm eating my food, the chicken is way overcooked and super mushy. And there's a puddle of water at the bottom of my plate. See picture. 

I've noticed over my last few visits to this location that the employees don't seem to give a crap about the food they serve. They're just there for a paycheck. No care or quality.

Then I asked for an 8 ounce Fresca and a bag of chips. They had Fresca but didn't have any chips? When I got to the counter to check out the girl working the register yelled back and asked, ""are we out of chips?"" The person that served me yelled ""yes"" and the person in the back yelled ""no.""

Turns out they had chips. Still no queso. The person serving me had asked the girl at the register to not charge me for the Fresca and chips since they were out of queso. I guess it was supposed to be a nice gesture to make things right.

I didn't pay attention to the final cost just handed over my debit card. I guess what threw me off was the girl sniffing my food and telling me my food smelled like McDonalds.

The atmosphere is very family friendly. If your looking for a quite place to have a romantic date I would not choose here. They do have seating outside at this location which would be nice on a not so hot night.  We went during dinner and decided to take it home.

Cafe Rio has a large selection of Mexican food items. They also have a large selection of proteins to choose from, including salmon and a veggie option. We both had a very hard time deciding what to choose! I was torn between the burrito, nachos and salad. In the end I got a chicken salad with the house dressing and my husband got the sweet pork barbacoa. We decided to get the queso dip with salsa and chips as well. It's an assembly style restaurant much like Chipotle.

I really enjoyed my shredded chicken salad.  They fill a large house made tortilla with rice, beans, chicken, lettuce, pico, cheese, guacamole, and their house made salad dressing. All the ingredients were very fresh and they gave a very large portion. I ate the rest for lunch the next day. My husband after much debate ordered the sweet pork barbacoa burrito. The pork was to sweet for his liking. He told me that he wished you could combine the beef barbacoa from Chipotle into the burrito from Cafe Rio. The queso dip was spicier then I expected, but the salsa was surprisingly tasty. The spice of the queso was not to much just not what I was thinking it would be. They gave a good portion of dip and chips that it was worth the $5.

Now - this location I've been to 4 times since it's right by my house. Normally I go to the one by UNLV. 

At this location, every single time they have messed up an order or I've gotten the wrong food. Like another reviewer said, I've also been overcharged , although mine was for add-ons that I didn't order and didn't receive. One of the workers, who has been there everyime I have, basically ignores you when you order, and just puts everything on your order even if you ask for it without. 

The service is also incredibly slow at this location. If the one by UNLV can handle the college lunch rush plus take out and catering, there is absolutely no reason why this location can't. If you're in line in-store, your food will sit and get cold while they blatantly ignore you and instead fill an online or catering order. But if you order online, they don't even start the order until you get there to pick it up- and even then, it sits by the cashier who is clueless as to who the order belongs to.

The clerk didn't even know how to count change properly.

There were 4 people in line so I figured I'd speed right through. It the guy starting the order didn't listen at all. I had to say what I wanted multiple times, he put obscene amounts of sauce on, and made it smothered when I didn't mention it. After he had smothered it and obligating me to the dollar extra I had mentioned that I didn't want it smothered. He looked at me stupefied and then offered to wipe the sauce off. To make things easier I just bit the bullet and continued along my way. After getting the burrito made it was another 5 minute wait while the 2 people ahead of me were being ignored by the 5 staff members standing around doing nothing. 

Finally I arrive at the register to find my food lidded and bagged when I was getting it to stay. Another stupefied employee doing nothing to resolve the situation and seemingly put off when I asked for a tray.

Once I finally started eating, roughly 10 minutes after the burrito was made, I was overwhelmed by the copious amounts of hot sauce that the burrito was swimming in, and the only other discernable taste or texture was the undercooked rice that crunched with each bite.

Needless to say, I won't be going back to cafe rio anymore.",ZskQtWdJD9bKIhcu2pgpIg,0,0,1,lbU6-0PYMkfC7GPPP_FEuA

Cafe Rio is the pinnacle of Mexican American food for me. I frequent this place at least once a week. You can't go wrong with the quesadillas, salads, or tostadas. Salads...what?! The salads are served on a delicious handmade tortilla and filled with rice, beans, a meat of your choice, pico de gallo, lettuce, and guacamole. My absolute favorite thing on the menu is the pork barbacoa. It is the perfect balance of savory and sweet. I could eat it by the pound, but usually I just get it on my tostada. The house dressing and the vinaigrette are both delicious choices for a salad or tostada. This place is fast and runs like a well oiled machine.

The ""lead associate"" was barking orders at her, to take her gloves off, get the chips, don't do this or that, obviously made the newbie uncomfortable and even more nervous. My bestie and I looked at each other and this poor girl, and felt terrible. I decided I couldn't let it go when I got home, and called to speak to the store manager;who was on her lunch. I explain d the story, and she was very apologetic and assured us that she would have the appropriate talks with staff. She didn't seem like she was giving us a generic answer just to get off the phone.

Of course, once you fill a tin with a warm, chewy tortilla, rice, beans, marinated chicken and some famous lime cilantro dressing--how could you not love the lettuce you pile on top so generously? The chicken breast salad at Café Rio has more flavor than most 4 course meals. It's refreshing, filling and will make your taste buds shake their maracas. I've also had a chicken quesadilla, also delicious, and bites of Mike's enchiladas and burritos. We also love their queso and chips and love to get an extra freshly made tortilla to dip in the queso. Their tortillas are divine. Thick and chewy, always warm and perfectly cooked. 
If there was a drawback to this place, it wouldn't be the food, but the crazy people that scream at you for your order. I always feel a bit rushed getting through the line and making sure you got what you want. They're quick to move onto the next person (because there's always a line--sign of a good place!) and if you're not careful, you'll be left in the dust. 
Overall, their food makes up for any of the customer service issues. We've been to a couple of locations and always have a good meal. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for some casual Mexican dining.",eCjQpniDmsnw3Hc9qP0ASw,1,2,4,p5nk7WRK3cJnqeWvXVvi0A

I used to crave Cafe Rio when I was at school and it was always my first or last stop coming home or leaving. That's not the case here any more. 

Since I left for school they expanded and bought the space next door to expand their seating area. Either I come in at the wrong times or this place is always almost empty. It always used to be packed! What happened?

Here's a hint: it's the staff. I used to feel welcomed here but now the employees act like it's a chore for them to do their jobs. Going down the line today the first guy almost got my mom's order wrong, the middle lady was extremely slow, and the cashier was straight up rude. When I asked her for an order of chips and queso she said ""You have to ask her (referring to the slow lady) for the chips and queso."" Excuse me? Last time I checked you're the one who asks if I would like any drinks or chips. As I turned to the lady to ask the cashier turned around and began talking to her friend who was wiping down trays. Seriously? And she kept talking to her friend while we were at the counter waiting for our food! That is a big no no in a customer service job. She was even still talking to her friend when she gave my mom her receipt! Really girl? Your conversation was that important that you completely ignored us for most of the transaction and was still rude? You've got a lot of nerve.

The number one thing about this place, freshness. Most notably, the soft and fresh tortillas made minutes before you eat. They also have fresh homemade horchata and other tasty and unique drink options with free refills. In addition to being delicious, this place is vegetarian (even vegan) friendly. 

As some have mentioned, eating here DOES get expensive. A simple burrito will seem to be around $6 at first but after enchilada style, side guacamole and sour cream, and a medium drink, you will find yourself more than doubling your original estimate. That side of guac by the way, is very modest. They do have daily specials though which include a drink in the price. And they also offer a stamp card towards a free meal. However, once you reach ten stamps you have most likely spent around $100 here.
