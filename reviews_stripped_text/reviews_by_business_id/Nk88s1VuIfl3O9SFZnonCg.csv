13439,2016-06-03,0,Nk88s1VuIfl3O9SFZnonCg,"Went to Neche again last week. Another great dinner. We has the bacon wrapped dates with an almond in the middle...so delicious,  as were the fried green tomatos. Lots of fresh fish dishes and great beef. I had beef tenderloin last time which was excellent and fish this time. The halibut was so moist. You could tell it's really fresh.
The salted Carmel cheese cake ball in kaluha was delicious.
I love the back patio with trees of lights and the sophisticated yet fun atmosphere. 
It would be a great place to have an event...a wedding reception etc...",3ar_bezvxu-lt7QNvr4_JA,0,0,5,LWGmJe6VjIWih0vYRc070A

We had very good service. We eventually went a cross the way to a similar venue and received horrible service and the vibe was less sophisticated.

1323652,2016-08-10,3,Nk88s1VuIfl3O9SFZnonCg,"Anxiously awaiting something new in Town Square, finally three new restaurants open w/in weeks of each other.  
Neche looked really cool inside, artsy, nice lighting & fixtures, stages, long bar, part is opened to the outdoor patio.  The owner, also the architect spoke to us at the bar once in the beginning, but I wish he would've came back after our meal & drinks to see how we liked it.

Understandably with a new restaurant, new employees, etc, I can give certain things a break.  But four people including my friend & I were at the bar, two bartenders, the owner & over 20 minutes to get our drink.  

The drink menu looked fun & mixologist like so I ordered 'Below the Boarder' similar to a kicked up margarita, with an andouille sausage skewer... No wait where's the andouille skewer?  The sweet & SOUR mix needed it!  The bartender says we don't have many of the garnishes... Maybe inform us of that or change the menu are my thoughts.  He made it seem like it was my fault, I said well I specifically ordered this cause of the presentation w/ an andouille skewer.  My friends Japanese Mule was good though.  Not easy to mess up a mule or wine.  

Lastly, the entree.  Have you ever had Beef Tartare cooked well done w/ a quail egg & no yolk spilling out once your fork cuts though it?  Also it was my friends first time having 'beef tartare' I give it an F.  (Video on my ig yopocoface)

Rarely do I give low stars, but when I leave starving & unsatisfied, saying to myself, except for the wine & mule what did I just pay for?  We were there for about two hours & only ordered two entrees.  It was at 3pm when they open & a slow time.  Strange hours also 3pm until 4am.",D43OWyfzIQjL8feJpYh2SQ,5,1,1,ohEV9pMw7wss0vus_lvCaA

1596456,2017-02-07,1,Nk88s1VuIfl3O9SFZnonCg,"I wouldn't waste my time coming back to this place. Arrived at 5pm on a week night & they literately just unlocked the doors. Manager was wearing sweatpants & a sweatshirt & baseball cap. This place is made to look like a nice upscale venue. If that's what you're going for why in the world would the manager be in clothing that makes them appear they just rolled out of bed? 

Used the restrooms upon arrival & ICK & GROSS! 2 of 3 stalls have out of order signs. The only working one is the handicap stall which has the baby changing station in it. There was no hanger in the stall anywhere to hang a coat up while you used the restroom. One of the faucets to wash your hands was broken off the countertop & laying there with pipes still hooked to it.

There was no chef so we could not get food which honestly was probably a blessing. They had no happy hour food but said it was 25% off of the the shareable items list. Looking at their appetizer list I was shocked at the prices. $8 for sweet potato fries? It was all way more expensive than what appetizer prices should be in all honesty. I'd rather go to other venues like Yard House, Double Helix or Tommy Bahama where I know their prices aren't that expensive. There was also no waitress the entire time we were there (2 hrs). They had $2 draft beers.The chef finally arrived about 6:15pm. I just don't understand that as I've worked in the restaurant industry as a bartender & also a waitress & we always had to be at the venue at least 30 minutes before it opened. When asking the bartender what the specials were when we 1st arrived he was very vague & acted like we've been there before so we should know what they were. Upon ordering a 2nd beer one of my colleagues had to ask the bartender for a new cold beer glass as the bartender was going to just pour another beer in the same used warm glass. Service was extremely slow as if he didn't how long we waited. Just bad service period. 

We had the venue to our selves as there was no one else that came in & stayed during the 2 hours we were there. Several groups came in & stood at the hostess stand but since there was no one there they left. Sadly I hate to say it but I feel this venue will suffer the fate of all of the business before it in this location. Would like to see them make it but they are far too expensive to compete with the other venues in Town Square.",uByIGcI5EJeKNGyBtCkWBw,2,1,1,nyyJUuLAnYDQFjTHLzv2qg

2108743,2016-12-25,0,Nk88s1VuIfl3O9SFZnonCg,"I didn't realize this place was at Town Square probably up until about a week ago. It's located on the second floor very close to the AMC theater, Blue Martini, and McFaddens.

So I walk in and I'm immediately impressed by the decor. If you've ever been to Sparklings, this place is a step-up in regards to its chic and classy interior. It also has a very bourgeois feeling to it, which complements its name and purpose as a restaurant/entertainment lounge. 

Mind you, I was here for a special occasion. My friend had planned out a surprise proposal for his girlfriend. I arrive at 5:30pm and was greeted by the owner and a worker at the bar named Yoshi. I was immediately asked if I wanted anything to drink. I opted for water because I didn't want to start drinking before the festivities, lol. The owner and bartender were extremely accommodating to the behind the scenes planning of the proposal: finding mics that worked correctly, allowing the soon-to-be bridal party a special section of seats and tables to sit at, testing out the sound system, practically just making sure everything was perfect for the proposal.

Let's fast forward to the food! This place serves southern, thank the laaaawd. Jambalaya, catfish, dirty rice and beans, crab beignets, you name it. I ordered bacon wrapped shrimp and was highly pleased. The sauce that came with it was plain old BBQ sauce, but it still tasted great, nonetheless. My friend Desiree had ordered the blackened catfish and BOY, WAS IT SPICY. My mouth was on fire but the flavor was very good. 

DJ Cali Cat from Hot 97.5 comes here and DJs and she was taking requests from my drunken friends and I. She's awesome. And then a live band came on around 9pm and the lead singer of the group was kiiiiiillin her performance with soulful R&B. It was a great night.

Food here is a little overpriced and I feel that quality could be better, but overall I would come back here for maybe a large gathering due to the professionalism of the ownership of N?che.",IIQjl4ckL2lWPrqV2ZGAtA,2,1,3,CDn45fB4AYCN9tANdgGBNg

We were there twice over the last 3 weeks and never, ever again. We ordered 4 Jack and cokes and 4 Titos (which they didn't have) and the bill was $112.00. It's not like we were ordering fancy martinis.

The staff also seemed more interested in talking to each other than us. One dude was cool when we got him but for those prices; we should at least get some attention. Good wings but that aint enough. C'mon people, you want locals to come in here? Knock a few bucks off of the prices.

Lets hope they eventually put something good in this spot. First it was Fish House, then Lolita's, now this place... We will try the next spot because we are gluttons for punishment.",aZ2DKwGjjTfrGn4AOSI34w,0,0,1,lpfI80ON0lGc75GVmcxwaA

I've only been once and I didn't have that good of a time.  It was a saturday night and Town Square was absolutely packed, like the busiest I've ever seen and this place was just about dead which was super odd.  We walk in and go to the bar (7 of us) and even though it wasn't busy, it still took about 20 minutes for us to get out drinks even though there were two bartenders.  The managers or who I assumed to be the managers kept walking around and hanging out with each other but never really checked on people and were mainly concerned with adjusting their vests and hats.  They did seem like nice people though.  The light scheme was odd, the music wasn't the best, and they drink menu was very limited.

My biggest gripe about any business is bad service. If you just get that right with friendly attentive staff, customers can overlook other shortcomings. 
Well at Neche the bartender acted like we didn't exist. There was only about 4 people in the whole place besides my friend and I. The bartender spent the whole time on the other end of the bar talking. When we could finally get his attention to order something they would mess up the order. Then we had to wait another 30 minutes to get his attention again so we could get the order fixed. I'm pretty sure this is the worst bar tender I've ever seen. 
I wonder how it is in the evening when it's busy. Early in the day it's a ghost town... With bad service.",1st2ltGKJ00ZcRsev-Ieew,7,2,1,XNN5SeHbQCGevrZaV_pv_g
2388677,2016-05-12,5,Nk88s1VuIfl3O9SFZnonCg,"I've been stalking this place for months and when I heard they were finally open I made sure to check it out. 

Neche is suppose to be this huge restaurant/ultra lounge with 2 bars, indoor and outdoor patio, and a dj and it's conveniently located upstairs across from some already popular night life spots like Blue Martini, Yardhouse, and McFaddens.

The cocktails are excellent and were made strong, my kind of cocktails. The beer selection wasn't that bad. The cocktails and wines seemed a little pricier compared to Double Helix. Really didn't have a lot of their food besides a few items under their ""share"" menu. Fried green tomotoes, tandoori chicken satay, and hummus sampler. Not so good. 3 items totaling to $38. The price didn't justify the quality or quantity, usually it's should be one or the other lol neither. I wouldn't recommend them, see my pics. I would probably try the other items on the menu not under share. Hopefully its better or more filling. The tandoori chicken satay was only 2 small pieces. The server overheard that we were a little upset about it and was able to add 2 more pieces which was very nice of her cause we were only casually complaining among ourselves and she took the initiative on her own.

Their happy hours run til midnight and it's 25% off alcohol and ""share"" food. Double check your check before paying cause we had a discount but it wasn't even close to the 25%. This is slightly understandable since they're a new business.

They weren't busy but they really do have potential. Excellent drinks and friendly staff. I'd probably be back after business picks up and update my review. Heard they're having a big grand opening event soon.",vWP8-aQX0rYJszqkWVL7Ew,10,5,2,Lfb5rejKopj8BJdrx6OMNQ

So after we finished those drinks, we ordered another round, but this time, it was a male bartender. He made my cosmo in a small glass. First of all, a cosmo is a martini. I should be drinking my cosmo in a martini glass just like my first drink. Maybe I shouldn't have complained about my glass because clearly it wasn't a cosmo, he pretty much made me a cranberry juice and vodka. If I wanted cran and vodka, I would've ordered cran and vodka.

Well it's impossible to use the freaking ticket for a $6 value. I ordered French fries and it took 45 minutes to come out. We ordered 2 sweet potato nachos and only 1 order came out after 1 hour. 

Women restroom was DISGUSTING and had only 2 working stalls out of the 4. 

When I asked for a second of order of fries they said they were so backed up that they would try. 

They definitely lost a lot of potential business tonight.",4qSYW4CGy_KXmHy__Ufpqg,1,0,1,0pUrOjMT8NproS4FEjH5Iw
