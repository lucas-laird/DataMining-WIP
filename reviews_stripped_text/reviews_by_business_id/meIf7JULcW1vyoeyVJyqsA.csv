You wont be dissaponted. Ask for Paulie, he is a really kind and funny bartender.",ipqEcqA1MMWPE9QR4izj-w,0,0,5,lwYoB7vWHHrcxhWhHG9gqg

Could not get them replaced because after I got my meal, neither of the 2 bartenders walked over to ask how my meals was, they were to busy pushing beers on the regulars and talking 'brackets"" to take care of other patrons. When I finally got their attention to have my water re-filled..I got attitude by the 7 foot bartender.  Local, going to Suncoast for years...stay away unless you like ""attitude"" and poor service.",MKu9IN6VYNi89JCKI2qiEw,0,0,1,9lImzjKDdVZ4tsBzpvc-cg

The menu isn't good for Vegans/Vegetarians but the service was great and my buddy liked the wings and chili fries that he ordered. I won't eat there, but it's a great spot for a drink.",5jhjntvVWlbHuXhMQ4-X_g,0,0,4,bgnpk8r9AsMu-nEfDl_-_Q
