So I pretty much paid them 60 bucks to make us sick! I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to anyone.,2aYd0uVjZPL83lMFoOOwWg,0,0,1,xYMm-6mJSV-sXoPIAwtWGw

They have changed their Players Club...it's not so generous anymore. :(  So now their review loses a star.

I still continue to come here, just not as often as I used to.  I am not as happy with their new system, I miss the old one and the wheel spin.  Still good food and great staff.


Original Post: 
In a town with many local bar choices, this is one of my favorite local hangouts.  Even though I I am typically there during the graveyard shift.  I think that have one of the best chicken fried steak and eggs in town.  Their pizza is also very thick, generously proportioned, and delicious.  

Friendly graveyard bartenders (Jason and Charles) and their large menu is available 24/7.  I have been regularly going there for a few years now and have been known to put a few bucks in the machines, so I can also attest that they are very generous with their players club for regular players, just this month I received $400 in vouchers!",yiCegiFYduAc7tvbZ9udKg,2,1,3,5hmtWhvsVoZaTzn5c2b4Tg

This was my second attempt at finding a wing spot in sin city. I did NOT have high hopes based on my Yelp selections. This place is a smokin hot treasure. I was treated to a wing foursome thanks to Erica. I had traditional hot buffalo, grilled BBQ & teriyaki And the amazing sweet Thai finished in the pizza oven. All are deep fried but finished in separate fashion. They are allowed to caramelize & are so crispy & delicious,  I may actually start eating again, while typing this review.   Another great (and quite shameful) fact. I only finished 15 wings. Based on my 'normal' consumption (for testing purposes only) is around 20. These babies are HUGE.  Everyone who came in she knew by name & even remembered previous orders.  Erica & T-Bird Lounge make it to the Hall of Fame. GO THERE NOW FOR WINGS.  Beer selection solid with cold glasses.

The wings are BIG, they dont give you the little ones that barely have any meat. These are chicken wings on steriods lol. I always get the wings plain, extra crispy, with sauce on the side. I like their teriyaki and hot sauce. The hot sauce is very hot though, it has peppers in it. If you dont like hot I would suggest getting mild. 

On my last visit I wanted breakfast, so I ordered the chicken fried steak and eggs. It was filling, but it was definitely not the best CFS I have had. The gravy was not homemade and you could tell it was from a powder. Not good. I was busy chatting with my boyfriend and our server, Chris, who was very attentive, and by the time I went to eat some of the CFS, the gravy was gummy and sticky. It was not appetizing at all. I decided to scrape most of the gravy off and just use hot sauce, but it was quite disappointing. My meal came with cottage fries, which is like fried potatoes that are crusty and delicious, and toast. I would advise against ordering the CFS, but the wings are for sure a winner!",JYcCYNWs8Ul6ewG5kCYW4Q,7,7,3,V-jJXVNWn3TjUFCnXHtHwA

Service has always been great. Friendly faces. Fast service. Good small talk.

As far as the food goes, it's pretty typical of what you would get at any other bar. They do offer a few late night specials, such as my personal favorite, steak and eggs for 6.99. When I'm too lazy to drive all the way to Southpoint, TBirds is my main place to go for some cheap steak and eggs. 

Overall, a good bar. It's never really too crowded, at least when I go. I think I've started going enough recently that they're finally starting to recognize me, which is always a good thing.",LPSNKZWCOweiPHNiJgafng,2,0,4,d1CKX6GkYbwtyG6IcCxIpw

Today we tried this one thinking it would be comparable but it wasn't meant to be. I ordered biscuits n gravy gf ordered one pancake n side of over med eggs. Pancake came out first with mine. First look of mine n my gf said those looked they were microwaved. I thought they looked like they came out of box very flat and NO SAUSAGE in the gravy. They ended up being cold so I sent them back. My gf eggs finally came out they were terribly under cooked so they went back.

I've had wings a lot of bars, restaurants, and wings places and so far the best.  I think their sauce is scratch made because little flakes of pepper and seeds.  It's got the right tang and heat and always cooked to perfection.  Nothing worse than soggy skin and the wings are big and meaty, unlike some shitty chain, that will remain nameless(who I think has the worst wings).  Beer prices are good and it's nice quiet place to unwind and have a drink. Never crowded.

I live literally about 3 minutes away driving from T Bird and needless to say have passed by many times over the past couple of years.

No greeting or smile and the bar was empty except for one other person (it was around midnight). This should've been my sign to run but I decided to stick it out and give them a chance. He took our drink orders and handed us a menu. There's no HH here, which is fine with me. I don't mind paying full price. We ended up ordering wings, which were actually really good but I think my overall experience just made me want to leave. All in all, we spent about 30 minutes here and couldn't wait to go.

I've been to several of their locations, this one has the typical prompt service and decent food.  The BLT salad was really good, with the option to add chicken or steak for no extra charge.  The taco salad is really good too, and the french dip is not bad.  I know several people who love their wings, I personally don't like to eat meat with bones in it so I haven't tried them.  Will definitely be back for a quick and easy meal.  Good with large parties as well.",FX6SQ1GhLf2O_J1JnrfjkQ,0,0,3,G2jLQfMiOlVdCkIMRvz9Pg
5922880,2017-11-14,0,KoqiR3YN3mhbyuUWYIhuIw,I love this little place the one on Eastern is terrible but this one is fantastic Erica the waitress is the best. She's tells us off all the time and we love it and her!  I go there all the time and hang out with my friends in the restaurant because it's not super busy and They don't rush you out. They make you feel like you're their friend and the food is on point much better than any PTs that's for sure! Definitely a must check out!,fuMLnjEjt3_GM5rc0XJY2Q,0,0,5,j-1iOKUxHre9u2qPsVZNwQ
5959505,2015-10-28,9,KoqiR3YN3mhbyuUWYIhuIw,"A great local bar location with cheap food and nice servers. We arrived around 10 and they were empty in the dining area. The server was so friendly and greeted each patron like she new them, most of the rig upsets she most likely did. 

My mom and I ordered some breakfast and prices were beyond reasonable. My omelet was made to order and was good. 

Service with a smile and great prices while watching the games, we'll likely be back soon to partake in more of the bar area as well.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,11,12,3,0JkQ7OhpFK1uuftALQ-s9A
