It is very upsetting to come in the store and discovered you just got ripped off.",hrJ_N4j7aUmA9H3suizGog,0,0,1,rjpi62zyfxHibEXrshFTAw
1422779,2016-02-25,0,F3iG7XyIsojEfFFMGXAVEQ,"My husband and I ordered online a few times. The last 3 times our order was screwed up. First time we got the wrong pizza then the next 2 times we had missing items. I can understand the first time. Second? OK it's fine, but third time, that's a management problem. We called and the manager and she said she would send a coupon for a free pizza. I don't care about the free pizza, it's the fact that they said they would do something and nothing happened. Never going back. We will spend more money on better quality pizza. I recommend Rosati's Pizza.",wLzVmjvCemq5k7LO-M4yvQ,1,0,1,9sqUIaiu0tmtkWv6kG5U4A

I had PJ's about a week ago and got sick. I assumed it was because I ate too much, but I'm thinking it may have been caused by something else.

I went in around 7:00 pm and my pizza was ready. The cashier asked for my name, went around the corner, and without saying anything to me answered the phone, punched in something into the computer, and start folding boxes. She then proceeded to go make a pizza without putting on any gloves or washing her hands. How that is even allowable is beyond me. There were three girls working, and they all looks pretty young and unmanaged. I'm really surprised the Health District hasn't shut them down. Absolutely disgusting! 

As I said, I HIGHLY caution all diners before ordering from this joint. It's not that good anyway!",xD0zXwapBausN9rwNLAXcg,1,0,2,KP4rKYuyPAyAp8ZvM_rZGg
2427381,2017-03-08,0,F3iG7XyIsojEfFFMGXAVEQ,I order my pizza online because of the T-mobile deal. When I walked in the cashier was with another customer and I waited in line behind another lady. When he got done with her and cashed her out she was going to order more food but told the cashier to help the next lady who walked in after me. The cashier wore his hat incorrectly and the way he wore it he could barely see and looked very unprofessional. Had he wore it correctly and looked like he cared to be at work he may have be able to see who walked in and helped the next person. But instead he doesn't really look up and appeared to be disarrayed working at the cashier.  I had to pretty much stand right up front to get noticed without being rude. It took all of me not to get rude and say something to him and the woman who was also knew I was waiting in line behind her. Just because you have rude customers in your store it's your job to ensure you don't make the matter worse by other ignorant behaviors. The service to order online was fast but to get the pizza a whole different story. The store was not packed at all.,127yVH9erNmQYN7LE-fk4g,0,0,1,fOQqAtqk3XjyJyhSYSBlhg

Okay so I ordered online then forgot to order a soda so I called to place the order on the soda I ordered a cherry Pepsi the guy I spoke to kept being rude and giving me attitude. Then he asked for my number like 6 times then he said please speak slowly which I did then he got offended and said really? I was like excuse me ... he's like I'm sorry I have a hearing problem because of age ... I felt bad then of course I became patient I understand old people right. So when I got my order it was incorrect  my Pepsi was a diet Pepsi I'm sure I didn't order a diet .. so n I called and I spoke to and African American woman. You could tell because the way she spoke. I was like so I ordered earlier and explained it to her then she's like mam I can't understand plaid dumb and I had to explain my self 3 other times the. She finally got it and said I was going to receive my soda .. so I waited and 30 min passed my pizza was cold at this time then I called the manager answered the phone and she was like I'm sorry no one put this order for you I was pissed off by this time don't get me wrong she was good but everyone else was bad.then she was like I'm so sorry but she didn't have a driver available to bring my soda so I drove there oh and the African American chick said that she didn't have cherry Pepsi but when. I got there I had got my cherry pepsi. I am very upset since 1. My pizza got cold and 2 we ended up eating cold pizza with water since we didn't have our soda. 3 the attitudes that were given to me 4 the false info

4222432,2017-07-14,0,F3iG7XyIsojEfFFMGXAVEQ,I ordered my pizza at 8:42 pm I got it at 9:49pm it was cold. I called to check on it at 9:37 pm because their app said it she delivered between 9:21 pm to 9:29 pm. The guy claimed that he had just left the store then said no he was missed informed the driver left 10 minutes ago. The guy on the phone said they are about to close so that's why it was taking longer. I'm an understanding person I just wanted my pizza hot but it wasn't. If they were still that busy on a Thursday night then maybe they should keep their drivers longer an hour for pizza that wasn't even good nor hot isn't good business.,lcMm5nL3BKlLqif2RgshWQ,0,0,1,DrvZbR9kk_c9MAq1uEPrMg
4268395,2016-07-21,0,F3iG7XyIsojEfFFMGXAVEQ,Very poor service. I travel for a living and usually like there pizza. They forgot what room in the Motel I was. Lost my name even though they ran my credit card. After a 3 hour wait my pizza finally arrived no discount or receipt for my expenses,MYkg9d5TL_YichNit4ELLw,1,0,1,HTrjd2bFJqSZqgLCU8laFQ
