The pictures on Yelp make the food look much better than it actually tasted.  Went in with my daughter for the first time and ordered several tapas (soft shell crabs, beef short ribs, dynamite shrimp, spicy tuna crackers, sushi dish (yoshi chef, was tasteless). Their 808 Ceviche lacked flavor with barely any shrimp in it. Miso soup was good. All the food was served successively but waited for the last tapas (lamb lollipops) about 15 minutes after we were done eating and were equally disappointed with it. For the money we paid, there are so many better places where you can savor and enjoy the food. A one-time experience for me, that's it.",9XI9WbSHenBDKcQcumPrtQ,1,0,2,Ixev003xp0Oh2em9zOWrxQ

90396,2013-07-05,0,Yiw2jUJzUdFmglHZgj4RaQ,"Tapas are the perfect solution for those who eat small portions and want to avoid taking food home. Curious about Asian-influenced tapas, three of my friends and I decided to try their happy hour to enjoy some 50% off rolls in addition to the small dishes.

Their steamed mushroom trio had a light, flavorful vinegar soy sauce that really complement the fungi and fish. Listed as nasu fries, their fried eggplant was perfectly crisp and not greasy. There are a few dishes which you could do without trying like the salmon carpaccio, which was just onions wrapped in thinly sliced salmon. If you want sushi, you'd be better off elsewhere. The rolls were fine and fresh enough, but weren't outstanding.

Considering that the restaurant was about half full, the service was a tad slow. I had ordered a roll a little while after we placed our full order, and it came out before one of the items we initially ordered. Perhaps they were understaffed for that time period, but it was odd to hear that the kitchen staff was backed up.

413098,2012-09-12,0,Yiw2jUJzUdFmglHZgj4RaQ,"It's good to see new restaurants opening in the Village Square Shopping Center with 808 Tapas and Baci Burger. The menu is quite extensive and it can get a bit confusing when ordering. Our server recommended for us to start with the crab stack and hamachi shooters. The crab stack was refreshing and light and was enough to three of us. The hamachi shooters were just amazing! We initially ordered just three and ended up ordering six more. The hamachi shooters reminded me of the hamachi shooter at Michelin Star Alexander's in San Francisco but at half the cost. Being from Hawaii, we ordered the lomi lomi salmon caprese, we really enjoyed this dish. The Wagyu sliders were very tasty with shiitake mushrooms and a wasabi mayo sauce. They would have been perfect if they were cooked with more pink. The beef tataki was an amazing dish as well as the salmon carpaccio. I also ordered the ceviche and it was different with bay scallops, rock shrimp, mango and cucumbers, but we definitely enjoyed a different take on ceviche. The sashimi platter we ordered was exceptional with fresh quality fish. We finished with the banana and apple fritter for dessert which was as delicious as its mouth watering presentation. The lychee saketini is highly recommended if you love lychee like I do. We definitely look forward to coming again to try out their other dishes on the menu. Food and service is exceptional.

458260,2012-08-14,1,Yiw2jUJzUdFmglHZgj4RaQ,"Tapas opens this week and I was lucky enough to be invited to try some of their menu items before they open to the public. What they had to offer far exceeded my expectations.  It was the most inventive, delectable, mouthwatering, appetizing, tasty, flavorful, palatable, succulent, luscious, yummy, finger-licking, nummy, lip-smacking, melt-in-your-mouth delicious, food that I have ever experienced.  I know that sounds like an exaggeration, but that's how much I enjoyed it.

The creative philosophy behind 8o8 Tapas is their East meets West menu.  I like to think of it as Asian, Mexican, Italian, Hawaiian fusion.  Each item I tried was out of this world good. The blending of flavors, each with its own unique twist kept me thinking and talking about how good it was long after I left the restaurant.

Here's some of the things I sampled;

The Crab Stack, Snow Crab, avocado, tomato, cucumber, red onion, cilantro, mango, pea sprouts, ginger lime dressing and red caviar. I am here to tell you that this will be a favorite item for salad lovers everywhere.  It is so light, and refreshing and still bursting with flavor. I've been dreaming about it ever since I tasted it. I can't wait to go back and order it again. It is served as a beautifully stacked brightly colored tower topped with a generous portion of snow crab. The photo below shows how it looks once you mix it up to prepare it for eating.


Next was the 808 Tensai Shooters, salmon or hamachi, truffle ponzu, pea sprout, avocado, jalapeño, red caviar and ginger juice. So small, yet packed with flavor.  Is it impolite to slurp the shot glass clean? I didn't care.

Then there was the creative Lomi Salmon Buffalo Caprese, this was their take on a standard Caprese Salad, but instead of tomatoes, onions and garlic they used Lomi Salmon (a Hawaiian staple made of salted salmon, tomato, white onion and scallions), then topped with Extra Virgin Olive Oil and Aged Balsamic Vinegar reduction. Outstanding!

We were told we must try the Poke Nachos, deep fried Lotus root (their take on the tortilla chip) topped with tuna marinated in a special sauce with avocado. The perfect mix off crunchy and creamy altogether in one ultimate bite.

We decided to try their sushi rolls to see if they compared to our favorite sushi restaurants.  The Victorino Roll was amazing. It contains spicy tuna and cucumber topped with tuna and garlic ponzu. Don't you dare dip this delicious creation in soy sauce.  It's perfection just the way it is served.

Next on the list was the 808 Nasu Fries, deep fried panko eggplant accompanied by a tasty wasabi lime mayo for dipping.  My kids would eat this and not even realize they were eating eggplant.  Crispy outside, creamy inside and the perfect dipping pool of sweet, succulent mayo make these fries irresistible.


And no meal would be complete without sliders. 808 Sliders, Wagyu burger, sauteed Shitake mushrooms on a slider bun topped with Ginger Wasabi Mayo. Where can I get a vat of that stuff? It makes everything taste fantastic.

Besides the food, 808 Tapas decor is modern and clean, decorated in red, grey and black. They offer sushi bar seating as well as social seating at a long communal table that runs the length of the front section of the restaurant. Individual tables are available as well. Upon entering everyone is greeted with a unified Aloha and Mahalo on your way out. The staff is friendly, knowledgable and professional.  They plan to offer cocktails including Saketinis and Sake Sangria among other creative concoctions. This will be a hot spot in Summerlin.  Be sure to be the first to try it before everyone else finds out and you have to wait for a table.",x1zModrGr5mJUnjEKlG8yQ,5,1,5,B2duTuvsyqbE6NpKb_9SZw

The curry was terrible though with very soggy rice, the green tea ice cream was fried and was ok, but not something I'd recommend. The Ribs were alright, we also got the Red Sakeria which was interesting but nothing I'm crazy about. For me it was a bit pricy though because you order about 2+ tapa dishes per person and each is around $8.  I dunno the people serving us were nice so I think thats what saved them from a 2 star.

706333,2013-07-03,0,Yiw2jUJzUdFmglHZgj4RaQ,"If it was just about the food, I'd give 808 three stars. But dining out is much more than just food, it's also service and ambiance. To be fair, I've eaten here three times. I didn't review it before because I had pretty much stuck to the happy hour menu (which is quite extensive). Until I'd tried the regular menu, I resisted the urge to Yelp despite my sub par experiences.

The menu looks great. It has a good variety of sushi and seafood dishes as well as things to please regular carnivores. But in reality, the food is just OK, and for the price I expected a lot better.

Food issues: 
I've tried a few of the chicken tapas and have found them all quite bland. Many of the seafood dishes and sushi come with either citrus sauces or their house ponzu, both of which are far too acidic and burned my mouth. I had the salmon trio which came with a miso sauce that was sickly sweet. This place is also very heavy on the raw onion in many dishes, which I'm not a fan of. I didn't enjoy any of it. The highlight was the nigiri, that's hard to mess up.

Service:
Each and every time I've visited, the place has been almost empty. Yet, there are numerous staff on shift that seem incapable of providing any service at all. The servers have no clue about the menu and I ended getting something that I had a food sensitivity to, despite letting the server know I was trying to avoid it. The server was completely inattentive and spent most of her time gossiping with her coworkers. I had to order at the sushi bar because she never came around to check on me after my initial order, or take any of the plates I'd finished with. I also never got my check, I had to go and pay at the front. Bad service is a deal killer for me, especially when the food is nothing special. 

Lastly, 4 bucks for green tea? Extortion. Most places give that for free. I won't be back and I can't see this place lasting long, especially since there's better places just up the road. If you've bought a Groupon, best use it soon.",wTVl4owjHa278i-fxmYcCw,2,0,2,pdp17KLWHmWuUVXlhV98Ig
712556,2012-09-10,1,Yiw2jUJzUdFmglHZgj4RaQ,"Las Vegas has room for a great many things including more and better Izakaya.  

Think Raku, Kyara, Blue Ribbon, Social House as setting the bar for better than average.  What disappointed me about this place was the food could have been a lot better.  The direction and thought are somewhat there but plate ware and good service is not enough.  Summerlin needs some GOOD Japanese restaurants whether traditional or fusion it doesn't matter, just some good food.

This starts with sourcing and using good quality ingredients.  Don't dumb your menu down for the masses, put more effort into what you do and use this as a starting base.  Don't be like Firefly's, yes they are busy but the food sucks.  Aim to be better.  What is lacking here is an intelligent approach to cooking and creativity.  Reinventing or attempting contemporary Japanese dishes is not going to impress anyone.

Salmon appetizer - Horrible...mushy with no textural component and tasted it like it was marinated in Mirin.

Hamachi Belly Shooters - Scrap this idea all together it's been done over and over again for 2 decades and it is not interesting.  Flavors were so so.

Korean Chicken - This was good, liked the use of thighs and crispy chicken skin.

Raw Tuna Dishes - Use fresh tuna not frozen.  Poke Express gets away with this, but the flavors are spot on.  A Japanese Tapas place should be using fresh product.  Yeah it is expensive but that it what you do.

Wagyu Sliders - Not bad, but nothing creative or significant.  

Pork Belly - Not bad as well, but even the pork belly at Inaba was better.

Lomi Salmon Caprese - Scrap this it doesn't do anything for the palate.

Tako dishes - Gotta use better quality tako.  The flavor of the dishes is a definite start but needs further development. 

I get what they are trying to do here and I hope that they improve on it.  That is what would probably bring me back.  Maybe spend some time looking at what they are doing in LA or NY.",t3dxO3Y0MMfdqcaVYfeUPA,7,1,2,yzLxe-3gVsO6hwY-q4ny0w

1229988,2013-01-22,0,Yiw2jUJzUdFmglHZgj4RaQ,"Came here last night with my husband and thought this place was pretty good. This is what we ordered:

Sashimi Salad: (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/808-tapas-east-west-infusion-las-vegas?select=tOXLeJwv5_Nvi7mDDw4g5w#tOXLeJwv5_Nvi7mDDw4g5w) Beautiful presentation and delicious. Honestly, the perfect way to start a meal. Loved the spring salad mix that is used instead of the cheap iceberg lettuce. The small cuts of sashimi was fresh and delicious. Really wished there were more of it. 

Pork Belly w/ asparagus: (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/808-tapas-east-west-infusion-las-vegas?select=tOXLeJwv5_Nvi7mDDw4g5w#HZ0BssRJX5kBx3c0p89z3g) Pork was tender and so were the asparagus. Flavors worked well together, but didn't think there was anything truly remarkable about this dish.

Garlic Chicken: (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/808-tapas-east-west-infusion-las-vegas?select=tOXLeJwv5_Nvi7mDDw4g5w#sZRoJcMaAFKNsDT2xe1blA) Did not like this. Too much batter for very little chicken meat. My first bite gave me the impression that it was a bit oily and squishy, because of all the batter on the chicken. Garlic flavor was light but overall, did not like this dish. 

Poke Nachos: (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/808-tapas-east-west-infusion-las-vegas?select=tOXLeJwv5_Nvi7mDDw4g5w#7QYkpIQPogu5P-Vp3ZS3aQ) Loved the ahi tuna on this dish and the lotus chips. Each chip I would say is 1-2 bites... and this dish only came with 5. I really wished there were more. But my husband wasn't a fan of this dish. 

Nasu Fries: (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/808-tapas-east-west-infusion-las-vegas?select=tOXLeJwv5_Nvi7mDDw4g5w#vsRGWc6KZDcKDnH-CbVLyQ) Wow, never had eggplant breaded in panko and fried and served as fries. This was delicious and loved the texture of the crisp outside and the warm and soft inside of the eggplant. The dipping sauce (lime wasabi) was surprisingly not spicy and really went well with these fries. These fries had a hint of coconut flavor to it. 

Tako Karrage (Octopus): (sorry, forgot to take a photo) The lemon wedge that comes with this is meant for squeezing right on top prior to eating and there is a reason why. The lemon really helps to heighten the flavors of the octopus (light flavor) to a whole another level. Absolutely delicious and light. Octupus is a little chewy but bite sized. 

Fritter: (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/808-tapas-east-west-infusion-las-vegas?select=tOXLeJwv5_Nvi7mDDw4g5w#cqb20EnTA8x5R-r95YFDqw) One of my most favorite items of our little meal. Loved the apple flavor in this. But the banana was too light so couldn't really taste it as much. The presentation of this dish was just very visually stunning (well actually all of the dishes we ordered were). The fritter had a nice and light taste and went perfectly well with the vanilla ice cream and caramel sauce. 

Now aside from the food, the service was very prompt and friendly. Our server was a tiny and petite Vietnamese girl (she told me she is Vietnamese, but honestly I wouldn't have guessed she was) who was very nice and polite. She always was quick to refill our drinks and clean away our table of dirty dishes. She always came back to check on us and see if we wanted to order more food since we just ordered food during the entire time we were there (we kept a menu at our table). The food came out quickly as well.

When we came, it was some time after 8 pm and there were only 4 other tables there but the place started to get more people in a little later. There is quite a bit of seating in this place with tall high top chairs (the ones you would sit around a cocktail table). There are 2 long tables that have these high top seating and also some seating at the sushi bar. There are also a handful of regular short tables as well. The decor in this place is minimal and clean. The ladies' restroom was clean and adequately stocked.

My only complaint of this place is where it is located. It is in a huge plaza with a Regal Cinema and located right next to Color Me Mine & a Thai Restaurant. There is also quite a bit of parking but the parking is kind of weird. This plaza actually makes me thing it was once a business complex, now made into a shopping plaza. 

But aside from the funky parking lot, this place does deliver bold fusion Asian taste. But yes the portion sizes are small (this is a Tapas restaurant after all) so don't expect to get your stomach full, unless you are willing to shuck out the extra $$$ (there's a reason why this place has 2 dollar signs). Overall, love the food we had so far (with the exception of the garlic chicken) and could see why others would give this place a 4 star rating like myself (1 star taken away for price).

The hostess desk is further in so don't be too confused when you walk in. Just keep walking or just stay by the front door & they'll seat you. Lol. Wait was about 30 mins for us even though there were a lot of empty tables. Not sure what the arrangement or process of seating people is but oh well.. Oh & expect to be served by at least 3 different servers since they're all very helpful. Owner was our main server, always a nice guy. I always see him at 808 Sushi but he probably didn't recognize me not wearing my scrubs. Haha.

Anyway, here were our orders:

Lycheetini-- Very sweet, subtle lychee flavor. Delicious! It's their special!

808 Tapas Sliders-- Comes with 2 juicy, moist, flavorful burgers & chips. The sauce on the burger was a great compliment. Whatever it was, it was delicious.

Kahana Chicken-- Tastes just like any other Teriyaki Chicken. I should've skipped it. I was gonna get Garlic Chicken but I always order that at 808 Sushi so I wanted to try something different.

Spicy Garlic Edemame-- Spicy with actual chili flakes. I prefer Island Sushi's though because it has some sauce with it but this is one is just chili oil or something.

Buta Hara Sautee-- Pork Belly & Asparagus. It was pretty good. Sauce is common though, like I've had it before. Nothing special but I liked it.

Saikyo Zuke-- OUR FAVORITE!!! BEST FREAKING MISO COD EVER. Melt in yo' mouth! 'Nuff said.

Poke Salad-- Boyfriend LOVED the Poke and I really liked the salad that came with it. Dressing was a bit too sweet but, it was a good start to our dinner.

Honolulu Shrimp Roll-- Shrimp & Crab mix in an egg roll/lumpia form with sweet chili. Genius.

Green Tea Ice Cream Tempura-- Big portion, esp after a big dinner. The tempura batter immediately came off the ice cream but it was very yummy.

Apple Fritter-- Apple egg roll/lumpia with vanilla ice cream & caramel sauce. Simple enough.


We pretty much went all out because it is probably our first and last visit here. Food was delicious but non-lunch & non-Happy hour prices are a little high.  But overall, it was a good dinner!",Nbr4DYLPxURjxelLVTSt8A,4,3,4,8MfPpy5e1AJsGcc0JZDJIw

I am a vegetarian and it should be easy to find something anywhere... but with fusion dishes it's nearly impossible to customize or substitute entrees and that creates problems for my diet and (mushroom) allergy.

Last night while arriving 45 min. prior to watching ""perks of being a wallflower"" (watch it!) I noticed this place next door. I have been wanting to try ""tapas"" (this was not that style of small plates)... 

My friend and I stopped in and ordered two individual glasses of sake wine 
(try the top red option if you dine here! I had the white peach- meh.) I simply ordered dessert which was the banana fritter + ice cream. It was good but nothing spectacular. Ordinary deep fried 'nana, fruit as a garnish, and a scoop of ice cream. Not even really worth the $6. Why didn't I eat any 'real food'? I only noticed one tofu dish listed throughout the whole menu. Not very impressed. And NOT veggie friendly. 
I've been to other sushi places and usually I can at best find a ramen noodle option. Not the case here.

Also, the female server was nice 'n all, she mentioned. . .""Oh if you ever stop here AFTER your movie you can bring your ticket stub and get a discount""

808 tapas sliders- wagyu beef, shitake mushrooms, ginger wasabi mayo-- this was like your everyday sliders, nothing too crazy. We didn't get the mushrooms on them cause the bf isn't a fan. I didn't really get a strong taste of the wasabi, they were still good sliders- nonetheless. 

We also tried the Kahuku shrimp: shrimp with shell on cooked and sauteed with garlic, spice, and jalapeno, this really felt like a home cooked entree. We got 3 jumbo shrimps and it was really crispy, you could eat the shell! 

We also got the Kalbi ribs! These were amazing. They weren't too sweet and they brought them out piping hot. We didn't order a side of rice, but it woulda been really good if we did!

Hamachi shooters- not sure how I'm supposed to eat this but flavors are good.

Rolls- 808 special, Victorino, and Banzai Pipline in order of preference.

MISS:
Fish tacos. It's just $2 and two bites, but was virtually tasteless compared to the other items. Missing something, needs a sauce or something acidic besides a squirt of lime juice.

Still good variety of seating from long stool tables front of the restaurant, tables towards the back, and decent size sushi bar area that fits over ten or so people. I ended up sitting at the sushi bar area once friends showed. I LOVED it the whole time hearing local Hawaiian music. I was thinking hearing bruddah Iz over sushi, hanging out with friends, talking stories, and good food it exactly local style from the roots. The menu got too love the fact they have shaka signs for the more popular dishes on the menu. The menu is good size two pages, great variety of dishes, and not just all sushi. 

Since with mini group great got too try few things on the menu. The main things I ordered was the garlic chicken, waygu sliders, poke salad, and ended with yellowtail jalapeno. I got too try bite of friends ceviche, uni pasta, sashimi, and couple rolls. Not too go into details of everyone because reviewed. The sliders come two per order but easy could have had six be in sliders bliss! The waygu beef was amazing! I loved fact cooked perfect, moist, and the mushrooms cheese on top all came together. True 808 form came with taro chips. I love taro chips more cleaner then potatoes, less greasy, and nice crispy. Poke salad not only poke solid. Enjoyed the fact came with decent amount of organic greens and great dressing tossed in. Tapas never know the portion size going too get from dish too dish. Most part all the dishes I ordered and the ones friends ordered decent size. The yellowtail jalapeno. The five star dish for me!! The yozu sauce on top with thin slice of jalapeno on top each piece. The sashimi grade quality fish. Amazing. The quality of all the fish here was nice, fresh, and ranks up near the top of my favorite sushi spots in vegas. The garlic chicken loved the sauce it was in and chicken pieces fried perfect yet moist and juicy meat on the inside. 

Since mini group enjoyed that more then willing do separate checks for people. Sure place that pan on coming back because SOOO much more of the menu that want too try.",iSC96O2NjQc3JExGUHQG0Q,2,3,4,eq5HnuAZ5BQ0Dxm74XpWEw

Right away she took ""lunch menu"" and ""happy hour menu"" away from me. I asked her to give back the menu, cuz I'm not sure which one we going to choice from. She looked at me and gave the menu back, but keep remind me, you can't choice these menu if you use coupon. I really not happy with that kind of attitude as my server, somehow I think she is the only server  who works there today.
We ordered 808 sushi roll, fried tofu, and friend shrimp salad. First 2 dishes were wonderful, shrimp salad were so so.
After we almost finished the food, lady came by try to take the empty plate. This time she grabbed my friend's cell phone wallet and put it on the side to reach the paper underneath.

I was really surprised that on a Friday evening, it wasn't packed at all, in fact we had our choice of tables. We were promptly brought out menus and water, and I had a good feeling. We selected several dishes to get started - edamame, garlic chicken, ceviche, sliders, short ribs, and bacon wrapped asparagus.

The ceviche came out first. It was presented nicely but there was weren't a lot of shrimp and scallops in it. The taro chips were good. Next came the garlic chicken, it wasn't what we were expected, it was described as crispy chicken thighs, but it was almost like chicken pork rinds, just deep fried pieces of chewy chicken skin, it was unappetizing. 

The sliders were great, as were the short ribs and bacon wrapped asparagus (we each got an order which was 1 skewer). I LOVED the edamame. I could have just gotten my own order of sliders and the garlicky, chile covered edamame and been quite happy.

Why 3 stars? I would have given 4, but after we finished eating, we were totally ignored. At least 3 staff members walked past us while we sat waiting at our table, and no one checked on us for 20 minutes. My husband was going to order a sushi roll, but by the time someone finally stopped (we had tried to flag someone down), we decided we were ready for the check.

For starters the sushi chef left the doors to the refrigerators open. Big no no. Chef slapped a wet towel down and shot wasabe all over my girlfriend. Didn't notice and therefore couldn't apologize. 

Hamachi shooter was a pain in the butt to eat and not worth the effort. The ponzu sauce was way too strong, and they put it in everything we tried.  Salmon carpaccio, pass on the dish. The onions inside too strong and the salmon was still a bit frozen.  

They charged $4 for a pot of green tea that was made from a tea bag. 

The freshest thing we had was garnish.  

Staff is cool and hip, but way too concerned with being cool and hip to provide actual service.  When you have an ""open kitchen"" concept, maybe teach the chef to not eat food with bare hands out in the opened while preparing other food.

I have no idea what it's called but I greatly dislike it and had to spit it out. The rest of it was very good though! 

Also tried the 808 Special Roll which was just aiight.
Of course I had to order the pork belly skewers - two rounds of these - SO good of course!

How could you go wrong, sound like a great combination right? Well the food tasted great, had no issues with the that, however other things certainly did not live up to my expectations. 

808 tapas is located inside the Village Square where Chicago's Brewery is off of Sahara and Fort Apache. Had no issues parking, we went around 6:30pm and the shopping center was fairly busy, there's a movie theatre inside Village Square but it's far down in the corner. That will be good to know, and I will explain why. 

I walked into the restaurant and at first thought it was seat yourself but saw a podium far inside, within seconds I was greeted with a smile and seated. The decorum is nothing special, pretty basic. I ordered the 808 roll, 5 piece salmon sashimi, and the steamed mussels. The 808 rolls were to die for, it tasted equally with how it looked. My only issue is when I order a sushi roll I want it to be the size of a sushi roll, they were tiny!

The sashimi was delicious and the steamed mussels were huge! Very succulent and rich flavor. My wife also ordered sushi and hers were small to, not what we're used to. I had dinner with my wife with no alcohol and I ended up spending over $75 with tip, and I wasn't stuffed!!

Quantity isn't everything but I want to be somewhat full at those prices. If it wasn't for the great service and the fact that the food was good id be giving it 2 stars. If you bring a movie ticket it's 20% off awesome deal, and from 3pm to 6pm it's half price!!

2619277,2014-05-19,1,Yiw2jUJzUdFmglHZgj4RaQ,"Beautiful presentation, yet non explosive flavors made this place just alright. Many dishes didn't exceed our expectations, they mostly fell short by a few notches. There was only a slim list of memorable items on the menu. The best thing that we ordered was surprisingly the sake nigiri (salmon). It was super moist, buttery and incredibly sweet! We ended up ordering 4 rounds of it. 

Tempura mussels - the mussels were very large but they were also super awkward to eat. You can't bite it in half, so you have to pretty much pop the whole big piece into your mouth. Make sure to get some (or a lot) of that spicy mayo wasabi caviar sauce on the bite- that sauce made it! 

Fish tacos - they were perfectly bite sized, crispy and refreshing. Yet, I felt that they could of used another note of flavor. It was lacking depth. I ended up dipping my fish taco into the tempura mussel's spicy mayo wasabi caviar sauce and it set it off to whole notha level! It went from good to great! 

Miso marinated black cod - we enjoyed the small piece of marinated black cod, it was moist, buttery and flavorful - until my boyfriend swallowed a pin bone. There were a bunch of them so he had to pick them all out carefully in order for us to enjoy the fish. I don't know if they dropped the ball on our dish or if someone forgot to notify us that this fish had bones in it still, but anyway you want to put it, it was very uncomfortable for him since he had pin bones stuck in his throat after eating this dish. I also took a picture of the annoying little bones that stab your throat as you swallow. 

Poke nachos on top of fried crispy lotus root chips - they were beautiful and the tuna tasted fresh, however the poke marinade and seasoning was very dry and bland. There was nothing memorable or worthwhile about this dish. 

Usuzukuri - halibut sashimi in a special ponzu sauce. As pretty as this dish looked, I had an issue with the flavor profile. It was bland and didn't celebrate the halibut. Plus the halibut was sliced in such a way that it was not tender and buttery.  

Yellowtail jalapeño - Sashimi grade yellowtail topped with jalapeño and a yuzu cilantro sauce. The cucumber took away from the yellowtail's delicious flavor and delicate texture. We chose to eat the rest without it. This isn't a winning dish, the fish was fresh, but the yuzu cilantro sauce was bland and basic. 

Halibut and Salmon nigiri - Both were delicate and fresh. The salmon had to of been the top dish of the night. It was incredibly sweet and buttery. My salmon addicted tongue was overjoyed!

Miso soup - it was salty beyond enjoyment. I didn't finish it. 

It was very pricey, we spent about $90 or so on our bill and we were food coma stuffed, but there were way too many flaws here and there for me to fully be satisfied with this place.",u_wqt9RshdZsoj8ikLqoEQ,1,1,3,rrc_XcWdgsoINA4xu1wqcA

The service was excellent as she constantly was attentive and very pleasant demeanor.  
I got the ceviche and the tuna sashimi.  The ceviche was pretty acidic without much other flavor, the shrimp, scallop and mango flavors didn't pop like they should.  The tuna sashimi was fresh and good which you would find at any sushi restaurant.  
He got the 808 roll and the miso soup, the roll was his favorite.  We shared the lamb pops and they were just cubes of lamb on a toothpick and it wasn't tender it was quite chewy.  
There was more we wanted to try but it was all fried.

The photos on Yelp make it look way more flavorful and delicious than it actually is. The sushi chefs were nice and friendly, the rest of the service sucked.

Came here on a Saturday night around 7 pm and surprisingly, it was empty. The hostess was very nice and seated us quickly. As for the food, here is what we ordered:

-beets salad: I love beets! I always have. There were chunks of beets marinated in a sweet sauce and placed over spring greens. It was super refreshing and had a good crunch! Probably my favorite thing!

-soft shell crab: typical of what a soft shell crab appetizer should taste like. Fried, crispy, seafood goodness, but nothing that blew my mind.  It came with a side salad topped with a ginger dressing. The dressing was a little heavy for what ginger dressings are supposed to taste like. 

-808 ceviche: chunks of seafood mixed with mango, onions, avocado and cilantro, served with taro chips. The seafood was not fishy at all and the mango added a nice tang to it. The chips were crisp and not hard. The sauce they used was light, which was enhanced the seafood flavors. 

-lamb skewers: this was not my favorite. It was way too chewy and salty for my taste. I know that lamb is supposed to be a bit chewier, but this was just hard to eat. 

-kaiser bowl: sushi roll filled with snow crab and yum yum sauce, topped with ahi tuna and chunks of mango. I only are two pieces because the tang of the sauce was a little too sour. I did eat the tuna and the mango chunks on top though. 

After finishing these dishes, we were still hungry and ordered more 

-eggplant fries: fried eggplant!! I get worried about places that fry eggplant because it tends to come out soggy. But not here!! It was crunchy and not at all greasy. It was served with a side of wasabi lime mayo, but it was too overpowering for the dish. I just dipped them in soy sauce and was happy. It reminded me of my childhood when my mom would make fried eggplant:)

-808 sliders: mini burgers topped with marinated shiitake mushrooms and Hawaiian ginger wasabi mayo. By the time this came out, I was too full to indulge in it. I took one bite, so I can't really give a fair judgement to this one. I'm sure if I wasn't so stuffed I would enjoy this more.

The fish in both were overpowered by the seasoning and sauces but both were enjoyable. The kalbi ribs were rich and sweet but also very oily. The sushi and sashimi were the weakest items due to the chewy and tough texture of some of the fish. The sinew in the tuna was rather pronounced and made it tough to eat.

There's a unique-ness about this restaurant. It's Hawaiian/ Japanese fusion. All of their rolls are really fresh. On their special menu they incorporate a lot of Hawaiian ingredients. Their Kaki (oyster) shooters are to die for. They're in shell shooters with a vinegary ponzo sauce, tobiko and onion. 

Our last visit we tried the 808 sliders--wagyu beef, shatake mushrooms, with Hawaiian ginger wasabi mayo. They were really good, two nice sized sliders per order. They were very filling. After all those rolls, we almost had to be wheeled out of there. 

We prefer cold dishes so we usually stick with their sushi but it's nice to know that all of their hot dishes are amazing too.

My wife and I took your suggestions and made it a point to go to 808 Tapas on our visit to LV (we're from the SF Bay Area). WE WERE NOT DISAPPOINTED!! First, we used a Groupon, which was graciously accepted. Then we ordered the Kalbi short ribs (awesome), 808 Ceviche (really good), Fish Tacos (awesome), Garlic Chicken (good) and the Crabstack (awesome)....You will enjoy each of these dishes. I'll let you read better descriptions of each of these in the other reviews, just know that all were very, very good. In full disclosure, I gottta say the 808 Ceviche was very tastey, but could've used some ""kick"". My wife and I like a little spice, and the ceviche didn't have much. It WAS tastey and the taro chips that came with it were very good and a great accent and contrast to the ceviche. My wife liked the Ceviche, fish tacos and Kalbi short ribs the best and I thought the crabstack and ribs and fish tacos were the best. Oh, you gotta order the crabstack. It was light and full of flavor. It comes with a spoon, but using the taro chips (from the ceviche) to scoop the crabstack was even better!! To finish off the meal, we ordered the green tea/tempura ice cream. This too was awesome. Oh, the presentation of each dish was top notch.  We went on a Monday evening at 8 p.m. and it was fairly quiet. This allowed us to chat with both waitresses who offered suggestions and doted on us (and the other patrons too) which made us feel kinda special! Oh, we did order a lot for two people and were able to bring home in a doggie bag to enjoy the remainder of the meal the next day!

Man, I'm glad we went to 808 and I plan on coming back the next time we're in LV.

It is really a sushi restaurant, with the word Tapas in the name. And, honestly that is true, this detail is a misfire. We did go in hoping for a combo of tasty asian style small plates, and maybe a bit of sushi. It would seem to me making a simple non-sushi menu with the existing sushi ingredients would be relatively easy. A small daily menu of ""Asian Tapa"" style plates. But always easy for me, a customer, to say. :-/

Once we realized it was basically a sushi restaurant we went with it, because we do love sushi. We ended up doing was a couple of sashimi salads, a couple rolls, edamame, and some miso soup. Everything was fresh and tasty. Is it the best I have ever had? Probably not but it was really good, & would I go again, absolutely. The menu is very affordable, and food really fresh. A great combo in my book!

This is a fun restaurant... fun people and a fun menu!

When you enter... the staff welcomes with a loud... ALOHAAAA!
And when you depart... they all yell.... MAAHAALLO!

There was 5 in our party.... We hung out for a couple hours visiting and eating our way through the menu.  It seemed like the whole staff stopped by our table at one time or another to chat ....see how we were doing or drop off a dish or accept our order or refill our drinks.  

We ordered a couple tapas at a time.... and they came out pretty quick... Note... they have a lot of Sushi on the menu... but there is so much more than just sushi... and everything is quite tasty!

Figure on ordering 3-4 per person for a meal... I think we actually ordered like 6 per person because we had 2 pages to our receipt... with drinks and tax... note... we had a couple drinks each... our bill came to about $45/pp... so it's not a cheap place... but it is a fun place with fun dishes and fun people. (definitely more reasonable if you're not consuming alcohol)

By the way.... their cocktails are awesome!  My new favorite drink is their Lychee Saketini.  This one is dangerous... not too sweet and oh so smooth Tropical-y Yumminess.

Like I said.... we ate our way through the menu.... I think we got through about 1/2 the menu.... our favorites...

I can't remember everything we ate.... it was a lot.... here are a few notables:

Eggplant Fries.... you do have to like Eggplant... these were crispy on the outside... soft on the inside.

Wagyu Sliders.... juicy... meaty.... melt in your mouth goodness.... and the mushrooms are a nice touch.  The buns are soft and not overpowering.... it's just there so you have something to hold the burger from goo-ing all over your hands.

Pork Belly and Asparagus.... So Freakin' Good!  Next time... I'm not sharing.  I'm getting a bowl of rice and enjoying this as a full on entree all to myself.  The pork belly was firm and not overly fatty... the aspargus was cooked but not soggy.

We will be back... in fact... I see there's a Groupon available ... I'm buying it right after I hit 'post'.  :)",PV0VEhlmhc2BjzMZEbpWlg,1,1,4,pUJgVjacMwifbXpDezXplQ

It's more like Sushi fusion, but I love Sushi so it was great. What I liked about it, is you really got a sense of the chef's personality; every dish seemed original and custom. 

My favorite thing was this yellow tail ""shot"", I forget the exact name but it was really good. Next time I might just get 10 of those and call it a day. The food was all high end presentation, and much of it layered the flavors so your taste buds went on a real journey. 

The restaurant itself is pretty bare-bones, and has a sushi bar vibe, there is an actual sushi bar you can sit at. The walls have no art, and I feel like some old school Japanese art work, side by side with something more contemporary would  really take the vibe to the next level. Wait staff was super nice, and we didn't have to wait long.

Saw 808 tapas which peaked my interest.  Called to make reservations because there were 7 of us. Spoke to the hostess that I wanted to make reservations. She said they only make reservations for parties of 10. I said oh and she  asked how many were in  our party.  I told her 7 and she said she would hold a table for me.  Great! 

We arrived at the restaurant which was located in a strip mall. Decor was ok. We walked in and were immediately greeted.  Told the hostess we had reservations and she sat us right away. She asked if we wanted drinks and we ordered saki and a soda. She brought our drinks and asked if we wanted to order food. Server was very attentive. We waited until the rest of our party arrived. 

The remainder of our party arrived and the server took their drink order. The waitress returned with the drinks and took our order.  We had some questions about the food and she was very knowledgeable.  

Within 15 minutes of our food order the food arrived the presentation and portions were very good. Short ribs were a killer. Nacho poke was very good. Throughout our dinner the staff was fantastic. We ordered a lot of plates and everything was very good. Icould write about it all but you are probably tired by now. 

We finished our meal and couldn't order dessert. I ate so much I had to orw the mint tea (recommended).

I've heard nothing but awesome things about this place had plans to try it out. And then I saw a $20 Groupon for $40 worth of food. You better believe that I got on that faster than Speedy Gonzalez! Be aware though, If you are using a Groupon, you can't use it on happy hour items! Full priced menu items only. But the menu items are decently priced and you'll leave with a full and happy belly for $40 worth. 

Service is outstanding here. Our server always checked up on us to see if we needed anything else. There was a gentleman that always checked up on us too, I think he is the owner. He told the sushi chef to fix my boyfriend and me Tensai Hamachi Shooters on the house! The hamachi is mixed with a spicy ponzu sauce and some truffle oil. Win!

It was cold outside so we ordered some hot tea. You have a choice from the green, apple and mint. My boyfriend had the hot apple tea. Aroma of this one is fantastic and it tastes just like granny smith apples. 

And now, the food. Oh my my my my! 

- Spicy Tuna Crackers: Ahi tuna in a special sauce on wasabi rice crackers. The crackers were quite interesting. A zing from the wasabi is a nice touch to the tuna.
- Yellowtail jalapeno: 5 pieces of thick yellowtail sashimi in a yuzu cilantro sauce. Garnished with a jalapeno and a sliver of cucumber. The sauce didn't overpower the fish. The jalapenos were really spicy when we went. But nonetheless, this was yummy. 
- 808 Tapas Nasu Fries: Panko crusted eggplant with wasabi lime dipping sauce. I can have 10 orders of these to myself! Thick eggplant slices, they don't skimp out. Piping hot and the cooling sauce is the perfect combination. My new guilty pleasure for sure. 
-Fish tacos: Panko crusted tilapia with blood orange slaw. The are $2 a piece during happy hour! Delicious. Slaw is tangy and the fish is perfectly cooked. 
-808 Tapas Crab Stack: veggies, mango and snow crab in a ginger lime dressing. This was super refreshing. I loved the sweetness of the mango and the crunchiness of the veggies. The server brought this out as a literal stack - all the ingredients were in a tower-like form. The server then mashed our stack into a mixed salad.
- Saikyo Zuke: Broiled black cod that has been marinated in miso for 2 days. So flavorful and succulent! 
- Green Tea Tempura Ice Cream. Deep fried ball of green tea goodness! Served with whipped cream and a raspberry garnish. Perfect note to end the meal.

What we ordered:

Screaming Dakine (Seared Tuna):  Fresh! Delish! The accompanying red caviar is a huge compliment to each bite.  Definitely a must order!

Spicy Tuna Crackers:  Spicy Tuna atop a wasabi cracker!  What a great combination.  This was one of my man's favorite dishes.  Definitely another must order!

808 Nasu Fries:  This is actually fried eggplant served with wasabi lime dipping sauce.  This is actually a good combination to eat with all of the other dishes.  Served as if it is a carbohydrate supplement, but really, it's a panko crusted vegetable!  

Baked Mussels:  Yum!  Some of the best I've ever tasted compared to many AYCE sushi spots I have been to.  

Garlic Chicken: a must order!  I love Garlic Chicken, and boy do they do it right here.  Great flavor, and crisped to perfection.  For a tapa plate, it's a pretty good portion too.

Honolulu Shrimp Roll: didn't exactly give us the wow factor on this one, but it was good enough to eat.

Black cod: OMG....a must order if you love Butter Fish!  Melt in your mouth type deal, and the slab of fish is defintiely not shady.  I wish we ordered this in the beginning because I would have gotten one each for the both of us NOT to share! haha!

We're definitely coming back here!  We love this place!",ksYpOznbD-22wYpTiacHwA,4,1,5,O6n3QBBJIJQqbc1ts1J9Bg

4011974,2012-08-27,7,Yiw2jUJzUdFmglHZgj4RaQ,"808 Tapas opened on 08/22/12, how are there reviews already?  Lets say you have a private soft opening; opened to friends, family, and special guests which is fine since I have attended a few but to write a review of it nearly violating Yelp's Conflict of Interest hmm.  

Integrity check.  

But at least they're not fake reviews, just exaggerated.  I've had my eyes on this place like so many of my fellow peers who are eager waiters as well, most recent would be Christie O. waiting for Rachel's Kitchen to open up for example.  But before we get to the food just know that 808 is the area code for Hawaii.  And tapas, in short, are variety of appetizers or snacks.  Combine these and you have a formula for something special.  The 808 name is part Gimmick, not every dish has that Hawaiian influence in it.

My favorites so far have been the yellow tail jalapeno, oysters (specials), salmon carpaccio and celery tako.  The cuts on the yellow tail, salmon, and tako were perfect.  The oysters were fresh and instead of dousing or tapped with tabasco, it worked well topped and sauced.  The yellow tail was presented beautifully.  The salmon carpaccio was very generous in cut, the bits of avocado and white onion slices was nice.  The celery tako is my absolute favorite.  Now, the following two dishes are interesting.

Starting with the uni tempura, I liked it however I don't know if it's worth the price at $10.  The uni nigiri is $8 and I would prefer to get the raw fresh taste of uni than have it coated and deep fried, basically masking the taste of the Oceans butter.  But as far as the dish itself, it was good.  When you break the lightly dressed crunchy shell you can taste the uni core.  I'm passing up on this next time and trying their uni pasta (to see how it compares to Chef Marc's).

The tensai shooter I had to order twice at $3.00 each, the second order took 20 mins to come out and I thought I was going to get charged for it again.  Mix up in the back of the house.  I asked myself how a tiny, pinky sized, cup dish takes 20 mins to prepare.  But I liked the amberjack, truffle sauce, avocado, pea sprout, jalapeno, ""red caviar"" combination.  The reason why I ordered it the second time was to eat it in a different way by mixing it and combining it in the cup, gather it up with chopsticks and eat it that way rather than shoot it.  I would try this at least once, especially if you're a hamachi or amberjack lover.

I was not a fan of the 808 ceviche, if I remember correctly the proteins in it were scallops and shrimp then mixed in a mango cucumber corn cilantro salsa.  Even though the chips and salsa were freshly made I was not a fan, especially at $8.  One more chopped up scallops then maybe but if I'm missing proteins on a healthy scoop then I'll pass.  The lomi lomi salmon caprese will be passed by me next time as well.  I was excited for this one seeing that I grew up on lomi lomi salmon but even though it was there on top of two slices of mozzarella, it didn't work for me.  I know what they were going for, something similar to a mozzarella caprese.  The lomi lomi salmon was good though.

The only finger licking item I had to experience was probably the steamed mussels.  The sauce is sweet and the mussel meat are still attached to the clam shell.  So you'll have to hold it down or in place and peel it off.  

The above orders were all ""what would you recommend"".  The only item I ordered truly for myself was the garlic chicken, and it tasted as good as 808 Sushi's which confirms they were borrowed.  There are no happy hour items yet.  Keep in mind they are closed on Sundays but open late until 2am on business days.  

During my first visit when I sat down and asked for water, I was offered only between bottled Fiji water or Sparkling Water... immediately cha-ching at the cash register with that one.  But the service here is top notch, the female servers are always checking up on you.  And Chef Yoshi is very talented, I hope he doesn't just teach and go back to 808 Sushi.  One of the main reasons why I tipped $10 both times was in hopes they would share it with the chefs behind the counter.  When you first walk in you'll get a very enthusiastic AALOHAAAA!  And when you're leaving you get a MAAHHALO!  Somewhere in between I'd like a daaa kineee.

So friends, do come and try this new spot out on W. Sahara and Ft. Apache, next to Coldstone where they looked at me funny for days when I would walk up and 808 Tapas continued to be closed but be mindful of the above guidelines to get the most out of your experience and money.  I'll continue to come here but I already know what I like and find value in.  So my experiences will be better.  But if you choose the right items at the right price you'll be golden, it is just depressing to think I can spend $1 more and get a Ronin Burger or Kalbi Burger next door compared to two pieces of Sliders at $9.",k4M43lXJuQMpQW65DTqzIQ,18,12,3,5M7aCbzvBQ2yDWEi283AOw

The crab/mango salad was boring.  The hamachi was fresh but once again, lacked any pizzazz.  The crispy fried chicken was yummy (but that's a hard one to mess up).  My sake sangria was a disappointment.  It had a cough syrup sort of flavor.  

The prices were high.  Luckily we had a groupon.  

Service was great.  Everyone was very friendly and nice.  Restaurant was clean.  Very strange that they have a long bar with stools facing the wall.  Who wants to dine staring at a blank wall?

Met Run Bike Swim Yelper Terri R for a quick bite. We wanted to try something different, something that we both haven't tried.  In other words, get our bookmarks done. 

Running errands all day and was actually a little late.  Didn't help much that the parking here is horrible.  The parking issues right now is due to recent construction.  Otherwise, I'm usually in and out of this shopping center with the quickness.  Located off Ft. Apache and Sahara. You really can't miss this place since it's right of the movie theater.  

First grab of the menu and everything looked good.  You have to remember with any tapas style restaurant that the prices are cheap for mini dishes.  To get the full tapas experience, you have to order at least 4 items from the menu.  

Here's what I had:
-Miso Soup: Just your basic Miso soup.  Hit the spot for a cold night.  Just wish I remembered if I could have added an egg to it.  

-Sliders:  This is their version of beef sliders and man where they good.  You get two sliders with the order and they are pretty big for sliders.  Meat was prepared well and cheese topped it off.  For a slider, it was so juicy and even creamy if that makes any sense.  Rare to describe a slider as juicy, but somehow 808 Tapas got it there. Thinking back..I probably could have downed two more, maybe four. Okay, five.  

-Spicy Tuna Crackers:  As soon as I put in this request, I was told this is a great pick. This is basically how it sounds (spicy tuna spread over 2 inches of cracker).  Each cracker was too heavy to eat with chopsticks so I ate them ""Hors d'oeuvre"" style. I had this order all to myself because Terri R can't handle fish.  Even though these crackers were heavy, the whole order wasn't heavy on the belly and tasted great.  Great taste, less filling. 

-Drink:  I didn't have any sake. Actually, I didn't have anything to drink, not even water.  I didn't realize it until after we were done eating.  I guess that's what I get for being late.  

I didn't try any rolls, mainly because I just had sushi earlier in the day.  I was craving meat and got it. I still need to try other items on the menu.

As for the restaurant's ambiance.  Staff was good, but remember I didn't get water.  Besides the parking, everything was good.  It's not the biggest restaurant out there, but it's also not a busy one. Especially for a Saturday night, it looked to be a little slow.  

I will be back to try other things for sure.  I just hope they fix the parking lot soon.",y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ,3,1,4,OY-2PvFbobIvi-ilYnM7OA

4134608,2014-04-02,0,Yiw2jUJzUdFmglHZgj4RaQ,"I've been wanting to try this place for months! I finally made a visit last night. I wasn't sure if I created my own disappointment (gauging from all the good reviews) by hyping it up for all these months, or if my tastes are just shifting?

It's first come first serve seating in a quaint little space. They have a ""family style"" high table in the middle, a few two tops to the right, and some 4 tops in the back with a bar. The atmosphere was nice.

This is what was ordered: The crab stack, ceviche, the 808 special roll, the makapuu roll, baked mussels, steamed mussels and a white peach sakeria.

The ceviche was the best, in my opinion. The crab stack was good, but the sauce that's with it was a little weird, it is just a ginger lime sauce, nothing out of the ordinary. It just must of not paired right on my palette with the other flavors of the dish.

The sushi rolls were good, my fave was the makapuu, it was a take on surf n turf, with seared beef on top of the roll. But still, its sushi and most rolls taste similar, so it's easy for them not to stand out.

The baked mussels were ordered first. Baked mussels have to be my most favorite thing in all the lands. But not these. They tasted like bacon.. I know, how could something that tastes like bacon not be fantastic?! Probably when its seafood and topped with wasabi caviar. Also, the texture was off, I'm not sure if it was the wasabi caviar or the mussels that were crunchy, but something definitely was. The steamed mussels were way better, but still, something with the texture of them were off. Flavor was on point however.

I definitely think it is a place to try at least once! Like I said, my tastes may be changing or I hyped it up to much, but I just wasn't impressed. I may go back after awhile for happy hour, that way I don't waste my money on something I'm not completely satisfied with.",2KXR93JrBu2FOjFIhy0QzA,1,1,3,Ftk2DVaU8AU2qABiN54-5g

Ok, so I have to say right off the bat that I am usually hesitant to check out restaurants with numbers in their name. I don't know why, but I was famished and decided to give it a shot.

Holy moly. This place is great! We sat at the bar, ogling over the fresh fish in front of us. We both ordered the ahi salad from the lunch menu. The sushi chef, Yoshi, went to work on it. It's a simple salad but it was bursting with flavor! The fish was super fresh. While we were at he bar, the sushi chf noticed we were speaking Spanish and he asked us where we were from. We told him Mexico. It turns out he was the person in charge of opening Nobu in Mexico city! He told us how he use to work at the Nobu here in Las Vegas and how he was sent down to the D.F. for a year to open the restaurant. We talked a while about the different areas of the city and the great food. Very, very cool guy.

At one point our server came over to ask if we had been shopping for Black Friday. I told him we came to the plaza to go to the movies. He told me if you show them your tickets you get 20% of your bill! Amazing! Our lunch for two ended up costing $14 dollars! For Nobu quality food! We will definitely be returning!

But here are the misses:

1 - Pricing to food ratio is terrible! For example, the Wagyu sliders comes in two for 9 bucks. Delicious, tender but that's STEEP! Then again, I've never really had bad sliders. The wings were plump and crispy. Tasted exactly like Korean Fried Chicken. But again, small portions!  Other items on the menu are your typical Vegas sushi joint, tasty but forgettable. $90 for 3 people later without any drinks, and we ended up being European full.

2- YOU NEED HIGH CHAIRS!!  If you're going to open in Summerlin, you expect to serve children.  This actually kills my meal holding my child on my lap and eating from tiny dishes.

4451480,2014-01-23,0,Yiw2jUJzUdFmglHZgj4RaQ,"A clean-cut, hip type establishment in a shopping center hefty with numerous options of good eats. 808 may not stand out much in this strip mall loaded with numerous eating options, but it should not be over-looked.

The establishment itself is decently sized with a temporary design. The bar is situated to the right hand corner, while dining areas are around the left side and in the front of the restaurant. Service was on-spot while my friend and I dined here during a not-so-busy afternoon. In fact, we were the only patrons the entire time we were here. I assume this place gets busy in the later hours of the evening.

The menu is pleasing, with an extensive amount of tapas and sushi to choose from. Lunch menu items were somewhat of a disappointment and did not entice me. Instead I chose from the main dining menu.

808 Ceviche - Definitely not like any ceviche I have had, as this ceviche was not made entirely of fish, but small pieces of rock shrimp and scallops. There was way too much corn in it and too much lime. It was not really ceviche in my opinion as ceviche should be primarily fish (or whatever seafood you're using), this was not. Although the taro chips served with it were tasty.

Banzai Pipeline - Basically their version of a rainbow roll. Although very good, and a nice assortment of fish, A+ on presentation and tightly wrapped rolls.

Dynamite - A seafood mix with mushrooms and special sauce. I've never been a huge fan of this type of dish, but it was decent.

Octopus Salad - Probably the best dish besides the sushi. A very lefy green spinach salad topped with a yummy good helping of octopus and a nice, light dressing.

Overall I think this place is a great restaurant to visit. Plus, the menu leaves me desiring to come back and try out more options. Good job!",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,2,1,4,wlKA04koqEZz-9CgRWURwQ

We ordered 6 tapas and asked the server to bring them out one at a time.  She did just so and the timing of each dish was perfect.  If we did not ask for this pace, all 6 plates would have been on our table at one time.

We ordered:  

Spinach Tako:  This was the second time having this dish.  Again the tako was dry and chewy.  The miso dressing was good.  I would prefer this dish with some bay shrimp or some other seafood.

808 Ceviche:  Our absolute favorite.  We must order this every single time.

Buta Hara Sautee:  The pork belly was a little fatty.  Again we had to ask for a serving spoon.

Honolulu Shrimp Roll: This came out hot and freshly fried with a sweet chili sauce.

Kalbi Short Ribs:  6 thick tender pieces on a bed of raw shredded cabbage.  My favorite Kalbi in Las Vegas.

Shrimp Curry: 3 shrimp tempura on top of curry and a scoop of rice.  This dish could have used another scoop of rice.

4570997,2013-02-17,0,Yiw2jUJzUdFmglHZgj4RaQ,"We had a groupon expiring before we left town so we came here and dragged our friend Heather K. across town to try a new place with us.  The joint has a combination of a high communal table, small tables, and a sushi bar.  We sat towards the back on the restaurant, and ended up with 3 different servers.  All of them were nice but service still was a tad slow considering we had 3 different people helping us.

I started off with the tropical cloud saketini - Tyku coconut nigori sake, mango puree, yuzu juice, lime and a li hing mui (salted dried plum) crusted rim.  This was really delicious and I loved the rim too. I happen to like all of those things but after the sake tasting at Social House that I reviewed, I purchased Tyku coconut sake and now know how I can use it at home for my benefit!

Eric R and Heather K. ordered hot green tea - the menu has 3 kinds but they were not asked what they wanted, so they got plain.  Eric R. also got the blueberry coconut mojito.  We ordered several items progressively.

Lamb pops - tender hunks of lamb in sauce on a stick - very flavorful, cooked just right

Sashimi salad - Eric R. ate most of this, but it was mixed greens with salmon, tuna and hamachi in ginger-onion dressing.  The dressing was really tasty.

Tensai shooters - special hamachi cuts with ponzu and white truffle oil, cilantro and jalepeno in shot glass - it was very citrus-y so Eric R. who does not like citrus, ponzu or truffle was pre-dispositioned to not like.  I liked it but it was a tad sour.

Miso black cod - my favorite of the night - marinated 24 hours in miso, the black cod was tender, flaky, flavorful, and topped with chopped green onions.  A MUST order.

Nasu fries - panko crusted eggplant with wasabi lime dip.  Heather K. loved these and I did too, but I was the only one who could handle the dip :)

Agedashi tofu - unlike your typical agedashi tofu, this was fried triangles of tofu with the dashi ""sauce"" on top and mixed shimeji and enoki mushrooms and a dash of green onion.  It actually was very tasty and the tofu held its fried texture well.  I would get this again.

Beet salad - mixed greens, red beets, and sesame seeds.  Nothing too special, but it was unique to taste beets with the sesame.

Waimea Roll - I added this at the end because it was the first time a long time that I had seen soft shell crab (and salmon skin) rolls with gobo, kaiware, cucumber, and avocado.  The soft shell crab was also not breaded and fried with crispy coating.  I did not share this one, but it reminded me of the spider rolls I had as a kid in Houston.  I got the unagi sauce on the side, and thoroughly enjoyed this since I am not usually a rolls eater whatsoever.

Overall, my favorites were the miso black cod and the Waimea roll.  There is a huge menu with so much to try, but with only 3 of us we did devour a lot of items.  The groupon was a good deal.  When we got our check, it was unusually low and I realized we were not charged for a cocktail and an item, so I had to get it adjusted.  That is the hard part for the restaurant when 3 servers are working each table!  I would return even just for the 2 things I really enjoyed, but would be intrigued to try more.",T5KBc5QbwZ-Oj9ApE4vZJA,2,1,4,Ninr6a7JA2tgPoJAlMrUrA

Steam Mussels - broth was good, but i literally counted about 8 tiny mussels.  Seeing that your normal pubs and bars will load you up with mussels and fries for about 10-12 bucks, you definitely don't get the bang for your buck here.

Garlic Chicken - Average, was a bit soggy and cold - had decent flavor

Lamb pops - cubes of lamb meat, not tender and a bit over cooked.

The lounge has nice furniture and a cool vibe.

My mom ordered the Sushi Combo ($12) off the Lunch Specials Menu. It comes with a California Roll, three pieces of Nigiri, shrimp and vegetable tempura, salad, and miso soup. Great deal! My mom doesn't eat raw fish, so I had the nigiri and it was good. I decided to get a couple tapas and a sushi roll, so I could get a good feel for the ""tapas"" theme.

Uni Pasta ($10): Spaghetti infused with uni and tobikko. The pasta was cooked well, but every other aspect of the dish was disappointing. It lacked flavor and besides the piece of uni sitting on top of the pasta, it seemed non-existent.

Saikyo Zuke ($9): Miso broiled black cod. This was really good! The fish was tender, perfectly flaky, and the miso sauce was delicious. Great execution.

Makapu'u Roll ($15): Sautéed rock shrimp with garlic, seared beef, fried onions, and spicy ponzu. Fun combination and light in flavor. The fried onions were blah and did nothing to add to this roll. Overall, it wasn't spectacular and costly.

All of the more tapas like dishes and sashimi we ordered was excellent. The wagyu sliders were juicy with a good accompanying sauce.  The fish tacos had a good batter with moist and flaky fish inside. The three orders of baked mussels we got were eaten in a matter of minutes. The salmon nigiri was buttery, and the yellowtail sashimi was some of the best tasting I have had at any Japanese or sushi restaurant. Pork belly that didn't just taste like a fatty piece of bacon. While these were just some of the highlights, there were other tasty dishes.

Now for the unfortunate subpar orders we got. All of the sushi rolls we got were unforgettable with not a lot of flavor. Tastes that were similar to a premade roll out of a grocery store.

I think they have Happy Hour nightly from 3-6 which includes half off ALL ROLLS and a couple other items that weren't really that noteworthy.. I thought it was really weird that the hostess podium is further into the restaurant so upon walking in you kind of don't know what to do.. Also they have a large middle table which would be great for large parties but would be pretty awkward for me if I got sat there next to/across from strangers.. 

We tried:

-miso soup- pretty standard.. their bowls are deeper than other places so more soup yay!
-ahi poke salad - fresh ahi and I liked the mixed greens.. didn't care much for the sweet dressing.. I will probably just ask for ponzu dressing next time..
-garlic chicken HH - same as 808 sushi.. sweet and deep fried.. mmm
-fish taco HH - ehhh was a bit bland
-Hookipa roll - basically a Tiger roll.. wasn't drenched in eel sauce so i liked it 
-uni tempura - at $10 i would rather just get it in sashimi or nigiri form... I love uni but this just didn't work for me..
-Chef Yoshi's roll - My FAVORITE thing of the night.. jalapeno, yuzu, cilantro, sirracha, yellow tail and shrimp tempura... I will probably be back JUST for this roll alone.. mmmm

a.  Location - Great location at the corner of Sahara and Fort Apache.  So many places to visit and to do in this super max of a strip mall.

b.  Ambiance - Interestingly narrow but pleasantly roomy.  There is one huge high level table in the center of the restaurant that can seat probably 16-18 people in total.  You share the area or can use it for a larger party!  Then there are about three doubles tables and then about 4 tables to seat 4.  A small sushi bar with some tables, but it is more of a prep / serving area vs. an entertaining sushi making area.

c.  The food - Came here with the kids and wife to try something new.  Just having tried some amazing traditional sushi the week before, i wanted to try some more creative dishes.

- Started with Shiro Miso - Nice light and good way to get the taste buds going.

- Tensai Hamachi Shooters - I liked the description and idea of having Hamachi Sashimi in a glass 

- Yellotwaill Jalapeño - Yellowtail sashimi with a bit of jalapeño on a cucumber

- Buta Hara - Pork belly

- Garlic Chicken - Lightly fried.

- Kahuna Chicken - Marinated and Grilled Chicken

- Uni Tempura - Sea Urchin Tempura style

- Tobiko Nigiri - Traditional Flying Fish Roe

- Unagi Sushi - Traditional Eel

- Amaebi - Raw Shrimp with the deep-fried heads.

Overall, I really have to say, the best dishes were......the Uni Tempura.  Light delicate, bursting with flavor, unique and very different.  Some tasted like Uni as you bit into it and it exploded in your mouth.  Others tasked like normal tempura.  I found that everything else was good, just not great.  We all know that good is the enemy of great and in order to be great. They are going to have to do something different.  overall, the Tensai Shooter was too overpowered by the sauce and the fish cut too thick.  The Yellowtail was also very thick while the jalapeño was perfectly thinly cut.  The But a was indifferent.  The Kahuna chicken tasted just fine, but could have been from any restaurant.  The garlic chicken was nice. But oddly was not hot.  When you fry chicken, usually the insides are moist and very hot.  The traditional nigiri sushi was pretty good, but the amount of rice used was about 50% more than necessary and did not have the sweet vinegar taste I was expecting.

d.  Service - This is five star and I would come back because the service is so AWESOME!

My general impression is that this is a fun and unique place.  Pleasant to come to frequently and try different unique things.  At same time, I was not in a food orgasmic frenzy of bursting flavors and excellent textures.

Great concept, great food, great place to eat, drink and socialize.  Been here twice (once on the grand opening and again right afterwards) and ate different things each time and each thing I ate was damn delicious.  The menu is extensive and has many choices for a wide variety of tastes.  Go and give it a try.

3 were outstanding,
1 was very decent,
and 1 was ABSOLUTELY LEGENDARY; one of the best rolls I've ever had anywhere.

I'd say that's a great record.
Did I mention these rolls were HALF OFF because of happy hour?  So the price was CHEAP, like $6 for the specialty rolls!

I highly recommend the roll with steak on it.
I highly recommend the roll with garlic ahi.
And I highly, HIGHLY recommend the baked snow-crab roll with cream cheese:  Heaven!  

 Giant Saporos were also $4 during happy hour.
The service was excellent.  Our food came insanely fast.  The waitress was attentive and friendly.

food: 4 - the food was high quality and pretty cheap for a ton of dishes, but I have to give it a four because the taste was alright. Everything was cooked fresh and to order.

Since I was in the Summerlin area, I decided to stop by 808 tapas and give them a whirl.

I was greeted by a nice host everyone greeted me hello and service with a smile. Since I was full I didn't get to order that much, because my main purpose was to try a roll and dessert.

I regret going to 808 tapas full because damn! Their 808 special roll was really good. It was amazing and to die for. Their sushi was really fresh great temperature, texture was good, you can tell everything was fresh, and the sauce was really good. I give it a thumbs up!

For dessert I decided to try the 808 fritter, which was also bomb digity. 
There was nothing negative about this place. I really enjoyed it. The staff is great I spoke to the Sous Chef, and he told me how they do not even use imitation crab, they use the real thing and all the fish they use in the sushi are the high quality fish, different then the all you can eat sushi.

I am really excited to go back. Their happy hour starts at 3:00 I wouldn't mind trying that as well. I will make sure to come with an empty stomach, so I can order more rolls.

Try now! You will not regret it. I just wish they had one in the Green Valley area.. But It's ok it's worth the trip for me.",r2R9t9_0Je8wP-wh4-xM3w,11,9,4,3BZme9bxdK1f3x0Sa9Z9RQ

$4 for a huge Sapporo - Yayyy!

Pork belly literally melted in my mouth.  Only bad part was that I couldn't pee for the rest of the day since it was so salty.  Mussels had a zing I had never seen in other mussels.  Fish tacos, very different Mexican style fish tacos in the best way.  Garlic chicken was super unexpected.  Not too garlic-y in the slightest, tender, probably calorie ridden - but that's completely ok.  Nasu fries were a simple treat to accompany the rest of the vibrant flavors.  The Lanikai - yumm... should've ordered another.

We tried quite a bit of food while we were here :

Sashimi 5 pieces:  We tried the Ahi, Sake, and Hamachi.  Surprisingly good quality here!  Buttery smooth and tasty....yum!  This was the highlight for me personally...maybe I'll do a sushi bar night one of these days.

Tensai Hamachi Shooters: Hamachi, Ponzu Sauce, White Truffle Oil, Jalapeno and Roe. Loved these! A little bit of everything...sweet, salty, spicy and fragrance with the Truffle Oil!  A little addictive, but we managed to keep it to one a piece lol.

808 Tapas Sliders: Wagyu Beef, Marinated Shiitake Mushrooms, Hawaiian Ginger Wasabi Mayo and Fried Taro Chips. These were pretty juicy and yummy!  The portion here is good filler too...share your other slider to save room for the rest.

Garlic Chicken: Lightly Breaded Chicken Skin, juicy insides, flavorful with a hint of Garlic. Pretty good!  

Uni Tempura: Uni wrapped in Shiso, Deep Fried in Tempura Batter with Spicy Mayo, Grape Tomatoes and Salmon Roe. These weren't bad...only a hint of uni taste though. I think the batter hides the flavor.

Makapuu Roll: Seared Beef, Soft Shell Crab, Fried Onions and Spicy Ponzu. Not bad..not a big fan of rolls or beef in those rolls, so you might like it.

Pork Belly Skewers: Pretty sure these were not fully cooked! The meat/fat ratio was off as well, and it was a bit chewy vs melt in your mouth Pork Belly. Skip these. 

Atmosphere is good, clean, and service is friendly.  It was almost empty when we came here, so that's one reason I was so surprised of the fish quality.

So some hit and misses but overall pretty good.  They seem like they have deals going on from time to time, so time it right and head over!

Yes lots of rolls are or has deep fried tempura or deep fried crab, but a lot of other sushi places I have been too has similiar type of sushi rolls.. Best deal with a groupon, which cannot be used for happy hours, but FYI happy hour menu is slightly different...

Service: AMAZING. They're not your typical waiters/waitresses/chefs and etc. For one, they talk to you like you're a human being and not like someone they want money from. I've never met anyone unfriendly at this location or 808 Sushi. Two, they remember you! It's like going over to a friend's house for dinner and catching up on gossip or something. Three, free food. Not saying that they give this out freely, but half the menu I salivate over is because they've offered me a free sample to get me hooked.

5319028,2013-08-01,2,Yiw2jUJzUdFmglHZgj4RaQ,"After a day of shopping, I was starving and I wanted a variety of small bites but wasn't really feeling Spanish tapas so, we ended up here.  There were plenty of tables available last night.  You can sit at the bar, tables for 2, tables for 4-6 or the high community table.  We chose the community table even though it was just me and my friend.  Since the friend had a heavy lunch, we got a Makapuu Roll, Uni Tempura, Tensai Hamachi Shooters, 5 pc Sashimi, 808 Tapas Sliders, Pork Belly Skewers and Garlic Chicken.

Tensai Hamachi Shooters: 
We got 2 shooters.  The hamachi was fresh in a tangy ponzu sauce with white truffle oil and a thin slice of jalapeno and roe on top.  Excellent layers of flavor and texture. 5/5

5pc Sashimi:
You can choose from tuna, yellowtail, halibut, octopus and super white.  We got tuna, salmon and yellowtail.  Very fresh fish in generous cuts. 5/5

808 Tapas Sliders:
2 sliders of Wagyu beef with marinated shiitake mushrooms and Hawaiian ginger wasabi mayo served with a side of fried taro chips.  They were alright.  I was expecting more wasabi flavor to shine through but it didn't happen. If you've tried a burger from Jollibee, you've pretty much tried these sliders. 3/5

Uni Tempura:
3 pieces of Uni wrapped in shiso in dipped in tempura batter then deep-fried, drizzled with spicy mayo and topped with orange caviar.  Comes with deep fried grape tomatoes. I like uni but I can't figure out if it was right to deep-fry it.  It was tempura with just a hint of uni...it was still good. 4/5

Makapuu Roll:
The menu says sauteed rock shrimp with garlic, seared USDA beef, fried onions and spicy ponzu. But they changed it.  It now has soft shell crab and a different smokey tasting sauce instead of the rock shrimp and ponzu.  4/5

Garlic Chicken:
This was an afterthought but ended up being one of the highlights of the meal.  The chicken skin was lightly breaded.  The meat was tender and juicy but fully-cooked. Fried to perfection and has good flavor.  Slightly sweet but the garlic taste was faint though.  Think milder version of BonChon chicken. 5/5

Pork Belly Skewers:
Another afterthought but this one we probably should've skipped. I don't like the idea of a light-colored pork dish on a skewer.  It lacked color and flavor.  They  could've rendered this a bit more. 1/5

The service was good.  It was Wine Wednesday and glasses of wine are 50% off.  Sadly, they didn't have the ones I like so we didn't get to partake in the wonderful that is Wine Wednesday...we ended up at a liquor store nearby.",tH0uKD-vNwMoEc3Xk3Cbdg,10,2,4,9WDvnnWwfMHZLI07BpQWIw

* Spicy garlic edamame - nothing fancy here, just edamame tossed in some spicy garlic chili sauce, but it worked
* agedashi tofu - probably not a standout dish, but I really like agedashi tofu in nearly any form
* tempura - we liked this one a lot; nice and flaky panko as opposed to the dense, almost batter like stuff you'll get most places these days
* fish tacos - again, a nice, flaky panko crust topped with a decent slaw, jalapeno slices, and a sprig of cilantro

Neither of us was feeling like a roll or nigiri at that point - definitely looks like fusion style with the sushi choices, with lots of modern flair.

  1. Lack of training on staff.
  2. Lack of inventory experiences.

The Ahi Tuna Poke was very good. (how can you screw that up really I mean anyone with a cable channel can make that)

The Wagu Beef Sliders (yea right) were served well done.  May as well have went to McDonald's for better quality beef.  (so bad....so pathetic) 

The fish tacos seemed frozen. When I asked where the fish was from I was given a species that doesn't exist. I then asked which water are they from - Pacific or Atlantic they asked ""what do you mean"" 

The Pork Belly and Garlic dish....(whew roll the dice fellas) You don't want to know.   Yeah you do - Imagine huge chunks of large asparagus with little tiny bits of what you hope is pork belly smothered in a brown garlic sauce.  bad really bad. 

THEN......They front of the house manager brought out the mop bucket and began to mop around our table. 

Employees like to laugh and carry on without regard to their surroundings.  Poorly managed and overall poor food.",tuzWTI-1psOsSsyFJLuthg,5,1,1,Yli5UVDfTWcTStt4sk_Yrw

I met fellow Yelper Mel C. here on Saturday night to get another bookmark done before the world ends this weekend.  First of all, Village Square is undergoing some renovation, which is a good thing, but a really bad thing if you want to park your car.  Half of the parking lot is shut down and the half that's open have the aisles that dead end, so you have to do a 3 point turn like Austin Powers in his golf cart or reverse all the way out like Chazz Palminteri in ""A Bronx Tale"" if you can't find an open space-if you don't know what this means, never mind.  The bottom line is that you should park far, far away and just walk if you don't think you can find a spot close to the shops.  
So, 6:00pm on Saturday night and 808 is not busy at all, which is good for us because we had great service at the bar with some friendly gents.  After starting with your standard miso soup to warm up, Mel and I shared the Wagyu Sliders (one each). I also ordered a Honolua Roll as well as a Crab Stack for myself while Mel had his own food because we don't like to share that much.  Actually, we each have food allergies that prevent us from eating the same things, but it was fine; neither of us needed Benadryl that night.  The Honolua Roll is basically a shrimp tempura roll with cream cheese, something you can find at most sushi places.  The Crab Stack, though, is something that I can't recall ever having anywhere, a light and refreshing concoction of mango, crab meat, cucumbers, tomatoes, and bean sprouts that I loved--I would return just for that dish.  I really wanted dessert, but I was freezing so the apple fritter with ice cream will just have to wait until we come again.",7Oe6ikklTjVBbEFw9emLcA,2,4,4,hdwduZeEsFy8TBNnbRI4Xw
5670671,2014-05-18,0,Yiw2jUJzUdFmglHZgj4RaQ,"After reading these reviews, I was a little hesitant to try it out.  However, I was very pleased and will return.  I was there on a Saturday night.   My date and I ordered 6 diffferent items.  All arrived hot and very delicious.  The wait staff could not have been more attentive and helpful.  When we were finished, I asked the server why the bad reviews--she shared they had just opened, were slammed with less than adequate wait staff, and were still working out the bugs--so to speak (no bugs here--lol).  Anyway, the food was really terrific, the varied dishes ample size, and I am certain to please the most difficult of palates.  The place is small, ambience negligible.

Good food, great happy hour prices (before 6), nice and pleasing wait staff--I will return for my birthday with 10 guests--just too good to pass up.  Check it out--I found a new ""go to"" place for my sushi and tapas cravings!!!",rQ_yhq4Cc8_IvJ9tt-gcxA,0,0,5,vjcvFe5Qug6nyZHpUoU3-A

Dishes that fell short are kahana chicken, chicken katsu, hamachi Kama and baked mussles.  The green tea ice cream was a nice presentation in a fried crusted shell w/chocolate syrup and whipped cream.  It was delicious even if non- tradional.

5734928,2012-09-05,0,Yiw2jUJzUdFmglHZgj4RaQ,"Tried this for the first time with a friend. Tapas are typically kind of pricey for my liking and this place is the same. So, you won't really be full but you'll sure be spending a lot.

However, aside from the pricing, the staff is super friendly and nice. I like the place overall and I wasn't disappointed with the few dishes that we did get. I LOVED the spicy tuna cracked. I definitely want that again.

My friend and I go got the salmon carpacchio, beef tataki, hamachu tensai shooter, and the yellowtail jalopeno. They were decent enough but for me, I loved the spicy tuna cracker. The wasabi part of it was a nice touch. And I just ADORE spicy tuna so that's a double plus.

We received a random 30% off so I was pretty grateful for that. It might be cause they're a new place but I don't know. That was a nice surprise.",7weuSPSSqYLUFga6IYP4pg,4,1,4,BDHKeWvmaxGFzJAqExt6tg
5765449,2014-04-08,2,Yiw2jUJzUdFmglHZgj4RaQ,"It's a small restaurant right next to the movie theaters, bar seating and little tables for couples, and one large table in the middle for party sized groups. 

I'm not a big sushi fan (I'm super picky) but the 808 Special was simply delicious. It's got crab meat and an unagi sauce and a little crunch to it that was perfect. I also had the miso soup with clams and loved it, much better than most miso soups I've had at Japanese restaurants. Best part was dessert; tempura friend green ice cream drizzled with chocolate sauce. 

Prices were good, but we had a Restaurant.com gift certificate and it was very confusing trying to figure out how to use it. Turns out you can only use a $15 certificate per meal, but you have to spend over $22.50 to use it. The service wasn't bad but the servers definitely didn't seem like they were loving their jobs. I honestly felt a little rushed, like they just wanted us to eat and get out of there, even though it was Friday night and the place wasn't packed. 

So aside from gift certificate issues and some lackluster service, the food is great. I definitely recommend the food and am completely in love with that tempura green tea ice cream!",jnO_038DjWXknuDVVNPSKQ,4,3,4,ooOUAX6sWX3l-nSBtnKsiw
5796220,2014-02-10,0,Yiw2jUJzUdFmglHZgj4RaQ,"I went here with the high hopes that it will be my new favorite place since there are great positive reviews about it.. sadly, my hopes were all shattered :(

Service: if I could give a negative star, I would.. we were seated right away at the bar.. but then, it has been 10 minutes at least, and no one had taken the initiative to give us a menu or offer a drink.. my boyfriend end up getting a menu himself up front. After that, still nothing. So I asked the chef on the bar ( I think hes the owner too) if we should be ordering from him. He said ""no, its not my job, I'm not a waitress"" .. I was shock! I work in a hospitality field too and its one of my pet peeve.. to hear someone say its not my job -- most especially if he indeed is the owner.. its a sad culture he's promoting among his colleagues.. the service until the end is terrible

Food: 
*crab stack - is ok. Nothing special about it
*salmon carpaccio - ok. The fish is really fresh thoug
* yellow tail jalapeno - ok. 
* poke salad - edible. I've had better ones
* garlic chicken - good! Flavorful and really tender inside but crispy on the outside
* fried Cali roll - ok
* green tea fried ice cream - ok
* food presentation is great!

I wish I could give this place more stars. It has a lot of potential for greatness but in my opinion, customer service is where the heart of every business is.. and this place is lacking that. Will I be back? Maybe maybe not.. but I will definitely not go out of my way to dine in here again.",hgQq9phnl21I6PtyIpL3Ig,5,1,2,GkFdp6YtDl0YYZQ4KIbKrg
5836402,2013-02-11,0,Yiw2jUJzUdFmglHZgj4RaQ,"Over hyped. With the groupon, happy hour doesn't apply, but even with the groupon there is no way to be full without spending an exorbitant amount of money for tiny portions. The sea urchin noodles were slathered in oil, the pork belly was good just by virtue of it being so fatty, and they need sauces or dips to make anything else taste good. If you're into the tiny tasters of 'exotic' food combinations and have the money to spend sampling it all, it might be fun, but if you want a real meal there are plenty of other choices around the area.",SgcNTpx_ASfvyQHmLU443A,0,0,2,HIH-ZfyKADf-RPwgNvBCJw

5918565,2013-04-25,2,Yiw2jUJzUdFmglHZgj4RaQ,"On this Wednesday evening when I went to finally check out 808 Tapas, the restaurant was not at all busy.  Just a sociable lady at the sushi bar chatting with the chef, and four other tables of twos, and me (but I easily ordered enough for two) at the sushi bar (better lighting condition for pictures).

The restaurant itself is simply arranged (a really long table in the center of the room for seating a large party or multiple groups, smaller tables along the walls, and seating at the sushi counter) and decorated. The layout gave it a sense of more space than it physically occupied.

There is a happy hour from 3-6pm, which I was too late for. But with 50% off rolls and other items, it is definitely worth checking out.

These are the items I ordered to get a sense of their menu offerings:

Tensai Hamachi Shooter - $3 for one serving presented in a shoot glass. It was decent.

Yellowtail Jalapeno - Good. This is such a classic fusion dish that I don't think anyone can mess it up, as long as quality fresh ingredients are used in its preparation.

Uni Pasta - I love uni, but thought the flavor of the pasta was a little bland or not enough uni flavor.  Portion is good.

Saikyo-Zuke (Black Cod marinated for 48 hours in miso and broiled to perfection). Again a very traditional item, and has good flavor, just needed a little more time under the broiler or in the oven to cook the cod more and caramelize the miso.

Screaming Da Kine - Seared Tuna engulfed in yum-yum garlic ponzu sauce. This is pretty much a contemporary interpretation of the Screaming Orgasm Salad invented by the former head Osaka sushi chef that has already retired. The fish was fresh, but was covered in too much sauce, but others might like it enough to drink.

Poke Nacho - Ahi Tuna on top of Crispy Lotus Root Chips.  It was good, but slightly too salty for my pallet. But I bet the poke is just right with a side order of steamed rice.

Mentaiko Bacon Skewer - Mentaiko (Cod Roe) spread on Shiso Leaf and Scallions wrapped in Bacon.  Recommended. If you are the DIY-type, this is how you build it  from the inside out are green scallion, mentaiko spread on shiso leaf, and finally wrapped in bacon.

Food:  3.5/5  Some good items worth coming back for, while others need better execution in the hot kitchen or minor tweaks to the flavor profile/balance.

Price/Value:  3/5  Average for this type of restaurants.

Service: 4/5  Friendly, efficient, no complaints.

Ambiance:  4/5  

Parking:  4/5  Plenty, except when there is a good turnout for the theater in the same strip mall.

3.5 stars (rounding up to 4 stars)",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,8,7,4,rZeSsKVkgJJbGu0k2ZF6DA
