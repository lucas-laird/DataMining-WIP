My lunch started at 12:00pm I arrived at this location at 12:05pm I've been sitting inside my truck at the drive through for 20 minutes it is now 12:25pm this is the slowest most pathetic service I've ever encountered. I then decided to leave the drive thru park my truck go inside to find five people waiting in line and only one person making sandwiches what a joke I'll never go there again",YbYP_QlpcJq7HRitsMruqQ,0,0,1,lRXxD6Gpjrmg-8TsIoz3xA

We were intrigued by the drive-thru option and figured we would give it a try. Big mistake! As soon as we pulled up to the menu, a girl's voice came over the loudspeaker and informed us that she would be right with us. After about 5 minutes of waiting, a guy's voice came on and said we would be helped shortly. After 5 more minutes of sitting outside waiting to order, we were done. We pulled out and left. We went down the street to a different Subway (there are like 3-4 more in the immediate area) and were in and out quickly. We will not be returning to this one.",ovGcSqLo0rqYMgnM6ejfVQ,0,0,1,zRwRkJNcjjbM255BrqCW9A

3382790,2012-06-02,0,u54Hx0VmPRzOtwvBShonSA,"This is an odd Subway, gas station combo.  The two businesses run separately, which makes it confusing when you want to make purchases from both.  
The staff at the Subway counter is probably the friendliest and most attentive I've seen in any Subway (I'm a weekly customer to locations all over the country).  Food was spot on and as fresh as is expected from this brand.
I only wish that you could purchase convince store items with my Subway purchase.",0aFDZXy0vwnRSt1DmCjVeQ,0,0,3,fKQ2rWXslS6r5SVwLK64Hg

It is a small subway not regulation size and generally they only have one person working the counter. This of course is a hassle when there gets to be more than one person waiting in line. Overall it was good, can't go wrong with the Subway.",BzRgNA4tGWr3NN__U-xInA,1,1,4,tdjxcS2dzmkEv-wXzFcAlg

No worker that I've come across here has been friendly or helpful. Take my advice and go to a different location or even a different competitor!",gdoX9t2MDhAkBPW-ScJkRw,0,0,1,lbYTmp5pE78gUI2YDX-4xg
4333125,2014-07-03,0,u54Hx0VmPRzOtwvBShonSA,Open til 2am and they totally don't hold back with the goods. They were nice even tho it was past 1am which is awesome on their part since most people up this late aren't always in the best of moods. But I'm pretty happy with what was served. It doesn't take much to keep this girl satisfied! Lol,NnfwMOi3upl7aeuMd1P2ag,0,0,4,YU6OlhdJv92syU7fbN5W3Q
4720828,2017-08-23,0,u54Hx0VmPRzOtwvBShonSA,"Long story short, today was my final straw with this location even though it is closest to my work and has a convenient drive thru. I always place my order online so I can pick it up quickly and not once has it been quick in the year that I have been coming to this location. For example, today it took me 20 minutes and 2 times through the drive thru just to get my sandwich that was ready for pick up 10 minutes prior to my arrival. I have even tried going inside when I have more time and the service is extremely slow. It has never been packed or even busy, they just disappear in the back and try to make up for it with extreme kindness and smiles EVERY TIME. Very frustrating when I give them the benefit of doubt for a whole year, and nothing ever changes except it gets worse.",YwTDE48MlQ_sbA0i6EgUaA,1,0,2,zCBDGy_EcpUYGImG_RMBKg
4926361,2014-06-26,1,u54Hx0VmPRzOtwvBShonSA,"This Subway has a drive-thru, which I thought AWESOME, until I opened up my sandwich at work. It was smashed, poorly put together, veggies everywhere, soggy. It was disgusting. I had been on a Subway streak for almost a week and this sandwich put that to a dead stop. I couldn't eat Subway for another month. Bottom line, you have to watch the person physically make your sandwich because otherwise you get something completely inedible.",LwVUO_5jjHuJRhvl6hlHVg,2,1,1,YG254K7xEJjViA9DWyBYNQ
5915686,2013-05-03,4,u54Hx0VmPRzOtwvBShonSA,"Once I learned that they do not open until 7am, then everything seemingly got better. I never found out who that girl was that told me to hold on, as I have never seen a girl working there. 

However, the key for success at this location is not going through the drive thru but instead of going inside the gas station and going to the counter.

Service has been good, steady and fast on my last few visits.",U0WU9d6gpMNkO_tPXK58Sg,5,5,3,gOdMatl0NplJhWAFXqSWpg
