Well, she ordered a couple of plain slices, and I got the ham stromboli, and let me tell you, this was the best Italian meal we have had, outside our house.  Not for nothing, but you know when the grease is dripping on the plate that it's fresh, and the gravy (sauce) has chunks of sliced garlic, it's just the right amount.

It's a cool spot to eat and people watch. They use good ingredients and the crust is crispy enough to hold the pizza without it flopping over. The slices are a good size. You can fold them or tear it in half. 

Bonanno's is good pizza in a fun location, but they are stuck on Strip prices. Bring the price down a bit and this place is a 9/10.",a80mZw7Bz3LoaBiHSg83HQ,0,0,3,XMmVXB2jMXO79A96ki9V-g
841324,2015-06-08,0,BMAflH82OUIMl2mHtP0MNQ,"Strolling through DTS looking for a joint I hadn't hit yet, and made the wrong choice picking Bonanno's.  It's just okay... nothing special. I feel a little ashamed for them that they bill themselves as an authentic Italian pizza. It's really not.

Flavors feel very ""corporate,"" if that makes sense. A real ""Sysco"" flavor to the sauce; on the tomato paste-y side, and greasy mozzarella that most 9-year olds won't complain about, but for adults, we should want more.  The crust has no real life or mouth feel to it; not a nice crispy-chewy feel like you'd want, but more of a baked, airy, crumble texture; and there's some oily/buttery-ness going on that shouldn't be happening.  The pizza oven is new, so not really seasoned or broken in, so no added flavor coming from that.  There's actually a cook timer on it too, which is disheartening. (Really?.. You can't cook a slice or a pie by look and feel?.. authentic)

Oh yeah, the price... $9.08 for a cheese slice and a tomato basil slice. For what the product is, it's overpriced. When I went back in for a water, (Aquafina) it was $3.18. Pass.

I guess it's okay in a pinch, and with not many, or any, other pizza joints in here, this will have to do. Again, it's not special, which for me, means it shouldn't be around. If you're going to spend the money opening a place in Downtown Summerlin, and bill yourselves ""as if,"" then be that. Do it right...

When you add a topping to it they charge $1.70 per slice. That's what one would normally charge for a topping on a large pizza. They charge it for five pepperoni slices.

The pizza wasn't great either. It was super greasy, which some people probably like, but I don't. The crust was excellent and it was cooked nicely but there wasn't enough cheese. Too much of the slices had red where there was no cheese at all. 

It was also annoying that there is no place to wash your hands, something needed after handling the greasy product, much less before eating. There are no bathrooms in the restaurant that I saw.",kFuqgoQCKs19a8-o2JvbYg,0,0,2,IMvvf55LuBldwUYig16iew

First of all this is not your thick breaded pizza, and puffed out crusts, please go somewhere else if that's what you want. 

I would also like to say that getting a whole pizza here is worth more of your buck than if you were to order a slice and drink. Go big or go home right? Just kidding! But getting a freshly baked pizza makes a total difference than the pizza already made for order.
The bread is thin, but just right that it holds all the gooey goodness of cheese and toppings on top. 
We ordered a supreme whole pizza, and there was a generous amount of cheese, pepperoni, mushrooms, and everything else. You have the option of having it cut in 8, 12, or 16 slices. 
Pizza took about 15-20 minutes to be made/baked.

I've been craving pizza from back home. I wanted a slice with a little grease on it, the cheese melted perfectly, a slightly sweet sauce and the crust cooked so perfectly, when you fold it, the bottom lip falls over. I wasn't expecting much. The pizza looked like it was out maybe 5-7 minutes and I generally don't like the way they reheat, but since it was quick, it came out quite delicious! I'd prefer a little sweeter sauce, but all in all, it was pretty good. I imagine a fresh pie would be even better. It was $3.45 for a plain slice, but it's Downtown Summerlin, so it's to be expected. They didn't have a take home menu, and they dont offer much else besides pizza. I'd suggest coming around lunch or dinnertime when the pizza should be kinda fresh. I will definitely be back here.",8OeTLey-p-WaL9ErNEci1Q,2,2,4,_Hf2qRkgnL5iJsNv7LoQPA

The actual interior of the shop was very crowded and small, and I could barely get to a table since they were so close together.

The garlic knots were super good! The tomato basil and red onion pizza was pretty flavorful, too! Overall it was a great deal and the staff was friendly. They even recommended us getting a full pizza instead of slices since it would be cheaper, which I thought was nice that they recommended. We ended up just doing the slices since they were already there.

Now, the restaurant side.  I've been 4 times, first time was when they first opened.  I will skip that tale.  Then I tried it again 6 months later.  A friend and myself were seated at the bar.  The bar had about four other people and this female bartender we had was awful.  She was busy chatting and helping the two men on our opposite corner.  We would've been better off serving ourselves.  We asked for every little thing, I mean everything- utensils, water a drink and yes. Even menus. She had no regard or knowledge of the menu, let alone manners. What she did have was an attitude.  My thoughts with any business is this: she was hired by them, hence that speaks volumes of the establishment.  It is a reflection on the business.  I was in Downtown Summerlin last night with the same friend and we dined elsewhere.  As we walked by as I snapped the picture we recalled that lack of a personality bartender.
