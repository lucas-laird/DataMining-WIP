I was extremely excited to try Paris Baguette. I unfortunately left disappointed. The staff was really nice and the design of the bakery is really cute, but when it came down to the food, they need to learn a thing or two.

Their bakery items are displayed in glass shelves and are self-serve. These items were all dry and hard! It may have to do with them leaving the baked goods in the shelves, but baked goods shouldn't dry out so quickly. The sweet desserts in the fridge all looked super good, but I decided to pass on trying them because they are all too expensive.

They have a variety of coffee, but their machines were not working so I'll have to go back to try their coffee.

Great location in the Chinatown Plaza with plenty of parking!",LTCxnnAQGaGZPHZx4KbvGA,15,3,3,4gwd1CJh2vfhkEUhKRGXJQ

While the food is pretty similar to other locations, everything in the case is cold or not as fresh as I am used to elsewhere. The pastries are decent for a quick to go snack. The cakes are amazing and definitely worth indulging sometimes. Drinks are decent as well although need some tweaking.

Everything is labeled with the calories and all of the ingredients. Overall it's much less sweet than traditional American style pastries. There are some pre-made salads options. Their specialty appears to be elaborate fruit topped cakes for a party.

It was my first PB experience. I might have been anticipating for this too much. I love Asian bakeries in general. And not having to go all the way to the strip (in Venetian) and stay within my comfort zone (Chinatown) was a plus.
The appearance of the store sure has promising Asian Bakery feel. Glass case full of familiar pastries, like red bean bun, croissants, and of course, baguettes in a basket, self-service trays and tongs.

They have plenty of room behind the cashier to work and walk around, yet they are scrambling in there; one trying to serve drink, the other trying to reach plates placed above espresso machine or one of the machines there, all while sandwich staff chatting and looking into the store through their cold case of sandwich ingredients. 

On to the food; I've tried Mocha cake, red bean bun, mini croissant, mini mochi donut.
They are nice, good tasting, but none of them exceeds anything you can get from other local bakeries in the area.

Eat-in area is not big, and unattended. So you might find a table, but most likely you'd have to brush off crumbs left by people before you, if you want to eat there.

I might go back again, later, just to see if there's anything I missed in my first visit. But, I'm good for a while.",Zk7XnX8tVvJncQKa-9298A,0,1,3,1MVaTzTXewLbYXiTjmFZ9A

It's a cafeteria style bakery where you pick up a tray and a tong, and pick out your desired pastries.

I guess that's what happens when you go late. It was ok though. Next to the cashier are a bunch of cake selection.

Located on the corner of Spring Mountain and Wynn. Plenty of parking and indoor seating. 

Decent prices and good fresh pastries and coffee just need better service. I usually just get a latte or get the mini croissants or popsicles. All the items I've got have been good. Fresh and flakey just right croissants, smooth tasty lattes, creamy popsicles. 

Service is just not that good though. I haven't been greeted when walking in but others coming in right after me were greeted in a different language. Lol. 
Never thanked or even get a while when I leave a tip. 
The first time I went they said the latte machine was down. I think they just cleaned it and were starting to shut down 30 minutes early. The manager was counting money at the cashier and didn't acknowledge me. He was just counting the minutes tell close. 

Little understaffed and not good teamwork. Stuff should be cleaned and refilled more. No trash can by the door which they had room for.

It sits in the main Chinatown plaza, which is really close to The Strip. It's easy to find and parking is never a problem. The establishment's interior space is pretty small. So during their busy times, the place can get squishy and there are not that many tables and chairs to begin with.

Once you enter, you will see a set of reusable trays and tongs for customers to use. This makes it hygienic and easier to hold several pastries at a time as you're picking and choosing from the open display cases. My family's faves are the cream puffs, croissants, and strawberry cakes. Their house coffee is pretty good too.

Customer service hasn't really been a problem, but there are times when some employees could offer better service and be more appreciative when it comes to tips. I've seen it so many times where a customer will hand a tip directly to a worker and nothing will be said by the employee that is receiving it. No thank you, eye contact, or even a smile. Not really good mannerisms. :[

I love the convenience of the location, the hours, and selection of menu items, but customer service can be a lil bit better. The interior space could use some planning as well. But if you're in the area, give this place a try!",EEAoUs1w38JHfHZMeSdqPQ,6,2,4,CnzfCYXOT1wd9Tj5coJQjQ

They try to emulate a french bakery with some Korean influence particularly with Red Bean and Mochi. For those from California, Paris Baguette is not a big deal as there are many locations particularly in Koreatowns in LA and SJ. However, I was excited to learn Vegas was getting one but then finding out it was in the Venetian.

Luckily, the bakery has opened a location in the Chinatown Mall Plaza near Ranch 99. They have fresh baked bread daily, a large selection of coffee and tea drinks, as well as cakes, macaroons, and ice cream selections.

Since Paris Baguette carries the same breads from store to store for the most part, I knew what to expect when going here. Every pastry I've had has met or exceeded my expectation of quality. It's notable that getting bread here early is better than late. The later in the day, the drier the bread may be.

I've had the raisin bread sliced loaf, blueberry cream pastry, several croissants, mochi donut and pastry, as well as a hashbrown pastry with ham and cheese in it. Everything was really delicious. Perhaps more importantly, their 'sweet' choices aren't overwhelmingly so.

I've also gotten to eat a couple of their cake slices, all of which were very moist and tasty. I'll definitely be a regular here particularly for the pastries.

The croissant was pretty standard. If it wasn't for that super delicious strawberry pudding, this review would have been 2 stars. 

The layout is pretty awful too. If there would be a line (thank goodness there wasn't when we visited), no matter what direction it went in, it would be blocking something. There's just no space.

Their pastries are pretty good; and most surprisingly -in a good way- very light. We tried the Chocolate Strawberry cake and the strawberry mousse, if I were to compare it to a genuine French pastry I would say it's ""industrial pastry"" quality, not artisan, but for being in Las Vegas, not in France, I give them a lot of credit. My only reservation is the price; at $4.75 a small piece, I find it a little pricey. Didn't try the savory items, I will definitely return.",XQ_nFlUasT_NYksIHDP-kA,3,3,4,s_MaRt18CbTkfHKE971M-Q

There are so many fresh pastries and baked goods to tickle your fancy.
The bacon & cheese melt wasnt bad and as I type this I nibble on their crab cakes.
The crab cakes are tasty at room temperature and I have a green onion to boot.. curbs the sweetness.
It's a small nook in the front of Chinatown plaza on Spring Mountain. It's always very clean and the food always looks so good you want everything.
I recommend this place for French goodies... Or what you would hope would be there. Polish sausage croissants to chocolate swirl, onion to berry, fruit tart s and cakes galore . Plenty of coffee options, and even a frozen section for looks to be amazing creamy goods...

Best part about this location is that there's free parking and it is easy to get to rather than trying to go to the one on the strip. 

Upon entering the bakery, we were greeted by friendly staff. They were very helpful in answering any questions we had. We were a little disappointed to find that this one is a much smaller bakery with very few baked goods of pastries and breads to choose from compared to other ones we've been to in Cali. They also make hot sandwiches and drinks (including smoothies, tea, and coffee). We decided to pick a few pastries to go including sweet potato bread, mango pastry, and two sausage croissants. Everything was delicious. We haven't had one bad baked good.

This is seriously the cutest little pastry shop that opened up in the Ranch 99 plaza right next door to the Chinese medicine shop (has all the roots/teas in that store). So I love croissants, and they have a great variety of different kinds. Some are stuffed with ham and cheese or a delicious sausage while others are dipped in chocolate or covered in some kind of yummy glaze topped with nuts. This place also carries the Japanese fluffy cheesecake!! I LOVE the crab stuffed potato croquet! It has such a generous amount of crab meat in it, sooo good. 2nd favorite has to be the croissant that has the sausage inside of it. It I love that there's breadcrumbs on top to give the croissant a little crunch in every bite and they drizzle ketchup and mustard on top! I actually like that idea since the croissant is so flakey you only need a little bit of sauce and that tang from the mustard can go along way. The sausage inside has a tiny kick but it's really savory and a little sweet. There's also this croissant like dessert that has strawberries and cream inside, it's wrapped in a spiral but it's flakey just like a croissant topped with more strawberries. Just enough sweetness and cream to satisfy your tastebuds, literally. The cream tastes fresh and it's def not oily unlike other places. I had other things too but those were my favorite so far. But honestly, everything was DELICIOUS. This place deserves some great recommendations when you want yummy little pastries.I deff want to go back and buy one of their fresh fruit cakes there.

Paris Baguette is based in South Korea with thousands of locations worldwide with a significant amount of locations in California. Initially many will confuse this establishment with an actual French Patisserie but it's more of a French inspired bakery with Asian influences. 

I personally like the items they offer. From the delicious Cheese Soufflé Cake and Soft Cheese and Strawberry Cake to the different flavor croissants and savory items. The staff is very friendly despite how busy they have been since they've opened on 12/23/18. Another cool aspect of their pastries is the various sizes allowing you to try more at a reasonable price point. They have a case full of custom cakes ready for purchase and usually decorated according to seasons. I will definitely be back for more, especially since it's located off the strip!

5349205,2018-04-08,1,LcbMEHpN5r45I4ZbyxhK0w,"Paris Baguette is a pretty huge chain, originating from Korea. They have dozens of bakeries in Seoul and they have a good amount in California as well. Their first location in Las Vegas was in Venetian and this is their second location in Vegas. 

I'm glad that they decided to open a second location! I honestly don't want to go to Venetian just for some bread. 

Their stores in Korea are bigger and have more variety. Its a little disappointing that the stores here don't have as much variety but they do have a decent amount. They have pastry items like croissants, mini garlic croissants, chocolate croissants, a large variety of donuts, bread with sausages, egg tarts, cronuts, and various other bread items. 

They have drinks, sandwiches, and cakes! There are some sandwiches where you can get them toasted as well. They have like three different popsicles, one type of ice cream sandwiches, and different fruity tarts. They have castella cakes too!

I really like their egg tarts. I like to heat it up in my toaster and have it as a snack! 

I also really like their selection of cakes. I've had the blueberry chiffon cake and their blueberry yogurt cake. Both were really delicious. They have whole cakes you can buy as well. But if you want to order one for a birthday or something, you will have to order at least three days ahead. When you order it, they an write a message on there for you.

I did like the items I choose but i had to knock two stars due to the service and inconsistency in quality of the pastries. Been here three times already and it was hit or miss. The staff is not too friendly and they don't really acknowledge any of the customers or offer help. The cashier also was kinda rude when telling us we had to re-insert our card payment. 

I wouldn't visit at night because it seems like most of the items have been sitting out for the day which resulted in kinda dry or oily products like the donuts and chocolate croissant which I did try. And they didn't really have anything in the cases even though it was about 6 hours til closing. 

I got the soft cheesecake which was in the cold case and decided I wanted to sit and eat it here. When I went to cut into it it was still frozen and I couldn't take a bite. I wish the staff at least warned me about that. Once I let it sit out for a bit at home it was delicious but I was still disappointed that I had to wait for it to defrost.

The cheese danish is probably one of the best I've had and would most likely come back for that whenever I'm in the area.",P19z16iz5I9Hh4T99pY8Sg,0,0,3,gj214GAJIWZVsEC2jfVvtg

I brought it back this morning to show them and to see if they could give her a new one so that maybe she can enjoy one. 
The lady that worked at the front said she needed to talk to the baker and show him. 
She then comes back in 5 minutes and said there was nothing they could do since it was yesterday, I told her we were at work and couldn't leave work just to take back a croissant. She still insisted ""Sorry, this was meant to be eaten fresh and during the day"". I was like ""it had a funny taste, she didn't want to eat it and get sick"". 

I really can't believe they couldn't replace a $1.85 croissant? It wasn't like I was asking for cash back or asking to replace a dozen Just another replacement croissant. SMH. There's no personal touch or any type of customer service! I thought for a quick minute to just buy another one for my coworker but fuck that!
