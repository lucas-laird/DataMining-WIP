50741,2016-11-05,0,IsVtFDJgNzBdTce2xSOmwQ,This subway is open 24 hours. The bread was fresh and they honor national specials. Even with fresh bread the sandwich wasnt all that great (got the turkey breast). There was only 3 slices of meat which I think is less than a typical subway 6 inch.,wVlxyo2svPkrbd09ESjsdg,0,0,3,QX5n5Fwr3CGbCciSXhsLXA
390057,2015-04-17,1,IsVtFDJgNzBdTce2xSOmwQ,"The good: Flat bread was amazingly fresh and did not taste like emulsified cardboard flour paste. A rare find at Subways lately.

The not so good: No BBQ sauce and some of the veggies were starting to turn. Fuze tea had a time stamp sticker from 6:20AM at 8PM. As someone who has had food poisoning from the Fuze tea's several times I always check now. They are supposed to be dumped, cleaned, and freshly brewed every six hours from what I have been told. Staff was friendly but could use some basic POS re-training.

Also, several of the ceiling tiles were open which is a health code violation.",VnzsLhbZX2P87Nx795mtLQ,0,0,3,L-kdOlAveFpu2CCW_Kpi2Q

No matter how busy it got they still engaged with their customers . Employees had good communication with each other as well,pXAHCXDTPRtd-cBG9nxrsw,0,0,4,6X1dgg8l66_elNTgvo9dHQ

Slow service on a non busy day and he spoke so softly I could barely hear him. I didn't think it was really possible to have a bad experience at subway but this guy pulled it off.,QCXBBkDaAKhU_nayO3DABw,1,0,2,vy30bp_ZqIwzi-RiX2tFiw

2017320,2014-06-23,0,IsVtFDJgNzBdTce2xSOmwQ,"This places sucks, worst subway I've ever been too. came here twice & they screwed up my order both times. Management needs to really work on this location because I will never come back here & I'm telling my friends & family about this horrible place too. What kind of subway has one person charging you, distracting you from telling the other worker what you want on your sandwich and the person who is making your sandwich wraps it up with out asking you if you are done with adding stuff to your sub?",1Dg2_2jBwuDadN272t_CBA,0,0,1,Zmkjo_XExOMcapB33BgFhQ

2784336,2015-08-15,2,IsVtFDJgNzBdTce2xSOmwQ,"I love subway but not this one. Normally I wouldn't write a review on subway but I think this location is the worst. Customer service is seriously lacking. So bad since this is in my neighborhood. 

Every time I walk into a subway I get welcomed ""hi welcome to subway"" either once I step in or walk up to the counter. Which is good customer service.  This didn't happen. 

First off there were three girls working. Not one could say hi??? Ok what ever, how about how can I help you? Nope! I walk up and I get the girl who hates her life with the ponytail on the very top of her head which btw her hair is so long it still goes past her shoulders and no hair net!!! Seriously I don't want your hair in my food!!! So I walk up and get ""are you ready?"" With an attitude too! Everything she asked was in a I hate my job why are you bugging me kind of way. 

So I got my food and sit down, no napkin.  I look around no one had a napkin. So are napkins and friendly service too much to ask for here??? Oh and a receipt please!!! So I'm still sitting here because I am kinda shocked.",KMddoqBFJ2h9AYbaetprFg,2,0,1,D9SLTSkHkmHkuaxhFJRECQ

Greeted by a really nice employee.. was super generous with the veggies, and though we ordered two separate 6in sandwiches (it was the same sandwich, just different bread), was charged as only as one footlong.

3823050,2017-11-01,0,IsVtFDJgNzBdTce2xSOmwQ,"I felt very ripped off.. I could see why some people have written concerning reviews about this place. 

I know this is a very busy area but when I walked in, I never got a greeting. Usually that doesn't bother me in a fast food setting because my expectations aren't that high in places like this. I know she was the only worker there to provide service, so I'm sure she had some confusion mixed up with my order and the pricing. 

I ordered the Spicy Italian and was charged for the Italian BMT instead.. I tried to explain to her that there was a mistake and I should've only paid $6.25 for my sandwich instead of $7.49 + tax.  I tried to explain my situation but she insisted on telling me to order the wrong sandwich as a meal which saves me a couple cents.. I ended up spending $8.11 on the meal

There was a language barrier and no one else there to help me explain my situation. No manager was around or other staff to support the busy traffic coming in. I felt hopeless but really hungry, so I just gave in to the argument and purchased the meal I didn't want and was charged wrongfully for a different item more expensive than my actual order. 

On top of trying to get her name, I did not see a badge on her uniform and was denied consent for it.",lUGiHH2La_BuHoBrR1aGlg,1,0,2,LTGnGiDanF48GEzEPKXMbg

Worst 8 dollar Mistake made in awhile. I'm deathly going to make sure I go to my regular Italian deli that has good ingredients, I feel kind of weird supporting Subway after the whole Jared thing anyways. It really is overpriced for the quality of food. $8 for a sub that has turkey, cheese and lettuce that doesn't even taste good unless your blitzed is expensive for fast food lol. The turkey tastes so gross I took a couple of bites out of the remaining half of my footling and can't take it anymore lol. I don't even want to give this turkey to my dog haha. I should of waited a couple hours for a deli to open because this was really really expensive for something really really gross lol. I think I could've had a better turkey sandwich for cheaper over at the airport at one of those little news stands that have sandwiches for sale lol",JTqq1_23RwkEg6sh6qp8RQ,0,0,1,eA-HAvZIe8AC0IEhZQNqcw

Not much of a wait, but it was quite busy in evening. 
I ordered the Black Forest Ham footlong with the works! Only $5.40. That's a great deal for the size and all the extras.
