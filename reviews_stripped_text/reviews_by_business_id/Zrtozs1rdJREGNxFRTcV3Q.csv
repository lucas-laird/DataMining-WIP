The boys behind the counter were infuriating, who in there right mind would represent there restaurant like this?! Took 30 minutes to cook our 3 burgers, and as we watched they're every move, there were over 10 health code violations. They used the same gloves to form burger patties, use the register and cash, get ice from the machine in the lobby, and cook our meal. Disgusting!!!!!! We weren't even greeted or looked at upon entering, and I had to ask if we could place an order. As we left they said in the most rude and condescending way ""sorry about the wait, but we hope you loved our clean shop!"" All 3 of our burgers went in the garbage after that comment, and  we will never come close to coming here again. Pathetic and a sorry excuse of a restaurant! If I didn't have to rate this place it would get -5 stars!",o1q2UIh1mCh2btDQ1APovg,13,5,1,3RXakZKjbKRBWdePoI7B5A
