Food served on a molcajete, a grinding tool made from volcanic rock, the same kind the Mayans and Aztecs used for thousands of years back can only prove the authenticity of the cookware and of the scheme. The mariachi band playing loud music, vendors coming in and out of the restaurant selling DVDs and CDs and other stuff can only prove the authenticity of the atmosphere.
  My eyes were fooled, my ears were convinced but  my taste buds, the toughest one of my senses, are the only one that can conclude authenticity.
 We started with an order of raw oysters, juicy and chewy with some tapatio and lime, paired with a michelada and I was instantly a fan. The molcajete mixto with steak chicken and shrimp, sizzling exploding like a volcano with south of the border flavors sealed the deal, it was real mexican food and this Mexican was happy! 
 I will definitely return if only for the raw oysters, everything here taste amazing and the service is equally awesome there's nothing here that doesn't scream authentic! ...except the little umbrellas that decorate the servings...those are made in China.

The prawn/octopus ceviche was perfect and incredibly fresh. For $5.50 it was such a great deal because there was a large portion. Their chef has a special way with pulpo, it was just so perfectly prepared and tender. Only thing it needed was more aquacate and we ordered that.

We also tried their famous molcajete with chicken and it is obvious they have a unique cooking method as this is breast meat yet so soft and moist even without any of their wonderful red chile sauce which is using similar chili's as used in enchilada chili puree. Overall it is a great dish and stays hot so long cause of the hot molcajete (be careful not to burn yourself).

 I would personally say the food is overpriced or more a $$$ than a $$ BUT it is DAMN good. There are some specials that would fit their price description but if you want an entree or anything seafood- you're gonna be looking at a hungry check later. 

Being a Latina I was raised having some very delicious food both inland and on the coastline, so If you are used to having some coastline food time in Mexico done right- THIS is your place!!

The environment is SO MUCH FUN. Next time I check in I will do the spot more justice so STAY TUNED!

But when I got there was afraid it was one of the decorated up Mexican joints that looked all spiffy with fancy decor and paint colors.  And then served you something that was just okay meh that left you feeling like it was almost good enough to go back but was lacking.  Wow, I let the waitress tell me what was her favorite... still not sure exactly what it was but ticket shows Camerones Chipo, waitress told me it was very very hot.  She came back 3 times to ask me 'Are you sure it is okay.'  Dam near licked the plate clean but thought that might show my lack of class when eating!!  Sopped up every drop of sauce with those killer tortillas they served!!!  Beans excellent, rice done just right, even chips and salsa (with lots of tomatillos and I normally don't like tomatillos) were great.  Then the waitress almost topped the main course, some cheese burrito that had been deep fried that rocked as well.  Left wanting to turn around and go in and reorder exactly the same thing!!!!  Now thats a meal when you want to hurt yourself by having an immediate repeat when you are already waddling out the door.  Last night it was an $80 prime rib, shrimp appetizer and tiramasu at supposedly one of the best steakhouses downtown that left that shoulda been good meh feeling.  Tonight it was $17.00 camerones and cheese burrito for desert that ROCKS.  Wish I was going to be here longer would go back again.  The only thing that I want different is for the chef not to tone down the heat for the white gringo, (loved the waitress she was so concerned she was going to hurt the lightweight).  Now that is taking care of the customer.  And it was spicy enough to know that it could be serious heat and still have awesome flavor.  Waitress promised if I come back it would be the real thing for the gringo.  Killer food, awesome service and would go back in a heartbeat.

Update: I live in Summerlin, this place is an epic drive yet I still find myself jumping on the freeway for my Ceviche fix. After a few unsuccessful local Mexican visits I've decided to just accept this place is the only place for me. When friends come in from Cali, there is where we go.

The service is 100%, the salsa and chips are delicious, the white fish in the ceviche is fresh, chunky, and seasoned absolutely perfectly. My kids love their burritos and quesadillas.

As for the vendors who walk by with a smile offering you their goods? Totally respectful, and not something at all that is annoying or inappropriate in this legit Mexican restaurant. 

If you want to pay 12 bucks for a single poorly made tostada or burrito go somewhere more glamorous. If you want real Mexican food, in a nice low key environment, that is super affordable? Head here.",SIf5rJUlAa73ZlDCtNWTcw,3,4,5,GvLUqho_CvVthO3t4Pl2Fw

Being of Mexican decent, I grew up eating Mexican food made by my mother who was a superb cook in her own right, so I have something to compare to. I rate a restaurant on the food, everything else is just filler. The neighborhood is older & mainly Mexican. This place is my favorite Mexican restaurant in all of the Las Vegas Valley. I have recommended it to all my friends.

One can order the signature dish of either chicken, beef, the combo which is chicken, beef, & shrimp,  or the seafood combo which has shrimp & octopus. In the same bowl you also get roasted peppers, nopales (cactus), lime wedge, radish (not turnips), a square of Queso cotija, a slice of tomato, slice of avocado & grilled mexican onions. Everything is covered in a superb red sauce. They all taste excellent and come served piping hot in the namesake Molecajeta, the stone vessel made of volcanic rock shaped like a bowl. You get more than enough tortillas to eat with. You can eat fajita style by putting the ingredients of choice in a tortilla or use the tortilla to eat straight out of the Molecajeta. There is an enormous amount of food for one to eat. In fact i've yet  to finish an entire meal in one seating. I always take some home for later. The staff is very friendly & helpful. The menu comes in English & Spanish for the Spanish challenged amongst us.  There are other choices on the menu beside the above mentioned. My son prefers the tacos, be it fish, carne asada, or carnitas. The have seafood also on the menu which is also excellent. They serve beer & soda. On weekends they have roving musicians that play mexican music for money. There are also vendors who can be annoying at times selling CD's, DVD's & various trinkets.

Complimentary chips and salsa was good. Salsa was thin in a good way and not overly tomato-y. Packed a great heat punch and was enhanced by a bright cilantro flavor.

The carne asada burrito was a big as my head and covered in a tangy, spicy green tomatillio sauce. The meat was well seasoned and tasty. Only thing I didn't care for was the beans and rice inside the burrito but I'll know next time to order it without (would no doubt result in a smaller burrito which I might then be able to finish).

Plate includes not only the usual lettuce garnish but also sliced radishes and a generous hunk of avocado.

Bright and cheerful inside. Parking is somewhat limited - I had no problem but I visited for a late lunch.

So when some of my Mexican friends invited me to dinner at Los Molcajetes on Eastern, I figured I would feast as if I was south of the border.  

When I walked in, I thought the ambience was decent.  Servers were friendly and the chips & salsa were really good.  I ordered a Corona and was disappointed that the beer wasn't that cold.  My friends ordered what they called Mexican Cola, which is basically Coke bottled in glass bottles in Mexico.  

They had several TV's on Hispanic channels that were blaring so loud we could hardly talk.  

We ordered an appetizer dish of mini tacos that were covered in shredded lettuce, sliced avocados, and piled high with Mexican cheese.  This was delicious!!!

I told the server that I wanted to order the dish that they were famous for and she recommended the Molcajetes, which I later learned was basically the bowl that it was served in.  For $7 it was a bargain.

The actual meal was okay.  A bowl that was filled with everything but the kitchen sink.  Beef, chicken, shrimp, grilled green onions, avocado, tomatoes... all drenched in a spicy sauce.  It was okay.  Perhaps more suitable for sharing because it was huge.  For $17, not bad considering it would've fed 2+.  

During our meal, some guy started walking around with a stack of bootleg dvd's selling them for $5 each.  Odd.  Haha.  

As we finished our meal, a mariachi band asked each table if they wanted a song.  If you pay them, they stand around your table playing music so loud that you can't even hear yourself think.  

I felt that the restaurant was a real miss.  Nothing was special except for what they do for birthday celebrations.  They bring out a sombrero and put it on the birthday customer and sing to them.  They have a tambourine going and clap really loud.  At the end of the song, the guys in the kitchen scream and blow on that loud, obnoxious vuvuzela horn that they blow at soccer games.  

I won't be back.  They seem to do very well so don't let my review keep you from trying it for yourself.  It's worth trying at least once.",sjZ3ScfAJ2bjDVI6MmSNGA,2,0,2,Z-NcT4D_E7Q3sXTwHi09Lg

I wouldn't order the carne asada taco again, not because of the size, but the flavor wasn't there for me. Same with my tostada, it was tasty not the best I've had but it did the trick.

Not the worst but honestly couldn't really ask my waitress for salt because there was loud mariachi playing non-stop. I love music and all but it became irritating, I couldn't hear what anybody at my table was saying. If your trying to go somewhere quiet on Sunday this isn't the spot!  Lol

Lindo Michoacan, Faustos, and Agave can't compare because they don't have the Molcajete. From what I understand, Molcajete means volcano in Spanish. This restaurant's signature dish, ""the Molcajete,"" is served in a black, heavy volcanic rock that looks like the mortar, as in a mortar and pestle (that you pound herbs with). The rock keeps the meat moist and it's decorated with tasty fillings for a fajita. My favorite amongst the fillings is the roasted cactus which looks like a green pepper. They also serve this with big chunks of Mexican cheese--the white, crumbly stuff.

I always order the chicken molcajete without the red sauce because I'm prone to heartburn. One order provides two meals, easy. 

Molcajetes is kid friendly. There's a jukebox loaded with Spanish music that bumps pretty loudly at night. Do not buy the DVDs from the kids that offer them out of their book bags.",6Y-l3x4LpUNhTBVMTFmTmA,6,5,5,AiV8Qo73R09Eroj5LNJ74g

My wife had the molcajete res. it was very big, and yummy.




I don't get why people on here complain that a Mexican restaurant is like a Mexican restaurant. It's not Taco Bell. The sign says authentico , so expect loud music, especially if there are mariachis that night. There were none on my visit.

To the complaints about not taking credit cards, there are old looking visa/MasterCard stickers on the doors. I used my card. I am not sure what the deal with that is.",eqsXfJbC_Iq7E7412Wa0AA,0,0,5,oE70tpPtN4N-Hup3yiaQ5A

Was turned on to Los Mocajetes by a friend.  It's a quick drive from my work so it turns out to be my go to spot for a nice lunch.

Spanish and English menu, pretty straight forward.  They don't try to flood their offerings with BS filler items, they go straight to their featured item as the first thing listed.

The Molcajetes (volcanic pot) is basically a mexican mixed grill served in a warmed pot.  You get a protein along with some roasted tomato sauce, some veggies, edible cactus stripes, and some mexican cheese.  Your protein can be chicken, beef, shrimp, octopus, pork rib.  My wife loves the Shrimp and Octopus Molcajete, the Beef is what does it for me.

Well,   they have live mariachi on Saturdays from 3-5. Goodness. Now as it is I am kind of a grump when it comes to live music in restaurants, and oh my god the place is sooo small and they were using microphones. It was so loud. But then again, I am a grump and sometimes act like an old fart. Everybody else was there to have a good time and not converse with their tablemates. So to each their own.

I didn't particularly like the food either. For the three of us we decided to share two molcajetes, one with beef and another with shrimp and beef. The dish is served with cactus, tomatoes and jalapeños all smothered in a sauce. For some reason, I thought the dish would be different. I had heard the dish was served with sauce, but some I thought like a chile, tomate y cebolla kind of sauce. Like literally, salsa. So the dish somewhat threw me off. It is a tomato-based sauce. It doesn't taste bad per se, but as I said I was expecting something else.

The service is great; our waitress was super nice and attentive and gets you your beers super fast.

4484316,2010-03-26,2,T5UBAJt5Kod_wQGbH6m9hA,"The other day my husband and I went for the second time to a place that my brother recommended called Los Molcajetes. This was our second time visiting this unassuming restaurant that is located on Eastern, a couple of miles north of the 95. The signature dishes are (not surprisingly) called 'los molcajetes', which is not so much a description of the food itself but the name of the vessel used to prepare and serve it, a Mexican mortar. Their use has been traced back to the Aztecs and Mayans who used them for crushing and grinding spices, but they are still common tools employed by Mexican cooks today. They function similarly to a cast iron skillet, becoming more seasoned with each use and imparting the cumulative flavors into the food. They also keep the food bubbling so you can eat at a leisurely pace as you continue to enjoy the food in its optimum state, nice and hot.

This is the only place I've had food prepared in this way, so unfortunately I can't make any comparisons, but I can say that it is very good and certainly worth the trip to a less desirable part of town. We have tried two different options, one with beef and one with chicken. The meat in both is of relatively high quality, but I agree with my brother's preference for the chicken ($12.99). The base of the dish is a flavorful and intensely colored red sauce that is laden with paprika (a little too much, perhaps), and is filled with your choice of meat or seafood as well as various other vegetable garnishes. These garnishes include nopales, or cactus (looks like a tongue coming out on the left hand side of the bowl pictured above), tomato, avocado, radishes, scallions, and a grilled jalapeno (watch out). There is also a wedge of lime, a cheese best described as Mexican feta, and a mini drink umbrella, which adds a whimsical touch. The chicken is roasted to tender perfection (see below), and tastes amazing on a warm flour tortilla. The broth has the right amount of heat, and is full of flavor, but Ian and I both agree that the meal could benefit from a few added elements. I liked the cheese, but it was fairly salty and dense for an already well-seasoned base. I think some crema, or Mexican sour cream, would have been the perfect antidote for the inherent flavors of the dish, and some rice, beans, and/or guacamole could have added to the texture. The meal was unique and tasted great, don't get me wrong, but got a tad boring to eat towards the end and need a little something to push it into the arena of ""oh my god I have to come back and get this tomorrow."" I noticed that you can order the molcajetes fajita style, however, so maybe I will try that next time and see what it comes with. I'll miss the little umbrella, but I've endured much more in the name of food.

Definitely try ""Los Molcajetes"" because it is a unique place in Vegas, the food is really tasty, and the price is right. One dish easily serves two, and with the purchase of 'molcajetes' you also get a free drink. We opted for Modelo Especial, a light Mexican beer that I strongly recommend (pictured below). For both of us the meal was less than $18 with two beers (we had to get an extra, of course), so it certainly fits the bill for the Frugal Foodie blog.

Tip: Los Molcajetes is open six days a week from 10 until 9, but closed on Wednesdays.",RiU99Ze8UEoUutHMl73HIg,6,2,3,3Nkmh8lKYeI4hJOZlU4Cpg

My Chili Verde was very good and ranks with best I've ever had. My wife's taco's were very flavorful and well stuffed. There are very few really good Mexican restaurants, places like you would find in Mexico. This place makes you feel like you are south of the border, authentic ambiance. But, the food is very, very good. The tortillas were home made and therefore very fresh and tasty. I could make a meal out of the tortilla's alone. The only criticism I can come up with is the salsa. It was a green salsa and a little sweet. It wasn't bad I would just prefer a high quality red  sauce. That is the only negative I can come up with. Don't hesitate to eat in this place.
OMG, let me change my review above. About two months later we went back. I had the ""Molcajete's Fajita's"" which were fajitas cooked in a molcajete. I thought they were named after the restaurant.

When they came they had a lot of beef and chicken but also semi-cooked green onions on top and a big chunk of cheese. I would never try this again. The others in our group had traditional Mexican dishes which were good. But, they had a mariachi band and they were loud! We measured them at ninety seven decibels!!!

We kept putting off our meal here due to things coming up, but finally I insisted that we eat here for Cinco de Mayo.  I arrived around 6, sat down and was immediately greeted by a server with chips, salsa, and a menu.  She started speaking to me in Spanish so I did my best to answer but then she alternated between Spanish and English with me the rest of the evening.  As a native Texan, I took Spanish from 1st through 11th grade but unfortunately am better at reading and writing it than speaking it, a travesty.  However, it was fun to practice.

I got a giant frozen strawberry margarita, which was rimmed with salt and something like Tajin (the fruit seasoning that is chile-limey), a water, and a tostada con ceviche de pulpo (Octopus tostada) while I waited for Eric R. to get there.  The ceviche tostada was huge for $5, and piled high with octopus, tomato, onion, cilantro, and a half avocado garnished the plate.  I sliced the avocado onto the tostada and enjoyed it crunching along.  I think I was there over an hour before Eric R. arrived, so I watched the mariachi band play at tables and had several visitors from hawkers (a child selling snacks, a man selling DVDs, a woman selling jewelry) but they left me alone when I did not show interest.

The server came and checked on me multiple times while I waited.  Eric R. finally showed up and got a frozen strawberry margarita too.  The server gave him a fresh basket of chips and we ordered the molcajete de combinacion (shrimp, beef and chicken).  It came with nopales (cactus), a tomato, radishes, queso fresco, a half avocado, 2 chiles, roasted scallions, and a side of tortillas (we ordered flour and got corn so we ended up with both)!  The molcajete was bubbling over when it arrived.  The tortillas were almost too hot to handle!  

We really enjoyed the meal, but the beef was quite tough.  The chicken was melt-in-your-mouth tender and the shrimp was fine.  I am not sure if the fajita molcajete would have different meat, so next time I would probably order a chicken molcajete.  The restaurant is also known for seafood and offers octopus, oysters, shrimp, fish, and scallop ceviche, tostadas, cocktails, and platters.

We also shared a unique creation served in and named after the 3-legged stone tool, molcajete, used in Mexico to grind chilies and spices.

You grab a forkful of anything or everything, place on a warm tortilla, fold and enjoy.  It proved be very tasty, but more than we could finish.",L8P5OWO1Jh4B2HLa1Fnbng,3,1,4,5FiTihv3-GuEcaEge5y8QA

We got sat almost immediately upon arrival and that was probably the best part of our experience. We sat and waited 35 minutes before alma took our order for the appetizer, 40 minutes to get the appetizer and almost another hour to put our food order in. Tables came in after us and left before us repeatedly. Long story short, service sucked and they get 1 star because the food was great. After I did NOT tip, waitress walked over to the front and told all her co workers and they all turned to stare, what they didn't know was how horrible she treated us.

Kids had carne asada tacos plain, no toppings at their request.  They wolfed them down.
I had two cheese enchiladas topped with their mole sauce.  It was very good.  Service was polite, sincere and prompt.  I would go back in a heatbeat.  After looking at the bill I was even more enthusiastic about this place.  Great job!

Three of us met for dinner (2 of us ordered the Molcajetes and the other ordered the fried fish).  The order came out and looked exactly as I remembered in Puerto Vallarta.  It comes in a steaming hot mortar (like a volcanic rock) and is enough for two.  I ordered the chicken and asked if they would also add shrimp (they were very accommodating), the BF ordered the combination (chicken, beef and shrimp) and our friend ordered the Fried Fish (which was a Whole Fish which he thought was delicious).   The Molcajetes were very authentic and very good.  The sauce had a deep, rich flavor that I am sure I will craving for weeks to come (thank God that I have leftovers today).  They also add Roasted Peppers, Limes, Avocados, Radishes, a couple Cactus Leaves, Grilled Green Onions, a small square of fresh cheese and FRESH tortillas for dipping (which is a must).

They do molcajetes here.  I guess the molcajetes is the cooking/serving vessel made from volcanic rock.  You have your choice of steak, chicken, shrimp and I think they had octopus.  It comes with cotija cheese, cactus leaves, onion, jalapeno, tomatoes and maybe a few other things.  The best part is the sauce.  It really ties the dish together.

I had the combo; steak, chicken and shrimp.  The steak was a little tough and not to flavorful.  I could have done with out that.  It didn't matter thought the sauce made up for it.  It was a big dish - big enough for 2.

The sauce really was that good.  It is like an enchilada sauce but with more flavors.  I think I tasted a hint of chipotle.  It was a-m-a-z-i-n-g.  It really was just a bunch of stuff in a heavy hot bowl... but the sauce... makes it MOLCAJATES!  That sauce was so good you could have dropped some cat turds in there and it would have been good!!!!!!!!

I really liked it.  It was different. It was NOT some half ass Mexican dish served with some rice and beans.

5924293,2013-01-05,11,T5UBAJt5Kod_wQGbH6m9hA,"This place is definitely worth the trip! Molcajetes are their specialty, and it shows. ""Molcajete"" is Mexican Spanish for mortar, as in mortar & pestle. These are quite a bit larger than your usual kitchen mortar and made of volcanic rock. If you order one, your food is cooked and served in the mortar, and the sauce is still bubbling like lava when it comes to your table.

The two of us couldn't decide exactly what we wanted in our shared molcajete (and damn, were we glad we shared one, they're enormous!), so we got the combination one that has beef, chicken, and shrimp, along with the usual lime wedge, cactus strips, radish slices, avocado slice, large slice of tomato, and amazing red sauce, served with either flour or corn tortillas (we chose corn; they were soft, white corn tortillas, and very tasty). That alone could have fed three people, so needless to say we didn't try anything else while we were there, save for the chips & salsa they give you in the beginning. That salsa was also super tasty!

We were completely entertained the whole time watching Univision on the few mounted flat-screen TVs. Well, one of them was playing all music videos, and the other two were tuned to Univision. During most of our stay, a telenovela was on. This might not be as amusing to those who don't speak or read Spanish, but then again, I think they're pretty entertaining regardless.

Previous reviews have noted that Los Molcajetes has separate English & Spanish menus and that they don't accept cards. Perhaps they've recently changed these things, because the menus we were given were bilingual, and there's a sign in Spanish in the back of the room that says they accept both credit and debit cards but charge $1 for the service.

I also saw at least one previous reviewer who noted feeling like ""idiot gringos"" or something to that effect because they stood around waiting for someone to assist them when they walked in. When we entered, there was a sign just inside the door that said ""Sientense donde gusten,"" which translates as ""Seat yourselves wherever you'd like,"" and that's what we did. So, gringos, if you see this sign, pretend it says ""Please seat yourselves"" and act accordingly. ;) Be aware that if you do so, however, the very friendly waitress may think you speak Spanish and start out speaking to you in Spanish when she comes to your table, like she did with us. Both of us do understand and speak decent Spanish, but the waitress quickly realized that our main language was English, so she accommodated. Don't be scurrred, is what I'm sayin'.

Yes, as mentioned by others, there are vendors (of CDs, beaded jewelry, etc.) and musicians who wander in & out of the place and will come by your table to see if you're interested in what they're selling. A simple ""no thank you"" and a smile is enough to get them to quietly move on; no one tried to hard-sell us or was particularly bothersome. I've noticed several (probably American) reviewers remark about this aspect of the restaurant negatively, and some have even knocked a star or two off for it. This phenomenon of wandering vendors is actually quite commonplace in restaurants throughout Latin America in all but the fanciest of places, and anyone who's travelled around a bit likely knows this and won't be aggravated by it.",g1YLVOwquTJ5ILeWIwqW9Q,16,10,5,FNREsOmqhOsO8yB-nMaetg
