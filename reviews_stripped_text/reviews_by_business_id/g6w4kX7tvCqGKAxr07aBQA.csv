I did have a group of friends here very late one night and they were waiting for their food for an hour and no one was the least bit sympathetic or apologetic. They told the manager they'd been waiting an inordinate amount of time and were told ""what do you want me to do about it?"".

WRONG!

Granted, I'm probably one of the very few drunk idiots that would actually waltz into a restaurant at damn near 2am and order a plate of Asian-style duck. Really, who does that?! A grave mistake on my part, and a horror that I've been trying to forget.

The flavor of the duck was only so-so, and the bok choy was even less appealing. The only thing I actually liked about the dish was the plain white rice and the apricot sauce. If you're not a frequent connoisseur of the water fowl, a word to the wise: those little birds have more bones than you can shake a stick at! As I'm sure you can imagine, that spells frustration and near death for a drunk person, who is already far more likely to do something stupid like, oh...I dunno...CHOKE!

So, while the boyfriend enjoyed every last bit of a heaping serving of spaghetti and meatballs with garlic bread, yours truly was stuck dissecting a weird bird that didn't even taste that great. Just because you're drunk in the wee hours of the morning and desperate for food, don't try to be a cool kid like me and order some fancy sounding dish that will leave you unsatisfied.

They had a modified menu at the time since they were missing ingredients or something. Ordered the roast beef sandwich which was basically generic roast beef on toast which was swimming in what tasted like canned gravy. The gravy was incredibly salty. There was so much of it the bread was practically falling apart as soon as I received my plate. 

Also tasted the American Club sandwich. Too salty as well. The only thing passable was the fries.

Ever since I saw their newly remodeld pool featured on the Travel Channel, I've been wanting to take a look.. maybe a dip.. I wanna go down the slide!! Plus being an avid Saltwater Reef Aquarium enthusiast, their Enormous Shark Tank would be amusing itself.... I don't wanna get carried away so back to the food: I did a quick search on the net and of course on Yelp to see if this place offered anything appetizing. Interestingly, I stumbled on a forum that had some high words in regards to their French Toast. Well, I will never turn away a great french toast (actually, thats what I used to order almost everytime I had the option for breakfast). So, Off I went:

* The Golden Nugget is one of the few or only Hotel/Casinos in Downtown that would blend in with the Mega Strip Hotels. Doesn't look or feel Old and has much more Life!

Lunch Time:

French Toast: 4 1/2 Slices of Thick Texas Toast with Vanilla and Cinnamon then sprinkled with powdered sugar. Came with 2 mini cups of maple syrup and a cup warmed butter. It was moist, not mushy, had just the right amount of Vanilla and Cinnamon, easy spreadable butter and medium thick maple syrup.. I'm not into those fancy/loaded types, a little twist is ok BUT here they prepared it Exactly how I like French Toast!!

BLT: and Mayo. I didn't think the French Toast would fill up the tank so I got this too (plus it sounded safe). Well, I'm glad I did. Much better than the standard BLT. Because it didn't come with a couple dried sticks of bacon. I opted for White toasted bread and It came with  Layers of some crunchy and some chewy Bacon and just enough lettuce, tomato and mayo. Nicely Executed! It came with Fries as well. The Fries were Perfect. Wide, Medium Thick, Barely Fried and Lightly seasoned with salt and crack black pepper. Another Jackpot Dish! And it wasn't through a Penny Machine!

Ambiance was Very Pleasing for a Cafe In Downtown. Service was Quick and Gratifying. Food ordered were Basic but Tasted Advanced. Only reason why I'm not giving them 5 Stars is because of Price.

We have eaten numerous times at the Carson Street Cafe (all the way back to when Steve Wynn still owned the place), and we have always enjoyed ourselves.  But today, it was just bad, and I give it 2 stars since I have experienced better at this cafe.

Instead of wining and dining at a ritzier spot like Vic & Anthony's (http://www.yelp.com/biz/vic-and-anthonys-steakhouse-las-vegas-2), I was likely here grabbing my breakfast, whether it was early in the morning or uber late at night.

There aren't many eateries at the Nugget, so Carson Street is by default the typical 24/7 diner-eqse spot for all to partake when they please. The older crowd tend to order the typical choices in these parts from soups to sandwiches, pastas to salads, and virtually anything on the simple scale. For me, it was almost always breakfast.

Truth be told, neither the food nor the establishment is all that exciting. Prices are a little lower here than any strip diner as it should be but the food is much less remarkable - bland and boring is the best way I can put it. At least with most of the breakfast options, they're likely to be fresher at least with eggs and hashbrowns + breakfast meat.

It was easy to order a simple platter consisting of scrambled eggs, sausage, bacon, and hash browns. For $7 it was better than I could find in NYC and cheaper than my other spots.

During our 9 -day stay in Las Vegas, we visited this café several times and the service at each visit was more disappointing than the last.  After four visits, we decided that it was not going to get any better.  It is clear that the staff here is unionized and they seem to take advantage of this security by not bothering to expend energy to be courteous or timely in their service.  The food is mediocre at best (think Denny's) yet overpriced and served begrudgingly.  Note: the coffee here is plentiful but acrid.  

One visit stands out: after being seated by a hostess who didn't bother to speak to us or even make eye contact, a person (bus person, assistant?) inquired as to whether we would like something to drink.  We ordered two coffees, two water and two large orange juices.  This person said to us ""I can get you water and coffee but orange juice must be ordered from your server...pleeeeease!"" It was obvious to both of us that we were being scolded for breaching an unknown and unspoken ""rule"" about orange juice.  Our server finally came and almost convinced us that he wasn't totally bored while taking our order (including orange juice).  The meal took 15 minutes to arrive, sans OJ.  Later the server brought the check, reviewing it as he placed it on the table, and asked ""Did you ever get your orange juice?""  We began to reiterate to him that we were told that only he could take that order but he abruptly walked away.  He did return with our OJ...just as we finished our meal.  We definitely could've lived without the OJ...and the attitude from the service staff.

The food is average eats.  Nothing on their menu jumps out at you or grabs your taste buds and makes you wanting to go back for seconds.

If you stay at The Golden Nugget you're more than likely will eat here at least once. We had the following and it wasn't bad:

The Club Sandwich - They pile on the bacon and it was not bad. Hard to mess up unless you skimp out on the turkey and bacon.

New York Steak and Eggs- I got my steak Medium Rare and it was cooked perfectly.  It's not Ruth Chris by any means but worth getting if you have a hankering for steak and eggs.  

Loco Moco-The gravy was yummy.  It definitely was good and is comparable to Aloha at the California Casino.  I know some people may disagree but since it's in the hotel I was staying at I'm a little bias. 

Prime Rib-It's only served between 5pm to 11pm daily and I would get it.  It was quite good and great price.  I would definitely order this again. 

Nachos-Plentiful and great appetizer to share. 

Chicken Tenders- for $9 it only comes with 3 pieces and 1 carrot and 1 celery stick.  It's good but not quite good enough for the price they're charging.

First of all, the lady that seated us seated us at a table with only one place mat and dirty silverware. I thought the mat was used as well, but every time she'd come she'd push the mat back over to my side. Eventually my boyfriend just moved the silverware to another table when no one was looking and we got new ones.

Our waitress was nice, but there was another waiter who kept loitering around our table, talking to the other staff and resting his hand on one of the chairs at our table. Kind of annoying.

As for the food, it was meh. I got spam, eggs and rice, and the rice was a bit dry and hard in some places. The eggs were also globbed, not really scrambled, and as for the spam well, you can't really mess up spam. My boyfriend had a BBQ burger and he said it was just ok. But overpriced. 

Also, my boyfriend found a sticker from a sterile needle package on the floor. Yeah...",yqqXloVogui4MgQYDeVNxA,0,0,2,iKO3WMzgLki8Z4W7WfaofQ

I dined here three times this past week only because there wasn't anything open past 10pm. The first night I had the pot roast which wasn't too bad, but after a while the aftertaste tasted funny. The service the first night was good, but the second night it was horrible. I think we had 3 different servers helping us which confused my party. There was a Mexican waiter taking our drinks and I swear it took him forever to take our orders. I don't know what he was doing but he was staring at his notepad with his pen in his hand. It was hilarious when he brought out our drinks 10 minutes later because he didn't even remember who's drink was whose. Horrible... my friends mom asked for some creamer for her coffee and he looked back and walked away. That night I had a burger with cheddar cheese which was okay at best. I can't complain since it's the only place opened with a decent burger. The third time I came here I had the Belgium waffles with strawberries. Surprisingly it was good because I finished it.

My family and friends were at the pool nearby, so we decided to grab a quick lunch here as they had to wash up and catch a show on the strip in a few hours.

It was about 1:30 on a Saturday and the place looked pretty empty, but our party of 10 had to wait for at least 10 minutes (setting up our table?).  Our server came by to take our drink order, which was a bit confusing since he took some of it, but then another server in a different uniform came by and she took the rest of our order and had our main server relay our initial order to her too.  They both brought out our drinks.  I didn't see that female server after that.  What the heck was that?

Our main server then took our food order, and everything went smooth after that.  NOTE:  There is no kids' menu.  I ended up having to place a regular order + a bowl of soup to share with my younger one (she wanted the spam & eggs and I got the French onion soup).  My older one had the french toast and a side of bacon, and hubby had the ham & cheese melt.  Others had salad, Korean BBQ with kimchi, BLT, and a turkey dinner.  They sure serve a variety here.

Not only that, she ATTEMPTED to present me with a so called ""chilled"" glass, which literally was a rinsed out glass..not chilled at all! She just dropped off the beer and glass and immediately walked away. I didnt even have time to react (LOL). I asked another server to summon her back. She returned and I asked, what is the meaning of the glass? Did I order a soaking wet glass for my beer? She retorted, THATS HOW WE SERVE IT AND THATS HOW ITS DONE ! I replied no way lady, there's actual WATER inside the glass still, and I guarantee you the glass was NOT chilled. I chuckled and asked for simple DRY glass please. She returns to with a small water glass for my beer. HOW UNPROFESSIONAL AND PATHETIC ! I spoke to Don the manager and explained the situation, he was shocked to see the glass and apologized. He returned with another beer on the house. Thank you to the manager. However, fix the problem (the dumb waitress) please. In terms of the food, my party ordered fetticini alfredo which was greasy and over salty, red onion soup which was too sweet and cheese was stale, spaghetti and meatballs were cold and fries were crap!

The ""poached"" eggs were completely solid, not a drop of the gooey, runny yolk that makes me love them so much.  The hollandaise sauce was more of a paste than a sauce, and the accompanying hash browns were burnt on the outside, cold on the inside, and had no flavor whatsoever.

I came in for just a quick breakfast because I had a little bit of time to kill and was horribly disappointed.
