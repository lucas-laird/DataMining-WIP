The store looked disorganized. The employee who was working the front at the time barely acknowledged me. 

He took out of the oven 3 pale yellow pretzels, definitely not Golden Brown. 

Then I got my Cinnamon Sugar Pretzel. It was the worst pretzel I have ever had. I let him know that it wasn't fresh and asked for another. So what did I get? Another old pretzel! 

Hope this was just an off night for this location.",sIPEA_EEQcN45uv0xRp_-Q,0,0,1,vLyApN5RsEEBVHuyT6y_6A

Well the cashier was very friendly but difficult to understand as i kept asking what type of pretzels i could get if i could mix them and she was still a little confused, behind her was Latrisha or something by the style. Instead of coming to the front to help us both understand each other a little more she started screaming from the back to the cashier if she was alright and started stating her broken English which i made no comment about, so i responded she was okay there was no need for her to be screaming at me from the back, continuing to scream loudly  standing behind the table when there was already a long line behind me... It was very uncalled for, all i wanted to know was which pretzels i could choose in order to get the free soda.. Once we got our pretzels the quality of them was not good at all, while kneading the dough on the table they sprayed cleaning chemicals not waiting to remove them from the table to clean, leaving all of our pretzels tasting like a nice clean table instead of a sweet salty pretzel.  

All in all, this was a very bad experience.",UpYHJf6zaVlvaCR-SumoMg,0,0,1,fwK73yF1meRYJlMu1dOj0w
3448244,2017-07-29,1,9NwXHbKyJOhX9nxjRi0AcQ,Went in for a bent wheel ... I was a little hesitant because I often feel as though mechanics attempt to take advantage of women when it comes to cars. Prior to coming in my steering wheel would shake VERY HARD when reaching speeds 60 and above .... it was so bad I could see my arms shaking. Luckily thanks to auntie Annie's they fixed my bent wheel and also informed me of another reason why my steering wheel might have been shaking. All in all $100 is worth it for being at peace while driving !,jBqSSKhrpLw90llxB8r8oQ,0,0,4,U5f3YWD-xSURx8mw729lZQ
3975967,2014-01-27,1,9NwXHbKyJOhX9nxjRi0AcQ,"I came here with a Groupon. I didn't know that it was only good at the outlet location. The worker there (young Caucasian man) had no idea what Groupon was or whether I could redeem it there. He went out of his way to call his manager to ask, and to explain to me nicely that I couldn't redeem it there. I think he genuinely was sorry about it. Lol

it was nice to see someone actually try so hard to strive for excellent customer service, even if I had to walk away sans pretzel. :)",0l1WBKZN_NGwYjQ7BXroeg,0,0,4,lxRviKxhrxUzUs15J1Ritg

No line fast service and great food plus its right next doot to Krispy Kreme so you have the sweet & savory combo.

I ordered the pepperoni pizza pretzel,a pretzel dog w/mustard and an ice cold lemonade.
$14! 
Fantastic pertzels & dogs!

There's seating at Krispy Kreme and this place stays OPEN LATE.

If your at Circus Circus pay them a visit.",3Vd_ATdvvuVVgn_YCpz8fw,3,2,4,2rEG5hFUU_U6BqFydEYLGg
