It was a whole lot more fun than any other Italian wedding I've been to (and they are usually a blast).  A couple of good singers, decent food (buffet with 3 different pastas and Chicken parm plus veggies and garlic bread, wedding cake for dessert).   One free drink with the ticket, but any others were Vegas strip priced (the only downside).

If they have to call it buffet, you prob can refill many times while I don't think you will be interested in eating too much this kind of junk food, especially when they serve the dinner start at about 9pm or even later.

The show is aweful too. the actors and actress play very hard to make you feel it's a real wedding and so some times they will talk to you pretending you are a real guest of the groom or bride. some parts are very dirty and cheesy.

I can see if you paid more for your tickets and only got chicken parm, pasta and sheet cake you'd be really disappointed.  

Being an Italian American girl from NJ, I think they really got it right.  There was even plastic on all the tables, and the place smelled sort of musty like a VFW basement - spot on!  It really did feel like some of the weddings I've been to, and I even liked the food!  (But I think I just really, really miss that type of East Coast Italian-American food, and I try to eat healthy at home so this was a big treat).  

The show was funny and entertaining, and I got to talk to the wedding party during the cocktail party before the wedding, and even dance with the groom.  I would recommend going if you can get a deal on Goldstar or Tix 4 Tonight.",V5633h2RXjFcStScoMZmGQ,4,0,4,iajsrDb_r6lp6O54K4dKuQ

The actors are great at interacting with the audience.  The Nun in particular was one of my favorites and really good at making conversation with us.  It is an Italian wedding, therefore Italian food, family drinking too much and arguing with each other publicly.  Since food costs so much in Las Vegas I felt like a 2 hour interactive show with dinner included was a pretty good deal.  Not the best Italian food I have ever had, but still pretty good.  I was a little surprised that I still had to pay for a ginger ale and that it was not included in the meal.  We bought discount tickets and did not have the best view of the dance floor where a lot of activity goes on because of the large mirrored column in the way, so if I were to do it again I would gets seats in a better location.",9tmDiym0WvPcOuO9QSaMOg,0,0,4,6Q6IMxixVn063dw-cXYABw

1004172,2009-06-14,2,zCaczzZnQUiduNNFvLa0Gg,"I enjoyed T&T's Wedding mainly because we happened to get the tickets for free, and I had never been to an interactive play. With such low expectations and a few $6 glasses of wine I sat back and had a pretty relaxed evening. To go ahead and summarize, I think the show should be valued at about $40 in Las Vegas dollars. I can understand people forking over $100 a head feeling ripped off.

There was no real focal point or plot to the evening other than that mechanics of a normal wedding, which were brief. They ran a few stand up routines, which included guest star Frank Marino that made me laugh. The majority of the time was spent with the cast interacting with us ""wedding guests"" among the various tables. It was impossible to hear them since they did all this unmic'ed and with an amplified wedding band playing on top of them, so the little sub-plots were lost on me. That would be my biggest complaint: half the time the show got so low-key we just ignored it and talked amongst ourselves.

The food and venue were fine but boring, though they played that into the production quite nicely. Watching the establishment owner trying to imitate a disco ball was worth a few dollars on its own.

Highlight: I found myself dancing with a bridesmaid so she could get back at her boyfriend or something, which I think I was supposed to be aware of. Whatever was supposed to happen, my real life girlfriend was all over her in about 10 seconds.

Now that's what I call an interactive show.",MINhGezutF-bKZuKd22MUw,0,0,3,gsSnr8HP27Pdr8FY4AvsCg

Bad venue, food is bad, and you can't hear most of the side conversations that the actors have with the audience so you don't always knows what's going on.

The actors do a good job, but the brides brother is by far the best. He is hysterical!!

In retrospect this was probably a good thing since the actors simply could not act. My boyfriend's mother was sure that her former high school students could do a better job of acting. One actor in particular sat with us just like he supposed to do and proceeded to make inappropriate comments to us about religion. He then belittled us for not spending money on alcoholic beverages. I'm guessing that the only way to actually enjoy the show is to drink a lot of alcohol during it. We walked out before dinner. Unfortunately the tickets are nonrefundable.

It is a dinner show, where you watch Tony and Tina get married and the family feuds that break out during the reception. It's a really cool concept, because you are actually a guest at the wedding. You get to talk with the actors and actresses. It's like attending a funny, dysfunctional wedding that's full of entertaining drama. It does start off a little slow, but it picks up as the show goes on. 

The food was just okay. It's buffet style. They do offer a vegetarian option. Not sure if the menu changes, but they served us pasta and chicken. Even though the food was just okay, the overall experience makes it worth attending at least once!",zRGtyW374pq0fNGcc-yTNQ,1,0,3,VbcJT7J8kOn1wWKGQE3eFQ

1964125,2014-11-17,0,zCaczzZnQUiduNNFvLa0Gg,"This was a totally fun experience. But I have to be honest and say that's because we only paid $20 for our tickets (+ free drinks) and we really got into it. If you're looking to just sit and enjoy a show, this is not for you. If you are looking to get your money's worth and are paying full-price for a ticket, this is not for you. But if you have low expectations, can get a cheap ticket, and want to dance and have fun, this is for you.

1) You have to pay attention and follow the movements of the characters. They're always doing and/or saying something. But you have to keep up with where they went and try to hear what they're saying. If your eyes are only up front and center, and you only listen to the dialogue broadcast over the sound system, you WILL miss out. The funniest moments were the ones that I think most people totally failed to notice.

2) You need to get into it and have fun with it. Interact with other folks and the actors. Go out on the dance floor. Party it up!

3) Don't go hungry. The food is not stellar. Like most any real wedding, you can expect typical wedding food. i.e. Mediocre chicken and bleh cake. I did kinda like the veggie pasta, though.

Follow those three things, and you could have a blast at this show. But know what it is going into it. Some couples at our table looked absolutely miserable and truly disappointed.",YMgZqBUAddmFErxLtCfK_w,9,1,4,JTyQj260co36YGGkX0Nmqg

After going inside, we found our table to be in the back away from the main stage. It was hard for us to see anything actually happening. The jokes were dull and dry.

We got the tix on Groupon for $49, but the audience should really be paid to watch and/or be related to the actors.

The actors at our table (one of the groomsmen and bridesmaids) were funny and tried their best to entertain us and did a bit at times.  It captured the spirit of a wedding as in: bad food, crappy music and searching one's soul to feign enthusiasm, and bonding with strangers about how bad the show was.  

Most the accents and jokes were bad, and it was uncomfortable to watch.  Maybe it was funny 30 years ago? Maybe time to find a new ethnic stereotype to make fun of? Cause the Italian thing has been played out.",kp0YGASkXEXeSoXicSy0SQ,2,0,1,KanOVlMe_l7ZwxHcDAvxUw

So then he seated us....... When we sat down they had a Cesar salad so we served our selves it was ok... So now the wedding party comes in while we're eating our salad and I was getting thirsty.

Sadly to say I was VIP and no one noticed that on our tickets until I got up and asked to be moved. Water is free and you get that yourself from the bar. If you want a Coke that's $4 (no free refills), beer & liquor was very pricey. This show was okay. If your table receives appetizers you better grab one and put it on your plate because people at our table ate them all and left us none. The large salad bowl was tasty. Overall food was good (average). We had chicken Parmesan, penne pasta with sauce, steamed veggies with garlic bread. Wedding cake tasted like it had been frozen, not good at all. If you don't want to dance and interact this is not the show for you. Some parts of the ""show"" could be considered a little ""raunchy"".

The only thing I can imagine possibly rationalizing the bad food, bad entertainment, and bad venue is that... well...

I can't adequately emphasize how bad this show was.  I mean, this was just bad.  BAD, BAD, BAD.  It absolutely reached new, never-before-seen levels of badness.

--- [What the...?  Why is this Sopranos-type-guy forcing us to take a picture with him?   $20?  For a photo I didn't even want to take in the first place?  I thought we were going to a theatre of some sort.  Why are we traversing hallways along the ass end of the hotel?]
--- [This sure is a long walk to BFE.  Wait... We're going outdoors... on to the ROOF of the casino?  They're actually making us walk outside to go to the show venue?  There's puddles all over the place.  They couldn't even build an overhang?]
--- [Oh, now you've gotta be sh-ttin' me.  This is the room?  This... this... STORAGE room in the back of the hotel is where the performance is?  God, this has got to be the worst dinner theatre venue I've ever seen.]
--- [So, actors are supposed to come entertain us while we eat?  Really?  Cripes, the cast is just loud & arbitrary.  There had better be some good food to make up for all of this.]
--- [OMG.  Did I really pay $100 for cheap pasta in aluminum pans served buffet style?  I feel like I'm eating camp food.  God, I'm such an idiot for buying these tickets.]
--- [Oh for f-ck's sake, they're coming toward us... pleasedon'tsithere pleasedon'tsithere pleasedon'tsi... HIIIIII THERE.  So.  You're one of the actors are you.  Well, ain't that a hoot.  Well, don't mind me while I create a log cabin here with my cheap overstarched pasta.]
--- [When...  WHEN is this going to end?  Wait.  Did it end?  That's it?  I dunno.  I guess so.  Alright.  Off to Nobu's.]

SO, UH, THE PERFORMANCE WASN'T TOO GOOD 'EH?
I seriously don't know what kind of person finds this catastrophe funny.  All it is, is semi-organized chaos amongst poorly motivated improvisational actors.  (I'm not going to torch the actors being that I'm sure some of them might be able to showcase their talent had they been given some decent part in a real show.)  There is just absolutely nothing humorous about this show and I'd rather be forced to attend timeshare sales pitches with my eyelids taped open than see this disaster again.

AND I TAKE IT THE FOOD WASN'T GREAT EITHER?
For the record, I've been to strip clubs with buffets better than what they served at Tony & Tina's Wedding.  The difference is, no one touches the food at a strip club buffet.  Here, it's your only frickin' option, so we starved ourselves by abstaining for eating any more of the food and held out for dinner elsewhere after the show.  After all - what's the point in going to Vegas - a city with glorious restaurants everywhere - if you're going to have to fill your gullet with cheap pasta worse than what you'd get out of a hospital commissary?

CONCLUSION:
This show isn't just bad, it's a complete waste of valuable Vegas trip time.  It actually made me angry to have been taken for so much money for such an awful show.  I wouldn't go see it again even if you got a bare-assed naked Jessica Alba to personally bring me a bounty of 10,000 gold coins and whisper unspeakable things in my ear.  Yes.  That bad.

In fact, the only Vegas show that I can think of that was as bad as this was the Hawaiian Luau at the Imperial Palace, and big surprise... guess what rating I gave that worthless wonder?

ONE-STAR!

HOWTO:  ""BIDE YOUR TIME WHILE WAITING FOR THE SHOW TO END""
If for some reason you find yourself at this godforsaken atrocity, I should tell you that there was one entertaining moment in the whole night. 

People were drinking a lot of cheap wine during the show.  Combine that with lukewarm pasta that has the tendency to expand in your stomach and you've got yourself the potential for a lot of... [ahem]... ""upset stomachs"".  

As a result, there were quite a few people hurriedly making a break for the exits during the latter part of the show, so as people got up, my wife & I played a little game called, ""Barf or Sh-t"".  The goal is to simply determine what the motivation is for a given couple's rapid exit from the theatre.  Try it & you may find the second half of the show goes by a bit faster.",hU46otnbSfdU5oI0zhJGoA,13,10,1,P_AsyW-X34Qc1-JK2usryw

It's like being at your high school buddies wedding- right down to the family-style carrots and ranch served as appetizers. It was crowded. The food was just ok, and was served buffet style.

They try to make you feel like you're at a friend's wedding; they have actors coming up and talking to you but you pretty much just want them to go away. This one actor asked me to dance; I told him I didn't want to and he made me anyway and then told me I looked like I was in high school, that I had a cute baby face, and that I wouldn't have a hard time finding a job because my major was employable. I didn't pay money for his opinions about me. After that, we ate and the food was okay. The same actor came up to me later and told me to dance more and asked me who I had to impress. Excuse me. Then later, he made me and my sister get up for the boquet toss (I mean, what if you don't want to participate?). We had a fake-drunk actor at my table, how random. He kept mumbling while I was trying to eat my cake.

Don't go for the meal.  It's not that much nor is it haute cuisine.  What I liked was the recreation of an Italian wedding.  I've seen the ""groom"" in many local plays that tourists would never see, so it was an extra treat for me.

The singer who was the wedding entertainer was quite good, and there was a mix of music to please all ages.

I would recommend what others have said.  If you go, look for discounted tickets.  As for VIP tickets, they get you to the food line first (not a big deal), but you do sit very close to the wedding action.

We had fillaseat tickets.  So, we had to pay for two drinks.  This helped loosen even my uptight husband up and he did the YMCA with a construction hat on.  

Go, laugh, eat mediocre Italian-American food (it's not Italian food!), and enjoy your evening.  Worthy of an evening out.

EDIT: the MOB contacted me on here and accused me of throwing cake at her and ruining her jewelry.  Please note that I threw cake at no one.  Apparently, she steals people's food so often that additional incidents occur.  As a side note, her taking my food, hiding it, and another person bringing it back could arguably be a food code violation.  Perhaps, I could review SNHD's regulations on that matter.

This show is getting a bad rap. I absolutely enjoyed myself. I was entertained the entire time. The talk of drunken Italians is a bit disrespectful, I'm Italian and this was hilarious. Maybe a bit more than reality but pretty darn close to a real Italian family. If you don't have a good sense of humor or are a true stick in the mud this show isn't for you. The show is almost 100% audience interactive. I was only in my seat for about 25 minutes of the 2 hour show. Dancing, singing, taking pictures, getting food, the bar. The base rate of the show ticket is pricy. Well your a moron if you pay full price. Do find a deal lol. I did. Google it, 1/2 price ticket booths, in hotel room coupon booklets. So many options. 
Your show ticket includes dinner, which is nice. It doesn't not include drinks. So be aware when ordering drinks from the server. Salad is served 1st at your table. So dig in. Don't be shy. Dinner was A-ok. What was being served: baked ziti, chicken parmesan, bow tie pasta, veggies, & bread. Go ahead get everything you payed for it. I sure did! Check out my picture you can see my plate. The food is comparable to a buffet style meal. Nothing to write home over but definitely not gross. Lol!! When the show concludes, Tony & Tina cut their cake and cake is served to the entire audience. The cake is pretty delicious. Totally grab a slice. 
So what is my point here. This show is interactive, if you are boring and do not want to play along in the show this is not the show for you. Seriously don't be to serious in life. Go with it, it's all pretend anyways. Hate to break it to ya, but Tony and Tina's wedding is just a show not a real wedding you old farts.

It was very over priced for what you get .. Wine isn't included with the meal and was $30 for the 3 glasses we had .. You also don't get any water you have to go get it yourself from the bar .. 

If you're already at Ballys do yourself a favor and go next door to see jersey boys.",KBDP0QCHbCuisidKT6GPow,6,1,2,fbOFTFVkTedolx56vuKqjg

( I almost died there, I was in TNT for 2 years...it almost devoured my soul.  But, this review isn't about me or my body of work, so let's move on, shall we?)

Tony and Tina's to it's credit is the oldest piece of interactive theater around, and it's still going strong.  The tickets tend to be a little pricey at $125 a pop, but they do have local deals, just check out the box office.  The food is a bit on the dull side, but you can have as much as you want.  Buffet style all the way.

On the bright side.  It's like going to a big fat Italian wedding and you get to hang out with some really funny actors.  Be ready to dance and then dance some more.  But it's not an opera or really a play for that matter.  Don't expect a master piece of Amadeus proportions, but....do expect the bride to get slapped, the priest to get drunk, and the gay brother to prance....and maybe, if you're lucky, someone will Chicken Dance all over your face.",dZBXRw0BtYd-C3MEjtHUFw,2,1,3,8uArsB-DU19W798ceoAJYA

Ooohh, an interactive theater show!  With dinner included!  And tickets are half off at the Tix 4 Tonight booth?!?  Count me in!

Thoughts During the Show:

OMG...this is sooooo cheesy, and I'm not even talking about the pasta.  Is there supposed to be some kind of story line here b/c it just seems like a whole bunch of ppl yelling at each other and trying to be funny (emphasis on the word ""trying"").  Oh, OMG!  Now there's a Rod Stewart wanna be on stage!  Ok, this show isn't cheesy...it's just plain BAD, and I'm getting a headache from all this random not-so-funny/bad bantering.  Let's just go...

Thoughts on the Food:

My elementary school cafeteria pumped out more tasty meals than this crap!  :(((((((

Summary and Afterthought:

Show sucked.  Food sucked.  My friend and I left in the middle, and even though the tickets were half off, we still felt jipped!  Sorry to be a downer, but it's been a year and I still can't believe I wasted 2 hrs of my life on this show!  Tony and Tina's Wedding could have been better if there was more of a story line and more intelligent humor.  Why don't you work on that, guys?  It's a wonder how this show lasted longer than Mamma Mia!  R.I.P.",0mPoOl_Rx46jaHOG9pybzQ,11,5,1,RaP7jgbKdm_1jHj-oKaoKw
5595886,2009-02-11,3,zCaczzZnQUiduNNFvLa0Gg,"I have such fond memories of the ""Tony and Tina Wedding"" experience! 

My Mother was one of the funniest, wittiest people I have ever had the privilege of knowing. Not to be ""Debbie Downer"" ....when her health began to really decline, my Aunt insisted we have a last hoorah if you will and take a trip to Vegas. While there, she wanted to also treat us to a show. We chose this one. 

The whole way they pull it off is corny and cool at the very same time. You come as if you are attending a wedding and even take pics with the wedding photographer before the show. Then, the whole show takes place before your eyes as you are all participants at the reception of this crazy NY couple and their family! The couple comes around to each table while you have dinner at the reception buffet which was actually quite tasty. The family member cast comes by too. The show was good but the conversations my Mom had with these actors was FANTASTIC! She truly through them for a loop when she confessed to the bride's BFF that she had a long affair with Tony, the bridegroom.  It was embarrassing, yet good stuff! 

It's an entertaining show alternative if you dont mind having to constantly move your chair around to watch everything that is going on. Check it out...ENJOY!

5604086,2012-06-28,2,zCaczzZnQUiduNNFvLa0Gg,"The show is not nearly is terrible as the reviews say and food not nearly as horrendous as you'd expect based on most reviews. Also, there is plenty of it. No, it's not the Bellagio buffet so just get a plate full, how much more do you need anyway?

If you come in expecting Cirque or Phantom grandeur, you are simply in the wrong place. It's corny, cheesy and you absolutely have to be willing to get into the spirit of it, the point is to be engaged. If that's not your thing- don't go. I also thought the larger the group you come with, the more fun you'll have :0)

As for food- it's salad, pasta, chicken and bread. And cake. I had none of the salad or pasta or cake and scraped all the cheese off the chicken and the remaining filet was tender and pretty flavorful in a typical marinara slathered sort of way. It's not Mesa Grill, but who cares. It was plenty of food for me and the bar kept me busy with the modest selection of beers, just the basics.

I read all the reviews below and was horrified at the prospects of losing an hour or whatever it is out of my life attending this show. I was pleasantly surprised! If you go, don't be a stick in the mud and you might just have a reasonably good time.",7Vfy39A_totC-w70qZi0MA,5,2,4,VzoLZyxqyQ3zPyO546qSPA

Its been so long since I have been to a wedding I almost forgot what they were all about lol

Me and one of my friends went to see this. I did not know what to expect never seeing it before or reading about it.
It is a interactive show almost like your attending someones friends wedding where you don't know anyone.
I have always heard Italian weddings were fun and this was exactly that. Of course it was all staged out and even though it was a show you did feel part of it they talk to you like they know you! 
It was a fun time, I read some of the reviews and I do not know why it got anything less than 4 stars it was not a bad time!

The food was just like you were at the reception and when they cut the cake it was realistic!
It is good for any age, nothing bad for your family to see.
The food was ok not from a gourmet chef but it did the job.

I almost forgot you do  get a glass of champagne. The only thing is you have to pay to go to their wedding! If you go to 1/2 price tickets or look for discounts you can get in pretty cheap.

Go in with a open mind enjoy the music, and interact!  If you go with the thought of not having fun you won't! Remember your there for a good time its not a real wedding lol",zH6racrZ7rUqqv_Qy6dZDQ,6,5,4,zpOBcoZJnyTA71-FLNEi_A
5848368,2011-06-20,3,zCaczzZnQUiduNNFvLa0Gg,"This show does not stay in one spot very long. When I saw this show it was being performed upstairs in a different showroom at PH. Now at this present time is being performed in the ""V"" Theater. Anyways no matter where it is I feel it is just so so. The characters seem bored and fall in and out of their script, one minute they are talking to you like you are part of the family attending the wedding. The next minute they asked us if we are locals from vegas or visiting? Come on now, just plain silly. I am ALL about role playing just keep it straight!

The Italian buffet for the meal service is mediocre, I never expect really good food at these types of shows but at least let it be hot! It is sitting out way to long prior to the cattle call to go get your plate.

A nice touch is that there is wedding cake and a glass of champagne served during the show after the meal. That is my only decent memory of this show sadly.",deL6e_z9xqZTIODKqnvRXQ,10,3,2,5ebiRE27dyE85YulDgzLkw

If you have ever been to a bad New Jersey wedding then don't bother... you have already seen the show! The actors were all very nice, and put up with my dad's s**t when they came and sat at our table, so props to that... but the show was pretty pointless, and the ""italian buffet"" was pretty blah. 

Don't bother with VIP seating... there are three tables in ""VIP"" and only one was full. It was also in the back of the room, and kind of hard to see. You do get bruschetta and a salad with VIP?? 

Could be fun with a big group of friends, but not so much with just my parents and I... and the 3 old ladies that were sitting at our table.",aU4n8HBLWpk4B8fP7PbL5A,5,0,2,Qo8Ys-55leBvYZ0fimyIrg

The food was Stouffer's Chicken Parm , garlic bread and salad. We had fun watching the other audience members ""get down""! One guy threw himself into the limbo until his back gave out! The cast was pretty committed to the story and stayed in character. Still, it was like community theatre. We probably were pretty easy to entertain, but it's Vegas!
