I say cooks because the people in the kitchen are not chefs. The tom kha was too sour and salty. The deep fried catfish was not crispy. Ample seating room, however the wait for the food to arrive took very long. They also did not give us a menu while some parties that arrived after us were given menus. There were people complaining about the long wait for food to arrive. This girl I saw had to walk around the restaurant to get the sauce tray. We ordered water when we were seated, but the water did not come until I asked for it for the third time and half way through my meal. The soups do not come with rice unless it is their lunch special(excludes weekend). If you are from California, just wait until you go back to California for some better Thai food. Probably the worst Thai restaurant in California is better than this place. One star because I feel bad for the inefficient waiters who haven't been properly trained, and also because I cannot give less stars. 

In conclusion, this place should pay its customers to eat here because time is money, and you will be spending a lot of time waiting for your food.

Up until we ordered. She didn't ask how spicy we wanted any of the dishes. We ordered Pad See Ew, Panang Curry, Pad Thai, and the chicken wings appetizer. Each dish was very sweet, no spice. 

Chicken wings - good sauce, decent serving size
Pad Thai - too peanuty
Panang curry - didn't even wanna try it, but my family said it was decent. Looked a little watery, not creamy enough
Pad see ew - VERY bland

-Water was not served because we ordered a Thai tea and there weren't enough cups. Staff said something along the lines of, ""I'm afraid of you request for water, you might get a dirty cup.""
-we had to go up to the front counter to pay, as I had also mentioned before, staff did not check up on me and my party.

     2. It was nearly impossible to communicate with the man delivering since he spoke little to no english

c) They got our orders wrong - we ordered a Vegetarian Pad Thai with spiciness level 10 and a Chicken Pad Thai with spicy level 2, but they switched the heat, leaving us with an unbearable spiciness on the Chicken Pad Thai and a heat-less Veggie Pad Thai

They have a soup there, Boat Noodle Soup, where I can taste the richness of the bones and different parts simmered in the soup. It's got a unique, rich flavor that I haven't tasted in other restaurant broths. Okay in fairness, it doesn't have the same flavor profile of other Thai soups I had. But I know enough to know what I DON'T  know about Thai food. While I eat it regularly, I am no expert. What I DO feel expert in is identifying rich, flavorful stocks. And man, this soup is so good. 

Yes, I tasted some other dishes and was pleased with everything I ate. The drunken noodle, wings, and basil fried rice were all nicely flavored and comprised of quality ingredients.  I wasn't as blown away by these dishes, but they were certainly solid. 

I am heading back to  Thai St Café now for my second experience and plan to have a third very soon. I will update my review after having more than one experience with this small place. But after MANY disappointing Thai food experiences in this town, I was pleased to stumble on a place that is putting out tasty food and delivering it to boot. I'm always willing to give a Yelp score based on a single dish.  And that Boat Noodle Soup is a new go-to for me. Most places can't get one dish correct, let alone a homey and simple/complex soup.  So yeah, I'm a fan.

EDITED to ADD: Well, after two more bouts with the soup, mango, and noodles, I am changing my review. It was still tasty and I was pleased with my food, but the exceptional flavor profile just wasn't there. The soup, in particular, was less a subtle configuration of layered flavors, and more a warm, well-seasoned stock. Good--will be ordered again--but not exceptional. 

It feels more like a consistency issue than a quality issue. I don't think one stumbles into soup as amazing as what they served me few months back. Two mediocre experiences out of three is a little disappointing. But I have a feeling about this place. I will be back. And I am hopeful.",2k8OVAPxlXHsA5X6EIoQpQ,3,4,3,QgLYiQEgqTjm9sLZH7p9YA

The curry puffs and sauce were amazing. They are hand made and were cooked to perfection. All of the taste blended together nicely with just the right amount of heat. The jerky was good. It wasn't the staple I thought but it was good and I can see how one would come to crave it. All in all I enjoyed the take out. My husband was impressed with the cleanliness and his service.

While the staff was friendly, they could not keep up with the number of customers. We waited quite a while to place an order.

Unfortunately, I ordered a noodle dish, and it was just okay. I ordered a 10, and it was not spicy at all, which is always a huge disappointment for me.

They completely ignored every second of it. They called me to give them the gate code (they went to the wrong gate on the wrong road). Then I told him I would step onto my balcony so I could tell him where to turn since I have full view of the parking lot; instead he says yes thank you and immediately hangs up. He parks and ignores the directions again going to the out of service elevator, he walks back to his car and I'm waving at him with the light from my phone and whistled at him.

1432181,2015-11-27,14,w5CSi-An5meLnxjKSFn0wQ,"This review is actually 4.5 stars. Thai food is probably the greatest cuisine in the world. When someone mentions 'Thai Street food' in America, for most people the images of Pok Pok in Portland will stand as the measuring stick for anyone that claims to be doing this style of Thai food. There are good versions of this style of food in Vegas, as well as bad ones. Fortunately, I'm happy to say that Thai St. Cafe is one of the good ones. (And Chada Street is one of the 'not so good' ones :) )

So let's backtrack a couple of weeks prior to coming to Thai St Cafe. I was at Chada Street, the bigger name restaurant that was proclaiming to have the 'street food' of Thailand. Suffice to say, I couldn't see it. All I saw was Chada Thai and Wine #2. Not only that, the portions were smaller, and the prices higher. I was really disappointed with this spot.

Looking at the pictures of Thai St. Cafe, my hopes were definitely pointed towards the upward. Upwardian, you might say. So I came by on a dark and mysterious day. It's located on a shady part of town. But, isn't all great food, really. Walking in, I got the interior, it screamed Thai street. Lost were the pretense I felt at Chada Street. After sitting down, things kept on looking good.

Khao Soi. It's an underrated Thai dish. When one thinks of Thai 'street food', Khao Soi automatically comes to mind. And there are only a few restaurants doing this dish in town. Thai St. Café does it exceptionally well. Great curry, with wonderful egg noodles, just a winning dish. My only concern would be the raw red onion slices that they put on top. They were quite astringent, and they slightly overwhelmed the dish. Perhaps if they used pickled red onions, or roasted them, then it could have helped take away some of the sharpness or ""onion-ness"". But as a whole, I really liked it.

The Drunken noodles were spot on. I requested 'no tomatoes' in my dish (like always) because I feel that they do not belong in Pad Kee Mao. And you can disagree with me all you want. That's my story, and I'm sticking to it. It was well cooked. As was the Red Curry.

The service was good. Our server made sure our drinks were filled, and was very friendly and helpful. 

On a small side note, I think what was missing on this Thai street food menu was Khao Man Gai a.k.a. chicken over rice. If you call yourself a Thai street food place, you must have two essentials, Khao Soi (which they do) and Khao Man Gai. This, too, is my story and I will be also sticking to that.

I would love to come back here and try out more of the menu, particularly their boat noodles and lunch special. Michael K. out.",gtwM4ijo65AN4DvXdgCu_w,19,18,4,vSej69MCkbmCGhV-6-B4YA

I was craving thai curry last night while studying, and Thai St Cafe showed up nearest on my yelp search. It was during a study session so I wanted to do take out and get my thai curry as quickly as possible.

This is when I first discovered that Eat24 was available on their yelp page! YES! I love having my orders ready for pick up. 
So for the ordering process, I clicked on ""Order Pick Up or Delivery"" which led me to their menu with thumbnail pictures next to the name of each item. Their Panang curry was labeled with a star, so I figured that was a popular choice right? So I added 2 of the Panang Curry items, added Chicken, No Spice level, and from there I reviewed my order and checked out. A confirmation email was sent immediately showing me the approximate time of when my order would be done. The ease of ordering thru yelp was a 5/5. 

I quickly drove to the place because, obviously I was that hungry that I arrived inside Thai St Cafe 10 minutes from the estimated order completed time. The woman behind the cash register welcomed me and told me my order would be completed soon and sure enough, it was done 5 minutes earlier than expected! The pick up process was easy and quick. And the customer service was great! Even a worker from the back bringing silverware to the front asked me how everything going.

I can say the inside of Thai St Cafe was definitely a lot more cleaner and decoratively designed than the area it's located in. I was impressed! Anyway, the pang curry came with rice and it was SO FULFILLING! My cravings has never been so satisfied. It was rich and I understood why there was a gold star next to its name on the menu list. This place is definitely a hidden gem and I recommend it to all food lovers!

We ordered the typical spread of food such as egg rolls, soup, shrimp pad thai, orange chicken and 2 different fried rice. I must say, with the abundance of Thai restaurants around town, this place did not meet my expectation for taste. I prefer my usual Thai places I frequently dine at, which are located away from the strip.
The Tom Kha soup is my favorite Thai soup. I like my broth w/ a more coconut milk taste. This soup did not deliver. On the other hand, the wonton soup was pretty good. Both soups were served in smaller pots compared to other places.
I preferred the taste of the chicken fried rice over the pineapple fried rice. We ordered 2 orange chicken. This was unanimously the least liked dish. The orange chicken sauce was too strong. Shrimp Pad Thai was ordered mild (not spicy) but it still came out too spicy. The same happened with the Tom Yum noodle soup. 
This place is conveniently located near the strip and prices are decent. While this is not my first choice when I think of Thai food, the atmosphere and service makes up for it.

Ordered from here while on vacation in Vegas and the food was great.

Food this place on Yelp and had to order from here. My lady was tired of the hotel food and prices so we got something different. She placed the order and I got the DRUNK NOODLES, spicy 10.

I had never been asked that question before back in California when ordering the DRUNKEN NOODLES but I was excited for this meal. The only issue was that they would not be able to deliver the meal to the room, hotel regulations against double parking in entrance!!! I get it though!

The food did not take long to arrive. It took about 30 minutes at most. After bringing the food up it was time to EAT! 

The food was already smelling food before it even opened the plastic top. THAT IS HOW GOOD IT WAS! Once I laid out the food on the table and grabbed my fork I was ready. BOOM....spicy spicy and sweet. Not sure what other spices were added but the places that I have been to in San Francisco do not even match this spot!! The level of spicy is CRAZY good. Seriously, if you like spicy then this place when get it POPPIN all off in YO MOUTH!!! 

Great dinner, great meal, fireworks of spicy flavor in my mouth and belly!

So when my family and I went back to our resort hotel we were not feelin room service so I was the only one wanting Thai so I took the trip to go to Thai St Cafe since they had good reviews on yelp.

They had Thai Chicken Basil grounded and I was so happy. This place is so pretty on the inside, however the outside and the area appears to be shady. A few establishments down is a gentleman's club so there was A LOT of men roaming around up to no good. I was hesitant of getting out of the car due to that fact but I was like what could possibly happen from my car to the restaurant in 5 feet.

So I ordered my meal and waited a good 10 minutes. I got into my car and left. My sister was with me and was happy we were leaving the area, maybe day time is better...who knows.


So when I got back to our stay, I opened up my meal it was not what I ordered and they gave me the wrong meal -_- it was some type of noodles that was good but was not my Thai Ground Chicken Basil. I was disappointed due to that but the noodles and chicken were good.

The restaurant itself is called Thai Street Cafe. So one would presume authentic Thai ""street"" food. But it was far from it. Very Americanized modern flavor, which is not bad in itself because I love Americanized Thai food too. But this place, as far as flavor and spices-were just average...even their Thai iced coffee was very sweet, tasted like heavy chocolate syrup.
The best thing they had was their pork jerky! Perfectly seasoned and tender! Their house made sauce went perfect with the flavors. Most Thai places only have beef jerky. So when your restaurant has pork jerky that's also a huge plus! 
Also they did not have an option for Laos Style Papaya Salad! Most Thai places do not....BUT if your Thai restaurant does have it or can make it that's a HUGE plus-extra star;-)",FVRAb6vqzkPfr1DyM-8kGA,0,0,4,PAzDtDWe_VcG5o4S_fsotA

We had to wait a few minutes since it wasn't ready but that wasn't a problem at all. We got the Thai tea with boba. Oh my gosh. First sip and I thought I was just drinking sugar. I know all places make Thai tea different so I always expect it's either a hit or miss. With that in mind, I just thought I could just water it down a little, no big deal. Then I got to the boba, and now I'm regretting the entire drink. It was the hardest boba I've ever had. I worked at a boba shop a while back so I know that their boba was not even close to being cooked. They were very understanding and friendly about it though. They just remade the Thai tea without boba and gave us an extra one. I didn't really care for more super sweet tea, but that was sweet of them. 

I got the beef salad and the beef was just chewy. And it was more sour than having that spicy, salt, and lime balanced taste. I didn't even make a dent in my beef salad. I ate more of the plain white rice I ordered on the side. 

The boyfriend ordered their crab rangoons and those were really good. It had an extra taste to them compared to all the other crab rangoons I've tried. 

Even tho I wasn't a fan, I do plan on giving them another try. Maybe dining in next time will be better.",mG-q2qtWVAxDEW5Y7BwcCw,0,0,3,uLYZ-O1Z3PHh0LbHUSQ8Kg

They were supposed to close in 1 hour and a couple came to eat and they were turned out because they were closed... ¿?¿?? 
Food tasted 7/10 it says no msg on the door but it felt like there was some msg in the food.. Not completely sure. And the tom yum I ordered, was delicious but not level 7 spicy as I asked for. 
I didn't want to ask them to take it back and fix it because at that point I already spilled my water and the workers were irritated and had to move our tables and do all this extra work (which I felt bad about) so I didn't say anything. 
Anyways, we Also ordered crying tiger 9/10 , wonton hot pot 9/10 (tasted somewhat healthier than the tom yum) 
And drunken noodle 3/10(my friends opinion) he said they didn't offer enough for the price paid for. 
The sweet sticky rice and mango also came with green rice which actually wasn't that sticky and $6.95! So expensive.
Lastly, I'd have to admit. If you want the best bang for your buck don't come here, there's secret hidden costs everywhere and it's so expensive for mediocre quality food and they don't even offer enough to satisfy your hunger. I ordered side noodles for my soup; $3.95
Side order rice; $2.50 
Tom yum soup is supposed to come with a meat any extra meat is extra cost. I didn't order extra meat just the meat that comes with it.. shrimp; $2
Drunken noodles about $9 for a pretty small plate. 
I mean the inside is cute though and nicely decorated and fairly clean. It's just that this shop is set up in a plaza full of strip clubs and it's a little far from where I live. The only good thing is it opens late but even then they still don't let you come in at 3 when they close at 4! 
I truly want to give this place another chance and think maybe their tom yum has potential to reach its ultimate spicy goodness! And that maybe we came on a bad day, hopefully they can redeem themselves I don't know.

And he actually went there before me on a lone venture a couple nights later. He enjoyed the food and got me pad see ew to go as a result. We went the next day together.

The restaurant really is small in area/seating space but it wasn't too busy the day we came in for lunch. It's a very casual setting. We were immediately greeted by the lovely server who remembered my bf the previous day. She was the lone server and delivered excellent hospitality and was very attentive our whole stay. 

I love that the water came in a bottle and was ice cold. We got the free Thai tea with yelp check-in which was quite sweet but hey it was free x) not to mention was in a tall glass. 

We chose the chicken satay as our free appetizer. The chicken was cooked perfectly and didn't turn out dry. The marinade on it wasn't overly salty or over seasoned.  The accompanying peanut sauce was delicious as a dipping sauce and the pickled cucumber salad which wasn't too sour or sweet complimented the satay very well.

My boyfriend ordered the drunken noodles with chicken.  He got it with medium heat which was quite spicy but manageable. I suggest getting it mild. Noodles weren't overcooked or mushy and it wasn't too saucy; just right.

I got the pad Thai lunch set with shrimp (as suggested by our server) and it was a nice portion of food. It included an egg roll (with a delicious dipping sauce different from sweet and sour), salad with a peanut vinegrette dressing, and scoop of rice which I didn't touch cause I had noodles as a main. It had the right amount of spicy; not too much to the point I couldn't handle the heat. The lunch set is a pretty good amount of food and I didn't finish anything on my plate except the egg roll lol but I took them to go.

I am actually eating my leftovers as I type this review and the pad Thai is still as good as yesterday. Lost some of its  moisture as expected but the flavors are still there.

Food didn't take too long to come out and you could tell they took their time to cook it to order.

Our visit was not complete without our souvenir pic with the cardboard taxi haha. And lucky for us the previous patrons already left so we managed to take a couple pics with no one around lol with the help of our server too. Don't forget to take one with it as well! 

All in all, would definitely be back. Must try their desserts and curry.

I had Thai St Cafe delivered to my hotel after a super long day of walking. My boyfriend and I decided on thai food over sushi and we didn't think we would regret our decision so much. 

Food:
Pad See Ew: I ordered a 2 on the spiciness for the pad see ew after reading that the spicy ranges from 1-10. I expected the spiciness to be slightly more spicy than mild but it was SO spicy that I threw it out after eating a few bites. My stomach was unsettled for the rest of the night. It was completely flavorless aside from the extreme heat. Usually pad see ew is rather sweet and savory but this one was dry, bland, and just way too spicy for what I ordered. 
Pad Thai: My boyfriend had this one and he finished most of his. He ordered 8 on spiciness and he thought it was really spicy. But that was what he wanted so it was fine. It wasn't that flavorful aside from the spiciness either though. 
Chicken wings: I thought maybe at least chicken wings wouldn't disappoint me but I was wrong. The wings were pretty dry and spicy even though the sauce was advertised as sweet chili. What happened to the sweetness?

Pictures looked enticing.
Walked in, and no one approached us about seating. The staff just had tunnel vision and just looked down the whole time.

Once seated, took her 20 minutes to take our order. Ordered the Tiger Wrap, which she told us was unavailable. Ok, now if she would have approached us sooner maybe we could have had a back up dish. She put in our order for papaya salad, which 5 minutes had passed and we still hadn't received our waters.

There were only two of them on the floor and I noticed most of the guests had looked irate for constantly waiting and trying to flag down for service. 

With such a long wait for just anything in general, and lack in service, and honestly no apologies on their end. We just gave up, she never returned back to complete our orders, give us drinks or anything for that matter. We gave up, cancelled whatever order we had and walked out. That is something I had never done before especially being in the industry myself.

THAI CHICKEN WINGS: Good flavor in the sauce but otherwise a bit on the dry side, price was okay for the portion but this didn't stand out as something I'd get again.
CRYING TIGER WRAP: grilled sliced beef, lettuce, tomato, onion, mint, cilantro, and rice wrapped in a tortilla with a spicy lime sauce. I really enjoyed the sauce and the tender meat, but there was no rice in my wrap. It was mostly stuffed with lettuce, which made it lighter than the burrito-esque food I was expecting.

Staff was friendly when I went to pick up my order. They did inform me that the curries were popular, and they were likely removing the wraps from the menu. Despite the seedy area, the interior was nicely decorated with dark wood and large color photos of Thailand street markets. Disappointed that they don't actually have anything resembling street food here.

NOTE: Pricing is a little high for the area, such as $10 for an entrée without rice (additional $3) and all apps seem to be about $8. Not super high or anything, just not consistent with expectations for Industrial Rd.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,9,5,3,7GufbBD8cVGNXGhh8M8msw

The delivery was quick. The prices are decent. I wish the food was as good.

I ordered:
Red chicken curry with no sugar
Basil beef with no sugar 
Side of steamed vegetables 

Both entries that were suppose to be sugar free had sugar. Warning: The Basil beef was a plate of ground beef with a few green beans. What a big disappointment.",j_HaUjxFUsVAL3InZpuipA,2,0,3,jJyOQRQqC8uDRY7kQI_pCQ

Initially I was going to give this place a four stars. The food was really good and the environment cool- but the service- TERRIBLE. First the waitress didn't bring us water or drinks or plates. The food comes out and we ask another waiter for drinks and everything. He comes and beings it over. Food comes out fast and good. 

Our waitress didn't come to us at all until the bill comes. She brings me the bill with gratuity already added when there are only four of us. I told her and she said oh that was her mistake and that she'll adjust it. I could tell she tried to sneak it on there so when I left cash I intentionally left the tip off. I don't give money to scammers. 

As we pack up and leaving she comes over to me and tells me that I didn't leave her a tip and ""why- was the service bad?"" I said honestly - yes and told her why. She didn't check on us once, didn't bring us our meals. Etc"" she snaps and says "" oh ok you should take your penny change- you keep it"" at that point- I was pissed and told her to keep it. As I'm walking out she says "" keep it. You can save it for your baby.""  

I have a seven month old son. If anyone reading this has kids- you could understand how insulting that is. People like that don't have any decency or respect even for themselves- that's why she's at where she's at in her career. 

I told her she can keep the tip and left. I didn't want to turn the place into the last 48. 

As we were packing the car- her friend/coworker comes out and says something to us. I confront her and she said she didn't say anything - wanting to be slick and avoid any trouble. 

We left. I recommend any place but this one. It's the tallest manly looking waitress there. You'll know who she is when you see her. 

Also triple check your bill.",8oCDZReWtf9YTsO6fIyx-g,4,3,1,7gKMVJBYRxMorM98_lhX2A

We ordered a pad thai with shrimp: average thai. Good spice, good quantity. We also ordered the red curry -- great quantity and was on par with a decent thai restaurant. Lastly, we ordered a thai beef salad -- a little simple, only the beef and some lettuce leaves (probably wouldn't order this one again).

We arrived at the restaurant, it was pretty hidden in a small plaza. As we went into the restaurant, it was empty with not even one customer inside. So we sat down. The server was really nice.

The thai tea was really good. I enjoyed it but when we got out food. The tom kha soup was way too sweet in my opinion. It just didn't taste like the tom kha soup that I usually eat.

There were two servers in the restaurant - one a skinny lady who was really sweet & the other a bitchy piece of work (whom I'll be referring to PoW henceforth).

So PoW took us 10 minutes to get water. Took our order. We got a red curry because its easy & quick and we were ready to go on with our day. Fast forward 30minutes, we are still waiting for our order. Meanwhile 3 other customers come in after us and get their orders. We ask how much time its going to be and PoW snaps ""we can't tell you how much"". eh, what?

We wait 15 more minutes (We are in the restaurant for an hour at this point). People who came after us have ate and left. We ask PoW again and get the same answer. We want to cancel the order. Sweet server walks in, apologizes and offers a free papaya salad while the order is cooking.

PoW goes behind her back to make papaya salad EXTREMELY spicy (I am Indian, I can take spice) & cancels our red curry order.

First let's talk location. This place is in a funky building with the Can Can room next to it and Sapphire strip club down the way....

Inside is actually very well done. Nicely decorated.

Service was good and fast.

We ordered everything:

Hoi Jor - Really good! Huge portions

Crispy Rolls - Ok - but huge portions

Thai Dumpling - Very Good! Huge portion

Chicken Panang Curry - Good flavor. Very thin in consistency. I like when they are thicker

Chicken Green Curry - Good flavor. Still too watery 

Chicken Pad Thai - not very good....no flavor

Chicken Pad See Ewe - Good, good flavor

Chicken Drunken Noodles - Ok-noodles we over cooked. Not much in flavor

Kao Soy - Good flavor! If I wasn't so full - this could have been a winner. Still very watery.

Orange Chicken - Meh. Sauce was good but the chicken was overly breaded. 

Beef wrap - good. Different

Spicy Catfish - Pretty Good.

Pineapple Fried Rice - Bomb

Sticky rice - good

2646775,2015-04-17,0,w5CSi-An5meLnxjKSFn0wQ,"There is a range of how Americanized Thai food can be, and Thai Street Cafe ranges a little more on the ""Americanized"" side than a lot of Thai restaurants in Vegas.  They do it fairly well, but for me this place just doesn't have very exciting food.  

I ordered the green curry, something I tend to do on possible falsely rated restaurants on Yelp.  It came in a very strange sort of serving tray, split into fours and accompanied by a salad, white rice, and a veggie egg roll.  I had no place to pour my curry on the rice, so the serving style is definitely catered for Americans, which is fine.  I have to say though that the egg roll was my favorite part.  Not because it was particularly well done, but because they use honey in their sweet and sour sauce.  Yummy!

The curry, however, was a bit of a let down.  I ordered beef.  The beef was the typical strips, not particularly outstanding, but not tough and overcooked either.  The curry tasted like they add a lot of milk based cream.  I couldn't really taste any coconut.  It had the consistency of Alfredo sauce, which makes me believe cream was used (authentic Bangkok style Thai curry is soupy).  There's nothing really wrong with that; coconut milk is expensive.  But I want my curry to taste like Thai coconut curry, not weird Alfredo sauce.  The zucchini that they used gave it a nice touch, along with the traditional green and red bell peppers.  Overall though, the curry was a little too sweet and generic tasting, and very heavy.  I ordered a 7/10 heat, and it tasted more like a 2/10.  Yes, the heat levels are Americanized too.  

Very nice service, and very nice atmosphere (minus the strip club parking).  The food, however, isn't worth traveling to for me.  It's definitely Americanized, and while not offensive in any way, just not very exciting.",wOGfOjBaP-lCS1NW_En2LQ,5,3,3,IG95CvQh-Fu-VEl8BOH-SQ

The food we've tried has all been consistently good and tasty.  

Pad see ewe w/ Chicken.  Flat noodles with meat and broccoli.  Delicious.

Drunken Noodles w/ combination meat ($3 more) -  Nice sized shrimp, beef, and chicken.  Thick flat noodles with tomatoes, mushrooms, onions.  Very Good.

Red curry (first time with chicken, second time with shrimp -$2 more)  Shrimp is large.  The curry is very, very good and comes with a side of rice.  Spiciness level can be customized from 1-10.   Not much a difference from a 2 to 4 in my opinion.   4 could be considered hot to people who dislike spicy foods.

Chow mein w/ Beef-  Seemed to be a favorite from my co-workers.  

Thai Iced Tea-  WORTH $3.95.   So large.  So refreshing.  So tasty.    Also, ask for a free small thai iced tea with Yelp check in.

Papaya Salad-  Good portions, does not come with any meat.  Had it spicy level 6 and had a very nice kick to it.   

Chicken Satay- 4 sticks and comes with peanut sauce.  Pretty good.

Delivery service was fast.  Ordering might be the hardest part.  The first night an older Asian man answered the phone and his accent was very hard to understand when ordering by phone.  The lady that answered the next day for more delivery spoke much better English.

The entrees all are around $8.95 for a decent portion and they are open til 4 A.M.!   Perfect for us night shift people who get super hungry in the middle of the night.  Will be ordering from them again, I'm sure of it.",Mho2GibREwsPesKEyQbt8w,5,5,4,EqmO4fahhqgmO5LafefTyQ

Items Ordered:

- Pot Stickers ($6.95)
- Pineapple Fried Rice w/chicken ($8.95)
- Boat Noodles ($10.95)
- Pork Laab ($8.95)

Pot Stickers (4/5) (6 Pieces per order) Tasty dumplings served with a sweet soy sauce. Plenty of meat and tasted great bathed in the sauce!

Pineapple Fried Rice w/chicken (5/5) Tasted very authentic and plentiful in portion size! (I was actually telling my friend that the way they cook their chicken and their rice greatly reminded me of this little hole in the wall place we went to a few times, just a block away from the Grand Palace. Ahhh, I miss that place!) The fried rice included ingredients you don't necessarily find in some more Americanized Thai spots like raisins and cashews. I look forward to other variations of this dish in the future. Maybe some duck fried rice will be next!

Boat Noodles (3/5) I've never had boat noodles before so I honestly don't have anything to compare it to. The broth was a bit sweeter than I probably would have preferred, but was still quite delicious! Again, no complaints about portion sizes here! They serve you the boat noodles in a big ole' bowl! Very filling!

Pork Larb (4/5) For starters, they give you almost 3 times as much larb as what I received at Lotus of Siam a few weeks ago. The spice level was on point and made it much more satisfying this time around! Definitely having this again!

(+) No MSG! 
(+) Enjoyed the decor and got a good chuckle out of those bathrooms signs! Reminded me of the ones I would see at some of the nightclubs/bars in Bangkok
(-) Service was spotty. The staff was nice, but we had to hunt the waitress down to get refills for our drinks and to get our bill. There was only 1 other occupied table besides ours, so I didn't quite understand why that was the case. It wasn't terrible though and it certainly won't deter me from coming back.
(-) not much available in the way of parking. Luckily we went during a slow time.

I really enjoyed my meal here today and I think I could even say it is in my ""top 3"" Thai places here in Las Vegas for the time being! I will certainly be back to try some more menu items!

I tried to order on the Yelp delivery but that wouldn't work either!  they really need to get there delivery system fixed and there phone.

We ended taking taxi here which sucked. Only came because my boyfriend really wanted too! 

The restaurant was in a shady area but inside it was clean and open. Our server was polite and friendly. Food came out quick and the portions were big. We had the  hoi  jot (3/5 crispy but not much flavour just meat) , curry puff (2.5/5 crispy but the outside she'll was too thick and hard), spicy basil 7 spice (4/5), panang curry (4/5 the broth was nice and creamy lots of chicken and mixed veggies) and the Thai tea (5/5 rich and creamy perfect amount of sweet)

We order medium spicy on pad Thai, spicy basil meat and pad nang curry, and only the spicy basil I would call mild spicy and tasted good. The pad Thai is so sweet, the pan nang curry is so sweet too... We ordered fried tofu but it came with regular tofu. For the appetizer, it was the first on the menu, fried wenton with shrimp and pork inside. Fishy but crisp. The serving size is not big.

It's one of my favorite cuisines and I've eaten Thai food all over the world (unfortunately except Thailand). Up until eating here, my favorite Thai food was served at this tiny little Thai Cafe at the bottom of my street in London, run by an immigrant Thai family serving truly authentic thai food. Thai St Cafe is as good, if not better. The food is stunning. The portions are plentiful. The staff are lovely and friendly. The hours are 11am to 4am!! They serve Curry Puffs!! NOBODY SERVES CURRY PUFFS!! These things are delicious!! Anyway, I digress.
""Well, if it's so good, then why only 4 stars,"" you might ask. Well, the service is pedestrian to say the least. If you're in a hurry, do not go. Actually, the food is so good, you should wait!

Pad Thai (seafood combo) *spicy (5/5) was very delicious! The spice was a perfect blend to the sweet pad Thai sauce. The seafood was cooked to perfection, and the noodles were cooked perfectly. This goes for the chicken pad Thai too. It was amazing. One of the best I've had.

Pork spare ribs: 3/5 it's not what the picture looks like. I thought it was going to be whole ribs but it's ribs cut into bite sized. It was a bit salty. Not what I expected but flavor is good, just salty and a bit over powering 

Beef egg plant: it was good. I'd give it a 4/5. 

Pad see ew: good too, 3.5/5 

Thai teas are huge so I'd recommend splitting it lol. And this was really good too, doesn't taste watered down or overly sweet. Perfect.  

Note: they had us move to another table after we ordered Bc they got a call in for a bigger party and we (party of 6) were sitting at the table for 10+ so they had us move to another table.

The area is well lit... And located amongst adult stores and down the street from a few strip clubs. The decor is cute... And the restaurant is a decent size. It appeared that there were more people waiting for take out than dining it... But it was also almost 1am so it made sense. 

Being a vegan, there were some modifications to our order... Like no egg/butter in the fried rice, no shrimp
Flakes in the papaya salad, and
No shrimp paste in the curry. We were informed when we arrived that they saw the modifications and they didn't use shrimp paste in the curries... Yes! We sat down and waited... And waited... And waited... We went back up to the counter around 1:30 and asked for an estimate time... We were told ""soon"". Not wanting to piss anyone off and have something happen to our food... We opted to not mention the long wait time and sit back down. 18 min later... We walked back up to the counter... We placed our order online before we even got to the restaurant. From the time of arrival, we were had already been waiting 50 min. 
I was basically ready to just ask for our money back and go to vickies diner. 2 min later our food appeared in the window... And she gave my friend a Thai tea for waiting... 

We checked the order before leaving and noticed the fried rice had egg...  Not wanting to wait another hour for them to fix it... We left. The food is good. The service is horrible...

This is a nice little Thai spot and I'll be back for sure.

Real nice inside though, clean tables and quality dishes. Fun decor, laid back jazz music, and good smells made it pleasant inside. 

I was quickly greeted, seated, and served a drink. I wasn't ready to order when he came back with my large excellent tasting ice tea. The gentleman was quick to come back and take my order.  

Service could of been better though because he didn't come back to check in. I was the only one in the place at 1am but the employees with heeps of plates of food got more attention than me. I get micro portions compared to their plates! 
I ate every bite of my meal and no one checked in on me but instead brought me a check. Lol really. 
I only got an app so might of ordered more food or dessert, I should of been offered or asked if all was well before bringing my check.

Check your bill before paying! I asked for an ice tea to go since mine didn't get a refill towards the end and was empty on my table. Without saying anything he tried charging me $2 or more for the to-go cup of tea. Doh. Did take it off after I pointed out my displeasure and empty tea at the end. Do they normally charge for the to-go Styrofoam dishes for food, or just tea?

The steamed dumplings were amazing. Love it. 

Thai tea with boba. Also delicious. No complains there. 

Lost a star with the Pad Thai. Might be the worst I've ever had. I've never had pad Thai this dry before, I thought maybe if I stirred it up some of the sauce from the bottom would rehydrate the dry noodles but nope. It was also cold. The noodles were so dry they were stuck together like a block. Since I work in an office I don't have eating utensils and they only provided me with a flimsy spork that doesn't work with this dry, clumpy mess. Wouldn't be so bad if I had soy sauce to pour in it but they didn't give me any in my bag. (My bad for not asking when I ordered though) also no lime or lemon on the side to drizzle over. 

Very disappointed with that dish but am hopeful the next time i order something different it will be better.

With so many Thai restaurants in town, I keep trying a few a week and still never get close to finishing the list.  This one in particular was very interesting to try as the ratings were very good, but the area of town not so bright.  China Town is one thing, but the location of Thai St. Cafe on Industrial Rd. is a little off-putting.  The restaurant's inside is very nice but I wouldn't hang out outside.

I tried the eggplant and tofu and opted for 10 on the spicy level (top).  The level of spiciness wasn't over the top, burn your mouth, but it did make you sweat a little. The dishes I ordered seemed pretty similar though, as if they were all made in the same pot, with different veggies and sauces and meats added right before serving.  The taste and sauce were not mouth watering but still above average.

Not sure I will be back any time soon, but the prices are very affordable and portion sizes accommodating.  If in the area for lunch I would not turn down Thai St., but I will continue searching for the best Thai.",JaqcCU3nxReTW2cBLHounA,0,0,3,F_UijMNne4YadbaaXdkocQ

It is located in quite a sketchy area, but it is worth the visit.  Though if you are alone, I would perhaps visit in broad daylight.

I ordered drunken noodles with chicken (spicy level 10/10), tom yum soup, papaya salad, and coconut ice cream.  The drunken noodles spicy level was out of this world - I am a girl that can handle my spices and have never ever had a problem regardless of how spicy anything was, but I could not even finish this dish (the horror cause I always finish), and definitely experienced heartburn for the first time afterwards.  It was delicious and worthwhile though, just be warned.

The papaya salad had the fresh tanginess that I always look for.  The tom yum soup was flavored nicely (though I would recommend this dish a little less, as it is more soup and vegetables are more scarce).

Definitely recommend.  I can picture having some spice-offs here, though in the future, I would probably order a lower spice level.",6G8Kip9sGMwEL93FpzHMnA,2,0,5,wn41PU0e_qSjJdN8Hb2jEA

3450103,2016-07-30,3,w5CSi-An5meLnxjKSFn0wQ,"I preface almost every Thai restaurant review with this: My bf and I love Thai food. Well, he only orders chicken yellow curry every time, but the point is, we've had no shortage when it comes to our Thai food excursions. I can probably make an entire scrapbook of Thai cuisine, with half the pictures being chicken yellow curry. Go figure! 

Enter Thai St Cafe. I was excited, really! Their reclaimed wood interior evoked cleanliness and a downtown-vibe feel. You've seen the type -- all the new coffee shops love this look. To drive in the hipsterdom of it all, Thai St Cafe even plants a bicycle in the corner.

Anyway, stars for being clean and invitingly pleasing, considering the surrounding location of Sammy Davis Jr Drive (aka Industrial Road).

Now the service: absolutely none. We came in right after the lunch rush, so we were the only table there. It was empty. Our waitress left us with menus and took our orders and that was the most communication between us. No checking up, no ""how is everything?"" nada. We wanted to order another side of rice, so we had to go to the counter and ask another guy for it. No drinks refilled. It was only after we got our check she asked us. Why would we want drinks now, we're leaving...

Food: I had their Tom Yum soup with shrimp (up charge), which was served over fire. I got a 2/10 spicy level, but it still was on the spicier side. It's okay, I could handle it. Plenty of mushrooms and shrimp, but too many onions for my taste. I tried some of my bf's chicken yellow curry and we both agreed we've had better. Seemed unbalanced, more coconut-y than most places.

Ordered level 5/10 spice - not that spicy. The spice tray, particularly the hot pepper powder, was plenty to compensate though. 

Tip - tell them upfront to make everything less salty (unless you really like savory dishes), as Thai dishes are generally on the salty side.

Ordered the hoi jor ($8.95) appetizer - soft and flaky on the outside, crab, shrimp, and pork on the inside - prepared wonderfully! This chow Jo dish is hard to make and difficult to find at restaurants, and the last place we had it was not great, so this was a delight!

The kao soy ($10.95) noodle soup is also a hard to find dish, as it is more of a Thai home-cooking style dish that is rarer at Thai restaurants - the Thai place in my home town stopped serving it, so this really hit the spot! 

The drunken noodle ($8.95) and eggplant ($8.95) entree were very good, although you'll probably want to order an extra rice for the eggplant dish. Bring it to-go and make rice at home for a second meal! ;)

Also enjoyed the Thai phrases, decorations, and especially the drawings on the restroom doors of a man or woman peeing. Universal.

3618053,2015-09-15,0,w5CSi-An5meLnxjKSFn0wQ,"I know I have been consistently reviewing Asian restaurants and small cafes , but I am sorry, I am on this adventurous whirlwind of work stress and subsequent nightmares; aggressive allergies and having to repeat myself at least three times, to everyone I know. I don't have the time for my ""Paint the city Red"" reviews right now. 

I placed an online order from Thai St. Cafe and that part was super convenient and easy. Somehow, I am always annoyed when I know the place is across the street from where I am and I have to wait 60+ minutes for the delivery anyway. 

I had the following items:

Egg rolls
Dumplings
Chicken Chow Mein 
Total: $35 with delivery fee of $3 and a $5 tip.

I wrote very specific delivery notes on the order because my office can be a little hard to find and after placing the order, I immediately called the restaurant to reiterate my notes and told them exactly how to get to me. The hostess said she will relay this to the driver. Of course, when he arrived. he was at the other side of our property, about a mile from my office and I had to explain again. This just annoys me a bit. I already repeated it twice... so, really? You need it again? (See my note about repeating myself).

Eggrolls might have as well been frozen. Not the crispy, flaky roll I expect and get from my home girl at China Bobo. These reminded me of what I used to buy at Sam's Club, like 15 years ago. There was nothing memorable about the item. 

Dumplings smelled like farmed or defrosted fish before I even opened the container. Eating them, I did not taste the fish, but definitely smelled it. The taste of pork dominated the dumpling with every chew. I eat meat but I do not like tasting the death of the animal in my mouth as I chew its bits. That was a turn off and I did not eat more than two. The texture of the whole dish was very good and well presented. The plum sauce had a very distinct prune flavor and to me it was great, to some it may be too strong. 

Chow Mein was tasty and had a good amount of cabbage, carrots and green onion. The chicken pieces were HUGE and that was pretty much the whole dish. Sliced chicken breast (long way) dominated the dish, and it was sauteed and sprinkled with veggies and noodles. I ate most of the noodles and had a container full of leftover chicken. I have it the fridge at work, but I most likely will never eat it again and will leave it there because I feel badly for having to throw it out. 

The Chow Mein portion was actually pretty small now that I think about it. 
The 4-5 egg rolls were way smaller than usual so you are basically getting about 3 normal sized rolls for about $7 with tax and fees. Not worth it. 

I've spent many paychecks in Chinatown and in Summerlin on great Asian food -- this is not fantastic Thai food -- this is very generic Thai and ti servers its purpose..

 I understand that their portions and pricing are due to their proximity to the Strip, but again, Chinatown is 10 min away and there are some fantastic joints there. I can see this being a great place for hungry tourists, who do not want to pay the extortion costs of some of the Strip restaurants, but I would most definitely not make the trip from my neighborhood to eat here. 

Based on the items I ordered, the food was just meh for my taste buds.",-SWRw9-1ARVKLAWE0Sxw1Q,0,0,3,xYj_fYcxOehEW28mQuYLQQ

It's a cute little spot in a seedy area, part of the charm!  Walking in, it's nicely decorated with very friendly staff.
The Thai tea with Boba is huge, coffee as well.  And delicious.  Don't ask for lite or no ice, it'll set you back .50 or $1.  Understandable since it's a large drink.

The Thai dumplings were the best I've tried.  The sauce that comes with it is sweet and sticky. 

We also tried chicken fried rice and chicken panang curry.  The fried rice is typical.  Nothing special.  The panang curry was good but it needs to be spicier.  I was told spiciness depends on the customer but I wasn't asked.  What I had would probably be a 1 or 2, I'm told.  Personally I think it needs to be up there around a 5 to really taste like Panang curry.

Service lacks in attentiveness: it took a bit more than enough time to look at the menu to order and napkins weren't provided. However, if you pay attention and know anything about the food business, they were busy and lacking staff.

The food, itself, is worth it. I didn't think it'd be fulfilling, but it did the trick. We ordered the Boat Noodle Soup, Tom Yum, and Kao Soy (plus a Thai tea, which was almost 2x more than your normal serving, they don't skip out!). All the broths were delicious and full of flavour.
Let me tell you about the Kao Soy though. If you're ever conflicted with getting curry, noodles or soup, this is the dish to get: 
1) The broth was the best. The minty, basil taste makes this spicy(medium on the heat scale?), yellow curry-based soup refreshing. 
2) The eggs noodles were nice and firm, not undercooked or over cooked, wider than pho noodles but thinner than Pad Thai noodles.
3) The toppings were just right: a tender succulent piece of chicken that's been cooked with the broth, shredded crispy fried wonton noodles that add texture to the dish, and other stuff that weren't noticeable important (pickled veggie, cilantro, beansprouts)

3887278,2015-05-10,0,w5CSi-An5meLnxjKSFn0wQ,"I was in the mood for mango and sticky rice, and my bf loves Thai, so we came here a little before midnight on a Saturday night. 
  First, a word about the neighborhood- VERY dicey. It's in the strip joint part of the city, and they are clearly trying to catch the girls and the patrons as the clubs close for the night. Not a particularly safe area. However, their chosen location did not influence my review. Inside it looks very nice.
  So, we both ordered- 2 waters, 2 Thai teas with boba- mine with extra milk, 2 mango with sticky rice, and he ordered a medium spicy soup. Even though the girl was writing down the order, she repeated it back to us wrong, so we corrected her. That should have been a warning sign.
  About 10 minutes later, she finally came back out. She had forgotten the waters, and my Thai tea did not have boba or extra milk in it. We asked for our waters, and it took her several more minutes to bring them out. 
  Perhaps I should mention here- there were 2 other customers sitting at another table who were halfway through their meal and no one else. And there were 3 or 4 employees (we saw a male and female at the cash register and a male in the kitchen, and we were pretty sure we also saw a female in the kitchen). 
  So they brought out my bf's soup decently quickly, and when they did I reminded them that I had ordered the mango with sticky rice for my meal. The guy nodded his head and left. 15 minutes passed by while I watched my bf eat his meal before they finally brought me mine. When they did, they asked bf if he wanted his too. Thankfully, he said yes because within 2 minutes they had brought it to the table- translation, it was already done. If he had said no, it would have sat there on their counter getting cold and rubbery until they finally brought it out to him.
  Not even halfway through our experience, the other 2 customers left. Even though there were no other customers, they only managed to refill our waters once. And each time they brought us anything, we thanked them, but not once did either of them say ""You're welcome.""
  We finished our food. Bf's soup had almost been too spicy for him to handle even though he LOVES spicy food and had asked for medium spicy. We sat there. And sat there. And sat there... until finally we gave up on the idea that our waitress was ever going to come back to bring us our bill. We went up to the cash register where both our waitress and the guy who had brought out the food were standing hanging out laughing- instead of helping their customers, paid the bill, and left.
  Even though the service was atrocious, my boyfriend liked the soup. The mango with sticky rice was definitely not the best I've ever had, but it was okay. They gave us tall glasses of the Thai tea- these are the reasons for the 2 stars instead of just a 1 star review.

I came back from a night out and chose to order from Thai St Cafe instead of another Thai place because they were just across the street (I was at Treasure Island) and figured they would get to me faster. 

So at 3:20 AM, I placed an order for 2 Pad See Ew Noodles and 1 Young Coconut to meet the delivery minimum, totaling to $27.21 (+$5 delivery fee). So the waiting began. 

I called once and texted twice for updates, and it turns out that even though I was just across the street, there was another order before me that was far away, so they decided to drop that one off first! So my order finally got to me at 4:20 AM, when everyone else I was with was asleep. The delivery guy called me before he was even there, so I ended up waiting in the lobby for 5 more minutes. He took out a wad of cash and strangely offered me two dollar bills.......huh? And I was really confused and just told him to keep it.

The food was barely warm and there was no microwave in my hotel room. The beef was so dry that I ended up just eating the noodles and leaving everything else, and throwing out the second Pad See Ew. And they forgot the coconut!! I called them the next day to try to get a refund for the whole order, and they refused to refund anything. As for the coconut that they didn't even give me, they gave me the run-around and told me to email Eat24, who would email them.

I just can't believe I paid almost $30 for basically half a disgusting lukewarm Pad See Ew, and that it cost $5 and one hour to deliver it across the street! I would only recommend this place upon my worst frenemies. No matter what my friends say next time, I am only going to Marilyn's Cafe for late night food -- $5 steak and eggs!!",T1rP9rqslOh_72KI0IW7rQ,4,1,1,VOgphqRJxZ-c7cgS-OPf2A

For those not familiar with Industrial Road....there are many adult stores and strip clubs around. It's definitely not an area that I would go out of my way for but sometimes I make an exception, especially for some good eatery. Don't we all?

Ambiance was impressive. Far from the sketchy, ghetto-ness of its location and interior was very modern and hip. They even had a small stage with a microphone, I'm assuming they do some live performances? 

Service was friendly and efficient. No complaints here.

First thing that caught my eye when I opened their menu was their Boat Noodle Soup. My server had warned me that the soup is rich and creamy which I did not mind. I loved the thin rice noodle which sort of reminded me of Japanese udon noodles but a lot thinner. It was very smooth. Beef in this was super tender. Soup had the wow factor. It is a cross of beef stew and curry. It had that richness and flavor of beef stew, but with a spicy kick you find in curry. I highly recommend this dish.

Also got to try their Drunken Noodle. I have never had this before so gave this a try and it was good! Again, I enjoyed the rice noodle except this is a flat rice noodle. I liked the fact that it was mixed with variety of ingredients including tomato, mushroom, bell peppers and onions which not only made it filling but made it look vibrant and overall a better presentation. I recommend this dish also.

Thai Dumpling was easily forgettable. It's a steamed dumpling, similar if not same as Shumai. It was clearly a frozen dumpling that was heated before it was served. Sad to say but frozen Shumai from Trader Joe's (It's called Pork Shu Mai or Pork Dumplings, try it if you haven't!) is actually better in my opinion. 

I also want to mention that my water tasted odd. It had a soapy aftertaste. I'm used to the chlorine taste but my glass of water here tasted like it was mixed with dish soap.

They already got their tip because it was put on the cc when the order was placed. We were practically asleep already when it got there and all the delivery guy said was sorry.

From the outside,  it's a little shady,  especially considering the surroundings,  but the inside is actually quite charming. The decor makes it look like you're hanging out on a nice clean little street getting some truck food. The music was casual and seemed to all be acoustic selections from this Filipina singer Sabrina. Overall it had the feel of a nice cafe. 

No alcohol served here, but if you go to the liquor store next door and bring your receipt,  you can byob.

Anyway, foodwise, I wasn't quite as impressed.  We sampled a few of the appetizers and entrees.  The theme for the night:sugar.  On the menu it says that they're not believers of MSG, but it seems like they just add a ton of sugar to make up for it. The pad thai,  Thai boat soup, Tom yum, and panang were all super sweet, and the panang was even a little sour? The rangoon and Thai beef jerky were ok, but nothing special, and overpriced.

While we were there, there was a large (ie, 20 people) party that was very clearly a big Thai family birthday celebration. Our waitress even apologized for the noise, despite the fact that we were not at all bothered by them - after the raucousness of The Strip on a Saturday night, we were totally fine with more family-friendly celebrations.

Their menu wasn't super big. They had around 7 dishes for each category, such as appetizers, main dishes, soups, and desserts. We ordered the Thai Iced Coffee and Young coconut. Oh my lord, the thai coffee was sooooo amazing! It was really sweet, but they warned us beforehand and we still got it. It kind of taste like coffee and thai tea. The young coconut actually came in a coconut, not too sweet. We then ordered the pad thai and the drunken noodles. You can order the level of spice you want from a level of 1 to 10. We got the level 7 spicy for pad thai and it wasn't that hot. 

The food didn't take long to come out. The pad thai was very tasty and flavorful. It wasn't dry at all, and it tasted even better with some lime squeezed on top. The drunken noodles were ok. It tasted very plain and it just tasted like regular chow fun noodles. 
The price was ok too. The total came out to be around $28. And they're open until 4AM, so if you have the munchies, this place is great! It's kind of in a sketch area though...right next to a liquor store and a bunch of sex shops.",Qx7ebWeFBk1AIqT1mlvZ-A,1,1,4,ZIQZd174DMJxI3WqUaAWqA

The menu is pretty commonplace as most other Thai restaurants with your noodle/soup/entree dishes (along with some really nicely priced lunch items that go for about $7-9).  The most interesting item for me here was the rarer Kao Soy soup noodle dish.  With a very heavy, almost curry-like broth and a beautiful presentation (and for about only $11-12), it's a highly recommended item for anyone looking for something more adventurous and doesn't break the bank.  I also had the thai milk tea which tasted pretty good - loved that it came in a mason jar.  No alcohol that I saw to my knowledge though.    

The decor of the cafe was very modern and super clean.  At lunch time on a Friday, it wasn't crowded (although I do hear it gets busier as the night comes along).  Kudos to Honey for the terrific service/advice as well - really friendly and made me feel very welcome.  Parking wasn't too bad - just make sure to watch out for incoming traffic depending on how you're coming in.

- Drunken Noodles (Pad Kee Mao): 3 stars. While there is definitely depth and layers of flavor here, the sauce relied a little too heavily on the oyster sauce, in my opinion. It needed a little more fish and dark soy sauces, I thought. They stir fry the noodles with bell peppers, onions, tomatoes, and mushrooms. (Tomatoes and mushrooms have no place in traditional pad kee mao, but they weren't bad here.) The chicken in the dish was marinated spectacularly and not dry. This dish was also flaming hot, but I'll address that below.
- Yellow Curry: 4 stars. Thank you, thank you, thank you Thai St Cafe for not making your curries overly sweet. This was exactly what I expect from a good curry. The pork was executed well, and all of the vegetables were cooked perfectly. Of course, the curry comes with rice. No complaints here.

About the spice levels. I have no idea how their system works. I ordered the noodles at a level 7 and the curry at a level 5, and there was a huge, HUGE difference between the two. The curry was very mild, while the noodles were the spiciest thing I have ever eaten. I see a lot of reviews noting that the drunken noodles are very spicy, and I'm thinking it has to do with the particular types of chilies that they incorporate into the dish. But holy moley, it was HOT. Not the type of spice that gets your nose running and feels like warmth, but the type of spice that burns on contact, makes your tongue tingle, and makes the restroom an uncomfortable experience. I was literally yowling in reaction to the heat. I'd be very curious to see what it would be like at a level 5; I'm guessing it would still be much hotter than the level 5 curry. If I were to order these two again, I would do the curry at a level 8 and the drunken noddles at a level 4 or 5.

Thai St. Cafe is located just off the northern end of the Strip, and delivers (literally) some excellent food to get those starchy goodness into your body. I've ordered delivery as well as pickup from them, and it is a LOT quicker to do pickup. My first time getting delivery from them ended up in a 50 minute wait. You can bet that we were pretty drunk by the time the food came.

Some of the delicious items we've ordered include:
- Beef Larb (spicy and tangy, and comes in big portions)
- Seafood Pad See Ew (can't go wrong with these flat noodles)
- Chicken Red Curry (again, another winner!)

Each entree is around $10 depending on any added meats to the meal, making it an affordable dinner for you and your friends. I am getting hungry just thinking about them while listening to my electronic jams. If you are looking for a great place that is cheap and delicious, there really is no better place.

The location is very sketchy!!!!
Once inside, the decor and atmosphere are very nice.

We started with the Beef Jerky Appetizer. Not my fav! I should have known by the name ""beef jerky"" the meat would be tough and overcooked.
The Crab Fried Rice was really good, light and fluffy, perfect!
The Beef Noodle Soup was okay..... the broth was great! The noodles were good, but the meat was tough, full of grizzle, pretty much inedible.
The Shrimp Pad Thai was good, nothing spectacular. 
All in all..... difficult to rate for me..... the misses were BAD! But the hits were GOOD!

Waitress let us change the soup when we discovered this and was nice about it. The Khao soi soup is delicious (curry base)! Beware though- we asked for level 2 spiciness and that already had a good kick for someone who does not really do spicy (my mom was still able to manage though). The regular menu options(anything not on the lunch menu) are definitely for sharing (2 ppl... honestly even 3 if you are getting more than just one thing).

I was browsing yelp and really wanted some soup and some greasy food to satisfy my hunger. This place wasn't far at all and they also delivered. I gave it a shot and ordered everything through yelp. It was the quickest and most painless way to order. I had never had such an easy experience ordering.

The review gets better! I was expecting the food to be ready in about an hour or more, but within 40 minutes I got a call saying they were ready with the food by the elevator. I totally didn't expect it to be done that quick, let alone waiting for me downstairs. The food filled a void that made my inner child jump for joy and smile from ear to ear with glee. The soup was hot and delicious, the appetizers were crispy and tasty, the main course was perfectly cooked and seasoned. There were no complaints even if I had a bad day and a hidden agenda from here. Honestly, how could you? The food was amazing and the service is second to none. 

I ordered pretty basic items, but that's all I needed. The whole time while receiving the delivery and eating it, I was in awe of how easy it all was. The ordering was simple and quick. The delivery was fast and courteous. The food was good for a hungry, half hungover, lazy sob. The next time I'm in this situation, I would gladly rinse and repeat everything I done this day.

At first glance, the interior looks and feels contemporary and fresh. There are metal and wood finishes that are not too industrial-looking. My visit here was just okay and I will explain. The dining room sits many people, with booths along the walls and tables dispersed around the space. Despite the abundance of seats, there seemed to be just a couple of servers. I arrived for lunch in a party of 10. Understandably, the food was not expected to arrive quickly. We waited, however, almost an hour for the first dish to arrive.

But...this place has raging reviews & was the only thai that is open until 4 am (...and now we know why ;)) so I set aside my differences and went inside. 

TOTALLY different vibe inside. Wooden tables, artistic decorations, clean bathrooms and  FAMILIES sitting inside enjoying their meal. My sister and I ended up ordering the following: 

1. Crab Rangoons
*appetizer* This came in an order of 6...and it was pretty on par with other thai restaurants. Nothing too extravagant, and definitely nothing that made you turn back and wish you never looked again. 
2. Papaya Salad 
This type of salad is my MAIN. Shredded green papaya, green beans, little dried shrimp, and peanuts PLUS spice level 7.....mmmmm good. However, some of the shrimp were WAY too dried, and during one bite, I thought for some odd reason I was chewing a stone. I hope I didn't lose a filling, but here's to hoping I never have to find out. 
3. Pad See Ew 
My sister ordered this dish but with fried tofu - as stated earlier, it was on par (my sister likes her spice to be as low as possible, so this didn't have the thai flavor I usually crave) - but I'll blame that on my sister's taste buds and not on the restaurant.  

Overall, pretty damn good place. There's a lot more I'd like to come back and try - preferably during daylight hours, but it puts my heart to ease knowing that I can come in at 3 am and still be given good service & food.",n9zwrWp8EeB9ODTitKZYsw,0,2,4,qTE8LyHdB9kTeuDOmYVdZQ

I got task to find a good Thai lunch spot by my group. Browsing around Yelp, I came through this restaurant. It seems it's a decent place, so I sent info to everybody. We were all heading there ASAP because we were starving.

Upon arrival, we were surprised to find that the restaurant is located at the same row as Showgirl Supplies, 100 percent entertainment, Las Vegas Bikinis and liquor store (?) 

PARKING: FREE, limited parking, quiet area
ENTRANCE: a bit confusing because they have 2 (two) entrance doors but only 1 (one) works

INSIDE: surprisingly, inside is very modern, clean, organized with warm wood touch color and bamboo. Communal dining tables dominate the room.

RESTROOM: 1 (one) for each gender. Clean organized with supplies

DRINKS:
The Thai Ice Tea and Thai Coffee comes as twice the size of your regular cup, shareable.

FOODS:
###Yellow Curry: a bit bland, not too much meats
###Red Curry: better taste than Yellow Curry, more meats
###Tom Yam Soup: a bit flavorless
###Pad Thai: taste good, mediocre presentation
###Egg Rolls: crispy, taste delicious

SERVICE: fast, friendly, helpful

This is a good spot for quick lunch.",47BfAFyLpGflmR-pn7gmJA,43,44,3,5AHoL9M2q86Kwr6rejdTLg

4924538,2016-02-28,5,w5CSi-An5meLnxjKSFn0wQ,"Ok, idk where to start. This might just be my longest review!

Ambiance was comfortable. It was beautiful...inside. Outside, not so much. It's right next door to the Can Can Room. So if you get hungry after watching some naked ladies, you can always walk over to grab some Thai food. 

The music they were playing was a nice tone. Had to Shazam it cus it was cute. Top charted songs sang in acoustic by Sabrina. Mellowed out the mood, I like it. 

Now, my friends wanted beer. The girl at the register told us that if we wanted some alcohol we would have to buy some next door at XO liquor. So the boys got up and went to grab beer. lol. That's cool of her to tell us. Business buds? 

Anyway, the girl took our order. We got nervous cus we ordered a lot and she didn't write anything down. We expected her to forget something....and she did. B+ effort for her trying to play it off and telling us she was going to check on it. Hah. 

Ok, let's get serious. 
You have two huge foodies and a guy who knows 99% of the las vegas restaurant businesses that's tried everything walk in. (He owns a hood cleaning business.)  We all have high expectations, and were serious about eating. lol. We were hungry! Ok...

Ro Ti - YUM! Friend got their first and said it took about 20mins to get. By the time we got there, the ro ti got to the table. It was the best thing we ate there... 20 mins was worth it? Inhaled it in 2 mins. Friend only got it cus it was the cheapest thing. lol. $4.

We finally ordered everything else. 

Calamari - Not too bad. I felt like I bit into air for the most part. It's very light, and it was battered ok, but when you bite into it, the calamari was teeny tiny. Since they were all teeny tiny, we had a small hill of battered up small pieces of calamari. At one point I bit into a hard piece where I thought my tooth cracked. I spit that out quick. The sauce it came with was good though! About $8.

Beef Jerky - I actually liked this plate. The sauce made it much much better. Not too hard to chew, just right. It's beef jerky... This was about $8. 

Crab Rangoon - All it had was cream cheese. yeah...Not a fan of this, and I love crab rangoons! To be honest, the comment that Panda Express had more taste to their rangoons was said. I think this was about $8.

Boat Noodle Soup - This was a friends entrée. We all shared though. I felt like he had the most generous amount in this entree bowl. Lots of noodles and lots of beef. It was WAY sweet. Beef was pretty good and tender though and the noodles were yummy, but the broth it was in tasted too sweet. $11.

Beef Panang - This was my main entrée. Large bowl with an okay amount of meat. This, I believed was good for the buck. About $9 + Beef $1. Came with rice. Only thing about this plate was that it was sweet too. The waitress didn't ask me how spicy I wanted it. I thought to myself that maybe they had their way of making it. Gave it a shot, and I was not the happiest. I've had a lot of beef panang in my life, and I was sad that this didn't have spice to it at all. 

Tom Yum Combination - Ok, this was my friends entrée. He had HIGH expectations for this one. It's one of his most favorite dishes. Again, too sweet! He said there wasn't much in the pot. There were 3 mussels, and the rest were tiny pieces of  seafood chunks. He usually likes everything spicy, but again, we thought they made it a certain way and thought it was the reason the girl didn't ask. $9 + Seafood combination for $4. 

Pad Thai - This was the plate that the girl didn't get in our first order. We had to call her again to ask about it. My friend was really hungry so he got a second entrée on top of his tom yum. Which he knew it was going to be not enough. AGAIN, this was sweet. It was actually the sweetest thing we got. I felt like I put some sugar in my mouth. I couldn't eat too much of it just cus I felt like it was a dessert.  $9 + Combination $3. 


I was a bit disappointed with the food we got. I feel like someone had a sweet tooth that night in the back and made everything too sweet. Not one plate had a spicy kick to it at all. Don't get me wrong, I'm not a super spicy fan, but just a kick of it is what I like. I honestly came to try the mango and sticky rice dessert, but I realized it isn't mango season and didn't get it. 

This was the first time my friends and I didn't finish any of our plates, well, except the ro ti. Which was comped by the owner because I posted a pic on Yelp right away. THANKS! He called the server to do it. We didn't  take anything to-go. I do give places chances again, so I'm not going to say I wont come back. Maybe it was just bad timing. It was late in the night.

It was definitely cooked well done but had a very distinct burnt smell not only in the shrimp but throughout the noodles.

The service, however, is horrible.  The servers definitely need some kind of training.  

Example:  At a table of 6, the server brought out two curries--no SPOONS or silverware of any kind.  Seriously 10 minutes later the curries were still there.  Other diners were food-less and the curry lovers were still spoon-less.  One of our six, in desperation, went to the front counter and asked for a spoon.  They gave her ONE spoon!

2) Crab Fried Rice: Expensive but for good reason.  They use real crab meat and I thought it complemented the noodle dish perfectly.

The reason why I gave this restaurant a 4-star rating is because the service was very slow.  They only employed one person for the entire restaurant during lunch and while he was nice, he was stretched too thinly and I felt sorry for him.

The restaurant itself is gorgeous and the menus have pictures of everything (which is kinda cool since some places make the same dish in different ways). I tried the ground chili chicken as well as the beef and it was just bad, unfortunately. I bit into gristle on the second bite and couldn't have any more. There were string beans in the dishes that didn't go with the flavor, in my opinion. The worse part is that they didn't ask about our spice preference. The dish is supposed to be spicy in of itself, so I didn't really even think of it until I saw that it was ridiculously mild. Hot sauce wouldn't have fixed it. I took it to go for my husband, but even he ended up tossing it. The curry puffs, which I was excited to see on the menu, had a good crust, but the filling was terrible. Mostly tasted like mashed sweet potato. Way too sweet, no chicken to speak of and any curry flavor was masked by all the sweetness. The spring rolls were crispy but reminded me of the frozen ones from the grocery store. They had that odd, mushy interior and the flavor wasn't great.

When you try Thai food in its motherland, it's pretty difficult to find a place that satisfies your Thai tooth here in America! I don't know if it's nostalgia, or the craving for authenticity that draws me into Thai spices...other than the pure fact that Thai spice is inherently addicting to my existence! When youve had an amazing sexy bowl of khao soi in northern Thailand, you're hooked! And there's not many places that serve that heart warming noodle dish! 

Thai st cafe comes close! I'm all about the drumstick to maintain authenticity and of course the flavorful broth! This joint meets the standard! Pretty yummy! I actually cannot stop thinking about how it made me feel every time that spoon and chopstick of goodness entered my mouth! 

What I will dock off a star for is an unfortunate matter! MANGO STICKY RICE! I'm the largest fan of withholding the coconut milk! Just too much sweetness! The sweetness and sticky ness of the rice is more than enough. Butttt...I asked for the coconut milk on the side, and it came out drenched  and the sever insisted that it's for flavor! So I politely asked for just the sticky rice and mango. An unbelievably disappointing event happened after that! The rice was hard as a rock! And had zero flavor! I see why they drench it in coconut milk. I couldn't even enjoy it and it truly bummed me out!

My party ordered a bunch of everything: both the papaya salad and glass noodle salads were great. Beef jerky strips were good. Pad-see-ew and pad Thai were decent. I didn't especially like any of the soups or fried rices we ordered. Green curry was a pass for me. The mango sticky rice would've been fine had the mangos been sweet instead of crazy sour. Young coconuts and Thai ice tea were excellent. Overall, food was okay for me.

We had to split into two groups, at two separate tables since we didn't want to wait for one big table, and that's fine. It looked like it wasn't to busy, but almost all the tables were packed.

Food: OMG... Don't get the spicy food here. It was so spicy and my family and I eat spicy. They will ask you how hot you want it from a 1-10 scale, w/o warning you how spicy 10 is. We ordered the drunken noodles with chicken at a level 8, thai basil at a level 8 as well and both were so spicy for all of us, we could not eat more than three bites with rice. It The only good dish that we were able to eat was the yellow curry dish. That dish wasn't bad at all and it had a good amount of flavor. Again, only order spicy level of 6 or below. 

Service: They need more employees. Seriously the food was not coming out at the right time together and they kept mixing the items we ordered with our other table. There was a group of maybe 8 that had been seated for a while before us and they were just getting their food when we finished ordering. They did not give us our glasses of water for so long! And they are so bad with refills. Oh and beware, they run out of boat noodles and young coconuts sometimes... Like how they did with us. One of the waiters did not know this and turned in an order for a boat noodle for my aunt and we had to confirm with the other waiter that there was no more boat noodles. WHAT THAI RESTAURANT RUNS OUT OF BOAT NOODLES?!?!?!

Price: The prices aren't bad. But the amount given does not equate to the price.

Service was meh, I don't go to Asian restaurants and expect any type of service, they're not known for that. Ordered soft drinks and only the cans were brought out, no cup or glass of ice to go with the drinks. Food was mediocre. I don't get how people are raving about the food here. Maybe we came on an off day??? For appetizers, we had Hoi Jor and Chicken Wings. Both were okay, I think dim sum restaurants have them beat in that area.

If you ever get food delivered I HIGHLY suggest calling them as soon as you place the order and reminding them That you have placed a order, otherwise you will be waiting an extremely long time. This happened 3 times to me, I put up with it as at the time I didn't have another Thai restaurant close enough to deliver.
The breaking point was my last visit with the food quality once again lowered and became very average.
The server even charged me extra for beef pad see ew noodle, come on its always beef ! 
Also when you check in you get a free Thai iced tea, two times they denied me saying I had to dine in when I was picking up food and when I finally was dining in the last time they said oh no it's for the small Thai tea and charged me for the drink I ordered anyway.
Don't bother having a check in gift if you are not willing to give it to your customers and don't add a heap of extra charges it just makes the customer feel ripped off.
I also had a soup on my last visit they light  it on fire under neath which had a cool effect however the chief must of put far to much fuel and the fire kept going over the bowl and burning me, all my arm hairs were burnt off. In the end I just moved it to the side of the table and waited till it stopped which took a very long time and made the effects really more of a bother.
I mentioned this to the server but they didn't do anything.
I can honestly say I have eaten here a min of 10 times previously and I will no longer eat here any more, a combination of feeling ripped off, bad customer service and the tipping point of the food getting worse was the cause.

We had the pad thai shrimp and red curry with chicken.

I absolutely loved the red curry.  I love spicy food and the level of spice was just the amount I love for that tingle but not so much that you've lost all other flavors.  It balanced the savoriness of the cocounut.

The only time that I have sat in at the restaurant was my most recent visit. And I must say, they may have gotten 4 stars if I stayed using take out instead of sitting in. 

The only dish that I have tried here is their drunken noodles. They use mushrooms in theirs, which is different from the other Thai places that I've tried. The overall flavor of their drunken noodles is very good as well. It just meshes so well together. It reminds me of a pad see ew spin off. It has a tiny bit of sweet to it and it would taste especially good when I got it spicy. I usually get a level 10 spicy. 

On my most recent visit, my boyfriend and I decided to go for dinner because I was craving for their drunken noodles. We got there at around 545pm so it wasn't busy at all. The dinner rush hasn't started. There was maybe about 2-3 tables aside from us. But the service was so slow throughout the night. 

I ordered drunken noodles with chicken while my boyfriend ordered their pad see ew with beef. It took a while for the dishes to come out and when it did, they decided to give me shrimp instead of chicken. So I had to get them to re-do the dish. I also had to ask for chopsticks twice and even then, we had to get up to go to the register to even get it cause they forgot about it. They never refilled our waters. And when it was time to pay, I just took it to the register myself instead of waiting for them to grab my card. At that time, there was only one table aside from us. I just don't understand why it's so slow. 

I'll definitely go back for their drunken noodles but I'll only do take out or delivery. I don't think I can sit down at their establishment again. Plus, parking sucks so I rather just grab and go anyhow.",oqTZC9WriodTCby6jl0LfQ,2,2,3,DfeNKyXb_QWs13ucIH0f6w

This enigmatic dining experience is quite possibly located in the most culturally flexible location in the world. 

It's fair to recognize that this project delivers an experience for all of the human senses: 

1. I can ~hear~ a parlay of different native languages layered with a consistent orchestra of ambulances and occasionally in this symphony you hear the disparity of another patients financial or romantic situation. 

2. You can ~see~ transcendence in the the staff. The transparency of their service and the tranquil demeanor their team chemistry is great for their transient consumer base. 

3. You can ~feel~ the difference between a spicy level 4 and a spicy level 5 

4. The ~taste~ is great 

5. The ~smells~ are particularly intoxicating. there is a lot of balance in their acidity levels. And the aromas in this venue are PHat

The food is good. Service was decent. I got chicken pad Thai number 7, and it was pretty spicy. Spicy levels are from 1-10.  We also got chicken fried rice and orange chicken.
The last review for orange chicken I saw was complaining that there was a lot of sauce. My orange chicken was more like caramelized in the sauce. There was more fired dough caramelized in the sauce than chicken.

If you list the ingredients on the menu then it should be in the dish. I also had to wait 24 minutes to get my beef salad. It took over 40 minutes to get my final 2 dishes, drunken chicken and larb. We had asked for medium spice for both dishes but instead got mild. My girlfriend said that she enjoyed the flavors of the dish. I agree, the dishes are good but one dimensional in flavor. 

Thai food is built in layers. You add spices, chili, savory meats, and layer additional flavors by adding crushed peanuts, bean sprouts, cilantro, and mints. Eating each dish was like getting a good hamburger, bun, and cheese but leaving out the onions, lettuce, tomato, pickles, mayo, mustard, and relish. 

Considering the options in the Las Vegas area, I would recommend that you give this place a try.  It's worth a visit but don't expect to be blown away by authentic Thai flavors.

Meanwhile there were about 3 tables in the restaurant-that was it. Then the table they sat us at was broken and wobbly anyway. Ridiculous. We asked to be moved and they agreed but were clearly annoyed by it. Our food then took FOREVER to come out, even a couple who came in after us got their food before us...????

Then on to the food. I got the Pad-see ew because it looked so awesome in the pictures. It was not as awesome at all in real life. It was okay, but nothing amazing. It could have been a lot better. Noodles were plentiful and chicken was not. They put broccoli stocks in there instead of actual broccoli heads like they said on the menu.

Yeah, it's in the shopping center that was featured on a show about an undercover sting operation to bust pimps who have their offices here, but the restaurant is fine. Parking is tight, but they have the cheapest delivery minimum in and around the Spring Mountain area for Asian food.

I've ordered take out, pick up & eaten in house here. Portions are on the smaller side but non seafood entrees run between $7-10. 

The restaurant is clean and modern. Wait staff was attentive and the food is good. 

Honestly, if you order online, your food will be much spicier (I order 10/10) when they can't make snap judgements about me like what happens at every Asian restaurant.

Ordering spice level vs actual spice level:
 9/10 in house = 3.
10/10 online = 10. One time it was more like a 15, but that was only one of many orders I've placed here.

The decor is clean and sharp. Very modern. 

Weird to say, I loved the actual dishes. They were very different in a great way. 

We had Tom Kha hot pot soup. I am in love. I don't live here and I don't know how I'm going to live without it. It was pretty hot, but in a good way. Next was the curry, I don't remember the name but it started with a P. It was great with tofu. We also ordered the orange chicken. That was super crispy, which was really nice. Drunken noodles with beef finished our meal. We ordered the heat level at a 4. That was a little too much for me (I'm a Wisconsin girl). The Thai iced tea was the biggest surprise. What a treat! Just order it, trust me.

Thai boat was the worst ever. It was so sweet, it tasted like sugar. There's no balance at all and it was hard to finish, even added lime and spice couldn't save it. 

Tom yum soup was totally watered down. Couldn't believe they called this tom yum. 

The pork spare ribs was extremely salty and very DRY. It wasn't braised or cooked to tender as I expected and it should've been. 

Beef Pad Thai- you can't go wrong with it. But it was wrong. The beef was extremely chewy like rubberband and the cut was so thick. The sauce was lacking and barely any flavor. 

Only thing was good was fried tilapia fish. But then again you can fry a tilapia dish at home and it'll taste good. A 10 year old can cook this dish.

As for service, there was none because everything took so long. Probably because there was only one server and there was one other table.

As for the food, although their flavors are extremely noticeable in their food, and it tasted great... their spice range is way off!!
Per usual, they always ask what spice level do you want, on a scale from 1-10. I ordered a 4, even though I LOVE spicy food. But oh my goodness, that was the SPICIEST ""4"" I've ever seen. 
So since the food actually tastes good, I recommend you order like 5 levels lower on spice that you would normally order.

Went here over the weekend with one other family.

PROs--Off the strip, so not as busy.  Food was ok, but I have had better Thai food.  The staff was friendly and accommodating.  I had the spicy fried rice, which was just ""so, so"".  The orders came out in a timely fashion too.

CONs--For starters, the waitress asked, on a scale of 1-10 how hot I wanted my rice. (10 being highest).  I said 10...but it was not spicy at all, not even a little bit.  They DO NOT serve alcohol.  I felt like having a Singha beer, but they don't have anything.  The only TV they had was not on, as I was looking forward to watching some sports.  Portions are very small too.

Would I go back?  No, if Las Vegas has plenty of anything (aside from casinos and strip bars), it is places to eat.  There are many Thai places in Las Vegas, so I encourage people to go elsewhere.  Simply put, the food just wasn't that good.",bKNTJ6GNbi_Ry0AQRc5ZPQ,0,0,2,yy4bFX_deYvKLMPEKk7_YA

Actually, you don't really need to stop because you can order delivery right from the Yelp app, and that's what I did last weekend, twice.

The delivery minimum is $20, which is easy to hit if you're ordering for two or more, or if you're like me and ordering for one, but it appears like you are ordering for two or more. What can I say, I love to eat.

For me, I always order the Phad Thai on the first go. If they have good Phad Thai, in my humble opinion, the rest of the menu usually goes over quite well. My first round I ordered that and the Panang Curry. The second delivery of the weekend consisted of the above, with the addition of Crab Rangoon. 

Clearly the Phad Thai and Panang Curry were real winners, having ordered them twice in one weekend. The curry was rich and creamy and the chicken tender. The rice was served on the side and is just the right amount of sticky. The Phad Thai is like a spicy noodle hug. The Crab Rangoon? A well designed and mixed filling with a lightly browned and fried exterior. If you're not a fan of the sweet chili sauce they serve on the side, we can stay friends. I am an aggressive dipper and I need it all to myself.

The wait time for delivery can be a bit intense, 60-90 minutes, but just plan ahead. With it being Friday and all, perhaps I'll take my own advice and plan ahead for a round three.",NhgU7RhuYYFmpkb1jlYJ6Q,23,16,5,M7wLvKFNiZ_EmiUxvzR0uQ

*Came for lunch with my D-school peeps. Prices are reasonable. Portions are generous. Lunch specials are available.

*The place is clean, almost too clean. Decor is modern.

*Curry puff was not good. Pastry was dry, curry was dry. The curry filling was essentially a crumbly mass of bland stuff.

*Boat noodle soup: What I ordered. An interesting take on beef noodle soup. It didn't taste like Taiwanese beef noodle soup, pho, bun bo hue, nor galbitang. It was much stronger with a strong dose of sweet. I suspected the culprit was some sort of plum-like sauce, but wasn't able to confirm. My table-mates loved it. I, on the other hand, get very angry when things that aren't supposed to be sweet are sweet. (Korean wings, I'm looking at you.)

*Tom kha: very milky, very sour, just the way I like it. Mushrooms, onions, cilantro, and onions were plentiful.

*Spicy basil: took one bite, approved of the seasoning and the spice. Rated 4 stars by friend.

*Red curry: took zero bites. Rated 5 stars by friend. However, she found the 8 out of 10 spice level she chose to be inadequate. If you can handle the heat, even a level 10 here would barely have you breaking a sweat.

*Highlight was the Thai tea. Free with Yelp check-in. Served chilled in a huge mason jar. Fantastic blend of tea and milk. 

*In the sea of Thai places in Vegas, this one fits right in as being perfectly (and slightly) better than average, but memorable more for its look than for its food. I've had much better in Cali. Must be the Vegas inflation again.

As a bonus there is a liquor store next door so you can get a bottle of wine to go with your Thai!",Wo4A2CZ1QDBxHAOFjJtlzg,0,0,5,Mf56zS9We69ThjnDWsEQMg

My woman is more of a Thai eating person than I am but I will admit the food here is very flavorful I love how you can taste the flavors of everything in your meal. The food is definitely delicious here if you love Thai food come here you won't be disappointment. Heck even if you want to just try something new you would definitely love it here. And it's close to the strip. It's nice and chill setting it's very calming nice music good servers and great food! Thanks",vs8A477vXtN3z_v1KGLsYg,0,0,5,o7AcXt3XiJdtrr-79SoE5Q

I have a soft spot for khao soi. A good one is so hard to find in the US. This isn't the best I've had but it's up there in the top 3. The texture of both the soup noodles and the fried noodles was on point and the soup had a lovely coconut curry flavor. Each bowl came with one large chicken leg. Yum! 

It hit the spot and I slept so well afterward.",2HchhLgGj16aITZGVy0hqA,1,0,4,vgxLtQ7evkRh_Q0lofbL-A
5966638,2017-05-04,0,w5CSi-An5meLnxjKSFn0wQ,"One of my favorite Thai Places to order out from! It's close by and opened late hours. I even ordered once at 30 min. to closing and they delivered with exceptional service, came right up to door with a smile and my two dishes, an appetizer and complimentary Thai Tea! Sorry about the late order....but I was starving.
Anyway, my recommendation is the drunken noodles and the TomYum, but I may be biased because I love TomYum and will order it at every Thai place to see the variations. The Tom Yum here was good, although, I wished the flavor was more robust (?) Perhaps I just love strong lemongrass, galangal root and a tinge more spices flavor. 
I also ordered their glass noodle salad and the pad woon sen, - both of which I loved. 
I've never dined in, but the ambience is relaxing and looks like a good place to bring a few friends for lunch or dinner.",TXbIl_9ogHdALGlqYl3NvA,0,0,4,9XHJ09o4ZVDcxIaISgtbzQ
