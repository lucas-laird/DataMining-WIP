8105,2012-10-27,0,TTpgjbrSyxwHHzE5bIF-Rw,"Myself and Wife had visited Vegas for ??? - Yes Pure fun and stumbled on Namaste Indian Cuisine. It was the best food we had in Vegas. The owner Melque was so kind and attentive and always going out of way to make us feel comfortable. The food was of course amazing and me being Vegan - I was just amazed at the choices. So we decided to go back again before we left Vegas for Buffet and the food again was just excellent. Everything was fresh and service always the best. To top off the wonderful food - Melque( the owner - a professional singer ) also sang some beautiful notes for us and made our lunch special. So what can you ask more - Good food - Good Music and Good Ambiance. We will surely be back when we are in Vegas - We miss you Melque!!!!!!! and of course the wonderful food - Please open one in Denver CO and we will be your loyal customers!! Keep up the great service and food.

The lunch buffet was about to close in 30 minutes when we walked in and i felt we were late for the lunch. The ambiance was ok and staff paid attention when we walked inside. The owner of the restaurant was also working along with restaurant staff. They have very limited number of items for the lunch buffet. The food in the containers was about to finish and we asked the waitress to get the food. I liked the curry with boiled eggs and it was perfect combination with Naan's. The food is not so spicy and the price of the buffet was ok. I guess we shouldn't expect spicy Indian food in a city like Las Vegas.

681166,2012-11-24,2,TTpgjbrSyxwHHzE5bIF-Rw,"I have been to many many place and tried various Indian Restaurant and this can be ranked the top in terms of
- Pathetic Customer Service
- Horrible quality of food
- Worst Customer Service/ under staffed...
- Shabby decor
Still trying to think if there was anything good that I could write regarding this restaurant

Here are some more details

1. We wait for 10 minutes before Glass of water was served.. oh and best part had to call two to get some water refill....

2. The waitress (I think also the owner) was so cold and promptly said they have none of the appetizers that we wanted as they were running very busy however the place had not more than 10 people at around 6:30 pm.

3. Finally ordered food and mentioned that it should be mild as my little one was eating. Food was awful (wish there was any worse adjectives to explain this) and was spicy.

4. Oh the best part, food arrives after another 40 minutes.

5. Now the food
- Cold
- Rice was lumpy and yellow and tasted weird.
- The naans - Tough, full of flour and bad.

Guys and Gals if you still think that you want to try this??. I understand Indian food and suggest you never visit this if you nothing else to do and waste money. This is something I never right. but the service and lack of even remorse or feel bad was far from being even thought off.

Finally the best part, they donot even have a pen to sign. I had to go to the counter to get the check after waiting for another 10 minutes.

I am sure if health department made a surprise visit even more fun stuff could be revealed.",AGNULwBm97WBEbkJIBXOBg,2,1,1,MYPHuOgJAeVKivC7NzsxOA

Melque, the owner, is extremely nice and attentive to all customers. I highly recommend this place to locals and anyone traveling to Las Vegas who is interested in great, traditional ""Goa"" cuisine for a reasonable price.  Lastly, I want to share with the yelp community that it's appropriate  to tip the servers on the original food total.....I have witnessed three times now people who come in with a Groupon and don't want to tip AT ALL!!

After reading great reviews we decided to try this place. We made reservations which were not needed because he were the only ones in there. 

I ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala, he ordered the Chicken Vindaloo, this little lady came up to us and recommended the Chicken Biriani rice, and a side of garlic naan. 

WOW the chicken biriani rice I have never tried anything like that, the flavors were just amazing! They made the vindaloo mild, but it definitely still had a good kick to it. The masala was delicious with a creamy tomato sauce. The naan was hot and fresh. I would have however done without the masala we could have just ordered the biriani rice since it is an entree, and the vindaloo. 

Then the lady sang some beautiful songs for us, the chef came out and started singing as well. The food was delicious the experience was even better.

The butter chicken was very flavorful and rich, saag paneer had firm paneer chunks and chicken tandori was juicy. They had a decent amount of selection and the food was warm/hot. 

The lady that was serving us was nice and friendly. My only problem with this place is that they put a lot of cream into the buffet (a trick used get customers full faster) and you can feel that when you're done eating. Their masala chai was very bland as well and just tasted like plain tea. 

In all until I try their dinner menu I'm not overly impressed with this place but I have to say their nan bread is one of the best ever and we will go back just for that.",H1fcbC-WKsbiEo8BBVkHwA,2,0,4,zubpEfZpo1Yr19ZCI3xV8w

852492,2010-05-24,0,TTpgjbrSyxwHHzE5bIF-Rw,"Waking up late on a Sunday afternoon, and influenced by the Wife and some comments from Misti Y, we decided that our first meal of the day was going to be some Indian food at Namaste.  The restaurant is located in the Commercial Center right next to Lotus of Siam.  We were reassured to find the place packed full of hungry eaters, mostly of Indian descent (We later found out that most of the diners were from a tour group).  We were a bit worried about how we were going to score a table.  Luckily, there was one empty table to be found near the end of the buffet line.

The food looked and smelled incredible.  I was starving, but I had to wait in line.  There was so much to choose from for this $8.99 lunch buffet.  I just followed suit and placed whatever everybody else ahead of me was grabbing:  I couldn't stop dipping my hot buttery naan into the green chutney.  It was tangy with a minty finish.  I also enjoyed heaps of my favorite Saag Paneer (creamy spinach with chunks of cheese).  Usually, at buffets, I find the Saag Paneer to be dried out, but here it was very wet.  For meat, I really liked the goat curry.  The meat was pungent and very tender.  The sauce was tasty and spicy and compliment well with the rice.   The dish that I did not enjoy was the chicken curry.  Those pieces of chicken breast was so dry, even though they were submerged in all that curry sauce.

This is great place to go for an Indian lunch buffet.  We will definitely be back.  I hope to return for dinner at least to sample my other favorite Indian dish....lamb biryani and wash that down with a mango lassi.",Zr4N9sG31fybEa-l3a_46Q,3,1,4,LZA22cwqC6OHTJLHoltUpQ

But oh, everything brightened when we walked into Namaste and tried their $9.99 lunch buffet.  Every single item tasted excellent - we filled our plates with all kinds of delicious things like butter chicken, navaratna korma, aloo palak, masala mutton ... and then the waiter brought us a basket of fresh hot butter naan to the table.  Oh yeah!  But it got even better, several minutes later, he brought us a freshly cooked plate of uttapam - yes you read that right!   We love South Indian snacks and it's just not so easy to find that here in Vegas.  That little touch pushed us into masala bliss!    The other cool thing that will draw us back for a dinner is that they serve quite a few Goan specialties, such as chicken xacutti and Goan shrimp curry - all quite amazing and different from their Northern Indian style counterparts.

Outside of it being in Commercial Center (a relatively seedy side of Vegas) this restaurant rocks.  The interior of the location is very dark and ominous and absolutely perfect for a romantic evening.

We were greeted by the owner who was an energetic as possible.  Our drink orders were placed and delivered within a short amount of time and then the waiter assisted us with our dining options.

We decided upon a Lamb Josh, Garlic Naan and the Butter Chicken.  I have had butter chicken before, but none as succulent as this.  This was very fragrant, juicy and just downright delicious. It has to be some of the best Butter Chicken I have ever had, hands down.  The Lamb was also very tasty and was not heavy at all. The Naan was also very good.

Very few restaurants make you want to try everything on their menu at least once...this is that place.  The food is addictive and when coupled with the ambiance of the location, it just made it a downright special place to go.

While the food that was there was very flavorful, there was not much selection. My wife thought it was a little spicy, which means it is just right for me. The signs above the food told the name of it, but not being famaliar with Indian food it didn't mean anything to us. They could put a brief explanation of the food on the card to help us. Maybe next we'll try dinner as the menu has descriptions. The only reason it got 3 stars not 2,was the service. The owner I think was also the server and the entertainment, she sang during the meal.

Our entrees were following: Butter Chicken (very good), Saag Paneer (nothing special), Goan Shrimp Curry (my favorite out of our choices, exceptionally good), Lamb Tikka Masala (also good), Chicken Vindaloo (did not try, but rest of the party enjoyed).

2207336,2009-11-22,7,TTpgjbrSyxwHHzE5bIF-Rw,"THE BEST INDIAN FOOD IN VEGAS!
My girlfriend and I were accidentally one of the first people to eat at Namaste. We were in the area and are very familiar with the great places in the tucked-away Commercial Center. As I recall we were considering going to Komol, one of our favorite Thai food restaurants and hangouts, when we saw that Namaste was finally open. We both love Indian food as she primarily eats vegetarian and Indian restaurants are easy targets for us.

THE LUNCH BUFFET FOR $9 IS NOT TO BE MISSED! Indian buffets are hit-or-miss. Some will put out the standard dishes and only have one or two really yummy entrees set out. Not Namaste! They pull out all the stops and have many favorite dishes out at the same time. 

Mind you, the place is new, and many new places will start out this way and then go downhill, but I don't think this will be the case with Namaste. Chef and owner, Om Singh, has a reputation that precedes him in the culinary world and I suspect that the quality at Namaste will endure.

We have eaten here many times since it has opened up and every meal has been outstanding. Most notably, the VEGETARIAN DINNER FOR TWO ($40) is perfect. From the first course to the last it is exceptionally yummy. The main courses are all super good and it was so plentiful we had a lot of left-overs for lunch the next day. And the dessert, especially the carrot one, is REALLY GOOD.

The wait staff is very friendly and are constantly circling the floor. The atmosphere is decent and comfortable. I attend a discussion group every Sunday afternoon and we usually go out to dinner afterward. Komol is one of our regular haunts, but now it seems that Namaste will be our new default location.",_fFpucW8mSKvFJ46zSJCrg,32,13,5,Fho3wR9Avp-7F9XdE6GvcQ

2379504,2010-12-19,1,TTpgjbrSyxwHHzE5bIF-Rw,"We got free tickets to a show at the Hilton last night and were looking for a restaurant to try in the general area. I've read a lot of good reviews for Namaste so we decided to give it a try. 

I had thought about going there a couple of times but could never bring myself to do it. I love LOS and just couldn't imagine walking past LOS to go to another restaurant. I'm glad I decided to do so last night.

We ordered garlic naan, chicken biriani (waitress' suggestion/house specialty), paneer malai (cheese in a creamy onion sauce), and kheema mutter (ground lamb in a curry sauce).

We were given papadum to start. It was good and I really liked the mint chutney that accompanied it. I wasn't as fond of the tamarind chutney, but that's because I'm not a big fan of tamarind.

My wife had a mango lassi. She said it was good but that she's had better. She prefers hers a little thicker and sweeter.

The garlic naan was good but was a little under-cooked and doughy. The chicken biriani was my wife's favorite. I liked it quite a bit, but it was a tad too minty for me. My favorite was the lamb curry. I thought the flavors were really well-balanced. The paneer malai was our least favorite, though we still liked it quite a bit. It was a tad sweet for me. They also gave us regular naan which was good and buttery.

About half way through our dinner, the waitress began to sing. She had a really nice voice. Because of her accent, some of the words were a little off on pronunciation or cadence, but overall I enjoyed her singing. My one complaint was that she had the volume up pretty high, which made it very hard to talk while she was singing. She only sang a few songs though, so it wasn't too disruptive.

Overall, we enjoyed our meal quite a bit. Next time we're going to try the lunch buffet which one of the waiters recommended (as do a bunch of Yelpers). Namaste's pretty close to my office so if it's good, I may become a regular.",wc4XAA5pC3b1UgooSypHwA,2,1,4,-nyeVZPD-VWYEgqgmeVeEQ

The menu showcases Goa's fabulous cuisine, though there are plenty of standard Indo faves (samosas, tandoori chicken, etc.). The Dahl Tadka is the Indo version of a hearty lentil soup with lots of garlic, onions, spices and several other ingredients that make you go Mmmmmmmmmmm. The Shrimp Xacutti is the spicier, Indo version of Thai Red Curry... though, in my opinion, it's much yummier (I may be biased) than its Southeast Asian cousin, and the garlic naan was perfect -- not too much garlic, but just enough so you can get a hint of its flavor. All in all, the food was excellent, as was the staff, who were accommodating and friendly. 

Of course, the zen atmosphere in Namaste was shattered as soon as we stepped outside onto the pavement with our piping hot take-out.

The Chicken Tikka Masala was filled with HUGE chunks of dark meat chicken. I'm not usually a fan of dark meat but Indian cuisine usually gets it to really blend with the sauces and spices. This wasn't the case here - it was like tasteless brown meat dipped on sauce.

3454416,2012-07-22,6,TTpgjbrSyxwHHzE5bIF-Rw,"Namaste's lunch buffet is bomb with their decent selection of hot and cold food items, but how's the food and service like during non-buffet hours? I dropped in several days ago to have dinner there, so here's a review update.

FOOD
To dine there during lunch buffet hours will cost you $10.99. It's AYCE and you receive a free basket of Naan bread.  During non-buffet hours, you'll of course have to order off of the menu. Entrees can be pricey for the portions and can range from $12-$16. Also, you'll receive a side of rice instead of Naan bread. 

+ Paneer Malai: I was wavering in my decision to choose which would be the best dish:  the Saag Paneer or Paneer Malai? The Saag is always good, and it's usually available during the lunch buffet but without the paneer, but the Paneer Malai isn't. I'm happy I went with something new, because now this is one of my favorite Indian dishes.  A  sauce made with onions, tomatoes, cilantro, and chunks of paneer -- it's absolutely delicious. I could easily eat an entire bowl or five by myself. No shame. 

+ Butter Chicken: This is another item that's sometimes available during the lunch buffet, but decided to order this becauseI'd been craving Butter Chicken for the longest time. Ordered this with a medium spicy level, which was just perfect. Still loving the creamy sauce and the tender chicken. Just as good as when it's served during the lunch buffet.

+ Kashmiri Naan:  A mix made of cashew nuts, cherries, and coconut is spread thinly on the inside the Naan. In my opinion, this is more of a dessert bread that I would eat on the side rather than with my meal; although, you could still dip this bread into curries and other savory dishes, because it doesn't conflict with any of the flavors. 

SERVICE
Great as usual. No complaints here. I've always experienced excellent service whenever I visit. 

OVERALL
Food and service at Namaste remains exceptional no matter what time of day. This is why Namaste is my go-to Indian restaurant, and perhaps one of my favorites to dine at in Vegas.",epkRB3J_oBEiyiwahvdmGg,16,9,5,tvvtgL8mSPh-Jv4eyTRDuw

I shared the Yelp link with all and we were waiting with anticipation to partake in a bevy of curries and mop that up with Naan.

Namaste is really well done up. Dark wood paneling, soft muted lighting, cosy booths...I can see how this place could be the setting for quite the romantic date night (although Indian food may not be something you want to be eating on the first few dates!). Melque (?) the owner was very very personable. She checked up on us multiple times and sang a song (""Ungforgettable"") during lunch. Yes, it was a little strange and hard to talk to my table but she did have a good voice and she's just so sweet. 

Now the food...I only ate vegetarian since...I am vegetarian...a fairly extensive selection at Namaste so that was really nice. There were the usual salads and chutneys all of which were very fresh. The Navaratan Korma (mixed vegetable curry) was really really good, the soft basmati rice with peas also very comforting and the dal makhani was creamy and tasty. I wasn't a fan of the Uthapam and Sambar. The Uthapam was too sour (I guess the batter fermented a little too long) and I'm reiterating my usual complaint that no restaurant knows what Sambar is in Las Vegas. The Aloo Gobi and Spinach and Potato Puree were passable.We got a basket of Garlic Naans that was tasty but rather tough and dry. 

My co-workers enjoyed the carnivorous fare but everyone asked me the same thing when we left...""When are we going to Mount Everest again?""

Me and my fiancee came here for V-Day after hearing it was one of the most romantic restaurants in Vegas.  The location (Sahara and Commercial Center) is a bit of a grungy area but we go there to eat at Komol's quite often so the less than romantic exterior didn't bother me too much.  The interior is dimly lit and pretty cozy as well.  We got seated right away and had our orders taken within the next 10 minutes.  We had a vegetable (carrot, onion, and parsley) ensemble for our starter dishes which was quite spicy but very tasty.  I also had the vegetarian stir fry which was brought out on a steaming hot plate and smelled just as good as it tasted!  This dish had a typical stir fry 'onion-y' taste and came complete with cauliflower, red and green peppers, grilled tofu, and more parsley.  My main dish was a vegetarian curry and it was awesome!  I also had garlic naan and kashmiri naan which was also killer!  The kashmiri naan was naan with a cherry-like filling and it wasn't too sweet, complementing the buttery naan exterior very nicely.  I also had the rice pudding for dessert and it was standard like other rice puddings I've had before.  Food aside, the service was pretty good.  They were a bit slow in bringing our food out and that was a bit irritating.  We were there for almost 2 hours and we are definitely not slow eaters!  They got my order wrong three times during our visit.  The wine was the wrong one and decided to let that one slide but they brought out the wrong appetizer and wrong curry.  Still not sure how that happened, but I let them know I got the wrong dishes and they gladly replaced them with the right ones and pretty quickly, at that.  They also added a 10% percent discount on our bill and gave us extra naan.  Now that's service!  We didn't ask for the discount or naan so that was a real pleasant surprise.  They had a Valentine's special going so 4 dishes and a dessert with a glass of wine came out to be $40 a person which was actually pretty good considering the regular prices of the plates which averaged around $12 dollars each.  Overall, the service was a little slow but good and the food was awesome.  Definitely coming back to experience Namaste again in the future.",zB1GFKkXqn-vgoIgkjhPYg,18,7,5,pvlSmiN4v1-SjzAOsO570A

I ate mostly vegetarian dishes because they were so good and they came first on the buffet.  There wasn't much room for anything else.  Well yes there was, but the vegetarian selections were excellent!

For plate one, I had some Saag Paneer, Dal Maknni, Butter chicken and another chicken whose name I can't remember. (Note to self - bring a notepad).  The spiciness of the first two dishes--the vegetarian ones--was simply superb!  The spices were not overpowering but were just right.  There was also a little bite which is always welcome.

For plate two, I had some Aloo Korma, Fried cabbage, Eggplant Bartha, and some more Dal Maknni.  Again, the flavors were outstanding.

Plate three - I tried three of their chutneys - tamarind, coconut, and mint.  They were all good, but the tamarind was my favorite.  I used them as a condiment on my naan.  While it was not needed--the naan was excellent--I did want to try the chutneys alone and this was the bets option for me.

My last dish was a small bowl of mango custard that was a perfect ending to the meal.  

Service was right on.  Dishes were removed, iced tea refilled, and the waiter checked on me often to see if there was anything I needed. The hostess was a simply lovely woman who was very friendly.  She had to leave while I was eating to run an errand, and she came over and thanked me for coming by and asked me to return. Top notch customer interaction!

I will be back!  Now I need to nap!

3989236,2011-07-23,3,TTpgjbrSyxwHHzE5bIF-Rw,"Sadly, I have to withdraw my previously positive review and add my recent unpleasant experience.  Previously, I had only visited for the lunch buffet, which is good and reasonably priced.  
Dinner is a different story.  I purchased a groupon because I have always enjoyed this place.  (Except, of course, the owner's occasional need to karaoke.  Can someone tell her that she is too loud and not Whitney Houston?)  

We attempted to go there two weeks ago, but the roof had a flood.  We spoke with the owner for a few minutes.  We walked in at 6pm and there was still a three foot by four foot puddle on the floor.  She rents the space, but why not clean it up?  

So, we returned there last night to try again.  The food was good, not great and the rice was sparse.  So, when we asked for our left overs to go, we asked if we could get a little more rice to take home with us.  There was an additional $2 charge on the bill for rice.  

This was the big deal: She wrote in an 18% tip on the overall bill!  Now, I would have completely understood if she wrote a quick note on the side with the calculations for 15%, 18%, and 20% tip on the total bill.  But to write in the tip on a table for two just because we were using a groupon is uncalled for.  My friend, who was paying the difference, was so mad, so crossed it off and gave her a 13% tip.  

Lastly, when the owner is serving me, I feel less bad about the tip considering that is not how she makes her wages, unlike normal wait staff.",kWj6AdUtkvbzhdsqRifwLQ,4,0,2,GCzHh8NcJilm2CBaN-PKQg

BUT, if you make a buffet that is compact (meaning small and only consisting of delicious dishes), steps from where I am sitting and slap a $10.99 price tag on it, then you and I can dance.  Namaste's lunch buffet is all those things.  

This is a small restaurant, so no matter where you are sitting, you are close to the action.  The naan bread is fresh out of the oven and worth the brief wait so it comes out piping hot and delicious.  My favorite, as is true of most Indian restaurants, was the butter chicken.  The only con is that there were no samosas on the bar but, frankly, much like sushi, samosas are never good on a buffet anyway.  

The little lady who is running this place is maybe the cutest little thing ever.  I wanted to put her in my pocket and take her home with me (which is made even weirder by the fact that I am maybe an inch taller than her haha). So nice and genuine and you can really tell she takes pride in her place.  She told my friend and I that she sings nightly.

Butter chicken was also good.  The tandori (sp.) chicken was grey and completely unappealing looking.  Naan was fine but very greasy.  If you like spicy food like I do, this is not the place for you.

If you know me, I should be able to write those two words and be done with this review. For everyone else, well I guess I'll keep going.

With all the great reviews about Namaste's lunch buffet, I've been meaning to try it for quite some time. I finally had the excuse last weekend with one of my meetup groups. Situated in Commercial Center, it's not the nicest neighborhood, but being right next to Lotus of Siam, they have certainly associated themselves with a good neighbor.

The interior is well-decorated with quite a bit of wood trim. The buffet area isn't huge, but provides a good selection. For me though, it's all about the Butter Chicken. All I need is Butter Chicken and Naan for dipping and I'm a happy camper. It's just so freakin' delicious.

I should mention a little tidbit. We were all enjoying our meals and conversation when we suddenly heard one of the owners get up to sing karaoke. She didn't pick easy songs either. She sang Celine's My Heart Will Go On and Whitney's Saving All My Love. She was actually pretty good. It was just unexpected.

Random karaoke aside, $10 AYCE definitely makes me a fan of this place. The service is friendly and the food is very good. I just wish it wasn't so far from my house.",YwaKGmRNnSa3R3N4Hf9jLw,3,3,4,8X-G05PhmCmB-SyggcLshw

4974359,2010-05-24,0,TTpgjbrSyxwHHzE5bIF-Rw,"Indian lunch buffets were on my mind, especially have hearing Misti Y. praise their deliciousness.

We pull into Commercial Center at 1:45 pm on a Sunday.  As we park the car, we notice there aren't too many other cars parked out front.  Hmmm...As we open the door, what a shock to see!  The place was packed full of Indians!  This was a great sign! 

I wasn't sure if there was a wait with all the people standing around of if there was a private party.  With no one to greet us at the front, the Husband goes in search of an empty table.  He finds one last table at the far back and after checking with a waiter, I get the affirmative wave.  I tell him to start first on the buffet line.  Meanwhile, I ask a waiter for some utensils.

When the waiter brings over our water, he apologizes as a tour group had just arrived, which explains all the craziness.  Nonetheless, an Indian tour group stops at Namaste in Commercial Center, of all places, for their lunch en route is still a good sign!

My turn at the buffet line!  Now, I'm no expert on Indian buffets as I've been to only a couple.  But I think the spread was pretty good for $8.99!

My favorite was the Vegetable Korma ""Vegetable cooked in creamy cashew nut gravy finished with almond and garnished with coriander and cream.""  This was good on rice or the hot naan ""unleavened white bread"" they provided.  I also liked the sauce from the Chicken Tikka Masala ""Tender pieces of chicken breast roasted in homemade creamy tomato,"" however, we both found the chicken pieces itself to be dry.  I also liked the Allo Jerra, which were ultimately potatoes.

The Husband was loving the Saag Paneer ""Spinach cooked with homemade cheese"" and the Goat Curry.  

Other items on the buffet line were Pakara, a fried veggie, Cholle Masala, a dish with chickpeas; and a Cabbage Masala.  Something that was both new to us was the Uttapam, a thick pancake with a sour-like taste that was topped with a bit of tomato and onion.  Traditionally it's made from rice that has been fermented, which explains it's tangy taste.

Finishing off the meal was the Kheer, ""Traditional Indian rice pudding with nuts, flavored with cardamon and rose.""

At one point, I helped myself to the water pitcher.  (I wasn't sure if this was self serve since there were about four water pitchers right next to where we were sitting and the place was so crowded.  They did end up refilling my glass the next 4-5 times though.)  The waiters were pretty friendly to us once the crowd got settled in more and started clearing out.  They were quick to clear out our dirty dishes and refill the water glasses.

Namaste also has a simple, but pleasant decor with its mango painted walls, which I'm sure makes one crave a mango lassi.

Overall, definitely not a bad choice for an Indian buffet.  I was so stuffed from that meal that I didn't eat again until 10 pm that night! I don't know if it's always this busy on Sundays though, so keep that in mind!",rt3PC7WCgCKsoufmQJELfw,10,7,4,1Q_C7sWNn2CZjWOR-YwwAg

When we walked in, the owner was belting out some tunes so we just waited for her to finish to get our drinks in. I'm Filipino so I've been disenfranchised and subjected to a lot of karaoke. Some people might like the entertainment, but fair warning that if you're not keen on it, you might catch one song but not a whole performance. 

We did the buffet for $10.99. I also ordered a mango lassi, good but standard. The spread was decent. With 2 chicken dishes, 6 or so veggie dishes, salad, chutneys/raita, naan,rice, spongy little cakes (dont know the name), potato pakora, rice pudding and oranges for sweets. 

We both thought it was decent, but this is not our favorite lunch buffet. The standout for me was the saag which had a nice gingery flavor and creamy texture  and the refreshing rice pudding. I wish the naan wasn't premade and was fresh made as some of them were really crunchy for sitting out. The flavors were good, but I don't like that some of the items were precut bagged vegetable mix  and they were doing their supply order while we were there and it confirmed what was frozen and what was not. I know times aren't the best for businesses, but fresh vegetables is one of the reasons why I'm drawn to Indian food. 

I would say it was a 3.5 star buffet, I'll round up as the service was very warm, friendly and attentive and the atmosphere is nice.

For 3 appetizers, 2 entrees, 2 premium beers and a dessert our bill was $51.

We had the Vegetable Pakora, Onion Bahji & Paneer Naan to start things off. While we waited the waiter brought out some popadoms on the house with a sweet sauce and spicy sauce. Nice. 

For our main courses we had the Chicken Vindaloo (chicken & potatoes stewed with curry over rice) & Chicken Biriani
(Chicken, cashew nuts, vegetables, basmati rice). 

I enjoyed everything we had, and though it was probably a mistake to get 2 fried appetizers the pakora & bhaji were great & the Naan bread was soft and tasty.

The Vindaloo, for me, was perfect. It was spicy but not overpowering, and the flavors really came through in the sauce along with the tender and juicy chicken. It may not be as spicy as some Lotus regulars are used to but I thought it was spot on.

The only complaint my gf had about her dish was that it could have used more cashews. I was skeptical when she ordered the carrot based dessert, but was surprised at how good it was..probably the healthiest dessert you will ever eat.

I have to say I have never received such poor service in my life. The waiter wasn't rude 'per se' but his way of speaking was very condescending. Every question or comment we had he rolled his eyes or had something very short to say. 

CLEANLINESS = NO! The person I was dining with dropped their napkin on the floor on their way to the bathroom. An Indian woman who appeared to be either the owner or the manager proceeded to pick it up (OFF THE FLOOR) and place it on top of our table (where we will eat). I was absolutely disgusted and demanded another napkin.

The lamb we ordered was such poor quality. It was very gamy and was overcooked and dry. We ordered plain and garlic naan. The garlic naan had good flavor but they were both overcooked and almost crispy. I can't remember what our 2nd entree was but it obviously wasn't worth remembering.

I've been to 5 or so Indian buffets in my life, but this one tops them all ! I might just bend my ""only eat Indian a few times a year"" rule for this place. 

The ownership is new-ish (they bought the place back in June). The owners are super sweet, and most importantly the food is awesome.

She literally picked up a mic, piped in some back ground music and points to my table and says ""this one goes out to the three ladies to my right"" LOL. Sheer awesomeness. I've never seen owner ""karaoke"" in an Indian buffet before ! 

The new owner rocks - personable, good with food, and moonlights as a lounge singer. I felt nothing but love the entire time we were there. Yup, it's decided, despite the carbs & ensuing pain from too much butter chicken - I might just have to come back here more often !",kmE8w5Y785eZmodsx0V6Ag,7,7,5,juV5NrEhSf5B8LZBLFB3ig
5372891,2012-04-10,3,TTpgjbrSyxwHHzE5bIF-Rw,"This review is for their lunch buffet. I came in around 1pm after a day at the Korean spa. They are open from 11:30pm-2:30pm for lunch and then reopen at 5pm for dinner. 

Yet again I almost missed out on a solid place because I was going to walk out. First glances can be deceptive, especially when you walk into an empty restaurant in the middle of lunch hours. I decided to stay anyways due to all the high reviews of this place. I cannot say that Yelp has lead me astray. 

The lunch buffet is smaller than other restaurants and does not offer saag. I was disappointed to see that their paneer is without the homemade cheese cubes. I did enjoy their butter chicken and aloo gobi though. In the beginning, I was counting all of my favorite items that was missing, but after a few bites I was enjoying what they did offer. 

Unlike other places, the items in the warmers were kept piping hot. Nothing was lukewarm. The fried potatoes retained a crispiness that is normally unheard of in buffets. Overall I was impressed with how attentive the owner was. She cleared plates, refilled my water, and checked up on me frequently. I overheard her conversation about the restaurant having a tough time, but she doesn't let it show in the quality of the food. I hope their business picks up, because it is a solid option for those not too familiar with Indian or someone who loves butter chicken (Which I don't see too often on the line).",N3oNEwh0qgPqPP3Em6wJXw,4,3,4,teHTuLFncOhy67xMaLYHrQ
5376165,2013-01-07,1,TTpgjbrSyxwHHzE5bIF-Rw,"I've been here once before and thought it was fantastic. 
This time we walked in and they pretty much told us we had to get the buffet, which I didn't even know was an option for dinner. We told her we had a Groupon and she said they'd still take it. I think we appeared disappointed, so she encouraged us to check out the buffet and gave us time to decide. The buffet had limited items but we were probably going to get Chicken Tikka Masala or Curry anyway and both were on the buffet. Our Groupon was set to expire in a week so we figured we better just use it. I think the owner sensed our hesitation and finally offered us the whole menu but she said it'd be a long wait for food nice they were getting busy. Only the booths were occupied so it didn't seem busy but we decided to stick with the buffet option, we were pretty hungry. She also moved us to a different booth, both of which seemed dirty, very confusing.
We were given a fresh basket of Naan and our drinks. And on to the buffet, I think the Chicken Curry was the best thing on the buffet but was pretty picked through and there wasn't much left. Tikka Masala was kind of bland, I make better at home. The Tandoori chicken was good but we kept getting little broken bits of bone in the meat around the whole bone. I didn't really like their dal either.
The entire time we were there workers kept walking back and forth with big sheets to set tables, aren't they closed after lunch to do this? We got there about 6 so there couldn't have been that many people in and out that quickly. The waitress/owner was very nice and apologetic throughout but the entire experience was strange. With all the good Indian options in town, I doubt I'll go back.",DoRCeCcJbrsM2BiAKj3trA,1,0,2,hC1edoaBcN2kHBc8T-M58g
5383495,2011-04-04,3,TTpgjbrSyxwHHzE5bIF-Rw,"Great food! I finally found an Indian restaurant in Vegas after 3 years of being here. It was kind of funny actually I got a groupon for this restaurant and finally was able to use it. It was Saturday night and when I walked in this little Indian woman was singing ""I will always love you"". :) I didn't expect that but she has a great voice. Then as soon as she was finished with the song she said that a belly dancer would be out shortly. It was kind of funny this whole night of entertainment when I had only expected to find a mediocre restaurant with mediocre food. 

My friend ordered this awesome soup- spinach and chicken I think. Yummy. Our main dishes were lamb vindaloo and chicken tika masala. They were both so delicious. The nan was fresh and fluffy. 

The owner (the singer) came by to see how we were doing, and because I was so impressed with the food I wanted to hug her. We got to talking and she was really nice that she made me decide on the spot that not only would it be one of my favorite restaurants, but all my friends favorite too. Can't wait to go back.",uyeVQn9hIJCGpaGx7LHMFQ,2,2,5,b0n6uvfJslNCW7TcifgmLw
5390408,2012-10-17,2,TTpgjbrSyxwHHzE5bIF-Rw,"I'd been to Namaste several times for dinner and once for lunch in the past, but it had been far too long of a lapse from going.  Decided to go for lunch today since I'm still embarked on ""Las Vegas Indian Lunch Buffet Tour 2012"" and inexplicably had not tried it in long enough to warrant a review.

I was actually very impressed with the times I went to Namaste for dinner.  One of those occasions would have warranted a 5 and the other a 4, so I should be ashamed of myself for not posting a review then and instead hitting them with a 3 for today's lunch buffet, but that's exactly what I'm going to do.

Let me start off by saying service was fantastic, and the gentleman who seated us was very friendly and made sure my iced tea stayed flowing (iced tea was delicious by the way, it was one of those fruit flavored kinds which I'm not certain of, but very tasty nonetheless) and that there was always a plate of hot naan at the table.  The first portion we received of naan was excellent.  Soft, fresh and with a great flavor.  The 2nd plate was a little overcooked and therefore too crispy for my liking, but overall the naan was fine.  

As for the selections on the actual buffet, I was a tad disappointed.  A minor gripe is layout wise the rice was at the end of the line.  I think it works much better at the front so I can keep piling all the various curries and dals over the rice, instead of vice versa which is what I ended up doing.   As for the food itself, I was a big fan of the Saag (hooray for it not being Saag Paneer like I normally find at buffets as I can't handle the cheese).   I also thought the Potato Pakora was delicious and unique to any pakora offerings I've had elsewhere.  The chicken curry was a fine version, and the piece of chicken I ended up with were very tender and flavorful.   The rest of it was fairly average to me.  It could just be a preference thing, but I found most of the other offerings to be very thin in consistency, almost soup like, while I guess I tend to prefer a thicker dal or curry with my rice.   When I'd try to scoop a spoonful of most of these onto my plate, they immediately would go all over the entire plate and mix into everything else.  If you've read my other reviews you know I generally like this when I eat Indian food, but the point is I like to do it MYSELF, to be the master of my own domain so to speak.  

Generally I also just found the offerings limited compared to my favorite lunch buffets Mt Everest and Mint.  I'm a samosa fiend so not having those effects me (and Namaste makes a fine version from what I've had at dinner).   I would have also liked to see more meat offerings (they had 3 chicken dishes, but 2 were prepared in butter or yogurt so they were off limits to my sensitive, annoying tummy).   It's quite possible I caught them on a day with a selection that just didn't suit my needs, but even if that's the case the fact that I've never caught Everest or Mint in that situation speaks volumes to me.",v3YOx9T4jRSw8XP9Rd9H4g,1,0,3,O6vbuazwYbVQkzqOko-OCQ

The food is authentically awesome. Melke, the new owner is the sweetest little thing! She even sing you some some songs as you dine.

I recently landed back in Vegas and had ZERO groceries in the fridge. We decided based upon proximity to pop into Namaste for a regular ol' meal. Boy was I surprised with the warm reception, great entertainment and fantastic chow! I actually felt like I went on a little vacation - it was such a great escape.

Victor and the rest of the crew are real kind and fun as well. Thanks guys for making that and numerous times since then a wonderful experience.",xvf1EK4aR1VJwFO0CNbe9w,1,1,5,4ctL6c5ovmCFafl2zczGSQ
5623442,2010-12-22,1,TTpgjbrSyxwHHzE5bIF-Rw,"Don't let the sketchy exterior of this place fool you. It's actually a pretty nice and clean restaurant. The owner who also is the main entertainer is really nice and has a great singing voice. There was also a belly dancer who kept things lively and entertaining as well.

Food was reasonably priced and very good. Everyone in our 13 people group enjoyed their food very much. Three of us shared the Lamb Vindaloo and the Tandori grill plate. That was freaking delicious...very good seasoning and flavor on the chicken, lamb and shrimp. My only complaint is about the Naan...it was a bit too toasted and not soft like what I'm used to. But no biggie..it was still very good.

Overall this place was a hit..the main reason I can't give it 5 stars is mainly due to the service. Although the waiters were friendly, they seemed a bit confused and the food took a long time to come out. Which I'm sure was due to our large party. Other than that I would definitely recommend this place.",v4C8VqqXhwvP0KuhWkCL6Q,2,1,4,vC7wftbkeYO0DW3-jGflcA

5812354,2009-12-27,10,TTpgjbrSyxwHHzE5bIF-Rw,"This is not the best Indian food in Vegas, I'm disappointed to say. 

The Buffet has not changed since folks last reviewedin fact it was the same lineup, the service was poor, I asked the waiter for Garam Masala rice, basic White Basmati with hot spices, but he could not make it happen.

My family had never been to an Indian place and they loved it, could not stop talking about finally eating the lamb, got to love the Holidays.

Final review:
Basic Indian Buffet, 10 per person is an expensive lunch in this town, could be done a lot better, One Star",0auZpvEo4og4Lk7_hdvWJg,2,1,1,zqvtVqFljzxU1H4CMC6_GA

5915533,2011-06-23,2,TTpgjbrSyxwHHzE5bIF-Rw,"First Indian Place I have been to in las vegas and i was excited. I had read the reviews on yelp and was anxious to try the place out.

You walk in and immediately you are succumb to a dark, woody, quiet environment. It is calm, soothing and relaxing. The booths were nice and big and very comfy.

I deducted a star because as an American, I should always have the option to American drinks. No tea, no lemonade, no soda. Water or Lassi seemed to be our only option and I was disappointed in that.

The food was good, not great. I have had definately had better Indian Food. I was extremely happy that they had Butter Chicken but in my opinion it should have been a little more creamier. 

The tandori chicken didn't seem authentic either. So that was big a NO for me.

The naan, wasn't the freshest or softest I have had either. 

Maybe it was the day we went but I felt they should have had more variety for chutneys.

The buffet itself was a bit pricey for the amount of different choices they offered. 

I did like most of what I had. Very filling. Ate one and half plates.

No indian people eating there either. That should have been my number one sign.

I would go back - maybe.",U0WU9d6gpMNkO_tPXK58Sg,5,1,3,V3RThXKBUWIYFdbvS9NNBw
5959344,2011-01-03,2,TTpgjbrSyxwHHzE5bIF-Rw,"Vegas is a mecca for many great food genres. Unfortunately Indian is not one of them. Luckily, in this wasteland there is Namaste.

This is my favorite Indian buffet in town. They keep the line fresh and clean and there are tons of options. I remember reading an article in the LV Weekly claiming they have the best chicken in town. Now that may be a bit of an overstatement, but their Tandori chicken is pretty delicious. 

When I'm in the area, it's hard for me not to end up at Komol, but I'm sometimes able to fight the urge and end up at Namaste.

I could do without the karaoke while I eat, but it is pretty entertaining (ie humorous).

Lunch or dinner. It's all good.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,4,2,4,zBqs16DDC040Sb5xZNUDVg
