The service can be a little slow at times but they make it up in quality and value.  I found their Kalua Pig and Hawaiian BBQ both to be very good.  I mean, as simple as a plate lunch is, believe it or not, I have had a bad one or two in my day.  Luckily not from here.  So long as I am commuting to Las Vegas, I will continue to enjoy this (sparingly).  Prices are VERY reasonable and value for the dollar is high.",LbMmdmpwpS00Vz2QL9XyFw,2,1,4,WmxYeP3nmhuDaqc5M5GL7Q

I'm so glad I did because the food here is delicious and they give you huge portions!!  The katsu was crispy and yet the meat was super juicy.  The portuguese fried rice is really flavorful and not very oily at all.  And the kimchi is the best around this area.

The only thing I didn't like was the gravy on the loco moco.  It just tasted salty and was a bit too gloppy.  But the hamburger meat was delicious so I can't complain too much.  I suggest ordering the loco moco with gravy on the side so that you can decide whether you like it or not.",yB7V5yP1tmz2Q3AWlUdyeA,3,0,4,tT0xF1afkwhyAP5M1pCjdw

I first ordered the chicken katsu and immediately changed it to a regular short rib plate. When we received our order it was the chicken I had asked her to change for the short rib plate before we paid. She then proceeds to argue with me telling me I was wrong she only heard the chicken order. We told her we changed it for the short ribs, she didn't recall that. Not only was she UNHELPFUL, SHE WAS EXTREMELY RUDE ARGUING with us across the restaurant!! As a small business owner I will not support a poorly ran restaurant!!!

For starters, Aloha offers delivery and they're quite cheap (score). I got a combo plate with the hamburger steak, bbq beef, and katsu curry. 

The hamburger steak was tough and a bit bland for me personally. The gravy kind of stuck to the beef and was too thick. The Katsu chicken is good but there could be more curry. The reason I gave this place 3-stars was solely for the bbq beef. The beef is tangy and you get a bit of spice. It is literally phenomenal. If you ever need a place that delivers quick and is cheap, order Aloha. I definitely recommend the bbq beef.",2hnmM6kh0O2wwkmGuT5Bwg,1,0,3,9Vs7ej1swVKNa2N9fsN-yA

I got the B-1 mix plate ( chicken katsu curry, hamburger steak w brown gravy and Teri beef)  The chix katsu crispy not too hard to screw up , curry sauce good like how they do it in Hawaii  somewhere between an Indian and Japanese style curry. I only wish that they used chix thighs instead of breasts. Thighs r more juicy and tasty. Hamburger steak and gravy good and the Teri beef was flavorful like they marinated the meat in other seasonings not just shoyu, not like some other Hawaiian BBQ w / intials  L&L , plate comes w/ lotta rice and mac salad .  I also got a spam musubi , well alright I got 2 for half time snack. Musubi pretty standard spam , rice ,nori and drizzle of Teri sauce. $2.15 ea. Kinda expensive  .

I have tried their laulau, kalua pig, mahi mahi, fried shrimp, fried noodles, oxtail soup, beef curry, pork cutlet, BBQ chicken, chicken cutlet, and chicken katsu, to name a few, and they are all great.  I like their kalbi since you can easily chew everything clean off the bones (a sign of well prepared kalbi).

A few months later, I was working at a new job, in a new neighborhood. Again and again, my office mate strolls in with these delicious smelling lunches, and I would sneak a peak over his shoulder, trying to figure out what the source of these beautiful food aromas could be.

Finally, I asked him, and he produced a menu for Aloha Hawaiian BBQ. It was settled then that my next lunch would be from there. 

My first pick was the BBQ Mixed plate, and I haven't looked back since. I made a point to try almost everything on the menu. They have the best Macaroni Salad and Chicken Katsu I've ever eaten. The Pork, Beef and Seafood choices have all been great.

Since my office is right across the street, I find myself dining here far too frequently. In fact, almost daily.
My eager lunch companion enjoys trying a variety of things off the menu. Yesterday he tried the Caribbean Shrimp ($8.95) which he enjoyed. And ever since he tried the Chicken Katsu Musabi a few weeks back, he seems to order one each visit. My options are limited since I dont eat meat, but the steamed rice is really cheap (.60) and they just recently added steamed broccoli to the menu!! 
The star of the show is the ""Sauce Station"" as we like to call it. This consists of a couple bottles of soy, teriyake, rooster sauce and ketchup on a rack which is also equipped with little plastic to-go containers. Many of inventive concoctions have been created on that rack. The service is OK, the place is clean and everything is dirt cheap.

Anyways I got to give Aloha Hawaiian BBQ a 3.5 Rating.  Food quality and taste sometimes are really good but sometimes it's just OK.  Way better than the chain Hawaiian restaurants that's all over Vegas but still could improve.  Their menu doesn't have everything I sometimes want or something special that stands out but it does has a decent selection of local Hawaiian/Asian dishes, the basics at least are there and are good. Prices are a little more than what I'm use to so I do tend to pass by and go else where.

Very bad customer service for Aloha. Don't tell your customers what sounds good to make them feel ok. Luckily E24 verified you lied. I hope maybe on future deliveries for other customers you provide a microwave for the stone cold food you think is ok to serve. Manager on duty was very rude. Seemed like I was an inconvenience for checking on order. Your business is not needed in Vegas. The least you could have done was offered a discount for the hassle yet E24 had to do what you wouldn't. Your manager told E24 they won't apply anything what a sad sad way to fix a problem. Never again will I order from here or even eat there. Thanks to E24 though for helping a guy and his kids out!,afup74KKBrmvnOhTvpXBpA,1,0,1,WVD5vS02K35DFiswgyfP_A

Hubby's Loco Moco had 3 real nice sized patties, perfectly cooked eggs and gravy. Hubby ate almost all of his. He said ""It isn't Rainbows kine gravy, just looks same."" All he had left was a little Mac salad, and he said that needed salt and pepper.

I got my chicken cutlet (looked and tasted just like katsu, and not what I was expecting) because I was expecting a cutlet, mine was 'ok', but would have been better with the Katsu sauce than with the gravy. The gravy had just the right amount of seasoning for me, but I'm a salt lover so may be too salty for others.

4655366,2017-07-18,8,Jl6_g-pZD5aQGg2y87myeQ,"Las Vegas is a melting pot of food throughout the world. In this melting pot, the delicious food of Hawaii is represented in several Hawaiin BBQ restaurants from Boulder City at the southeast to the Mount Charleston turnoff in the northwest. Fortunately, the majority of the people living here live close to a Hawaiian restaurant. I am one of those people. 

Aloha Hawaiian BBQ is close to my home and place of work. After a hard day's work there have been a few times that I stopped here to recuperate with the taste of a Hawaiian plate lunch.

In contrast to the mesmerizing scenery of a tranquil beach in Hawaii, Aloha Hawaiian BBQ is ordinary scenery. It is a hole in the wall restaurant that blends in with a 7-Eleven and Roberto's Taco Shop at the northwest corner of Sunset and Pecos Roads. It is a hole in the wall place that falls short of the dining atmosphere in the nearby Ross J's but makes up for it in convenience and value. Where Ross J's further east on Sunset Road has often been mobbed, this Aloha Hawaiian BBQ has always been convenient. 

When I have visited this establishment in the early afternoon there has never been a line. At the same time their has always been a pleasant employee welcoming me to the restaurant. On the yellow wall to the left there has been a large menu to welcome me. It is a familiar menu that reminds me of L&L Barbecue. The dining room itself looks like both an L&L Barbecue and a Chinese take out. What differentiates the dining room from an L&L is the giant Hawaiian shirt on the wall. This is an attention grabber that has made it on several Yelp pictures of this business. 

My meal of choice has been the mini portion of the Hawaiian BBQ chicken. At $6.59 before tax it includes either white or brown rice with macaroni salad. The menu boasts that this is one of their best selling items. At this juncture I must mention that Aloha Hawaiian BBQ is one of the few Hawaiian BBQ restaurants that I am cognizant of that provides a choice of either white or white rice. With the mini plate lunch, I add a regular Coke for a $1.50 which after tax brings the total to $8.64. After paying, I will saunter a few feet from the counter to the Coca-Cola fountain to fill up my styrofoam cup with my favorite drink in the World: strawberry soda. 

The gap between ordering and seeing it has been a few minutes. The fact that they have the air conditioning running and a fan makes the wait bearable during the hot days of summer. 

The food is an example of quality equals quantity. They give you so much food for a so-called mini portion. When I look at the large pieces of the grilled boneless and skinless chicken that is marinated in their own BBQ sauce, I think out loud, ""Aloha to all this food. How much food would be in the large plate lunch?"" My tradition is to compliment the flavor by walking to the condiment station where I will pour Sriracha sauce over the chicken and soy sauce. I will save the best for last: the macaroni salad. 

The Aloha mini BBQ plate lunch with a Coke is great value served in a convenient setting. Regardless that Aloha Hawaiian BBQ falls short of the dining environments in some Hawaiian BBQ restaurants, it makes up for it with quality and quantity.

After an afternoon nap, I wanted to make my way to Aloha Hawaiian BBQ so I could check this place out. Although I'm always weary about visiting a place right before they close, because of the possibility food has stayed out all day, I still decided to get there and try out their grub.

This joint is located close to the Pecos/Sunset intersection next door to the Roberto's Taco Shop. I feel like this place is owned by a former L&L's owner or part of the family. When you enter, you notice the place very similar to it. The walls are a canary yellow much like L&L's. There's booth seating and table tops with a contrasting blue, and then it hits you. The giant sized Aloha shirt. Definitely a focal point for sure. Next to the shirt is an aesthetically pleasing menu size. Gives you the break down of things they serve and sizes offered. The young female taking my order was very nice and pleasant. She was accommodating and personable. The ordering counter was kind of a cluttered mess though. Business cards from everywhere, change surrounding the lucky cat.  I didn't know where to look, where to move, just a bit much. For my meal, I started with the Hawaiian Sun passion fruit drink for around $1.45. As for the food, here's what I got:

Spam Musubi for $2.15: The spam was marinated in teriyaki sauce and fried. It was a thick piece which I appreciated but could have used a little more char on the outside.The inside, because it was so thick, was a bit mushy. The rice, was definitely something that was out most of the day. It wasn't as sticky as I hoped it to be and the nori seaweed wasn't as crunchy as I have experienced at other joints. 

Chicken Katsu curry for $7.75: Breaded white meat chicken, served with curry sauce, optional katsu sauce and macaroni salad. The breading was light and crispy and I really liked that the meat was thinly sliced as it made for a quick cooking process.  The mac salad was drenched in mayo and seemed more of a soup rather than a salad. Thank goodness I asked for the curry on the side. The curry was hot, but super chunky. That was what I was fearing. The curry tasted like it was out all day, or even scooped up from a previous curry stew. No matter how much time I microwaved it for at home, the chunky, almost starchy curry dipping sauce kept its chunky form. The taste was alright but I was too sketched out to use it. I also asked for chicken katsu sauce. It tasted like L&L's sauce. Very tangy, not like the soy sauce/ketchup based ones I prefer. Still, a flavorful combined dish.

I feel like there's two kinds of Hawaiian joints: group A joints like Island Flavor, Ross J's and Aloha Kitchen and group B joints like L&L, Ohana BBQ and this joint. It's still a good place to eat, but my heart will always belong to those places in group A. I still enjoyed my experience and will probably be back on another night to experience other dishes. My rating may change, who knows.",CNaaizAUc2c4WIb1M3BBPw,8,4,3,AG5F6YXkUJhL8uGvhu5knA

But the chicken had a good amount of breading wasnt over done. For the price you get enough chicken, and Macaroni salad. I opted for the fried rice. Its enough food where i couldnt finish it all.

When you live miles away from the Ania, it's as close as you can get. My husband found this place and we've enjoyed it many times. It's about as far from our house in Vegas as you can get, but worth the drive for us, we love it. 

I usually get the combination chicken katsu curry, hamburger steak and teri beef. This combination hits the spot for me. I think the curry flavors are accurate and the texture of the katsu is crispy, so I know it's close to the Hawaii flavors I remember.

I got the fried Saimin char siu. Though the flavors were ok, the char siu had tons of fat on it. Not much meat at all. We also got our favorite Hawaiian sun drinks. Something happened today that is making me think that I may not come back. As we were sitting there waiting for our food I noticed something crawling on the napkin dispenser. It was a fast moving tiny roach. So our food was delivered to our table and we ate. I finished first and started this review. Right in the middle writing the review my son stuck out his tongue and said yucky. Using the fork I took the thing off his tongue and saw that it was paper. Paper?

I contacted eat24, who then followed up with the restaurant, and said the driver was lost (no kidding), and didn't speak English, so we could not direct him. After multiple messages back and forth with eat24, the driver arrived at 4:15 PM. Which meant our food had been s

My order was the regular size Chicken Katsu meal with steamed rice, added on a side of chicken BBQ musubi and manapuas to share with coworkers. 

I'd like to say the katsu was alright. Nothing special, simple breading (I daresay it is nothing close to PANKO brand breading type, maybe just cheap breading) of chicken along with the sauce. The sauce tasted like it came from a cheap bottle brand. 

Portion of the katsu and rice was generous and a scoop of the typical Mac salad. Very similar to Americanized Hawaiian franchise of L&L. The Manapua (meat bun) was OK. It was small and a bit stale due to the bread. The musubi was probably the only thing I enjoyed. Lol 

Its Hawaiian alright but to truly taste the distinct flavors of a traditional hawaiian cuisine and you want to satiate those taste buds, I'd look elsewhere; otherwise try this joint if you're craving for 'different food' other than the regular burger and fries theme and/or for a quick eat. I give it a 3-star only because of the courteous service and speedy wait time to receive the food, plus they got this giant Aloha shirt on their restaurant wall which was kinda cool.
