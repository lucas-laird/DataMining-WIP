They have quite a decent selection, but then again I'm mostly just interested in the sweets, chocolate, and that kind of yummy stuff from there.  I was able to get some delicious, authentic Cadbury chocolate and some of Mr. Kipling's pies, very yummy! I plan on going back again and getting some more stuff to try.  The lady working was very nice and helpful too, and if they don't have what you're looking for, they offer to try and find it for you.",8XrXgqWBhVOFIFQHwsUwDg,1,0,4,4OoONTJ2ih1sJC1nwaBH0Q

It was the second to last thing we did on our lastest trip to Vegas, and it was a fun little place.  The owner was super nice and talked our ears off the whole time.  Unfortunately we were travelling about 3 hours after our stop, so we couldn't really get any of the frozen or other foods, but they do carry Mars Delight, which is only the greatest candy bar on the earth.",OzfKyVa9LPdvqURivDMYIA,2,2,5,sNUzhKfBOvLa-F_5fyr3hA
