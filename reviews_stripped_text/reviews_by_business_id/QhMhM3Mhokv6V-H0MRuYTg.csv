We're ASKING a question, stop assuming we're ordering, especially when we preface our question with ""I have a question.""  We asked if they had the meal that comes with 2 mcmuffins. She put in an order for 2 sandwiches only.  We say no that's not what we want to order we want to know if you have the meal. She takes it off and adds milk instead. Frustrated, we just ordered two number 2s with orange juice.
No apologies for the miscommunication she just gives a total and stops talking.  We had to wait til we got to her to find out of she got the order correct (no milk or any other random items).  All was fine but her attitude was not. we could not wait to move on to the next window.  But alas, the car in front was waiting for their order for forever!  

We finally make it to the food window and I tell my bf to ask for ketchup.  Window opens  and lady serving us our bags was nice and at least days good morning.  But then she hands us our bag and our drinks and says no straws (for our orange juices) and closes the window.  We could barely say ""ketchup please!""  Thank god she heard as the window was closing.  

WTF store #22506.  McDonald's, this is UNSATISFACTORY.  No straws (and heard the cashier tell another customer that there were no frappes), bad attitude and horrible service!

We were here very, very early in the morning and there was no one manning the registers but the manager was walking by checking them. She looked around when she saw us to see if she could get someone to at least greet us but there was no one so she had to do it herself haha!

The food is typical McDonalds except for their french fries. At most McDonalds I love their fries...not at this place. They're always old and it taste as if they never change the oil in their fryer.  I've never had a good french fry at this place.

I visited this unit one Saturday night. A customer vomited all over a table and floor in front of cashier.  Daniel said I knew it. As I paid for my food, I asked him to tell the manager.

She said I know but I am short handed.
I contacted the phone on the door (Lucy), area supervisor. Her response I will address it. I sat outside in a 40 degree cold eating my good. I saw them clean it but never sanitized table.
I made a comment on line no response.

The product did not match the advertised pictures . I am going to try this again in LA and see if it comes with three grapes and a quarter of sliced apple with no greens.

As you walk into this 24 hour establishment, it is filled with homeless people. Obviously it is totally acceptable for anyone to eat here but when half of them are sleeping on the tables then that's not sanitary. I was even skeptical eating there because the tables and floors are all dirty. The staff here when I ordered just seemed annoyed. I understand though. Who would be happy in an environment like that? Still, costumer service is always key.

The worst moment of my visit was when I went to put ice in my drink, the metal part where the ice comes out shocked me! Of course there was no ice also. The metal piece was completely bent back and all wet. I'm sure they still haven't fixed it, so beware if you decide to come here. I decided to just fill up my cup without ice. As I finally sat down to eat, the bread was stale, fries were hard, and the soda was flat.
