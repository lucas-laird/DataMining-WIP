Our order was not what we expected as the salad we wanted had shredded pork.  I'm sure that the phonetically spelled Thai description of the dish noted the shredded pork but it was not written in English like the rest of the ingredients.  Every ingredient was described in English except for the pork.  Weird.  The decor is slightly better than blah, they make an effort at least, the service was slightly worse than mediocre, and the place smelled like smoke.  It didn't smell like cigarette smoke but instead like the building has once been ablaze and the leftover odor was a combo of smoke and cleaning supplies.  There is much better Thai in Vegas at the same price.",tdygTnmH033ny65XOsRudQ,0,0,2,aHXHG_HLdU2dFqItTugoKQ

Usually I will judge a Thai place by their pad see ew.
So I went right in and ordered the pad see ew.
A good thing I noticed was the price was very reasonable, but I think that was a trap...

LIFE RULE: You get what you pay for.

This place had the worst pad see ew I have ever eaten in my life.
The noodles were hard and undercooked and it had too much salty flavor.
I ordered it with chicken and the chicken was raw inside.
When the waitress saw my unfinished food she just looked at it and didnt ask me anything.
She just took my plate and left the check like everything was fine and dandy.

My co-worker ordered the pad thai and she didnt like it either. 
She said it was way too sweet and the noodles were too soft.
It was also noted by both of us that this was the palest pad thai we have ever seen in our lives.
No color whatsoever!?!
Ive been eating Thai food for a loooooooooong time.
Ive even been to Thailand twice and this was not ""it""
Pad Thai should have a reddish tint to it from the Paprika.
At least thats what I know from over 30 examples I have ever eaten in my life.

Also the Thai iced tea had a lot of particulates in it meaning either they didnt filter it correctly to make the tea or something wasnt clean.

For such a nicely decorated place I was totally surprised by lack of quality control.

With all the problems coming from the food I suspect that the owners dont really know how to cook Thai food and/or run a proper shop.
From other reviews it seems that its a family restaurant so heres some advice to the owners:  Just cause you cook good at home for family and friends does not mean you should open a restaurant. First, study your craft carefully and pay attention to every detail.

Positives: Decorated nicely but you shouldnt judge a book by its cover.

Negatives: Food, shady location, and service.

With the bad food, the shady location and the unattentive service I will end it with this:  There are too many other good Thai restaurants in the area to ever eat here again.

713221,2011-01-11,1,vAuzGR-ufeLu3Y_U5UlO_w,"Stopped in for lunch today with a coworker.  Initial impression was great, as the decor is very contemporary and the restaurant is clean.  
The selection of lunch specials wasn't as extensive as other spots in town, but as this was my first visit I wanted to try a range of the old standbys anyway.  Ordered Pork Larb, Chicken Pad Thai, and Chicken Red Curry...with all dishes being a 3 or 4 on their 1 - 5 spice scale as my coworker doesn't go super spicy.
Prior to the food being served, waiter brought out a small sample of Egg Drop Soup with Crispy Noodles, which was a nice touch.
Pork Larb was served first.  Nothing particularly remarkable.  I usually shy away from Larbs that incorporate mint leaves, but this Larb used just enough to provide some complexity without being overpowering.  Had the pork not been overdone, I think this would be a pretty solid Larb.
The Pad Thai and Red Curry came after a short wait, with the Curry being accompanied by a very modest portion of rice.  The Pad Thai was probably the highlight of the meal...good flavor and heavy on the scallions, although it certainly wasn't winning any awards.  The Red Curry was completely uninspired.  It had a nice, rich color and a good amount of both meat and vegetables, albeit a little heavy on the bamboo, but once it got in the mouth the flavor was flat and quite salty and there was no noticeable spice in the level 4.
I probably would not stop here for a quick lunch as service was attentive, but the kitchen a little more leisurely.  However, I will probably stop here again for dinner to try some other dishes.  For example, a large bowl of soup was served to a neighboring table and it looked quite good.  Based on my first experience, I feel that Stick E Rice overdelivers on ambiance and underdelivers on food.",8JnKfxdonJ8hCrDFOeV7pQ,1,2,2,ikoWBSMbcsPHfze15YCXVg

Probably give the place 4.5 stars but round down because it's a STUPID NAME FOR A RESTAURANT !  also, not sure i understand the location - would've loved it 5 months ago when i worked about 200 yards away - even then, the place is way off the street so it's not easily seen.

the space is clean  comfortable.

We ordered
Thom kha
Thai beef salad
yellow chicken curry
regular rice and sticky rice (or is it stick E rice ?)
sticky rice w/ fried banana and coconut ice cream

Nothing over $10 ( the curry might be if you order shrimp ) 

the standouts - the curry was excellent ! Dessert also very good.  I liked that the beef in the salad was tender and the dressing had a nice citrus-y tang to it.  The Thom Kha was ""standard""

Not sure where this place fits in the  Las Vegas Thai restaurant order - i put it above the ""chains"" - Pin Kaow / Archi's, better than Kung Fu, definitely better than Krung Siam ( that place has really dropped for me ) , I'm waiting to see how Mix Zone does under the new owners ( first visit - ok )  - I still gotta hit Komol and yes, I'm still a fan of LOS.

The restaurant itself is somewhat hidden away towards the end of the strip mall. However, once you go inside, you feel you are in a very classy place.

Terrific Thai tea (tastes of ginger), great curries, a beautiful ambiance (modern) in a generic strip mall... and they wisely ask you to name your spice level... I chose 4 and had some serious spice moments, but it really enhanced the flavor and made me appreciate the Thai tea.

I am glad that I made the long drive to visit this one!  The inside is quite nice, and it looks like the owners spent more than a few pennies on making an old building look new.  There were a lot of young couples dining in here, and iPhone's were going off left and right with text bells.  I was skeptical at  first.

I ordered the Thai iced tea, which was quite nice, the papaya salad, and the ducky curry.  Overall, I would say that the chef at Stick E Rice knows how to mix ingredients and pair things properly.  One thing that could bother some Thai food lovers is that they seem to go easy on the heat levels, so if you like your Thai food very hot, don't be afraid to ask for very hot.

The papaya salad was quite impressive!  It had a very well balanced flavor, with a little vinegar, a little bit of sweetness, and some unique flavor too.  The salad was covered in peanuts and green beans.  It wasn't overpowering, and was very easy to keep eating.  I enjoyed this one a lot, and I ate the whole thing.  

The duck curry was pretty good.  It had green peppers, pineapple, and little cherry tomatoes.  It wasn't as good as Thai Grill's curry, but the yellow curry had a nice flavor.  The duck was a little gristly, but nothing to complain about.  There were big chunks of it in the curry.  One thing that impressed me were the cherry tomatoes.  I normally don't like cherry tomatoes in my curry, but these were little yellow ones, and were very mild compared to the normal, in-your-face sweet cherry tomatoes.  This mildness made them very tasty within the curry.

My only complaint about Stick E Rice was that I thought the rice was a little mushy.  I asked the waiter about this, and he brought me a new rice that seemed just as mushy. It wasn't overly mushy though, and he informed me that it was just how it was prepared here.  And really, it only became a little dissatisfying when mixed with the curry, which made the rice a little too mushy.  This didn't ruin my experience though.

Overall, I will have to make a couple of revisits to really get a good idea on whether this is one of the best Thai restaurants in Vegas.  So far though, I am fairly impressed!",wOGfOjBaP-lCS1NW_En2LQ,6,2,4,ChuOhV08b7cGemWPQeBR2A

I was in the mood for some oriental flavors and we spotted the sign for Stick  E Rice and decided to see what's up.  We walked into the restaurant and noticed how clean the place was and how chic the decor was in contrast to the scruffy looking parking lot outside.  Very cozy, very inviting, and exuded tranquility to say the least (we went at night btw).  The servers immediately greeted us and sat us right away.  Granted, no others were there at the time so I would have hoped we were seated right away!

The food was delicious and was definitely a reflection of the Thai food I've come to love.  We decided to test drive the fish cake appetizer and the Yellow Panang curry.  Both dishes were fantastic and the Panang was one of the best I've had in a while.  Plus, the thing I like the most about this place is that when you say make the food spicy, they definitely make it SPICY.  I was afraid that my spicy wasn't the disappointing spicy I get at most restaurants, but the Stick E Rice spicy gave me a run for my money.
The only thing I didn't like about Stick E Rice was the portions.  Maybe I was just extremely hungry that day or maybe I should learn to eat less (ha ha) but the portions seemed a bit small to me.  I'm usually a heavy eater and, sorry to say, the food here left me a bit hungry after all the entrees we ordered came out.

3896838,2012-01-05,2,vAuzGR-ufeLu3Y_U5UlO_w,"Note: I only give out 5 stars to restaurants that are EXCEPTIONAL, best-in-class establishments.

Oh, how I truly wish I could give Stick E Rice 5 stars! If I could grant this place 4.5 stars, I would quickly and happily do so. I spent the last few minutes debating this review with my wife, who is absolutely convinced that Stick E Rice deserves 5 stars.

This restaurant has several strong points. Their service is truly amazing. Every time I have come here, I have had the pleasure of being served by the same waitress, whose friendly greetings and smiles make me feel like a member of her family. The waitstaff is always on point, from timing courses well to clearing used dishes promptly. Drink refills are typically not an issue, unless you're only drinking water (but they never leave you wanting for a refill). The reason for this is that soft drinks are served ice cold in cans, accompanied by cold glasses filled with ice. I know that restaurants typically may profit more from serving soft drinks in cans, but I feel that better establishments provide fountain drinks with free refills.

I ordered the potstickers as an appetizer, and they are VERY tasty and lack the excessive ""doughiness"" served by so many other restaurants. I don't know if they're homemade, but I can tell you that surely you can't go wrong in placing an order for them.

I typically order from the lunch special menu, so my meal is accompanied by a complimentary soup. The egg drop soup is tasty, and served in an attractive cup with a side of crispy chow mein ""chips."" I once had a rendition of the hot and sour soup, and I honestly have to say that it needs much work to resemble a true Chinese hot and sour soup.

The main courses are always flavorful. The portions may seem small, but upon finishing my order I am always very satisfied. The pepper steak, orange chicken, pad thai and mixed vegetable options are wonderful entrees. My wife's regular favorite entree is the ""mixed vegetables with added shrimp.""

You simply must leave room for dessert!  Stick E Rice offers a dessert called ""Stick E Mango"" that is absolutely a must-have! We order it every time we come here. Every time. The sticky rice is formed in sushi-sized pieces, and bear the almost banana-like sweetened flavor of coconut. Each order is seemingly bombarded with sliced mango! The mango has always been sweet and succulent; I have never had the unpleasantness of biting into a more green or hardened slice of mango. The mango is drizzled with a sweetened coconut ""caramel.""

I absolutely cannot fathom why anyone could possibly review Stick E Rice with less than a 3-star rating! Sure, the menu may not be perfectly Thai; this restaurant has more of a Thai-Chinese fusion offering, but this combination serves to offer its clientele more choices and even a more familiar option for the less brave. The menu is also somewhat customizable to personal taste and spiciness preference.

To maybe receive a 5-star rating:
1. Serve fountain drinks with free refills. Even if free refills are not offered, at least, do not serve the soft drinks in cans! That's what I would expect at a home BBQ, not at a nicer restaurant. At a minimum, to preserve the appearance of ""freshness,"" the soft drinks could be served in unopened, chilled glass bottles. I still prefer and strongly recommend the fountain drink option for cost effectiveness and ""friendliness"" when serving very spicy food that may need to be frequently washed down.
2. The restroom is very clean and spacious, but one must pass the register area and the doorway to the kitchen in order to access the restroom. I understand that this is a small business, but the area near the register should be kept clutter-free. I saw stacks of various papers, mail and other things which gave the appearance of an ""amateur"" business. Clean that area up, especially if it's visible to clients. The kitchen is quite clean from what I could see. Then again, I shouldn't be able to see into the kitchen. Due to design limitations, a door is an unsafe option, but perhaps a sheer curtain or something may be put up to obscure the customer's view into the cooking area, and to somewhat muffle the noise coming from the kitchen into the dining area. I don't know what options are available, but that's not my job, is it?
3. Move the music system to the back counter, out of sight.  At a minimum, hide the speaker wires or install some recessed or wireless speakers.
4. Refine the menu more (i.e. hot and sour soup).",AZUF5EVwh-W08nrFTbKM4A,7,5,4,_XTp188xOU3MPCNUkEfT6A

3988737,2011-03-04,6,vAuzGR-ufeLu3Y_U5UlO_w,"Wow...I'm forcing myself to yelp about this place during my trip to Vegas last week.  We came with 9 of my friends all from Southern CA where there's an abundance of GREAT Thai restaurants in OC and LA.  We checked the site out at the hotel and the pix and reviews convinced us to try it out.  Let me start my review to get this over with.  This is what we ordered:

APPETIZER:
01.  2-Fried Tofu served with Sweet Sauce ($4.95) - 3 Stars
 - This was probably the better dish of them all.

02.  2-Fish Cake ($7.95) - 2 Stars
Fried Fish Cake served w/ Sweet Chili Cucumber Salad, Crushed Peanuts
 - We couldn't taste anything but SALT SALT and more SALT.  This was the point of the dinner we got pitchers and pitchers of H2O to relieve our OVERDOSE OF MSG.  We were thirsty the entire night after leaving the restaurant.  Some of my friends had headaches from the MSG.  

03.  Fried Calamari ($7.95) - 2 Stars
Deep Fried Calamari served w/ spicy dipping sauce
 - The batter on the Calamari was not crispy, yet more oily.  The calamari itself was super chewy.  Needless to say, the dish remained on the plate.  I gave it 2 Stars for the presentation but not for flavor/taste.

SOUP:
04.  Tom Kha - flavor of Tom Yum but w/ Coconut Milk ($8.95) - 2 Stars
 - The Chicken in the soup was very under cooked to the point it was still slimy in texture.  We couldn't shake it out of our heads.  Definitely one of the WORST one in my lifetime of eating Thai food.

05.  Hot & Sour Soup ($7.95) - 1 Star
Chicken, Tofu, Bamboo Shoots, Carrots, Mushrooms, Eggs & Chilis
 - This soup could not even be reviewed.  We didn't know what it was.  In our heads we were imagining Hot & Sour Soup but got a bowl of water and veggies instead and there wasn't any flavor that resembled the original soup.  

SALADS:
06.  Larb w/ Ground Pork ($8.95) - 2 Stars
w/ Spicy Lime Dressing, Red Onions, Green Onions, Cilantro & Romaine Lettuce 
 - Spices were totally OFF.  This dish is usually really spicy and should have the balance of lime & spices but it lacked it so the dish was very plain.  We asked for lime & chilis and made our own sauce.  

07.  Papaya Salad ($8.95) - 3 Stars
Sliced Green Papaya, Tomatos, Green Beans, Peanuts, Dried Shrimp & Spicy Lime Dressing
 - This salad was good in presentation but it lacked the right amount of spices that this dish calls for.  We asked for ""SPICY"" and still it was not even spicy at all.

CURRIES:
08.  Green Curry ($8.95) - 3 Stars
Green Curry, Coconut Milk, Bamboo Shoots, Jalapenos & Sweet Basil Leaves
 - This surprisingly was the 2nd better dish of the evening.  The color and flavor of the curry was mild and the one dish where we asked for spicy actually came out SPICY.  We have a winner....

NOODLES/RICE:
09.  Pad Thai ($9.95) - 1 Star
Medium Rice Noodles, Chicken, Eggs, Bean Spouts & topped with Peanuts
 - The color of this dish was so light it didn't look like Pad Thai at all.  The dish also lacked the traditional flavors, it tasted more like soggy rice noodles dipped in a sauce with steamed veggies.  Definitely an eye sore and dissapointment to any taste buds.

10.  White Steam Rice ($1.00) - 5 Stars
This was the only item on the menu that we ordered that had the flavor and texture right.  Some would say, ""You can't mess up steam rice!"" but trust me...some can!!!!  Best dish of the night! 

SERVICE ($ FREE) - 5 Stars
I will have to say they were very friendly and fast to serve.  They kept asking us where we were from and really tried to accommodate us with anything we asked for.  Good Service.   

DECOR - 5 Stars
The inside of the restaurant was nice and modern.  The Space was comfortable and clean.  The restaurant sign is a tad bit on the DARK side so you might just drive right by and miss it.  

NOTE TO THE WISE - DON'T DO IT....GO SOMEWHERE ELSE.  Unless you just want to support their business....you'll love the service!",t_ZPq_AJB0MQs4b-EX56Mg,5,2,2,ECrVbs9_KCpQjBEKyq-VFw
4154399,2013-04-02,2,vAuzGR-ufeLu3Y_U5UlO_w,"My family and I get food from this restaurant quite often. I've been to many Thai places around Las Vegas and was very impressed with this restaurant. I judge every Thai place by one dish the first time - Spicy Mint Chicken. If it's good, I'll try the Tom Yum Gai. If both are good, I'll frequent it for a long time. I've had both at this place and I have had great experiences. Delicious! 

I've ordered a large amount of food from Stick E Rice as take out and delivery was fast. I've dined in and compared it to the average Thai restaurant and the ambiance is pretty nice in comparison (for the area as well). Usually if a Thai restaurant doesn't have some degree of dumpiness to it, I'm very skeptical. However, this one was very nice and clean. 

They don't serve alcohol, but you can bring your own. I saw some people had wine. I bought some beer from the Mexican Market next door. I totally recommend going to Stick E Rice, but I think some people will be turned off at the part of town it's in. I live around here and went to UNLV, so I found this pretty nice by the standards I've been accustomed to.",lTrFOWPEb_NkbOLNN9Dkrg,3,2,4,bY72LZljSaBZvuKvRUOR9g

I had wondered about this place, since I saw the signs on Eastern Avenue, a while back. I checked it out on Yelp; not many reviews but there were some good ones that made me even more curious. I also checked out the menu online, too. I've been wanting to check out new places lately. With Sunday's visit to Lobster Me, this made two out of two (in terms of satisfaction with the good food). 

Located on the opposite side of the Ross strip mall, and across from Chase Bank, it's easy to miss this place, because it is right next door to a sports bar. Not quite a hole-in-the-wall, this little restaurant with 12 tables really has an elegant feel (three wood plank accents and bright red giant scroll like wood cutouts all on one side, no alter, no gold, one single framed print of Thai royalty), especially with soft jazz music playing in the background. The shape is a rectangle, with three rows of tables, the middle being the tables with the soft cushioned chairs, and the outer rows with dark wood tables and chairs (could be cherry wood or mahogany). There are two small chairs to wait for take-out, I'm guessing, and the host desk/podium (it's very long, similar to a hotel lobby) is at the very front, in front of the kitchen. When we walked in, my husband asked me if I wanted to dine in instead of doing takeout. He said the atmosphere was really ""unexpected."" It's very pretty inside. 

The extensive menu (appetizers, soup, salads, thai, chinese, all time favorite- chicken teriyaki, curries. noodles, rice, lunch specials- 20 of them for $6.95, sides, and desserts) featuring Thai food, also serves Chinese food- 18 selections including sweet & sour, beef & broccoli, and orange chicken. The type of dish (chicken/pork/beef vs. tofu/vegetables) is priced at the top, unless otherwise noted.

We decided on two things we both like: Yellow Curry Chicken @ $8.95 at spice level 2  (1-5) and Combination Fried Rice (chicken, beef, shrimp, and pork) @ $10.95. A short wait later, we got our food (there were a couple other parties besides us). The food is served on simple white platters (continuing in the restaurant's theme on elegance). The portions were pretty good. In addition to the curry dish, came a small white container of white rice. My husband said that the curry was not a 2, and after I tasted it, agreed, and said it was more like a 3, but I think it was a tad too spicy for him (but he ate it anyway, haha, but was sniffing afterward). I added some red pepper flakes (I like it spicy and my husband can't really enjoy spicy foods). There was really good flavor on both dishes. What I really liked was that the chicken and the rest of the meats were good cuts (and not too large, like Panda Express,with their oversized veggies), no tubes, no veins, no hard parts, no cartilege. The fried rice had a good amount of assorted meats, which kinda surprised my husband. They didn't skimp. 

Our server was very nice (and kept the drinks refilled), but her english was a bit limited as she did not know what cilantro was (kinda strange, unless the server is new, should know the dishes, so you'd think, right?). The other server was also checking on us too, every so often. Good team work.  

All in all, it was a very nice meal (we were celebrating my husband's promotion), good service, pretty atmosphere, decent prices, so I'm sure we will come back again. I want to try other things on the menu. And as I was composing this review, my husband wanted me to tell you all, that he is currently ""burping up dinner and it still tastes good."" Yes, those are his exact words.",fiGqQ7pIGKyZ9G0RqWLMpg,1,0,5,DLexVbrS7wThmtNZmrODFg

First the atmosphere in the restaurant is really nice considering the area that it is in. nice contemporary/relatively modern art work on the walls. Simple furniture design, and fresh flowers on display. One thing I always consider is how clean the bathrooms are, and their bathroom is always clean. As for the food, I've only been to their lunch special for 6.95. If you dine in your receive about a 5oz cup of soup, your entrée, rice, and typically two oranges slices that always perfect cut for you to just gobble up without having to worry about the skin/film that usually encases each wedge, a nice touch. The portion size is perfect for lunch, not too big and you don't feel cheated. They do their spice on a level 1-5 with 1 being the lowest. Today I ordered 4 hoping for a kick. The spice level wasn't even comparable to Flaming Hot Cheetos (Cheetos are more spicy!) So if you like it hot, ask for an extra spicy 5! The staff is wonderful and never cringes when you ask to split checks. The speed of the food coming from the kitchen is very quick and the food is most delicious. I will happily continue to come here to dine again and again. The quality and portions are consistent and who doesn't love great service!",hkHkvgNklP236_fs4d9iCQ,0,0,4,sxjmCKbh5M-80WrZCGnK6A

5 Stars alone based on the Tom Yum.  I'm amazed that this place is empty most of the time, I don't mind it but this is my new favorite place to come to since I live near by.

I love the vibe of the place, it feels like a modern authentic mix and it pretty relaxing.  The service is top notch and I have no complaints.  I know the location is a little bit hard to find and it's right next to some pub but there is plenty of parking.

I've only tried a few things.  Again, the Tom Yum soup (with shrimp) is hands down the best soup I've ever had.  It always delivers, the mix of lemon grass and all of those fun seasonings is awesome.  

I tried the Thai chicken on a stick (I don't know what it's called, but it came with peanut sauce).  Fantastic!

Their BBQ chicken is pretty sweet as well.  I would love to give more of a review on the curry and whatnot but I have been here a couple of times and know this place takes pride in their food.  You can't really ask for anything more.

Prices are reasonable.

4451829,2013-10-22,1,vAuzGR-ufeLu3Y_U5UlO_w,"So close to home and much better than any Thai food I've had on the East side. Gotta go with 4 stars for Stick E Rice.

They are located in a shopping mall off of Desert Inn. You'll see them next to a Mexican grocery store and a UPS shipping store. I've driven past them countless times, but never really gave much of a thought to going until yesterday when I was dropping off stuff to ship at the UPS. The lunch specials caught my eye - $6.95! Now that's what I'm talking about.

The dining area is super nice looking, almost *fancy*. Believe me, you will be surprised to walk in here from the outside. There was nice music playing overhead and I was greeted quickly by the two women at the back counter. Although I was interested in their lunch specials, they did not really have what I wanted so I ordered from the normal menu instead (to go).

Panang Curry with Chicken (heat level 4 out of 5) - Pretty good, but the chicken had a bit of an odd texture to me when I got it home and began eating it. The spice was right on par. I definitely got a little sniffy while eating it. I wish there had been a few more vegetables/peppers. Came with a very small container of rice (I usually get more rice at other places, even when I order to go).

Thai Iced Tea - Pretty much Thai iced tea. Although they very nicely put a sleeve around it with a handle so I could carry it out to my car with no problem.

Final thoughts - I'll be back when I'm in the mood for Thai and I don't want to trek across the valley. This is very close to home for me and they are definitely THE cleanest looking Thai establishment I have been in on the East Side. I would also love to dine in to enjoy the ambiance of the dining area.

4687567,2012-09-06,0,vAuzGR-ufeLu3Y_U5UlO_w,"I originally planned to check out another Thai place further down on Desert Inn but ended up here instead. 

Stick E Rice is located in a strip mall so there's plenty of parking. They have menus outside the door so you can check out their offerings without even stepping in. But once you step inside you'll find a contemporary designed place with the obligatory picture of the Thai King on the wall. It has a relatively nice ambiance to it. 

Service was prompt, and my egg flower soup appetizer arrived fast. I snapped a picture of it as I was impressed by how they presented it. And it tasted as good as it looked. Their Thai Iced Tea was pretty much the same as what I've found from here to LA. It was good enough though that I finished it. 

To give them a fair comparison I ordered Mint Chicken or Chili Mint Chicken and to be honest I wasn't all that impressed. The rice had a little bit more flavor to it, but Komol's offering is just a little bit better, and a bit more spicy. I asked for medium heat and was not impressed with the heat in the dish. 

Overall while I like this place it's not a good value for the money. I can spend almost $1.50 less at Komol for the total bill and get an egg roll and ginger salad that Stick E Rice doesn't offer. 

Overall as I've had a lot of Komol lately, Stick E Rice was a nice break, but it was more expensive for what I ordered and I got less. I'll file them away as a lunch choice and to make a second visit but I don't see them making it onto my regular lunch rotation.",HEvyblFw4I-UsMqgPGYY_Q,6,3,3,M2MULS92aDoj9_weTxHAnQ

Me and my hunny had passed this place several times. And not sure why, but we finally decided to give it a try.

You walk in and they have mellow jazz playing, very nice decor, it is very clean to the eye and a friendly staff. 

I placed my order to go.

Papaya Salad.
Combo Appetizer
Spicy Catfish.
StickE Wings
Pad See Ew 
Beef Noodle Soup.

When I had placed my order there were only two parties dining at the time. Shortly after I walked in another gentleman walked in to place an order to go as well, and two more parties. 

I waited and waited. Everyone else who came in after me received their order before me. I only remained patient because I the patrons were saying how good their food was. So all in all, I waited close to 45 minutes for my food which should not have taken that long.

Papaya Salad - one of the worse that I have had in Las Vegas. No Flavor at all. Papaya didnt taste fresh, like it had been shredded for days and just sitting there waiting to be made. Maybe they used an old papaya, I dont know.

Combo Appetizer - disappointing for a lack of better words. Filling in the eggrols was mushy and wet. Crab rangoons had no crab in it at all, not even imitation crabmeat - just creamcheese filling. So why call it crab rangoon and not a fried wonton??? Pot stickers were limp and skimpy on filling. It's like the dough was jumping off of the meat trying to escape. and the fried wontons were basically that, fried wonton skins. Pretty disappointing for $10.

Spicy Catfish - Was actually okay, but overpowered by bell pepper and not so much catfish. 

StickEWings - I was actually really anxious to try these, they made it sound soooo goood. Bland and flavorless. Please pass on these.

Pad See Ew - this was actually the best thing we had ordered. Noodles were pretty tasty. 

Beef Noodle Soup - the flavoring in the broth was off. The beef in it was hard and chewy. It was also very oily. 

I am amazed that this place has such a good rating overall. I just don't get it. Their decor is nice, the staff friendly but the food was soooo disappointing.
