15264,2013-07-21,0,yVmJdzstj6fQf7DyObvB7A,"Stayed in Vegas and needed a late night delivery place....Found this place on the EAT24 app. We were craving Philly Cheese Stakes so my BF and I each ordered one. They took FOREVER to get to our hotel and once they were there the delivery guy wasn't too smart as to trying to find our room. (In his defense it was a little confusing and quite dark) Once we got our food up to our room it was slightly cold....The sandwich had good flavor but it could've used more ""STUFF"". The filling inside of the bread was a little on the short side....and the bread was a little hard/burnt in some areas. But mostly good. I am a person who loves salt and doesn't mind it on my food....however, even for me the fries had waaaayyyy too much seasoning salt on them. It was like they poured it on and the top fell off and smothered the fries. My boyfriends were salted fine though...just mine were a little much. Overall, not too bad for a place that has free delivery and stays open pretty late. Good for Vegas!",2knKmIS2P26HkfiuHUEl1Q,1,0,3,GwXGUvHnGuqcOLWCgXvRmw

Pizza: 4/5  All the toppings were delicious but it was cold and not fresh tasting. Tasted like it sat for an hour in the guys car.

Delivery: 1/5  I dont care if its free, it still takes 1 hr 45 mins to the strip.

1267298,2016-04-25,0,yVmJdzstj6fQf7DyObvB7A,"We live across the street so we ordered to pickup a cold Italian sub and a spinach and pepperoni calzone and I asked for two extra sides of ranch (this was all off of the Eat24 app) when I got here they said ranch was extra and that the amount I paid on the app didn't cover it. I'd didn't mind so I pains anyways. 

When we got home the fries where a little stale and corner of the sub was a little soggy but over all it was alright. Not worth $9. The subs from subway taste better then this and they're only $5. 

The calzone was the greasiest thing ever. It tasted alright but it was also kind of stale. It was pretty large. Maybe if it had been fresh made...

Oh and the ""ranch"" was SOOOOO WATERED DOWN LIKE MY GOODNESS. We opened it to pour some on the fries and it turned clear when it touched surface because it was so watered down.  

We only spent about 24$ and it was a lot of food so I guess not too expensive but not worth it tbh",jEWNvHUoeJACjv_eJ2Xu2A,1,0,1,xTjExWFGOeGsA9xWMlM2Rw

1391735,2014-01-31,1,yVmJdzstj6fQf7DyObvB7A,"Review based upon late night delivery...

Delivery took a bit longer than anticipated, although I'm not sure if I should attribute that to the EAT24 services or to the kitchen at Johnny's.

Just to be clear, the caprese salad is not what you're picturing in you're head.  Its a bed of greens, with some tomatoes and shredded mozzarella dribbled on top.  It wasn't necessarily bad, just untraditional and slightly misleading?  The pizza was cold and salty, but I agree with one of the previous reviewers that the toppings were tasty.  I guess you get what you pay for.

Carrot cake totally passable on as well.  Would not bother to order at this restaurant again, despite the free delivery fee and the late hours.",4NfIpag40h-YuBz461eGFg,2,0,1,nuIK5wvxvHfVNT8IIupj2g
1497086,2016-03-10,0,yVmJdzstj6fQf7DyObvB7A,"First of all- Did this establishment change names? I received a brochure in my apartment door about 2 weeks ago so today I decided to try it out. The Menu says 'All City Pizzeria' but has the same exact address as Johnny's pizza...so that alone is confusing as is. If I could give this establishment 0 stars I would have. I ordered my cheese steak sub and mozzarella sticks at 1:08 pm and was told it would be delivered in 40-45 minutes by the lady on the phone. I called at 2:30 PM because I still had not received my food and was told ""ummmmm, hang on.......... It left 10 minutes ago so it should be there in 5 - 10 minutes (click). Needless to say my food did not arrive at my door until 3:00. TWO HOURS AFTER ORDERING. The delivery boy didn't even have a pen on him so I had to search for one in my apartment to sign my receipt since I paid with a CC over the phone.  And of course, as expected, when I opened the bag of food, it was all cold and soggy and gross. I microwaved it to heat it up and try to salvage it. Took one bite of my mozz sticks- cheese was hard as a rock. I gave up on that and moved on to my cheese steak sub and I wouldn't say it was HORRIBLE but it certainly wasn't good by any means and the whole entire sub was just peppers, onions, and what tasted like fake cheese with a few scattered pieces of meat...... If i wanted a pepper and onion sub then I would have ordered a pepper and onion sub.. not a cheese steak! Anyway- I will never be ordering from this place again.

1722536,2014-09-13,0,yVmJdzstj6fQf7DyObvB7A,"Ordered delivery. Food was not good. The chef needs to chill out with the garlic! I ordered the Alfredo pesto pasta with shrimp. It was so disgusting. Tiny mini shrimp and the Alfredo had raw garlic throughout. I couldn't eat it. It came with over buttered raw garlic bread, couldn't eat that either. Than the side salad with ranch dressing. The ranch was a paste and it tasted like raw garlic again. My husband ended up having delicious ribs and wings. They sent him the incorrect wing flavor. Recipes need to be fine tuned, add roasted garlic or be lighter on the garlic, add milk to dressing to thin it out, get rid of the small insect looking shrimp it's nauseating.",s5tu89p6tsTcjNP4HVbN7w,1,0,1,DNSTQLu3L1vB9o7Wsi2NCA

The Ranch dressing was disgusting. -- The Chicken Pesto pasta was the worst. It had no flavor and was super dry... the pesto sauce had no flavor and (was not fresh) looked like it came out of a jar from the grocery store. The chicken was super dry and had no flavor as well.

My friends and I got into Vegas Thursday night and we decided to order delivery to our hotel room. We got almost $70 worth of food. When the driver got here, he was super rude and didn't seem to give a damn about anything. After breaking into the food, we were missing a portion of what we ordered. So I called to tell them that there was food missing and the person on the phone said they would have the driver send it. About 25 mins later,  I get a call saying they are now getting ready to close and they will not be sending me the food, which I already paid for! I asked for my money back, the workers were all snickering in the backround, and told me all they could do was give me credit for the next time I order.

The person on the phone taking our order was very rude. She kept asking for the address but if you brought menus here dont you know where it is? Why is the name of the hotel not enough? She kept asking for my credit card number before I was done ordering. She said 45 minutes for delivery. After 90 mins I call back and she says the delivery man already left he will be there any minute and hung up. When he finally gets there the order is WRONG and there are no napkins or silverware. On a brighter note, the wings were good although they were not the flavor we ordered. The pizza was not hot and had a very fishy smell. We discovered it had shrimp on it which is weird because it was supposed to be a philly cheesesteak pizza. We also ordered a gondola. It looked pretty but we specifically said scrambled eggs but it came sunny side up.

5030249,2013-04-14,2,yVmJdzstj6fQf7DyObvB7A,"This was another random delivery place we tried since it happened to stay open late.  The garlic balls were actually really good so we were not as upset that they had forgotten the marinara sauce.  A pet peeve of mine is when places that have take out service do not realize that salads need to be in a separate bag from the hot food and the salad arrives wilted and inedible...this is a business that did take the extra care to pack the salad separately, which is a plus.  The bf enjoyed his Cobb salad since it had the actual sliced blue cheese.  I ordered a burger and although the patty was fresh and thick, it was a bit undercooked (I asked for medium well and it was actually medium rare-I like my steaks medium rare, but ground beef needs to be cooked a bit more)...and there were no condiments on the burger at all!  It made for a forgettable burger since I do not care for bland, dry food.  The delivery was efficient and polite so we added a few bucks to the delivery charge.  The prices were comparable to the competitors...beats eating at an expensive establishment on the strip any day, especially on a night when we did not plan to go out.  This was one of the okay experiences we have had with the random pizza places we end up ordering from on a late weekday nigh when in town.",p3rQEm0gp2UsR4Rwh6FirA,1,1,3,5lhIAyy2WtnpOjGEQzne5g
