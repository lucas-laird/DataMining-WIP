Before we ordered, we asked how spicy their food was, so we didn't go for the hottest level.  But the mid level was enough to make my head sweat.  In addition to the spice, their dishes had all the right Thai flavors, coconut was strong, curry was good, basil was plenty and the dishes were not salty.  Their deserts were good and not typical.",pbQOE1KXmI2vWoZWxPE0OA,0,0,5,ql_R_sIisaROTZAwKhQnJQ

I ordered the pineapple fried rice, after about ..... 25 minutes.......it came in a really pretty shape,all the decorations are really nice, with real pineapples. However, the taste is not comparable to how it looks. I ordered medium spicy, came out to be only sweet. Asked the waitress for extra hot sauce....after another 10 minutes.....it comes. Another thing is the pineapple fried rice is $15.95 at this place and menu says it comes with shrimp and chicken...I was thinking that because of the shrimp it costs this much.....however.....only two pieces of shrimps were there....to me ...$15.95 is all for the decoration and the raw pineapple they give...which I can get with $2 from a grocery store....Overall, it's not worth it...and too few waitress for the customers....I will not come back again.",qU2HXSPSnS-L0uJeqAeY3A,0,0,3,xaVrF5ycsIINBOLygCUq5Q

The servers with jacket suit also known as 'taxi bike' in thailand greeted us and seated us shortly without having to wait! Server then suggested on the right menu which they offered such as southern authentic thai food along with Boat noodle soup! Their level spicy is something to be careful of. I picked a level 4 which is perfect!! Food arrived shortly, and taste better than I would've imaged! My favorite dish so far is boat noodle soup! 5 stars right there.

It was way too tart for my liking, but the waiter did warn me. They have many fancy drinks and I'd recommend trying one. I also had the tofu pad thai. The tofu was flavorfully marinated. Pad thai was delicious! 

The only negative is the thai bread. I saw it on the specialty menu and ordered it. Turns out, it was just Hawaiian rolls split in half with thai tea flavored sauce in the middle. Trust me, it sounds way better than it tastes. It was not very inspired. And it cost $8, which is almost as much as my entree.

1166471,2017-12-04,0,4Pl-ziYL2oerGyIPlwVdmA,"I'm in love again with Thailand ! This place is just like eating in a cute market area, where there are the best of street foods, and this restaurant adds an even more layer of value, with specializing in Southern Thai Cuisine. The kind you will only find in Thailand itself , or at the home of someone from the South cooking for you .

The desserts and drinks are a whole other story! Desserts that are mainly found in street vendors in Thailand or temple parties at special ceremonies. Just so impressed. It has to be my hands down new favorite Thai Spot. Sorry KhunChai.

The service is kind and efficient and the head server is the best! Service with a flair! This place is super cute and nostalgic to being back in Thailand and walking a street food market as the sun goes down. The energy is radiant and you will thank me later !!! I wish on one or 2 nights they can stay open til 1am just so us in the restaurant industry can stop in after work ! We are always hungry after work and need new places to try . 

The green tea was lovely . Bael juice ( exotic fruit which has a caramel taste and is great for digestion) so refreshing .

Shumais for apps! Just perfect! They prepared them there !!  
Then for main we shared the fishball curry with noodles and vegetable accompaniments . Very Southern dish , but so flavorful. 

For dessert we tried the Taro dessert with taro ice cream in the center, over banyan sticky rice, next to fresh mango, palm fruit, sweet red bean, steamed ube, steamed taro, with soft bread cubes. Very typical style dessert found all over. 

You will love it here. Follow their IG page it's very fun, and goes in to Southern Style Thai food

I want to start by saying I love Thai food, and by that I mean authentic Thai food and not the muted version you get at most places here in the US; stuff like my Thai girlfriend's parents make (see Jade's review).  This place definitely delivered on that authenticity on my first visit.  The price is only slightly higher than most places but you definitely get that value.  Dinner for two of us was $32

I had the Thai Boat Noodles at medium spiciness and the Chrysanthemum Tea.  The tea was absolutely perfect and comes topped with shaved ice and a hibiscus in the most beautiful Thai ceramic.  

The noodles were fantastic and the broth was dense and flavorful with the perfect amount of oil. It was honestly too spicy for me, I was pretty noticeably sweating but despite the pain I couldn't stop myself from going crazy on those noodles.  The beef practically fell apart in your mouth and was packed with flavor.  

The only constructive feedback I have is that my noodles were a bit clumped together but a few seconds of work with the chop sticks pulled them apart.",K-lTZ0fEhV61M5LqPK-M5g,0,0,5,a4ZRd1eYH42qCnPaZkE7gQ

People eat with their eyes first, and when everyone these days snaps photos of their food, the social media marketing is a huge benefit to small family-run restaurants like this. Chuchote stands out by having a strong traditional vibe and several southern Thailand specialties on their menu.

Start with their handmade samosas or a refreshing drink with longan or lychee, then bring on the spice! Their curries are solid, with the pumpkin being a favorite. Get this with fried tofu for more texture, 'cause the silky, spicy sauce doesn't need to be overwhelmed by added protein. Their noodle dishes like Drunken Noodle and Pad Thai are on point, with balanced flavors, chewy noods, and crisp, fresh, vegetables. Venturing to the specialties portion of the menu, the Ka Nom Jean Nam Ha Pla (a flavorsome fish ball curry) is served with fresh noodles and raw vegetables and is a textural adventure for your whole mouth. Their portions are ample enough that I still have yet to try any of their desserts.

They have Southern style dishes that are truly  spicy and have unique flavors that are different from the typical Thai restaurants in the States.

All the food is presented/garnished very beautifully...even the drinks. And their offerings of desserts is plentiful and unique.

For the Farangs (non-Thai)...their 1-10 spice levels are Thai-hot. If you normally eat spicy-hot like I do, it is best to order it medium. I always ask a new restaurant if they are Thai-hot or Farang-hot and they let me know it was the former...and I was sure glad I went with medium. By the end of our meal, my forehead was sweating and my tongue was burning, but in the most perfect way.

It is why you order a Thai Iced Tea or Thai Iced Coffee at the start of your meal, so when your tasting an amazing meal burning with chili and flavor, that creamy & sweet sip (or gulp) soothes the tongue, allowing you to go in for more glorious bites.

To complete the image of quality the food items are very flavor-able, with maybe just the right amount if spice (my tolerance if such is pretty good). There remain many more items I'm looking forward to trying and my opinion is that it's an appropriate size menu, without trying to be too ambitious.

Servers were very attentive and ambience is very pleasant. Overall, a superior experience",5uSPIf3HteX6Q4KcSpQdBQ,1,0,5,8PDxJQN-prss5HN_6kZ07Q

This Thai place is in a little strip mall down the street and perpendicular to Las Vegas Blvd. So cute with some ambiance to boot.  The service though was impeccable. A sweet duo sat and served us.  Very attentive and quite friendly.

They have a vast drink selection and while we were happy with the lychee iced tea that had two lychees in it, I did have drink every with the folks surrounding me who had ordered thai iced teas.

The food was delicious. We had come from a work reception and were on our way to the airport so we only ordered the dungeness crab rangoons and the pad wood sen with tofu to eat in the restaurant and then the mango sticky rice to go.

Hot Aromatic Green Jasmine Tea which we got to fresh pressed it on the table. Loved it. 
A great place for desert, you will see variety of delightful sweet deserts on the wall! Free shaved ice if you checked in on Yelp! 

I would give 5 stars on presentation wise. Very detail and every little things complement the palate. Great lunch combo options, good portion and affordable price. The lunch combo comes with eggroll and salad but no soup. 

Pad Thai lunch combo $8. My pad thai noodle was slightly over cooked and I was not fond of the beef texture but I did like the taste. Note the spicy level is also higher than the other Thai places in town. They have four levels: mild, medium, spicy and very spicy. I ordered the medium and it was comparable to spicy level number 6-7 at other place. 3 stars for this dish. 

Mixed veggies lunch combo $8, medium spicy. Comes with rice. Perfectly cooked vegetables. The sauce that complement the veggies mix was flavorful. 4 stars for this dish. 

Yellow curry lunch combo $8, Spicy. The curry comes with potatoes, choice of meat or tofu, onion and carrots. The curry dish was pallatable and SPICY. Comparable to 8-9 spicy level on other Thai place. 4 stars for this dish. 

Their deserts looks unique and mouthwatering so I will come back to try it!",XU-JR0vGW1_O5GmNwZ0bfQ,3,2,4,MkKNqlHDaovPfkGoDaAGiA

We ordered the Beef Salad; grilled beef, tomatoes, cucumbers, carrots, mixed greens topped with a lime dressing, Tom Yum; spicy sour soup w/ your choice of meat, mushrooms & lemongrass, Lad Nah; stir-fried noodles topped with broccoli in brown gravy, Garlic and Pepper chicken; garlic and black pepper sauce served with broccoli. Oh, lets not forget the Thai tea!

Everything that we ordered was A-mazzing! The portions were right and everything perfectly seasoned. My favorite was the Tom Yum soup, I personally love lemongrass and all the flavors in that soup were equally balanced! I pretty much ate the entire bowl to myself mind you, this probably feeds 2-4 people. ugh, I want more! 

Btw, they have have some yummy fun drinks like lychee iced tea, Thai hibiscus drink, Thai green tea, and of course Thai tea. I ordered the Thai iced tea, they serve it in what looks like a mini pitcher topped with a scoop of shaved ice to top it off! And yes, it was so good! Oh, and they shave ice and deserts.

And...the service was GREAT and they were so nice.
I think this is now my favorite Thai restaurant. I will definitely be back!

When we eat Thai style food we like to share each others meal and sample everything. They served our waters in small metal cups true Thai style. Today we started with a couple appetizers: chicken wings 4/5 which comes with a bowl of some sweet and sour sauce with hot sauce in the middle, river fish cakes 5/5 served with sweet and sour sauce topped with cucumbers and peanuts, presented on a skewer with a cherry tomato, cucumbers and fish cake halves, delicious! Mum also ordered a thai coffee which came with a ball of shaved ice atop 5/5.

In addition to the appetizers we ordered the pad si ew beef 3/5 which was just ok, the beef boat noodle soup 3/5 noodles were good but the beef was just ok, the pad thai with fried tofu 5/5, spicy and delicious, cashew nut with chicken very spicy 5/5 served with a bowl of rice, addicting, I ate every last piece! We also had the tom yum soup seafood style with mussels, squid, shrimp and mushrooms 4/5 very good broth flavor. 

For dessert there was a Yelp check-in offer for a free shaved ice, the pleasant servers combined our tables Yelp check-in offers and made it a large. We also saw on the board when entering they offered a special custard bread which was a sweet bread stuffed with homemade pandan flavored custard and we also got one thai coffee flavored 4/5.

The Thai decorations around the restaurant really make your Thai experience here worthwhile. From the music, to the colors, to the food--be prepared to be immersed in the Thai culture.

The drinks are very esthetic. Most specialty drinks come with a scoop of shaved ice on top--it's unnecessary because the drinks come with ice cubes in it already, but they're perfect for pictures! The drinks were good but still not as tasty as the drinks I had in Thailand (keep in mind that my standards are pretty high). The Thai hibiscus tasted very tart and the green Thai tea needed more flavor. Water cups are not your typical glass cup, but rather Thai inspired silver bowls. 

The pad Thai was nicely plated on a banana leaf with the peanuts, chili, and lime on separate side dishes. The presentation was very similar to dishes I had in Thailand. Each dish was also garnished with a real orchid. Presentation is everything and this place definitely gets five stars for it! The pad Thai was very tasty and they were extremely generous with the chicken! 

The Thai bread was a miss for me. It was essentially four pieces of Hawaiian rolls with Thai creme filling topped with powdered sugar. It costed $8 which seemed like a rip but they did call it their ""specialty of the day"".",g_4zySOI_HisK5rG_2dw6Q,11,8,5,MEvDa9bp3af-S3e2jmHuqw

Our waitress was super nice and was very helpful. We made a few suggestions with their drinks...like adding boba. It was perfect, regardless...and she openly welcomed it. She was informative and went above and beyond with the service. 

The food and drinks are great + the presentation was superb! I love that they separate some of the optional toppings for the pad Thai. Curry was delish! Although a bit spicy for my taste even if I asked for no spice, I'd definitely order it again coz it was flavorful. My son loved their Thai fried rice and oh my whole family loved the Tom yum!

Great service. Shout out to Nan. Family owned business and it shows that they care. She asked if I've been in before and I said it was my first visit. She explained the menu and suggested a few things with good explanations. Very nice and smiling and interactive. Answered tons of questions and never rushed things. Refilled my drink few times and even got me a tea with less ice. The other servers were great too asking if things were good while walking by, love the teamwork. 

The ice tea, even with less ice seemed little watery, not bad but tasted like shaved ice a little. I'd suggest to not put the shaved ice on the bottom or ask that they don't.

The 'I'm on a Diet' salad is awesome! Warm tofu, warm peanut dressing, mixed fresh greens, cut the tomatoes in half, thin fresh cucumber. This was so good!! Glad Nan suggested it. 

The Thai fried rice comes with choice of meat. This was also a wonderful dish. The lime and fish sauce gave it a nice flavorful spicy kick. Love the cucumber and tomato. 

Decor is nice inside. Little small but plenty of seating as it's not super busy. Located on Sahara in a dark strip mall but nothing to scary and should be easy to find and park. Music is little loud and goofy but not to bad.

Pretty solid Thai food.  Top 5 in Vegas I'd say.  Not the prettiest of locations or restaurant, but the food is served beautifully, usually with a flower and perfect plating.  We had the papaya salad, chicken pad Thai, and green curry with tofu.  We had extra spicy and had to urge the waitress not to hold back...the hottest papaya salad I've ever had was the result.  What a great dish!  The pad Thai was fine and looked nice, but didn't taste any different than the rest of the city.  Pretty large portion though; good enough for 1.5 meals.  The tofu was very good, as was the eggplant in the curry.  The curry was probably the second best dish of the night with a nice variety of ingredients from peppers to bamboo shoot, but nothing matched the papaya salad.  Though we asked for extra spicy, the papaya salad was the only ultra hot, with the other two dishes just hot.  They have some beer and wine options but not much.  I find Chuchote as a great lunch option, with some affordable deals, or take out, rather than a sit and drink type of place.  Tough place to hang on Sahara and parking can be hectic at times.  But Chuchote has some great food, and apparently great desserts if that's your thing.  Definitely give it a try.",JaqcCU3nxReTW2cBLHounA,1,1,4,jY2CjonBVaNX1MM8i2R0pg

The tiny staff was slightly overwhelmed by our hefty group of 20-- but nonetheless were super sweet, gracious, and accommodating. There were other guests dining, and there were literally two servers and one cook.

I had the amazing cashew chicken, which was terrific, but I overheard that the real dish to order was the catfish, which was ordered by several from our party.

It should be noted that I'm not big on spicy food. That said, myself and others ordered their meals ""mild"" heat, but definitely felt the burn. If you are expecting a 2 out of 10 on the spicy scale, you will actually be getting more of a 6 or 7. Nevertheless, this was nothing my white rice did not temper, and I ate every last bite.

It's evident that the folks at Chuchote take pride in their presentation -- nothing like a picture-perfect plate to get those tastebuds salivating and camera phones snapping!

We came around dinner time. To our surprise, the place was empty, but guests started to trickle in soon after. Water was served in decorative Thai bowls. The employees all wore traffic-looking vests. The ambiance is festive and warm, with pennant banners and bamboo lanterns amongst a wooden backdrop.

I have a love affair with Thai iced tea, so that was my drink. My bf opted for their lemonade. Both came garnished with shaved ice on top. Mine was served in a small glass pitcher and lemonade in a carafe. For food, I got the chicken pad see ew at 2/10. I can't really say it was anything special. There was something off about it. My bf got the chicken yellow curry at a 2/10 too, but his was pretty spicy. So spicy scale might be off or they made a mistake. 

Overall, cute place. Friendly service. Our waitress even taught us some Thai phrases to use. Don't forget to check in for a mini shaved ice. (Ours was bubblegum flavored. It was... interesting, but yours might be different.)",HcT3BZLc25R9eekoHBA1MQ,1,1,4,J5nENdd84so7h-cu1rY_ew

You also get a free desert with Yelp check in!

This is a family owned restaurant that serves Southern Thai food and was opened 7 or 8 months ago.

They have a large selection of Thai  sweet & sour drinks & traditional Thai desserts.

When I entered this place, it has a very authentic ambiance, and inviting atmosphere. I would not recommend this place for a big group as it is a small restaurant.

The food is the main reason I give 5 stars and it is fairly priced. My favorite are 
~Pad See Ew Noodles with beef. That's what I order in every Thai restaurant. Large chunks of beef on top of perfect stir fried flat rice noodles, with egg, garlic, and broccoli with black bean sauce. It was not oily compared to other places.

~Thai Sukiyaki Noodles is a stir fried silver noodles with shrimp, chicken, egg, napa cabbage, carrots, cilantro and green onion. It was packed with flavor.

The presentation of the dishes and desserts are beautiful and everything is cooked fresh to order at a spice level from 1 to 10.

Make sure you check into Yelp to get a mini Shaved Ice.

I will recommend to all of my friends and will be back soon. Woot! Woot!",8dxkcmAXY4ttrVFD1GhbdQ,4,1,5,XPzwq19OQY3d-OB9avD9XA

Fresh - all veggies crisp with no 'filler' of cabbage or onions.  The veggies are perfectly portioned so one taste does not dominate.  The meat is cut well, and the portions are more than ample with plenty for leftovers.  2 entrees feeds three.  This is a hidden gem.  Encourage this place without any reservations - and we will frequent it often.   The heat level runs hot.

We were told that the papaya salad couldn't be made vegan. First Thai place that couldn't make a papaya salad vegan, upsetting but whatever cool, no biggie. Ordered the panang tofu curry extra tofu, no fish sauce, took a little while for us to get our food no problem doesnt bother me, good food takes time I understand. Once we've received our entrees my friend points and laughs, saying we had the same quantity of tofu and we counted the pieces and both received the same amount of tofu after paying the extra for extra tofu. Cool whatever $1.50, tasted the curry. It was so salty, the server really didn't know much cause every question we asked she ran to the other server so I wasn't having it. The thai coffee was good, had it made with coconut milk. It was in a cute little pouring container with a scoop of shaved ice on top. So as of the first meal of the day, not happy. Might come back to see if I can update my review because I dont like giving a bad review to any restaurant. I understand authentic papaya salad is made with fish sauce but it's just as good made without as well. 

3 stars for the customer service, kind of hard to keep waiting on someone who needs to keep asking someone else questions. So we get overwhelmed with having to keep asking.

Service:
Very friendly. I was only here for about 30 minutes and was checked on 3 times. The waitress tried to warn me that ""Spicy"" really means SPICY, because they use fresh chilies. I thought I would be able to take it since I usually get a 4/5 or 7/10 at other Thai restaurants. Needless to say, I should have listened to her 4 or 5 attempts because I can feel the spice in my ears. I'm definitely a little baby, because the waitresses must've saw the look of pain on my face, refilled my water, and asked if I'd like some rice or extra lime juice to put out the fire in my tongue.
Atmosphere:
Very hipster, trendy. Very cute. Nice place for a cute first date.
Thai Tea:
Comes with a cute shave ice ball on the top, very creamy texture, not chalky at all. Tea was probably brewed fresh from how it tasted.
Chicken Larb:
Flavorful and fresh. Comes with greens in addition to the typical large lettuce leafs.
Tofu Red Curry:
Tofu is a good consistency, not too firm, not too soft, and fried just right. I got the medium, and it's about the same as a 7 That I've had at other places.
Flavor is great, sauce is creamy and has a nice thickness.

Our waitress was so awesome! She made sure our orders are correct, because i wanted a particular noodle for our Tom Yum soup. 

We ordered 2 drinks : lemonade and taros. They both exceed our expectation. Not only did the presentations were eye catching, but their taste bring happiness explosive to our tongues. The lemonade was just the right tartness, while the taros was not powdery, and i can taste the sweet and a little starchy after taste of taros. 

For appetizer we had pork jerky. My partner loves it, but it wasnt for me. Althought their sauce for the pork gave it a refreshing acidity compliment to the heavy fried pork. 

For entrees we ordered the shrimps pad thai and Tom Yum soup. The pad thai was AMAZING! Noodles were soft, chewy, long and didnt stick together. The sauce was even more WOW! With just the right thickness, it sticks to the noodles but didnt make them dry or too starchy. The shrimps were juicy, not rubberry, an indication that they were cook at the right temperature and time. 

Tom yum soup has just the right amount of sourness. Definitely a to go to dish if you are feeling under the weather, since it is pack with galangal roots.

We ordered Red Curry with Shrimp, Lad Nah Crispy Egg Noodle w/chicken, crispy veggie rolls , Lychee Iced Tea, and got a free mini rainbow shaved ice for checking in! 

Presentation, presentation, presentation! 
Everything was prepared so beautifully!
From the stringed beet and carrot garnishes to the mint flavored water with strawberry slice.
Quality of food, crispy noodles were crisped to perfection. Red curry was so rich and flavorful
Medium spicy was the perfect level of heat.
The shaved ice is AMAZING!!! 
We got to try a free Mini Rainbow shaved ice and didn't really know What To expect, but there was a mix of different fruits and chewy pieces of yummy goodness!  
Will definitely return! 
Everyone one at Chuchote Thai are so friendly and always have a smile on their faces while working. You can tell they love what they are doing. Bravo to you guys!! 
Thanks to all at Chuchote Thai Bistro for such a great first experience!!",g2ne7kPY3ttcd3uf0vqz-Q,1,1,5,J4Z40dzp-rTp_ZcNQLQ5aA

Don't let the location be a deterrent to trying Chuchote out.  My favorite dish here is the spicy sweet basil with pork.  Go easy on the spice level here, it is also authentic when it comes to the heat level.

The ingredients are fresh and freshly made.  You can taste they use fresh oil in their fryer and they don't freeze their tofu here so it stays tender.

I've dined in once for lunch and took out once. Both experiences were pleasant. Although the first time we went, there was a mishap happened where there was a hair in our lad nah. The lady who seemed to be a manger was gladly to take it back and make a new one for us. Since we didn't like the lad na, so we asked for pad Thai instead. I was wondering how she would take care of this on our bill. She still charged us for the pad Thai. Hence, the four star on services. I think it's the least they can do by taking out that charge. 

Food wise, most of the dishes that we tried were pretty good, but it's your standard Thai menu selection. I wish they have some duck dishes. 

1. Tom yum soup (5/5): we chose chicken. The soup was sooo good. I think it might be the fresh chili in the soup. The soup was so flavorful and it seemed more thicker than the tom yum from other places. All of us liked the soup a lot. 

2. Panang curry with beef (5/5): the beef was cooked just right and the flavor of the panang is on point. 

3. Tom yum noodle soup (5/5): like the typical one that has meatballs and ground pork. The soup was also very tasty. Like other places, this soup is usually on the sweeter side. 

4. Lad Nah (1/5): well, the flavor was so bland and it didn't help when there was a hair in the dish. Dislike. 

5. Pad kee mao (3/5): missing basil flavor. Not the best pad kee mao I've had. I wouldn't order it again. 

6. Pad Thai (5/5): nice flavor pad Thai. Get this for lunch special and it comes with one egg roll and a side salad for $7.95. 

7. Prik khing (3/5): pork belly was a bit overfried in our opinion. Not a popular dish in our group.",b7rchNJEp6Gaw0bHR-4s4g,4,5,4,U7OtKipF2Vl4pArPyOAxfQ

Warning: the food is too authentic for most American taste buds. For example, the papaya salad in most Thai restaurants in US is toned down, where it is not as spicy and not as fishy as they would serve the dish in Thailand. ***Update, not ""authentic,"" but rather North Eastern style vs Southern (Bangkok) style.

I'll list this dishes I had below and my comments:

Dungeness crab Rangoon - very generously filled crab flavored cream in lightly fried wonton. I didn't care for them.

Pad Thai - standard dish (can't go wrong), but served in a huge flat plate. But I really enjoyed it. 

Spicy catfish - so delicious. Lightly fried catfish on a bed of green string beans and peppers. However, just cuz it looks like a string bean, doesn't mean it is one! Some imposters can burn your a new one!

Tom yum - standard. 

I had a few deserts and drinks, all of them where too sweet for me. But was told that it's how it is in Thailand!

The prices are very fair and staff are so friendly. (All staff are Chuchote family members or close friends, the owners are 3 siblings photographed in the restaurant. one of them is a very great drag queen)",bIY9uH79JWBqOTlqNDpQhg,2,2,5,rvPJDjJizijwt0hxkvXMLA

5094877,2017-12-13,25,4Pl-ziYL2oerGyIPlwVdmA,"""Safe Thai food"" as Midwest poker bud calls it.

On the best of Vegas Thai spectrum, if Lotus and Chada are the authentic and Nittaya's the uhhhh Summerlin, Chuchote joins Nittaya's.  Let's just say Thai samosas?

Short menu with all the requisite standards many of which have been altered for the American palate.  For example, the boat noodles, tasty and fragrant, hint of fish sauce, lots of well braised beef but the key ingredient, blood, is missing.  No irony, mineraly taste kinda defeats the reason to eat this soup.

Props to the Tom Zaap (hot and sour soup with pork ribs, mushrooms, dried chili, fresh cilantro ginger and other root veg thickened with rice flour).  Solid chili heat that warms you from the inside.  Sweet pork ribs.  

Try the pumpkin curry (red curry with kabocha and bell peppers, and fresh basil).  Surprisingly good for a vegetarian dish.  The curry's heat works well with the sweetness of the pumpkin.  Basil brightens the dish.

The Khua Kling (stir fried ground pork, chilis, dried shrimp, fish sauce, lemongrass, galangal, kaffir lime leaves and a load of pepper) is great.  Similar to larb but spicier, with concentrated chili flavor and heat.  Great aroma, packs a flavor punch.  The Ka Nom Jean Nam Ya Pla (fish curry sauce and rice noodles with accompaniments) very well made.  Take some noodles, spoon some spicy curry over it, and devour.  Use the accompanying veggies to make a veggie wrap and eat between bites to cool the palate.  While some more authentic veg options would be nice (kafir lime leaves, cashew leaves), this is still plenty good.

Finally, do order either their longan or bael drink.  The first, sweet, clean tasting like lichee, the second creamy, with an almost citrusy marmalade, bitter undertones, similar to a custard apple.

Friendly Asian service.  A little unorganized with kitchen timing issues.  All should be corrected in time.

It doesn't break the top three but a solid addition for sure.",oeAhRa8yFa9jtrhaHnOyxQ,33,30,4,q7I6rIDnYTofjlZkoBW5aQ
5102222,2017-10-19,0,4Pl-ziYL2oerGyIPlwVdmA,"The food at this place is interesting, fusion thai/french cuisine best way to put it.  Definitely qualifies as a bistro as the food is served with unique presentation.  Traditional Thai dishes are available like panang curry, the suggestion is to order more unique items, like the beef stew curry.  

The food factor, though, did now have the wow factor.   Pretty good flavor, thick curries, great food arrangement.   But it lacked the oh my god i gotta die after eating this feeling. The beef tastes gelatinous and is in a thick sliced cut ham cut.  There's only two slices, and so the portions are rated for small to medium people just about right for 1 person.

As for the food the chicken lettuce wraps were solid, tons of flavor done well Thai style. Pork jerky was ok but not great, the star was the sauce so we kept that and put it on some rice and other dishes. The green curry with shrimp was ok nothing too special. The chicken pad Thai was good but also fairly standard. Pineapple fried rice had quite the elaborate presentation, unfortunately might have been a case of too much style over substance. Flavors were good, had a lot of pineapple, cashews and raisins.

I first came here sort of by chance and was put off by the location and the modesty of the ambiance and decor, but don't let that fool you. I don't think I've ever had such great service from any other Thai restaurant than here. They welcome you as if you were there friends and try their best to be as courteous and attentive as they can. They have a great drink menu, I recommend the lychee iced tea which is very refreshing for some of the spicy dishes. Make sure to get spices on the side if you are sensitive because the spices are very strong since they seem to be of very fine quality and very authentic. Almost every dish is great. Pad Thai, tom yum, pineapple fried rice are all amazing. Panang curry could use a bit more flavor and be a little thicker, and the tom kha could be a little less sweet/milky, but I'm just nitpicking. I've tried a lot of great Thai food from restaurants all over Cali', and imho I think with some tweaking to some of the dishes plus the already amazing service, I can totally see this restaurant take off as a top contender for one of the best Thai restaurants of its class.

Everyone there as well as the owner of the restaurant are super sweet and attentive, always checking up on us and refilling our drinks. Food tasted so close to home. We ordered the pad Thai and klua kling, both highly recommend! Make sure to save room for dessert too! They have a variety of traditional Thai desserts that brought me back to Thailand! They were sweet enough to let us try a new dessert too :) will def come back when we are out here in Vegas!",tuKJdtA1hhkF6qjWvpS6Sg,0,0,5,G7hqe1bdQLfOTaUIy_BXJw

I usually go with Tom Ka Gai at a Thai place and I think I did this time too, with some egg rolls and other appetizers.

All in all delicious.

My friend and I ordered the beef salad and crispy spicy fish. We ordered them both in mild and it tasted just a little bit more spicier than mild but tolerable. It probably wouldn't have tasted good if it weren't spicy at all so we didn't mind. 

Customer service was very friendly and attentive. We had a couple different servers come around a few times to check up and they offered good drink suggestions too. The iced lychee tea was very refreshing! Not over sweet and more naturally sweet.",SDgrUDEdWNFBlC4ufVk1PQ,0,0,5,3NWIeKiDXA9rAcjD0y-6QA

We came here on a weekday for lunch and was seated immediately. Ordered a Chicken Pad See Ew and Tofu Curry. The had a lot of cute drink options and the plates and cups they used were very detailed and added a nice touch to everything. Both entrees tasted fine but I personally preferred how they prepared tofu protein more in comparison to the chicken. The used large tofu triangles and they ask if you would like fried tofu or regular. I read comments that stated their portions are large, but when our orders came out it was very small. There were probably only five large bites of the noodle dish and very little rice was provided for the curry. I advise those that get curry to order another bowl of rice because the ratio is definitely off. Also, is you are really hungry the noodle dish will not fill you up. All in all, the flavors were decent but it did not make up for the price to portion ratio and therefore, it was not worth it. We checked in on yelp and did receive a cute little ice dessert. I really wanted to like this place, the people were very friendly. However, since I don't live in Vegas, I will probably try another place the next time I visit.",2xq3kA-X6o_wPQht76lWag,0,0,3,i3GgxEpa0hG2Nv__u7j3bQ
5840496,2017-10-30,0,4Pl-ziYL2oerGyIPlwVdmA,"Delicious! My first visit was take-out.
Ordered Tom Yum veggie soup, Basil Fried Rice, & Green Curry. 
My husband and I are vegan and they were happy to make all the dishes vegan. I didn't feel like I was playing Russian roulette when ordering over the phone if they might not understand exactly what vegan meant and the other modifications I made that the order could easily come out wrong. It was an easy phone order!
Went to restaurant to pick up food and they were extremely friendly. I was served ice water in a silver cup with a strawberry in it while I waited for the hostess to bag up the order.
It's a really cute restaurant. Very clean, great service with a very friendly staff.
Got home and food was hot and no mistakes on the order!! Every dish was perfect and delicious.
This is my new favorite Thai restaurant on the west side. I will be back!!",I438bEpwiO9HIV81IptonQ,0,0,5,_wpW5IjZAKPycnd_YEThAw
