Doesn't make it seem customer focused just want to keep the money coming in. Its a shame because it seems like an ok place.

Well, our server was great but that's about all that was. Food is less than average. Everything we ordered was either burnt or under cooked. Our server apologized and took off my daughters meal, being she barely touched it and offered us a $10 off coupon for our next visit. Still, our bill of $61, plus a $10 tip, for less than mediocre food was disappointing.

I came back here and this time I brought my whole family so there were 8 of us. I love their food so came back for a second chance and it seems like they have not improve their service yet.  First of all, I asked for one of the order to go and requested to get it out first as soon as they can and it was the very last one to served!

My vegan sandwich had two whole avocados on it it seemed & was soggy even though it didn't have a drop of sauce or even oil/vinegar - so soggy I couldn't eat it. The patty looked dry too so nothing about it was appetizing. I also ordered it with pickles on the side but they were smooshed into the ridiculous amount of avocado on the soggy bread (nothing good about this mess.)

We also got the vegan potatoes which were supposed to come with scrambled tofu but came with weird cubes of tofu instead, plus it looked like again they have no idea what vegans eat so threw a bunch of veggies together with no rhyme or reason.

638276,2017-01-08,0,XvOzizKafffkMuk-tIdNcQ,"Came in excited and left underwhelmed. Where to begin..

Walked in on a cloudy Sunday morning around 10:30am and as expected there was a packed house! Which I don't think is a negative right away.. there has to be a reason right?!  ...The food is great and they don't have enough tables to seat everyone or the service is long and slow.. hmmmm. We were a party of 3.. my wife, daughter and of course me. We waited longer than needed as there were empty tables that needed to be cleaned. The place had personality as there was writing on the walls - that kept us entertained as we waited.
Once we were seated the server was friendly and took our order. Our coffee and drinks came at a reasonable time. The coffee was good. Then we waited, and waited, and waited. As we looked around several others were growing restless waiting for their food. It was obvious by the looks on their faces. We had a few coffee refills and then waited and waited and waited. We watched as parties that arrived after us were served first, yet there were several people with empty cups and no food in sight. Finally, after what felt like a 20 to 30 minute wait the food arrived. It looked okay. I ordered the Racy Tracy, wife ordered So Cal Low Cal with side of fruit, and daughter ordered a teddy pancake. The Racy Tracy was loaded with bacon that didn't look freshly cooked, tasted below average. The potatoes were good (4 out of 5) nice and crispy but the omelette was bland and flavorless (3 out 5 at best). My meal came with toast and I got ONE piece cut in half (who does that?) - it is standard to get two pieces. My wife did not enjoy the So Cal Low Cal. Flavorless and earthy. She had to smoother it in Cholula hot sauce (1 out of 5). The fruit was a 5 of 5 - large portion, fresh, yummy.  My daughter's $6.50 pancake was chewy. Not fluffy, nothing special except the teddy shape. We had to use a knife to cut it - not appetizing.  It's hard to mess up a pancake, but this was not good. 
The service was below average. They were friendly and nice, but disorganized and all over the place.
When our bill came it was about $50 (for an average at best breakfast). Luckily we had a coupon for a free kids entree (the pancake). 
We left less than impressed or satisfied. We would have been better off at a drive thru. I would not recommend this place nor would I return. This is unfortunate because we love eating out and love to see new places succeed. This place's claim to fame is that it was featured on a food network show.

The menus is overwhelming, it's huge and not exactly easy to navigate. The bright side to this is nearly everything looked or sounded good. 

The staff couldn't have been any nicer or more attentive. Our food came out in a timely manner as well. As for the food; I thought it had great flavor and was prepared well. The only negative for me was that the potatoes were greasy, at least for my taste. I don't usually eat food that heavy so when I come back I'd probably order off of their lighter menu.

1255388,2017-08-04,0,XvOzizKafffkMuk-tIdNcQ,"Positive: Friendly and attentive staff. Large portions. HUGE Menu that includes Vegan & Gluten Free options.

Other: Maybe we just didn't order the right things. 

IMHO there are two kinds of successful breakfast places in Vegas. Simple and cheap (like any of the downtown casino breakfast places) or more creative and expensive (like EAT or Rise & Shine). I'm willing to pay $30 or more for an exceptional breakfast for two - otherwise, I'll go pay $5 at a cheap and easy diner. So unless you're doing something interesting, eggs and toast is eggs and toast. Why pay more? Our total here (including coffee) was $34 (which was partially covered by a groupon purchase). Squeeze In had the high prices without the food to match it. 

I got the ""Southwestern Spuds"" which the menu described as potatoes ""scrambled"" with various other things - including tofu. I was surprised to find the tofu to be just... fried tofu, kinda sitting on top of the dish (see photo). There wasn't much of it, and there wasn't any attempt to spice or flavor it at all. The rest of the dish felt similar - kinda thrown together, but very very plain.  The strongest taste was ""oil"". It was quite greasy. I guess what made it ""Southwestern"" was that it was served with a side of salsa, and came with some (plain) black beans on the side. I definitely wouldn't order it again.

My date had the ""Manly Morris Meal"" - which was your basic Eggs, Bacon, Potatoes, & Toast with a single (large) biscuit & gravy on the side. The server asked if he would like anything with the potatoes, and suggested onions. When it came out, sure enough, there were onions - but just raw onions, chopped and placed on top. Not cooked or prepared - not even cooked into the spuds -  just a couple of tablespoons of raw chopped onions for fifty cents extra. The biscuit tasted like it had been in the fridge or freezer for a while, and the gravy was bland and floury. 

I appreciate the nice environment and the friendly service. The huge portions are impressive. But I would rather have interesting and thoughtfully prepared food in smaller portions and at smaller prices.",8la7DygWKVkfpDatXztktg,1,1,3,ff6b0ty-z0FSS5ubDh9nTQ
1269422,2018-01-17,0,XvOzizKafffkMuk-tIdNcQ,"Ok, so I'll start with the good. Our server Jhalisa was a rockstar. She was on top of everything. Always had coffee and water, and she was friendly and helpful. The portions were excellent for the price. My daughters pancakes were delicious, fluffy, and the sausage was delicious. The decor is funky, and I love that it's unique.

Now for the not great. The food. I had HUGE expectations after ordering from UberEats for breakfast-- the eggs benedict were great, and the fruit was fresh. When we went in... I was completely let down. The food was BLAND. The only flavor was the jalapenos in the omelette I ordered-- which should've been full of flavor. I even added avocado, and it was fresh, but we were SO bummed. My husband's omelette had zero taste other than the pastrami. The eggs were definitely fresh but severely lacking in flavor. It was like everything needed salt and pepper. The chunks of potato were huge and portions were good, but no salt, no pepper, nothing. As we're both on keto, we didn't eat potatoes, and would've loved the option to sub out carbs for protein, like we can at other restaurants.

    I always have a basic breakfast the first time a new place, 2 eggs scrambled, bacon (4 pieces, that's a lot!) potatoes & toast this is called a Rednecker.com, I think ~
    All OK, could have hotter as it wasn't cold, just not hot and we all know eggs get cool quick! They are very proud of their potatoes......nothing FAB to me and I am a potato lover from waaaaay back.

One of their specialties was the Racy Tracy Omelette.  It is a 4 egg omelette filled with mushrooms, bacon and jack cheese topped with fresh avocado.  They really are generous with the filling.  The omelette was overflowing with mushrooms and bacon.  Not complaining at all!  The side of breakfast potatoes was really a bushel of potatoes.  Your plate will be piled high with this side with plenty to take home.

The first time I had the Spanish Flay omelet. Supposedly inspired by the celebrity chef. Really doesn't matter because this is a truly delicious omelette. Today I went with the Spacey Tracy omelet . Wow was that good. Loaded with bacon, lots of avocado, and lots of mushrooms. Even better than the Spanish Flay. I opted for a side of fruit rather than the potatoes that it comes with ( an extra dollar and a half - but worth it). My wife went with the chicken tacos on the under 500 calorie menu. Tasty but not great. But for a diet meal, quite good. The servers were both extremely nice and very attentive. It is decorated with a UFO motif.

2023673,2017-01-18,3,XvOzizKafffkMuk-tIdNcQ,"Hmmm, well, I'm torn on this spot. There's goods and bads to it. Most importantly, only come here if you've got loads of time (particularly during breakfast/brunch on the weekend).

The Good:
- The decor is cute and fun. It's all Vegas and a bit kitschy. I loved all the aliens.
- Be sure to check-in on Yelp and get a free mimosa or bloody mary. (Good only for the standard mimosa and bloody mary. They do also have a top-shelf bloody mary and various mimosa flavors.)
- The menu is very plentiful. So many options to choose from!
- The wait wasn't nearly as long as we thought it would be.
- The portions are sizable.
- The potatoes are particularly yum.
- The servers were friendly.
- When someone finally asked how everything was (after we were already done eating), my friend made a face. This resulted in an apology from the guy, an apology from our server, and a discount on our bill. None of that was necessary and was definitely a sign of care and good service.

The So-So and Bad:
- One of our mimosas took over 30 mins to get. They clearly had just forgotten about it.
- Yes, everyone at our table checked in on Yelp and obnoxiously redeemed the Yelp check-in offer. But they still tried to charge two of us for our drinks.
- We were asked what kind of toast we wanted, but it was never actually served with our meals. And no one even came by to check on us after food had arrived - so there was no one to tell.
- It took 10 mins to get silverware. No, for real. And that was only when we got up and physically walked over to where the place settings were kept.
- We were asked what special sauce we wanted (they offer three kinds) and those were never served either. And again, no one checked on us, so we couldn't even ask about them.
- Our food was ok, but not amazing. And while that's not really a bad thing, considering everything else so-so/bad, the food sorta needs to make up for it.
- It was a really lengthy dining experience. Again, not necessarily a bad thing at all. But when the service is so lacking and you're missing items... Well, it makes it less of an enjoyable long experience.
- I thought the Spanish Flay was lacking in flavor. The potatoes in the omelette were under-cooked. And the bacon I paid to add-in was pretty much raw. Not appetizing.

Hmmm, so maybe, just maybe, this spot would be better on a non-weekend day? Maybe there are better menu items? I wouldn't be opposed to giving this spot another shot. But I'd probably avoid another weekend brunch trip.",YMgZqBUAddmFErxLtCfK_w,8,3,3,9cGEddAT_OsUHa-udWFcQg

2738457,2017-01-08,0,XvOzizKafffkMuk-tIdNcQ,"Ugh.  I feel kind of ripped off.  Took my daughter for brunch today and we were far from impressed.  First, we had to wait ten minutes for a table when there were at least three free.  We were not alone having to wait.  It seems that all tables have wait about ten minutes even when plenty are free.  Altogether, we were in the restaurant for 90+ minutes which is 30 minutes too long.  

Now the food.  The menu can be confusing, and a couple tables next to us were struggling to decide what they wanted.  I think the pancakes and waffles have potential, but our omelettes were simply not good.  I got the Spanish Flay and it was bland.  2/3 of the plate was potatoes and inside the dish it was 90% potatoes.  They ask if you want a sauce and I selected their ""cheese"" sauce.  It was a side of nacho cheese.  Not what I was expected for this price.

My daughter had The Biggest Little Omelette which has shrimp.  The entire dish had two shrimp in it.  Literally.   It was also very bland.

The place really seemed to be struggling.  Two of three tables next to us had some sort of comp due to issues.  One table was almost done eating before one of them got their food.

We elected not to complain as we were just sick of sitting.  

Now my biggest issue.  For two meals and two drinks (soda, not alcohol) my check was $39.  Seriously?  That much for brunch food in Vegas?  

Maybe we will come back and try again in a few months when the dust settles.  For now, we will continue to go to Truffles and Bacon in the same shopping center.  We find their food is much better and more reasonable.  In addition, Egg Works runs circles around this place.",tP_da1ZwOg31xvyKRg1XUQ,4,0,2,dLeF0ANkev2B_8jyqrY0ug

This location is fairly new with another one on Fort Apache. The restaurant is hidden in the back corner of a plaza so it's hard to spot if you don't know about it. 
One of my biggest pet peeves with breakfast/brunch restaurants is the majority have tiny portions that never leave you satisfied regardless of taste. This place doesn't have that problem. The portions are absolutely massive and delicious. I ordered the 1/4 pound King Crab Eggs Benedict which was outstanding. It came with an equally massive portion of breakfast potatoes. My gf had one of the signature omelettes that she wasn't even able to make a dent in. We also split the jack johnson pancakes which was probably a mistake in hindsight lol. It was only two pancakes but so enormous we managed only a few bites. My only complaint is the pancakes were a little too fluffy. Personally I've always liked thinner pancakes because fluffy ones make you feel the bad kind of full. 
Currently the Eastern location has a bottomless mimosa special for $15 everyday so I would definitively take advantage of that. Overall everything about this place and our brunch was outstanding, including our server Melissa.",6Vum9suFddAlYu9zQZzBeg,1,0,5,yZHfinVL_e6im1jq4Avo7g

2823499,2018-02-12,0,XvOzizKafffkMuk-tIdNcQ,"The employees are very nice. Water and coffee refilled quickly. Attentive service. Family friendly.

Just a ""heads up"" on the ""value"" of the Omelets: was told they are 4 egg omelets, but mine looked like the size of a two-egg one (so two of the eggs must have been quail eggs). My omelet was $12.99. I WAS expecting a much larger egg creation than the one I received. ALSO, you'll get only ONE peice of toast. The potatoes were the best part of the meal...though I only had a few bites, because I was looking forward to a large omelet.
My omelet dimensions were 6 inches by 3 inches...and not a fluffy 6x3.
The omelet was tasty, but seriously, it was NOT 4 regular sized eggs. I was also expected the veggies to be mixed into the eggs and then stuffed with the melted jack cheese (with a little on top)...very skimpy on the cheese, it was more like a ""suggestion"" of cheese. The veggies were sautéed and then the eggs folded around them. 
So if you're looking for a ""light"" choice on the menu, choose the omelet. However, don't think you'll order the omelet with any intention of feeling full. 

Lastly, on the wall (under the Elvis picture) there is this writing:
""Write on YELP, get a black eye."" I asked if that was a cocktail (as a reward for writing about them on YELP). Nope...no ""black eye"" cocktail. 

Maybe ""black eye"" is some sort of ""other"" reward?",GwhnN6OAj7i1X9HSj55iLw,0,0,4,EDkFsEvt2wL9NAw1pOuMlg

Dad had the pancakes which were a really good size and about a 1/4 smaller than the pancakes that they serve at Hash House a Go Go. Flavorful and fluffy. 
Mom had the Amanda Panda which was more tastier than I had thought. The turkey inside was grilled and seasoned which equals delicious. Then my aunt had the B.L.T.Ruckee Sandwich. This was very flavorful and a really good option to get if a decision needed to be made on ""what do I get?"".

2956792,2017-03-16,0,XvOzizKafffkMuk-tIdNcQ,"There are some problems at squeezed in. This is an omelette place, but their omelettes aren't great. They don't make them the traditional way. (I.e put toppings in a pan, add egg, add cheese at the end) They cook the eggs, then once completely cooked they add the toppings and fold it over. The result is an egg taco. This also means that both omelettes I've had so far (tippy Thomas & beefy blue) were way over brown and dry. They seem to notice this as the obviously overdone side (completely brown) is always on the inside. The end result is that the egg to topping ratio is way off.

My last visit my omelette was advertised as a ground beef and blue cheese omelette. What I got was the aforementioned badly cooked omelette with 2 inches of hamburger patties crumpled up inside. And no seasoning. It wasn't good. The potatoes that come with it are inconsistent. They were great the first time and bad the second. They will give you as much toast as you want so that's nice.

The other items are great. The eggs Benedict and French toast are worth getting, but they don't know how to make an omelette. I want to love this place like my wife does, but I just can't.",sVGfEoB5u5IRAQChvakONA,4,0,2,wrrNSB7fpqOYIQeFVgz1-g

 I'm a huge foodie, I love when new restaurants open up near me. 
 I was sadly disappointed, such a bummer because it's right across the street from my house. To start off prices are way too high. I know it's a chain restaurant that comes from California but this is not California clientele. Especially for the quality of food that I received on my visit. 
  Service turned off a little bit rough. When they finally took our order for drinks after sitting there for about 15 minutes, we had already decided what we wanted to eat. I dined with my fiancé and his brother. They both ordered breakfast items and I ordered a French dip with the garlic fries. After a very long wait and no refills on our beverages. My fiancé and his brothers food arrived but mine didn't. I figured it was coming out a little late, but nope. After sitting there with no food for almost five minutes and having to flag someone down. All they could say is ""we forgot"". Really, how do you not notice someone just sitting there with no food? In the meantime my fiancé gave me some of his omelette and potatoes and they were very bland to my taste, especially for the high price point. When my sandwich finally arrived my garlic fries were missing. So I mentioned something to the waitress and she apologized, and ran to get them. What arrived next were gross French fries with what looked like Lawry's seasoning. For the up charge for garlic fries this is highly unacceptable. My French dip was cold and made of deli roast beef. Not as described the menu.  There were far more disappointments when dining that day I didn't even mention. We never received any discount or any true apologies for the disappointments when dining here.

I wasn't a fan of the breakfast potatoes either as they were borderline dried out and again no seasoning and they certainly didn't look like  the same potatoes posted on Yelp!  Anyway, I will return one more time to try something other than an omelet (and no green peppers!)",CrEBVkzIQs7tS-wWfaCjNQ,1,0,3,Y6eRfYGXkoP9vXp2REmPiQ

She would bring it in. Flash forward 2 months or longer (shirt forgotten about) we go for breakfast today. 
Allie asks ""is this Holden?""
 She recognizes our son and has a shirt waiting for him!!  Blown away!!! No one cares this much about their customers anymore. Go visit squeeze In. Eastern and pebble. Great food! Seriously awesome team!!! There are so many places to eat these days.

3291306,2017-08-29,2,XvOzizKafffkMuk-tIdNcQ,"My search for favorite breakfast Vegas spot continues... 

The decor just isn't for me. Writing all over the walls is just tacky as every inch is covered. The menu is not very pleasant to the eye either. Everything has a ""pro tip"" upsell next to it, like add cheese or sauce to this and that for just $1.00. Once or twice is fine, but it's on every other food item. If the food was good you wouldn't have to smother it in sauces...

The restaurant was pretty empty at 8:30 and the service was kinda slow. The waitress didn't have any support staff and she was clearing and wiping down all of her tables alone. Normally breakfast places have a  ""turn n burn"" pace but I didn't get that vibe here which made it feel really sleepy. I wasn't in a rush but the plan was to be out in 60 minutes which couldn't have happened even if we wanted to. 

I made my own omelette and tried to be healthy with only veggies and no cheese. I never add salt to my meals when dining out, but the omelette was pretty bland. The spuds were cold which is my biggest annoyance at breakfast restaurants. Yes I know they're pre-made but that's no reason to serve them without heating them up first. 

Wasn't sure whether to do 2 or 3 stars, then I remember my coffee mug had lipstick caked on it, yuck.",dLoUSe9E25agXphQjx8Svg,4,1,2,YSYNZTULIirLnL6XBM9Xag

Wasn't a fan of the Biscuits n Gravy; the Gravy was a little waxy looking and biscuits, a little dry. Still decent, your basic B'nG dish, but nothing special. Want something special? Find out when their Chicken Noodle day is, that soup was DEEEEEEEELICIOUS. My one big change is if they could offer half size dishes as an option; prices are reasonable for the portions, but it's just a laaarge plate and I'd love to be able to do halfsies.

My husband and I were excited to find this place because you don't see a lot of ""mom and pop"" type restaurants here in vegas. The place is charming with a ""local"" feel. We went on a Sunday around 11am, so it was pretty busy, but the host cleared a table off for us quickly and sat me, my husband, and dad by the window. There are many options on the menu from the classics to specialty signature meals.  Our waitress was Allie who was fun, pleasant, down to earth and attentive. She recommended the ruby fizz (grapefruit juice & champagne) and it was delicious. I ordered the ""jack Johnson banana walnut pancakes"" and was not disappointed. Allie was kind enough to recommend the ""short stack"" and informed me the pancakes were large. I appreciated this as I couldn't finish the short stack. The pancakes were absolutely amazing! Better than expected. My dad and husband both loved their meals as well. They serve large portions so we didn't finish our plates, but we left full and happy. The overall mood of the staff feels like a family. The servers are very casual,  friendly, and help each other out, (they all look out for all the tables) so glad we sound this place.

Very cute...pancakes are of a giant teddy bear face with fruit as eyes, nose & mouth.  It has left an impression on her and always suggests to come here for breakfast.  We've come here in the past and I've had different things, omelets, scrambles...all very good.  Today we had the Jack Johnson banana walnut pancakes...just wow! SO DELICIOUS!! .  If you like bananas and walnuts...it's a must try.  Their pancakes in general are SO GOOD.  Definitely recommend this place to others and we have been.  Their decor is very cute and funny too.  It's definitely a topic of discussion with our daughter...which is nice because she won't ask for the iPad.  
Service is nice as well.  They are busy in the mornings.

We went shortly after they first opened and were there for nearly an hour before receiving our order, or at least most of it. The potatoes were missing and after another 10 minutes they finally showed. 
Ok they were new and we liked the west side location so we tried again about a month later.

3844385,2017-04-23,2,XvOzizKafffkMuk-tIdNcQ,"My first experience could have easily been a 5 star one, as my breakfast itself was FANTASTIC! The crab omelette was great, and the spuds were amazing! The cheese dip goes wonderfully with the potatoes. I even redeemed my Yelp Check in and got the Blue Tahoe Top Shelf Bloody Mary for $5. It was awesome! Not too spicy, a little extra A1 like I asked, and they didn't skimp on the vodka. 

However, aside from the actual breakfast meal itself, the experience was not good. We arrived before 11am (10:50ish) and were told it was a 15-20 minute wait. Not a problem by any means on a bright Sunday morning.

After waiting 30 minutes I asked what order we were in the line up, and we were next. No more than 5 minutes after I was told this, another group of three was seated before us, even though they had only arrived 10 minutes prior. And my 10 minutes prior to me getting there, but they only waited a total of 10 minutes or less. This is not okay; I don't care who you know at the restaurant, but we were waiting. Strike one. 

About ten minutes after that transpired, I finally went up and asked if we could be seated as there were four open tables which had been vacant and cleaned for a good fifteen minutes. They said sure, pointed out the table, and that was it. Didn't give us menus, didn't walk us to the table....rather rude if you ask me. Strike two. (To lay out the timeline, we arrived at 10:50. Were seated at 11:45. So much for a 15-20 minute wait..........)

Finally, after being seated for a while, they took our drink order. They were out of lemonade, so no Arnold Palmer for my father in law. Which he drinks EVERYWHERE. Okay, I get it. You're out of lemonade. It happens. So he orders an iced tea and asks for sweetenlow. They don't have sweetenlow. Seriously? Either someone messed up on ordering, or their food service distributor sucks. And on top of that, we had to ask twice to have our order taken after already waiting for nearly an hour. Strike three!

However, after it taking over an hour to get seated and order our food, our food came rather expeditiously and was great. This leads me to believe the problem was definitely not in the kitchen. 

I overheard two short skirmishes between waitresses that were frustrated or angry, and another table had such a bad experience I'm pretty sure I overheard the head waitress comp their whole meal. (Wouldn't have minded mine getting comped........)

Just a TERRIBLE customer service experience, and something should be done to rectify the situation so this doesn't happen again. Restaurant has amazing potential. The dining area itself is friendly, clean, and quirky, and the food is wonderful. The service staff needs to definitely step up the hell out of their game. I honestly felt like they were heavily understaffed, but there were 4 waitresses I identified, and 5 other staff members. Someone needed to step up to the plate.......


Would I come back here myself? Only if someone is going to guarantee me good service, otherwise there are plenty of other great breakfast joints in town. 

Would I recommend this place to other? Most definitely, but I'd give them fair warning that to get great food, you have to put up with crappy service.",wt57fkTOcSCYNb2fNAOlyg,5,3,3,-0wbNQ7GquiOCga_xXk1_w

I did ""squeeze in"" very close to closing time and the service I got reflected it. Had to ask for several things twice...Nobody really wants their sourdough toast to show up when their omelette is pretty much gone. Pretty sure my server left for the day halfway through my meal.

You are exceptional, and this was my first time dining in with an out-of-town guest. Menu = a smorgasbord with funny names. Food = phenomenal. Atmosphere = lively PLUS you can write on the walls; haven't been in a restaurant with this feature in a lonnnng time. 

Here's why I would give it 10 stars. Listen closely. 

Jahlisa (superb Manager) and waitress-in-training SteF top off the best features of the restaurant. They were entertaining, lively, precise, and truly cared about everyone's experience. They are 100% customer service, satisfaction guaranteed. 

Would I come back for the food and drinks? Sure, but I would mostly come back when Jahlisa and SteF are working. We need more of them in the world. Please relay! They deserve something nice...~Jamie",z8elh1mD-DDr_kuZKynVIw,0,0,5,ocJwXNQA5tZHDq4rofJdfA

I admit it, I love me some eggs. I love the taste of eggs and it's cheap. I also love eggs for their nutritional profile. It's a good source of protein, fat, and Vitamin D. I am consuming upward of 10+ eggs on a daily basis. That's on the real. That being said, I know the difference between a good omelet and a great one. Squeeze In has a great one known as the Hangover Helper and it just may be my favorite omelet in town. The Hangover Helper consist of at least 4 large eggs, tons of cheese, thick slices of bacon, diced ham, and a few sausage links. I'll treat this bad boy like a scramble and mix the whole thing before devouring it. The entire omelet is tasty, hearty, huge, and I definitely recommend. 

Squeeze In originated from Reno, Nevada. They currently have two locations in Las Vegas. Both locations can get busy during lunch. Both locations also excels at great customer service. I'm sure that I'll be back soon. 


TIP:  Their omelets are served with bottomless toast and potatoes. Yup!!",y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ,4,6,4,alawbxDJD4B-ox8aHIDeXg

The inside of the restaurant has the same character as other locations with an alien theme. The feel is like a local diner with writing from customers all over the walls.

I ordered the Holy Crab Omelet and the omelet was the highlight of the meal. The eggs were light and fluffy and the omelet was full of crab and cheese. The flavors were great. Spudz on the side were crispy and pretty good. I tried all the sauces offered on the side including cheese, mushroom, and tomato pesto. I strongly disliked every one of these and would pass on the sauces next time. My husband ordered the Trippy Thomas omelet and loved it. The waitress was happy to substitute his toast for tortillas. He added a side of Biscuits & Gravy which fell flat. It reminded me of the biscuits and gravy provided in a complimentary breakfast at a chain hotel. This was really bad. The biscuit was hard, dry, and flavorless. The gravy wasn't much better.

The service was friendly, but not overly attentive. At arrival the hostess was just pointing customers to tables instead of walking them to the table. My husband's food arrived five minutes before mine and another five for my toast after my entrée arrived instead of all of the food arriving together. Our waitress was accommodating in offering to let me try all three sauces and substituting tortillas for my husband.

Overall, the food and service were okay. There are many other outstanding breakfast options in the area so I'm not sure I can say we'll be back.",3nIuSCZk5f_2WWYMLN7h3w,4,2,3,S4wzfQv669qS278WnebK8A

The Atmosphere here is pretty awesome, it has a pretty chilled vibe. The writing on wa says it all. The Aliens welcoming you in, had my little one ecstatic.
This place is definitely welcoming to all ages. They even have a few basket of toys for the kids to play with, which totally make sense- kids can get so bored fast just like they get full. So that option of extra entertainment, is a plus for parents who don't have to rush eating once their little one gets bored.
The menu option definitely appeals to adults and children- it literally has something for everyone, so dining here makes total sense when your looking for a place to go with the family.
The menu selection was pretty good, I was having a hard time deciding on one dish, but I went with the breakfast burrito and surely enjoyed it, my hubby got an omelette with chorizo, and the portion size was pretty good. My kiddo ordered his French Toast combo and cleaned his plate clean. It got a picky eater two thumbs up.
First time here? No problem the waitress will take care of you from recommending dishes, to signing up for a rewards program. Which has some pretty awesome perks!

The food presentation was nice. There was also a good amount. It wasn't over the top delicious but pretty decent. 

The service is where I had some issues with. I forgot the servers name but she was blonde and seemed new. I asked for water and finally got it after I had to re-ask 3 times. I checked in on yelp and wanted to use the 50% off alcoholic drinks and even though it says that I need to order an entree (which I did) to get the discount she told me I needed to order 2 drinks if I wanted the discount. So I ordered two drinks so I could get the discount. 

The time it took to get my food was not acceptable. We sat for almost 1 hour to get our food. The food was fresh and hot when we received it but I don't want to wait an hour to get it. 

The checkout..... When we were ready to leave our server gave us our check. I looked to see if we received our discount and it was incorrect. She charged us for extra drinks and gave us the wrong discount. I helped her figure out what was wrong and it took 2 more attempts to show her it was still wrong. There was a difference of $20 from the discount and the wrong items added. 

When I asked if it's always this busy on Fridays she said ""Monday's and Tuesdays and slow"". That's great if i was asking about Monday or Tuesday but I was asking about Friday. 

This staff needs to be trained more and should keep a notepad with them. I shouldnt need to ask for something 3 times in a row to finally get it. I'm always willing to give a place a second chance but that would only be if I was offered a discount.

4775003,2017-04-08,1,XvOzizKafffkMuk-tIdNcQ,"I treated my mom to breakfast for her birthday the other day. Someone had mentioned this place to us, and since we wanted to try something new, we checked it out. Located in the same parking lot as the Colonnade, next to Body Heat, and the salon, this place is tucked in the corner, but is a hidden gem. 

We didn't quite know where the entrance was, but luckily out first guess was the tight guess as if you are going to Vegan Bites, but you just make a little turn to the left. When we walked in the place is cute. Bright colored walls with hand written messages from people who ate there before. The lady told us we can sit where we would like, and we sat next the window and no chair matched the other. Look up and you will see popular Vegas faces and pictures on the ceiling tiles. 

When we sat down to take a look at the menu I couldn't help but see how loud it was. So brightly colored with little blurbs here and there. As I was browsing through the menu, everything looked to have eggs in it, and I'm not a huge egg person. But as I searched on I saw and I ordered the Southwestern Spudz - potatoes, black beans, i substituted mushrooms for red bell pepper, tofu (ordered on the side since I'm picky about it), with salsa. The portion was so big! It was like a few people could eat it. I poured a little salsa and dug in and it was just delicious. Everything was paired nicely and didnt seem like there was too much of one thing. I put a little tofu, which was also off the fire and it added a nice crunch to it. I love potatoes and this was just so good. I had to stop myself and ended up taking the rest home. My mom ordered eggs with french toast and turkey sausage bacon.  She really enjoyed hers and said the french toast was not too soggy but just right. 

The ladies serving were very nice and helpful. They were very knowledgeable about the menu and what they offered.

4919131,2018-04-29,0,XvOzizKafffkMuk-tIdNcQ,"Love Squeeze In! Such a hidden gem, nestled in the back corner of this plaza. 
The service is always prompt and friendly i have never had a bad experience. 

I have tried the Spanish Flay omelette, since I'm a fan of Bobby Flay as soon as I seen this on the menu I had to give it a try. You can't go wrong with the crispy flavorful potatoes and fluffy eggs! I split this dish with a friend and it fed us both very well. The portions here are very large. 
On another visit I tried the Jack Johnson, walnut banana pancakes (short stack:2) and let me just tell you I do not like Pancakes and I do not like Bananas... why I decided to order these pancakes I have no idea but I am forever grateful, I now dream of these pancakes. They are that delicious. Even the short stack is way too much food for me so the second visit I was able to order a single pancake and found that much easier to eat. Since I don't tend to take pancakes to go.. And they don't hold up too well reheated once you have syrup and butter on them.. let me add another thing! This pancake is topped with warm butter and honey. Truly dreamy! It's like banana nut bread in a pancake, yum! 
I've also tried the Classic Eggs Benedict, served alongside those delicious crispy potatoes is another delicious staple. And their hollandaise sauce is fabulous, it makes the dish.
Another favorite at Squeeze In would be their mimosa with guava juice, it's a must try! And they have great deals if you order two at the same time it's $10.99 for both I believe. They are not stingy with the champagne, they fill their glasses to the top. My kinda place! 
I highly suggest signing up for their Squeeze In card. They have weekly specials that are always a great deal. 
Can't wait to get back to Squeeze In for another dreamy Banana Pancake and guava Mimosa... maybe one of these days I'll order something else on the menu... which will probably be out of this world delicious like everything else.",SCMkXA12XZfnntPlBlu3aw,0,1,5,NBLvbj-8hozrsvbCFZ6GWg

The first thing that caught my eye was the Spanish Flay, the picture looked really good, it had everything that I liked in an omelet. I wish I had dined in but I couldn't so I chose to get it to go. 

The staff was really friendly and accommodating, so I have no problem with them. My problem was the food it tasted terrible and for $15 I deserved better. The omelet was big but it wasn't stuffed with adequate fillings, and it lacked seasoning. Same goes for the potatoes, just tasted bland. What's worse was that I was expecting was cheese sauce on the potatoes and instead I got cheese whiz. That killed it for me.

Now featuring two locations in Southern Nevada, the concept out of Truckee California opening its first in July 2016 near the junction of Fort Apache and Tropicana, it was with morning business nearby that a stop was made at Squeeze-In on South Eastern Avenue near Truffles n' Bacon Café, the restaurant known for the ""Best Omelettes on the Planet"" and a televised triumph over Bobby Flay showing consistency in the branding, but not in the overall customer experience.

Tucked into the back corner of a shopping plaza next to a Vegan Café, the shopping center jumping that morning thanks to a Tent Sale from a nearby Home Goods vendor, it was just past eight in the morning that two aliens were passed en route to the door, a smiling hostess greeting patrons and offering seating amidst a room decorated in kitsch and guest comments written in Sharpie on the wall.

Not the sort of restaurant going all-in on the Artisan idea, but rather the sort of place with a colorful menu built on classic diner food updated with some twists, it was with particular items plus a $10 ""Egghead Club"" discount voucher that a seat was taken along the back window, the hostess inexplicably placing a loud family with a father who smelled like a freshly sparked joint directly behind me only a minute later despite plenty of room to spare.

Already having made decisions, a cup of Coffee poured and refilled only after verbal requests throughout the morning, it was shortly after seating that a three-part order was placed to the response of ""you must be hungry,"" the music playing overhead ranging from Pop to Classic Rock at a level that never grew too loud with Free Wi-Fi providing available to those who arrive during longer wait times, though there was barely time to log-in before Breakfast plates began arriving.

Taking the valued step of offering Pure Maple Syrup at a supplementary charge, though this uncommon local practice had already caused some to be brought from home, it was with all three dishes deserved simultaneously that photos were snapped and items dressed to taste, the Chocolate covered Bacon arriving ice-cold with a squeeze of Whipped Cream and Berries that were added to the Short-Stack, the flavor of the Pork mostly lost amidst the coating, and mostly detectable in the lightly saline finish.

Focusing next on the Pancakes, the body not quite as fluffy as the Jack Johnson inspired version tasted in August, it bears mention that for ninety-nine cents the amount of Blueberries present in the Batter was greater than one might expect even though the cup of Butter was quite small, the portion size of a dish entitled Zweifel far more substantial as three whole Eggs are folded around an admixture of softened Fruit, Honey and a creamy Peanut Butter with the addition of at least two chopped slices of Bacon providing a textural variance that was actually quite pleasant, the eggs admittedly lost in the background and almost acting as a 'wrap' in this instance while the Spuds were crisp and not oily, though something besides High Fructose Corn Syrup-laden Smucker's would have been nice to have for the toasted English Muffin.

***  Lacking the friendly and efficient customer service of the location on the West Side, but still providing a decent breakfast at a fair price, Squeeze-In on Easterm provides yet another alternative to the Egg & I's, Cracked Egg and Baby Cakes of Sin City with a focus on Omelettes that come in an almost infinite array of possibilities.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,13,8,3,CCVEI0l3EbT9bNUrvs3TDA

Glad to say, it did not dissapoint!
Hubby had one of the Eggs Benedict dishes, he loved it. Specially the potatoes which he said were hot, crispy on the outside soft on the inside and seasoned just right. Unfortunately i have strict dietary restrictions, so usually i am not too excited about going out to eat anymore. Its not only food options, but ingredients, seasoning, and your regular worries like fat, carb, salt and protein content. As well as sizes offered,  option to order from child menus or being able to swap sides for healthier options.
So glad to report that these guys in both occasions have been extremely patient, accommodating and even made suggestions.
Considering this, obviously i couldnt order one of their delicious popular omelets or the wonderful banana nut pankacakes (which my husband had ordered before) but i dont feel like i missed out on anything with my dish.
I ordered the Shi's Super Scramble which is made with broccoli, zucchini, spinach, red peppers, egg whites and turkey sausage (which is an add-on but totally worth it if you need to add extra protein to your dish), and a fresh fruit cup on the side.
The vegetables were cooked just right with that needed bit of crunch. The egg-veggie-turkey portions were perfectly balanced and i couldnt even tell i was having egg whites since the dish was still hearty, tasty and extremely fullfilling. I ended up having left overs which were enough for my dinner that same night and breakfast the next day. Our server was outgoing, courteous and kept checking on us during our meal. 
The restaurant has unique decor, which makes it a casual yet fun, comfortable and ""familiar"" feeling. Great for bff get-togethers, big family breakfasts, date with your significant other,  or just eating solo in an environment were you can still feel comfortable and welcomed.",h6MRkc8h4_anyLtYGbL0bg,0,0,5,1N2vUrBQM2sfZWGhZhPYoQ

5828119,2017-08-13,0,XvOzizKafffkMuk-tIdNcQ,"Really disappointed with our trip to Squeeze in. My fiancé and I shared ""The Maggie"" and the ""Big Bad Johnson"". I watched our food sit up in the window for a while before anyone grabbed it to bring it over. Inevitably, the stuffed French toast (the Maggie) was terribly cold and it ruined the overall taste of the dish. The fruit on the french toast plate looked bad, the strawberries over-ripe and the bananas under-ripe. The ""Big Bad Johnson"" was missing sausage, there was absolutely no sausage at all in the omelette which again, ruined the overall taste of the dish. The sourdough toast was served soggy and not toasted at all and the spuds were the only item worth eating out of everything we ordered. My glass of grapefruit juice with ice smelled and like musty tap water and we were very disappointed. Though it was 11am I did not expect the quality of our breakfast to be so sub-par. Would rather go somewhere where the food is always hot and served correctly like Egg Works!",9KedzFFaQSK06pl25KcjhQ,3,0,2,vNQXAK8Jv8Zt_wrqsVk0Ag

Overall, it was a pleasant but not a memorable meal.
A bit pricey......
Love the decor

I had never loved pancakes but once I tried the banana walnut pancakes from Squeeze In I can't get enough!.. the syrup is not overly sweet and slightly salty. And just soo delicious! They have unfortunately created a new craving for me!.. I also tried the club sandwich.. it was ok but a little dry for my taste. I will definitely be coming here time and time again!",0Om_eedrbXC2Q4ndjlq5SQ,0,0,5,B4UDfYofyIq2L0JUaqX25w

Yelp check-in's get you 50% off alcohol, so why not?
Peach Bellini - pretty good taste but definitely strong for me.

I got the french toast with strawberries and my friend got a tortilla wrapped turkey with vegetables thing and a side of potatoes. It was just alright. Nothing stood out like o-m-g amazing, but it is your average type of breakfast. 

Service was great though! I'll definitely be back in the future to try out new things now that I've discovered this cute little shop.",wxQCLMnuVYbdtmQCc2ryZg,6,4,3,owADUW87cs3NwKXtjAKURg

Both with the food and the service. When it's good it's great but we have slowed down our visits significantly because of the risk involved with getting our day off to a bad start.",U8u1jGMpQiFMl5o_ZhOm_g,0,0,4,o5teyzgqshawCeojwypFmg
