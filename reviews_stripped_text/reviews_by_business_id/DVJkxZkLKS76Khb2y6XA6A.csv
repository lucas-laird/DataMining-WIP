Salad was alright, but skimpy on the dressing. Not sure what they were using as the ""lite"" dressing we think it hurt our bellies afterwards. For the price I would have hoped that at least the lettuce was organic, but I don't think it was. The atmosphere was not what I expected - and the EDM music was way too loud. I'm all about eating healthy, but this place was more annoying than anything else.

I prefer yogurt, so I got a strawberry-blueberry smoothie. For a 24 oz size it was almost $8, which is high for what I got: fruit, yogurt, and ice. In fact, the smoothie is quite bland, not much fruit taste. It mostly tastes like ice and yogurt. I could make about as good (or better) at home. 

Their effort was definitely more for the weight-lifting and fitness crowd. Most of the food menu was ""jacked with protein."" It took a long time to get service because you order at the counter and everyone in front of me was customizing their orders. I literally had time to go to the bathroom and get back in line without it moving. (Also, there was a mirror above the toilet in the women's bathroom???) They really need to move to an order from tables method if customization is such a big thing. 

The menu did have some unique items like bison, quinoa, and acai. Can't say if the food was good. My smoothie is subpar and the wait in line was way too long.",4r-NBwZBp1qdNstgw4tHvA,1,0,3,k9R6bok4uX6soHuZG2JRQw

Saw a post from a friend about the place so we were excited to try it.  First issue was with the staff with a bad attitude/bad service.  She didn't even say hello and seemed annoyed like she didn't want to be working.  Second issue was with the staff completely forgeting our order.  And it wasn't even busy.  We had to ask the cook (rude staff person was no help).  He did his best to rush the order.   Finally issue was that they completely forgot the juice that we ordered.  We almost had to get out our receipt to prove we ordered a juice, which was disappointing.    

It was $30 for two people and one juice, which is a little high for ok food and bad service.  Definitely a bad experience.

WE were really enjoying our time until we were ready to leave.  At this time, I watched as one of the employees climbed onto the food prep counter to grab a container of protein powder that was above her reach.  She stood on the food prep counter with her shoes on...yuck.  Would not have been that big of a deal...but she didn't disinfect the counter or even wipe it off before she started using the exact same surface to prepare a smoothie for the next customer.  She put fresh fruit and vegetables on the counter in the exact spot she was just standing.  She saw me watching her and didn't seem to think it was a big deal.  

I would assume this would violate a dozen or so health codes.  The bottom of shoes are filled with all kinds of disgusting things and belong no where near food prep.  After seeing this, I won't be back.  I don't think I can trust the cleanliness of the establishment.

I love the whole concept that this place has. A healthy lifestyle is never out of style, and I enjoy their twist on it. The entrees make people realize that you don't have to eat a boring ole salad to eat healthy. Their menu consists of so many options that I can't wait until I go back to try more. They use healthier alternatives to certain foods such as egg whites, whey protein, quinoa, and stevia. I had the ""Sexy Bitch Bowl."" I loved the combination of flavors that this bowl had, which I would've never thought to combined. 

As for the service, it took someone a while to greet us and to let us know that they had a smaller more condensed menu. We were so overwhelmed by the chalkboards and kept having to walk back and forth around the counter, trying to look at everything. But the workers were very kind nonetheless.

It is located in the plaza off of Eastern and Richmar near Grimaldis.The restaurants is spacious with a modern flair to it. It had abundant seating between the sleek tables and comfy couches. The menu had standards items, or you could build your own masterpiece of healthy deliciousness. They serve breakfast, burgers, salads, bowls, juices and smoothies. I opted for the Greek Bowl: ground up turkey burger, roasted tomato, black olives, feta cheese, cucumber, and red onion. These items come on top of your choice of either brown rice or quinoa; I went with quinoa. I tossed some sriracha in there, because I am an addict and I admit it. It tasted phenomenal and the portion size was enough for two meals. The price was a bit steep - $9.99 plus tax for the bowl. The Yelp check in was 10% off, but I am not sure if they still have that promotion. It is definitely a great option for when you are trying to eat well, but not skimp on the flavor.

Really not often you walk into health conscious restaurant see lounge area that can sit down got just about every fitness magazine laid out for reading pleasure (from muscle & fitness, just about every one can think of) but yet still have bar stools and tables relax have meal. One more thought with different. If ever lost in the world of fitness or IFBB need too know who current just walk into the bathrooms. Think kind of weird but too each his own. 

Now what really matters the food. It was my first time so really had no idea direction too go. It decent size menu so had just about every healthy option can think of. I like  the way the menu is structured from bowls, salads, burgers, and drinks. Each list typical healthy options comes too if want switch around protein, carb, add, or build your own healthy creation. I stuck with standard since was my first time. I went with the Southwest Bowl and Berry Jubilee for my drink. The Southwest Bowl was AAAwesome! I went with whole wheat pasta for my carb choice between brown rice, quinoa, or whole wheat pasta. I loved the fact that it was HEARTY healthy bowl. I always associate healthy with bare minimum of portion. At Protein House not cheating you out of your protein/carb! The top sirloin was cooked too my exact temp and combine the avacado, roasted tomatoe, roasted red pepper, cheese, and black bean salsa. Nice light sauce neither oily, greasy, and just light/refreshing pasta bowl. I could eat healthy everyday. It between pricey and cheap so not sure if could eat Protein House style healthy everyday. But without doubt you get the most bang for your buck hands down compare too other health restaurants. Look forward too trying more of the menu.

The service was fabulous. One that make point not too go at the last second. Really wanted too try Protein House. 30 minutes is broader line. The whole staff never rushed us although my guilty conscious made me eat faster...

I ordered the PH Pancakes and my hubby ordered the Bison Burger wrapped in lettuce.  The pancakes were a nice multigrain, whey protein and it seems like a touch of cinnamon.  I have to say they were awesome.  My six egg whites were delivered on the side and were good as well.  I mean, you can't mess up egg whites.  My hubby was disappointed in the Bison burger as he felt it was rather bland, nor real seasoning at all.  

Now, the reason I gave them 3 stars was all about the service. Service here is horrible.  We ordered our food and it took 45 mins for it to all be completed.  There were two other couples that ordered ahead of us and were already seated when we walked in the door to order.  Several other groups of people were served before we were including the two couples already seated.  I went up to ask if our order was misplaced.  My hubbies burger had been sitting on the counter for 10 mins and they didn't call us as they were still making my order of pancakes.  
One of the other couples there said they had the same problem. 

Now the place itself is a great industrial design.  But they have the music blaring so loud that  you literally have to be sitting next to the kitchen to hear when your name is called for your food. 

If you are into healthy food, I have to agree they are good but if you can, call ahead for pick up because the wait is just not fun. And be prepared to pay a little higher for your food than other places.",TaCOXUciTuTDbyMGZfWZ0Q,6,0,3,RWc3vH5dRsQIR31NodTEsA

Before I go on with my review, I will say my other two friends who ordered different dishes enjoyed their food. My other friend and I ordered salads (low carb day, ugh) with the seared ahi on top. I got a side of the sweet potato sticks. The seared ahi was so not fresh, it was kinda gross. I was a little nervous to eat it but I was starving so ate it anyway. It looked like frozen ahi that was thawed and it tasted really fishy. I was not a fan. The sweet potatoes were so undercooked, they may as well have just served them to me raw. I'm not sure if I'll come here again, if I do I definitely will not be ordering the seared ahi salad again. Great idea for a restaurant though.

We got there Saturday morning and it was empty. We looked at the menu for about 5 minutes and there were a couple of girls at the registrar that didn't bother to ask if we had any questions despite our confused looks. I decided to play it safe with the breakfast burrito and some much needed coffee after a 5am flight. They use illy coffee which is one of my favorite coffees and one of the best coffees out there. The cookies and cream coffee with almond milk was amazing.

Something interesting that happened was that once I placed my order I received a number, however no one delivered my food. I had the cook loudly yelling my number several times like if I was in a meat market. Who by the way was not friendly at all and looked like he hated his life the whole time.

The breakfast burrito was bland and had to soak it in Cholula sauce to make it taste better. Along with my burrito on the side there were some pieces of fruit (pinneaple, melon, and something else) the fruit looked and tasted old, you could tell that it was cut at least 1 or 2 days ago.

Before leaving I TRIED buying one of their tank tops however it's a mess and they are all scattered in no order next to the registrar. After looking for about 6 minutes and seeing that the girl at the registrar was not going to offer any help I asked her if they had some more in the back with my specific size. She replied with ""that's all we have"" and then I asked when were they receiving more since I was going to be in Vegas for the weekend and was willing to drive back to the restaurant to get the shirt. She replied with ""I don't know when we are getting more, maybe next month or 2 months."" I decided to not buy anything and left the restaurant.

To say the least I was disappointed with my experience, however I will give them another chance and check them out next time I'm in Vegas, hopefully their customer service and food gets better.",ZumY-BxGZSvpZiJw1FtYQg,6,1,2,UdXgeyOY06FClEiHk82_rg

If I could give this place **more than 5 stars***, I would~

Service-wise, I got a pretty good description of the food from a few different servers/staff.  In fact, the first time I was ordering their Peanut Butter Dream (protein shake) and asked for 3 extra scoops, the huge guy behind the counter (who I assume is also the owner) said ""no you don't want that because each scoop is 25 grams of protein, so that plus the peanut butter and the egg white...""  I was totally stoked when he said that because most places like Jamba Juice and such give you a measly 10 grams of protein per scoop, which is total weaksauce!  Protein House gives you a whopping 25 grams of whey protein per scoop as well as different flavors!  EXCELLENT~

So over the course of a 7 day climbing trip, I ate here 5 days, mostly for dinner.  Tried the PH Hash, a DOUBLE Bison burger, their Quinoa Bowl, all of which were amazing, tasty, and most importantly for me, LOADED with protein!

Bodybuilding must be big in Vegas because the walls were plastered with signed autographs of some seriously hot IFBB Figure Competitors like Larissa Reis (actually there was A LOT of Larissa Reis all over the wall, and understandably so.  She's hot~).

My only negative comment is that there isn't one of these in California!!! I guarantee people in Newport Beach would pay more than what they charge in Henderson for this kind of quality and type of food!

Rock Climbing is like ALL DAY strength training/power lifting for your back/biceps/forearms.  Protein House gives me exactly what I need to recover from a long day of hard bouldering and class 3/class 4 hiking. I HIGHLY recommend this place if you want a great tasting, generously portioned, high protein meal for a reasonable price.


---Overall---

Service: A, stellar

Atmosphere: A+, Larissa Reis...'nuff said.",-kkq4fbhtnbnYAPpxpnvHg,3,1,5,UWzIWG0qRlgfY66CK4MKwg

I stated that was fine and I just wanted a cup of coffee. After much hesitation and a bit of attitude she made a cup. Upon arriving back at the hospital with our food and the coffee...
The coffee was not Illy!!!! It was bitter and acidic, nothing like Illy brand. The bowl we ordered was so spicy it was almost too spicy to eat and I grew up with spicy. So I have no idea what they did to this bowl.

I sipped and wanted to spit it out. It tasted spoiled! I juice at home frequently with a Vita Mix and now a Ninja. I know these flavor profiles very well and like them a lot when they are made fresh. I couldn't believe my taste-buds. How could fresh juice taste spoiled? I did something I rarely do. I went back to complain. The lady smiled and offered me another type. I tried the Detox, substituted cucumbers for celery. Although this one didn't have the Blah factor of the first one, I threw it out anyways because it tasted old. 

When she was preparing my second juice the mystery of spoiled juice was revealed. This IS NOT FRESH JUICE.

The cashier has little to no personality, and usually makes me feel like I'm burdening them in having them do their job. And perhaps this is just me, but I figure a restaurant that is solely focused on being health conscious would be more accommodating to special requests.

I grabbed an early dinner here and walked in already knowing full-on what I wanted. I ordered a PH Chopped salad with the dressing and cheese on the side, to-go. I had to repeat exactly what I wanted 3 times as the cashier was disinterested, hardly looked up at me, and couldn't crack a smile if her life depended on it. Eventually she repeated back to me exactly what I wanted, asked me what temperature for the steak (I ordered medium-rare), and then offered me a cup for water while I wait which was a nice touch.

20 something minutes later, they are finally calling my name with my to-go order, which they shouted 3 times as apparently I am not fast enough moving from the table to their counter as they would've liked. Hey, I waited 20 minutes for this bad-boy, give me and my sore legs a chance to react, would ya?

While walking out, I did a quick check in the bag, noticed the dressing nicely packed on its own, and no utensils. Scanning the front for any plasticware, I saw none. I figured I could hold off until I'm at a friend's before eating, so I didn't sweat it. 

Finally getting down to eat my meal, I took one bite and realized they hadn't packaged the cheese on the side at all. It was crumbled and viciously mixed in with the rest of the salad. Now to be honest with you, I probably should have told them to hold off on the cheese altogether. It's not that I don't like blue cheese (I love it), but it's just not on the menu for me right now. You'd think a restaurant catered to dieters would be more careful...

The steak was cooked to medium, which was actually a pleasant surprise as last time I ordered medium-rare they decided to obliterate the crap out of it until it was a nice, grey, chewy mess. But maybe next time if they don't overcook it, I won't have to wait 25 minutes for a salad. I could have gone to Cafe Zupas and gotten the same salad, done correctly, and for a fraction of the cost.

With it being the anniversary of Protein House, we figured that it was about time. As you enter the establishment, you can tell that its not kept up very well. The cashiers was kind of nice, but I couldn't tell since she never smiled. There was one petit girl who was busing all the tables, and she was the reason I left the tips, since she was having to tend to all this solo. Ordered the Muscle Builder, and BBQ turkey Burger, with mashed sweet potatoes and sweet potato pieces... It might be healthy, but you can definitely be more creative in making food taste better. I never went back for the water, because that dispenser was filthy. I'm not talking about just a little splash back, but hard water stains, and other colored spots. Mind you, this only dispenses water and ice, so there's no explanation for the other stains. The water in the catch can was overflowing, with things in it. I never went for water, so that I could keep my meal down. The 2nd star was for the 10% check-in offer, but I gave that money back in tips. I might've just not tipped at all, if I knew you had to get your own food at the serving station. 

On a side note... The clientele and some staff must've been on a low carb week or something. The vibe in that place when stepping in, eating, and exiting had a very strong air of ""douchiness"".

I came around brunch time on a weekday.  Patrons consisted of alotta gym folk and lunch break goers, but it wasn't crazy busy so it was a good place for me to get some work done (free wifi, plus a couple of outlets for electronics--yay!).  

I really like their bowls.  Fresh in quality and flavor.  I made my own bowl which consisted of steak, red onions, tomatoes, mushroom, cilantro, and feta over quinoa with a side of cilantro-lime vinaigrette.  It came out to about $14--not bad considering the quality of the food.  I also tried the lolo bowl (~$8), which was chocolate/peanut butter whey concoction, topped with granola, honey, strawberries, and bananas.  The foods really filling, and I had leftovers for another meal.  

Service wasn't bad.  They serve things up on real plates and clean up after you when you leave.  The place is really well-kept and clean--including the bathrooms.  The back walls and bathroom are decorated with a bunch of pictures of fitness folk--bulging muscles and all--not my cup of tea, but I don't mind it.  They also have a huge TV for patrons to catch the latest sports highlights.

Overall, a good healthy option to try.",t2nPIKI2iy8VG_cfFD0Vmg,2,2,4,9eN3X6ngjnp1lpicVppeQg

i finally went to this place after hearing so many of my gym friends talk about it! upon walking in, everything is nice and sleek, clean and full of gym style music! some of the menu is on the wall and there is paper menu too! my friend got a protein bowl and i got a teriyaki protein chicken burger sans the bun and i must say, it was delicious! the chicken was nice and juicy, the pineapple was just sweet enough and the amount of teriyaki sauce on the burger was just right!

i loved that they have the macros of the meal on the side and you can add either veggies or sweet potatoes to your meal as well. they have a vast array of smoothies as well, so if you're on the run, you can grab a pretty large sized protein shake to go! 

they have a nice breakfast menu as well that included eggs, waffles and scrambles that look good, so next time i get out of the gym early, this is going to be a pit stop before home! all in all, this is an extremely good place for health conscious people or people who are trying to get fit!",rqb5abV146wcU-Z7JxfEIQ,7,6,4,oBWA1dlCqapAUcefc_n_8w

I came in late one evening and ordered a veggie and rice bowl. The restaurant was not busy and yet it was a mess. Where I stood to order my food you can see the kitchen area and there was food every where on the floor. If it were busy, it would be understandable. 

After ordering, I sat down to wait for my order to get made and realized that one table was customers and another was employees and friends of theirs. The dining area had boxes, papers and junk all over the place. The floor was dirty and so were most of the tables. This annoyed me because it seemed they were almost over staffed and yet it was a huge mess in the place. They did chose to make the restaurant mostly white so I am sure this is why the mess stands out so much. 

They had music playing and it was that music you would hear in a 'pump you up' cycling class. It was way too loud! I asked for a to go box and felt like we need to shout to hear each other. Too much. Who wants to eat with harsh base beats pulsing in their ears? That can not be healthy. 

I ordered the veggie bowl with brown rice. It was decent but, I would not go out of my way to come back here. I do not remember if it seemed over priced or anything but the experience as a whole was 'meh'.

After this places was hyped up to me and my bodybuilder by another close gym buddy, we came here to eat after the Olympia Expo.  The concept for this place is great and I fully understand the clientele they are marketing to.  So here is the break down:

The lack of communication between back and front of house is out of this world.  You're out of product and you don't let anyone know?   In fact you let customers order and only inform them once they send food back.  If you ask for anything to be different on your entree, you will not receive it, or you will receive what they want you to have.  

Attention to tickets and menu items was a miss for our group as well.  Main ingredients missing for 2 of our 4 entrees, extras not received upon delivery of our food.

Customer service was strange as well.  The Co-owner was friendly when he took our orders and was happy to add additional items to my bowl and other adjustments to 2 other orders. I saw the other owner Jill running around and doing an excellent job. The two of them get an A+.  However the thick girl with the hipster glasses doesn't have a clue what she is doing other than bringing food to a table.  When confronted about the incorrect orders the response was ""um...so....um ok well I guess, what do you need?  let me see if we can do that""  this alone blew my mind.  I work in the hospitality industry and server when I have to, this is never a response you should give a customer.  Maybe more training is needed with line staff and servers.....it can only help.

The food was ok otherwise.  I'm not use to food that is so under seasoned.  A little cumin or pepper never hurt anyone.  I get the salt and holding water aspect so salt isn't a big deal.

I would like to give this place another try though.  Everyone has an off night.

This is literally a heavy weightlifter's wet dream, from the decor, the gym thumping techno music and the extensive protein packed menu. I was expecting something different when I walked in, but was pleasantly surprised to see clean white lines and sleek look of the room. 

The menu sort resembles an Instagram meal plan page and a weight trainer's cookbook, just the basic needs.

I went with the Thai Monster Bowl; chicken, lean top sirloin, broccoli, asparagus, green onions and a Thai peanut sauce on top.

If I was to guess I would also assume these salads were not made fresh and prepackaged, as the lettuce was wilting and soft, had some brown edges and asparagus was soggy? 

Hard to mess up a salad but somehow they managed it. Felt slighted for the amount spent. Next time I want a good salad I will go to Cafe RIO next door and save $$$. 

Going to wait some time and give PH some time to make improvements to their menu and operations before I return. It's a great concept, just need to step up quality and adjust prices slightly to better reflect the area. Have seen way too many places come and go in that immediate area. Hope they can make it!",yuoaisepxm6QaBKiBxz6AA,8,2,2,dhnBP8TlWaJv1pUwn0bSGg

For a place that is run by a bodybuilder I thought there would be nutritional information available for each dish. We ordered Larissa's Thai monster bowl and the signature teriyaki bowl.

Thai monster bowl- chicken was slightly raw; lacked seasoning; peanut butter lovers will like the spicy peanut sauce

Teriyaki bowl- teriyaki sauce? The teriyaki sauce here is orange in color and if I was blind folded I never would have guessed it was teriyaki sauce 

I forgot to use the 10% check in deal so Larissa gave me a chocolate protein brownie instead. I wanted to try the chocolate brownie in the beginning but for $4 and the size I didn't see the value. The brownie ended up being the best thing I tasted here. It was very moist but I was hoping to know the nutrition facts.

Muscle boy breakfast = straight and forward everything was cooked my liking and delicious

thai monster w/ brown rice = delicious and highly curious on to whats in their peanut sauce marinade

steak breakfast burrito = best thing ever (keep in mind ive been on a chicken rice diet for the past few weeks so red meat was like crack at this moment) it was like the perfect helping of red meat and egg whites. 

gf had the salmon salad at that too was crazy flavorful and delicious.

we also tried a peanut butter protein smoothie = OH GOD (bigseanvoice) i seriously need to figure out how to make that thing.

While we were waiting the manager noticed our anxiousness and decided to have us try out some samples of a new smoothie they were working on.

I've had their Teriyaki Bowl with quinoa and their Muscle Burger as a lettuce wrap. It actually looks like they've changed their menu since I've last been here... they don't have juices anymore but I've had a juice that was called like the Hang Over Cure or something... and some other juice that tasted a bit better than whatever was in the hang over one.

The Teriyaki bowl was okay. The salmon was a bit dry. The bowl could have used more sauce/flavor. I was really hungry when I was eating it and rushing over to a photo shoot though, so I wasn't exactly sitting and enjoying the meal, moreso shoveling it into my mouth.

The muscle burger as a lettuce wrap was impossible to eat as a lettuce wrap. I had to take my knife and fork to it. And there definitely wasn't enough lettuce or onions. Really just a ton of meat and cheese. And it definitely wasn't cooked medium. I only got this because the owner, at least I'm assuming the owner, recommended it. I barely put a dent into this monster when my stomach decided it wanted nothing more to do with it. I knew I should have asked for it without the cheddar cheese, but I didn't, and I literally couldn't function for the rest of the day. I'm assuming the cheese and resulting grease was the culprit as I've been on a really clean diet for a couple months already.  I took the rest home where I discarded the cheese. The meat ended up tasting pretty bland. The sweet potatoes were good though.

I haven't been a fan of the customer service. The girls at the counter always seem aloof, looking like the girls who get dolled up to go to the gym and act like they're better than you. The other workers who look like body builders just seem to keep to themselves.

I chose Green Monster and Earl chose the Berry Blast Smoothie.  The ingredients used to make green monster includes spinach, coconut water, honey dew, pineapple, lime, ginger, cucumber, and kale.  Tasted like kale and spinach juice though.  There was no hint of sweetness from the fruits.

Earl's berry blast smoothie, which we could only taste whey protein.  Overall, glad we tried it, so we know to get something different next time.  I like to try a place thrice before writing it off, therefore, Meh for now.",5wT0vDycEzgq95yVCZ60Aw,7,2,2,jefPYSj0Q1P5VAkFRsv9_A

You HAVE to try their peanut butter balls with one of their signature coffees.  This is the cure for every social malady that exists in this universe.

The item on their menu we liked most was the real fruit smoothies. It didnt seem like it had any added sugars or even those fake sugars like turbinado or aspartame.

Really liked the fact that you cant even choose to drink a soda because they don't have any.

Pricing will seem a bit high but I think its mostly spot on with how expensive organics and grass fed beef stuff is.

Owner seems really nice.

I have one complaint and its really a small one. When we were there they were running one of those little vacuums that is only a little noisy. I don't know if the owner is OCD but a vacuum while eating is just an itty bitty complaint. The place is really spotless.

When I pickup a takeout order I always look in each box to make sure everything is right, I failed to do so this time!  I took a quick peek at a few boxes, seemed to be right but I was wrong!!!
When I got back to the office we opened our boxes and two out of four were wrong.  The two that were wrong were mixed up.  I drove back, they remade it but did not seem concerned about the quality of their services.

Service was OK, as the person who took our order didn't know the nutritional value of the menu items, which you would expect in a ""body builders"" paradise. The menu had a lot of choices, with some specific GF options, however, anyone who is Gluten Free knows that any meal can be combined to make it GF. What about wheat and soy free?  What about other allergies?  They are not addressed at all.  Also, if you're seated, they call your number or name from behind the counter, rather than bringing you your order.  I don't need to workout and get my meal, if I'm sitting sipping tea with friends/colleagues and picking up our meals in plastic bowls with plastic utensils just added to our disappointment, and without trays, took a few trips to the counter, which took time away from a nice lunch. Add a tacky ""tip cup"" at the register, made the obligation uncomfortable as there was no ""service"", as after the meal, we had to return our bowls to the counter. 

The restaurant was clean, with a nice vibe, contemporary, but a little over the top with the owner overly self promoting with her photos everywhere and we  were tired of looking up at the walls.  Then it continued all the way into the bathroom. Exhausting and overdone.

Being a healthy restaurant must extend beyond the marketing of a business; the ingredients used in your dishes must also be healthy.

Located off Eastern Avenue near LVAC and Gold's Gym, Protein House is another restaurant that offers healthy eats with a ton of protein. But to me, PH is not just another healthy meal stop. PH offers smoothies, breakfast, burgers, bowls, and salads. To order, you can either go straight to the counter and place your order off their menu. Or, you can take their order checklist, select your meal, and then hand it to the counter.  You also have the option to build your own burger, salad, and bowl.  Because this was my first visit, I decided on their biggest and baddest burger, their Muscle Builder Burger. This burger is 12 oz of ground Bison, onions, cheese, and Canadian bacon all served in a whole wheat bun. I had this medium well and swear that this is one of the best bison burgers I have ever had.  Most exotic meats like bison come gamey and with no taste. Here at PH, they found a way to create this burger with flavor.  By the way, trying to up your protein for the day? This burger has to be close to 70 grams of protein.  Yeah buddy!

As for the restaurant itself, I felt that it is a little small. But I love the ambiance, decor, and service. One things for sure, there's a ton of fit peeps eating here. I also got the opportunity to meet one of the owners, Andrew Bic. To be successful in any venture, it comes down to how you treat people. Andrew got this right. He took the time to chat it up, ask for suggestions, and gave a little insight of what PH is all about.  I didn't get the chance to meet the other owner, Larissa  Reis, but look forward to it on future visits.  If you're use to the taste that a 1000 calorie burger joint has to offer, then maybe Protein House is not for you.  If you're looking for some quality macros with high amounts of protein in a burger, then give Protein House a shot.  

Wish List:
-Ostrich:  With about the same amount of protein as steak and with calories/fat that rival chicken, I think ostrich should be on their menu.
-Nutritional Information:  For a place that specializes in selling healthy meals, I think this information is necessary.  Per the owner, this is in the works with a dietitian.

PS: Like all other healthy eating locations (i.e Whole Foods, Greens & Protein, etc), expect a higher price tag here.  But through their build-your-own, you can actually get a meal fairly cheap.",y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ,16,12,5,GGlid2fzdoGoD_oJe3Xalg

They also have a cooler full of energy drinks (including my current favorite - Bang) in addition to a protien shake bar and normal soft drinks.

4145280,2013-09-23,4,DVJkxZkLKS76Khb2y6XA6A,"The Protein House on Eastern in Las Vegas Left Me Disappointed

My hubby and I are kind of health nuts, by that I mean we work out 5-6 days per week and eat a 98% non processed vegan diet.

I was with my son at Sams Club right nearby and was starving, so I thought that I would go out and check out the Protein House. I thought for sure it would be a healthy menu that I could get something I would not regret eating.

Walking in the Protein House, I felt a little uncomfortable, there was a huge guy, likely a body builder or fighter hovering over the cashier, and he didn't seem extremely friendly. But, I did take this as a good sign that bodies were the focus in this place and I liked that. 

I was right, it is a healthy menu, however I do have a problem with a place that calls itself the ""Protein House"" or ""Greens and Proteins"" for that matter and they have not gotten with the times, that a lot of people do not eat meat anymore. This place does get ""kudos"" for having a vegan protein on the menu, which Greens and Proteins does not, but its vegetarian and vegan options for food are a little on the ""down low.""

Why don't you have tofu options for your salads, bowls, etc? or Gardein? Heck the Yardhouse has an entire Gardein menu, get a clue!

They have a black bean and quinoa veggie burger and a veggie bowl. The veggie bowl can be quinoa or brown rice and I love both, but they don't come with a sauce. So, I asked what the sauce was and they looked at me like I was crazy. It doesn't come with a sauce they said, do you want a sauce on the side, and I said yes. What do you have? 

The girl was very nice and said we have bbq, teriyaki, balsalmic, blah blah many others. Ok, so I went with teriyaki as I am vegan and I figured this would be the least likely to get messed up with some cheese or cream or something so I chose that one. I specifically asked for NO mushrooms, its the one veggie that I hate.

I had to ask how to get my bottle of water and it was uncomfortably quiet in there while I waited for my food, except for the massive TV with the SF 49r's game on and my six year old which were great contributions to the action. They have a table set up in the back that appears to be their office, I found that tacky... now I have some ideas if they want them to make that table cool and fit the theme, like make it a judges table, autograph table or nutrition booth or something, but to sit out there in the public like that is just unprofessional. 

When I did receive my food, it was FULL of mushrooms, but I was starving and it wasn't meat or cheese so I attempted to pick them out as I went along. The veggies were gorgeous, asparagus, peppers, cauliflower, zucchini and the quinoa was cooked perfectly. My only suggestion is for them not to cut the veggies up so small, this is the main part of the veggie dish and they were diced teeny tiny seeming like I was still missing the main dish.

Oh, the sauce... well the first sauce was my teriyaki and it looked creamy! How does teriyaki get creamy? I don't know, but I'm not eating it. I asked for something else, I got the balsamic. It looked chunky and not like any balsamic I have ever seen. So, unfortunately my opinion on the sauces is very poor. If you serve a bowl of any kind, don't you need a sauce?

I guess I'm the only one who ever asked for a sauce as they looked at me like an alien when I asked for one. Last but not least. SALT. I know, its not the best for you, but I need flavor on my food.

At the Protein House, I walked around and found pepper but no salt. And, they couldn't find salt. I mean I know you are a bunch of manly and womanly body builder types, but 99% of the population wants some salt on their food.

They finally found me some in the kitchen in a cabinet and had to put it in a little dish for me. Wow, Gordon Ramsay would have had a hay day with that episode.

All in all, I appreciate the whole idea of the place, its supposed to be trendy and focused on body building, but they have to be realistic that the bodybuilding population is such a small percentage of their potential revenue, that they have to open their minds to all the other healthy people out there that might want to eat there.

After today, I will not go back, unless of course I see a change of the way I was treated or (sized up), the menu and the atmosphere. Otherwise if they were going on food only, minus the mushroom mistake, the food concept is one that I would love!",ylYE2t10D4_2Q3oC-uGlmw,10,2,2,vNGs_1Vj1nHOx0LsIJdw9A

It had the perfect blend of quinoa (noms), broccoli (yum), avocado (AVOOOO!!!), asparagus (bye bye water weight) and squash (I barely ever eat this stuff) - my only wish is that they have tomatoes or lime for me to squeeze onto. The salmon was soft in texture but not so buttery as I would like it to be. Needless to say I was filled and my burning insides were heartily satisfied. This would be my go-to, that's to say if I come here often after working out.

Customer service was terrible and I did not tip. The female cashier was very meek, lacked desire for life and had zero enthusiasm. 

Men's restroom is full of cleaning/maintenance equipment(ladder) that overflows into the restroom stall.
Lastly, I was given a number to place on my table as if a waiter would be bringing me my order. Instead, I was beckoned by a chef to pick up my order at the counter.

I had to ask for my receipt and she seemed irritated. We got the receipt and and noticed a $4 charge. We were charged $2 extra per burger for the choice of Ezekiel bread. It's only $4 and we would have no problem paying BUT it does NOT state that there is an extra charge for different bread on the menu. It actually says ""with your choice of..."" Or something along those lines. AND the cashier did NOT mention that the bread is an additional cost. Again, the money part doesn't bother us but the lack of communication from the cashier AND that the menu is MISLEADING. This is just straight bad customer service and SHADY. We brought it to her attention and she acknowledged that it does not state the extra charge on the menu but it's on her computer so she had to charge us. Hopefully these cashiers will at least be courteous from not on and let paying customers know. She did offer our money back but we declined because that wasn't the point. Also, I ordered sweet potato ""sticks"" and they are NOT sticks. They're cubed sweet potatoes. Annoying. Not worth the $34! I'm all about paying extra for healthy food but when places are shady with pricing and customer service is crap that's where I draw the line. I think Daily Kitchen is WAY better and Greens n Proteins as well.  The burger was good but not good enough for me to ever come back. I hope the owner reads this and takes this into consideration.

I ordered the Aloha Signature burger which comes with grilled chicken, pineapple, red onion and teriyaki sauce. When I received the burger I thought it looked a little... Plain. I noticed they had forgotten the pineapple. So I took the burger back to the counter and asked for pineapple. The cook didn't seem to speak English and did not understand me so the cashier was explaining they didn't have the regular pineapple slice.???? But they could cut some up and put it on in chunks. They seemed almost put out by my request. They put the pineapple on in chunks with a really shitty presentation so as soon as I tried to pick it up the burger contents fell all over wooden plank plate. 

The fact that they tried to short me the main ingredient on my burger then implied to me that they were put out by adding it and then was a terrible presentation makes me not want to return again.

Compared to something popular like SkinnyFats where they won't advertise their nutritional information, Protein House is all about giving you the information.

The food:

Signature Bowls - They have many types of bowls that are good sources of protein served over quinoa, brown rice or 50/50 both.  Each has a bit of veggies on it.  The El Jefe is a bit more expensive due to the amount of mean, since you are getting about 12 ounces of lean protein!

Southwest Bowl - Top Sirloin.
Greek Bowl - Ground Turkey
BBQ Bowl - Chicken
Vegetarian Bowl - Bunch of good Veggies
Teriyaki Bowl - Salmon
El Jefe - Turkey and Bison

Signature Burgers - I haven't tried these yet, but we are talking Bison Meat, egg whites, chicken, turkey in their variety of different choices on the menu.  

Smoothies - I also haven't tried these yet, but we are talking some serious healthy ingredients! 240 to over 600 calories depending on what you want.  Protein amounts will vary.

Breakfast - Love pancakes and I often don't eat them due to the carbs.  Here, they have multigrain Whey Pancakes with egg whites.  Whoo Hoo!  They also have plenty of other items like Hash, Quesadilla, and even loaded oatmeal that you can add protein to!

The place:

Great music, TV, and either tall boy tables, couch seating or regular tables. Clean, friendly, helpful.  This is generally a order, pay and pick up your food type of place.

The Extras:

If you like low sugar Quest Bars, they sell them here!.  They have coffees and Frappuccinos as well as some specials and juices!

If you're looking for a healthy place to grab a bite and refuel your muscles with lean protein and veggies and whole food carbs, this is where you come! 

My favorites are the SHREDD bowl, the Vitamin c juice, and the PBJ pancake! -- their bison and steak in any meal are super tender and delicious! The PBJ Pancake has to be a favorite of mine when I'm having a sweets craving! It's made with whole wheat pasta and whey protein and sugar free jelly and peanut butter! 

If you want to add flavor, there is a large assortment of condiments ranging from Sriracha to Liquid aminos!

If you download their app, you can get rewards and earn points towards future meals! 

There may be protein cookies and brownies by the front counter too!",ihTu74HkXnKGuY5v_Z8b0g,3,3,4,4V6CqHyuY-rl7KfrUOyTLQ

Surprisingly, they don't have a lot of vegetarian options so I ordered the berry acai bowl which was listed for $7.99 and recommended to me by a friendly female staff member. A friendly male staff member rang me up and told me it would be $10.00. I told him it's listed on the menu for $7.99. He said ""oh, that's for the smoothies, the bowls cost more"" Well, that would be ok if it were actually listed anywhere on the menu, but it clearly states ""smoothies and acai bowls $7.99"" I thought maybe it was just a mistake on the menu so I looked above where they have the entire menu written on chalk boards. Once again, clearly listed ""smoothies and acai bowls $7.99"" I then asked the female employee if the price listed was wrong. She said ""yes, the bowls are more because there's more toppings"" I said ""then you really should change the prices on the menus"" she said ""I know, I told him (the owner, manager??) that"". The whole thing just seemed wrong to me.

They have options for bread like wheat, Ezekiel (which is good for my blood sugar). It's 5 minutes away from EOS and Vegas Discount Nutrition. Great location and food. Service has always been great.

So, I met fellow Yelper Loren and her boyfriend for lunch.  Protein House is in a strip mall in Green Valley.  I didn't have any problems finding the place nor parking.  I walked in and sat down and checked out the menu.  They have a pretty extensive menu that could fill all of my nutritional needs.  I decided to go with a protein bowl, called the Lolo bowl.  The bowl had Chocolate Whey Protein, strawberries, blueberries, bananas, and oats.  It was really filling and a perfect treat for a hot summer day.

Loren and Skyler had a Mahi Tuna sandwich that looked amazing.  The decor was interesting.  There was a wall full of posters of hot fitness competitors, called the wall of fame.

Smoothies are to die for delicious. Vanilla Gorilla & Peanut Butter Dream are my picks. Also try the peanut butter protein cupcakes. They're DELISH and good to take on the go. 

The fact that you can build your own bowl, burger or salad is dope, too. And you can choose your protein size portions! The ahi rocks and the pancakes are a must try when you feel like breakfast.

Protein House is casual, tasty and reasonably priced.

In this instance, the yolked Brazilian owner was getting screwed by her staff and gets busted.  I saw that the scene took place here in Las Vegas, but never thought to look the place up.

Anyhow, the place is a lot like Greens and Protiens, without the rush and with a more user friendly menu with much more enticing names,  if you ask me.  Sexy Bitch?!?  C'mon now...just imagine,  someone eating out a sexy...well you get the point.

The ultra-modern look also adorns the dining area,  similar to G&P, except this place uses tougher colors,  yeah!  It's like Cobra Commander eats here while Oscar the Grouch eats at G&P with Kermit the Frog.  I wouldn't even flinch if I heard someone slamming their plate to the table after 3 rep bites with an emphatic grunt....Arrrrggghhhhh!

The ginormous screen was also playing some NCAA games,  which was a plus.  Seems like they do everything big up in hur, I swear that TV needed Olympic doping tests #pacquiao...and so did my PH Burger.  

Being in this place gave me the feeling to go big or go home, the no pain no gain mentality.  I inquired whether I should opt for the single patty, or go for the Muscle Builder Burger, 2 bison patties topped with bacon.  The girl at the register said the single should suit me just find, when in fact I can picture her saying, ""not with those puny arms,"" like in the State Farm commercial with Discount Double Check A Rod.  She was right tho...

The wifey ordered the Sexy Bitch without hesitation,  just cause she is.  The bowl was a healthy dose of lightly grilled veggies and quinoa topped with a nice slab of salmon.  I took a few bites and nodded in approval. 

Overall, the Protein House was pretty good and a great option for meatheads, health nuts,  clean eaters and average Joe dodge ball...check it out for yourself and don't forget to check in for 10% off your entire meal.

I ordered the Chocolate Monster Protein Pancakes. It consists of two HUGE chocolate chip pancakes topped with bananas, walnuts and sugar free chocolate sauce. It was delicious but with a bit too much of an artificial sweetness to it. I could only eat half since they were so big plus loaded with protein. 
I wish they used all natural ingredients though. That was a downer in my opinion. 
I also ordered a Southwest Bowl to-go. Lean steak with black beans, veggies and brown rice. I had that later on my ride home. So fresh and good!

I really enjoyed the food there although I was disappointed with the quality of the protein powder they use for their pancakes and other recipes. It contain artificial sweeteners and ingredients that are not healthy, so even though the pancakes were high in protein and sugar free, I still considered them ""unhealthy.""
I think Protein House has a great thing going, but they should change the brand of protein the use to make it TRULY a healthy eating place.",2eMXbt4XCbF981FJ8hBvWA,5,1,4,83Y_FphhRilnX-mxZY6tmw

Breakfasts, burgers, bowls, salads, juices, and smoothies are on the menu, with options to choose from one of PH's creations or make your own, which I prefer.  I've had a turkey bowl and a sirloin steak bowl, with either the quinoa or brown rice, adding mushrooms, tomatoes,or broccoli.  I monitor the portion sizes of my protein and carbs, and PH's menu helps by listing the ounces of their servings knowing that there are other people like me who want to know those details.  Andrew, the co-owner and the picture of muscle and fitness himself, has been there each time we've eaten there, manning the register and always checking on us after we get our orders.

5688637,2013-06-14,5,DVJkxZkLKS76Khb2y6XA6A,"I think I am one of the first to get to experience this place and let me just say ..ah now this is what I needed. It's like a Tropical Smoothie meets Greens and Proteins meets Coffee Shop that was spliced with a healthy Egg Works. Lots of options meat, salads and vegetarian dishes, breakfast, coffee, smoothies. I can see this as being a healthy option for those doing shows, working out, training for fights, on Paleo or looking to indulge while staying healthy.

I ordered three things, I like to eat what can I say? The best I can do to stifle my inner fat kid is to force-feed him healthy meals a majority of the time. 3 steps forward, one step back. Anyway, I got the bison cheeseburger, PH breakfast, and BBQ chicken bowl with quinoa (with BBQ sauce flavored with stevia instead of sugar, damn they're on it for those of you that like to drizzle sauce all over your food). A little more expensive from most places but about on par when I'm ordering things like bison, which isn't cheap. When I first started eating it, of course I wanted to compare it to Greens and Proteins but it's not really the same thing. Greens and protein is healthy and has good health alternatives for vegans and vegetarians but outside of several items it lacks sufficient protein options for me. So where Greens and Proteins lacks Protein House makes up in protein (meat, chicken, egg whites), alternatives for customized shakes, and smoothies, and easier to stay within how my friends and I eat. So can't really compare the two, they're both good. It's like comparing apples and oranges, both fruit, but they are both in different categories. 

 In any event, they're still working out some kinks but this place has the potential to continue expanding and get better. Now I know some of you picky eaters will complain that it's just okay but I also heard this from the same person who dislikes fish and complains at sushi restaurants. Wtf! Hey it might just not be your thing. But it's simple, if you need your protein, you need your veggies, you need your carbs and you need healthy, this is the spot. This isn't necessarily a place I would go to indulge but it is exactly the place I would go to keep me on track during the week so I can indulge later in the weekend.

The portion was large and I'm actually very glad about that because it lasted me all night at work (10 hour shift and the hospital's cafeteria wasn't open during my shift). It was filling enough for me to eat a little bit and come back to it. The produce was very fresh and the tuna was fresh and seasoned very nicely.

It's definitely not hard to find the place when you park. It's very clear with the nice big sign outside. I haven't dined indoors yet but it seemed inviting. I like the little impulse-buy sections they have with protein bars, drinks, etc. I'm excited to try more of what's on their menu. Next time I'm on that side of town I'll be trying out something different. It seems like it only gets better each time for most patrons! :)",lotK4A6gdUYsdi3ej0EMmg,1,1,4,gb2S-FLYr_2dGY9xhYmV0w

They have great cooks here, because a little seasoning goes a long way.  They do a good job keeping the food clean, not too much oil, not too much of anything that allows the natural ingredients to take on it's flavor.  If you're looking to add more flavor, they have probably 10 different types of hot sauces, sweet sauces that you can add on yourself.

For example, they have an omelette made with 6 egg whites, a little bit of ham, folded over, topped with a few spoonful of cottage cheese and voila, protein packed meal.  They serve this meal with a variety of freshly cut fruits like melon, pineapple to end on a sweet note.  

The average price is around $11 for a meal, but check them out on Groupon for better deals.  Download their app, so you can rack up free meals or smoothies with the online frequent card.  The current promotion with Yelp check-in for 10% off your order.  

We recently discovered the protein pancakes topped with their protein frozen yogurt and it was definitely a fun dessert.  I can't see how this was even good for me, but it wasn't overly sweet and I didn't feel disgusted, so it was just right up my alley.  Totally hits the spot to satisfy that sweet craving.

We like to take out of town guests for a healthy meal because we really like it here.  

One last thing.... Don't be intimidated by the jack-up looking dudes that eat here too, because everyone is friendly here. 

Check out my delicious pictures. Yum!",sAOdKC09kMqFfnVCrJRWvQ,10,7,4,FAnFKDLJMZ53tpYASNL71Q

That is a huge difference!! Texture, color, flavor and smell are completely opposite. When they changed the product and didn't tell me, I knew something was off on my first bite. I have a very sensitive palette and can sense even a tiny change. The impossible meat smelled and tasted like wheat, dry consistency and breaks apart easily. I used to order this 3x's a week and now I don't even want to order it anymore. Please bring back BEYOND meat!! Thank you.",xedHsPfMpBr-WUKEwlb8rA,3,3,2,m-ikjhvPLcbbx1DdvI0zCA

I ordered the the Muscle boy and she ordered Chocolate monster pancake and also tried their brewed coffee. The coffee is above average, my muscle boy is a good source of protein but I won't crave for it. The pancake has its own character and will appeal to protein craving person. 
Service is average I don't like the plastic forks and they can add a little ambiance and cleanliness. Buy a Groupon so there will be value otherwise there are better Lunch and Breakfast place much better for the money.",O38E6KW3oiUD9VxHNziakg,0,0,3,Dax4dxh7UCEBu2SbSb6VOg
5948449,2015-09-22,0,DVJkxZkLKS76Khb2y6XA6A,"After moving to Henderson my husband and I were anxious to try this place.  Since we hadn't been before we were not sure what to order.  The woman at the counter was rude and short with us- I told her it was our first time and she handed me a paper menu, not explaining anything or asking any questions.  You'd think they would want new customers but based off her attitude that was clearly not the goal. We both decided on acai bowls.  They were absolutely phenomenal- five stars for food. It's unfortunate the customer service didn't match the food. My husband is a professional athlete so we were hoping we'd found a new ""spot.""",0zykmmbVmHHAErF-RmylqA,1,0,3,IIx_3rdiIz-IfR2o7j3ktw

It came with bison (medium rare), diced potatoes, egg whites and caramelized onions. Man I was in heaven, I only wish that there was one here in orange County, CA. This really is the spot for healthy eating that actually tasse good!",FaNr2l2E8JwD-t4piNtW-Q,0,0,5,QhK5MDagO2RRKsY5chrNvQ
