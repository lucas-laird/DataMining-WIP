Plus a lot of TV's in there so chances of catching the game you want is on in there!",hnG8bXruJDQGcRjVcURE4Q,2,0,3,8moVI8w7Q6OtcWnrq4czSw

Ok I was only there briefly, but long enough to know that I wasn't her concern, the personal (assumption) phone call she was on was obviously more important to her than her only customer. 
I was originally going to order food, and request drink again, but she didn't give me a chance to,  I would have had to interrupt her conversation, and she stood on the other side of the bar, I guess so I couldn't hear her conversation but it also made it difficult to ask for anything so I just left, then she asked me if I was ""good"". I'll go get a burger at Wendy's.",UDKqdVT0FrpL19shSOqgow,0,0,2,GFVPU1YSLnGrHFwv3CvGcg

Can't remember if you have to pay to play pool but I remember giving up ID to get the balls from the bartender.

Ok this is a pretty sad review. I had a little recollection of that night. Too much whiskey for this kid.",oS2O8YQ31HTSTQgPQKc7Cg,3,1,4,dLCbflZzobEwXMa4iB9wBw
