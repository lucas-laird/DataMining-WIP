After ordering food for my family , I asked to upgrade the aqua fresca drink , the cashier said they only offer one size  so I acknowledged and that was perfectly ok no big deal. Until her rude associate named Genelle comes up in front of us and starts to pour herself and aqua fresca in a LARGE CUP , the size I asked to upgrade too, I then asked how come I couldn't upgrade I was willing to pay she rudely said this is for me only and just walks to the back ! 
I let it go and just kept my comments to myself . It didn't stop there, as we waited for our plates she kept looking at us and making comments and laughing. As soon as our plates were done she just called our name and threw the plates down, didn't even bother to check the receipts as she was for everyone before us. At that I point I was pissed . We just walked away and STILL DIDN'T SAY ONE THING . As we were eating it felt as if there was a hawk just watching , she kept looking and making comments to another employ at the ice cream stand next to her . . 

After we finished I approached her specifically and read her badge and asked her to contact her manager . The manager did come and as a manager should , she heard me out offered an apology and asked if she could get us anything. I  didn't want anything nor was I trying to get anything. But being a manager myself I feel it's important if employees are being the way she was I also would like to know . She has affected your business I might only be a little dollar amount to what that business makes a day, but imagine all the other people who have dealt with her and have decided to never spend money there again. The dollars add up pretty quickly . Vegas is based on recommendations , tourists read to research where they want to and don't want to go. I hope she gets a lesson in customer service and Vegas being so competitive I hope management takes care of this situation before they lose more money ..",mFAGNBACJDndYxY1uEpgyg,2,0,1,aGhLMHCVO1jNoGJbwuiPEA

Menu is small: about seven varieties of tacos (three to an order), two ceviches, and some small items like quesadillas, and the rest of the menu is aguas frescas and margaritas. Opted for the Alambre tacos- beef with grilled peppers and onions. So tasty, so fresh, good quality.

 But lord, I wish they hadn't opened on the Strip because prices are literally double what they should be. At $10 for three MINI tacos, it's about a buck a bite.

This place seems to have a worse general opinion than it would otherwise deserve. Granted, it's a food court in MGM with a bunch of other places, but really it did not come off as being significantly worse than what would be expected or desired from such an establishment in such a location.

I ordered the steak tacos, which were reasonable priced, tasty, and excellent quality. There was no gristle or under/over-cooking and the tortillas were nice and toasty. The salsas available complemented well, and the guacamole was also pretty good (albeit a little citrusy). The whole meal cost about $15 and was definitely filling.

The chicken had no flavor, was chopped into small bitty pieces and they hardly gave you any. There was more shredded lettuce than anything else. The limp shredded lettuce is not even hand shredded. It is a bagged shredded lettuce because you can taste the off flavor of the preservatives that is added to bagged shredded lettuce. I felt like I was eating an awful salad in a wrap. This burrito had no girth and substance. It was the flimsiest, unflavorful, expensive and smallest burrito I've ever had at a authentic Mexican restaurant.  The tortilla they used was cold and chewy like a generic American brand. Nothing authentic from a local Mexican brand manufacturer. It wasn't soft and warm like a burrito should feel in your hands.

I am a Las Vegas local. If this restaurant was anywhere else in Las Vegas they would have  closed  their doors due to lack of business. No local would return after the first visit and you would have to rely on the locals to keep you open. The only reason you are still in business at the food court in Caesars Palace because it is tourists that are going there and you don't have to rely on them returning. Tourists go to your spot in the food court for a quick bite not because they recognize your name as a chain. They leave liking the food or not liking the food. There experience ends there. You only have 51 yelp reviews so tourists don't care or feel it's necessarily to rate your restaurant. There is no other Mexican restaurant in the food court so you have no competition. However, for a Las Vegas local eating at this restaurant somewhere off the strip you bet there would be plenty more negative reviews because there are so many excellent authentic Mexican restaurants that you would have to stand side by side in competition. I understand your rent must be high and that's why you charge $9.99 for a lousy burrito. Come on, I know wholesale food prices for chicken, beans, lettuce, tomatoes, onions and cilantro is nothing.

I had gotten Smashburger, my cousins decided for La Gloria.

They decided to give me a chicken taco. I remember it was chicken. Why? It was dry, had no taste, and looked unappetizing. For the Yelp? For the Yelp! If I recall it was ~ $6 for a pair of 3 tacos, which makes no sense. $2 for that sad thing you call a taco? What? Why?

Make sure you get more salsa or hot sauce. Something that will give it flavor. They have some on there but it's not enough.

To their credit though, they do put a lot of meat on there. It's just... something I would not get or eat again.

The people working here were busy amongst themselves in the back of the kitchen.  Honestly, because they have so many decorations and food display items for their sauces, etc; they could barely see anyone standing in line waiting to order.  Which was the reason for me having to get their attention by waving my hands in the air and voicing out, ""hello, hello?""

Anyway, I was the only customer (I only ordered one dish) and it took about 20 minutes for my Tacos to finish.  BTW, I ordered the fish taco dish that contained 3 soft tacos with fried white fish, lettuce, tomato, and some seasoned sauce that didn't taste seasoned.  The dish was okay, it lacked flavor and was plain to me.

I was a little disappointed because they're marketed as a street food market for Mexican food when actually it didn't taste anything like that.  They have a lot of drink specials for margaritas but I didn't order any so I can't comment on that.

So what did we decide to get . Burritos at La Gloria . When we were going to have Mexican food in the upcoming 4 hours for dinner .

You order at cashier , pay, wait for your order . They have a self serve salsa bar that has three salsas, limes, onions. 

All three of us ordered the steak burrito (about $11). It comes with carne asada, lettuce , salsa, avocado , beans . It's a nice size for the price and considering you're in a fancy hotel . 

I asked mine without beans and asked if I could get something else instead . Cashier said yes a bit of guacamole at no charge . The girl who gave me burrito though said I should have been charged though . So oh well .

The beef was ok. I didn't like the lettuce as it made the burrito soggy . The salsa was nice . There is a tiny slice of avocado inside the burrito .
