I think so far my favorite is the homemade raviolis and their white balsamic salads. Their pizzas are also very good. My husband likes crunchy thin crusts & I like soft but their pizzas meet in the middle of crunchy & soft so we both can enjoy it :) so glad we found this place & it's super close to our house!,Pq_vP9sMxdIrw-q6nU5g2w,2,1,5,c9enUgZ3LGJ99Hd44Qe9VA

Delivered hot and fresh.  The pepperoni was much better than the veggie it was just lacking in the vegetable quantity to be considered one of their specialty pizzas. I would give them another try but would probably stick to regular pizzas.,8HfsL_1Ne6ldx3dyvMWu6Q,1,2,4,IkBIWpxNO7Ew-I2lS3tkdQ

Well I may not be a Foodie who dresses like a lumberjack, or have 500 Yelp friends and 800,000 reviews. But I tell you hwut, this is some good friggin pizza!
It may cost a little bit of money, but I left with no regrets and will go back happily knowing that I am supporting a local business putting out quality product.

I decided to test out Frankie's, since it was very convenient.

We ordered a slice of pizza with Italian sausage, a Stromboli, and a pepperoni roll. 

The pizza was not great. It lacked flavor, and the crust was tough.

The Stromboli was huge! You certainly get your money's worth here. I enjoyed it, but it could use a touch more flavor. It has just the right amount of meat.

The pepperoni roll was also good. This was the doughiest product, but I like that. 

The sauce here is acidic and a bit oily. It's lighter in color than elsewhere and definitely has a distinct taste. 

Overall, Frankie's is a solid choice for a NY style pizza spot.",cgUCtSaxZ4Mt_3k691UU2A,1,2,4,EU859p5rMbKSHArY78b-nA

So today, I was driving to the store, at the light on Wigwam, waiting to take a left onto Eastern and noticed Frankies Pizza sign staring me in the face across the street, as if to say, (said in an italian New York accent) ""Yo, whats-a-madda-you?  Why doncha try some real pizza?  Other pizza? ...Forgetta 'bout it!""

There is soooo much potential there though, I must say. I ordered a margarita pizza, garlic knots, and penne marinara to go. There was a little wait but no big deal, I was taking in the environment since it was my first time trying this place. The vibe was very warm and welcoming, and the place (I assume) is family owned because it has that little something extra that bigger restaurants can't replicate. The food I ordered was not bad by any means, but it came in under my expectations. The marinara sauce was a little runny with the (perfectly cooked) penne and garlic knots needed a little more seasoning-even for me and I usually do very light seasoning if any. The margarita pizza crust was amazing though! So crispy and not soggy, thin like NY pizza. (Could have used much more basil but that's me). If that sauce was a little heartier, I thing that pizza would have been superb. Definitely will come back and try again maybe a couple months down the road. 4 stars because of that ""little something extra"" this place possesses.",Xfbmj7jkbg2z2QwHp5Tfjw,0,0,4,rWNS1cxcdfncWSYdITcRpg

First of all the place is owned by NEW YORKERS!!! Italian NYers at that. And it's family run. We were warmly greeted when we came in by Victoria. She is friendly and answered questions about the menu. My hubby and I each got one of the specials: I got the slice, salad, & drink, hubs got the 2 slices and a drink. The salad was perfect in size and not just ice burg lettuce and a few cherry tomatoes, nope, romaine cukes, olives and cut up tomatoes. The ranch dressing was thick and creamy. Now for the pizza...where do I start? I could tell by looking at it that it was perfect. The problem with pizza here is that it's limp. The crust tends to be, well, soggy. NOT here! The crust is thin & crisp. The sauce is perfectly seasoned, not over powering and the cheese was perfectly melted. Let's not forget the oil. Good NY pizza has a crunch and drips with olive oil. This has it in spades. Hubby got pepperoni, mine was plain cheese. The icing on the cake were the complimentary garlic knots! Baled to perfection and served on a nifty tin bucket with a side of marinara. Victoria chatted with us and made us few right at home. The hubby made a point of telling the guys making the food how great everything was. Perfecto & delicioso!! Frankie's Pizza is an amazing gem in the Silverado Ranch neighborhood. I am looking forward to going back and trying the Vodka Penne and the cannoli. And they deliver!!! But go in! I promise, you won't be disappointed. Especially if you're from NY, NJ, or Boston.

I glanced at the menu and the pizza by the slice caught my eye. They give you a good amount of food, two slices of pizza with a side of garlic knots and a drink for $7. The pizza tastes delicious, it's cheesy, hot and crispy with hearty portions of pepperoni and sausage.
They also make meatball sliders on garlic knots which I never heard of but it's amazing, especially when it's dipped in marinara sauce. 

Frankie's Pizza is a family run business with a nice and courteous staff. I notice when people walk in they are pleased to stop by and that makes me feel it's a cool place to have to pizza.

I like the Hawaiian best. I tried their meat lover pizza once and if you order that, you better LOVE meat because they load it up so much that it was actually too much meat for me! Their salads are well made also, unlike a lot of pizza places.

Anywho, I decided to call in for Pickup a few days ago because of the amazing reviews for this place. Also, I'm ALWAYS down for discovering new pizza places. 

Always.

We ordered the pizza online through Eat24 and went to pick it up at the designated time. The place is kind of easy to miss, since the plaza it's in is pretty massive. Frankie's is attached to the Village Pub, so that helps to know. I spent entirely to long trying to look for it, lol.  

The place itself is super clean. My husband and I were greeted at the door when we arrived and served promptly. The woman at the counter was friendly and we were served in a very timely manner. A+ Customer Service.

The reason for the 3 star, is the pizza itself. So. The price for the amount of pizza you get is pretty nice. It was $18.00 for a Meat Lovers, and with tip/tax it came to about $22 for a 16 inches. Okay, I can live with that. The pizza itself, was thin crust, with a plethora of meat on it. The meat tasted good, but nothing out of the ordinary, the crust was what one would expect from a thin crust, but once again, nothing out of the ordinary. That basically sums up the whole pizza. Not great, not horrible, just good. Definitely a cut (haha) above ""fast food"" pizza.

Would I eat here again? Maybe, if I was in the neighborhood and wanted pizza. I wouldn't go out of my way to get it, though. It was solid, but there are definitely better pizza places out there.",1hJVutieYDBwGx8INWv3IA,6,3,3,oXmiZwzry6EjFV4oh_24sQ

Cons: Wings are made with tomato sauce, better local pizza place down the street. No website.

I love to try new restaurants and support local businesses. This place has great reviews on Yelp, but sometimes this can be misleading with new businesses (friends/family inflating reviews). The staff are great and I would really like to see this place do well, but the pizza industry in Vegas/Henderson is VERY competitive

The pizza is better than most, but is not as good as a another local place nearby. The wings were dissapointing, because I was expecting a buffalo style wing. Their version was stewed or baked in a spicy tomato sauce. Not bad, but I wouldn't have ordered them if they provided this information on their Yelp menu.
