We tried to order online to receive the 15% off online discount, as advertised on their menu, but got a message that said the store was closed. Called in and the employee told us they must have  forgotten to turn it on?No big deal, so we waited a few minutes and tried again (dumb of me to assume the employee might try to fix the issue?) and still no go. I called in again, the employee was unapologetic and unwilling to honor the discount or even talk to a manager to see if there was anything that could be done. She was curt, unprofessional, and unfriendly. As a manager in customer service, I was pretty surprised at how awful the employee did taking my phone call/order. Delivery took 45 minutes.

When asked to speak with a manager was told they're not there. Which didn't make sense since she said she was just told they're not taking Groupons. She then stated the manager is busy working.

2047236,2015-05-11,15,jSu2A7DibDjmUd3wUt6fPg,"I always like giving restaurants at least one chance. Every other month someone stops by the office to drop off menu's so I finally decided to give Primavera a try despite the reviews. 

I rang them close to my lunch break, it took them 40 minutes to deliver my food which is normal for downtown delivery. The guy who took my order was polite. 

Items ordered:
Gyro lunch special ($6.99)
Cannoli ($2.99)

The lunch special runs Monday-Thursday and includes a soda. When the delivery driver got here, he placed the order on my desk, the bags were tied so I didn't get to open them until he left. In one bag there was a soda, in the other my gyro, but no cannoli or tzatziki sauce. I called Primavera back and told them what I was missing. The same guy who took my order answered and just said ""Oh, wow"", no apology, he just kept on repeating that over and over again and said he would send someone back out, then hung up, no goodbye. Ten minutes later, a different delivery driver drops in and says ""the cook said the tzatziki sauce is in the box. I showed him the box and even lifted up the gyro, no sauce. He apologized, gave me my cannoli and tzatziki, then left. Why would I lie about not getting my sauce? 

The food itself was okay. I ate the majority of the fries while waiting for the tzatziki sauce to arrive. They were semi-warm, a bit soggy, but the seasoning salt they used on the was good. I bet they would have tasted great if they were hot and crispy. On to the gyro, the pita bread was a bit hard, it wasn't soft so I ate around the hard parts, the meat was good though, it was very tender. The tzatizki sauce was good, it wasn't too strong. The cannoli was okay, the filling was very subtle. Overall, I don't think I'd order from Primavera again, there are far better restaurants downtown with better service and food.",RUa2_2yuSwJtU7sTXz-omA,6,4,2,S11QFL21i95EdP44mhNcZg

Small places always have the best food, and this place absolutely proved that statement to be true. I ordered a Caesar salad, spaghetti bolognese, and a large pepperoni pizza.

But everything was delicious enough to over look the small imperfections. A must have on pizza night.

2177498,2016-01-01,0,jSu2A7DibDjmUd3wUt6fPg,"So I don't live too terribly far from here but unfortunately the yelp reviews have kept me away. Sometimes yelp fails like that...

So tonight I wanted pizza while I stayed in the New Year. I decided to give them a shot and I'm very glad I did. I called up and ordered the Supreme Pizza and a few Meatballs. I could have ordered online, but I wanted to see if the Meatballs were homemade or frozen. Luckily they buy them from a local bakery so I was totally in. They said it would be 25 minutes so I set my timer and had a salad while I waited. I drove on over and was quickly greeted inside.

The lady behind the counter was friendly but it was a bit cold in there. It was still going to be a few minutes but luckily we filled the time with paying and all that jazz. I was a little grateful that I got there a little early as I knew I'd be getting a hot out of the oven pizza. 

I got the meatballs and pizza home and dug into the meatballs while I wanted for my piping hot pizza to cool. The meatballs were big, super yummy and came with tons of marinara. When I finally got to take a bite of the pizza it was warm, gooey, crammed with toppings and YUMMY! My ONLY complaint was that the crust was a bit thick but that isn't their fault. I just like super thin crust so I got over myself. I liked it so much that I ate an entire 10 inch by myself. 

Would I recommend this place? Yes! Will I go back? YES",tL4NRC4uraCxjF8ZQ6GTTw,1,0,4,_TsSyZmGIC8Fo_50Jbk92A

We got mild chicken wings with fries, appetizer sampler plate, and eggplant Parmesan. We also asked for utensil, plates, ranch, etc.

Fried appetizer platter was soggy and tasted like stale, like they twice deep fried old ones.

Chicken wings were just ok. A bit bland n dry and they forgot to give us ranch dipping sauce. Fries were soggy.

They messed up our order of eggplant Parmesan and gave us chicken parm instead. And when I called to tell them the mistake the guy insisted he saw chicken parm in the order. Absolutely not. I ordered eggplant parm for sure. The chicken parm with spaghetti was nothing special. Needed more sauce.

They delivered to my location (approximately 4 miles away) within 30 minutes of my order. Each time, I thoroughly enjoyed my purchase. The primavera pizza is hit amongst my friends and I because of the grilled eggplant.

I did not read yelp before ordering, so I did not know of others complaints. Thankfully I gave this place a try without letting reviews skew my opportunity to try something new. If you want something delicious, try the zucchini sticks or jalapeno poppers.

I will definitely be ordering from them again the next time I get a craving for eggplant.",YD7Akcx9ZmsCYJv7WlN5gw,6,1,4,DPsf3Vq_kBEjbcOFFjXqYg

I enjoyed the hot wings. Great flavor and I like that they weren't fatty at all. The ranch has a slightly different taste that im not too fond of.

Ordered from this place two nights in a row with worse service each night. First order last night was delivered late due to the whole order not in he drivers car and he had to go back to pick up one and not everyone's food was hot. Ordered a gyro which was blah but the Philly sand which was really yummy so I thought what the hell I'll try again.  

Second night, I ordered a special  for delivery. Again I'm not given the whole special and the poor delivery guy is sad and confused. Called the company was was told they aren't going to honor their special I ordered and payed for. 


As for the food of everything we had over two days : the gyro was just blah. The Philly sandwich was very yummy. Garlic cheese breed was good.  The pizza crust is cardboard and the sausage is breakfast sausage (barf) not Italian.  Get a better quality from costco.

It was the first time my coworkers ever tried the pizza, onion rings, chicken wings [yum!], & fries, and let me say, they loved it!

Compliments on the pizza and wings especially!

There were no leftovers and I received many compliments for finger foods I did not make myself!
