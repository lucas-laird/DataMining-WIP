When the only edible morsels at the buffet are the cornbread, egg drop soup and the mussels (I know...who would risk shellfish when everything else was so awful) something is very very wrong.  The BBQ pork was so tough if fired from a slingshot it could have downed a mastodon.  Not since high school was a dissection so difficult as the one I performed on the sweet and sour chicken, looking for chicken.  It was missing.  The rare roast beef appeared to be painted pink.

The waiters and front desk associates are always helpful and you can't beat the 7.99 price if you join their rewards club. The food is decent nothing atrocious and nothing spectacular. The food is sometimes left out for too long but I'm sure that has to do with it being a slower buffet and also being lower budget. They have live chefs (I recommend having them make you a fresh pasta as they actually come out delicious and seem the best way to enjoy a fresher meal and get the most bang for your buck.

At Boulder Station I had as gross an experience as one can have at a smorgasbord. It was the lunch buffet. I took from the Asian vegetarian counter, then also had juice to drink.

587532,2014-09-20,0,k-dDZvTeLysoJvjHI-qr9g,"Being that I don't really live in the area, and it is the OLDEST of the ""Station Casinos"" (starting as Bingo Palace in 1976), I make it a point to avoid Palace Station. It seems a bit run-down, old, and there is a ""funky"" odor about it. 

I've eaten at the buffet several times prior to 2004, but stopped going when I had a bad experience, not to mention moving into another part of town. I usually stick close to where I live when it comes to eating.

Now, I've been to the Santa Fe Station's buffet, the one at Red Rock, Green Valley Ranch, Sunset Station, and even Texas Station. They're awesome. I do love GVR and Santa Fe buffets more. 

Palace Station? My visit on 9/19/2014 was a reminder of why I don't go there. 

Being that I played ""myVegas"" Rewards on Facebook, I was delighted to see that they had ""comps"" and rewards to Red Rock, Palace Station, and another Station Casino.

Since my mom works 4-hours on Fridays, I decided that the lunch would be a great idea since she works in the area. 

It was the worst idea. Thankfully, it was free. That's the only good part of the meal and experience.

First I had to stop at the Rewards Center to get my ""comp"", then it was upstairs to the buffet. There was no one in line, so my mom and I walked up to the counter. The cashier was quite nasty even before I brought out the comp slip. I had to show my Driver License and Boarding Pass. 

The cashier rung up the meal, and handed my ""loyalty"" card to my mother and dismissed me entirely; despite the fact it was MY ""comp"" that paid for the meal. The cashier didn't even look at me as she handed the card and receipt to my mother. 

At age 38, I think I've passed the ""oh, you look so young stage"" that the cashier felt she needed to hand my card to my mother. Sorry, but I found that insulting. One has to be 21 to get a ""Boarding Pass"", and mine has my ""member since date"" on it. It was issued in 1997, over 17 years ago. 

Getting over that incident, my mother handed my Boarding Pass back to me so I could put it in MY wallet. That didn't start off the experience that well. But, I let it go. Maybe for some reason, the cashier was having a bad day. 

Then we waited, and waited ... for about 15 minutes to be seated. The reason? NONE. There were PLENTY of tables. In the one section we were seated in, there were only eight other patrons. That area could easily seat 150, or more. Yet, we had to wait. 

Sorry, but if you have the seating available ... you should seat your patrons asap. But, that's my take on it. 

All unoccupied tables were clean and ready for people to sit at, so it wasn't as if they'd been busy and were cleaning up. 

We were able to order the drinks quite quickly, but once we got our food? We weren't asked if we wanted refills on our drinks until we were bone dry, and ready to leave. We were cleaning up our area, and grabbing our purses when we were asked if we wanted refills. 

No thanks, we're leaving.

The staff didn't bother to check on us, only took the dirty plates and walked away -- place wasn't that busy either. Again, only eight people in our section, and there were 3-4 servers working the area. Maybe they're having a bad day. So, I figured we'd ease their load and leave.

As far as the food ... 

The food was terrible. Honestly, it SUCKED! 

In addition to such a small selection, the meats, including the turkey were OVERCOOKED, TOUGH, and DRY. The supposedly ""hot"" pasta was COLD, most of the cold foods were on the warm side, the warm foods? Stone cold. The only good thing? The desserts.They were the ONLY edible part of the meal. 

Again, since it was free, I can't complain too much. But, I wouldn't pay for it whether or not it is a ""great value"". Isn't a great value if you can't eat much of the selection and the service is not up to par. 

Maybe they were having a terrible day, maybe they were off. But, I don't think I will visit again. I can't justify rating a place simply on price. I have been to better, and I've been to the worst. The worst was the old (now gone) Boardwalk Holiday Inn Buffet on the strip. This one? I'll pass. It's not going to be the end of my world.",yv-1cAQ-yQBIR_p2yVhq5w,0,0,1,Lt6au3aX9h8NtwjVAA2xpg

It was a little on the tough side and didn't enjoy chewing on it, so I spit it out on a napkin. Uggggh! 
I also got to try the deep fried catfish. Yes, I said catfish. It was delicious! It was crunchy on the outside and tender and moist on the inside. 
For dessert, I had the pumpkin pie which was great since I love the flavors in a pumpkin pie. Perfect spice and sweetness to it. I also sampled a canolli, a small blueberry muffin and a cookie (not pictured). 
The desserts were good.

But for $5.99 for breakfast (except Sun & with club card), its cheaper than IHOP, Carrows, Hometown etc. and you also get varieties along with an Omelette station! I'm not going to complain.

For lunch its ONLY $6.99 (except Sun and with club card) and the food is descent with good amount of choices along with a burger and pasta bar!!! I have tried many buffets (low and high end) and as a low cost/lower end buffet, I really LOVE their pasta bar the best for lunch. Honestly, the pasta here taste better than the same/similar selections you get at Olive Garden. My favorite is the pasta with garlic, olive oil and lots of clams and then the spaghetti & meatballs with marinara  mix with a little Alfredo sauce, yummy! You can totally modify it with spinach etc added. Just delicious! I would get lots of vegetables to eat with this and other choices. 

Generally, if I'm craving Omelettes, I would come here instead of an IHOP etc. If I want pasta, I would come here instead of Olive Garden. If you want a few simple items, nothing too fancy without spending a lot of money, then this would be the place to be. Unless you the ambiance etc, you wont find it here but when your paying between $5.99-$7.99 and $9.99 for Sunday brunch, there shouldn't be anything to complain about.

As many others have mentioned, you need a Boarding Pass to get the buffet discount. Getting the pass is free, and simple to do. I just handed the agent my ID and she took care of the rest. 

Each Boarding Pass will allow you to purchase 2 adult buffets. So if you have a party of 8 adults, four people will need to sign up for the card. Children eat at the discounted rate without needing the cards but I don't know what the cut-ff age is. 

Soda is included in the price of the meal. You can upgrade and add beer or wine, I think for an extra $2 (not certain on this - I saw a sign that said '$2' but I didn't read the fine print)

The pasta station had good food, but I didn't like having to shout my order through a plexiglass window. The ingredients offered aren't even listed anywhere so how are you supposed to know what's available? I ordered pasta with mushrooms, spinach and clams in Alfredo sauce.

The buffet is one of the smallest I have visited in Las Vegas and gets really busy during late lunch and dinner. This buffet offers a deal to Taxi drivers, so add extra time to your expected dinner as there are always a large group coming through. Be a member of the player's club to get a few dollars off.

The food is mostly hot but I'm not sure how often it gets swapped out for fresh food, so I only eat what looks popular to try to ensure some sort of freshness. If you are on a budget and want to take a few friends out to a buffet, try this one at Palace Station.",r5ggPC6OccLk6dDl5yqsJQ,2,1,2,P6OQ0V7cqca860Cp4ht4Bg

It is on the smaller side for a buffet offering up your standard buffet fare. I would compare it more to your local Hometown Buffet than an extravagant Vegas-style buffet. I will say, however, that their meat was on point! I had the turkey and it was so moist and delicious. Others in our party raved about their roast beef as well. Also, the mac and cheese was super yummy (yes, I have the pallet of a 6 year old...).

The service was really good as well. We had a party of 17 people and our waitress didn't write down our drink orders but brought them all out exactly as we had ordered them! We were all really impressed. My only complaint about the service would be that they didn't clear plates quickly enough. We always had one or two plates in the middle of the table and people just started stacking their new plates on top of their old ones.

The best part about the buffet? The price! It's typically only $15  (you get what you pay for, right?) BUT, if you sign up for their member points card (which you can do for free) it knocks the price down to $8 a person.",NrSURtBigpxbdfL4nGB-Jg,2,0,3,lS3PhbWzsjTOtFVy6r_L2w

Even when they brought out fresh items to replace, they were just plopped on top of the older food. The dessert station was ok. I thought it was smart to do small desserts. However it was kind of a turn off at the server throwing them around on the sheet tray, and if one fell (which there were two) on the floor, it was an ""oh well"" attitude.

Buffets require premeditated planning in order to not regret them afterwards as you lay on your bed or keeled over feeling as if you are ready to bust.

My son and I go to Vegas about 4 times a year, and we have tried other buffets.  Now we just automatically just come here.  One of the reasons why?  Some places, after you eat, for the rest of the day, you are super thirsty and keep drinking gallons of water.   Now I'm assuming it's due to the salt content/msg use.  Either way, hate hate hate that feeling.  Never get that here.

I gave it 5 Stars because for a $7.99 dinner price buffet (If you go over and get the FREE Station Rewards Card-- which you SHOULD/MUST), it exceeded my expectations in these areas: 
1) Variety of Food: For Sat. Night dinner, it has an Asian Station, a Mexican Taco Station, a Carving Station with beef, turkey, sausage, a made to order pasta station, salad stations on both sides, comfort foods throughout, (pizza, hot dogs, hamburgers, etc.), a HUGE dessert station with tons of choices, and a soft-serve machine that also dispenses sorbet.
2) Quality and Tastiness of Food: Next to the pasta station, the pre-made penne was crazy yummy, the Mac 'n cheese was delicious, the grilled fish was terrific, the popcorn shrimp was great, the three kinds of soups were tasty, the fried chicken was fresh and hot. The desserts, especially the pies, were also terrific (SO MANY choices!)
3) The Decor/Service/Wait Time. We arrived on a holiday weekend Saturday at peak dinner time window with very little wait time, and choice of booth or table. The cashiers, hostesses, and our server, Sonia, were all very professional. The decor and tables were lovely.
4) Value - This is where the 5 Stars was really earned! It's a $7.99 buffet, folks! Remember when MOST LV buffets were this ridiculously inexpensive? This is a last of a dying breed... And so very worth it!
Look to your right, it's a one ""$"" for the price point, but not for its quality and amenities.
Come here if you want the budget, you're gonna get way more than you paid for experience. Go elsewhere if you want the decadent, overwhelming, (overpriced) Vegas buffet experience.

The shame wasn't as bad as I thought it would be.  When we got to the top, we were greeted by friendly staff and ushered right in.  It was lunch time and the price with the boarding pass was like $6.00.  This buffet is tiny so if you're used to the other Feast buffets at Station Casinos, you'll be immediately disappointed.   While the selections were limited, the food they did have was decent and hot and for 6 bucks thats all I can ask for...........well and a soft serve ice cream machine, which they also had.  Highlights were probably the mac & cheese (I love terrible buffet style mac & cheese), fried chicken (surprisingly tender) and roast beef from the carving station (I know, a carving station at a 6 dollar buffet, gotta love Vegas).

So I use to work concierge for Palace Station and had got to work early so I decided to breakfast at their buffet.

So I went for breakfast at like 7am so food should be fresh and delicious I'm thinking it should be. I tried their nasty watery runny eggs omg I almost threw up! 

I also tried their extra crispy burned bacon I think it cut my throat going down! So last and just as least as the other items I tried their oatmeal because I figured how can you mess up oatmeal well Palace Station was successful at messing that up to! 

I think I would of had a better dining experience eating out of their dumpster! Yes it was extremely cheap in price but come on I don't expect to go to a Station Casino and eat dog food!

3761757,2018-02-05,0,k-dDZvTeLysoJvjHI-qr9g,"""The Adventure Continues.""

We'll start this review as we're standing in line waiting to be seated. We paid $20.00 for our meals which is nice. Being seated went by quick. We were told we would be seated as soon as a table would be available. Now we were told as soon as a table would be available, but half the dining room was empty. Table availability or just understaffed?

Food was par for the course as far as buffets in Las Vegas go. Plain and simple some are better as others. The salads we created were ok.  Fran, my wife, had a cherseburger and a tamales. Both were fine, but the tamale was small in size.

I had a few soft tacos with rice pilaf. Taco meat was average at best. Rice pilaf was bland. I then had a slice of turkey, green beans, mashed potatoes without gravy and cornbread. Again average as far as buffets in Las Vegas go. One item I felt was better than average, the corbread. I had four of them in all.

For dessert Fran had German chocolate cake and carrot cake.  According to her both were pretty dry to the taste.

I had ice cream, and a red velvet cupcake. The cupcake is so small it only takes one or two bites before it's gone.

The buffet itself is small in size. I felt cramped waiting in line for a table. I would imagine at night during dinner the place to be crowded as well. The serving area is small and easily crowded.  As I write this review Palace Station is undergoing a large renovation process.  Hopefully Feast Buffet will be expanded on.

In closing I would like to add that I used to work for Station Casinos in the Wildfire devision. One of the service standards is to ""Let them hear you smile."" Seems all but one person forgot how to do this.  Another service standard is called the ""10-5 Rule"".  If you are within 10 feet of a person, smile. If you are within 5 feet of a person,  say hello, at least acknowledge the person you are close to. A person who looked to be management forgot how to do this. How about the ""Fond Farewell"" standard? Pretty self explanatory to me. Not to the cashiers as we were leaving, except for the same staff member mentioned earlier. Everyone else was talking among themselves.

Okay I've rambled on enough. You all have a nice day. As a pastor and dear friend of mine says, ""The Adventure Continues.""",S156HzsEW-BjCfzu0xLe9A,0,0,3,fLcTRn_bMsgLpjfOBfkQoA

Just don't do it.  Even if you go in with low expectations, even if the price beckons to you and you're rationalizing, what do I have to lose?

Actually the best thing I had was the stuffed salmon. Fairly fresh and not overcooked! Everything else was generally pretty good. At least 3/4 of it, if served as an individual dish at a restaurant, I would've given 4 stars. Especially for the price!

As everyone says, sign up for the boarding pass before-hand! You get a lower rate for the meal, and if you activate your card by playing one of their free games (1st time only). You get something between $1-10 on your card that you can immediately spend on your buffet.

2) I had a comp for a free buffet that was due to expire by the weekend

I'm really not too picky about buffets in general because:

1) I'm a cheap eater...lots makes me happy
2) I eat at Chinese buffets!  An iron stomach comes in handy

But the Feast Buffet in Palace Station?  Meh.  MEH!  I really have had better.  The only saving grace for this place is the near extreme cheap prices for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  If you go for dinner it's less than $9 before tax!  If your budget is in a recession and you want choices (or you're a UNLV undergrad on a date and want to impress with quantity) than come visit here.  If you're looking for quality...ah, you might want to saunter somewhere else.

I had eaten at the Feast Buffet several years back and I just don't remember it.  It wasn't good, but I don't remember it being bad.  It's just very lackluster.  I'm sure when O.J. Simpson stayed here pre-arrest he probably ate here.  If I came that day, I probably would have given this place another star.  Yeah, some food, and possibly a signed football from one of the greats?  Sure.  Of course this all depends if I had a football on me that day.

This Feast Buffet is typical as those of all the other Station Casinos in town, with one major caveat - SIZE.  Yes, unfortunately in this case size does matter.  This buffet is like only 1/3 the size of the rest of them!  I've seen more choices (and fresher choices) at the local Golden Corral!  It's just sad.  So sad.  It's like Palace Station is the bastard child of Station Casinos.  Nothing about this place screams gourmet.  No sushi (even faux sushi), no real Asian section either.  Pot stickers (badly cooked ones), and fried egg rolls DO NOT make up an Asian section.  The Feast Buffet at Palace Station is heavy on American and Mexican fare.  

Though to their credit they do include an Italian build-your-own pasta section, where the cook will make you any basic pasta dish you like with you choice of veggies, meats, and sauces (LOL...red, or white..seriously).  That is not bad as long as the chef cooks your pasta right.  Luckily my Fettuccine Alfredo with shrimp was hard to mess up.  Only complaint was that the sauce was too heavy with not enough cheese.

The rest of this buffet was really kinda just under average.  The carving section with meats was OK, the only standout to me was the carnitas which were tender.  You can also have a cheeseburger done on the grill, just demand that you get a fresh patty thrown on and not one that sits on the side in a container of grease.  Yuck. 

The salad bar was way under par, not only was it messy at the time, but a lot of the veggies didn't look freshly prepared.  Lots of canned stuff.  Color me not impressed.

Don't even get me started on the dessert section.  What a shame!  It's like a tiny island in the middle of nowhere.  And the desserts STINK.  Basic cakes and pies, that really don't look all that appetizing.  What...no gelato?  Only soft serve available and it was no bueno.  

The Feast Buffet here (as well as possibly the majority of Palace Station) needs some serious renovating.  I would gladly pay a dollar more for the buffet if it was vastly improved.  It needs some serious help.  Until then I probably won't be back.  Unless I get another comp that needs to be used on a Monday - Thursday.",QCtHk02W_Asu2LFfdmGQDA,5,0,2,IkNJfzwky5gAXYKURUgfhA

The breakfast is solid. Well, let me take that back. I guess the only food worth eating is the omelette. Made right before your eyes to your liking. The cook can also make eggs and melt cheese over them: delicious! 

Aside from the omelette, they serve donuts and the usual: eggs, potatoes, bacon, sausage, ham. They also serve tacos, menudo, fresh fruit. Desserts and other pastries are definitely not good here.

Now, it's not as ""fancy"" as Red Rock or Green Valley Ranch, but it's cheap and a remarkably good value. I'm also happy to report that my purchase of this buffet did not come with a free ride on the diarrhea express (I'm looking at you, Sunset Station). 

The food is simple and not fussy. The buffet is tiny but there's a good salad bar, pizza, Chinese food that's comparable to Panda Express, some okay Mexican options (but really tasty chicken fajitas -- go figure), and the usual suspects like mac and cheese, mashed potatoes, fried shrimp and a made-to-order pasta station. There aren't a lot of green vegetables on offer here so veggie lovers like me will want to load up on salad. I was shocked at the quality and variety of meats at their carving station. During our visit they had really good roast beef, turkey, ham and fresh salmon! I know they switch up the selections but I felt like I hit the buffet jackpot. The desserts are good too, and there are several sugar free options. 

If you have a Stations Casinos dining coupon / offer, this is a great place to spend it. You get the most bang for your buck here since the buffet is so inexpensive. The two of us had a $30 free comp and we got two dinner buffets and a bottle of wine and still had comp money left over. Now calm down, their wine selections are about what you'd expect. We slummed it with a bottle of Beringer white zinfandel and it brought back nostalgic memories of my college days. Even if you don't plan to gamble one penny in the casino, sign up for the free Stations players card and they'll knock a couple of bucks off the price of your buffet if you show it when you pay.

It seems like it would be a good idea, however the set up lacks a place to actually put in an order, being that there is glass up and all around. If you are of average height you either have to bend down or tip toe over the glass to be heard.

Scrambled egg dishes (with or without cheese, mixed with sausage or veggies) were consistently over-cooked, rubbery and about what you'd expect from a typical cafeteria serving large crowds. Hashbrowns  were likely pan-fried from bags of frozen, shredded potatoes, often with clumps of salt on top due to uneven application of seasoning. Bacon was usually crispy. Sausages were bland and mealy. Most of the diners enjoyed the Eggs Benedict offerings, but only if they were fresh from the kitchen. I thought the Mexican station's items were decent, though surprisingly bland. Cinnamon buns were acceptable. Orange and Grapefruit juices tasted like watered-down fruit punch. Coffee was mediocre. All diners agreed that the breakfast pizza was awful. Pancakes were dry and inedible. Waffles were okay. Doughnuts were mediocre. Hand-carved ham was decent.

For a quick, no-frills breakfast with excellent (and always friendly) service at a low price, it's a win. It will not please those who are in the mood for well-prepared food made with love by passionate chefs.",0Ilj96ljGwczPpEjyoSFuw,0,0,3,jrcjQ9Ky6o3S4LxA-uIJXQ

My fiance and I also play MyVegas for complimentary rewards and discounts so we also had a voucher for a BOGO deal. Upon signing up for their Stations Boarding Pass we were also told that as new members we would get the chance to ""Crack The Vault"" and win a random amount of points (every 1000 points = $1). It's also pretty neat that you can use those points not only for games, but you can use it towards your meal as well. Score! The buffet at Palace Station is located upstairs. On a Sunday afternoon, there was about a 25-30 minute wait. With the BOGO discount and points we won from the promotion we only paid $5.25 or so for two people (brunch). There was not a huge variety, there was some good food but most of the entrees were bland. The prime rib looked good and juicy but was actually pretty dry. Do not even attempt to eat the chicken fried steak or french toast. I was disappointed in the dessert station and didn't try anything as nothing appealed to me. My fiance was not fond of the chicken noodle soup, he much prefers the soup at the Mirage the day prior. I liked that they had mini beef tamales, not bad at all in my opinion. The omelet station was good as well, the first time I walked by there was a small line of approximately 3-4 people. I decided to give it a try and there was only one person before me. Cook was nice and the omelet was delicious. I was actually sad I didn't eat the omelet first and could not enjoy it as much so late in the meal. They have a section for the dry cereal, but I think it would be more accommodating to the customer if there was milk available near by so that you would not need to get a hold of your server.

The Feast Buffet located in the Palace Station Hotel & Casino is very affordable for those looking not to spend a lot of money for an AYCE.  Here's my 2 cents on my mealtimes, in chronological order-

Lunch - A step-down from your local Hometown Buffet.  There is a grill where diners can ask for slices of roast beef/turkey, burgers, hot dogs & brats.  Located next to it, is a pasta station where pasta is made to order with whatever choice ingredients the diner desires.  The rest of the hot/cold foods were decent, but nothing extraordinary.  The dessert section was nice w/ various cakes, cookies, sweets and the obligatory nonfat froyo machines.  Overall, meh.

Dinner - See lunch, but w/ a few extra items scattered hither & thither.  Not worth the extra cost, IMHO.

Breakfast -  Now we're talking!  Several egg dishes, mounds of bacon, biscuits & gravy, country fried steak etc.  There is also an omelette station where diners can have an omelette their way.  The dessert section had most of the same items from lunch/dinner, plus various doughnuts and other items.  

The Feast Buffet is an affordable, no-frills buffet.  I recommend breakfast over lunch & dinner for those interested in checking this buffet out.  I had free buffet vouchers, but if I had to pay, I would stick to breakfast.

Noteworthy last night was the salmon... Really good! There was also roast beef, ham, and all the usual buffet staples. 

Based on dinner, I'd have gone five stars, but breakfast was a bit disappointing, primarily because of the actions of their ""egg nazi"". 

We arrived 45 minutes before the switch from breakfast to lunch, but had to wait 40 minutes on line to get in. I got a plate and went to the 'eggs to order' station, where the cook was doing a couple of omelets. As I got ready to order, though, I was stopped by a guy in a black uniform marked "" Assistant Room Chef"", who told me ""Omelette station is closed at 11"". I looked at my phone. 11:02. I told him we'd been waiting 45 minutes, pointed out the cook was still doing eggs and I only wanted a fried egg. No budging him. "" No eggs for you!""

The only eggs on the breakfast station were old and dried up scrambled eggs, so it was an eggless breakfast. There was also no bacon left, and very little other breakfast food.

 I understand they have a changeover time, but if they are still selling breakfast at 11 there should still be breakfast food available at 11.

""Oh, here it is"", I smiled at the cashier, handing her to the card.  She looked the height of annoyed at me and said ""I've already rung it up"", as she processed the last of my credit card.  Did she cancel the order?  Oh, heavens no!  That would take what, 2-3 button presses to adjust?  Don't want to tire out the fragile lamb.  Did I mention that there was no one behind me, so she would have had more than enough time to adjust my order?  It wasn't happening, and she let me know it.

The ""Feast"" is more like a ""Fe"".  It's small.  Surprisingly so.  I've been to small buffets, but the selection was really limited.  But it's the food that matters, right?

I found a old tyme Vegas casino right out of the 80's....dingy...brought back unpleasant memories from the past....but lets leave nostalgia alone and move to the buffet, as expected it was crowded, the decor brought more unneeded memories from the 80's (stop it)
The buffet selection itself its quite small compared to other Station buffets and I expected the food to be worst (how can it be?, that is an impossibility) but I do have to admit that all in all, and in comparison it was not that bad (or maybe I was just hungry, who knows) and I did find a few things to nibble on, had some cat fish (not bad) mussels (most were empty) a piece of fried chicken (overly salted), tried a some dessert, it was old and dry.
All in all, and compared to some of  the fancier Feast buffets it was not the worst, and that is not an insult my friends!!

I went to the egg station where I witnessed the egg cook make dozens of mistakes and discarded half a dozen eggs. After what felt like twenty minutes with three other people in front of me, I asked for poached eggs but the cook told me they didn't have an egg poacher and offered me steam eggs instead.  A few minutes later, I received two runny undercooked steamed eggs.  I should have known this cook didn't know how to cook eggs since he kept asking the customers if the eggs looked cooked enough before he took them off the stove. 

Most of the food were borderline edible and just plain bad.  The only things I liked here were their desserts (lemon meringue, cheese danish, etc.).  It's just a shame that the people who run this buffet doesn't care or know what good food is.  It also appears that the staff is overworked.  For example, there should have been two egg cooks.

Lunch and brunch fits better with much more different foods & the carving station has many more choices of meats, and throughout there are more different choices Of deliciousness, with a few hits and misses. Tater tots was one of the biggest hits, as as soon as it was served hot it would vanish and they would have to bring out more where it would vanish again. Same thing for any of the hot pizzas, especially if there were little ones in the dining room, as they would take multiple slices to the table.   The omelette station becomes a pasta station for lunch & dinner.  the carving station in addition to its offerings can grill you your burger, dogs, sausage, roast chicken half, or even add cheese & grill your onion rounds on request!!! One serious miss from lunch to dinner was this one I will call Dead Greek pasta salad, as this salad has a pasta that had died years ago... The pasta was simply dried out and dead of flavor whatsoever... None of the feta, tomato or spices could penetrate that pasta. They kept serving it daily to get rid of it or are displaying it daily like a viewing of a corpse! 

Sunday brunch was also Mimosa day and many times the mimosas kept flowing, but remember many of the servers wouldn't offer it... You would have to ask for it and when you did they would bring it and bring it and bring it is long as you kept asking for it.

Many nights dinner was a theme night, which made dinner different from lunch, yet there were some dinner foods that were the same as lunch. There  would always be classics, like fried chicken, mashed potatoes, burgers, hot dogs, pizza, salads things like that regardless of theme and the one item I rate most buffets on... And it hold true every time; THEIR STUFFING!  At one time it used to be a wet, kinda gooey mess, but now it's a nice, homemade style stuffing chopped bread stuffing that is very nice.  

WARNING....
Like most buffets, turkey served in buffets is white meat heaven.  Dark meat consists of usually only the leg.  Asking for dark meat sometimes means they give you the whole leg!  Be prepared for that fact... And be hungry

Desserts were typical pre made but many were different from the ones they had from previous stays even 3 months prior!  Many more lighter fare, doughnut holes, jellos & a way bigger sugar free dessert area.  They also added sugar free sherbets along with the frozen yogurt offerings. I had the raspberry (very sweet) & fresh peach (very good!!!!).  Fresh fruit was available too.

Service is great for the most part, even exceptional but every once in a while you get a crabby patty... You will get service, but not the great service Palace Station is known for (they really do treat you like a local friend!).  Come early cause it can & does get crowded & join their rewards club for a discount & comp'ed meals with play. Handicapped guests have their own line with their party.  

My review is for a 4 day stay, 4 different meal services (breakfast, lunch, Sunday brunch & dinner) & 1 dead salad.  
FYI: They only offer Tabasco for hot sauce
Review score was more a 3.9 but they are really trying....
Please give that salad a decent burial in the desert somewhere.... Please!!!",WtYP4xSdi_4XmYHlnYRvag,1,0,4,mK3BDdCLmJg0eRhiWbNuSg
