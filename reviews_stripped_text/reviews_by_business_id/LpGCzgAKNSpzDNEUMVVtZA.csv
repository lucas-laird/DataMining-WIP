142662,2011-03-26,1,LpGCzgAKNSpzDNEUMVVtZA,"Oh my goodness - I just discovered true Pizza Nirvana!!!

Hubby and I and the son went there for dinner tonight - it was my first time there.  Had a very nice and knowledgable server named Colin.  He really added to the experience.

But let's discuss the food first...

The pizza nirvana comes from a coal fired oven and the ingredients all come from the same supplier that provides the ingredients for the original Grimaldi's under the Brooklyn Bridge.  We each order a personal sized pizza - I was thinking it would be the size of a ""normal"" personal pizza or I would have definitely shared - a personal sized pizza is the same size as a medium anywhere else.  (I am already craving the leftover pie that is sitting on my counter right now)..

Hubby got a pizza with sausage ($11 for a heavenly 6 slice pie).  I ordered a white pizza with fresh garlic, basil and tomatoes ($14).  Our son ordered a personal cheese pizza ($9).  We all shared a personal sized caesar salad ($6) - which was huge - more than enough to share - it was very delicious and the croutons were baked in the coal fired oven which added a nice balance)!

I bit into my first slice and experienced pure bliss.  Perfectly thin with a great chew and a nice char.  It was charred - not burnt!  So hard to find that here.  This pizza is as close to perfect as I have ever had (but I have not been able to experience real New York pizza yet ).

Colin was great - very knowledgeable without being annoying.  He was very friendly and proud of the food he served.  Everyone we came across working there were also very nice.

I also had a great glass of fresh brewed iced tea (something that is getting harder and harder to find here) - Very refreshing.

We were going to say no to dessert but Colin twisted our arm and we shared a slice of cheesecake ($5) - I am so glad he did.  I normally do not like cheesecake very much - but it was velvet bliss.

Our bill came to under $60.00 with a whole pizza that was left to take home with us.  We will definitely be back in the very near future.",WD8jE11b1jaXaGgrMM-gnQ,3,1,5,FfAKPmjR-my_02lqI8cHcg

The only downside is that they charge quite a bit (1-3$) for every single topping you get.. whether it's on half the pizza or the whole thing. I really like variety so getting chicken, sun dried tomatoes, peppers, and mushrooms on our pizza cost and extra 11$!! That seems just a bit ridiculous seeing as the amount if each topping they put on wasn't anything special! Some slices had no chicken, or just no peppers, very inconsistent. If you're going to charge 3$ EXTRA for chicken or tomatoes, then you should put a good amount on!",AZ8_bPqh1kMMdFO6hR09YQ,0,0,3,wQS-y4sPJDM6oRWvK30IBQ
398867,2011-10-08,0,LpGCzgAKNSpzDNEUMVVtZA,"New York PIzza style in Las Vegas.  There are five locations in the Vegas area and we went to this one.

Ordered a medium with mushroom and sausage.  The crust was good.  Isn't it all about the crust anyway?  Nice flavor and texture.  Sauce was very neutral.  No real acid, sweetness, or herbaciousness.   That's either good or bad meaning they probably do not add much to the sauce and just let is speak for itself.  Topping were sparse and slices of mozzarella was used so it was not as evenly distributed as if it were shredded, of course the cheese they use is probably so soft you couldn't shred it.

Grimaldi's Pizza is a lot better than the major pizza chains.  When you start comparing it to single shops or local favorites it all comes down to personal taste.   Grimaldi's appears to be expanding nationally, hopefully not at the expense of taste and quality.",8HSPqescPcwOmQ6sQ3-TTg,0,0,4,YQbmC1GK1pwZAmHvWtBr0A

I mean who plays jazz anymore,  especially not the sweet voice of Madelaine Peyroux. But I digress, we were greated by a smiling young man who sat us and gave us the run down. He returned my playful banter and left us in the hands of our server, Cristiana. Another pleasant human, she suggested a wine and took our order.  The antipasto we shared was delicious, we finished 1 more sip of wine (a phenomenal pairing with the food) and the sweet server brought out our pizza, also crazy good!

The place is clean, things were pleasant. Food presentation was fast and nice. The caprese was served with just underripe beefsteak tomato. The balsamic was ordinary, at best. 

The biggest disappointment was the pizza. It's rated one of the best in Vegas, and I'd like to meet the people who voted on this and ask them what in the world they were thinking. It's far, FAR from some of the best I've had in life. 

Don't get me wrong, the pie was ok. Barely. The old adage rings true: if it's good, it's great... But I'd say the pie was just south of mediocre. The crust was the best part and it needed another dollop of sauce. The biggest travesty is they charge a fixed price for toppings regardless of the size of the pie. So, I got a personal pie (12"") and paid the same price for my ham and mushrooms that a large pie (18"") pays. Sorry, but that's just not right. 

To Dan's credit, he just listened to my bitching and didn't take one side or other. Next time I'm in Vegas and looking for a pizza on the way out of town I'm headed to Metro Pizza like I should've done tonight.",1fYZjVh3OFbpKtlxKsj0cw,1,2,3,aUxM_nFMLOmATf0zYmsAQQ

827903,2015-06-28,0,LpGCzgAKNSpzDNEUMVVtZA,"My first Grimaldi's experience was about 7 or 8 years ago, at the first Las Vegas location on Eastern. We would drove over there just for Grimaldi's or find a reason to go to Trader Joe's and then happen to pass by Grimaldi's. 

From the First Bite on Day One, it was the intrigue of the soft creamy mounds ricotta as a topping that hooked me! I had already tasted some of the great New York pies, I.e., Patsy's, Totonno's and some of the emerging California greats such as Delphina in San Francisco. 

Grimaldi's arrival elevated the then lackluster, subpar pizza scene in Las Vegas. Though I would gladly take a bite or more from a pizza from Mozza (LA), John's (NY) or Chez Panisse (Berkeley,  CA) any day,  having Grimaldi's nearby on Rainbow is a comforting thought! 

With curbside pickup, Grimaldi's on Rainbow can't be beat! Tonight's spicy chicken sausage provided a nice kick and counter part to the standard ricotta. Yum!",R99D31A4rVc3rThA0tGh4A,0,0,5,l65DG23NQBwtWT60FGP6oA

There were four slices of salami and four slices of mozzarella cheese with some olives and marinated red pepper. 

After, I ordered a white garlic pizza w/ spinach, Italian sausage, black olives & basil. It looked great when it came out but it had zero flavor. I'm not sure if the white garlic sauce was even on the pizza.

851210,2011-10-17,0,LpGCzgAKNSpzDNEUMVVtZA,"People screw up pizza a LOT. Seriously, I just don't think anyone even realizes how many ways people get it wrong. As the stars probably gave away, I feel Grimaldi's is different. 

The ingredients are fresh and put on the pizzas in that wonderful sweet spot of being plentiful but not overcrowded. The sauce isn't drowning everything, nor is it barely there. The crust is thin, crispy and actually manages to not be either overpowering or taste like lifeless cardboard. 

Let me put this another way. A lot of people in this city claim to have New York style pizza. Grimaldi's actually does. Not only that, but the interior makes it plainly obvious that whoever designed it has actually been to the east coast at some point, unlike most places that overdo it and try to shove east coast culture down your throat in the design in order to make you think that's what it looks like. 

Sorry...I'm a Jersey native. It drives me nuts the way so many restaurants get it all wrong, be it food or design or usually both. Grimaldi's makes me actually think of home and the little pizza restaurants you'd find there. It looks like it, it tastes like it. If you want GOOD New York style pizza, go here.

but I DO occasionally enjoy your New York style crust.  After getting recommendations from friends that visited the original ""under the Brooklyn bridge"" location we had to try it.  

Starters:
Salads are good. Nothing to rave about but a nice starter. Both the house and Caesar are well tossed with crisp lettuce and not drowned in dressing. If your a  Caprese salad fan, this is a good choice as well, with healthy slices of buffalo moz  and fresh tomatoes drizzled with the right amount of oil and vinegar.
PIZZA:
I LOVE PIZZA! and I LOVE GRIMALDI's.  bold words coming from a Chicago native...
We have tried all of the sauces (red, white with garlic, and pesto) and although they are all delicious, I just love the standard red sauce.  Top it with Pepperoni (old world style full of flavor), mushrooms, and roasted sweet red peppers (peppers are roasted in house! and has a perfect blend of sweet to compliment the saltiness of the pepperoni). Instead of  large try ordering two personal pizza (one red and one white or pesto) to get a good variety! it's still a lot of pizza for 2 despite it's name of ""personal"", this isn't your airport pizza hut to-go personal portion!

We always do red with the above mentioned ingredients and a white pizza with sausage!

I love that they put fresh basil in the middle for that added little smack of flavor in your first bite!

Desert:
In house made Cheesecake? YES PLEASE! I love the classic new york style with raspberry drizzle! (i've heard the turtle cheesecake is FTW also). Delicious and creamy, i think i heard angels sing as i took my first bite (maybe sounded like a combination of fergie and Jesus! Step bros anyone?) We asked why it was so good, they said they use sour cream in it. Really? that's it? no tears from a unicorn? no bottled baby's laughter? ok...

Price is a little high for a casual pizza but you get what you pay for. $10 for a cardboard ketchup pizza from your local chain? or spend $23 on a pizza that you won't forget.

Service is usually good, no complaints.  

One thing is, i recommend to eat in! Since the pizza is thin, you lose the crispness of the crust and it tends to get cold quick! so you better live less than 5 minutes away if your carrying out..

It tasted ok with salt, hot pepper, and parmesan, but when was the last time you added salt to a pizza? It was a first for me. 

I always rate a pizza place by their cheese pizza.(Yes, I am an East Coast transplant.) After all, you put enough toppings on, and even cardboard tastes good. I doubt that I will be returning, despite the friendly server.",WgS24X_UKhJ4Ub1JSSLNFw,0,0,3,Ye0nm7LWAJGqGEzxACkLcQ

Actually, the hostess was even exceptionally kind and really set the tone for our dinner. Service is really the reason why this review is 4 stars. 

The pizza is okay. Entirely too crunchy to be the NY style pizza that I love, that they claim to be. We actually looked up if Grimaldis actually started in NY because the menu doesn't show a NY location but there is NYC decor all over. This pizza would be so much better if it wasn't so crispy. But, perhaps that's just me. We also ordered the house salad...which could have used some cheese and croutons... but I get that it's different - just persona preference. Our server had no problem bringing us some croutons on the side. 

The atmosphere is very Italian-y...cozy and enjoyable. The lighting is quite dim and the music plays softly. There's one or two tvs by the bar to enjoy as well. Their outdoor section was open during our visit, but it was too cold for me to enjoy it, ha! They do have heaters out there though. 

There's a nice selection of wines, some beers, and a page of specialty cocktails. As far as food goes... you pretty much are limited to pizza and salad. Pretty straight to the point kind of place, which I can appreciate.

1523978,2016-01-28,3,LpGCzgAKNSpzDNEUMVVtZA,"I was extremely disappointed in this place!  I went one time previously and remembered it was ok, but after this last visit, I will not go back.

Their menu is extremely limited, so basically it's pizza, calzones & salad; that's it.  I am lactose intolerant, so I ordered a pizza with no cheese and mushrooms.  It was a personal pizza and all toppings are an additional $2-5, so my pizza was almost $14 (which I thought was pricey especially since it's very thin crust).  Now, I know you're thinking, how good can a pizza be without cheese?  Well, Settebello makes amazing cheese- less pizzas.  

The amount of sauce on my pizza was absolutely ridiculous (way too much) & the bottom was burned.  It was awful; I would have rather eaten at Papa John's.  The other people with me, ordered 'normal' pizzas, and not one of them mentioned how great they thought it was.

The other thing that pissed me off was I ordered coffee.  They only serve Americano or Espresso, so I ordered the Americano.  It was in a tiny cup and was very average, expensive and NO refills.  Ok, how does an Italian joint not serve just plain coffee?????  I will order coffee at the most random restaurants and they have it & it's usually decent.

I would NOT go back & it's pricey.  Save yourself the disappointment and go to Settebello!  Oh, and on a side note, I would have selected '0' stars if that were an option.",H2PcFJ2tswZLKY4tadK6_Q,4,3,1,1MmlcudWmiRrG9JDjZ0Ugg
1548641,2014-03-07,0,LpGCzgAKNSpzDNEUMVVtZA,"First trip to Grimaldi's brick oven pizza. I knew it was a pizza place but other than that did not know what to expect. Just by the name I knew I would like it because I love oven baked crust. The crunch and the thinness, pure heaven. Went with 2 girlfriends from my old job. We were out celebrating our leaving the company and moving on to better things. 

Now when I say I am not a pizza fan I mean I don't like pizza because of the tomato based sauce that everyone smothers on their pizzas and ruins the taste. I fell in love with pizza again when I was in Italy for 4 weeks. One of my girlfriends is a vegetarian and she had eaten there a few times so we let her pick out lunch. We ordered the large, pesto mozzarella, with ricotta cheese and pepperoni on half for us meat eaters. We also ordered the spinach salad with red onions, blue cheese crumbles, and a sweet balsamic vinaigrette. It was way more then enough food for three people with some to take home. 

The waitress was very attentive. When my drink glass was half empty she would bring a new one. She was busy with other guest but still managed to make it to our table at least 4 times in our hour lunch. I think that is more than enough times to check on your guests if u see they are doing well. 

I will definitely go again. Great service, great atmosphere, great company and  best of all GREAT PIZZA!",SM96w5Sh1emA0VQkXKmU8Q,0,0,5,yG7MDYaWlQ41WkOr3oqkGQ
1566531,2011-11-12,0,LpGCzgAKNSpzDNEUMVVtZA,"Definitely a great place to go get pizza! :) I'm usually not big on having pizza all the time, but for some reason, after coming to this place, it practically became a place for indulgence for our family. Many other reviewers have probably already mentioned, but THIS is where you can get authentic New York style pizza, and I won't lie to you on that one.

If it's your first time, though, then there are two things:

First, I don't recommend getting more than you need and/or getting it to-go unless you're going to eat it within the next ten minutes. Although very delicious, the thin crusted pizza they make can become more crunchy than needed and they don't honestly make great leftovers. So, eat only enough, and eat what you can, and fast; this pizza is not very fantastic once it's not warm anymore, and reheating it can sometimes make it taste worse. I mean, it's really up to you, but our family agreed upon this.

Second, I also don't recommend getting more than three or four toppings on a single pizza, especially if it's not going to be a large that you're ordering. I'm a bit picky on sauce, as I like a good, helpful amount. Unless you ask for extra, it may be a bit too dry for your taste if you're like me. And also, because it's a pretty thin pizza, too many toppings can probably result in a soggy, heavy pizza that you'll have to bring to your plate. But again, just a matter of opinion.

Whenever we come here, we usually get a large pizza with mushrooms, onions, and most importantly, Ricotta cheese. Occasionally, we consider on sausage, but usually we only go with three toppings unless we're feeling generous on a serving of meat. I really recommend getting some Ricotta cheese on pizza here; it's absolutely delicious, and makes for a great, creamy taste. We love onions because it adds a little more flavor. The sausage is, again, for when we feel we want more meat. But mushrooms are mostly just there, though I do enjoy the simple taste of some mushroom slices on a pizza.

All in all, it's great to come here to experiment. We like to stick to the same thing because we enjoy what they give us, and we seem to have the combination of toppings that we know we like.

Oh! Also, don't eat too much, especially if you want to save some room for dessert! Their cheesecakes are fantastic, and there are at least two seasonal types that you don't want to miss once they're gone until the next year!

Grimaldi's is fantastic! :) Eat with a group, or eat by yourself; it's great either way!",IWQkdTTn9FslPeSiih2l2Q,0,0,4,rihLlzgYVXFIlqE-p0VJEw

They definitely can make a pizza. I love the thin crust, the mozzarella is always fresh, and the small pepperoni are my favorite. The coal brick oven gives the pizza a unique, toasty flavor...yum! Their salads are pretty good too, a small order works well for 2 people. Pizza is definitely on the pricier side, especially with extra toppings but the taste is worth it. The pizza alone would give this place 5 stars, but I had to give 3 just because of service. Service is the other half of the dining out experience. Each time I have come here I have not received anything over mediocre service. I have never been here when each table was full, or even close to it. The server is always slow in greeting us when we sit. And I have never had my water refilled without asking. In all fairness, the other Grimaldi's locations in the valley that I have been to have all had the same problems with service.

I thought they would have some inside or at least a container for dipping.  Definately needed pizza sauce.  

I thought the Anti Pasto was a salad and not just an asortment of the ingredients.  I saw another review after the fact saying you can get greens and dressing with it, which would have been more to my liking.  The ingredients alone werent bad, just not what I expected or really wanted.  

The atmosphere of the restaurant was kind of odd.  Like it didnt know if it was supposed to be nice or just basic and focus on the food.  With a menu consisting of only pizza, calzone and salad, I would expect not a lot of frills.  The decor tried to be fancy just like the servers uniforms/aprons, but the tables were covered in the old fashion red checker patern table cloth (more in line with the menu).

1745549,2017-02-12,4,LpGCzgAKNSpzDNEUMVVtZA,"In honor of National Pizza Day, I figured it was high time to review my favorite pizza spot. Came here back in October with Randall S. There's many locations around the city (I like the one in the fashion show mall) but we happened to be on his side of town that night. We decided to call-in our order because it was a super cold and windy night. Netflix kind of night.

If you're in a rush, Grimaldi's isn't for you. There's usually a substantial wait for your pizza whether you dine-in or not. But this pizza is worth the wait. Its totally authentic and made in a coal brick-oven. With handmade mozzarella, secret recipe dough and pizza sauce. It's just how you imagined pizza from New York would taste. On one occasion we dined in @ fashion show with his sons. To keep them occupied, our server gave them a piece of dough and small pizza tray for them to play with while we waited for the food. His sons loved kneading the dough like mini pizza makers. Being a mommy myself, I thought that was a great idea. 

On this particular night, we ordered The Don & a large Caesar Salad. Added some extra toppings to our pizza. My tip, don't go too crazy with the toppings because it gets pretty pricey. It's all fun and games until the bills come out lol. 

Would've given 5 stars but as we walked back to the car, we noticed signage for ""curbside service"". We were annoyed since it was such a cold night, we thought it would've been the perfect time to take advantage. But the woman taking our phone order never mentioned this service to us.

I have been here multiple times for dine in and take out.  Everyone is friendly.  The last few times I have been disappointed with the take out.  This is a thin crust pizza that is best right out of the oven.  I can make it to my house in under 10 minutes and the pizza always loses almost all of the heat and isn't very good by the time I get home.  Since I know it loses the heat I arrive before my pizza is boxed so I am ready to roll asap.  The last pizza to-go was just blah, the onion chunks were as big as my pinkie finger. 3/4 of that pizza went out with the garbage.  I won't be returning here anymore.

Prices for Toppings: I am annoyed with the price they charge ($2-4) for each topping and it's the same price for half.  You want onion on just half it will cost you $2.00...a whole organic onion doesn't even cost $2.00.  I am usually not picky about price if the food is worth it.  

Our last dine in visit we were in the back room and the squeaky balloon animal guy drove us completely nuts.  If we wanted a Circus Style Pizza Experience w/ kids climbing all over the place we would go to Chucky Cheese!  Can you say ""BONKERS?""--We couldn't wait to get out of there!!

They have great iced tea and the salads are all super. A small salad is enough for 2 people but don't expect any Ranch.  They have a great patio for outdoor dining with heaters which is great. 

My advice: Dine in for pizza and don't ever get it to go.  You will be disappointed with the to-go temp by the time you get home...even if it's right around the corner.",5fZk-aijjsRehb_jZJRXag,0,0,1,qgratPzZD1CBoIdr11ARSw

We started out our meal with a Caesar salad.  Fresh greens, crunchy croutons and tasty dressing.  Nothing particularly special, but overall a decent salad to whet your appetite. 

This particular visit, I decided to try the gluten free crust.  Wasn't sure what to expect, but wanted to give it a try.   Surprisingly good!   Crust was crisp and didn't leave you full with an over-engorged feeling eating carbs.  Be sure to ask for the pizza to be cooked crisp, that way you get a slice you can actually pick up and eat with your hands.   Fresh mozzarella and basil were the toppings I chose. Simplistic.  A light way to enjoy pizza.  

We finished the meal with Tiramisu.  Good espresso flavor and light cream taste.  We shared and enjoyed the dessert.

Tonight is 5/25/18 and apparently it's Graduation night for many young people. We arrived about 9 pm and waited at the front while a super young looking hostess spoke to a woman in line in front of us in a barely audible voice, ignored me and then took a huge party of maybe 12 guests to the back.  Then she came back, ignored me again while she mumbled something to the other woman and her date and took them to their seats. She finally came over and quietly said something (I'm not sure what, but I THINK she was asking how many of us there were?) to us then disappeared again. After a couple more minutes, a waitress came over and asked if we had been helped. She had bright red hair and was very sweet. She's the one who explained why it was so hectic tonight etc.  She arranged for us to be seated right near the brick oven area as the young hostess finally returned with menus.
Once seated, a different waitress came over to take our orders. The water came out (without the lemon I had ordered) and the salad came out super quick, but not with the dressing on the side as i had asked.  We chalked it up to the kitchen being so busy that they didn't read order details.  Our server was very attentive and the food was great. We were prepared to give her a great tip of $12 on our AFTER tax total of $56.29...but then she did something so many servers in Vegas have done that almost erased all of the amazing service she had provided. We needed change for our bill (should've been $3.71), and when she came back, she had cheated us on the 71 cents.   I understand that it is a small amount but if you think how many times she may have taken people's change without getting their permission, she may be stealing an extra $20+ from people per shift!  And the point is not the extra money she may be making off this little trick, the point is that nobody has the right to keep MY money without my permission!  And like i said, MANY servers have done this to us, but only in Vegas. My hubby & I had vowed to reduce the tip by 50-100% when servers do this to us, but we were conflicted because this one had done such a great job earlier, plus we were in an intense conversation while we were dealing with the bill.  She accidentally ended up with a nearly $10 tip which I feel is way too much for someone who assumes it's ok to keep YOUR change. We should have given her just the $3 she gave us as change to make our point that it's not ok to steal from your customers. 
TO SERVERS:  If you are too lazy to carry or make coin change for your customers, then cheat YOURSELF and give the customers the option to give the difference back to you and then some.  If you are an amazing server, you shouldn't have a problem.  
I'm not stating our server's name because I don't want her to get in trouble but I hope the whole staff reads this so my message gets out.
And that (rude, unclear hostess; drinks and appetizer coming out incorrectly; and server cheating us out of our change) once again continues my string of so-so service at this Grimaldi's.  The reasons for hit or miss service we have gotten here are not always the same, but it seems to be a consistent theme.",i3cZ6jGO32-N3B6kCaIfcA,0,1,3,aQHdX2xoQBR7P6eZvQv8UA

They do curb side to go too, so call in your order & pull up to the north side of the building & they run it out. 

Tip: don't go on a game day or major sporting event going on, hooters next door is packed & no parking is available.",bf-MBZUzp-arMSKvcp_3AA,0,0,5,UDTjqQWJhCSkHHqNmQT54w

1928262,2018-05-24,16,LpGCzgAKNSpzDNEUMVVtZA,"Finally. 

For the longest, I've search for some really excellent pizza in Vegas,
and I'd had almost given up, . . . but then I tried Grimaldi's.

The funny thing is I've probably passed by it a gazillion times, yelped it, and even bookmarked it, but for whatever reason, I didn't get around to trying it (probably because I'm currently searching for the best ayce sushi place).

But now that I have, there is little doubt that Grimaldi's will be my go to pizza spot. 

here's the skinny -

 - thin crust:  I dig it and they do a pretty good job at it (so much so that I actually ate the crust).
 
 - sauce: pretty close to the sauce I vaguely remember having in NYC (but I'll be the first to admit that's been awhile).

 - cheese: I'm not sure what it is exactly what I like about it . . . maybe it was the texture and stretchiness or maybe the balance of milkiness and salt.  whatever.  it's good. 

We ordered the Brooklyn Bridge and the Margherita:

The Brooklyn Bridge was a smidge on the sweet side (thanks to the ricotta which I would have probably replaced with either mushrooms, pepperoni, or more sausage) but still pretty tasty.

The Margherita was perfect.  I know that extra sauce and fresh basil may not sound all that mind-blowing but I nearly ate the whole pie.

My only regret was not actually eating there.  It had been a long day (we visited Hoover Dam) and we just wanted to get home, but the place looked very inviting, comfortable, and family friendly.  Next time - and there will definitely be a next time.",vRjVhl3ONG2GfWY4NXJZbQ,18,19,4,0HN4NSF4NOXlXes_sNudEA

One of my coworkers from NY raved about this place since he had positive experiences at the other locations here in Vegas. He also said ""Closes thing to NY Pizza"". This place was definitely well decorated from top to bottom. Our server was very nice and kept on raving about the ""Belgioso"" Top End cheese they used.. She was very accomodating and joyful! 

Orders for a Party of 4 from their ""coal brick oven""

18"" Large Pepperoni: At first stare I noticed their were a couple baked pieces of Fresh Basil leaves. Also noticed the thickness was my preference, not paper thin but not ""Pizza Hut Thick either. I grabbed a slice with a piece of Basil on it. Dough, Sauce, Pepperoni and Basil (might of gave it a little flair?) was one of the better pizzas i've had. It was like a Hybrid of NY Style Pizza and a splash of Settebello's Gourmet take on pizza.. Cheese didn't stretch much, had a thicker than usual consistency and tasted absoultely delicious! This was consumed in minutes.

18"" Large Sausage & Ricotta Cheese: Sausage slices were mild and had a hint of smokey flavor. The Ricotta's fluff and creamy flavor was Great. Only thing, I think they put a little too much Ricotta. Nevertheless, It was definitely satisfying! I think that Fresh Basil on top just adds a little something to each bite?! Server told us we could ask for whole pizzas to be sprinkled with Basil through out upon ordering. I think we may just do that the next time.


Very Nice place to dine and share a pie or 2 or 3.. with some friends/family. Service and Atmosphere quite swanky. Prices lean towards the higher side but worth it. I plan to come back soon!!",mY3mROf28N-vY1fpR-FFUw,3,1,4,OM228T9zfS57otmLIQ6KBg

We were full and could have stopped here, but we couldn't not try the pizza, so we ordered the seasonal special which was BBQ chicken and it was so good!!! The chicken was big pieces, the veggies were fresh, and the sauce was sweet yet tangy. The crust was so good and the slow roasted flavors compliments of their over method were excellent. The service was great and the restaurant was clean. The pieces were very fair considering the large portions. Being August, we did not sit outside on the patio due to the sweltering heat but it did look nice. This location is convenient if you're headed to Red Rock Canyon or the Hoover Dam.

it's very dark inside with a pretty dope stone oven with the cooks putting on a show prepping dough.  you get to meet a bubbly hostess at the door who will show you where to sit at one of the many tables inside a fairly large restaurant. If the weather is good, chill outside.  Las Vegas has some pretty good days, and even better nights to have a drink and a slice of pizza.   

 It's family friendly and the atmosphere is good.  The most important is the quality of service and the yummy pizza.  I've never been disappointed with anything I've eaten here, even if the food only consists of pizza.  

*If you came here for something else, please don't be disappointed that this pizza joint serves pizza.  Just visit the very large full bar to the right of the entrance with pretty much all the tops, meds, and lows.  I'm pretty sure you'll be happy with the pizza after a couple drinks.

Choose from all the typical pizza toppings offered on the menu, but it's the sauces and crust that make this pizza yummy for me.

1975590,2011-05-14,0,LpGCzgAKNSpzDNEUMVVtZA,"As many times as we drove by the location on Eastern and never tried it,  we decided to try their location on Rainbow.  we arrived around 5:30 PM on a Friday night........the parking sucks.  Besides Hooters sharing this parking lot, there are several fast food outlets here as well and they have marked their territory in the parking lot.

So that's the negative about this place.  We were greeted warmly at the door by the hostesses who also hold open the door for you.  We were seated immediately and the kids were asked if they would like pizza dough to play with...cool!    

Our server, Jo-Jo, graciously welcomed us as first timers and explained the menu.  We ordered a large cheese pizza for the kids, and we ordered a large sausage, basil and xtra cheese along with a Caprese salad.  we thought about ordering the house or Caesar salad but wanted to try the Caprese first.  The serving was large enough for splitting as were the other salads that have been previously mentioned by others below.

Both pizzas arrived and were thin crusts that were baked well in the coal oven. Our kids rarely eat the crust edge of the pizza but ate them here.  They also seemed like their pizza here over Settebello's,

Our table was constantly being attended to without being overbearing.  Drinks refilled quickly.  The manager on duty greeted us at the table and welcomed us warmly also as first timers.  In fact, she brought over some Canoli's for us as a welcome gift without realizing we had already placed an order for the strawberry cheesecake.  Save room for their cheesecake is all we can say........

1982046,2013-09-22,0,LpGCzgAKNSpzDNEUMVVtZA,"Went here twice now - one for late lunch, one for dinner. 

During the first time we went here, my boyfriend likes the place, but he doesn't like the price. We had the four cheese pizza with pepperoni and mushrooms, and New York cheesecake. We liked the FOUR CHEESE PIZZA WITH PEPPERONI AND MUSHROOMS, but it's a bit too salty for me. I'd say, don't go for the four cheese.  The NEW YORK CHEESECAKE would've been plain for me, but the raspberry drizzle helped with the flavor. On the contrary, my boyfriend likes it because it's not too sweet. My boyfriend says we'd go there more often if it wasn't too expensive.

And so we did. This time, it was with friends from San Diego. It was really busy at night. We waited for about 30-45 minutes, then had to wait some more after ordering. While waiting for a table, you can go outside, and get a drink. It sucks though since they didn't have heaters there, and it was pretty cold that night. We had ROASTED BELL PEPPERS AND SAUSAGE WITH RED SAUCE, and FETA CHEESE AND SPINACH WITH WHITE SAUCE. They were delicious. I just got annoyed that the server wants us to order more. Servers try to pressure customers to order more so they can get a bigger tip. We're pretty generous with our tips if the service is great so pressuring us to order more will only get you a low tip.

1995143,2013-06-29,0,LpGCzgAKNSpzDNEUMVVtZA,"Grimaldi's food is consistently amazing. If you've never tried the coal-fired brick oven pizza, I highly suggest you make a visit soon. 

Their salads are always extremely crisp and fresh, and the pizzas are always amazing. If you're dining for two, a small salad and a small pizza will still leave you feeling stuffed! For salads, I usually always get the house salad or their Mediterranean salad (although the Caesar dressing is awesome). For pizzas, I recommend their pepperoni and sausage, especially if it's your first visit.

The one negative thing I have to say about this specific location is that the service varies greatly from visit to visit. Sometimes the wait staff is extremely attentive and friendly. The last time I visited, however (last week), our waitress was very unfriendly, barely smiling or making eye contact, and we had to wait for several minutes with empty water glasses before she made her way over to our table. That happened more than once. The restaurant was not that crowded as it was a week night at 8:30ish. A little service hiccup will not prevent me from heading back though!

If you'd like a refreshing pre-dinner drink, I highly suggest the Lambrusco that is on their current wine list. A lovely find, and not too expensive.

We laughed at the antipasto when it came out because it was so far from what we were expecting!! They're all just wimpy and kinda sad.

The salad is big enough for two people which we did not know that until after we got a Caesar salad and a house salad. We also ordered a personal size pizza because we weren't that hungry, so My husband and I thought we would share a personal size pizza which had six slices on there and we each ordered a salad. The pizza actually was really great we ordered a Don pizza with added spicy chicken and mushrooms on it. The pizza had mozzarella marinara sauce, spicy sausage,  meat balls and pepperoni.

The pizza is served thin slice with a thin layer marinara and very little mozzarella cheese. The meatballs are nice size pieces and the spicy chicken and sausage are definitely spicy. I actually enjoyed this pizza because of the taste.

Now the price for a personal size pizza which is about the size of a dinner plate maybe slightly larger starts off about $18, then you. Can add additional toppings for anywhere between three and four dollars per topping. Most people like myself can't just have the toppings that normally come on the pizza, you always want to add additional items so once we were done eating and the bill came for one personal size pizza and two salads the bill was $60. That is crazy for the cost of pizza for lunch and a dinner salad. Pricewise I felt that should've been around maybe $30.",1lad9hCBGpHAS2uMSrKCPw,1,0,3,DlBWS9YhjIRgFqqYcPRazA

2149324,2014-12-29,0,LpGCzgAKNSpzDNEUMVVtZA,"I've been eating at this Grimaldi's for a few year's now. Let me start off with that I have actually eaten at the original Grimaldi's when I worked for a pizza magazine. And after eating at MANY of the so-called best pizza places in Las Vegas, I have to say that Grimaldi's is by far the best in town. 

Food - I simply love their pizza. The sauce and dough are fantastic and super yummy thin. You can tell it's been fired in a wood burning oven and comes out perfect every time. My favorite salad has to be their spinach. A few times the cooks have gotten a tad heavy handed with the dressing but I don't knock the whole place for that. I've learned that it's best to get the dressing on the side and immediately put half of everything in a box. I just can't eat all that salad AND all that pizza but I'd rather finish the pizza and have salad for lunch the next day.

It is a fairly small menu so if you're hoping for tons of apps and such to choose from then you might need to look elsewhere. 

Wine - I really like their wine list. I also get a nice Zinfandel blend (Red people) that is only $15 for a half carafe. That's super cheap and maybe even half a glass more than I NEED. 

Service - I have to say I always get amazing service here. I usually sit at the bar but a few times I've sat at a table and never once need anything. Everyone is always super friendly but doesn't bug you if you're trying to just chill out. 

***The ONLY negative thing I can say about this place is some specialty pizza I got talked into once. It was a Buffalo Chicken Wing pizza that I knew sounded off but wanted to do something different so I went for it. Good grief those flavors were just too much for a thin pizza. Between the Frank's Red Hot and Gorgonzola it was just too salty and heavy. If they had done something to add some coolness it could have worked***",tL4NRC4uraCxjF8ZQ6GTTw,0,0,5,CplynE5nH21CNXRF6nYCgg

I usually get the white pizza with garlic and add ricotta cheese.   Think it comes out to able $21.  It is a fairly quality pie.   Crust is solid, flavors are nice, but my beef is that after it stop being hot, the dough gets really tough, the cheese gets weird and it goes downhill faster than a wheelchair in San Francisco.   If you don't eat the pizza within like 15 mins, the pizza gets like 17 times worse.   

The cesars salad is well dressed.  Something about it is just really good.   The small is $8 and the large is $11 I think.  Kinda pricey for just lettuce, some cheese and croutons (yes, I know this is what a cesars salad is).  You have to ask for bread and oil/vinegar.   Not cool.  I don't wanna have to remember you have bread.  Just give it to me.  You change like $20 for a pie that costs you like $3 to make.   Give my ass some bread.   

 I like the atmosphere though.  They have outdoor seating that hits the spot when the weather is good.   Wait staff is usually attentive and friendly.   Don't remember them not being on top of making sure you're experience is going right.   If you don't mind an expensive pizza that's pretty good, like a very good cesars salad, and want a trendy/well decorated place, give Grimaldis' a try.",lzgEUPNFGboDm1U7aO8gTQ,1,1,3,hBujBPvywEPVXzlYW_lGbA

I was not really sure what to expect from Grimaldi's since the sit down pizza places I am used to are either the buffet kind (like CiCi's) or the mom and pop places (like Rocco's NY Pizzeria).

Walking in I was definitely surprised.  The lighting in the restaurant is all done by cutting the bottoms off of wine bottles and using them as the light fixtures to which the bulbs are attached like chandeliers.  Very cool look and goes well with the rest of restaurant.  Somewhat dark, but not in the overly romantic sort of way.

Food wise, I ordered a calzone which was fantastic.  I had never had a calzone the way that they served it, without sauce inside it, which at first was a bit odd, but it was great!

The pizza sauce is on point so much depth too it then just tomatoes taste the hints of herbs and lot of flavor. The mozzarella believe buffalo combine with toppings brings it full circle. I prefer only put two topping or less because since then crust pizza last thing want weight it down with toppings. The topping from the pepperoni (like not the then slice circle ones see at mass market pizza joints) nice big ones, sausage nice thin sliced pieces, and toppings all fresh nothing see in mass market aka pizza huts of the world. My favorite is pepperoni and sausage on my pie. The salads are really good! I had both the caesar and mediterranean salad. Mediterranean salad is Winner! It nice fresh full salad with cucumbers, greek blacks olives, red onions, tomatoes, and feta cheese. They offer you fresh cracked black pepper when salad arrives not always automatic in many restaurants. I never have room for desserts time finish meal.

What II really enjoy about the menu is its simplicity. It straight forward about the pie, salad, and desserts. This day and age seems more and more restaurants have huge menus. So too get that true sense of a new york family ma and pa pizza joint adds too the dining experience.

""New York-style?! BLERGH! Folding pizza in half while the oil drips on the plate? Nooooo thanks!"" And then I'd cackle unattractively and come home to junk flyers on my doorsteps from three other pizzerias within a half mile, each of which had disappointed me at some point. (Ending with turning out to be litterbug spammers.) Would I have to leave Las Vegas to get some good pizza?!

(I do enjoy the end pieces at Northside Nathan's, but pizza is my lazy food, and Flamingo is north of my ""lazy zone."")

Then one day I decided to live up to my ""Let's notch it!"" motto. Also, I was dying for some pizza. And, as noted, I'm lazy. ""Mike! Let's go to Grimaldi's!""

""Ugh. Isn't that famously New York-style?""

""Yeah, but I reeeeeaaaalllly want pizza. And if we don't like it, we can savage it on Yelp.""

(Talk about your 21st-century pep talks. But, I think it was the timeless appeal of having someone else cook that won him over.)

I can't remember now if we went back twice that week or only once. I only know that I walked into Grimaldi's as a skeptic and within the hour was a bubbling fan.

We've never eaten in the restaurant proper, but it has a casual, accessible elegance with congenial staff from the door to the bar. The outside patio dining looks pleasant enough (for those three or four weeks out of the year when it's not a misery to be outside), with one side of the bar serving those inside and the other serving those out. To-go pizza orders are placed on the inside-side of the bar.

As is my usual, I got a regular pizza with mushrooms. Skeptical Mike grabbed something from a nearby fast food place instead because we'd already figured out through a number of bad experiences that we both disliked New York-style pizza, and he wasn't going to go through the sad journey again, especially not to a box that boasted that this was the pizza that made the Brooklyn Bridge famous.

But as we drove away, we both couldn't help but notice how good the box smelled. (And my nose has been undependable since I had pneumonia last winter.)  By the time we were home, the pizza still unseen, Mike was questioning whether he'd made the right choice.

Well, this pizza was beautiful. Thin crust, absolutely, but not the kind where you pick up the slice and it points at your lap. The crust had flavour; it wasn't just a sauce-n-toppings vehicle. The sauce wasn't too sweet; I'm not a fan of a sweet sauce, but nor was it bland or just ""tomato-y."" I can't elevate it to ""spicy"" (my preference), but there's a full, pleasant taste. 

Mozzarella fans would be proud of how the cheese melted just enough while staying a little solid, reminiscent of fresh mozzarella slices. The mushrooms tastes of the market, not the can, and they were evenly distributed across the pizza.

And with every bite, that waft of YUM.

The next night, Mike wanted Grimaldi's. He'd been envious for the past 24 hours. (But was thwarted by the evil mushrooms.) I'm not sure how many times we've been since. We've had a few ""off"" encounters: they forgot my mushrooms once, the crusts were a bit burnt another time, and of course sometimes you order pizza then, two bites later, realize you want a break from it. 

Overall, though, so far Grimaldi's has been a reliable place for a tasty pizza. Sure, I wish they made the thick crust-style I prefer, but what they do, they do so well. As I see them listed as one of the top pizza places in the country on list after list, I realize that maybe those New Yorkers aren't so crazy when it comes to pizza after all. Someday I'll have to try other items on Grimaldi's menu, which includes pesto and white pizzas as well as calzones, but it's hard to mess with what has finally proven to be a very sure thing.",l9YOhaPYvTJi_qfD3Y-wBQ,5,2,4,0PXIjDO02-rsH7vvdoVsZQ

These folks are all about NYC thin crust and I'm totally cool with that.  Real deal, gourmet level pizza (without rididiculous toppings like prawns and white truffles).  Expect to spend in the neighborhood of 20 bones (a pricey neighborhood) for a basic large pizza, but the quality of sauce, crust, and toppings are definitely top shelf.  Crispy/chewy crust, dang, these people just plain know how to get the job done! The fresh basil totally kicks it up a notch and is so noticeable that you'll say something out loud about it.

Overall, my wallet wouldn't be able to handle me eating here as often as I'd like,  yet I wouldn't mind developing a little credit card debt if I could have their pizza more often.  It's seriously that good.

The cheese on the pizza was different from the normal mozzarella cheese, and looked almost like goat cheese. Everything about my first try at Grimaldi's pizza was a miss for me.

Our server was friendly and service was not lacking. We always had our waters refilled. We ordered:

Large Mushroom Pizza and Large Sausage Pizza: The crust was so thin and perfectly crispy. The sauce had a nice flavor to it. There wasn't cheese covering the entire pizza so I think next time I would order extra cheese. Both toppings were fresh and plentiful but I liked the sausage a little better. Overall, really good flavors.

Jalapeño Calzone: I didn't try this one but my friends were huge fans. The inside was STUFFED with cheese and jalapeños. They did not skimp at all. And my friends who are all fans of spicy foods were literally coughing at the spice but absolutely loved it. 

House Salad (Large): For $9 this wasn't bad. It fed all 6 of us and tasted fresh. The dressing was a vinaigrette. If you want more than the basics, go for one of the other salads. 

The one weird thing about this place was that they don't have ranch dressing at all. So weird! I always like dipping my pizza in ranch. Overall I would eat here again.

At that time I was thinking thin crust is just thin crust. So when me, my wife, and a friend were hungry for lunch, I remembered my co-worker's quote so off we went to this location.

From the moment we pull up to the front door, the hostess was there holding the door open for us, greeted us politely, and sat us down right away. Our server, Kent (who was very nice and cordial), told us everything we needed to know once we told him we were first timers. 

Their menu is simple to read and understand, especially after Kent explained it to us in further detail. We got the large (18 inch) with pepperoni, mushrooms, and garlic. One bite from my slice and I was in heaven. From that point on, I knew this was gonna be the measuring stick for any thin crust pizzas I eat from now on. 

The prices are just a little more than your average pizza joint. But with that said, it's actually worth it according to what my stomach told me. This is probably the only place that I don't mind spending extra not having to think twice about it. It's that good!

The service was outstanding. I didnt have to ask for anything! Refiils were constant and we were constantly being checked on. If this was any indication of service from all their locations, then I can't wait to eat at the next location! Hay, even their bathroom was nice and clean! That's a bonus!

We got a white pizza with onions, mushrooms, and pepperoni. Delicious! They skimped on the pepperoni, though.

The place is kid-friendly, of course, and I like how they give kids some pizza dough to play with. It not only kept my little guy busy but educated him about the food he was eating. Telling him where his food comes from was kind of like a ""birds and bees"" conversation, but less awkward.

Until now!  The service is nice from start to finish with pretty quick service.  They have a bar for cocktails while you dine (and have the coolest wine bottle chandeliers I am going to recreate in my bar at home) lots of wine to choose from.  The greeter is nice and the staff was great.  Night before Christmas Eve it was busy from the nearby stores but the food came quickly not a worry.

Because it was my first and I am kind of a Pizza fanatic I had to start slow and continue slow to truly enjoy the flavors.  When you take your time this Za has so many underlying flavors that you will miss if you dig right in.  The ""Coal Brick-Oven"" is true and it is AMAZING!  A soft Smokey flavor with every delicious bite of all the other flavors of you're choosing.  It is an ala cart pizza style so it can add up but with flavors like this it is worth the price.

The ambiance is awesome, decor beautiful as I mentioned I am totally going to have the wine bottle chandelier in the near future.  Service is nice fast and efficient and the food is great!

1.The decor is comforting and not pretentious.
2. The service is good but, not in your face obnoxious.
3. They have a bar with a limited liqour selection and a generous wine list with plenty of by the glass or by the bottle selections.
4. Weather permitting (majority of the year), they open the doors to the bar, which transforms it into an open-air dining/bar experience.
5. The pizza is awesome!
     a) Tasty, thin, chewy crust.
     b) Addicting red sauce.
     c) Fresh sliced mozzarella.
     d) Extra toppings are delectable.
     e) Perfect cheese to sauce ratio.
6. Generous salad portions, a small is enough for three.
     a) Caesar salad is pretty yummy.
7. They have five convenient locations around the valley for easy access (hence we dine or do take out here about once a week).

There's just something about the pizza that makes me go WOW.  I can't put my finger on it (no pun intended) but, it drives me wild; some may even say it's better than sex. :-X  Anyway, I usually crave Grimaldi's pie at least once a week (ugh).  Since my last visit, my addiction has grown even wilder.  I normally don't stray from the usual plain and/or pepperoni pies because, a good pie doesn't need anything more.  This last visit time I tried a small ""Christmas pizza"" as the bartender called it.  A regular plain pie with pesto and pepperoni.  If you know me well, I'm a glutton, so I also ordered a large plain pie.   Holy pepperoni, the Christmas pie was stupidly awesome!  That night I restrained myself and only ate two of the Christmas slices and about four of the plain; that's how good Grimaldi's is.  

Yes, I understand it is a chain restaurant but, eating at chain restaurants ensure consistency.  Consistency is something to be desired when it comes to food.  Their prices are also consistent at all of their Vegas locations: 
Plain Pie
small $9 
medium $14
large $16
$2-5 per extra toppings
To sum it all up, a nice caesar, a couple of good pies, and a decent bottle will run you about $100.  TOTALLY worth it!

So all of the above is why I hate Grimaldi's.  I'll probably go tonight :X",g89D3f_9GnTzHPNoxIpuKQ,2,1,5,Auu6DOwSkGYqt0JZXWSoyQ
2911384,2015-08-18,4,LpGCzgAKNSpzDNEUMVVtZA,"Meh. I've experienced better.

That pretty much sums up my experience tonight at this Grimaldi's location on Rainbow Blvd. It's a shame too, since I am a big fan of their pies. I have been to several of their locations and used to especially enjoy the location on Eastern/ 215.

Pros-

- The reason they are getting the 2 stars is simple. The pizza is still scrumptious! We grabbed a large 16"" pie($16) with grilled chicken(an additional $5).
- I still the dig the ambiance of the place, especially the wine bottle chandeliers! That coupled with all the vintage pics of New York really creates a fun and unique atmosphere.

Cons-

- I tried not to hold this against them, but the entire time we were there, they were hosting a large and LOUD group. These people were yelling over one another and, to add to the fun, they had a gaggle of infants pitching ear piercing screams. As much as we tried to brush it off, it VERY much took away from the experience....to the point where I've never felt such a relief in leaving a restaurant! 

As it relates to this, I was confused because this large group was placed right in the front of the restaurant, while a large room with about a dozen tables and sliding doors sat there unused. Would it not have made sense to place this group in this area where they could enjoy themselves and been a lot less disruptive?? This is something I CAN hold against them!
- Our server wasn't terrible, but he seemed pretty annoyed....and it showed. We felt like he just kind of ""mailed it in"". He didn't even offer to refill our beverages and I had to wave him down to get my drink replenished. It could have been and should have been much better.
- When we asked about pineapple for a topping, our waiter responded,"" No pineapple. No wi-fi. No ranch."" Wow. lol Ok.

By the end of the meal, we could not WAIT to get the eff out of there. We both made the remark that we should have just stuck to Rosati's since it is much closer to home.

In summary, I still love Grimaldi's and I still love their pies, but I will drive the extra miles to go back to the Eastern restaurant and avoid ever coming back to this location.

Disappointing. Underwhelming. A complete letdown.

There are a few places I  love to stop at time and again, and Grimaldi's is one of those places you'll never get sick of.  Their sauce is fresh and has just the right tang, their mozzarella is creamy and flavorful.  I don't ruin the flavor of the pizza and crust with lots of toppings; rather, I just place some basil on it and call it a day.  The taste of crispy basil on their classic pizza is to die for.  

There are few pizza places I'll give four stars to, and I love Grimaldi's because their sauce isn't too puckery and their cheese is so darn perfect.  No matter how many times I eat here and swear to try something new, I don't have the heart to ruin the classic cheese with anything else.  I grab a small basil, extra basil, and call it a day.

I have been to the original brooklyn shop and was a little iffy of the pizza here. we had to try it though and so glad we did. rachel was our server and was friendly and helpful. we started off with some sangria for 6 dollars a glass. I had the red, which was a little strong, just the way i like, while my mom had the white, which was really sweet, just how she likes. we ordered the large white garlic pizza with half chicken and half meatball. now beware they do charge you the same prices of toppings even if you order half. (toppings are where they catch you with price.) it can get expensive. the pizza was 18 dollars while the grilled chicken was 5 dollars and the meatballs coming in at 2 dollars. that is 25 dollars total for a large pizza if you can't do math.
after we took our first folded pizza bites we knew we had a winner though. my favorite was the meatball side while my mom loved the grilled chicken. thin crust perfect for folding and a tasty white garlic pizza that wasn't too overwhelming on the garlic flavor. i could taste everything and everything was amazing. very well done grimaldi's. we finished 2 slices each and had another 4 to take home for leftovers. (which i should add were finished off by the time we went to bed. so good!) we saved a little room for dessert and ordered the caramel apple cheesecake for another 5 dollars. holy cheesecake Gods! talk about melt in your mouth good. since it was my mom's birthday I let her eat the majority of it, but i could go back just for a piece of that little heaven. it was a great fall dessert with so much flavor. it even had little pieces of apples in the cheesecake. yums!

The West Coast Kitty's Youngest Son was wed in Utah on March 15th 2014. Her oldest son, she and myself drove back to LA on that Monday the 17th. On the drive up to Utah for the wedding there was a semi fire on the highway outside of Vegas, which backed traffic up for hours. It was suggested that we stop in Vegas and get a pie from Gramaldi's, which I thought was ""out of the blue"" kind of suggestion. So armed with that thought I brought Gramaldi's up on the drive home. After the West Coast Kitty read a description of this place there were absolutely no doubts that we where stopping in Vegas for a pie and that's exactly what we did!
So now that we all have the set up let's get to the Epic food! The WCK order the Antipasto dish an her son asked me to pick the pie. I needed a little info so I inquired, that the cheese they use is authentic buffalo mozzarella. They have their water altered by a chemist once a week. The Fire Roast the red peppers in house. They offer ricotta cheese as a topping. So the pie was A large three topping pie with Pepperoni, Roasted Red Peppers and Ricotta. I waited hoping not to be disappointed and suddenly the pie arrived. So the waitress served a slice to Dayne and a slice to me and ask I we needed anything else, no we said and off she went. I looked at the two of them whom were staring back at me waiting and so I took a bite, Ohh My Stars it was absolute NY Heaven! Everything about this pie was awesome, which The WCK mentioned to her son of my happiness an her relief and nudge him to taste. He took a bite chewed and swallowed. He took another bite just as slow and chewed and swallowed. He than proclaimed that it was the best pizza he had eaten in his entire life! I would say that says it all, as I do agree with almost all of that statement! The WCK's Antipasto was Italian through and through as it was all meats, cheese, bread, spiced olive oil and no salad anywhere just to die for good. I will say it will be for sure the best pizza you have wet eaten if you are from California. If your east coast and dying for NY Pizza then I suggested you make your way down Gramaldi's in El Segundo CA and grab a pie and beer! I know I will be seeing you there as Gramaldi's is the authentic real deal and has been for over 100 years! I say give me more stars as five isn't even close to enough!!!!",z8GPKM8JqLq_WYDAv1vLZw,2,0,5,D_CG2M0KCT2OENrbc_SzZQ
3062093,2018-03-12,0,LpGCzgAKNSpzDNEUMVVtZA,Hands down the best pizza I've ever had in Nevada!! The service is superior to any other Vegas restaurant I've been to. Vince and his staff are second to none. The food is amazing!! You definitely need to stop by if you're in Vegas! I try and save some to take home but end up eating it by midnight.

I have my short list of favorites in LA but I heard about Grimaldi's and took advantage of the opportunity when I was in Las Vegas.

This is stunningly good pizza that would stand with the best in NYC.  What confounds me is that Grimaldi's is a chain (based on the Brooklyn original).  Until now, great pizza bordered on artistry.  Somehow, Grimaidi's figured out how to break down the process resulting in the execution of consistently amazing pies.  Wow!  They have coal ovens, access to hard-to-find ingredients like bufalo mozzarella and they didn't look at me strangely when I asked for a margherita pie: a real pizzeria.

I love the thought of Grimaldi's expanding to cities where decent pizza cannot be found and where low-rent chains like Domino's are put out of business.",gQspVZ78KbELItUKOxOblQ,4,3,5,rK-nwDeTxIisDbYUUvaN0Q

It had roasted red pep, green olives, kalamata olives, mozzarella, salami and prosciutto!   Our pizza was the $25 Brooklyn pizza with  roasted red peppers, Italian sausage, creamy ricotta, and mozzarella cheese.  $6 Oreo cheesecake was to die for but it's very thick and sweet so share it!

What brought me here was a coupon. $5 off $25 or more is a great coupon when a small pizza starts at $14 or $16. The prices are a tad high but unless you eat slice after slice, a small is fine for two people.

I ordered a small cheese pizza with basil. The pizza is good and for a chain it's real good. However, the basil was wilted and tasted bitter. The tomato sauce is also bland and on the sweeter side. It just needs more seasoning and probably more time to cook. They also need to get their basil from a better source because the basil was weak. 

Prices are high for the execution but at least you know what to expect. 

Four stars because the customer service exceeded my expectations.",hulIBBzPsCaQDcoh_JgSBA,4,5,4,DpWV81Upfr0rEnF-YSKvyw

3170031,2017-01-15,0,LpGCzgAKNSpzDNEUMVVtZA,"We have been to this location a time or two and have been other Grimaldis in town.

The pizza is ok in my opinion. Nothing to write home about but some native New Yorkers in our family swear by it, so to each their own.

The issue here is service. The first time it was ok. Had to ask twice for a few things, but on a busy weekend night, that's totally understandable.

The last visit was on a quiet Monday night around 6:30pm. Not many of the tables were full so it wasn't drastically busy.

Nothing was right. There were three of us. We each ordered our own pizzas. First this drinks came out wrong and never got refilled. 

Ask for water with lemon, no lemon served.
Asked for pizza with olives, no olives on the pizza.
Three pizzas for three people came out separately over the course of 15 mins. So we couldn't eat together without the others waiting and food getting cold. We were told the wrong pizza when it was brought to the table, so one person accidentally ate the other persons pizza while we were waiting and didn't discover the issue until 15 mins later when we had to ask about when the last pizza was coming. Only then we were informed it was dropped and cooking again. I get it, accidents happen... but let us know so we don't wait and let the other food get cold.

No apologies, just a server that said ""my bad"" when asking for the missing items. No manager to check on the service. 

We decided that Boca park will be our go to for grimaldis.

On a positive note, I'm very pleased that they now have a gluten friendly pizza! It's so wonderful to see the menu growing. I'm sure as they continue to offer gluten free items, it will only get better like many places do. The crust is a bit dry but about average for most gluten free pizzas.",7308lEhM1lrH2cYCOk3SJA,0,0,2,JkHIUx3TCs1PESetC9e9Rw

However, when it came to our server he seemed like he was not happy to be there and not happy that we were there . He repeated the specials as if he was reading out of a book and was bored . He also did not refill half of the tables drinks only when we asked .

As for the food we ordered two large pizzas, one was very good and moist but the other one fell a little dry . So it was inconsistent . The Caesar salad was so yummy though ! And an excellent complimentary to the pizzas . 

They also give kids balls of pizza dough to roll around which was cute :) 

My experience was okay taking into account the okay service to the dry and moist pizzas and the yummy Caesar salad . So I would say it was an okay experience . Maybe I'll come back to give it another shot , maybe they had an off day ?",C4KfHQbd-cP9SyvgJYNY1w,3,3,3,_eJAmlXvsG-bhkDwmR04wg

If you go to the same domain name and click on menu you get this page, (with NO prices):

https://www.grimaldispizzeria.com/menu_type/pizzas/

The 2012 page has an individual pizza for $9 and a meatball add on for $2.  The two times I have been to the Rainbow location in Vegas I had the same conversation.  

me: Your online prices are much lower, $9 pizza and $2 meatball add on, this receipt says $16.

server: where online?

me: Yelp

server: oh see that is the problem using Yelp, meatballs were never $2.

me: The menu on Yelp links to a page on the Grimaldispizzeria.com website.

The ingredients in my pizza usually consist of garlic, mushroom and certain veggies but since they did not have the other veggies I like I saw they had meatball which is not always on the menu. It was damn good meatball. yum yum... I love how they do not skimp out on the ingredients. 

Like they say you want all your ingredients on half or whole same price.. so you might as well just get the whole pizza with your ingredients.

Had especially great service, and wanted to blast the extra great employees since people normally only name names when it's bad...this was not, they were, like I said, great!

Service:

We came on an oddly busy Tuesday, just two of us. The hostess, Kendal- I even remembered her name because she was so awesome - she was able to find us a table in good time. They were swamped and there was a huge group in front of us who were really pushy, we watched her handle them with grace & was still in a genuinely nice, friendly mood when it was our turn. Too many times I've experienced employees taking it out in me when business is busy, I was impressed by how she handled everyone. 

We got to our table, and our server introduced himself, Steven. He suggested the Sangria. Sure, sounds great. I think he needed it more though, from the looks of how slammed they were! 

Delivered waters quickly, delivered Sangrias. The rest of the our visit went on the same. Had my glass of Educated Guess (woohoo!) and they continued to do everything they should, pleasantly. He even took time to answer our questions, like are the dressing prepackaged, is the sausage made in house, etc... Answers were.... It's all made in house!

Before we left, the GM stopped by our table with a smile before we left, and genuinely wanted to know how everything was. Great! Love that attention to detail.

Food:

They always have seriously good pizza. When you want a Grimaldi's pizza, there is nothing that compares.

Don't miss their Italian Sausage. It's homemade, as are all of their salad dressings- Caesar, spinach, Caprese, you really can't go wrong. 

I kind of love the simple menu concept, because they can focus on doing what they do and making it really fresh!  Decent enough wine list, sangria and mixed drinks. Go for the Educated Guess

Other details:

It can be a busy place so MAKE A RESERVATION on weekends. 

They are limited on space but do a great job with what they have. Their staff have always been so hospitable, they even open the door for you as you walk in & open the door as you leave. A good company protocol, shows they are all about  hospitality! You will feel at home.

Our server, Ray, was friendly and asked us if we have been to the restaurant before or if it was our first time. It was our first time so he took the time to explain the menu and how their coal brick oven creates perfectly charred thin crust. We decided to skip appetizers and go straight to pizza. 

We ordered a large white pizza with garlic, one half with ricotta and basil and the other half with pesto and grilled chicken.  The crust was so delicious and charred just right. I was surprised that it wasn't greasy at all. 

Ray was great about checking on us and refilling drinks at the right times.  He even cleaned the crumbs off our table before our dessert came out. It really did feel like five star service!

He recommended the cheesecake which they bake in house. I am so glad we ordered it. It was creamy and was the right amount of sweetness. It was the perfect way to end the meal.

I love how service was prompt and friendly. It was obvious that their restaurant was like a well oiled machine because even though it was a busy Saturday night, we never waited too long or felt rushed.

We ended up ordering all large versions of the don, the brooklyn and two traditional pizzas.  We also got a caesar, Antipasto, and House salad to start.

No problems with service.  Salads came out in about 10 minutes.  They were small, and each bowl was good for about 4 people.  They were fine, nothing to write home about.  The pizzas started coming out 10 minutes after the salad- but they didn't all come out at the same time, but within a few minutes of each other.

The pizzas were exactly what you come to expect New York style.  Thin and a small layers, not like a Chicago style where its piled on.  They did taste good, and we ended up eating all 4 pizzas and 3 salads!  It was good food, but nothing that blew me away.

Everything was just average, however, the white pizza with chicken was super bland.   Would not recommend...not worth to ingest on tasteless bad carbs.

Crispy, thin crust, fresh mozzarella, baked in a brick oven... There's nothing better. There's pictures of New York everywhere in this place, but I never had anything this good when I was over there. This is pizza in its purest form: quality ingredients, well-balanced flavors. Even when I finish a whole personal pizza and I leave completely stuffed, I never feel gross. The crust is light and airy, unlike other pizzerias that serve thick, bready, cardboard-like crust.  With the extensive topping list, the possibilities are endless. This is typical of pizza restaurants, but this is the first place I've been to where all the ingredients seem to mesh perfectly. No matter what toppings I choose, it always comes out tasting like it was meant to be! My go-to is meatball and pesto sauce. Try it!

The passion fruit tea is awesome! The last time I went, the restaurant was a little busy so I don't think filling my glass was a priority for my server. Such a bummer, because the tea is actually one of the reasons I keep coming back and I've never been disappointed at grimaldi's before this.  I'll let it slide though because the food was great.

Let me tell you there food is amazing, delicious, marvelous, wonderful...you get the point.

We were promptly greeted by our wonderful waitress Denise, she had asked if we had eaten here before and we said no so she explained how it work and how to order she was very informative which I loved. I ordered the personal size pesto pizza with meatballs. This by far is probably the best pizza Ive ever tasted in my life! The crust is hand tossed and whatever dough they use is scrumptious, they topped that with the delicious creamy pesto sauce and generous amount of mozzarella cheese and the out of this world meatballs! You can tell they use all fresh ingredients and good quality products. The whole pizza went together very well I couldn't stop eating I ate til I was sick that's how good this pizza was. 

Even though I was stuffed from the wonderful pizza I had to order dessert I'm not only a sucker for desserts and have the worlds biggest sweet tooth but there homemade!!!
I ordered a oreo cheese cake, this piece of heaven melted in my mouth it was creamy fluffy goodness.

But the sauce is a bit tangy.  it reminds me of jarred tomato sauce where it is sweetened with high fructose corn syrup.  Now I am not saying that their sauce is sweetened with corn syrup, but it certainly tastes like it.  Usually pizza sauce, that isn't over cooked or sweetened, tastes like a juicy tomato with salt and other spices...it should NOT taste like ketchup (which is accepted to have sugar added to it.)   All ketchup has sugar in it - that is what makes it ketchup!  But when a pizza sauce has that tangy/sweet flavor it tells me that it is inferior.  The food needs a new sauce...if they did that - it would be 5 stars.",VgBO0HlIYpXxOPt_33t7oQ,0,0,3,bGjPuMIqphgQggNVU4ZtTA

The service is excellent (my first time both our server and waiter offered to explain the menu fully) and the interior/decor is welcoming with a very neat style. Most importantly the food is terrific, the ricotta is nice and creamy and the pizza crust is a perfectly cooked thin crust. I've had a spinach and mushroom calzone as well as a white pizza with spinach, mushrooms, and Roma tomatoes and loved both. Also, despite not being a big fan of cheesecake, I tried a little of their strawberry cheesecake and it was quite tasty.

Drinks...Salads...PIZZAS...Desserts! 

The pizza here is just amazing! The crust is delicious...thin with a great crunchy crisp texture to it. A regular pie is enough for two people to share but delicious enough for a little Asian to force down happily. 

Their salads are pretty great as well. Portions are very generous and the presentation is pleasing. 

Price wise...a bit pricey for pizza, (especially if you are a person who likes to add a lot of toppings onto your pizza) but you'll be getting a quality pie.

3788680,2012-05-08,1,LpGCzgAKNSpzDNEUMVVtZA,"More charming than expected.

After seeing their pizza prices (externally) I felt queasy about the potential value proposition. I mean, the large pizza is ~16 bucks and toppings start at another $2 and a lot are $4. There's no thick crust here and thin crust pizza doesn't go as far. I was a little scared, however someone else offered to pay and the best kind of overpriced pizza is the kind you don't pay for, so why not?

Firstly they offered my toddler pizza dough to play with. This is a surprisingly good and original call. Kept him distracted for like five minutes, which of course is equivalent to a normal human year in toddler attention span. The beer list is solid with several choices from Deschutes. Also they serve their Sam Adams in the perfect Pint glasses which is really impressive. 

The salads are solid. No doubt about that and reasonably priced as well. The Pizza is extremely spectacular and seems authentic. I stopped thinking of it as overpriced. Then they informed me that didn't have ranch. What the eff country do they think they're in? Anyways... We got three people out of there eating well and drinking well (except for the Toddler, he's trying to cut down on his alcohol) for $51 bones. Not terrible at all.

There's a friendly charm to the place; there were lots of families, lots of bright happy windows and a neat outdoor seating area. Also many people inside were unusually good looking both from the staff and the clientele. One of the waitresses looks like what Megan Fox would look like if she was a pizza waitress. Same expression too. If they give a discount to good looking people I didn't get one, sadly. However good for them for keeping up their standards.

Will return: most likely to drink beer on the patio, but at least during the day to enjoy the glorious sunshine the place gets.",H7fr4A3OlKtDr-sNn8BIlw,1,1,4,rGE7BduPCuwYneRBeAYbUg

On a Saturday afternoon, I was surprised to see a fairly empty restaurant. We decided to sit at the patio - a big mistake because it was pretty hot outside, but oh well.

My fiancé and I ordered the small pizza (16 inches) with jalapenos, pepperoni, mushrooms, bacon, and green peppers. 20 minutes pass and we see a pizza heading our way. The waiter drops the pizza at our table and serves our first slice. My fiancé was so hungry that he starts taking bites. I was so hungry too that I take my first bite and I tasted something I didn't like. I study the pizza - it's olives! Ugh - olives. Then I scrutinize the pizza more and realized that this pizza is definitely not the pizza we ordered - not at all. It has olives, sausage, ricotta cheese.... We try to find our waiter and we can't find him anywhere. 

We see the guy that refills drinks and we tell him that we have the wrong pizza. A waitress comes our way and nonchalantly apologizes, tells us that our pizza is still in the oven and that if we wanted to box this pizza up to take it home, we can since it was going in the trash. We accepted as we had family who would be glad to eat it.

Ten minutes or so later, our pizza, the ""real"" one comes out. It was amazing! I loved every bite of it. The pizza was pretty big - good for two, or three people.

3830821,2016-12-09,0,LpGCzgAKNSpzDNEUMVVtZA,"Grimaldis is stepping up their game for sure! In my personal opinion, I think it's one of the best in Vegas. 

Let's get straight to the point. First off drinks:
Italian Margarita - by far my favorite drink. It's got amaretto mixed into this so a margarita with a sweet twist. 
Paloma Italian - tequila and grapefruit - yum
Bloody Mary - great but a strip of bacon would've been the perfect finishing touch 
Mule - you can either get it with vodka or bourbon - the bourbon one is fantastic and they use a good quality ginger beer
Wine- Grimaldis makes their own red wine and when paired with the pizza...oh boy!

Starters:
Bruschetta Trio - Mushroom/red pepper, tomato and basil, roasted artichoke - loved them all, especially the roasted artichoke. 

Mediterranean salad - kalamata olives was the star. Dressing made in house. 
Kale chopped everything salad - kale is usually bitter but this was perfectly mixed with the lemon vinegarette 
Spinach salad - delicious but not a fan of raw onions

Pizzas:
Classic Margherita Pizza - I love that all the pizzas that were served came out steaming hot and all of them and a nice not so thick crunchy crust and the right amount of topping. This particular pizza was good but I'm a big meat eater
Quattro Formaggi - aka white cheese pizza - get this if you're a cheese lover
The Don - my favorite pizza - Italian sausage, meatballs and pepperoni
Joe's special pizza - also one of my favorites. It's a custom pizza with spinach, kalamata olives and bacon! 

Service was great and the server really knew the menu inside and out. So many options to choose from - I have to come back and try everything else.",9ZXaiRPUbjBscTY5F2Kf_A,2,1,4,1_bO67c3rTuFswAwQ4Jbxw

After hearing so much about Grimaldis and the lack of good pizza on the west side of the Las Vegas valley I thought I'd give it a try since I live less than 2 miles away. While ordering I asked for a side of pizza sauce and they asked if I wanted to come in to pick it up or if I wanted curbside pickup. I asked for curbside. They said 20-25 minutes. I left right away and arrived there 10 mins. after placing my order.  I parked in front and after 5 mins of waiting I decided to go inside. To my surprise it was already at the bar waiting. If it was ready why didn't they check to see if I was there to give me my pizza? And after sitting at the bar for who knows how long the pizza was cold. I got home 24 mins. after ordering my pizza. If I had waited the time they told me I would have picked up an even harder, colder pizza. The sauce was refrigerator cold which was annoying. The pizza was paper plate thin and although I ordered extra cheese it barely had any. I had to reheat the pizza when I got home but even so it was horrible. For $25 the largest pizza they had was so thin that all 8 pieces barely filled my wife and I. Metro pizza is much better and half a pizza fills us both.

It is brick oven fired...which gives it an incredibly crunchy crust without being dry like a cracker. They also have a decent wine list for a pizza joint, if you are into that sort of thing.

Two of us shared a kale salad, a 12"" margherita pizza and a glass of wine, and it was perfect.  Salad was well dressed, pizza was served hot.  (The best thin crust around!)  Service was excellent, and the manager checked in on us too.  Funny story - when our pizza slices were being doled out by the server, my slice slid right off the spatula!

Towards the crust it was the perfect amount of crispness, but the middle was so soaked with sauce and grease it was hard to eat because it kept flopping down. Not really what I want when I'm buying this sort of style pizza. Maybe it was so greasy due to the size, but I'd have liked every bite to have that crispness.

We started with sangria. It was not premade as any good sangria is, so the flavors of the wine and fruit can blend. Speaking of fruit, that was lacking as well. I am used to sangria having pieces of fruit that one can eat, this just had sliced of orange and lemon that should have been used as garnish only.

We split a small caesar salad, the small was enough to feed two ladies that are trying to watch their figure (sorta!) but for heavy eaters it may not be enough to split. 
Also split a small pizza, half white with no toppings and the other have red with mushrooms. The pizza was cooked perfectly, I love the thin and crispy crust. I really enjoyed the delicious garlic flavor of white side, which had the perfect amount of cheese. However, the other side did very little for me.. I just didn't care for the flavor of the red sauce.

The dark furniture, the checker table cloths, the wine bottle chandeliers all provide for a nice, intimate atmoshpere. It would be a little classier with fewer windows and candle lit tables. I appreciate the black and white photos of NYC but the subway signs area bit campy. As for the food, I ordered a simple personal size pizza with meatballs and onions. It was delicious. Not as much cheese as would be on a pizza from other places I would order from. And the crust is much thinner than I typically like. It was good though. A perfect balance of crunch and chew. I had planned on bringing home half my pizza for later but the thinness of the crust did not fill me enough. That coupled with the deliciousness of it prevented me from saving any at all. I finished my pizza right there in the restaurant. I had to wait a long time as when I walked in they were just cleaning the ovens in preparation for the dinner rush. It was almost a boring wait. It would have seemed a long time were it not for the 1940's lounge tunes playing not so softly over head. I was singing right along to much of the music. That passed the time quite nicely.",eOIMO2wT_WbNqmavhnCRxw,1,0,4,SAfy4encZ65bodqKsZowQQ
4159526,2015-01-26,2,LpGCzgAKNSpzDNEUMVVtZA,"I love Grimaldi's pizza, but this review is based on the service of this particular restaurant.

We ordered a large pepperoni on Saturday night and was told it would be ready in 20 minutes and to meet them at the pickup location on the side of the building.  We arrived after 15 minutes and parked at the designated pick up location.  We sat there, and sat there, no one came out to greet us. We sat there for 15 minutes and finally someone came out to take our money.  This was not a big deal HOWEVER, the pizza was cold!  

I don't understand how they could mess up this bad because they could clearly see our car in the pick up location and they were not busy inside.  The only explanation is that they are just not good at their jobs.  The owner of this place needs to restaff soon.  The Grimaldi's on Eastern has a staff that is crazy good.

Its faster to just go in and get it yourself. Not sure why they have curb side pickup if they dont pay attention to whos outside waiting.

Female server was prompt and attentive but not overbearing or pushy like some places.  She took our order of a large sausage pizza.  Took about 15-20 minutes for the pizza to arrive.  Pizza was very good.  Some people are sadists and want their food piping hot when it's delivered so they can shovel it in right away and scald their mouths.  I, on the other hand, prefer my food to warm and hot but comfortably edible when it arrives.  Our pizza was brought to the table this way so that it was imediately edible, which was nice.  I do not like to have to sit and wait for 10 minutes for my food to cool down before eating.  As we finished our meal, I noticed the restaurant begin to fill up.  It was a nice family atmosphere.  Received our check in a timely manner and was processed in a timely manner as well.  We received drink refills as needed and did not have to wait very long for refills.  Overall, a good experience and great food.  Prices are reasonable; however, can get pricey depending on how many toppings you desire.  Parking could be an issue if it is busy.

That said, I am a self-admitted pizza snob and can be quite critical. It's all to blame on where I grew up and the quality of pie I was surrounded by - obviously taken for granted for years until I moved to the southwest.

The manager was very nice. Everyone working here was really nice, too. Our server was attentive and checked in on us a few times. 

We had a small meatball pizza and a small ham calzone, which came with marinara sauce (we had leftovers). Our picky eater son loves the pizza, as a matter of fact, it is our family's favorite pizza! We never got the calzone before, but man, it was yummy- cooked perfectly, not mushy, not overfilled, just right. Why did we wait so long to try it? Because we love the meatball pizza! I'm almost forgetting to mention the pizza, what am I talking about? It's always good here!

Some years ago, I saw this place on Food Wars and instantly became a fan. We've been coming to Grimaldi's since our son was a baby, he's five years old. Oh, and our son stuck to the pizza, didn't even try the calzone. (True story, once we were stopping to purchase gift cards, our son insisted on getting pizza trying hard to yank me inside, but we had already eaten dinner.)

Our go-to's: Caprese Salad and Margarita pizza with the basil added at the end and request for ""light cook"". The light cook makes for a softer & palatable crust. Since the crust is so thin, it tends to get hard or even burn a little during the cooking process so we always ask for ""light cook"".

The decor is pretty much New York themed. I like that they have Marilyn Monroe's photos and a few other things like the subway map, and various other b&w photos of NYC.

I was advised that their regular pepperoni is good, so the next time around when we went back, we gave it a stab, and this simple Pepperoni with jalapeño pizza was much better. 

I wish they put in a tad bit more tomato sauce in their pizza, but I definitely like the thickness of they crus (thin and crispy on the bottom). I've been here several times to dine-in, but the lats time when i got it to-go, the cheese on the pizza had hardened by he time I got home (10 minutes?).

Food: The crust on their pizza = perfection! If you're a dipper like me - Grimaldi's doesn't have ranch dressing, but I've found their casear dressing works great as a dip for the pizza crust.

We asked for the dough for our daughter to play with, and for a carafe of wine, neither of which we received until asking about 3 times for them. We asked her to box the last couple of slices we had, and started to worry after about 10 mins of time passing and still not having the box. We asked her for it a few times, and finally she had to bring the manager over to tell us they had to make us another pizza because she didn't know what happened to ours. We didn't need a whole other pizza, just wanted to stop being lied to about what was going on (her response the couple times we asked was ""oh yeah, I'll be right back with the box"").

For some reason, tonight I wanted to try Grimaldi's (mostly because I read on here their cheesecake was really good, and I wanted cheesecake!) so we braved the horrible parking lot and went in.  It was a Friday night, and for some reason the Hooters next door is always slammed, leaving no parking spots. 
I am glad I dragged my bf out of the house, because we were so impressed!  The decor was nice, and gave lots of historic NYC pictures to look at while eating, and I loved the wine glass chandeliers.  But the food was the star tonight. It could have been a hovel, and I still would have given it 5 stars.
We started with a small ceasar salad to share, and I almost ate the fork trying to eat it as fast as I could. The dressing we was perfect for me.  
I wanted a white pizza with artichokes and chicken, but the bf wanted sausage - only sausage.  But I added mushrooms and sun-dried tomatoes, just because I could.  I am glad I did!  The sun-dried tomatoes were sweet, and the sausage a bit salty and spicy and the mushrooms were full of flavor. Each bite was full of different flavors, which I loved and part of why I normally dislike pizza - as it's normally all just one flavor.   
As for the crust - I actually ate it!  I don't eat crust on bread, pizza, most pies...etc - and I still ate this crust.  It was that good!
When it came to dessert, even though they had cannoli's, I knew I was getting cheesecake.  I was thinking about Strawberry cheesecake all night, but our waiter said to get the Oreo cheesecake.  I took his recommendation, holding him responsible if it sucked.  He was right!  It was great!  My boyfriend got the cannoli, and while it was great - we agreed my cheesecake was better!

I have eaten at Grimaldi's in the past at Boca Park and I really, really enjoyed it. There were a few kinks to my experience at this one on Rainbow that has me kind of weary of trying it again.

When we first entered there was an odd smell to the air, kind of like there might be an open sewer line somewhere, but also a possibility of leakage somewhere in the restaurant due to recent rains. Either way - no good.

We were escorted to our table and ordered waters with lemon and the Caprese Salad to start. Tomatoes were incredibly fresh and meaty, paired with big chunks of mozz and fragrant basil. Drizzled with olive oil, this was a nice starter.

Our pizza: We ordered the white pizza, with extra cheese, spicy sausage, pepperoni, mushrooms, and tomatoes. Maybe this is where we went wrong -- to me the combo was a bit too much. 

The crust was thin and crispy, but really chewy, more chewy than I would like. Hard to pull away from with just your teeth and/or hands, and hard to cut with a fork and knife. I was grinding my knife down into it and making those scratchy sounds against my plate.

The place is cute, but I thought the wall decor was kind of tacky, it also is very vacant-looking so there isn't a really nice ""homey"" feel to it you might expect at a pizza joint.

I had a ricotta, pepperoni, artichoke hearts, and mushroom pizza on marinara sauce and it was delicious.  They also have house bread (though it's not advertised).  Apparently they have an amazing pumpkin cheesecake during the Fall but I was too stuffed from the pizza to try... but you should!!!",DMtVkV1K2DPimItj9xUfjw,0,0,5,b52SnndhZ3HqQJ-tW1uRrw

The setting is very fitting and had a nice vibe to the place loved the decor. Our waitress was nice and always checked on us. We ordered a small spinach salad and the 16"" Don pizza. I loved the salad, it was just enough for the two of us and the dressing was just right not too much and not too little best salad ever thanks to the waitress who said we should try it and it was her favorite! The pizza was really good but when it finally came to our table I didn't get to eat a lot because my appetite was gone, after we finished our salad we waited about 20-30 mins for our pizza. Plus I'm the type of person that eats ranch with their pizza so when I asked for a side dip of ranch our waitress said they don't have ranch but that they get a lot of requests for it. If a lot of people are requesting a certain item I think the restaurant should provide it.
So overall a very good restaurant service and food, it was a busy night but next time I think I'd have to eat my salad slow and prepare my own ranch to dip m pizza in.",5a1ZjTz1YRDjZunN4obH6Q,0,0,4,RogGB-wFNRzV_TIfSViE2g

When I first visited Grimaldi's I read the reviews here on Yelp and I'm like yeah, right, whatever. This review covers 3 visits. And all 3 experiences were consistent in being excellent each time. Service is impeccable. The decor is nice. But who cares about that. They have a coal fired oven, and they dang sure know how to use it. Each pizza I've had came out with these little faint, whispery smoke trails on the crust from that oven, and that crust was so good I didn't leave any of it behind. Not once. The toppings are fresh, flavorful, and good. When the pizzas came out they looked like works of art, literally the visual appeal and then the aroma delights the senses. But a couple of bites in and you will understand...

Pricey? You bet. Worth it? In my opinion absolutely yes. Will I go back? Without a doubt. Is it the best pizza in Las Vegas? Settebello gives them competition, and I've got more exploring to do but so far from what I've found Grimaldi's is going to be hard to beat. It's worth the time to seek this place out. Don't let the upscale strip mall location scare off you out of towners.this is worthy of taking a cab ride off the strip to check out. 5 Stars...Earned and given without any hesitation.",HEvyblFw4I-UsMqgPGYY_Q,2,1,5,4kRA8x_N4z_IQvrkAZGf5A

As Grimaldi's is right next to Hooters (we were looking for wings and pizza type of thing) we popped by Hooters..got our wing on...and then walked the 40 feet to Grimaldis...
It looked like pretty typical pizzeria decor...but with a full bar (and some good Sonoma wines as well)...Ordered up some pizzas..We got an XL sausage, pepp, garlic...
It was some of the better thin crust pizza I'd had!

Never tried a coal fired place...I always ask for crispy crust, but for some reason I didn't this time as I've heard coal fired pizza pie is crispier than most due to oven temp...Well it was crispy, and totally delicious! 

The very professional and courteous waitress brings our pie out and instantly (before the pie hit the table mind you) offered up her apologies saying that this particular pie wasn't up to their standards at Grimaldis..but she brought it anyway as she knew we were hungry (despite my 5 wings and cold beers ala Hooters). 
She went on to explain that they noticed there was a hole in the pizza, and that a whole new pizza was being prepped right then..No one at the table even had a chance to notice the hole..and they already were replacing it!

We all ate our fill, and then voila...a fresh, delicious pizza hit the table. 
We had 1/2 of a pizza for snacks on the long drive home to Sonoma county!! 

Not only was it completely great pizza...the staff and management exhibited the highest level of professionalism, courtesy, and commitment to offering up only a superior product...In an area filled with all manner of culinary delights..from ridiculously expensive, to $10 buffets...well, this place earned my business EVERY time I get to Vegas...Eat here for great pie, great service, and great memories!

Went there with 4 kids, and very friendly and competent waiter brought them small rounds of dough with a pizza pan.  What a great, simple idea.  The dough occupied all children (ages 3-9) the entire meal.  THey made fake pies, desserts, etc.  Next, I could not choose between two white wines and waiter described them like he knew them and then offered me a taste of each. Wow.  Again, very simple and inexpensive for the restaurant, but meant so much to me.  They won me over at this point.  Again, when I was thinking of a red wine to have with pizza, he gave me a taste of a delicious blend from Paso Robles.  Pizzas were good.  We had two, both with red sauce.  One with sausage, the other with meatballs, ricotta and garlic on half, the other half being olives and mushrooms.  Tasty and fresh.  Sauce is a little sweet and not herbified with oregano or thyme.  People can endlessly argue about pizza styles, sauce, etc., and I am one them, and, I can say a sweeter sauce is usually not my style, but I found the sauce pretty good.  The crust was a littler thicker then I expected, but was cooked until dark and crispy.  Overall a B+ pizza.  The garden salad was $5 and was fresh and big enough for me and my two kids.  I did not eat dessert, but friends said cheesecake very good.  This is a solid place with great customer service.",78hoKKvZeN0mGSyH_0xVGA,0,0,5,uqAf2ON-lYPS2_iyjdc-Aw

2,500 miles away from the original location under the Brooklyn Bridge and I walk in to Dean Martin singing with the smells of pizza cooking.  That's Vegas baby.  Truth is, nothing can replicate the smell of walking into the original Grimaldi's.  There it almost knocks you down, and I'm not kidding.  Perhaps it's that you have to wait outside in line to get a seat, weather be damned.  You earn your pizza there.  But here on a Saturday night at 7 pm we walked right in.  More proof that people have to get away from the strip to enjoy some great food.

I love that they kept the pizza prep area the same as the original Grimaldi's - a square work area with a coal brick oven taking up the back wall.  Open to the restaurant so you can sit there and watch them put on a little show and fantasize if that that's your pizza they are working on or not.  They start with hand tossing the dough here, which is becoming a lost art, because I'm seeing more and more press machines being used for dough.  Then some of their signature tomato sauce and fresh mozzarella.  The fresh mozzarella is the key here.  It's slices rather than shredded.  I noted in my review at the original Grimaldi's that they deal the mozzarella like playing cards all over the pizza.  Well even though it's Vegas and that analogy works better here, they were a lot slower and each slice was more carefully placed on the pie.  I guess in New York they've made so many pizza's that those guys can make 'em in their sleep.  This location is fairly new, so you can't expect them to be working at that speed yet.

We ordered a pie with a whole lot of toppings and each was excellent except the shredded fresh basil.  Unfortunately they put the basil on when they are cooking the pie and the result was burnt leaves on the pizza.  So if you are going to order basil, make sure you ask for it to be added after the pie is cooked.  The pepperoni had a nice spice to it.  The meatballs were sliced real thin and had so much flavor.  The sausage was crumbled, and while I prefer sliced sausage on my NY pie, this is good stuff and you won't be disappointed.  The onions and mushrooms were sliced thin enough to totally cook on the pie.  The roasted red peppers were a little different than the original Grimaldi's, they were chopped up into smaller pieces, which I think was a good thing.  That way you got a little taste of the marinated red peppers in each bite.

Now the problem with getting a lot of toppings here is you really pay for it.  Toppings are $2 each with a few being $4.  We had $18 in toppings!!!.  Oh well, we're on vacation, but if you eat here regularly you might have to make choices of what you want on your pie.  I remember the same thing happened in New York, I got the bill for 2 and it was like $50.  For pizza.  LOL But so good!  The only thing I didn't think was quite as good as the Original Grimaldi's was the dough.  I don't know what it is, but once you stop using that New York drinking water for your dough, it's never the same.  But we ain't in New York, and this is still a 5 star pie.",Bt6gmjnWHPERhiOTQOhuEA,11,9,5,4qi9tpyJVVHKVetV9mPLdw

5048532,2011-04-04,3,LpGCzgAKNSpzDNEUMVVtZA,"Came for lunch with my BF and his friend. 

We shared:

Antipasto plate ($12)- salami, olives, fresh mozzarella, roasted garlic red peppers, bread.  Pretty good, but antipasto is pretty standard. 

Pizza with mushrooms and meatball (lrg- $14, + 4 for toppings) - the meatball was more thin sliced onto the za than mini rounds I was expecting. It was pretty good thin crust for a chain. It was crispy with good char on the bottom, but a bit chewy and the sauce was good. Apparently they recreate the conditions of the Brooklyn water to get the crust right. The only drawback is the large size- it means I need to plan for friends to come along if I want some Grimaldi's.

Our server was friendly, personable and attentive. Our server asked if we want a bit of greens to go with it (doesn't come with it and no charge for some if you want it) and brought that out with some vinaigrette and that did help the antipasto be better. Our drinks were kept up on and we were checked on throughout. 

It was my first time at a Grimaldi's and I think I like this. There's one closer to our house so I think I'm gonna head to that one.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,4,5,4,t3hyUGB4gSSC6QLkTlVVqg
5051838,2012-03-31,0,LpGCzgAKNSpzDNEUMVVtZA,"Can I say YUM???  This was the cheapest and the best meal I had in Las Vegas.   

Grimaldi's features pizza and salads.   I got a large pepperoni pizza.  It was enough for my husband and I to eat the entire thing (we were starving though).   If you weren't that hungry you'd have a couple of slices for leftovers the next day.   The crust is to die for.   Crispy, thin, and oven baked.    The cheese and sauce is on key.   

Caesar salad was good but I wish I would have tried the Mediterranean.  The dressing was missing a key ingredient (anchovies).     

Never ending refills on the soda.   We had a very nice waitress and busboy who checked in on us often but not so much that it was annoying.   It was nice to encounter employees who are happy at their jobs.   

We also sat outside and it was very clean and inviting.   

Total bill was less than 35 dollars for two people.

About once a month I'll suddenly get a craving for this pizza!  I think I'd have to say this is my favorite pizza joint in Las Vegas.
 
Their house salad is tasty - a small is good enough for two people.  You get to choose your toppings and type of pizza.  I like to go for the normal red sauced pizza with sausage and mushrooms. I normally don't even like sausage on my pizza's but for some reason, it's really good here!  A medium pizza is probably good for two people, but we always get a large and finish it all.  Can't get enough!  Their sauce is boss and I love that they give you garlic powder on the side.  The pizza is normally never soggy (I've only had that happen to me once).  It still didn't deter me away from this place.
 
I have to admit that the pizza here is slightly expensive - I wish each additional topping wasn't so much.

It just tastes a wee bit different! Just be careful because toppings range in price $2-4 and are extra!! So don't try and break your bank with all those toppings, unless you have lots of $$$ (unlike me) 

The large size is big with huge slices; it's a nice treat to share and split the bill between friends ;) 

Also, their cheesecakes are the best in town! Butterscotch and Oreo are the bomb!!

Something about the hard water here makes the pizza crust tough, and in NY they have soft water? ANYWAYS, he loves it, so I guess that means they are doing something right.

Service is great! The manager has stopped by a few times to ask us how everything is. The menu is simple, we always get a Large Sausage/Mushroom. The pizza sauce is tangy, and flavorful! They use fresh mozzarella instead of processed. You can tell their ingredients are high quality. We have also tried their Small House Salad - totally big enough for 2 people to share - it's fresh, and crisp, and exactly what a salad should be. Also try their Antipasto plate, it's amazing as well.

Salad- just a salad, nothing special.

Apparently she thought we already paid... turns out, she charged someone else's card for our pizza.  It was a MESS.  It's always like this.

It is a truly authentic pizza. The coal fire bakes a crisp crust that you can't replicate in an oven.  The fresh ingredients and high quality cheese are the best.  

It's my favorite pizza outside of NYC.  I suggest the white pie with grilled chicken and fresh tomatoes and a traditional pie with your favorite toppings.  Add a caesar salad for good measure.

They have a half-indoor, half-outdoor bar that offers a great vista of the TV. It was the perfect spot for catching the Olympics. And, our bartender, Kurt, was a super nice fella. Plus, Tuesday nights are half-price wine, so I had a delicious red blend for $3.50/glass! On pure barability (just made up a word), this is an A+ hang. 

The small house salad is enough for two if you're getting pizza, and it is simple, fresh and topped with a nice, tart dressing. 

But the pizza on this night was not on. The toppings were definitely fresh, but they don't come cheap. For a large pizza with two toppings, it is at least $20. For me, that leaves me expecting a nice, gourmet pizza experience. The crust was neither tasty nor a texture hit; it was just chewy, and we weren't compelled to eat the entire crust.

Maybe if you combined the mushrooms from both of them you could've actually had enough for one. There was a decent amount of onions so no complaints there.

My wife and I can wolf down one of their pizzas with ease if that gives you any idea as to how filling they are, they aren't.

She went to explain to me the dough is handmade and fresh daily. (Ok not impressive I thought) Then she went on to explain the importance of this place. She passionately told the story of how Grimaldi's hired a chemist to create a water system that makes exactly ""New York"" water. It's a $50,000 water system. She then went to explain the simplicity of the menu. It's authentic Italian pizzeria. She said they are so authentic down to their choices. She gave me her top three choices of salad. She sold me on her passion and knowledge of this place. I still didn't care for the simplicity of the menu... until I tasted my Mediterranean salad. YUM! It was simple. Full of flavor. I ordered the Garden pizza with sausage and pepperoni. (I love veggies) It was good. Our server asked us later how things tasted and I told her the truth about my pizza and I felt it was a little watery from the tomatoes. She didn't hesitate to say, ""Can I have them remake the pizza for you?"" I definitely declined because it was delicious just a little watery. But I knew why. Either way it was good. And there was no way I could have this remade. I was satisfied! I told her I would be doing desert. But gotten full and changed my mind. Due to my first time being there and my pizza not 100% (but 95%) to my liking... they comped me a cheesecake. TALK ABOUT INITIATIVE. Vince was the manager and he came out to greet us. I felt extremely special and I would like to thank the staff whom served us at Grimaldi's. As I will go back. What a warm wonderful place to bask in.

Pepperoni Pizza-  spicy with curled edges!
Extra Sauce - crushed tomatoes in Brooklyn
Extra fresh basil - ""trust me Joshua you'll know!""

Pesto Pizza - nice change

Calzone - red sauce with at least mushrooms

Dont's
Just one topping... Don't over think it!  At Grimaldi's less is more.  Go single topping on pizzas...focus on the simplicity of the pie!

The pizza was blander than anything I had eaten at the other locations - the cheese seemed tasteless and the crust lacked the charred skirt that gives the trademark smoky flavor to the pie. I don't know if they just had an off day or if they're doing something differently at this location, but whatever it is, it ain't working.

When in all reality I had no clue.  Well guess what suckas, I have a clue now.  

We decided to hit this location on a Sunday afternoon and grab what I have heard is the best pizza in town, I've heard that a lot and I'm not sure that I fully agree but it is definitely not due to a lack in quality or anything like that, it is just personal preference, I like thick pizza. Now lets be fair and look past the personal part of the review.  On to the pizza!!

The pizza for what it is advertised as is amazing, it is a very thin New York style pizza with fresh rounds of Mozzarella and whatever toppings you ask for. Not only is the pizza made with quality ingredients so are the salads. We ordered a salad to share and an antipasto appetizer and all of it was super fresh and crisp. I know that doesn't say too much when it comes to a salad and antipasto but trust me I have had mozzarella that was not so good before. 

Since we know that the pizza and appetizers were correct and fresh the service would be the next item of conversation. The server was great, keeping our drinks full and making sure that we had everything we needed and basically handing us a slap on the hand when we asked for Ranch... That look of we don't have ranch here was priceless. I guess the thought of me defacing a true slice of New York Pizza would have put me on the goombas hit list. 

I would definitely recommend this place to anyone that is a fan of thin New York Pizza, but it leaves me on the hunt for a great slice of Chicago style pizza.",sqJZt_Z144RWGk4bdKTpSw,2,1,5,QtF8x_EakmVfzwHbokLDFA

The pizza is outstanding thin crust New York style. The toppings were excellent, the sauce was fantastic, sweet and savory at the same time and the price wasn't bad either. Despite being a little worried about their brick ovens being coal fired and what that might do to the crust, it makes the crust the best part of the pizza and the whole pie simply amazing.

Theres only a couple places in vegas i go to for pizza and grimaldis is one of them. I like the food and this has been my go to pizza place for a while. This review isn't about the food, its about the service at this particular location.

20 minutes for a waiter to visit our table. Had to ask the hostess twice for the server.

Server seemed stoned and didn't acknowledge his extreme tardiness. Had the impression that it was a joke to him to be bothered by us.

Server took our drink and meal order - and did nothing else for the entire meal. Wondered why we should be tipping somebody for doing the bare minimum of their job and not even doing that well.

Took 15 minutes for the bill to be collected and we had to flag down a random waiter who had to get the manager to run it. The manager was standing behind us (we were the closest table to the expediting window) and never offered to ask us if everything was ok. 

Our waiter had only a couple other tables and we went at a non peak time (less than 1/3 of the tables were seated). The bar has been reduced to only beer and wine so our confusion exists as to what the heck somebody could be doing for all this other time. Also, they did not appear to be under staffed since several time we looked over at the bar and noticed 3-4 servers hanging out, talking, and not urgently taking care of their tables. 

Will never be going to this location again. I could probably just as easily go to a gas station pizza hut and get better service if that's all i was looking for in a pizza joint. Looks like Duo Forni is my new go to pizza place!",3EPBhYWMcglaqhJYgcofHg,0,0,1,KABIoojRaRlol12AJGu6Sg

Watching the pizza makers toss and spin the dough, one handed even, until it was just right, then sliding it into a Pennsylvania coal fired pizza oven just lead to a mouth watering wait.

We will have to go back to try more of the toppings, and will likely only go to this location, as the service stood out.

Tonight, I visited this location as I have on many Mondays.  For the football season, they have had a 2 for 1 large 2 topping pizza special.  This is week 14 and I have been here for about half of the Mondays.  I have the same routine...we pick up our daughter from the bus stop and head to Grimaldi's.  Today, the server stated he did not know about the special and that he does not usually work on Monday.  I thought that was a bit strange, but just attributed that lack of knowledge about a special that has been in place for 3 1/2 months, was just poor communication.  He was friendly enough and said he would check with the manager.  No matter, I had called an hour before and made sure they were still running the special.  Soon a young blond woman approached the table and asked if we had a question.  We stated that we asked the server about the special and he didn't know about it.  She said that it was not available until 5:00.  I asked if we would be able to get it because we have many other times before and did not know about the time restriction.  She said that they should not have honored it in the past and did not offer to honor it this time.  It was 4:15 and we were told that it was going to be 30 minutes wait for them to stoke the oven, which we were willing to wait for.  We always order the same thing, a large salad, 2 large pizzas, 3 drinks and whatever cheesecake sounds good that day.  She was willing to let that business walk out the door, plus many other future visits over what...15 min?

Anyway, Girmaldi's is close by and I figured hey I remember the pizza's not being half bad I'll pick one up to go. First I had no idea if they did pizza to go, idk why I thought that I guess because I've always eaten there. 

I called and said can I ask a silly question? Do you have pizza's togo? I felt so dumb, but the girl on the other line snickered  and said of course we do I get asked that a lot. I'm sure she was just trying to make me feel better. I ordered sausage, onion, mushroom, and peppers (my favorite combo). She said it would be 20 mins, I don't remember the exact total but I know it was under $25, not bad IMO. 

I got it home and it was good it didn't get soggy or anything like I feared. My husband doesn't always want pizza but when he does now I have a go to place. Now if only they had wings! =D",UJ4uCYEppIIo9IRGMx5E1A,1,3,4,IupHgwa-zcEyen0ZU8Cw_g

5792538,2013-11-13,1,LpGCzgAKNSpzDNEUMVVtZA,"I can't.  I've been here three times now and each pizza I had was not good.  This time around was such a disappointment, I had to yelp.  

First off, the prices here are beyond ridiculous and I cannot justify the price because the pizzas are far from being tasty.  The menu is ""build your own"" and comes in three sizes- 12, 16, and 18 inches, and priced based on that along wit the bread/sauce (few bucks more if you opt for pesto or white pizza, etc.).  Then you tack on an extra $2-$4 for each additional topping you want.  Now that's a bit excessive to me, but I'll fork out the cash if the food is worth it.

I ordered a 16inch pizza topped with pesto, ricotta, anchovies, sun dried tomatoes, and jalapeño on 1/2 of the pizza.  The pizza came out sooooooo dry!  Barely any sauce, and the cheese they topped it off with (buffalo) was so hard and rubbery, it was inedible.  The anchovies had such an over powering taste of salt- had to pick them off.  I was expecting the ones soaked in vinegar, thinking it'd add a nice tangy taste.  The jalapeños were sliced so thick I had to pick those off too.  I love jalapeños on my pizza, but they've got to be sliced nice and thin in order for it to be good.  The waiter forgot to add the ricotta cheese so that was kinda lame.

The check came out to $30 for one pizza.  Such a waste of money.  Forced myself to eat it, but basically threw $4 worth of toppings out the window cause I picked them off my pizza.  Moreover, I had jalapeños put on 1/2 the pizza.  Why didn't I get charged 1/2 the price? Haha.  I'm open to ALL TYPES OF PIZZA: thin crust, thick crust, stuffed crust, deep dish, etc. etc., the pizza they serve here is thin crust, little sauce, extra dry, with sporadic pieces of rubbery cheese placed throughout.  The very basic foundation of a pizza does not meet my expectations here so I won't be back, there are other pizza places in LV I'd rather spend my money at.",ywI6YzxkoKyKC2JV4_19Sg,0,0,2,Ndte0bRct-RXxsPO2KbWRQ

We ordered a medium barbecue chicken pizza and a medium pepperoni and red peppers!  Wow!  They are quite pricey for pizza.  The barbecue chicken was $23.00!  It was flavored okay, not much sauce and the chicken was mushy.  Toppings are $2-4 each.  Red peppers were $4.  The pepperoni pizza had nice flavor, but again sauce was sparse,  Restaurant was bright with a nice bar, but pizza was lackluster.  
Service was mediocre.  
We probably won't return at these prices, unless we are offered a deep discount.  bill was $54. For 2 medium pizzas, 1 soft drink and 1 beer.

The staff is top notch and always on top of your order, your drinks and able to give recommendations.  The last time I was here I took my out of towners here for lunch telling them this is my favorite spot.  My buddy told me I was building it up so well in their minds they were going to be so disappointed with the experience if they didn't live up to what I was saying.  I never thought of it like that and was nervous as we sat down. 

We ordered a salad and split it amongst three people; a large pizza and when it was sat before us my friends both smiled ear to ear and said WOW! That is an incredible pizza; I said wait till you taste it and they both instantly melted into their seats with satisfaction. 

The outdoor seating is comfortable;  the bar staff is very nice and they make small talk very well if you let them but will respect your space if you are watching the tv or playing on your mobile device.

I haven't been anywhere this good yet. For me, as a poor college student, it's expensive but I looked up authentic New York style pizza and this place came up. Awesome place. The table cloth you usually see that is red and white squared at restaurants is plastic but this place uses real cloth, AUTHENTIC. The food is quick. 

This place actually wowed me. I usually get carry out for pizza from pizza chains, but this is far from a pizza chain. Pizza chains like papa johns, little cesars, Domino's, Pizza hut use ingredients that are chopped and small. For example, the big four DO NOT use SLICED tomatos, they DICE them. Grimaldi's SLICES tomatos AND onions, slices are about 2-2.5 in long, the big four uses chopped onion about 1/4 in long, aka budget cuts.

Their pizzas are incredibly HUGE. They charge for additional toppings which can add up BUT WHO THE HELL CARES!!!! THIS PLACE IS FAMILY OWNED AND QUALITY!!!!",j7SH8LM1L8eExP2AO71UbA,0,0,5,u05R92_Gktj3LA0CglMPgg
5885078,2012-06-06,0,LpGCzgAKNSpzDNEUMVVtZA,"I found this place using Yelp ;) It had the best reviews and there was one close by our timeshare on the south end of the strip. There are 5 Grimaldi's locations in Las Vegas. We called in a carry out order at the Rainbow St. location. At this location they have parking spaces assigned for carry out, you pull up and they bring out your order ......
very convenient.

I never had coal brick before (none where I live) so I don't have anything to compare it too but that doesn't change this fact that this pizza was DELICIOUS!!! I believe the best I ever had. I'm a total pizza junkie.... HONESTLY, I can eat it daily (but I don't) it was thin, crispy and not greasy at all! The ingredients were very fresh & it was cooked to perfection. Our family ordered 2 large pizzas, one pepperoni and the other pepperoni, jalapenos & mushroom. 

My only complaint was they put very little mushrooms on our pizza and for $2.00 per topping I expected more mushrooms. All the other topping were fine just very short on the mushrooms. I thought the price was fair although I think that $2.00 per topping is a bit steep. We kept our pizza pretty basic because it can add up fast. It came to about $50.00 for 2 pizzas, as expected for ""restaurant quality"" pizza. I'm a firm believer in ""You get what you pay for"". If you're looking for GREAT not good pizza then this is the place. I'm sad they don't have one in Cali but I will come back..................

The cheese on it isn't the shredded mozza kind but seems to be either bigger slices or balls that are put on the pizza and melted sporadically.  The pepperoni were really small slices and looked to be freshly cut.  It's more Neapolitan style than anything else.

Some of the pizza seemed to have some sort of seasoning on it.  All of those bites were really good, but the ones without it and no pepperoni weren't as tasty.  The crust is pretty great, I actually ate it instead of just tossing it out.  Would probably order again.",YcaO4xCNgt123pNHsJkS_Q,0,1,4,3CSi_ok4ldCxwPsWKdLqtQ

Finally made it to the newest (and yes, closest to me) Grimaldi's location. I'll probably be frequenting this location much more often in the near the future. 

This was my first time ordering pizza for carryout at Grimaldi's and I have to say it's much better to eat the pizza hot and fresh straight from the coal oven! It was just as good as always, but I missed the right out of the oven taste that Grimaldi's has. It's just better that way. Once the pizza starts cooling down, the consistency isn't at it's peak, but it's still deslish.

I have deprived myself of Grimaldi's for quite some time, so I have to say I was extremely happy with my pizza. As always, the white with ricotta and sun dried tomatoes as well as the pepperoni are my favorites. Not as big a fan of the calzones. They have some ferocious salads as well, but I usually ask them to go lighter on the oil since they are typically heavy-handed.
