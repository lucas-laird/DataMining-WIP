1329365,2016-09-13,0,M85y1RfSCyWZkWR-18YU1Q,I live 2 minutes away from this location and I rather drive further for another location. Every time I come here I always get attitude from the employees! It's ridiculous. One time they burnt my bread and they wouldn't give me a new one. They don't make their sandwiches with love.,kFSCdzz6WuL4UWt6jGi0-g,0,0,1,xXKCrg2jFXNrZKAElgRXHw
1355130,2018-02-09,0,M85y1RfSCyWZkWR-18YU1Q,Not a bad joint. Came at lunch so it was busy but my order was completed within 5 minutes of being there. Friendly people. Yeah it's in the ghetto and yes there is allot of ghetto trash who go here but overall I would come in here again for a quick lunch from work. Wouldn't want to come here with my kids or wife tho.,lmUfyDJnhgcYp-biuOffvw,0,0,3,yqvAwNkI_0AmRbwoUequxw

Ordered a veggie sub and the guy put 2 pickles, 3 olives, 1 green pepper....I had to ask him to put more of all, I mean....it's a $5 VEGGIE sub. I should have sprung for the poke bowl next door!!",DuSuoUQwsXjgvvslwfsL3g,0,0,2,AhWwc_zK6hfCc25RODMUvg

2348769,2012-05-05,0,M85y1RfSCyWZkWR-18YU1Q,I have been coming here for years. Probably at least 20 years. It's right around the corner from my parents' house. It's always clean and the employees are friendly.,wc4XAA5pC3b1UgooSypHwA,1,1,3,PG8Ah6vqaQyJndgVUhp8rg

The floors have not been swept in who knows how long. Maybe instead of being on the phone, she should sweet. I'll never come back here. I hate shitty service.",yL3lP2HkmrObGDOrfYnjXg,0,0,1,dCOzldipGE5cVMG5cDn3sw

Now it seems that 'when convenient' neither of the ladies can speak English. We arrived to an EMPTY store and both ladies were PREMAKING well over a dozen sandwiches (it was 11 a.m.) When I asked to order a sandwich one lady simply looked at me, took off her gloves and walked out to her car in the parking lot!!! The other lady just shrugged... I again asked to order a single sandwich and the remaining lady just pointed to all of the half prepped sandwiches covering the entire counter and pointed to the other employee out at her car!!! After well more than 5 minutes the parking-lot-lady returned, did NOT wash her hands but did put on new gloves and asked what I wanted. When she was cutting the sandwich bread (I wanted a 6"") she was facing the other lady and I was being given a half that was no where near 6"" so I asked for the other half she had just cut off!!! She ignored me and started to make my sandwich so I asked again waving my hands and saying that I wanted the other/larger half and she shrugged and kept working. After my THIRD request I told her to keep the sandwich and I went to Port O Subs. I came back in and asked when the store owner/manager would be in and got another shrug. Try some place else!!!",2MD4ENOYEAmxLfD5TLRGNg,0,0,1,X0HH4x_Yq9gr5ll0I78_aw

I hope the management and owner improve this situation because it seems normal here.",a0oYnZkrVmCsPtcjmoCgJA,0,0,1,nv-vtVubyBayKU539AkEMw

She didn't wear a hairnet, but that didn't bother me as much as being rude. I ordered three sandwiches and after explaining what I wanted she said I was confusing her, she had a big attitude. She would give dirty looks and could tell she was losing patience. At this point we were both irritated. My sandwiches were really messy and the place was unsanitary. I didn't get her name but she had red hair. I was really upset with the service.",yJn_2TtUmKfo4rtwkBKpOQ,0,0,1,Jag6eSokbD_ESCqNRRKkRg
