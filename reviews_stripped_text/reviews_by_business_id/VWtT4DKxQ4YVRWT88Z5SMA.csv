I love their red ceramic cups that they use ""for here"". The feel of the place reminds me of Starbucks in terms of layout and the fact that the baristas are wearing headsets... that just totally changes the vibe of a place for me, it feels more plastic and less genuine. It was a very business like and efficient transaction. If you are looking for an indie coffee shop with soul, this isn't your place.",5nT2wVPH6tl_Ai4ArmTNxw,0,0,3,Q3OjjSEwOulmXJ5VEKdVjw

It's located on Jones just off of the 215 next to Tropical Smoothie and near Sierra Gold/Kyara. Small inside but ample outdoor seating with shade. Working drive through for those on the go. 

Baristas here are awesome and are very consistent. I've had my drinks taste very milky at the other location but here, my drinks have been a perfect balance between coffee and milk. I always opt for the nutella latte, nutella cappucino, or chocolate cappucino with almond milk. Heads up, their shots of espresso ""are large enough that they count as two""-according to the baristas. No tall, grande, ventis here-size availabilities are 12 oz for hot drinks and 12 oz or 16 oz for the iced lattes. 

If you get one of their cards, after 15 drinks, your next is free. My only complaint is that your tab can rack up here. Their drinks and pastries get pretty pricey.",Ucn8yabLDIiDasbLkNy0Ng,3,3,4,jTbr9ECm59PFnVxYOlNwHw
93956,2015-03-27,0,VWtT4DKxQ4YVRWT88Z5SMA,"Very disappointed in my two visits to this location.  Premium prices (almost 5 bucks for a 12 oz. coffee) demand excellent service and a premium experience.  That is sadly not the case here.  The staff did not want to make one of the specialty coffees because it would take longer than just pouring a cup out of the big urn of house coffee.  Also, did not go through the effort to select a full size piece of biscotti.  I got a 3/4 size fragment at full price.  This order took more than 20 minutes to complete.  Another note: the to go cups they use impart an unpleasant taste an odor to the coffee.

Philosophically, I do not buy in to this new trend of complicated ways to make premium coffee.  I am also weary of lazy staff that will be untruthful about how long an urn of coffee has been sitting there.  A simple pour over with premium beans, fully roasted, clean water at the proper temperature is all that is required. 

 That said,  I have had better experiences at the Summerlin location, despite my old school biases.",cbTwzROTy9jYHzAx4N0WIg,0,0,1,zinM4RTzZr1faFJuR6st2A

They don't have to stay open until 2am (though I'd love it) but at least until 9 or 10pm like most other things in this area. Even Starbucks stays open that late one block away.

The customer service is what seems to be a hit or miss here. The morning I went in, the ladies looked less than happy to be there, and the foam on my latte was a bit off, weak and a few bubbles.  I was thrilled at the thought of a replica of the Summerlin location coming to the South end of Vegas, but unfortunately when places expand, they often lose sight of their originality and all the important facets entailed in what makes an awesome caf√©. This is what has happened here. But it's not too late! Bottom line for this locale: hire better help, like the technical and friendly, passionate baristas you have in Summerlin, and given that this isn't in a ritzy neighborhood like Summerlin, they should adjust their prices accordingly, especially with the competition they have in the area with Coffee houses.",1Re7UYDeZ0pdX-wX4GeRSw,3,0,3,zfORGZlTYVdWGx33-6oLfw

They have outside tables that you can sit and chat with your big group of friends and enjoy the summer heat. Oh well you know fall in coming, enjoy the best weather in Vegas at this time of the year!

I love Nutella and their Iced Nutella latte is my favorite for summer coffee. I used to order Nutella cappuccino when the weather was colder. Oh don't forget to try matcha if you like milk greentea. They also have smoothies, and my fav here is Acai smoothie which is a Brazilian berry. 

Desserts are good but a little pricy. If you like sweet, chocolate crunch is awesome. 

The staffs here are awesome and friendly. When they are busy, it might be a little slow. But give them times. You don't come to a good coffee shop and rush to go somewhere. Come here and hang out. Have a good coffee with a great conversation with friends. Or put your headset on and study.

The service is VERY slow at the moment. It's understandable IF it was busy and if they're under staffed, but there's 5 people behind the counter 3 people in the coffee section and 2 cashiers. I found myself waiting there to be acknowledged, finally someone took my order and my coffee took forever to be made. It's because the baristas are just socializing talking about their plans for the night! Really?! Come on! I can hear you and see what you're doing or NOT doing! Then I ask the cashier about how much some of the pastries are and they respond with an ""I don't know."" At least have the employees know the prices of the small amount of pastries that they have at the top of their head! I'm going to give them a chance though because of the coffee!

1) Freezing inside, so you may opt for outside. But...
2) Proximity to freeway is not very soothing to listen to when outside....
3) The outside area lies between two buildings under a structure, so you are essentially in a wind tunnel, requiring you pay close attention to those napkins.
4) I'm an average size, 180 lbs guy, but these weird chairs they put out by the large table are very 'narrow' Which would be fine if it was a flat surface. But instead the ' center' part sinks into a bowl, leaving you to rest your weight on the two metal tubes wrapped in some burlap sack textile.

I wish their seats were more comfortable outside though. So straight and hard. (LOL..) Causing me to readjust my seating quite often. Aside from that, pretty good. 

When i was there, seemed like there were two guys working on building a table top?

Overflowed material was sprayed away onto the ground, making it difficult for some people to access Sambalatte from the side door.

I had the white mocha. Talk about some serious coffee artwork. I am sure we all take it for guaranteed go fancy coffee shop the little things. Like the foam on top not just scoop of foam.

Sure you have your pastry section, pre package sandwiches, and assortment of other bottle beverages.

I've had a few of their drinks so far and I liked them. For what they offered and what I had I liked them. I had the Nutella Latte, the White Mocha, the Caf√© Con Leche. I heard that they make some nice and creative designs in their drinks. I've only gotten the heart which was ok maybe I need to stop taking my drink to go and they'll do something nicer. 

It seems like I was a bigger fan of their pastries and food. Everything looked so good. I ordered the Ham and Cheese Croissant and really like it. It was warm, cheesy, and flakey. I'd order it again. I want to try one of their quiche as a meal and something on the dessert side next.

My brother and I both avid coffee drinkers were looking forward to having just a simple iced coffee but to our dismay they did not have any. Now we were not distraught enough to leave and not give them a chance we simply grabbed some iced americanos. I just found it odd for a coffee shop to not be prepared on a Monday morning in Las Vegas with such a simple staple to a coffee menu. With that in mind our drinks were great quality and the coffee did redeem our visit only sparingly.

The woman at the register was clearly new as she was asking questions of the other two baristas as she was ringing us up. This was the other situation I felt just simple was not handled well from the customer's point of view. I've been a barista trainer now for the better part of 5 years and as the trainer you are the bridge between customer and trainee and it is up to you to ensure the interaction goes well for both parties. As the customer we felt awkward the trainee was searching for buttons and you could sense that she was uneasy from our point of view and her fellow baristas did not come to her aide.

Unfortunately the cashier and the barista said they couldn't tell me anything about the iced coffee other than they pour it out of a bottle.

First off, I love the style and atmosphere in here; great colors and a seemingly inviting staff. Some of the prior reviews mention that the staff here can be polarizing and straight up rude. So I walked in ready for battle, but was greeted by a mustache and a smile... 

""Welcome to Sambalatte, you prick""... Did he say prick or am I manifesting previous reviews from my psyche into real life situations?... Calm down man, be cool. ""Good morning, I'll have an iced americano and that tasty looking nutella... scone?"", ""It's actually a biscotti you numbed skulled turd burglar""... WTF? Did he just say that outloud?... ""Is that it?""... ""Yeahhhh"" ... ""That'll be $7.35, you disgusting peasant""...

Every time I go here, the drink taste different. They don't have a standard for how many pumps of sweetener to put into the drinks I guess.

Also, they used to have a reward system (they still might have it), where you buy a certain number of drinks, you get one free. I purchased the same drink 10 or 12 (whatever the reward system was) times. When I got to my free drink, they charged me for flavoring the free drink since vanilla latte is not on the menu. The latte was free, not the vanilla!

I got a croissant and they don't heat it or anything. It was not fresh and couldn't believe they charge $4.25 for that.

Sambalatte is my coffee partner in crime, my sidekick, and probably the reason why I can't shed these few pounds. Le sigh. 

Speaking as the Duchess, I can tell you that Nutella lattes here are THE TRUTH. Their selection of local pastries are beautiful but on the pricey side. Muffins are an affordable solid choice and they have recently started carrying banana muffins along with their usual blueberry, chocolate, carrot, and bran choices. 

I come here so often that the baristas recognize my voice through the drive-thru speaker and introduce me personally to their new hires. My coworkers rarely see me walk through the door without a coffee in my hand and some even refer to me strictly as ""Sambalatte"" when they see me. It's gotten a little out of control lol.

Walked in here since I have been trying to get out of the house more often & being more productive w/ my day... saw on yelp that they had a pretty good review. 

I'm not much of a coffee drinker but I do like tea lattes! They seemed a bit busy when I came & the staff was running around a bit. They took my order & my drink was ready pretty quickly. Not so much of an actual cafe style since they don't deliver your drink to you but more like Starbucks style where you pick up your drink at the window.

The table areas are a bit small so I will have to say it would be hard to lay out all your study stuff or work & laptop stuff & your drink & be comfortable... 

MATCHA TEA LATTE $6.25 - it was SUPER green!! I like my green tea latte a little more creamy so this wouldn't be my favorite place to get it... but their design artwork is pretty ahahah. Also a bit on the expensive size. 

Overall it was a nice experience but wouldn't really say it would be a place I would choose to come back to on a daily basis.",x-8ZMKKNycT3782Kqf9loA,6,6,4,2-Zti5EVFDRGHgaO-e_m_g

Interior is very nice and spacious, yet maintains a sense of coziness. Decor is what you'd expect. 

The pastries are expensive. I guess it is normal for these types of places, but $8 for an ham n egg n cheese muffin is a bit much. With that said, it all looked delicious. 

Now to what I ordered. I have a chai latte. It was warm and not hot, which I don't really mind because I could drink it right away. But for those who like their drinks piping hot, you'll be disappointed. $5 for a chai latte is not something I'd do everyday, but when I'm in the mood for a fancy drink, I'll stop by again.

I drove 30 minutes for coffee. I was very eager to try it because of the rave reviews here on Yelp, and it did not disappoint. The cashier/barista was very friendly and our order was ready pretty quickly. My boyfriend and I both got a food item and a coffee. 

He had the ham and cheese croissant sandwich with a Tahitian Vanilla blended (frozen) latte. He was impressed with both of them. I tried his coffee and thought it was way too sweet for my taste but he likes his coffee extra sweet so it was a thumbs up for him.

I had the Veggie Quiche, and I really wasn't expecting to be blown away by their food because most of it is pre-made or pre-packaged, but this quiche...oh my god...this quiche. It is bomb. Very flavorful and fresh tasting with a perfect buttery flaky crust. And for the coffee, I had the Iced Nutella Latte. It was very good, no complaints here. It wasn't too sweet, it was just right and the coffee itself had great flavor.

Minor Complaints:

There food and certain beverages are absolutely outrageously priced! Yes, it's good food, but $8 for a ham and cheese sandwich? It better come with a side for 8 freaking dollars. Maybe give some fruit with it or something. We had 2 small food items and 2 large coffees, and our total was $27.50! Two people could eat at a restaurant for that much.

Now this part isn't necessarily Sambalatte's fault, but we got the DOUCHIEST VIBE from the people that were in there. Just seemed like everyone in there were a bunch of rich snobs and when we were leaving my boyfriend politely held the door open for a lady who was walking in and she gave him the dirtiest look and didn't even say thank you, she just said ""excuse me"" in a very bitchy tone. She acted like she didn't want him to even breath near her or something, it was just so rude.

All in all; if I'm on this side of town I will definitely come back for the coffee, I will have my order to go as I don't like the douchy hipster vibe it has, and although the food was good I probably won't buy food from here again because it was just too damn expensive.",IBfXie3My8uh8aYmynC3Sw,1,0,4,RkF6mCB_6QZBG_6_HMuucg

The biscotti came in a small little box, a little over kill for eating in, but it was nice, and it was quite good. it was perfect for dipping in the Americano and had a mild almond flavor and a great crunchy texture, but soaked up that rich Americano rather easily.

Due to current diet restrictions, I ended up with a double espresso over ice, and he got a latte. Coolest thing, she served his latte with a heart shape with the foam on top.

I spoke to the barista making it and he said that when you order it that way it brings out more flavors, which he's 100% right! The baristas are experience and I know this because they certainly pass the Cappuccino test. 

I love the selection of pastries as well. They have traditional, fancy, healthy salads and fruits, and sweets/desserts. They think about everyone and makes sure that anyone with any diet can come in and enjoy a nice breakfast or snack. It would be pretty embarrassing if you went somewhere to meet a friend and didn't offer something for both people's diets. 

The look inside is very comfortable and inviting. I love everything about this place. The owners knew EXACTLY what they were doing when they opened Sambalatte. :)",yXzEJJaSRLgXfCzCWxRWGg,2,2,5,HrWC-5cWuc6I8vrkqZG1XQ

It has everything you want from a coffee shop: coffee, tea, food, lots of indoor and outdoor seating, clean bathrooms, wifi, and even plenty of outlets for laptop users. 

Not so much in the coffee mood, I had two iced teas and a packaged Greek salad. I liked one iced tea more than the other, but they both came in large glasses to keep me refreshed for a long time. The salad was surprisingly fresh and tasty for sitting in a fridge. It was great to have a healthier alternative than the usual scones and cookies (which they have plenty of as well). 

Most impressive to me was the friendly service. The people who work there are happy to make suggestions, give you the wifi code, and won't give you the stink eye if you stay there a while.

Service and speed of delivery are still decent. However, my white mocha latte today was not. It tasted watered down and unsatisfying. Maybe it was just an off day.. but with all the craft coffee places opening up around town, a Las Vegas staple should not drop the ball given its increase in competition. 

I usually go through the drive through in the mornings but today decided to drop by since The Donut Bar was having a pop up shop. This was pretty cool.

It just tasted like black coffee with milky froth added to the top. I like black coffee but I ordered a Nutella cappuccino so I expected to at least taste some Nutella! So that's one star off of my rating. 

Certain drinks also come in one size so that's a bit of a down side for me. Now I repeat that I have never been to the other location so I don't know if they do it there too. There's another star taken off the rating.

4649960,2014-10-27,5,VWtT4DKxQ4YVRWT88Z5SMA,"This is by far the worst coffee I have had in Las Vegas. I would much rather go to an unnamed chain that can at least get my order correct.

I hesitated to try this location due to the poor experience I had in Summerlin a while back, but decided it was worth a shot. Unfortunately, this location was even WORSE! That's saying quite a lot considering there was a cockroach meandering around in their other location. 

I ordered a latte made with almond milk. They use Silk almond milk which is both too sweet and subpar to other brands. I would expect more from a $5.50 beverage. I decided to add a flavor and the only sugar free option was vanilla. Seriously? Vanilla as the only sugar free option? 

It took almost 10 minutes to get my latte, and when the barista called out my name and order, she mumbled something about extra steamed milk, but nothing about almond milk. After several comments back and forth, it was apparent my drink was made with regular milk. I am allergic to dairy and drinking what was served to me would have been disastrous.

I was finally served a new latte after the girl who took my order incorrectly blamed the mistake on me. Really? Come on... I did not change my order to almond milk at the end. Pretty sure I have a serious allergy and ALWAYS specify this multiple times. When I was given my replacement drink, it lacked the pretty heart design of the first and was not even a proper latte. Sad that the barista can't decipher between a latte and a cafe au lait. 

Despite its dismal appearance, I took the drink and sat outside. The drink was like being punched in the face by a diet vanilla cola. Syrupy sweet and absolutely disgusting. I could not bring myself to drink it, so I went back for one final try. This was a bad move. 

To make matters even worse, the mug that was set aside for their third attempt at my drink ended up getting remnants of another persons order spilled in it. Did they clean it out? No!! After all the fuss I made about my severe dairy allergy, they left what spilled from another persons coffee with milk in the bottom of my cup. They didn't even wipe off the side! 

When questioned about the mishap, the baristas looked at me like I was speaking another language. I ended up throwing in the towel and getting a refund. Do not go here unless you want an overpriced black coffee.",KzcGWMHryaiQGfqzN0nYsA,8,3,1,SAKp4cWucLb8dAkjQ5EQpQ
4654871,2016-09-01,8,VWtT4DKxQ4YVRWT88Z5SMA,"Sip, Savour, & Socialize:

   Sambalatte is a popular Las Vegas Coffee lounge with hot caffeineated drinks and a cool catchphrase : sip, savour, & socialize. Ever since Sambalatte opened their original coffee lounge in Summerlin, Sambalatte is a place that I sip, savour, & socialize in. This is one of three locations that I sip, savour, and socialize in since it opened in 2014.

  These days, I have used this as a caffeine stop on the way to Red Rock Canyon, Mount Charleston, and Summerlin area parks. This is a convenient coffee stop on the way to the western periphery of the valley. It is right off the Jones Boulevard exit of the 215 and at the corner of Sunset and Jones. With the new Sunset Road extension, sometimes I take it from Henderson stop off at Sambalatte then get onto the 215 west of the traffic hot spots.

  When it comes down to it, I prefer this location as a morning spot where I prefer the Summerlin location as an evening spot. This is more of a laid back location than Summerlin, which is a happening two story flagship lounge with entertainment, a library of magazines, couches, and coffee theatre. The first thing you see walking toward the entrance is a drive thru and Tropical Smoothie next store. There is a patio complete with tables between Sambalatte and Tropical Smoothie. Fronting the door is a Sambalatte bicycle with bags of beans and doggie water bowls. When you walk inside there are the colossal coffee bean bags on display. Once inside the lounge has an industrial feel with black ceiling tiles and colors designed to mimick coffee. The walls are arc shaped with plate glass windows above a counter with stools. Throughout the main area the tables are small. Towards the back by the hall leading to the restrooms there are a couple of decent size tables. Opposite the arc shaped walls is the long counter that includes the pastry cases. 

  Generally speaking the employees have been friendly. There was one visit where I asked the obvious question, ""Is Sambalatte going to open a store in Henderson?"" Recently, a friendly barista presented me with a complimentary blueberry muffin. She let fall that there was a different promotion for each week of the summer. Then a couple of months ago, a sweet barista volunteered to warm up the rest of my coffee then put it in a to go cup. 

   I am a fan of Sambalatte coffee. It is flavorful and very strong. The fact that I rarely leave coffee in the medium cup is evidence that this is premium coffee. And the fact that a few minutes after finishing this coffee when I am driving north on the 215 in the Summerlin foothills feeling the caffeine rush through my bloodstream is evidence that this is strong coffee. Sambalatte is much more than just strong and flavorful coffee. They have developed a reputation for their Nutella late. I prefer the more expensive drink for the Summerlin location when I am hanging out in the evening. Speaking of expensive, the coffee here ain't cheap. A medium cup is approximately $3. With that said, the catchphrase could become: ""Sip, Savior, Socialize, & No Free or Discounted Refills."" The refill is the exact price for a cup of coffee. On account of the fact that the coffee is so good that I could drink it if it becomes slightly cold, I order medium or larger. 

   
   Sambalatte continues to be one of the coffee lounges that I visit to sip, savour, & socialize. I hold a high opinion of their coffee and caffeineated drinks. Apparently many others share my opinion. Sambalatte is so popular that they announced a future downtown Las Vegas location that will be built off South Main Street in the Arts District.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,15,12,4,ksLCQGWS-u-_AnCT5IL-SA

4701508,2015-06-10,2,VWtT4DKxQ4YVRWT88Z5SMA,"Matcha Latte w/ Almond Milk ($7): Delicious!! Definitely one of the best matcha lattes I've had. Perhaps it was the almond milk since most places only have soy as a milk alternative. I really enjoyed this beverage and there's SO much of it in one cup!

Almond Croissant ($4.25): This was decent croissant, but far from the best. It was heavily loaded with all the sugar/almond goodness and lacked the crisp of a good croissant. It's also one of the more expensive croissants in town.

Sausage, Egg, and Cheese Muffin ($8): A good sandwich, but WAAY overpriced. I still can't get over how expensive this was and trust me, it wasn't anything special. It was an English muffin, cheese, sausage patty, and premade egg. Like McDonald's.

Quiche Lorraine ($7.75): This quiche was only slightly larger than the sandwich, so it was small. Great flavor, but unfortunately salty. 

I'm a little torn about how I feel toward Sambalatte. It's a cool hang out. I like the space (besides the crowded tables in the main area) and the baristas are delightful. My sister and I spent a couple hours here during the afternoon and it was such a pleasant stay. 

On one end, I LOVED my Matcha Latte. However, the food was overpriced and disappointing. Are coffee shops not supposed to have good food? I don't know, I don't spend a lot of time in coffee shops.

The negatives are it doesn't matter how slow this place is as in customers they are the slowest group of baristas. Usually there are 3 people working and with me just ordering coffee in the drive through or going in it takes about 8-10 min. I've timed it. If there are more than 5 people in the store or 2 in the drive thru expect about a 15min wait. This is where starbucks shines with how on-top of things they are. Also for the last 5 days they were out of the powder they needed to make the frappe's?? What kind of coffee company runs out of products they need to satisfy their menu?

We put in our drink & food order and she didn't even say, ""thank you"" or ""have a good day."" At that point.. I looked right at her and she  gave us a rude and cold look. I grabbed my receipt and didn't even bother saying, ""thank you."" We waited at a nearby table for a few minutes.. And normally the barista would announce whatever drinks were ready to pick up at the counter; however, this barista just left it at the counter without saying a word.

And I can definitely say that we will never come back and just go further down the road to Starbucks instead. 

Aside from the lousy service.. My Nutella cappuccino was not good and the white mocha my boyfriend ordered was extremely sweet. The quiche we ordered was actually good but not worth coming back for their food.

The chocolate and nutella cappuccinos are amazing, its not too sweet that it overpowers the coffee. 

I like the staff that work there they very are cool people, they make the place enjoyable to relax.

My only con is the sandwiches, they didn't taste fresh and a bit pricey.

Iced lattes are perfect, they don't fill the entire glass with ice- you get the size you order, and if you order a flavor, they don't overdo it like most places. The matcha latte is my favorite- they do not skimp on the matcha, and it doesn't taste too creamy or watered down, they actually use real matcha powder. As a tea person and not a coffee person, I can't really speak to the ""notes"" or ""undertones"" of their coffee, but in my limited experience, they make good coffee. The breakfast foods are good- veggie quiche and quiche lorraine are both standard one-person size, it would be great if they came with greens but they're very nice as is.

So I go excuse me I can hear you she's like ohhhh I'm sorry. I order my stuff , she's so embarrassed when I get to the window & I told her nobody took my order so no I wasn't staring at your menu thinking & not knowing how to order coffee . She's red saying I'm sorry I didn't know the mic was on & thought someone asked you already . Your coffee is on us today ! She even has someone else give it to me so embarrassed! Thanks for free coffee, however does not give you the right to talk about people even if you think your mic is off. You should be ashamed , I will never get my coffee from you again. I can not support shops who talk about the people who keep their store in business. *signed the girl you talked about this morning in the black SUV",3rCbMgKAmqoY2sULJET6Ag,1,0,1,xdxHU31L3ntVZ-5UcoWqHw

It also lacks comfier seats. The latte is solid and the service is friendly, but I would definitely rather be at either of their other locations.",YE54kKTuqJJPNYWIKIpOEQ,0,0,3,RoEuNJGyg4rlqEteYh61xA

I read an article on the hotel's site that mentioned the limited availability of their Rainbow Latte which was an immediate seller for my girlfriend, who childishly loves everything rainbow or watercolor - no judgement, but she's 26. Anyway, not only was the staff friendly but our beautiful vanilla lattes were delicious as well. After spending our morning on the coffee shop patio, we took our mugs back into the shop to be considerate of their service, and the employee was so grateful for our small gesture.

5752721,2015-02-20,3,VWtT4DKxQ4YVRWT88Z5SMA,"Tried the other location since we were in that part of town and had 3 hours to kill.  There were couple-3 tables available when we got there (mid-afternoon), and by the time we left it fluctuated from couple to none throughout.  So, constantly busy.  The Americano was fabulous - and I mean really tasty - and still love that they have AC outlets EVERYWHERE.  Even the couple picnic tables outside had outlets attached to them!  

The only complaint I have are the seats.  They are not comfortable.  In some ways I think this is brilliant, so that people don't sit (like we did) for hours-on-end after a $7 order.  We sat for about 2.5 hours, and came away with back aches and sore butts.  That's what we get for squatting though, so not taking any stars away for that.

I couldn't hear the girl taking my order and she definitely couldn't hear me as I repeated my drink 5 times. Finally she got my drink, but then I waited for the total and she starts speaking to a customer but had her headset turned on. When I asked her if I can pull up to the window she asked if I had ordered something and I said yes. 5 minutes later she says to pull up. I ordered a simple vanilla latte, but there wasn't vanilla in there, but of course I was charged extra.

This location will be a HIT with people who have never heard of or visited the boca park location. I however will only go when I'm in the area.... And let's be honest, it's spring Valley.... I'm never just ""in"" the area. 
I will however continue to frequent the original location. Some perspective on my rant for you.... The original location has all the charm and charisma of a real hipster, trendy coffee shop in NYC. No windows, loud music and loungers. This new location is a converted Starbucks, lots of windows and a DRINK fridge sitting in the middle of the place like a 711. Maybe it's just me, but all the light really makes me take notice of the wretched uniforms they had these folks wearing..... Does the original location have that? I'm not sure and I don't pay attention because  they REALLY know their coffee stuff and by all accounts have the same level of adoration for these drinks that I do!
I know there is another one scheduled to open at the mirage..... It's just my fervent hope that these chains don't water down the character and atmosphere of the coffee house I have grown to love so much.",lBYr_iY0idEpsVEQkaEBmg,3,1,4,CzGV2n6bpWLE0c39TnEjkw

So let me just say, this location isn't really convenient for me during the week but, during the weekends in the spring you will now find me sitting outside in the courtyard, sipping a nutella latte.  This location still in the process of getting the kinks worked out (the other day it took about 20 minutes to get two lattes, as some guy grabbed the wrong drink and screwed up the barista) but when they get it all done it should be amazing. This location is also going to have a drivethru, (it's already installed, just not being utilized yet) which will be totally convenient for early morning coffee on trips out of town as it's right off the 215 and Jones.

5902777,2017-04-11,1,VWtT4DKxQ4YVRWT88Z5SMA,"I love studying in coffee shops, so the three things I want most out of a coffee shop is good coffee (duh), decent snacks, and plenty of outlets. And Samba has it all!

The coffee here is good. They have a wide selection of beans and brew methods for all you coffee snobs out there. But if you're coming here for the steampunk, beware that it is almost always broken, and you'll have to settle for a pour over (which is still awesome).

If you like espresso drinks, be mindful that one shot here is actually a double shot. Which means drink the americanos here slowly, because when they say double, that means quad. My favorite is the lavender latte, it's definitely the best I've ever had!

As for their other drinks, they have amazing teas here, served in super cute French presses! The smoothies are good, but it's also right next door to a Tropical Smoothie. They also have spritzers/sparklers which are basically house made soda that are very meh. I would definitely stick with coffee and tea here.

I think most of their pastries are okay for the price. But I love the biscottis, and they have good macarons at average prices. Plus, some of the baristas here are super friendly and knowledgeable about the menu which is always awesome. 

Overall, I definitely recommend this place if you want to catch up with friends or get some work done. It's not as cool as their other location, being one story and no live music and all, but it is less busy and you still get quality coffee, tea, and pastries for the same prices at Starbucks.",ZIqkcApOQh8QfiydYSiLaQ,3,2,5,LeGBK6RbZfQG9nnpi8R-WA

The decor was nice and welcoming, they had random donated board games I wish I had time to try, and their pumpkin spice latte was honestly the best pumpkin latte I've ever had from a coffee place, no contest! I'll definitely come back here the next time I'm in Vegas.

This doesn't affect the review at all, but I never would have thought streetwalkers would be out so early in the evening but my friend and I saw them everywhere while we were walking down the Strip between 4-5, and it was interesting and bizarre seeing a streetwalker on the corner of Sambalatte :P",iDhFFrx9Qg7KQv3cTQoJ0g,0,0,5,R67_w8-PAJUuy8UHf4MNMQ

Service was friendly, albeit a little slow for there being no line. My iced coffee was a little watered down and I wish they had used more ice to keep it colder. It all seemed to have melted quickly and was lukewarm, which isn't particularly appetizing.
