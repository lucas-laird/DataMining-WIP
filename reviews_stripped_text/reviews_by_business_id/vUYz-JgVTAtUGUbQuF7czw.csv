The Del Taco menu has a generous variety of items,
some of which are given names that are tongue
twisters.  Perhaps they should simply give a number
to each item, then customers could order by number.

My receipt says his name is Bonnell, and for the record I do not believe in calling people out by name on yelp, but this employee is seriously mean. You're probably thinking give the guy a break, he was probably having a bad day, but he is ALWAYS having a bad day.  It's a guarantee if you encounter this guy at the drive thru that you would agree with me. I usually only come here during  the late night hours and I dread seeing his grumpy ass! He actually complained to my face about the hour I was there vs greeting me with a hello. When I placed my order he says all rudely how I didn't say what kind of drink I wanted but then repeats the exact drink I said I wanted. I use to take it personally until I saw the car in front of me one time trying to fight the guy, and asking him what time he got off of work. The driver in front of me actually ended up pulling off without his food and he had already paid for it. Another time he went off on a customer for paying with change.

3085622,2015-12-22,0,vUYz-JgVTAtUGUbQuF7czw,"At my last visit to this place, I had the #7 (Two Fish tacos with fries and a drink) and chili cheese nachos.

The nachos were decent; they were hot, cheesy, and had a good chili flavor to them. Not a bad deal for only $1. The left over chili/cheese sauce went well with my fries. Nothing special, but it worked. The fries I had been given were pretty delicious. They were salted, crispy, and hot.

The fish tacos come warm wrapped in foil. Upon opening the foil, there is a single slice of lime before full uncovering the taco, which I thought was pretty neat. However, all thoughts of ingenuity vanished when I learned that the limes I had been given were dry and incapable of producing any significant amount of lime juice what so ever. Upon opening the rest of the foil wrapper, what I was greeted with was a decent sized fish taco on a flour tortilla. Unfortunately, the fish taco was void of any taco-like flavor. No flavor of fish, cabbage, nor salsa was present. However, any condiment I added on the taco, whether it was the few drops of lime juice I was able to produce or hot sauce, would become the flavor of the taco.

A typical Del Taco experience. Fast service, low quality food. I have enjoyed the other items on the menu, but I have learned not to expect much from a fast food joint. This was one of my less enjoyable visits.",yvqGJqrjeC0AwYs6Oecp0g,0,0,2,beR6OdGCERYjdT8K6UrIsQ
