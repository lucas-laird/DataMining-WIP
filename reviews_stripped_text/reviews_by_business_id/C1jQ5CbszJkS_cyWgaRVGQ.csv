Very polite and very attentive! They have a lunch special that is a really great deal but I have not tried that yet we have only been there for dinner and the sukiyaki is always delicious. Tonight Edland recommended the spicy miso sukiyaki and it was yummy! We didn't realize they closed at 9pm and we left at 9:52p!! I feel so bad to have kept them! I thought they close late but they never said anything to us about the time so that was nice of them because we prob got there around 9:55! Thank you Edland for such a wonderful experience tonight! We will see you next time!!,ENOMnN3G7OzfyexIoIi7lQ,0,0,5,b2QShZvn9pAoGvJU6uY1uQ
303415,2012-06-12,1,C1jQ5CbszJkS_cyWgaRVGQ,"I had been wanting to try this place for so long.  It had everything I thought would make for a good meal- veggies, noodles, soupiness- but I left very disappointed.

We started off with a cucumber roll and that was a hot mess.  It was sloppily put together and not fresh at all.  If this is how they treat a cucumber, I don't want to know how they treat the fish.

Next we ordered two Vegetarian Delights, I had the shabu shabu and my husband had the sukiyaki.  Note to vegetarians: when I see ""vegetarian"" written somewhere, like a dummy I assume it's ok.  Thankfully at the last minute I asked about it and I was told they use bonito in the broth and sauce.  If you don't eat fish, ask to leave out the bonito.

Well, basically all I got was water and a piece of seaweed.  I tried to put some of the condiments that are provided in the broth to liven it up, but gave up after my tenth tablespoon of soy sauce.  If you are going to go with the veggie, be prepared for zero flavor.  In the end, I ended up eating some plain boiled vegetables.

My husband's dinner was a little better since his veggies were sautéed in sauce.  The downside was that I watched our server pour half a bottle of soy sauce in his pot.  I hope you like sodium!

For all the non-vegetarians, I'm sure this place is good.  

For all the vegetarians, you might want to consider something else.

Overall, a fun experience to try once but it takes forever for small results.  Give me a giant bowl of ramen any day.",ELfzWgdf64VBLi5z1ECItw,5,1,2,b32E_1iYFVvuxu0zd-iu4Q

This used to be one of my favorite places to eat several years ago and I had almost forgot about it.  I haven't been here in years because I got my heart broken here  :(    , but that's another story, anyway I figured I'd check it out again to see if it was still good.

I like the layout of the U shaped table, it's both fun and conversational and a little awkward to look at someone on the other side. I only have the shabu shabu style....I just didn't care for the sukiyaki style.  The food was still really good, I love the ponzu sauce!  That sauce is soooo good!

I like that the meat Swish serves always look fresh and lean.  I've been to other shabu places that have a lot of fat in the meat slices or have that ""old-meat"" look.  And sure, there are tons of great shabu shabu places out here in SoCal (where I currently reside).  But there's just something about Swish that tells me - hey, you're HOME. :)

Our server has been the same person probably in the last year or 2 - which is the owner I believe.  He is THE nicest and most polite server I've ever had the pleasure encountering.  He's always very pleasant.  He always has a gentle smile on his face.  He truly seems to enjoy what he does - serving people.

847579,2011-07-23,3,C1jQ5CbszJkS_cyWgaRVGQ,"I love dunking raw meat into hot, sweet broth.  So, after a round of ""eenie meenie miney moe"" with my Groupons, I settled on Swish.

The restaurant: The setup of Swish is interesting.  At Swish, you're seated at a long, u-shaped counter with a hot pot placed in front of each diner. Unfortunately, the pot is placed in an awkward location, forcing the diner to reach up over the bar, and then at a downward angle, to swish their food.  For someone with short, Tyrannosaurus Rex arms (like me), it was really difficult to eat.  I definitely prefer the more intimate, table setting found at other shabu-shabu places around town.

The food: The selection of veggies served with the shabu-shabu/sukiyaki dishes were lackluster.  I probably received half a head of cabbage and two mushrooms in total. I thank them for all that fiber, but, can I please get some more tofu? However, I did enjoy my prime rib sukiyaki which was thinly cut and lean.  The unlimited rice is also nice.

Overall, I would likely go back if I was in the neighborhood. Nextime, however, I'd probably ask for the booster seat to help with eating at the awkward angle (why do you hate the shorties, Swish?).",gq8dZgJConBUANpSFzKKjg,1,1,3,BgA3MK5fDWsLXntNkYbQvw

It was deep fried and it had spicy tuna, cream cheese, jalapeños and smelt egg, and a couple other things. It was also a big roll! All together it was $25 which seemed fair.

1230003,2013-01-28,1,C1jQ5CbszJkS_cyWgaRVGQ,"Came here for dinner one Sunday evening around 7 pm- ish while visiting Sin City. We came here because of the yelp reviews (thank you fellow yelpers again!) and am glad we did. When we came in, we were immediately acknowledged by the 1 and only server in the place and seated. There was only 2 other tables at the time and the friendly server we had was very quick on his feet. He really hustled (especially after the place started to fill up quickly). 

Anyways, my husband ordered the all you can eat 3 combination plate and I ordered the vegetable plate. For the vegetable plate, you get 2 plates of vegetables and udon (normally your entree of meat comes with 1 plate of vegetables and udon). My husband liked his all you can eat combination plate, although 1 of the 3 types of meats wasn't nearly as tasty as the other 2. 

Every time my husband was ready to have a plate of meat to cook in his sukiyaki pot (you can choose either sukiyaki or just boiling water when you order any hot pot meal, for the same price by the way... very nice since every other shabu place I've been to has always charged a few dollars extra to have sukiyaki), he always had the meat freshly cut by a guy in the back. Our server always checked back with us in case we needed anything and always had a smile on his face (honestly, I would be exhausted by now if I was working his shift that evening). 

The sukiyaki was perfect and we also liked the dipping sauces we were given (we had to ask for them, it wasn't automatically given to us. But other shabu places we've been to always bring out the dipping sauces right when you order).  

Pricing for this place is actually on the cheaper side, compared to other shabu places. Overall, love this place and would come back the next time we are in Vega$.

By the way, there is plenty of parking in the lot and the ladies' restroom is nice and clean. (Don't forget to grab a mint on your way out, especially if you had a ton of garlic in your shabu pot).",3UIa8YVjETNwJwnOl4SEdg,4,0,5,HelHf02SAw9O2Pvgg1oo1Q

It was definitely different than the ""old"" Swish!  Very dirty looking.  The cooking stoves were dirty.  The condiments under the counter were all messy.  The handwritten, paper, taped signs on the walls and windows were tacky with the decor.  (It may work for Ichiza, but not at this Swish).  

The server was CONSTANTLY coughing and not covering her mouth.  If she was sick, she should taken the night off!  Since you can see into the back area behind the curtains, I watched as she continued to cough...lick her fingers, cough on our food and then serve it to us.  I also witnessed her spitting or throwing up in the trash can.  It was outrageous!  

BTW - she didn't wash her hands at all!!!!  

Before I could eat the food that looked like days/weeks old veggies - I left.  I was so completely disgusted and paranoid of what germs she was spreading.  When she moved my cup to put down the rice bowl, she picked it up from the top.   That sealed the deal for me.

I had no idea I was walking into a cooking school. 
A friend and I  walked into this place and we were greeted right away,  as soon as we sat I noticed that  this was going to be a different experience for us. There was a burner in front of every seating area and only one waitress and no cooks in the dining area. We ordered the all you can eat special and a couple of beers and so the lesson began.
 Here's the thing,...I'm not so sure what we ordered, also I'm not used to this kind of cuisine but when the waitress came back after taking our order (or shopping list?) she came back with some raw items, sat them on the counter and turned on the burner and gave us some quick cooking instructions..o_0.....I looked at my friend who was also looking at me with the same look as many yelpers with the orange heads and a big question mark across their face. All I said was...you do the cooking I do the dishes.
 We started to get the hang of things, also people started to seat around us (professionals) and we could now imitate what everyone else was doing.
At the end the food was ok, as much as I hate to say that since this time the cook was...me!, so I kinda fired myself and went for the sushi rolls for the rest of the meal.
The Swish roll, the volcano roll, and the spider roll...I know might as well throw in the California roll but I didn't see anything more closer to real sushi.
The place is very clean and functional for what they do, prices are competitive, the service is great although it could've been fabulous had we had our own personal cook, but now I know what to expect next time.

Restaurant was kind of seedy, service was fair.  I told the server I had a Groupon when we were seated, he said it was fine. When it came time to check out, he refused the Groupon without even looking at it. He said it was for four people (how would he know, if he hadn't even looked at it?), and it was only for appetizers. I said it was for a lunch, he said appetizers only was in the fine print. Had I gone mad, and bought a Groupon for appetizers only? I checked the Groupon and it specifically stated LUNCH. When I showed him (on my phone) he took it and hit the 'redeemed' button. 

This story ended with me paying for a Groupon (that was not accepted) at this establishment, as well as paying over $40.00 for lunch. And with an ironic twist - NO APPETIZERS!

7:28 pm. I arrive at Swish a bit earlier than my partners tonight. This far from the Asian markets on Spring Mountain, I'm on high alert for flim flam. After a quick stop in the restroom (clean, but no hot water at the sink tonight), I take a seat and let my server know that the investigation will include two others.

There is not much to the decor. The seating is around one long horseshoe shaped bar, the servers work the cooking pots as they dart from one end to the other. Conversations are fine for couples, but with three or more, you'll find yourself leaning in and out more often than the Hokey Pokey.

We decide to start with the recommended wasabi octopi (good with beer, the menu claims) and an order of edamame. The octopi came in a small bowl with little round nuggets in a slimey wasabi sauce. Now, don't get me wrong, the wasabi and octopi tasted ok, but trying to fish pea sized chunks from a bath of sinus cleaner with two sticks was strange.

We decided to order three different beef dishes and trade amongst ourselves. Of the three, the Kobe Beef was the only one that seemed to distinguish itself. One helpful hint, they do have tongs to help retrieve lost swimmers. The meal itself was very tasty, the vegies were crisp and fresh, the beef sliced wafer thin (Monte Python references aside)

Bottom line:
The good: excellent sukiyaki, fresh vegies, wonderful service
The bad: not much, but if your in a larger group, visiting can be hard
The ugly: wierd slimy octopus nuggets...nuff said",GTcKUjRulTRN_XxehMgSZQ,1,0,4,tAUhtWNgQTmpnbdEKxblwg

This place is set up like a round sushi bar, with individual grills for each diner for hot pot meals. I might come back here for that, but as I said, I had sushi on my mind. At 4PM, there were only two other couples present, finishing up grill meals.

The menu has two pages of sushi options that are decently-priced. I was surprised to see that the majority of roll options are fried or contain tempura-fried fish or shrimp, neither of which is my thing.
I opted for the Crazy Boy and Sahara rolls, each $8.99. There was an insert in the menu stating happy hour discount from 4pm-6pm for 20% off of the bill, so I added on a plum wine.

Wine was a decent portion for $5, super sweet like I like it. 
The rolls came out quickly: crazy boy is a bit more mild with avocado and cream cheese, but the sahara compliments it well with spicy salmon and a spicy garlic ponzu sauce. Rolls were a little on the skinny side and there wasn't much fish in them, which was slightly disappointing. It was just okay. 

Bill came to about $25. The 20% happy hour discount was not on the bill and I didn't feel like I should have to bring it to the employee's attention. I am not likely to come back, or if I do it will not be for sushi.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,6,4,3,e-i3qyXfHGH7XLTGXlvtng

The first two times I was here with my husband we were between lunch and dinner and I wondered how this place could stay open with only two other guess (if that)  in the restaurant.  I also was equally impressed they could offer an AYCE ribeye Shabu-Shabu for only about $25.00.   

I am happy to report coming here on a Sat. night to see a full house was a relief.  Both my husband and I got AYCE Shabu-Shabu (ribeye).  My favorite thing about this place is that there are no micromanaging rules like must finish rice, meat, or noodle or be charge xxx amount. I just like meat and veggies, and don't eat the noodles or rice. it was fine with them. My husband and I share the same plate of thinly sliced meat and then get another together so I guess we conserve food that way, but we got four full plates of meat.  The service is very generous and they constantly ask (not in a pesky way)  if you are ready for another round or just taking a break. 

The only unfortunate thing for me, is that my husband and I do shabu-shabu at home often and use all sorts of Asian condiments they don't have, like sesame oil, rice vinegar, etc, but still it is no biggie.  We also like to eat the beefy broth that has developed from swish-swishing the meat, they sometimes look at you a bit funny and then give you a very small bowl and very big spoon that is not very soup friendly.

I am hugely impressed by how clean this place is.  I saw the one waiter even giving a thorough clean to each burner after it was used.     If you are a soup lover or sukiyaki lover, you must try Swish.  Oh and they even added an AYCE sushi roll option to their menu; the rolls looked decent, but I never ever had one here.

I'm sorry if this was an awful description of you, but I wanted to make sure you were acknowledged LOL He was so speedy and kept asking us if we were good. He refilled water and soup without us even having to ask. Dude, Swish, you guys did a good job hiring this waiter.

I've actually been to Swish twice through Groupon--though the last time was over a year ago. Both times, I have been very pleased. It's a great deal with the Groupon. They also have AYCE hot pot on Tuesdays for 22.99, which is a stealll. I like that the quality of the service did not change just because we were using a Groupon.

We opted for the prime rib and new york steak with the sukiyaki broth. It also comes with a bowl of rice and a platter of vegetables. I recently went to Yojie and felt that Swish's broth was not as flavorful. But if you just let the food sit in the bowl for a little longer, it absorbs flavor LOL. The meat was okay; it wasn't the best I had but not bad. The serving size is great though. I wish the sukiyaki bowls were deeper, but the waiter refilled our soup without us even asking. So that was great.

I have noticed that they do leave the stations uncleared. They need to clean up the stations after the patrons leave--not when new patrons arrive. But you know what, there's really only one guy up front dealing with the customers. He's doing the best he can (which is already really great), so I'm not too mad. 

I'll definitely come back and take advantage of their discounts. Their flavor and food (at least for hot pot) is not bad. But for the price, I feel like this place is a great deal.",QjZN6x1hGm2Edj95FfpKUA,7,3,4,sJ4kHktMLF6X8sK8hMBHww

Good bang to buck ratio. I didnt go for any premium cuts of meat and grabbed the 3 meat combo. Cant exactly remember the three cuts of meat other than one being eye of round but i had about 4 plates of it so mission accomplished. 

I would highly recommend grabbing the Sukiyaki style. The sweet soy has much more flavor and everything that comes out of it, especially the udon noodles, much MUCH better. Dont forget to add a healthy scoop of minced garlic as it'll give it a lot more depth. 

Noodle and Veggie plates are premade which can be a bit annoying as each plate had too little or too much of one thing or another. Meat plates are done right and slices to order. Depending on where you sit you can watch your meat being sliced and assembled which is nice. No browning of meat that's been stacked on top of another and left in the fridge. 

Four instead of five stars mainly due to my mistake of ordering the shabu shabu instead of the Sukiyaki. Pretty much ended up grabbing Anthony M's left other broth and threw it into my own which turned out A LOT better then expected but one of hte staff came by and topped me off with shabu shabu water/broth and it got watered down.

2178462,2011-12-27,6,C1jQ5CbszJkS_cyWgaRVGQ,"The Skinny: the switch to new management has really hurt this place, that includes the rather poor details in the food (2) service: I'm not sure what was worse, our absent-minded waiter or the rather brusque attitude of the waitress (1) this place really went off the deep end on service and food within a year (2).

It may be a surprise but shabu shabu and sukiyaki isn't rocket science. But the lack of attention to essential details makes this place on my no-go list.

Enticed by a Groupon Now! deal, the hubs and I headed to Swish for dinner. When we stepped in, we put in a drink order. And waited. And waited. Essentially we entered into the building at 8:05 and didn't get to put in our order until close to 8:30pm and that's only because we flagged him down.

I guess that is the running motif around Swish. If you want to get service, you not only have to signal for service but you have to ask for everything. When I mean everything, I mean things like plates.

But how could the food be possibly bad here, you may ask? Isn't it just veggies and raw meat that you cook in a pot yourself?

Even though the food is simple enough, it can be disasterous if not prepared appropriately. Take for example my order of Chicken Fiesta ($12.95 healthy portion) sukiyaki style which came with one small plate of vegetables, and a bowl of rice. 

The chicken, was carelessly cut into various shapes and sizes - some as large as a 1 inch x 0.5 inch x 1 inch cube. The uneven size makes the cooking time highly variable and uneven. Plus trying to cook really thick pieces of chicken in a little iron skillet with minimal liquid takes forever. Added to the fact you don't want to cross contaminate the raw chicken with the other food, it ended up taking a long time before I could eat.

The haphazard plate of vegetables were also cut unevenly (some were really large pieces of napa cabbage and carrots which were hard to eat) which also exacerbated the above stated issues. The vegetables itself were okay, but I was a little irritated by the fact they put less than 15 leaves of spinach on a plate to make it look full. (For those in the know, that amount of spinach cooks down to less than a mouthful.) It's a total turn off because they charge another $3.95 for a miniscule plate of poorly cut vegetables.

My hubby ordered the hungry sized Kobe Chuck ($20.95) portion. Although his meat cooked better than my stuff because it was thinly sliced, the accompanying dipping sauces were horrible. The sesame sauce was musty, weird, and watery. Tasting like swamp water and looking like the crappacino they serve on Fear Factor, it was a horrific combination. The ponzu was okay but nothing you can't get out of a bottle from the supermarket.

To cap off this experience, the servers at the restaurant were poor. Our waiter, who was nice, appeared to be very absent-minded. He'd frequently forget to start the cooking pots, plates for food, cooking utensils, etc. Running the cheque took way longer than it ought to. The waitress on the other hand was more on the ball but had a poorer attitude towards the patrons (ie, sounding exasperated because someone didn't know what the meat choices were, grilling me on why I wanted a second set of chopsticks - because it handled raw chicken and we had no cooking utensils... that's why!... to name a few examples.)

One might argue the joint was busy. However I'd like to say something about that. I normally don't make comparisons but I just have to in this case. Shabu Shabu Paradise (Henderson) not only has one waiter in the whole joint but she handles the same number of customers all on her own. And, the service is way better than what we received here. Plus she has to deal with refilling unlimited plates of correctly cut vegetables, bowls of salad, condiments and rice.

Although the food was edible, the service and the improperly prepared dishes really ruined this place for me. Plus, the rather lackluster portion sizes given the price of the meal is also a big turn off. 

Even though our other favourite shabu/sukiyaki place is 30 minutes away, I'd rather go there than suffer through another round of Swish. (2 starred review).",h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q,10,6,2,ptly62nzx4Ld13iv_mspOw

I used to come here a lot but I soon declined as I realized there were many places in Vegas I was able to get more bang with my buck. Then I found out there was a change in management and they had added the option of AYCE. THIS CHANGED EVERYTHING. No longer did I have to worry about not being ""full"" after paying twenty dollars for my meal. 

The Good: Meat and vegetables are still to die for. And with the meat being all you can eat...or vegetables if you get the veggie platter, there is nothing to complain about with in the food department. I always like to ask for a raw egg and dip the meat after it's done cooking. Yum! Oh. And never forget to ask for the garlic. Even though I might have to change my clothes later because of the garlic smell, it really adds a great taste. All of the AYCE prices are reasonable priced. They also have good deals on alcohol, like AYCE sake for $9.99. Can't beat that.

The Bad: The only thing bad at times is the service occasionally. When it's the older gentlemen working, he is very keen on all our needs. He is the best! While, if it's the younger staff, we could be sitting there by ourselves and we will have to wave them down for another serving.

It was my second time at Swish. I didn't have a nice experience before (when they were at spring mt, 7 years ago), but I wanted to give a shot again since Groupon had a deal. I bought ""worth of hotpot or shabu shabu for two or more people."" and we ordered 1 medium shabu shabu and shared (and added more meats --- PLEASE SEE #4 on my list what happens when you ADD MORE STUFFS and willing to spend more). 

1. The service was terrible. It was Saturday, 8:30 PM, the restaurant was empty, only my boyfriend and I were there to eat. Although they didn't have any other customers to serve, they didn't even give us any utensils (spoons, fork, turner, nothing). And the waitress didn't even explain the menu so we were so confused before we ordered. 

2. It was boiling so fast and so strong, so we asked the waitress to turn down the fire, but she barely changed. I couldn't even control the gas, because of how they designed the table. I couldn't taste anything since everything was way too hot and it burned my tongue.

3. At 9:15 PM, they started to clean up the restaurant (they close at 10 PM on Sat). We felt under the pressure since they were cleaning and mopping the floor.

4. We ended up spending about $80 dollars since we added a lot of meats and mushroom, but when I PRESENTED THE GROUPON VOUCHER, THEY REFUSED to take. They said YOU CANNOT ADD MORE ITEMS........ I was like what? so I added more meats and alcohol, and willing to spend $40 more, and you are refusing to take my voucher.....? Then she said ""it's also because you guys shared 1 medium pot. You guys need to order 2 separate pots""  

I really don't understand this.... I read Groupon direction, but there was no such thing like that. I didn't even do happy hour nor all-you-can eat, but they refused to accept my groupon. Sadly, I had to pay $80 that night.

The fun part of eating at Swish is that you get to cook up your own food. For the shabu shabu, you cook your food in a pot of boiling water. For the sukiyaki, you cook it up in a skillet. Both ways are very tasty. The best part of the shabu shabu is drinking the broth at the end when it's got the taste of all the veggies and meat you've been cooking up. For the sukiyaki we tossed our remaining edamame in the skillet to soak up the last of the sauce. Yum yum!",wc4XAA5pC3b1UgooSypHwA,1,1,4,s15TklYgEQo0RuFz3UFQwg

The hubby and my two little one went with the shabu shabu, and maybe it's just me but the broth was so bland. I expected spicy miso soup but instead it was the regular broth and the lady just dump a whole bunch of siracha. I'm from the bay so I'm used to having shabu at the shabu house so maybe it's my taste buds, but not good. We got the large and the portion were tiny. I'm 4'10 and that did not filled me up. I was so hungry after I ate everything on my plate, I guess that's why people order sushi rolls to fill them up. Our server didn't even ask if we wanted green onions, garlic etc but she ask the people that came after us. Rude! I think I would be really upset if I had to pay full fee for this. They do have ayce so if your going to eat there than that's the way to go.

Server was extremely hospitable!  

Was initially going to start out with a small sake and a small Kirin, but the server told me about the awesome deal: Large hot house sake ($7) which comes with a free order of gyoza or edamame (I went with the Pork Gyoza).  4 to the order, these lil crispy guys were light and simple in flavor (which I appreciated).  I asked for ponzu sauce to dip these in..the sauce was a lil saltier than I normally prefer, but it went well with the gyoza!

$4.95 Spicy Tuna roll: This was pretty good, and the price makes it even BETTER!!  

$5.95 Fried Calamari:  This should have been called ""Tempura Calamari"" cause that's what it was!  It was still really good..not rubbery.  I dipped it in ponzu sauce.

We have gone to swish a few times in the past, and thought it was a great idea for a nice family outing. Well... I was wrong. We ordered 2 rib-eye AYCE with a few ala carte items. The rib-eye meat texture seemed to be really tough and almost gamey tasting (no I didn't over cook it.) It almost tasted like teriyaki beef jerky... The flavor and consistency just wasn't quiet right! Might've been because their meat is always frozen? Not sure if maybe the meat had freezer burn or was old? Unfortunately, this wasn't the only problem. When I was eating my udon noodles, I noticed a big black BUG mixed in the noodles. When I told the waiter, he was apologetic and ran to the kitchen. After a couple minutes, he came back with a ""New"" bowl of the noodles. The udon was wet and had water at the bottom of the bowl, like they washed the noodles and gave it back to me! Again, I didn't make a big deal... but told the waiter nicely and quietly (didn't want to disturb other customers) that I was no longer interested in eating the food. When it was time to pay the bill, he said... since you ate some of the food, you will have to still pay for the food, and we will take off $5.00 because the Bug! Lol... sorry but I'm not paying for something that I didn't finish, nor am I paying for food that had a bug in it... especially since its not my fault. The waiter ran back to the kitchen when I asked for the manager. He came back minutes later and said ""the manager is too busy, and won't he able to talk to you for a few hours."" I previously didn't want to get loud due to other customers in the restaurant, but I sternly showed him the water in the bowl and told him they clearly washed the noodles with the bug and gave it ba k to me (which he disnt deny) I then told him I would pay for everything we ate, but I refused to pay for food that I did not eat... DUE TO A BUG! After going back and forth for few minutes, he said he could give another discount, but the manager said ""I had to pay, for what I already ate"". At the end... I ended up paying for everything but the one AYCE, because I refused to pay for my meal. This place is a joke... and does not care about making things right. Not to mention, if they had a bug in the noodles, I can only imagine what the veggies and kitchen might have! Quality of food sucks, it's dirty (clearly), and they don't care about customer service... I will never go here again! This place made me feel like I was wrong for not wanting to pay for a meal that I no longer wanted to eat because of a BUG. I was still going to pay for the rest of the food, even though my family lost their appetite as well.

I guess I had my expectations too high because I was let down. Also because I think my palate has been spoiled by living in LA for the past four years; so take my review with a grain of salt. 

The spicy miso broth that I tried was very bland. I literally had to drink my soy sauce based dipping sauce for flavoring. So I recommend the sukiyaki broth if you want something more tasty. The veggie platter that they offered was not fresh. The spinach came wilted with the borders mushy and wet. The rib eye was sliced thinly. You can see them slicing the meat since they don't slice in the kitchen. $22 for a medium plate of rib eye.

They offer two kinds of sauces here: peanut and soy sauce based with a hint of citrus. Both sauces tasted great! Service was excellent, but sadly I won't be returning :(",g_4zySOI_HisK5rG_2dw6Q,9,2,2,-pYaR4txSwfOzz6utURrXw

-Prime Ribeye 0/10: There were bones in the thinly sliced prime rib......how??? Ribeye doesn't have bone in it. Are they not taking off the ribs before slicing????? Health hazard. 
-Service 0/10: After telling and showing the waiter the large piece of jagged hard bone that I painfully bit down on he told me. "" Yea our meat has bones in it."" That's all he said and that was it. I didn't know how to respond but that bone could have sliced up my gums or mouth wtf. 
-Service 0/10: I eat a lot of meat and whenever the plate of meat came I would immediately put it all in the pot and order another plate(since they won't give you multiple plates at once) The server would proceed to stall with other tasks and take a really long time to get more meat. We only have 1 hour for the AYCE and they stalled hard so that I couldn't get my money's worth. Keep in mind there was only 4 customers.

So this place does not offer an authentic Japanese Shabu Shabu experience - they are Korean owned and run and the goma and ponzu sauce flavors are completely off from the traditional Japanese shabu restaurants that I am accustomed to. Calling this place a Korean fusion hotpot restaurant would be more fitting. We also knew this place was not legit when they didn't even have ""hot drops"" - how do they not have that!? What a huge letdown. 

Is there no good Japanese Shabu Shabu places in Las Vegas? Help me!!!

My boyfriend ordered the traditional prime beef shabu shabu lunch which was $10. I ordered the prime beef sukiyaki lunch which was also $10. Both combos come with a plate of vegetables and rice. Also you get their ponzu and goma sauce. 

The meat were sliced crazy thin - thinner than paper. It practically dissolved on contact; I couldn't pick the meat slices up without them breaking into a bunch of tiny inedible dots of meat. It was the worst form of cuttingcosts I've ever seen. 

I'm curious to know if they make it that thin for lunch only and if dinner they actually give a better slice of meat? Even so, the thin slices the meat were absurd, even for lunch - it's not an acceptable business practice and a total scam. 

The plate of vegetables wasn't tiny, but all of the vegetables were cut into many tiny pieces (bits) and they were old! I would predict they were about a week and a half old, if not older. 

The sauces were really sad. The ponzu sauce tasted more sour than it should, almost like pure vinegar. Maybe it was bottled ponzu, but I've tasted bottled ponzu that was better than this. Also the goma sauce was not even close to what goma sauce should taste like; was it even made with sesame seeds? It was very sour as well. It's almost like they had a general idea of what the sauce should taste like, but never actually tasted it. Epic fail. 

The last drawback was that they didn't offer any type of soup base for the traditional shabu shabu udon noodle soup at the very end, which was so weird! So you pretty much have a bland, udon noodle soup broth to sip? I don't understand it. On the other hand, my sukiyaki broth was insanely sweet. I had to pour my boyfriends bland (watery) broth in into my (sugar bombed) pot order to make it edible. 

I'm so disappointed this place called themselves Japanese shabu shabu. It was all a huge lie.",u_wqt9RshdZsoj8ikLqoEQ,7,2,1,TfqC5eKFZsaFjK06-PJazg
2639386,2011-12-12,1,C1jQ5CbszJkS_cyWgaRVGQ,"What a great night to unwind with getting the Family together and enjoy some soup for the soul. So I took my parents here and my Father's best friend that was in town for the holidays for some Shabu Shabu! I love eating this in the Winter time, it makes the chilly weather more welcoming and I actually look forward it! Excited and hungry.. we all gained a hearty appetite for this meal. Luckily, we beat the busy dinner rush from arriving after 7p.m.  We were greeted and directed to our seats, which I like the whole layout of the round cooking stations in the restaurant. They also serve Sukiyaki, but that dish is always way to salty for me.

We all ordered the Healthy portion (6oz.) of the Prime Rib-Eye. It's just the right amount of meat to be full and satisfied. Also just enough room to have dessert and actually ""taste"" it. The attentive server explained what each sauce were used for and what we can add to it in enhancing the flavor. There were condiments of thinly sliced green onion, blended radish, and garlic. If you add the radish and green onion together in the ponzu/soy sauce.. it brings out the flavor of the sauce, which also gives flavor to all the vegetables. I only add the garlic and Shichimi (seven flavor chili pepper) to the soup base for flavor and dip the cooked meat in the creamy peanut sauce... Love this sauce and used practically all of it. I almost asked for seconds. Everybody has a different way of using the sauces, but I always think of it as... creamy sauces for meat and seafood. While dark liquid sauces that give a acidic bite like soy sauce and ponzu... I use on vegetables and anything other than meat, so it doesn't cancel out the flavor of the meat itself, but coats more neutral flavor to the meat, so you can still taste the meat and get that creamy peanut flavor at the same time ;)

So first the server brings a pot of water with a thick slice of seaweed, which is the soup base in where you place everything in to cook. Then they bring out a plate full of   vegetables and udon noodles... carrots, onion, green onion, different types of mushrooms, tofu, and cabbage. What I do is I put equal amounts of veggies to start cooking and put a slice or two of the meat... then repeat. After I finish my bowl of rice that comes along with this meal... At the very end, I place all the udon noodles and put the last slices of meat with veggies into my bowl to eat as a soup. Very soothing and delicious!!! It's like having two meals in one seating!! Like a Big Mac.. eat half of it as a burger and the other half like a taco by folding it in half :D Well I enjoy it more eating it that way than trying to stuff the whole burger in my mouth! :P After all of us killed the whole soup... we all ordered individual ice creams. I had half Red Bean and Green Tea... Delicious!!! The texture wasn't creamy, but softly firm.. like packed snow, but minus any flakes.. which was packed with flavor and absolutely lovely to eat. I enjoyed every single bite of it. One of the best ice creams I ever had. I was so impressed I had to take a picture of this simple, yet delightful dessert. Even my Mother thought the green tea looked too greenish? but it was so Good!!! OH! We all enjoyed it and it ended our meal with the highest note possible. You can literally hear our tummy singing of pure joy. We all expressed how much we needed this and having my parents and my Father's best friend thanking me for a wonderful dinner... I couldn't be more happier to see the ones I love so much.. Happy. 

Great service and happy souls... Swish is the ""Chicken Soup for the Soul"" but honestly it's the best with red meat :) Soothing and seriously takes all the stress away... Located in the same complex of Round 1 Boxing and The Las Vegas Grille... across the street to the formerly known 24hr. fitness.  Must stop by and enjoy before Winter is over. I'm telling you..

Upon walking in, you see a round table bar style and in the front of you, it has a hot pot. When you order, you get to pick from a bunch of different types of proteins or veggies if you're vegetarian and you cook your food in one of the 3 different types of broth.

I like this because it is very interactive, you cook your food at your own pace and you're able to converse with the people you're with as well. I took my husband here for the first time and he liked it as well! 

It comes with 2 different types of dipping sauces- ponzu which is a tangy like sauce and a sesame dipping sauce as well. I got the chicken and my husband got the New York rib eye.

The thing that would keep me going to Yojié instead would be that they have built in hot plates for the food. Here at Swish, the hot pots are behind the counter and difficult to reach. They also don't customize your dipping sauces here.

I do wish this place had fresher looking veggies and higher quality beef (comparing this to the likes of Shabu House in SF/Burlingame), but again, it's the best option I've found so far. The AYCE options are definitely cheaper out in LV and this place even allows you to get multiple meat options. If you're looking to save a few bucks, go between 4-6pm and you get 20% off the regular menu. Last time I went in at about 5:50pm and didn't finish eating until 7pm and our server still gave us the 20% discount without having to remind them.

First took 15 minutes to seat us when there was 2 open seats when we walked in.   Then I order a regular miso broth the server told me they don't have miso sukiyaki only, i had no choice so proceeded.  Then 10 minutes later the people around us ordered miso with the miso pot which pissed me off already.  When our food arrived, it came 4-5 different parts each in 2-3 minutes intervals, meat, veggies, rice, sauce, and finally utensils to eat with.  Half way through dinner I requested more broth because mine was nearly dried up from not enough to begin with, 20 minutes went by they never came back to add more.  Finally the kicker was the bill.  They have Tuesday special posted all over the door and on the menu all you can eat $22.  The lady brought me the check and charged 24.99, I told her was charged wrong she try to make up a weird explanation which made no sense and said hold on I'll fix it, came back few minutes later and try to give us a weird reason again why they show $22 but charge 24.95, at that point I lost complete patience and just sign and left.  I'm a foodie and have never left a 1 star review before.  I'm not sure if they were short handed but the type of bad service just left a bad taste in my mouth, i would never go back and eat here again.",oQ3mwGfsioDLXC4hiO7xEQ,1,1,1,TQSm1FJP9GapAvsf26rs4A

It seemed like family night when we walked in because there were 3 or 4 other families eating there. I decided to go with the shabu shabu, while my wife and son went with the sukiyaki. 

The 6 oz prime rib-eye ($14.95) dinner was sliced very thin and spread out on a plate. It came with a plate of vegetables (onions, carrots, mushrooms, lettuce), tofu, and udon noodles. The shabu shabu pot was filled with a seaweed broth and once it got up to temperature it only took a few seconds to cook the steak. Accompanying the ingredients are two sauces -- a sesame sauce and a ponzu sauce. The quality of the meat was good, with plenty of marbling throughout, and the sauces added a nice extra dimension to the flavor of the beef.

My wife wasn't as impressed with her vegetable platter ($8.95). It was basically all the same veggies that I got -- just two plates of it. She was expecting a wider variety of veggies. We also got a side order of chicken ($5.95) for our son. The sukiyaki pot is a shallow iron pot similar in size and depth to a cheesecake pan. The food is then cooked in the dish after the soy sauced-based liquid in it heats up.

After trying both the shabu shabu and sukiyaki, I have to admit  prefer the latter. The ""stir-fry"" quality of the chicken had much bolder flavors and was much sweeter than the shabu shabu preparation.

The style of cooking makes for a fun, interactive experience and would be good for couples on dates or families with older kids who like asian food.",C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w,3,3,3,JzrUwArSNXvynpj7gdWnug

Instead of the typical oily asian food, you get a clean cut taste at Swish. I've been to Swish a couple of times and everytime I've ordered the Shabu Shabu....maybe next time I will move on to the Sukiyaki. In any case, with a side full of veggies and some meat I definitely feel like I'm eating healthier. The taste may be a bit bland to some people but that's why there's condiments to make it salty, spicy, etc. It may be a lil pricier than the Chinese Hot Pot, but Japanese food is more expensive in general. I have never had to order the ""hungry"" portion and I always leave full. Service is good, nothing too fancy here. Overall, I say let's go to Swish especially since now we get 20% off our bill with the 2010-2011 Entertainment book excluding Friday and Saturday.",sa5zd7bwBQzajQB48Y9SUw,5,5,4,79zmXaos2RS8jZX5J2LJdQ

4346362,2016-12-04,2,C1jQ5CbszJkS_cyWgaRVGQ,"Subpar restaurant that is empty for a reason. Be aware:

1. The Groupon is misleading and forces customers to order from a different section of the menu that's $8-10 more than the lunch specials for the exact same portions. This negates the Groupon discount entirely and I've found businesses have been resorting more and more to these shady tactics to use Groupon to draw customers in then skewering them with high costs or bizarre rules to compensate for the ""discount"" they're providing. This blindsided us when it was time to pay the bill.

2. The meat cutter had no gloves on while he was working the machine to cut the meat. There was a bucket of water by his feet and towel that he kept reaching into to wipe the counter. He went from bucket to the meat. 

3. Food is subpar. The meats and veggies are medium to low quality with an off color that you can see by viewing the photos in this Yelp entry.

4. Service was middle of the road and there was a language barrier. We had to repeat our order and clarify it multiple times. 

5. Portions are skimpy, you will leave hungry. Don't let the photos fool you-- the meat covers the plate but it's cut razor thin. Each slice is paper thin.

At nearly $30 per person this place is way overpriced for boiled meat, rice, and frozen vegetables. 

For excellent shabu, check out Yojie Japanese Fondue instead. Superior quality meat, better location, better interior, and better service for the exact same price.",dJtFy2jc1R5cSBab4BLORQ,10,1,1,2A0nAQHgv2nXH92CDz73gg

They have bar style seating that wraps around the middle of the dining room and then there are tables around the perimeter of the bar. We were the only people in there at the time, so the service was quick. The staff was very friendly.

I had the prime rib with veggies that you cook yourself on the hot plate. It was all you can eat, so I put down some prime rib. It was okay. The one thing I did not care for is that my server was slicing my meat with her bare hands on a meat slicer. She did not use gloves or wash her hands before picking up the Rib eye. I also did not see her clean the meat slicer after using it several times.

Now that may seem like a cheap way to start a review, but after dining at this Sahara Swish last night (thanks to seeing Misti Y.'s review!) I can safely say that both places offered me the same quality of food.  I will say though, the staff at this location was much more attentive and checked on the customers more often.  However, that can also be a side effect of how the restaurant is set up, with your hot pot sitting on the inside of the counter space; so it's up to the employees to control the heat of your stove.  A little odd since I think I'd rather have control over it, but in the end it didn't affect my meal or experience.

Referencing my original review, I started off by saying, ""This place is now on my list of, ""I don't care if I ate this earlier this week, I'll eat this again tonight!"" foods.""  And that statement stills rings true.  I ate at the Spring Mountain Swish for lunch on Thursday (enjoyed their Mushroom Party, which is a great name for a dish), and dined here at the Sahara Swish for dinner on Friday (and, gasp, got the Vegetarian Delight!).

Although the major obvious difference between Swish on Spring Mountain and Swish on Sahara is the setup, another difference is that they are managed by different people.  I'm not up to snuff on the whole background story, but even with different owners, you can find me at either location.

4869548,2009-11-22,0,C1jQ5CbszJkS_cyWgaRVGQ,"Additional update: 2/25/2010 - The first Swish location on Sahara did re-open, but they also opened a new location on Spring Mountain (edge of Chinatown).  We went to the Sahara location, and the food was the same as before - excellent - but many of the non-pot-cooked items are no longer available, which is a shame.  Our 6 year old loved the chicken teriyaki bento they used to offer, but, in an obvious and understandable effort to streamline their menu, cut back on kitchen requirements, and ultimately save costs, that was no longer offered.  So we now have a hot-pot only menu (shabu shabu or sukiyaki).  Thankfully, they still offer their full array of mushrooms - not just 2-3 kids like at Shabu Shabu Paradise.  I would still rate Swish a little behind Sh Sh Paradise in overall experience.

Still waiting for the re-opening of Swish on Spring Mountain.  Unfortunately, the new location won't be as convenient for us, and being close to Chinatown (or right in it, not sure from the address #), Swish will get more competition.  Its old location further north on Sahara made it more convenient and less daunting a trip out for the whole family (especially on weeknights when we wanted to enjoy Shabu Shabu relatively quickly).

Food-wise, I'd rate Swish and Shabu Shabu Paradise (Henderson) about equal.  I like the appetizers at Swish a little better, as well as the fantastic mushroom plate, but the preparation of the shabu shabu ingredients was fresher and cleaner at Sh Sh Paradise.  We're also not fans of counter seating, so Shabu Shabu Paradise was a much more relaxed and less of a ""rubbing elbows with strangers"" experience than Swish.  Still...both are great.

My first disappointment was the flavoring. My food today tasted really bland for some odd reason. Then I tasted the broth, and even though I got spicy miso and got it ""extra spicy"" meaning extra miso paste, it tastes like pure water. I had to add a lot of garlic and soy sauce for some flavor. The Goma sauce was also very watery.  It's not as flavorful as it normally is. I've had the shabu at the other swish and thought it was flavorful. This location, unfortunately, lacked a lot of it. 

My second disappointment was at the service. It's not that they were mean or unattentive... It was that they were weirdly attentive at random times. They were very nice, don't get me wrong, but this one guy asked if he can take my plate away but I had a meat left so I said not yet.  He literally stood there until I ate my meat. Also... They turned the flame for my off twice prematurely... Before I finished all my meat.. And I had to ask them to turn it back on.   I guess since its like an island they have to stand somewhere... So maybe they just stood in front of me cause they were not needed elsewhere. Again they were very nice. 

I did leave very full and pretty satisfied. Enough sauce will do the trick. The food was by no means bad.. I've just had better. :).",CQZpblGIHeMlD7KqNP7J7Q,2,1,3,rWhNBCX4R2MUeEGfnCMViQ

My partner and I came here during my bday weekend out in Vegas after I bought a Groupon online. We weren't sure what to expect as we'd never been to anything like this before, and there isn't anything even remotely similar to this where we live. 

After getting seated, our server Paul was very accomodating, explained everything to us and was patient even though we had a million and one questions. 

The way it works is this:
You choose your meats/seafood you would like, as well as the broth it will be cooked in, then they bring you your pot and veggies to begin cooking while you are waiting for the meat. You place the veggies in the pot, swishing optional, and allow it to cook based on desired consistency. Then, they bring the meats and you do the same thing. 

Once again, Paul was super awesome and made sure to come check on us often, making sure we were enjoying our meal and didn't need anything else. At the end of the meal, he was even nice enough to give us a birthday dessert which was absolutely amazing!

The only gripe I had was that our stomachs were so full from the wonderful swish pot that we weren't able to fully eat our delicious dessert and couldn't really take it with us because it was honey toast ice cream.

Overall, I would definitely recommend this place and wish Swish all the best! Hopefully they are very successful and one day can expand out to our neck of the woods!",27Lndpej7sSgjr8wEsX79w,1,1,5,H1vL7XOwoOdI7GY5J3goDA

The sign in front of the restaurant said they had vegetarian options, but I couldn't find many in sushi form.  I ended up ordering the seaweed salad, and it tasted fresh and delicious.

5199111,2010-06-17,7,C1jQ5CbszJkS_cyWgaRVGQ,"I have been enchanted by the darkness-- the darkness of sukiyaki. Forget shabu. Ever since I visited Shabu Shabu Paradise, I have craved that teriyaki sweetness of sukiyaki to fondue my little heart out. Honestly, I have tried every do-it-yourself culinary trick in the book, and besides Korean BBQ, sukiyaki is now the only one I endorse. Unfortunately, Paradise is a bit too far for regular visits, but Swish is right around the corner. So the other night when my craving hit, my hub and I decided to give Swish a swirl.

The set-up at Swish is a little informal with a long central bar and seats all around. It's like you are seated around a runway and the incredibly gracious servers run up and down delivering you the goods. The servers are landing from the planet of niceness. The burners sit on the inside of the bar, which can create some precarious dipping, so practice your chop skills ahead of time.

Now, for the eats: The sukiyaki is served in a shallow bowl, which can create an interesting opportunity to treat your sukiyaki like a skillet stir-fry when the juice gets low. This is a smart call when you're fixing up the udon noodles. We ordered the vegetable selection, and I like that the plate includes asparagus and carrots. Of course, there is the standard cabbage. All in all some good veggies, but I want to dip every known vegetable in the sauce, except for mushrooms. They are not really a vegetable, so stop trying to trick me. For those who have a mushroom aversion, you can ask for extra something else to replace the fungi. We have been twice, and one evening the vegetable plate was a bit more generous, and the tofu mysteriously changed consistency. One evening is was medium firm, and the next evening, soft. It did make me consider a 3-star rating, but... nah.

The sauce here is good, and they add an extra helping of garlic if you like. They might use a tad more mirin because I think the sauce is notably nice and tangy. 

The prices are reasonable, but I must say for a bit more money, I like the idea of unlimited refills on veggies and tofu, which you get at Shabu Shabu Paradise. Those words (""unlimited refills"") are like magic. 

But, location, location, location is always a factor, and Swish is right around the corner, so I am sure you'll find me and the hub there again soon dipping and rhyming. Well, maybe not rhyming.",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,16,16,4,em9V4TPQ8T6_12vdVQJsiQ

My burner was on high heat as my broth was bubbling over and cooked my veggies quicker than everybody else's. Where's the meat?

There were only 3 people working and it got busy just a few minutes after we got seated. One guy was still slicing our prime rib eye and almost all of my veggies and noodles were already cooked. Where's the meat?

I got the prime rib eye sukiyaki special which comes with a sushi roll and an appetizer for $25. One person in our group got AYCE meat sukiyaki for $30 - that doesn't come with sushi/appetizer. They also offer AYCE sushi for $20-26. For mine, I picked the Sahara roll and chicken Katsu. My plate of meat finally came and I was overwhelmed by the amount of food in front of me. I'm glad I didn't do AYCE as I had a tough time finishing all my food which rarely happens! It was delicious.

I can't complain about the service at all. They would pour more broth on my pot every now and then. No matter how crazy busy they got, they still managed to smile. Patience goes a long way. C'mon, 3 people attending to 30 diners, slicing meat, cooking food, making sushi, pouring broth, handling payments, busing tables and still smiling?

5363178,2012-12-15,0,C1jQ5CbszJkS_cyWgaRVGQ,"Le sigh at the people who went to a Shabu Shabu restaurant for vegetarian entrees and sushi. There is a vegan restaurant next door and a sushi spot down the street.

I love Swish, and I actually prefer this location to the one in Chinatown. Yoshi is a waiter who is a mainstay there, and he's very attentive and quick. I think the setup of the place is really conducive to the waiters being able to serve you, and you being able to cook and have space to eat. If you're going with a group bigger than four, I'd recommend trying to reserve the section closest to the door because that curve will make it easier for people to see each other and talk. This restaurant is most ideal for 2-3 person groups, or those who are more focused on the food than the conversation. I love my friends, but when I go here, I must confess the food really grabs my attention.

When I go, I normally start with the deep fried gyoza. For the main course, I get a hungry prime rib sukiyaki. Shabu shabu has a much more subtle, savory flavor. I like the sweetness of the sukiyaki. Sides include rice, udon noodles, and veggies (cabbage, spinach, different kinds of mushrooms, tofu, carrots, broccoli, zucchini, onions and green onions). I will very rarely consume an entire hungry portion, but it makes for fantastic leftovers.

Make sure to have them add garlic and you can ask for ""the spices"" which include chili oil, chili paste and chili pepper. I usually add a little chili oil and pepper to the sukiyaki, sprinkle the pepper on the meat before I dunk it, and put chili paste into the rice. Remember to start off with a little and just add more to it. You are seasoning your food, not trying to rip yourself a new one.

There is a direct correlation between how long you let the food cook and the intensity of its flavor. I'd say you have enough different foods and pieces of meat to experiment and find out which is optimal for your taste buds.",b8VLOP2Juoqen4ySh0-JOw,3,0,5,J0HeX5Y1ZxMIgm4gsyFmgA

Shabu Shabu is pretty eay to prepare and cook at home if you can get some fresh ingredients especially the great quality of the meat. The important thing is to have the meat sliced really thin (it almost tears apart when you pick it up) and then to select meat that has good marbling. Otherwise, the meat will taste too chewy and tough when cooked.  I really wish we have a good Japanese grocery store nearby some time soon :)

Anyways, I am still being lazy to cook, I often go to Swish to enjoy doing  ""swish swish""  :)  It is a noise that is made by the meat being dragged through the bubbling kombu dashi broth, right? hehe.....  I think Shabu Shabu offers a wide range of nutrition in one dish.
I love Shabu Shabu because it is cooked without any oil or butter. Also, by being cooked in a hot broth, any extra fat is removed from of meat. I go to Swish once in a while if I am craving for some good Japanese hot pot since it is located relatively close from where I live.  
So far, I have tried..,
1) Shabu Shabu Style with Rib Eye
2) Shabu Shabu Style with Vegetable
3) Shabu Shabu Style with Salmon
4) Sukiyaki Style with Kobe Chuck or Rib Eye

All dishes come with fresh veges(napa cabbages, carrots, onions, green onions, & all sorts of different mushrooms), tofu and udon rice noodles.

Dipping sauce for Shabu Shabu they serve: 
   *Creamy Peanut Shabu(good dip for the veges) -a sesame, soy sauce, lime juice, & brown sugar sauce. 
   *Pon Shabu (good dip for meat)-a ponzu (citrus), soy sauce, vinegar, dashi sauce.  I always ask for lots of minced radish to add on :)  Very tasty!!

When I'm in a mood of getting Sukiyaki, I ask for a raw egg(either you can eat as a dipping sauce or you can cook it in a broth. Very yummy!!) Of course I always ask for minced garlic and chili sauce, too. What I like about Sukiyaki dish is that the flavor becomes more intense and delicious. And I enjoy eating my udon noodles which can be added to the pot of broth at the end to absorb the appetizing liquid, yummmmm!

Always, the wait staffs are attentive and friendly. My water gets refilled frequently and also they will ask u if you want more of extra broth.  I am always happy eating here :) :) :)  It is delicious, wholesome, pretty diet friendly (except for the beef), and full of vitamins.

I hope one day we have more variety of Shabu Shabu places that we can try out like Genghis Khan Style or Korean Style Shabu Shabu places in Las Vegas.  Only different thing about these places are you can begin to make the porridge(leftover meat and veggies in the rich flavor of soup).  Once the rice starts to bubble, you can season the porridge by adding the chopped garlic, black pepper, chili powder, ponzu sauce and the salt.

Most of all, Shabu Shabu is something that you can really enjoy eating together with your family or friends :P  Ahh, I am getting hungryyy again :^9",h0wxG2EiDLhgKjIzI8j2Mg,8,5,4,Pz1QmMbZdb6LLj4ZkkKDyQ

However, I found my first sukiyaki experience to be fun and fascinating! 

If you've never had a sukiyaki-style experience, I highly recommend going with a friend who has. The server spoke very broken English, so luckily my friend knew enough to teach me the basics. 

If you're looking to have the experience on a budget, definitely check them out at lunch, as their prices are about half that of dinner.",R1xxRcTY3RpfDtGjisYEjg,1,0,4,IftAk7vWc8wo40p2Ed2Nyw
5825330,2018-01-14,4,C1jQ5CbszJkS_cyWgaRVGQ,"The first time my wife and I went here, we used a Groupon that stated ""worth of hotpot or shabu shabu for two or more people."" Decent customer service and attended to our every requests, such as giving us sesame seed oil with salt.

The second time we went, we wanted to try their all-you-can eat special. We arrived at 8pm and our server told us they will close the kitchen at 8:30. Swish is open until 9pm. We decided it was not worth eating there, if we only had 30 minutes to order. So, technically they close at 8:30, due to the fact you can not order after 8:30.

The third and last time, we purchased a Groupon that stated ""worth of hotpot or shabu shabu for four or more people."" Initially, we purchased that Groupon because we thought we were able to receive four people worth of shabu shabu. When we arrived, our server stated we needed four people in our party to redeem the coupon. Since it was only the two of us, we decided to try their all-you-can special. 

Before our meal was brought out to us, we requested sesame seed oil with salt. Our server quickly said ""We don't have that here."" We explained to him that we have received it before. Keep in mind, there were only two other people dining in, so they were not busy at all. We asked if he could check. He agreed, but we can see that he had an attitude. When he arrived back, he stated that they did not have sesame seed oil. We decided we were not going to deal with his attitude, so we talked to him and asked for the owner. We explained the situation to the owner and he responded back with ""So, what do you want me to do about it?"" We left after that and never came back.",emvQCjBEtg6O0nNvSW-hcA,4,1,1,hdGNoyyzw2_xVHNmLhicOA

Diane and I arrived with another couple, and after hearing my choices I immediately elected the AYCE Sukiyaki option.  Miso Soup was fragrant tasting, with a few Green Onions mixed in.  Sushi was late in arriving but was cool and good.  Pieces were small on a cut roll, but 8 pieces for $3.00 seemed like a steal.  I liked the Spicy Tuna Roll better than the California Roll, but both were tasty.

Servers were exceedingly friendly and patient in explaining the difference between Shabu-Shabu and Sukiyaki, and available cuts of meat.  Golden, lightly deep fried Calamari fingers were a superb appetizer.  

Gas skillets dotted both sides of the long bar-like counter, with restaurant staff situated in the center area to assist diners.  I had AYCE Prime Ribeye.  The beef was thin and tender like carpaccio, but did not crumble like Diane's 8 ounces of Filet Mignon (a ""Hungry"" portion).  By the time I finished eating, I had a famished man's portion: 2 full trays of Ribeye, 2 platters of assorted vegetables including spinach leaves, Napa Cabbage, white onions, carrots, zucchini, broccoli crowns, Enoki Mushrooms, Udon Noodles, and two extra bowlfuls of White Mushrooms.

A staffer was helpful in converting my remaining Sukiyaki to be finished in a soup bowl.  Hot Tea and white steamed rice were good, except the rice grew cold while I was distracted by necessary cooking.  She was right about one thing.  Once things got rolling, the beef was cooked with one turn in about 15 seconds.

I selected Strawberry and Mango Mochi for dessert, and Diane and our friends were given fresh peeled orange slices so they wouldn't feel left out.  The Mochi was served as 8 small cut pieces that were good for about 2 bites each.  But they were cold and refreshing pieces!

This was a fun meal.  Some good pot utensils provided by the house eased the stress of cooking and pulling out cooked food in a timely manner.  I suspect I will be back!",s2o_JsABvrZVm_T03qrBUw,4,5,4,UgEyfvpt4PrQe31SRL937A

I've been spoiled by the Shabu places in Orange County so I don't know how this place compares to other places around Vegas.  The sauce here was just ok, the meat and veggies were not as fresh as I'd like them to be, and overall, the flavor was just lacking.  Also, there was no soup base at the end for my udon (I'm used to Cali Shabu Shabu's way I guess).   My boyfriend ordered the sukiyaki I think and it tasted exactly the same as my shabu- just dipped in soy sauce.  Overall, the service was good.  There was only one girl that was working at the time and she was attentive and nice.  I don't know how it'll get if more people come in later though.  One waitress for the whole store?  I see complaints coming.",9Gv5TQKWk1t_PS9ihgJKHg,0,0,3,49mU0VrNLfeTv5_OFBcWPQ

I agree with a load of the other reviewers that the place does need to be spruced, the hand written signs need to go and the fridge with beer in it needs a faux makeover.  The place has a lot of potential and this is why I'm giving it a fiver.  I always order a couple veggie rolls and the veggie shabu.  I'm rather addicted to the sesame sauce and could down a gallon of it easy.  I like the place for the fact that I always get good service, not just because its always bloody empty when I go but they are attentive.  I would like to see this place do well and would help them out in a heartbeat.  Great happy hours, which is most of the  day and night really. 20percent off your a la carte and as Claudia mentioned 2 for one sake.
Cheers

Oh and bring a jumper, it's always a bit chilly in there. Just until you add all the pepper sauce to your hotpot.",EFUJubEsRj0vRbOutivV3A,1,1,5,ck03WXUlUe47R6eAlXq49A

Decent taste.
It is little different than the real Japanese one that I used to have while in Japan; however, It is still the best in vegas.

5969847,2016-03-13,1,C1jQ5CbszJkS_cyWgaRVGQ,"Took some friends to experience SWISH. We all opted for the all you can eat at $27 each. We ordered two different kinds of beef and one chicken. The beef is sliced thin and place on one plate while a second plate has vegetables. There are several kinds of broth you can start with  I like the spicy miso. Another is teriyaki  you can then add onions, garlic, and spice sauce to your taste. 
The servers were very attentive.  The continued to adjust the flame and add more broth. Two of us ended with 2 plates of meat. 
The sign says 60 min limit for all you can eat - we were eating and chatting casually and didn't come close to 60 minutes. We never felt rushed to finish. If anything we were offered if we want more food  
Very enjoyable time with a group.",p30VbeNZC6mzRUTL6lg69w,0,0,5,qPsRRgUuFKD37k54d4WNqg
5995142,2018-01-17,1,C1jQ5CbszJkS_cyWgaRVGQ,"I'm a huge fan of this place! It's not your average restaurant where you sit and dine with friends. Instead, you're seated in a large rectangular bar where you sit close to other patrons who are enjoying their meal. If you're not in the mood for strangers near you, I don't think this is the place to be but the food really delivers. 

We took advantage of the Groupon deal which was $30 for an al a carte for two. It was me and my friend who went which was a pretty good deal because we only paid $9 for the entire meal afterwards. 

The service was okay, but it was memorable enough. We went on a Wednesday night thinking it wouldn't be busy, but boy was it packed. We waited for a good 30 minutes to get seated. The attendants were very helpful after they realized that it was our first time there. They taught us how to cook our food with the broth. First, was the vegetables because surprisingly, they cooked longer than the thinly sliced meat. Once, you're ready you ""swish"" the meat in the broth until it's cooked which is a duration of about 20 seconds. Depending on your broth, you eat it with or without a dipping sauce. Because my broth wasn't as rich as others, I was served with a peanut sauce and one which I believe was soy sauce. Delicious to say the least. The meat  was tender and the rice to wait with that was perfect. 

My friend also felt the same way as he devoured his three options of meat. 

Overall, this was quite the experience with delicious flavors working together for an exquisite meal.",PJjpm8Kb4u2DHvj8yBhn0w,3,1,5,cyFZ4DYfO2uSql_ksHBb8w
