I'm giving it 5 stars because the employees were very friendly and courteous. I'm going to give the overall place 4 stars thought because the room that we were in smelled like a bathroom. It made my experience a bit unpleasant.

The first time we came here we were unable to get a room, I forget if it was because our sister was underage at the time. Nevertheless, we were hungry and decided to eat dinner here. We ordered the Specialty french fries, chicken wings (soy garlic and korean spicy sweet), spicy rice cake, and mild ramen with egg. THE FOOD IS AMAZING. My favorite is the specialty french fries although I wish they had 2 eggs instead of one and the soy garlic chicken wings. My siblings were pleased by the food, nothing was bland or dry. 

The second time we came here, we were able to get a karaoke room and soju! The lychee soju was great. I love the karaoke rooms, probably the best I have been to so far. They have so many songs to choose from (english, korean, japanese, filipino) and you can adjust the settings. The karaoke system here had the best sounds. They even have tambourines in the room that people can play while singing. 

I don't think 4 hours of singing was enough for the 4 of us. Wish we could've stayed longer. Will come again if I am in a singing mood or just want to eat good pupus.",msp9JSI3tCUAP6JEtOyjZg,1,1,5,xrPM-as_HA37DLmPI_Db1A

The only downside perhaps was the wait (as expected on a Saturday night) as we were given a 45 minute expected wait time that ended up closer to 1.5 hrs.

We got a medium size room.  More than enough for us.  Their song selections were pretty good too.  We stayed till closing & it didn't feel like we were being rushed either.  I'd definitely come back here for sure as probably our go-to spot.  From what I remember, the pricing for the room wasn't too bad either.

Then again, no one wants to see your drunk a$$ roaming around lookin' like a hot mess. Hahaha! Maybe turn up the lights up just a tad bit??? Anyhow, this place is fun!

1438078,2017-04-05,2,3pSUr_cdrphurO6m1HMP9A,"Came here for my friend's surprise b-day party recently on a Saturday evening. We had kept the birthday boy with us while eating dinner while the rest of the party got essentially the largest room this place has to offer (Room M - located in the far back of the venue, the last room to the left). Since we were rushing in for a surprise, we didn't look at the beginning at the venue and went to the room. 

Located next to Marugame Monzo, it is along with other places in one of the hardest strip malls to park at. Most of us has had multiple experiences in the difficulty of parking in this strip mall. Theres so much this strip mall offers, and not enough parking. There's tons more parking located 2 building back but theres no easy way to access it. 

Room M is the largest room they have to offer (I believe). It has 3 long tables lining the sides of the room with a large TV in the front and smaller TV to the rear. This room can easily fit 20 people with probably room to spare. Theres enough room that even with the seats filled, the center of the room Is still empty for uh ... ""entertainment"" XD This room prices at I believe $60/hour, which isn't bad if you have enough people to split but the drinks stack up. Between a few of us, we had gotten a bucket of Cass (6 bottles) and a large bottle of Lychee Soju. Seats were fairly clean but the tables would do a better cleaning. We were given complimentary French fries to each table in the room. What was surprising was the microphones are both wireless. Never had seen that in karaoke places here. And each microphone has a replaceable cover over it too. 

We had paid separately. Due to possibly the size of the room or maybe the number of people, they had placed an automatic 18% gratuity, plus the bucket and soju totaling into mid 30s, which resulted in the bill getting to mid 40s after the gratuity. 

Not much of a fan of kararoke esp since majority of the songs I listen to aren't usually available nor am I much of a singer.. Quite the shy type XD",Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,2,2,3,IGzOKMKMN64e_4qwIrueFw

The drinks were stiff here and well worth the price and we tried some bar snacks that were even better than expected.  Get the Ranch Fries and the Corn Cheese.

They are open until 5am and they have songs in English, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, Chinese, Indonesian, Thailand and even some Russian songs. They had a great selection of English songs with the top hits throughout the years as well as the newest songs playing on the radio today. As expected their Vietnamese selection wasn't nearly as glorious but it was not bad at all. What amazed us the most was how there was NO WAIT?!?! compared to this really busy place my friends usually go to. It is only $20/hour and half off during their happy hours between 6-9pm. 

Each room has two TV screens so you can either sing while sitting down or you can get up and really perform for your friends. They even have these tambourines for anyone who wants to really feeling the music. They also had pillows giving these rooms a very comfy homey vibe. They also have wifi available for guests. The password is in the front. 

The remote controller was a bit complex since it is made to adapt to multiple languages, but there is English markings on the essential buttons. For instance you can search by ""title,"" ""artist,"" ""language,"" and ""nation."" Once you found your song, you can either press ""start"" or you can press ""reserve"" to put it in queue. If you didn't know the song as well as you thought, there is also a ""skip"" button. 

DRINKs:
- Beer (Corona, Modelo, Heineken, Newcastle, Cass, Asahi, Tsing Tao) $4/bottle
- Bucket Special $18/6 bottles
- Coors light $5/16oz, $15/60oz
- Stella Artois & Blue Moon $6/16oz, $18/60oz
- Cocktail Soju $6
- Martini $10 
- Other cocktails $10 

Between the six of us, we each paid about $20 and it more than covered tax and tip for over three hours of fun. I really like how their machines have a scoring system and we always scored above 80s and even 100 twice!! Either the machine is extra nice or they just want to keep us in high spirits :) Regardless is our new go-to Karaoke spot in Vegas!! Woo Hoo!!",W81-CPVrM9c6F8XiNuEUvA,23,22,5,F0qNhZ_4xB7QMjantiwQ2w

I made a reservation online and did not hear anything from the bar until 30 mins before my reserved time on the date of event. I would recommend they implement a better follow up system. My party ended up arriving about 20 mins late. The room was held for us and not given to anyone else as I confirmed that we were on our way. The room size given was decent and fit 8-10 people but it smelled dirty. Some of my guest referred to a ""feet"" smell. During the night we had to use the restroom and YUCK someone had made a mess. Good news was the staff cleaned it as soon as we brought it to their attention, but the bad news is that it wasn't cleaned thoroughly. Finally, when I went to pay for the room at the end of the night I was told that the rate after 9pm was $20/hr. I informed the gentleman that this was not disclosed to me. Also they automatically charge a gratuity fee so be careful. The reason for my rating is lack of follow up, dirty bathrooms, smelly room and not being disclosed the correct rate when I initially asked for rates.

They also have this thing where if you review them on Yelp they give you a free shot! It doesn't even have to be a 5 star rating. When I first heard it I thought they were trying to buy off reviews but I asked them and they made it very clear that they'll still provide a free shot even if it was a 1 star review.

Okay so this place has such a cool ambiance. When you first walk in you will see tables because you can actually order food, drinks, and chill out while you wait for a room to open up (in our case, we didn't even have to wait more than 10-minutes).

We got their ""small"" room which had plenty of room for the 4 of us. They had 2 screens one in the front and one on the back wall. This is so you can sing your heart out while standing up and facing your friends.

The rooms are clean and I'm glad they have the microphone covers. Sanitary points for sure!

The song selection wasn't as much as I would have liked. They have some recent songs but not too many. They do have some international songs and a lot of Korean songs (if only I could sing to them). They have 2-pages of Tagalog songs. 

Sound quality was good... the music wasn't an annoying midi as compared to other karaoke places I've been to. I was going to take 1-star off for a lack of newer song selections but everything else made up for it. I do hope you guys add newer songs by the time I come back!

The drinks... delicious but not as strong as I would prefer.

We got to try their honey bread and it was DELICIOUS!

Their bathrooms are also clean. No complaints here.

Service was great! They were very friendly and attentive to our needs.

The bigger rooms can get a bit pricey per hour but isn't too bad if split between a ton of people.

The first time I came here, I had called in advanced to see if they even had any rooms available. A lot of times karaoke rental rooms fill up quickly and calling ahead of time will save you a drive if your group just can't wait. This was the case for my first visit.

That night I had called my usual go-to spot, Q Karaoke, to inquire about availability. But as always, they had no vacant rooms. And that happens all the time at that joint. That's when this place came to mind. As much as I frequent the Chinatown area/plaza, I have never been to J Karaoke until now. I usually go to Q Karaoke or A18 which are all along Spring Mountain Rd to save a lil drive, but now that won't be the case every time I get the need to bust out a vocal!

From the outside, the place looks very small. You wouldn't think there would be a long, stretched out hallway that runs all the way down from the entrance. As you enter, there are a few tables and chairs in front of the bar, with additional seating on the left side. Perfect for drinks and conversations with your group if karaoke is not the only thing on your list.

Just like most karaoke bars where you can rent out different sized rooms, each one is equipped with a call/service button if you need to order anything from their menu, if you have any problems with the sound system, or for just customer service in general. The first time I was here, the room my group was in had a slightly bad smell. Don't know what it was, but I'm hoping they at least tried to clean the room before letting us in.

The sound systems they use are really on point. It makes you want to rock your heart out and sing like nobody can hear you. The walls aren't as soundproof as other ones that I've been to, as we could hear what's going on in the rooms next to us, but no biggie. It's fun to hear your fellow peeps having a blast too. :]

Customer service has always been great. No problems there. All in all, I will be returning for good times. Love how they're open super late for Vegas standards. Perfect for those who can party all night long and want to do something that doesn't require going to The Strip :]",EEAoUs1w38JHfHZMeSdqPQ,6,6,5,k7aovkykuyjdKppLPN8qBg

Newest kareoke bar in China town I would have to say. The decor is kool & hip w/ chalk board walls w/ chalk writings. The entrance area has a bar & lounge  area w/ one wall full of books. Then in the back there are a bunch of rooms. 

The staff is SUPER nice & attentive. Greet you right away & get a room set up for you as fast as possible. 

The rooms are clean & some rooms are set up a little differently than most places which is FUN. the SOUND SYSTEM is AWESOME!!! makes any Singer sound good ahaaaahaha 

The music lists are always up to date w/ all the new hip songs which is the BEST! 

They also serve food as well which is ALWAYS a plus. 

JERKY COMBO $17.95 - we usually order this when we drink soju... it's dried squid...  dried fish... peanuts... & jerky & they come out warm which is always the best served w/ Mayo & sirachi sauce.

GLASS OF PINOT NOIR $6 - Robert mondavi... pretty cheap I would have to say ahaaha & it tastes good.

PEACH DELIGHT COCKTAIL $6 - SUPER SWEET hahaha & I typically like sweet drinks... but when you make a SWEET SOJU cocktail... they could be deadly..

BOTTLE OF SOJU $9 

SMALL ROOM $20 - this room could fit up to 8 people it's pretty spacious still I would say you could fit up to 10 comfy.

J karaoke is known as the best karaoke in town so I'll rent a room and experience the true story of J one of these days.",JaqcCU3nxReTW2cBLHounA,1,1,4,BRIrLLnZXZMp19HoW_Mv5g

There are a bunch of rooms you can rent that will accommodate different sized parties. The rooms themselves are kept well ventilated and cooled so you aren't feeling like a stuffed sardine.

Inside the rooms are benches, chairs and tables so you can sit and eat while watching people karaoke which is played on two screens. There are cute little laser lights in the room to provide light other than the tv cause you can keep the room lights off if you'd like.

They have a bar and kitchen in there and anything you order they will cater to your room. Their food was amazing! I had the coconut shrimp and I'm craving more!

We ordered onion rings, chicken wings, chicken bites and mozzarella sticks and everything was pretty tasty. It was soooo much fun!!",-PXJEs_9T0lRKpssxf3otg,1,1,5,K9bu98cvFq2yU5HN4gINjQ

Each employee was super courteous and fun and collegial to all. Facilities were clean, nicely decorated, and had a good sound system. Fair alcohol prices. The only thing was that a MAJORITY of the song selections were Korean. In a binder full of songs, there was maybe ten pages on English songs, and a lot of classic karaoke choices was not available. Also I wish they had a binder organized by artist, cause I think that would make a much easier to browse.

The staff are very helpful and kind. When you're in room there is a button you can press to call for service as well. There were two monitors in the room and the navigation of how to play songs was fairly simple.

Upon entering, you get a really nice feeling, there was a fireplace, a piano and tables and bookshelves with books. The bar has a nice selection of wine and spirits.

The staff took us to room J. There are 10 rooms (each room are themed differently) you can book a room in advance esp on the weekend. The rooms are very clean with comfy booths and tables and the karaoke machines. The call button is mounted on the wall if you need the staff just press the button.

Happy hour at 6pm were half off! Rooms are priced from $20/hr (for up to 8 people) and $60/hr for the VIP room for party of 30 people. 

We ordered Butter calamari & langustine, the calamari had no breading and it was one of the best calamari. The Korean Style short Rib Salad was amazing. Chicken thigh skewers were flavorful. The  chicken wings were crispy and sweet. For drinks we had half carafe Lychee martini.

The staff who helped us is super friendly and helpful and very quick with deliveries of food and drinks. As we walked in the room, he said 'let me start out with 2 bottles of water.' Anyone would think that was free but it wasn't. Not a big deal but just a suggestion for them to let us know it isn't free.

The staff here is so accommodating and the attention to detail is second to none. When you're ready to order food, drinks or have technical questions, just press the red button by the door. They literally run to your room within 10 seconds. There is also happy hour on the rooms from 6pm to 9pm! Since we arrived at 8pm, our first hour was $17.50 and then back to the full price of $35 for the second hour. They also asked if we were worked in the industry without us having to mention it upfront. The additional 10% off definitely helped. Just make sure if you have your employee ID or business ready at hand.

The room comes with two mics and two TVs on either side of the room so you can either be shy, or face your fears and sing your heart out in front of your friends. They also provided two tambourines for additional entertainment. The selection of music was pretty extensive. Many different languages that I won't even try to get into. The most impressive was how up to date the English section was. Even when we were settling the bill at the bar, they asked if we wanted a bunch of water bottles to go! Yes, please and thank you!

Overall I would definitely come back and take advantage of the whole happy hour next time so we can use more money towards food and alcohol instead. :)",bRzr5YuEIncFzG6_vYSwcw,7,3,5,GSwjxo3b4rXn7Z0YrsgwVw

J Karaoke is one of the highest rated spots in LV, so I called ahead to see if they could accommodate, last minute, a group of 10 people. They said, yes, and we headed that way.

Located in Chinatown, in a strip mall, I was the second to arrive. They have a bar up front and one member of our group had a drink already when I arrived. As we started spilling in, they showed me a couple of rooms and we grabbed the larger one. Good thing, because our group grew to 12 people. 

Private rooms, with 2 large tvs, 2 mics, disco ball and tambourine (this was the BEST prop for Karaoke). Song selection is offered in 3 languages. Staff kept the drinks flowing (full bar) and had snacks (edamame, fries, wings, etc).

A few members of the group acted like they weren't going to sing, but once inside the room and a couple of drinks, EVERYONE was singing and dancing. Our group lost track of time, because we were having so much fun.

I can't even imagine how many times I've been tipping them extra. For what kind of service? Sometimes we don't even order anything. So we've been tipping 38% the whole time for them to guide us to the room. I work in the restaurant industry to know well enough about customer service and that includes making sure that the food (if they order) is prepared to their liking, making sure that the customer is doing okay, if they need any refill on their drink, etc. They never came to check on us. Which is pretty normal at Karaoke bar, yes. Theres not much service necessary there. That's why putting automatic gratuity on a party of 5 is absolutely ridiculous.  And if they do, they need to let us know. At least highlight or circle the god damn receipt. I NEVER thought we could get auto gratted at a karaoke bar. For a FIVE top. Now that I know, it's not that big of a deal.. like I said, I always tip at least 20%.. but the thought of the fact that we've been tipping additional 20% ON TOP of the automatic  gratuity just makes me so upset.

5534791,2015-04-02,9,3pSUr_cdrphurO6m1HMP9A,"My crew was looking for a place to sing at since our usual spot (Q Karaoke) was remodeling. 

Upon entering, you get a really nice feeling since the ambiance is set by seeing a selection of wine and spirits along the wall behind the cashier counter that doubles as a bar.

The place is larger than it looks from the storefront and I think it has 12 rooms (each appeared to be themed differently) so you are almost guaranteed availability on a week night. The rooms are clean and well-appointed with booths, chairs, tables and the awesome TJ media karaoke machines. The call button is mounted on the wall next to the light switches so be careful if you are messing with the lighting options. 

Pricing seemed reasonable to me as import beers were only $4/bottle. Rooms were priced from $20/hr (for up to 8 people) and went up to $60/hr for the VIP room which can handle up to 30 people. 

The staff (especially Damon) is super friendly and helpful and quick with deliveries of food and drinks. A+ on the service!

Also, the artwork on the bathroom doors is a nice touch.

5750171,2016-02-25,5,3pSUr_cdrphurO6m1HMP9A,"This place is okay.

The employee handling the register was amped and hilarious, but it's just another karaoke place. There is nothing innovating about it when comparing it to other karaoke spots that I've been to. Their rooms are clean and the prices are fair if you watch yourself to the minute but if you don't and you add the overpriced drinks, there's no deal in this.

Their song list was decent, some choppy instrumentals. We had a 90's theme going that came to a road block when we found out they were missing some classics like ""Bug-A-Boo"" by Destiny's Child and ""Back Here"" by BBMAK!!!!

Let's not misinterpret me. This is a fun zone and I enjoyed myself a lot but when a place has a 5 rating I expect it to be the best of the best and this was nothing above average as far as the facility goes. The overall experience? Well we all know drunk karaoke will always be fun.",pU6GoRTcl1rIOi6zMynjog,5,5,3,Ka__X42PHh0CcxQUv5QehQ

The bar itself is really nice, and very clean. We were so impressed by the decor. You can sing in the lounge or you can rent a room. We were a group of 7 and it was only $20 an hour which is a steal compared to the karaoke bars in Seattle. There's a huge song selection in English and Korean. A huge TV and extremely easy to use Karaoke system. There's a button to ring for help so you can order without having to leave the room which is awesome.

The drinks are cheap, especially when you compare it to drinks on the strip. You can get a bottle of Soju for ONLY $9! They have a special that goes on, on Sundays and Mondays where you can get a shot of Jameson AND any bottle of beer for $8. I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw that.

The service is also fantastic. Super nice staff that's helpful and ready to help you with anything. Also really random but the restroom plays really lit music, it's awesome! I would definitely return the next time I'm in Vegas.",aF0BTeTVRXv4OHYXMNH7SQ,6,1,5,t8oBi3a0lzTJSSdFaIuB5g
