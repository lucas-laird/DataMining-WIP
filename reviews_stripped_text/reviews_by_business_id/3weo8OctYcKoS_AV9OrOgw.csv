2410995,2014-08-13,3,3weo8OctYcKoS_AV9OrOgw,"I'm really torn writing this review.

The pro's:
-The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable. I have no clue what I'm doing here, so they guided me through the whole experience. They were so patient as I basically was a deer in headlights.
-The juice was really good. I wish I could remember what this was supposed to do for my body, but I'm not really all that healthy. When it's this tasty, it makes a girl give her diet a second look.
-While I don't juice, I eat organic as much as I can. I take herbal supplements and will find a way to treat any illness with a natural cure if possible. That's the extent of my ode to a healthy life. Other than that, pass me a double cheeseburger. But again when, it's this good, it makes me want to at least juice in the morning.

Con's:
-It was pre-made in a bottle. I get it. From a time and efficiency standpoint, it makes complete sense, but I would rather watch it being made or else why not pick this up at Whole Foods. I get the shelf life and freshness piece, but do I really need to go to a storefront for only this one item and it's pre-made? Kind of disappointing.
-$10 a bottle. I know I get what I pay for. I'm sure it takes time to create plus clean up. I'm sure it's pounds of produce, and they have to pay everyone and all of the overhead.... But $10 a bottle is high for me to grab everyday. Let's say you went most days (5-6 days a week) that would be adding about $3000 to your yearly budget on juice alone. Crazy. Goodbye, Kilimanjaro trip.
-There's no real seating area. Take the juice, sandwich, salad and go. I like to eat what I buy right away, so I drank my juice and ate my food off of the hood of my car in the parking lot. It basically makes this place a very health convenience store. An expensive, healthy convenience store. Like a healthy, upscale 7-11 that only sells their own product.

So three stars it is because I do like the juice and the staff, but the pre-made juice at $10/bottle with no seating is something I can't quite wrap my head around.",PpaIA3DA_0Y_XpGHPxgjLg,13,3,3,hxn-IpjzpLoNaSSSb11f7A

Went to pick up the car rental and this was next door and my brother wanted to check it out.  The first wall I looked up at, there were unique names to products I was unsure of.

But hey, what the hell, try it.  

After reading the different ingredients to each smoothie, I went with one I was familiar with.  Almond milk, strawberries, bananas, vanilla, coconut oil, sea salt and ice.  I went with the Almond Delight.  It was definitely a delight.  Tasty.  My brother ordered the Pineapple Jungle which was good but I wasn't sure about one of the ingredients, bee pollen.  

Because of the prices, I told myself I wouldn't come back unless it was something I hadn't had in a long time.  Well...it happened sooner than I thought.  Returned the car a couple days later and we just had to stop by and try it again.  So good, convenient, but extremely pricy.

4488138,2014-11-05,0,3weo8OctYcKoS_AV9OrOgw,Very nice store with cool artwork. The employee Jen that worked there was very polite and helpful when I was kind of lost on what to drink. She went out of her way to explain all the different options of juice and food. I ended up getting the avocado sandwich (was amazing) and a green juice that made me full of energy. Will definitely be going back.,9SkCxhSPFVr28xkPXFAPCA,0,0,5,3MqLoS58Z0l8GaQq7V3LcA

4537335,2015-08-09,0,3weo8OctYcKoS_AV9OrOgw,"Came here for the first time on a Saturday morning. I'm always down for trying a new juice place, but this place failed to wow, but we have limited juice options here in henderson:

This shop has really limited options. I was bummed because they didn't offer any samples and I probably would have bought more but I just didn't want to load up and not like them. 

What I liked best was that they had a juice without an apple in it. (Tip, since Apple is cheap juice places will often use Apple to fill up the container) but this place has one without it. 

We tried the complete greens and I really liked it! (5/5).",wdDLGg9IZ9_tafvKQ7qShg,1,1,4,dkuEH5lsIVhbB7bSNSyThw

Being our first visit, the girl behind the counter not only informed us all about the juice and process, but gave us a taste of all the juices they have and I have to tell you, the juice they make there are some of the best I have ever had.  

They use a cold press to make the juice which captures more nutrients then a regular juicer and almost all were really amazing.  They have juices I have never seen anywhere before and the taste was really good.  

Another amazing thing about this place is they not only make the juice fresh to order, but they also make up several small bottles of their juices for sale which you can take home and have about a 3 day supply, REALLY?

I have not seen this anywhere else.  They do have a small selection of fresh foods as well, but being new they are working on putting together a to go menu.

I highly recommend this place if you are into juices, you will not be disappointed unless you don't go....",kzRq4H_nSf4b3F_sdymWSw,0,1,5,Ahri5ZCMPgaXKzjM4ntVBg
4989827,2014-09-01,7,3weo8OctYcKoS_AV9OrOgw,"Great concepts, especially for Las Vegas.  I was so excited to see a new juice place, but I can't say that what I had was amazing.  The balance was off on the green juice... too much parsley.  I couldn't finish it.  

I juice almost daily and tend to keep it quite green without adding apples or too many fruits.  I'm fine with the green flavors, which can be hard to get used to.  But this one wasn't good.  I felt like I was plugging my noise to get it down. 

I loved that it is organic.  However, the prices were too high.  Juices average $10-11.  Most places with these prices have a system where you can recycle their containers for $1-2 off on the next juice.  I might have missed it, but I didn't see this option there. 

I understand the idea that there are no amendments to their juices because its their recipe and juices aren't made to order, but it was difficult to get that concept with just their menus.  Several places outside of Vegas do this, but It took a little time to understand their way of business. They were friendly about answering my questions, but its not clearly explained on the menu or in the store.

I am not quite sold on this place yet, but I'm curious to come back.  The food menu didn't entice me, but I would like to try their smoothies.",W5UE4LllnPipYa0470mIwA,13,12,3,EuYyOmb_B8KPoRKlbGQoKQ
5006271,2015-11-18,0,3weo8OctYcKoS_AV9OrOgw,"TOO many people these days just want to complain! Yes, their juice is pricy. If you have ever eaten an all organic diet, then you would understand. I moved to NV from CA and THANK GOD for Juice NV!! I have never had a bad experience. My favorites right now are Pretty Woman, Enlightened, and Scam Artist. They also offer a beginner and advanced juice detox. So perfect for before and after the holidays!! I know it's crazy to order smoothies in the winter, but they're AMAZING!  Robbie & Haley are slowly becoming my new favorite people! Thanks guys, see ya next week!!",56zhEH4dDKRUilpl25S4AQ,0,0,5,VCnRpw5vicRmjb3m0entNg
5483171,2014-12-02,1,3weo8OctYcKoS_AV9OrOgw,"I love new businesses and learning new things!

I try to juice at home, but get lazy and this place was great. I'm still new to the trend and the staff was very informative and so nice! I have no prices to compare with this, but juices range from $10-$12 a juice depending on what you get. Plus, I can try new juice combinations without making it in bulk. They have a huge range of juices and smoothies to choose from!

You can buy a single juice, smoothies and veggie/vegan food options. You can also buy a days worth of a juice cleanse (I can't remember if they come with 5 or 6 varieties of juice).

Can't wait to try more!",yOFzUkDz6edZTVJdXskqCw,0,0,4,wkZrqPI0GW4NKhvGgdVtMQ
5801506,2015-03-02,0,3weo8OctYcKoS_AV9OrOgw,Very pricey. My visit met with some items on menu not available and they were out of 16oz cups so I was handed two 8oz bottles at $5 each.  Not a convenient location as parking lot is a pain to navigate with the dozens of businesses in this center. Doubt I'll be back...mark me as disappointed. Fresh & Easy and other juice bars are half the price.,ZC6W4zvdjirWOFjpj3SEeQ,0,0,2,ReHOKmD0ReAlTVyN4lOh4Q

5993770,2015-05-10,0,3weo8OctYcKoS_AV9OrOgw,"I absolutely love this place! The juices are all amazing, as they offer samples of all they have to offer...but my favorite is hands down the green with nv. Not to mention the service is awesome, which I find hard to come by these days. I also feel it's important to mention the juices are fresh squeezed, cold pressed, and organic, as it seems many people appear to have an issue with pricing. My suggestion to you is to go purchase all the organic fruits and vegetables necessary to make a 16 oz glass of juice, and I can promise you that you'll spend at least $20. Yes, you'll be able to make a glass or two...but you'll also have to prep and clean up. So keep in mind you're also paying for the convenience of not having to do either of the two. The bottom line, this is a great establishment and I couldn't be happier that it happens to be right up the street from me. I'll be back whenever I don't feel like doing all the work myself, or simply to get out of the house. After all, the decor and outdoor seating is a winner as well!!!",CQm1OAqGQJvtE-B4jQRz0Q,2,1,5,ILxz5fb9h9ZohqGCrXyjww
