While the interior is nicely decorated, the food quality and selection is mediocre at best. They have about 15-20 selections and NOT the 45 items that another review claims. Surprisingly, they lacked the standard staples of lunch buffets like pakora, samosas, saag, and even kheer. While the naan and chutneys were ok, the currys and dahl were subpar. They tasted watered down and lacked the spice and complexity that they ought to have. According to their website, they were supposed to have some Indo-Chinese type dishes in their buffet but those items were completely absent. For dessert, they had some weird vermicelli served in a warm and sweet milk, reminiscent of kheer, but not tasting very good. Regardless, now that I know better, I'll be sticking with my tried and true favorites, i.e. Mt. Everest.",LkWNo83Lg92C5V4JEyxOZA,4,1,2,w7gQS5W0DAD8w-oi7V2LoA

India Masala offered a deal and had great reviews so I gave it a whirl. Upon entering, the host greeting me with a kind smile and quickly seated me at a nice table overlooking the dining room. Having pre-perused the menu, I knew I was going to try the Tandoori Dinner, as it offered a variety of menu samplings including Tandoori chicken, garlic chicken, chicken tikka & chicken sheesh kabab. I placed my order and enjoyed the ambiance of the dining room and watching the staff prepare for a large group of 40. Before I knew it,  my huge plate of deliciousness arrived with a basket of warm naan. My server was very attentive and consistently filled my water, all while starting to seat the large party. Everything was delicious and very filling- so much so that I had a 1/2 of plate to take back for midnight munchies or well, lets be honest since it is Vegas- 4a munchies! As I sipped on my Taj Mahal beer, watching the staff attend to this party with ease, my waiter reappeared. He was bearing with my house choice dessert (included with my dinner) : Pistachio kefir which was creamy beyond belief, had just the right amount of flavor, and was perfectly smooth textured frozen goodness.

I specifically wanted the Chicken Chili dish that I tried at one (only one unfortunately) of the buffets. Never saw it again at the buffet so had to order it for dinner. It's listed under appetizers on the menu. That made me think it wasn't a dinner sized portion. The waitress asked what spice level 1-10. Only had that asked at Thai restaurants. We ordered medium. Also ordered Saag Paneer at medium spice. I should have asked for everything to be served together because the chicken came out first. It was fresh and hot, and also blazingly spicy!!! DAMN! It was so flavorful and quite tasty with an insane depth of flavor...but SO HOT!! Couldn't stop eating it! The saag was just as hot but oh so fresh! Chunks of tomato with strands of chive on top. Could have used a little more salt I think, but a little too hot. Tongue went numb, which I don't mind if the food is outstanding. Also had rice and garlic naan with meal. I would have given 4 stars, but the spice level of the meal caused intestinal distress for a few days, which I usually experience eating Indian food. The spice level of the food at the buffet is far less than when you order off the menu. Dining here reminded me of the first time I went to Shalimar, which I thought was some HOT Indian food. I love Indian food, but for some reason gives me intestinal distress. India Masala is another great Indian restaurant in my 'hood (Mint, Ghandi, India Palace) which I am truly grateful for! Will go again and lower the spice levels. Extremely tasty food! Careful with the spice levels...10 must be unedible!",1JNqxJr8cDb689up53NGig,0,1,3,B1cilH54sUryBB-AFdK6ZA

You need to walk and get everything including the bread and lassi. What next ? Make the diners cook their own food ?

I had a coupon for a free buffet which I'm guessing they tried to compensate for by tacking on 18% gratuity to a party of five. Is that even legal?! There were no signs on the menu or by the cash register to justify this. The host didn't bother to tell me that gratuity was added to my total, and the receipt wasn't itemized. My receipt only listed a ""pre-tip total"" when they had in fact already included gratuity in the total.

577721,2014-03-04,2,yy7pPm_QGVRm6exD__Htug,"So this review isn't necessarily about the food. The food is fine, good enough comfort food with an adequate selection. This is more about the service. I used to frequent this place at lunchtime because it's decently priced, $9.99 on weekdays, $10.99 on weekends. On top of that, I'm a student so I sometimes get two for one discount coupons which is nice because I definitely live on a student budget. Let me just say that this pricing is VERY loose. It didn't take me long to realize that the price is RARELY $9.99, it's almost always $10.99 for one reason or another. For example...the restaurant is very busy, it's a ""holiday"" of some sort, or my personal favorite, ""the manager told me to raise the price today"" HAHAHA goodness. Ok then. We actually made a game of guessing what ridiculous reason we were going to be given for higher prices. Because of course 2pm on a Tuesday merits an increase in prices, right?

I had a few coupons for buy one get one free, any day of the week, between the hours of 11 and 3. Well of course that's too simple, it wasn't until after we finished eating that the...server? hostess? someone who appeared to work there? pointed to a tiny yellow sign stuck to the counter that said ""no coupons on weekends"" and she then proceeded to giggle and say sorry and mutter something about...well managers said so. I'd had it, I was done. It's just a joke of a restaurant, and having nonexistent service from start to finish, watching employees hang out on their phones and read the newspaper at the bar, no thank you. I work in a restaurant, and let me tell you, I wish my job was that easy. Thankfully, not all is lost. Delhi opened right down the street, their food is always fresh and flavorful and the staff is FANTASTIC! They remembered us after our second visit and are always so excited to see us and welcome us. On top of that, their lunch buffet is $9.99 every day, no exceptions. Heck, I'd gladly give them $12.99 and I really could care less about coupons, I want to see them do well:):) Such a better choice than India Masala!!!",V_CTZTVG1qYpGnnOUhf-Ug,7,1,1,BALubC2Qqm_yRzJ_JGNk1Q

The chicken tandoori was dry, iddly tasted powdery and the curries weren't as spicy or flavorful as before. The old waitresses used to be extremely friendly as opposed to people who ignore you now. 

Their only saving grace is they make dosas and decent nan bread. Unfortunately I'm not willing to go back just for that since there are so many other Indian restaurants. They also charge 15% service fees even though you don't have six people in your party. 

I wouldn't be surprised if they closed down if they keep this up.",H1fcbC-WKsbiEo8BBVkHwA,2,0,1,ZPAXCbLISPU7mn4VVxhymw

We enjoyed a very tasty Indian beer, Hayward's 5000, and finished with home made ice cream, mango and pistachio, both real nice.

872719,2012-09-08,0,yy7pPm_QGVRm6exD__Htug,"This is hands down the best Indian Restaurant in town. Went here for both lunch and dinner and was overwhelmingly satisfied each time.

Lunch: They're lunch buffet is HUGE! With $11, I was given a selection of 45 items. 45 dishes (15 is usually standard in any indian buffet)  in an Indian Buffet is unheard of. And it gets better. What makes India Masala stand out from its competitors  is that besides having nearly triple the quantity of dishes to choose from for less than $11, you're always in for a surprise. Unlike other traditional indian buffets, the items on the buffet at India Masala change everyday. Some traditional items such as Chicken Tikka Masala, Tandoori Chicken, Dal Makkhani etc. remain, but for the most part, dishes change each day. Also, it features both North & South Indian dishes in their buffet. In the end, best Indian buffet in Vegas. 

Dinner: When i step into any restaurant, there are 3 things I stick my neck out for: Food, Ambience, & Service. The food is phenomenal. My friends and I ordered a Family Dosa. Its a BIG BIG CREPE about 4 feet long! Also, I had the Chicken 65 as an appetizer, Lamb Madras Curry, and Garlic Nan. Chicken 65 was highly recommend by our server. It didn't disappoint. It was a dry red chicken. The flavor was quite different and thus hard to explain. All I remember is that each bite felt electric, literally. Lamb Madras Curry was also great. I ordered a spice level 7 and it was PERFECT. The curry had a great depth of flavor. Ambience is very beautiful. As for the service, this restaurant knows what it is doing.

975647,2012-11-27,0,yy7pPm_QGVRm6exD__Htug,"This review is for the BUFFET ONLY. Since I was so pleased with my food when I visited last time, I thought about trying the buffet. They had 3 types of chicken; tikka masala, tandoori and something called chicken veduppu(spelling?). I had a small piece of the veddupu chicken and it was really good and seemed to have good flavor. The tikka masala was ok.

I was hoping for atleast a couple of options of the indo chinese dishes, but all they had was a schezwan veggie dish, which was super super spicy and I could just have a few bites. They also had dosas which though fresh were not crisp, and were wrongly labeled as utthapam. About the labels-I would suggest that they take care to label food properly, as they had labeled the potato mix that goes with dosas as aloo gobhi(cauliflower potato). The mix itself was ok and had very large pieces of potato and was obviously not the original stuff served with dosas. So the 2 things I was looking forward to-south indian and indo chinese were seriously lacking in taste.
For veggies, they had a few options-okra, black dal, some veg curry. I tried a bit of the okra and dal and they were just ok.

Desert was pretty blah too: pink colored fruit custard and halwa. They need to really consider labeling and arranging the food in a logical order, as I remember standing in the middle of the buffet looking for rice, as it was placed next to the desert. The halwa was labeled 'kesari' which I think is a south indian version of halwa so I knew it was desert. However, for my non hindi speaking friends, it might have been confusing as it was placed next to the rice and could have passed off as a savory dish.

I guess these are initial glitches and I do hope they improve, as I would love to have one indian restaurant in Vegas that serves consistently good food.",g6pwf1E-CylnZQRoaZGGdw,3,0,3,XukPzMbCyWp2l5_EY9G3Vg

First, I saw the groupon for this spot. This was the only Indian restaurant that accepts groupon for their buffets, as the others you can only use it for a la carte. But, the lunch buffet is only 9.99, and the groupon is only available for food.

Walking in, the layout is pretty nice. Everything is very clean and well kept. After sitting down, I ordered a free mango lassi that is available with a yelp check in. Out of all the mango lassi's that I've had, India Masala probably makes my least favorite. I think the yogurt they were using was about to turn, because it had a sort of cheesy taste. Also, the mango flavor was too light. It tasted more like a lassi with mango, rather than a mango lassi.

Onto the food. The selection here is quite small compared to most places. The only thing that I liked was the pakora, aka the vegetable fritters. They were crispy and well seasoned. The rest of the items were pretty bland, nothing really stood out. Also, the palek paneer was pretty gross. As for the naan, it was a little bit doughy on the inside.

Delhi is still my go to place, followed by Mint. Since they are basically all the same price for their lunch menu, I think I'll stick to my favorites.",gtwM4ijo65AN4DvXdgCu_w,9,8,3,tglqjtnQZDqXv6OlBTH3Dg

1st disappointment- I ordered for dosa. After 5 minutes, I was told sorry no dosas available and the reason being chef has to switch from making rice/sabjis (curries) to make dosa, which is not possible!!! Then why is that on the menu??? 
2nd disappointment - after waiting for close to half n hour, there was no sign of food coming. When we asked about it, they said it's almost done. They served half of the order in next 10 mins and rest half was not coming. Next excuse they made is chef is new, so it's taking time. That too when not even half of the restaurant was full!!! By then i was fed up with their excuses.
Finally after 40 mins of wait my plate came. 
3rd disappointment - The food. My veg thali didn't have daal (the reason why i choose north Indian thali over south Indian). Palak paneer and naan were good.
Chole and matar paneer were not nice. So as gobi manchurian. They did offer 10% discount on our bill for the late serve. But we wanted good food and service, both were missing. Who wants to waste time on a vegas trip and get a bad experience!!",77Um0Q8F2aQbV8RyTcPncA,1,0,2,yEKjgOOu81Syz_d-g0hJWQ

After we finished the lunch buffet, all we could say... mediocre at best.

They have very limited selections, so we went with chicken curry and goat curry. The chicken curry was undercooked and watery. Naan was ok but rice was not.

Also, the service was slow - I had to wave my hand to get the water, and the server even complained that they were too busy. Yeah, I could see that because Tandoori chicken tray was left empty for the entire period of our lunch time.

If you think a limited selection and empty trays are the best way to maximize profit from a buffet deal, you won't be in this business long.

Considering that there are many great Indian restaurants, including Delhi Indian Cuisine, India Palace and Mount Everest, I wouldn't recommend this place.",ldqh2aWLTW6D2RHDCj_2TA,2,1,2,ZpNJPZy6EHRlo5H1GFNhng

1721301,2012-09-21,0,yy7pPm_QGVRm6exD__Htug,"I have no idea who writes these reviews, but this place has been waaaay overrated. Friends, maybe?   I am Indian and have been on a endless search for the best Indian food (still searching).   I figure if a place can do a decent Indian lunch buffet then they atleast serious about cooking authentic Indian food during non-buffet times.

 I went for the lunch buffet, which I admit must be mildly seasoned to broaden customer appeal yet can't be too costly for the restaurant to make a profit, but I expect flavorful seasoning and variety. Everything was underseasoned, not enough salt or hot spice...there really was none. 

The buffet had the appearance of being bountiful because of the meat and vegetables were in the front buffet. It definitely captivate the eyes and stomach of customer.  However once at the buffet I found it not logically flowing once at the buffet.  It does not flow logically, which would be flowing from appetizers and papadums, to rice, noodles, and breads then veggies and meats.  Here the buffet started  with plates, tandoori chicken, chicken tikka, fish curry, daals, vegetable curries...all very soupy items that probably should have rice or a starch served first so the sop up the gravies.   In addition, too much repetition. 5 Proteins- 1 fish curry and 4 types of chicken (tandoori, wings, tikka, and curry),  4 daals, and 2 batter fried vegetable and 2 cheap starchy filed vegetable dishes...a gobi filled with chana and a ""vegetable"" curry dominated by potatoes and peas. Not reflective of the delicious quality vegetables dishes Indian cuisine has been admired for.  No paneer, as a vegetarian source of complete protein instead of ANOTHER chicken dish?

Furthermore, a very disjointed buffet offering, sambar without idli or dosa? mint chutney and tamarind chutney without samosa or chaat?  Come on!  You give the facade of bounty, but it is incomplete.  You know better, but undermine true Indian Buffet fans in order to cut costs. There are a ton of Indian buffets that are better for the same price and most are around you.

While this commonly happens at most buffets, it seem to be with every gravy dish... all the ""good"" stuff was gone and it seemed once it was finished, it was finished. Yet coming at 1 PM and the buffet is from 11:30 to 3:00 pm...I do expect it to be replenished, but didn't see it happen in the 45 minutes I was there.  

Understandably the dishes were mild, but there should be some ""hot"" sauce/condiment offered...I didn't see any, but I also never asked for any.  

Out of all the dishes the tandoori chicken was the best, it remained juicy yet it was still underseasoned and DEFINITELY NOT cooked in a tandoori.

One of the more promising things about the restaurant was that the atmosphere was ""nice"" and up to date and most importantly the service was way above par of most Indian restaurants...as an Indian it is rare to get treated as well as ""non-Indian"" customers.  Here our water glasses were never less than half full, and they appropriately checked on us from time to time without fussing or discriminating.",ejBGQeL177ECBqgMXe7sdg,6,1,2,kXFM45OKHNeuQEED2eDkDA

My wife said her curry lacked flavor as well. The waitresses were extremely nice and attentive. Unfortunately, we will never go back, as the food was that terrible.

1926035,2015-10-10,0,yy7pPm_QGVRm6exD__Htug,"Delicious food. Friendly staff. Well priced for the quantity and quality of food. Enjoyed the Tandoori Sizzler.

The only reason I won't give it 5 stars is because the place is not always consistent in delivery of flavors, customer service, etc. However, if that changes I will gladly give 5 stars!

Do not be afraid - the lunch buffet is consistently 4/5 stars. Depending on the cook, it can be a 5/5. Two people can eat for just over $20. Naan is included, and they will make a few extra side items for you if you get to the buffet in the last hour and things are missing.

One problem I will point out with the buffet is the white rice - test it before you just start chewing. Towards the end of the buffet service, it can get very hard. They are nice enough that if you ask for a small bowl they'd probably give it to you. 

They have a deal with Yelp, where if you check in, you get a free soft drink.

The prices are totally worth it. We've eaten at two other Indian places within a mile of here (one in the Rio hotel and one in the plaza across from the Hard Rock) and both were of similar quality and taste to India Masala. Here, you will get better service and the same quality food for a great price.

Really, what more could you ask for? Oh, they also include mango lassi. Seriously!

The garlic naan is the first thing I get my hands on, fluffy and crispy and all for me. By far my favorite indian dish is goat curry, and I found it here on my first visit and really enjoyed it. Their tandoori chicken and various biryanis are also solid, along with their ultra-silky daal. I also like how light the batter is on their samosas and pakoras. Service while dining was attentive with refills and placing orders for additional dosas and naan, and the dining room is nicely appointed.

I knew from the start that it would be hard to find a place to compare it to but I was extremely satisfied with my dining experience here.

My fiancé and I took his little brother visiting from the east coast out to dinner since he was craving Indian food. We started out with a round of mango lassi. The drink was very tasty but would have been far more enjoyable if it was served cold.. (it was warm). 

I'm not even going to try and remember or describe was we ate by its name because I can't recall, but we had some naan and some poori to go with the currys we ordered (one lamb and one chicken). The lamb curry was my favorite, spice level was perfect and it was cooked deliciously too. The chicken dish was tasty but my fiancés little brother took that dish as his hostage.

My only complaint would be that their server was new and it was apparent when more people decided to come in. He forgot to bring my drink (a free coke with my check in) to the table and remembered almost 10 mins later.

After, I am glad we came in when we did.  The dinner rush came in 20 mins after we did.  Service? Outstanding!!  Waiters very tentative to us, but I felt that too many different servers approached us and made it difficult to keep track.  Our waiter that took our order gave me some good recommendations since I have not had India food before.  Our first app was the chicken 65.  65 different spices, I thought dang.  I'm gonna need lots of water.  Turns out, very flavorful.  Similar to carne asada since it was served with diced onions and cilantro.  Our main was the Masala Dosa dn the Tandorri dinner.  I am first glad I didn't go with the 3 foot long dosa.  Would have been way too much.  I loved the dosa, very spicy the one I got, but also fresh.  Tandoori was very nice, plenty of different meats.  I do feel that the chicken was dry as well as the sausage (over cooked).  This probably happen since the kitchen was backed up.  My roommate loved the naan.  So great, that he ordered another basket.  We got our free mango for checking via yelp.  Very tasty drink.  From the name, I first thought it was a jelly.

There were no deserts besides fruit(wheres the Kihr?). We tried almost every entree on the menu and the only one that was decent was the chicken tikka masala, the rest was either bland or sour. The goat curry had bones in it... disgusting.  Also, AVOID THE LASSI AT ALL COSTS. It was sour and I could barely get through a few sips. This either means the yogurt used had gone sour or they do not know how to make a lassi, either way it sucked. As you probably have already guessed, I will not be returning, even if they paid me.

2416686,2014-01-02,1,yy7pPm_QGVRm6exD__Htug,"India Masala is an Indian restaurant near UNLV's campus on Flamingo.  The parking lot does get filled because a combination of India Masala, the various business around, and the small parking lot. I'm impressed with the interior, it is very nice and a huge improvement from what was there, only a few years ago.  That being said it is very nice inside but how does the rest stack up?

Well I came here with my usual large group of co-workers and they were more than accomendating.  We all did the lunch buffet which was only $9.99, the same price as Mt. Everest.  In comparison buffet wise, I do perfer Mt. Everest a lot more because they had more selection, flavor, and better quality in the non-salad and non-dessert items but India Masala is an ok substitute. So they don't have a large selection on their buffet. Their rice dish wasn't mixed well, large patches of non-mixed rice was found throughout. The curry dishes were very running, if they weren't meant to be running. But their desserts, the free mango lassi after check-in and yogurt/tapioca/pudding looking things with fruits were all very delicious. Their meat dishes and regular/garlic naans were about the same. Customer service was excellent, when a few of us decided to use our free lassi check-in offers and they gave more than enough it became awesome.

There are better Indian restaurants in the area. The food in the buffet were alright but not good enough for me to be a fan of. Maybe I'll come back for dinner or not do the buffet. They do have a happy hour from 3pm-6pm for with a drink list and 50% off selected appetizers.",vWP8-aQX0rYJszqkWVL7Ew,5,2,3,CnCYFr8Lvni3jYus-85Jrg

2851851,2012-11-27,6,yy7pPm_QGVRm6exD__Htug,"*Review for the lunch buffet only*

My Indian buffet resume for Las Vegas thus far includes Saffron Flavors of India (Summerlin), Taj Palace (Henderson), and the neighborhood rival a few blocks down (Mint).  In general, what I look for in Indian buffets is value, variety, and flavor.  Thus far, I think Taj Palace wins in flavor, Mint has variety but seems to always underwhelm me in the flavor category, and Saffron is severely lacking in variety (no Tandoori chicken...I literally observed an angry customer lecture the waiter on the lack of tandoori chicken and then proceeded to order some on top of his buffet).  Not quite ready to proclaim India Masala as best one in town since I still need to cross off Mt. Everest and Namaste off the list, but for *value (see below) and variety, they deserve some props.  

In general, I have been surprised by the high prices for Indian buffets in Vegas compared to some other places I've lived (almost always in the double digit dollar range) and I'm at a point in my life where I no longer have the capability to polish off 3-4 plates + dessert to get my money's worth so just like an aging Greg Maddux who has to add some off-speed pitches to compensate for his slower fastball or Michael Jordan adding a fadeaway to his shot selection during the second half of his career, I too had to change up my game, and this buffet is ideally suited for my plan of attack.  

Back in college, when my roommate and I were short on cash, we would routinely compete to see who could pack the most food in the local Indian restaurant ""take out buffet"" styrofoam tray.  Over several trips, we came up with the ideal arrangement which consisted of wet items on the bottom, layer of rice to soak up some flavors but with dry side above, as much tandoori chicken as we could fit, then cushioning everything with naan and other odds and ends.  This ended up easily being the equivalent of 3-4 meals while preserving the integrity of of each item.   So when I showed up one day from my office with a short lunch break, I went with the buffet-to-go option and was ecstatic when they presented me  not only with the usual styrofoam tray, but packed my naan separately in tinfoil and gave me two additional styrofoam bowls....huzzah!  My college roommate would be nodding in approval as I packed my tray full bursting at the seams but now had two additional bowls which I could pack with soup, dessert, salad, or additional rice/or any liquid item suitable for dipping my crispy warm naan.  All in all I foraged enough food to feed a small Indian village.

In terms of variety, this is a double edged sword since like other reviewers have mentioned, this can be hit or miss both in terms of quality (some dishes soared whereas others fell flat) and the expectation of seeing your favorite dishes being present on any given day is highly variable since they do a good job (perhaps too good) of rotating dishes in and out.  I've been here 3 times, and I've seen at least 2-3 distinct dishes not present from before including sauteed okra, fish curry, egg curry, goat curry, and the occasional indo-chinese food item (definitely get this when it is available).  The setup of the restaurant inside is very clean, spacious, and welcoming and for someone that appreciates variety, I like the fact that they take chances and have something for everyone, but not everything is for everyone.  It's an educational foodie experience to see the a wide spectrum of rice dishes, unique desserts, and breads that you won't know if you will like unless it's put forth in front of you.  One glaring omission from the buffet is the samosas since I have yet to see an appearance and while taste of specific items may not be superior to other buffets across town, it definitely edges out Mint head-to-head for the lunch buffet on the east side since they are not afraid to throw in some spice and I'd much rather the items err on being bold than being bland.  3.5 stars with an extra half star bump due to the hidden value in getting their buffet to go.",syA7uYoDjohc7gWBWaEZmw,8,5,4,SJLInoS1625-P09uIHcamA

The chicken tikka masala was delicious when paired with their perfectly cooked garlic naan. Slightly crispy as well as soft and chewy. Tried the goat curry which was nice and earthy. My date thought some parts of the meat were too tendony but I surmised that it's because when cooking such an unusual meat, they probably used most parts of the animal. 

My only true complaint was that our waiter pretty much forgot to take our order and no one else came by our table in a long time. There were only 3 other tables being served at the time! We didn't get to eat til about 40 minutes from the time we sat down. I'm willing to forgive this hopefully one-time incident because of the surprisingly good food.

3081921,2013-05-30,0,yy7pPm_QGVRm6exD__Htug,"The wife and I went for dinner as a spur of the moment thing. Upon walking in, we were impressed with the ambiance. It was open and airy. We were warmly greeted and seated. At the table we were our server presented us with a basket of delightfully light and crisp chips accompanied by plum and mint chutney dips. Our server was Dmitri. He was great. He was speedy without being pushy. He knew the menu and was willing to accommodate special requests.

We ordered the tilapia appetizer. The portion could have been an entree for two. The fish was appropriately flaky without being dry. It was spicy without assaulting the taste buds. I had to hold back so that I would have room for the main course. These did not disappoint. I had the lamb curry at spice level 8, and my wife had the chicken masala at spice level 3. The chicken had to be special ordered. The chicken normally used has the red-pink coloring to it. This tends to upset my wife's stomach. Dmitri was able to convey this to the chef and the chef nailed it. Most importantly, we did not have to wait any longer for this modified meal. And by the way. The chicken was amazing. Juicy, flavorful, and sliced just right. The lamb was the same. I sampled both over a nicely prepared bed of basmati rice.  I only regret not saving room for dessert. Next time.

Another impressive thing was the menu selection. Oftentimes Indian restaurants only serve regional dishes. This menu offers a full culinary tour of India. I am not one for buffets, but I might try theirs just to take the full tour.

The pricing was reasonable. Had we not ordered the tilapia and mango lassi (which was extraordinary), our meal with tip would have been about $42.00. That is a great dinner price just about anywhere, but is an exceptional value in Vegas.

This place hit the grand slam for me: ambiance, service, food, and price.",xmWoWtyazQnq43O9F_jOrQ,1,0,5,cOf4SavUzUGWVBrOrvpNEg
3088856,2017-09-27,0,yy7pPm_QGVRm6exD__Htug,"Mint is our usual Indian go-to restaurant but we ordered takeout at India Masala to try it out. We got the Paneer Butter Masala, Egg Biryani, an order of garlic naan and an order of vegetable samosas. The vegetable samosas come with two, but they are pretty huge and stuffed with potatoes and spices. I've never ordered paneer butter masala before but I love paneer so I had to try it. The sauce was similar to tikka masala, but lighter and the paneer didn't have as much depth since they weren't marinated. Overall though it was pretty good and a nice break from the tikka. I usually order goat biryani but tried out the egg to keep the whole order vegetarian. The description says ""fluffy eggs"" so I imagined scrambled eggs, fried rice style. However, there were probably 8 or so halved boiled eggs. It was interesting, but you have to break the eggs down to be able to eat them. It also seemed to make the whole dish salty. One thing I found strange was they never asked me what spicy level I wanted when I placed the order. This was some of the mildest Indian food I've ever had and I'm sure I would have enjoyed it more if it had been spicier. Nevertheless we enjoyed the food and would probably go back to switch it up every once in awhile.",rYPjqZO89ABei1fsZBSUbA,3,1,4,dBXfmKdjZjCNodVwi_1VVQ

3496572,2013-02-18,0,yy7pPm_QGVRm6exD__Htug,"this review is for the lunch buffet.

this is a nice-looking restaurant, big buffet- there were lots of choices, and definitely more vegetarian-friendly options than nearby mint. i think they are a little better than mint in terms of sheer flavor and spice-level- while still not where i'd like it to be, it's a little more flavorful than typical indian buffet food.

the malai kofta was good and so was the aloo gobi- the latter had a nice fresh gingery flavor.

naan was served PIPING hot but our second basket didn't make it to our table until we were almost done eating. the service was a bit tricky in general- several different people waited on us, and there was no coordination between them, and they could be a little slow. at one point we waited like 15 minutes for someone to get us drink refills, and then right after we asked one guy to get them, another was asking if we wanted refills. it was confusing and inefficient.

it's somewhere between 3 and 4 stars as far as vegas indian buffets but i am erring on the side of less stars because of one glaring buffet omission: paneer. where was the paneer? :(",rUW7_B9pBNdDR3Y2bBz9TQ,2,0,3,zowVIEUchJkPS-x76U94Qg

We were seated quickly enough and it wasn't very busy, maybe 3 or 4 tables.  The server asked what kind of naan and water we wanted.  She asked if we wanted ice water or water without ice.  We said ice water, she brought water without ice.  No big deal, but not really getting started out on the right foot.

I can't really talk about this place without comparing it to Mint, which is about 1/4 mile down the road.  The buffet is larger compared to Mint's, but the quality is much worse.  Several of the labels over food items were gone, and there was no chicken tikka masala.  Their website lists that they have both chicken tikka masala and butter chicken on the buffet, but apparently this is a lie.  I asked the server and she said they only have butter chicken.  Yes, I know the two are very similar, but here the butter chicken did not taste anything like a usual chicken tikka masala, for what it's worth.  In retrospect, going back and looking at their website, there are LOTS of things on the website that were not actually on the buffet.  In fact, I distinctly recall them having 6 chicken dishes on the buffet, one of which was not labeled, and one of which I cannot find on the website (chicken biryani).  The website has 8 dishes listed, so there are 3-4 dishes on the website that were not on the buffet, and that's just with chicken alone.  There were some oddities on the buffet, such as ranch & thousand island dressing, chow mein, and plenty of unripe fruit.  

As to the actual quality of the food, it wasn't good at all.  All of the chicken was dark meat, a good bit of it was pretty fatty/gristly, and the chili chicken breading was super soggy as if it had been sitting out for way too long.  The butter chicken tray was 95% sauce and 5% meat -- it was very difficult to find any meat in there.  The only decent thing was the naan.

For roughly the same price as the buffet at Mint which is literally 0.25 miles away and light years better, this is a pass.",ykWNHp1RXcmx6PYH921UrQ,0,0,1,kLCg5FUajltGrXtD9NBLig

The superb food way out weights the cost. I try different dishes each time I go and have yet to be disappointed. If you are not sure what to order or if you will like it, they have a lunch buffet that has a pretty good choice for you to sample and again very reasonable. Meat dishes are my favorite but they have a good portion of vegetarian dishes on the buffet too. Dal Makhani is my favorite vegetarian dish , but all are good. They always have 4-5 different chutney's to choose from with salad and fresh fruit. The nan bread is always fresh and the service is friendly. This is a rather new restaurant and as the word gets out it will get hard to get a table on Friday or Saturday night dinner without a wait.

3974659,2013-06-30,4,yy7pPm_QGVRm6exD__Htug,"We stopped for dinner last night as it had been awhile since we had Indian food.  Since we got there right at 5 PM which is their opening time, the place was empty and we were seated immediately.  Water was brought quickly and we also ordered regular iced tea.  The server came back and said they were out of regular iced tea and they only had the sweetened raspberry tea.  We got that instead.

For an appetizer, we ordered the medhu wada, two deep fried doughnuts made from ground lentils, rice, and black pepper.  With it was served three chutneys or sauces that added some to the dryness of the wada.  The sauces were a tomato based one, a soup, and a coconut based one.  The wadas were very flavorful and after chewing, you got the flavor of the black pepper.  When our server went to clear the dishes, she asked if we wanted to keep any of the chutneys.  I kept the soup and ate it.  It was great!

For dinner, my wife ordered the garlic chicken and I ordered Madras curry chicken, spice level 7 on a 1 to 10 basis.  We also ordered some garlic naan.  Dinner came with basmati rice.  We both liked our meals, and we had garlic chicken to bring home for another meal for one of us.  The garlic naan was good. For dessert, we shared a dish of kheer.

A couple of things keep me from ranking the place higher.  On one of the hottest days this summer, the restaurant was very warm.  I don't like freezing in a place either and I always take a denim long sleeve shirt with me.  I sure didn't need it as I was perspiring and it wasn't from the curry.  Speaking of that, 7 is not high enough for a good spice level.  Their 7 was rather tame and the curry seemed to be lacking some of the rich flavor it should have.  Perhaps I'm spoiled by Thai curry.  I think I need to stay away from indian curry.  The kheer had no pistachio chunks on it which somewhat makes the dish interesting.  I saw the photo that Westie W. posted and I thought that it was really enticing.  The no regular iced tea threw me.  I was going to ask them if I could have some hot water and a tea bag and a glass of ice.  I could have made my own.  Out of iced tea is so lame.  

We bought a Yelp deal which is in essence a $5 off deal.  This place is OK, but I won't be returning.  There are good good, fully supplied Indian restaurants in town.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,5,3,3,G3HlzaouJeVm2Ca3rXmo4g

I had heard about their location in Riviera but there's no way I'm braving the strip, its tourists and its prices just for Indian food. So when my wife and I saw India Masala had finally opened a second location while we were on our way to our preferred Indian buffet (Mint), we decided we had to try it.

In short, we should've just stuck with Mint. There's nothing objectively bad about India Masala. You could even make the argument that the food is a bit more flavorful than the seemingly afraid-of-spice Mint. But whether it's the decor, the service or the selection, something about this place just didn't click with me. Another disappointing contestant in a city that is, sadly, completely bereft of Indian restaurants.

The environment is comfortable, clean and nicely decorated. Service to the table is excellent. Vegetable samosas are excellent as is the saag paneer. The yellow dal is tasty, spiced well and plentiful.   There is a full salad bar and plenty of choices.  After looking for quite a while for a tasty Indian restaurant we are delighted to have found this place.  We'll be back often and we commend it to you without reservation.

4199998,2015-05-18,0,yy7pPm_QGVRm6exD__Htug,"Three unique must haves tl:dr'd at the end of the review. 

This place has gotten a new chef since I was last here and he has introduced two phenomenal dishes (the tandoori lamb sizzler, veg briayni, and gobi manchurian) as well as great changes to the quality of the usual dishes. Great vegetarian options. Thanks to the new chef, this is the best Indian in town 

Many Indian restaurants cut corners on the quality of ingredients and try to cover it with heavy but stuck in the back of the cupboard spices. Here, the chef took the time to marinate the lamb and chicken so the flavor went all the way through. Some places give you flavorless meat with food coloring, here the color comes from fresh spices. 

I went in mixed company of meat eaters and vegetarians, everyone loved the food. I even found myself going back into the veg bryiani, some much flavor folded into the rice. Flecks of sweet Fried onion, peas, shavings of carrot, bits of potato, fragrant of saffron. This is a veg dish I'll crave. 

Try the gobi manchurian and you'll get cauliflower that's dressed like the best orange chicken you've ever had. 

Must trys:
The tandoori sizzler (i love the lamb), the veg bryiani, the gobi manchurian.",ljBH91Qi0Xe53CzJWcsO_g,2,0,5,tDnHBUiuR4hjlER_GLtHVg

4304903,2016-01-07,0,yy7pPm_QGVRm6exD__Htug,"Let me begin by saying that my family visited the restaurant 3 times in a 2 week period.  I made SURE that after I had a (small and fixable) problem the first time, that I mentioned to the ""host"" (I don't know his title, but he seated us) I made sure to mention that as an African American family we have no serious idea about what to expect, but we consider ourselves Foodies (LOL) and their restaurant is very conveniently located only steps away from our home.  I mentioned also that we planned to visit them often.  

Okay so getting to the experience...

It was a very busy lunch service and we were skipped over twice for table seating... Strike one...

When it was time to pay and leave we were overcharged, the price was more than I had seen advertised, AND they charged us for more meals than were people in our party.  Asking them (the same hist person ) to correct this seemed to insult him, and asking him to clarify why the price was different seemed to be more irritating than he could stand.  He seemed to be REALLY UPSET that I didn't already know that they ""recently changed the price.""  Did I mention that this was my first visit to them... ok... Strike two...

Take back strike two, another man came to the cash register and heard a portion if the scene the other host person was making by challenging me to show him where I had seen the different price advertised, and he, the second guy just made him change the price for my family to end the commotion.

I left mortified because I felt like a fool being spoken to in that way, when I was a paying customer.

My daughter and I visited again a few days later, hoping to demonstrate that we LOVED the food, and if the guy could just calm down this time maybe we'd have a chance to establish a long business relationship.  I met the same host guy, reminded him that I said that we'd be nack, and he sat us down, but none of the 3 workers visiting tables even brought us water until I got up to ask for some from the bar.  The person who was clearing dishes from the table came and asked us if we'd like some naan, he set it down and walked away before I answered... it was cold...

The food on the buffet was mostly empty, we had to wait for fresh or replacement everything...  As someone was passing our table we asked if we could order a mango lassi, the man told us that a woman was our server, I asked him if SHE knew that because no one had come to our table.  She came to the table layer with a pitcher of the drink and poured it into the plastic water cups they use, which my daughter and I didn't really care about after the wait, but we were wondering if we could get some ice with that... nope... I got ice at the bar... and if THAT wasn't enough when we left and it was time to pay the host/server/guy sarcastically asked me how much was I willing to pay today (referring to my confusion about their price on my first visit.)  Strike two... I let him know that from my apartment I could see their business advertised on the side of a catering truck parked behind the restaurant and THAT is what I expected when I visited.  He told me that the truck, with their name on it doesn't belong to them... huh????  Why would I understand that???  

Ok, so glutton for punishment that I must be I went in AGAIN  alone this time and unwilling to be humiliated in from of my husband, or my daughter... wait...

I know, I know you want to know why in the H, I would even bother going back right... well I really REALLY love tandoori chicken, and like I said before steps away from home... ok...

I went in a 3rd time, and it was busy again, and I let them know that it was just me...I got an eyeroll from you know who, but I waited about 15 minutes and decided to step outside for air... the longer I stood outside the more I realized just how local I am to a LARGE number of Indian Restaurants... Mint down the street virtually on the next block, and another, India Palace, behind me on Twain... Bombay Kitchen, Urban Turban... I feel like I gave it a shot.  I really wanted to be their customer.  They didn't want my business.  STRIKE three... I'm outta there!

I gave one star for the Tandoori chicken
I gave one star because they are regularly busy, that suggests that people who know Indian Food better than I do approve...

But I removed 1 Star for each of my 3 strikes...
I can take a hint, they don't want me back... ok, now I know.",Cap3bkEK4rFnMl44i61BIg,3,0,2,s4jqINnQ0r4eJLlx_X7Avw

There was a family of five sitting near us and they asked where their food was twice, it must have taken 40 mins for their appetizers to come out and they were just getting their food  about 45 mins later.  We had a similar experience, in which it took 30 mins for our appetizer to come out and soon thereafter, our food arrived.

Our server was Rohan. Very friendly and personable. He made sure we were taken care of. He has great suggestions. His dad is the chef and he makes amazing food.

Our experience was more like 3.5 stars, but I'll give the nice attentive staff an extra half star for effort.

First off, I'm thinking, what's ""Jainism""? This was the first time I've ever encountered an Indian restaurant that had dishes for those who observe Jain as a religion, and as a cuisine. Or at least identified as Jain on a menu. Quickly and secretly reading Wiki, I find that their cuisine consists of a refusal to eat ""bulbs"", meaning no garlic, onions, potatoes or such. Fascinating read, Jainism.

But back to the meal. We had a LOT of food, cuz we had a GROUPON, but also cuz we love so much about Indian cuisine, and simply don't go enough.

- Cuminium: A cocktail containing gin, absinthe, cumin and other things! It was actually quite interesting, and enjoyable.
- Vegetable samosas: Not the best we've had, but quite good.
- AndhraSpicy Masala Dosa: Under the ""southern Indian"" column in the menu, this was quite good. Kinda like having the samosa again, except in a crepe, dusted with a spicy powder that, like szechuan pepper, built up spice in the mouth. Great dipping sauces, including one akin to a minestrone soup? Highly recommended, and in fact, I think the ""southern""  column, or vegetarian selections, is the way to go here. (Keep reading.)
- Flying Horse lager: Split a tall Indian beer, this one we had never before encountered, it was light but worked with the main courses.
- Shrimp Chettinadu: Billed as a 21-spice concoction (again, something we'd never before encountered), unfortunately the shrimp were overcooked. But the sauce, very dry for a sauce, was interesting enough.
- Lamb Pepper Fry: Again the protein, this time lamb, was overcooked. Tough. But the onions, grilled and raw (NOT A JAIN ITEM!) and other things made it overall tasty.

So overall we thought India Masala was about mid-way in this town for its quality of Indian cuisine. We've had worse, we've had better. I want to eventually return for the lunch buffet . (I have found that some places which aren't quite successful at dinner do quite well with their buffet.) But as for dinner, I might go back if friends insist, and only go vegetarian. Or maybe be Jain, for an evening.

ADDENDUM

Oops. Forgot to mention. I had brought a bottle of Gewurztraminer to have with dinner. Corkage was quoted as TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS! And they're not even on the Strip! So don't bother bringing your own, just order a cocktail and split a beer, as we did.",_ReALUaGu7Qayk4ULX9wnQ,1,3,4,TY8ybfqqnYroo6IUCsaMvg

We arrived and noticed that there weren't that many tables for dinner at 6:30 which was probably our first hint that this was not going to go well. We decided to take a booth. second mistake due to the visibility of the dining area. We were hidden behind a wall as other tables started to fill we placed our order of Chicken Tiki Masala and Paneer Masala the Big Mac basic of Indian cuisine. After waiting 30 mins our server came back to tell us that our food would be ready soon. After 15 mins we see our server coming out of the kitchen with food. After 5 more mins more food not ours when we stood up to look around the restaurant we saw that all of the people that arrived after us had food and some were even packing up their left overs.

However, I was never fond of their lunch desserts. They're either kind of weird or boring or both. 

Also, I'm not sure if this was an isolated incident, but the last time I went (1/15/14) the saag (spinach & mustard greens curry) was WAY, WAY too salty. I actually love salty food and most green things, but that had to be a mistake. Hopefully it was just a fluke.

5033876,2014-03-25,2,yy7pPm_QGVRm6exD__Htug,"New Disclaimer: I get extremely cranky when my blood sugar drops. 

So, I did go back, to the lunch buffet. Based on the buffet alone, I think I would like to go for dinner at some point. I thought the food was exceptionally good, not just ""for a buffet"", but in general.

I did the lunch buffet for takeout. They are generous with the containers (and separately packaged naan), so I was able to try pretty much some of everything (and lots of some things!). 

The selection is small, but the bases were fairly covered. I knew going in that I wouldn't find samosas, but I still missed them. There also wasn't any pakora, and a few other standard items I was surprised not to see. Still, what they do have is solid. The tandoori chicken was basic, but well-prepared and moist. The chicken tikka masala was exceptionally good, as was the fish curry they had. 

To the best of my knowledge (and please, feel free to message me if I'm wrong), India Masala is the only spot offering a takeout option for their buffet. As you might know from my earlier review, my time is extremely limited on weekday afternoons. It's good to know that I could pop in, fill a few containers, pay, and be on my way in a few minutes with enough delicious food for both lunch and dinner.",Uz_0Tcvq5KcF4XQltYKjnw,0,0,4,jgIOs3o-i2vkgHBO2HHJag

  It is as all buffets should be, clean and neat and well stocked. We came here after a disappointing stop at Ghandi the week earlier. The service here is wonderful, very nice and friendly also mindful and considerate. Full water glasses at all times, we were offered fresh naan bread and it was great. The mango lassi was affordable and generous.
 I do not know what is expected of Indian dishes officially, I only know if like what I had or not so please keep that in mind. 
 The first time we went we loved it. There were large chunks of chicken in the butter chicken and an amazing lamb curry. Kessla ? dessert which was over the top, we loved this. Lemon rice and unique vegetarian dishes I gave a try. Well cooked basmati rice. Tandoori chicken, soups, pakora.. 
 The second time came around and it was also great!! The Chicken Curry was amazing! 
 Told friends, then came a third time and..hmm..  things changed.. Butter chicken had tiny thin strands of chicken not at all the same kind from before, there was no lamb curry which was disappointing to me, and some dishes that looked good but had bones in them including the chicken curry (the first time it was made without bones). (I personally won't eat any gravies or curries with bones). There was a mango dessert that was unique. 
 I never tried the salads and smaller items, by the time I make it to the back wall I am full I did not count how many items but there is surely enough to choose from.
  So we would prefer more consistency in quality as customers, however that's the only issue we had here. No one got sick, nothing bad happened it was a pleasant experience.

An accountant by trade and restaurant owner by choice, a self-proclaimed love of food from his homeland seeing Mr. Mehta enter the ever-competitive industry later than many with a collection of old family recipes and regional influences, guests entering India Oven Masala will likely first be struck by both how well-lit and eye-catching the décor is, everything from the lobby featuring a gold statue of Ganesha to the bathrooms spotless, as too is the kitchen and bar.

Featuring a seven-page dinner menu in addition to a lunch buffet like almost every other Indian Restaurant in town, though several differences in each look to set India Oven Masala apart from the pack, the first of these is immediately evident on viewing the right side of the buffet-line where a live-kitchen producing both Naan and Dosa is located, one of only two of its kind in Las Vegas operating both afternoon and evening to produce fresh bread filled or topped with a bounty of unique ingredients.

Charging prices comparable to other such spots in town, the Buffet just $11.99 seven days a week including bottomless Mango Lassi, it was while tablemates enjoyed White Wine and Indian Beer that a glass of the thick Yogurt drink was enjoyed alongside appetizers including crispy Pappadum and piping hot Chicken Samosa, the latter far better than anything fried at Mt. Everest, Delhi or Urban Turban thanks to the lightness of the Batter, not to mention the finely diced Chicken teaming with aromatic spices.

Further impressed by Chili Paneer, the squeaky cubes of Cheese in a fiery red Sauce featuring Bell Peppers and Onions immediately bringing beads of sweat to the brow of one at the table, it was with the first of two sizable servings of Jasmine Rice that three entrees were presented, the ubiquitous Chicken Tikka Masala offering far more Meat than many while the cubed Lamb Vindaloo was served medium-spicy and delicious, though one diner felt the Protein was sort of dry while no one complained about Mixed Vegetable Curry that featured at least five different Ingredients all cooked to appropriate consistencies, a difficult task considering the fact that Eggplant is almost always rendered mushy in such cases.

Invited to take a short break from dining to visit the side-kitchen, a virtually spotless station where the ingredients and tradition of Dosa were explained by one of Ulzan's employees, it was upon return to the table that two types of Naan including a unique version stuffed with Fruit and Nuts were presented along with a forearm sized Dosa, the crispy Pancake stuffed with fragrant Mashed Potatoes delicious on its own and even better with housemade Coconut or Tomato Chutney that is traditionally served as part of Breakfast in Southern India.

 Rounding out the meal with two Desserts, a bit of disappointment here as neither the Gajar Halwa nor Gulab Jamun listed on the menu were available, it was instead a small bowl of creamy Kheer and the previously unknown dish called Cassata that were served, the latter taking its name from an Italian Cake traditionally featuring Strawberries despite actually being quite similar to Spumoni topped with Dark Chocolate Chips and crumbled Pecans. 

FOUR AND A HALF STARS:  Very good right up to the end, running out of a standard menu item without a doubt one of the cardinal sins of Restaurant ownership, it seems safe to say that India Oven Masala one-ups the competition by way of both its décor and cuisine, the latter offering far more to be explored at future visits and Mr. Mehta clearly committed to offering something a little different than the typical Las Vegas Indian dining experience.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,9,6,5,8k9XK6hq56NCjDaTz46FQw

We ordered chicken tikka dosa, goat curry, basmati rice, and naan. It was our first time having a dosa, not sure that we have seen this on a menu before, but we are glad that we tried it! If you have never had one and you like crepes, this is a must have! Of course, the sauces that went with it were just delightful, bursting with flavor in every bite. The curry was also very flavorful and so was the wonderful naan. We order the rice so the goat curry had something to sit on.

Price wise, it is similar to all the others. Where it falls flat is in the offerings. IM offers a variety of dishes that are not often seen at other places. The vegetable korma is a primary example of this point. It was the one I enjoyed the most. The well seasoned mix of mushrooms and potatoes with the mango chutney gave a balanced taste of sweet and savory. The rice in the chicken biryani was also decious. It was soft, pillowy, and flavorful. I scooped around the dried chicken pieces and went with the tandoori instead. Most of the time, it is best to pass on the tandoori because it just sits out and loses all the moisture. Not theirs. Instead, I found it to be tender and moist. Other than those three dishes, I was not impressed.

The service, on the other hand, was polite and friendly. The decorum, spacious and warm. With so much potential, I hope to see them tweak the menu a bit more. I wouls like to come in for dinner and just order ala carte.",N3oNEwh0qgPqPP3Em6wJXw,6,0,3,Eva0_YYKBzZ706zSU8VoSw

More importantly, one of the members of our party had their wallet stolen out of their bag and when we confronted the restaurant, they went and got the video feed and told us that we should only blame ourselves and did not handle the situation in a mature manner. When the police arrived, the waiter who claimed that he was the owner told them that we were being very aggressive and threatened to beat him up, which we did not do. They were very unwilling to help, and all we asked for is for them to look at the video feed for us.

Also, in terms of food, their appetizers were okay, but their main courses were subpar. The vegetarian items were okay, but their meat items were terrible. I feel robbed that I had to pay for that food. They boast that they have the largest buffet for lunch, and that's true if you include the 8 chutneys and fruits and stuff that don't count as lunch items. Never again.

5476706,2012-08-26,0,yy7pPm_QGVRm6exD__Htug,"I have the honor of writing the first review for this new restaurant !

It has been open for just over a week now, the decor is your typical ""new"" Indian restaurant strip mall style, dark woods and a nice clean appearance. The table set up is certainly set up with the lunch buffet crowd in mind, not a bad thing as there is plenty of space around each table.

Service was fast and friendly with even the chef stopping by our table to check on us.

As of now, they do not have a liquor license, but they did say they expect to get it in the next couple of weeks.

The important stuff, the food.

If you have read any of my Indian restaurant reviews, we tend to stick with what we know and like, though today we did go with a Chicken Korma and Butter Chicken rather than Chicken Tikka Masala and just for a change, an order of the Aloo Palak.

Well, honestly, it was good, very good in fact, the sauces were some of the best I have had, certainly better than Origin and slightly better than Mt Everest. The only negative would be the amount of chicken used, let's say it was light in this area, add some more meat to the dish and it would have been a home run. The Aloo Palak was good, I am not a big fan of this dish, but the wife loves it and she raved about this version.

The naan (plain and garlic) were superb, a little thinner than I normally like, but boy a simple dish done perfectly.

So all in all, a good place to eat, certainly the best Indian on this side of town.",5XKjVehgGzb5dJocdI-36Q,1,1,4,6eGbzrzMJ_zLgTwOGTDDmw

5643281,2017-08-20,0,yy7pPm_QGVRm6exD__Htug,"It pains me to write this review as Indian Oven was my favorite Indian restaurant. My family has been going there since it was located near the Golden Steer. They did a great job with the new building, it looks really nice.

So we usually order the same thing each time. Lamb Tikka Masala (I get spicy and my wife gets mild) as well as rice and Naan. As well as the assorted hors d'oeuvre as well as sodas.

Well we couldn't order soda because they were all flat so that meant can soda or something else. So no big deal I drink a lot and the waitress was super at keeping my glass full.

Being 6pm it was strange we were the only people in there. That being said it still took almost 40+ minutes for our food to come out.

The waitress brought our food out and announced.. They are both medium. Unapologetic! I expressed this isn't what we ordered, I ordered spicy and my wife had ordered mild. She says that is what she put in but the cook prepared them medium. (This set the mood for the rest of the meal)  - She noticed I was pissed and kept going back to the cook and talking and coming back. Asking if we wanted new items, if the food was ok.. But we didn't have 40 more minutes to wait. Anyways the Lamb Tikka Masala was actually greenish in color compared to the red it had normally been. It used to be so flavorful.. Now it tasted bland and like the meat had been tossed into stock sauce and served (which doesn't explain the 40 mins) but the dish was blah... So disappointing.

The rice too was not very flavorful. But besides the food not being up to it's normal flavor and even the chef deciding he know better then we did... The main reason I will not go back is the restaurant was full of flies. 

I am sure some people are fine with it. As one of the employees was eating unfazed by the flies. My wife and I however couldn't even enjoy our bland tasteless food as we were too busy swatting flies off our food and bodies. 

In the end the waitress checked us out, she apologized for the meal being messed up. The receipt clearly showed spicy and mild for the dishes. She even said she noticed us swatting flies and apologized for that. She said the staff keeps the back door open.

But all the apologies made not one discount was offered. The manager never made an effort to placate us. Obviously we were unhappy, the manager could have made a difference.. but sadly after over 12+ years of going to this restaurant and referring dozens of people to their locations. I will never go back.

Side note - Wife said the women's bathroom was dirty and full of flies as well. Place was also very warm, as if they didn't have the air conditioning on.",piwcc36E-2uXhvLUj_FfPQ,2,0,1,PUjggB6emwEgcF28_vaTQQ

Our party consisted of three vegetarians, so I can't speak to the quality of the meat items, but everything we ate was fantastic. Some of the best dal makhani I have ever had, malai kofta was tasty, rice and garlic naan were both delicious. I tend to like a little more spice with my Indian food, but found no complaint here due to the absolutely amazing flavors. Portion sizes were perfect and we received more than enough rice for all three dishes, which is always good. I order chana masala virtually every time I eat Indian, and this restaurant's similar chickpea curry dish was the best I've ever had. The sauce was so flavorful and mouthwatering- could eat it every day. Though we were incredibly full after the meal, there was no lingering sleepy food coma that sometimes happens after having Indian. Feel like the ingredients were very fresh. Nice! 

Decor and atmosphere were pleasant and our server was very friendly. Service was a little slow at times, but I was willing to forgive this due to the extremely high-quality food.

This was among the best we've been to.  First the food, which is probably THE most important aspect of any dining experience for me.  You can have bad service and great food and reluctantly find yourself going back from time to time; but a place with bad food and great service is less likely to be revisited.  The food was absolutely delicious!  You have to try the chicken 64 (or something like that - it has a number in the name).  It's an appetizer dish with chicken that appears to have been marinated and then cooked in a batter or something.  IDK - I'm not a foodie and I don't know all the intricacies of HOW a dish is prepared.. all I know is that it was DAMN good!  I had meant to get a dish to go on my way back home the next day but forgot.  The other dishes were almost as good - WAY better than standard, but not quite as exceptional as the appetizer.  For spiciness, we got 8 which was just PERFECT for us.  We like it pretty spicy though, so for people less tolerant, you might want to dial it down a bit.

Service - which I think is the second most important in any dining experience, was PHENOMENAL - I would say it was pretty close to an all-time best for me.  We had sat down and since my gf is the foodie I let her pick the dish while I proceeded to check something on my phone.  As soon as I whip out my phone, the manager comes and asks if I need access to the wifi, which I gratefully accept.  The rest of the evening is just as attentive, friendly, and considerate.  I don't have time to go into all the details, but ALL of the staff were extremely pleasant, and attentive.  They are also very international which I really liked a lot.  There were Indian staff of course, but also Caucasian, Eastern Asian, and other ethnicity as well.  India, which has historically been a major fulcrum of the Silk Road is well represented by the people working here.  It was an absolutely delightful dining experience, adding another dimension to the tasteful decor and immaculate ambiance.  It almost makes me not want to leave a good review in fear that it will be over-crowded the next time we visit.  ;)  but the people working there REALLY deserve every bit of the praise.  I wish I had more time and the descriptive capacity to do them justice, but you'll simply have to experience it for yourself.  :)

Quick and dirty notes:
Food: quality tasting with a big BUT (see full review below for details) BEWARE OF THE CHICKEN BONES!
Service: very slow and biased 


We come in for dinner TONIGHT ( that's how upset I am about this place)

We walked in and observed the ""please wait to be seated"" sign and obliged. It took 5 minutes before the staff noticed us and seated us. The place was pretty empty, I counted 4 tables in the back that were used. We were seated on the opposite end of the restaurant. 
The busser quickly sat us and brought us out some flat bread and chutney. The bartender quickly asked us if we wanted to order cocktails. That was the last interaction we would have for the next 20 minutes. I noticed the manager/owner at the front desk and tried to make eye contact with him to show him subtly that we were ready to order. My silent ques went unnoticed. I don't understand it?!? The waiters were nowhere to be found? 
Finally both of the waiters noticed and rushed to take our orders. There seemed to be an obvious disconnect between the staff and the tables that they were responsible for. Nevertheless we finally were able to place our order. 

We ordered
Samosas
Pakora (I wanted Aloo Tiki but they were ""out"")
1/2 order of Tandori Chicken
Butter Chicken 
Garlic Naan


The appetizers came out very quickly!

The Pakora was very large and tasty. I was a good mix of vegetables not just batter fried sliced veggies.

The samosas were very tasty and fresh! The peas in them were not gushy and the potato mix had a nice consistency to it. You could tell that they were made recently. 

The tandori chicken came out hot from the tandori still moist. Probably one of the better tandori chicken dishes that I've had. It was not marinated to long as the chicken protein was not completely broken down from the yogurt. Not sure how they do it but the meat was still moist and yet still had a nice red crust. 

That's about where to food compliments stop.The tandori chicken came out 10 minutes before our curry, rice and naan. We waited hoping that the other dishes would follow shortly but gave up after 5 minutes and begun to eat the chicken. What burns me even more is an Indian family that was seated long after us got their food (the same food) before us. Our food came our 3 minutes after they were served. Discrimination or just crappy service? You be the judge. This instantly infuriated me and ruined my experience from that point on.  

10 minutes later, we finally got the rest of our order. 
The butter chicken sauce was very creamy and tasty. The big complaint was the chicken in the curry. It was loaded with what seemed to be leftover tandori chicken bits (not chunks or cubes). I usually expect that but I should not have to pick out shards of bones out of my curry. UNSAT and UNSAFE!
I was unable to enjoy my curry as I had to be on the lookout for chicken bones.  

The food was very good but the misque on the butter chicken and the horrible service tainted what could have been a great dining experience. I think that their food is decent and I'd dare say that it's some of the better that I've had in Vegas but they need to get a grip on the staff before I'd dare come back to this place.",E_Ts8j758tpiAZknHR7k4g,4,1,2,-3LFBxxiwhxjkjXeLNr_jg

The owners of India Masala, should be proud to be calling themselves Indian, since I have never been to an Indian restaurant, which is impeccably clean and classy. The Buffet is the main attraction and not a corner side-show as in other Indian restaurants. Last time I was there, I ate so much I had to find a tree to wind around  to digest the incredible food that I had at the buffet., not to mention it is not easy to find a tree in the desert. 

They also have a nice cozy bar and I have a red wine (preferably chilled since the the wine sommeliers, who go to school of higher learning with student loans jauntily  come back to tell the bartenders to serve red wine at  ""room temperature."" Room temperature in Las Vegas, happens to be 120 degrees Fahrenheit. The bartenders who are taught not to argue with experts follow the dictum to the tee. The red wine has to be chilled to taste good and even a cheap wine will taste good-chilled and most mere mortals drink cheap wine.

Not to digress, I have red wine before and during dinner which gives you a tremendous appetite, unlike beer, that makes you full and not to mention gives you Buddha like belly. The Buffet is not only sight for sore eyes with over Forty ! North and South Indian items,but it a feast for the palate, to say the least. The buffet is freshly cooked unlike Chinese restaurants where they serve left over from the previous week. The secret to good Indian food is authentic cooks. I found out from the waiters that they have Four North and South Indian cooks. Most of the Indian restaurants have no cooks, but someone on a tourist visa paying off their debts.

The service is superb and the ambiance is embellishment to the feast. There is no way anyone can get this kind of food for the price they are charging and this can happen Only in Las Vegas the Buffet Capitol of the World. India Masala is the Indian Buffet Capitol of Las Vegas., I would say this is the Healthiest Buffet /food in Las Vegas or anywhere.

It is time for my weekly visit to the Capitol.",QsznkLEL_ljuk6UUMd1ukg,0,0,5,AEqejqnYKhiilndYTiwa3g
