17124,2013-06-02,0,ZPwx7ktiVluGFVg0L05n5A,"We just had an early dinner tonight and I would recommend this place to friends and family.  My boyfriend, who is somewhat picky at what restaurant to eat at, was happily  surprised and enjoyed our experience.  

The restaurant is very clean, and inviting.  The staff was very friendly.  It wasn't that busy at 430pm but at about 6 pm'ish people started to come in.  We started off with 3 empanadas (beef, chicken and spinach).  We both agreed that the beef and chicken was very good.  Spinach was good, to me. My boyfriend doesn't like spinach too much, anyway.  We also ordered the Ensalada del Chef.  It's very large - I think it can feed 4 people with nice portions on each plate.  It had everything on it:  deli meats, peperocinos,  slices of hard boiled eggs, julienne slices of carrots, slices of olives, thin slices of red onions....etc etc.   And, was very good.  The dressing they give is is just a light balsamic and olive oil that you mix yourself.  Not sure if they have other flavored dressings but then, we didn't ask.  We were okay to just use what was given to us.  

For entree, I had the Mariscos Buenes Aires and I enjoyed it.  The red wine sauce was savory and sweet.  There was squid in the recipe and gladly it was very tender and not chewy.  My boyfriend ordered the Salmon Grillado.  He enjoyed it.  I tasted a bite of the salmon and also the parmesan potatoe side that came with it.  It was yum.  The salmon was a good long piece of fillet.  Nothing special about the salmon, though. No special seasonings or anything.  I can make it better at home but it is a nice serving of a fish.  Add the chimichurri sauce and it enhanced the flavor!!  :)

For dessert I ordered the Flan, waitress recommended, and, my boyfriend ordered the Panquesques dulce de leche (which we took to go).  I am glad we did because the Flan was a big serving!  I had flan before but this recipe was outstanding!  It was served with a side of whip cream and 3 dollops of carmel.  OMG!   YUM YUM YUM!!  I wanted to take a pic of it but both of our phones were in the car.  I liked that presentation of it.  :)  Can't tell you yet on the Panquesques - we are relaxing from the dinner still.  :)

AND, lastly but not forgotten - the chimichurri sauce was awesome!   You could put this sauce on anything and it would be great.  My boyfriend put some of it on his salmon and it was yummy!   Soooo gooood!!!  For drinks I had the Inka Cola - cool and refreshing.  It is sweet like a vanilla root beer like taste but yellow in color. :)))  My boyfriend ordered a Heineken at first and his second beer he took the suggestion of the waitress and ordered the Quilmes.  He said the Quilmes was very tasty.  

They have a deli section filled with meats, desserts, sauces, sandwiches and also a store towards the back where you can buy the chimichurri sauce, Argentinian wine, candy, flour, dulce de leche sauce, carmel sauce,  etc etc.   It was a nice set-up.

My family is visiting in 3 weeks, I would definately take them here.  But we will be ordering the Argentinian meat barbecue!!!  :))))   I have had this before and it was yum, as well.",ojWHUyIdPywoldOfzJ9yqA,1,0,4,zy449vtNqZdewG4io2Gb6Q

Their chimmichurri sauce is like CRACK, but in a good addictive way that won't end up having you in jail. I think it could be spread on a car bumper and it would be delicious! (and so full of essential minerals to boot!)

Their tableside BBQ is unique and very very tasty. I've gotten the mixed grill the 3 times i've been, and it's ALL good. Yes, even organ meat is good on it. (and i'm not a fan for except sweetbreads)

I would have to agree). All of it is great - and leave room for dessert, the flan with the caramel is the best I ever had.

499895,2011-06-16,0,ZPwx7ktiVluGFVg0L05n5A,"Three of us went to Rincon a week ago, for a late lunch, after reading reviews about it. The place is in the Cathay Hills Chinese all, a few blocks west of the center of China Town, comfortable and service is good. We ordered the parillada for two people (the one that has skirt steak, ribs, sweet bread, chicken and sausage), a beef tongue and also a Greek salad. For drinks we had Quilmes beer. That was plenty of food for three people, but amazingly we finished it all, with more help later from glasses of house red wine.

We especially liked the grilled sweet bread. It is a little crunchy from grilling, tasty with a chargrill aroma, not mushy like in upscale French dishes. The skirt steak was very good too. We ordered it medium rare. It came slightly on the rare side, but because the grill has burning charcoal underneath, everything continues to cook at a slow pace, so the skirt steak became perfect just when we finished it. The ribs are so-so, not very good cut. Chicken is good, and sausage is tasty. But the best was the sweet bread. Oh, I liked the ox tongue as well. It was covered with chimichurri sauce. Oh yes, we ate so much bread before the grill came, because of the chimichurri sauce. It was good.

We recommend this place for people who go to Las Vegas and want something different from the buffets and Chinese food. We will go there again the next time we are in Vegas.",nV2_713u9VBv1UOsr6ImZQ,3,0,4,uGsZEvb_oEHo5oW8Dk-YOQ
531196,2014-12-29,0,ZPwx7ktiVluGFVg0L05n5A,"I wish I could be as enthusiastic as the other Rincon de Buenos Aires reviewers, but I just wasn't crazy about the place.  The service was fine: friendly, helpful, although a bit inconsistent in their attentiveness.  As for atmosphere, not much to say but no complaints either.  It's a deli/takeout place in addition to being a restaurant.  The TV and a lot of table conversation is in Spanish, which certainly adds to the authenticity of the place.

Service and atmosphere were fine; the food is why I didn't love the place.  I tried 2 appetizers, the spinach pie and the Argentine chorizo.  The spinach pie portion was huge!  It's spinach, eggs, and onions in a flaky pastry.  Good enough, and for just $4.95, almost a meal in itself.  The chorizo was fine, but nothing spectacular.  I tried the skirt steak, again a huge portion for $19.95.  Two people with reasonable appetites could share the spinach pie and skirt steak and be perfectly satisfied.  The quality of the beef was very good, but the steak tasted too much like the gas flame it was grilled over.  Obviously, no wood grill at Rincon.  Also, I ordered the steak medium-rare, but it came out closer to medium, a mistake a lot of steakhouses make.  The steak came with a choice of potato, soup, salad, or mixed vegetables.  The mixed vegetables looked like the once-frozen variety, but at least good quality frozen veggies.  I got the huge portion of veggies wrapped because I wanted to try a couple of their desserts.  The Argentine alfajor was two thin cookies with a caramel paste in the middle, then dipped in white chocolate, good enough but not great.  The mil hojas (the Argentine version of a mille feuille) was what I really wanted to try.  Instead of pastry cream, the Argentine version fills the pastry layers with a caramel paste.  Even though I have a wicked sweet tooth, this was way too sweet for me.

Despite my tepid review of Rincon de Buenos Aires, I could see myself going back.  The prices and quality of their meats make for an excellent value.  And I loved the authenticity of the place.  Even if their execution isn't always top-notch, I had no doubt that this was true Argentine cuisine.  If I have a beef craving but don't want to spend big bucks at one of the Strip steakhouses, I'd much rather spend my $$ at Rincon than some place like Outback.  In fact, I'm pretty sure Rincon would be less expensive than Outback.",hJ6jVSwzPLUH_SVou4is7w,3,2,3,5LWPvN9LIXJmrMwXi2dYeQ

Had the Paradilla, empanadas, salad and dessert. Paradilla was cooked perfectly, tender and flavorful. The grill keeps the meat warm and crisp. They have real coals under the tableside grill. 

They also have a deli with great sandwiches, meat and other south american products. 
Only downers about this place are the decor, feels a little shabby inside (probably wouldnt bring a date here), and the hours. Place closes at 8 or 9 during the week. Just way too early!
I'm told by my Argentine people that the decor is actually super authentic and is a plus for them.

We made it all the way to Koreatown on Spring Mountain before we decided to backtrack and try out the ""Argentinian' place.

Since we weren't particularly hungry, we thought that we'd just peruse the menu and pick out a few appetizers. As soon as we saw the guarana and the Belgium-made mango juice, we realized that this wasn't an ordinary deli/restaurant. My son had the lasagna, which he enjoyed, and the rest of us shared the Parrillada Martin Fierro, which was one of the shared BBQ options. The meat was a little better than average, which is probably why it's priced so ""reasonably"", but what really sold it was the fragrance wafting from the cooker plunked down in front of us. That, in combination with the free flowing bread and chimichurri sauce, made it an enjoyable experience that we look forward to replicating in the future.

Ravioli - Wife hated it - said the sauce tasted sour
Salmon - daughter felt is was overdone.  Woke up the next morning vomiting up half digested fish.  No temperature so it must have been the food.  We suspect the fish was bad and they overcooked it to hide this.

It goes with every dish pretty much. I have had la pechuga, which is the chicken breast and it was delicious, somehow the flavor is different than what I had tried before in traditional U.S. American restaurants. Maybe is just me but the meats tend to be cooked to perfection in here, whether is beef, chicken or seafood.

It is also a deli, they sell meats and other Argentinian treats for you to take home and prepare. This restaurant is not big or fancy but when the food is this good, you won't mind at all.

The first time I went, an old argentine man was yelling at me en espanol because I parked in front of the store... he probably assumed that since I was Asian, I was going to one of the adjacent Asian businesses... but I wasn't.  This dude followed me in screaming about how 'this chino' was parked out front.  The folks inside assumed I didn't understand what he was saying since I guess Asians can't understand derogatory screaming and pointing... the folks inside seemed embarrassed enough but didn't apologize or try to remedy the situation. I blew the old guy off understanding that he was from another time and place. 

Fast forward some months, and I'm back in the store... this time I'm ignored and can't be served at the butcher counter... every Spanish speaker gets served but not the Asian dude waiting his turn.  

Fast forward again, and I'm back at the butcher counter... this time I'm served with a side of rude and haste... but there was a nice woman behind the counter who stepped in realizing what was happening.  She was very nice, but the same rude guy rang up my order at the register.  After getting my CC statement a few days later I realized I was overcharged by nearly double. 

So you might be wondering why I keep coming back?  It's because my wife is Argentine and occasionally wants stuff from the homeland.  she'll sends me for empanadas or some cuts of beef since my office is closer to this place than hers.  I personally am a sucker for mollejas and blood sausage, so I can put up with some BS.

If you order anything pre-made or from the restaurant- the food is very over cooked, salty and prepared last week.  It's not my thing, but my wife's family enjoys the soggy mayonnaise sandwiches with no crust.  Most if not all the cuts in the Parilla are pre-cooked and re-heated before bring served on the bed of coals...

My advice, go for the raw butcher cuts and grill them up at home... they're usually ok if you're looking for the more exotic cuts not found at Albertsons or Whole Foods.

We have been here a handful of times with our Argentine friend whom we let pick our feast. We have enjoyed everything we've tried, and as a meat lover you can't go wrong with parallada argentina which is a mixed grill of assortment of meats. There are several options with varying meats. The grill prices range between $32 and $35 and can be shared by 3-4 people. Whatever you choose make sure to pair it with their awesome Chimichurri sauce and toasted bread. Also make sure to save room for dessert and get their flan with caramel and whipped cream.

1773208,2017-01-31,10,ZPwx7ktiVluGFVg0L05n5A,"Hmm, mixed emotions about my visit. I will say the highlight was the chimichurri. I could put that on EVERYTHING! And the beer, they get points for that too. Not to mention the service was excellent. Perhaps I'm just not used to this type of food, whatever the case, it wasn't my cup of tea. 

The second you walk in you'll notice it's a no frills joint with this huge deli case (which I didn't expect to see) front and center taking up most of the restaurant. And even more strange the raw meat & ready made items in the same case. At this point I was just hoping I didn't leave with a terrible stomach ache. Somehow I managed to leave unscathed. 

The empanadas were tasty but lacked that flaky texture you'd expect from freshly made empanadas. We ordered the Parillada Argentina. Although sweetbreads aren't my thing, I was told they were very tasty. I tried it by mistake thinking it was chicken. One and done. That was enough for me. Doubt I'll ever be a fan of sweetbreads. The filet mignon was a tad overcooked. I had asked for medium, but it was definitely well-done. The outside was pretty rough and took some effort to cut with my steak knife. It did have a great flavor though so that could've been easily fixed. 

All in all, glad I ventured out to try something new. Love the mom & pop/family owned restaurant vibe here which is rare in this city.
And the fact that they had an actual changing table in the restroom, not that bulky plastic one you see everywhere else, made it feel like home or visiting relatives. Probably won't be back but glad to check another bookmark off my list.",SAWkTZbP79ildfrDsiqUrQ,9,8,3,OLrYGwgVKOV1pxhnYX8ydw
1791222,2013-06-13,0,ZPwx7ktiVluGFVg0L05n5A,"If you are new to Argentinian food and culture, there is one thing you have to you have to understand:  They know how to make grilled foods taste exceptionally wonderful.

At Rincon De Buenos Aires, you never know what is going to be going on.  Once when I was there, they had a well known bandoleon player in playing Argentine music.  We were able to get in a little tango dancing by the front door.  

Now about the food.  This last visit our group shared the Parillada Argentina.  It is served to your table sizzling on the grill.  We had Short Ribs, Skirt Steak, Sweet Bread, Sausage all grilled in the Argentine way.  We skipped the blood sausage as I wasn't sure I was up for that.  Everything was so perfectly cooked and we couldn't eat it all.  We also had a large salad to accompany the grilled food and that was a perfect side dish to balance the succulent meats.

Wine.  When in Rome..... you must order the Malbec to enjoy with your grilled items.

And let's have a moment to talk about Chimichurri.  What isn't that good on?  Have it on the fresh bread, on top of the meat, hmmmm I should try it on the salad also.  Chimichurri is made with garlic, parsley, onion and maybe some oregano.  

I also have had the empanadas.  It is a pastry filled with various fillings, typically chicken, beef and sometimes ham and cheese.  It's somewhat like the calzone in concept if you haven't had an empanada before.  Try this as an appetizer.  You may also want to take some home from the deli.

If you love mate, you can buy it here.  There's a little store attached to the restaurant where you can purchase Argentine ingredients.  This is where I go to get the empanda wrappers to make them at home.  You can buy mate loose or in tea bags.  If you are unfamiliar with mate, it is like a green tea with an earthy  flavor and is a drink of friendship in Argentina. especially in the gaucho culture.  It is made from a holly type of plant.  It is high in caffeine so maybe it would be a good alternative to your morning coffee. I like it with a little honey and lemon.

Highest of recommendations for the lomito completo sandwich, prepared with filet mignonette and a fried egg. It's the bomb. It's served with pommes frites that are perfectly crisp on the outside and soft on the inside, with just the right amount of salt. 

In addition to these two spectacular items, you are served a house baguette with chimmichurri sauce. The bread is good preparation for what to expect for your sandwich- a roll that is simultaneously crunchy outside, and soft inside without being undercooked, or doughy. The chimmichurri sauce is phenomenal, and great to dip your frites in as well.

Lastly, I cannot recommend the house sangria enough. It is made on site and is the perfect blend of fruit juices and wine to make a strong alcoholic yet palatable drink that you can probably drink endlessly. I know I did. A pitcher will get you six glasses, FYI. 

Service was top notch, our server was attentive and helpful, and available without being annoying, it didn't hurt that he was also good looking.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,8,3,4,YHcxkqSlMCDZ1R5wFRatjw

2133569,2014-06-05,0,ZPwx7ktiVluGFVg0L05n5A,"I followed Yelp reviews here when we looked for a Steakhouse - not many in Vegas are layman priced, but this one was.  Sure, you don't get your 40th floor view of the strip, white tablecloth experience, but the place has a charm of its own.  When you first walk in, you might think you're at the wrong place because it looks like a specialty deli, and actually is - you can purchase empanadas and an assortment of meats and cheeses.  But they added seating to the floor space to make it a restaurant.

I visited Argentina 6 months ago and the food here was very much comparably authentic.  We ordered the chicken, steak and yummy corn empanadas - they aren't made fresh, but still very good.  We were a party of 5 and ordered the Parilla plate and Ribeye, the latter of which was so succulent and bursting with flavors.  It paired VERY well with a bottle of Luigi Bosca Malbec, which I highly recommend - soft and silky smooth tannins, very well structured.  The parilla meats were enough to fill all of us (sweet bread, skirt steak, filet, sausage).

We topped things off with the dulce de leche cookie, flan and crepe (with dulce de leche).  They were all delicious - maybe too much caramel in the crepe, but no big deal.

Our waitress was very nice and they were prompt with food.  And again, the prices were very reasonable - about $150 for 5 of us, including a bottle of wine and three desserts and enough meat to fill all of us to the brim.

As we entered we were greeted by a pleasant hostess. The deli style restaurant was busy on a Friday evening at 4pm. I ordered  a cup of coffee and the Lomito Completo (Filet Mignon with Provolone Cheese, ham, fried eggs, tomato on a Baguette bread).

Their Columbia drip coffee was very good..I was impressed. Their Chimichurri sauce was excellent.  Unfortunately, the steak sandwich we ordered was little dry and lacking flavor...BUT we saved it by dumping the remains of the Chimichurri sauce (that we got at the beginning of the meal with the bread) on the sandwich. For dessert we ordered the Milhojas, but it tasted pretty awful..we did not like the taste or texture and stopped eating after two bites.

On this particular night the restaurant was understaffed and our poor waitress had to work way too hard. 

Because of their good Yelp reviews we'll probably return sometime in the future to try some different menu items (also for their tasty coffee). We were also impressed by their nice staff.

Although I don't remember what I ordered, I couldn't get enough of the chimichurri sauce; I was using it on everything from the bread to my dish.  I thought there was crack in the sauce it was so good.  On the way out I perused the deli case and the market checking to see if they had chimichurri for sale, which they did.  The chimichurri sauce is bottled in these big ass bottles similar to the Ball jars you might see in certain stores or restaurants.  I ended up getting a jar and used it for everything and anything when I got home.

If you're ever visiting in Vegas, I would recommend this place instead of the traditional buffets everyone and their mom go to.  This is definitely the place I will be at the next time I'm in Vegas.",U_QdcntNa4Q9qFITe16cCw,3,2,5,9pVOLZsaHhgrx2L8A2ZeZQ

My boyfriend, is half Italian and Argentinian and he was eager to try this place out for dinner.   

When we walked in, the restaurant/market smelled delicious! It didn't help that we were starving and wanted to order everything on the menu. Luckily the server quickly brought out complimentary bread and homemade chimichurri. We both wished the bread was warm or toasted, but it wasn't - it was room temperature. The bread wasn't the best or the freshest, but the chimichurri certainly made up for it. The chimichurri was flavorful and had a nice acidity to it.  

We ended up with 4 different hot baked empanadas $2.25 each: 
Beef - Very rich and meaty flavor, my boyfriend like this one the most. 4/5

Spinach - thick spinach and cheese filling. I enjoyed this one. 4/5

Corn - piping hot insides and tasted similar to creamed corn - just not as sweet. 2/5

Ham & cheese - this one also had a very hot and gooey cheese filling and ham bits. This is one of my favorites. 4/5

Also we shared a rather huge hot sandwich - Lomito Completo $10.99:
Not worth $11 - A very thin hammered down piece of mignon with melted provolone cheese, very salty ham, fried eggs, lettuce, tomato, mayo, on a baguette bread. The steak and ham were thin and way over salted. The salt was so strong that it offended my taste buds. The fried egg was overcooked so it didn't have a runny yolk and that's always a shame in my book. The sandwich was a generous size in a huge bread roll. We were only able to tackle a half of it. The fries that accompanied it were nice, hot and crispy, just the way I like my fries. I just couldn't get past the over salting issue - I could feel my mouth shriveling up. 2/5

We also ordered 1 soda. Our total damage was $25 and change. 

In the end, we were uncomfortably full - everything was extremely heavy, oily, and extra salty. I did appreciate their empanadas, but the hot sandwich was a hot salty mess.",u_wqt9RshdZsoj8ikLqoEQ,7,4,3,ovL25RUkfQoJ1m_Hsbwmeg

The solid reviews on Yelp gave me hope for a wonderful experience. The soft bread, flavorful chimmichurri, Buenos Aires salad, and beef empanada were spot on. The fries were perfectly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. I ordered a fried egg with a soft yolk to dip the fries in and noshed on that tasty treat. When the filet mignon, my favorite cut, came out I could hardly wait! It looked beautifully done. While for most American's medium well is the standard, having a steak well-done is not atypical for Argentine steak; however without the more chewy toughness that comes from an American well-done steak. Most filets or adados  that I have  come out like butter well done. To my surprise, my filet mignon was tough and chewy. I had trouble cutting it with my sturdy steak knife. In fact the steak in a casino Mexican restaurant 2 days before had bested this by far. I was stumped about what to do as I hate to waste food, but this steak was so far off the mark of previous Argentine steaks and even non-Argentine steaks that I couldn't eat more than a couple of bites. Thankfully, the waitress was ultra accommodating and offered a different steak option, comped beverage and extra fries, and brought out a much more adequate New York strip. All the staff displayed gracious and accommodating demeanors with no attitude over the concern about the food. They more than made up for the snafu with the filet with their professional and pleasant customer service.

2832970,2015-07-12,0,ZPwx7ktiVluGFVg0L05n5A,"This last trip to Vegas, my group decided to keep things a bit more low-key and hit up some interesting spots that were off the beaten path, but were things we wouldn't normally get at home.

That was the mindset that led us here to Rincon de Buenos Aires. This place is located in a semi-shady part of town, in a strip mall which houses a giant neon-clad Chinese restaurant called ""The Jade"". When you first step into Rincon, it's not really what you'd expect out of a highly-rated restaurant. It's a hybrid deli/grocery store/restaurant. The tables are packed in very tight, and if you're someone who doesn't really enjoy a restaurant smelling ""like food"", you're going to be kind of taken aback.

Once you push past that, you'll treat yourself to a pretty good dining experience. Rincon de Buenos Aires is one part churrascaria, one part Korean BBQ. What I mean by that, is that their most commonly ordered dish is a giant pile of different steaks brought out to you on a mini-grill that is still hot. If your steak's not cooked to the level of doneness you want, just wait, it'll get there.

We ordered empanadas to start, which were tasty, but not great for me. I prefer my empanadas to have a good firmness to the crust, but the beef one that I got was soft and doughy. One of our group ordered the ham & cheese, and they had to make that one fresh so that the cheese melted, and he said it was much better. I also ordered a Cusquena, which turned out to be a fine crisp light beer, but nothing special.

Then came the big pile of steak. The three of us ordered the second option, (the one without the sweetbreads, which I an not a fan of) which includes filet mignon, flap meat, and short ribs. All of it was great quality meat. I think because it reminded me so much of a churrascaria, I was expecting to be seasoned more heavily, but it was pretty much lightly seasoned and seared.

We also ordered the salmon grillado to get something that wasn't cow. The salmon was cooked up nice and tasty. The menu said it was served with potatoes au gratin, but that's no au gratin. It was a few potato slices that had been oven baked with processed, dried parmesan cheese. I hate when places offer up ""Parmesan-style Cheese Dust"" as ""Parmesan cheese"" but I still enjoyed the salmon.

To finish the meal, we got the flan mixto, which I quite enjoyed. The caramel topping on the side is pretty great.

All tolled, the 3 of us had a very substantial meal with appetizers, drinks, and dessert for about $75 after tax. Solid eats.",eiSIwHugjw9GlbqCgbER8A,3,0,4,ypic8zw23M_k3k1OhqjEMA

The food was delicious! They quickly brought us out warm bread, oil, balsamic and chimichurri. We started off with a ""tarta pascualina"" which is a little spinach pie and a ""picada a los Buenos Aires"" a cheese/ meat platter with potato salad. For our main dish, we ordered two of the parilladas, (which are an assortment of meats brought out on a coal grill), a side of mashed potatoes and the Italian salad. I didn't try the 3 story flan, but it got great reviews by friends. We were a party of 5 and there was plenty of food to go around.

3136237,2018-05-15,0,ZPwx7ktiVluGFVg0L05n5A,"Rincón de Buenos Aires was busy when I arrived around 6:40 PM. Immediately detected an overwhelmed staff, to the point of antagonizing, as if my mere presence had driven them over the edge, but since I know moody, and have dealt with moody, I did not let this deterred me from my quest to buy mil hojas and empanadas. Neither were worth praising, but the mil hojas specially was the biggest disappointment.
Mil Hojas is a highly regarded South American staple, which Argentina is widely known to prepare deliciously, among other versions like in Chile (amazingly good as well), Peru also makes them good. 
What is essential in the preparation of Mil Hojas is the Dulce de Leche, known in its higher form as Manjar Blanco. Prepared with wholesome milk , but now a days, more and more often, condensed milk, which by boiling unopened turns darker and solidifies, and now is also called Dulce de Leche, which in a way is a valid name. 
The real one used to be made with combinations of high grade milks and sugar, and several hours of stirring with a wooden paddle, under a medium size fire, to prevent any burning at the bottom of a huge copper based container. That method is way in the past, and very rare these days.
Now just boil the cans and you can still call it Dulce de Leche, but any combination short of that, and your Mil Hojas suffer. Nutella, Caramel, fake copies and you  no longer have a worthy creation. Rincon de Buenos Aires cut enough corners in the making of their Mil Hojas, that their version is a discredit to real Mil Hojas everywhere. 1.5 Stars.
Their Empanadas are edible, but the dough needs finesse, and the fillings too. How about some remedial training back home, where empanadas and mil hojas are second to none. So let's review: pissy service, terribly wrong mil hojas, and overpriced average at best empanadas. Sometimes, I've come to find out, the negative reviews are not necessarily the enemy of good eating, but instead the most sober and accurate of the opinions. Yes, there is the slight chance that all the rest of their extensive menu is nothing short of 5 Stars food, but one would have to be a little gullible to buy in to that line of thinking, with the righteous exception if one is Argentinian, for they are known to be supportive and loyal to all things displaying their country of birth. In that case, expect plenty of 5 Stars, like any patriotic citizen would be likely to rate, whichever country it may be. Not a mirage score, but a real one. 2 Stars.",6JiGnxcBqhkxNppZ7bdSXw,1,0,2,kTyqrpsgBZUvI1zSQgRUkQ

To cut a long story short, the service sucked and the foods was American. Obviously we only had a small selection to base on... forgot to try the sweet bread.

I had the BBQ grill with 3 kinds of steaks... Fillet Mignon, skirt, and flat. It's all tasted good, with American flavor. Can't tell what's so special about the taste. The meats were slightly overdone... in most cuts here. And the portable hot grill plate (where the meat was served on the table) kept them cooking even further. For the price, there was no side dishes... but you certainly can order a la carte... French fries $3.95 and mixed salad $4.95.

My friend order Fillet Mignon. He loved it. It was missing some cooked vegetables on the plate but he didn't complain. It came with a medium size mixed dinner salad (I thought medium size fries was included... we did not order it but it was brought to the table and we got charge for it) for $17.95. It was harder to swallow under the circumstance.

It came with free breads and strong garlic olive oil for dipping. I used it on the salad too. Not bad. The Argentinian tea (in a tea bag) was interesting and not bad, but not much different than regular herbal tea on my not-so-subtle tongue.

A boxing game (Khan and Maidona) was being streamed live from Mandalay bay. It was not very crowded. Our server was very friendly but communication was not the best. And worse, she was watching the game more than attending to our needs. The bus boy did a better job to get us hot water to refill tea, and bread basket.

My friend loved the food experience overall. It's OK for me.

So diners, enjoy some American dishes (the other was mainly Americanized Italian). Service can be spotty. Make sure you double check your order for extra foods and unexpected charges.",P-CRYltpvp4aABRctIZWtg,0,0,3,nn-vrrpkZPq8JR-BVRjo0g

The ambiance was cute-- it's part deli, part restaurant, and part grocery.  Service was warm and friendly.  I was happy to be able to buy some alfajores (dulce de leche cookies) to take home.  I also appreciated their selection of South American sodas.

Unfortunately, the food just wasn't very good.  One of the things I crave more than anything is a provoleta.  This is provolone cheese seasoned with oregano and then grilled.  The provoleta here was small and tasted like it came out of a microwave.  It was sad and boring.

The empanadas I tried (we ordered one of each variety) were all blah.  The steak was a huge disappointment.  It was like an average supermarket steak that hadn't been properly cooked or seasoned.  It was grilled unevenly and the chimichurri was bland and boring.

I would not go back to Rincon de Buenos Aires unless I were just picking up items from the grocery selection.",lWeTtxym6jZztQcumO1f0w,2,0,2,LkC1CAzoBttXLQwYSXQpwQ

The filling was quite good, but I wasn't too crazy about the crust.  The salad had heart of palms, roast red peppers, red onions, boiled eggs, tomatoes and romaine lettuce in it.  It was huge and very refreshing.  For $7.99 it was a good deal.  The meat platter was also a good deal.  It came with two pieces of short ribs, two skirt steaks, a piece of fillet mignon, a piece of flap meat and our additional piece of chicken breast.  The short ribs were a little tough, but the rest of the meats weren't bad.  For less than $40, we had it was quite a feast with all those meats.

It is like a cross between Latino/Caribbean and Italian, if I had to characterize it.  Try the Chicken Milanese.  It comes pretty simply prepared, just pounded out, breaded chicken, but well-seasoned.  Empanadas are a no-brainer (and a bit like a Jamaican beef patty, if I had to analogize it).  There is little to no ambience here, unless you count the World Cup or other soccer game on a TV.  Also, as another Yelper pointed out, there is a bit of xenophobia here, if you are not Latino.  But go with a thick skin, and a brave spirit, or with an Argentine friend (as I did).  I like the fact that they sell Argentine staples here, too, like Mate (a type of tea that is high caffeine).

There was just too much of it to go to waste. So my senses took over and like the natural carnivore that I am, I ravaged a juicy piece of filet mignon!

The popular section on the menu is the Parrilladas or Argentinean BBQ. Its great because you can SHARE! $34 a plate?...yea, you better share!
You can get short rib, skirt steak, filet mignon, sausage, flap meat, and sweat bread!!!

Sweat bread is something that I have been hearing a lot of lately, so I was pleasantly surprised to see it on the menu and really wanted to try to eat it. So how does it taste? Like chicken of course!! However, it had a little hint of a fried egg - texture and look is like that of cooked chicken.

They present the meats on its own grill, still cooking - so you smell all the smoky goodness right in front of you. Served with a basket of bread and chimichurri sauce which is to die for.

The empanadas are good...all of them are good - beef, chicken, spinach, and potato!
You have to drink it down with the local beer, Quilmes. It's a light lager, leaning towards the sweet side. It compliments nicely next to all the grilled meat. Washes it all down without distracting the flavor. 

Don't want red meat, get Mariscos Buenos Aires - its squid, shrimp, clams, and scallops in a light garlic, tomato, and wine sauce. Seafood was good, but it was the first time that I had seafood in a tomato sauce. I guess, I was thinking it was going to be more garlic and creamy. But for the most part it was good. Would I get it again? Not unless I had an ulcer or turned vegetarian. The restaurant is definitely known for their red meat.

Not only is this place a restaurant, but it's also a deli and a super small market. Mainly offering cheese & meats that you would typically find for South American Latin cooking.",XQU46gFfVmgSjTOTvc5Jew,3,2,4,rYb_2CM6B_aURQiDH19qZA

It didn't seem to go together, but I get it now.  They have more than just Argentinian food but that's the highlight.  It's the corner storefront of this U shaped shopping plaza in Chinatown, hence the name.

I came here with a friend for a late morning lunch and we ordered and shared many items from the menu.  We were brought some bread and chimichurri.  The spices in the chimichurri were very good and went well on the bread and some meat we had later on.

We started with an order of provoletta--grilled provolone cheese topped with chili and the chimichurri spices.  We took our knives and dug in and pulled up some cheese that hung like melted cheese will.  I put the cheese on my bread.  Vary tasty and great start.  We then got the order of three empanadas--one ham and cheese, one chicken, and one corn and cheese.  All three were good.  I liked the chicken the most.  The crust was flaky and thin.  The amount of filling for the three was perfect.

Then came the main course--a Parrillada Argentina, a mixture of grilled meat.  Ours consisted of three sausages, sweet bread, skirt steak, and short ribs.  It was perfect for sharing.  We each had a length of short rib, one white sausage each, we shared the one black sausage (blood sausage or blood pudding are two names for it) and we each had a skirt steak.  We got all the meat cooked medium.  The skirt steak was a little tough but it was tasty.  The chimichurri added to the meat.  The grilled meats were really very good.  My favorite here was the blood sausage.  It's the first time I've had it and it was quite good.

Then we ordered four desserts to share--dulce de leche flan, an alfajor, a Mil Hojas, and a pasta frola.  While all four were excellent, I had two favorites here--the mil hojas and the alfajor.  I'd had an alfajor once before and it was good to have this sweet cookie once again and the mil hojas had a great filling of chocolate and the spice, which we couldn't quite place was cardamon our server told us.  The flan was very soft and the pasta frola--quince tart--was also quite good.  

Service was great!  Our server was a delightful young woman who answered questions and always had a pleasant smile.  She refilled our water glasses several times.

We started with two empanadas, 1 beef, and 1 spinach.  Flaky, flavorful and tasty.  Beef was the winner.  They serve crusty bread with a nice dish of chimmichurri.  Excellent. The bread is crunchy so you can really soak up at that oily garlicky herby goodness.  We all chose a hot sandwich served with french fries.  I had a delectable sandwich (can't remember the name) but denoted with a star as a favorite.  It was steak, ham, provolone, fried egg, lettuce and tomatoes on a baguette.  It was awesome.  Dad had the choripan.  It was an argentinian sausage sliced on a baguette with chimmichurri.  Very good, and a bargain at only $6.50 for a 9' sandwich with a pile of fries.  My husband had the sweetbread sandwich.  He was in heaven.  Swears they were the best sweetbreads he has ever had.  He raved....5 stars!!!  He also tried the local brew - Quilmes - he wasn;t a fan but understood how they must go down easy on a hot day.  We took home some sandwich halves and extra fries.

What did I get
Went with a couple of coworkers after a long day at the convention center! We got the platter of meat of course. They had the portion for 2 but we upgraded since we had 4 people. But 2 was more than enough! We also got some things to go with it. Got fries and also the potato salad which were good! When the meat is on the fire, careful the oils will splatter everywhere and the fire isn't controllable since it's coals. The meat was good, seasoned right! It was A LOT of meat! 

Environment 
Seemed like they had a little deli section to the right. Pretty quite place, good for sit down and chatting. 

Niceness of people
The servers were nice but tried to overdose us with meat! They made sure we were enjoying our meals. Made suggestions on what's popular.

Honestly I think those were the stars for me bc they had nice charred crisp edges but were so tender inside and maybe the skirt steak is third. Beef empenada was so good too and of course everything was drenched in chimichurri which made it 10x better, in fact I was practically drinking it with every bite. Best Argentinian food experience I've ever had instead of those stupid buffets where they come around cutting meats for u. They literally put a hot sizzling grill right on the table that keeps the meat hot throughout the whole meal. The flan is so good too and not super dense nor too sweet which I like. The dulce de leche is a nice little touch and definitely sweet but on the side so I could nibble here and there. Awesome food!!!!",xG_UtKXuRR-vXcPsqbZm7w,0,0,5,sPBEpOfl_hHT3EXJv94-Sg
4386924,2011-05-17,4,ZPwx7ktiVluGFVg0L05n5A,"Rincon de Buenos Aires is a very nondescript shop that can easily get lost in the noise of china town.  The first thing you see when looking a the shop is a bunch of different signs that say deli, bakery and finally the name of the business.  But, on to the show!

As usual, when I go to a restaurant for the first time, I try to try as many items on the menu as possible without physically getting ill.  So this journey included the chicken empenada, beef milanesa sandwich and finally the skirt steak, and oh the chimichurri sauce...

So the bread with chimichurri sauce they serve is no joke.  At first you take a little nibble of bread with a light dip in the sauce.  If you aren't careful, you be soon asking for bread by the ton and taking chimichurri shooters off a hooker.  The chimichurri sauce is THAT DAMN GOOD.  But, don't let the chimichurri seduce you into getting full.  You have to try other things.

The chicken empenada was moist, with great spices and flavor all mixed into the shredded chicken.  The milanesa was the only underwhelming item I tried, but a healthy dose of chimichurri sent the sandwich overboard.

The star of this adventure was definitely the skirt steak.  Easily, one of the top four steaks I have had to date.  I ordered it medium rare and it was cooked perfectly, with a charred-spice crust on the outside, perfectly pink inside, and ohh soo tender and juicy.  The skirt could easily stand on its own with out ANY extras, but the addition of a bit of the chimichurri, and boom, you may need to clean up your pants.  Instant orgasm.

4484786,2016-06-26,8,ZPwx7ktiVluGFVg0L05n5A,"I chose Rincon because of the excellent reviews on Yelp, and because I'm really a latina at heart, if not DNA.  Having been to Buenos Aires twice, it would be like going home.

I had made a reservation; it turned out not to be necessary when we arrived at 8:45, but might be earlier.  The tables are in front of and to one side of a very wide deli counter, which serves as a take-away empanada place, dessert haven, deli, cheese shop and even butcher, and I imagine it could get crowded earlier.

We were greeted warmly by, I guess, the manager, who is from Chile, another favorite place, and seated at a comfortable table.  Limited wines and beer are offered.

Since we don't eat some of the items offered on the parillada, I ordered the Lomito Completo and my husband had the Grilled Lemon Chicken sandwich, which has cheese and red bell pepper.  We both had salads instead of fries, his with onions, mine without.  The salads were simply lettuce and a good supply of sliced tomatoes, not remarkable, but large and very fresh.

To start, Herb ordered a chicken and vegetable soup, served piping hot in a deep bowl, and full of large chunks of chicken, a variety of fresh vegetables, including butternut squash,delicious, and obviously not from a can.

The sandwiches were as good as can be for Las Vegas, where the concept of dense bread apparently is unattainable.  My lomito was cooked medium rare, just as I ordered, and the combination of the steak, ham, and fried egg was heavenly.  Herb loved his, too, and we were both too full to finish our sandwiches.  Yay, no cooking tomorrow!  

Service was friendly and efficient, our only complaint being that the sandwiches came before the soup was even finished.  This is a minor nit for an otherwise wonderful meal, a great place to practice my Spanish, and another Vegas ""find"" to add to our list of favorites.",m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,10,13,4,QCvR6543bqbuvz7yTzE1cg

The empanadas I never miss. These aren't the Mexican style jelly filled empanadas, they are the delicious meat and cheese filled kind. They are so good they take you right to the streets of Argentina. I ordered these my second time there, and every time I go back I always start with them. 

I've also ordered other items, that frankly, failed pretty hard. Last time I went I had a breaded and fried chicken, pollo empanizado, it was spendy for what you got. Tasted like it had been bought from the pre-cooked frozen food section of wal-mart, and it didn't look good either. Poor meat quality, and one of those individually sliced cheese squares melted on top. Two people, bill came out to ~$45 for two of those, a plate of three empanadas, and two sodas. 

Moral of the story, go there for the beef. Get steak, get there asado style meals, get the things you would want to get if you flew into Buenos Aires, I haven't been dissappointed yet when I order the right items. 

Between my visits with myself and my wife, we each have ordered plates that we didn't like...at all...but when we order the right items, this place can't be beat.

Lastly, they have a little store in the back, you can go in and get mate, alfajores, and a whole host of other Argentine products. Not bad at all.",MuYklhk7iLSvwLBLpjC9XQ,0,0,3,3ZyIxFahjvwEki4-jZpN0g

4579966,2013-04-12,2,ZPwx7ktiVluGFVg0L05n5A,"A co-worker of mine recommended this place to me. She's FROM Argentina, so when she told me that this place is IT, I whole-heartedly trusted her. 

The place is located on Spring Mountain in a little plaza called Cathay Hills. Yes, it's where Cathay House is located. If you love dim-sum, then I'm sure you've eaten there.  But I'm not reviewing dim-sum right now so moooooving oooooon....

This place is located on the left side of the plaza and it's half restaurant, quarter deli, and a quarter supermarket. I haven't really looked around the other half of the place because I immediately sit down and am completely eager to get served the DELICIOUS chimichurri that they place on your table, with white toasty bread. I have NEVER had chimichurri in my life and I feel like my life really hadn't been complete before tasting the vinegary, olive oily, garlic-y sauce of the Gods. I literally slathered it on every single thing I had on my plate. 

It's been a few months since I've been there, so forgive me for not remembering what the official names of the dishes we've ordered are. 

Their empanadas always taste like they JUST rolled them out and filled them like 4 minutes before they served them to you. Fresh. Flavorful. Delicious. You have to order them. 

I know we've had their steak sandwich. The meat is really tender and I have no idea what they marinate their meat in, but it's amazing. SLATHER on the chimichurri and you're DONE. 

I've ordered a breaded steak with a FRIED EGG on top. The steak was tender and flavorful and if I remember correctly, in between the steak and the breading was some sort of garlic and parsley mixture that just sent this whole dish on another level of decadence and to top it of with a fried egg? I. CAN'T. EVEN. (my mouth is filling up with saliva as I type this.) 

I know we've had some french fries (came with the sandwich), which are pretty standard but AGAIN, dip them in that chimichurri and the whole thing just livens up. It's no longer a simple potato stick. It's a hotter, sexier and more flavorful potato stick that the other potato sticks whistle and gawk at while it walks on the side of the road, wind blowing in its luscious potato stick hair. (don't know where that came from.)

Their flan is pretty tasty and they serve sodas like Inca Cola to make your meal extra authentic, lol :D soooooo deliciously creamy and bubbly.

The service is always SUPER friendly and home-y and I swear, every time I go there, the waitresses are always laughing with and talking to at least two other patrons that they are either REALLY close friends with or their hospitality is just THAT amazing. I HIGHLY recommend this place. It's a hole-in-the-wall that deserves lots of LOOOOVE! go there for lunch. or dinner. just go. NOW!",eH8-DE48eh6xXnoKc6_lnw,1,1,5,FTbd1phXC5kICkQ6ecio2A

The dipping sauce is fresh herbs and garlic that they bottle there, and you may slather your food in. They serve you a fresh basket of bread for the dipping and again it's on point.

I ordered empanadas as appetizers, and I went for a rare grilled ribeye steak, morcilla and a salad (tomato, egg and carrot). Taste, texture and aroma were just heaven, awesome and an inspiration to the senses. A glass of red wine was a perfect match to the meat.

Empanadas were delicious. We had beef, chicken, and one spinach. Everyone agreed they were tasty and enjoyed that they were not deep fried. The meat platters came out next still sizzling. The meat is almost perfect and will continue to cook as you sit there so if u like your meat rare then grab it off there sooner than later. There was filet, flap, skirt, and short ribs. Seasoned perfect, but we added chimmichurri to the meat for even more flavor. The salad on the side help tame all the meats lol it was just lettuce tomato and red onion I believe.

We went ahead and ordered the Parrillada Martin Fierro which consists of kalbi,skirt steak, flap meat and filet mignon. We also added sausage since I didn't come with it. Also and two orders of Spanish rice which is a la carte. One order was not enough for the both of us. We came hungry though.  

They brought over the meat feast and man oh man! I can't state how much I enjoyed this. Cooked a perfect medium so it was still juicy and pink inside. So delicious yet seasoned simply so the meat can stand on its own. My favorite was the filet but all the meats were really good. At one point in the meal my fiancé mentioned he was meat wasted! In a good way of course. Drizzle the meat with chimichurri and eat it with the rice that soak up the juices from the meat. Honestly it was the best meal I've had in a long time and my mouth is watering just reminiscing. I will definitely be back to try the other meat platters as to decide which one is my favorite.

My colleague were telling me to try rincon de buenos aires for their special steak for 2 and that the restaurant was romantic and stuff. I arrived at a deli and it feels absolutely weird and non romantic at all. 

We ordered the food that my friend told me to ordered. Which is paierlla something martin fierro. A bunch of combination of meat for $34.99. I was expecting some magical steak with some argintenian sauce that I dont know about since I am a food connoiseur and I would like to be blown away.

I wasnt expecting just bunch of low quality meat put on a charcoal based pan seared only with seasalt. I can do that myself thanks very much.

So suffice to say I am very dissapointed having to spend $60 for lunch and its not something that I honestly happy about. Service was good and attentive but its a one and done for me.",gm20Rasn38z5xdnd7_iM4g,0,0,3,KxDAaFM_09PIfvFS3XEfcg

Think Argentina and one thing comes to mind, grilled beef and plenty of it.  The best part, this is beef for beef lovers.  Called butchers cuts in the States, these juicy cuts pack in the flavor.  A bath in chimichurri and... ahhh....

Perhaps I shouldn't be writing this review as Rincon De Buenos Aries is one of the best kept local's secrets in Vegas, the meat made me do it.

Skip everything and go straight to the mixed grills.  Each, loaded with different thick cuts of beef  and meant to be shared.  All served literally on a grill with burning charcoal.  Meats will continue to cook.  Don't let them sit.  Salt for seasoning and a bowl of chimichurri, the required condiment.  Uneven thickness therefore uneven doneness, a great thing.  Fire grilling adds charred bits of bitterness and a hint of acrid smokiness.  
 
The Parrillada Argentina outstanding.  Fatty, grilled short rib on the bone, tender skirt steak, firm, smooth, flavorful sweetbreads,  a gently spiced white sausage and wonderful, minerally blood sausage.  For the squeamish, the Parrillada Martin Fierro (stupidly ordered with the previous grill - way too much food for four people) includes short ribs, skirt steak, flap meat, an chunks of fillet mignon.

The chimichurri itself, a showcase of vegetal parsley, herbaceous oregano, pungent minced garlic, spicy heat from crushed red pepper, peppery richness of olive oil and the acidic zing of vinegar.  Just the thing to refresh the palate for the next bite.

Plenty of Quilmes (Argentinean beer) to keep spirits high and wash everything down.

Great setting, part deli, part Argentinean grocery store, foreign tongues, and if you're lucky football (soccer) cheering.  Very friendly and welcoming service.

An all around excellent experience that begs to be repeated.",oeAhRa8yFa9jtrhaHnOyxQ,20,14,4,9hxsrU2cNJTvsv02b-VIhg

He said their flan is 100% authentic Argentinian, not the typical flan we get over here in the States.

I had the seafood plate, which I swear, except for the fact that there was no fish, it was the best cioppino I've ever had, which I've had at several restaurants at Fisherman's Wharf in San Francisco.  This was sooo much better.  The husband had the ""choripan"" which he raved about.

It is not fancy, and the service is casual, i.e. we had to get up to get drink refills. But, the spot feels authentic (even though I am in no way an Argentine expert). They were showing a soccer game on their televisions, and it wasn't being broadcast in English. That is when I decided the place was legit.  

As others have noted, the chimichurri sauce deserves to be poured generously on everything. It is delicious and fresh. We ordered the meat fest for 2 (I think that is an accurate translation), and it came on a miniature charcoal grill with two filets, two skirt steaks and 2 short ribs for $30. The meat wasn't incredible, but the value is! We also ordered the mixed green salad which is a large bowl of leafy lettuce, thinly sliced red onions and tomatoes served simply with oil and vinegar.

Located in the same Spring Mountain plaza as Cathay House and featuring signage indicating both their Argentinean roots and Italian influences, Rincon de Buenos Aires is the sort of spot that one could easily overlook in an area so heavy in Asian influence, but with strong endorsement from an out-of-town friend and another from Chowhound I finally decided to visit the sizeable space on Saturday with results more than exceeding modest expectations.  Undoubtedly a spot where 'regulars' are expected while newcomers are welcomed with open arms it was just after 11am when my friend and I entered the Argentinean barbeque doubling as bakery, deli, as well as gourmet market and quickly seated beneath an LCD television displaying futbol while the rest of Las Vegas buzzed about the American collegiate variety it was as though we'd instantly been transported many miles away, our smiling server just efficient enough in English to guide our hand to a baker's dozen of options served alongside toasty bread and herbal chimichurri that eschewed heat in favor of earthy notes and smoothness that complimented everything on which it was poured.  Beginning first with a trio of empanadas that featured flaky puff pastry around intensely spiced chicken, cheddar studded in pork, and shucked corn with sweetness tempered by onions and cream one would be hard pressed to choose a winner amongst the group and turning next to the Italian Provoletta a similar theme emerged, the texture intensely creamy while diverse aromatics and just a hint of spice tickled the palate with each balanced bite.  Unable to ignore the tabletop barbeque, presented still sizzling with pre-set options or choices a la carte, it was after perhaps thirty minutes that our enormous entrée arrived and featuring more than enough for a family of four to share we each sampled widely, the blood sausage particularly noteworthy for myself with a spice profile and texture on par with artisan sausages I've paid double for elsewhere while the tender sweetbreads were also beyond reproach.  Transitioning to dessert I was fortunate to be dining with a friend who was more than willing to take the overindulgent approach and although I'm rather certain I consumed the majority of what was ordered there is no doubt that we were both invariably impressed by everything that arrived - the milky flan smooth yet rich while both the Milhojas and Alfajor presented a more restrained sweetness and textural juxtapositions of cream amidst crunch, a slice of quince pie rounding out the quartet with the fruit's intense sweetness finding its foil in a buttery golden crust.

Every bit as good as the rumors, and the very definition of 'hidden in plain sight,' Rincon de Buenos Aires is the sort of place anyone looking for something 'new' or 'different' should investigate, the prices trending a bit higher than much of Spring Mountain but quality of product, preparation, and service far outperforming most of them as well.  To the best of my knowledge the only Argentine barbeque in Las Vegas and one of the few places where blood sausage and sweetbreads can be bought by the pound even vegetarians will be safe here as the restaurant offers a number of unique pastas, pizzas, and produce driven options...not to mention prepackaged goods, ready-to-bake empanadas, and desserts that are well worth the effort even if you decide to take them home for later and skip the sizzling meats.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,5,3,4,cn95VEX0SbRyaBX2dM-TPA

Located along Spring Mountain somewhere in Chinatown, you'll find this unassuming place.  It's in the same complex as Cafe de Japon and Cathay House.  They have a few tables and there was only 1 server when we went here - he did try his best to provide good service to all the diners so I can't fault him for that.

We were given a basket of bread with an amazing cup of chimuchurri on the side.  That's it, end of review!  

But wait, I still have to share the other fantastic parts of the meal.  We had the empanadas (a beef, a chicken and a spinach) which were yummy.  I liked the chicken empanada the most.  The crust wasn't as crisp as the Spanish empanadas I'm used to but the filling was great.  We also got the parrillada Martin Fierro (short ribs, filet mignon, skirt steak and flap meat) with a side of papas fritas de provenzal (garlic fries).  The meats were so tender, juicy and packed with flavor then dip it in chimichurri?  Oh my goodness!  Intense tastebud experience!  The papas fritas were warm, crisp and garlicky.

For dessert I finished a mixto flan by myself.  The syrupy flan kind of looks strange but it's good.  It came with a side of crema chantilli and dulce de leche.  Eating the flan wih the dulce de leche was divine!

It was a little slow, not going to deny that, but the atmosphere of the place was nice, people talking, it was almost festive. There was also this really hot looking woman sitting but he door with her boyfriend, but that is another story.

Food was great, the bread was excellent. No complaints.. and the old man had a beer, so you know it was a good evening!",HgbQqUyMAp_Q7I-ZlkyfWw,0,0,5,y-tOOU9bEeYXzt0pJH9FtQ

My parents are from Argentina so this is the go to place if you want very close to authentic Argentinian food. Of course, nothing can beat a parrillada in Buenos Aires, but this place gets it pretty close! They also have Quilmes, the beer from Argentina, which is almost impossible to get here. 
If you're looking to try a variety of meet,  I recommend the parillada Argentina. It comes with chorizo, skirt steak, blood sausage, and sweet bread. Don't forget to smother their delicious chimicurri all over the meat! They also have a deli where you can buy empanadas, meat, cheese, and... Wait for it
.. SANDWICHES DE MIGA!! If you don't know what these are, I feel so sorry for your taste buds being deprived from deliciousness. They come in a pack of 6 sandwiches and look like little thin sandwiches without crust. Please do yourself a favor and order the ham and cheese ones and the mixed. They are so freaking good. 
The only reason I don't give 5 stars is because the service is super slow. They only had one waitress working when I went and they were completely slammed. I had to get up and ask her for the check. The parking situation here also sucks if you're going around lunch time. There is barley any parking so you'll have to drive around a few times and wait for someone to leave. 
HIGHLY recommended for those who want a taste of Argentina!",lHFkt91UFwQUywggO8yDHA,3,0,4,WWztq5nkFyHIs6y1DTTopw

5685323,2017-05-04,0,ZPwx7ktiVluGFVg0L05n5A,"We are huge fans of the Brazilian steakhouses but they are so darn expensive and as we get older we just can't do these buffet style restaurants justice anymore. We feel like we're not quite getting our money's worth, especially when you have to pay for a child too. We heard about this place years ago and finally decided to check it out as a lower cost alternative, and that's the best way we can describe it. If you love the Brazilian meat style but don't want to break the bank, this is a good alternative. We got the meat sampler and it was really tasty, enough to feed my, my wife and my son but we're not that big eaters, might be more for two if you can pack in a ton of meat. We threw in a $6 side salad which was basic but good, came in a large bowl and was enough for about 3-4 servings. With the bread and chimichuri sauce (which was killer by the way and we packed in a couple servings), we had plenty of food for about $50. The three of us could hit a decent casino buffet in town and get a wider variety of food for about the same price but this is different, their meat is much better and worth it for the chimichuri sauce as an added bonus.

As others have said, having the huge deli counter as part of a restaurant is a bit odd. However, its really a simple, deli style restaurant to begin with, they focus on the quality of food not how fancy your table is and I'm ok with that. If you're looking for fancy or a special occasion, perhaps not the right place for you on that night. Seems like they get a lot of foot traffic purchasing food from the deli to go and you can't blame them, I'll probably be back to do the same as I've got to try those empanadas (not sure why we didn't grab some to go- dang!).",yhfoZ_qAlC8SzsAwlUoRFQ,0,0,4,WWbDoRv5kn3_a5uQ6Ni-8g
5745865,2012-11-14,1,ZPwx7ktiVluGFVg0L05n5A,"Argentina..the land of the beef , good soccer and the home of the super hot Italian looking girls that have that latino flavor. Yes..you can say Im a big fan of their country, food and of course woman,

This spot is legit. Owned, managed and operated by argentinians. Nice people, very personable and super sweet. From the guy behind the counter , to the lady in the cashier this place rocks. And their service is great as well. You are welcomed fast, serviced faster and catered the same way.

Their steak sandwich is to die for, and if you never tried morcila(blood sausage) this is the place to do it. If argentinians have mastered something , is soccer and BBQ. This guys can cook the steak, sausage , etc so perfect that its an orgasmic experience. Trust me ..try it. Go all out on the cow!

If you don't feel like a whole big meal, you can order sandwiches and also empanadas . Both of them OWN. They packed them with meat so you get a lot of flavor from every bite. Try a ""triple de miga"" or an ""empanada de carne""

You like garlic? You like oil? Like flavor? Add TONS of chimichurri to whatever you are eating. Don't get the fancy packed one..ask them about their home made chimichurri .I tell people that God came down on the 8th day and created chimichurri . That's how good it is .There not a single person that have tried it that didn't like it. Mix it with everything, most likely you will get addicted

On the right side of the place there are a couple counters and refrigerators where you can buy sodas, and products from southamerican countries. Don't expect a huge selection, but more of the ""top 3"" from each country. Pretty convenient if you want to take some stuff home.

I like this place and its one of its kind. Good people, central location,good food, good service and good prices .If you want to experience the whole thing..try to go when argentina is playing an important soccer game, or a night where they are playing tango. You will enjoy it .",G_bJdUPCnL1x6dvRhyHNyw,4,3,5,WBxfcsbO_EQbOSVqRBuWIQ
5767539,2010-08-17,2,ZPwx7ktiVluGFVg0L05n5A,"I first reviewed Rincon when I'd just moved from the East coast.  Being of a carnivorous nature, I continue to go at least once a month to get my meat fix.  Rincon continues to deliver the juiciest, most flavorful steaks.  Their empanadas (pastry stuffed with beef, chicken or spinach) are heavenly, I even pick up a few packages of the pastry discs needed to make some at home.  I'd make my own chimichurri, but why bother?  You can pick up a jar to take with you.  They make it there, and I doubt it could taste any better anywhere else.  And if dulce de leche (creme caramel) is your thing, try some of the fresh ALFAJORES, shortbread cookie sandwiches held together by dulce de leche, then rolled in shaved coconut... hmmm... may have to take a drive today...",btUugfufQAe-QD6gC_Ckmw,2,1,5,4uX26tnjh2CsQxuYeof9gA

I tried a selection of empanadas:

Tradicional - Steak, onion, bell pepper, and spices. This is a good start
Carne Picante - A little bit of heat but not super spicy, it was a nice addition to the beef
Gaucho - Probably my favorite one as the raisins add a touch of sweetness 
Pollo picante - Spicy chicken; like the carne picante, it has a touch of heat
Pollo de chorizo - Probably my second favorite.
