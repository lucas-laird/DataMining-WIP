Ordered the Gen Tso's Chicken, usually a safe bet anywhere.  Not so much tonight. I requested extra spicy.  What arrived was a plateful of overcook and very hard bits of chicken that has no spice and no flavor.

The only exception was the egg rolls, which were pretty good. Tasted like you found really good egg rolls in a supermarket and then fried them at home.

I enjoyed the Orange Chicken and my friend had the Chicken Chow Mein.  Both dishes were big (enough to split) and very good.  We both had enough to take home for lunch tomorrow.  Each dish came with Egg Roll, fried wonton, vegetable fried rice and the choice of salad bar or Egg Drop Soup.  You can not beat the prices $6.50 each.  Also, we were in and out in less then an hour.

Anyways, the place was not busy. I placed an order for pancit and Mongolian beef... It took forever!!! 35 mins was unnecessary. Would I come back? No. This was my first visit.

Pancit was less than ok. It lacks flavor and veggies.
The Mongolian beef was the worst we've ever had, anywhere. The taste was very off... The texture was extremely rubbery. All I could taste was the loaded sauce, which btw, spilled in the bag. I've had this dish at different places, made different at each location. This ranks last place.

I ordered 2 Orange Chicken lunch specials (Fried Rice, Egg roll, and Orange Chicken and a side order of Crab Ragoons. I was told the delivery would be about an hour which I thought was a little steep but it is Chinese/Filipino afterall. (Quality takes longer) 

The delivery man came at about 50 minutes which was sooner then the estimated time and he was very cordial and friendly! (One of the nicest I've had in a while, even called me by name through out conversation.) He was asking me for prices on some of my units (Storage facility) and telling me what he's paying now is too much. Needless to say he has excellent customer service and I'm sorry I didn't get his name. 

Alas, the food. The fried rice is uh-mazing! It's so great I couldn't even spell a-mazing correctly! The egg roll has more of a spring roll and was packed with all the right veggies, it was a little heavy on the garlic - imo. (But still very good). The Crab ragoons are good as well. I'll admit I was a little scared because they weren't shaped like others but as they say looks can be deceiving. For the grand finale, I always save the best for last was the orange chicken, sadly, I was let down. The breading on the chicken was not crispy (as the menu dictates) and the sauce doesn't have much flavor. This is the only reason why I gave 4 out of 5 stars because the main entree was not great. I will state, however, that I'll definitely be back to try out more items on their menu especially now that I see they have lumpia!",MBGgO5duKWHdmQMDN-z8-Q,16,0,4,ZaL91dIwJBVN5__CR4iaMw

The egg flour soup is mediocre at best, i've definitely had better. The service isn't great but it isn't awful either, they could be a bit more attentive. They were good about getting our order taken quickly and the food came out in a timely manner. but once we were served our main dish we didn't see the staff again for a little while.

Tender chicken, good flavor- the only thing negative I could say is that it wasn't very warm.  I tried some of the beef and it was very flavorful, tender, and the assorted veggies on that plate were crisp .  We had pot sticker dumplings and egg drop soup as well and both were good.

I went by the store to inquire about the process and they had no idea it was or could be a problem. That being said if you order from these business Neanderthals do not give them your credit  card information.

On Saturday afternoon, after moving all day long, we decided that we didn't want to cook, so we ordered Chinese for delivery!

First and foremost:  the lady on the phone was SUPER nice.  She was polite, repeated my order back, and gave me more info on some of the dishes I was unsure about.   They offer a military discount (being so close to the base), which was nice, since my fella is a veteran.  

The food arrived very promptly.  We were told about an hour, and it was just a bit under that time frame.  

The delivery man was also very nice, very polite.  

As far as the food goes, it was ok!!  Its really difficult to find REALLY good Chinese food in town. We ordered:
Egg Rolls:  Not really egg rolls.  The were spring rolls.  While they were tasty, the inside was a bit mushy, which is something we've seen pretty commonly out here. 
Imperial Egg Rolls:  GREASY.  But really delicious!  These are enormous egg rolls with chicken, pork, and shrimp inside.  The meat was cooked and seasoned well, but there were no veggies, and they dripped grease.  Still damned tasty!
Crab Rangoon:  REALLY good.   Really really.  Plenty of filling, and the wonton part was nice and crispy. 

Mongolian beef:  The website said ""hot"" and they weren't kidding, which was a little off putting with Mongolian beef.  The beef itself was tender, and delicious, but this was too spicy for me.  Fella commented that the sauce was a little runny, and there were way too many onions.  

Almond chicken:  One word:  YUM.  This was spot on.  Tender delicious chicken.  Baby corns, green celery, flavorful sauce...this was excellent.  We'd order from here again JUST for this.  

All in all, as first experiences go, this was a good one!  I can't wait to try out more items from the menu.

Cons..
1) the food wasn't great at all, so although I got a lot of it, most of it will be wasted.
2) took an hour and 15 minutes for the food to arrive.
