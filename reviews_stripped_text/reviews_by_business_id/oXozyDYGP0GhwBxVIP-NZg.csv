My husband and I have eaten here several times and I think today is our last. The food ALWAYS takes forever, and today they served two tables before us when they ordered after! Our paninis were overcooked and the soup was cold. I tried a different sandwich than usual, the Italian, and was disappointed. The sauce didn't really mesh well with the rest of the sandwich and the meat tasted more like hot dog. The Bandito is normally pretty good, when it is on the correct bread...My husband had it today and for some reason, they put it on the ciabatta instead of the focaccia today. Not so good.

Another negative, the tables are always dirty!

There are better places to go for soups, salads and sandwiches.",_y0ZtfzxyM6a59ESMzrHkA,0,0,2,s6ed_yVbBDZ2sqxQM_fZDg

I love the sausalito bandito panini. It has turkey, pepper jack cheese, sundried tomatoes, and roasted red peppers. My fave! I haven't tried any of the others because well, I really like this one. Their sandwiches and subs, don't sound too appetizing to me.

I usually get the twiced baked potato soup, which I find very delish. Its really thick somewhat cheesy. I've been wanting to try the seafood bisque but its always sold out when I go! =(

It comes with a spicy pickle (ha!) which I very much look forward to getting. It has spices on it, I think there are even corriander seeds on it too. It compliments the meal very well.

Service here is usually quick. Staff is friendly. No complaints there. Although Panera Bread has better quality food, I still like Spicy Pickle because their combo is a little more affordable.

Bandido something pannini - gosh... go easy on that mayo. It's not a bad pannini but it is overloaded with mayo. Hopefully someone in a corporate office is reading yelp.

Greek salad - meh... it's a salad... and it has feta cheese in it so I guess it's enough to be called greek.

The first time Groupon decided to work on its site when I wanted to pull up my Groupon on my phone so I couldn't use it and had already ordered so ended up paying full price. Not a happy camper.

 It has good food and a nice seating area, but it is a little overpriced for such small portions. The paninis are on a big piece of bread but have the smallest amount of contents! The soup was good but not anything I would make a special visit here for. The Greek salad was also good but lacked on toppings. Everything is very fresh, which they charge you for, but you don't get much of it. My pizza crust was literally BLACK from being burned so bad. Sadly I did take out on my that visit and did not realize it until I got home. Needless to say I threw half of my $10 mini pizza away.

Staff is usually very friendly. I bonded with Miranda particularly because it's rare to find another Miranda in Vegas. Sirius XM's The Blend will fill your ears as you order a signature panini or sandwich...or do what my man does and spend 5 minutes contemplating ingredients and creating your own. The selection of meats, sauces, and cheeses they have aren't fully represented in their signature recommendations. There's a lot more in the kitchen than meets the eye.

I've enjoyed the Yard Bird the most. The Brooklyn secures second place. Whoever made my Bandido put two handfuls too many of red peppers on it. Not my style. Atkins diet beware! My sandwiches are often way too bready. Plus, you get a slice of bread with your soup. Too much bread at times.

The Spinach Salad is a great contrast if you want the potato soup without a carb overload. The apple, walnut, bleu cheese, and vinaigrette cuts through the creamy soup and has you going back for one and then the other alternately.

We used to go there more often when we lived closer but we made our trek to their establishment.   Some sandwich shop really don't give alot of choices for pescatarians but Spicy Pickle has a few more choices.  They have what they call the Dilly-o meal which is half a sandwich and a side salad or soup.  This allows you to try two things at the same time.  I ordered the Sinker (tuna sandwich) and a cup of their double baked potato soup.   My partner ordered the Garden State (portabello and other veggies) and a side of tuna salad.  I love the way they prepare the tuna.  It is somewhat tinged with spice.  Their breads are fresh and not the typical torpedo or sliced bread but ciabattas and paninis.  We enjoyed our meal as always.  I wish they get more customers because I never see it packed.

We split a med sandwich and Sonoma pizzetti.

The sandwich had roasted chicken, lettuce, tomatoes, red onions, kalamata olives, cucumbers, pepperoncini peppers and feta, drizzled with Greek dressing. It was okay but not as good as I was hoping. It came with a pickle that was only spicy pickle. I was hoping for a more distinct pickle given the name of the joint but whatever.

The pizzetti had grilled chicken, fresh mozzarella, sun-dried tomatoes, fresh rosemary, mozzarella and tomato sauce. The sauce was a little sweeter than I like and the chicken was flavorless. However, the crust was really good. It was perfectly thin and crispy.

Overall, I'd give Spicy Pickle a 2.5. I'm rounding up as I really liked the pizzetti crust. We'll be back at least once more as I've got one more Groupon.",wc4XAA5pC3b1UgooSypHwA,4,0,3,D0rUDW6T7sDf6en5jFallQ

My husband's was OK, though he was upset that the ice tea machine was dispensing water rather than tea.  My sandwich had more horseradish than beef.  The beef that was there was subpar.  Both of us had hardly enough meat to see, much less taste.  If you want a sandwich where you can see the meat, go to Smith's deli.  Why weren't we there ourselves?

This sandwich is like a slaw-be-jo (roast beef, Russian dressing, coleslaw) from Capriottis but on their ciabatta bread. This was by far the best bite we had that night. 

I ordered some sort of Italian sandwich with mortadella and salami but something about it made it bland and  strange tasting. The peppercinis are nice but their roasted red peppers were mushy and gross. We ordered a kid's pizzetti which is just a pizza on thin flat bread. This was nothing special. 

When I used to frequent this place, I'd order the Greek salad with salami but it's close to $9 and way too easy to make at home.

It definitely feels more satisfying, healthy, and pricey than your typical fast food burger joint, but not as creative or filling as something like Capriotti's.  

Between two of us we had the Bastille panini, large greek salad, and large chicken chili.  We thought all were quite flavorful, good combinations of ingredients.  The Bastille contains portabello, roasted red peppers, onions, tomatoes, alfalfa sprouts, and mozzarella.  Good stuff, and a good sized sandwich (filling, but not too much, don't expect leftovers).  The Greek salad and soup were tasty, but both were quite small for ""large"" sizes.  The soup was maybe 8 oz, one cup, which is actually pretty small as far as I'm concerned, especially for nearly $5.

After looking over the menu at the counter, my mom ordered the Santorini Pizzetti (An individual 11""  really thin/cracker crust pizza, also referred to as Neopolitan-style, covered in a thin layer of tomato sauce, mozzarella, feta, oregano, green peppers, sun-dried tomatoes, artichoke hearts, and kalamata olives, and then drizzled with extra virgin olive oil. I ordered the Garden State sandwich, which comprised of Portobello mushrooms (grilled I assume), tomatoes, red onions, roasted red peppers, spinach, and fresh mozzarella, drizzled with honey-balsamic vinaigrette, and layered between a ciabatta roll. I also ordered a small cup of Redrock Seafood Bisque, which came with a side of bread. 

After ordering and paying, we sat down at a booth and waited a few minutes before our food arrived. Immediately after tasting the soup, my mom said it was not hot enough, so I asked the cashier if she could tell the cooks to make the soup hotter, which she apologized for and took back. While waiting for the soup, my mom and I began eating our food. My mom enjoyed her Pizzetti, and I thought my sandwich was delicious. The veggies and mozzarella inside my sandwich tasted fresh, and every ingredient worked together, resulting in a healthy and mild-flavored sandwich. The ciabatta itself was perfect- the right amount of soft, the right amount of chewy, and the right amount of crusty crust. The complimentary pickle was okay, nothing extraordinary. 

After a few minutes of eating our food, the server came back with the soup and warned us that it was hot. Good thing she warned us because the soup was very hot, but oh so delicious. Creamy soup with chunks of seafood. Perfect on its own or with bread. For $3.29, it's a good deal. Overall, we enjoyed our food. I will be back.",PspDTd6CrF1aUtdC_k73-w,5,2,4,EZgW09smdhD2qDXV-P6vBw

We do a build your own with roasted chicken, mayo, mustard, lettuce, cucumbers and that works for us. We also like the Wise Guys and the Bronx. The cookies are pretty good too. They are baked fresh in their store. I can't say much about the soup because its 100+ degrees in the summer, so I haven't tried it. 
The pick-a-dilly-yo is a good lunch special. Half Sand. w soup or salad. I've had the Caesar salad and its so-so.

Spicy Pickle is a franchise, so their menu's are the same but the sandwiches will vary in taste depending on their  demographics and where they get their vegetables from. The desserts are also different depending on their owner.   

They also do catering. Not sure on pricing...go check their website.",jR00ESlM7Rmg9tFYwMbh4A,0,0,4,UnDTcnGKR6s3hVjJE9yPOQ

This time I tried the ""Brooklyn"" which had Turkey Pastrami, Swiss, Coleslaw, and Thousand Island dressing on rye. It was a panini. It also came with a side of macaroni salad.

The sandwich as very tasty. The Coleslaw was crunchy and fresh. The Thousand Island dressing added a nice touch and they weren't shy on it which I liked since I like extra dressing on anything.

The macaroni salad was unlike any other I ever had. It maybe had an Italian dressing on it? I'm not sure but it was fresh and tasty. There were crunchy fresh pieces of celery and onion in it. 

I had my own drink so the meal cost $7.56. I was yet again very pleased and will for sure be back! I think I will try their flat bread pizza next!",Fv0e9RIV9jw5TX3ctA1WbA,7,5,5,qaNpOBQAMMsog2KLzgVGLg

I ordered the Wise Guys Sub (Capocolla, Mortadella, Hard Salami, Lettuce, Tomatoes, Roasted Red Peppers, Pepperoncini Peppers, Provolone, and Basil Mayo) on Ciabatta Bread $6.99, a bag of Jalapeno Chips $.80, and a Bottle of Water $1.99.

The food came out within a few minutes.  The size of the Sandwich was just right....not too big and not too small.  I eagerly took a bite and was impressed with the flavor that the Roasted Red Peppers brought to the Sandwich.  I've had a lot of Italian Sandwiches and have never had one with Roasted Red Peppers.....additionally, the Basil Mayo added another element to the Sub which made it very good.  The proportion of Meat and toppings was very good.

The only complaint is that with all of that wet stuff in the Sandwich, the ingredients were sliding off the Bread and it took some work to keep it all together.  I didn't dock them any stars for that....it's more of a preference thing.

Of course the Sandwich came with a Spicy Pickle.....which I didn't think was too Spicy at all.....nice flavor though.  Would have enjoyed a really Spicy Pickle.....was hoping for one.

I was so disappointed when I went to the beverage bar and it was gone and has been replaced with a multi tea dispenser thats cartridge based.

It was OK, but the beef was cold which I wasn't expecting or I would have had veggies added to it.

I went with the half sandwich + soup combo. I let one of my friends use up the remainder of my Groupon. On a recommendation from another friend, I chose the Yard Bird and paired it up with the Seafood Bisque. I quite enjoyed the bisque. It wasn't too salty and was pretty flavorful. The sandwich was decent. It started off slightly blah, but then half way through, I reached the section that had all of the cubes of apple and the piece of bacon. That part of the sandwich was delicious and ended the meal on a high note. As for the pickle, it wasn't in-your-face spicy, but I consider that a good thing.

Finally got to try this place out since we were in the area.  Atmosphere is real nice.  Clean and I liked the colors inside.  I was actually expecting much less for the inside of this place.  The workers were real  nice and service was quick.

I got the Bandido panini - mostly because I liked the name of the sandwich and couldn't decide what else to get.  It was pretty good!  Lots of turkey, nicely toasted with that little crunch.  Loved the roasted red peppers and sundried tomatoes in it and pepper jack cheese gives its a kick!  For an dollar extra, I got some pasta salad on the side.  I thought that was sort of bland and could use some extra flavor.  Nothing really too fancy there!

My husband got the Wise Guy because he has a love for Italian sandwiches.  It was pretty mediocre.  ""Better than a Subway sandwich"" was what I thought when i bit into it.  There was way too much bread so the meat got a little lost (insert ""thats what she said"" here).  I did appreciate that they included quality Italian meats like capicola in it... but the entire time he was wishing that he got a panini instead :)

The counter service was pleasant and our food came out quickly. The meal itself was filling, but was not too much to make us sluggish. My Wise Guy came with capicola, mortadella, hard salami, provolone cheese, EVOO basil mayo, roasted red peppers, pepperoncini peppers, red onions, lettuce and tomato served on Ciabatta. The bread was thick and chewy without being tough. I like that they do not slather the sandwich in mayo either. I was debating on leaving it out, but was worried it would be too dry. My decision to let it be did not end with regrets and I am grateful for it. Add a dollar for a side salad and it becomes a nice meal. I am not a fan of their vinaigrette.

She didn't even acknowledge us. She just stood there talking for a good 5-7 minutes then said, ""Oh, sorry. Can I take your order."" Ugh. I think she was talking to another customer on the phone, but somebody else should have ran POS at that point.

 I got the Spinach Salad (large - $6.29) and my sister got the El Rancho Salad (Large - $6.99) We each got a fountain drink because I saw they have a soda water tab, which is always cheaper than Pelligrino. 

I'm not sure what a small looks like, but I can't imagine it would be any large than a cup. The large salad is not filling whatsoever, which is why I suspect it's served with a sourdough roll. My salad was topped with blue cheese and apples and some sort of vinagrette. Sadly, it was very bland, because there wasn't much cheese and the dressing tasted like straight canola. My sister said her salad was okay, but that it was too small, especially for the $18 she spent for our meal. 

I found it odd that most of the lights were turned off, so it was pretty dark inside. I can understand if they keep most of the lights off when no customers are in there, but when there's 3 to 4 tables filled, the lights should all be on. It made it feel cold, especially because it was already getting darker outside.
