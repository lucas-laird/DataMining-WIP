My usual is a ham and cheese croissant, OJ and coffee.  But what ho?  Those cinnamon rolls look awfully good... with a thick shmear of buttery, sugary goodness slathered on top.  And maybe a crepe?  A Nutella crepe?  Yeah I think maybe so... just to warm up the old boiler... hey is that gelato?  Dulce de leche gelato?  well maybe just a small scoop.  No small scoops?  Okay, pile it on there, ma'am!  Wow is that gelato good.  So rich...  So sweet...  So right next to all those pastries.  Do I dare compound my gluttony with a pastry?  I suppose I should man up or or Chef Maury, possessed of his ""Meilleur Ouvrier"" tricolor collar will accuse me of being a ""leetle bit girly, avec un appetit comme une oiseau""  Well that freakin' tears it, chef.  Gimme a black forest ham and gruyere crepe and a chocolate eclair, a blueberry danish and another latte.  And maybe some of the carrot cake with the decadent frosting and why not a couple of boxes of chocolate orange cookies and a bag of the marshmallows in assorted flavors to eat in the ambulance on my way to the hospital.  EMTs gotta eat too, right?  They might have to pry the confections from my cold dead hands, but given enough time at Jean Philippe a more likely scenario may never emerge.

I will say this.  If you have anything resembling a sweet tooth and you visit Las Vegas without making a pilgrimage to Patisserie Jean Philippe, God doesn't have enough lightning bolts with which to strike you down.  You have been warned.",yDbtyjFQKhqLhCFjfqQ08A,1,2,5,wETewHz9FdkPINfMThkEBg

Definitely try the savory crepes - they're huge and could easily feed two people.  They also have hot and cold sandwiches and quiche which have garnered good reviews, but would try a crepe over these.

They also have a yummy almond croissant - buttery, flaky, and full of almond, although much larger than a normal croissant...this could also easily feed two people at least.

There is a chocolate fountain that was drawing a lot of attention a la Willie Wonka ... Many tourists and kids gaping and snapping pics, but was personally not overly impressed and more nauseated (and I do love chocolate).

Drawbacks: extremely long wait during peak hours or holidays.  Wait was more than 1 hr just to order.  Also, the line was awkwardly wrapping around the crepe station, where gawkers were also gathered to watch the crepe making.",pGsGlhLYObmvUGrjlyqVow,2,1,4,3H_jsXmFdWYfztXsUFxOzA

153617,2013-09-01,0,UUGoM4q4i8rK2CBRS0xDAw,"Jean-Philippe Pâtisserie is a European-style pastry shop, located inside the Bellagio, just steps away from the Bellagio Conservatory (see blog post here). The mastermind behind Jean-Philippe Pâtisserie is Chef Jean Philippe Maury, an award winning French pastry chef who grew up in the South of France. Did I mention that he is the Executive Pastry Chef at the AAA Five Diamond Bellagio? I thought I should slip the ""AAA Five Diamond"" part in front of ""Bellagio"" to emphasize my point. ;) Am I the only one who thinks this is impressive?

Jean-Philippe Pâtisserie has two locations on the Las Vegas Strip, one inside the Bellagio and one inside Aria Hotel. I have been to both locations, but only purchased desserts from the one located in Bellagio. All the pastries are made daily at his kitchen inside Aria, and delivered to the Bellagio.

Walking into Jean-Philippe Pâtisserie is breath taking, the interior decor is nothing short of gorgeous. What first catches your eyes is the life-size mannequin on a pedestal, wearing a dress fashioned out of chocolate, then your eyes wanders scans the interior of the pastry shop, where you'll see shelves full of chocolates and confections, even a wedding cake or two, then you look towards the entrance, where you will see a multi-tier chocolate fountain, supposedly the largest chocolate fountain in the world. Lastly, you enter the pastry shop, look towards the display cases located in the centre of the pastry shop... where you will find pastries and a large variety of desserts, beautifully crafted, and you know it is time to let your inner glutton out.

I tried three dessert items: Raspberry Tart, Nutella Napoleon and Opera. The Nutella Napoleon consists of caramelized chocolate puff pastry, topped with chocolate creme brulee and chocolate mousse. The Opera is made of almond coffee butter cream and chocolate ganache. Lastly, the Raspberry Tart...  starts out with almond shortbread tart at the bottom, topped with pistachio cream, raspberry cream and stunning fresh raspberries. All three of these desserts were incredibly delicious and rich. The taste absolutely lives up to their appearance, if not exceeding it.

Honestly, I need stop writing and let the photos do the talking, come to my blog to check them out! ;)

Chocolate Croissant - WOW! Flaky, great consistency, just enough chocolate and just freaking awesome.  I easily could eat half a dozen of these

Almond Croissant - Again, flaky outside, almond filling was just enough and not too sweet which makes it really good

Dulce de leche brioche - The brioche is the best I've ever had, ever.  The consistency and texture were perfect to me.  The filling was a tad too much, as far as how much they injected in. It's still good as it's not too sweet

Sticky bun - I'll repeat myself, delicious!  Not my favorite of the bunch, but still very good.

At first, I thought it would be chocolate overload. Boy, was I wrong. The first bite, I was in dessert heaven. If it were not so damn expensive ($9), I would have definitely bought another one.

My friend and I tried other things on the menu. Creme brulee gelato was too sweet. Tiramisu ice cream, on the other hand, was fantastic. Both scoops on a waffle cone cost a whopping $10. Ugh! We also had the nutella brioche. From afar, it looked yummy. The name itself drew us in. Unfortunately, it was not up to par with the awesome souffle crepe we ate a minute earlier. Tried their white chocolate bars as well. The secret ingredient must be crack because I kept chomping on it while we walked back to the hotel.  

The place is a spectacle. If you cannot dish the $$$$, at least go there to take picture of the world's largest chocolate fountain. Makes you think of Willy Wonka and the chocolate factory. They also have ornate cake creations displayed in glass cases.

So... it was about 9:30pm and I was going to head back to my room but I decided to venture over to Jean Philippe for a late dessert.  I hop in-line with no clue what I really want.  Should I get the caramel filled muffin that looks so delicious, the chocolate croissant that I know I love, or should I try something new?  I opt for trying something new and though I don't tend to like scones, I gave the vanilla glazed scone a try... I figured if it was bad then I would save some calories.

Upon the first bite of my scone, I knew this is what heaven would take like if it was a food.  The scone was dense but not too dense and it was moist and not dry or crumbly like many of the more commercially purchased scones can get.  The vanilla flavor was powerful but in a very welcome and appreciated way.  I think I could have eaten 5 in one sitting, lucky for my waistline, I didn't have that many.

It is convenient to the elevators to the rooms. Sign says line starts on the right but to order crepes and omelets it is on the left before the cashier. There is usually a line of people waiting to get bakery items and chocolates on the right so you can bypass them if you just want to order an omelet. Had the ham and cheese omelet and coffee that came to around $16. Omelet I think was around $13 and $3 for the coffee. They make to order and you can actually see them making your omelette or crepe. The omelet was large and plenty for breakfast. Not sure how many eggs were in there and they seemed to have the eggs, ham and cheese preprepared in this plastic cup  and they just pour the contents on the grill. I would guess it would be equivalent to a three egg omelet. Eating there was much faster than going to the buffet but keep in mind the breakfast buffet is $19 so still the better deal. But it you don't want to do all your breakfast at the buffet this is a good option. The coffee as you would expect is French roast.

I got the chocolate crepe, which was delicious and very pretty. Props to the crepe maker, who was working very hard and turning out perfect crepes each time. Right before I left for the airport I returned to get an almond croissant, because they have marzipan inside, but I wasn't impressed with that. I think the butter of the croissant gives the marzipan a greasier-than-usual texture-- no thanks. Might be better fresh, but not to pick up and eat later. Their coffee is good.

A lot of people have criticized this place for the service. I would describe the service here as ""efficient."" There is a constant line and they are trying to move it quickly.

Last I checked, two large jars of nutella cost $7.39 at your local warehouse store.

A nutella brioche at JPP costs $4. I believe that is inclusive of tax, but I'm not certain.

You don't really come to JPP for value. You come to eat delicious baked goods.

Jean Phillippe was one of my stops when a friend and I did our ""macaron challenge"" during our last trip to Vegas.  So, my review is really only for the rose macaron, which is the only thing that we ordered.  There were other pre-packaged macarons there, but we wanted the pretty one behind the window.  The only one they had was a rose macaron.  It was huge and was really pretty..almost too pretty to eat.  Unfortunately, Jean Philippe's rose macaron did not fare too well against the macarons we had from other patisseries along the strip.  It's probably not a good comparison though because it's ROSE flavored.  Duh...it tasted like rose.  I know some people love it, but I don't really like my pastries tasting like lotion, which is exactly what it tasted like.

This place is sweet tooth heaven(given, they have items for the not so sweet fanatic)! Everything, and I mean everything is delicious. Most of the pastries are 6.50 and up. But its well worth every penny because its never a miss. No disappointment yet!
The fruits they use are always sweet, not too much fruit or too little. Also not too much of the crust or fillings in the selections.

There always seems to be a crowd oohing and aahing over the flowing chocolate display, which is indeed quite mesmerizing.  I know I spent a good minute or so just staring at all the cascading chocolate and wondering how exactly the whole system worked.

In any case, the chocolate waterfall is what draws you in, but its the gelato, crepes, and pastries that make you stay.  We got some gelato- the pistachio and the banana.  The pistachio was just okay- they had whole nuts in the gelato, but they were a little stale and rubbery.  The banana, though, was amazing- full of rich, banana flavor with little chunks of banana and caramel.  All in all, the banana was, as they say, the bomb.  At $4.75 for one scoop and 75 cents additional for another flavor, the gelato was a tad pricey but not as bad as the gelato store in the Forum stores, which charged $6 for a small and $13 for a large (!).

We also decided to get some of the pastries, which looked more like miniature works of art than little cakes.  We decided to get the Imperial, which was some kind of insanely good chocolate cake with chocolate mousse, topped with a chocolate crisp, and covered with chocolate ganache.  The exact ingredients elude me, but they all added together to make heaven on earth.  

Because of my obsession with carrot cake, we also got their version, which featured a coconut/pineapple cream cheese frosting.  I couldn't really taste the tropical flavor, but it was still a delicious cake.  The cake was very moist and not overly sweet.  Decoratively, the cake was beautiful, featuring a ruffled white chocolate fan with orange accents, a little marzipan carrot and gold foil.    

What adds additional points in my book is that they offer sugar-free pastries as well.  When we were there, they offered three choices- a fruit tart, a raspberry napoleon, and a chocolate cake of some sort.  We decided on the fruit tart, which looked beautiful, with delicately sliced and arranged fruit.  I'm not sure how it tasted, since my dad and uncle were the ones who ate it.

Overall, a patisserie that features delicious baked goods, as well as chocolates.  While we were there, the man himself, Jean Philippe, showed up and walked through the cafe to the back!  Very cool.  I didn't get a chance to try the crepes, since we were full from the gelato and pastries, but those will be up the next time I'm back.

We wanted good dessert after our meal at Lago and found this place online with good reviews and photos of mini cakes - obviously, we got really excited! After waiting in line for about 10-15 minutes, it was our turn to order and we got two mini cakes and two pastries: raspberry intense cake, opera, blueberry tart-like pastry, and the raspberry jelly filled donut. (Their coffee is just made from a machine, so we decided to go somewhere else for coffee!)

The raspberry intense cake was really underwhelming - it had more of a chocolate taste and not enough raspberry flavors. It had a type of chocolate mouse with a hint of tiramisu styled bread on the insides (but not soggy, which was great!), which wasn't what we were expecting from it's name. The opera was good, but I'm not sure I'd order it again as it was too heavy for me - chocolate-wise, not the texture. This one made me really thirsty! The blueberry tart-like pastry was really great - we ate this a day after and it was still good, so I assume that if you eat it fresh then it's even better! The jelly filled donut was delicious as well, with good quality filling and slightly sweet and sour sugar as coating. I am not a fan of jelly filled donuts, but this one did the trick!

The place isn't that easily located as it's within a hallway towards the end of the hotel (google map it!). All in all, it was a pretty good dessert spot (with some waiting and not enough tables/seats on the inside nor the immediate outer surroundings as it's a popular store), but as with anything else in Vegas, we felt that it was over-priced. The total was around $28 for the 4 pieces! Not a huge deduct for that though, because everything in Vegas is over-priced - half of the desserts that we had made up for this, hence the four star. I'd probably go again (only if I were near it) for the pastries, but not so sure about the mini cakes anymore. Who am I kidding - I'll still probably try a different mini cake too if I'm there again!

Croissant and Chocolate Croissant - both very flaky and buttery.  The chocolate had great bittersweet chocolate nestled in the middle.  I think they were the best croissants I have ever eaten.  

Chicken Cobb Salad:  Very fresh produce, shredded crisp lettuce, with perfectly poached chicken breast (very tender and moist).

Sables:  Yummy buttery cookies that are mild in sweetness and have a sandy texture.  Very addictive and roughly a dollar a piece.  They sell in packs of 10 and a tube of 20.  

Fruit salad - consisted of mixed berries, cantaloupe, honeydew and pineapple.  Everything was sweet, fresh and neatly cubed (melons).  I was very content while eating this on the plane and had some jealous onlookers.  

The sandwiches looked very tasty too, but I was really craving a salad for lunch.  

Warning: Go early or they will sell out!!  I went back at 5 to pick up some dinner for the flight and boo, almost everything was gone.",5gxSTruo_3igbGgENZ38UQ,1,0,5,8s4PtQTjDdIPoIC3G2xCxQ

Bf discovered that the window it's behind is made up or multiple panes with gaps in between.  Needless to say, we looked strange sniffing the choclate decadence through the gaps.  Hahahah.

Crepe: got the nutella with strawberries.  Omg so good!  They were generous witht the nutella, the crepe was perfectly thin and they gave a generous dollop of fluffy whipped cream.  So yummy!

Brioche -nutella and dulce de leche: to die for.  Will be aure to get some before i go home.  So much nutella dn dulce de leche in both.  Wish i extra bread, that's how much filling there was! 

Roast beef sandwich: bf claims was delicious.  Disappeared down his gullet before i could take a nibble.  I guess that says smthg?

Hot caprese panini: pretty good.  The sauce (pesto?) Was superb.  Bread nice and crispy on the outside, soft on the inside.  Just the right amt of tomatoes ... didn't taste any basil ... and the mozarella was a little too chewy for my tastes but i did like how it stretched.

The almond brioche and croissants were especially pleasing, given the copious quantities of almonds and almond paste/marzipan, which I love.  The croissant was flaky and not rubbery, much better than what you'd get at typical bakeries or grocery store pastry counters.

And it was under $5 for a cup with two scoops of gelato, definitely a bargain compared to the other gelato shops in Vegas!   The crepes here are also delicious, but they are a tad expensive, about $10 if I remember correctly.   They also have a large selection of pastries, which are excellent.  My favorite is their chocolate croissants, it's loaded with chocolate, but it isn't overly sweet!  The butterfly cookies are also excellent.  I have tried their chocolates, which I cannot complain about.  They recently came out with a fruit jelly chocolate, which comes in a pack of 6.  These are excellent fruit chocolates and I would recommend them as a substitute to the regular chocolate truffles.   The prices for pastries and gelato and very reasonable and they taste great.

There are individual desserts at a few restaurants that will challenge Jean Philippe, but not many. If you don't want to waste your calories on low quality, this is the place for your sugar fix. 

The crepes are excellent. Okay, the crepe is just a crepe, but the toppings are transcendent. I tried the apple crepe. Apples, grape, and pecans swimming in a bath of cinnamon sugar. While incredibly rich, it actually seemed light and healthy. 

The gelato was rich and flavorful. The creme brûlée actually had brûlée texture mixed in. It was a perfect blend of flavors and pure delight. The pistachio was also well made and one of the best I've had. 

The pastries may not be as strong. Perhaps that is why they are in the back. I tried the Napoleon and was disappointed. The creme was fairly typical and the dough had an odd, bitter flavor (perhaps burnt). I was surprised and disappointed after the excellent quality of the other desserts. 

I have mixed opinions on the design of the store. The chocolate fountain was cool and it is fun to watch the crepe preparation.

Cheesecake - More of a mousse like dessert covered in a white chocolate shell. The chocolate shell was way too sweet. It might look great but the texture didn't compliment the cheesecake fillings either. 

Overall the desserts were just too sweet for my palate. I had trouble finishing them even though I have a sweet tooth.

Chocolate crepe is thicker & with firmer texture than what you'd get in Paris, which is what I prefer. Chocolate can be more flavorful and whipped cream isn't as rich or delish as European but American dairy contain less milk fat anyway... Solid crepe in conclusion.

I ended up not worrying about it because the line and process was just such a mess.

Anyway, all in all this place was very good. We ordered the savory Forest crepe which was delectable. And the Nutella crepe (no bananas) which was also very good. Note that the menus on the digital screen are slightly different than the menus set up around the bar. You actually can't order from the digital screen. So weird.

My friend ordered a regular croissant which was good but I would have preferred chocolate (which I was told by another friend was amazing). I ordered the raspberry filled doughnut which was BEYOND good. I would order it again 100 times.

There standing before me behind the glass is a fountain. Could it be the fountain of youth? I come closer and find something better, the nonstop flowing fountain of dark chocolate, milk chocolate and white chocolate. 

I'm easily distracted as something at the corner of my eye quickly grabs my attention. It that you, Jesus? Sadly, it wasn't but what I did see was a plethora of extraordinary mouthwatering desserts with an overwhelming variety.

Crepes, gelato, creme brûlée, fruit tart, sweet trio, imperial, vanilla eclair, tiramisu, triple chocolate cheesecake, white chocolate strawberries, chocolate croissants, cupcakes, cinnamon rolls and countless more. Every possible type of dessert I could think of was here in front of me. How does one even begin to choose?

So mesmerized by it all, I go with my first two choices, the Pecan sticky Bun and flan patisserie. The pecan sticky bun perfectly sweetened and soft with just the right amount of crispy pecans. Each bite is like a taste of heaven. The flan patisserie has an acquired texture and flavor that even leaves the taste buds confused. It lacks the flavor of what flan is suppose to taste like but still edible. I wasn't disappointed that the flan patisserie didn't blow me away since the sticky pecan bun had been so amazingly good.

Jean Philippe Patisserie is a dessert lovers dream come true. It's simply the definition of happiness ^_^",rKDLq635fyrmVzg4Gxkafg,56,54,4,OaVXzxVR1HBtK24X4RgF1A

I tried the berry sorbet, the Lemon Meringue Pie (LMP) and the Triple Chocolate Cake (TCC). I took these goodies to the Bellagio Water Show to enjoy while I watched the water performance. Perfect way to enjoy your evening is to listen to some music, enjoy some great goodies and watch a great performance.

Berry Sorbet = 3.5 out of 5 stars. Very tasty but having been to Rome and Florence, your tastebuds are majorly spoiled to the first touch of gelato. This sorbet was much creamier than the other sorbets I eat in Vancouver Canada, which I originally thought I was eating a sherbet (which milk content is added and makes it creamier) but not. 

LMP = this had marshmallow on the top that happened to be torched which I thought I'd like but that wasn't the case. I didn't end up finishing this as it didn't tickle my taste buds and I drove my spoon into my next dessert, the Triple Chocolate Cake.

First, there are two lines. We figured out that if you want to buy cafe food and drinks, you line up on the left. The line begins around the back and lead you to the register at the front. While you wait in line, you will pass many salads, sandwiches, and pastries. TIP: Take this time to figure out what you want!! You will not be able to see a menu until you reach the register. The drinks menu display is also awkwardly placed, so that you can only see it when you're on the opposite side of the bar. Once your in line, it's darn near impossible to read.

I ordered a $9 berry smoothie. Yes, it was NINE dollars. I was very thirsty. It was pretty tasty, but I'm still having a hard time justifying paying $9 for it. I also ordered a $4 Almond Brioche.

Each dish ($4.95) comes with 2 generous scoops (hallelujah!). The kids really liked the dark or white chocolate dipped cones.

Nothing like a great piece of chocolate croissant to start off the day... 
It's as big as your hand... flaky but not too greasy and also has a decent chunk of milk chocolate. I'm not sure how I ate it as quickly as I did...almost went back for seconds. 

Finished it off with some of their coffee blend... and I was set!
Hubby said it's a darker roast. 

I love their chocolate fountain... apparently it's the largest one in the world. So much stuff here (desserts, crepes, pastries, salads, sandwiches)...

On my most recent venture, it was over Christmas so they had the Grinch as their main decoration which was really well done!  Every time I passed by here, though, the lines were outrageous.  After Christmas Eve dinner, however, we chose to brave it and grab a crepe for dessert.

Apparently it's changed a bit since I visited NYE 2017.  There were 2 lines, but neither one was clearly identified as which was for gelato, crepes, bakery, coffee, etc.  So my step-dad and I chose the line that started around back.  Luckily, we chose correctly.  It was a bit of a wait, but the staff seemed to be moving at a great pace considering the crowd.  It was Christmas Eve, after all, I'm sure they would rather be at home.

Now, I don't consider myself a crepe connoisseur in the slightest.  But I have found that there are two ways people make crepes:  one with all the yummies added on the inside and the other with all the yummies on top.  I prefer the former, but Jean Philippe prefers the latter.  No matter, it was delicious nonetheless, if not overly pricey (like everything else in Vegas).  I mean personally, I've had better crepes from an all-you-can-eat Japanese buffet than this place AND the entire meal cost the same as ONE crepe.  But hey, like I said, it's Vegas.

The strawberry tart shell - subtracting the strawberries - was so sweet that even the tartness of strawberries could not offer any counter balance.   Too much sugar. 

The opera cake (it's a French dessert but try one in Vienna ...) is distinguished by a delicate balance of bitterness and sweetness between dark chocolate ganache and coffee buttercream.   The sugar content in this version left us no choice but to just leave it after one bite.

I've been to the Jean Philippe Patisserie in Aria a few times and I've definitely had a lot of good things there.  I've had a few average things there too, which feel even worse than they probably are given the high prices.  Service tends to be slow there as well and it stems from a lack of an organized setup and an inefficient use of the staff.

This Jean Philippe Patisserie in the Bellagio is the original Vegas location and it feels very similar.  Like the Aria location, they feature a wide variety of beautiful individual cakes and pastries.  There are also lunch options, crepes and many packaged goods for gifts and such.  I like the setup at this bakery more though.  It is located far from the casino while the Aria location is right in the casino.

I was only able to try the pain au chocolat, but it was good.  The pastry was flaky, crispy and buttery while the chocolate center was smooth and good.  There were many other nice looking items including a very appetizing looking brioche muffin-type pastry that might just rival the citrus pistachio brioche at Bouchon Bakery in Yountville.

Prices were high, but that is to be expected given that this bakery is located in Vegas and that it features very nicely presented pastries and desserts.

Like the Aria location, the service is very slow here.  Part of the slow service is caused by the long lines that this popular spot attracts.  Also, there seems to be a lot of indecisive customers, which is understandable given the wide variety of options you have here.  But the service does feel inefficient.  There seems to be a lot of staff, but the ordering and pickup process is not that smooth.  There were not enough registers open so even though they were taking orders quickly, the cashiers could not process the orders quick enough so the line really started to build.

Jean Philippe Patisserie is a great spot for breakfast pastries and their individual cakes also look good.  It might be one of the best shops in this part of The Strip for a sweet treat.  Unfortunately, the service (while pleasant) is very slow.  If that does not bother you or if you can come here during non-peak times, this Jean Philippe Patisserie in the Bellagio is worth a visit.

My last splurge was a grand total of $350.  I can honestly say it was worth every penny.  Okay, don't get scared - I bought a lot of pastries, chocolates, gifts, etc. Just to give you an estimate - prices are on average $3.50 for pastries, $10.00 paninis, $12.00 for clear packaged goodies, $30-70 for the very elegant boxed chocolates. 

My most favorite thing to eat at JP is their chocolate crepe. You can see it in my ""profile pic"" I hope. I love how delightful it is.  Their whip cream is so light and refreshing.  They have this special chocolate sauce they put on top with pieces of brownie drizzled with some chocolate flakes. Perfectionnn! They make the crepes right in front of you, which is kind of cool.

Key Lime Tart (5 stars) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/H8qpFitIesth86zqR4cwYg?select=uRjFKrymgjFdvSpVWGqh0g
Rose Macaron (4 stars) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/H8qpFitIesth86zqR4cwYg?select=Okeoz6p_hXzhQNJkp7UEPw
Coconut Gelato (5 stars-Best Coco gelato ever) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/H8qpFitIesth86zqR4cwYg?select=CdlqoKs7fw1gWvtZzZSLfg
White & Milk Chocolate Covered Strawberries (5 stars) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/H8qpFitIesth86zqR4cwYg?select=qcyB1tF3R-Lf8dO3mIVzdQ
Nutella Brioche (4 stars) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/H8qpFitIesth86zqR4cwYg?select=XEVABDOk1fHwdNozXC-Pvw 

As you can tell by what I rated each item individually, I loved everything I ate at Jean. My faves were the Key Lime and the coconut gelato. The Key Lime had an incredible, flaky crust and the key lime filling was both sweet and tangy. The coconut gelato was phenomenal, as was the white chocolate dipped waffle cone it was served on. The gelato was loaded with real coconut shavings. 

Prices at Jean were not as high as I thought they would have been seeing that it's in the Bellagio, which was a nice surprise. The folks who work here are all friendly and the long line to get your treats moves quickly. 

If you're in Vegas and looking for some great pastries and gelato, check out Jean.

Can I somehow recreate this fountain in my home?  It's very doubtful but it's a nice thought. There is a certificate on their wall from the Guinness World Records.  Pretty neat.  

Besides admiring the fountain and all of their delectable fancy desserts, they have a crepe station, gelato and sandwiches made to order.  I've tried several of their desserts displayed ever so lovely in their case. Each have been as good as they look! I've also had the Dulce de Leche gelato which is always a winner in my book.  Great flavor! 

I've always had great service here.  When you are located in a busy hotel, the line doesn't seem to end.  When the employees still have service with a smile, it says something great about this little place.

Then there are all the fresh baked goods like chocolate croissants (buttery flaky and filled with rich chocolate that melts in your hand) to the cinnamon rolls or the palmiers.

The chocolate selection! From bite size pieces filled with traditional or exotic flavors to artistic pieces that you would like to display before tearing into.

Yes, this chocolate fountain contains 500 feet of stainless steel piping with dark, milk, and white chocolate floating through 27 feet of engineering. The kids and adults alike are attracted to it. I was attracted to it for sure. 

My hubby and I picked up our daily coffee drip and chai latte here during our stay and not only was it convenient, but we also enjoyed their pastries and desserts. 

They have good gelato and macarons and I can eat that for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I purchased one dessert that caught my eye. It was the carrot cupcake filled with moist carrot cake, creamy vanilla and coconut mousse, and topped with a chocolate malt ball and stamped with a chocolate square of approval. It's approved by my eyes and my mouth. 

My favorite breakfast here is the ham and cheese sandwich. The ham is thick and the cheese is pretty much bechamel sauce. The bread itself is crisp and cheesy. I've also had the blueberry brioche which was nice and buttery. The chocolate and almond croissant was flaky and had a rich almond paste in the center. They have good pastries. 

There's plenty of seating surrounding the bakery in the lobby. It's nice that they are not located near the casino so it's more quiet in the mornings.

In comparison to other bakeries found in Vegas hotels, the prices are roughly the same but they're a a bit pricier than Starbucks and rightfully so because their food and drinks are way way waaay yummier (expect to pay roughly $10 for an almond croissant and a chai latte).

The berry crepe was less successful since it had more sauce than fruit for our liking.  This made a good crepe into a mediocre crepe that was soggy.

Note there can be long wait times for crepes - 30 min after ordering is possible since each is made fresh.  I would give more stars if more fresh fruit was used.

First of all, croissants should not taste like they have been soaking in butter for the past 24 hours. They are supposed to be fresh and flaky, not stale and greasy... at 9am in the morning. Were they leftovers from yesterday? I think so, because all 3 of us felt uncomfortable and bloated after eating only a couple of bites. In case you are wondering, it is not a good feeling. There may be some people who like feeling bloated, but I am not one of those. You are an abomination to all my French friends. They wouldn't touch this shit with a 10 foot pole.

Secondly, what kind of an idiot designed your store? You know all the tourists are going to swarm your place like cokeheads at a drag queen bingo event. Why would you design it in a way that does not make sense and backs up traffic into the lobby? Do I really want to knock the diva-acting bitch from Europe who is acting like she deserves to cut in front of the line? Don't make me a cut a bitch.

Yes, your cakes are visually appealing. Maybe I would be impressed if I am getting married at the Bellagio and ordered a wedding cake from you. But, I am not tacky enough to do that. I also hope your cakes do not taste like your croissants.

And, what's up with the coffee? Is burnt coffee the latest trend? Did I miss the memo? You know, I am not always up to date on the latest food/ drink trends. Hold on, I am getting a call (channeling Dave Letterman)... wait a minute, I am being told that burnt coffee is not the current trend. I've been cheated.

The only redeeming grace was the nutella brioche. It was very very good. Hence, the 2 stars.

Okay, that should not come as a surprise for people who knows me... like at all.  Anyway, I was recently in Vegas (my second home) and every morning and evening, I would walk past Jean Philippe.  Sugar junkie confession: I've tried most of his pastries and I've enjoyed every single one.  So when one of my local friends suggested breakfast here, I quickly said ""of course!""  

We shared the Banana Fosters Soufflé Crepes and the Prosciutto Pesto Sandwich.  Both were delish!  The sandwich was toasted and the baguette was crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside.  The crepes were AMAZING!  I love, love, love banana fosters and the crepes did not disappoint at all.  

Now, the location with the chocolate fountain - well, that's inside the Bellagio hotel.  You can even buy the chocolate from the chocolate fountain (at least that's what the packaging says).  It's definitely a site to see if you're a chocolate junkie like me.  

Oh, a must there... their cappuccino!  I did a taste test by having a cup of Jean Philippe and then a Starbucks... the Starbucks cup did not even come close.  So if you're going to spend about $5 on a cappuccino or latte and you're in the area... just spend it here and not waste it on Starbucks.

Ok, although there's more to this place than the Chocolate Fountain, the fountain really is a spectacle to behold.  The fountain is enclosed behind a glass case/barrier that stretches from floor to ceilling....yes you read that right, it's that big.  And so the liquid chocolate free-flowing goes from tray to tray and you can't help but want to just dip your finger and taste all the chocolate goodness....were it not for the glass separating you from the fountain.  And just for the record ladies and gentlemen, there is plaque of authenticity of some sort that informs onlookers that they are indeed in the presence of the world's largest chocolate fountain!

Alright enough about the chocolate fountain.  Now let's talk about one of my favorite food groups:  Dessert!

My friend and I had just come from a happy hour and were at the Bellagio to view the Conservatory Christmas display and Bellagio Fountain show.   We were craving a sweet treat, so thankfully Jean Philippe was open!

Jean Philippe offers a wide array of sweets for those with a sweet tooth:  Crepes, smoothies, gelato, and individual decorative desserts are just some of their offerings.  My friend and I didn't want anything too filling, so we both decided to each order our own individual cheesecake.  Well, for me it was either the carrot cake or cheesecake.  He chose the oreo flavor, while I chose the plain with a raspberry on the top.  I'm a huge fan of cheesecake, and thankfully Jean Philippe knows how to make a GOOD cheesecake!  The cheesecake itself was encased in what seemed like a thin solid layer of white chocolate, that only added more to the anticipation of that first bite.   And it was definitely love at first bite I would say.  Although I was slightly jealous of my friend, since his cheesecake had an oreo crust while mine just had the standard graham cracker, I would say we both enjoyed dessert because it was gone in a flash.
  

TIPS:
1)  There are seating areas within Jean Philippe or in the area adjacent to the Patisserie so you can sit down and enjoy your sweet treat.
2)  Make sure you know what you're ordering or at least ask the workers questions BEFORE placing an order.   Example:  These 2 ladies thought they were ordering crepes when they actually ordered smoothies.  
3)  The line can get long so just make sure to bring some patience with you.

Bottom Line:   Chocolate Fountain!  Wonderful Desserts.  Chocolate Fountain!  Great Selection of sweet treats.  Chocolate Fountain!

During today's visit, I was way too full to eat a cake so I opt for a straciatella gelato.

The red velvet cake was so moist, the icing was a little to sugary for me, loved the hidden wheel of white chocolate, all in all delicious.

The answer to that question is ""Yes. Yes it can."" 

We came to that conclusion when we joined the line about 11:00 one weekday morning during our last visit to LV. So, if you're wondering if it's worth it as you walk by, we'd encourage you to get in line too. A line that actually moves pretty quickly as it snakes around the display counters of pastries, all nicely labeled so you know exactly what to order when you get to the order counter. (And here's a tip:  the line seems shortest at this late morning hour.)

You know what you've heard about he Almond Brioche at Bouchon? Well, they're good there, for sure. But based on my personal research at both places, I vote that Jean Phillipe makes the best one. Ever. 

Drawbacks are these:  If you're looking for a nice place to sit and enjoy your pastries, you're out of luck at this location. There are very few seats and you'll likely need to wander about outside and hope to snag one of the few tables that are in the Bellagio ""concourse"". Hubby and I were lucky to get one and happily offered to share our extra seat with another poor soul who was wondering about, as we had been, looking for a place to land. And if you or someone in your group uses a wheelchair, this is doable but awkward, the line and so on. 

We're headed back to LV in a week or so and this time we'll check out Jean Philippe at City Center. We hear the options are the same and that seating and accessibility are better.

Well Jean Philippe Patisserie was definitely a hit with my friends and I. This was the first stop on our trip to Vegas. As there are two locations we decided to stop at this one inside the Bellagio.

Take, for example, the following exchange, which I vaguely recall.
him: I think I've just witnessed the peak of your sugar addiction.
me: Babe...
him: I've never seen someone eat so much sugar at once.
me: Well, honey...
him: I'm worried you might need an insulin shot after this.

And so my concerned trauma-nurse darling began to monitor my health following a take-no-prisoners sugar episode. Hazelnut gelato paired with a chocolate crepe left my hands shaky, sticky and guilty. 

I quietly whipped out my hand sanitizer following the massacre.
him: There's nothing that can wash this off your hands.
me:  :(
him: Nothing.

It was wise for them to have put the chocolate fountain behind glass. I could have easily sat in it facing upwards, thereby pronouncing the chocolate in the fountain inedible by all others. The boy got a cheesecake pastry, which I later lit candles around in worship. 

Eventually it all became clear.

I stumbled across Jean Philippe while searching for breakfast.  I was staying at Vdara, but found that their quick breakfast place had a really long line.  Since I was in a bit of a hurry, I decided to cross the walkway over to the Bellagio and search out some food next door.

Jean Philippe was the first place open and the line wasn't too long.  Since it was around 8:30 AM, I didn't get a chance to try any of their deserts.  And since I prefer savory breakfast to sweet breakfast, I went with their turkey and cheese crepe.  As far a crepes go it was good but nothing mind blowing.

2327964,2009-02-24,1,UUGoM4q4i8rK2CBRS0xDAw,"I don't mind being charged $11 for a TINY tuna panini sandwich here.

First, allow me to describe what it looks like.  The entire sandwich is less than a foot long and is very light in weight, it's cut in half prior to serving, so it looks even smaller.  It isn't overflowing with meats or veggies.  One glance, and you'd think for $11, that I was a sucker.

But I'm not a sucker.

The flavors.  MAN OH MAN.  The FLAVORS.  TASTY MUCH?  Why all the sudden weird looks from passerby's?  Is there a piece of basil on my chin?  Sauce on my cheek?  Or is it because of the way my facial expression morphs into a kinky ""O-face"" every time I bite into that sandwich?  And the way my body slumps into the chair as I groan and writhe from culinary pleasure?  My think my head is GOING TO EXPLODE.

Their tuna panini was so good that this is where I'd go EVERYTIME I had hunger pangs during my most recent stay at Bellagio.  Good thing they don't close shop until midnight (although I'd prefer it open 24/hours!).

It's funny because I was so enamored with this little sandwich during my stay that I failed to order anything else here.  Next time, I'll be trying out one of their pastry desserts, breakfast items, and gelato.  By the looks of satisfaction on all the other paying customers who were snapping up the sweets, I could tell I'm in for more awkward orgasm-faces during future visits to Jean Philippe Patisserie.

Anyway, a little bit more about the place itself:

Jean Philippe Patisserie is tucked into a small esplanade that connects the Conservatory Gardens greenhouse to the resort's convention areas.  Walking up to it is a treat in itself...its main focal point is what Bellagio bills the ""world's tallest chocolate fountain.""  It's a sight to behold...a massive floor-to-ceiling high fountain system enclosed in glass featuring  flowing white and dark chocolate from multiple dripping points.

Then of course, there are all the elaborately created desserts showcased  behind glass that look more like conversation art pieces than sweets meant to be eaten.  The pair of cartoonish looking giant 4-foot tall rabbits adorning the central work counter in their ""kitchen""?  Yeah.  Both completely made out of chocolate.

So if you're passing through Bellagio or are staying as a guest, please, I urge you to stop by and pick yourself up one of their many choice gourmet sandwiches (along with some gelato or dessert too).  For $11, you get $75 worth of flavor.",LxPec3cT1sNPMAQiQ0_avg,1,2,4,QeL0uOHtrhccpmu3pY6yrA

My family was visiting from out of town and they wanted to see The fountains at the Bellagio and the Botanical gardens. It was a little after 11pm when we rushed into the Bellagio to only find out that they were taking down the gardens and we had just missed the fountain show, so we had to wait a little bit for the next one. 

I literally booked it over to check the deserts because they have one of my favorite key lime tarts. As I went and scurried around the glass case to only see almost all the pastries gone. 
***insert sad face here,lol***
I pick my head up and the gentleman standing by the door saw that I was frantically looking for something. He asked me if I needed help and I told him that I was looking for key lime tarts. He smiled and said that he had it and also suggested the strawberry lemon eclair. I got 2 tarts and the eclair. He smiled again said, I'll pack that for you. 

The cashier was great! She rang me up and I was on my way to catch the next show! 

The tarts were perfect! This time around it had teardrop shaped key lime cream on top as well as a passion fruit flavor and slivers of white chocolate on top. The tart crust was perfection. Make sure you get a little bit of every flavor in your bite for a explosion of delicious-ness in your mouth! Haha

The eclair was delicious as well. Different from the normal chocolate & Bavarian cream I'm used to. The eclair is topped with white chocolate pieces which I took off and It tastes even better without all that extra stuff. You're able to taste the strawberry & lemon flavor. Yum!

I will say it is a little on the pricer side but we are in a strip hotel, so be ready to fork out a little more than usual. For me, definitely worth it. Definitely my treat to myself when I do make my way down there.

The first night, I tried the carrot cake because it looked absolutely beautiful and a Yelper below raved about it. Really, Courtney E? Maybe the quality control isn't great here, but this cake was not even *good*. I mean, it tasted like my 8th grade [public school] cafeteria. The carrot figurine was made with something nasty like fondant, or oh maybe cardboard. The white chocolate was sickeningly sweet, and the carrot cake center was way too rich. Cheesecake frosting was all right. 

I went back the next night (some people go to Vegas to party, I go to eat whatever not-disgusting things I can find, OKAY?) and got the gelato. Now we're talking! It feels so wrong for gelato to be that good. The dulce de leche is truly amazing, perfect balance of creamy and caramel-y, and the mango sorbet is fantastically bursting with mango flavor.

Bought a small box of truffles to take home (to the boyfriend who hates me. After falling off my bike and getting scraped up, I received not sympathy but ""Why are you such a pussy?"")

Located on the main level of the Bellagio Resort & Casino the little bakery is difficult to miss with scores of interested passers-by stopped in front admiring the World's Largest Chocolate Fountain (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/H8qpFitIesth86zqR4cwYg?select=Fwze61auOtWIO7qqZftfoA and http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/H8qpFitIesth86zqR4cwYg?select=NNY_w4GCH3S7XDDwwT6EMw) as confirmed by the Guinness people.

Decorations are nice, but my focus of attention went straight to the bakery case because all of the little desserts (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/H8qpFitIesth86zqR4cwYg?select=cUvmX9TR0T-SsadcR6CXCw and http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/H8qpFitIesth86zqR4cwYg?select=xd8x-dTVzmXltk3mMp2Bow) on display looked fabulous.  They even had sugar-free selections (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/H8qpFitIesth86zqR4cwYg?select=OliyqIlWdwkr3ssI_z--Vw)!  Everything looked great, but something else I had glanced at earlier caught my attention first.

At the very front of the bakery behind a sheet of curved plexiglass is a crepe station where you can watch as freshly made crepes are prepared on a hot griddle.  They had two crepes on display, a mixed berries crepe (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/H8qpFitIesth86zqR4cwYg?select=Y23VBoGim8Vl8JSUTUQM5w) and a chocolate decadence crepe (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/H8qpFitIesth86zqR4cwYg?select=NHqifygfOqSomQpVOprLyQ).  I ordered one of the chocolate ones.  It took a bit of time to be prepared, but the overall product was worth the wait.  The display crepe actually looked better and had a bit more chocolate and a lot more powdered chocolate, but I'm thankful because the crepe I was served was sweet enough.  The chocolate pieces, shavings and glazes were decadent alright and the crepe was nice and chewy.  I didn't eat all the cream as I felt pretty bloated after this dessert.

I didn't stop with the crepe either.  I returned to the counter and ordered a single chocolate-covered strawberry (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/H8qpFitIesth86zqR4cwYg?select=S4rtxwJXeLP4BGi5lakoYA) to take with me to eat at a later time.  My strawberry was a bit squished by the time I returned to the hotel, but it was still delicious nonetheless.  I had fun licking the chocolate off the side of the bag.

The bakery serves gelato also and has a nice assortment of boxed confections on display.  There are other crepe selections also other than the two that were on display.  Jean Philippe Patisserie was the perfect reward to an excellent race.",8Aq_UdlsrjhBwGWb_U-xRA,28,24,5,nGVKTGdYl6jjl3wOWK30Hg

I gave JP's 5 stars.  Based not on the crepes, which are great by all accounts, and neither did i give the pastries consideration. These 5 stars are for making what may be the finest Croissant available in France or otherwise AND for selling the finest prosciutto panini I have had the pleasure of enjoying.  Here's the Skinny:

The Croissant : I have had many in my life, most have been pretty good.  I mean it seems a simple item right?  The croissants from JP reminded me that simple is sublime.  The crust was golden, sweet, & crisp.  The inside soft, warm, simple. If JP's was the Matrix the Croissant would named ""Neo"".

The Panini : JP does not make the prosciutto panini that is so, so, worthy of these 5 stars. Truth be told they just throw it on the panini press.

Amazing pastries 'nough said.

The wife and I had no choice but to stop and taste some items upon walking by this little gem and spotting the visually stunning eye/tummy candy.

My wife and I shared a Sugar Crepe with lemon which we got to see prepared in front of us.  The woman who prepared our crepe clearly had been doing this for a while and it was clear that she took great pride in her work with the skill and joy in which she prepared it.  Not over or under cooked, it was perfect.  Fluffy yet tender crisp edges and the fresh lemon along with the powdered sugar was perfect.

We also shared a Rose Macaroon and a Key Lime pie.  Both were divine.  

The Rose Macaroon was actually a raspberry macaroon with rose infused cream and fresh raspberries topped with a sugar coated rose petal.  The freshness of the raspberries worked wonders with the texture of the macaroons outer layers and the hint of rose flavor added another level.

The Key Lime Pie was stunning as well and topped with a lime green streaked candied top over the whipped cream and almond dough.  Again, perfect flavor and textures working together like in the macaroon.

The coffee drinks were weak, though. Given the prices, the expectations were high. I got my regular soy latte...sadly, there wasn't a whole lot of coffee flavor! DH got a cappuccino and he said, ""It was not that smooth. Not as good as Starbucks."" $5.25 for the large cappuccino and $4.25 + $1 for soy milk for the small latte.

The chocolate almond croissant was great, but really heavy. There's almost too much filling, if that's such a thing! The filling is a marzipan-like sweet almond paste and delicious chocolate.

I was surprised by the lack of seating. There's 3-4 small tables wedged into the walls and some very small tables further down the corridor, but it's very much a take-and-go cafe. The curvy, bending mounted wall menu is hard to read when it's over your head while in line, so decide what you want beforehand. The lady taking the orders was pretty rude to me as well. I must've not heard her when she asked me what I wanted and she skipped to the person behind me. ""Excuse me, did you take my order yet?"" I asked politely. ""No."" She glared at me. Whoa, alright, sorry. She left for a little bit, came back, sighed, and begrudgingly told me, ""Okay NOW I can take your order."" Jeez, I'll buy some hearing aids next time. All other staff were pretty nice. 

I feel like I've listed a lot of cons, but it's not a bad place! It's a beautiful, unique, tasty cafe. The chocolate fountain is awe-worthy. It's hard to resist the urge to break through the glass and just drown yourself in the chocolaty waterfall. Lots of amazing, quirky, gorgeous cakes lining the walls so you have some eyecandy when in line or eating. 

On to food!
NUTELLA BRIOCHE // Simple and delicious. Soft, tender bread with Nutella injected right in the middle.

BERRY SOUFFLE CREPE // The crepe itself was fine, syrup too sweet for my taste, strawberries weren't fresh, but OH-DEAR-LORD I just have to give the 4th star for the souffle filling. I think I've found something I love more than Nutella. There! I said it. If only they sold that vanilla creme in a double-pack from Costco. Only an inkling of public decency kept me from licking that plate clean. Would've been absolutely perfect if I had the souffle crepe sans syrup with fresh berries and dollop of whipped cream.

SUGAR CREPE // My friend ordered this plain crepe and...it was no good. She hated it and she grew up in France, she knows what a real crepe should be like. It was filled with granulated sugar and sickeningly sweet. Skip!",qpPnK7T2T2QHaideR0HXgg,0,0,4,zoXjFNhY2N1QpvraYcGFaA

My favorites are the pesto prosciutto mozzarella panini, vanilla shake, really any of the crepes and pastries because they are all heavenly.

Chocolate croissant for breakfast oh hell yeah! That's my thing. But it was just a big surprising joke that this chocolate croissant from this place wasn't right compare with the price that I paid for. $4.50 for chocolate croissant sure if the filling was full. But this one wasn't at all. The chocolate filling was very skimpy. For the price, this croissant was supposed to be full of deliciousness. But the croissant itself just fell apart when I was eating it, very crumbled. What I can says is the Starbucks chocolate croissant much better compare this one. 

My husband ordered the veggie omelette with fruit & wheat bread but he got the white bread instead. He was just too lazy to deal with the line just to tell them about the wrong bread. The taste of the omelette was just bland. Didn't look tempting at all, it was looked like a cheap grocery store. It was just a egg pancake rolled up with vegetables skattered on top. It cost almost $11 for that and nothing special about it. Even Denny's makes a better Omelete than that. I can make the omelette much much better than that! 

So I won't be back here next time for the breakfast or the croissant but I might try other sweet treats just for the heck of it.

Meh, overpriced and ove rhyped crepes. It was later in the evening so they didn't have as many of the pastries I wanted to try so my boyfriend and I settled for crepes. We got the berries one and added bananas (which was another $1 or $2). After they called us to pick up our order, I asked them if they could drizzle chocolate over it and they said it was another $1. Like what? We paid almost $15 for that crepe and it just made me cringe because back in my college dorm days of unlimited meal swipes, I definitely ate better quality crepes for a fraction of that price. It wasn't the best crepe - way too sweet and I wish the fruits were fresh. The dough of the crepe itself was also on the dough-y side and not as thin and crispy as I would've liked it to be.

1. Nearby seating is very limited and there are no highchairs available for children
2. Servers are not very aware of ingredients for allergies (if your allergy is severe you may need to be ask a lot of questions)

My Experience:
When I first went by on a Tuesday around 2:30pm there was a very long line. I decided to come back before we left. I came back at 4:35ish just when live music was starting in the conservatory and the fountains were playing. There was a small line for the gelato and pastries and no line for the crepes. There were lots of pastries available and all of the gelato containers had some in them with a few less than 20% left.

The crepe took about 10 minutes to be prepared. I got a savory crepe that I customized (because of an allergy to tomatoes and peppers) to include chicken, basil, pesto sauce, mushrooms. (I also mentioned that I wanted mozzarella but I didn't receive any) The servers went over my order and the two of them seemed to be discussing whether or not to charge me for an extra ingredient... one seemed to say no that would be the same as a regular order and the total was $12.95 with tax. I added a $1 tip to make it $13.95.

My buckwheat crepe was delicious and had a creamy pesto sauce (that I want to try to recreate), the chicken was spiced and my crepe was filled with chicken, tons of basil, and lots of mushrooms. The only downside was that I could tell that there were red spices in the pesto and on the chicken... which normally indicates red peppers of some kind, which I did tell the preparer I was allergic to, but wasn't pushy about. (I am not deathly allergic it just causes my eczema the flare significantly which causes me a lot of pain. And the pesto was soo good it is kinda worth it...)

All of the small tables were in use but there was a large table and I asked a man for a chair he wasn't using, my 14 month old stood on the chair next to me and ate pieces I cut off for her, she thoroughly-enjoyed the crepe too. We left very satisfied... and had no room left for a pastry... which I decided to save for our next trip but I am regretting.... I want one very badly right now....",lOA78lWkUwEk7oIQER-bDQ,0,0,4,Womdhv7ky-OfTYaToO85QQ

Well a friend really wanted to try it so after some consideration I choose the exotic dessert crepe for my first experience. I've had crepes in France as well as several places in the US and one of the biggest differences between France and here is the sweetness of the crepe. Here in the US the dessert crepes are very sweet but in France the crepes as well as most other pastries are much more subtle with less overpowering sweetness so you can savor the more subtle richness of the butter, the tart flavor of the berries and fruits, and all the other flavors in the dish. The crepe I had here at Jean Philippe Patisserie reminded me of those French pastries and that has been quite a rare accomplishment here in the states.

The filling of the Rose Macaron was different than the macarons you typically get from a pastry shop.  The texture was close to a custard filling.

The pastries are simply superb and the cakes are artistic masterpieces, with prices to match, but if that's your thing and price is no object... go for it.

Ok so we ordered three croissants, one was original (plain) and the other was an almond covered and finally a chocolate chip filled.

The flakiness on all three were excellent and I must say that it lived up to what we were told about them, for me they were the best tasting croissants I have ever tasted.

We were told about this place because of the worlds largest chocolate fountain and that in itself was well worth seeing, a very dazzling display.
It had glass bowls shaped and made to look like large ice chip shaped bowls. 

There are three different types of chocolate flowed from three separate chrome rectangular spouts, White, Dark, and Milk Chocolate.

Ok, so the croissants were excellent, they had just the right flakiness and they were very fresh tasting, the glaze on them was perfect and not to thick and sticky. The almonds were slivered and not to many, just the right amount to have flavor in every bite. The chocolate chips were also evenly distributed and did not overwhelm the flavor of the croissant  at all.

We also ordered the coffee, it was great, smooth and full flavored, seconds were in order for sure.

I took back to the hotel (for my after dinner dessert snack) a Chocolate/Coconut Macaroon. It was about the size of a golf ball.

I'm glad it wasn't bigger because it would have been a shame to throw it all away, Sorry to say the flavor combo here just didn't work for me. Not that I like it very sweet, but the something was missing, maybe the flavor of the chocolate was too bitter, but I'll have to say personally I would not get this again.

When we go back to Vegas we will definitely return here, there are so many more things to try. They also have Gelato, bottled chocolate from the fountain, Macaroons, custom cakes (large and small of all styles and ideas imaginable). It was all decked out in fall decor, the staff was helpful but a bit on the rude side.
It's a small shop so it get's really over crowded very fast, not much seating inside but there are small tables outside of it down the hall, but I think they are for the restaurant patrons?

I was actually really disappointed when I showed up with my girlfriend and her husband on Monday, May 1st, around 9:30 PM to grab some gelato because it was so hot outside. 

I waited in line to ask if I could taste the hazelnut gelato and it was warm.  I asked the girl if they knew that the ice cream was half melted and she replied, ""yeah, our freezer's not working very well.""  

Ok, I'm sorry, but this is the Bellagio and this is some pretty dang expensive gelato.  How can they just expect their customers to pay for some half ass excuse of a gelato??  

If the freezers aren't functioning properly, then they shouldn't be selling the gelato.  Why try to sell poor quality stuff and end up losing customers because of it?

The only reason I am giving them 2 stars is because I ended up buying my daughter a 16-ounce cup of whole milk for $3 and the cashier was friendly.",Bbar1EB4JEviStEAqUEFOg,15,11,2,BHmXe_g4nMkJReZDfl40kw
3014560,2010-05-09,0,UUGoM4q4i8rK2CBRS0xDAw,"Have you ever eaten something that blew your mind to the point where you repeat ""Oh my God"" several times in a minute?  I just had that experience at Jean Philippe's.  The best way to express my feelings at this moment is to describe it--I feel like I've taken a bite of heaven, and the sugar Gods are dancing on my tongue.

I know.  You're wondering if I'm over exaggerating.  I believe that this place has the best brioche I've ever eaten.  The rest of the stuff is great, don't get me wrong.  The chocolates are lovely and creamy with the right bitterness to the chocolate, and their pastries are light, creamy, and made with love.  Their gelatos are perfect and to add a scoop into a white chocolate-dipped cone is pure heaven.  But this review is given with thanks to that beautiful, lovely, edible cloud of bread known as their sugar brioche.

What blows my mind about this brioche is the sugar crystals on the bread.  I cannot believe the texture on this thing.  First, you pull apart the brioche and you see how soft it is inside.  There are these beautiful crystals of sugar all around it that compliment the yeasty flavor.  The sugar isn't hard crystallized sugar, but some sort of cooked down and dried sugar that's broken up again and the brioche is rolled around in it.  The texture of the sugar with the soft interior is wonderful.

The cinnamon rolls are very popular and fortunately I bought the last one.  Their cream cheese is nice, and the roll looks pretty big.  Nice flavor, flaky outside, and sticky.  I love it.

Overall, great patisserie and one I'll return to time and again.  If you aren't into the flaky croissants or fancy chocolates, steer clear.  Otherwise I suggest a sugar brioche, croissant, gelato, a few truffles and a cinnamon roll for a huge, sweet indulgence.",o68A_3bAJTge-ioGXHdxKA,1,1,5,li2WX44EXD3NM82PEvwE4w

Right on top of the register counter you will find such a gorgeous sculpture as well that is sure to please the wandering eye. 

For all that we purchased, it came out to around $19. Not bad in price. You will get hit with the sweet odor of chocolate upon arrival as well as the lovely view of all they have to offer. By far, I have been to many a dessert stop in my life. Jean Philippe Patisserie, in all honesty, ranks in my Top 5 all time. If you don't believe me, the next time you are in Vegas, come and have a look see. Maybe you will want to try some of their cold tasty gelato. Or their soft tasty subs. Or even some of the tastiest pastries you ill ever have on the Strip. Bon Appetit, Yelp!",Nci8Nx0_9G0MSLYvQifacQ,20,18,5,Tk1p_uw8SURExo7Z-hUp8A

I ended up buying a couple of chocolates for presents for my dad (he loves dark chocolate) and my fiance (he prefers milk). I decided to treat myself and chose the ""Snicker"" pastry which was totally AH-MAZING!! I ended up eating it over the course of two days as I found it super rich and large for one person.

The pastry was enrobed in chocolate and filled with a smooth chocolate mousse with a hidden surprise in the middle of crunchy whole peanuts covered in caramel - DIVINE!!

This is my go-to brunch place when I'm on the Vegas strip. Line can be crazy and there's limited seating. 

Ham and cheese on baguette (cold) - 4 stars for what it is - a simple French ham and cheese sandwich. The panini version is just as good but was on ciabatta this time (not sure if that's a new thing or the usual).

Chicken panini is a solid 3 stars

Butter croissant is a solid 3.5 stars - felt really airy and empty, but it actually had a nice fluffy and ample filling. The entire pastry is topped with sugar making it really sticky. However, that adds a nice sweetness to the croissant. 

The desserts are really pretty and good renditions of classic French pastries. I'm a fan of their strawberry tart. Expensive, but so is all of the other non-ghetto food in Vegas.",NEIYKki2XKFjLan4ba77rw,0,0,4,w_ACKtsMWa9riXtCzYv2mw

I see why people are attracted to this place.  Talk about great eye candy!  

My friend ordered the raspberry tart and the rose tea macaron.  The raspberry tart was basically a crust filled with pastry cream and a tier of raspberries.  That was not something we felt was worth almost $7.  Nothing special.  The rose tea macaron was definitely something out of the ordinary but again didn't retrieve enough of our interest to try it in the near future.  It's basically rose tea infused into cream to give it that distinctive taste.  

I went back the next day to the one inside the Aria hotel and got the fruit tart.  Although it was enough to satisfy my sweet tooth, I wasn't feeling much excitement with the pastry cream nor the crust.

This bakery was a lot smaller, but it didn't matter - the people lined up around the counter and patiently waited as servers got pastries, sandwiches, and skillfully made the drinks and crepes.

I was on my macaron quest in Vegas and unfortunately, the little ones were not sold from this bakery. There was a little green pistachio macaron on top one of their craft pastries, so I decided to opt for their giant rose macaron - bright raspberry coloured, the size of a hockey pick (approx). with raspberries and custard cream sandwiched in the middle, decorated with a dried edible sugared rose petal on top... pure elegance!

My first bite into this piece of artwork was soft, and well balanced - sweet, but not too sweet, and nice to have some real fruit as a part of the filling. The rose petal only tasted like sugar, so I left it. It was good to share with my friends as the portion for one person can be a little too much. The rosewater was subtle and although an acquired taste, I thought it was just right.

The gelato at JP is really something else. The silkiness is divine and the flavours are bursting with flavour and it seems like any flavours combined would still be perfect no matter what. Trying the oreo and the strawberry... I could not have tasted a better pair. If there was a whole tub, I think I'd eat it all.

I had just eaten more than I should at the Bellagio Buffet, so I just grabbed some chocolate covered pretzels for the plane ride back home and a post card of the chocolate fountain (to show off to my friends).

Next time, before I go the buffet, I will definitely try either a crepe or a pastry... and of course more chocolate.

We were in line for 30 minutes, and not because they had tons of people in line, they were literally that slow.  So when you walk by and they seem super busy or packed, just know it's that they are super slow and not that they serve that many people.  Three people around me in line left before reaching the counter because it was that slow.  It could have something to do with the fact that ""charles"" who claimed to be the manager did nothing but stand around the entire time or it could be that another worker had a wash cloth and wiped the same three feet of counter not less than ten times and did nothing else.  The only person working hard was the poor lady making crepes.  Charles let this happen instead of doing the right thing and offering to help her.  Guess he's too good to do any real work or get his hands dirty.  The people in front of me were planningo on ordering gelato, but the first three flavors they requested were greeted with ""we're out of th0at flavor"" and then ""we are out of anything with nuts"".  This was interesting since Charles, you know the manager thad stood around doing nothing, seemed to be responsible for keeping the gelato bar full since he stood over it making a list of what was needed.  In all the time I waited, he never brought any of them out though.

Finally, I get to the front of the line and I ask Charles if he is a manager.  He answere ""yes"" but kept his head down and wouldn't even look at me.  Guess he's too good to interact with customers too.  When I told him I felt the service was really bad and that I didn't appreciate that someone that handled money without washing their hands was now handling the overpriced pasteries I ordered, he didn't even respond.  I kid you not.  He was three feet in front of me and he literally pretended not to hear or see me even though he actually replied to my first question (without looking at me).  He should have just said ""f*ck you"" to me so at least I didn't hold my breath waiting for a  response.

I wish I had an opinion about the food, but the experience was so horrible and dealing with Charles was so insulting that I didn't even eat what I ordered.

I really wanted to love this place. Maybe I went in expecting too much? Maybe the local shops in San Francisco have spoiled me? Maybe the notoriety of their ""amazing"" chocolate fountain has become more significant than the actual product?  Regardless, Jean Philippe failed to make a fan out of me and my sweet tooth.

Delectables: (1) Blueberry muffin - bland; not moist at all; I've had better ones from Costco and ""day-olds"" from almost anywhere.  Girl behind the counter recommended this over the blueberry danish (what would that have tasted like? rock?); (2) Triple chocolate cheesecake - sounds delicious; tastes average.  Dark, milk and white chocolate cheesecake with an Oreo cookie crust and topped with a truffle? Sounds too good to be true doesn't it? It was; (3) Veggie crepe - why did this taste like garden vegetable soup smeared in a crepe? I couldn't even tell what veggies were actually in there. I am so confused.  Side salad was A-OK though; (4) I did like the almond croissant. However, the ones at La Boulangerie are better, and half the cost!

Coffee: SKIP IT! Paying almost $8 for a double iced latte is an abomination. There is a Starbucks at the Monte Carlo that will make you better (and predictable) coffee for much less.  If you must though, order two shots of espresso over ice (under $5) and add milk yourself.  Whole, skim and half and half are conveniently located just 2 steps to the side of the main pastry counter.  FYI separate (faster) line in the morning for drip coffee only orders. 

Customer Service: Fast and furious, but generally good. One note though: Kevin, please lighten up. It's not all so bad!  Heavy sighing and eye-rolling when people whip out a credit card - requiring you to do an additional step - is not a great way to earn customer satisfaction points. I witnessed this on two separate days.  You work in a chocolate/dessert shop after all! Try a couple of truffles when the blood sugar gets too low :-)

Way too much.

Back when I was young and not 21, my parents discovered this sugary place in Bellagio. And me being my young self, as a rugrat, I loved sugar.

Well now that I'm over that hump, I still love sugar and ice cream. And during our trip to Vegas, I HAD to go to Jean Philippe Patisserie. Just HAD to! And my cousin said okayyyy and so we went to JPP.

They serve breakfast and you only have 1 line in the mornings til around 11:10AM. At that time, they separate into 2 lines. So if you're like me and want ice cream, you can get a second line at that time rather than wait in the whole long line.

Chocolate- Love it. Rich, very rich. Sweet. Amazing. Tasty. In love. It's like on a whole nother dimension. I wish they had it here in Socal.:DDD I always get this and I wish I could just eat this every dayyyy.

Mint Choco Chip- Hehe the mint is in chip form and it just brightens and freshens you up. It wakes you up. 

They also have chocolate bars and other Halloween candies. They have waffle-ish stuff as well here, so you CAN eat this for breakfast. But at the end of the day, I still love their gelato/ice cream.",tgc4EiUhLO8nlws4Uy0fOQ,10,9,5,MjjUshn2yQ25KHnaMV3ALQ

Since this place seems to be best known for its chocolate (after all, it has the world's largest chocolate fountain), we decided to go for the chocolate crepe which comes with chocolate fudge, brownie bites, and whipped cream. The chocolate was amazing...probably some of the best tasting chocolate I can remember eating. Luckily they give you a generous portion of whipped cream to go along with it, so the richness of the chocolate doesn't overpower the taste of the crepe. The crepes were very light and thin, you can even watch them make them right in front of you too which was nice. Unfortunately the lady making them was a bit rude when we asked of the brownie bites had any nuts in them, but the crepe was good enough to overlook her attitude.

Despite wanting everything, I decided on Dulce de leche gelato.  Just brilliant!  Perfect texture and the flavor was probably one of the best I've tasted outside of Rome.  I savored my treat standing in the rotunda garden, relishing in a flood of sensory delights that are so abundantly Vegas.

To the right of the main counter you will see a melange of chocolate cascading down into shallow glass ledges allowing the chocolate to pool and then overflow to the ledge below, somewhat like a waterfall. Random fact: this is the largest chocolate fountain in the world, Guinness Book recognized. Above you a train, and all around will be cakes, desserts, bright colors and delicious smells. And right directly in front of you, will be the Mr. Wonka of Crepes. Pouring, flipping and serving them up warm and neatly decorated. 

This is how it works, go to the register (as the sign instructs) order your crepe of choice or other confection and wait until your name is called. Don't rush the bystanders and start shouting orders to the people actually making the crepes, that's not their job to take your order. 

They have quite the assortment, we opted for: Bananas Foster, Dulce de Leche and Apple Walnut crepes. As we stood nearby taking in the production I realized that the crepes were not actually being made the way I've seen in so many places (my most favorite crepe place is inside Paris Hotel, Le Creperie I should have went there). My disappointment kicks in. Rather than fill the warm air crepe with the delicious choice I've selected. The crepe is folded and slapped on a plate and then the topping is what you'd anticipate to be your filling. So now I'm eating an open faced crepe. I would have much rather enjoyed my sweets neatly enclosed and dusted with powder sugar and served with a dollop of cream. It still of course have a somewhat pleasant flavor, but my palette did not feel completely satisfied, it was lacking a little pizazz. My bananas foster was a little strong (alcohol flavor) and the the sauce was a little runny for my liking. For the three of us to enjoy these crepes it was almost $35 and it really was not worth it, (sigh).

From the outside looking in, the well-lit interior was small, with foot traffic evolving around the circular glass case overlooking a number of desserts that were on full display. We sat at the small counter to slowly fork into our treats once the bill was settled. The noise level was high, and the room was filled with anticipation. My eyes were much bigger than my stomach on this decadent evening. 

The Triple Chocolate Cake ($8) was layered with chocolate mouse, thick milk and white chocolate cream, and toffee at the bottom for texture. It was the most decadent dessert of the night. The chocolate flavors were multiple and distinct, but also intermingled with a level of balance without it being too sweet. 

My favorite of the night was the Lemon Tart ($8). It was made with lemon custard, vanilla meringue, white chocolate ring, and candied strawberry at the bottom. I wished the crust was easier to cut into. Aside from that, the refinement on all levels was unparalleled. The layer of candied strawberry served as a nice intermediary between the ingredients, but also cut through some of the tart elements of the custard. It was worth getting.

The Vanilla Éclair ($8) arrived with cream puff dough, vanilla cream, and a thin piece of dark chocolate on top. Unfortunately, the cream puff dough did not taste fresh. I loved the vanilla cream and a touch of coffee to add a nice element of surprise. However, I did not think the price was worth the value, especially given our problem associated with the cream puff dough.

Santi's choice of Pistachio Rice Crispy Ball ($3.50) came with rice crispy that embodied a sweet aromatic pistachio flavor that lingered and intensified along with each chew. It was delicious. I can't wait to try the strawberry flavor on the next visit.

I also had the Ice Tea ($4.25) that tasted refreshing and clean, but over-priced for the size of the cup. Service can be confusing as there were two lines and a lack of clarity on the protocol. Overall, it was still a pleasant experience with a number of shortcomings. These shortcomings had to do with the limited selection of pastries available, freshness of the Éclair, and price. In short, I find the desserts to be balanced in flavor, not too sweet, and made with high quality ingredients.

The decor of this place is beautiful, as with anything inside Bellagio. The chocolate fountain display is worth staring at. I came here with a group of 7 for lunch. Not a lot of seating options, they have a couple of small tables but this is more of a place you order and take to go. They have variety of pastries and gelato you can choose from as well crepes and drinks. Their pastries looked so good! I didn't get any but I really wanted to because they were just gloriously sitting there waiting to be eaten.

I got the smoked salmon crepe and a banana foster crepe to share. They both tasted great but for the price I paid, I expected a bit more. Both crepes are about $12 each and that's a lot for crepes in my opinion. The salmon crepe was delicious, they use a distinct sauce that I found quite enjoyable with the salmon. There was also asparagus inside the crepe that added a nice crunch, but i felt like that they gave too little smoked salmon. The crepe was mostly filling and I wanted more smoked salmon. The banana foster was sweet and the caramel was wonderful but I wished the banana wasn't so mushy because the entire crepe lacked any sort of texture. I also got a mocha and that was pretty standard. To finish off my meal I got a chocolate chip mint gelato and I really enjoyed that. Their gelato was smooth and creamy :)

We stayed in the Spa tower so every time we needed to go anywhere, we would pass by this place. So good that we made it a point to get a little something each time we passed.  

What drew us in was the chocolate fountain. It's so mesmerizing to watch, but at first I just ignored it because I thought there was now way it was real. Super cool and I kept seeing tour groups around it.  

Now for the food - the gelato was tasty and the perfect texture and density.  Sometimes gelato places make it too much like regular ice cream where it's too hard or too thick or not thick enough. We had the mint chocolate chip and the small size satisfied our gelato craving nicely. 
We also had a couple of the tarts. The strawberry tart was delicious even though it was $6.50 and tiny, it's totally worth the tastes.

After a visit to the fall exhibit at the Bellagio's Conservatory and Botanical Garden, I took a short stroll over to Jean Philippe Patisserie to check out their sweets and baked goods. The gelato is positioned front and center near the record-holding chocolate fountain. With the line not so long on a Monday evening, I decided that I had to try it.

Fortunately, it didn't cost an unheard-of exorbitant level of pricing even at a Strip hotspot. At $4.25 for a single scoop in a cup, $2 for every additional scoop (although one wonders how many scoops they can squeeze in), and extra for cones, you can surely budget for this selection of classic/safe flavors. I got in a sample of pistachio gelato before proceeding to order one scoop each of my go-to flavors, mango sorbet and hazelnut gelato.

The pistachio is that artificial almond-ridden stuff that resembles the cheap ice cream pistachio flavor, so I quickly forgot about it. The mango sorbet was nicely tart and rich in flavor, not too far off from the best flavored mango sorbets that I've had. However, it had way too many shards of ice crystals, suggesting some long-term storage issues that should not be present in a premium product. The hazelnut gelato was quite smooth aside from the untraditional but welcome chopped hazelnuts. Fortunately, that flavor was free of ice crystals. But perhaps the biggest issue is the gigantic gelato spoon that forces you to use just a corner or else plow through your dessert far too quickly. This has no place going with this dessert.

The almond croissant is still lovely, even the day after. Throw it in the oven for a few minutes if you want to restore the crunch or just enjoy the fluffiness and almond paste goodness alone. I also tried their palmier for the first time, which was also awesome and addictive. If you want flaky, buttery puff pastry with the right amount of sugar, this is the way to go.

So for those keeping score, it's a green light for baked goods at Jean Philippe Patisserie, and a yellow light for the gelato. Certain flavors will do in a pinch, but it's no must-go destination for gelato connoisseurs.

Jean Philippe Patisserie is a feast for the eyes --chocolate fountains, chocolate shoes, chocolate dragons...pastries and desserts in an abundance of hue and textures. Soak it all in. For a moment, nothing else in life really matters aside from deciding what will one have as a treat.

On this my 3rd trip, I decided on a white mocha and paired it with a raspberry tart. With the first bite, time paused --delight took over, the palette, the senses, and the experience. From the perfectness of the raspberry, to the balanced richness of the custard, to the buttery goodness of the cookie base, it was many moments in time until the last crumb was eaten that will be a joy forever.

Yes the space at this location with tables and chair stools are minimal and I would suggest taking the goodies in one of many comfy hotel seating close by the area windows but even the location with patrons milling around ordering their goodies did not in the least take away from the delight of the food.

We had delicious crepes and a coffee for a mid-day pick me up! Each visit we tried a different flavor on our crepes. We ended up splitting so much I can't even remember all the kinds we had. They are presented beautifully, and taste delicious. The gelato is also absolutely delish.

Had a good sized line each time we went, but it was okay because there are so many pretty cakes, massive chocolate fountains, and other assorted goodies to look at... you'll be easily distracted while you wait.

It's a dessert place...plain and simple.  

Coconut gelato: a must-try; the triple chocolate cupcake was tasty as well. 

Chocolate indulgence or insanity, whatever it was called: was SUPER rich and decadent but very tasty as well.  

Key Lime Pie: had the right amount of tartness, though I prefer it to be a touch less sweet (I'm not a big sweets hoarder)

Red velvet cupcake:...meh, I've had better.  The cake portion was lacking.

Get anything creme brulee that they make...their custards are super silky.  

The chocolate croissant was excellent.  Very flaky and delicious.  We actually got it for the next morning and nuked it, and it still came out delicious.  Big thumbs up on that.

I've come here twice, and I always end up getting a plethora of desserts to share.  It's really the best way to experience a variety without breaking the bank or feeling like you're a lonely, depressed, geriatric with a sweet tooth.  

Solid overall...always a must-go everytime I hit up Vegas.  I especially like the Bellagio location because of the fun decor.

If you treck to the Bellagio Casino in Las Vegas, and enjoy the indoor garden/green house that grace the big hall next to the lobby, venture in a little bit further. Behind the green garden there is a small garden of indulgence. Jean-Phillipe Patisserie. ( I believe he is the head chocolatier for Bellagio) Well, the place is spectacular and filled with goodies dripping from its wall and ceiling. Literally. :)

My favorite indulgence there is the gelato. It is pricey, but so worth it. I mean, hey, you are in a fancy place, you gotta expect to pay a fancy price. At least it's fancifully good too ~.^

What is your mood? Something light and refreshing? Something soury to perk you up? Something with umph and rich? fruity? etc etc. You gotta taste them and make your pick. My last venture was for Tiramisu and Rum Raisin. *drool* Perfect combo. My sister chose strawberry and chocolate. The chocolate gelato is dark and rich and taste more chocolatey than a chocolate colored frozen sugar. That, my fellow yelpers, is how chocolate ice cream or gelato supposed to taste like.

In the Summer I would usually go for the fruity sorbet type, like mango, coconut, lemon. They perk you and chill your body as you stroll out into the hot summer of Las Vegas.

The place opens late and will fulfill your sweetest indulgence from something cold, something warm, something hot and something crunchy. Cakes, Pastries, Chocolates, Candies, Crepes, Gelato. You name it. They opens pretty late and starts early in the day (in case you play hard and forgot the time of day and realize you need *ehm* breakfast.

It's always busy and there are multiple lines for different things (gelato, crepes, pastries, etc.). My first time at this location, I was confused. It was about 15 minutes before closing, so the line for gelato started from the inside instead of outside, which was weird because I couldn't see the flavors available before choosing and paying. It also felt weird to ask for samples because I couldn't see the flavors and because they were busy, so I did not ask. People were lining up even at closing time.

I got a double scoop of pistachio & coconut sorbet, which complemented each other perfectly. My friend got a double scoop of tiramisu and oreo, which went well together too. The gelato is perfectly soft, cold, and rich in flavor. I got my gelato and went out to watch the Bellagio fountain show, so the gelato melted more quickly than it would have if I had stayed inside the casino. It was still enjoyable!

I came back the following afternoon for a refresher in the summer heat. This time, the line for gelato started from outside, which made more sense for viewing flavors before ordering. I got strawberry sorbet, which was just the right amount of fruity and so refreshing. My friend got the berry sorbet, and it was a bit too tangy/sour. I also got a raspberry cream dessert to-go, and the chocolate in it was so rich. Can't go wrong with any dessert here.

The only negative was that around 3pm in the afternoon, about 4-5 flavors were out. Pistachio and coconut ran out, which are my go-to flavors. Some customers left the line after seeing how many flavors weren't available. I'm surprised they didn't refill sooner.",GIQFFslg2SJJUg3x_Ybahw,2,1,5,wFfDO7bYGtAjWWFnP9NcYw

Raspberry Tart - Take a look at the photo I posted....how can you pick just one?! But I closed my eyes and pointed at the Raspberry tart...and boy did that gamble pay off!  I am a raspberry lover and this satisfied every craving I could ever imagine.

Crepes - Tried the Forrest (Ham, Egg, Swiss Cheese), and the Apple Sensation (Caramelized Apples, Candied Pecans, and Whip Cream).  The Forrest was just ok, but the Apple Sensation was...well, sensational. :)

Nutella Brioche - It's nutella. A lot of it. In a flaky brioche pastry. Tasty - yes. Life changing - not really. 

Finally...as a nightcap, I tried the JP Road gelato (their take on Rocky Road). Wow. So amazing...I think there are also cookie dough (oreo?) pieces. The chocolate was so smooth and velvety....so worth it.

On the first visit I got a chicken, spinach and parmesan crepe and a chocolate croissant. The croissant was a little too dry and flaky outside, but the gobs of chocolate and soft, chewy interior made up for it. The crepe was a good size with quality ingredients and a nice side salad.

On the second visit, I got the ham, mushroom, egg and swiss crepe and almond croissant. The hard exterior of the crepe was made better by the soft, delicious almond paste inside. The crepe was better than the first one and was savory and filling - also came with a side salad.

My only recommendation is to change the ordering line up somehow because you order made to order items toward the very end of the line when you pass all the desserts and ready made items on the inside, and chocolates on the outside.

When I stayed at The Bellagio this place saved me when I was desperate for coffee. I had the caramel coffee and it was delicious. The caramel was rich and not too sweet. It was nice to stroll The Conservatory around the corner while enjoying my coffee. 

I grabbed some sweets to take home at the end of my stay as well. The raspberry tart (almond sponge cake, pistachio cream, raspberry mousse, brittle, and glazed raspberries on top) was really good. I enjoyed every last bite and the winning flavor combination. The lemon meringue tart had a nice tasting filling with a lightly toasted fluff topping. The only item that I didn't love was the apple brioche because it had an odd flavor and was a little on the dry side.

As you'd expect the goodies are on the pricey side. Everything in the case is marked so while pricey it shouldn't be a surprise when you go to pay.

I wanted to try everything but I knew a collection of $6.90/dessert would have made my wallet cry later on. The cashier suggested the Chocolate Cheesecake and Imperial as the most popular dishes sold. Both were beautifully decorated and almost too pretty to eat. There is a limited number of seating inside the patisserie so I proceeded to move to the Bellagio seating area adjacent to JP. I went on a Sunday evening and surprisingly, there weren't too many people lining up or buying but I can imagine the place does loop around. 

The verdict:
Chocolate Cheesecake had a rich, overwhelmingly sweet white chocolate exterior. The mousse-like filling was too rich for me, but I love the Oreo graham cracker! It was a nice complement to the cheesecake. I like the creation just because it is different from most of the standard cheesecakes I have tried and this one tastes more moist, airy, and fresh.

The Imperial was my favorite just because I felt it was the perfect combination of chocolate, hazelnut, and crunch. Mmmm. This pastry gets my vote :) Try it.

They have the outside fountains with their gigantic geysers of thunderous water rocketing practically into orbit. On the inside they have a giant chocolate fountain next to Jean Philippe Patisserie with tons of chocolate flowing like molten lava from exorbitant heights.  Everything else at the Bellagio is larger than life as well, except for the Patisserie.  I am completely dumbfounded as to why they would stuff Jean Philippe's into a tiny, extremely claustrophobic corner.  Whoever designed this shop, should have been boiled in chocolate and encased in its over tempered remains (maybe rolled in coconut) for eternity.

Chocolate and gelato are two renewable resources available all over Las Vegas and an absolute necessity for my times spent on the strip.  Jean Philippe has both of these resources along with buttery croissants, napoleons, crepes, and much more.  Their gelato is very good but I mainly go there for the chocolate.  Their chocolate patties are merely good.  Their truffles, on the other hand, are exquisite.  The exterior chocolate casings just might be the smoothest, creamiest, most delicious chocolate I have ever tasted.  The various concoctions Jean Philippe has contrived to fill these wonderful balls of culinary magic, in my opinion, are the most imaginative, blissfully decadent truffle centers of all time.

We were at the Bellagio for a wedding a little early to avoid traffic for the marathon taking place this past weekend.

As the wedding wasn't starting until 11AM, we realized we hadn't had breakfast, and wouldn't be eating until the reception later on. We decided we would stop by at Jean Philippe's as it was near the venue for our event.
We noticed the busy atmosphere and long line but we were in a crunch for time and needed to get food in our stomachs.

We were not disappointed!! Everything we ordered was awesome! I ordered a cesar salad which was a very filling and a generous portion for the price, along with some yummy iced coffee. The chicken in my salad was super fresh and thinly sliced, and the cesar dressing was deliciously creamy.

My guests ordered a vegetarian quiche which she loved, and my other guest ordered a trio of tuna, avocado and brie, and ham and cheese sandwhiches which she loved as well!

Everything tasted super fresh and delicious, amazing quality and very little wait time for our big order. I had a bite of the avocado and brie and it was absolutely delicious! 

They also had a bunch of mouthwatering smelling and looking pastries and sweets that we will have to try next time we are in town. Unfortunately I didn't see any macarons during my visit otherwise I would've definitely indulged.

I took the opportunity to sample the other two crepes in my party:
- Salmon crepe. I have to say, I make some amazing decisions when it comes to trying out a new place. There was much more salmon on top than I had imagined. The pesto sauce (or whatever it was) was delicious! Flavorful to the point some may find it too salty. It's salmon and expected to be a little salty, but just an FYI! All in all, it's worth the ap12! I'm stuffed!
- Italian crepe. Tempting second choice as it has prosciutto on top, but it was surprisingly low in the flavor department. (Maybe it's cause I ate it after the amazing salmon crepe.) It you want something a little lighter in flavor it's the way to go.
- berry crepe. Looks amazing. But in all

So, in typical Vegas fashion, I decided to go big or go home.

There's no better place to seriously indulge one's craving for sweets than Jean Philippe in the Bellagio, and there's no better way to indulge one's craving for sweets than Jean Philippe's pastry sampler.

For about $9, I was able to taste 3 of Jean Philippe's sublime dessert creations.  After taking a gander at the world's largest chocolate fountain (natch) and waiting in line for less than 5 minutes, I had in my hand a plate of the following:

** A raspberry macaron stuffed with fresh raspberries and cream and dusted with powdered sugar.  I admit that I'm still a newbie in the world of macarons, but this macaron was delightful.  It had a beautiful chew -- not too tough or crumbly -- which played nicely with the juicy berries.

** A chocolate, peanut butter, and hazelnut-filled cake lollipop.  This little package of bliss is as sinfully sweet and decadent as it sounds.  Another home run.

** Crème brûlée.  As much as I adored the macaron and the lollipop, the crème brûlée was by far my favorite.  While I have a history of tasting some underwhelming crème brûlées -- whose burnt sugar top-layers taste like charcoal -- Jean Philippe manages to turn the crème brûlée top into a pristine pane of sugary glass.  It's absolutely miraculous to look at, and transcendent in both taste and texture.  The vanilla cream itself is also executed with care and skill.

As if these three desserts weren't enough -- they were all artfully placed on a base of pure milk chocolate.  

Yeah, we finished all of it -- including the chocolate base.  

(Don't judge.)

Needless to say, my sweet tooth was satisfied.

All of Jean Philippe's sugar-laden works of art are brilliant.   Next time, I want to try try Jean Philippe's crêpes and gelato.  Heck, I'll try anything Chef Philippe comes up with.",0C65lVj_ujVYDs7b2yYBAA,7,6,5,BedhFfGtQV1IY28UvTNXSA

The croissant was brushed with a thin layer of sweet glaze but the glaze didn't overwhelm the light and buttery layers.

There are two locations that my husband and I have been to, the location in the Bellagio with the streaming chocolate fountain from the ceiling and the location in Aria. 

We prefer the location in Aria since it is a larger location and has tons more seating. The Bellagio location is cramped with very little seating. But both locations have their draw so if you have the chance, visit both!

The patisserie offers an array of items from donuts, to crepes, to ice cream to coffee/espresso to gourmet sandwiches. I haven't had a sandwich from here, but we can attest to the desserts and coffee. Magnificent. Everything looks fake in the pastry cabinets! They're all so perfectly displayed.

The patisserie also offers pre-boxed confections that we've also purchased to bring home. They keep well and have traveled with us back to Florida without any issue.

I'm deducting one star because of their ordering process. They have different ordering counters for different items. One counter for crepes, one for coffee and desserts, one for ice cream etc. etc. And while this does make sense to break up the crowd, most people don't realize what they're doing and tend to stand around clogging up the main entrance.

The Nutella Brioche also wasn't very impressive. There's tons of Nutella stuffed inside which is never a bad thing, but the brioche was kind of hard and pretty dry. It was also missing that strong buttery flavor which makes a good brioche so enjoyable.

The food was magnificent. 

1. Exotic Soufflé-Style Crepe: I've never had a dish like this before. My mind and taste buds were completely blown away by the combination of the warm crepe, tart pineapple/mango/passion fruits, and refreshing coconut sorbet.
Tip: Get this instead of the exotic crepe, which is more dry and bland because the crepe has no filling. 

2. Veggie Wrap: As common as veggie wraps are, this one stood out. The sauce was absolutely amazing. 

The ambiance was magical. It took us a while to get out food, but that was no issue for us.  We watched different types of chocolate flow down into glass plates and create the world's tallest chocolate fountain. We admired a statue of a lady whose dress was made out of fondant.

Brief Summary
-- In the very busy Bellagio
-- World's largest chocolate fountain (and coolest)
-- A lot of different items on their menu
-- Snickers Cake = O-M-G Delicious
-- Yummy 1/2 chocolate/white chocolate covered strawberries

What doesn't this place have?! On one side you have desserts and the other side you have all different types of food, coffee, and beverages. In addition to gelato and crepes, they have a vast selection of pre-packaged items ranging from chocolate to cookies to rock candy.

We ended up getting 2 strawberries dipped in 1/2 chocolate/white chocolate, a snickers cake and the napoleon. The chocolate was good and the strawberries were ripe and delicious. The GF liked her Napoleon. She says it was light and not too sweet. It's basically like a vanilla cream wafer type dessert with a cookie on top? I didn't try it myself.

The winner for me was my Snickers cake. Caramel chocolate wrapped in a hardened chocolate cylinder. topped with some really tasty, toasted almonds and a weird marshmallow. It was awesome! It tasted similar to a Snickers but more refined and way lighter but so delicious.

The H&C was delish! Buttery croissant with baked cheese on the outside, and white cheese and ham on the inside. Quite good!
The almond brioche was just okay, again, very buttery.
Strawberry rice krispy was yummy, the strawberry flavor didn't taste artificial at all!
Side note: the individual bags the pastries were in soaked through completely.. which means.. extreme oil!

I don't know what I was thinking, but I didn't order a crepe or purchase any of their chocolates :\ the line for a crepe alone looked long.. but they smelled so good! Next time I'm here, totally going for a crepe even if it's a 30 min wait.

Long lines, which was expected, but was chaotic and confusing, because several people were being helped at once, depending if they were getting gelato or asking for a dessert. And then all those people taking pictures of the extensive chocolate fountain. I fought my way to the front, and ordered. Not sure if I was cutting anybody, but ah well. Food is a cutthroat business! 

Lemon meringue tart- way too much meringue to tart ratio, although it was very cute and visually appealing. And my husband said there was some strawberry/red fruit thing at the bottom, after he ate the lemon and meringue. Not sure if it was a fluke, but this was one lemon tart he did not enjoy! 

Fruit tart -- This tart I enjoyed a lot more compared to the old stale one from Cafe Madeleine at Paris. This had a smoother, creamier custard that I was hoping for, and a light crust that could hold the cream/fruit, but also be broken easily with my spoon. Very tasty. 

Also sold fruit platters, coffee/tea, OJ, crepes, and sandwiches, but the sandwiches didn't seem that appealing. The big draw here were the desserts and gelato. And endless boxes of chocolates on display on nearly every wall of the place. 

Expensive, but stay on the strip long enough, and the high prices don't seem that surprising anymore! Extremely limited in seating, and the few tables they do have seem to be pushed against the walls, probably to make room for the people moving around the store looking at the boxes or bags of chocolates.

Apple brioche - Fresh, and taste, not too sweet, and a good density.  (It's kinda like a quiche)
Cheese Danish - Also very good and tasty...nothing out of the ordinary.
Almond croissant - didn't think I would like this one, but also VERY good and crumbly too, he he.

My sis and I ordered both a savory and sweet crepe. We ordered the Royal crepe (grilled chicken, sauteed mushrooms, bacon and cheddar cheese) and it was just ok to me. The crepe itself was some sort of wheat crepe that we weren't a fan of. We barely got any pieces of mushrooms and it was actually too creamy for me. 

We were on a time crunch so we ordered the Exotic crepe to go. However they forgot that we ordered it to go but just added a top to cover it for us. We tasted a little bit of it before we headed out. All of the fruit with the sauce was delicious. The coconut sorbet was really good too and had tons of coconut flakes. Unfortunately they didn't pack the sorbet separately so by the time we got to the car it was a melted mess. 

I also ordered an iced caramel macchiato and that I liked a lot. All three items were a little over $25 before tax and tip.

You might wonder how I could say that about a place that is far from inexpensive.  But dollar for dollar, I felt my money was well spent at Jean Philippe Patisserie. The $27 I spent on two crepes and a cafe au lait gave me more deliciousness and quality than any other meal I purchased in town.  

Breakfast is phenomenal here. Nutella brioche? Yes, please. Paired with a well-made cafe au lait, it made early mornings a lot easier.  Excellent bread filled with rich Nutella cream was a decadent way to start the day.  The wild blueberry tart (which they called brioche but I disagree) was good as well.

Crepes are so good. The savory crepes are made Breton-style with buckwheat.  The mushrooms in my egg crepe were incredibly flavorful, a mixture of crimini and portabella that was lovely.

I picked up some chocolates as gifts and tried a truffle myself. Rich, creamy chocolate was just right.

Insider tip: look at the menu before you get in line. The line snakes around the shop, and they'll ask for you order before you can see the pastry selection, and the crepe menu can only be read if you are standing outside the shop in front of the crepe station.

Pistachio - the same feeling here, crusty, just off.

However, the prices are reasonable, and for what you get it is worth every penny. The only downside to Jean Philippe's is that it can get pretty crowded due to its fame. If you want to beat the crowds I have found that the best time to go is around 2:45pm. If you do happen to catch the crowd don't sweat it, it is worth the wait.",W0VE9M7Dikrpol8j1_QqyQ,3,0,5,SR6-OPmRw2-Sab5p7q7ZPw

Its a long walk from the valet into Aria to Jean Philippe Patisserie. My daughter recommended this place. No surprise after reading the reviews. I come from fairly humble beginnings. One thing that I did have growing up was a vicious sweet tooth. If Patisserie means high priced French Desserts, Then I found it. The ice cream, cinnamon rolls and pastry all tasted Ok. I guess thats the problem. The sweets here are no better than what can be found in a Albertsons, Smiths or Vons markets. There I said it. The prices at Jean Phillipe are off the chart ridiculous. I can think of 100 places I have eaten and got better. Its a stupid philosophy to impress friends by treating them to desserts that aren't worth the money, I wish I had bought it before hand. repacked in nice containers and served it in the limo with the champaign and cider we had.

I stopped a couple of times during my conference for a quick bite and in general, thought the food was decent. 

What isn't decent? Their ability to handle crowds/lines. It's a tiny space, lines always seem to be crazy long and they are slllllloooooooww. Disorganized too - there are a bunch of people behind the counter but they seem to be stumbling all over each other and not really getting people through the line. My real issue is that they know AM's are busy, yet everyone has to wait in the big line because there's only one register open. Why not open a second line for those who just want a muffin and a non-fancy coffee? That would speed it up for sure. 

Of course, when I pass by at night and there isn't a soul waiting, they have like three registers open. Great planning, right there. Also, I stopped when it wasn't busy and was told it would be 1/2 hour for a crepe - hard pass.

We watched the video of how their lovely desserts were created and how one can wish they had the skills (and tools) to make such lovely treats at home.

As the workers, in their cute little uniforms, cleaned up and closed up shop, they didn't scoot us out at all.  I appreciated that they addressed my questions about their cakes ($3000 for about 100 servings for that pink cake) without batting an eye or appearing annoyed.

We dined here at 11am today. My wife had a salmon crepe, so did my mother. I had a ham & cheese pannini. Then we drove back to LA on a 6 hour drive.

Some two hours later on the road, both my wife and my mother felt sick and had stomach cramps. The sickness and pain intensified and was at its peak sometime around 6pm. While my mother felt better by 8pm, my wife crashed on the sofa and got up at 10pm only to vomit. 

I apologize for graphic details but the point of this review is to alert the management to immediately check the quality and freshness of their products.

I believe the salmon (which looked quite pale and was surely farm-raised) was not fresh. It could have also been the mayonnaise (or mustard mixed with it), or combination of both. I felt a strange metallic taste on my tongue when I was eating my own panini sandwich, which also did contain the mustard/mayo mix. In fact I still feel the strange taste in all of my mouth now as I write this at 10:30pm.

Dear management, please check the freshness of your produce, or the temperature in your fridge, or vendors you use, as our group poisonning COULD NOT have been a coincidence. 

I must also add that the personnel was noticeably nervous and irritated (and this is NO judgement but merely an observation). If they worked over NY holiday and had no chance to rest this could explain their cranky attitude. To say the least, this did not help the painful food experience at all.

I wanted to buy some macarons for a friend as an early birthday gift because she'd never had the macarons from this bakery before. And, knowing her to be a macaron connoisseur, I had to oblige and buy her a box. Because that's just not right to not have sampled all that is available to be had. I bought a box of 8 macarons and delivered them to the birthday girl.

We didn't actually eat them for a couple of days. They were surprisingly still fresh -- flaky cookie and soft insides. We tried the pistachio flavor. I wouldn't say that it was bad, but it also wasn't mind-blowing either. It was a solidly average macaron. I didn't get to try the other flavors, but I can only assume that they're probably about the same. A little sad, but I guess not every macaron can live up to be absolutely amazing.

Boyfriend and I also bought a Nutella Brioche to share. The brioche was very light and very yummy, but it was the Nutella innards that made this treat.

Bro and BF got gelatos and chocolates. Took a bite of their pistachio- nice actually, robust pistachio flavor.

We got a crepe with just custard and chocolate and chocolates and a raspberry tart BF wanted to try as well. Crepe was good, I like that the chocolate wasn't overtly sweet milk chocolate, more like a milk and dark cross, but I don't think it was priced right for what it is. I spend a lot on desserts, but it's just a crepe. Chocolates good, I liked the coconut which I normally don't but it was subtle. Tart- Alright, there was a pistachio like cream on the bottom and it was nice, but the tart itself was kinda hard, berries were fresh and sweet. 

Got teas to compliment.- A-OK- just got standard greens, but were all premium tea drinkers and it doesnt wow like some of the selection at home (NO ready made tea bags, fine tea leaves).

They were yummy, but not like OMG Imma effing die this soo goood.  It was satisfying enough to curb our after dinner sweet toofs. 

One big shtick I got about this place is that its circular layout makes it eye pleasing but it makes it a clusterfuck when it's busy. People just don't know where to go, they cut cuz they don't get if there's a line. Also since we were getting stuff from all their stations it was frustrating- the chocolate lady told us to order crepes from the crepes, and go to coffee to get our drinks, etc.....WTH?! Can't you ring up and charge us and ticket them our order to make?! I dont think she knew really what theyre doing....surely you dont have to line up 4 times, but whatever we just figured it's easier to split up and not confuse that lady even more.  Yeah, we 4 split up and lined up in each area. BF went to gelato, I got the crepe, brother got the chocolates and BF got teas. Crepe customers vicious, I had to tell someone to step off their order because they helped themselves to the front of the line. 

Maybe I'll try it again if I'm here or Aria when it's not busy, but by all means I will walk by and forget it if it's a busy cluster. Desserts good but not worth having to tagteam to hit all the stations again.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,3,2,3,a8N2qxL_ESP9Nf9PYB8NQw

The one thing that I had seen from Jean Phillipe was their world record chocolate fountain, only I didn't know that that's where it was. However, the sheer selection of pastries and sweet treats won me over much more than the chocolate fountain. As soon as you approach the shop, it's goodies as far as the eye can see! Well, the shop isn't that huge, to be honest, but dang if they didn't make great use of the space in there. 

Even with all of the different choices they had in there, though, we went for the croissants, and what a quality decision that was! We got a regular croissant and an almond croissant, but the almond variation completely stole the show for me. It was the sweetest, most decadent croissant I'd ever had, and I loved it.

Every year for about three years running now, my husband and I go with the rest of my family to Las Vegas just to get away for a week. 

We do a variety of things. We usually include a Cirque show in there and do the Tournament of Kings, but my husband and I have made it a tradition to always go to this particular JPP in the Bellagio and purchase treats for everyone to share. We usually get four or five of the treats, sit down with a JPP coffee and eat them. 

The only thing that I'd say is a downer is the fact that the drinks are far overprice. I understand why the desserts would be 7$ (they are) but, a tropical smoothie is 9$...

I'm definitely not a shredded coconut lover, but his coconut gelato converted me!  The intense coconut flavor is simply heavenly, best gelato ever!

They have both sweet and savory crepes, gelato, beautiful desserts, pastries, cold sandwiches, hot paninis, and coffees. They also sell chocolates, candies, and other goodies that you can bring home or give as gifts.

I tried the Chicken crepe (savory) and the Exotic Souffle crepe (sweet) and was much more satisfied with the Chicken crepe, which had chicken, spinach, roasted red peppers, and a really delicious dressing. (I think there was probably more but I wolfed it down too quickly to notice all of the individual ingredients.) The Exotic Souffle crepe was basically a crepe with some melted vanilla cream inside (straight from the refrigerator), topped with a mango/pineapple sauce that was a bit too sour and used fruit that wasn't ripe enough yet, and a scoop of coconut sherbet. 

The sweet crepes seem to be the most popular; there's often a crowd waiting in front of the crepe-making area. However, I think the savory crepes are more worth it than the sweet crepes, which are simpler to make (generally, Nutella and maybe some raw fruit). The savory crepes are much more filling and delicious!

I also tried the salmon sandwich, and it was quite good, though expensive (like most other things at the Patisserie). I tried one of the pastries, an almond croissant, which was amazing! It was pretty different from your average croissant; the bottom layer of it was really moist and soooo good.

The drinks are not really worth it... $5 for a small latte that tastes pretty average, $4 for a plain iced coffee that tastes pretty dilute... Stick with the desserts and non-drinks!",pYQ0ndyhHZ43CYXSFbL_6A,1,1,4,2uGR39uWPdgKHpvU0i39QQ

It's apparently it's the largest chocolate fountain and is even in the Guiness Book for World Records. It goes from the ceiling to the ground, but it's made up of a bunch of small shelves and the chocolate travels in different paths. There's a dark chocolate path, milk chocolate, and white chocolate, and they intertwine kind of, but they never mix. I thought it was a cool design. It's pretty awesome, and people would just stop walking when they saw it and pulled out their cameras. It was fun people-watching here too. After looking around the shop for a bit, we decided to get a crepe and some cakes. My friend made a good decision and got an ""exotic"" crepe? or something like that... it was reallllly good. The top was warm mango in a mango syrup, and the ice cream was coconut. It was super super SUPER good. Inside I think she said was some kind of berry jam or something? I'm not really sure, but the crepe was delicious. The coconut ice cream was SUPER coconuty and really really good. Twas my favorite part. We also got two different types of cakes. The first one we got was called Opera and it was like a 12-layer cake with all kinds of chocolate and coffee flavors. Oh man, I cannot describe to you how delicious this cake was. It was SO SO SO SO SO GOOD. I even ate the gold on top. The dark chocolate on top was super rich, but the layers were so moist and flavorful. Each layer was something new, so my mouth never got tired of eating it. The truffle on top was decent too, but the cake was the main attraction. So delicious. When I go back here, I'm going to have a hard time not ordering this again even though I want to try all the different cakes there. The last cake we got there, I can't remember what it was called, but it was chocolate mousse with hazelnut and banana flavors. The bottom actually seemed like it had very small pieces of banana in it. It was really good, a lot more refreshing than the chocolate one, a lot less rich, but still really really good. They used a carmelized banana on the top too. Not sure how they made it red, we think maybe just like a red cocoa powder? All the desserts we got there were really good -- my goal is to come back here each time and try all the different cakes there, because there were just so many I wanted to try.

Let me tell you...you are DEFINITELY better off getting a crepe off the menu for ~$11. Making your own crepe is $16 and all I got was nutella, strawberry, and walnuts. There are other crepes that have five items in it and it costs ~$11. I don't get it, even for the Bellagio in Vegas, I see no logic.

The crepe itself was extremely sweet and huge! I needed some coffee or something afterwards. Inside the crepe was the nutella, outside the crepe was topped with strawberries, walnuts, more nutella, and whipped cream on the side. WHOO. Sweet overload. It was good, but so not worth the $16.

[3] Don't presume that I want my dessert for here, just to give me the stink eye when I ask you to box it up, smashing my macarons in the process.

At any rate, the macaron with rose infused cream is delicious. It gets soggy at the bottom, though. So you probably want to chill it at your room if you can.

My girlfriend got the raspberry cake with pistachio cream and she enjoyed that as well.

I also got a pack of four macarons which cost $8. They were delicious, however, and my girlfriend who normally doesn't like macarons enjoyed them as well.

I was really surprised by the way the crepe came out at first because I was so used to the ones in Houston where the crepes are filled with all the fruits, but this crepe had all the fruits on top of the crepe instead of inside it. The crepe was a nice soft texture and the fruits provided a nice tart flavor. I liked the sweet creamy coconut sorbet most.

After a friend and my mother had recommended this place, I decided to swing by since both generally have good taste in food. OMG. AMAZING!

First off, this place is awesome to look at - they have a chocolate fountain that runs along the wall and a counter that wraps around their pastry selections - all options looking decadent and sinful. 

This place was so good, I came here twice. The first time for lunch and the second time for breakfast.

For lunch, I had a turkey crepe with spinach, cream sauce, and parmesan. While I didn't realize that this crepe would be creamy, it was so good, I didn't care what it had in it. It came with a great salad with some kind of creamy balsamic dressing on it - all insanely good. My husband ordered the same thing and we were both extremely happy with our choice.

The next time for breakfast, I had Quiche Lorrraine and my husband had a breakfast panini. My quiche was really good - it was unsettling how much grease it appeared to have on it, but when you were eating it, it didn't detract from the taste. Sadly, it made it way better. My husband seemed to like his breakfast sandwich, too. 

Out of all food options at the Bellagio, this one has the best value out of them all. Hands down. Come here often and you won't regret it!",GYoYKIlYfxh7JmEReCxIig,0,0,4,xsvQ9lc4u1xK6gQnXC-Riw

It was beautifully topped off with a sugar coated rose petal. It was almost too beautiful to eat...I said ALMOST. The raspberries were fresh, the rose water cream was rich and silky smooth and the raspberry macaron itself had a perfect texture.

Nutella brioche - Sooooo good. It's a brioche dusted in powdered sugar and filled with nutella. How can you go wrong there??

Nutella crepe - Good. I mean, it's a Nutella crepe. It's not as good as the ones I've had in France, but it's the best I've had in the US, so no complaints. I'd order it again since I'm addicted to all things Nutella.

Royal crepe - Good if you like creamy savory crepes. I probably wouldn't order it again just so that I could try more sweet crepes, but I recommend it to those who prefer savory.

Pain au chocolate - TO DIE FOR. It's everything a pain au chocolate should be. The croissant is flaky, buttery perfection, and there's just the right amount of chocolate in it!

Not a fan of the crepes here. I tried a savory one with ham/spinach/mushroom/cheese and it had WAY too much ham in there. I guess Vegas is all about excess....but sometimes less is more! 

Another downer is that I found the workers there are just always in a rush to get through the line which makes it not as charming as it could've been....

Overall, I found cake/pastries divine and would definitely come back and try them all!",PeJiuO269xsgS3WlYE2u_w,0,0,4,dWsl-d5q0H8UvGJRPs8hlA

I would highly recommend the crepes. I liked the ""gelato"" but I wouldn't really consider it gelato..it's more like ice cream with stronger flavors. If you want Italian gelato then you can find it at the Venetian or Palazzo.

However, their crepes are super soft and yummy. And they have the cutest little dessert cakes. Prices are around $6 each for those though and the crepes are about $6-$11...more on the pricier end for sure..but what do you expect in Vegas?",ibvH1Y7Rh_tstiWgH0OFTA,0,0,4,iXucE4x2dAfqBFi8sEOQdw

They are always busy so even at 10 in the night expect a big line. Ordering a bit confusing as there are multiple payment stations placed around a circular counter so you need to know what you want and then queue up in the right line.

During my first visit I decided to kick things off by getting some gelato. They have a bunch of flavors that look good so I wanted to try a couple before deciding but looking at the large line behind me I decided against it. I was certainly not offered any samples as I stared at the display case nor did I see the customary containers for dumping used spoons that are placed on top of the display counter, so I'm not sure if they hand out samples. Anyway I decided to go old school and get a scoop of stracciatella (which is a fancy name for vanilla and chocolate chips). 

Taste-wise it was good but it lacked the silky texture of gelato. This gelato has to be the closet to ice-cream that I've ever had. If they could somehow keep their flavors intact but get the texture and consistency of gelato from Cafe Gelato it would be the best gelato in the world. Anyway I am not a purist and I like ice-cream as much as I like gelato so I enjoyed it a lot. During subsequent visits I came back and tried some more flavors that I don't recollect and found them all to be good but not great.

Pricewise it is in-line with what you will pay at other similar places on the strip (Large Gelato around $6, Pastries around $8 and crepes around $11).

When we asked why the people far behind us had gotten their ham and cheese omelette before us, the woman at the register apologized and said orders sometimes get mixed up when they get busy. OK, but sorry, the price for a small 2-egg omelette and a single slice of in buttered toast should have been comped or at least offered at a discount for the unreasonable wait.

Anyway, I had tried to come here for a crepe or breakfast, but the place was always very busy and the line was always crazy long.....so I skipped it. Then on the way back to my room after dinner, there was no line.....and the sorbets looked pretty yummy and seemed to be a perfect after dinner finish.....so I went ahead and ordered the mango sorbet......I tried to get a mix of 2 flavors....mango and coconut, but they're treated just as though you're ordering 2 separate scoops.....and each scoop in a cup came to more than $5 each....ok, this is Vegas, at the swanky Bellagio, and this is some fancy French dessert place, so these prices should be expected. 

Hmmm, the sorbet actually tasted like fresh mangoes were used to make it, but the sour'ish type.....however, I thought it was really sweet!!!......a bit too sweet for my taste......I'm sure I got a sugar spike after the second scoop. 

The other thing I noticed about this place is that while they have a good selection of coffees, I didn't notice any decent tea offerings on the menu....all I saw was chai tea? I ended going to Starbucks all the way at the other end of the hotel.

Nice place....definitely worth checking out....and I will try to get me a crepe one of these days when the line's not too long.



***** Next day: at the urging of my friend, we returned for breakfast the next morning and decided to get in the line to see what all the buzz was all about.....it took us about 12-15 minutes to get from the end of the line to where they started taking orders around the other side where the pastries/sandwiches were.....then you keep following the lline to the cashier, pass them your order, and just wait for your food.....it's all take away style. Warning.....there's usually a long wait for crepes and omelettes as there only two crepe hot plates and it takes time to make....especially when there are so many orders before yours.....so be prepared for another long wait yet again. 

We ordered the veggie omelette, chicken crepe, a cup of mixed fruit, a croissant....coffee and TEA! In my initial review I didn't notice the tea selection because it was only on the overhead screen angled toward the inside so it's not visible from the outside....I only saw it once I reached the pastry/sandwich display side.

Anyway, we thoroughly enjoyed the very yummy omelette which came with a skewer of melon and whole wheat toast.....but it tasted wonderfully with their freshly baked, finely crisp and light and fluffy inside croissant. The chicken crepe was delicious too......so now we got a taste of what all the buzz was about and will most likely be back again for sure. Oh, the almond croissants looked oh so good!

They sell crepes, fresh salads, delicious cakes, pastries, paninis sandwiches, & gelato. They also sell drinks like coffee, tea, hot cocoa, & soft drinks. 
Looking for a gift for a friend or loved one? They got that too, as they have pre-packaged gifts.

I must say the coffee that they serve at Jean Philippe Patisserie is very rich & flavorful, and can easily rival any Starbucks, Peets, Philz, Seattle's Best, or any other designer coffee joint.

The shop is very bright looking & clean. At times this store can get really busy with long lines, but lucky for me on the day I came here, it wasn't overly busy, so I was able to get my coffee & was in and out in no time.

Food: 5

Croissant was flaky on the outside and fluffy on the inside. It doesn't taste overwhelmingly of butter, which I prefer, but it might not be right for those who want a super buttery croissant.

Unsweetened Blueberry Muffin was packed with blueberries and just the right amount of sweetness for a morning muffin. If you have a serious sweet tooth, get the regular one.

Gelato & Sorbet: We got a double scoop of Rocky Road and Unsweetened Strawberry Sorbet in a cone. The Rocky Road was intensely chocolatey and contained brownie bites and marshmallow. I'm not a fan of marshmallow normally, but I thought it was nice in the gelato. However, this is definitely a super sweet choice, so I suggest you balance it with something less sweet. In our case, the sorbet was perfect with its tartness.

Service: 3.5

The staff member who helped us with our gelato order was super nice and very patient with all of our requests. She didn't mind letting us try a bunch of flavors, and she gave us an extra cup because we got a double scoop on a cone. However, the staff member who helped us with our pastry order did give us some attitude. My mom requested a different croissant from the one that he originally grabbed for us, and he aggressively dumped the old croissant back into display.

The pastry display is pretty impress. As it should be since it's in the Bellagio. 

We had the Vanilla Neopolean and chocolate chip ice cream.  They were both pretty good, but not $16 good.  If I were to shave off a Hershey's chocolate bar and mix it with vanilla ice cream. I'd charge $2.50 for a double scoop.  That's pretty much what it tasted like.  Just because the add a name to the chocolate, making it a designer chocolate is a complete fraud.  

Can't blame the staff, they just do what their told, but the price is atrocious!  Oh yeah that too, they don't put a price on the items.  So it's all a complete surprise, but if you do manage to get any attention and ask for a price, they staff does looked bothered. 

Just count your loses and eat the chocolate whatever's and enjoy the money you just spent on it. Other worse save your money and buy a gallon thrifty ice cream and a Hershey bar and make your own chocolate chip for a whopping $4.50.

Full disclosure, I didn't get to taste any of the bakery items or gelatos as I have an egg allergy and those items all contain egg, so this is based largely on the chocolate and coffee.

The chocolate is decent--they use Valrhona chocolate as the base on the smaller chocolates that I had, so you know that's going to be nice for pretty much any chocolate fan. A fellow customer recommended the chocolate coffee beans, which are chocolates shaped like little coffee beans and flavored with coffee, too. The coffee, however, seems a little off in flavor. Mr. Piano had a crepe and liked it, however, so it might just be that everything that they do well is the stuff with egg in it that I can't have. I'm also a little appalled by the miniscule $8 cup of fresh carrot juice? Did I misread that somehow? I know Vegas is expensive, but dang...

We were there near Halloween, so the décor had that theme going on, and I have to say, the presentation of both the decorative confections and the actual sale confections is really great! Everything looks fantastic--and at those prices, they had better be. The place is fantastic as a spectacle and visual treat, for sure, even if what I was able to have did not live up to any hype. Also, it would have been nice if the workers had a little more knowledge of what did or did not definitely have certain allergens in it (and if the gelato worker was a little less dismissive).

The gelato is good, but not in the same league as the pastries.  There are also crepes, breakfast pastries, and chocolate.

I had read some amazing reviews about Jean Philippe Patisserie, so I HAD to come here on my recent visit to Vegas this past weekend.

It is located in the Bellagio hotel, just a little bit past the Conservatory & Botanical Gardens. There are signs pointing towards which direction it is located in!

I was actually pretty surprised at how small this place was. I had envisioned to be a full bakery/patisserie with tons of cute little cafe tables/chairs and whatnot, but that wasn't the case. It's like a circular area with the employees/staff all in the middle, and you kinda just walk around the counter to look at all of the pastries, gelato, sandwiches, etc.

One wall has the famous chocolate fountain, which honestly...was not as big as I had pictured. When people said it's the ""biggest chocolate fountain in the world"" I was thinking like straight up Willy Wonka status. This was totally not the case! Granted, it was a really nice glass display and I really liked that they had dark, milk, and white chocolate pouring in it, but I didn't think it was as mindblowing as I had expected it to be.

Along the circular walls they have a bunch of packaged goodies like chocolates, candies, hot chocolate mix, etc. They also have some fake cakes on display. I'm not sure if they actually bake fancy cakes here, but the displays were nice!

Unfortunately I had just eaten lunch and wasn't hungry at all, so I didn't any of the pastries although I had REALLY wanted to try some of them out! They didn't have a HUGE selection but some of them looked very tasty! I ended up getting a scoop of the dulce de leche gelato ($3+), and the Jean Philippe vanilla hot chocolate mix ($18).

The gelato was ok to me. Presentation wasn't the nicest, and also it was really soft...like to the point where it was basically melting! Gross. I wasn't impressed.

I made the hot chocolate mix when I came home, and I must say, this stuff is INCREDIBLE. It reminds me of the hot chocolate at Churros Calientes in Los Angeles. Super thick, rich, and decadent. omg, it is incredible. I'm glad it turned out well because $18 for only a few cups of hot chocolate was pretty pricey! Even more than Godiva and some other high end chocolate brands.

Overall, I liked Jean Philippe but I wasn't as blown away as I thought I was going to be. I definitely would return to actually try some of their pastries and maybe even their crepes (which are supposed to be amazing). 3 stars!",Wd4FRRD30avk-Mj6C_O2ow,42,38,3,neyqKO9GDC3F0FGll88T-w

You can buy some chocolate confections to take back home with you. But make sure you don't walk on the strip while it's hot outside or it will melt. 

It's the home of the worlds largest chocolate fountain. Employees are on top of their game in the fast paced environment. It's always super busy here. So pack you're patients ok. The place is not very large so deal with it. Just enjoy what's around you. You can order a custom cake also.",5G7SuKXxeVPXC1_AiqM8vQ,1,1,5,-HNv24ft9KMwvTJU6CMqyQ

I woke up super hungover that morning and really really really wanted some ice cream so we Yelped ""ice cream"" and randomly picked whatever came up and looked good. We figured in this place is in the Bellagio so it had to be good XD 

This place has really cool décor. There was a huge chocolate fountain and many other statues--definitely an attraction for the kids!

The ice cream was pretty awful... For some reason it melted super quickly...even though we stayed indoors and it was pretty cold indoors. I think it has to do with Jean Philippe because I saw the server take out a tray of Cookies and Cream ice cream and it was already melting. The ice cream itself was alright--it was creamy but the flavors were average. Pretty disappointing, actually. Either way, I got my ice cream fix that day and I was a happy camper :P",A06QtUzeJSiDW6MSWp3Jdg,5,0,2,9CcBNSL0Z7FpR-5GSMVTlA

___________________________________

DATE/TIME: Saturday, March 30, 2013 // 6:15pm

PRICE: +/- $10/crepe, $4/donut.
VALUE: A bit pricey, which increases expectations a bit.
AMBIANCE: This branch is somewhat smaller than the one at the Aria, and due to it's circular set-up, can be a little confusing. For crepes, you get in the line to the left hand side when facing the store, order your crepes, then wait for your name to be called out. Seating is not directly within the Jean Philippe and looks a bit like somewhat outdated Bellagio-themed random tables and chairs, unlike the modern set-up at the Aria location. There is, in fact, a chocolate fountain.
SERVICE: A bit on the slow side.
CHANCE OF RETURNING: 40% (I prefer Aria's)

Unfortunately, while this one clearly had more calories and was very tasty, it was just not *as* good, surprisingly. The banana foster itself was so runny that it made the crepes soggy, and had a rather strong flavor.]

Not too sweet and very rich. It costed almost seven dollars. You get a cute plastic plate and a gold plastic fork. Expect awful service. There are several lines, all of which is for a specific purpose. You start off in one line to order then you go to another to pay. The girls behind the counter are young and inexperienced. As we finished eating the last bite of our dessert, one of the young girls came over to our table which is rather far away from the patisserie itself, apologized and swiped everything off the table.  I didn't even get a chance to wipe my mouth with the napkin. She threw it away before we even had a chance to clean up.

I love their white chocolate mocha, but it was $7 a cup. As a daily coffee consumer who drinks Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf, $7 is definitely a bit of a splurge.

If you're stopping by Jean Phillippe, whether here at the Aria or the Bellagio, I recommend their gelato. I've only tried the strawberry and coconut, but I'm determined to try them all. The texture is unlike any other gelato I've ever had. So smooth and milky!

Their selection of cookies are good too, but a small package is like ~$18. Still, their sweets are delectable and the exquisite packaging would make fantastic gifts!",QRhZChDuwfBbuhqIazv5jA,0,0,4,BRE_vWgll6vdx2BXZiij0w

My first experience was their coffee, amazing drip and amazing mocha's. So I had to try their other items. What got me was their crepes. Simple I know, the best is the Nutella crepe. I have had this many times from many other places. Jean Philippe by far dominates all the chocolatiering newbs! 

They use the most perfect batter, firm yet chewy, soft and delicate. They top this warm gooeyness with fresh scratch made whip cream! The mixture of the crepe with the warm hazelnut chocolate smothered in cool freshly made cream is to die for! 

This is food porn at its best. We loved this place so much we bought a box full of Jean Philippe goodies to take home to family and friends. This is now one of my first and last Vegas stops!",tRBazUwnbucERsEaarXZOQ,2,1,5,FHBj6nQjbjIZVei6WoQ1eg

Of course we all pulled out our phones and started snapping a ton of pics. The chocolate fountain was amazing and who knew you'd be able to view a Guinness Record at the Bellagio? We were with a group of friends and after mulling it over for what felt like an eternity we decided on a few to share.

I tried the vegetable crepe, which I wasn't the biggest fan of, but it wasn't bad either. I'm not sure if I didn't like the buckwheat crepe part of it, or the filling- I still ate it and enjoyed it... just don't think it was the best.

Coffee- delicious. I just had regular coffee. A friend had the caramel iced coffee (I can't remember the name, but it's on the menu) and said it was a bit sweet but good.

Quiches - delicious! I had the asparagus one and a friend had Lorraine (twice each) - really good and tastes fresh!

Sandwiches - I had the caprese once and although the sauce is a bit oily, it was wonderful to have while hungover at the pool. 

Blueberry muffin - moist and delicious and fresh! 

Unfortunately I didn't try the most mouthwatering items on display - the DESSERTS!!
