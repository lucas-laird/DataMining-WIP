We ordered the Scallop Po Boy, Pulled  BBQ Jackfruit Sandwich, and Fried Chicken sandwich, all with sides of Baked Beans and Cole Slaw.  The slaw seemed to be made to order, which left it unseasoned and a little bland; fresh though.   With the name Amber's smoked Vegan, we were hoping to get a smoky flavor in our meal somewhere; hoping it was in the baked beans.   They were fresh tasting, but, unfortunately, not smoky and they were a bit bland for our liking.   On the the sandwiches.    The Po Boy was excellent.   We did add more sauce and pickles to it when we got home - the roll was huge, so it needed a lot of food to fill it.   The ""scallops"", which were lightly fried hearts of palm were INCREDIBLE!   I wanted more!   yum!    The fried chicken sandwich looked amazing, but went straight into the garbage, disappointingly.   It looked gorgeous and delicious.   The texture of the patty was not a good one for our palates.  It was sort of a deep fried mass.  (I'm so sorry).    Third item was the BBQ Jackfruit.  The sauce was good.  The sandwich was good, not great..Jackfruit can be so tricky.    We loved that the bun was gluten free, but they tend to fall apart, making this sandwich kind of hard to eat.    So, overall, a great effort and all of the other folks in line were super excited for a new vegan spot.   I would definitely get the Scallop Po Boy again, but not the others.   I want to give it another try, as I love the concept; just not sure if for the price, we will make it back.   We certainly hope this review helps - as we want this place to succeed and grow our Las Vegas vegan options.",q0upq-lhMtaIFBoEra1QSA,0,0,3,2nSA4pSd0Nh4YN75Hl8JYg
1255430,2018-06-27,1,4LhURdgGRofYSR_1LBTXvQ,"I love the idea of this place! 
Sadly, The actual experience was kind of mixed.

If you are a omnivore and are looking for a gateway to vegetarian cuisine, this place might do it for you. 

To me, The food was neither serious  barbecue, nor great vegan cooking. Rather, it occupies the strange middle ground of *products that pretend to be meat.* 

In many cultures, meat is typically one ingredient in a dish comprised of many other things - e.g. rice, beans, flavorful sauces, etc. In vegan versions of these foods, there is a *context* in which the fake meat can be happily camouflaged. Mexican food is good for that! All across town, Asian & Indian cuisines offer many meatless options that are roaring with flavor -with no need for meat substitutes at all. 

But ""Soul Food"" is different. Large servings of meat that stand on their own are the main course. This is a much more challenging thing to duplicate in vegan form. And therein lies the problem.

Amber's has gone for great visuals over authentic flavor. Here you have pretend chicken that actually looks a lot like chicken, but doesn't taste anything at all like chicken.  It's a big hunk of fried veggie-protein, with a kind of odd texture.

The ribs also look like ribs, but don't taste like ribs at all - and really don't *feel* like barbecued anything. There is no char - no crispness - just a sweet, syrupy sauce.

Which brings me to my only real complaint. No smoke.

For a place with ""smoke"" in their name, there was a decided lack of smoke flavor in anything that I tasted (including the ""Smokey"" Barbecue Sauce).  I doubt that anything here was actually wood-smoked, and that's a disappointment.

So, A+ for effort, but maybe this is just the wrong type of food to vegan-Ize. I honestly think that I would have enjoyed the food more if each item hadn't been visually presented as something that it was not - raising - and then dashing - expectations. 

Even though I didn't love the food, I'm giving three stars for filling an interesting  niche in the local food scene.  If you need your vegetables to look like meat, you'll be happy here.

For me, it's mostly a creative culinary curiosity, but Im not likely to be a regular.",8la7DygWKVkfpDatXztktg,2,1,3,DZDlwGc6I3wdPp-MrAnuvg

Got it?

She is cute as a snack...but Amber's food will keep you coming back!

Since last nights meal, I can't stop thinking about her ribs. 
Not Amber's actual ribs lol, but the vegan ribs she creates. We are not big bbq fans, have never prevegan eaten pork/ribs and I personally prevegan had only tried beef ribs once.
They are super yummy, plant based or not, run there and get some right meow.


The mac and cheese is the best Plant based mac and cheese I have ever eaten. 
Why? Because it's not tangy like that awful goo like texture, it's not oily and it's just not too salty like most are. Vegan m&c is usually weird af tasting and salty. 
Her's is neither. It's perfect. 

Her cornbread...and beans and rice...and baked beans... all bring me back to down in the country...transported back in Centertown, KY where my great grandma would stand over the stove cooking all day and pluck greens and beans out of her garden on her 1,000 acre family vegetable farm. Back in the days where food was simple, but packed a mean punch of flavor. 

Those days are long gone...but Amber's spicy greens took me right back to that ""92 year old great grandma special place"". 

Now the fried chicken and fried corn dog while super yummy was something I usually never eat. The fried chicken is kinda buttermilk batter? style. 

I will be back for a large portion of m&c, greens and full order of ribs piled right on top!!!!!

Yum!!!! Thanks Amber!!!!",zgV0ZroIF956gw4cul8MHA,9,8,5,sNBUMNUs15o2FmYMTNMeDA

One of my favorite things was their home made sauces. The Cakalacky BBQ sauce was soooooo delicious. What I did enjoy is that there are lots of options on their menu but the menu is easy to read and very simple to order from. 

The only critiques we have are that the mac & cheese was a bit dry and we would have liked to have some bbq kick to the baked beans. However, we mixed in some of the classic bbq sauce to the beans and it was great

We were greeted with a warm smile and an offer to answer any questions. We asked for suggestions on what to eat and ended up ordering those items. 

We ordered the Cackalacky Southern Combo (bbq seitan ""rib"", fried ""chikn"", 2 sides of your choice), fried pickles, and the dirty south (bbq jackfruit sandwich and 2 sides of your choice). 

The fried pickles came with a mayo type dip which was so tasty. The rest of our food came up really quickly and we were overwhelmed by the amount of food we now had! The pulled jackfruit sandwich was really good. The greens were almost as good as the non vegan kind I ate growing up. The Mac n cheese and baked beans were both really delicious. The seitan ribs were flavorful but I felt like I was missing something, maybe in the texture. The fried chikn was ok but I probably wouldn't order it again. The breading was delicious but the inside made from what i think is vital wheat gluten, wasn't that impressive. The texture was on point so i just added sauces and overall, did enjoy it. 

They have a serve yourself bar full of different bbq sauces, hot sauce, ketchup, mustard and seasoning. The seating for the building was just food court style for any one of the restaurants' patrons. I will be back to try the grilled cheese, Cajun sausage (they make their own) and corn dogs.

I ordered GF fried mushrooms and GF fried pickles, the fish and chips with fries (they had no sweet potato fries), mac and cheese and corn bread.
There was one couple ahead of me and one receiving an order.
The food arrived quickly. The kitchen is right behind the counter where you order.
I was taking food to go as the fixed chairs and tables in the food court are not conducive to fitting people over 100lbs. 
I tried the corn bread and found it was among the best corn breads I have ever had. It is light, with just the right sweetness and consistency.
The fried mushrooms were good- batter had a nice, nutty flavor.
The fried pickles, too, were ok.
Fries were pretty ok, not crispy, but tasty.
Mac n cheese has a great consistency but there was an aftertaste I did not like.
When it came to the fish, the batter was a bit heavy, but ""fish"" ok. 

I would suggest the menu include if the items are made of seitan, tofu, jackfruit, etc. That is the standard and I want to know what it is when I choose a restaurant.
I hope the staff, who were really sweet and helpful, are eventually moved from a dreary and cramped kitchen, at least to a food truck or a freestanding cafe.

Take-out, to my mind, is the best way to go. The food court is dreary.

Kudos on the corn bread and the mushrooms. I wish them success!
I took stars for the fish mystery ingredient not on the menu, and an aftertaste after the mac and cheese.

Apart from my review, you should still go to Amber's and try their food, because it's a great concept.

I ordered 2 entrees and the first was the fried chicken entree with cornbread, greens, and mac & cheese(pictured).  The vegan chicken was delicious and fried perfectly.  They give you two medium sized pieces which is very nice. I don't know if the chicken is seitan or not, but it had a great texture and tenderness.  The only other thing in this player that was good was the cornbread, which could have been a little larger, but it had a perfect sweetness and texture as well.  They need to go back to the cutting room floor when it comes to their greens and Mac & cheese recipes.  The greens were bland and needed some more seasoning to bring the dish to life, and the Mac & cheese was flavorless. I didn't have high hopes to start for the Mac & cheese, because even when I was an omnivore, white folks could never win me over with their Mac & Cheese recipes Lol,  so to make a vegan one that's actually good would be a little harder. The cheese sauce had no flavor, and not even hot sauce or their bbq sauce helped. It basically tasted as if I were eating noodles with a flavorless sauce. 

The second entree I tried was a kids grilled cheese sandwich with French fries and beans and rice.  I always like to try a kids meal, if I can, to see what type of quality they're offering to children.  The fries were decent, and the beans and rice were good, seasoned well but some bites were a little too salty.  The grilled cheese was made on white bread, which is a major letdown for me.  As a vegan restaurant, you shouldn't be serving bread with absolutely no nutritional value and something that is known for constipating children.  I was disappointed in that. They could have used a better bread I thought.  The cheese wasn't melted very well either.

So out of all the food I tried I only really liked 3 out of 7 items.  If they improve on they're seasoning and some ingredients they use, I would love to give them 4-5 stars, it'll just take some time and testing to get there.",I0sK3iL3KLakjiWQYx_N0A,2,1,3,C7aon2ssCcH55JFQgMTxGA
4041357,2018-06-11,0,4LhURdgGRofYSR_1LBTXvQ,"This place MIGHT be good if you've been vegan for a few years. However if you're giving a vegan a diet a go or recently turned vegan, this stuff is just horrible, I'm sorry. 

Cons:

The BBQ sauce has this overly bright flavor that stays in the back of your throat and will have you running for a drink to wash it off. The chicken is like biting a chewy fried sponge. However, if maybe done a bit thinner it would improve immensely! Ribs and pulled pork textures were actually very descent but were unfortunately ruined by the bbq sauce. The beans were extremely bland. They also forgot the corn bread on all of our plates. This was a delivery order so we had to go without it. And last con would be the pricing to overall value ratio is off by just a dollar or two; if drinks were included it could help in that section.

Pros: 

Mac and cheese is great even when compared to non-vegan options! We got our food delivered and it was still hot (10 minute drive). Food is worth Snapchatting? Trying to say it visually looks amazing and your vegan friends will be jealous. :)

Overall: A young place with tons of potential but today it is simply not for me or my friends.

Dirty South - Smelled amazing. I got it to go and the quick drive to my office was challenging. The sandwich was good...the flavor was actually a bit overpowering for me, but just took out some of the jackfruit to up the bread ratio and it was great. 

Where my meal didn't excel was with the sides. Different people like different things and I've heard people praise some vegan mac and cheese that I have hated. This is going to be one of those times. It had the color and the consistency (with what tasted like some mashed white beans) but other than the slight flavor of northern white or navy beans I didn't really taste anything, just really bland.  

The baked beans were similar just lacking in flavor.

The food came out reasonably fast. I had the fish, which was surprisingly realistic and quite good with tartar sauce. It's unlike other vegan fish I've had. And it's a success. The ribs were quite flavorful, and come in huge portions. It's made from seitan, so the texture is a little bit off. The mac n cheese was delicious, considering much of the time vegan cheese can taste quite sharp and sweet. This mac n cheese had a good texture, and it did not taste like most vegan cheese does. It was the closest to non-vegan mac n cheese that I've had. The baked beans were good, as was the cornbread. I wasn't crazy about the corn dog, which had yummy breading, but the actual hot dog was more of a sausage. Everything else exceeded my expectations.

The service was great- Amber was very kind, asking us questions, wanting feedback, and answering our questions.

It's in a small food court with other vendors nearby, in a tucked away building on Charleston. We will definitely be back, and will be recommending this place to our friends.",-CoGErMmfU-E-ODg_pB5gA,0,0,5,e2NCOp5S8Kdm3v-sNkYbHw

Since we never go out that way we tried a few different things. We ordered the Cackalacky BBQ ribs plate, Cajun Sauzage Po Boy, fried mushrooms and the baked Mac n cheese. Ribs has been something I had missed since becoming vegan, they were amazing. Also the cornbread and coleslaw, on point. We didn't care for the baked beans that came with both entrees. The Sauzage was again, amazing. The greens were ok. I was in love with the fried mushrooms and their ranch they had there. Our disappointment was the Mac n cheese. I guess we expected some crispiness for baked Mac. I do like that they have an actual kids menu that most vegan places lack. We did bring our leftovers home and my other, younger kids devoured everything except the greens, even the Mac! 
We will definitely go back with everyone and try more items.",ZLLVunyn8-lkle41m8Cxwg,0,0,4,MaKoWFHWSRnrqvOriYn9hA

Vegas has been needing some Vegan BBQ / Comfort Food. This is my new favorite spot! 

My boyfriend and I ordered a lemomade, onion rings, bbq ribs plate with mac n cheese and baked beans, and the chicken and waffles plate with beans and mac n cheese. Everything was EXCEPTIONAL! 

I must say, I've been on the search for the Vegan equivalent of Roscoes chicken & waffles... and I found it! The ""chicken"" was crispy and juicy! The waffles were very tasty. Pro tip: add hot sauce to the chicken & waffles, butter and syrup (trust me!).

My boyfriend is not a vegan but said the onion rings might be the best he's ever had! Everything was made to order, not frozen. The batter was delicious! Well seasoned and quite savory! I loved how everything was fried, but not at all greasy.

The customer service and attention to detail was remarkable! Our food came out hot and quick! They checked on us and made sure everything was up to our standards. They even took our trays for us! (Robert remembered us from another vegan-friendly resturaunt he used to own!)

I like hole-in-the wall places like Amber Smoked Vegan! Places like this focus on the customer service and food quality while building a legit business. I will recommend their food to everyone--even carnivores! You bet we will be back to try other delicious southern entres!",lRZtDXG4ijBqyIlQAno5cA,2,2,5,y-YB4EzOA_fXss2mtup7lA

5629689,2018-06-05,2,4LhURdgGRofYSR_1LBTXvQ,"This place is becoming my favorite spot to grub! Even my non-veg head friends are obsessed. 

The portions are huge, and I love that every dish comes with your choice of sides. I can never decide which I love more: the beans, greens, or mac n cheeze (pro tip: sprinkle their cajun seasoning and hot sauce on it).

I've had the chicken, ribs, Scallopz Po Boy, and a mushroom/sausage/rice dish, but I think my favorite is the fish--- made from banana blossom, which is such a nice change from the typical frozen soy mock meats that are offered at most places. It's flaky, breaded, and fried to perfection! P.S. I dare you NOT to douse everything in their cackalacky sauce. It's amazing and addicting!

Someone recommended they specify what their mock meats are made of on their menu, which might be a good idea for health conscious folks or those with allergies, but it didn't keep me from stuffing my face.

To folks who complain about the ~ambiance~ of the restaurant: really? REALLY? The most delicious, laid back, comfort food in Vegas, and you're complaining about the decor? Whatever. Take your order to go and go eat in your castle. (On that note, one pal said she would love to see ASV transition away from using styrofoam for their to-go orders, as lots of vegans are eco-conscious!)

I love that the owner seems really receptive to hearing people's feedback and adjusting what needs work. You can tell there's heart and soul in that place! I love it!",ioAxaAZTOIfa-3AkwixF-Q,3,2,5,SIF-TrIrUeT4J5XWEgNfVg

5754296,2018-06-02,8,4LhURdgGRofYSR_1LBTXvQ,"Honestly I knew something was up when I pulled in an hardly anybody was there and it was in what seemed to be an abandoned small mall.   But event that aside I ignored my instincts because shouldn't necessarily judge a book by its cover.  Well I should have ran .  Just because one is vegan doesn't mean you have to sacrifice taste as well.   The food was weird in texture and blander then cardboard in taste.  I gave it to a homeless person and apologized cause it was so bad and gave them $5 just because their taste bunds were offended as well.

Certain things can't be substituted and I was already on guard wondering how they could bbq anything convincingly. The only thing nice there was the cashier but other then that it was horrible , my drink was lukewarm and watered down.   I don't know who this amber chick is but clearly missed the ball on nailing the menu offered.   Never will I return again and waste my money- if ever I am tempted I'll just turn around and wipe my own ass with the money I would have wasted there.  As even that would have had better results and uses.  Not a fan

And to add insult to injury , rather then take responsibility for a product that is not good my review gets shots fired by the people from the actual restaurant-  I rest my case.  At the end of the day class always prevails and for you ROBERT to use that as the only come back only shows that it's the only come back you have.  Common sense would tell that If I were from another restaurant I'd have plugged another restaurant - nowhere in this post is the name of any other restaurant but yours.  I am simply just a dissatisfied and now DISGUSTED customer who was completely underwhelmed and further validated by your reaction that not only is ambers smoked vegan below the line in food but is clearly below the line in class as common sense would tell you that rules of engagement for customer service would be NOT to attack a customer for expressing their experience at your establishment.  What a person with class would do is Express apologies and perhaps ask what could they have done to make it better.  So now you have made your establishment look beyond unprofessional as well as having lackluster food.  Now it's obvious why your restuarant is in a low level hole in the wall because it's reflective of your low level thinking.

And since you had the audacity to challenge my review as if I was never there here are the receipts to prove it.  (Picture of what I ate)What restaurants don't understand is, yelp is not designed for your feelings to be coddled because for at the end of the day nobody coddled or was considerate of my feelings or my wallet when I spent my money only to feel like I wasted it.  Yelp is designed for blunt honesty and for customers to give feedback good, bad and everything in between so that YOU the restaurant can improve upon and build on where you went wrong.  

Good luck on building the AMBERS VEGAN BRAND with responses like the one you gave.  If you were wise you'd retract and correct your statement otherwise if you are full of arrogance and pride I'll expect your response to stay up in all its glory.",SbJ-SuZ_uQ5p-gWJMuGsaA,6,1,1,LGXKD28FPt3PxLzzIvWXvQ
