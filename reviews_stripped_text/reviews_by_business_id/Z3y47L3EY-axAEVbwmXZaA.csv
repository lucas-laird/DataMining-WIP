2195,2014-09-18,0,Z3y47L3EY-axAEVbwmXZaA,Great ice cream. I had the pistachio in a Waffle cone. Prices are very reasonable and quality is outstanding.  I want to come back again and again to try some other flavors like chocolate brownie.,3mZFkwfa6XV0BBazRTva9w,1,0,5,pCI_lOMjwjt8XSZ1QpiQMA

Man this place brings back memories from when I was a kid, and let me tell you- even today, nothing's changed. It's just as I remembered it-creamy, cold, and delicious ice cream! As a child I'd usually get a double scoop, bubble gum flavor and something else, most likely it was cookies and cream. They still have those flavors and they're just as good!! 

We went on Mother's Day last Sunday, May 14th. I guess everyone was feeling ice cream that day because the line was almost out the door. I couldn't believe how long the line was, but it moved rather quickly. 

They have so many flavors to pick from. I got a triple scoop that included butter pecan, strawberry, and mint chocolate chip on a waffle cone. Super delicious!! And it was huge!! They offer three options for cones. Sugar, waffle, and the traditional ice cream cones. You can even request they be chocolate dipped. Other items they provide are milkshakes, etc. Also, if you're not sure which flavor (s) to choose, they will gladly let you sample their selection. 

There were two employees working that day- a young man and lady. Both were fantastic at moving the line of customers along, while also  providing above average customer service. Great attitudes these two had, they didn't appear to be stressed or overwhelmed by the volume of customers, which is sometimes hard to do. 

So, outstanding employees, clean premises, and quality goodies means it couldn't get any better. Yelpers, go check them out. Bring your loved ones.",wWjM6sgMiwjsCE8SjlM9ZQ,0,0,5,S3-J7ZcFIx1oR3AyNFaLxg
977969,2014-09-03,0,Z3y47L3EY-axAEVbwmXZaA,Best price in town although they don't offer samples but they do have 24 flavors. Only $1.5 for a scoop or $ 2.58 for a double scoop and they even have specials some times you buy one get one free.,XsU-52elef5jjID2UhNHSQ,0,0,1,JnczBmDERtVeBKfVkdnGow

Great selection and good service though.... :)",BTGQRGhvMNff9GD0Im59Qg,1,0,4,wov8g32_UpDuVfOFHqepgA
1675259,2015-04-14,2,Z3y47L3EY-axAEVbwmXZaA,"Ice cream is good, but I can't help but think in the back of my head of how clean this store really is..

The two staff members that were there last night didn't look pleasant, as in uncleanly... 
Very awkward towards the customers (including us).. 
Both didn't appear as if they had any knowledge of the menu.. I mean c'mon it's just ice cream!

Suggestions :
1) Employees to wash their hands longer than 0.5 seconds when coming backc from break or stepping out of the store.
2) Employees to wear gloves when serving samples and orders.
3) Have the store look a little more presentable.
4) Keep ice cream scoops clean, especially on VERY slow nights... (don't think I didn't see that filthy ice cream holder/washer thing Mr. Thrifty's worker behind the counter)
5) Hire people with more personality.. or anyone else that knows how to speak up and actually converse with the customers.

It was very uncomfortable and I felt unsafe with my family when pan handlers would be outside, laying down on the floor asking for money.. Both going in and out of the store.. I'm not sure how that can be stopped, but I also don't know if I'll ever make a trip out here again..",-C-l8EHSLXtZZVfUAUhsPA,4,2,1,z_I3cYrrT2eGEiXLdwq-qg

The guy working there at nights was helping this undeceive obese women & her crack head husband in witch they wanted every type of sprinkles & candy, each topping the guy put on the access that fell on the counter was just simply swept off on the floor where he proceeded to walk all over & spread the mess. I  also saw a cockroach on the floor & some poor attempts of whipping things up. Right before I left, another drug suer opened the door, shouting jiberish & blew a cloud of smoke in the building that didn't smell like: vape, cigarettes, cigars, marijuana or incense (looked & smelled like bad exhaust smoke).",QAXJ49AfOqscK6EomAUAhQ,0,0,1,JgFEneJ20WAVlD5RxoFTLg
3429192,2017-05-09,1,Z3y47L3EY-axAEVbwmXZaA,"Kind of funny and/or weird that there's a Thrifty ice cream parlor.  This brand of ice cream was very popular when I was younger so it's great to see it still available now, even though the Thrifty and/or Rite Aid brands are still around, although the ice cream can be hard to find.  Your ice cream arrives in the signature cylinder scoop and it's still very reasonable in terms of pricing.

My favorites are Chocolate Malted Crunch, Chocolate Brownie and Peanut Butter Chocolate.",tlY0QMQDyfjQAEwHnzvFnw,2,1,4,9Q_hQOhxj-Y4UAfzAfmtFA
3530763,2016-01-12,0,Z3y47L3EY-axAEVbwmXZaA,"On 1/8/16 I visited this Thrifty location to purchase two quarts of ice cream. The employee on duty asked me what I wanted as he was making milkshakes for the couple ahead of me, and I told him. Then, as he finished with their order he asked me again. After I told him, he said that just that afternoon a co-worker had told him that they can sell only the existing quarts of ice cream in their freezer case because they are running low on ice cream (I wanted black cherry and peanut butter chocolate, neither of which was in the freezer case). I was surprised, but then asked if I could purchase two pints. He said yes, then commented that he didn't really know if he was supposed to sell pints. I told him I didn't want him to get in trouble, but I wasn't going to purchase a scoop or two and that if it was a problem I would decline to make a purchase. He reluctantly agreed to fill two pint containers, then commented that the lids were loose because he had overfilled them (he hadn't). My concern is that the owner of this store wishes to discourage customers from purchasing by the quart because the profit margin is smaller.",SHb-fCXP9t5pFwLWFES66Q,0,0,2,PeLzh5DSfHpJOWxJ0zlmew

Love ice cream! Store is clean, staff is nice and friendly, ice cream yumm!

Thrifty ice cream was the bomb back in the day. I don't remember it costing so much however. Bit pricy for ice cream, but a good treat..

5007480,2014-07-10,1,Z3y47L3EY-axAEVbwmXZaA,"Everything was fine except the customer service. My fiancé asked for a single scoop cone but wanted 1/2 scoop of one flavor and 1/2 scoop of another flavor. First the girl said she couldn't but then said she was just joking and agreed. She asked what two flavors he wanted and he told her. I'm not sure what happened because she had a half scoop of the first flavor on the cone and then went to grab a new cone. She seemed frustrated and asked the other employee to do it for her. He told her he doesn't do half scoops. She attempted again and ended up with a full scoop. My fiancé reminded her that he wanted two half scoops and she said, ""Well you didn't tell me what the second flavor was."" He told her again and then ended up with 2 full size scoops. When I told her that he didn't want two, he only wanted 1, she rudely replied, ""Well that's why we don't do half scoops."" My fiancé paid and then put $2 into the tip jar for the trouble despite her rudeness and she didn't even bother to say thanks, not for the tip or for our business.

Then I heard that there were some thrifty locations here in Vegas again, but were inside stores called ""Scoops"" So what the hey, I was in the area and decided to indulge in the sweet creamy goodness of a cup on chocolate chip cookie dough. Tastes great, just how I remember it to be. Except the price $2.29 a single scoop! Sheesh! Not really a cone type of guy. I prefer it in a cup myself, but to each is own. The guy behind the counter greeted me as soon as I walked in, and washed his hands too. He let me sample a few flavors prior to my order. Just so I could get my taste buds back in alignment since it's been a few years. He took my order, rung me up, and said ""thanks plz come again"". 4 stars just on the account of him.

Walking in the place was clean.  The ice cream looked orderly and clean as well.  The guy behind the counter was extremely polite and friendly.  He was also very quick and efficient.

The ice cream itself was very very delicious.  I got a waffle cone of black cherry and cotton candy and a single scoop of frosted animal cracker.  Dang that black cherry is good.  The texture looks grainy and milky in photos but it's actually quite creamy and smooth.  

I'll definitely be back when I'm craving that black cherry.  Maybe I'll even try some of the other flavors as well.",byV70bKT87SHgN0uRtow6w,2,2,4,k7hes8L0qHyaaU0mF-S2NA
