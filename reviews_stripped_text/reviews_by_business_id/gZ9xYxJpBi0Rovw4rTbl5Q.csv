I remember the owner used to give us free appetizers and the customer service was great...but my return trips to Almaza have been progressively disappointing. Customer service has declined considerably, and while the food and hookah are good, it's not worth being ignored half the time, or shooed to another table for another party, even though you made reservations in the first place. A lot of the old waiters/bartenders have left, and their replacements leave something to be desired.

I don't know about the hookah, but it literally burned my throat. It wasn't as smooth, well it's mainly because the water or whatnot was mixed with vodka, so unless you want a dry throat then I suggest you go in for that mix. Other than that by 12 am, the dance floor was crackinn and anyone who is anyone were down to dance which to me was fun! I would come back here.

It went under new ownership a few times so I decided to give it a try . Not sure what happened but this is the worst place ever to smoke hookah. I asked for the half chicken dish and they were out of chicken then i asked for another dish and they were out too so i finally just went with the kabob. The food that I eventually got was tasty. The servers there are terrible. They care more about smoking there own hookah than waiting on you so try not to bother them too much :). You will wait long for anything.

1556756,2011-02-13,1,gZ9xYxJpBi0Rovw4rTbl5Q,"Booooo... mediocre at best.

For starters, I've probably been here a good 4+ times, but if you're looking for a food review- this isn't it. Mediterranean food is my crack- but I've never gotten around to trying the food here. Even though we were never crazy about the place we would go because (at the time) it was the only nearby lounge.

This place is popular with folks of a variety of ages but particularly the 18-21 crowd on weekend nights for the hookah and ""loungey"" atmosphere. I have rarely paid to come here and I wouldn't. Typically, Ive always gone with a group of friends when the invite was extended or to catch up with someone.

My last experience can pretty much sum up ever every experience I've had. A decent sized group of us (5/6) went in just for a hookah session. Place was pretty much empty (I've never really gone during the ""peak"" time with a dj), but there's middle eastern club music going- streaming through two tvs- interesting music videos and all. We're seated and tended to immediately. The one thing this place has going for it in my experience is that it DOES have a nice atmosphere and the service is alright (sometimes good sometimes bad). All but one of us are smoking, and everyone who smokes needs to order a drink (it's like a protocol)- so, 4 sodas (there's a point for this itinerary later). After a flavor consensus and suggestion from the waitress we order A (1) hookah. After we finally got the thing going (hookah wasn't pulling well) there is hardly any flavor and within 5-10 minutes of us smoking (and it's not like we're hitting the thing hard, we spent most of the time talking)- the smoke is incredibly harsh and even my hardened-cigarette smoking Marine buddy is coughing up a storm. So, we tell the waitress. Charcoal homie who never talks comes with the charcoal bucket and takes almost all the charcoal off. In 5 minutes it goes dead. We tell the waitress, she doesn't really do anything. (Again, place is empty, there is only one other-smaller- group). The hookah always, again, is mediocre at best, idk if it's a combination of a sh*t pipe and low quality shisha or what.
Bill comes- after military discount- $37- for 4 cokes, and a P.o.S under 15 min hookah session...and THAT is why I only go if someone else is covering it.

Pros: atmosphere, okay service
Cons: bad value,  crappy hookah",NP6fYh3QAmcXz2seTK04mg,1,1,2,nKRAl-EqGELJF6Eyn9DKTQ

Almaza is possibly the worse place i've ever been to. They're under new management so no booze while paperwork is being pushed for a liquor license. 

Staff are complete morons or high school drop outs or their parents didnt socialize them properly when they were young so they grew up complete frakking idiots.

My party came early and requested a specific seat and he told us he'd get it cleaned up and it's ours. Then his friends walked in and he told us to hold while he devoted all his attention to them. Remember that seat we were promised? another group had that spot but he didnt know because he learned his customer service skills from a friggin potato...

After getting place to another area we waited a good 15-20 minutes for someone to bring us a menu. after we got the menus it took 20-30 minutes someone to come back and take our order. 

The hookah (midnight rose flavor) was nice and lasted the few hours we were chilling there, completely ignored by the staff, with empty cups, and one mouth piece...seriously there's 5 people at the table sharing a hookah and you only give one mouth piece...Note to who ever manages the staff: PLEASE DO NOT OPEN A TATTOO PARLOR!!

Food:
The pita wrap was the best thing on the table and i wasn't the one that ordered it. 
The lamb chops were...lets put it this way they were cooked earlier in the day then thrown in the fridge. When someone, like us, ordered it they threw it on the grill to get warm. What does this do? IT OVER COOKS THE MEAT. I cant believe i paid 20 bucks for rubber on bone.

the WORSE part about this place is they KNOW their service is garbage and they dont do a gorram thing about it. How do i know this? Where do i draw this conclusion from? THE TWENTY-FIVE PERCENT MANDATORY GRATUITY ON THE RECEIPT.

3088460,2012-12-23,0,gZ9xYxJpBi0Rovw4rTbl5Q,"These guys really need a few pointers from experienced waitresses and hospitality staff.

For one thing, there appears to be only 2 waitresses to serve a restaurant/hookah lounge that regularly contains more than 70 or 80 people. That means you'll get your service in 30 or 45 minutes, which is unacceptable. On top of that, it'll take about 20 minutes for her to bring you a beer. It'll take a HOUR for you to get a BEER. Just one beer! 

It's a shame, because the people that come inside are pretty hot. Like, smoking HOT hispanic girls... EVERYWHERE. And we are not talking about cougar-aged hispanic women of Blue Martini, these girls here are young. 

Foods okay. Hookah is pretty shitty because the coals put themselves out. The flavor of the tobacco itself is almost nonexistent, which adds to the frustration of the regulars that come inside here. I have met many people, in 3 days of coming here, that share the same complaints. 

And why are there so many cops hanging in their cars outside? Every hour I see two cop cars lurking in the parking lot waiting to pull one of the folks that are leaving over.  It makes me feel uneasy.

The hookah was mediocre at best (I've been to alot better in Vegas for half the cost). I ordered some food for myself and my date. I can honestly say the food was decent. The server was very accommodating. But looking back, I realize that they were TOO accommodating (you'll see why later). Then things went from good to horrible in a matter of a few minutes.

After my meal, things started to change. The server kept urging my date and I to move from the ""dining"" section to the hookah section. His concern was maybe that we were taking up valuable space. And for this I understand, but it seems like a rather slow night so I didn't understand the rush. They had a dj playing house music. I didn't mind since I enjoy house music and it a place like this it really seemed appropriate. But in all honesty the sound system was absolutely horrid. I can go into detail about it, being somebody who works in pro audio. But let's just say that had they hired somebody decent to set this up, they'd been alot better off.

But I guess it wasn't their fault because at around 10pm, the pull the dj from booth (literally mind you) and they go to the back (but not completely out of sight) where I'm assuming an argument ensues. I turn around and mind my business smoking sub-par hookah. But since the music was apparently done, so was my date here.

So I ask to close my tab only to find over $300 charged to my account! I'm told by the manager of the place (who is now flustered by the incident with the dj) that this was only an ""authorization"". I was appalled, a $300 authorization?!?! This is a meal and some drinks, not a hotel room or rental car!!! I write the amount of the official bill (after asking to see an itemized one) on the slip and signed.

Well, guess who had to perform a chargeback request? That's right, me. This ""authorization"" never got changed at the end of the night and I found myself trying to make the next couple days away from home on the cash I had on hand. 

Overall, this place is trying to be some posh lounge in a desert full of posh lounges. But seriously, how ""posh"" can you be when you're situated next door to a Cici's Pizza?

Which means I HATE the strip.

All I wanted was to groove to some hip hop and it's very hard to do that off the strip and without a cover charge (think...Poetry...now that it's half celeb owned, they think they can charge $30 for ladies....)

Friend of a friend led us here and I was pleasantly surprised.
We got a table for 5, really nice waitress (who is from the bay area by where i live), a coconut hookah   (which lasted ALLLLL night because they kept refilling the charcoals...which is unheard of at most hookah joints) and the $12 for 16 oz drinks weren't watered down like the Red Rock casino ones I just paid for an hour prior.

I was too full from Chicken and Waffles at hash house, but i will be coming back for midnight snacks.

My favorite part about this place, was the variety of music from hip hop (my FAVORITE), dance, ummm arabic-esque (don't know the right term for that genre)...but once that music came on everybody in the place did the arabic version of the bunny hop...only it wasn't a like watching a bunch of drunks at a wedding make a fool. It was genuinely amazing to watch dancing other than club bumping, grinding and groping.

Oh--and it wasn't a meat market...You can tell it was a lot of locals just relaxing and grooving.

The only reason I'm skipping out on a star is because it was kinda busy, and it took awhile to get our first round of drinks...so long my friend walked up to the bar to order ours. BUT...they were worth it. (Bahama Dream was yummy)
