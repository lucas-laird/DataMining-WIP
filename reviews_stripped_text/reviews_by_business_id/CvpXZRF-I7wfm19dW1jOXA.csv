45353,2016-12-19,1,CvpXZRF-I7wfm19dW1jOXA,Absolutely Gross. I have been numerous times and the experience has been good. Not great. But good. My first lunch Experience today at mark rich was aweful. Wings were overcooked and dried out garbage with an overcooked breading I don't remember ever getting when I am there in the evening. Stromboli was good so you get the second star. Never order the wings again. Don't bother complaining to the staff cuz they will justify their food and not try to correct it or remove it from the bill. I should of purchased wings from the Albertson's across the parking lot. Which I am sure where they bought their ranch dressing and nasty hot sauce.,vHSm0P2ty5WXeCgjA2W6Cw,0,0,2,-yGflEeZphWdDy11zP7f1w

I won't go back, though, because of an experience I had when my cousin was in town visiting with her kids.  We ordered two of their biggest pizzas.  It took 45 minutes to get to our house, although we live literally less than a mile away and it was a Wednesday night.  Only one pizza.  We ordered two.  I asked the delivery guy who said the order was only for one.  I called back and asked about the other pizza.  They sent another pizza out, took another 45 minutes, and charged me full price for the second pizza.  I'm not asking for a free pizza but man, we had to wait almost two hours to have enough food for everyone to eat.  It would have been nice to say they were sorry or something.  Overall it was very frustrating and the food isn't good enough to make it worth it.",tHStf1qlliRe8iCcxjwK-Q,5,1,1,HxRi_JuEW55x2E0G_Q4xEQ

It shocks me that in this type of economy, a restaurant like this would argue with customers and opt for the ""take-it-or-leave-it"" attitude. I mean, they are all friendly and hospitable when you are eating and paying for their mediocre bordering on substandard food, but the minute you decide to speak up about your food they are a completely different establishment! 
That is NO way of doing business and sadly most neighbors around here just choose to eat the ""OK"" menu offerings because it's a convenient stop.

384480,2014-10-15,0,CvpXZRF-I7wfm19dW1jOXA,"Arrived at 4:30pm with family to get some pizza (and a hot dog for my daughter). 

Server advised the Tuesday special was order an X-Large pizza and get a medium pizza free.  We ordered that special (and a hot dog for my daughter).  
Hot dog came right away. My daughter enjoyed it.

We waited an hour and still no pizzas. Server advised there was a mix up but it would be out soon. After another 20 mins, one pizza comes. But the free medium that was the cheese pizza still wasn't done. My son only eats cheese pizza so he didn't get dinner tonight. Server tries to apologize and offers free deserts all around which we don't want. So she says she'll discount the pizzas. 

Cool. Glad she's trying. I'm fairly laid back in life so it's all good.

We eat. Pizza is ok. Free medium finally comes out in box so we can go now. Server brings bill and turns out the medium pizza isn't actually free. Server states she advised the manager it was her error but wasn't able to correct the bill. She was able to give us my kids' drinks for free.  She continues to apologize and states she will have the manager come talk to us. Sounds fair.

She comes back asking if there's anything else she can try to give us because the manager won't come to talk to us. I laugh. A screw up is one thing - we all have them. But this is just someone that has no concern or respect for the clients that are trying to write their paycheck. 

So I ask what the manager's name is so I could include in my review and potentially bring it up with an owner who wouldn't want employees treating customers this way. 

Her response?  Mark Rich.  

Ah, nevermind then. It's in fact the owner of the place that refuses to talk to his customer and leaves his poor server hanging out there on a limb trying to explain why. When my two young children asked why he wouldn't talk to me, I made the most of the situation by using it as an example of what it means to not have integrity and not be accountable for your own actions and decisions.

I am happy to report that they must have fired their old cook cause the Pizzas are better than ever. I wanted so much to tell the owners what was going on in their kitchen but didnt have the balls. Now is this the best pizza on the planet.. no... but its good on a cold night to warm your tummy...in this economy everyone needs to support everyone and stop be critics.. would I eat here again? YOU BET!!! as long as they keep the current cook. I would have given them 4 stars but I feel everyone else on here hasnt been too kind.. and they deserve better reviews.. so I gave them 5 to help bring up their score.

Don't get me wrong the food is good - but with so many options for truly excellent Italian food, pizza, pasta -  you have to have something else that draws you in to Mark Rich's. I love Ellen and Kristin! They are truly funny, witty, and service oriented. Plus it's close to home. This is just a fun place to enjoy your food when you don't feel like going too far.

My favorite item is the eggplant parmesan with a side salad. I am not elated by the pasta. It is often overcooked or undercooked. The ""Works"" pizza is good. On Tuesday, you can enjoy a free medium cheese pizza when you order a large pizza. Tuesday's used to be my standard time to visit Ellen - but she moved to Wednesday's and now I don't come in as frequently. Kristin only works weekends - and that is usually when I hit the town in search of new restaurants I have bookmarked on my Yelp page. 

I am not crazy about the cannoli's here. They are not made fresh in the restaurant and it shows. However, I love the warm powered sugar dough dessert - I can't do that too often though. I always say I will just have a couple and then... ouch!",jY1shXf_LQVhSoUyoXqQRQ,2,0,3,pY5LKbHNc0-OihMx1C-nPA

We ordered a Caesar salad which was tasty, but then waited for 30 more minutes on a spinach calzone. 30 minutes for a single spinach calzone. 

You gotta love open kitchens, because it was wonderful watching the cooks giggle and flirt with each other, slowly assembling meals for the handful of tables and take out orders they had. All the while, the manager casually enjoyed his red wine, slowly sipping the night away. Seriously, it felt like an episode of Kitchen Nightmares. Get off your bar stool and manage!!

The apathetic waitress walked passed our table several times, ignoring our empty beer mugs and discontented faces until I shouted out twice to ask how much longer we'd have to wait. The single calzone arrived and tasted good. But I don't like to wait around and be ignored all night for just good.

And wouldn't you know it? That waitress got so smiley and attentive as soon as the check came. You would have thought she was in the running for Miss America.",eLHTQ12V_TDQZmsPigNveA,2,1,2,qDw6Vx2Rr9qAO02z0twgbw

Nothing like ordering pizza to keep up everyone's spirits. It might usually take a while to get everyone together in the office, but not when pizza is involved. We all raced to the pizza as soon as it arrived, lovingly placed on a table by our office manager. But, something was missing. WHERE ARE THE GARLIC KNOTS?

My favorite part of eating pizza is enjoying the garlic knots--a love discovered in NYC, made permanent by a bag of knots small enough to be eaten like popcorn on a long subway ride through Manhattan. Delicious, buttery wads of dough covered in minced garlic? YES, PLEASE! Dipped in marinara! Dipped in garlic sauce! On their own! They are just delicious! But, to my disappointment, they were absent.

I was put in charge of calling Mark Rich's to inform them of the terrible news. The man who answered seemed to already be aware of the mistake and asked if I wanted the delivery person to run them back to the office. Well, yes, sir, that is why I called. He told us the knots would be delivered right away (we already paid for them anyways.)

As I slowly ate my pizza, trying to save space for knots, the phone rang. Someone from the pizza place called back and offered to give us a credit for the knots. How kind! ...Wait. Are the knots still on their way? No? Oh.

Is this a refund?

A credit for a future order.

Oh.

I don't enjoy ordering knots, not getting them, being promised knots, and being told I can have them later. Why would we order from them again if they didn't get our first order right? It's one thing if you get compensation for a mistake, but this wasn't the case. 

I almost gave them two stars because the pizza was pretty good, but poor service drives me up the wall. I understand that mistakes do happen, but to make a promise and renege due to laziness or any other reason is inexcusable.",bFl0Cg7anF3yVN6dcX2Tbw,10,1,1,iQLfSPtmZyprsnzR9tK6Qw

First, i'll say that this place looks very nice inside.  They keep it very clean and the staff seems friendly.  Both times i've been here, I saw the owners come out and ask everyone how their food was (the reason I give this place two stars instead of one).

As for the food, most of it was horrible each time.  I got chicken marsala and the wine they used in the sauce was so bitter that I couldn't finish it.  Chicken marsala is one of my favorite dishes and i've had it many times, and I can honestly say this was the worst chicken marsala i've ever had.  The pizza was OK.   I'd rather go to pizza hut if I wanted pizza.  The chicken wings and wedding soup was average.

Overall I just feel that since this place is new, they just need to work on their recipes and they could easily become a 4-5 star restaurant.   I'll give this place a chance every 3 months or so to see how they've improved, but too many bad experiences and i'll stop wasting my time.",9TvGWOKQSjS75qiuUl5i-g,2,2,2,4hHd0yUflcLUJMBiYO6gIg

The salads and pastas here are not their forte- maybe it's just the dressing, but the antipasto salad had ample toppings but nothing interesting going on flavor-wise. Meat quality seemed just so-so, and the ""house italian"" looked like it was packed with herbs but tasted more like plain oil. Fellow diners who opted for pasta specials mentioned that they were overcooked and mushy rather than al dente as expected.

They have a limited list of lunch specials ($7, five options) and outdoor dining tables with umbrellas.

I decided to order a cheeseburger and french fries along with a root beer.  I know what you're all thinking!  Here I come to an Italian pizza and pasta restaurant and I order the most American item on their menu.  To my defense, my husband chose the restaurant as we were looking for some place quick to eat before our show.  I wasn't in the mood for pizza, the pasta seemed too heavy as I wasn't very hungry and the salads didn't sound too amazing.  They all came with raw onions, (Yuck!) and their descriptions sounded as if they were all made with filler iceberg lettuce, as I like to call it.

Of course I was given a Sierra Mist in place of my root beer.  The waiter quickly dashed off, and I was too tired to say anything.  A half an hour later my cheeseburger arrived very dried and sad with no cheese.  Maybe I should have ordered one of their salads, and requested no onions.

The only saving grace for this restaurant is that they brought out some wonderfully soft dough on a cute pizza plate to keep my daughter occupied while we waited for our meals.

There were just a couple issues with the food:  I had ordered the tomato basil soup...thinking like most restaurants, it would be very simple...tomatoes in a blender, basil , etc.  But a white soup came out instead and I was a bit put-off.  It must be all milk?  I had a sip and it was pretty much milked down and tasted terrible.  The waitress kindly asked me if I didn't want it and she took it off the bill.  She felt bad about it and the kitchen was super busy.  No worries..I don't let a few small things ruin my image of a place - especially with the service being as good as it is.  My friend and I ordered a gluten-free pizza (because of my diet restrictions).  It was soooo tasty.

Service: Deplorable

First, the good: I had chicken marsala, which came with two full chicken breasts cooked to perfection and a massive pile of pasta. Put a fancy presentation on this dish and I would expect I was eating at an expensive gourmet restaurant. One friend got a large antipasto salad which... well, large doesn't even begin to cover it. This salad was big enough to choke a hippo. The pizzas also looked very tasty, and got great review from everybody at the table. Honestly, the food itself deserves a higher rating, but the service was bad enough to drag this all the way down.

Now on to the bad. Most of our time there, the entire staff was too busy watching the football game to be bothered paying attention to the customers. Personally, I had to ask for water multiple times and had to get a set of utensils from a friend, as the server forgot to bring a set after I asked (shouldn't they have been provided without asking?) Oh and the real icing on the cake: I asked to get a box for my food, so the server was kind enough to go box it up herself. And then forget about it. I actually had to ask for my food back several minutes later as we were getting ready to leave.

I'm going to have to mark this place off as a ""Do Not Return"".",4GoS7G_fyGEHGMjcQ4msLw,3,0,2,S41As9bujMo8fPKUwSqfrQ

(Large pizza and a bucket of wings for $35) and a spaghetti with marinara ($7) Got home and found that we had received a 4oz souffle cup of ranch for a BUCKET of buffalo wings. Obviously not enough. The pizza was good. The wings tasted like they had freezer burn or something. Didn't eat many since we didn't have enough ranch. Went back the next day to ask for more ranch. Explained how much I got with my bucket and she still charged me almost $5 for more ranch!

So the food takes about 15-20 minutes, and we had ordered 2 slices of pizza, and 2 medium spinach calzones.  I've never seen a large in my life that cost $16, but after seeing the size of their mediums, I can probably guess at the size!

So, from a NY pizza slice perspective, this was not too bad.  It was about right on the price, and definitely right on the taste buds.  Had a slice of cheese, and a slice of white.

The calzones by far, were definitely a winner.  We were expecting at $9 a piece that my wife and I would be getting some tiny things which would complement the pizza slices.  However, we could barely share one!  The crust was soft, of which I've rarely had a calzone like that which meant that the dough was freshly made and cooked to the right temperature.  They also didn't skimp on the marinara which I did appreciate.

All in all, will definitely be trying them again.   Hopefully don't run into the same bad reviews as others, but perhaps for to-go, it's actually a good spot versus the in-dining.  Personally don't care for in-dining that much anyways unless I'm going to some posh place on the Strip.

The crust was cooked but the cheese was white not the golden color on a good pizza. It's a shame because it's so close to home. We've had food from there before but it's been awhile & it use to be good.

We ordered at 8:00 on a Tuesday and it took about 40 minutes to receive the food. They quoted 30 minutes and the cashier was sweet, so I would say my service experience was good.

The food was hot and freshly made.  We had sandwiches, pizza, and salad.  I was impressed with the salad.  It was very fresh and tasty.  The pizza is not bad.  The sandwich was good.  I am going to try their pasta and wings next time.  

I live less than a minute away so if I am not in a hurry to get dinner, I will probably use this place, but Rocco's is on my way home from work too so I may stick with them if I have a service experience that others on Yelp have mentioned having.  I will order before I leave work and then plan on being there no sooner than the 30 minutes they quote.

One thing Mark Rich's has over Rocco's though is they serve alcohol and pizza and beer is a nice meal on a hot summer's eve.  Also, the interior is nicer than Rocco's too; Rocco's has always been too hot in the summer, Mark Rich's has a nicer atmosphere and is not too hot even with that huge pizza oven.",FPEDwrWxK-CPjlgJM8r3fQ,0,0,3,3P7ArAVNwI1lJtJn2folMw

The service is amazingly awful, there were maybe 3 other tables of people while we were there and our server forgot our drinks and didn't get two of our four orders, we had to tell her them a second time! The guy who refilled the water was very kind and very good at his task.  Drinks only.  We asked him a food question and he said, "" you'll have to ask your server, I'm sorry"". Ok. 

Prices are on the higher side for what you get.  My husband ordered a side salad which was a small bowl of iceberg lettuce with a slice of tomato and some red onion slices tossed on top. $4. We ordered wings which were sauceless and dry - at least they came with decent fries - $12.  The kids each ordered pasta -- one had spaghetti and meatballs and the other had fettucini alfredo (no chicken) and each bowl was $5.99 with an extra $1.75 per meatball on the spaghetti and $1.00 for alfredo sauce!!  We weren't told of this and it wasn't very delicious, to say the least!

The owners were sitting there eating, like it was the end of a long day.  Carried out food from the back kitchen and sat down to eat.  Kinda felt like I was at Mel's Diner. :p

I didn't try their pizza, but maybe I should've.  However, I won't be going back, so that won't happen.

Unfortunately, I doubt we'd ever go back.

Each person ordered a different pizza. Jayse and I shared, ordering a large cheese with tomatoes and half artichoke. The crust could best be described as a tasteless, soggy cardboard, and the toppings on each pizza were sparse. For the artichokes on ours, there was only individual artichoke leaves (no actual heart pieces) spread around the pizza very sparingly. You couldn't even taste them. The food was paired with poor service from our server, making for a very disappointing meal. We wouldn't recommend this place.

Our pizza came with four toppings - garlic, mushrooms, chicken, and something else which I forgot. :) It was pretty good! My hiking partner encountered a green pepper on one of the slices though (not one of our toppings). The person next to us had a calzone and it was huge!

My wife, 2 year old and I checked this place out last night and I was pleasantly surprised. Ok, being a pizza snob it's not Settebello. But sometimes you want a pizza without fuss that you can customize and with a thin crust. And that's what I got, a pizza with a reasonably thin, hand tossed crust. I watched the guy toss it and he's good at it. And when you add fresh veggies and tomatoes and more it's not going to be as dry as a cracker, it's going to be kind of wet. (Notice I said wet, not soggy, there's a vast difference there!)  I ordered a NY Combination, tossed the bell pepper, added green olives and tomatoes. What I got tasted great. The green olives added just the right amount of saltiness so it was like a combination meets a Mediterranean pizza. It was good. But I wasn't the only one liking it as my 2 year old didn't spit it out and he ate very good here. (This is also one place where I even ate the crust as it was really good)

My wife ordered manicottis which I tried and liked but had to stay away from as I had that massive pizza to enjoy. Our appetizer included mushrooms, zucchini, and mozzarella sticks. The zucchini was off for me but my wife loved it, and the mushrooms and mozzarella sticks were quickly gone.  

Service was really good. I did have one time I had to ask for an ice tea refill but that was it. Service with a smile? Yep, got it here in abundance. Oh and one other little detail, the fork I was using had seen better days. But beyond that, I have nothing else I can gripe about. 

Overall, I liked this place. And I will be back. While Old School Pizzeria, Grimaldi's, and Settebello have their place, Mark Rich's NY Pizza is worth a look too.",HEvyblFw4I-UsMqgPGYY_Q,2,1,4,MwZnIaceZJn_5qbmXak4iw

First, let me start by saying, if I ever had a restaurant, if for any reason I came out of the back, I would go around (like a lot of places do) and address customers. I would maybe thank them for wasting their money on my terrible food or I would even ask them how they're liking the food. I would say something to better my customer's experience.

With that being said, I sat next to the owners friends and they requested to talk with him. He came out the back and sat with them for 30+ minutes. He never once looked up or even smiled at us. He was too busy telling stories about his childhood and jokes about fat people.

Even when my food came out, he didn't even glance up to look at it. If I had a small business, I would want to make sure everyone is satisfied. Even if I was talking with old friends, I would stop to acknowledge customers. I would make sure the product that being served is satisfactory. He didn't, but if he had, he might would have saved himself a customer.

Ok, so they had one waitress. She was really sweet. She started off great, as far as serving skills. She brought our drinks right out. She asked if we were ready to order, but at the time, we were not ready. It took her about 10 minutes to come back and take our orders. That would have been ok if she was at other tables, but she wasn't she was in the back.

When she came back, we placed our appetizer order. We ordered the Garlic Bread with Cheese and when it did come out, 10 minutes later, it didn't have any cheese on it. They waitress said that she didn't know we wanted cheese. She said that it wasn't a big deal and she took them back to the back. After about 7 minutes, she brought them back out. They had cheese on them and they didn't look too bad.

We started on the bread and then placed the order for our pizza. We ordered the 16"" Sausage Pizza. I should have read the tips on this place before I arrived because if I had, I would have known to order my pizza and appetizer at the same time.

We finished the bread and still waited another 20 minutes to get the pizza. It took a while. I know that they're made fresh, of course, but dang, even Dominos can get the pizza out quicker than that, and they have like 20 other orders to fill. I was the only one ordering, at the time too. Let me stop, I'm not sure the equipment they're working with. It may be significantly different.

Either way, the pizza got to me, but it was really gooey. It was hot and runny, to say the least. It smelled like butt, too. I wasn't the only one that noticed the smell either. It made it really hard to eat it.

The bread tasted pretty good but compared to other places I've previously tried, it was average. It was, in fact, better than the pizza. The pizza was poor. It was well less than average.

In all, this place was not added to our Favorite's List. I drove too far to be disappointed like this.",trO6aQpnXxRXqIyKQ_ryrQ,9,1,2,XWRB7qGaMldbqeBtl3jktA

As I entered the restaurant, that East Coast feel surrounds the place and the smell of the pizza oven lingers. The cashier  was no where to be found as I stepped up to the order counter, and took her a good 3 minutes to realize there was a customer. She did not  look enthused to be working today apparently as she just wanted to take my order and get back to her task. I do give her a star for being so helpful to figure out my giftcard and giving me feedback on using it.

Now to the food, I ordered the chicken wings with fries and the eggplant parmigiana. I am a chicken wing fanatic and I can eat it and never get tired of it. The chicken wing I received seem very dry and chewy, you can tell they were frozen and then fried.  I was not impressed at all whatsoever with their chicken wings, so moving on to the main entree the eggplant. I was very excited to try this dish as the last time I've tasted it was in Florida months ago. Today was the day to give my palate a taste of this amazing dish. So the eggplant I got  was burnt and tasted old. Like I was expecting the eggplant to be a bit moist and soft, but what I got was a burnt, dry, hard eggplant. The sauce however deserves a star for being somewhat tasty. I'll give them another star for the neighborhood pizza place feel and for the convenient location. 

All in all, I give this place a three star for the three  things that I thought was reasonable to be awarded. Unless you're really hungry and you have no where else to go and this is nearby, then you can go ahead and choose this place. I won't say that I'll never come back, I've still yet to try their pizza, but for now I'd  rather just savor my once memory of a delicious, perfect, eggplant parmigiana meal in my mind.",2AK2h99DLlneR6xzn82Msw,0,0,3,jCI-wDHakv9v5mA3omm4qg
5084311,2013-04-12,3,CvpXZRF-I7wfm19dW1jOXA,"I just gave this exact place in Centennial Center a five star review, cause it's great. I say to go to the Centennial Center instead of the Summerlin area, if you really want to experience this place for what it really is.

Never got a chance to try the food at the Summerlin area actually, the people were too fucking rude for me to want to even put up with their shit long enough to be seated.
I was with someone, and we were coming back from Red Rock when we stopped here to eat. I figured since the Centennial place was so awesome, I could expect the same thing here.
We walk in, there's no seat-yourself sign. So we stand there, looking at all the empty tables, but  the hostess tells us to wait and walks off. Some teeny-bopper with pink hair is at the cashier, and after a few minutes of the hostess not returning I ask here if we could just seat ourselves, like the other location. She gets all annoyed that we DARE bother her and tells us to just wait. After another few minutes of watching the hostess walk back and forth, not really doing anything but ignoring us, we walk out.
Wasn't going to deal with that horse shit, and pretty disappointed that the customer service quality wasn't the same as the other location. They are run by the same people right?

I really don't understand how the people that work here are so rude compared to the Centennial location. Maybe it just reflects the customers that come in, since we all know everyone that lives in Summerlin is an asshat. But there's no need to assume a sour attitude with everyone that walks in.

Luckily we didn't eat here, I've heard that the food isn't as good as the other one either. It pangs me to give this a shitty review cause I really do like the restaurant, I just think this location needs a big hug or something.",4N-HU_T32hLENLntsNKNBg,5,2,2,MrlHBU9d5q-gI2me_fD6RA

First visit -- watery spaghetti and meatballs. It was marginally ok ... I ate it. The garlic bread was ... Terrible, I could have made better with wonder bread and garlic salt which is basically what it was ... Second time, I waited in line and their computer system went down it was a Friday night and they had no clue what to do... I forgave them for this, it happens but they could have written down my order and made my pizza ... They were completing orders and had other customers they just decided to freak out and not take mine, how did people order pizza and pay before computers? I had cash too. Third time tonight is just unacceptable. I don't eat a lot of pizza or carbs, when k to it's a treat ... I just spent $35 for a take and bake pizza (it was not cooked) and eggplant Parmesan (which was surprisingly ok) but the garlic bread was also not cooked.

I have only had the pizza from this location on W. Charleston when other co-workers have ordered it and it was okay. Not as good as the location that closed.

So someone wanted to order some lunch and asked if I wanted to order and I figured I'd give it a shot. I ordered the bowl of soup and garlic bread, which was listed as a lunch special on the delivery menu online. The woman taking the order said it was only eat-in, so I just ordered it off the regular menu. If you advertise something, you should honor it. The online delivery menu does not say anything about eat-in only, just the hours it is available. 

Our order arrived 30 minutes after the promised time, which I was okay with. I worked in food service for 30 years so I understand that things happen. What was not okay was the fact that there was no plasticware or napkins, and nothing was labeled or marked, so we had to open everything to see what it was. 

Now for the food itself. The soup, Italian wedding, was bland and tasted like they just added water to some powdered bouillon and threw in some  green stuff (spinach maybe?). The meatballs tasted like rubber balls. The garlic bread was stale and hard. I was extremely disappointed.

I was pleasantly surprised with the quality. It took me back to my Brooklyn/NYC years! The crust was thin and crispy, the tomato sauce was tasty and the cheese was spread evenly and applied in just the right amount.

I've lived in the neighborhood since they opened and have ordered numerous items but the pizza is a regular item for me. There is something wrong with their ingredients apparently because the pizza doesn't taste anything like New York style or anything else for that matter. The pizza dough is completely tasteless and is undercooked to the point of being watery. But it has to be the sub-standard ingredients because pizza from a place that is called ""New York Pizza"" should not taste like this. The cheese also is totally devoid of any taste whatsoever. 

Although, from the outside this place looks so very inviting. The lighting, layout and all, it sets really high expectations... which are quickly dashed the minute you dive into your meal. It's like they really don't know, or care, what they are doing.

While dining in the staff seems like they have better things to do than, well, waiting on tables. Rushing out, dropping off whatever you order and rushing off to hide behind the veil.

1.  We showed up 5 minutes before closing and were welcomed to eat dinner. 

2.  The service, both from the waiter and the busboy, was attentive and excellent.

3.  The dish I ended up with, after sending back my initial choice, was pretty tasty.

4.  They have wine (and beer).  And they have wine that I'll drink (I'm picky), at a reasonable price.

I'm not awarding five stars because:

The ambience, IMO, is nothing spectacular, despite other reviewers liking it.  It kinda reminds me of New Jersey strip mall liquor stores, with the big, unadorned plate glass windows and Bud signs.  The chairs are comfortable, though.  

My first order was Chicken Marsala.  In general, I hate it when Marsala sauce has cream in it.  In particular, I hate it when it's not indicated on the menu.  I hate it even worse when the chicken and the pasta are drowning in said sauce, to the extent that I can barely see the two main ingredients.  The fact that it's served in a soup bowl is a testament to this.  I never learned how to swim, and wasn't about to so that I could dive into this soupy mess.  But worst of all?  The chicken was straight out of a food service frozen box, two semi-elongated patties that were breaded, identically sized (by a cookie-cutter?), full of salt, and probably worse than a Sbarro's at any turnpike pit stop coast to coast.  One bite and it was history.  

To his credit, the waiter was gracious and, despite the hour, offered to substitute any other dish.  I ""had what he was having,"" and got the Chicken Cacciatore my husband was happily slurping up.  With pieces of fresh, unbreaded chicken, fresh mushrooms, green pepper, black olives, and much less sauce than hubby's, per my request, it was delivered quickly and was pretty good.  Grated parmesan and red pepper flakes kicked up the chunky red sauce, and it was a very satisfying dish.  And because I asked for less sauce, my swimming dysfunction wasn't an issue.  Ultimately, we left satisfied, but the origin of the chicken from my first entree leaves some nagging questions unanswered.",m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,6,4,3,5z2PEX4zjM7_eHiFcMIDkQ
