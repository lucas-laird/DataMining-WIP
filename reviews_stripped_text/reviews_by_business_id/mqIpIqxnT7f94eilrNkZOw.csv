Plus, let us clarify that this is not a relocated las Vegas Boulevard location... This is the original spot and the strip location was an off shoot. 

The wife is a born and raised pinoy and I'm a Canadian who moved to the USA. 
She loves the convenience but the quality of this buffet is lacking vs what is available just a few blocks away at nanay glorias. 

The issue that I personally have is the price of some of the smaller items hon can take out that are not part of the buffet but instead widely available in China Town (as in 25 yards away in the grocery store.) 

Don't charge me 30%+ more for baked goods that aren't even imported but instead baked here in the USA vs what everywhere else charges. 

There are better buffets where you can actually serve yourself, but if you took a bus or walked from the strip, this is passable.

this particular neighbor, which really it was a neighbor cause it was in the store fronts directly in front of the polo towers, was ok.  service was typical asian restaurant, nothing to write home about.  the food was decent, and was at least warm.  the place was clean but not tidy, as there were take out boxes and other things out in the open.  not bad, but not exactly inviting either.  

i had orderd the longanisa or philippine style sausage, short and fat and this one was full of fat.  some eggs and some regular rice.  there was a choice of garlic fried rice, but i like to stick with something fresh, or is it ""presh""?  as the chances of the garlic fried rice being from leftover rice is most likely, but of course that's what you're supposed to make it out of, it's just better.  i got bottled water. typical breakpast.  

cons...well this one i think was being renovated or something, as they had exposed beams and other heating and ventilation ducts hanging outside of the drop down ceiling tiles.  the place was clean but not tidy, and the little store made snacks were out on display were just casually strewn about haphazardly.  but nothing ""dirty"", just not very neat.",f7pbQuon-3GbyNbzcNSQdQ,2,0,3,fIx3HdS2nb8i1DekJ2lmjg

The pork dish with shrimp did start to lose its appeal halfway through though, as I started to get tired of the strong seafood taste in the background.  The chicken adobo was probably my favorite.

I guess they have to deal with drunk people a lot but it's no excuse.  The food was nothing special and they charged my cousin like $2-3 for a fried egg. 

They sell a few snacks from the PI as well such as chips.",tLtahlTtx51d-3R33u1i2A,1,0,2,xd6ijOo3I4fOP1ojsNXoiQ

working a trade show in vegas make you crave for some down home cooking. sadly enough i could cook better than this restaurant with one eye closed.

my craving for rice was satisfied, but the whole filipino food experience was extremely dissatissfied. 

the only thing i like about this place is the fact that they have sarsi.

if you have a car, im pretty sure there are other filipino places out there that would be better off.",sisgRdPt85mCgANdToyMkQ,0,0,1,5wW_p1nxuQT9KDADM0ev-g

I get tired of the stuff in my work so I grab some to-go for my lunch one day. It was early so I got the ""breakfast"" items- Tocino and Tapa and was able to get garlic rice. Decent and hit the spot. 

Have also had their lechon, beef steak, kare kare, BBQ sticks,torta talong/eggplant, fried milkfish/bangus, etc and it's pretty standard and decent, but I've had better. Still the location was definitely appealing. Come here if youre on the strip looking for ""different"" cheap eats, but if you have a car go take a drive to some other Filipino spots off strip.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,4,3,3,amdCB2eqHAgRjbfDDvZaeg

After looking around for for almost an hour (nobody seems to know them ) We gave up and decided to go back to our hotel .

We walked pass this Filipino restaurant right on the mall entrance & decided to give it a try . It looked pretty decent & clean & the staff seem quite friendly.  There is a buffet alright but choices are limited ..and since it was already pass 2:00 pm my hunger pangs are beginning to react. .  My friend & I tried their combo.  2 Kinds of dishes with rice for  $6.99 .  I had the   Pork Adobo & Pampano Sinigang.  It was not  the best but I was hungry ... I finished it in a flash !! . That's probably why there was just one table occupied .  My friend ordered the  Pinakbet  & Paksiw.   Nothing really compares to that Kusina ni Lorraine Buffet which to me is one of  the best Filipino buffets in Vegas so far.  Would I go back to this Place  ?  Probably not  !!",B75woOWwO-oDVROhHR_4NQ,4,0,2,SGB6aVevyk3GfyqeivWmyw

The pork sinigang was over cooked and dry. The rice was crunchy. I will never go here again. I also bought sweet rice wrapped in banana leaves and it was over priced and disgusting.

Their squid is perfectly cooked.

The adobo is as close to perfection you will ever taste.

ANOTHER big plus, their desserts are not too sweet and just right.

I got Pork Adobo with rice.  The meat was tender...a little on the oily side tho.
