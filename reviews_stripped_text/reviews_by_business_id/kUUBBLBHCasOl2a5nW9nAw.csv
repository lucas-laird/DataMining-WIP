Read some of the reviews and was skeptical at first.  I decided to give it a try.  This is NOT a dive bar firstly.  I have to say the place was clean and I was not overwhelmed with cigarette smoke. The atmosphere was very very much a party which I was definitely in the mood for.  Right off the bat bartenders were friendly and social to EVERYONE, A++ in my book.  There was a birthday crowd that was within the karaoke party & the KJ's did an outstanding job accommodating the crowd through the rotation.  I didn't get a chance to try any of the food but what I saw coming from the kitchen looked and smelled awesome.  Another poster said something like a family atmosphere, I have to agree.  This is definitely a new watering hole for me.",d9A4dsk2cvLLMfFyicQBEw,0,0,5,C3TCw7uNtqvL1DT4m3psHg

Their current restaurant has awful food, so we don't eat when we are there. But it's always fun, especially when Sky is behind the bar!",am0PHO7h-NFVypVwnNuJxA,0,0,4,5M7Zc2S9IOvYnRZjQOmYCw

Explanation... it's a dive bar, that serves Thai and Italian. Now, I love me some Thai and I love me some Italian. However, the two combined from the same kitchen is a bit odd. The menu itself, was a nightmare to traverse. You had pad thai options with no meats listed, and no meat options listed anywhere. This is all at one price. Then you find a vegetarian area, with the same exact menu options for $2 more. The rest of the menu was so hard to navigate with blank pages mixed in, descriptions cut off, and some items having no descriptions at all. Not to mention a bartender - a worker for the establishment - having no idea what the menu options were either. So, needless to say, my cousin and I (a seasons Thai eater and enthusiast) not knowing the menu options and having nobody there to ask, meh, we'll pass.

The bloodies... I got a normal bloody. No frills. Harsh, harsh, bitter, and salty taste. The best part was eating the green olives. Actually needed to order a water to help wash it down. 

My cousin got a bacon bloody. Which, sounded great... in theory. One strip of extra crunchy, stiff, bacon in the bloody. No bacon bits mixed in, no bacon bits mixed with the salt on the rim, no actual extra bacon other than them making a standard and throwing a strip of bacon in it.

Grossly disappointed and glad we didn't give them too much of our time or money. Trust me, if you're in this area, there are TONS of other options. If it wasn't for them being a Vikings bar and me wanting to see how bad the Pats were pistol whipping the VIkings, I wouldn't have dropped in.",SU-iAuGsoDnws0oFG4VO8A,0,0,1,nEnUfoYFj76yF-PsXOs01Q
2000704,2013-02-18,1,kUUBBLBHCasOl2a5nW9nAw,"Dive bar doesn't adequately describe this bar. It's more like the ugly step-sister of the dive bar. It's a dive-dive bar, actually.

You walk in and, of course, the bar is huge and in the center of a very messy looking room. Pool tables and what passes for a juke box these days hangs on the wall. They have posters and televisions everywhere so don't you worry about visual stimulation, you'll OD on it here. 

The staff is super, super friendly. I really enjoy them. They are conversationalists and that's important. They also make really good mixed drinks.

I would have given this place another star, but the bathrooms needed work and they are short on beer selection. Also, it's just a mess to look at.

But, if you want to hang out with really friendly, down-to-earth people who make a good drink, stop by, it's worth it.",jjogE_kPPMjxKvDEFlct6w,3,2,3,zeqIxegk_3zWga61sdwLNg

They had no idea what I was talking about I asked them if they would put the game on the TV and they told me I could go into the other room where there was no waitress and I would have to walk over to the bar every time I wanted to drink, sports bar? I think not.",ZE0sXZpcsjnPN1lvwJv-ag,0,0,2,7nhA8AURmGC9PS7pbygwBA

4297133,2013-07-09,0,kUUBBLBHCasOl2a5nW9nAw,"Found out about this place through boyfriends dad and I can say I Freakin Love It. Drinks are cheap and they serve food. Not crappy bar food either, good food that also doesn't cost an arm and a leg. They have karaoke too which makes for a fun night. Everyone there is like family it seems so expect to be treated that way if you come with a regular. Crowd is a bit on the older side though. Otherwise, it's still a nice place to get a drink without it being packed full of kids.",3pg7K9tKaS4kfBnybh0pVA,2,1,4,2zrzC9a1W8LVFlDXaS2QHQ

I love a good dive bar.  Drinks are good prices, great people watching and they have greasy food.  Do they have the best decor? No.  Do they have the best tv's? No.  But is it a great dive bar?  Yes.  Just don't go in thinking you're going to a five star dining destination and just have fun.",Nsm98zUe3Qez0ucpiL3C4w,4,2,5,50HH87sfJ7EtuPgTCC4bJw

5600079,2015-05-15,0,kUUBBLBHCasOl2a5nW9nAw,"I went here for Karoake on a friday night.  They have a large bar here that is separate from a dining area that is used for the Karoake.  It's a pretty good set up for Karoake.

They have Thai food there instead of regular bar food.  The food was okay, not great.  The drinks a pretty cheap, like neighborhood bar prices.  It got a little smoky in there but not too bad.

Nothing fancy just your typical neighborhood bar that serves Thai food!",L15JCA18Ib_vMUVJILxiSw,1,2,3,8L4-zRiwyX-Pk_WIiIpfEQ
