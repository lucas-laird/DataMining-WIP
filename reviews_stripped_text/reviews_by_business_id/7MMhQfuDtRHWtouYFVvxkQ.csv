We were greeted by the server who sat us down and handed us menu's. I didn't know what to get because I wanted some pancakes but read about the Man O' War Omelet. So I decided to try the French Toast with Bananas. The French Toast was okay. My cousin on the other hand ordered the Country Fried Steak;  now that is one of the best Country Fried Steaks I have ever tried. The flavor was just perfect, it wasn't salty and the gravy didn't lack any flavor.",jEBySjq6tgL-_R3P7LHq0w,0,0,4,RxlEYbZv0ptH32VgqxUWWA

686417,2011-11-26,0,7MMhQfuDtRHWtouYFVvxkQ,"My wife found this place on Yelp, its really close so we decided to head over for breakfast before a day of Black Friday shopping! Its a great location, tucked into the Durango/Edna Plaza opposite the Italian place.

Its the only place I've seen with a drive thru as you walk in, very smart idea! Everything is neat and clean, and very well laid out.  It wasn't busy, but you wouldn't feel cramped even if it was.  I gave them a mark down for not having booths, its my favorite way to eat breakfast.  I'm a big homemade corned-beef hash fan, and I saw the couple next to me had ordered it, and it didn't look homemade.  Not sure if it was from a can, but it had the really small pre-cut square potatoes, and I couldn't see any fresh shredded or cut corned-beef.

Decided to skip the corned-beef when I saw the Man-O-War on the menu! It was an excellent omelet.  Super fresh country potatoes, the omelet had pieces of bacon, cheese, avocado, and spinach, plus your choice of toast.  My wife had the Storm Cat wrap.  She couldn't finish it but she said it was still very delicious.  Luckily for me I got to polish it off for lunch, and I'll agree with my wife that is very good.

Service was very prompt and we were seated right away.  The staff looked nice and was very  friendly, even the owners made a point of coming around to say hello and check if everything was good.  The decor is very horse themed taking after the name of the place.  Luckily its done very nice and isn't over done or tacky.

Prices for everything were all below the normal places we eat breakfast, we totaled just over $20 with two breakfast and two coffees.  We love the customer loyalty card program, they made sure we got a card and had it punched.  We'll be coming back!

**UPDATE**
Tried the corned-beef hash and it isn't homemade and not recommended for people that are particular about their corned-beef hash.   Nothing horrible or bad, just not the way I prefer mine, your mileage my vary.",hRiEOYXui4MPFFSEMASEfg,1,1,4,tVqXcXUbKsZdzAXrDOGllw

1004196,2011-08-09,3,7MMhQfuDtRHWtouYFVvxkQ,"Nestled in one of many strip malls found on Durango Drive, Del Mar Cafe is a great little spot for breakfast or lunch. 

Del Mar Cafe embraces a racetrack theme, most noticeably on their menu. Printed in a newspaper format, many menu items are named after some of the more successful racehorses. I wouldn't have been able to help naming the biscuits and gravy Seabiscuit, but somehow they resisted. The food is great and they also have a full bakery and specialty coffee selection. We had a sample of the banana nut muffins and they were warm and wonderful. I got the banana pancakes. Stacked 3 high, it was more than I could handle but if you're starving, go for it! Fresh bananas on top and some baked into the batter...yum! 

The good thing about this cafe however is where some specialize in breakfast and lunch is an afterthought, Del Mar Cafe pays attention to both. The lunch choices were just as plentiful as the breakfast, good for those early risers who have friends that want to sleep in. There are lots of TV's to catch up on sports news or current events and seating is comfy and spacious. A great spot for an inexpensive but quality meal!

That'll be something I'll be pushing on them on my next visit.  

The coffee was good, the food itself was not oily or saturated in fat.  The potatoes were cooked well and not overdone, but needed some seasoning.  The service was topnotch.  Hands down the service was very tentative and welcoming.  Both owners are constantly checking up to make sure you're happy with your meal and that you have everything you need.  This is definitely a new breakfast spot for me.

There are lots of tasty looking items to chose from on the menu.  SInce the ""Man-O-War"" omelet (bacon, avocado, spinach, roasted red peppers, jack cheese)  seemed like a popular choice, I set me sight on it. 

My GF had a wrap called ""The Storm Cat.""  It contained a delicious mixture of country potatoes, cheddar cheese and bacon.

Our waitress was friendly and admitted that she was new when we chatted her up. The DMC has this little box on the table that you can push for to get the attention of your server, get refills and even ask for the check.  But with the attentiveness of those working it was not needed during this visit.

Speaking of attentiveness we met the owners Dee & Jim as they made their rounds.  I was able to tell Dee that it was Misty Y's review that made us visit the DMC.  She even got to the read the review from my Yelp app on the phone.

I had the omelet with sausage/green peppers.  Generous portion, hot and delicious.  Would order again.

My wife and daughter had the biscuits and gravy.   Now, before I dump on Del Mar too much I must say that the B&G at Jack's in Bishop Calif is the benchmark.  Big, dense biscuits, thick, rich gravy with lots of pepper and sausage.  This did not compare.  The biscuits are just OK, a little thin and not very dense.  They splay two of them over the plate and ladle on the gravy.  Not a great presentation.  Should be in a deep bowl.  The gravy was not very hot when it arrived either.  Would not order again.  

Coffee was great, owner was great.  Based on the two items we had I'd probably come back and just not order the B&G.",8YrD0_wpzpqRctpyPn8BMg,0,0,3,rfiYp2eRpP9m-eiZX6CPAQ

I spend many days in Vegas on business and I don't get the sense their are many Ma and Pa places like Del Mar in town.  I found the service attentive and friendly and the owner and his wife were helping bus tables and seat patrons. I love that!

Now to the most important part: FOOD! I got the Man o' War Omelette with egg whites and replaced the bacon with turkey. YES, I REPLACED BACON. I have a committed a life-time crime of not liking it. It was delicious, fresh, and well-made! I opted for the country potatoes which were cooked well. My bestfriend got the eggs benedict which he swiftly finished in less than ten minutes. The eggs were fresh and poached perfectly. 

In all, Del Mar Cafe doesn't greatly distinguish itself from other good breakfast places like The Cracked Egg, but they cook a great decent American breakfast. If you're looking for not-too-fancy breakfast done right, I would visit this cafe!",JteQGisqOf_pklq7GA0Rww,0,0,4,gcyXhWMtu6D_AgUfTdMtOQ

Prices are beyond reasonable, the omelettes are super fluffy and not greasy, the wraps are big and fresh, the home fries are perfectly seasoned, the tuna salad is not mayoey, the owners are really friendly, there are plenty of wide parking spots if you want to bring your Ferrari, and it's really a cafe with a high-ceilinged, bistro-like atmosphere. 

Free and fast wireless internet. Plenty of tables inside so you don't feel bad nursing a cup of coffee and a sandwich while working on your MacBook.

Have eaten here 4 times already. Loving the ""Rafael Bejarano"" wrap (tuna on Spinach tortilla) with 1000 Island dressing instead of mayo. Hash browns as my side, cup of coffee. Cool detail: they bring a condiment carrier to your table which bottles of Tapatio, Cholula, Tabasco, Ketchup and Yellow Mustard in it.

Did a show a couple seasons ago in Aiken, SC, in the heart of thoroughbred country (Northern horse owners fly South for the winter to train their horses year-round.)

I thought the Reuben sandwich I ordered was huge! Love the toasted Rye. Thought the corned beef was WAYYYY too salty. It was overkill in fact! Would have loved to have seen more sauerkraut on the sandwich as well. It was one of those slightly inedible sandwiches with too much meat packed into it and that made it difficult to take a bite out of and then you have to re-build it. So those were my only two complaints.  However I loved the crinkle cut fries. Reminds me of childhood. Husband ordered an omelet. He loved every bite! 

There is plenty of seating. Also, have counter seating as well. Clean. A little chilly, temperature wise so bring a cardigan, girls. Lots of omlet choices. Good ol' diner food choices.

I had the Man O' War Omelette.  It's an omelette filled with bacon, spinach, roasted red peppers, and jack cheese and topped with avocado.  With comes your choice of home fries, home fries with onion and pepper, or hash browns.  I chose the home fries with peppers and onion.  You also get choice of toast, biscuit or English muffin.  I went with the rye toast.

The omelette was large and very filling and the home fries were excellent.  I was glad I got the onion and peppers fried with the potatoes.  I chose rye toast.  While waiting for the breakfast to arrive, the owner and barista this morning, brought me a mini carrot cake muffin to start out and he made sure my coffee cup was filled.  

I recommend this place highly.  It deserves all 5 stars.  Service is excellent, and the owner and his wife were very attentive and pleasant.  The horse racing theme is interesting.  On each table, there's a little call box.  On it are buttons for four things--service, drink, bill, or cancel.  If you press one of the buttons, a colored number lights on a board on the wall in the front of the restaurant.  The server can see if you need more drinks or want your bill.  The small box is like a mini KENO board.  There's also a drive through if you want to get a coffee or other drink from espresso bar and pick it up at the window.

4451565,2012-06-17,0,7MMhQfuDtRHWtouYFVvxkQ,"I ventured to Del Mar Cafe with my family on Father's Day. We arrived and the place was in full swing. I could tell they were definitely getting a lot of business. There were a lot plates on the counter-top area that had not been cleaned off, and they stayed there while my family waited for our table. 

Somehow we must have walked in at the right time because the next few groups who came in were told the wait for a table would be 20-30 minutes. I can understand why; Del Mar Cafe makes everything on their menu to order. So don't come here expecting the quickest service and it will be all good. Especially when it is busy.

As for food - I had 2 pancakes, 3 over easy eggs, and 2 sausage patties. I was very tempted to order something from their Espresso Bar, but went with just a Coke. Maybe next time. My father raved over his Eggs Benedict, which came on a bed of spinach and tomatoes. He also opted for an extra side of Canadian bacon. I kind of wish I'd gotten his dish! My mother got the same thing as me, but got a big fluffy waffle instead of pancakes. My brother decided to eat lunch, since we were there around Noon. He got the chicken wrap (minus the avocado) and he said it was great. The portion was HUGE! 

Overall the food is a definite 5 Star. However, the service was a bit spotty. I was never asked if I wanted my Coke refilled. I sipped it slowly throughout my meal, because somehow I just knew I wouldn't get a refill - and my premonition came true. It wasn't until our waitress came to take away my plate that she asked if I wanted a refill, to which I refused, because I was at the end of my meal anyway. My mother and father got refills on their iced tea and coffee... so why not refill the sodas my brother and I had? *shrug* I have no idea.

I will come back to try their lunch I think AND the Espresso Bar. I highly recommend this place if you're looking for made-from-scratch, made-to-order food.",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,0,0,4,9XoaKYHvR4zer_wWwpSX5g

You can get a punch card for a free breakfast and they are so nice about punching it each time.  

The biggest positive that helps is they speak to my 2 year old and understand if she losing her mind or moves 100 times in 4 mins which helps me.
