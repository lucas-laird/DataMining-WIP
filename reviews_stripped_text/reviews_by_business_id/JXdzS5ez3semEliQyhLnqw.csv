1527587,2018-03-16,3,JXdzS5ez3semEliQyhLnqw,"Thanks Yelp for alerting me to The Dapper Doughnut's existence! I've been down the downstairs ""restaurant alley"" of the MGM, but it's changed a lot & I wouldn't have thought to go down there. 

The Dapper Doughnut is basically customizable, mini donuts (the size of doughnut holes). The friendly worker let us sample one of the cinnamon sugar donuts and I was sold faster than you could say ""The Dapper Doughnut""! 

I thought it would be like underwhelming like Pips in Portland, but these were so good - very fresh, soft, & warm. Also, I'm usually a cake doughnut person, so I'm not easily persuaded by yeast doughnuts. 

You can get 6 piece (up to 2 different types of flavors), 12 piece (up to 4 different flavors), 24 piece (up to 6 different flavors) & 48 piece. From there, you choose your flavors! We went for half cinnamon sugar and then s'mores (chocolate drizzle topped with a mini marshmallow & chocolate (chocolate drizzle with rainbow sprinkles). Also, the box that it comes in is so cute! Definitely dapper. 

Only complaint is that there was no seating anywhere to enjoy our delightful doughnuts!

1673282,2018-04-19,6,JXdzS5ez3semEliQyhLnqw,"Dapper Donut is a tiny spot to get tiny donuts for a (relatively) tiny price in the Underground area of MGM. Perfect for a treat when you're running early (am I the only one who does that?) to an event or when your friends are perpetually running late to meet you (insert hard side eye here).

The 6 piece is $6 and the 'nuts are light and made fresh to order. The cinnamon sugar flavor is often recommended by the staff, but I most recently tried PBJ, Nutella Dream, and Turtle. They were all pretty tasty but I wish they had grape for the PBJ rather than just reusing the strawberry syrup (previous photos show real strawberries on the ND?). Flavors with a sauce drizzle and a sprinkle for texture seem to be the best bang for your buck (turtle, strawberry bella, smores). 

NOTE: The 6 piece is currently only available in 2 flavors per new policy. If you're polite they may still do 3, so you and a friend can try a few each. So be nice!",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,16,15,4,K4i3hZbOr8MZCpwo9yiCyw

The location is convenient if you parked in MGM's garage, but I parked at the free parking at the Tropicana so it's a bit of a walk over to this underground hallway at the Grand. 

It's only a counter, but it's a nice counter. The service is friendly.

Basically, delicious mini donuts in a variety of flavors. I won't necessarily go out of my way to get these, but if you are in the area they are worth a taste.",TprC8sujz8MkwuomrqUSiw,27,24,4,tXMKBiehXPjIzMs2mZUZPQ
2291689,2018-06-09,1,JXdzS5ez3semEliQyhLnqw,"So in consistent fashion, I am FINALLY able to get around to this review with two visits now under my belt here and the 5 star rating doesn't do justice here. Go figure, I despise Dapper Day at Disneyland, but I am going gaga for The Dapper Doughnut in MGM!

Thanks to scouting it out ahead of time navigating here was a breeze. You start on the park map (literally) in the front lobby of MGM and head towards the Brad Garrett Comedy Club which almost seems like a walk of shame as I was there when they first opened. These are the perfect comfort food though with or without the shame. Ha-ha! I think by far the best part is, you'll know when you're getting close to it. Immediately when turning the corner you can smell the freshly prepared doughnuts from a mile away. I practically full on sprinted at that point and I am a very ""leisurely"" walker if you get my drift.

Before I get to the food I do have to recognize the staff. On both occassions I had nothing but top notch politeness. Although when you do seem overly excited to devour their craft I'd think that brings out a good mood from anyone. I enjoy the time they take when creating each doughnut flavor and don't treat the experience like a conveyor belt. Call me crazy, but I really do appreciate that most of all. 

On a semi empty stomach this will suck, but now time to start describing the doughnuts. I have chosen the 12 pack each time because it seems really like a steal at a $8.99 price tag even for miniature doughnuts. They allow you up to 4 different flavors and as you can see from my picture of the menu there is so much to be desired. It took me FOREVER to decide (I'm talking days in advance) and even when I was there waiting to order I was so back and forth. Yes I am that die hard when it comes to mini doughnuts and crazy enough to say these can compete with my favorite (mini doughnuts from the Minnesota State Fair). It's taken me about 30 years to find a place that could?!?

So overall, I can say that these are super soft as they are made to order and not caked in oil or grease so I can sum its appearance up in one word: Dapper. They get delicately placed in a blue to-go box, but truthfully eat them right away. I ate mine while on the Monorail (the second visit) and while they were still marvelous, nothing would beat in the moment.

The Smores one is literally just that. It's like having a personal camp site on the strip. I thought the marshmallow on the top was an intricate touch and one of the few places that advertise Smores and have it taste like it! I also selected Turtle pretty much because of drooling over the pictures on Yelp at the time of discovering this. I did enjoy the caramel sauce and chopped pecan crumble topping, but it really didn't move me to want more (just my preference). What did and certainly what I'd call a sleeper flavor was the Blueberry Lemon. I tried this one because I adore blueberries, but deep down I went in thinking this combo was going to flop, but boy was I wrong. It is a bit on the sweet side, but it really was layered well. You get that punch of blueberry at first and then hooks in the lemon and the vanilla aftertaste is a guaranteed twelve round TKO. If you're tossed between what to get I'd say bet on this one! Also during the initial visit I had the PB+J and that is another surprise. It tastes just like the sandwich and it took me back while ""adulting"". Being an adult I guess really has its perks?!?

All in all, I don't know of an opportunity beyond this to get a mini doughnut on the strip, but my prayers were certainly answered! For a light snack or even breakfasting like yours truly your tummy will say double down on 20 for a visit to Dapper Doughnut!",o0TZ2hroc7DK6CM73ll-1g,0,1,5,73x3PNkEwwErThBD3x77Ig

They have SO many different flavors to choose from and they'll so unique! We ordered 24 donuts, but I'm pretty sure we could've finished all 48. I wasn't the one who ordered though so I'm not sure how many flavors you can choose for each set.

We got the Cinnamon Sugar, Blueberry Lemon Glaze, Strawberry Bella, and PB & J. But I would definitely go back for the Smores, Turtle, Fluffer Nutter, and Cinn City (no idea what that is but I like the sound of it).

10/10 would get Cinnamon Sugar again. Same with Blueberry Lemon Glaze, which has a blueberry on top! It's super cute and colorful.

Probably wouldn't get the Strawberry Bella or PB&J again though. Strawberry Bella was strawberry glaze with cinnamon sugar on top I think. For the PB&J, I think the jelly kinda overpowered the peanut butter.

2533281,2017-09-28,1,JXdzS5ez3semEliQyhLnqw,"I LOVEEEEEEE their tiny donuts!!  MUST EAT!!!  

I like to think I'm a connoisseur of donuts. I eat them religiously every Sunday.  Probable eat it more often than I go to mass. Also, I'm original from Portland, OR where we are supposed to be known for our Voodoo donuts which I rather like to call Voodoo-dookey! I think their donut is just mediocre & over priced. Not sure what the hype is over them. I think Safeway donuts are way better than them.  Remember this is just MY opinion so don't hate on me cuz you are addicted to Dookey donuts k. 

Anyways, about these amazing fluffy delicious small donuts. Words cannot describe how amazing these donuts are! We flew in a couple of days ago & every single day we've been getting them.  It is magic in your mouth. The soft donut literally melts as it touches your lips. So delicious!! I think it's made of cake flour or something so it's not dense as most donuts. 

They have several flavors to pick from, but my favorite is cinnamon & sugar. If I'm courageous I'll get their powder donuts, but I gotta check to make sure the powder isn't all around my mouth or on my chest/clothes.

If you have any issues with your donuts one of the owner will usually be working & they will handle any issues you have. They believe in providing excellent service! They will even give you a sample of their donuts if you are unsure of making a purchase. Really great guys & I love that they work there so you are sure to get great customer service. 

I hope the next time I come back to MGM they will still be here or my  would break a little.  It's my lil taste of heaven!!!!!",Isim4BQsF7bF28Te3GFvJw,0,1,5,SJBKvYU9XYMdXbSRXTmLQQ

The morning I went to go pick up donuts, the gentleman working said he'd be right back-- I assumed to go get the donuts. He immediately starts making them right then, they weren't ready upon pickup and because of this he was rushing to make them. The icing did not stick to the donuts because they were too hot and then when he went to put the pearl sprinkles on, none of them stuck because there was no icing to stick to. They were incredibly sloppy looking, and not at all what I would expect with an advanced notice. I even had to add my own blue icing to them just so they looked decent enough to serve at the event.

We walked up to the counter on our way out to order.  There was no one else around.  We were trying to decide what to get and ended up with a 24-pack.

It was nice to see the donuts being made in front of us and I got quite a kick out of it.  Still, she said nothing.  She finished making and boxing them and handed them to us without a word.  No thank you, have a good night, or goodbye.  I was disappointed to say the least.

The donuts themselves were not bad.   They tasted excellent while fresh and hot, but were soggy when they cooled.

I have tried 4 of the 14 flavors they offer and I'll certainly be back to try the rest!",ry2QwSoOXQCS5K9Sv7wTjw,3,1,5,xb6upzYZiIxG8r8KqcFufA

They took a while to make them since, I guess someone messed with the machine and the guy working there is new.",rTSBDuGLi3rKojaeEwzZ9w,0,1,3,6xQPD-YO3Bh7uGUGLcxKPA

It's located right at the entrance (from the parking garage) so if you're like me, you pick up a bag of half dozen bites and walk the casino floor with an easy snack.  Actually, they didn't even make it to the lobby - I'd already devoured them. 

The downside to the Dapper is that the yummy, warm, lightly crunchy donut bites are made to order, and today there was only one gentleman making the orders. With two people ahead of me, I waited what felt like 5 minutes and left with only the cinnamon sugar flavor. There's lots of toppings to customize your 6, 12, or more donetts, but it felt like I was insisted upon the cinnamon sugar when I asked about the others. Maybe it was to save time. 

Well, I'll come back soon and try then! With MGM's parking being free for the first hour it's no hassle.",HixtBO7z5OW5bo_6qo6D_g,6,3,3,kkumeky9oI3rFyu-ufyPBg

The owner is fellow Air Force, as is my husband, and he gave us the best customer service. Both employees were pleasant and the donuts were delicious! Highly recommend this place when coming to the MGM. They're located in ""The Underground"" right when you come in from the parking garage. Check them out!",mFFifDElIr1YW-OSgYkTfQ,0,0,5,TsSaNWd0MuDUCWn2Mh3SNA
5853254,2018-02-02,0,JXdzS5ez3semEliQyhLnqw,The woman working the counter was so sweet! I wanted a variation of two of their donuts and she happily obliged with no extra charge! Not to mention the donuts were absolutely delicious. You will certainly want a minimum of at least 6 to yourself seeing as they are about half a bite each. If you are staying at the MGM or neaby I strongly suggest giving them a try.,y8lDaLQe44VfiVxUju98ow,1,0,5,_3UbfUMf1dPKJDFWABIn0g

The donuts are made fresh and the are oh-so-perfectly-tiny. It's a one bite kind of donut and they are super light. This means you can order and eat a dozen and it feels like you've only had one of regular size. I'm very experienced in this, trust me.

They have coffee too. Win-win.",NhgU7RhuYYFmpkb1jlYJ6Q,22,23,4,UrPTDXi-0v3Y3aqslkhsew

The donuts here might be small, more like a donut hole, but they pack a huge punch of flavor!!  So many varieties blending sugars, syrups and toppers for anything you could want for a sweet treat.   

I tried a dozen and mixed the flavors.   You can get up to 4 per box, though because I was shooting an vlog I got a little sampler treat of all the flavors.  My favorites were the s'more and CinCity.   S'more was topped with a little marshmallow such a cute box!!! 

Best stop on the strip for a familiar treat done an unfamiliar way!!!",sGI1svtG_retrGgnythe1g,0,0,5,PP0WEHp577jNctsIQ83YZA
