It smelled pretty bad when I first walked in....but don't worry it's just the smell of daikon...which is a good thing. Only other people in the restaurant were Koreans, which gave me some confidence that the meal would be authentic. 

I was not let down. This place produces some great home style Korean cuisine. 

Banchan is fantastic. So was the tofu soup (I forget the proper name) and every other dish we ordered.

1409411,2017-04-08,0,cAs1-wyAjvfsK1Vgo1jCWA,"Came here for a quick take out order while still at J Karaoke. My friend had been raging about the mandu saying they are pretty legit and similar to what we had in Korea in spring 2016. We had arrived at like 10:40-10:45 and was told they were closed with last call being at 10:30. I took that as the kitchen was closed at 10:30 but i guess my friend took it was the dining room was closed and asked if take out was possible. They answered yes. 

We ordered 1 order of the mandu's - half kimchi, half normal pork. Each order comes with 10 dumplings. The dumplings came out in like 10 minutes. We took it back to karaoke before we ate it. The dumplings were nice and hot. The dipping sauce it comes is nice and balanced. Not too sweet/salty. 

The dumplings were nicely pan seared. Its nice to see someone do it properly and not deep fry the entire thing or steam it. The size were pretty good. Not as filled as what is made at home but much more than most places overall. 

I could easily eat a few orders of these dumplings. They are nice and flavorful. It's kind of hard to distinguish between the normal pork vs pork and kimchi but they were both equally yummy. The dumpling skin isn't too thick which is nice. I'd almost say they are more manufactured skins vs homemade. 

Would love to come back and try other dishes in the future",Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,2,2,4,v0DK7sFJYPQOSz3NpwMksw

We had a party of 11 and it was clear that they are understaffed. Only one waitress in the front, and two ladies cooking in the back. Two more parties came in after us so they were all over the place. 

The waitress was very sweet and she tried her best but was very in-experienced. She took awhile to set up the table, bring out drinks and gave only 2 sets of sides (4 sides per set) for our entire party. 

We ordered 3 soups which came out pretty quickly, then one hot stone bibimbap came out then the other 6 took another 25 minutes to come out. 

Food is pretty good, tastes like other bibimbap, nothing unique. $10 for regular bibimbap and $12 for hot stone pot. 

Overall, food tastes good and service was decent. They just need more staff because the meal took almost 2 hours for just bibimbap and soup.",7svBs9qqPJHPRXZ56Q3ZuQ,2,0,3,W_py1IrA53zHpWhabjfd4w

Heart-felt and made with love, home-cooked Korean food has a new home on West Spring Mountain!

Occupying the former So Good Cafe spot, Kkulmat is a clean, no-frills spot for Korean eats. The owners are two Koreans that share the kitchen responsibilities and knock out traditional dishes like Jjamppong, Bibimbab, Soondubu, Tteok-bokki, kalguksu, etc..

My love and I came in recently and really enjoyed the food.Their pan fried Mandu dumplings are made in house and worth taking note of...we had some in a Spicy Cold Noodle entree that were lovely. I also have a lot of love for the banchan. They brought out five items for us to share. They were all better than average, and I was a fan of the cucumber salad. Though simple, this dish paired well with the spicier items we were eating. The space is nothing to write home about though. Kkulmat reminded me of Island Style both in the approach to food, and also in setting, though Kkulmat is a little cleaner and more organized. This isn't a place you take a date to impress them, this is a spot you go for tasty, unabashed Korean dishes. 

It was slow while we were in and one of the owners came out of the kitchen...with a beaming smile she received our compliments, and I knew that this was someone's mom literally cooking for me. I didn't need to see her warm smile to know this, it was already evident in each bite of food, but the encounter accentuated the notion...and also cemented the fact that we will return for some more home-cooked style Korean food.",A5A34ixb-yy6nwL42iZsnw,30,23,4,TSS1Bj5xTRlK9ZQLyULNkA

There aren't too many Korean restaurants open for breakfast, breakfast being relative in Las Vegas, so after much searching found this little place. 

I've been leary about yelp's rating on food, since it's so political. Seems friends and family help get the ratings up because some of the places we've been to was only worth a laugh. 

However we were getting desperate to find a good place nearby when I read the review saying it was family owned and operated. GOOD CHOICE! 

Another yelper wrote that her bibimbap was good but not fancy. That's exactly what we wanted! Just a small FYI, bibimbap was originally just leftovers mixed with rice and gochu-jang. 

Anyway, it's a small mom and pop with clean open space filled with tables, chairs and window plants. A large open counter and the most smiley, sweet and efficient server. The menu is simple with pictures (for those not completely comfortable with Korean) 

The food is also simple, authentic Korean like my mom used to make. Every dish had their own distinct taste. The broth was deep and satisfying, we had yook-hwae jang. The price was outstanding, neighborhood joint range. Not the ""you're in Vegas"" range.

We ordered
-Spicy Seafood Noodle Soup
-Spicy Cold Noodle with Pan Fried House-made Dumplings
-Kimchi Pancake 

The noodle soup had a clean taste with lots of seafood...I really loved the Udon noodles in it. My favorite dish of the evening though was the spicy cold noodles. The sauce for the cold noodles is Cho-Go-Choo-Jang, which is a red pepper paste with vinegar and seasoning. We asked for extra and covered all the components with this delicious and spicy sauce. The dumplings in this dish were almost perfect for my taste--the freshly prepared filling was the best I have had in Vegas.  The Kimchi Pancake was crispy in first bite but doughy and soft in the middle.

The banchan were better than you'd find in most Korean restaurants. I loved their cucumber salad and the julienne cut radish kimchi...two of my favorites. 

Kkulmat literally means honey taste, but in conversation, it describes something really delicious...and Kkulmat Kitchen stands by the name so well.  I will be sure to come back and try other offerings on the menu.

Service was awesome and the staff was great. I didn't catch our server's name, but she was really nice. The restaurant itself is a casual sit down; not fancy at all. It is very clean and pretty spacious throughout. As for their menu, it is very simple and there's not much you can customize. I know some people prefer a more vast menu, but don't let a selective menu fool you. What I love about places with a very specific menu, is that you know they are the best at making just those items. ;] In most cases, they are chef specialties.

I have tried their spicy noodle bowl, spicy tofu soup, kimchi fried rice, and several other dishes. A must-try is their fried dumplings. They are homemade; and you can tell by the flavor and quality. You do have the option of ordering them steamed, but the fried one seems to be more popular.

I've became a regular here for good reason. I love authentic Asian food because, being Asian myself, I am pretty picky about how certain foods will live up to my expectations. So, if you are looking to have a casual meal that has authenticity, freshness, and flavor, I highly recommend this place. :]",EEAoUs1w38JHfHZMeSdqPQ,6,4,5,r6GCU9F3BQh_p1nz0lDvGA

The waitress informed us that the dumplings are made in house. The side dishes were yummy and plentiful. We left full and happy. :)

I learned everything is all made from scratch, fresh & tasty. The menu is simple with photos of each dishes. They are different from other Korean restaurant as they do not serve AYCE or BBQ but served homemade individual dishes which was exactly what I was looking for.

After we ordered, you are given 4 complementary side dishes. The food came out fast too.

We had Dumplings, Hot pot Bibimbab, Spicy Tofu seafood soup and Fish cake.

I personally love the Spicy Tofu seafood soup. The soup has octopus, mussel, tofu, shrimp and clams and an egg on the side to add it to the hot pot. If you like spicy I would recommend that.

3591750,2017-04-02,4,cAs1-wyAjvfsK1Vgo1jCWA,"You might forget you're in the USA when you're eating this Korean food - the food here legitimately tastes like one of the common traditional Korean restaurants all over the streets of Korea. Talking to the owners - it makes sense. The family-owned restaurant features food made primarily by the front of the house's mother. She cooked in Korea for years making the same food she makes here. The kimchi is made from scratch and the dumplings are literally made by hand. While not EVERY single ingredient is made from scratch (like noodles), the flavors here are balanced and everything tasted exactly as expected.

Service was prompt and food came out surprisingly fast, but I can see how they can get overwhelmed if there was a large party. The front of the house speaks English quite well, so it is easy to ask about the food.

We managed to enjoy the Tteokbokki (rice cakes in spicy sauce with fish cake, onions, and cheese/ramen for an add-on), chicken Kalguksu (knife-cut noodles in a savory broth with veggies and chicken), and their pan-fried Mandoo (hand-made and filled with plenty of meat and some veggies). The mandoo here is particularly a star, with its crispy edges on the skin and an ample amount of filling. The Kalguksu was solid with a flavorful broth and good texture on the noodles and a good amount of chicken. The tteokbokki sauce was very good, though I didn't personally like the rice cake as much as some that I've had before. I prefer a soft and chewy tteok and this one had an oddly smooth outside layer to it. Still, it was decent and the other ingredients in the dish were well done.

It is nice to see a family-owned Korean restaurant that delivers on its promise of quality authentic flavors in its food. Can't wait to go back here!",KbwOwQZTOfrtaeJdmucALQ,5,4,5,Ky3TdZdyRq_K-HedEmX9Vg

I first came across this family owned restaurant by chance with my sisters. We were formally greeted in Korean (-Hello)! Seated immediately with water and menus. One of the nice lady ask if it was our first time. She went over the Menu with us and explained about how they make everything out of scratch and recommended that we order their Mandu-Korean dumplings. Wow! The dumplings were simply delicious and consistent with flavors without being too soggy. They are available in 2 versions: Pan fried or Steamed. Both are delicious and great for sharing. Another item that stood out for us was the Kimchi Fried Rice, prepared just right without being overcook. The dish was seasoned and balanced with a good amount of heat. All meals are served with Banchan-side dishes. Each side dish was on point and lived up to being fresh and homemade. My sisters and I have been regulars here and never had any issues. Its been our to go place whenever we are craving for delicious Korean food.

Pro Tip:
-This establishment is NOT an AYCE Korean BBQ.
-Traditional Korean food in a casual family setting.

I ordered the tofu soup with seafood. Now I didn't have too high of expectations for it since really tasty tofu soup is so hard to come by, but this one was delicious!! I didn't even realize I ate the entire bowl! Not the absolute best I've had but pretty good to satisfy an overdue craving. 
Hubby ordered the cold noodles. Although not his #1 in town, he still ranked it high up there behind the mul-naengmyun at Tangtangtang.

If you see big brown pots on the side of the entrance, those are traditional Korean pots filled with homemade Go-Chu-Jang (spicy Korean chili paste) and Tang-Jang (Korean Miso), and Gang-Jang (soy sauce) fermenting and used in the various dishes on the menu. They're made from only the freshest ingredients, all natural, nothing processed. No MSG in this house. The quality of the food surpasses those fancier Korean ""fusion"" joints. Selection is simple but, everything we tasted was made with care and by the owner herself. Service was friendly, warm, and inviting. We loved everything we ordered down to the little side dishes (panchan). Their braised ""spicy"" short ribs (Galbi-Chim) was out of this world tender. They use the homemade Korean chili paste and you can ask to make it less spicy or no spice. Kimchi pancake was perfect. Crispy on the outside but soft, moist and tender on the inside. We like ours without the seafood. Just the kimchi. You can ask for that. Bone broth was used for the rice cake soup with Nori and generous pieces of beef that were so tender with no gristle. The proprietor is Sung Hee Choi. Give this amazing place a try. You won't be disappointed. Read her story on Las Vegas Seven.

The steamed meat dumplings are made with lean pork so they are on the dryer side if you are used to having juicy fatty dumplings. 

The Chicken Bulgogi has by far the best Bulgogi sauce used ever. I usually like to eat beef Bulgogi but I think I will be eating this shizzz more often.

The Kalbi (Galbi) is thick and juicy. Most places skimp out on that and charge the same price as this place. This one has about the same flavor as most good Kalbi spots so you are still getting your money's worth. Not to mention when you get the 12 grain bomb ass purple rice and side dishes they let you get refills on the sides you like a lot; huge plus on that by them.

I took my leftovers home cuz I couldn't finish it and it still delicious (unlike other places ) the week later I stop by and order a steam dumplings for take out, yes it's the best!! However, the side dish only for dinning only. The food more like homemade, simple and delicious. I'll definitely come back for the delicious food and delicious side dish",SUXM0U20tBmwE8a80K-Gsg,0,2,4,OxOmvQ-fqU_RR1nN4VwMBA
5017888,2017-10-28,1,cAs1-wyAjvfsK1Vgo1jCWA,"Came here for lunch and had their seafood and beef tofu soup. This definitely is a mom and pop no frills korean restaurant that serves korean comfort food. Menu items include soups, cold noodles, spicy rice cake, galbijim and stews. The meat dishes are a tad pricey but other stuff on the menu is decently priced. 

The tofu soup was enjoyable. The tofu is broken up and not in big chunks like other places. It also comes with an egg. The flavor was good and they do have good portion sizes. They can also adjust the spice level for you. They also serve the soup with purple rice which I really enjoy. 

Since this is a mom and pop shop, service is decent. The older lady who is the waitress is not too attentive but there's a call button on each table to notify her if you need something. I'm definitely gonna come back to try other items on the menu.",CQZpblGIHeMlD7KqNP7J7Q,3,1,4,Eyjg1cPuofhc2wtetrfltg
5019482,2018-03-18,0,cAs1-wyAjvfsK1Vgo1jCWA,"We were driving through Vegas after a week of camping/cabinning in Utah and was craving some good Korean food. I was thinking Kimchi Jjigae or Oxtail dumpling soup. Most of the other Korean restaurants on Yelp featured Korean BBQ, which was not what we wanted. We wanted mom's cooking. Kkulmat was exactly that - it offers simple but delicious traditional Korean home cooking. We ordered two bowls of Rice cake and dumpling in beef broth and a kimchi Jjigae. Both were excellent. Very tasty, almost just like mom's (can't say it is exactly like mom's because everyone's mom's is always the best). The banchan was good too. The kimchi was tasty (not sour). The potato salad was one of the best I have had. Kkulmat made the rest of the long drive home easy. We recommend it highly.",YZYF93eDB9fNAnQLToBV_A,0,0,5,fq-78cmZauE8JyWKRrHBQg

5220856,2017-03-25,0,cAs1-wyAjvfsK1Vgo1jCWA,"I came in for dinner and their dinning room was empty so my party got to chose where to sit. Just looking around it seemed like a plain environment, nothing stood out to me and the place was quiet. I seen an employee prepping food at the table behind us and another employee who was next to her took our order within 5 to 10 minutes sitting down. We ordered the Bibimbab, Grilled Croacker, and Dumplings. With the Grilled Croacker it came with a pot of purple rice, which was different to me but it tasted the same as any other rice. They serve unlimited side dishes such as kimchee, cucumbers, and potato salad. 

It took about 10 minutes for our entire order to come out after ordering and our server was really kind and persistent with checking up on us. She always ensured that if we needed anything to just let her know. She always thanked us and brought us any type of sauce we asked for. She provided us with an individual pitcher of water so that we wouldn't be waiting on it. It was a great experience. The reason why I gave this place 3 stars because there wasn't any ""wow"" factors that made me want to recommend or crave to come back. There weren't as much food varieties available, most of the dishes were easy and simple dishes you could make at home.",80qYPp6Fk_jmO3334DKGGg,0,1,3,rAwSYlQwPRG_dSnrSwQU5g

5349125,2017-03-15,2,cAs1-wyAjvfsK1Vgo1jCWA,"I had a sudden craving for kalguksu one night, which lead my boyfriend to do a search on yelp for them. We knew that a lot of Korean restaurants in Las Vegas don't serve this particular dish -- why? We don't know. Not popular enough perhaps? However! Kkulmat showed up and their menu said they had a chicken kalguksu! Score! I've been meaning to try this place and now was the time! 

It's located where the old So Good Cafe was and you can't miss it because they didn't do anything to change the interior. So you'll probably see a lot of the old decorations from the old cafe -- macaroons on the wall and a coffee cup decoration on another wall. The tables and chairs all seem the same as well ...  But you don't need to be afraid because this five star review isn't dedicated towards their decorations. 

We came in for their food, hoping to find something warm and comforting. We were also hoping to find something other than the usual popular Korean flavors aka KBBQ. 

My boyfriend and I decided to share three dishes: chicken kalguksu (chicken noodle soup), pan fried mandu (dumplings), and tteokbokki (spicy rice cake) with cheese. From some of the reviews and tips on this establishment, the dumplings are made in house here and by hand. And you know what? That definitely shows. The dumplings were amazingly delicious. I wouldn't mind just getting an order to go for lunch during work days. They don't skimp on the meat and it is packed with flavor. The skin of the dumpling is pan fried perfectly for that crispness. 

The tteokbokki had really good flavor and they definitely give you a good portion! The rice cakes were really soft but they weren't that chewy. It was delicious. Though next time, I would've probably preferred it to be spicier. 

The chicken kalguksu is most definitely home made. The broth is very light in flavor and there is plenty of chicken in there! It also has zucchini and a few mushrooms -- they sprinkle nori on top and that gives it a lovely aroma. Definitely satisfied my craving! The only problem that I'll see is that the flavor of this dish may get muted if you eat it after the tteokbokki. So, if you order this dish, be sure to eat it before anything spicy or heavy in flavor. 

I would definitely come back to Kkulmat. I also hope that their business runs well because it's really hard to find Korean restaurants that home make their own stuff. Plus.. I'm in love with their dumplings! I need to come back to eat more!!!!!!!",oqTZC9WriodTCby6jl0LfQ,6,3,5,ll9QOiwqnRIPGmteRxDiJw
5377846,2017-03-15,1,cAs1-wyAjvfsK1Vgo1jCWA,"Cute small restaurant with fantastic food and catchy Korean music! The owners are actually Korean and they seemed like a family owned business, which you don't see very often. They make every item on their menu from scratch and it comes in large portions. 
Service was great, he answered all the questions we asked and even recommended some items. 

Our orders come with the usual side dishes that you get when you go to a Korean spot, and the food came out in a reasonable time. 
Their homemade dumplings came out first, so delicious especially with the dipping sauce! The tofu soup w/beef was just as good, just the right amount of spice to it and even came with their style of brown rice ( purple rice). Kimchee fried rice was delicious and could feed two people,lastly the seafood onion pancake was perfectly cooked. Crispy in the outside but warm and soft on the inside. 

Will come back! Gonna try their fried chicken next time!",rSMrbp4gdGOceEcHO-sipA,1,1,5,Lj3aQ2fGilohwnQQHeEb9w

This is a family owned restaurant and they actually treat their customers like family as well. Right when we walked in, we were greeted warmly and allowed to sit anywhere in the restaurant. The servers were all super friendly and smiled sincerely every time they came to serve us. We decided on the chicken kalguksu, kimchi pancake, and seafood udon. Right after our order, they brought out the sides, which were amazing! And unlike many other Korean places, they kept asking us if we would like more sides whenever one was about to run out. I was so focused on how great the sides tasted, I almost forget we ordered actual entrees. All of our order came out at the same time, and the granny of the shop was the sweetest of them all! She made sure we liked the kimchi pancake and would always check to see if we needed anything. 

In addition to amazing service, all three orders tasted amazing! The chicken kalguksu was very tasteful and the chicken was cooked to perfection. I also liked the huge amount of seaweed that they added on top of the soup. Many places will just sprinkle a little, but I liked that I tasted the seaweed in every bite. The seafood udon was also very delicious, however, i will say that it was a little spicy for me, since I can only handle mild. But if you can handle medium spicy, then I would definitely recommend it! Last, but not least, the kimchi pancake was amazing! The granny did an amazing job making that pancake and I wish I was able to tell her in Korean how great it tasted! I will definitely be back to try the homemade dumplings next time!",2xq3kA-X6o_wPQht76lWag,4,2,5,hXfcY4dV-rxj_IaNo2jGHQ
