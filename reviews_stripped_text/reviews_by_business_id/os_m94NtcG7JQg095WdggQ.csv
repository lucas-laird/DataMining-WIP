I had a sample of the honey milk tea and I have to say that it's the best I've ever tasted, especially in a city that has so many boba places with honey milk tea!

His coffee is probably the best in Vegas and to add games to the mix is a million dollar idea. My husband and I found this place in yelp by accident and planned on going there for thirty minutes but ended up staying for six hours haha. 
Jupiter explains all games to you and can even recommend according to what you are looking for. He genuinely cares about every person that walks in there and what I thought was so special is no matter who walked in the vibe was always so inviting. Everyone was happily talking to each other even if you didn't know one another. 
I am so happy we found this place and I will continue to support this business for a long time and hope it can only keep growing. Everyone must go here!!! Meant for all ages as well! Love love love Ground Swellings",SYNbshNmAtrPRsmtRBhK9g,1,0,5,x88OrLC0pelsQ8V-Onuw7g

Coffee: 5/5 phenomenal. I got the peppermint mocha. Espresso was Legit! Peppetmint flavor was on point.

Games: 5/5. All the classic/popular games are there monopoly, risk, cards against humanity settlers of catan, etc. Some games were brand new. Like Colonist which was Settlers of Catan on steriods.

They have some live music but I have been here twice and not on a mic night. The concept of a game and beverage place is one I love and seek out. (My favorite one is in Copenhagen).

The nutella latte was good too, very creamy, but not much nutella flavor in it. Service was great. Cashier was really nice and I'm guessing the owner came up to us and asked if we wanted to demo a game. 
-1 because prices are a tad higher than average and teas dont have descriptions. They have so many games including the fancier strategy games. From what I saw on the menu it looks like games are per person and different for adults and kids. I think it would be better if they charged per group.

1729425,2018-02-11,6,os_m94NtcG7JQg095WdggQ,"I recently set up a game night here with a group of friends, and we had a pretty good time. In addition to gaming and cafe beverages, they also have a stage for open mic night. Several people were gaming without drinking, or coming in for a takeout drink without gaming. They're adding a food menu next month, and I'll be scheduling another game night to check that out too.

PROS:
+ Friendly staff, Jupiter and Kristina were welcoming and attentive throughout our visit.
+ Games available for play (400+) or purchase, whichever you prefer.
+ I liked the old school decor and the gaming trivia in the bathroom.
+ It's not super loud or super brightly lit, more comfortable than other spots.

CONS: 
- Drink menu needs some work. Out of 7 drinks ordered, two were pretty good (POG and Liquid Gold) while most others were unbalanced (too sweet, too strong, too bitter, too artificial). They offered to remake drinks though. Wonder if they'll be adding boba in the future.
- Games are not organized in any particular system. They don't have a huge amount to where it's overwhelming or frustrating but some sort of organization whether by age group, time commitment, or cooperative/competitive would be helpful for those unfamiliar with board games.

Looking forward to revisiting. Location isn't super convenient for frequent visits but I will definitely be back and prefer this location to others for group events. 

TIP: Don't purchase the Groupon, they'll honor the deal in store.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,21,13,4,BvYHWQQ5HA6BCyoUBJz8ew

Whenever we come to play board games and ask for recommendations, he always takes time to show us a new game and explain the rules. It's pretty awesome! A couple of games that he showed us became our absolute favorites, and we even bought them to play at our house. This place is kids friendly and family oriented, so bring everyone with you! But keep in mind that they don't have much food and snack selection, so don't come super hungry.

 The idea of paying $5 to play some used board games seems pretty steep to me as well.

There's a small stage open for small group community events.  I asked them if they have open mic poetry lounge kinda stuff.  No but if anyone wants to, they can inquire on utilizing their facility for such interests!

I happened upon them after checking out Krazy Chicken a few doors over.  In their window they serve Pistachio Latte!  Heck yes gotta try it.  Then come to learn this place MAKES their OWN pistachio milk :)  You can't find pistachio milk in the stores.  Nice.  Original.

And the barista crew is laid back friendly.  They have offers - just sign up with a name and cell number to receive texts.  

Their deco concept is re-use materials.  I support the eco-friendly recycled re-use efforts.  And the place looks great!  Some of the furniture is antique; gives this cafe it's uniqueness.

3331920,2017-04-09,1,os_m94NtcG7JQg095WdggQ,"We've been here 5 times and love it, and really want them to succeed.  However, I have to dock a star for inconsistency.  More detail below.
Pros:  awesome tasty drinks (dirty paco is my absolute favorite -- mango tea with tajin and tamarind straw), so many games and good old fashioned fun, great loyalty program, funky vibe, and very passionate staff/owners... you can tell they are really excited about their business
Issues:
-inconsistent execution.  We went once and were turned away because they had no cream.  Owner was out buying more at the store but was more than 30 minutes out.  Employee didn't say anything until after my drink was paid for, so had to go through the refund process and no offer for free drink in the future... so I left frustrated and empty handed.  Today there was no coffee due to supplier error... it's a coffee place with no coffee -- big issue.  Buy some regular coffee at least and offer that for free.  You are building a client base, and can't afford people walking out empty handed or they won't be back.  My biggest issue is the lack of staff knowledge on the drinks.  If that is your livelihood everyone in the store should know the recipe of every drink cold.  Today they were asked if they could make a London Fog tea since there was no coffee.  Employee said no because they are out of espresso, but he could make it without.  He could've looked at their recipe board to see London Fog is on the tea menu NOT the espresso or coffee side.  Last time we asked what something was and they had to go to a book.  Does not give you confidence in quality of drinks if employees don't know them.  And if you are ever out of something, offer a free drink for next time so that customer can come back... otherwise most people will never be back.  Also, service is painfully slow.  If there's one person ahead of you be prepared to wait.
Finally, they need to work on optimizing their hours.  1pm-5pm on a Sunday, arguably the best day to get a board game audience has made us decide to skip game play most weekends.  Today there were 4 tables at one point (and many more who walked away because of no coffee).  Sundays are the type of day to do this activity. 
I know the review sounds critical, but it's more because I want to see improvement.  The concept, drinks and staff are so great I want it to get to 5 stars!",v_dCx5CN1SMx_UUdUaGuJQ,7,2,4,yHjkYtZ9pz0IhpZealFXbw

The place is quaint and bright. Staff is friendly and knowledgeable. They have a good range of games like Card Against Humanity, Taboo, Catan, and a new fun game we played called 'What do you meme.' 

The atmosphere is laid back, and the coffee and tea were delicious. They also sell some sandwiches.

I didn't see any staff to teach you how to play. After couple of hours playing, a huge group of teenagers came in and the place became too loud so we left.

I didn't figure the drinks would be any good and I didn't think anyone else would be there. I was definitely wrong on both counts. First: the drinks. They have an extensive menu of traditional and very creative coffees and teas. The coffee smell of freshly brewed drinks is intoxicating. The drinks are fairly reasonably priced, ranging from about $4-$5.50 each. I decided on a honey green tea latte which was fantastic. It was lightly sweet and had a good flavor. My husband had the Arnold Schwartzwnpalmer, which is an iced tea and lemonade combo with mango flavor. He said it was very good as well. Second: the games. I expected maybe like 5 games to be there and for all of them to be lame. I was wrong! They have a huge selection of games to choose from. Many of which were things I had never heard of before. We enjoyed sitting and playing Trouble, Sorry, and Pandemic for almost 4 hours! The whole time, the place was consistently busy.

Ava who helped us her was just very nice and giving us suggestions that I'd definitely be back to try them all, my wife ordered the almond roca white chelate latte iced coffee and it was BOMB!. I'm gonna try the pistachio latte next visit.

Sure, there's your average movie theater and bowling alley, but movie hopping and bowling with bumpers can definitely get old.  I'm glad to have discovered the Groundswell Board-game Cafe.  It's creative, it's interactive and simply entertaining.  

From nostalgic games like Hungry Hungry Hippo and Battleship, to games unheard of such as Coupe and Get Lucky, with a wall stock-piled with cardboard boxes of fun, you'll never run out of things to do.  The greatest thing about all of this is that it's super cheap!  $5 a head gets you unlimited game play and a member of the staff will answer any question one might have on how to play a particular game.  

Groundswell also has an extensive drink menu and I'm excited to try each and every one of them during my future visits.  On my first visit, I ordered the Milk Tea, the Honey Green Milk Tea and the Sarsaparilla Milk Tea, which was my fave out of the three.  The Sarsaparilla Milk tea tasted like a root beer float melted in all its creamy goodness and poured over ice.  If you're hungry, they also offer munchies such as sandwiches, candy and chocolate.  

Groundswell is the perfect place for family night, date night and group gatherings.  Take a break from all the electronics and get in touch with your ol' skool self with a board-game or two.
