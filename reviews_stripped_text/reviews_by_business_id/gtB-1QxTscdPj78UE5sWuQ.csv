I ordered the mother-shucker burger or whatever it's called. SPECIFICALLY said I wanted it well done and the whole thing was pink and disgusting. I didn't send it back, I just didn't wanna deal with it. But biting into it made me just feel so disgusted. Picture is taken when I brought it back in the leftover box. Also, the waiter was really really annoying. Like he wouldn't stop being nosy and asking us about the food like ""are you going to want boxes later?"" ""Do you want dessert??""

Went in on June 14, 2017 @ 5:30 pm the male bartender on shift should be fired. He ignored me and my GF and attended to only regulars after ordering a beer, and not once asking for refills. After ordering dinner we didn't receive our order untill 45 min later (which was a salad, a wrap, a French fries) and in ""to-go"" bags when we never requested it. By that time a kind females bartender came on and asked him about us and our order seeing why it was ""to-go"" since we were at the bar where we ordered. The male bartender lied and said he never took our order. How a 50 year old bartender lies and acts like  a child is still beyond my belief. 
He did comp my beer because I gambled a little but his attitude and demeanor was atrocious and will be going on ever social media platform to complain about this experience. I have worked in customer service for years and don't expect red carpet service but to lie and be ignored for nothing is beyond my belief. I am more upset taking my time to write this but I could not bare this horrible service be unnoticed, I'd expect this from MC Donald's.

203336,2017-09-07,0,gtB-1QxTscdPj78UE5sWuQ,"Truly, this place is our favorite everyday local eatery! 
A little background for a moment: I DO NOT eat fish. In fact, I hate fish. Closest thing I'll eat is popcorn shrimp lol. While I must say the popcorn shrimp is fantastic at Shucks, if I didn't want that or chicken tenders-which are also some of the best I've had- I found the rest of the menu (non fish items) to be mediocre. My husband on the other hand LOVES fish and crab, especially crab. He fell in love with the prices, quality, and large options available on the menu immediately while I was- sad to say- a harder sell. 

Recently they added new menu items and seem to have revamped the current menu as well with it and now I'm asking him to go to Shucks! I'm addicted to the chicken mac and cheese. It's always so fresh and tastey. And I also am very fond of the fried chicken sandwich and BBQ chicken salad. We can go out to eat quite often sometimes and with the recent new menu we're finding ourselves here pretty regularly. The staff is beginning to know us (can't imagine why! Lol) and we always get great service despite coming in at various times of the day and night. Sitting at the bar or dining room has never hindered service or quality for us. 

The atmosphere is a little dive-y but comfortable, casual, and not intimidating. I can't say much regarding their cocktails as we have only tried two: the Adios Shucker and Crab Walk. We always order one or both of those so you can say we like them a lot. 

PS- DESSERT TRAY. That is all.",gxTIOq4i9WsKfE0DGiNhjw,0,0,5,M1zDjr7GWQvk3jfxJNWIYQ

My wife and I had just left The Ainsworth Lounge at Hard Rock Hotel and we were very hungry and it was around 1am. My wife and I really had a taste for some sushi but any kind of seafood would do. We started yelping trying to find the closest place to our home and low and behold Shucks had great reviews the only problem was that they didn't sell Sushi, we figured lets try it anyways because oysters would suffice.

We arrive at Shucks park there were more than 8 cars in the parking lot and they had a two sets of double doors. We'd walked through the first set of doors and found that we had to ring a doorbell to get into this establishment. That was a bummer because after ringing the doorbell and waiting literally waiting about a minute I told my wife lets go, I can be very impatient and I thought that at the Sedona the kitchen was open 24hrs but to my surprise it wasn't. After arriving at the Sedona finding out that the kitchen is no longer 24hrs the bartender at the Sedona suggested that we go back to Shucks. We gladly took his advice and returned.

They have a great menu selection and it was difficult to decide what to order. There were a number of options that I wanted to try. I settled on 6 oysters to start and was told that they were from Louisiana. I love oysters, but had never had any from Louisiana so my interests were peaked. They arrived and they were meaty and large. However, the taste was underwhelming. The last few almost tasted badly. Not sure if my taste-buds are just adverse for Lousiana oysters or if the quality was not there (the oysters were on special that night), either way, I will not be ordering next time I go back which is disapointing for an oyster bar. I wish they had a better selection for oysters.

I got a salad with crab meat, shrimp, and ahi tuna. The salad was great! The dressing was tasty and the quality of seafood was delicious. My husband ordered the salmon and he was pleased with his meal, as well.

Customer service could use some improvement. Everyone was friendly, but they were slow with greating us and getting us the check. I noticed other customers were frustrated with the slow service, as well.

We ordered a dozen oysters on the half shell to split and when the guy brought them out and asked who wanted them we told them we were splitting them. His response was ""how are we going to do this?"" Seriously?!? Give us another plate dude! I hate telling people how to do their own job. We were left without napkins and had to get up to get our own from other tables more than once. Then we were charged for our Father's drink because he only bet $20 in the machine.

1531194,2015-07-19,1,gtB-1QxTscdPj78UE5sWuQ,"Fridays is the best day to come here- they offer daily specials, but Friday's choices are by far the best value. You can pick orders of crawfish, mussels, crab cocktail, or crab & spinach dip for a flat $5 each. And did I mention martinis are half off ($10 each down to $5)? And they don't halve the portions for the specials, we're talking gigantic, full orders, for minimal money.

CRAB COCKTAIL: It's crab, the portion isn't huge but it's fresh and tasty, and you can't beat $5 (regularly ~$10?). Order one per person, or whoever gets their hands on it first is going to eat the whole thing.
MUSSELS: Large portion, white wine sauce. Not the best sauce, but again, you can't beat the value for the price/portion. Easily a meal for one, and sided with a piece of their addictively-good garlic cheese bread.
CRAWFISH: Available depending on the season, also sided with the bread. Not nearly as good as other places in town, though it isn't the easiest dish to find in the first place. Wouldn't get again, but it's not necessarily bad.
MARTINITS: The ""dirty shucker"" is a classic dirty martini, done well but the Chocolate Salted Pretzel is the stuff of legends. See Lisa H's review for more coverage, but it's something you have to try at least once. Fridays, for $5, is the best night to do so.

A quick search on Yelp brought us to Shucks just in time for the Thursday special - $1 oysters. They also had a late night menu available, with typical bar fare (burgers, wings, calamari, chicken strips) for about $5. We ordered a dozen oysters to share, and he had a half pound of peel and eat shrimp. As far as the oysters, I suppose you get what you pay for. Granted... it's July, we're smack dab in the middle of a desert, and they were a dollar; but these definitely weren't the freshest oysters I've ever had. Boyf mowed through his shrimp pretty quickly and seemed satisfied. 

This place is kind of a cross between a dive bar and a generic Applebee's-esque chain. It was open, clean, and not at all smoky; a big plus in my book. The bartender was prompt and to the point, but didn't go out of his way to make small talk. They had a great double IPA from Utah on tap, and he was nice enough to comp our drinks even though I was only sporadically playing 25 cent hands of video blackjack.

Came here last night w a friend.  Ordered the ""create your own"" with 4!items.. got the calamari which was not good. No flavor and some pieces had undercooked breading on them. The oysters (he said were great! I don't eat them), coconut shrimp and ceviche that we both loved! Also got a bowl of poke to share (which was sooooo good! He got a French connection (courvoisier and grand marnier) and an energy drink. I got a michelada (good flavor) and a ginger ale. 
We Both lost $20 in the machine.. and didn't even get my soda comped.. hmmm. That's unheard of.
5 stars for the food. 
2 stars for the service. Although he was pleasant to us (minus not comping anything) the way he talked to some of the customers wasn't nice. ""You need menus?"" ""Then come get em""",nVNOFUAs82OTe0Mi6di35w,0,0,5,BDiUc_EVK2BCigAsVBXuHw

So we ended the night with two beers, two $5 specials (mussels and crab spinach dip),  Texas oysters (not spicy at all), and 1/2 lb snow crabs legs (not fully in season).  The mussels was Ahh-mazing! I wish the crab spinach dip came with more crab :/ and the Texas oysters was suppose to be topped with lemon,  tequila, and tabasco ...

I mostly go on the graveyard shift and they have some ridiculously low priced specials on Graveyard. Big Burger and Fries for $4, Omelets $4, and quite a few other options. The food is consistently good and high quality. The graveyard bartender ( I think his name is Larry) is super friendly, always has a menu ready for me, knows what I like to drink, and remembers my name and what I had eaten the time before even though it's sometimes a month or so between visits.

Yeah sure it's nothing to go Ape over, but I got everything I expected from this kind of place. Had some oyster shooters. Yum. Louisiana oysters... YUM YUM.

One thing I DO have to say is, they had the BEST snow crab I've ever had. The texture was good. Not mushy or cakey. Not super salty or watered down like the stuff you might find at buffets. And it had an awesome sweetness to it. I enjoyed it more than the lobster. And I love lobster over crab!

Great food. Check.
Good drinks... check...

Shucks was one of the team drinking spots after the games since literally right across the street. I only have found memories of the place. The beers reasonable price, laid back atmosphere, lots of televisions all around the bar area and dining area, and nice little diversity of food not just normal bar food. Since no longer play at the Las Vegas Ice Center not often drive around that area. Talk about bringing the throwback on St Patty Day. 

St Patty Day went out with my roommates for some drinks and food. We tried to do traditional Irish bar but really if looking for laid back atmosphere not the best idea. Shucks was close by our second miss. It wound up being ideal spot get our celebration on. The place was not crowded but few people in the spirit with full on green outfits and partying. Not crazy that we could have conversation without yelling at one another. 

Guess Friday they have this ""FIVE for $5"" from 8am-midnight on appetizers. So we got the calamari and crab & spinach dip start. The calamari was solid nothing that blow you away. It had nice breading, great seasoning, nice portion size (usually see specials make it smaller but our waiter told us normal size portion), and both dipping sauces was great. The crab and spinach was just ok for me. I could have done without. It great deal because we ordered two of the five items. 

My entree I ordered the oyster po boy. It was solid. The bread was on point. Nice crusty on the outside. The oysters they use nice size ones not huge or small. Just right cause last thing want small ones all dried out or big ones moist in the middle. The dressing along with the lettuce, tomato, and am sure missing couple other items. It all came together really nice. If looking for solid sandwich the po boy great choice.",iSC96O2NjQc3JExGUHQG0Q,3,4,3,6ZtU0_EpOPIU5j7Scb29aA

I've been in the hunt for a non-buffet Snow Crab spot. Not even Costco sells Snow Crab (at least 11.5 months out of the year...)

Have eaten at Shucks twice in the past week, the first time I ordered a pound ($17.90/pound) of Snow Crab, it came out Grade A quality: color, size and taste. Impressive! Pressed my luck a few days later and was served a Grade B quality crab :( Still better than the crab available at the neighborhood Smiths/Kroger/Albertsons (Grade C: $6.99/pound) but disappointing that the 2nd visit wasn't consistent with the first. Also, the side of roasted red potatoes on the 2nd visit were slightly under-roasted. Just substitute for their Burger-King-style, twice-fried fries instead, and you'll be OK: these are delicious.

Love that Shucks is open 24 hours and non-smoking. A direct view of the televisions is a slight challenge from some of the seating areas, so get there early before the big game.

2593066,2012-01-08,3,gtB-1QxTscdPj78UE5sWuQ,"For years I have driven past Shuck's and wondered just what was going on inside the place.  From the outside it is certainly a curious structure with an almost abusive amount of signage and a corrugated metal sort of look.  You really don't even know what to expect inside.  Answer is, you shouldn't expect much.  On top of sporting the same decoration as likely slapped on in the early 1980s, this place is a Dallas Cowboys-devoted sports bar.  For some of us, that will hurt your appetite.  

So why did I only ding the rating one star for such an assault on a girl via ambiance?  Shuck's food is is really disturbingly good.  We were guessing it would either be super sketchy or really good.  Thank god it was the latter.  Their menu is a curious collection of laminated pages and their claim of oysters just lists them in quantity, not type.  No one should come in expecting a raw bar experience.

You should expect really good oyster shooters and lots of them.  There are three types, of which we chose the Barracho, essentially a traditional tequila shot complete with salt and lime.  Added to the happy hour order ($5) of peel-and-eat shrimp (NOTE: they give you a spot of very nice horseradish which was excellent and unexpected), this makes for an excellent start.  Also, the martinis are half price during happy hour and without a doubt it was one of the best shaken martinis i have had in recent memory.  I am often disappointed.

Our server was quick and on top of our table with the perfect combination of food/drink delivery, plate swipes and privacy.  It was impressive.

Lastly, our food could not have been better.  The cheeseburger was perfection.  The right amount of bun softness and practically perfect ratio of melted cheese to meat patty with right amount of doneness.  The thin-cut French fries were straight out of the handbook of how to make perfectly cooked potatoes. And my steak was done precisely to my order.  You would think this would be easy, but to get differing meats done correctly and delivered on time seems to be a problem for most places.  Shuck's nailed it.

I'm almost scared to go back.  Have you ever gone to a place and had such a good experience that you think it has to be a complete mistake?

Arrived on a Saturday evening and took a seat at the side bar.

After being ignored or should I say not noticed for about ten minutes the bartender comes over and asked if I would like something to drink. I order a drink and take a look at the menu. I order my dinner, after the bartender takes my order she comes right back to verify she had it correct before it was entered into the computer. On one hand I appreciate that she wanted to input it correctly, but maybe she should have written it down. 

When my dinner is delivered it is delivered by someone from the kitchen who just puts a plate of food in front of me. No regard to if I would like anything else or if everything looks ok. The food was so, so. I had much better in the past. One step above Red Lobster.

After I finish, another fifteen minutes go by and I'm sitting with an empty plate and waiting for my check. My plate is removed and another ten minutes goes by before I'm given my check. Once my check arrives I pay in cash and have to wait another ten minutes before my change is returned. I was beginning to wonder if the bartender was going to assume that my change was a tip and never return it to me the customer. 

What upsets me the most is all the time I'm sitting at the bar area in front of the walk way in and out of the kitchen. People are constantly walking back and forth with no regard or level of service to their customers. From what I could observe, one bartender was on duty to service the entire main bar and side bar area alone. One wait person to service the restaurant and seating area solo again. One mediocre manager on duty who spent more time talking to a female customer than managing the operation. This so called manager did no managing, the tables are dirty, your customers are not being serviced in a timely manner. What do  you do other than flirt with female customers?

Their business must be suffering and trying to save money on payroll by understaffing the entire restaurant.  Your not saving money if your not servicing your customer properly and upsetting them to the point of not returning.

We also ordered a dozen of oysters and they were just okay.  The clam was huge, had at least 20 clams, 5 crab legs, spicy sausages, corn, and potatoes.  They were delicious, especially the clams. The clams were so juicy and meaty. We could hardly finish all the seafood they packed into the bowl. We left most of the potatoes and corn untouched.

We had the crab cake app and they seem like the frozen ones u can buy at the store, but they were fried nicely. Presentation was very nice. The crab cake sauce and the cole slaw were really good. I ordered a 1/2 dozen of raw oysters and had to ask for saltines because they had a strong, fishy taste. Tried them with the crackers but they were still way too fishy to enjoy. Like 'bad seafood' fishy. Tried my best but couldn't finish them. Got a little nervous. I've had my fair share of oysters for almost 30 years in Louisiana and I've never had a strong, 'not good' fishy flavor experience like that. I was let down. It could possibly be that they were frozen when they weren't fresh and defrosted, or the fact that they just might not have been fresh tonight. Not sure. Might have been an off night or just a fluke thing. Hubby had the fried shrimp basket with fries. The shrimp were ok. I guess we're spoiled with good gulf shrimp and authentic fried seafood platters. The french fries and cocktail sauce were really good. 

Going back to the other times we went.. 
The first time, I had the gumbo. It wasn't authentic or tasty and I didn't finish that either. Took a few bites and was done. It might be good to someone who hasn't had La. gumbo before or someone who likes the boxed/bagged gumbo mix flavor, but it's not for me. The second time we went, I had the fried oyster poboy and it was good. The poboy bread was nice from what I can remember. I'm pretty sure it was on french bread. I just remember liking it. Hubby had the shucks burger and he enjoyed it. It was filling and tasty. 

We'll probably be back for the atmosphere, drinks and maybe I'll try the Oysters Rockefeller or the baked New Orleans oysters. Might also try something recommended on Yelp. Won't have the jambalaya because we're used to authentic cajun jambalaya and authentic creole jambalaya.. but to some it might be really good. Overall, not bad.

Met some friends after work, and we had pretty good apps and food.
I could totally see going here and just having fresh seafood apps - Oysters, Crab Cocktail, peel & eat shrimp. MMMMMMMM

We did have a plate of oysters, and they were fresh and yummy. Also ordered the bacon wrapped shrimp. They were good, a TINY bit on the dry side. Fried Calamari was OK. The steamed garlic muscles were great, whish it had come with some toast points for the broth.

On the night we went, it was $3 taco night. I ordered 3 tacos. They were completely fine, definitely not amazing. My friends ordered pasta dishes (Vodka Scallops and Shrimp Scampi) and really liked them!

I discovered that Friday is $5 app night! I think next time I am going to hit it and just stick to the apps and fresh seafood. That seems to be the key here.

BUT- Saturdays is 2-for-$20 Pasta Night, so you may be inspired to go try the pastas that my friends loved!

Either way, the room is fun and rustic, the staff was super friendly, and we had a blast socializing! Just wish the food was a bit better.",y5rqDe6uO06WKZ26-Pla8g,1,0,3,NDEbqjZY48cgs27vNS-aCw

Then my husband had New England clam chowder in a bread bowl while I just had a cup of soup.  It was very tasty but could have had a little more clams.  Then we shared linguini and clams in a white wine sauce which they split for us and each of our portions was tremendous.

The late night bar tender was horrible. Inattentive, slow, unhelpful.

We went in and he was less than inviting. But I was stuck on getting my grub on. 

We spent about 2 hours or more at this location and I was able to get a complete observation of this bartender and the impact he's having on late night business. You should really consider hiring someone with more personality! It will go a long way! 

Also, I may be a little bias because we have our spots and they take care of us, but after 6 drinks and 2 shots you would think two good looking females could get SOMETHING comped. Like maybe a bottle of water? But he charged us for that too. I mean, I get it, we pay for what we order, but we had to order the water twice. So there's that. I don't care how that sounds.

Bottom line you need a friendly bartender because this guy is bad for business. He didn't chat to any of the customers, he left our food in front of us for a half hour after we were finished. He didn't ask us if we wanted refills.

After some strenuous exercise at the climbing gym, a few of us were hungry. But we're poor so we needed something cheap. And then my friend suggested Taco Tuesdays at Shucks! 

The place is pretty large with ample seating. It was pretty empty on a Tuesday night. Eerily quiet. We took our seats at a large table. Our server was quick to take our orders. 

A plate of two tacos usually run around $10. But each taco was $3 in which you can choose from shrimp, grilled mahi-mahi or your regular fried fish. We each got two tacos - the mahi-mahi and the regular fish taco. Food came out pretty quick. The tacos were pretty big, I thought they were going to be a lot smaller like the usual authentic 3-bite tacos. The plate also came with colorful chips and yummy salsa. Both tacos definitely hit the spot. Wasn't greasy or too heavy. 

I had to flag down our server for some more salsa and a refill for water. I was a tad disappointed because the place was so empty and I shouldn't be playing find-our-waiter when we were the only customers there.

Lobster roll- wasn't what I expected. I thought there'd be chunks of lobster, but instead looked like crab meat. The bun was nicely toasted and overall had a nice taste. My boyfriend doesn't like celery, and the roll had lots of it, but whether he was just too hungry or not, he still enjoyed the roll.

I tried their fish tacos that day since it was their special, and did the build your own for 22.95. My friend and I did the fried clams (which I recommend), the raw oysters which is four to this platter, the ceviche, and the cocktail shrimp. This platter is actually alot to eat, and good to share if you don't have a big appetite for seafood. Also, the tacos were good. The fish was tender and not dry. Flavorful, but predictable, and nothing unique as far as taste. The iceberg lettuce just makes it feel like any other fish taco.",a48HhwcmjFLApZhiax41IA,1,0,3,ia8_o-_XY2otpDrsr0860g

Something was different. In the past, the salad has included two pieces of lobster meat that came from the interior of the claw. In other words, it was really obvious the salad had lobster in it.

The menu description states:

""Crab meat, shrimp and lobster served on a bed of mixed greens, tomatoes and a hard boiled egg. served with Louie dressing.""

The crab meat is usually the glob of shredded meat in the middle of the salad. The two shrimp are on the side, along with the garlic bread, tomatoes and the sliced hard boiled egg.

No lobster to be seen unless the glob of finely shredded crab meat now has finely shredded lobster meet combined with it. And if that is the case because they changed the way the salad was made, they should probably change the menu description.

The worst part(and why you are getting three stars) was the defensiveness of the server speaking to me like I was an idiot and did not know what I was talking about.

We will still come back for the breakfasts but will never again be ordering a Seafood Louie salad.",f4GXSyxFoHFNW7Og0J3WXw,0,0,2,d9XrADSYFxTkvTf5Rh33Zw

If you stop playing for just around a minute it forgets your player card and doesn't count your points. You have to either keep playing which you rarely win or you have to keep reinserting your card every few minutes to try and take breaks and make your money last longer.

Heres the story on how my Partner and I spent an Hour and a Half in this establishment feeling unacknowledged.
 
Our Waitress Sherri, was very unwelcoming and Unsociable. We sat ourselves as the sign in the entrance says too do so, She noticed us right away and still took 10 minutes to bring out our menu's. Keep in mind the Restaurant and bar was not busy. We were very hungry and Just wanted to order our food but it took an additional 15 minutes for her to come and take our order, where she made us feel as if we were wrong for ordering food.... She was very unfriendly and described the Food as okay... after she took the food order she stormed off where we didn't see her for a very long time and we wanted to order a few cocktails, Once our food was ready Gus brought it out and we finally were able to Order our Drinks since sherri never even asked for our drink order...  Gus was very Friendly and Prompt, And pretty much for the rest of our evening he took care of us and was extremely Hospitable. 5 stars for Gus!!!  Unfortunately Gus was not our server, it was not his responsibility to take care of our table, But he did, When we finally saw sherri Gus had already bussed our table and removed our plates and glasses, we asked her for the bill thinking she would bring it right out.... Here we are waiting without Drinks for our bill to come, Restaurant was not busy, Gus walks by and I inform him, ""hey whats up with our Waitress she hasnt took care of us at all tonight and now wont even bring out the check"", Very respectably Gus apologized and brought us out our bill right away.

Those  days are long gone now. The menu has changed, the late night specials have changed, the bar staff has changed. They used to offer a great late night menu after midnight (pics posted) but no more, now it's just breakfast. There's two bartenders who work there late night, one is a darling, the other who is newer is so rude.

The crab is now $9 for 1/2 a pound, which is  just kind of silly. Sometimes it's good, sometimes it's only so-so. The tuna is previously frozen, which is what you would expect from a place like this and sometimes it's okay, sometimes it's inedible. The oysters seem to be popular but they're gulf oysters which really isn't my thing.

What a horrible dining experience.  Granted, I wasn't expecting it to be a 5 star experience - but if I could leave a ""NO star"" rating, I would.

Being a Friday night, we anticipated that service may not be great...but it was awful.  Our waitress was clearly overwhelmed by handling the bar area and tables, so perhaps that's why she made us to feel like we were intruding, rather than attempting to muster a smile or be polite.  Not the way to ensure a decent tip.  Though we left the customary 15%, had she put just a small bit of effort in to being friendly, we would have tipped her higher regardless of the poor food.  I never knock the wait staff for poor food.

We started with the crab & spinach appetizer special.  One bite of a mixture of the crab and dip and we immediately knew the crab had passed its servable life expectancy, and the seasoned chip things were stale - not off to a good start.

Needless to say, we weren't taking another bite of that.  We'd also ordered calamari, and neither my husband or older son complained about that (I don't eat it so I have to assume it was OK...they both lived through the night).

Our youngest ordered the sliders from their children's menu, our older son the pulled pork, and my husband and I steamed snow crab.

What my husband and I got were cold steamed crab legs and half melted butter.  And who serves a pound of crab legs without the claw?  It was too late to bother going anywhere else by this time, so we just ate the cold crab.

The pulled pork was fine, but it wasn't until our youngest seemed to focus more on the french fries after only eating 3/4 of one slider did my husband realize the damn things were RAW through the center...not rare...RAW.  How is it possible to NOT cook 2 slider size burgers thoroughly?  Note that our waitress didn't ask how we'd like the burgers cooked - so I could understand had the sliders been done rare (which would have been acceptable) - but RAW????

We thought, ""hey, 50 cents extra isn't too bad. Let's dooo it.""  And off we went to oyster happy land.  

Thinking it was a great deal, each of us ordered a dozen oysters each.  As a part of their Thursday oyster special at $1.50 a pop, it comes down to $18 which is dun dun dun... the SAME price as the menu!!  What kind of deal is that?!  My friend and I put our order on the same tab to include 24 oysters, which would've been a better deal on the menu at $32 than at the $36 special we were charged.  

Don't get me wrong, the food was good!  Oysters were fresh, meaty, and sweet.  They provided ample amounts of lemon, horseradish, tobasco, and cocktail sauce.  We ordered some oyster shooters and man, those cups were a lot bigger than we imagined!  (We thought it would be like the tiny Japanese oyster shooters you get at the sushi restaurants, ha ha.)  At $16.95, the linguini and clams were alright.  The noodles were bland and lacked sauce.  The garlic parm fries ($2.95) was a good deal, pretty big sized basket that can be shared with a group.  It has a nice hint of garlic that wasn't overwhelming.  I found myself reaching for the fries more than my linguini.  My friend got 10 wings ($14.99) in soul sauce and he said it was alright.  We also ordered 2 pitchers of beer and I couldn't help but notice that my cup smelled like an old rag.  I didn't complain because, hey, I'm eating at a bar.  But it was just something I noticed. 

The service was pretty good. For a table of 12, we got our orders pretty quickly and they were able to split our bill without a problem.  The food is pretty good despite it being at the bar.

I chose to have the shrimp, scallop, and crab meat with mine. The seafood is mixed in a hot creamy tomato broth which I had over white rice. It so good especially on a cold day! I also had the shrimp ceviche which was also delicious. If you don't have anybody  to share the appetizer with like in my case I would suggest just getting the entree because it is filling enough. My husband doesn't eat seafood so I was stuffed eating both. 

We shared a apple tart with vanilla ice cream for dessert which was perfect! I think Shucks is a great place to go for seafood if you want to eat in a casual atmosphere. Plus it is opened 24 hours so whenever the craving strikes you can go!",48vRThjhuhiSQINQ2KV8Sw,0,1,5,zX1uEB2MSBfLpzUVEDYCNg

If you get a half dozen or more it's basically the same as the regular pricing. Nice thing is they let you order less than a 1/2 dozen of each so you can mix & match without spending full order prices.
Ordered 2 fried oysters: crispy light breading, large, plump & juicy, best thing I had there.
2 raw oysters: small and not the freshest
2 oysters Rockefeller: small but good
2 grilled oysters: small, okay but a little dry
1/2 lobster roll ($5.95 special that day): more like lobster/seafood salad roll, looks like a mix of seafood or fake crab w maybe a little lobster thrown in, no chunks of lobster (this a bar that serves food, why would I think they would have a good lobster roll, especially at that price?)
The $6 check-in Guinness offer is of no value, that is the regular price of Guinness there. Deducted a star because the management knows this is of no value and won't offer anything else in exchange.

The menu is definitely over priced, the portions were a decent size. I'm shocked for a seafood place that they don't have scallops.  I tried their lobster bisque and it was a bit thin, a little salty and it was just ok.  I would actually say that the same soup at red lobster was twice as good.  (and just fyi, there are plenty of things at red lobster that aren't that great either, but as far as soup goes, they win) 

The breading on everything wasn't too bad but a lot of the fried items were bland and definitely needed more seasoning in their breading/batter.  Their calamari was ok but I would've liked it to be crispier (just a matter of opinion is all)

All in all,     I probably won't be back, nothing here made me say yummm or oooh or wow etc.   and Hushpuppy is better and far cheaper

and I will give partial credit to our server, she was very nice from start to finish and made sure we were taken care of.  There was a small accident when our entrees came out though.  While setting them on the table, they were setting them down/moving so fast, that the ramekin of tarter sauce fell off upside down onto my dad.  Luckily my dad moved very quickly and caught it upside down in his hand.  No real harm done and she did apologize and got extra napkins and such, but a manager should always stop by just to apologize as well and or offer a dessert or take a drink or something off the check (nothing big but just a small peach offering so to speak, is always appreciated)  Again no real harm done though and all in all the dinner was good just not great and not for the price.",9GyTNxzAN8UxpPPSTfei-A,0,0,2,ON3LE-aDyFAzb80HY0CqaQ

(I don't play video poker, but I appreciate the plight of those that are trying to keep their health while doing a little gaming.)

Shucks is known for seafood, but I am not a huge seafood eater, so I will just say that my husband, who does, likes the snow crab legs, but did not like the oysters. The oysters are farm-raised. 

I have had two different entrees: mahi fish tacos and their Black and Bleu salad. I would definitely order the fish tacos again. The only minor complaint is that the tortillas are flour, and I love corn. The salad was not incredible. It is a good value because it comes with a nice portion of flat iron steak. However, the steak was dry and under seasoned, and the lettuce a bit wilted. If executed better, I am sure it would be delicious, but on the night I visited, it fell a bit short. 

The other great thing about Shucks is that they have some type of special every day of the week. Most notably, $2-3 drafts every Monday and Wednesday. Kids eat free on Sunday. There's more, but you'll just have to roll up to find out. It will be a fun surprise for you.",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,22,15,4,5mmhgJnmhSu0g2fj7-8VwQ
5217662,2017-03-10,0,gtB-1QxTscdPj78UE5sWuQ,"I recently craved oysters, so I hit up the neighborhood oyster bar just down the road.

The joint managed to achieve a casual ambiance that comes off as authentically relaxing and working-class, rather than hokey or contrived - an unusual feat both for an oyster bar and for Las Vegas.

We started with four appetizers: crawfish, crab & spinach dip, calamari, and mussels.
We ordered the crawfish out of season due purely to my friend's curiosity, and their presentation was in fact rather curious. I still don't understand why they served them in the hot water in which they were boiled. This only resulted in burning our fingers when we went to peel off the shells. The crawfish had an acceptable flavor and consistency though for being of Asian origin.

The crab & spinach dip is something I would order again. With plenty of Parmesan cheese, it was definitely a savory dish, and I could taste very little of the sweet crab flavor.
The calamari was passable, but barely so as the tempura batter lacked any seasoning, and they were fried at too low a temperature, which resulted in oily breading.

There was something wrong with the mussels, though I still can't put my finger on exactly what it was. They just smelled putrid, not unlike a rotting eggplant or tomato. They tasted perfectly fine though, and neither of us got sick, though it took a while for me to get that smell out of my nose.

Next, we moved on to what we came here for with an order of oysters Rockefeller (here known as ""oysters New Orleans style"" - there's another menu item here called ""Oysters Rockefeller"" made with spinach and pepper jack cheese). They were no match for Antoine's, but then again, they were pretty damned good. I'll be getting those again. Butter, lemon and Parmesan cheese were some of the main ingredients. They were perfectly seasoned and grilled.

My friend got the steak and crab, which was a flat iron cut with snow crab legs, mashed potatoes and vegetables. I got the lobster role. The steak was cooked perfectly medium as requested. It was a quality cut and not over-seasoned. The snow crab legs tasted fresh and had a rich sweet flavor. I'd definitely recommend getting crab legs here. The potatoes were well seasoned, good consistency, and had the skin in, as I prefer. The ratio of lobster meat to mayonnaise in my lobster roll definitely favored the lobster meat, but not so much that the sandwich ended up dry. I recommend it as well.

One of the best features of Shucks is its cost-value ratio. On Fridays at least, that appetizer special was unbeatable, even if we did strike out on a couple of them, and even the menu prices were a great value. For its ambiance, food quality and value, Shucks is definitely worth the trip.",O0JPkrL9cBxx2u1Ka9iAXA,2,0,4,gl_6e3ymYnFPM3Hyc3VQbA

I read about this place on Buzzfeed, ""10 best places to get crab"". We ordered;
Snow crab, this was clearly frozen a long time. Very dried out with very little flavor
Dungeness crab, just meh.... Nothing special.
Peel & eat shrimp (hot). Way over cooked. 
Chicken tenders, fries and chowder. Tenders were over cooked as were fries. Chowder tasted like it came from a can and was so salty it couldn't be eaten.

5465927,2016-05-03,1,gtB-1QxTscdPj78UE5sWuQ,"For a little offsite bar, I actually find their oyster and seafood selection to be excellent.  

Some odd years ago, I fell in love with the concept of oysters.  While Vegas is absolutely nowhere near the beach, their selection is pretty tasty and reasonably priced.  They also serve a great selection of seasoned seafood.  Their appetizer selection is solid, and their drinks are most definitely not watered down (their Bloody Marys are stout), but if you want to pretend that you're at some little seaside hole in the wall and just munch on shrimp and oysters, then this is most definitely your place.

I'm more surprised that I haven't reviewed this place already.  I go over there fairly regularly when I feel the need for some reasonable, off-Strip seafood that isn't sushi.  One of the nicer aspects is the fact that they really do have a wide variety of seasonings to cover your meal in, and I'm a sucker for Old Bay seasoning.  Their sandwich fare is also excellent.

Like I said, it's a little bar/restaurant place.  I like the fact that it isn't smoky, the menu is pretty diverse, and the staff are nice  My only real downside is that it is a little far from my side of town but really, if that's the worst thing, then I can manage.

The selection is limited, but the options are good.  I really liked the sausage patty croissant sandwich that comes with hash browns.
The portions are not huge, but I like that.  It's a good breakfast for the price, and you don't walk out feeling so full that you can't move.

Cons:  We've been here half a dozen times, and have never run into any kind of a drink special.  For just a local, no frills, tavern kind of bar the drink prices are a little high.    

I might come back for some cheap country fried steak, but I don't think I'll be drinking here anymore.  There are just too many better options in this neighborhood.",vKbRbgAEYDCdl-xjPIWLfQ,2,0,2,Ipy79PKrWQ-ED6Yg5sI6DA

So instead of saving money you are losing money from those of us who don't drink soda. Water is free . Portion sizes have gone down a lot . If I have to pay for 3 orders of chicken just to get a normal size amount on my nachos (and I'm not a huge eater ) then I think it's time to find a new place . 15 years of consistently being good to changing things monthly .

5752723,2014-10-20,0,gtB-1QxTscdPj78UE5sWuQ,"Another night of Monday Night Football with friends and this night we decided to try Shuck's, a place I had been to 6-7 years ago on a late night and recall having enjoyed their food.  We settled in at a table that was not entirely satisfying because the view of the TV screens were a bit awkward.  Too small, too far, blind spots... eh, not great for MNF.  Nevertheless, we are hungry, games have started, and staff were nice so we decide to stick around.  Despite being a sub-par venue for game-watching this particular night, it was still an enjoyable evening.

I find Shuck's to be quite unique in its offerings.  It's not an uppity oyster bar, but it is an oyster bar.  The setting is casual, almost Joe's Crab Shack-ish, but more laid back and better menu.  It has a long list of seafood menu, including buckets of variety of steamed items such as crabs, clams, crawfish, etc.  Fried seafood entrees, variety of seafood soups, wide selection of seafood-based apps,  clam bakes, and pastas, not to mention the requisite variety of oyster dishes and even non-seafood sandwiches, make for an extensive menu.  Happy hour was over so there wasn't any great deals in place, but I find their prices to be quite a bargain to begin with so I think it's worthwhile anytime.  

I did not taste others' dishes, but myself had the crab & spinach dip and beer battered coconut shrimp basket.  The dip was especially good, with meaty chunks of crabs amply mixed in.  The shrimp was also very good, not too bready and full of sweet, coconut flavor.  Fries that came with it was pretty good, nothing spectacular.  I did try a bit of my brother's fish 'n chips, and that was quite good as well, with crispy and light breading.  Solid 4 stars for the food, especially considering the reasonable prices.

I'd like to come here more often and try to knock off a considerable amount of items on the menu that has some very interesting dishes.  Friendly service, casual atmosphere, and good prices make it a definite spot for having a few with your buddies, in spite of the TV ergonomics that could use some work.

Table-for-1 Factor:  There is a large, long bar where you can, and many did, sit by yourself and watch the game.  In fact, it might be preferable since the good TV screens are at the bar.",52Oq0fCJWaHpQtuKqTkN4g,3,2,4,2Qoj-QVU074ORkU9E8TXEA

Second got the clam chowder and the fish tacos Eeeek me thinks not is right!!! the clam chowder was ok but the fish taco WTF!! first off how do you mess up fish tacos? well other than the cooked cabbage and frozen fish this is the worst fish taco I have ever had. Break down the fish was def frozen and tasted like plastic, the shrimp taco was also frozen and tasted like plastic and to top it off why would you put the deep fried fish on top of the cabbage? im guessing they let my tacos sit for a while because when i got my tacos bam cooked cabbage nice and soggy just the way no one likes em. The only reason this place even got one star was the service the waiter offered to replace our tacos and when we said we didnt want anything he even took it off the bill, good job thank you",xcW5lXyjxODJQATvB8xN5A,0,0,1,Ka5rElEa_tOUfSB1OwuvIA
