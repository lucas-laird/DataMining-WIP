It's a gourmet little breakfast and lunch spot, you order at the counter and there are some cute tables in and outside.  They have breakfast burritos, pancakes, sandwiches, wraps, burgers (beef, chicken), soups, pastas, and huge salads (spinach, curry chicken, cobb).  There is a nice selection of veg options and everything is fresh and high quality.  Pastries could be much improved on and I wish they served breakfast past 11 on weekends.

We ordered an Acai Bowl, Fruit Bowl, Protein Scramble, coffee, and orange juice.  We sat and waited.  Then the Scramble was brought out.  The server asked if we needed anything else and we said, ""We are still waiting for the fruit and Acai.""

A few minutes later, fruit was brought out.  Then we asked for the Acai.  She asked who took our order, we told her, and she left.  A few more minutes later she returns to tell us the Acai Bowl was not ordered and that I would need to come in to pay for it.

Upon ordering the Acai, I had to ask for a discount or some gesture for the inconvenience. She said, ""We don't offer discounts.""  I know differently, but I just went along with it.  

Then it hit me:  I just paid $30 (and have been paying that much) for a simple breakfast at a place I've been coming to for quite some time.  And, they don't value my patronage.  So, not only will I find another breakfast place, I will no longer order their catering for my office lunches, and I will be sure to let my friends (and Yelp) know that this is not a place worthy of their patronage.

Note to the reader: while I read reviews on yelp all the time, this is the first time I have ever been compelled to write a negative review. That aught to say something...",zn9J6q6xwzMVTdunZLGcNg,0,0,2,hZi4f2CT3pZEsEYUz9XqWg

Either they are lazy (perhaps) or their eggs are pre-made (likely)...simply cannot believe you are only allowed to get eggs only those ways, and I don't appreciate being lied to my face as to the reason why either.

Also ordered an iced coffee..do they brew coffee than chill it so you can have it over ice..of course not.  You just get a soda cup, fill it with ice from the soda dispenser and pour hot coffee over it, diluting the coffee completely in the process.

I've always had a pleasant experience here until recently when I brought my mom, and ended up leaving with my tail between my legs because I was so embarrassed I'd hyped it up for her and then let her down! 

My mom decided to order for us - she wanted the Ultimate Grilled Cheese with a mixed green salad, and I wanted 1/2 440 Sandwich with soup. While ordering mine, the cashier asked what side she wanted, so she said sweet potato fries. The cashier handed my mom a number and we sat at our table, chatting and waiting. And waiting. And waiting. 

Friends, couples, and colleagues came, ate, and went while we sat at our table, with my mom commenting that this was probably not a good place for a work lunch. While we sat there, one of the runners came out and told us the 440 does not come on ciabatta bread like I'd wanted, so I opted for wheat - couldn't they have told us this while we were ordering and not 10-15 minutes later? The food finally came out and instead of sweet potato fries, we had limp French fries on my plate with no soup. We called a runner to explain and he promptly brought out an extra serving of sweet potato fries without taking my plate back - kudos for not having to make us wait even longer. When we inquired about the soup, however, another employee kept asking us for our number that we no longer remembered. She was finally able to pull up our check and said that I had ordered the 1/2 sandwich with a side - I didn't even know that was an option on the menu, especially since my mom had only asked for the sweet potato fries because she'd been prompted. It was like Seinfeld's ""No soup for you!"" except with less yelling :( 

I'd be willing to go back again because I think the food in my other experiences had been fresh and simple without feeling overtly expensive, but Mama K probably won't be coming along because she wasn't too impressed.",v6oGFvXjuJ5DMT3pUqMXnw,1,1,3,_Y1me0PXQZIkgsIOOoJGzg

Many people who came in after us all got their orders before us. Then to add insult to injury they put the mayo on the sandwich which we had asked to be left off so we had to wait for it to be redone. The french fries were also cold when they arrived. The manager came out and apologized and comped the one sandwich but it was still an unpleasant experience. Food was just so so. Then while we are eating our sandwich outside these two really nasty looking pigeons are going to town on the food left on the tables. It was so disgusting they were on the plates and bowls I went inside to suggest they clear out the tables. After a few minutes someone came out to finally clear the tables and shooed away the pigeons which then flew right over another diners table while they were eating. Thank goodness it wasn't ours! The fellow dining patron and I both mentioned we hope they have good dishwashers!! Anyway I must leave this place as the pigeons are going after another table and I can't take it anymore.

I never realized it was counter service, but I don't mind a bit if it's it fresh and tasty. I was hoping for quick too because I was famished. I had the turkey club, which had smoked turkey, Swiss cheese, avocado, mixed greens, tomatoes and chipotle mayo served on sourdough bread. I wasn't sure which bread to choose so I asked for a recommendation, sourdough it was. 

The bread was really weak. The other sandwich components were fresh and tasty. I wish the mayo had more kick. I really didn't taste any chipotle. Perhaps the avocado overpowered it. It was a fine sandwich, but worthy of a $12 lunch? No. The sweet potato fries on the side were crisp and delicious. The highlight really.

I have faith that Rachel's Kitchen is dishing out better options than the Smoked Turkey Sandwich so I wouldn't hesitate to return. Next time, I'll likely try a salad. Those looked wonderful.",ZsUSGU1-L1ImomLZjXxxTg,5,1,3,ycN-9IE3svEhdzocHgm2vw

  This is how it happened. I was dragged into this little place by a calorie counter, I watch what I eat, blah blah conscious friend that spends half of his life at the gym and reads every label or ingredient on anything he eats. Well I'm the opposite, the only times I go to the gym  is the day after my yearly doctors check up, the day my yearly membership is due and when I have plumbing problems at home and I need to take a shower. As for labels, I don't have time for that , I use common sense.  Good for you = tasteless, bad for you = delicious. So when my friend told me how this place serves very healthy options I was wishing I would've went to lunch with my fluffy friend instead.
  I ordered the chicken fettuccine Alfredo and I was happy with it, not bad at all. It was rich and creamy and servings are large enough for two meals. My friend ordered a turkey sandwich and French fries. Yes, French fries, I don't get it either, but my friend explained to me that even with the fries, he was eating healthier than at any other comparable restaurant and that my pasta had too many calories, so I told him that I wanted to go to lunch not to a nutritionist. He shut up and I enjoyed my pasta.
  So if you want to go to a place that serves food that  makes you feel like you're eating healthy, Rachel's kitchen is the place to go!  The place is small and always busy  but I notice that you can fit more people here than at any regular McDonald's. Hmmm, maybe they are right. Maybe this food is really  good for you, everyone around here seems to be in shape...cool, another reason for me to skip the gym...I'll just go to Rachel's kitchen.",EG6qatWgJ2WTJnzBCCH_Dg,4,3,4,wzL4pnRx6h8QBkHLy95AgQ

How's this for a firsthand experience?

I'm over in the South Summerlin area for work and look up what fast-er food options are nearby. Rachel's Kitchen shows up with two $$ on it, meaning it's not super cheap but it shouldn't be ridiculously priced either, so I expected to find something for $6, no drink. That's a reasonable expectation. 
When I get there, the parking is bad because all the spaces are crammed together, making it hard to park the company van (standard sized van mind you, not a giant box truck). 
I go inside and stare at a wall of words and prices that start at $9 each. 
A woman behind the counter asks if I'm ready to order and I say I have no idea because this is my first time and I don't know how it works. 
She then points to another menu, again everything costing $9 or more. 
I fumble around with the menu for a bit then ask ""Do you have anything that's not as expensive?"" whereupon she laughs at me and says ""we have a kids menu...""
Okay, maybe for other people, that are ordering for children, that would be a good choice. But I'm not a child and don't want to spend $7 on a kids meal that is smaller than the adult portions.

Maybe the food is good, if you want to spring $9 + on a salad. As a poor working man I don't have that kind of money, and I don't appreciate being laughed at for asking for something that is cheaper, and I understand that a kids meal is cheaper, but it is not a substitute for a large mans portion.

Upset with the off-base remark, I left Rachel's Kitchen, walked down the parking lot to Subway and had a sandwich maker who was very polite and respectful. (I got a great subway sandwich at a good price and was treated with respect, where at Rachel's Kitchen I got none of these three.)

I know, I know...it's just watermelon juice and I could make it in my kitchen with some watermelon and a blender. But on lazy Saturday mornings I would much rather pay $4 for the friendly staff at Rachel's to hand me a large plastic cup filled with fresh, delicious watermelon juice than go to the store, buy a watermelon, come home, and make it myself. Don't judge.

Location dining room is clean and well-decorated with bright and cheerful colors, and the fresh fruit salads and parfaits on display in the refrigerated case are eye-catching and make a good healthy impulse purchase.

BF works nights and is a heavy eater in the AM, while I usually don't have an appetite at all until the afternoon. He opted for the grilled chicken sandwich from the Lighter Side section of the menu ($13) while I kept it simple with a peachberry smoothie- wish the calorie count for the smoothies was listed, too, as I found it odd they weren't listed in the Lighter Side section, but the fresh-squeezed juices were, with counts.

My smoothie came out first and was flavorful and mostly creamy, just a touch icy. Portion was good, and I liked that it came with the domed bubble lid, so that the portion was not cut short by snapping on the flat lids as they are often served elsewhere. Nothing more annoying than seeing a giant, fresh smoothie being poured from the blender, only to have a heap of it get tossed out because it doesn't fit in my cup!

BF's sandwich was next- plated with a side salad with balsamic dressing. Salad veggies were fresh and dressing tasted homemade. The sandwich though, we had mixed feelings about: it was topped with grilled veggies (eggplant and roasted peppers?), and the veggies themselves were delicious. The chicken was in two small, flat pieces and was fairly dry. While the flavor was fairly good, this simply was not a $13 value for a sandwich. What we received did not justify the price. Having seen the product, this is not something I would pay over about $8 for.

I love to support local businesses, and especially ones that offer healthy options, but it really frustrates me to see places jumping on green/healthy trend and jacking up prices an unreasonable degree when their product doesn't justify it.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,8,5,2,usnijKeJODsnEl_L39SJFQ

Cons:
* Slightly too expensive.

I live close to Rachel's Kitchen and have heard and read good things on yelp. I stopped by for a Sunday afternoon lunch. My girlfriend and I were one of two groups there. The other group was a fit looking father and his son. Since we chose Rachel's Kitchen for a somewhat healthy option, our dining neighbors were a good first sign.

We ordered a Chinese Chicken Salad and a BBQ Chicken Wrap with side salad to split. The lunch cost 24 dollars which I found to be slightly too expensive. The food came quickly and was well presented. The salad came in a large bowl topped with a lot of wantons and heavily dressed; a bit too much for my tastes. The fresh mandarin and cucumbers were tasty and almost justified the 11 dollar price tag. The wrap too was very saucy but the chicken and lightly crisped onion rings tasted great within the fresh spinach wrap. 

The restaurant was small but comfortable and the warm earth toned greens and browns were engaging and felt relaxed.

In summary, the food didn't disappoint and I would return again and try something else. If the food was slightly less expensive, 10-20%, Rachel's Kitchen would earn a 4 star rating from me.",TNYWqSWozQ3UKEiN6S1f6w,2,0,4,UQuVbdJE-9zC7uTcLYqvqA

The turkey club ($11) and a nice amount of filling and was standard fare. But really, how can you screw up a sammy that has bacon in it? (if you do, it's a travesty!) Loved the thin slices of bread but would have prefered real turkey breast (not deli slices).  The salad was pretty ordinary with a generic supermarket balsamic vinaigrette on top.

The curry chicken ($10) sandwich was okay, not enough curry flavour. The sides of fries were a little on the soggy side and not satisfying.

We returned for breakfast. Ordered a plate of chocolate chip/banana pancakes and french toast. Both plates came with a side of fruit.

First of both portion sizes are very Jenny (aka Jenny Craig) for the price ($8 ish). If you're looking for a good tuck-in with sausage and eggs with a mile-high stack, this is not the place to get it. 

The french toast was okay - the center was rather dry because the batter wasn't given sufficient time to permeate the bread. So it didn't have that luxurious eggy, fluffy center.

Pancakes were overly moist and not crisp from the fruit and chocolate embedded in there. Flavours were nice but it was hard to overlook the texture.

Think there only have two more locations that have not had the pleasure of recovery meal or just good healthy living!!!! I must admit on this visit terms of the food not my best experience. I ordered the breakfast wrap something that first time ordering off the menu. I just found the whole wrap very bland. It was huge in size with more then my share of egg (you have choice or regular or egg whites) whites. Outside of the protein fell short on flavor and maybe should have stuck with the things normally order. You never know plus never had bad experience at Rachel. I was hungry so it did the trick but one dish not recommend. So much other good stuff on the menu be fine.

One thing that does stand out about this location then the other Rachel's. The little patio area out front with cover, ceiling fans, decent space, and on right weather day nice spot chill with friends. Usually one that just sitting out front of restaurant looking at parking lot nothing worth mentioning. Here not only do you have the mountains close by BUT best part is in the same shopping center have barre yoga/fitness gym. Course mostly girls but guys do yoga also. Point  being great spot people watch and hell if need motivation comes fitness seeing all health fanatics coming and going over breakfast/lunch/dinner. Inside feel like this location one of the smaller ones. The interior decor is consistent with the other Rachel's. The service consistent with the others never had bad experience.  At this location notice you get free muffin with yelp check in. Another plus one on this location besides for me really close by my house.

Me-The favorite-which wasn't...on both...cook must have forgot the eggs were in the stove...the over easy turned medium was fried. The favorite was drier than the air outside.
The plates were far too small for the serving.
My dad touched one bite of the eggs and I bussed my own table returning the plate to show them the eggs weren't touched but the rest eaten...response...can we make you two more eggs-me...ahhh no thanks...same cook and we're pretty much done.
To their defense..they also offered a dessert-which we took them up on.

The banana chocolate chip pancakes were so dense and there was really nothing special about the syrup that came with it. For the less than average taste and presentation, the price doesn't match.

Thankfully the muffin was complimentary from checking in because that wasn't worth paying for either. C'mon at least do something right. They said it was baked fresh and coming straight from the oven. As I received the muffin it was room temperature.

So I walk in it looks nice, the tables need to be wiped down but it's lunch time and they look busy.  I walk up look at the menu and see that everything is $9 to $11.  Ok there must be something special about the sandwiches, wraps or salads that they charge that much for.  I order the Turkey Club, I am thinking ""ok for $11 maybe it is a Turkey Cutlet with some different type of mayo like an aioli  or cranberry or something.""  Then my wife orders the Gorganzola burger and they ask how she wants it cooked she says medium.  So I say to myself ""wow, cool they are cooking to order instead of just shoe leather.""   Then I order the Kids Pasta with Meat Sauce for my  3 y/o.  They asked me what side I wanted on my sandwich so I look up and they offer French Fries, Sweet Potato Fries, salad or Onion Rings.  I think ""wow I haven't had onion rings in a while I am excited I will get the onion rings.""  My wife gets the French Fries.  We order three drinks and we are on our way.  Well we sit down inside and I realize they gave us only two cups.  So I go and ask for the third one that we paid for.  The lady who took our order hands it to me.  Then this Mexican guy says you already have three cups on your table.  I said no we don't we only have two and I ask him if he is calling me a liar?  He says no that I have made a mistake and that I have three on the table.  So now I am furious and tell him to come over to the table.  I count the cup for him and he says what about the water cup.  I said it is what they gave us for the lemons we asked for, for the tea.  I said we paid for 3 cups and I want three cups not two with a water cup.  And then he says sorry and goes back to the kitchen.  I am thinking wow are you kidding me that this guy is ready to throw down over a cup.  Then when it was his mistake he only appologises as he is walking back to the kitchen.  Then our meals come out. I look over my sandwich and there is nothing special about it at all.  It is lunch meat with lettuce, tomato and bacon on white bread.  They didn't even cut it they way a Club is supposed to be cut.  Then I notice my onion rings that I was excited about and there were only three onion rings. THREE!!!!!!!!.  Two of them weren't even that big.  So I ask the lady why I only got three onion rings and she says well that is our lunch portion and I reply well it certainly wasn't the lunch price.  Then she asks me if I want more and tell her no I don't want anything from this place.  Then of course my wife's burger is shoe leather and the best thing I can say about my kids pasta is that it had not taste to it.  They didn't cook the pasta in salted water and the meat sauce tasted so bland they probably got it out of a jar.  My whole experience here was terrible and I will never go back.

I work nearby and tons of employees come here for the fresh foods. I've tried a few different things on the menu. I particularly like their salads. The reason for the four stars is because they did let me down once with the pear arugula salad. I'm a huge fan of this salad at other restaurants but the pears in the Rachel's kitchen salad were not ripe so they were hard and flavorless and overall the salad was a bit of a let down. I've gotten the Cobb and Asian salad and they were both AMAZING! 

I love their smoothies. I usually get the Acai smoothie which never disappoints but today I changed it up and got the Peachberry smoothie. YUM! Now I'm determined to try all of them. 

I tried one of their sandwiches for the first time as well and man, this is good too! I got the Rachel's chicken sandwich on ciabatta with a small salad as the side. You'd be surprised how easy it is to screw chicken salad up but Rachel's kitchen nails it! You can taste how fresh everything. REAL chicken! It makes a difference! Mmm!

They share a small parking lot with a few other businesses. So if you don't park right in front, there's a walk in store for you. Second, this location is tiny. I beat the lunch rush, so I was able to snag a table. I can only imagine the crowds during peak times. Other than that inconvenience, the food is amazing. I always get the vegetarian sandwich. It contains goat cheese, grilled zucchini, red bell pepper, onions and tomatoes. It's so filling that you would never think you were eating just vegetables. The chipotle mayo also adds a good richness to the sandwich. You also have a choice of sides which includes fries, sweet potato fries or onion rings. Their menu also consists of salads and wraps. There is something for everyone, even the picky eater. I do suggest trying one of their juices. The watermelon one is delicious and refreshing.

My group ended up ordering the 440 sandwich, mac and cheese, and 2 different types of burgers.  The sandwiches and burgers come with a choice of side between fries, sweet potato fries, and onion rings.  For the sides we added onion rings and french fries.  

The first disappointing thing was that we had to wait forever for just a couple of sandwiches, but that's understandable cause places get busy and it takes time to get your food.. Once we got our food I was expecting a lot more than what we actually got.. Each dish was about $10 or more and the food looked like something I could make at home in 5 minutes.. the 440 sandwich was suppose to have grilled chicken, goat cheese, avocado, peppers, and lettuce... I probably got one little slice of pepper and even less goat cheese.. the chicken was dry.. the onion rings.. they gave me like 4 little rings.. 
the other burgers and fries were also lacking in flavor and quantity.. the mac and cheese was the best thing we ordered but even that was lacking in flavor and was also dry.. all in all the food is dry and you don't get what you pay for..

When you enter the staff great you with a smile, give you time to make your decision on what to eat, and help you out if you look stuck.  

I have to say that I really like their Ultimate Grilled Cheese -- three types of gooey cheese melted with freshly sliced tomato, and some home fries on the side.  Their home fries are dry, not greasy, and their grilled cheese is crispy but soft on the inside.  Overall, a great little meal that's sure to please.

The BBQ Chicken Wrap $9.95 is sweet and tangy all wrapped in Kermit green spinach wrap. The fries are real (like In-N-Out), not like the ones from McD's that have been under your car seat for years without molding.

The place is tiny but charming...as charming as can be in a Summerlin strip mall.  There are maybe 8 tables inside and double that outside so if you go at peak lunch hours, you may have a weight.  The menu is simple but thoughtful with a range of creative sandwiches, burgers, salads, pastas and wraps.  Perfect food for a sun drenched place like Las Vegas.  Im a sucker for a good burger so I opted for the Gorgonzola Burger and fries.  You can also get a small side salad or onion rings in lieu of the fries.  I found the burger to very good, not the best ever, but good enough to keep coming back.  The fries were average but stealing a glance at my neighbors table I saw the onion rings may be the way to go next time.  Speaking of the neighboring table, they also had salads which looked to be big and fresh.  I guess Ill just have to make a couple more trips back to see if my stomach agrees with my eyes.  

I like that you order at the counter and they bring it out to you...perfect for lunch because sometimes you dont want or need full service.  Soft Drinks and teas are also help yourself and help myself I did because when you have to sit outside on a 107 degree day, refills are a huge saving grace.  I also noticed they had a simple but interesting breakfast menu that looks worth exploring.  

Rachel's Kitchen is a nice alternative to a chain or having to go inside a casino for one of  their restaurants and all the production that comes with it.  Summerlin could use more little ""bistro"" style restaurants  like Rachel's...it really helps create a cosmopolitan type vibe that cities like Chicago or Seattle have.

The acai bowl was room-temperature and lacking flavor. The steel cut oats were grainy and tasteless. The tea tasted wholly of paper cup. The old fashioned oatmeal was gummy.

Last month, my boyfriend and I came here with my mom, who recommended the place because of the convenient location and great menu selections. I was pretty excited to try this place out . The dining area was small but clean with a counter in the back to order at. The menu hoisted above the counter showcased alot of tasty sounding menu items and it was almost hard to decide on one thing. Nearly all the tables were taken and it was obvious that Rachel's Kitchen was a popular lunch spot. I ordered the Ultimate Grilled Cheese with a side salad, my mom ordered the Mac N Cheese and my boyfriend had a fish wrap. 

Everything sounds good so far, right? The entire time we were there, we kept getting the condescending elevator eyes with the snobby sneer from many of the other diners.. you know that stuck up look that snobby people give like they smelled something bad? There was one guy in the back corner table, with the spray on tan and tank top on showing what little of his youth he was trying to hold on to, that had a staring problem. Every time I looked up in his direction, he was looking at us. The women who took the table near us, with their obvious augmentation job and their haggard aging Barbie doll appearance, kept looking toward my mom and whispering. We weren't loud, or dressed inappropriate, but I think the sheer fact that my mom is plus size, that we weren't sporting the high end fashion and that maybe my boyfriend and I are an interracial couple had something to do with all the various stares. The pretentiousness and overall douche-baggery vibe that saturated the dining area made my dining experience uncomfortable. 

It's a shame that the clientele that day was bad because the food was really good and reasonably priced. Despite the delicious lunch that my party and I had, the unwelcome feeling by the other diners ruined any chances of me returning again.",BWnz69daxDZIkc5g6uEGpA,2,1,1,5qs7WphdwflMq96WeY9bhw

The Cob salad is now the best cob salad in town.  I thought Peppermill was the best, but it just got beat out!  The iced tea is also the best iced tea in Las Vegas, super refreshing, maxed out flavor.

I have one suggestion about the Turkey burgers: make them bigger.  While they taste great, full of flavor, they are just too small.  I'd need three of them to fill me up.  And offer some cheese please.

I ordered the Curry chicken wrap and my friend got their multigrain pancakes with both bananas and chocolate chips.  The wrap is a chicken curry salad with romaine lettuce, cucumbers, and mayo in a whole wheat tortilla.  You have a choice of mixed green salad, French fries, sweet potato fried or onion rings as a side.  I, of course, took the healthy route and got the French fries.

The wrap was very good.  I also got some iced tea.  It's a serve yourself counter on the side.  They had regular and passion fruit.  The passion fruit tea was very tasty.

My friends pancakes were quite good he reported.  The pancakes came with a side of fresh fruit.  After a graveyard shift at a local hospital and a tough hike, the pancakes were enough to carb up his diet to keep going.

As Candace noted, the seating is close.  The tables are small and there are a fairly good number of them in that relatively small space.  When it's warmer. I'll have to go for breakfast and eat on the patio!

It was very nice out so the crowd partook in the abundance of outdoor seating. Indoors, there were only about 8-10 tables so I am unsure how they manage on cold days since it was very busy on Saturday. It is a quick order type of place in which you walk up to the counter, order, take a number and wait for them to bring it out.   

The food was WOW OH WOW! I got the chicken curry sandwich and sweet potato fries. I was given the option to substitute a fruit salad which I declined. Even though this does not sound very healthy it was as healthy as one can make a sandwich and fries. The fries were crispy but not greasy and the chicken curry was so smooth.  

I stole a bite of hubby's breakfast burrito which was so good. It was not your typical greasy, fall out of the burrito type of breakfast burrito. The pico de gallo on it was so nommerific. 

I glanced over as the waitress brought the next table over a chicken Caesar salad which looked AMAZE!

The atmosphere is very kid and dog friendly and the place seemed really clean and efficient. I saw a lot of couples, families, and people in yoga wear (its really close to a few studios). 

We ordered:

Sweet Greens (fresh juice): (3/5) This one had kale, spinach, cucumber, celery, apple, lemon & ginger root. I usually make my juice at home with the same ingredients so I'm pretty picky about the balance. It was very celery/cucumber heavy with barely a hint of kale or spinach. Also, it had a hint of bitterness because they used unpeeled cucumbers. I did like that it wasn't overly sweet with excessive apple (some places do that).

Energizer (fresh juice): (4/5) This one had beets, apples, carrots, lemon and ginger root. I only had a few sips of this since it wasn't mine. It had good combination that didn't have a super metallic taste of beets and very little hint of the lemon and ginger.

Acai bowl: (3/5) Small bowl but fairly yummy. The acai and banana are blended together so don't go digging for pieces of banana, like I was trying to do. It was more like a bowl of granola with a topping of acai/banana blend so I felt like it was a bit pricy for what you get. 

Blueberry muffin: (5/5) Free muffin with check-in. Total score!! This muffin was amazing. Seriously. It's as if a super fluffy biscuit and a blueberry muffin had a baby. It is very light, full of flavor, and doesn't sit heavy in your stomach. 

Side of bacon: (5/5) Because, bacon.",9Q_GYjcmNpmSMidqfcnL-A,1,1,4,FB0Eh119CaqZTBWKWY1asg

Of course they're not limited to just pasta.  I tried their burgers, grilled cheese sammich, breakfasts stuff, soops, salads, and recently just discovered their BBQ Chicken Wrap.   I'm no big fan of BBQ sauce, but this one was perfect.  Filled with grilled chicken lightly toss in BBQ sauce, lettuce, and their famous Onion Rings.  Mmmmm~ MMM.  Remind me of the Western Cheeseburger from Carl's Jr, without that feeling of guilt of all that calorie intake.  Wash it all down with a cup of their Fresh Watermelon Juice and you have yourself a wonderful meal.

Only downfall is that price may be a little too moderate, but it is Summerlin.   Now would be the best time to enjoy lunch here since the weather is perfect.  Heck, even the air here feels like Summerlin!

I called in curbside pickup because I am on my way to work and now I am stuck waiting another 20 minutes for them to remake it, now I'm going to be rushed to work. Last time I was here I just asked the girl for a side of chili flakes I was halfway done with my food when I asked her again then she still kept doing what she was going them finally got the chili flakes after. I mean by that point I was almost done. Another time I was here I ordered my food on a spinach wrap and it comes out with thick bread.

Very disappointed because they do have great menu options, but awed up dining experience almost every time I have been here or picked up to go. So if you come here just really pay attention and always check to make sure your food is how you would like it.

The 440 sounded delicious with goat cheese, roasted peppers, tomato, and lettuce on a grilled chicken breast (plus the avocado), but when I received this item, it was immediately apparent how easily it would fall apart. Not to mention that it had almost no flavor to it whatsoever.

When I moved back to Vegas after living in DC and San Fran, all I heard was how great, fresh, awesome and wholesome this place was from my BFs. Being in San Fran, you get so used to fresh and healthy and organic everything, you get so jaded, and take stuff like that for granted. In Vegas, there is not a lot of really fresh, organic FAST fare, save a Whole Foods, etc, so I jumped at the chance to try this place. After my fresh pedicure at Alexus Nail Bar, (which is in the same center) I ventured over to met my friend for lunch. First, I was shocked to see how small it was. I guess that is either here nor there, but every damn table was taken inside and out. And with the snotty Summerlin types. Ugh. But  I thought, ok...it's busy, that's a good sign I guess.  I ordered the turkey and avocado sandwich and a tea. Almost 15 bucks. Grrr. Then it came. Pretty small and unimpressive. Didn't look like it was made with any love, that's for sure. And it tasted like a preprepared sandwich at say, a Fresh and Easy or a Whole Foods. But wait. I liked the preprepared sandwiches from Fresh and Easy and Whole Foods a lot better. 
I guess I can say that I'm glad that places like Rachel's even exist in Vegas and are making the effort. For that, I applaud them. The last thing this town needs is another KFC or Taco Bell. We just don't have fast,  fresh organic food as readily available here from ""non- chains"" like they have on the coasts. I always had access to places like that, but here, yes, we have some of the best restaurants in the world on the strip, etc, but after that, you mostly have chains or non healthy fast food places. ""Healthy"" is just still not a buzzword here. So I guess I am a spoiled snob who just HATES that about Vegas.
As far as Rachel's Kitchen goes, I don't care what anyone says. This place does not live up to my standards for what you are supposedly paying for. You're better off getting a made to order sandwich at Whole Foods.

Rachel's Kitchen sits in the heart of Summerlin. When we got there, there was about twenty kids around kindergarten age, chaperoned by four women. Rich women who drove Navigators and such. 

My bf and I ordered a burger and a drink apiece, plus bf's soup and our bill came out to just under $30. 

The soup was a vegetarian split pea soup. It lacked that certain wholesome, salty, smokey, meatiness that meat gives, but I always appreciate a meatless alterantive ... even though tasty meat is so tasty ... 

Bf got a gorgonzola burger. He said it seemed healthy, fresh, and nicely portioned, ""a nice alternative to like, Chili's."" They sub out Gardenburgers for any burger patty, so I got a sauteed mushroom Gardenburger with swiss. It was pretty basic. I paid $8.50 for that bad boy. 

The fries and onion rings were mediocre. 

I also got an Incredible Hulk, a smoothie with banana, PB, tofu, and some other stuff. It was a'ight.

Eventually I decided that ""bistro"" is the best way to classify this restaurant. A very Summerlin feeling bistro. Hopefully that makes sense for you Vegas residents. If not, then another way to put it is that it's a smaller, bougie version of Panera Bread.

The food was okay. I had the turkey club, which had smoked turkey, bacon, Swiss cheese, avocado, romaine lettuce, tomatoes and mayo served on three pieces of sourdough bread. The portion size was good. I like that I had a choice of mixed green salad, french fries, sweet potato fries or onion rings with my sandwich. Whenever sweet potato fries are an option at a restaurant, I go with that.

Food was a bit pricey. $11 plus tax for a turkey club. Because of that fact, Rachel's Kitchen probably won't join my lunch rotation. Not a bad restaurant, but nothing special.",s8v5KKrZShVK29M4XP8Q3A,3,1,3,yjEGLw9NxV8ALlGZd4pgWw

The Husband ordered something from the breakfast menu too and was disappointed as well.  We can't even remember what it was, sadly enough.

This is my 3rd time here and until the rating for this spot becomes better, I won't be rushing back.  Clearly after my last visit and the reviews I was reading, this place needs a makeover in management and staff.  My friend received a credit from corporate when she became extremely ill after eating their eggs for breakfast. Their email was so apologetic and being it was only her 2nd visit and she loved it the 1st time, it encouraged her to give them another chance so we chose to dine for a quick lunch as we only had 45 mins to spare.

I arrived 1st and the seating was limited and the tables weren't wiped off yet but I hurry and grabbed a spot for the 3 of us. We ordered our food at the same time and then sat at our table and shortly came out the fresh oj which was immediately sent back b/c it had a weird taste and after her last visit, she didn't want to chance it.  Then after a little bit of time my veggie burger came out but was missing it's avocado so the employee went back and got me a side order and then I needed silverware. Then once I took my 1st bite, my Garden burger was so cold. Not cool off cold but never was cooked enough cold. They use the Garden Burger brand so I know the patties are frozen but what a disappointment! I paid $10 for a cold veggie burger with tap water and felt like it was a waste of money. And then to top off our visit, the rest of my party was still waiting for their food after I had finished mine.  They were waiting for so long one of them had to ask twice about it. It finally came out, they hurried and scarfed it down and we went out the door.

Again I had high hopes for this location but it seems like the management team is lacking in training their staff to accommodate and prepare for their potential high volume.

I am always looking for this type of place, but it seems as if Jason's Deli is often the only answer. Jason's, however, doesn't make you feel cozy, and they use their soup as a pasta sauce (a little weird) so I am glad I found Rachel's.

It is a small space decked out in warm orange and green with about 10 mosaic-covered tables. There is also classic outdoor Las Vegas seating, and by ""classic"" I mean you get to sit next to the parking lot. They only offer counter service, so you place your order and get a number to sit on your table. Overall, I would say the atmosphere is pleasant and clean.

The service is also pleasant. The lady behind the counter was super helpful. Special orders do not upset them, as I overheard her working with every guest to substitute this for that or give a side of this. Likewise, she told me if anything in my pasta dish was not to my liking they could leave it out. 

The menu offerings are all likable. No, I didn't eat them all. I just meant they sound like I could eat them all. Some highlights include a chopped salad with broccoli, red cabbage, olives and garbanzo beans, a garden burger, a beer battered fish wrap, curry chicken salad and mac & cheese. They also have banana chocolate chip pancakes for breakfast; I need to try those out. 

I had the Signature Pasta: penne with sautéed chicken breast, eggplant, sundried tomatoes, and mushrooms with a tomato cream sauce. It was the most expensive thing on the menu at $11.50, and I must say I am a bit disappointed it did not come with a little salad. (Prices are bordering on a bit too much, but the wraps, burgers and sandwiches all come with salad, french fries or onion rings.) To drink, I had their passion fruit iced tea. Bonus points for having a creative iced tea, and I also noticed that their selection of hot teas is whole leaf. More bonus.

The pasta came out piping hot; several minutes into eating, I was still having to blow on bites to cool them down. Hot food makes me happy, so that was a good thing. The combination of flavors was pretty scrumptious, and I scarfed down the entire bowl. 

I am definitely a fan for a quick lunch! It is fairly close to my hood, so that helps. I will definitely be exploring more menu items, i.e. pancakes, in the near future.",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,12,7,4,rFw3TXDnjdgFILjdwgAa6A

First time I had a breakfast wrap and it was good, it filled me quickly and tasted better then a Mcdonalds breakfast.

The second time we went in the employees were a little impatient as we weren't sure what we wanted and we kept asking questions, (don't worry, we didn't have anyone behind us in line so I didn't annoy many others) we settled on 2 chicken salad wraps and a Cesar wrap.

I hate saying but I wasn't impressed... the wrap was a little stale and the flavors were a little lacking.

My friend and I each had The Favorite:  3 eggs scrambled with goat cheese, spinach, sun dried tomatoes and avocado.  We had the seasoned potatoes with it as well.  We both were happy with our plates.  I thought it had very good flavor and the portions were good for us as well.

Grilled Chicken Breast 
Goat Cheese
Avocado
Roasted Red Peppers 
Roasted Tomatoes
Romain Lettuce. 
On a crispy chibatta roll with a fresh salad with a balsamic vinaigrette

As you can see, No mayo or any sauces but between the goat cheese and avocado you do not need it. 

For those of you that know me, I am not a huge sandwich person and this was one heck of a sandwich. I would invite ole Rachel into my place any day to come whip up one of these bad boys!!

Another plus was that the entire order was made to perfection No mistakes and not just sloppily through in boxes like some other places we order from.

My husband decided to pick us up breakfast. My egg white veggie omelette came with bacon! Not just one piece, but many. Not happy. When I called the manager acted as though I couldn't be right bc she ""checked it before it left"" and remembered that the first time the cooks made it with whole eggs and not egg whites. Ummm, why would I waste my morning calling about bacon in my omelette? So then I got annoyed and told her to give me her cell and I would gladly send her pics. What's really annoying is that when I said there was bacon, after initially not believing me then she had the nerve to say ""well is it just one piece?"" Ummm no, there's many pieces which you would not be able to see with all the avocado that was on top of the omelette. Really annoyed with her reaction. I'm not a ""customer is always right"" but this place has a defensive attitude about their own shortcomings. 
She did comp us one omelette, which I know my husband will use but I will go without this place. 

--------------------
Won't be back. 
I am a huge RK fan! I've been going for years to various locations in Vegas. With that being said, my favorite spot is the one near town center and Summerlin parkway. 
I came to this location the other day around lunchtime to grab food on my way home from yoga. The place seemed full outside but was only about half full inside. The manager took my order and when I handed him cash with exact change for my order he gave me coins back and I was puzzled why I didn't get $10 back. He asked me what was wrong and I told him I gave him $40.12 so my change should be $10. He looked so confused. It took a few people to help him and I finally got my correct change, but not without him appearing to be annoyed. 
I waited next to a gentleman who was also waiting for his to go order and they brought his out to him...several minutes later they waved me down to go pick mine up...odd. Usually they walk the food over to you and when I questioned why they would do one thing for one client and another for me the gentleman working didn't seem to understand English very well and just kept saying ""I don't understand"". He later apologized and said they were ""really busy"". So the crowd went from okay to too busy to walk the food out to clients in 3 minutes????
THEN, I open my food containers and I'm missing both sides. The manager told me I was supposed to grab the chips...and how would I have known that? I thought their kettle chips would be homemade. So then he had to send my sandwich back for them to add my fries which they didn't give many and they were all limp and cold. 
The manager then proceeded to tell me ""that's why it's always a good thing to check your food before you leave"" Yeah I guess when you're disorganized it is good. I know the RK that I usually go to will open your food up in front of you to confirm your order, as do most places. I rolled my eyes and the manager asked me what was wrong and I said I didn't appreciate having to get up several times for my food, once for my juice and once for my food, while others were served their food. I also thought the entire visit seemed very unorganized and the manager just seemed to have a chip on his shoulders. Not once did he smile at his staff or clients. 
I love my RK but I will leave this one alone and stick to my usual spot, even if that means driving out of the way. At least the people smile at the one I frequent.",tbuQQqyB_rBN8kqru5IFUw,0,0,1,8PwaBgdRKiiCgabi3XZNEQ

Only drawback is that the items for what you are getting is slightly expensive ( at least the breakfast items) but all in all if you are in a hurry, good place to stop, I would find somewhere else for breakfast though.",ir1hKCK4RVFdyuPtgRKtBQ,0,0,3,4QsZEdgtQYKq8neoLteOOA

They also have the turkey bacon option.  My husband had the chicken Caesar wrap.  It was fresh with a generous portion of grilled chicken breast, crispy lettuce and tomatoes. Make sure to try one of their homemade muffins.  We had the orange cranberry and it was delicious.",P0Qxuuutpz7bot929EqzZg,0,1,5,_HC0Tj7GkOqIu56rpqFMkg

Very nice little place on Hualapai with a ton of parking. Indoor and outdoor seating is available and even at 3-00 on a Saturday it's busy. Lots of wealthy suburbanites with fancy watches, cool shoes and expensive haircuts are the main clientele. Beautiful salads and delicious looking sandwiches are to my left and right. It's not cheap but they have very good natural ingredients and the portions are ample.


Oh, my berry smoothie was excellent. I'm saving up and I'll go back for a sandwich.",hRzmJCPmV1_ggM5jSxq2bA,1,1,4,TCLIQWsrI_GoRvmKgqSRIA

At first, I ignored paying 5.95 for a kids meal that only consisted of a very small amount of fries and 2 chicken fingers. My other options were to pay the same price for a grilled cheese or a pb&j. 
I ordered a burger and was happy because I was allowed to substitute the fries from a list of about 5 options. I choose the onion rings only to find out it came with a total of 4. 
I did enjoy ordering at the counter and having my food brought to me when the time came however. 
Bottom line, a bit pricy and you don't get that great of a quality of food. I'm sure I'll skip it next time I'm in the area.",u9BhiR7IO6sz41YBLxVryg,0,0,5,Q4jAu5xu26n_rNnMwkdEMw
5948046,2017-11-18,0,Qy_tDaVTWlS14fEglzo1Tg,"It gets two stars as staff tried. I took my kids here instead of IHOP-BIG MISTAKE. The menu is pretty limited even if it looks like it is large. Prices aren't bad but you shouldn't advise a mother of a 4 year old that the French toast is only a couple of dollars more without saying IT IS ON LARGE PIECES OF FRENCH BREAD. 

I am on a zero carb and zero sugar diet, I asked about substituting potatoes (see dried out nasty potatoes pic) and toast (no butter) for avocado and was told they maybe could give a few slices. So I brainstormed and asked about bacon-the only truly good part of the meal-at least on the side.

The omelette said to be ""PROTEIN LOVERS OMELETTE"" with chicken (so I thought-I think I found a piece) had burnt bacon in it, was cold when served and the cheese was dry-see photo.

I always drove by and thought-hmmm I should try it there...NOPE-wouldn't ever go back. 

Now add insult to injury as any mother knows an iPad can be your best friend-problem is not only did their WiFi  it work but when I told them they didn't seem too bothered.

Before o forget I asked for water having seen bottles out of the corner of my left eye-but they gave me a cup-so I went to the self serve drinks-only found Vitamin water-looked and had to ask apparently it streams through the lemonade part with a button in front for ""just water"". They may have mentioned that. Also though she comped me the milk for my daughter I did actually order it.

Finally when leaving I asked for a to go box-I figured maybe the kids would eat some of the French toast later-they gave me the smallest plastic box I just said f-it-flung what I could in and left-leaving my daughter's sippy cup of milk-which they seemed to know but nobody bothered coming after me to point out (this is usually at really great service places) and when I walked in they knew exactly why I was back.

That's off my bucket list at least.",DmtgMXZTKmTILg6OyzhJbQ,1,0,2,Tn7rIFBeaCVI8i9cXu-fUQ
