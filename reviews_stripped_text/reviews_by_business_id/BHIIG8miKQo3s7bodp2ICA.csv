108697,2017-06-03,0,BHIIG8miKQo3s7bodp2ICA,Four crew members working and they still can't get it together. I ordered one chicken sandwich and it took them 2o min or more. Ridiculous! Atleast the were friendly and chicken was good.,Xx0ccyq8NH-5BzhTid0TBg,1,0,3,zpcXYMfaYPvCgYRxiz4qsQ

Everyone that's been in food industry knows that just excuse, they are rude and extremely slow, the other location on rancho is much faster even when it's busy , food was ok again considering how long it took figured my food be fresher consider I waiting on ""fresh fries""",us2lel9r9Noe7hFtPG7haA,1,0,1,x4xDHZcaMI7HLc5p2RlkZQ
1724929,2018-04-16,0,BHIIG8miKQo3s7bodp2ICA,"I went a few months ago and had average service but pretty decent food.  I decided to stop by again when shopping Sunday and had the loveliest service from super friendly young gents.  It looks like a new crew and I was pleased with how attentive they were with everyone ordering and getting food.  Everyone seemed to be working hard and had a smile on their face.  My food was even better than my first visit.  I will absolutely be back, glad they finally have a good food place in Walmart!",Sw69CeTA03hsCR_UqJTlvA,1,0,5,m8e0WFtjGWV-6lJN4WOIQw
1769598,2017-06-26,0,BHIIG8miKQo3s7bodp2ICA,the food is great its the staff. EVERY time we come here they mess up our order. Its written correctly on the receipt but not when our order comes out. The staff often ignores customers who are obviously waiting. Other time they are all chatting in the back. This specific time the person who was supposed to be cooking was chatting with a leaving employee. And the person using the register was flirting with the girl in front of me AFTER he had taken her order and ignoring the fact there were other people in line. You shouldn't have to wait 30 minutes for your food and then have it be not what you ordered. I have never seen the manager and the workers are rude when you tell them your order was wrong. I would give it a 5 for food but who knows if theyre messing with it too.,l-9zRvkoY1oMuCf8q1ny7Q,0,0,1,l-giddlGrWhq20F6XTd5xw
2229373,2017-04-29,0,BHIIG8miKQo3s7bodp2ICA,"I like this place. Hate the incompetence of the workers. All I wanted was some ice cream. To start off there was just people standing around when all you have to do is fill a cup. Second of all, the worker took my ice cream next to the fryer to put the lid on and I ended up with some crumbs in it? WTF. Like please people. And all the other times I have been here they always forget the sauces. It's listed on the receipt for crying out loud. All the workers just look like they hate life and screw up my order every time.",rIICrnNnCZ3JCcWfyIQf9g,0,0,1,2HH_naB9nqBC-SteByG7NQ
3413739,2018-01-02,0,BHIIG8miKQo3s7bodp2ICA,All the people I have encountered have been very nice. I have no issues with the people that work there. The food itself is much better than Sonic which was inedible. I am hoping that my last visit was a one-off. I like the fries which are seasoned and yummy. I ordered a fish sandwich on my last visit. When I got home it was over fried and incredibly dry. I had to throw it out. Don't over fry the fish!,4Iwu57GSychxpqa4w4HAMQ,0,0,3,QQU0rT7CkWxLNeW5CuMJlA
4482186,2017-12-20,0,BHIIG8miKQo3s7bodp2ICA,"Awful customer service. Would not recommend going here unless you plan on being treated like garbage. I definitely wouldn't want to come to this location again and deal with this staff. Clearly they don't want to be working here so they should go find a job they actually like instead of taking it out on the customers. Disrespectful, rude, ignorant staff. Less than 1 star for sure. Don't go here.",qfxu1zTDmssFiOE4WqykWw,0,0,1,kkAQPgVfE8EcZxJ-NoGXhg
4616710,2017-06-07,1,BHIIG8miKQo3s7bodp2ICA,For a fast food on the go I enjoy checkers. It's pretty rare to find these days so when I spot one I grab myself a treat. They opened one up in a Walmart on Decatur and I was excited about it more than I could say about their employees.,ICq9zgSe4etRlHsbfqQfTg,0,0,2,y6pT1Kw1whsFgjXXgcOgWg

4865509,2017-06-27,0,BHIIG8miKQo3s7bodp2ICA,Not what I expect. It was a long wait to order and for our order to be cooked. The wings were so small and so was the burgers. Fries were delicious need to improve their customer services,pVXCgvmDIMUec805aP9YpQ,0,0,3,LA1nqDBDlRQvu2Wvx6qycQ
4883567,2018-04-05,0,BHIIG8miKQo3s7bodp2ICA,I love it. Customer service is great. Got chicken basket and all American cheese burger. 10/10. Every time I come to Walmart I will return to the checkers. I want to try everything and see how it is.,_XppjmiQUVel7OCAXuM0BQ,0,0,5,G7gpe5Px7nl6Kx6PAt5Fpw
4940623,2017-11-09,1,BHIIG8miKQo3s7bodp2ICA,"This is now the second or third time I've had major issues here , over simple things that really shouldn't be issues like being friendly while taking my order .

Tonight was the last straw when I was ordering with Christina even though my receipt says Nicholas . Turns out she is the owner of this checkers . While placing my order I was admittedly indecisive but felt like I was being rushed which Christina apologized for while doing my refund for something she over charged me for because she felt saying spicy chicken sandwich meant I wanted a $6.19 combo which is why I was extra slow upon paying because I suck at math and doubted myself and at this time she wasn't all that friendly and being someone with anxiety I'm more sensitive but anyway ended up having to do a refund for that and opted not to even get the sandwich since she didn't know the ala carte price for that and felt something was weird about the fact I wanted a large soda by itself (which was for my mom) the sandwich was my thing and I don't like fries and the past few times they had gotten my sandwich wrong so I wasn't even sure I wanted it anymore after all this so she did kindly refund me for the $4 and some change which to me is a lot on a single income . Anyhow I waited for my order and they still had not gotten my sons Soda to me when the gentleman gave me my order friendly and all I requested my kids Coke just for Christina to get it for me with attitude and blatant disregard to my saying thank you ! I asked the kind gentleman her name since the receipt had someone else and found out she is the owner . Let's just say the weekly trips and 5 star review are definitely gone I will he giving my business to wetzel from now on . My kids may end up still wanting this from time to time and possibly my mom but I for sure won't be eating ..",vwLV4TkRMoghs86tB1Ke8Q,2,1,1,NLGAzbNNMQXy3GgArChA0w
