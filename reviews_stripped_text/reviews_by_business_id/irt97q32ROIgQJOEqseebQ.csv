I had the all-you-can-eat sushi special and it was completely sub-par. As far as sushi goes, Ah Sin's sushi is a total sin. The rolls were cold and dry which meant they were likely all pre-made. You can also only order a pre-set number of rolls at one time. Other member of my party had the Seafood Fried Rice which he loved.

I took a peek at the menu, and immediately thought this place was kind of having an identity crisis. Like, there was sushi, but the menu seemed chinese, but there was pad thai. I dunno...maybe this was asian food for George Bush (like...""ooh, it sounds exotic...must be asian""). I got some sashimi to start, and then some chow fun for dinner. Two other people in my group got the all you can eat sushi.

Not going to lie, the chow fun was pretty solid. The sashimi was hit or miss...one order was great, the other tasted not quite so fresh. However, the people that ordered all you can eat sushi got screwed hard. The service was exceptionally slow, and they would only let you order a very limited number of super boring rolls at a time. Therefore, although the peeps who got this were still hungry, we left anyways since we didn't want to wait a million hours for boring sushi.

Our waiter was pretty clueless too...they very clearly did not know their menu very well, or what was in/came with many of the items. Bummer. Price wasn't horrific, I think I paid $35 sans drink.

We're in a rush to hit up the clubs later that evening and we want sushi?

When they were served it was obvious something was wrong.  We ordered identical rolls but mine were half the size with twice the rice.  There is good business and then there is just completely screwing your customer, and it was obvious I was getting the royal treatment on this deal.  My tuna rolls tasted off, the shrimp roll had no flavor and the rice was under cooked to boot.

Sure the place is nice and chic, that's expected. It's effin' Vegas. But the food, gah! The only thing good about it was the Miso soup and that was probably because we were all hungrier than Ghandi.

Us: ""Uhh, okay?""

She piled the plates on our table and kept making sure that we knew that the kitchen was closing at 10:30 so it kind of felt like she was kind of rushing us to scarf down our food and get the hell outta there. The sushi she brought us was plentiful. Yeah. Plenty full of SHIT! It was like someone took porridge, froze it, thawed it for about 10 seconds and used that as the rice. I felt like I was eating something a kindergartener made during arts n' crafts time with glue for the sauce and construction paper for the seaweed. On top of all that, we still had our waitress yelling at us about the time.

3294123,2008-03-25,0,irt97q32ROIgQJOEqseebQ,"Wow, this place gets ripped a new one.  Don't get me wrong, I understand why people would not like this place.  It is an overpriced, fusion asian place in a casino.  Since casinos expect all their venues to make money including the comps they give to big players, this has resulted in menu prices to go through the roof.  Of course, there is increasing food prices in general, but it does not explain the situation alone.

So, when I dine at a casino restaurant, my expectations are a bit lower.  As I tell everyone who will listen, eat anywhere but a casino.  I end up doing so because the people I am with are too lazy or do not think that they are missing out on anything.  Anyway, on to review.

Ambience and service are very good.  Our server did speak in heavily accented English, so he was a bit hard to understand.  It does not bother me, but I realize some people are annoyed by this.

For the food, I think it is a fair parallel to PF Chang's.  If you hate PF Chang's because it isn't real Chinese, then you will hate this place.  This place is for tourist from all over the place and often places that only have a PF Chang's representing Asian food.

I think that given that you are in a overpriced casino restaurant, the prices are decent.  It is a bit less than the Wynn's Chinese restaurants.  At least the bowl of Hot and Sour soup is $6 and not $9 or whatever it was.  Most of the entrees ran about $15 on average for your typical noodles, Mongolian beef and such.  The portions are not outrageously tiny like the Wynn, but they are not terribly big either.  If you have a ton of heavy eaters, you had better make your way to the buffet instead.

At least I got my rice fix and I was not charged extra for it  (a very common sin in casino Chinese restaurants).

If you want decent Chinese food, jump in a cab and go to:

Let's go through the ordeal step by step, shall we?

Our party of 7 arrives, and we wait maybe 15 minutes. Pretty fast for a decently sized group, I'd say. The waiter arrives and is more than willing to help explain each dish. Up until this point, I found the staff to be very friendly and knowledgeable. I should have known there's no such thing as a safe bet in Vegas.

We all order a pretty decent variety of dishes and appetizers. There was sushi involved, but the sushi felt refrigerated. Hard, gummy rice surrounding rubbery fish. Ah, appetizing.

There were cheese wontons that were, upon further inspection, lacking in cheese and flavor. Ah, wonderful.

I ordered pad thai, which is a pretty generic dish. A friend ordered glass noodles, which have the special distinction of being translucent when cooked. The once knowledgeable waiter must have suffered mild brain trauma on the way to the kitchen, because when he returned with pad thai some time later, he first took it to the table next to us, who were already finishing their swill. After figuring out his mistake, he took the pad thai to my friend. 

""Glass noodles!"" he says.

I interject and say ""that can't be glass noodles.""

The waiter, the man who WORKS here, proceeds to argue with me about glass noodles. I simply said that couldn't be it, and that glass noodles are clear. He's a tough cookie and insists that he brought the correct dish. As he's arguing, a second waiter comes and shouts ""glass noodles!"" and places it in front of my friend. He brought the right dish, and the first waiter is left holding my pad thai, which I have to ask for. He was completely lost. Ah, incompetence.

Every dish that arrived, went to the wrong table first. I didn't realize it was customary to introduce my food to everyone else in the restaurant before allowing me to eat it. 

After all the waiting and confusion, the food was terrible! There were 7 of us, and usually someone out of a group that big would find something they like. Only one. That's a 14% satisfaction rate...how do you like those odds in a casino? We actually left the restaurant starving, because 90% of the food wasn't consumed. Oh, and the price wasn't nice, either. Ah, robbery.

I went there with my half and was expecting to be blowen away with the food especially that the location is amazing- it is right in front of the water falls on the strip. We sat outside to experience the air and beautiful environment since it was great summer weather. The place looks like the one that you would spend at least 30 mins getting ready and looking all fancy but if you do so, you will regret the time wasted. So, here we are inside, especially happy due to the ""All you can eat"" sign. (BIG mistake) When we started ordering we were told that it is per person only. Doesn't make sense? It didn't for us either!!!!! Here how it works-if you order one ""all you can eat"" order- only one person can eat it (and trust me you can't eat and more to that, you won't want to eat their rolls) and anyone at the table with you is not allowed to touch it)))) The waiter smiled when he was telling that to us, and It felt like they are spying to make sure I'm not eating from my bf's plate))))))) Anyways, we still were positive that it's possible to enjoy and have nice time there, so we order more food. And there it comes....and it's almost visible. The rolls are super tiny, like those were babies of regular rolls. For about 15 mins we were trying to understand if that's a kids menu or they have mixed our order with some people who are not hungry and most probably vegetarian, coz you wouldn't find fish there even if you'd pull out a magnifying glass. Anyways, long story short, we tried to force it down with a glass of water per tiny roll, but eventually we gave up and decided to order shashimi, coz at leas there they can't hide it in tons of rice!!! Sashimi was ok, but it could be just because we had a big bottle of hot saki by then)))

4710657,2009-02-21,0,irt97q32ROIgQJOEqseebQ,"I wish I'd checked out reviews on this site...but no, had to find out the hard way.  The reason the all-you-can-eat sushi was horrid and didn't look like what others were being served at the sushi bar, is that it came (probably pre-made) from another kitchen.  We had a great time - the waiters were pleasant & solicitous and the food came quickly, but afterwards felt we had been ripped off.  We realized that those rolls weren't the same quality as the beautiful dragon roll (though it did have fake crab) we ordered from the sushi chef (whose name tag read ""Fuji"" but spoke Chinese), and felt we had been purposefully misled by the menu and offer to move to the sushi bar.  Also, in our excitement about ""all-you-can-eat"", we forgot to ask to be seated in the room with the Bellagio fountain view...my whole reason for seeking out the restaurant when I saw it from the street.  That option was not offered though it wasn't busy there at the time.
A few days later, I got in touch with the manager, Patrick, and he very apologetically offered to comp us at another restaurant owned by the corp., but since we'd already returned home, he went to the trouble to find our ticket, and is going to credit the two sushi meals back to my card.  I hadn't brought up the idea of a refund, just said that it should have been made clear that it wouldn't be from the sushi bar.  He didn't make any excuses for the tricky menu or admit that a lot of disgruntled people call up, but was very nice and prompt about addressing my complaint.
I think people just have to be aware that they are paying a premium to eat at one of the gorgeous theme hotels like Paris.

1) Horrible service. Our waiteress was very mean, slow, negligent, and very effing rude.  

2) The all-you-can-eat sushi tasted like old costco sushi.  Nasty.  The rice tasted old and really dry.  The seafood was very scarce and you can only order 3 rolls at a time.  And it took forever for our waitress to come back each time so we can order more sushi.

3) I ordered the Tom Kha soup and it tasted nothing like how it should be.  It was watered down, oily, and it wasn't even spicey!!!! 

4) My friends ordered the combination fried rice and it was very dry and bland.  Even the meat tasted like rubber.

5) It took forever for our waitress to bring our check to us.  She knew we were done eating a long time ago and she still ignored us.

6) The restaurant manager was an A-hole.  After our horrible horrible experience, we complained to the manager and he was being such an asshole.  He was telling us that we should have brought it up to his attention in the beginning of the dinner. The reason why we waited was because we gave it a benefit of the doubt.  We were trying really hard to be understanding and was hoping our service would improve but it didn't.  Who is he to tell us how and when to complain.  He just made his restaurant look even more stupid.  And because we ""waited too long"" to complain, he only comped us for the 2 all you can eat sushi even though a majority of what we ordered was nasty as hell.  We still complained and he ended up taking off the fried rice.  Big freaking whoop.  

I seriously hope this restaurant closes down or at least get new management.  They seem pretty unorganized here and by judging the other reviews on here, I'm not the only one that thinks this restaurant is down the drain.  Avoid this restaurant by all means..

5602531,2009-08-02,0,irt97q32ROIgQJOEqseebQ,"During our stay in Las Vegas, we decided to go try Ah Sin because it was close and right across from the Bellagio (frontal view of the water show). However, we regretted it once the food came.

We did learn a lesson from all of this. Don't forget to check yelp before trying a new restaurant... Two of us had iphones... and we failed to utilize these tools...

The food was horrendous. All of us agreed that we never had sushi that bad before. 2 of us just stopped eating because we couldn't handle it anymore. However, one did continue eating after admitting it was the worse he ever had; he's one of those that will eat ANYTHING when he is hungry. A description of the sushi is tightly packed and semi-hard rice and a small sliver of previously refrigerated fish. We were watching a couple having dinner across from us, and the expressions on their face was priceless. The guy was having trouble swallowing and you could easily tell. The girl had her glass of water refilled at about a rate of twice a minute...  

The view was spectacular. We had the pleasure of seeing 3 water shows. They weren't the same, Bellagio changes the songs and the way the water pressure moved. It was an awesome view that made our suffering a little more bearable. 

""If I knew you guys were from California, I would have told you guys not to order the all you can eat.""
""I'm sorry I couldn't tell you beforehand, because I would get fired.""
Our server was hilarious! We all had a good laugh after our meal. He did a good job bringing food out quickly and refilling glasses etc, but he was able to sort of connect with us after with a good laugh. We were able to save another couple from ordering the all you can eat. 

If there was a no star option, I would give this restaurant none. There are two things that I do not understand. The first is that, how does a restaurant that serves 2nd rate food maintain a reputation to keep and pay for a lot that's on a prime corner street right across from the Bellagio. Another is a question that applies to many restaurants. Why do you maintain an all-you-can-eat option when it does not further your reputation. Do it as a promotion if you want, but don't keep it.

Also, there's no bathroom in the place! You have to walk outside to the casino floor to use the bathroom. What's up with that? It's not exactly close by either.

Don't confuse all you can eat sushi with a sushi buffet. You're seated at a table here and you can order from a limited variety of choices. The order is made fresh and brought to your table.
