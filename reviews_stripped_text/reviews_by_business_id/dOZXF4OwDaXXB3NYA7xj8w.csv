411911,2013-11-08,0,dOZXF4OwDaXXB3NYA7xj8w,This was the worst subway experience. Amazingly skimpy with veggies.  They added 2 slices of each veggie for a foot long sandwich. Very sad,jzgVakqxFqoQ-xsSfV7iRg,0,0,2,ZwKx0ymBvJMf_hEnx-rwLA

I have been waiting in queue for around 30 mins at 12.30 am...the guy working here is unprofessional ...just not because he is serving only one customer so long ... he keeps on playing with them and made others to wait outside in cold weather...,VX_2OqgZAUiq5skLn6oO5Q,0,0,1,4RiOzNwmsazEKysxQFRDrA

The sandwich maker went out of her way to make sure that I didn't get any extra tuna, going so far as to scrape any tuna clinging on the outside of the scoop onto the storage bin side. 12"" tuna sub with meal deal= $13.00.  Most expensive I have ever bought.  Never again at this location.",G54TmVfKA_Vt-67eXI-m3g,0,0,2,inCsphzt9EPAGcF7qeEwxg

We purchased from this Subway in late June during our stay in Vegas, and watched as the ""Sandwich Artists"" belittled people for not understanding which side of the shop to line up on. In fairness to the customers who were confused:

A. There was no sign which clarified with side to start on.
B. There was an influx of people standing around, making it difficult to ascertain the ordering process setup.
C. Many of the people in line didn't appear to be from America, and possibly have never even been to a Subway.

Despite this, the staff seemed more than content in making disparaging comments among each other, and rolling their eyes when addressing questions from first-time customers who had difficulty with English.

If you can't handle routine customer questions/confusion, you probably shouldn't be working in customer service.",PrVV5XFfbrkZCBD_Hj2SDA,0,0,1,rBDKlRXlVp_E4Vjrk1Rb0g
1252708,2013-09-04,2,dOZXF4OwDaXXB3NYA7xj8w,"This is a pretty standard food court Subway with supra-standard prices. I guess that's what one should expect here on the strip. Certainly one can get a footlong sub for 1/3-1/4 the price of a buffet - but do you really come all the way to Vegas just to end up eating at subway?!

Well, if you're on a budget and looking for a healthier option than Sbarro, Panda Express, Johnny Rocket's, or if you're actually tired of gorging yourself at the Bellagio buffet - or if you're like me and all of the above apply, then yes. Subway it is.",jqTa-RtGU26q3TFTmMZOAw,1,1,3,5UQB9P8LnseZKQiaVhSmPQ
1455919,2013-10-27,1,dOZXF4OwDaXXB3NYA7xj8w,At the Subway in Ballys I met an extremely rude food server. I asked to try the broccoli soup. The soup was all cream so I asked him why. He said we are out and I asked if he was getting more. He said well it will take a few minutes. I said ok I will wait. He rolled his eyes came back and said we don't have any need to thaw it out. I said ok how long. He again shrugged and said will be awhile. The female working said the soup is often watery just comes that way sometimes. I said to Saui if you don't care and don't want to sell me soup just say so but to date you are the rudest person I have met in Vegas. His response was there are other Subways in town go find one. I am shocked a brand such as Subway can employ 2 rude and non trained staff.,BoijVjwnnsNFTmZv8YEwQw,1,0,1,v9dlMcJm6Qfm0LfEAJNxFg

First off it wasn't! Second it was not rip nor tore! Third it didn't even look like it at all is what baffles
me. Told him to held it up in the light then he seen the strip and apologized but by than who in the right mind would still purchase so I grab my money and left. They even gave me the wrong corporate
number and called security talked to security and they said the same thing that the bill was not fake but the humiliation they really went to the extreme! Not profession at all and racist! I can't believe what had happen tonight.. ruined my night just because I wanted to go grab some cookies smh!",N3bpA04dSyzH-13kxOdf8A,0,0,1,_Wayo4G8JhgwNzgwD2eopw

4158013,2017-06-19,0,dOZXF4OwDaXXB3NYA7xj8w,They got all night and they know it. I could not imagine slower service. The employees actually stopped to have a conversation about someone bossing someone around before finishing making my sandwich. And then a lightbulb fell in the food and the girl just put it back in. Who knows what fell in the food. Not to mention prices are doubled from normal Subway prices (10.28$ for a regular turkey footlong). My sandwich was made by Tiara (that's what the sales receipt said) and it was quite possibly the worst experience I've ever had at Subway,sXJwXEHR64393fWO4Qdq6A,0,0,1,OqM1qkioGg1e0Tu9NesfPQ

The food court has been renovated since I last came and the seating area is nicer.  The Subway wasn't busy and it's Subway, so I know what I would be getting.  The prices are higher than I have seen but cheaper than a restaurant.  I ordered the foot long sweet onion chicken teriyaki for $9.75.  Service was quick, and they gave me ample vegetables and sauce on my sub.  Quick service and Subway quality.  Come if you want a quick and fast meal.",wfi0T-xq_P5sKQvwQitlYg,0,0,3,QI2V4kj_2ZPQUXoeTpwJ-w

Prices are double of what you would normally pay outside. I tried to save $4 by not buying a soda and just getting a glass of water, but they didn't even have this available. I said ""no thanks"" to the $4 water bottle too.

I was 4th in line and it took a good 15 minutes to finally pay for my expensive sub.",VYOQLKuR0Ugy9lU-QiOuLw,0,0,2,_zh4aDcXDGebrCA_0Zynew
