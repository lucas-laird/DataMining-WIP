1161444,2018-03-11,0,HNAH23RNUTTivzhebQTozw,I'm so happy this Capriotti's is near my house. The staff is very nice and will take care of you. The drive thru window is very nice and fast also. This is gonna be my new spot every Friday after work.,W_n-Gr8zEW91ho15_jC6iA,0,0,5,_cd-sBLDdxUJ1-bCVThVSQ

1493030,2018-06-17,0,HNAH23RNUTTivzhebQTozw,"This is one of the worst Capriotti's in Las Vegas!! Tonight, I went into this store to order a hot capastrami and was told they were out of pastrami.  I find that hard to believe!!  After asking about other hot sandwiches, I realized why I couldn't have a hot sandwich.  They were cleaning the grill and they did not want to grill anymore hot sandwiches for the night.  They were basically closing the grill down at 7:50 pm and the store was not closing until 9:00pm.  Doesn't this seem a little early to close the grill down?? So if you want a hot sandwich you better show up early!!!!",ZeSlsWnqrZbKSyO3jc6zgQ,1,0,1,WdKf_lEMxxmND-HdJfNcHQ
1520970,2018-01-29,1,HNAH23RNUTTivzhebQTozw,"Night time came and I had a hankering for a salad.  Not having the proper salad fixings, I thought I would pay this new Capriottis's a visit.  Called in my order for a ""Black & Bleu.""  This beauty contains mixed salad with roast beef, gorgonzola crumbles, sweet peppers, tomatoes, and fried onions.  This all comes with just the right amount of gorgonzola vinaigrette for a proper dosing.  I was advised this location has a pick-up window. Great!  I don't even have to get out of my vehicle.

Rolled in and quickly called an audible.  I figured I would park and get out to check out the inside.  It was bright and shiny.  Open and spacious, there is plenty of room to handle any sort of meal rush.

Service was polite and friendly.  

Kind of weird to be so up on the salad at a sandwich shop.  I avoid bread as much as I can no days, but still give myself a glorious cheat day.  Cheat day or not....I am adding this location to my list of dining options.",HJj82f-csBI7jjgenwqhvw,2,2,4,tO-nvANQapfEAPClVCtu7w
2050010,2018-04-07,0,HNAH23RNUTTivzhebQTozw,"Have eaten at Capriotti's in my old neighborhood many times and they were always great.  This new one near my house not so much.  I sat and waited forever to get my simple medium chicken cheese steak and 20 min later still no sandwich.  When I asked where it was nobody knew anything.  The ""team"" here doesn't communicate very well.  They are in some need of some proper management as everyone seems a bit confused.  After finally getting my $12 sub I was hoping the quality of product would make up for the service.  Nope.  The sub I got was so soggy the bread fell apart trying to eat it.  What happened to the bread being crisped up a bit and maybe draining some grease out of the meat?  A soggy gross mixture with way too much cheese.  Shoot.  Was hoping for another  good restaurant option near me but I won't be going to this Capriottis again.",kKmQRjAeBSlWKMsG1jerKw,1,0,1,-d2tMWwx-k9dhAziw-o8Xw

2519681,2018-04-12,0,HNAH23RNUTTivzhebQTozw,"I've been holding back from writing this review, giving this place chance after chance, but after getting an ungodly amount of mayo when I asked for marinara, I'm done.

I've been there about 6,7 times since they opened. First time took a long time, and the staff was a bit rude, but it was made well. After that, there was at least one thing wrong with everything I've ordered from here. Sugar cookie when I asked for chocolate chip, regular chicken when I ask for veggie, turkey when I asked for pastrami. 

The hiring manager here needs to take a hard look at what he/she's done. The service here is flawed. I give them 2 stars because it's a greatly constructed sandwich, but more often than not there's a fatal error in my meal",OBUuKLUM2rF90gpRHGro3A,0,0,2,Vw6zGffJtN-yCvG-I6SNMg
2938747,2018-03-08,0,HNAH23RNUTTivzhebQTozw,"We were so excited to have Capriottis move in right next door.  However, there is an A team and a B team.  Food is always good, but the customer service is hit or miss.  We are borderline ready to ban it and pretend its not right around the corner.  We have had every issue you can imagine, from forgetting to give us a sandwich (we only ever order 2 shouldn't be a rough task) to wrong order.  However, tonight took the cake.  We ordered ahead of time on the app and arrived 6 minutes past the pickup time.  I sat at the drive through window for 4 minutes while I watched 3 employees just standing around and a 4th cleaning the windows.  No one inside and no one else in the drive through. I checked my app thinking I might have messed up and the app (its been gltichy but ok) said I ordered it for tomorrow.  I was like oops.  Thats why no one coming to the window, no one expecting me.  So I drove around and went in sheepishly to see if they could whip up my order and what I believe to be the manager said, ""oh no, we have your order right here"".  I explained I sat at the window for a few minutes and she was like, oh thats weird.  The window cleaner I was observing from the drive through window had made her way to the sneeze guard and pretended I was not standing next to her while she continued to clean and almost knock me over.  Not sure what the heck is up with the B team, but if we have 1 more experience with them I am pretty sure it will be the last.",7MpCoetFK6124xGiAYNCXA,1,0,2,-OwYJ_j1RMvlOLlkifSJ-g

Sandwich hadn't even been started but I was still pleasant no worries. 10 mins later got my food took the apologies for the delay but said it was ok and left...all in all a good customer for the delay....get back to my office the specific NO CHEESE not and verbal comment it was the cheesesteak without the CHEESE was ignored...melted cheese...no way to eat around it...after being so nice about the delay you couldn't make sure my sandwich was correct? Got my money back will not be going back.

4206499,2018-03-29,0,HNAH23RNUTTivzhebQTozw,The first time we ate there this place was new. I ordered a Philly Cheese Steak sandwich and it was disappointing in taste and sparse on the meat. A disappointment. Tonight we went back and they seem to have a better grasp on things. Ordered the meat ball and Mozzarella sub and it was first rate. I'll order that from now on. Good people made me raise my 3 to 4 stars.,yhjwkclgQoWMqxISoVQy_Q,1,0,4,JPoAewH40ne7V0CN1Gb7qQ
4245390,2018-03-11,0,HNAH23RNUTTivzhebQTozw,"Placed an order to-go. They forgot one of our sandwiches, the other sandwich we ordered ended up being so salty that nobody would eat it, and they didn't have one of our soups we ordered so they replaced it with a salad. The whole order was completely jacked up. Don't recommend this location.",WH_FjW6UpU0PWecohzWlEg,1,0,1,p-XwS2DcEsIJzGgcK9j4Jw
4678775,2018-04-13,0,HNAH23RNUTTivzhebQTozw,"I have been eating Capriotti's for over a decade.  They opened this location recently and I have been in before and everything was fine; good food and friendly service.  Not so much today.  We arrived a little before 12:20 and the polite cashier took our order and we paid by 12:20.  It is now 12:58 and my husband has no food.  It took over 20 minutes for my Italian sandwich to be made and it was mediocre at best, the veggies aren't as fresh as I am used to.  At minute 30 my husband asked about his sandwich (he is a tall and friendly guy) and was told with attitude that they didn't have a ticket with his food on it.  He was then ignored while workers snapped at each other to make his food.  I worked in an expensive seafood restaurant and know what customer service is and this isn't it.  There was no apology and I am frankly livid.  It has now been over 40 minutes with no food and no acknowledgement whatsoever.  People that came in 5 minutes ago have their food while my husband sits hungry.  Any sort of apology or act of remorse or care would be great and I will update if one comes.  If not I will drive out of my way to never come here again.

Update:  After 46 minutes my husband received his cheesesteak.  It is hot and delicious and he got an apology from the cashier.  It seems to be her first job but she tried and I commend her for that.  Whoever owns/ manages this location better look at their staff and figure it out or they will lose business for sure.",IXh2jXTciaheoPofpiDd4g,1,0,1,23dovzSXIFMH2Yw_dxkBOA
4685411,2018-04-08,0,HNAH23RNUTTivzhebQTozw,"Visited this location yesterday, sad to say the only reason I am giving it 3 stars is due to my husbands Italian being pretty good. The Bobby absolutely sucked! Come on guys, what is so difficult about this sandwich? We got a two 9in sandwiches this time and the bobby was pathetic! I've seen more meat on a kids sandwich! Plus I asked for extra mayo, this sandwich was dry as hell.
Vibe of the store was very stiff. There was an entirely new staff working. Someone help this store get up and running to Cappriotti's standards! It's such a great location but we have decided that once our sandwich coupons are up (given from previous catastrophe) we will go to our usual location. I had such high hopes, unfortunately 2 out 3 visits sucked so you're fired!",vYxfOJqZCEYuf1Vh8hL02Q,1,0,3,7xkwlCPKEtJJqln2t38QDQ

4912598,2018-02-03,0,HNAH23RNUTTivzhebQTozw,"Ok, brand new place, less than a mile from our place. We love capriotti's, and eat there quite often. We have also been to many locations around the city.
This particular location has one major flaw. The food is excellent at all locations, including this one.
Unfortunately, this location is the only one that puts WAYYYYY less meat on their sandwiches.
I can't say this for sure, but I would assume it's because number 1) it just opened and 2) therefore, they stick to exactly the recommended amount of meat and toppings.
So in the defense of this location, they are really not doing anything wrong.
I gave it one star however, because it's not just a slight difference, it's huge.
If I had to guess, it's probably around 60-70% of the amount the other locations put on the sandwiches.
It's enough for us to make the extra 3 Mile drive to go to the next nearest location.
You can decide for yourself, because like I said, it's still a great sandwich.",QJSicvyv6_Vx-Z2wAGxfuw,1,0,1,4yWT4fKFu-MBWKeJcE7q9A
4916389,2018-06-23,0,HNAH23RNUTTivzhebQTozw,"We called up there to ask about their vegetarian menu and if they offered it vegan style as well. They do! We ordered a 20"" cheese steak without cheese and it is great! We called right and 9pm not realizing they were closing but the lady on the phone insisted they would keep the drive thru open for us. I got there 17 minutes later and she even let me add a drink. She was kind and it wasn't above and beyond to offer to keep the drive thru open for me. Thank you! 
We've been coming here since they opened and I'm never disappointed. This experience though was the best.",mnboKKyCM1okoO8se1eQrA,0,0,5,6f0GpfufKWAOthFwuVN-qg

The place is perfect for a business meeting or meet & greet date. They even have a NY Favorite -Wise Potato Chips!
