342424,2015-12-18,0,gNhxs9nPUSkVBSSIRQOgaA,"I can't even give this place a star. Not my first time eating Indian food. I'm from a very heavily populated Indian area back at home with many above standard dining options. This place did not fit the mold in the least. I ordered 2 dishes...Tandoori Chicken and Sheekh Kabob..the Tandoori Chicken was dry, not made to order and cold with a foul odor and taste. the Sheekh Kabob which was questionable as well and was in fact not a kabob. After 3 bites I knew this food was going to end up making me sick due to the fact that it was not fresh but rather food that had been sitting out for hours. The naan was also served cold and not included with our food when buzzed for pickup although it was already paid for. 

The service was worse than the food! When I ordered I received nothing but rude mannerisms from the cashier who failed to do her job efficiently and felt the need to express her frustration with the customers. No matter how polite I tried to be and I'm a very patient person,this cashier continued to be rude. After realizing the food was no good I immediately brought the food back to the counter and demanded a refund. The cashier explained she would need to get the manager..she returned moments later with no manager and stated there was no manager. When I demanded a refund for the full amount paid of $25 dollars she refused and proceeded to call mall security!!! She then moved the tip jar from the counter. I could care less about the tip jar but mall security!!!?!! Security explained I had to fill out a report and make a complaint to the corporate office via guest services. After doing so I have mixed feelings and do not feel I was treated fairly. I will not return to this mall either being that ceases palace is only a hop skip jump away with better shops and food court options. Beware!",vnv4mqDk6hUkCu9DRje9IQ,0,0,1,U-b6cBr3-W59a9xJjZcqiA

South Indian food is hard to find in the U.S., so whenever I do find it I am excited. Their dosa is very good, not the best I've had, but much better than you'd expect from a food court.

It is a cool concept too, sort of a full service restaurant meets food court where you order then they give you a buzzer and you wait about the time it would take to make your food had you been in a sit down place, so it is made fresh and tasty! 
I actually think it is a cool concept other places should/ could adopt.
The food was good but not as richly flavored as a few of my favorite Indian places, and I chose mild spice because it is usually still quite spicy, but here I think I would opt for Medium since the dish we got had no spice to it at all, but that is just a preference thing, sort of like how different brands of clothing fit differently. 
We got the butter chicken, my personal favorite Indian dish, and an order of their vegetable samosas. The Chicken was tasty and tender and their rice was good too. The samosas unlike the chicken were quite spicy, they were rich in flavor and served piping hot! They serve them with the two traditional dipping sauces, one a sweet tamarind sort of sauce and the other a green earthy tasting sauce. 
The naan we got with the meal was just okay, and sort of had a pretzel bread flavor to it I didn't care for. It was also thinner than most naan I have had before, and no real depth of flavor. 
Overall it was good, and certainly the best quality place in this food court, if I was in the mall and it was meal time I would likely consider ordering from here again.",p_6-Q9uAqn3i8NLjudkJ1A,0,0,4,hAE8Q1aioaBlGG3QcUgugQ

I had ordered Butter Paneer Masala with rice and naan... It was delicious! My wife and dad had Dosa...and my daughter had Chole Bhatuda... ALL GONE!  Their Chicken is also excellent.  

However, they can improve their Chicken 65 dish... it was little too dry...The best Chicken 65 I had was in Atlanta (next to The Patel Brothers...there is Indo-Chinese Fusion place).

None of less, the service and staff are very friendly and excellent.  One major improvement is now they have eBuzzer... so when your order is ready...the assigned buzzer  goes off... they dont scream/yell your name in speaker when your order is ready!

Naan is often weak at mall Indian restaurants, but is good here.
I found a whole Caradamom pod in (I think) my rice, which made me very happy. One of the indicators for me of good Indian food is the presence of these little flavour bombs. 
I've eaten at this place for a few years and don't vary my purchases much. Aloo Gobi (today) and Palak Paneer being my standard go-to items. 
Pleasant service, tasty food (on the mild side, but again at a mall in the US, to be expected), and a pretty large serving size (I struggled to eat it but I am on the smaller side).
I was irritated with them on the day before Memorial Day when they seriously shrank their menu, around 7pm but they have fully redeemed themselves.

1. They give you a buzzer while you wait for your food so you know exactly when it's ready to be picked up! The only place in that upstairs food court to do this. 

2. It's fast food, but doesn't really taste like fast food. It feels like you're eating a real lunch/dinner, rather than something super greasy or oily or slapped together quickly. 

Now, it's not the best Indian food that I've ever had, but it is fairly priced and they give you a good amount of food, too. 

One thing that I have to mention is that, while my chicken tikka did taste pretty good, it was very over-seasoned. While I don't exactly mind, other people might, so I suggest brushing the spices off or just letting them know--hey, this might be a litteeee overboard.
