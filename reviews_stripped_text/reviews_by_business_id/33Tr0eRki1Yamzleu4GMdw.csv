Eric had the chevre quiche which had potential but was not warned up enough and he was wishing there was some hot sauce to give it that kick he likes. 
We each ordered coffee,  his a double espresso which he enjoyed and I loved my hazelnut latte.  
We also shared a piece of walnut tart which was okay but I think that if it had been warm would be delicious,  another thing I'll ask for next time. 
It is a bit pricey as our meal cost $30 but for fresh made I think it's priced reasonably and we will certainly be back.",oisQ6O_uV70PhWLqaNhbIg,1,1,4,vDuJrm5TFRXZPqScTrdz4Q

833430,2016-08-13,0,33Tr0eRki1Yamzleu4GMdw,"I'll start by saying the food a Rosallie is wonderful, I've been there a few times and have recommended it to many friends based on the quality of their food.  They are usually a bit slow but last time was too much.  I live far from Rosallie, and it is because of the love of food I drive that far. 

I'm not one usually to complain about service but their service last time was inexcusable.  We ordered a coffee and a tea, the coffee arrived after 45 minute wait!  A coffee?  The tea never even came, even after asking about it twice after 30 minutes wait and being completely ignored by the girl working at the counter.  I noticed how she served the drinks of a table that arrived way past after us too. The food only partially arrived after 50 minute wait.  Even understanding that it was a Sunday at 11 am, they had only one guy working on the kitchen who was clearly overwhelmed and a girl taking the orders and serving.  The girl excused herself saying she was new, but that only shows a failure of management for not properly training their employees, why did she keep taking orders if she could not serve the customers she was taking orders from?  After having waited almost one hour, we had one food order to go and I cancelled the other food order, (it was the cheese plate which it would not have been ok to take out in the heat), the server assured me she would credit me for it--she never did, I was charged for food and drink I was never served.

961848,2017-10-23,0,33Tr0eRki1Yamzleu4GMdw,"I was so disappointed, and disgusted at the same time.  I wanted a latte and pastry.  I was shocked to find ants floating in my latte!  Once I realized what was there, I immediately returned to the counter, to only wait several minutes before i was noticed.  It nearly seemed to me that i was being ignored.  Once I was acknowledged, a gentleman wearing mascara and eye makeup happily greeted me.  The gentleman looked at me, and gave me a wink and seemed to me i was being visually stripped naked.  I told him what the issue occurred and my complaint was completely disregarded. , but I was told those ants were not from his establishment.  I have never been treated this way ever!  I will never return, nor will i ever recommend the place to anyone.
Please, anyone seeking a peaceful latte and pastry, save your time, energy, effort, and pass on by.

Later this morning, the very same gentleman called me a moron, and falsely accused me of me being a stalker!  I was merely seeking a snake and a boost of latte!  It frightens me how violent Jonathens behavior has become.  See photo below!",yl7rUydKnsTsvUMUTm2xaQ,0,0,1,QAiu0lZaBXJLt8U4s4XIpg
999626,2015-12-07,2,33Tr0eRki1Yamzleu4GMdw,"Here's why I give this place one star. I ordered three drinks. One crème brûlée latte, one hot chocolate, one black coffee and three croissants. The croissants were excellent. But the drinks... Let me tell you how awful these drinks were. The black coffee was watered down, completely undrinkable, the crème brûlée tasted like they burnt the espresso and the hot chocolate tasted like a cheap Hershey's chocolate bar melted in milk. Now the presentation of the hot chocolate was cool, they steam the milk and give you a cube of chocolate on a stick that you melt yourself in the hot milk, but this is definitely not worth $4.50 for THE SMALLEST CUP IN THE UNIVERSE! Disappointed with our drinks I thought we could tell the manger and see what they can do for us because I didn't want my money to go to waste. The register lady was very nice and said she appreciated the feedback and went and got the manger, or the owner, and so we told him what was going on and he just kind of stared at us like ""what do you want me to do for you"" type of way, we asked if we could get our money back and said ""no."" That's it's, just no. No apology or anything, didn't offer to give us anything else, didn't bother bother with good customer service at all! Horrible place!

The owner was rude when I talked to him about issues with the food. I wasn't even looking for anything to be re-made or my money back. I could tell that the execution was way off and just wanted to help him out. What a douche. Rosallie may stay in business or do alright since it's on Rainbow, but anyone who cares about food in general, much less French café items, would do better to move along to another spot--there are way too many good restaurants and beautiful cafés to waste your time here.",yw5hdX4yYX-QH0bqSNrxqw,3,2,1,TmOVdZqsxV3zzJQQSTCmeA
1033986,2016-12-28,0,33Tr0eRki1Yamzleu4GMdw,"This review is only on a sandwich no pastry- which look AMAZING! I ordered the mozzarella and prosciutto sandwich. It was decent. In my own opinion, I want to mostly taste prosciutto in a prosciutto sandwich. Here, there was a lot of cheese and tomato to overwhelm the flavor, which I love don't get me wrong but it was too much. The mozzarella was too salty and I like my prosciutto to be the saltiest thing on the sandwich. Again just my take on it. I just love taste of prosciutto and theirs was soooo good I wanted even more and for it to be the star of the dish.There was a great salad around the rim of the dish and the dressing was really good!! Actually, fantastic. I'd definitely eat it again. The employees were so sweet and I love the atmosphere. The father and daughter ahead of me in line were both so nice and gave me opinions on what to order, which was so sweet knowing they support and love this place! It is definitely a home-y place and that is what sold me on it. Also, I got a free coffee refill! YUM. I'm definitely coming back to try to duck because the only reason it did not get five stars is because of the salty mozzarella(well and long wait time)! Definitely give it a try if you're in the area. Be prepared to wait 30 minutes for a sandwich though. I didn't know that coming in so I was annoyed but if you know ahead of time it makes it better:)",3CKcPD3dM4SaD8tUKZ8E-Q,1,1,4,VleDjwzycBN-tXOTYxcbpQ

The man recommended their most popular quiche. I wish it was cheesier? The consistency of it was runny like an egg custard. I've never been to Paris, so I can't comment on if that's how it's supposed to be. But I've had quiche else where and it was definitely not like that. 

Lastly the charcuterie. $14.95 I got 4pcs of proscuitto, 4pcs of salami, 2 options of cheeses that tasted very basic, and few olives etc. to me, it was definitely overpriced for what it is. 

It was a cute place,  I liked the atmosphere, would probably be back when I see my dentist in the next plaza. Didn't try any desserts, hopefully the pastries are more impressive than the lunch menu.",dEiKPMxq8wCiGe-fgU0_OQ,0,0,3,buSur7vR8ROu12OGOENQhw

What I ended up with was slightly tinted water/milk combo that was delivered to me in less than two minutes. My point in telling you that - you have to STEEP the tea. It's part of the whole ""tea preparing process""... (uh, what happened to being 'authentic'?)  OK... so I won't get ""to go"" anything from there anymore except pastries.

Fresh crossiant. Flaky and buttery. Pretty good sized too. Wonder when they make it? Would be amazing to have a freshly baked croissant *_* 

Quiche Chevre Salade - Tomato, goat cheese, and spinach quiche on top of a spring salad. Egg is light and fluffy. I know quiche doesnt require flour for preparation, at least not in the egg portion but i cant seem to shake the feeling of some like ""undercooked flour texture/feeling"". Expected the quiche to have a little more flavor with the goat cheese and tomato to give some freshness but seemed mildly plain. At least overall, i felt it was healthy? XD

The other favorite for me is their Chocolate Almond Croissant.  Some of the filling spills out as it bakes making the edges something I love to eat last. Delicious!

The line could have been better organized we were just standing there shrugging our shoulders near the cash register wondering if someone was going to come over and charge us or if it was something you pay for at the end? After someone finally came over and rung us up we were handed plates to get some cheese. Good selection of cheeses offered here and the breads were good too. I came back recently for brunch with friends. Service started out good but then changed. When my order came I had a smaller drink than the menu described, I asked for a chocolate croissant and got a regular one, and there was no jam or butter on my plate as the menu stated comes with it. After saying something to the girl working I was quickly brought butter and jam but my croissant and drink didn't get corrected. The breads and jam were good I really liked that and the croissant was flaky and delicious. I do wish my order came as it was supposed to I had been looking forward to trying the much talked about chocolate croissant here for months. Guess I gotta keep waiting. Some others in our group had to wait a really long time for their orders which was just sandwiches and they did complain of the bread being hard. I guess the owner was out of town and of the only 2 people working... it turned out to be the girls first day. They could have said something when we first arrived since the brunch was planned in advance to just simply give us a heads up that they might have some hiccups. The menu has a bit of something for everyone but I have to admit I was surprised to not see a traditional croque monsieur or madame on the menu since pretty much that's what people would expect to find at a French cafe.

Running errands, getting things done, sleepy from working the night before. As I'm going from place to place, I browse through my Instagram to see a post that a new bakery/cafe was right down the street. I look on Yelp, it looked like they just opened yesterday. No pictures. Hmm. I look back on IG and see one of their Apple Crumble Pie. Whoa. I'm a sucker for crumble anything. Let's go, I said to myself, you need a break.

Quaint. Cute bright ambiance. Very much what I'd envision a corner cafe in France. The owner and girl behind the counter greeted as I scoped out their display. I mentioned the Apple Crumble Pie, since I didn't see it. Walnut Pie today instead as he just put out a limited batch for their first week of opening. Whaaat?!?! Bummer.

I love their tea display, all the leaves in small batches with a clear cylinder top which the owner said I could open. The cylinder captures the aroma of each batch, it smelled heavenly. 

I sat down with my Green Tea Passion Fruit and Almond Pie, took some pictures, and just relaxed. The tea was fruity and smoothing, the Almond Pie was light and buttery. I had to restrain and take most of it home. 

I'm sure they can put together a box of pastries and cup of coffee to go, but this isn't that type of place. It's one where you sit, sip your latte, chit chat with friends, and enjoy. We don't do that enough, or at least I don't. 

I wish I could give it 5 stars, being I'm FTR. Hopefully, I'll be able to the next time I visit, fingers crossed that they have that Apple Crumble Pie!",q9jCDNZDRUYl2Pwlgxocig,55,50,4,27-OWb-6W-4N4qPBuI5Zbg

Visually , this is the cutest cafe we have here in Vegas. I loved all of the French decorative touches & the very cozy and roomy atmosphere. There's plenty of natural lighting (perfect for photo ops !) and variety of areas for seating - they have wooden & white marbled tables , a lounge area w/ couches and even an outdoor patio. I'd love to come here on a sunny day or on a rainy day. Their music playlist is very nice too.

Soon as you walk in , you are greeted by their friendly staff. You order at the cash register and they bring everything right out to you :) They have beautiful glass displays of pastries (the croissants !!) , desserts , and quality loose leaf teas (so cute they have their tea leaf samples displayed on the counter under small glass domes). They even have homemade jams to buy & a wine cellar. For their menu , they have a decent selection of sandwiches , salads , soups , etc. So there's healthier alternatives as well as options for all your carb/sweet tooth needs.

Everything was presented lovely and the food was excellent ! I got their veggie quiche (8.70$). Quiche was very fluffy and delicious. It perfectly paired with the salad it came with. Keep in mind , their portion size is just enough to satisfy smaller stomachs.

I must comment how much I love their desserts too. I have been here just once so I only tried one of theirs but it really made a good impression on me because it's not overly sweet like American desserts. We shared their chocolate raspberry tart which was the right amount of sweetness and tartness. You must try their crème brûlée latte (3.75$ for a regular). Again , not too sweet and it's the perfect blend of caramel and coffee.

It is a little out of the way for me , but well worth the trip. It's right off the 215 Rainbow exit next to Jaburritos. One of the top places for breakfast/brunch , catching up with a few friends or even studying. They provide free wifi & have phone charging stations too.

Food: we both had the honey and lavender latte. It had a very nice flavor and I would have really enjoyed it - if it was hot. It was lukewarm. I ordered a small croissant and bread plate for my meal, which was all really good as well. My wife ordered a quiche, which was not cooked properly (under-cooked). 

Cost: I felt the cost was very reasonable for what we ordered.

Staff: The staff was very pleasant.

Cleanliness: Overall, it seemed fairly clean, however two incidents make me question that: 1) the person taking and handling money at the register stepped aside to show someone preparing the food what he meant by putting a paper between a plate and croissant. Three croissants, zero hand washing. 2) A couple at a table beside us asked for to go cups. They were brought over and one of the cups fell on the floor. Without hesitation, the server picked up the cup from the floor and put it on the table for the customer to use. 

As a side note, if anyone from Rosallie reads this, either add some acoustic panels or stop banging the $h*t out of everything you touch.

The ambiance is like the little cafes u would experience in Europe....very cozy...a little bigger then the ones there but it is very nice. :) the owner is French....It was kind of odd walking into a French Cafe in the US and hearing French coming from half the customers....lol

The menu was small but u can tell that alot of thought went into it to keep very French. 

I had the Tartlin Angelique....It was their special that they had by the register....It looked great and I couldn't resist...

It was DELICIOUS!!! I devoured it. :) the bread was perfect. They toasted it and it had the perfect amount of crunch with a chewy texture to compliment the hardboiled eggs and the fresh green mix on top of the toast. Delicious. I would definitely come back for this. :)

I also got a tea to drink with my meal....I got the earl grey and it came out in a French press....I love a good earl grey and this did not disappoint. It was DELICIOUS. 

Seriously everything about this meal was great. I can't wait to come back and try something else on the menu.  So glad to have another gem in the SW....yay!!!! :D

It feels barren inside as the decor at this place is very low budget & plain... There really is nothing here which feels warm, French & inviting. 

The girl who took our order was nice. The table was not clean & we had to wipe it off before sitting down. 

The coffee was not anything I would order again. My husband had the latte & it was tasteless & I had French Vanilla Latte & there was not any coffee taste, but there was some creamy vanilla.  Very little foam on top. There was a pretty heart type design. 

You order at the counter & they bring it to you. That's the service Level. No follow up, so it is much like a Fast Food place. Except the prices are more like a sit down restaurant. 

Lentil soup was bland & had no texture.  Would not recommend. It was served hot. 

Salad with quiche was tasty. Good dressing & they put on a nice quantity. 

Quiche Lorraine was hot & tasted pretty good. 

Quiche Chèvre (goat cheese) was smooth & bland. Not something I would order again. It was ok & came out hot. Crust was bland. I had to add salt to make it palatable.

Not just Croissants the assorts of Croissants least over four different ones. Too many for me try one time. I order the chocolate, almond, nuttella, and regular one with the special of the day sandwich ""Croque Bosali"". I did get piece of the almond one before hooked my boys at bike store with the assortment. It was good. Croissants the whole key for me. BUTTERY and FLAKY. If you fingers get butter moist each time grab it. Beautiful thing in life. The Croissants one of the things place is known for can understand the appeal. Winnah.

The sandwich was solid. The ham and cheese (forget the cheese but not your plain cheese put it that way) was prefect combination. The Croissant for the bread is divine. The little side salad ok nothing special just basic organic mix greens with some kind house balsamic vinaigrette and couple slices of fresh oranges on the side. Eye appeal this dish is far from. Really at the end of the day about the food presentation could careless. 

I really like the whole interior look definitely going for some of that Paris vibe from the artwork on the walls, the way they display all the Croissants in wicker baskets, signs each different pasty even the menu in chalkboard style, and the smell is great from the minute walk in. The prices reasonable I think for the pastries. Not that I go often to bakeries in general. Definitely great spot get some coffee, great book, and great fresh pastries. They also have little outside patio area that can chill at with friends. Service was awesome. It was my first time the lady was  helpful and gave great recommendations.

The people who work there are incredibly nice, but the service is dreadful.  The place is small, and usually crowded.  And because it takes so long to get your food, people park at their tables for hours.  Also, the entire order doesn't get served at the same time, or not even close.  You end up with people watching each other eat, like this is a new spectator sport.  And no matter how much you like your meal-mates, it gets awkward.  The first eater has the guilt of knowing the others are hungry and envious of your food.  The last eater has to rush, knowing that everyone else is dying to leave, having already chatted, waited, eaten and drank.

There's a section with lounge chairs, and another table area that's to itself (great for group with a window wall).
Bring headphone if you're studying in case there's a crowd like my current visit ( they're pretty loud being social and fun, but everything else is pretty calm )...
There's patio seating, and I don't see any umbrellas.

The counter area is filled with pastry options (They're huge too!) you don't normally see, like Meringue bags.

Ordered a fraisier for 20
Thé Fraisier was gorgeous, the Chef Pastry did such a beautiful detailed job! Chocolate butterflies, strawberries cut like little rose and added some sliced almond around the cake. BEAUTIFUL, gorgeous and Delicious!
If you order in advance you can talk to the Pastey Chef and he can bake anything you wish!!! Next time I will order a Napoleon!!!
Very pleased with the birthday cake, guest enjoyed it and we only left a slice for birthday girl breakfast (damned it lol)
It was light, flavorful. Feel like we were eating clouds of strawberries

 Tomorrow when you wake up you must try this French Bakery on Rainbow and Patrick (near 215)
the decor is very frenchy, cozy and well decorated.
Pastries are fresh and baked there!
I enjoy there selection of teas. 
instead of going get some pastries at Jean Philippe, try this great place outside the strip.
This morning I ordered some pastries for my office since it was Christmas! Team was all excited and devoured the croissant, apple turn over, chocolate croissant...

2880686,2016-06-02,4,33Tr0eRki1Yamzleu4GMdw,"I went here over the Memorial Day weekend and was very happy to see another French cafe pop up on the Westside. We had just eaten at Baguette Cafe the day before (still one of my favorite spots), so I tried to replicate my usual order at Rosallie to compare. I got their Quiche Lorraine, which was not as bacon-y as Baguette Cafe's, but came with a generous portion of salad and featured very fluffy eggs. Not too much actual bacon in the piece we got, so I might opt for a different quiche in the future. My husband devoured his Nord sandwich (smoked salmon, cucumber, sweet onions and capers, but I was able to sneak in a bite or two and loved it as well. The salmon portion and the salad portion again was very  generous with this order. The bread paired so well with all the other ingredients and was at the right temperature to enjoy the sandwich. My husband was still thinking about how delicious it was the next day. We ordered a cup of the French Onion Soup, which I would not get in the future - watery and lacking in cheese, definitely not the hearty and rich bowls of soup I'm used to seeing, but good if you did need something milder in flavor. The Nutella croissant was a big highlight for me and so hard not to devour before the rest of my food actually came. Nutella is drizzled on the outside and there's so much oozing from the inside within the perfectly flaky croissant crust. I'm not a big coffee drinker, so I opted for the peach iced tea, which I will pass on in the future. They had a hot chocolate though that I'm curious about for next time. 

The restaurant itself was very spacious, the cashier assisting us was very friendly, and the owner checked in on every table that was there. As others have mentioned, signage says ""Le French Cafe"" instead of ""Rosallie"" so it's easy to miss. If you find yourself at Jaburritos, definitely pop into this place and pick up a pastry for dessert!",Y8adrWFzckrjuC11aAs9Og,6,7,4,qPTIxXDeSaoVr4A2uxsjIg

For the cost you get two wine tastings and all the cheese types you want, pick your own breads and crackers & fruit (grapes).  The tasting is about 1/3 glass full.  You can order a bottle or full glass if you wish.

After trying to be a connoisseur, and chatting up or listening to funny and great stories, you may start feeling full.  Those carbs do their expansion thing in the bellies pretty good.

Food for thought: Why in the world do the best tasting cheeses stink like heck though?  Swish with wine and don't talk directly at someone :P

Nice thing about the space in Rosalie is the cafe environment.  Yeah a bookshelf and comfy corner is in there.  But for big groups of 8-10 it's easy to pull tables and chairs together for a family gathering feel.

I recommend the tastings.  Keep a watch out for their postings on their tasting events.",JQIZhoQB-Tg9hdBEj90m4g,42,37,4,7gowVLfXxnTcI7Ox_Vy7qg

I wish they had a bigger selection of pastries though. They have 2-3 tarts which didn't look too appealing and a handful of other things. I need more goodies to choose from! 

The only reason I'm not giving the full 5 starts which they completely deserve is because twice I've been overcharged for my order. Today I finally realized it was around $9.4 for my drink and croissant which didn't add up to the prices on the board--but it was the same amount I was charged the week prior. They reversed the charge and after calculating with tax, I still don't think I was charged correctly. I'm going to come back when I'm in the area, but will make sure to pull out my calculator when checking out.",dLoUSe9E25agXphQjx8Svg,2,1,4,hENP-qW-3nl2MpUBdmPpTA

3519587,2017-08-17,39,33Tr0eRki1Yamzleu4GMdw,"I first visited Rosallie for a Cheese and Wine Event they were having. It was $26 per person and we got 2 glasses of wine each, a plate with a variety of cheeses on it as well different breads and some grapes. I came with a group of friends and we all enjoyed learning about the different types of cheeses that the owner, Jonathan, had on display and plated for us. Staff here is very friendly and inside is spacious enough to accommodate small and large groups. I arrange brunch often with a group of friends and since I enjoyed the Cheese and Wine Event, I decided to choose Rosallie for our next brunch meet up. 

Jose was great about reserving and pushing tables together to accommodate our brunch. For the most part everyone enjoyed their food with the only complaints being from a few who got some of the sandwiches and felt the bread was too hard. Some commented that they have had the sandwiches before from here and it was softer and that the bread appeared to be a different kind than they had on previous visits. All of our orders came out quick except for the last few, which sat behind the counter plated for far too long. I personally went to the counter and asked Jose if those plates were for people in my group and he said ""yes it's coming right out"" so I went back and told the people waiting what he said. Several minutes later the food still hadn't arrived, so I got up again to ask what was going on and noticed the plates of food still just sitting there. At this point I said ""I can deliver these plates if it means they get their order"" and he quickly picked up the plates and brought them to our table. I believe he meant well, but with a new girl working who was having all of us point out what we wanted from the paper menu because she wasn't familiar with the menu items, it seemed to leave him trying to pick up the slack. This is a known popular spot, especially on Sundays, so having the right amount of knowledgeable/dependable staff is important.

Macarons ($12 for a dozen) - I'm not a huge fan of these in general, but I know others love them (shout out to Rohlin A.!) so I figured they would be nice to put on the table for my guests to snack on. They seemed to be well liked by everyone with some people going back to try other flavors. 

White Truffle Latte ($5.50 large) - The latte art was super cute, but the flavor was a bit too intense and not even lightly sweet like I'd hoped from the white chocolate. Wouldn't personally order the white truffle latte again. I also had a Hot Chocolate ($4.60 large) and it was delicious and chocolaty!  

Petit Déjeuner ($9.99) - Toasted French Bread, Butter, Homemade Jams and your choice of a Croissant or Chocolate Croissant with Orange Juice and any large drink of your choice. Yes, you get 2 drinks with this one. This is a very fair price for what you get, if you get the order correctly. I picked a chocolate croissant and got a regular one, so that was a bummer. Also the menu says you can choose any large drink, so I ordered a hot chocolate since the first one was so good except this time it was a smaller size than the first one. Not a huge deal, but getting the order right and serving what the menu describes should happen. Croissant, bread and jams were very tasty. 

Croque Rosallie ($8.30) - Paris Ham, Sweet Onion Bechamel and Mozzarella Cheese on a Croissant. This tasted so good! I shared half with hubby and didn't like doing so because I wanted to eat the whole thing myself it was that good. I'd for sure order this again and recommend others try it.

We had a Brie and pesto sandwich, a prosciutto and mozzarella sandwich and a ham and cheese croissant. They were all served with salad with teardrop tomatoes, shredded carrots and a yummy balsamic vinaigrette. There was no shortage of greens. The sandwiches were piled high with greens as well. Both sandwiches were delicious and served on fresh baked bread. The prosciutto and mozzarella with peppers was slightly superior. It had a little more balance. The Brie sandwich was tasty...rich and stinky with lots of melty Brie.  They were both a mess and absolutely impossible to eat without looking like a savage. 

The menu is simple but sufficient. There's 4-5 sandwiches, 3 salads, quiche, soup and of course goodies. I had a scrumptious hazelnut praline latte. It was not too sweet and, of course, had a pretty heart in the inch of rich foam. 

The food took longer than necessary to come out. But, again, they were busy. It's cute inside for sure. There's more seating than your average French bakery.

I scraped the burnt part off the top, the remainder was very good, the crust and eggs adequate. I spoke with two of the employees about the dish being burned and they just ""blew me off"" one actually said that it HAD to be burned so the middle would be done??? Ludicrous! No apology or offering to make it right. They do have great lattes, with very artful designs and very tasty! As we sat and stayed for quite a long time because we were celebrating a birthday, the smell of burning food was very pervasive! That was a constant smell all the time that we were there.

4045288,2016-12-01,3,33Tr0eRki1Yamzleu4GMdw,"I read somewhere that Rosallie had the best macarons in town, so we set off for the west side to judge for ourselves. First off, it's a lot more than JUST a bakery. Rosallie has a full menu of salads, sandwiches, and French cafe-type things like quiche. They also do wine by the glass, and selection seemed above average at a quick glance. 
The ambiance is cute, and they've managed to make it cozier than its strip mall location suggests, including a free phone charging station, wifi, and lots of books. Prices were pretty high for desserts, but I kinda expected that: ~$1 each for the mini macarons or medium sized sugar cookies. 

Most important: the macarons are delicious. We most enjoyed the caramel and pistachio, but lemon and raspberry were also delicious. 

My complaints: macarons are only available in a multi pack of 12, including 2 chocolate, which we really didn't like at all. It would be great to be able to buy singles or at least set our own variety. Second, while they have a wide selection of loose teas, they don't really have any specialty tea drinks.

4108208,2017-08-19,4,33Tr0eRki1Yamzleu4GMdw,"[UPDATE 8/20/17: The owner did see this; I received a private message. I stand by my praise of various foods in this and prior reviews and my criticism of the service on this particular day. I will return and hope for a positive experience so that I can write a better review then, but I won't change my rating as of this time.]

Look, it's plain and simple. They fucked up.

I'm usually not so harsh on my ratings or reviews, but I think my dining companions were being far too generous to Rosallie based on their experiences, so I'm willing to drop the hammer with the justification that yes, ""I've experienced better."" I have little sympathy when two employees look at the register and at the pastry case and then enter the wrong order in, which cost less and probably tasted worse than the item which I'd intended to order, so I'm not mincing words. (To be fair, it doesn't appear that the business owners use Yelp, but I still want to make sure that we're collectively making enough noise to be heard.)

For what it's worth, the food is quite good when they get it right. I've made a fair amount of visits without really bothering to update my review because my rating hadn't changed much, but I recall such pastries as the Madeleine ($1.50 last I checked) and Pumpkin Cannoli ($3.50, maybe seasonal) being quite delicious, and the Canelé ($1.75) was pretty good if a little small. The Croque Rosallie ($7.90 then, reportedly now $8.30) was also a very strong breakfast sandwich when I had it last year, with a ham, onion, and mozzarella in a halved croissant, plus a fresh salad with a nice dressing and some delicious sliced oranges served as the garnish.

On my visit last weekend, I also highly enjoyed the Normandie Tartine ($9.20), which is more of a layered dough flatbread than an open-faced sandwich here. The Normandie in particular has Brie, onion, and tomato, with a small side salad and a little bowl with additional tomato.

It was pretty obvious that they were struggling with the huge crowd though, and the lack of knowledge of the food / register caused them to ring me up for an Opera cake ($4.90) rather than a passion fruit cake ($4.10) that I'd seen in the case. I didn't look at my receipt until after receiving my cake because I'd assumed that they'd gotten it right after taking their time, but they didn't, and I sighed and ate the cake anyway because it would've gone to waste otherwise. It's not a bad cake, with plenty of chocolate and coffee flavor, although I wasn't a fan of the ground nuts in one of the layers. It wasn't especially memorable in flavor intensity or sweetness though.

The double-shot espresso ($2.50) tasted fine and had sufficient caffeine, but it wasn't served piping hot. I found that odd at the time but shrugged and enjoyed not burning my tongue. I don't think that's how it's supposed to be presented though...

Thanks to Christie L. for letting me try a Chocolate Macaron (part of a $12/12 pc. tray). It's smaller than typical macarons and didn't have all that much chocolate flavor, but the textures were fine. However, I would rather save my macaron investment for a place with unique flavors, like Suzuya.

And for that matter, I'm able to get much more stunning and properly identified savory and sweet food at places like Cafe Breizh, or the various patisseries on the Strip. They know what they're doing.

Would I come back to Rosallie? Yes, probably. I'll have to watch everything like a hawk though and I sure as heck won't show up for a Sunday brunch (unless Christie organizes it again, then I'd say yes). They were fine when I visited at times during which they weren't so busy.

Arriving at the Rainbow Boulevard and Patrick Lane intersection at a small unsuspecting plaza next to Jabburitos is a quaint french brunch cafe called Rosallie. Upon entering, a look on your right and you'll see an array of shapely wooden and white marble tables. To your left are the baristas, dessert displays, tea leaves, and cursive scribbles from their chalk board wall menu. There you have it: a comfortably simple, Southern French atmosphere. Almost nine times out of ten I am greeted by a friendly barista. After placing an order, towards the back you'll notice a small sitting area with couches, more marble round tables, a charge station, and a large shelf of books for you to immerse yourself in. There is also a small see through wine cabinet called La Cave for the wine lovers out there who want their daily fix.

I always drop by for their 'Nord' in salad form instead of sandwich, sans the sweet red onions. You get a mix of the usual spring veggies, spinach, capers, sliced baby tomatoes, mandoline sliced cucumbers, carrots, topped with smoked salmon. The dressing they have on it can sometimes be salty (and somewhat sweet/citrusy?) so a request for them to keep it on the low is highly recommended if its too strong for your tastebuds. 

Oh and let's not forget their creme brûlée latte here. I quite like it; the aroma after a having a whiff of the whip always makes me happy because I honestly believe I'm sniffing a confectionary. I take a few sips of it, and the flavor is smooth, creamy, and slightly buttery but satisfying. Call me ridiculous but if they ever add strawberry or blueberry fruits next to it (or even in it), my insides would leap with joy. 

Their charcuterie isn't bad, but neither is it overtly delicious. The prosciutto was a bit dry and some cold cut meats were either salty or too chewy. A suggestion would be to add an array of cheese that best compliments the meats. Other than that I wouldn't really bat an eyelash for this and settle for a pastry instead. 

I'm a bit taken aback that I have yet to try their soups, teas, and desserts (I have a guilty sweet tooth, oh dear...), but I'll try them eventually! Apart from that, whenever I just can't be bothered to make my own, Rosallie tops for my early morning salad cravings.",pHk6gWq3gFPNG0smjd9cRQ,30,24,5,UU1m3jTfESoQrnSMSd15vg

The coffee and tea menu offers a nice variety of options. Tea flavors are nicely displayed on the counter and coffees are listed out on the menu over the register. The latte menu has some special flavors for those with a sweet tooth. I went for the Crème Brulee Latte and enjoyed it very much.

The baked goods all looked for very good, but I used self control and narrowed to two items. The Pistachio Macaron had a great flavor and texture. It was the perfect size for a sweet bite with my latte. The Almond Tart had a nice flaky crust and a well flavored almond taste inside of the tart. I enjoyed both of the baked goods very much.

I'll definitely be back for breakfast or lunch. Who can pass on quiche?",3nIuSCZk5f_2WWYMLN7h3w,8,3,4,OTucO8P1D6il-FD3-SOCSQ

It's simple and spacious (maybe even a little too bare and spacious). I got a few  macaroons and a tried their la madeleine cookie as well as the duck confit sandwich. The sandwich is a bit overpriced at above $12 and to be honest, it was not very good. The duck was kinda cold and dry and there wasn't much of it.  The sweets fared better. The macaroons, though small, were pretty good and reasonably priced at $1.10. I really liked the la madeleine cookie as well. Will probably be back to try some other pastries and maybe give the cheaper sandwiches a try, they are after all conveniently located close by...",ZKwO9lkpAnOnQlBL1fXf1w,1,2,3,L2WwUprGfJNb3_Q1EtAVDw

Visually, Rosallie is the most adorable cafe. Clean & cute. But, beyond that it is an authentic French experience smack in the middle of Sin City.

I can't recall a time where a dining experience was SO beautiful & SO delicious that I teared up over it. But, at Rosallie, it happened. It was as if all of the stuff of my foodie dreams had magically come to fruition in one perfect moment...wine, cheese, bread, quiche, walnut tart, fig jam, honey, candied pecans, blackcurrant cocktails, macaroons. Every single bite was better than the last.

Jonathan's service and attention to detail was flawless. It is clear that he is passionate and knowledgeable about French cuisine. It showed in every aspect of our meal and it made our experience truly spectacular.

On occasion, I am impressed enough my a restaurant to where I know I will be back. But, almost never do I plan my next 2 visits before I leave or even finish my meal. I already can't wait to go back. I want to try every single thing on the menu.

4542249,2018-02-21,0,33Tr0eRki1Yamzleu4GMdw,"I had the pleasure of trying out this cute little french cafe this past Sunday. It did not disappoint! I had the Nord which was a smoked salmon sandwich garnished with a nice salad around it with a balsamic-esque dressing. I was torn between ordering the Nord and the Sud (a prosciutto sandwich) but the lady at the counter recommended the Nord. It was filling and light at the same time, with lots of flavor. They gave you an ample amount of smoke salmon and it had kind of a slaw type garnishing in it. I can't really explain the taste but it complemented the salmon really well. It sort of reminded me of a chipotle mayo slaw. 

I also ordered their chocolate mousse brownie. It was very, very rich! It's definitely something I recommend you share with someone and also offset the sweetness with their amazing rose latte. It definitely balanced it out! I'm sure any of their lattes or coffees would compliment the chocolate mousse brownie but the Rose latte was perfection. 

What I loved most was that Rosalie had this private little area off to the side with a few tables and some reading chairs to enjoy your coffee or pastry. It was nicely decorated and cozy which went with the french cafe theme. They have real marble tables which are perfect for taking that IG worthy photo of your meal/dessert/latte. They offered a lot of different varieties of desserts and baked goods as well as tea. So there's a little something for everyone.

I think they are still modeling the place because I heard some drills walking into the place.  When we walked in it was very open and welcoming.  I was drawn in my the itty bitty macaroons, costing $1.10 a pop.  Pass.....

We ordered the Ouest $12.90 and the Country plate also $12.90.  So for this price, I'm expecting a lot.  As I am looking around at everyone else's plate, I think I have already set myself up for disappointment.

There was myself and my infant daughter, so the only place we could sit was a table that had not yet been cleaned.  I had to request for the plates to be cleared for us to eat.  There were only 2 people working at the time, but its not like I would expect more for a little cafe.

4702490,2017-07-20,2,33Tr0eRki1Yamzleu4GMdw,"Many visits later, Rosallie is one of my favorite places in town!

My favorite eats:
+ Nord Sandwich with smoked salmon, red onion, tomato, cucumber, capers, mixed greens, and housemade shallot spread on toasted Petite Tourte.
+ Tartine L'Americaine with hardwood smoked honey-cured bacon, cheese, and egg yolk; served with marinated cherry tomatoes.
+ Tartine L'espagnole with housemade tomato sauce, rotisserie chipotle chicken, red onion, and mozzarella.
+ Tartine La Reine with dried paris ham, mushroom, and cheese.
+ Quiche Veggie with roasted zucchini, sautéed mushroom, and sautéed onion; served with side salad.
+ Croque Rosallie: Paris ham, sweet onion béchamel, and mozzarella on croissant.

Basically all the Tartines are phenomenal; I love the flaky pastry crust and the combinations are amazing. The quiches are equally delicious and I've enjoyed all of them as well. I've just begun to venture into the sandwich offerings, but I was blown away by the Nord! The housemade shallot spread is insanely flavorful and works so well with the salmon and fresh vegetables. I love ordering a couple entrees along with a couple pastries to share with a friend or even to enjoy on my own and taking the rest home.

Favorite beverages:
+ Latte Provence (lavender and honey)
+ Crème Brûlée Latte
+ White Chocolate Coconut Latte
+ Kir Royale

All of the special latte flavors are tasty and fun. I've really taken to the Latte Provence with its perfect balance of sweet and just a tad floral. With their new wine offerings, I've had the chance to try the Kir Royale and it is wonderful!

Favorite pastries:
+ Palmier
+ Almond Croissant
+ Croissant
+ Fruit Tart
+ Macarons

The desserts are fantastic, but I'm really a fan of the breads and pastries offered. The palmiers are fantastically crispy and buttery. Also, you can't go wrong with their croissants. The macarons are great, too and I had the absolute pleasure of their delicious Pistachio and Vanilla Macarons as party favors for my last birthday.

Rosallie for me is like stepping into a home away from home.

Samba music from the likes of Bebel Gilberto surround your thoughts. Wait a second. Where am I?

The little pastries are made by him, displayed nicely on the counter or in the pastry case.
Also, there are samples of tea leaves displayed on the counter under little glass domes. I never ordered tea, but  I tried their coffee.
I love hazelnut cappuccino or latte, so I ordered it.
I don't know if the coffee is not strong enough or just too much milk added to it, but it is not the best coffee I ever had. It tasted like milk. 
The chocolate croissant  is very light, good flavor.
It's much smaller size than you can find at other places. Probably I could easily eaten two of them.
The almond croissant was a little bit dry. I am sure it was just a coincidence.
The macaroons were delicious! I bought the little box containing 12 varieties of macaroons ($12.99)

I tried one of the breakfast item at one time: Quiche Lorraine (bacon) with organic greens on the side.

Only thing I'm not a fan of are the hours. 7am - 6pm. I work a 9am-5am job, and I would LOVE to hang out here after work and have a cup of their magnificent Crème Brule! It's always my go to drink. Delicious and savory. That with a piece of their Madeleine. So yummy! 

I've also tried both of their quiche, and you wont be disappointed! It looks a little bit burnt on top, but there's no burnt taste or anything. Promise! I get them a lot. Also, try out their sandwiches! 

My two favorites: 

Quest, which is duck with their home made onion jam and butter. Scrumptious! So much flavor and so their breads are always soft! FRIKKIN YUM, MAN! 

Nord, the smoked salmon sandwich goodness! Very delectable and you can never go wrong when it comes to salmon! Their home made jam must be it too! I about cried when I took a bite of this. 

With those sandwiches, they do drown it with a generous amount of salad. All that color in one plates make it look so beautiful! 

I have also had their desserts. Macaroons, Opera, tiramisu, and parfait. All were amazing. I know I sound vague, but I'm usually not a fan or all of those and  I gobbled it all up when I did have them.

It's a cute little café but the food definitely is their biggest charm. Everything I've tried, from their Almond, Chocolate and butter Croissants to their Madeleine's and Canele's have been outstanding but I'd have to say my favorite here is the Nord Sandwich. Smoked Salmon, red onions, cucumber and capers with homemade spread on a pretzel roll made in house. Oh myyyy! My head is spinning just thinking about all the deliciousness in one bite, perfectly pairs with the side salad it comes with.

Also note worthy are their latte's and specialty drinks. There are a lot of varieties they offer and seems like the list gets longer every time I come in. Drinks that will surely appease the coffee fanatics and comes with fancy latte art to boot! C'mon, tell me a Nutella S'mores latte does not stop you in your tracks?!?! You had me at Nutella!

I've been here quite a few times and these are the things I've tried:
The Nord sandwich is popular which consists of smoked salmon, capers, sweet onion and cucumber it was simply fabulous and healthy.  
The Quiches are light, fluffy and delicious. 
The Gazpacho soup is awesome, i can eat this everyday!

He was so pleased, he explained to me in detail how the name Rosallie came about, it was the name of the landowner who sold the farm house from his homeland Southern France.
The name brought luck to his parents, so that's why he named the cafe Rosallie.  
Conversations like that is why I comeback to his cafe, I just like meeting great people!

5279784,2018-05-03,3,33Tr0eRki1Yamzleu4GMdw,"With Jonathan Pluvinet still occupied expanding his brand in Winter Garden it is under the direction of former Aria and Jean-Philippe Baker Christophe that Rosallie has continued to improve in 2018, several additions to the décor and a whole bunch of new Pastries showing that the man responsible for Jean Georges Steakhouse's outstanding Brioche shares both the skills and sensibilities of his fellow countryman.

Quickly approaching anniversary number three and still doing good business despite finally-resolved construction and a location almost entirely devoid of foot traffic, the former 7-Eleven even more attractive than ever with hand-painted signage plus natural elements atop dividers, it was just moments before the Café's 7am opening that Christophe and staff were found putting the finishing touches on Tuesday's lineup, two pre-ordered boxes already packed and ready to go with a Sandwich quickly assembled and the whole interaction completed in less than five minutes en route to work.

A heavier load than one might expect, the amount of Butter folded into Rosallie's Viennoiseries and Tart Shells never in question but magnified by several items made of Chocolate, it was immediately upon arrival to an office only eight minutes away that the degustation began with an upgraded Est tucked into a Whole Wheat Roll; the Brie, Vegetables and housemade Pesto only improved by good quality Prosciutto given a minute in the oven to both toast the bread and melt the creamy Cheese.

Not a job for late-risers, the baking beginning several hours before sunrise and yielding some three-dozen items daily, it was seeking out those still-warm that quickly identified both an Almond and Nutella Croissant, the former still a personal pick for the best found stateside thanks to its hand-ground filling, flaky exterior and overall structure while the later would probably make a Parisian cringe, though after a bite it is likely they too would deem it delicious.  

Enjoying the goods over nearly eight hours, fresh Raspberries and housemade Jam highlighting  several, it was also prior to fully cooling that Christophe's new Raspberry Almond Croissant added a whole new dimension to Jonathan's base without compromising the texture one bit, the sweetness remaining natural while a follow-up $3.90 Cinnamon Roll immediately created mental conflict as to whether this or CRAFTkitchen was better thanks both its wispy interior and largely-unsweetened Cream Cheese Frosting that allowed tanginess a welcome opportunity to shine. 

Bringing back half-dipped Madelines and adding a Macaroon, the Dark Chocolate's quality immediately evident and personally felt to be better around densely packed Coconut, it seems as though Rosallie's Choux has received an upgrade recently as an Éclair marrying Nutella's ingredients broke cleanly despite being entirely covered in Chocolate, the dish best suited for a fork and knife as too is the triple- Chocolate Brownie thanks to mirrored Ganache and a dense, fudgy base. 

Finding good use for leftover Egg Whites in soft-centered Meringue, a perfume of Almonds released by each bite as crumbles fall to the floor, those seeking additional 'lighter' options would do well to order one of Rosallie's Lemon Raspberry Tarts or a slice of Apple Pie, though if actual 'weight' is more a concern one would be hard pressed to find Cake with less heft than the layers Jon and Christophe have stacked below and above airy Chocolate Mousse.

Nearly as fond of the Walnut Pie as Le French Café's Almond Croissant for similar reasons of authenticity, the Nutella Almond Pie likewise mirroring thoughts regarding their Croissant layered in America's favorite Italian Spread, it was saving the three heaviest items for last that the tasting came to a conclusion, both the thick Chocolate Mousse Cake and buttery Tart filled with Ganache seeing their richness mellowed by Fruit while the layered Opera tasted a lot like Tiramisu, but with a lot more variance in texture.

***** In many ways the unlikely inspiration for at least three additional French Bakeries sprouted since, the irony of Jean-Philippe's closure not wasted on those paying attention as only Thomas Keller's Bouchon remains as any sort of competition on-Strip, Rosallie continues to shine even as Jonathan looks towards further expansion and with Christophe's passion and pedigree it seems like even more great things are likely soon to come.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,13,7,5,YgOFjCliX1aDf1QEBiSprg

For our first trip, we tried their almond croissant, crème brulee latte, and an éclair that strangely reminds me of the Chinese pineapple bun pastry. The almond croissant was beautifully made -- buttery, flakey, and sweet. However, it is a little too sweet for my taste buds so I would probably recommend getting some coffee or tea with it. The crème brulee latte was pretty average for me. Perhaps it's because everything is sweet so the coffee just blended in with everything else. The éclair was fantastic. They had three different type of fillings: vanilla, caramel, or chocolate. We got the vanilla filled and it was really yummy. It was definitely on the sweeter side as well.

On our second visit, we got the same vanilla filled éclair. Instead of an almond croissant, we opted in for a regular croissant -- I do believe that it is better than the almond version just because it is not sweet at all. We also grabbed an Ouest (West) sandwich, which consisted of duck confit, sweet onion jam, and tomato. I have to be honest -- the sandwich didn't blow me away. It was just another sandwich to me .. and it was flooded with greens -- not that it's a bad thing. Or maybe I just can't appreciate a French sandwich!?!

Rosallie is a very cute place. It's very cozy and carries a warm atmosphere. If you want a place to just have some snacks, coffee, tea, etc with some friends, definitely consider Rosallie. The location is very convenient as it is off the 215 Rainbow exit.

I am posting this here because I believe in transparency and I believe Yelpers should understand who the owner is.

I am surprised at the owner's reaction considering his ""professional"" background. I don't think he handles criticism well, or maybe the stress from running his own business has made him too quick to react rather than to hear what is said.

For those of you that haven't been here - I suggest going when you have a little time to spare. Crème brulé coffee is a must!! A little sweet but if you like coffee
.... and crème brulé.... you ought to love yourself and drink one. 

The croque Rosalie was great as well! But I'll definitely be coming back just for that coffee, some macaroons/pastries, and some pleasant reflection time without my cell phone.

5517556,2017-08-17,3,33Tr0eRki1Yamzleu4GMdw,"First time in review. It's a cute place. It is. Annnnd the pastries are all so beautiful and appealing. So if you ask me will I ever return? YES! I would love to give their pastries my attention, and perhaps try something else...BUT never again their sandwich. Why? 
The buns they use is way too thick. 

The hubs and I met up with a group of other foodies for brunch. I've had this place bookmarked forever, but coming from the north we've never been able to make it just because of time constraints and opportunity. Opportunity and time wasn't a problem this day...and so we arrived. 

Back to food. You stand in line, order, get a number, and have a seat at whatever table suits your interest given its availability. I felt like I was standing in line forever with 3 people ahead, but then again...hunger was real so idk which part of me was doing the thinking. We finally order and I tell the cashier what I wanted, and she then asks me to show her which one off the menu. ::crickets::. So I opened the menu and pointed it off to her. A Nord, an Est, and may you throw in a jam danish. Off to our seats we went.

Then we waited. And waited. Those that were there sooner than us got their meals, finished it, and even had to go. Kinda awkwardly waiting. But I was patiently okay! I was out sans the kids, socializing...im good! But we waited. It got to the point where one person in the group walked up to check on our dishes to find they were just sitting waiting to get picked up and served. 

The sandwiches proved to have been waiting because the buns used were fricking hard. People, I couldn't even slice through it with my butter knife without my bun shifting and cracking. So I knew cutting through it wasn't going to work. Not only was it hard, I couldn't even get my mouth to grip on that thing. Quite frankly, there seemed to have been more bun than ""nord"".  Refer to pictures to get a better understanding of what we were served. 

On top of that, I feel like I got served a plate full of spring mix. I ate my sandwich open faced, but didn't eat the bottom half. Someone joked about my food being rabbit food because it was just a plate of greens. My husband's sandwich looked almost worst than mine. His looked overly toasted, burnt...whichever. Again, refer to pictures. 

But I made it through whatever I could and my husband out of upbringing...finished his despite the woes. The jam danish was the best part of our meal, it was beautiful to look at...but it ended up tasting basic. It was flaky in a stale way. Sigh, if that makes sense. I just felt like everyone I know who has been here ten million times has such a great rave for it...but first impression--disappointing.

I certainly wouldn't mind trying other things on their menu. What i do know for sure is I'll never order a sandwich from there again...id rather opt for something else. I won't count them out...just not a place I'd drive across the city for. Gatherings and what not...sure why not. 

Definitely kid and stroller friendly if bringing the kids. I'd say leave the kids though. Might catch a better vibe over a pastry and latte without 'em.

Enjoy!",MC0aQHT7mQ1WJknOD6u8pg,5,3,3,DVzdPAlW-DPO3Zzmxh7a6g

Dimmed lights, blinds turned up, and the sweet, sad notes of ""Careless Whisper"" blaring from my speakers on repeat start sounding like ""Carbless Whisper"" around the 25th time as I attempt to kill myself with a plastic knife.

Fortunately, Rosallie offers the carbs worthy of getting me out of any kind of funk.  The plain croissant is so simple, yet so awesome.  I cherish the slightly crispy and crunchy ends while the middle of it is borderline pornobutterography in my mouth.

5534226,2017-03-30,0,33Tr0eRki1Yamzleu4GMdw,"Super disappointed with my first experience here, but let me mention the positives first:

- Great atmosphere
- The food was really good

My disappointment stems from ordering a decaf iced americano. I asked the person if they could make their drinks decaf and she said that they could so I ordered it. I have a sensitivity to caffeine that is heart related - especially to the caffeine content of coffee - so I always order my drinks decaffeinated. Anyway, I got my drink first so I started drinking it and noticed after about 5 minutes that my heart rate had increased dramatically. I wear a heart monitor and it jumped over 30 beats. I knew that the drink had caffeine in it. 
By that time, I had gotten my food so I decided to eat and not drink any more of the coffee. The food was great, by the way. When I was on my way out, I went to the person who had taken my order and made my drink and told her about my sensitivity and that I didn't think the drink was decaf. She was adamant that she used decaf to make it, but the reaction I had to it makes me question that. I have never had the same type of reaction to decaf - I only get this reaction if I accidentally ingest caffeine. There were other customers around so I didn't want to argue or cause a scene. I just wanted it to be remade as decaf, but that wasn't offered. She did offer herbal tea or a refund, but I wasn't looking for either of those so I left.

It's almost as if whoever decorated this place tried a little too hard and may have never visited Paris, but I could be wrong. Regardless, the food was great and I didn't really care much about the decor and ambiance because I came hungry. 

What I ordered:
-Ham and cheese croissant: warm, light and fluffy with a small side salad with oil/balsamic vinegar dressing ($6.90). I would order this again. It's not greasy and heavy like most ham and cheese croissants, nothing like the ones at donut shops. 

-Country Plate: comes with a little bit of everything. Reminds me of a European breakfast and it looks exactly how it does in the menu photo. (12.90)

-black coffee: ok, a little on the bitter side

Service was decent, no complaints. You order and pay at the register and a gal brings you your order to the table.

This time we decided we'd also try the sud since it has prosciutto and my friend really loves that stuff. We split both sandwiches so we could compare which was better. I also decided to get the americano coffee which was pretty tasty. The Nord was delicious as always and I love how they also provide a salad with the sandwich. The sud was too salty for me so I ended up leaving half of the half sandwich I was given by my friend. Later on we actually also tried the peach green tea and that was really good. 

Overall, we enjoy this place and the fact that we can go there to get some work done is great. They do provide free wifi like Starbucks which is great, but isn't so busy as a star bucks which is also a plus for us!",P0rGN5mDue55uIiAzkrRlw,1,0,4,BrlqGadRwrMtuNvzZS98jg
