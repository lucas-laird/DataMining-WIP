1047853,2016-07-09,0,blLNQHrgAKR2md7MMx2pzw,"So after having watched the Global Cafe under construction for some time, today my wife and I decided to pop in for some breakfast.  Pleasant surprise!!  Server was very upbeat and attentive.  The menu had good variety.  My wife ordered a build your own omelet, and I had the days special, which included two eggs, hash brown, and five silver dollar pancakes.  I added a side of bacon, and was asked how I like my bacon.  That NEVER happens!!!  I ordered ""crispy"".  Our food came out in a timely fashion, and was very good.  Being a breakfast food kind of guy, I can be a bit picky, especially when it comes to pancakes, waffles, or french toast.  The pancakes were incredible.  I'm not sure if it was the batter, or the syrup, but between the two I can honestly say it was delicious!!  My bacon was exactly they way I cook it at home, and was perfect!!  Both my wife and I agreed we will be back.  Recommend this place for breakfast!!!",yeQj_TzpPpD4m9kZcm5BkQ,0,0,5,_3aCZSuL87exGnvhbQjbxA

1391784,2016-07-01,0,blLNQHrgAKR2md7MMx2pzw,My first time here.  They just opened about s month ago. Excellent breakfast !  Served piping hot!  Three eggs with sausage and the French toast was excellent.  Actually one of the best I've ever had. Nice friendly place and staff. The owners work the dining room and kitchen so they make sure things are done properly. I'm coming back....Give it a try.,AbtIIfRsLoKED4hAO8aT4g,2,0,5,cuCunSsyRXi80a3SeigoXA
1503520,2016-08-16,6,blLNQHrgAKR2md7MMx2pzw,"I was intrigued when this spot opened: they featured a diverse menu of dishes from around the world, but their price point was absurd ($15 for a breakfast burrito, $14 for a baked egg dish riffing on shakshuka, $17 for a burger?!). I waited to see how they would do before making the trek across town.

My recent visit found a pared-down menu (and lowered prices) focusing on diner classics with a few interesting ""global"" dishes thrown in- like the carnitas eggs benedict that I ordered ($13). The dish was tasty: the hollandaise had a bit of spice to it, the eggs were perfectly poached, the salty starch of the hash browns offset the richness of the yolk and sauce nicely. But the carnitas looked visibly old, with hardened and dark edges, and little to no flavor. For a place trying to highlight their more unusual dishes, this was not well-executed. 

The location looks like an old-school diner from the outside, and I received neighborhood-friendly service from Maria, multitasking as hostess, waitress, and busser. Their location is tricky, as it's not visible from the street and sits behind a closed fast food restaurant. Perhaps they need to drop the ""global"" aspirations and just be a cafe.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,16,11,3,zsN02I1bkeh61f_X9YMCXg
1923433,2016-10-03,0,blLNQHrgAKR2md7MMx2pzw,"We came here for a bite before grabbing massages at the school around the corner, my boyfriend ordered the 3 egg meal, but can't have glutten, or carbs, so he asked to sub his bread and hash for avacado! He also wanted to sub his 3 sausage links for Portuguese sausage, in which the server informed us it would be a $1.00 up charge which we were fine with! Needless to say when our food came out, his $1.00 extra Portuguese sausage was all of 5 slices spread out on a plate to make it look like a lot. 

You know it's bad when even the server herself stops to ask ""is that enough food for you?"" As she puts your plate down. He wasn't going to send it back because he didn't want anyone spitting in his food. Furthermore we received our check to find out the upcharge was $2.00 not one for 5 slices of Portuguese sausage, really it should have been at least 2-3 whole sausages for that price. Needless to say we will not be returning here or recommending it to anyone!",3YhHkcBU5Gqp6FQjLcPewA,1,0,2,wCGAWfO4_nErE6OVmSovKw

2779823,2016-06-05,1,blLNQHrgAKR2md7MMx2pzw,"Wow! Where do I start? I was so excited that a breakfast place opened up close to our house! We walked in on Sunday at 10:00 a.m. & there was only one other table with people. Well, they're new, so not many people know about this place. Upon looking at the menu, we were in price shock! This place must have high rent, because the prices are equivalent of a fine ding restaurant, but the decor is not. The walls are half red and half turquoise blue, hardly a color which makes you feel relaxed or like eating at all.   Positively there were two TVs on the wall. I ordered the Eggs Your Way for 8.99. The ketchup was served in a silver soufflé cup and it was runny. The 2 sausages were fat, but when I cut into them, they were pink on the inside so they weren't cooked long enough, & I didn't eat them. I never send food back to a kitchen. The hash browns were o.k. and so was the rye bread. Our waitress smiled, she was friendly. Our food came out quick. We ate and left quick too. Sorry, we won't be back because the prices are to high. These prices are for an upscale neighborhood, and this area of town is definitely not that. Of course this is all my personal opinion, so you'll have to try it for yourself.",OJA-15Qvh9OqSRqwrdGNeQ,5,0,2,6QneZPvqLKZ39SrKjb8KcQ

3029708,2016-07-11,0,blLNQHrgAKR2md7MMx2pzw,"I'm not sure how this place got so many five star reviews but three friends and I went to lunch here today. We got there about noon and the place was completely empty, not a soul in the place until we are ready to leave and another couple came in.
There are very few places that I give a negative review of and this is one of them. Service was great-but then we were the only ones there-but the food left a lot to be desired. I had a Reuben sandwich that was not only very soggy but the corned beef was very fat so you might want to stay away from that one. One other person in our group said her omelette was extremely bland. 
This diner has been open for only six weeks yet the online menu has been scaled down considerably. Several items that are on the online menu are no longer on the menu at the restaurant.

We ended our meal with a frustrating experience using their coupon and that's colored my feelings for this restaurant (when they are trying to stand their ground over a $2 difference it comes off as incredibly petty.) The coffee was great. The food was OK. The staff seemed like they all might be working in the food industry for the first time (maybe family).

I was very impressed with the flavor and quality of the food - every time we go out we like to order a variety and share. We ordered the carnitas eggs benedict, ""baked eggs"", belgian waffle, and the western omelette. I found that i didn't even ask for extra syrup with the waffle which is completely unheard of with me since I usually drown my waffles/pancakes in syrup. It was just so flavorful it didn't need it. The carnitas benne was on point along with the western omelette which I could tell that the ham was pan fried for flavor before tossed in. This locally owned restaurant doesn't cut corners, everything seems to be made with love and it shows.

I love poached eggs, but don't like them runny so I was pleasantly surprised when I was asked if I'd like mine medium. I rarely get asked.  The server was pleasant and prompt. She frequently topped off my water and if I'd ordered a coffee in sure she'd be on top of that as well. The corned beef was tender, and formed into a disk with hash browns before being cooked. The dish came with two of these disks and was a good portion. Eggs were cooked perfectly and toast was as well.  I like my corned beef to be a little salty, but it's probably best as is to please more palates.",BdvX07oti3CWtYVqgqeaCw,0,0,4,GvfyCSVpwYnSsPn7ijw_Iw

By the time we got some syrup the French toast was cold.

The food was extremely salty on this visit. I'm afraid that the same person was not cooking as last time we came. The carnitas in the carnitas benedict was so salty that it was almost inedible. The poached eggs on the benedict were also undercooked. The egg whites were still runny. The hash browns and other breakfast items were also very salty.
