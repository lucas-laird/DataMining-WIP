Though the various namesake ceviches are solid, their food is just really good in general with super-fresh seafood, several spicy sauces, and a great attention to detail and plating.

Their seafood tacos are bomb. The Baja fish tacos are battered on double-layer corn with a light sauce inside and a spicier sauce used on the plate. Their $6 shrimp gobernador tacos are probably my favorite, with several shrimp, a spicy sauce, and Oaxaca cheese but the Marlin is also great, with a similar preparation but not easy to find in Vegas. Makes me wish I could go to San Diego more regularly, but this spot is good when a craving hits.

The tostadas are my preferred way to get their ceviches, mostly because the portions are huge and I'm usually dining solo. If you just want a little something extra on the side, or to take home, they have a few different fresh empanadas- the shrimp/chorizo being my favorite, but the green sauce they're served with is too spicy for me. 

The servers I've had are polite but they often seem understaffed. They get busy in the evenings and only have one or two servers for a full house, and tables often go uncleared for quite a long time because staff are busy tending to customers. The kitchen also seems to get backed up easily, but as long as you go in aware and the food keeps coming out great, it's not a deal breaker.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,20,14,4,tA0aK6-9MoDrOudyzq0QAA

It also came with a basket of tostadas and crackers for the ceviche. Although I've had better oysters, everything else was on point! And the portions were very generous.

One week later I got to try a few of their offerings. Let me tell you, I'm DEFINITELY coming back for more!
This spot is not too big with a modern and cozy feel. There are some booths, tables, and a communal table. As people start discovering this place, I can see seating becoming an issue.
I got my food to-go and it smelled SOOO delicious I inhaled it while driving. That was definitely a balancing act, eating tacos and dipping them in side sauces while driving... So! I couldn't resist! Truthfully, I wasn't even hungry when I came in. I wanted to try the food before I bring my girls here for our monthly dinner.
Now onto the food. I tried the chirozo, cheese, and shrimp empanada, shrimp taco, and marlin taco. All bomb! My favorite was the shrimp taco, big juicy shrimp, fresh and delicious flour tortilla. Tacos are wrapped in two tortillas, BAM! Double the deliciousness!!! I washed this amazingness down with a delicious tamarindo. You have cocktail options and can spike any drink on the menu. 
Honestly, super yum! The prices are reflective of good seafood.",uc9ITBuspRFkl-S3Bo90dg,5,6,5,zANN8xpH3VVlv_3fPqfozQ

(I had the extreme tostada) not what I was expecting but more than I could have imagined. Don't leave Vegas with out trying this great seafood.

Unfortunately the food fell short. Ultimately the food quality is the foundation. Their dishes are interesting, creative yet authentic but very vey overdone. Too much stuff and dressing and sauce on every dish we had. It was hard to taste the core ingredients. In a shrimp dish I want to taste the shrimp. An oyster dish should taste more like oysters than cheese and sauce. In some instances it was hard to actually find the main ingredient amongst and underneath all the unnecessary other  items. They were there and they weren't skimping, simply piling on too much other stuff.

That's it. Plenty of potential and an overall pleasant experience. I simply need to see and taste the food I order, not the condiments.",gtVx0wYZ0z0iozzst7Gm5A,2,0,3,-H4_1NrR4pBSBGCUs6KvFw
4670282,2017-07-17,0,HmeRzfULqmvcx_3TRe_tBw,"FOOD-Authentic Mexican food with good flavor. I recommend the Baja Shrimp Tacos. I believe it is slightly overpriced and the only bummer I experienced was stale chips that were served with the free salsa. Salsa was delicious though.  

DRINKS-My friend wanted Michelada's to help with her hangover and I came across this place on yelp. Happy I did because they are amazing. Only $7 for regular Michelada when $10 or higher is standard in this city. Defiantly get one if you go.

SERVICE-Server was extremely nice and helpful. Happy, smiling and introduced us to their special. 

PARKING-Lots of parking as it's in a shopping center.

ATMOSPHERE-Small, cute and clean. Outside seating available. I loved the Hispanic music playing while we ate. 

DEALS-Check in on Yelp, Facebook or Instagram and get a free item. We received a free Modelo!",OWDbl6g1TTEy_X6wnLp9iQ,1,0,4,CtHa-l7eFyrFDJQVg8zIIA

I went all out & got 7 Seas ceveche..it had all the good stuff! 

Once seated server brings out tostada style chips with salsa. 

This place is not cheap but the fish is fresh & high quality.  

The horchata is delicious!

Met one of my grade school friends last night at this cute little Mexican seafood restaurant for some much need catch up. We arrived to a mariachi band serenading a nearby table and it was pretty impressive to be honest. I enjoyed every minute of it!

Red Wine Sangria was served in cute mugs and taste amazing! 
Beer battered shrimp tacos were pretty delicious nothing out of the ordinary stood out. 
Cheese empanada was pretty good as well; nice and hot!
Spanish Rice was surprisingly delicious as well; usually a hit or miss in my opinion. 

I'm certain I'd be back to at least try the ceviche with mayo!",9PODl32fViCXhN4NxBdGPQ,5,2,4,1sF4ZNYHYKRwL7u6Gwg3oA

The hostess/waitress was very nice. The menu has an amazing selection of seafood that it was hard to decide. I finally chose the octopus tacos and my mom ordered the battered shrimp. Both were amazing! More food than we were expecting. 

Overall I was very satisfied with my experience. The food and customer service was great and the decor is very well thought out and nice. Great place, I'll definitely come back and try some ceviche!",28DXRbhSlPsPPAi66kR3_w,1,0,5,5bhglpAKa41cUOkZVv9ipw

And it was flavorless they just threw like a whole cucumber in it to fill up the cup and barely any avocado..   Don't waste your money here server Tania had a bad attitude and that place has the letter B for a reason.  such a ripoff....,STenR_9zd5ZQB1nXNL6Myw,0,0,1,CwAwMDU2ZsLSLqnh_na9hg

I was disappointed the fish tacos were mainly cabbage & sauce. The fish pieces were on the smaller side, but they were tasty. 

The shrimp cocktail is delicious. Seeing the fish tacos, I though they'd skimp on portions, but it was filled with shrimp & very tasty.
