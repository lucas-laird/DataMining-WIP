The biggest problem this location has is the person running it. One time we came in and the guy at the counter instantly apologized because they were out of stock on almost everything because no one placed an order to restock their supply. Another time I called ahead because I had my kid with me and I wanted to be in and out and the guy waited till I got there before even starting my order, but he had plenty of time talking on his phone. When I asked him why they didn't start when I had called, he gave me attitude. That will be my last time going, the one in the Texas Casino is much better anyways",WecEQHGRP7LgbGDdNKfGIQ,0,0,1,-TOAiSd2q8g3YoEOeqDeCQ

I had a HUGE Nacho Burrito for lunch.  I went back for dinner and had one of their salads.  The salsas are really tasty.  All in all I'll be back whenever I make it back to the area.

While we were eating a little after 8:00pm they turned the lights off on us! And we were confused so I looked at the closing time. They close at 8:45? That's odd... 
But still how do you expect us to eat in the dark?! Freaking weird as hell.  She kept eye balling me, so I kept eye balling her back. Lol",wLE6bPnckQg0b44NAVn4FA,0,0,1,F6Sv-QOcEsPQ2jM_csdqIg

I moved here 5 years ago from California and the Baja Fresh I remember is NOTHING like what is here in Vegas.  Vegas version has the worst taste.

Both the carnitas and steak are very tender, and I like how they grill the burrito after its wrapped. The tortillas are nice and chewy; love the texture!

Don't forget to ask for free chips and get lots of salsa at their bar. I like the verde the best.

Also sign up for their birthday club and get a free burrito for your birthday with a purchase of a large drink! If you keep the cup, refills are $0.99 for as long as you have the cup.",sELpZpITOy9abQB3YY2Ugg,2,2,3,HDEvroYTkds8gTXSrNjmiw

HORRIBLE! 
Absolutely horrible. 
The food was so disgusting. I got the Baja burrito with chicken. I wish I would have taken pictures but I just had to throw it away. My burrito was so soggy I could barely pick it up with out some kind of grease dripping down my hand. And the chicken was not even cooked all the way. Some chicken was hot some little cold. The chips were okay. Tasted very stale and chewy. As for the salsa, NO.  
As for the customer service big thumbs DOWN! Who was ever working March 18, 2017 around 4:30pm, has such an attitude problem. And she was disgusting eating her food at the register while she taking our order. That there in itself should have told us to leave. I'm at least glad my friend didn't get anything to share in this disgust of a good place. 

Just don't eat here. Plan and simple its horrible!! 
Customer Service- Bad 
Food- Bad 
Salsa- Disgusting 
Chips- Bad 
Seating area- Okay. Dirty with trash on most takes from previous guests. But we at least got a seat that wasn't.",aVWQFbpTaMqSBFIPcAKuvA,0,0,1,GtsjKpmwmXX5_wFr7sFj2w

We ordered chicken tortilla soup and chicken Baja salad. We were given chips while we waited and were directed to their salsa bar. Wow! The salsa bar has variety. I was tempted to get the bowl of mango salsa and eat it all on its own. It's that good! They have sweet, non spicy, medium spiced and very spicy salsa. 

The chicken tortilla soup was pretty good and for $4.50, it definitely filled me up. Added cilantro, some spicy salsa and lime juice...boom! The hubby's salad looked good too. They have big servings and low prices. We'll be back to try their tacos and burritos.",lgoMChnRVAP_s_OgHQa56Q,0,0,5,JM_WU8cbHHvyqbRjjMFpng
4033919,2016-07-25,0,f5sSn5cO4t6mF_mdnzKkyA,"Back in 1995, I became a regular okay maybe an obsessive regular. I, along with my friends used to stack the 300 plus original Baja Fresh cups in our warehouse. If you don't remember those cups , they were made of sturdy plastic and were of the quality of cups you'd buy for your kitchen. And the salsa was thick and robust bursting with flavor. Then in or around 2002, they sold to Wendy's and almost over night changes were made. The salsa was thinner, the cups were replaced with flimsy ones and refills of chips went away. As they continued to decline in customer service and they were noticeable, my regularity too declined. Then I heard that Wendy's sold it to a private group so I eventually dropped by to visit in hopes of regaining a fun place to eat from the past. It didn't happen. It seems that they are watering down the salsa...stop it! Now I had the burrito ultimo and it was delicious. It wouldn't take long to bring back the glory of this franchise.....",49UDRi9ZrJcY9JqyX1eQkg,1,1,3,dirzs6xyVBdVoQ0V5weUCQ

We went at around 8 pm I ordered a veggie nacho burrito with pinto beans and apparently if they run out of rice and hour before they close they don't make anymore. Plus they don't tell you that they don't have any more till after you get your food and ask why there was no rice in your burrito. 
Like I said it probably could have been better if I was not so upset with the lack of rice and the extra black beans that apparently make up for not having rice. 
But from now on when I want burritos I'm sticking with Roberto's or a not so commercialized restaurant.",3DjTbhg_HndAxtRnRBt0aQ,0,0,2,tj4JeEgjDeX_U7v9_2Jnyw

This review has nothing to do with the food. It's great..fresh, flavorful, salsa is perfect...I was in the mood for their lobster tacos. Was told by the order taker no lobster..2nd choice Mexicano Burrito w/ Monterrey jack and no sour cheese really simple order. Owner comes out says he's out jack cheese, needs to go to the store and will be right back. In the insuring time, they proceed to make up my orders. I asked if they had made my orders, she says yes. Says they will add the cheese later. Thirty minutes later owner comes back. Delivers the cheese to the kitchen to complete my order. Then walks up to me refunds me my $20.00 for the orders, says this order and my next one is on him.. Gives me my order, noticed the order has sour cream on it (the one I said no sc)...Apologizes, makes a replacement order. Walking out I get a call that I need another order. I order it..he doesn't charge me, unbelievable!! This guys knows customer service. This restaurant recently reopened after being closed for some time. I know this escapade cost him some $$$$$$.
