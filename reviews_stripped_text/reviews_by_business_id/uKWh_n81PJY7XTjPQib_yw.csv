54600,2010-07-07,0,uKWh_n81PJY7XTjPQib_yw,"I made a beeline for Elixir once I saw the word ""Organic"" on its promotional sign in the parking lot where the fresh52 Farmer's Market is held. There are not too many Organic restaurant/cafes in Henderson and needless to say, I was stoked. They have only recently opened (a 'soft' opening) and don't have their full menu just yet, but there is already plenty of deliciousness to enjoy. 

I started by devouring their sumptuous vegan chocolate cake, since other people had already finished up the red velvet cake (boo!), while waiting for my Caesar wrap on a spinach tortilla. The cake was wonderfully light and fluffy and adequately moist, and I was still quite hungry when the wrap came out. The wrap was perfect. The presentation was lovely, and it was served with a little cup of cold grapes, a pickle, and a hot pepper. The wrap itself was one of the most gorgeous, tastiest spinach wraps I've ever seen - whole wheat with flecks of spinach, rather than the green ones I've seen elsewhere. The Caesar dressing was light and tasty, and the veggies were fresh and finely chopped. This sandwich normally comes with chicken, but I am vegetarian and they were happy to substitute tomatoes. 

They plan to add hot sandwiches to the menu as well as a breakfast menu - yum. Currently there are a variety of fresh fruit / yogurt / boba tea smoothies as well as salads, other sandwiches, and a few other things I can't remember. I plan to return frequently. Great addition to the neighborhood!",SvDBPy8VQoe7gdzR-RAcjg,6,0,5,4jW0WayNHn1BDLYn7JbL_Q

We had spring rolls, hot vegetarian sandwich and cole veggie chicken sandwiches - all of which were excellent.

My only criticism is that $2.99 plus $1 for refills is way too expensive for a small glass of regular iced tea.   I will definitely return to the restaurant, but will probably skip the drink.",w-9G9Xi0ah7iXtO7SF7zYw,0,0,4,mLljGqgNVBKvxqlczfI9kQ
177854,2010-07-29,0,uKWh_n81PJY7XTjPQib_yw,"Wow, had to wait almost 20 mins for a hot sandwich and a minestrone soup to go. If I knew it would have been that long, I think I would have just gone home to make my own lunch.

My boyfriend got the hot beef sandwich. When we got home (not even 5 mins away) it was all soggy and falling apart. The sauce wasn't even on the sandwich yet. The beef was tasty, but nothing spectacular. It came with grapes, a pickle and a hot pepper. He got the sandwich on multi-grain bread which he was fairly disappointed with.

I got a bowl of the minestrone soup (vegetarian). For one, I thought minestrone was supposed to have beans? I'm not crazy about beans, but I'd expect to see a few, especially it being vegetarian.. how do they expect you to get full? This soup was definitely mediocre. The noodles were extremely soggy and mushy! The bowl for $4.99 was more the size of a cup! I wonder how small the cup is..

The prices are outrageous. My boyfriend's hot sandwich, a bowl of minestrone and a iced black tea came out to $19!! Next time, I'm driving up the road to Go Raw Cafe for some better tasting/fresh food, even if it is raw!

The interior decor looks sort of like a mediterranean restaurant. Had some cool looking paintings. But there were tons of shelves with nothing in them. The seating ranges from tiny tables for two, or couch seating for groups. There is also a bar looking area where their a worker making smoothies and drinks.

Overall, not worth the wait or the price.",DGDlpOVeUNEkBDYkJLvdBQ,1,0,2,eLD3TC-L560oj4VS5sJk4Q
248665,2010-11-28,0,uKWh_n81PJY7XTjPQib_yw,"Vegan menu is ok.  Most  entrees use fake deli meats.  The seitan-like chicken ones are better.  Sandwiches could be filled more.  1 or 2 slices of deli-meat and a sprinkling of daiya cheese is not really filling.  

Soups:  small size is SMALL. Possibly 2 oz. for $4.  No more than 4 or 5 spoonfuls.  Either lower the prices, or get bigger containers.

Boba teas are good as are the other fruit drinks.  

Desserts definately need improvement.  Vegan carrot cake has been the only dessert available for months.

427058,2012-08-30,0,uKWh_n81PJY7XTjPQib_yw,"This place is awful!  I had a groupon that was going to expire today, so I decided to swing by on my way home to pick up something for lunch.  I'd been really wanting to try it because of the vegan options (I had not checked yelp reviews- lesson learned), but I was very short on time, so I wanted to get my food to go. Having never been there before, I needed a minute with the menu. The girl behind the counter was less than friendly and never stopped to actually listen to my order.  I literally had to follow her and she never really acknowledged what I said except to tell me that the kitchen was really busy and it was going to take about 30 minutes to get the humus plate and veggie wrap I ordered. Busy?  There were two tables occupied in the entire place!? But okay, whatever.  I was already there, starving, and gone through the ridiculous chore of placing an order.  

Then, when I showed her my groupon, she said that it was, "" dine in only."" the best part is her explanation that it was due to the extra cost of take-out packaging.  Unless they're wrapping in cashmere, I really don't see how a 10 cent piece of plastic could possibly cost more than serving food on a plate you then have to pay someone to wash.  

So, I said fine, bring it on a plate, but I'll just have to ask for you to box it up because I had a repair man coming that I needed to be home to let inside.  Her response?  ""my manager is right there and she's pretty strict about it.  And she'd catch on to what you were doing."". Excuse me??  And what exactly would she do about it?  

I just left and will never go back. There are plenty of other great restaurants with fantastic vegan food in this city.  I have no desire to waste my time or to in any way contribute to the existence of such an insulting and rude establishment.",SVVmfF8e9VkrWYuVbzuY6w,2,0,1,wG2mz5wkCk6s_r6xMGZBkg

So we kept standing there with two little kids until we finally decided to seat ourselves. Our waters never came. Once the food came, she never came back to the table. They were out of the GF vegan desert. and apparently we accidently ordered outside of the ""groupon"" menu and were charged for it.

933700,2010-07-19,0,uKWh_n81PJY7XTjPQib_yw,"Very disappointing.  We went to Elixir with high hopes given their menu and approach to food.

We arrived and were one of two groups in the entire restaurant.  The waitress was pleasant enough, let us know the menu was limited and would be expanding.  We ordered and it somehow took 35 minutes for basically soup, salads and a sandwich.  By the time 10 minutes had passed we were the only group in the restaurant and it took over 20 minutes for them to tell us they were out of ingredients for one of the orders.

When the food came it was pretty good.  Soup was bland, salad was unexceptional, but the veggie sandwich and thai beef wrap were both very good.

Unfortunately, despite the incredibly long wait time, the owner, who was in the building, declined to come out and say anything to us and even more amazingly told the waitress the best she could do is take 10% off the check.  Most insulting - the waitress said that the owner said we could put our feedback on a comment card!  Wow.  The only guests in her new restaurant and couldn't come out.  Simply amazing.

I can't even begin to wrap my head around that kind of mentality.  She should be begging to come to talk to every guest during her soft opening, whether the food took 35 minutes or not.  Then to not come out and introduce herself under these circumstances - just mindblowing.  

We will not be back - I cannot support management with such little passion for their guests.

The cashier said ""sorry"" in the least apologetic tone and didn't seem to know what to do or care. Needless to say, we left pretty upset. I came by again on Wednesday at 11:45 to find the place closed. The sign says closed on Mondays. There were employees inside ignoring us. The only thing I can think of for why it was closed was the rain but that doesn't make much sense since every other establishment in the center was open.

 I was a bit hesitant at first because the other reveiws were not all that great, but I think this cafe is so adorable. Remember, your not going to a Outback or Chilis kind of place,there isnt booths and the seating tables are arranged as a cafe setting, I think some people forgot that when they reviewed.

 When you walk in you wait to be seated (it didn't seem to be very busy and the waitress was multitasking, but it didnt take more than a couple short minutes for her to seat us) She was very nice and helped us make selections from the menu. There are tons of great choices. We ended up with an app of Feta and green spread pita bread and for entree the hawaiian pizza and he got an italian toasted sandwhich. SO GOOD! and you can seriously taste the freshness.

But every other surrounding aspect of the cafe needs some sort of improvement if not more. First off, the graphical design/theme of the restaurant needs MAJOR change. If I didn't read this about yelp and walked by the store, I would've thought that this joint is some acupuncture office. The Website also needs major reconstruction as well. 

The service wasn't bad but the waitress seemed a bit awkward. Not to say it hinders her performance as a waitress, but she can use a little more personality. 

The atmosphere also didn't really remind me of a cafe or even a restaurant. To me, it looked more like a furniture store. And it was dead silent in there. No music and a TV that wasn't even on. The waitress also seemed to be fulfilling duties that aren't really resembled of a waitress. She was spending way too much time cleaning the place.

I got the Guacamole burger with whole wheat + grass fed beef.. It was juicy and cooked on point. Could have used more guacamole since it is a ""guacamole burger."" But in all, the taste was delicious. On the other hand, my girlfriend got the Santa Fe burger with whole wheat bread and grass fed beef in which was practically the exact same as the Guacamole burger... I have no idea why. Nevertheless, it was very tasty. On the sides, I got blue corn chips. Not enough to fulfill the side that I want but still somewhat good. On the other hand, my girlfriend got baked fries which is an additional $1.50. I recommend getting baked fries over any other side just because I'm a potato type of guy but it really complements a burger well.

Later on, the cook came out and greeted us to check up and see how we liked the food. I felt very welcomed and he definitely makes me wanna come back on numerous occasions. On a real note though, this restaurant needs major reconstruction other than its foods because they seem to be struggling just a little. And to make matters a bit more difficult, they are competing with another restaurant with the same focus of organic foods in Green & Proteins, which is about a quarter mile north from Elixir.

Like most of the other reviews for Elixir, I have to say that the service was pretty bad. I took my sister out to lunch, and there were only two other people eating there. I don't see why it takes so long to get even our smoothies on the table. 

However, my sister and I LOVED the food. My sister got a panini, which she thoroughly enjoyed. And in concurrence with a fellow yelper, it could have been filled more. It came with really yummy blue tortilla chips and mango salsa. I got a Cobb wrap, which I LOVED. It's not often that I get to eat vegetarian turkey. Especially when it comes with rich avocado, fresh veggies, veggie bacon, creamy blue cheese dressing, all wrapped in a spinach tortilla!

My sister and I both got smoothies, I don't remember what she got, but I got something with honeydew and mint. It was sweet and refreshing--definitely my new favorite smoothie.

We ordered a couple things, all were decent, nothing mind blowing, so when the groupon came up again, I was reluctant to get it, but since my friend is vegan, this was a close lunch spot for us. This time around however, things are different. Again, the place is empty. The ambiance/atmosphere is really strange, a large room with old lady furniture & couches, and outdoor patio furniture for their tables. I ordered the hummus platter, the cucumbers were soggy & watery in the middle, the celery was old looking as well, they were hard at the ends. The hummus wasn't that great, I didn't know it was flavored (I prefer plain old hummus) the only thing good was the pita bread. I ordered the turkey burger, I was expecting ground turkey, but what came out was an actual piece of turkey that had been on a panini machine, it was dry, gross and inedible. I still had some money left to the groupon so since I didn't eat my burger I ordered a mango lassi (which tasted like crap, NOTHING like a mango lassi, like ice and greek yogurt) she then informed me that the groupon was for dine in only and I wouldn't be able to take the smoothie I would have to drink it here. Are you kidding me? Uh okay. I watched several people come in after me, and what a long time to be served. I don't foresee this place lasting.

I loved the food. I had the lemongrass vegan chicken wrap and it was wonderful! The sauce was good, and anyplace that serves vegan/vegetarian food as well as gluten free options are a winner in my book. The green tea with coconut was very refreshing. I ended up taking half of my wrap home, with my Vegan Carrot Cake and they will be my lunch today.

The serenity and decor of this place made me feel like I was in the lounge area of a spa. The theme continued to the bathroom as well, where I found myself confused by the really low-placed mirror and the tiny vanity. Truthfully, I expected an organic cafe to have a modern design w/ simple, clean features & bright colors. Anyways, it was a surprise. 

The menu features a lot of healthy choices, including vegan and vegetarian items. There are also cakes and other baked treats behind the glass display at the counter. I didn't eat anything, but I did have a glass of Iced Green Tea (free refill!). I'm not a tea expert, but the green tea didn't really taste like green tea. But overall, it was refreshing. The server was very friendly and definitely made sure my glass always had tea in it, so extra points for the lovely service.

However,... 

The atmosphere is less than desirable. Yes, there are couches. Yes there's some tables. But the place needs more color and sound. I asked the manager to put on some music in the future. They had a movie playing on the TV when I arrived. Totally not a movie I would associate with Elixir, mindful eating or general well-being. Like,... put on a surfing movie at least. Not National Lampoon's European Vacation!

The space reminds me of a cafe that used to be in the Lower Haight in San Francisco called, ""Common Ground."" The coffee was good. The music (which ranged from Reggae to Indy-rock) was decent and there were some good food choices. This place needs to embrace their cafe/ lounge attitude and play some darn music!

The Caesar salad was fair. The blue cheese burger was overcooked like... well, well done, and I wasn't asked a temperature by the server. The server didn't bring enough setups and I was given the reasoning that the table was small so they try to conserve. Um... utensils are utensils. I need them to eat.

Some things should just be a given when it comes to service.
I think she saw two entrees ordered and brought just two setups because of it. But.... there were 3 of us. And yes, I had to ask for an extra plate. Good service should predict a customers needs. This place needs some serious training.

Back to the food... as someone else said, they have good intentions. I liked the choices of bread, meats and veggie options for their burgers. Presentation of the food needs some work. Right now, I might as well be at the Waffle House and not a healthy choice restaurant.

With competition like Greens and Protein and the Raw Cafe, this place is going to need to pull it together with their atmosphere, service and food in order to stay in the game.",qQecSd0lynfB4g-LPa9JCw,5,1,2,mYnju4skm6PbPIoMe4SyMQ

My mom is a bit of a health-nut and took me for lunch here one day and it was UNBELIEVABLE how bad this place fails on all levels. 

We walked in and the place was relatively empty, save for one table of two women sitting in the back of the restaurant. The waitress sat us down and left to get us menus...and five minutes rolled by. She asked us what we wanted to drink, left the table and another ten minutes rolled by while we waited for those. She came back and we placed our order...thirty minutes later the waitress returned with our food.

I understand that fresh food sometimes takes a long time to prepare, but this was outrageous because all we ordered was two burgers. If I remember correctly, Mom had a Vegan burger and I had a good old-fashioned beef burger. I'll go on the record right now as saying that this was one of the worst burgers I had ever had. I ordered a ""Cajun Spicy Burger,"" but there was nothing spicy, nor flavorful about it. The menu stated that the burgers come up with blue corn chips and mango salsa, which they did....five blue corn chips and a dixie cup-size Mango Salsa, which was also not especially tasty. At $9.99, these burgers were overpriced...especially because they didn't even come closing to filling either of us up.

Long after we had already finished eating, the waitress came and took our plates, and after another wait, we received the check. Leaving this place was a DREAM.

I can only speculate that our bad service was the Elixir Cafe's way of punishing us for not ordering all veggie burgers or taking any shots of wheat grass. If I want a burger, I'll take my business to Bachi Burger, Sliding Thru......even McDonald's  before I come to this joint again.",UAF1qKkTIcZOVpx0lhU3gA,8,1,1,KuveJ8gvdWL-tA6vUKGw7Q

The menu is quite extensive. Lots of choices for the vegetarian, vegan, and meat-eater alike. Once you order, they can take their sweet time to make it. Having been here about 5 times, each time took over 1 1/2 hours from being seated to paying the bill.

When the food does eventually get to you, it is delicious. I have only been disappointed by one of their meals, which was a Mediterranean panini that didn't taste like anything.

-Basil lemonade:  Tasted very pure, like no sugar added.
-Lemongrass Burger (turkey):  Oh my Gawd, this was super tasty.  If I knew it was this good, I would have ordered a burger for myself vs halfing it with my bf.  I could devour a whole one by myself easily.  It's not a typical burger.   The veggies on there were cucumber, daikon, carrot, and lettuce.  The sauce was unique and flavorful.  The turkey was not a patty that I was expecting.  Instead, it was a nice thick slice of turkey that seems to be carved from a whole turkey.  Muy Bueno.

That is the only positive I can mention.  The service is some of the worst I've ever encountered.  We waited 7 minutes or so just to be acknowledged at the front door, and I finally flagged down a girl w/ dreadlocks & kneesocks, who rudely said ""I'm not your server, but I'll find you a table"".  Wow - Thank you so much for doing your job!

We got the lemongrass chicken wrap, which I would definitely go back for (for takeout only) - and we also ordered the italian sandwich, which was just OK.  
The ambience in Elixir is awful - It's a nice-sized space with potential, but is decorated in a way that makes it look tacky, cold and unwelcoming. Ick.

I hope this place doesn't go out if business because I'd love to try out their various vegetarian options and there food was pretty good, but they seriously need to change some things.

The burgers were delicious, so yummy and juicy.  They were actually quite huge, and my mom and I had a hard time finishing our burgers and blue corn chips n salsa.  I honestly thought that the burgers were good, the teas were refreshing, and the service was excellent--she came around quite often to check up on us.  

However, I didn't appreciate the fact that the menus were not updated and I changed my order a few times because the menus didn't accurately reflect what was being served--burgers and dessert options, as well as tea selection.  I didn't feel like a wrap so I don't know if they have updated that section or not.  They actually only had one option for dessert, and I wish that I would've known that prior to walking in, as the black forest cake looked delicious, but was a bit dry in my opinion (had to eat it later on since I was so stuffed).  

I was lucky enough to find a parking spot when I did, since it is in a plaza that shares parking with a lot of other restaurants and shops.

The cafe is open and bright, and they have both tables or sofa seating available. They also have a stage, so maybe they will be having live music at some point? Or maybe an open mic poetry night where I can read my vegan sonnets? (Kidding!)

They have a standard cafe menu of soups, salads, and sandwiches (including wraps and panini).  They have a list of like 6 vegan soups (!!) including vegan chix noodle, minestrone, chili, lentil, and butternut squash.  However, only the lentil was available.  Booooo!

There is a vegan/vegetarian version of the standard menu that is almost exactly the same -- they just replace the meat and/or cheese with a vegan version (they have Tofurkey and Crown meats, and it looks like Daiya cheez).  My server told me that all of the vegan/veggie menu is vegan (or can be made as such).  Yay!!!

They also have a juice bar, various teas, boba (which is organic and not as sweet as regular boba - I overheard a discussion about this) and frozen yogurt.  You can dine in or do takeout.

The service was pretty quick, I was seated immediately with a menu, then a couple minutes later I was brought a little dish of dried fruit to gnaw on while making my menu decision.  What a cute idea!

I opted for the Vegan Cobb Salad ($9.99) with vegan ranch dressing.  I will admit I was a little underwhelmed, although, to be fair, it came exactly as described on the menu - lettuce, tomatoes (only a few), croutons bacon bits, fake turkey, a little cheez, and avocado.  I could have used a few more veggies in there (carrots? cucumber?).  But what the hell, I've never had a real Cobb salad so maybe that's right on the money. 

Regardless, it was a good size, very tasty. and they did not skimp on the avocado!  The dressing was so good.  They only gave me a little tiny cup, but that's really all I needed.... and if they'd doled out more, I would have just slopped on some unnecessary calories.  The salad also came with some very fluffy whole wheat pita that was delish.  I just had a black iced tea to drink, which was fine but nothing special (and $2.99?!?).

They have a deal going on now that you get half off your drink with the purchase of an entree.  It's a bit pricey, but it is organic food, so you're getting really good quality.  I think this place has a lot of potential.

For some reason it's really hard to get fresh, raw juices.  Thank god I found Elixer.  They have a variety of mixes and you are welcome to create your own.  The prices are decent comparatively.  Sadly raw juice is expensive, if you own a juicer you know why!  

Looked over the menu items, and they didn't seem bad.  They seem to cater to a variety of diets.  Gluten Free option too!  The place looked almost empty and had a weird layout.

Don't think it has a great vibe to dine in, but I would for sure do take out.  I also will be back for more juice!",9r-Z59v4Hj5InNu01kSdtQ,4,0,4,CeNGzTfnWe_pAqFvLxrYDA

5134631,2012-08-13,0,uKWh_n81PJY7XTjPQib_yw,"I bought a groupon for elixir back in April. I usually always yelp before I groupon but of course this time I didn't. Lesson learned! When I finally did my research & saw all the negative reviews, I chalked it up to them being a newer business & figured I would wait a while for them to work out the kinks out before giving them a shot. Silly me, thinking that this business owner might pay attention to yelp & surely the types of issues people were talking about would be dealt with. 

Well, fast forward 4 months to this past Thursday when the hubby & I finally got a chance to give this place a try. We walked in a little after 5pm to a completely empty restaurant. I tried to push aside any lingering doubts & keep an optimistic attitude. The sign said please wait to be seated but the lady behind the juice bar didn't so much as glance our way or acknowledge that we had even walked in. We started walking towards a table while asking if it would be ok to sit down. I think she grunted or something but definitely did not give a clear answer. We sat down & waited for her to bring over a menu, say hi, smile, something!! Nothing. She continued to clean or do whatever it was she was doing behind the counter & then finally brought over some menus after close to 5 minutes. Sorry to put you out! 

She took our drink orders, water with lemon for me & a sugar cane soda for hubby which she said they were out of b/c Whole Foods was out of it. Um, ok. He asked for just water with lemon too. We also ordered the Vietnamese spring rolls as a starter. I noticed that it came with a choice of dipping sauces but she never asked which one we wanted & hurried away before we could tell her. She came back with the 2 waters, no lemon. I asked for some lemon again & she came back with a tiny wedge of lemon in a filthy little bowl (pic attached) which I unfortunately didn't notice until after I had squeezed the lemon into my water :/ Then I realized we had no place settings therefore no napkins to wipe my lemon-juice covered hands on. I got her attention & asked for some napkins which she brought over, but again like I was putting her out.

A couple minutes later, she came back to take our dinner order. I asked if I could have my chicken sandwich on a multi-grain bun to which she replied ""that's what it comes on"" The menu has several different bun options listed, so I'm not sure why that is the default bun for that sandwich. I guess if I had wanted another type of bun, they would have been out of it. 

Another 10 minutes or so & she brought out the spring rolls with a sweet chili sauce. Still no silverware so I guess it was good it was finger-food. We asked if we could get some of the peanut sauce instead & she informed us that they don't have peanut sauce. I mentioned that I had noticed it on the menu & she said ""oh yeah, the manager is really bad about updating the menu"" Way to call out your manager! O.O

We finally got our dinners after another 20 minutes or so. Cobb salad wrap for hubby, Mediterranean grilled chicken sandwich for me. Hubby's came with 4 grapes, a tiny pickle & a pepperoncini pepper. Mine came with some mango salsa &, no joke-I counted, 7 blue corn tortilla chips. 

The food itself was pretty good, albeit a little pricey for what you get. I'm glad we had the groupon! I wouldn't mind going back to try other things on the menu but you could not pay me to go back there & sit through another dinner that was as awkward, uncomfortable & slow as that was. 

I usually don't discount a place on service alone & always understand that people can have bad days. Yes, even a waiter/waitress!  But when I see yelp review after yelp review stating pretty much the same thing, I get a little ticked off. If some business owners took the time to read through reviews & fix the problems that are glaringly staring back at them, more businesses would succeed!",4dSX2TsK3jF-g8HzIpYGrg,10,2,1,BE8X_qUThprXRL7cysap4Q

I seriously think there may be only one other coffee shop in Vegas that has a couch, and Elixir has plural... couchES. Big ones. Given the comfy seating, I was disappointed to find no Wi-Fi! However, it is still an ideal setting for a book club or for a solo bookworm to curl up and read. It is definitely a casual spot. 

The menu is vegan and vegetarian friendly with sandwiches, salads, soups and perfect snacks. I didn't sample a wide variety of their food offerings, but I tried the hummus/baba platter which comes with cucumbers, carrots celery and pita. It was the perfect, healthy snack. I had no objections to finishing off the plate by myself! 

They have a selection of teas, and I had an iced green tea. I thought the tea flavor could have been better. It tasted a bit over steeped. However, the glass was never empty thanks to a super attentive, sweet server who was quick with the refills!

Went and got a couple of sandwiches for lunch today. 

1. Roasted Eggplant sandwich with roasted red peppers made vegan style with vegan mozzarella cheese, italian dressing, and alfalfa sprouts on sprouted bread, panini style. Tasted awful! I ate half cuz I was so hungry, but couldnt bare to eat the other half. No flavor, my boyfriend even commented that it tasted like dirt, and he was right. 

2. Mediterranean Panini with hummus, cucumbers, tomatoes, feta, and alfalfa sprouts ona sprouted grain bread. Again bland. And those are some of my favorites things to eat. It was better than the egglpant sandwich, but thats not saying much.

3. Chocolate cake, vegan & gluten free. Again lacked the flavor, or had too much such as was with the icing. Icing seemed like it need to be whipped more, tasted very sugery (like the actual granules) and a lot of amaretto, and something that tasted chemical, its stung my mouth, was really bad. Anyways, seems like it lacked experience. You could taste each ingredient separately, should all blend together, it didnt. Threw it away.

They used to carry Chef Mayra's cakes, but have since have decided to make them themselves. They dont even come close to her cakes. They should go back to selling Chef Mayra cakes, if at least til they have more practice in the vegan cake making arena.

One good note the salsa that they served on side was good.

And I also would like to note that this is not the first post on this place. It seems that someone erased their profile on here. So I am restarting it. Hope they don't erase it again. As the say, if you cant stand the heat, get outta the kitchen. 

But, I really hope they get better and are able to server good food soon because we really need more organic options. 

So try at your own risk. But you have been warned. 
Thats my 2 cents. For what its worth.",Mj4R3_zWXA7CMiYr2FQ4Ww,2,0,1,1MbH4XcAAqJfyCP4cj-DtQ

If you purchase one to be used before 11:30am make sure to order breakfast, because it does not cover lunch. 

We had ordered lunch, because their breakfast specials did not sound appealing. I had ordered the Lemongrass Turkey Burger on a grain bun($9.99). The juicy patty was topped with pickled diakon and carrots, lettuce, cilantro, cucumbers, and raw onions. All this talk about banh mi has got me subconsciously seeking out these flavors. It was absolutely delicious. Each sandwich comes with a side of chips and chunky mango salsa. For the price compared to quality, it was really reasonable.

Went midday, no one there except 1 or 2 tables coming in with Groupons. Only had 3 desserts available from the 7-8 on the menu.

We ordered smoothies, after about 40 mins we cancelled our smoothie order, and just ordered some waters...the smoothies never showed up.  We sat without a drink for 40 mins prior to that, not even a water, or being asked if we'd like something else to drink. no attempt at all and probably no notice at all that we had nothing to drink.

There was 7 of us, they messed up all of our orders, AND we were supposed to get chips with our sandwiches.  After an hour & a half of being there we *finally*  got our food. No chips. After inquiring about the chips, the waiter did agree we were supposed to have chips on the side somehow he had missed this when he was bringing us the food. Then  we were told they were totally  out of chips.  Instead we got 7 grapes in a cup. No attempt to ask us what we'd like instead, fries, salad something.  It was awful.

Unfortunately this place has good food. It's poorly managed and the waitstaff is horrible.  I'll never go back. I'd suggest unless you have 2 spare hours you skip it as well.

Yeah, that's just my opinion, but I can't be the only one. Also, on a 75 degree day in Vegas, the temperature inside was way too hot. Even my wife who is never warm noticed it. The tables are too small, and the couches are creepy looking. We ordered smoothies and I swear they must have grown the fruit trees from scratch in order to make them, they took FOREVER to come out. They were good, though. We ordered the ""hummus delight"" appetizer and even though the hummus was good, there wasn't enough of it to adequately eat it with the sides. My wife ordered the Greek salad and there was no feta cheese. What?!?!  That was a first and it made the salad so-so at best. I got the spicy beef panini and it was really good, but it looked as though they had some trouble with the panini press because it was a bit burnt and had pieces of other sandwiches on the bread.

I'm glad we were wrong about that! Turns out nearly the whole menu (minus deserts) was carnivore-friendly, and there also existed a veggie or vegan option of most every item. They have an awesome smoothie selection & some great flavored herbal teas (the ""elixirs""). I ordered the lemongrass & sesame panini and my lunch mate got the lemongrass beef burger. Both were tasty (though my panini didn't have the pickled daikon/carrot mix I expect as part of that flavor palette) and came with some blue corn chips--dusted with some kind of slightly spicy and delicious powder--and a small cup of salsa (nowhere near the best salsa I've ever had, and frankly tasted like it was poured from a jar of Pace, but at least the chips were good). Our waiter, JB, was a whirlwind of energy & hilarity and was one of my favorite parts of the whole place. They had karaoke videos showing during lunchtime on a Saturday, and we were encouraged to grab the mic & go for it if we wanted (we passed since there's no booze served there & that's usually the necessary precursor). There's some really nice artwork on a couple of the walls, though I wish they'd extend it over to all the walls since the others looked a little sterile or austere. Still, though, it's a nice-looking little place, and the black leather couches along one wall are awesome to kick back on.

...keep in mind that I just found this draft of a review from well over a year ago. I've been back a couple times since, and service has been slow every time (JB was nowhere to be seen), and sometimes you get the distinct feeling they believe they have better things to do than serve you, but that's definitely not all the time, just when certain people are manning the fort. The owner is nice, when she's there. There never seem to be very many patrons in Elixir, which kind of makes me wonder how they're able to stay afloat, but maybe they do more business during the karaoke night(s).",g1YLVOwquTJ5ILeWIwqW9Q,1,0,3,_Z4zA6SdoqHstiZ-dP49LQ
