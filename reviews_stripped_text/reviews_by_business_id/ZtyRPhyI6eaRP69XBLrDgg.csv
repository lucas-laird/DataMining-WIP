Waitress Marie was very nice and friendly with a cute smile, I will stop by there on my next flight.",_J5t1N2zwKy-zvJsjdTJ7g,0,0,4,oszH6vm9sUm0kBVPdiqXJg

I told them this feedback in person and nothing was done - ie. no attempt to make it better, no discount, no apologies from cook or management, nada. Wake up, you aren't even trying.",o4dziBth4_W-0Q4sdZkH6g,0,0,1,DvjwUpxyDbNu_rqzY9RlVA

4722708,2016-08-17,0,ZtyRPhyI6eaRP69XBLrDgg,The interior was very nice and the staff was very kind where possible.  Only I couldn't carry on a conversation because the manager's were very nasty.  Every sentence one of the  manager's would rudely interrupt. This while trying to talk to the waiter. They spent a ton of money on the interior but I hate the management of this place.  The food was OK but everything here was extremely expensive.  I wish they had better managers running the show.  I would not recommend this place of business,Dpp0gEmuNTnvyPAdrDu2Bw,1,0,2,4EYKNni4Rz8ij77SYKzWyQ

Other airports need to take notice and follower their lead.   The fish and chips were OUTSTANDING!!!,ZI7Oz30xwJym9E1KwsVROQ,0,0,5,tsUWY-urm3f-Rrok0TYsyA

He is rude, disrespectful and does not belong in the service industry. This is a seat yourself establishment that had only virtually no customers when I popes in to grab a bite prior to my flight. He apparently got upset that my party of 3 took up 6 seats. ( there was over 50 seats available) Instead of asking us to move.... he ranted around the restaurant flapping  his arms, telling all his coworkers how we just HAD to spread out. When I tried to talk to him about it, he got even ruder. There are so many places at the airport to eat, there is no need to waste your money here.",h5LWidhrzgfCMsd8nWOuzA,1,0,1,IuSdXbUScJ-oe4aUnRliBg
