65781,2010-11-13,0,1VTezD8PLosh-FeNxSRQ7g,"Here's what we really liked:
*Generous drink portions
*Easy to get seating/reservation
*Steaks were very flavorful

What we didn't like:
*2 out of 3 of our steaks were overcooked
*Waiter raved about tuna appetizer being the best thing on the entire menu-- the sauce was phenomenal but the fish itself left much to be desired (not sure how you mess up raw fish??)
*The creamed spinach was very mediocre, lacked a lot of flavor
*The mashed potato trio had PHENOMENAL flavor -- really liked that... but we all agreed that they were instant mashed potatoes based on the texture.  Would have been our favorite part of the meal if the potatoes were real

Overall, the place is decent.  I wouldn't go here expecting the greatest meal in Vegas, and the food certainly wasn't worth what we paid.  But-- if you haven't planned ahead for your evening & want a place to get large & reasonably priced drinks with dinner, this is a good option.",ACk2oF8RC74GAMx3Cm5B1A,0,0,2,8F5Y2KOC6AifTIg41Jfsrg

Had the Kobe Meatball  for a starter,and I have to say they were excellent,and was followed by a wonderfully done ribeye that was recommened by our server.The service and food was great...and being monday it is half off.I would adivise anyone to enjoy the experience and maybe go early as it is not as crowded.And one last thing,if it monday night,tip them on what the full bill would be...not the half price, your getting a steal.",Z52AYxgktRVqZoFaIulYbA,0,0,5,MvXt-KJQhyG5INkAIvW_aQ
196215,2011-02-03,1,1VTezD8PLosh-FeNxSRQ7g,Best steak I've ever had! The lighting was low but had a fun ambiance. The waitresses were good looking. I went with a friend on a Monday night.(50% off the menu) I ordered the bone in rib eye(23 bucks with the half off) and had it medium. It was cooked perfect with a nice crust on the outside. I also ordered the mac n cheese as a side and the potato trio. Both were 6 bucks. Incredible! All the food was incredible and was served quickly without any problems. A little spendy without the 50% but still well worth it.,QaoW7PCXZdNgoNhNZUosIQ,1,1,5,StIbMpqvtQ-hyw6uZdZ_YQ
223797,2011-06-02,0,1VTezD8PLosh-FeNxSRQ7g,"Horrible experience. Went here on a Tuesday night May 31st with 9 ppl for one of my close friends 21st birthday dinner. My hubby and I arrived a little late, the waiter took forever to even get  to us to take our drink order and then it took at least 15 minutes for us to receive our drinks once we ordered them...I had ordered a diet coke and my husband a beer really... then another 20 minutes at least for our caesar salads to arrive..then forever for our main course to get to our table. Even though it was her birthday forget dessert I did not want to have to wait any longer for anymore food. I work in a fast pace busy restaurant and I would have been more understanding and patient if the place was packed and you can tell the waiter was obviously busy but this was not the case there was only 3 tables seated in the restaurant and a few people relaxing at the bar. Overall just  horrible service and he knew he was getting a descent tip regardless because of our group size automatic 18% gratuity ahhh never going back again.",zaGXcJplH5VY28UPlSm_5g,1,0,1,hJ5CzwpgAW-zMnuw1PaejQ
290136,2010-11-17,0,1VTezD8PLosh-FeNxSRQ7g,"The worst experience I've ever had in my life!!!!  Rare 120 offers a complimentary dinner for female groups.  They are somehow connected to the HRH Vanity Club and their purpose to is to bring girls to the club to attract men clientele.  We had reservations for 14 girls and for whatever reason they had us down for 6... No bueno to start off the night.  Carlos Harper who's the host of the restaurant, told us they were arranging to get a table together because of the confusion and we would be seated immediately.  We arrived at 9pm and he made us wait for AN HOUR!!!  We're not expecting anything major from a free dinner but if he couldn't accommodate us he could've said it, so we could decide whether to stay there or leave.  Instead he kept saying to wait 15 minutes and of course an hour had elapsed since he advised us of the wait.

The dinner finally was served at 1015pm.  We ordered drinks which are not included with our meal.  The food quality was as of any low-end steakhouse, nothing spectacular to brag about.  Of course it was free so we can't complain on that part. We were ready to go by 11pm so we told Carlos to get us ready because we had our reserved table at Vanity and we wanted to take advantage of our time as much as possible.  Carlos told us to wait a few minutes because he needed to walk us to the club so we didn't have to wait in line.  While we waited for him we proceeded to pay for our tab, a total of $66 and change.  We put down some gratuity in cash but since our service was horrible we left what we thought was appropriate.  

We waited for Carlos for another 30 minutes!!!!  We were just furious at this point and we left the restaurant and walked ourselves to the club.

A couple days later I checked my account and there was a charge for $93.78 for the drink tab at Rare 120. WTF???  My tab was $66 and change and somehow I got charged $30 more!!! I don't know if they just added their own gratuity on there, but if they did without my consent that's total fraud.  I'm in the process of disputing this charge with them.

People, stay away from this place and from all the Hard Rock venues as I'm also in the process of disputing another transaction from Vanity that was charged to my account, but this one is for $576.  They're total THIEVES!!  Beware of what you are paying for and always make sure you keep all your receipts, otherwise you would have additional charges that you never authorized.  

Needless to say, I will never, ever, ever in a million years will trust any of the HARD ROCK facilities!!!",z676M4ukSwvvrl2GQ9H_Pg,3,0,1,1C3Ym4eEuJbMdKugkDgrKQ
414428,2009-06-19,0,1VTezD8PLosh-FeNxSRQ7g,"Apparently there have been drastic improvements between the time these reviews were written and when I dined there, last night. My boyfriend and I were loyal AJ's diners, and sad to see it close, but we were anxious to try out Rare 120 and see how it compared. We were absolutely stunned by how great everything was. I needed to push our reservation back an hour because of staying out on the strip too long, and they were very happy to accommodate us.  The host and hostesses were super friendly. Our waiter was named Jonathan, and he worked at AJ's before it closed. Jonathan was not only very knowledgeable of the menu now versus AJ's menu, but gave us great recommendations and was so friendly.  We got a bottle of Seven Deadly Zin's, a zinfandel that my boyfriend and I often get at home, shrimp cocktail, and the crab duo to start. Delicious, delicious, delicious. For our entrees I ordered the 6 oz filet, he ordered the yellowfin tuna, and we split the mashed potato trio. I've been to the best steakhouses in Vegas, Los Angeles, and Texas, and this was by far the most amazing filet I have had that I could remember. His tuna was equally amazing. The mashed potatoes are hard to screw up, but the lobster mashed was the absolute best. We capped it all off with a mini dessert of the Key Lime Pie. It's what God would have eaten everyday if he liked dessert. To die for. We were bid adeu by the Chef, John, at the door and complimented him on our wonderful food. Our only regret was that we hadn't tried Rare 120 earlier on our trip because we left the very next morning. It will definitely be our first stop for dinner when we come back. Thanks!!",-pgJsdaGBNuQC1HB9EtzFA,0,0,5,P8TZBMDv_8GXhSrIreeGdw
449423,2009-05-29,0,1VTezD8PLosh-FeNxSRQ7g,"Ate there last night. We got there at 6:12 and we were told we would have to wait until management finished their meeting. Finally after asking 3 different times what the hold up was they kept claiming that management was in a meeting. Don't know what that has to do with seating a group of 9. It was obvious that the restaurant was pretty empty at this point. 
The point of frustration came when some diners arrived and they were seated. After asking again they finally decided to seat us. Only took 21 minutes to get seated for no reason what so ever. 
Obviously I'm a little pissed off at this point but I wasn't going to let it ruin my dinner. As an old AJ's client I knew that my steak was going to be good. And I wasn't disappointed! The steak was delicious! 
OHH, but the service needs HELP. I think Carl's Jr. has better service. When our food was served the waiters had no idea where to place the food. I can expect this in most restaurants but not a place where you spend a minimum of $60 a head, actually I spent $90. I also ordered another round of Kobe beef meatballs and had to beg for them 3 times, and finally they brought it. After a month of being open I think most of these problems should have been resolved. But it looks like it's going to take longer. I won't go back for at least a year to see if they can get the service issues cleared up.",jfh3se_mh6EWCCHVm4UQ4g,0,0,2,WTIUQMtBCYZEK1C6aSRzhw
528766,2010-01-28,0,1VTezD8PLosh-FeNxSRQ7g,"Ok, my girlfriend calls me up and says she has free dinner at Rare 120 Saturday night. I said count me in. It can't be very pleasant to sit for dinner and you must scream to the person next to you in order to hear them talk. We were forced to listen to super loud 80's music and watch the movie Flashdance. The furniture was made with this cheap plastic coating and I found it very uncomfortable to sit on. Our server was sweet but I got the feeling she was very new to the service industry.  The salad was boring and it felt like it would have been great it they added candied walnuts, goat cheese, and cherry tomatoes. The first piece of steak I got was so rare and rubbery and I had to spit it out. Mash potatoes were served with our platter, they tasted like it had come out of box and lots of butter was added. (Still trying to figure out why all other tables got roasted potatoes and not us.) I found myself staring at this wall that they chose to decorate with empty bottles of alcohol. Like what's the point? The young lady at the front desk was oblivious of her surroundings.

We were provided a salad which had an oil dressing that I was not loving, not a balsamic dressing, just an oil.  And rare steak over rice which was just okay.  Drinks were still on point and service was still great.  Still looking forward to going back for an actual dinner to provide more details but isn't their comp ""tastings"" supposed to entice you to come back??

This place does not mess around! My friends and I usually share a bunch of apps and grab a petite filet mignon. We always leave full and happy. They also have an amazing Sweet Tea cocktail that is to die for!,-cLCsmOIwY3xlxaiPPRegw,0,0,5,QIrZfdb3wbjgizpD6n7_gg
706344,2009-09-06,0,1VTezD8PLosh-FeNxSRQ7g,"It's a shame, this place has great ambiance being in the Hard Rock, with its rock music blaring in. I really wanted to like it, there is just nothing really worth raving about. The food - it's average and overpriced for what it is. I quite simply expected better. 

I started with the Two plus Two, an heirloom and cherry tomato salad with mozzarella and burrata. It was tasty, but big for an appetizer, my plate came with 3 massive balls of cheese on it, a heart attack on a plate! My date had an ahi and hamachi tartare, which was bland. 

I had the King Crab Legs for a main and my hubbie had combo with filet mignon and lobster. We ordered the trio of mash and creamed spinach on the side as the server had recommended 2 sides for 2 people. He must have been upselling as we couldn't even eat one between the 2 of us. 

The mains were the better part of the dinner, the crab portion was massive, but really hard to eat. It was served without a shellfish fork or any other tool to get the meat out. It was partially cracked, but not enough to be of use. I also had to ask the server for a wet towel as no finger bowl was brought to the table. The steak, according to hubby was good. The part that was disturbing was the amount of butter in everything, it made it too rich to eat. The potato tasted overwhelmingly of butter, the spinach was a grease slick and we both had butter sauces served with our meal. 

The main reason why Rare 120 got 2 stars rather than 3 is the service. Our server was unbelievably bad. 

1.We were drinking glasses of no doubt expensive bottled water, and the server came and topped up our glasses with tap water. 

2. When I said something about the water, he came back with a new bottle but left us the glasses still filled with the tap water mix, uh, are we supposed to pass it back and forth between the 2 of us and drink it from the bottle? 

3. When I asked for glasses, he brought us scorching hot glasses. Dude it's a no brainer, change them on the empty table behind you! 

4. We had to ask for pretty much everything that should have been automatic - the water, new napkins, cutlery, drinks, a plate to put all the seafood shells on, something to clean our hands with. It's like the server had never eaten out before and had no idea what people would expect.

Can't say I'll ever give this place a second chance, it's not worth the hundreds of dollars you'll end up spending. Steakhouses are everywhere in Vegas, there is no doubt, better out there.",wTVl4owjHa278i-fxmYcCw,2,0,2,x09n0GyEWKbxdi4Pe_daPw
765859,2009-08-30,0,1VTezD8PLosh-FeNxSRQ7g,"The food is good, not great. But honestly, if your restaurant is called Rare, you shouldn't be overcooking your steaks (2 of 6 on our table). 

The restaurant was apologetic but they only comp'ed us a drink. Also, the bone-in ribeye was pretty heavily salt and peppered.",N-om0Rd8PWC8gJP58HfD6w,0,0,2,_S9uWaoA3iJ8K_VYHhVlOQ
854321,2010-08-08,1,1VTezD8PLosh-FeNxSRQ7g,"We were staying at the Hard Rock hotel & all agreed we were all in the mood for steak, so decided to give this place a shot. It started off good, the pretzel bread they give at the beginning was great & the Spicy Ahi Tartare appetizer was delicious, but then it went downhill from there. 
My hubby & I ordered the Steak Trio for Two, and asked for it to be cooked Medium. It came out looking quite rare, so rare in fact, that it looked the same as the rare steak my friend got. We had to send it back 2 times!!! I have never done that before, and certainly would never expect that at a steakhouse. Meanwhile the whole time, we did not see our waiter. Not sure he even existed. We had ordered a bottle of wine, which we got about halfway through the meal. 

We had ordered the mac & cheese as a side, which we had to wait for as well. When we asked about it, they said they thought we didn't want it. No apology, or anything, just that apparently we were at fault. Our other friend got the filet Mignon which he said had more fat on it than expected for that cut of meat. 

The good: 
-Spicy Ahi Tar tare 
-Mac & cheese  
-Best of Both Worlds (lobster & steak) my friend had he said was good. 
-Pretzel Bread 
-Trio mashed potato's 

The bad: 
-Service, service, service 
-Cooking the steak properly (important for a steakhouse)

We didn't get dessert, we thought it might take another 3 hours to get that. At the end our waiter tried to talk to us, but it was too late. Hopefully they'll improve, they've got a great location.",dvV6fc4m4PoKMYa2NQaSrQ,1,1,1,BHQG_b6Y9990YI2_pLCw8g
879933,2010-06-25,0,1VTezD8PLosh-FeNxSRQ7g,"So, first off, I'm biased because AJ's was my favorite Vegas steakhouse for years. I ate here one time before but it was right at opening so I reserved judgment.

Got a comp for 2 last week after a marathon gambling session. Both got the ribeye, an app (salad, kobe meatballs), and two sides (asparagus, cream spinich). 

Best thing I can say about the above... good not great. It certainly has a hip vibe fitting with the rest of Hard Rock so I'd reccomend it if you're already staying at Hard Rock and either have an expense account, a comp, or just craving a high end steak and don't want to leave the property. 

There's really not much reason otherwise.",C5ReadvmmWYOvMB3RDX3bw,0,0,3,EMJYv3tUwDJ2MYzP5hKKMA

914029,2010-08-30,0,1VTezD8PLosh-FeNxSRQ7g,"My boyfriend and I ate here on a Sunday night  and use our restaurant.com certificate. It was surprisingly busy.

Ambience:
The restaurant was nicely decorated. I liked the large chairs with arms as opposed to regular dining chairs. Lighting was very dark. I did like the projector near the bar area playing movies like ""Weekend at Bernie's"" and ""Top Gun"".

Service:
The hosts and waitstaff are all friendly. For an expensive restaurant, I didn't get a stuck-up or stuffy feeling.

And now for the food:
I loved how they serve pretzel rolls as opposed to regular bread rolls. The butter that accompanied them had a hint of mustard to compliment the pretzels. The mustard flavor was so subtle that my mustard-hating boyfriend didn't mind it.

Appetizer: Rice Cracker Tuna with spicy blood orange-lime aioli.
It was intriguing and the waiter's suggestion sealed the deal. It was delicious. The crispy coating around the sliced pieces of ahi tuna was just right and the aioli flavor complimented the tuna very well.

Entree: Bone-in 18oz ribeye
My favorite cut of meat. So flavorfull. And the seasoning on it was minimally perfect enough to supplement the steak, but not overpower the natural flavor.

Sides:
Mashed potato trio (lobster, truffle, rosemary-parmesan)
I love mashed potatoes and have never tasted mashed potatoes like these. The lobster batch had pieces of lobster mixed in and had a good lobster flavor. The truffle mashed potatoes had a very strong and pungent aroma and flavor. The bf didn't like it, but I felt it was still pretty tasty. The rosemary-parmesan had a less intense flavor, but still very delicious.
Mac and Cheese with 4 cheeses, smoked bacon and sauteed onion
I liked the use of penne pasta as the noodle, and the flavors were good. Just not a standout macaroni and cheese.

Cocktails:
Rita Me 120
Tequila, pomegranate, citronage, and agave-lime juice. A very tasty mix.
Sweet Tea
I don't remember the exact name, but it tasted just like sweet tea. Mmm.

Dessert:
Molten Chocolate Sundae with dulce de leche ice cream
The name and the description is very deceiving. We had to clarify with the waiter, who described it as a brownie/souflee with a chocolate liquid center. We ordered it and it came out and we discovered it was one of the lava cakes. Luckily, this is exactly the type of dessert we were craving, but it was misrepresented.

Overall, a very nice, delicious experience.",0bwmSWsi5WZfcDu61ZMGhg,0,0,4,mczN-ptD3-5EKEx75mDceg
992505,2010-12-21,0,1VTezD8PLosh-FeNxSRQ7g,"Came in for 50% off Mondays. It's an awesome deal, everything on the menu except drinks are half-off. We noshed on a delicious pretzel bread with mustard-butter while we made our picks. We began with Kobe Beef Carpaccio ($14) it was tender, and the sprinkling of truffle, capers and parmesan flavored each bite. We also sampled the Maryland Crab Cakes ($14). Often crab cakes are overwhelmed with bread crumbs, this was not the case; These were meaty cakes. Afterwards, we dug into crisp Iceberg Wedges ($10) topped with applewood-smoked bacon, Point Reyes blue cheese and tossed with red onion and teardrop tomatoes. Then, the main course was served. The Swordfish ($32) with a mango, pineapple and citrus salsa was refreshing and light. The Bone-in Ribeye ($44) was nicely prepared and bursting with bold meaty flavor. Sides of Mac and Cheese ($12) and Broccolini ($8) were also shared.

It was only the broccolini we did not like. It was soaking with butter and overcooked, I make it far better at home. Everything else was tasty. I wouldn't rush back at full-price (better meals can be had on the strip), but at half-off this is a stellar deal. Our bill only set us back $80.",ZsUSGU1-L1ImomLZjXxxTg,3,1,3,sawer8gN8ak-QswY_-72gw

To his server, my server, and the hostess - you couldn't have asked him to stop. I was getting visibly upset over this. Oh wait, you couldn't because you guys disappeared. 

So once this stopped, and the server finally appeared, I ordered the Kobe Meatball lollipops and medium rare filet mignon.

The lollipops looked adorable, but they were covered in some sort of A1 style steak sauce that made all the dipping sauce the pops came with impossible to use. After forcing 2 of them down, I gave up. 

That must mean it's STEAK TIME!!! YAY!!111 Oh did it look amazing. I cut into it and noticed the center was cold. Oh well, I'll take it, close enough right? I take my first bite and it went *crunch crunch crunch* the outside was so burned I was surprised I could taste anything but the char. Oh no, was able to taste a boatload of pepper. I went for another bite, this time not a corner. The inside had a bad taste. Very Bad. It tasted the way I think saliva smells. Gross. One last bite. Third time's a charm right?

I had a bite of pure pepper. I couldn't taste anything but pepper. I drank down all my water to get the taste out. I still tasted it 15 minutes later. At that point I was done.  The server came by asked the problem and I told him that my Sizzler steak had a rotten taste, and was pure pepper. So nice of him to take it away so I didn't have to keep staring at it in disgust.

1285186,2011-04-04,0,1VTezD8PLosh-FeNxSRQ7g,"Alright, first the bad: this place is pretty expensive for no particular reason besides that is it in Vegas--if you plan on going to Vegas and don't want to eat at Denny's, IHOP or a food court, be ready to drop about $30 for each meal... at LEASE, and that is not including drinks... just an entree.  The DJ was rad, but when she went on break the manager or whoever took over and played the SAME song over and over again... I think it was Rhianna or something, but my brain has blocked that out, for self preservation I am sure.  The food was okay and I recommend you do NOT try the french onion soup as you will be unpleasantly surprised.

Now the good, everyone LOVED the drinks here, I believe they had some kind of Kiss drink which was made with champagne, raspberries and other goodness.  I had a wedge salad which was pretty darn good, and the mac'n'cheese is not you usual Kraft style and just ahs a hint of cheese and other flavors topped with breadcrumbs.  the filet-pops are strange but apparently tasted really good.  Someone else got chicken, which they said was only trumped by some they had in Paris a couple years back and the bread to start with was this pretzel bread that was amaaaaazing.

My big pet peeve is restaurants that try to be ritzy and then come up with a menu that only has 8 items on it and they do really tacky things like charging a dollar extra for sauce.  Come on!! I think a 44 dollar steak should cover sauce and a few sides. Nope, Not here. Everything on the menu is a la cart.  So 44 bucks for a steak, 13 for a salad, 13  for some mashed potatoes and  you spent 70 bucks for something you could have gotten for 20 at Outback.  The steak was really good but not 44 dollar.

-Seafood appetizer plater.  Kinda small but YUM. Shrimp, mini lobster (was it half a tail?  not sure...)

They had a bottle of Nebbiolo for around 50, and I was appalled at the low price, but I must have overlooked the fact that it was not Italian- He informed me of this and we went with a Chianti Classico instead, it was a bit hot (boozy) in the beginning, but went excellent with his Filet Mignon and my Lamb Chops. 

***We didn't finish the bottle, but got to take it up to our room. I noticed after about an hour of breathing (being open) it was smooth and velvety and really sexy. Order your wine early on, and let it Breathe, your food will thank you.

I was also really happy to see that they serve The Prisoner, a Cabernet blend, and off the charts delicious. The only reason I passed was to try something new, but if you can't decide on a wine- ask for this BY NAME.

Well, if you have the patience and time, it's worth it. My husband and I brought our two Friends here for dinner last Monday during our first night in Vegas. As our hotel was on the strip, we dished out cab fare to the tune of ten bucks. Still, not bad for the meal. 

We made reservations for 8:45pm and arrived at 8:30 and opted to sit at the bar for drinks before we were seated. The bar had about four patrons and three staff members, yet we didn't get our drinks until about 15 minutes later as my husband went up to request drinks. We sat around waiting to be seated for a good 20 minutes after nine, where the host, as she stated, ""totally forgot about us"". Hmm... okay.

As we were quickly seated, the house began to get full. Our server was very nice and made good suggestions. I chose the Rare 120° House Salad and Tuna as my main course. As appetizers, we shared Kobe Meatball Lollipops and the Broccolini. Loved the Broccolini, could have passed the mushy Kobe pops.

The service is fantastic and we were treated with professional staff.  The first night we went a strong chemical smell was overpowering.  We ended up politely declining.  Even the staff said they were getting a headache.  Apparently they were sealing the pool and it was coming through the vents.  We decided to reschedule our reservation  and they automatically comped us our cocktails and desert the following evening.  The odor was completely gone and we had a great meal.

The salads are huge!  My dining partner had the iceberg wedge and I had the barbeque chicken salad.  Both were way bigger than they probably should be.  The iceberg wedge was pretty standard but the barbeque chicken salad was anything but.  It was loaded with avacado and the barbeque flavor was excellent..  For the main course I had seared scallops and my dining partner had the petite filet.  Both were nicely sized portions and we took food home.  We each ordered a side dish which was a mistake.  The sides are huge and plenty big enough to split.  She had the macaroni and cheese and I had the mushroom pot pie.  The mushroom pot pie was so rich it was like eating desert!  Three bites of it and I was full.  Honestly, I wouldn't recommend it with seafood.  It's heavy and overwhelms a delecate dish but woud have been awesome with the filet.  I tasted the mac and cheese which was also really rich and quite yummy.  We had the Key Lime Pie for desert which was a petite portion but plenty enough.  We both thought the place was a good value. It's a young hip crowd and the music is pretty load.  Don't go her for a quiet romantic dinner but the place is definitely a Hard Rock brand of fine dining.

HOST
We arrive late last night (10pm) to be seated.  The host was busy talking on his mobile which took a few minutes.  No biggie, it must have been important.  He apologized and sat us at a booth.

AMBIENCE
Dark, a tad loud with the casino's music, rock star'ish, and a lot of decorative faux cowhide items.  Sort of kitschy, imo.

FOOD
We were asked what type of water we preferred (table) and were served preztel rolls w/mustard butter immediately.  They were actually pretty good.  

For appetizers, the bf ordered the seafood platter which included a king crab leg, oysters, lobster tail, and some shrimp; I ordered the mini mini 3 which includes three half-dollar sized grilled cheese bites, a tea mug of tomato, and another mug of corn chowder.  Since I'm the only azn in the world who doesn't eat seafood I cannot rate his dish.  My dish was aok.

For entrees, the bf orders scallops over lobster mashed potatoes (or taters as he calls 'em).  He notes the scallops were cooked perfectly and were divine.  I ordered the usual, a 6oz. filet mignon, medium well.  The steak was tender and seasoned well but, perhaps not the best cut of filet--it looked like one of the end pieces.  When it first came out, I almost thought they brought out a sirloin.  As soon as I cut into it and tasted it, I realized it was indeed filet.

The bf and I noticed that none of the tables had salt and pepper shakers.  Luckily, we didn't need them because everything we ordered was seasoned well.

And of course dessert.  We ordered the creme brulee which comes in a trio of caramel, chocolate, and (traditional) vanilla.  The caramel and chocolate almost seemed like puddings with a caramelized sugar crust.  The vanilla was a traditional custard.  Don't get me wrong the dessert trio was still delicious.  Like I mentioned above, the server forgot to bring out the bf's cappuccino :(.  

CONCLUSION
It was a good meal but not worth the prices. I would say the steak quality was that of Outback Steakhouse's (the one at Casino Royale), however the bf thought the seafood was tasty and too small of portions.  Our grand total was $122.  Luckily, we had a $65 comp.  I can't see us returning unless we were given another comp.  I'd rather go to Veloce Cibo at the M Resort for the same price.",g89D3f_9GnTzHPNoxIpuKQ,2,1,3,RIGj9Pvab8GAQe_oVOxRqw

It's a steakhouse that caters to clientele more concerned with getting their drink on in a stylish setting than eating quality food. Don't get me wrong, the food isn't awful, but compared to other steakhouses around town it just doesn't measure up.

The complimentary pretzel bread wasn't warmed up enough. Parts of the outside of each piece were warm but after tearing into it I realized that the inside was cold and the texture of it was overly dense.

The crab cake appetizer came out looking like a deep fried hockey puck. There was plenty of crab meat and not much filler in it, but that didn't make up for it's dry taste

For entrees, I got the braised short rib. It was a huge slab of meat (off the bone) that was almost fork tender, a little too fatty, and was accompanied by an intensely rich sauce that needlessly amplified the saltiness of the beef. My wife got the 6 oz. filet, which turned out to be the best dish of the night. They are a steakhouse, afterall, so they get points for putting out a filet that was tender and had a nice char to it, although it was slightly under seasoned. 

We shared a side of their trio of mashed potatoes. My favorite was the lobster,  which had several succulent chunks of lobster laying on top. The sweet potato mash was decent, and the truffle mash was good for a few bites then the truffle taste become too overwhelming. All were incredibly rich, buttery, and creamy. If you're trying to eat healthy, this isn't the dish for you.

Service throughout the night was spotty. We wanted a second round of drinks but finished our meals before the waiter ever made it back to our table (although he did check in right after we got our food). I have no idea how many tables each server had, but they were clearly understaffed, as evidenced by every single employee speed walking back and forth trying to get everything done.

The highlight of the dinner was the comfy, plush booth we were seated in which made for a cozy dinner and a good spot to people watch.

Damn you restaurant.com for enticing me to come here with your discount gift cards (which our server forgot to deduct until we reminded him).

- hot busty DJs (spinning LOUD, lame top 40 remixes) with their tits spilling out of their corsets

4824109,2010-01-05,3,1VTezD8PLosh-FeNxSRQ7g,"I have eaten here twice since it opened.  

First I have had a lot of different things of the menu and they have all exceeded my food expectations everything is cooked to perfection and presentation is spot on.  While the price it is steep I expect it to be for a fine dining restaurant.  The drinks are costly too but I had the most delicious vodka/cucumber combo that was so tasty and refreshing, that I have to order 3 each time.  They are worth the $12 or so dollars they cost (after 2 who cares what they cost really?!)

My problems with the place is the ambiance this restaurant seems to be suffering from an identity crisis it wants to be a high end restaurant but then have this club type feel to it...when it is indeed a restaurant. 

1-It is so dark you can not read the menu, when I look around seeing people hold a candle to the menu that is not good turn up the lights a tad PLEASE people can't read in the dark.  

2-I can not figure what is going on with the movie screen each time I have been there they show the same movie over and over.  Really it gets old but haha I get it your showing ""Sin City"" in Sin City. 

3-The decor is trendy but it is a bit to much but then again maybe that is why they keep it half dark. The mess of a image behind the bar makes you dizzy before even having a drink.  

4-My last is the way the waitress dress, the uniform is stilettos, shirt buttoned down, bra showing, garter belts and ass hanging out.  Which don't get me wrong I love this cute dressing in a club or from my cocktail waitress in the casino... but in a high end restaurant I don't really want to see if my server is a little overdue for her Brazilian. 
Service is also kind of slow and annoying, I get the impression the servers have not worked at any high end restaurants before just by their demeanor.

I get this is owned by the Dolce group who is very successful but this is like there bastard stepchild they just slapped a bunch of crap together and said ""yeah we have a restaurant in Vegas now"".

Here is what we ordered:

Kobe beef carpaccio- OMG WIN! WIN! WIN! The beef was thin and delicious covered in truffle oil, parmesean, and arugula. The portion was really large. I am sorry that I didn't just order 5 plates of this for myself instead of the steak trio...I would have been much happier.

Rare Steak Trio for Two - the trio consists of a filet mignon, new york strip, and kobe hangar steak. We ordered the steaks medium rare but only the filet was cooked properly...we had to kick back the NY and hangar. The filet was like butter and really delicious. It took a ridiculously long time to get our other 2 steaks back. They eventually arrived at the correct temperature but the hangar steak was inedible because it was so stringy and tough.

Rare 120 Herbed Fries - good fries covered in chives, thyme, parsley, and rosemary.

We were celebrating a birthday and they brought us out a trio of mini desserts (german chocolate cake, brownie smores,  and tiramisu) with candles on top which was very nice.

Our server was very friendly, attentive, and professional. The manager came out and apologized about the steaks. Best part of the evening was that they were showing the movie Flashdance on the wall.

When I go out I want to eat something I can't make. I know that eating at any hotel will automatically tack on an additional $40 per person, but I would have much rather eaten at Outback Steakhouse. Of course there is the ""party"" atmosphere that the Hard Rock is known for, but I've had better steak at Firefly. Service was just fine, but nothing to write home about. I did like the decor though. They start you off with pretzel bread with a dijon mustard butter. I don't like mustard, but this was unique. I got the bone in rib-eye and it was just ok. Also got the mashed potato trio and the creamed spinach. Hated the creamed spinach and the mashed potatoes were good, but again not any better than mashed potatoes at Applebee's. I also had a drink (I think it was called Dragonfly) that was probably the highlight of the meal. Very refreshing like a Cosmo meets pink lemonade.

Since it seems this comped meal thing is a normal fixture at Rare 120, figure I'd spell out how it works and whatnot so others don't feel they got ""scammed"" because they didn't understand the rules. 

Regarding the decor - agree with Genevieve M. that the decor is ""heinous"". The music was way too loud - kinda like being in a club. Do NOT make the mistake of doing a business dinner here - you can barely hear yourself think! 

If you have a promoter offer you a comped dinner.. this will take place in the lounge. The lounge is ""cute"" and pretty comfy, so no problems here. Our group of 20 girls showed up around 8:45 PM and didn't have to wait on a Friday night. Dinner started out on a great note. A delicious salad and yummy pretzel rolls. THEN the steak comes. There were 15 of us at my table and they served us about 24 oz of meat.. split amongst 3 plates. Each plate had 1 cup of rice on it. So yeah... 24 oz of meat + 3 cups of rice for 15 people. Maybe models can get full on these portions, but normal people cannot! I was glad that being the fatty that I am, I had planned ahead and eaten some tapas earlier in the evening fully expecting the food at Rare 120 to suck. The steak was actually *good* for a free steak. Good flavor, well prepared.. but my 1.5 oz portion was kind of ridiculous. Really loved that 1/8 cup of rice too.. HA

Things got annoying at the end, too. We had all tipped $10/head before dinner to take care of the staff. We got the drink bill and it had another 20% tacked on there. Apparently the $200 tip we had already left wasn't enough.. ugh. so had to shell out more money for our crappy drinks. On a side note, I asked for ""vodka soda with lime"" and was brought vodka soda with lemon. I realize I'm being nit-picky but for $10, I expected my miniature drink to be made correctly. 

Thanks Rare 120 for the free ""dinner"", but I'd call it more of a snack honestly! I feel like it was fair value for $25 (what I ended up paying for my vodka soda + tips), but I'd NEVER pay full price to dine her. It's ugly, service wasn't great, and the food was nothing to write home about.

Our entire dinner was just AMAZING:

Filet Mignon- so, so, so tender.  Just melted in your mouth!

Lobster Quesadilla- Ohhh so good with goat cheese and mango-jicama salsa.  And they had a real spicy kick to them, which I loved.

Crab Cakes- 2 smallish cakes but VERY filling.  Crispy and golden on the outside, perfectly cooked on the inside and the sweet sauce (papaya mustard) to go with was delicious.  

Creamed Spinach- Most amazing I've ever had, seriously.  Creamy but not heavy, deliciously seasoned and it had chunks of thick applewood-smoked bacon in it.  I wanted to eat another plate full!!!

Spicy Corn- came with roasted peppers, thai chilis, and cilantro.  Not the best corn ever but it was pretty damn tasty.

Broccolini w/garlic and chilis-  I love broccoli but have never had broccolini before.  This plate was delicious and perfectly seasoned with a slight crunch. 

Green & White asparagus- the only way to screw up asparagus is to over cook it so they're all limp and gross.  These most definitely were crunchy and hot.

As for cocktails, my girls enjoyed just vodka crans but I tried the Ultimat Dill which has ultimat vodka, agave-lime juice, fresh dill, and cucumber. Well made and very tasty!

5549967,2010-05-30,1,1VTezD8PLosh-FeNxSRQ7g,"Decided tonight to break out the restaurant.com certificates and we ended up here for steak.  I wouldn't say this was a completely awful meal but there were some weird stuff going on that bothered me.  However, this is the cheapest steakhouse meal I've eaten since we moved to town last October.

First of all, I loved that when we walked in they were playing 80's alternative that I still listen to on repeat every day such as Smiths, Depeche Mode, Kajagoogoo, and all that good stuff in the lounge that played into the restaurant.  I'd go here just for drinks in the lounge if that's what they play all the time.  That music is the bomb.

Then we sat down and ordered drinks, I had a Ketel One Martini, which was decent, and they served us pretzel bread with mustard butter.  I have a weakness for pretzel bread, its my favorite.  The mustard butter was kinda neat too, but it wasn't amazing.  It gave a nice little mustardy bite to my bread that actually made me dip into the bread basket more than once which I don't normally do.

Next, we ordered the caesar salad with pizza croutons.  I was going to just get the normal salad with vinaigrette, but husband was curious about the pizza croutons.  The croutons were toasted bread with a small layer of melted cheese on them and some italian/pizza seasonings.  It was unique and nice but not the best caesar I've had by far.  The dressing was nice and light and not too creamy.

We ended up sharing this dish called the ""Rare Steak Trio for Two,"" which was their full size 10 ounce fillet, a huge 16 ounce New York Strip AND the 10 ounce Kobe Flat Iron for only $80 bucks.  What a good deal that ended up being because there was so much meat we couldn't come close to finishing it.  Both the fillet and the NY strip were pretty good and thick and very rare.  Next time I'll go with the medium rare though.  

However, the big disappointment of the night that still perplexes me is the Kobe Flat Iron.  It was really awful.  So bad that my husband and I both took a bite and didn't touch it the rest of the evening.  It was tough, and the chimichurri rub on it tasted like complete ass.  I've had kobe flat iron a few other places before, and I don't understand how kobe can ever be tough.  You'd have to really screw it up to have it come out that bad.  It was rare and should have been tender and flavorful, so I can't figure out how this restaurant actually served a tough kobe flat iron, unless it really wasn't authentic kobe beef!  The server saw we hadn't touched the kobe and asked if it was ok and my husband, being a huge wuss that night, didn't say anything.  So I got stuck being the mean one and said ""well, it was really tough and didn't taste good.""  They tried to comp us dessert but we declined so they comped our cocktails which was nice.

We ended up getting out of there only paying $80 bucks with our $50 dollar restaurant.com certificate which is a steal for a Las Vegas Steakhouse.  I would come back but I wouldn't touch the kobe flat iron with a 10 foot pole.",PomQayG1WhMxeSl1zohAUA,7,3,3,jpzw2U5Bpj2hA34iyunY0w

The decor is heinous, people.

That being said, the food was pretty mediocre.  We ordered the iceburg wedge salad, the beef carpaccio, the 6 oz filet, a basket of fries and two glasses of prosecco.  

The beef carpaccio was by far the best thing we had.  It was very crisp and refreshing, and it came served with truffle oil which automatically makes it delicious.  The filet was underwhelming....a bit lifeless, sitting there on the plate in a sad little heap.  After having the mesquite-grilled steak at Strip Steak, this bland little slab just did not satisfy.  It had no seasoning whatsoever.  The fries were the most disappointing thing however; they came out soggy.  The iceburg salad was A-OK.  Two iceburg wedges drenched in blue cheese dressing.

So we unfortunately have to leave after enjoying the nice décor in an almost completely emptied dining area (it was only about 530ish on a Saturday night), view of their impressively looking wine selection, and reading about the wonderfully tasty description of the surf and turf entrees, appetizers and desserts they offer.

The waitstaff was very professional, when they learned that we were actually looking to have prime rib for dinner, and recommended to check out the cafe at Hard Rock as an option.
