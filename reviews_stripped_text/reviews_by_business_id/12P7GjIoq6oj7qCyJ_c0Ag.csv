22532,2017-10-16,0,12P7GjIoq6oj7qCyJ_c0Ag,The worst pizza place. Take note that you can call in an order come to pick it up and they give your pizza away and you have to wait 10 mins for them to make another. Second time I ordered online said for me to pick it up at 7:05pm got here at 7:15 they gave my pizza away again even though I already paid online in advance. I rather go to Papa John's less stress and I get my pizza before the estimated  time. Oh and hot n ready pizzas are never ready there's a wait.,yKZwXHFdc98zwsxiQ6YkuA,1,0,1,07A7CEzmWdZZap37bRCRVA
346062,2012-09-25,5,12P7GjIoq6oj7qCyJ_c0Ag,"Let's be straight- you only get Little Caesars because you are broke, desperate for something fast to eat, throwing a party, or you're fond of mediocre pizza.  I fall into the broke/desperate to eat categories.

Little Caesars isn't terrible.... I've certainly paid more for crappier pizza (by accident, of course- not because I enjoy torturing my wallet and taste buds).  But I don't think there's really anyone out there that says, ""Man, I sure could go for some Little Caesars right now!""  Basically, it's tasty enough to make you think your $6 was not wasted.  Nothing more than that.  

For this particular location, we've never had to wait for a hot-n-ready and we are usually in and out pretty quickly.  The employees are your typical fast food employees- not the most professional service in the world but fine enough to make a cheap pizza and swipe your credit card.",ELfzWgdf64VBLi5z1ECItw,3,7,3,2p8gfWCfbYJk9wEcW_1F4g

1639994,2016-04-09,0,12P7GjIoq6oj7qCyJ_c0Ag,"This place deserves 5 stars because it's the best little Cesar's I've ever been to. The people are nice and very speedy. The longest I've ever waited for a hot and ready is 5 mins. Every thing is always cooked fine. I really prefer this location over the one on Durango. I've never had a problem here - there I've had many. Thanks to girl with black and purple hair and brown hair with braids for being awesome on 4/8 during a huge rush. 

Edit: okay, just finished getting my pizza and I've literally never seen this location so busy. I was told it would be a 10 min wait and it was again barely 4 mins but it was super packed!

2173140,2017-12-06,0,12P7GjIoq6oj7qCyJ_c0Ag,"""Hot and ready"" is a joke, but even more so on busy days (football Sunday/probably weekends in general). Unprofessional staff that doesn't know how to monitor and call out orders correctly. We watched as people who came waaay after us get their large orders before we did. It was ridiculous since we ordered one thing. The young lady tried to lie saying she called my name, probably to cover herself up in front of her manager next to her. Funny thing is we never left the waiting area, and no name sounded anything close to mine. Only gave two stars because the pizza is good for the value.",vzynGd-Vcl5gf59xJvUZZQ,1,0,2,C87H7qUlEEEXWgFS4g_DGw

I paid and was told it would be about 10 min. How convenient. I only get a half hour lunch since I work from home. Hot and ready means they should have product ready when you walk in the door, not make and cook it once it's ordered.

I tried calling this location several times and no one answered the phone. I had checked out their website and reviewed their vegetarian options and was very happy to see that they accommodate those of us who don't wish to eat mean. However, in their haste to slap together my bland tasting pizza they must not have been paying much attention because I found random pieces of sausage on my veggie pizza. Needless to say I was mortified that I had put meat in my mouth! Sure, it's cheap pizza and my teenaged daughter could really care less about quality, but I do. Perhaps if they actually had ""adults"" working there rather than a bunch of teenagers (I've never seen an adult working any time I've been by there to get pizza for my daughter) they would have better quality control over how the pizzas are being made. Needless to say - I doubt I'll ever eat there again. My daughter, I'm sure will want the random pepperoni pizza, but no thanks, I'll pass.

2659267,2015-10-02,6,12P7GjIoq6oj7qCyJ_c0Ag,"I very much wavered between giving this place 2 or 3 stars. I opted for 3 mainly due to the sheer entertainment value that it provides and lately the service has been much better than it used to be. 

A nice takeout fast food pizza joint that I am old enough to remember back in the 1980's serving square pizza. Those days are long gone and what now puts them on the map is $5 large pepperoni pizzas available ""Hot 'n Ready"" for immediate pickup and a great last minute family dinner value. For $3 more you can opt for the ""Three Meat Treat"" or Deep Dish, but I recommend calling ahead for those as they are often not available for immediate pickup. 

This restaurant was largely remodeled a while back and now has dark wood fixtures and displays. The staff is young and not particularly customer friendly but adequate and efficient. It is often entertaining when you call or walk in as you can often hear and see the kids yelling at each other over various things. Oh to be young again...

I've been a customer of this Caesars for years and must say that service has improved greatly. There was a time when it would be busy and even after calling ahead, you could expect a half hour to 45 minute wait time. That seems to be alleviated now as I always call ahead and my order is usually available for pickup upon arrival. 

Overall, I recommend this place for a quick value pizza and a particularly efficient last minute dinner choice for the family. Just remember to call ahead to be safe.",xEbCNG-3GTw-OxFusnVP9g,11,10,3,Jr7VPB5C3l6ZfaUCtYiGsA

I called in an order. ""Ready in 10/15 minutes.""
When I get there, and I give them my name, one employee starts to pull my order, then says she forgot something. Puts the pizza back in the warmer rack and runs to the back. So I sit for a minute. Another employee comes and pulls the pizza and gives it to a customer that just walked in and ordered. 
First employee comes out from the back and can't find the pizza I ordered and has to make another one. 
I was waiting 30 minutes in the store and got there 15 minutes after I placed my order. 
Just don't call in your order!!!
Walk in and they'll give you what's ready. If it's someone's else's order or not.
