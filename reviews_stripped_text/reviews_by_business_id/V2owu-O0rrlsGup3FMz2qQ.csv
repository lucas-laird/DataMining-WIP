Very Very good, but what stood in my mind the most was the young man that waited on me.  I was ordering lunch for two other people to take back to work and he saw me struggling with handling 3 drinks, so he offered me a beverage carrier!  Then he ran and opened the door for me since he saw my hands full.  

Just saying great customer service!  Kudos to a great employee.",6u7oygtrd2-t2IS_WLE6UA,0,0,5,OAHo-UUTBv2aPLPykSl5zQ

All of my burritos lacked the usual sour cream and buffalo sauce and was terribly wrapped, and I might've expected it from the drive through but I took the time to go in with friends and this is the put out they show the world to reflect the brand.

2196374,2014-12-22,1,V2owu-O0rrlsGup3FMz2qQ,"I'm absolutely APPALLED at this Taco Bell! I used to actually frequent it rather often, but went on a bit of a fast food hiatus. I had a craving for Taco Bell and thought, ""why not?""

Oh, I found out ""why not"" in short order! First- the wait at the drive through was kind of ridiculous. Not just sitting in the line of cars, but once I'd placed my order, I sat at the window for quite awhile waiting for the food to be ready. When you're hungry and in a hurry, that's not the best thing. It is called ""fast food"" for a reason, right? Apparently not here.

Ok, food obtained. I get home, get settled, and go to open the mini chicken quesadilla. WHAT THE HELL IS THIS? First of all, the cheese is so melted that I can barely unrwrap the aluminum foil. Once I do get it open...my stomach lurched. The pile of BURNED, gooey, mess that is in the foil is absolutely disgusting. I can't believe that anyone thought it was a good idea to pass this off as food and serve it to anyone. I took (and posted) a picture, but it went straight into the garbage.

The chalupa was luckily in good shape, and the only reason this wouldn't get a ZERO star review. (other than the fact that we can't award zero stars here).  Obviously, I won't be returning.",lQGJcwX105k17081f6pulg,1,0,1,kez5X_Bn0vDg1GwSNIPSoQ

When I got home and spread the food out for the family I found out the order was not complete. I was missing the two chicken soft tacos for one of the children. I left the family to eat their dinner and drove all the way back to the restaurant. It is 10 minutes away. I asked for the manager and told her what I was missing. She said she remembered the order but was more interested in placing blame. She made the food and literally said here. Not a sorry or anything else. My food was cold when I got home and everyone else had eaten except for the children and me. Thanks for ruining my dinner.

I ordered a protein burrito fresco style without rice. I get to the window only to be asked if I wanted rice in my bowl to which I confusedly respond ""I didn't order a bowl but if the burrito has rice...then no I don't want it"". I waited 5 more minutes to have a second person come to the window and asked if I had two orders. ""Uh no...(but I would like my single order that I have been waiting on"" only to have him look at a bag in front of him and shove it in my direction. So let's recap...I ordered a protein chicken burrito and 10 minutes later I received a burrito with nothing but tomatoes, lettuce, and beans . Great job guys...the only thing more frustrating than your obvious confusion for how to construct a burrito was knowing that I wasted 10 mins of my life and money only to have to still get something somewhere else.",QXFn2-Yp3NclQCNr8jyl3Q,0,0,1,5mLEJt1SHu1cfDVdoauFXg

I waited 20 minutes (20 full minutes!) in the drive thru. Keep in mind, this is a Tuesday night and there were only 3 cars ahead of me. It's not like there was a line of cars around the block. 

When I FINALLY got up to the window, I received no apology, no explanation for the wait, no flustered cashier. What I got was the familiar blank stare of a fast food employee with zero fucks left to give.

It's very unusual for me to go to Taco Bell especially a second time in less than 3 days. 

The 1st time I ordered I was RAVENOUS and I asked if there was anything healthy vegetarian - Chris the manager recommended the Cantina Veggie Bowl - I got the cilantro sauce and guac on the side. It's really good! (Reminds me of the naked vegetarian burrito from Qdoba) Black beans, some rice, lettuce, corn salsa, pico de gallo and cilantro green sauce. Very tasty. The manager cracked up when he saw my Bears jersey and was talking about Chicago because he is from there too. Very nice guy. 

Came back today for the bowl and it again is quite good - I looked online at the nutritional information and if  you don't eat the guac or cilantro sauce you can cut a lot of those calories and fat.

I called the main number which was answered after the twentieth ring simply ""hello "". After confirming it was a Taco Bell a young man said hold on for the manager . Then, another young voice entered into earshot and said ""man hang up! Why did you answer ?"". The phone was promptly hung up without comment. Then it rang over and over for no answer still...

Went in today for my replacement order after I called again the next day and was told to come by, that they had my name on a list to fix my order. After ordering the man at the window stepped aside to let a 50 ish Woman chastise me for not having a receipt . When I called earlier the man I spoke with took my name , order number and said to give my name at the window. No receipt was asked for other than my order number. 
She actual told me ""she would give me the FREE food , but not to come here again expecting it"". I explained to her a male manager on Saturday had told me to come in, and she responded they didn't have any men at that location. It went downhill from there.
