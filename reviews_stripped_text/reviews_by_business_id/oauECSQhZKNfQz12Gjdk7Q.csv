My favorites are the curries, but my girlfriend loves the garlic pepper chicken and veggies with extra garlic. One downside is they need to spend more effort in keeping the restrooms clean- often not a good first impression.

The parking lot was not full and so I took this a lucky sign.  Rarely (VERY), do I ever get lucky parking and on this particular occasion I litterally parked in the front of the front door.

I was reminded of this again, last night, as we walked into another Thai restaurant closer to our home, and 6 people pushed in front of us declaring they had reservations for a table of 27, which I guess entitled them to be seated first. Color them rude! So, my husband and I decided to ditch the place as fast as we could and find a new restaurant. 

We were on our way to the Phil at the Smith Center and had limited time. Flamingo was right on our way to the I-15, and Thai Spice came immediately to mind!  It is in the strip mall adjacent to the Palms Casino. We should have thought of Thai Spice in the first place. The atmosphere is relaxed, the hostess warm and friendly, we got to sit anywhere and chose ""our table""..which is a joke as we have only been here 4 times, yet we found the cozy table for 2 by the window that I always pick available for our dining pleasure. Our server got us in and out in so we comfortably made the drive up to the Smith Center in time for the show.

Now the food. It is scrumptious and leaves no doubt as to why the Thai Spice has been ranked Vegas top Thai restaurant for many years in a row. Try the egg rolls, they taste homemade. Look at the loving care that they put in carving a carrot into a beautiful flower to accompany the plating. Order the Pad Thai and rediscover the joy of eating.

Even though we were in a larger group, 3 of us decided to share some of their dishes to get a taste of several things.  We started with the Chicken Satay and Potstickers.  I cannot stress how much I love the peanut sauce that accompanies the chicken satay.  Needless to say I really liked them and would order them again.  The potstickers had a cabbage filling which surprised me since I was used to them having a meat filling.  It was all good.  It basically had the flavor of an egg roll.

For our entrees we split the Drunken Noodle with beef as well as the Yellow Curry Combo.  The drunken noodle dish was compiled of a flat noodle, plenty of beef & vegetables.  Again, I'm not the expert but I thought they did a great job!   

When we ordered the Yellow Curry Combo we wanted a spice level of 7.  The waitress didn't think we could handle that spice so she suggested a 4 or 5.  Now our group liked spice.  The dish certainly needed more of a heat level.  They brought out some of the spice so we could add it ourselves.  I thought that was a little odd.  I still enjoyed the flavor of the yellow curry without the spice before we added more.  

Beside the spice snafu, our service was good.  They were very polite and attentive.  Thank you Thai Spice for furthering my education on thai food.",xhhE0txKwQtRzgQVVdKkvg,7,10,4,NnVarOxU5-UF8z_Q44At-w

Being it was cold outside and I absolutely LOVE soup, I asked the aging server and customer, ""Which soup is that?'' The server rudely said, "" We no serve to public!"" Well!

Came in with a large group and everyone seemed pretty satisfied with their food, I found their papaya salad and shrimp pad thai to be on par with others in town. But I was downright impressed with the catfish curry and the whole fried pompano- they're not especially complicated dishes but well-executed, cooked so the fish wasn't dried out and the sauces were robust and at the specified spice level (7/10). I will definitely be back for the catfish, and love that they have several seafood dishes including a soft shell crab salad.

Service was efficient even considering our large group (~20), and made good recommendations. Lunch specials are available, as is online ordering through Yelp with Eat24.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,13,9,4,w3vAbuvXGjGiztPc2af2vA

Although their other menu items looks really good it is a ways out for me to come here just for their Thai food. It is located near the strip on Flamingo and Arville across the street from The Palms Place and next to caboose or something. The Resturant has a mix match hodge podge decor and the staff is friendly enough. 

We normally come here for their lunch special because it's the closest Thai place close to our work. The Lunch menus is not huge but it comes with a tiny salad, a veggie eggroll, a little bit of rice, soup of the day (which is never exciting) and a entree of your choice. The food is ok and the other side that comes with it is bare minimum but I guess what is there to complain about when the meal is about $7 bucks right? Thai tea is good not consistent in taste and sweetness and the wait sometime during lunch is forever.

All in all you get what you pay for unless you get an actually order of their regular egg rolls which is now my Ultimate favorite. An order of 6 egg rolls filled with the typical filling fried battered and then deep fried again and their is only one other place that does them like this and it is in Clovis Ca at Sun Rise Kitchen. Needless to say I was VERY stoked to see these egg rolls like this especially when I wasn't expecting much from them. So that I am in love with.

I love when they put pineapples in curry, they add a subtle sweetness that really brings the dish together. I originally asked for the lunch special, but because I wanted pineapples with my curry, they made me purchase the dinner portion. I was a bit put off by this, for one I had no need for that much food at lunch, and for two, why? I didn't think that the curry received from the lunch special menu would be any different than the dinner menu, but alas it must be true. 

Honestly I didn't want the soup and small salad that came with the lunch special anyway, plus now I have dinner covered so it all worked out. On a spiciness scale of 1-5 I got a 2 and it could have been much hotter. Still tasty nonetheless.

2621923,2011-08-03,0,oauECSQhZKNfQz12Gjdk7Q,"After waiting so long for the reopening, Thai Spice was a big disappointment. The food was bland, unoriginal, and pretty much what I don't look for in Thai food.  Going with a group of friends mostly versed in Thai food, we proclaimed that Thai Spice won't be a reoccurring lunch spot.  We ordered the Pad See Ew ($9.95, and had some goofy name on the menu), the Green Curry Beef ($10.95), the Larb Pork ($9.96), the Chicken Fried Rice ($9.95), and the One Sun Beef jerky ($8.95).  Everything was ordered with ""medium spice"" and ""Thai style"".

The Pad See Ew was served without Chinese broccoli as an option. The sauce was some sort of a generic Chinese style teriyaki sauce.  The chicken was bland.  There was no spice, and even with gobs of their chili powder (which we had to ask for), there still wasn't much flavor or heat.  Pad See Ew is an easy dish, and somehow Thai Spice still makes it bland.  Unfortunately, this was the best dish of the meal.

The Green Curry with Beef was also a miss.  Lightly sweet and without much flavor at all, or spice, it was boring to eat.  Just plain boring.  The occasional bell pepper was the only thing that gave this dish any interesting flavor. I have had worst tasting curries, but this one was probably one of the blandest curries I have ever had.  What's the point of eating this again?

The Larb with Pork was border line gross.  It was the most offensive dish that we had, and one of my friends just plain couldn't stand it.  The flavor was off.  It had a lot of vinegar, along with a poorly balanced blend of herbs that were just totally unappealing.  Again, no heat at all to even cover up the bad flavor.  Do yourself a favor and don't order the larb here.

The chicken fried rice was unoffensive.  It was also bland as heck.  The chicken was dry, and there was no flavor to speak of.  Is this food for 5 year olds?

Yeah, the jerky wasn't good either.  The sauce was uninspiring and overly salty.  The meat tasted of poor quality.  I had to convince my one friend who had never had Thai jerky before that it is actually really good at some other places.

Thai Spice is some of the most bland ""Thai"" food I have ever had, and Americanized to boot.  There were a lot of Chinese dishes on the menu.  You might want to just stick to the Chinese stuff.  If you're looking for Thai flavors, go somewhere else.",wOGfOjBaP-lCS1NW_En2LQ,3,0,2,oXG4QvatQ4hTR6HxpJdPRg

OUR FIRST VISIT
couldn't have been better! We came here on a whim one night for dinner when we happened to just be driving around trying to find a place to eat. We walked in here and the place was completely empty, but we were greeted with big smiles and seated right away while another server was already filling up our glasses with water. Usually I find it a little awkward to be the only customers since the servers tend to just stare or or look annoyed and it also seems like the place is empty because it probably isn't good, but that wasn't the case for this place. The fact that we were alone in there actually made it quite nice since we got complete attention and excellent service. 

We ordered the Nevada Chicken - Tender, boneless, chicken breast fillet in a light curry-peanut sauce for $7.95
and
Pad Thai - Soft pan-fried translucent noodles cooked with chicken, shrimp, ground peanuts and ground chili pepper. Garnished with fresh bean sprouts for $7.95

The Nevada Chicken was so sexy! Juicy chicken breast with peanut sauce. It makes me salivate just thinking about it! It was exactly like the description.  It even came with a side of white rice which was nice since we didn't order any rice with our meal. We both loved it!

The Pad Thai I just couldn't get enough of. All of the different flavors and textures in it went together so well in my mouth, mmm! I loved the crunchiness of the peanuts and bean sprouts, it definitely added to the burst of flavors. 

Normally we would've ordered more than just two plates of food, like an appetizer and dessert and probably thai tea, but this was more than enough for us. We were able to finish it all without having to take anything home, which was good since we were staying at a hotel on the strip that night anyway. The portion filled us up just right and we were oh so satisfied!
 

THE SECOND VISIT
Pure disappointment... 

The service was, well, lacking SERVICE. It took them at least 10 minutes to greet us and give us a place to sit. The place wasn't even full, probably just a 3rd of it was full and that was just on the left side where they were seating everyone. Their greeting wasn't exactly welcoming. We were standing at the front of the restaurant waiting to be seated and the girl just came up to us and said ""can I help you?"" WTH. It's a restaurant, I think it's an obvious reason as to why anyone would be in there, but I wasn't about to say ""yes you can help me by filling my stomach and quitting your job so I don't have to see your face again,"" so I just bit my tongue and said ""table for 3."" 

We were seated and we decided what to order right away since it was just off the lunch special menu, but it took forever to finally get our order relayed since the waitress just sat us then neglected us. It seemed as though she even avoided us while we were calling her at some points since she'd look at us and just turn away. She finally came and she just seemed to be in another dimension or something. We told her ""we want the pepper steak level 4"" then she said ""okay level 4, what level spicy?"" That was just confusing. We went back and forth a few times repeating what level we wanted then she'd repeat that same question. She got the rest of our order and left. 

I don't remember what else we ordered other than pepper steak and pad thai. That might've been it actually. We got to orders of pad thai since my bf and my brother both wanted their order spicy (level 8) and I can't go higher than a 4 lol. 

Since it took so long for the food to come, we decided we wanted to get an appetizer AND we also wanted our glasses of water filled since the cups were already empty for a while and the ice was starting to melt. We kept signaling to the waitress but she's just walk by and look the other way or look at us and look away, it was really awkward, we were beginning to wonder if we were just trippin' or if it was her. We all agreed it was her, ha. Maybe it was just that she was too young and couldn't handle multitasking. Whatever it was definitely didn't leave a good impression on us. 

The pad thai was good, but not great like the first time we went.   The pepper steak I don't even remember, so it mustn't have been all that great. We never  get our appetizer, so I can't comment on that. 

It kinda sucked because my boyfriend and I took my brother here to eat because we had such a good experience with bombass food the first time we came so we thought he'd love it too, but they totally flipped it on us and made it a bad experience with bad service and mediocre food. We had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing, but was quickly disappointed. He even said it wasn't as good as we were telling him and we told him we didn't expect it to be like this.

If you guessed that Thai Spice serves Thai food, you'd be absolutely correct. They're one of the older establishments in its cuisine in Las Vegas, having started in 1994 and been named as best Thai restaurant by something or other through 2007. It's easy to take the cynical guess that they went downhill after that point, but they're still around in a market notorious for turnover, aren't they?

What first caught my attention during the meal, other than the warm if quaint decor, was the true family-run aspect. Younger seemed to be playing behind the counter, and older ones were helping with various duties. My water certainly stayed full for most of the night. It's easy to root for a place like this to succeed, which is perhaps part of their charm

I didn't plan to go crazy for this meal, so I just shared a couple of dishes to get the lay of the land.

Green Curry with Chicken ($10.95): this isn't anything to write home about, and it's not actually that green, but it's a solid take on the dish. Zucchini may not be traditional, but it was an especially juicy and fun addition. Chicken was white meat all the way. Rice was fine, and spiciness of 3 out of 10 actually tasted mild to me, aside from one concentrated bite.

Thai Spice Beef ($11.95): their namesake dish, and deservedly so. It starts and pretty much with the marinated tender beef, which is predominantly sweet. They don't even ask for a spicy level because it's zero. The other main element is the bed of crispy rice noodles. They don't have much of their own flavor, but they're so crunchy. Perhaps it's not the most traditional or authentic Thai recipe, but I'll take an addictive Americanized dish any day if it's this delicious.

Thai Spice won't ever be my first choice, but only because it's farther from me than several other Thai restaurants. Reactions from elsewhere around the table seemed positive too, and I've jotted a few notes in the back of my head in case I should find myself here again. It's well worth the consideration if you're in the area and want something relatively cheap (and/or walkable from the Palms Casino).",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,6,7,4,5R68zpb4CAsEzVx5EIsT3A

I ordered two appetizers and when I bit into them, it was cold in the center. Not what I was hoping for. I ordered 5 bottled waters for us and there was only 2 available. Really? 

I placed my order and as everyone's food was being served, the waiter then decides to tell me that my dish is not available; chicken with baby corn. I'm now begin to lose my appetite and get frustrated. 

My buddies are waiting for food to come and it takes a while. Why, the place is empty!!! They claim the food is ok, but I feel it taste like fast food low quality products.

For whatever reason, we hadn't been back until Saturday afternoon.  

Thai Spice is a large restaurant, that is open, and very clean.  

Service is very polite, and very quick. 

We ordered:
Pork Egg rolls
Shrimp and Chicken Pad Thai
Thai Spice Beef.  

The pork egg rolls were very good.  They were not greasy.  They were crisp, and flavorful, and the deep fried egg roll wrapper had almost a tempura flavor: very light and delicious.  The duck sauce that was served with them was good as well. 

Shrimp and Chicken Pad Thai:
I always have to order Pad Thai at a new spot...its usually a really good way to judge the rest of the dishes.  This was almost perfect.  Flavorful, just the right amount of spice, and the noodles were cooked perfectly.   The only issue?  Only 2 shrimp.  When I order something called ""shrimp and chicken"" I want there to be more than 2 pieces of shrimp.  Since my husband and I split the entrees, we each only got one.  

Thai Spice Beef: Lean strips of beef marinated in royal thai sauce, sauteed and served on top of rice crispy noodles...this is Thai Spice's signature dish, and it is DELICIOUS.  The meat is tender.  The rice noodles are crisp, and crunchy, giving a pleasant texture, and the sauce...YUM.  That's about all I can say without drooling.  

The Thai Iced Coffees are good too, and a large ""to go"" coffee is enormous.  

Thai Spice, well done.  I can't wait to come out again, to try more items!!!",renPzRDqMZpMaHiCD_e1_A,5,5,4,q5O7CN9U_UFRzbn7ypPhZQ

The meat is either overcooked or undercooked in this place. The service is rather invasive and not very quick. It is your run of the mill place with below average food and very limited ethnic decor. The place has a medicinal feel to it. 

I would not recommend this place. There are truly superior Thai places in Vegas to waste your money on this one; I reviewed a couple of them already. Everything is a bit pricey here, especially for what you get. There is nothing good about this place, and overall, it is slighly below average.",wJWTjNLKFZIhq0OTXGQrsQ,2,0,2,IvL8GzZET3yiy8hAiiTZ6w

We got there when it was rather quiet and mostly empty. The music and environment was calm and soothing. Our super-young waitress ""Willow"" welcomed us with a smile and perfect English, and gave us dinner suggestions. She was really helpful and friendly, and also CUTE as a button.

We had the Beef Curry and the Drunken Noodles, which were both DELICIOUS. Now, my beef curry was supposedly at spicy level 7, which was almost too hot for me. But that was my mistake, because back in Philly I once had a place serve me food at spicy level 5, and it tasted like they put nothing at all in it. Anyway... our meal was AMAZING, the meats were tender and juicy, and by my request Willow even brought me an extra small bowl of rice (at no extra charge, I found out later much to my surprise). The bill itself was very reasonably priced... $11 for each entree, and like $2 for each fresh baby coconut. We got about half our food to-go (and I am glad we did).

I wish we'd taken more pictures of the food. Our experience reminded me that I always have a good time when I visit restaurants in Las Vegas.

His food also came a very long time before mine did and I was starving. And 2 lunches were $40 with the tip. Panang $13, fried rice $13, iced tea, and eggrolls $?.

Been a few years since I have dined here so decided to stop by. Since I was on the west side of the strip today anything is possible!!!!!

Anyone want to step back in time? Cool, cause the decor is the same as it was in 1994 when they opened. A definite locals favorite and a 16 time 'Best of Las Vegas' Yes its that good, but dont expect anything fancy, but do expect exceptional food.

Our waiter was super funny, I think his name was Nicky. He tried to get me to 'Not' order the hottest curry on the menu because he didn't think I could handle it! LOL I had to prove him wrong. I think he reluctantly put the order in and seriously wanted to witness me while I ate the hottest panang duck the chef could muster up! He got proven wrong because I even asked for more sauce to take home!! NOTE: I can eat habenero peppers raw and on occasion a ghost pepper. So, hot to me is sometimes not hot enough...

My friend had the pork egg rolls(I ate one and they were awesome) and  egg fried rice. He really enjoyed it and also took his food home.

Portions are super generous. Prices a little high but worth the quality of preparation and presentation. The chef gets a high five and 5 STARS!

The restaurant has been opened for years, but due to a kitchen fire, they were closed for 7 months.  So no FTR for this spacious restaurant filled with traditional Thai art and carvings.  Even though the name suggests that it is a Thai restaurant, they also have a significant number of Chinese items on the menu.

The menu is pretty straightforward.  except it is arranged a little differently from other Thai restaurants (i.e., no curry section). Aside from the usual Appetizers, Salads, Soups sections, the rest of the menu is broken down into sections by proteins (e.g., Poultry, Beef or Pork, Seafood,Vegetables, except you have choice of chicken, beef, pork, seafood or shrimps on just about all of the entree items.

Since I like to order what the restaurant considers their signature dish on my first visit, I was recommended to try Mint Leaf Beef, which is beef marinated in Thai sauce and then cooked with chili and fresh mint leaves.  It was prepared and served quickly,and the flavor was very good.  The medium spicy level is probably less spicy compared to some other restaurant, so if you you prefer more heat you are going to have to specify Thai heat level and not the tamed American heat level.

Ambiance:  3.5/5  Thai themed decor in a spaciously arranged dining room.

Service: 4/5  Maybe it was good because they are not that busy, but I have no complaints about their service level.

Food:  4/5  I enjoyed what I ordered, and look forward to trying more items in the future.

Price:  5/5  Lunch specials are $7.25 which is good.  
           4/5  Dinner prices is average compared with other Thai restaurants.
