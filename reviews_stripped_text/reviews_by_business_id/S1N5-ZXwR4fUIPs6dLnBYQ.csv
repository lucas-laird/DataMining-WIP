You can get authentic Vietnamese food and I hear the sandwiches are good. I haven't tried the Thai food, but I don't know how I feel about Vietnamese chefs preparing Thai so I'd steer away from that.

I was just visiting out of town but the meal didn't seem all too pricey. Plates are big so I recommend sharing amongst others. Try it if you're sick of Vegas buffets!",dvfTKo5Q3AbvdUfqhRqo7w,0,1,3,t87to9pETTKttEbvQ3xwTg

I'm not an onion fan at all and when they brought the soup out I saw onions. Usually it's just broth, noodles and whatever meat which a little bit of green onions. But this time they added onions...totally disappointed. The soup was good and to top it all off you can create your own for $7.95. Their watermelon juice is delicious, you can tell it's fresh. Strawberry slush was way too sweet!

it was a cold saturday a couple weeks ago and i just needed some warm soupie noodles and the bf suggested this place instead of the usual saigons so i opted to try this place out.  Good choice!  a must visit!

I had:
pho w/ tripe only.  Love love love! the soup hit the spot, delish and piping HOT!  that's how it should be in my opinion.  There wasn't a lot of tripe in my pho but that's ok, the soup is what really matters.  I love to add lots of lime/lemon to my soup and usually most pho restaurants are stingy about giving me more than 2-4 extras but they gave me a whole rice bowl full of them.  I WAS HAPPY!  

the bf ordered:
spicy basil chicken with rice.  It was amazing!  it was a good size portion with a lot of veggies, green beans, bell peppers and onions.  The basil was so good with all the other ingredients.  However, it's nothing really special so i wouldn't suggest it if something else on the menu strikes your taste buds.

we shared:
a hot bbq spring roll.  THIS MAKES ME DROOL!  i have never had a steamed spring roll before, this was my first and i would recommend this to everyone!  It was hot and sticky, came with the same fish sauce as they would serve with the fried egg rolls but then i added some sirarcha which made it even more mouth watering!

Pros:
good food, relaxed atmosphere and tvs that stream sports all day.  (good for football lovers or sports fans)

cons:  slow service.  we sat ourselves, got the utensils ourselves.  they brought us the menu a few moments later after we sat down but still, no one acknowledged us until i started waving them down one by one.",zeOG1kyPgYmu7YSvIcyTCA,1,0,4,e2hlx3i1jyv4s5nVUxT9IQ

We ordered the Tom Kha first but it arrived last.  It was as I expected but the chicken was chewy like rubber.  It tasted fine but the texture threw me off quite a bit.

We also ordered the Lemongrass Chicken and Ginger Beef plates.  The beef was excellent but the chicken was not what I expected.  I've had Lemongrass chicken before and the taste was more like a curry flavor than lemongrass.  Perhaps it was my lack of understanding in what this type of Thai food was; if so I will have to educate myself further.

The prices were not too high and the selection overall was very good.  The sandwiches I was told are excellent and great for lunch (it is close to work, so I may have to go back).  The location is kind of hard to find in the three story shopping center on Spring Mountain (its in the far Southwest corner of the building on the second floor.

Hue Thai, in my opinion, has the best banh mi sandwich in Las Vegas.  A bold assertion? Maybe.  Just try their house banh mi on a fresh-baked baguette and get back to me.  You may just join the pro-Hue Thai team.  The Vietnamese pancake may also seal the deal - it's mindblowingly good and packed with fresh veggies and taste.

I'd also recommend one of their smoothies with boba--they have durian and jackfruit! As I love fruit that smells like death, their offering of durian alone nets them 5 stars.

I get the Pho on occasion, but there's better Pho right down the street if you're really in the mood for it.

The drinks are outrageously priced compared to the sandwiches.  The Snow bubbles are good, but boy do they cost.  When your egg rolls cost you more than your sandwich... hmm, yeah.

When you first walk in the first thing I saw was a big menu of Vietnamese drinks.  I'm not a fan but was nice to see that they have a pretty decent selection.  Wish I took a picture of it.

The menu has pictures of all their food along with their authentic names.  This was very helpful since I was with my folks and they were able to pick their own dishes.  

We ordered the traditional spring rolls (cold w/ shrimp and peanut sauce) and the pork skin roll.  The spring roll seemed pre-made and not as fresh as I hoped.  Enjoyed the pork skin roll.

Along with the many different soups you can ""make your own"" traditional pho with rare steak, brisket, tripe, meatballs etc.  I like Saigon 8's broth better but two others at our table really liked the pho broth.

We also ordered the seafood vegetable dish and lemongrass chicken to share.  Was beyond satisfied with the chicken.  It's all dark meat with the bone but worth every bit of work.  The vegetable dish was average with shrimp and squid being the only seafood.  Bok choy was soggy and overcooked.

The interior is interesting, with nice ocean scenes painted on the wall.  There is also an aquarium with like one fish in it, although he's a bad ass spiky prickly fish (is that a real fish name?)

Everyone raves about the Bahn Mi here, so being the food rebel that I am, I opted for the spring rolls and the Barbecued Pork w/ egg roll and vermicelli.  The spring rolls were average, and really didn't do much for me.  They had the usual Vietnamese spring roll cuplrits:  Shrimp, scallion, pork, carrots in rice paper.

i love banh mi - the funny thing is i dated a viietnamese woman for over a year ( she was born in vietnam, yet from jr high forward, has lived in america ) several years ago and while we dated, i was exposed to virtually all vietnamese foods ....except banh mi..... we lived together in orange county and frequented the restaurants in little saigon ( the looks we would get from people - i am 6'2 white boy  ...she is under 5' tall !! )  after we broke up, it was by accident i  ate at a banh mi ""fast food"" joint in garden grove ( little saigon ) ...holy cow ...i was in heaven - the warm baquette...crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, the pate, the bbq pork slices, the fresh crisp vegetables , the fragrance of the cilantro ( chinese parsley ) and it cost....$1.25 !?!?!?  are you kiddin' me !!!  

after moving from the oc to sgv. i discovered the banh mi places on valley blvd  ....banh mi che cali....can it be the same place as the one in the oc...please, please please let it be ....and it was ....heaven....
sure ...the prices have gone up ...a little...but i can still get them for under $2.00 

so now i spend alot of time in vegas and i'm now with a chinese woman  ...which means...many visits to spring mtn ...and of course, discovering some vietnamese restaurants...including hue thai.... so how does it stand up to the so cal banh mi.....sorry...not quite....it is exciting to see the bread baking behind the glass partitions....and the bread is decent ( smaller than what i get on valley blvd ) ....the fillings...again the taste is close ... but a much smaller portion.  and then the price ...$3.75 ...geez.....now i give hue thai high marks for it being a very comfortable restaurant...stylish...but for me..who cares !!!

my fav in vegas...so far...nhu lan...up the street...1/2 the price as hue thai...is it as good as my valley blvd fav's...no...but it's still decent and it's a mre casual place - a family run place ...it has more of a homey feel to it.",N044aCKJv3G5WuvwT5AJcA,1,1,3,OeRvtBizNsvJoIDBzk_4sA

Well worth it!

A couple do shine... (only a little)

2.  Banh Uot - freshing dish of thin rice pancake filled with savory meat filling.  Top it with fresh veggies and nuoc cham = refreshing.

But this time, I decided to try something different.. :(

When we went for dinner last night, service was especially slow, but the live music made up for it.. somewhat. Jason went for his usual- beef combination Pho and a Mountain Dew, I ordered chicken Tom Kha with chicken, a side of rice, and the charbroiled pork sandwich. 

Maybe I'm just picky, but I'm not a fan of restaurants serving soda from a can- a glass of ice wasn't offered, but he was okay with that. The sandwich came first, and was delicious. No other food came, so Jason and I treated it as if it was an appetizer- which was fine with us. At the tail end of finishing the sandwich, my soup came, kind of. I had ordered Tom Kha and was served Tom Yum. Since I had trouble deciding between the two soups in the first place, I told the server that I would keep the soup. It took another 5-10 minutes for Jason's food to hit the table, ehhhh..

Beef Combination Pho: delicious, as usual.
Charbroiled Pork Sandwich: AWESOME! I'm in love with this sandwich- great call by my server.
Chicken Tom Yum: The flavor of the soup was good- but a little bland. The big problem I had with the dish was the chicken; the flavor made it taste like some weird seafood, the texture was chewy (comparable to beef that is gristle-y), and the chicken was extremely dry. Also, I've never seen large chunks of raw tomato served in Tom Yum before and thought it was weird. I wouldn't order it again, but am still Tom Kha curious (with shrimp, of course).
White Chocolate Mocha Blast with Boba: delicious, as always. 

The big problem I had was with the service, which could have made this particular experience much better, but I've never experienced especially good service here. They're hiring servers now, and I even thought of applying just so I could make this place a 5-star place. ;P",lluNN1aQlFN7NQQ2BxFBUQ,1,0,3,uEWgpyCF1rDr2Y23nc0j9g

Overall, after trying two of Hue Thai's sandwiches, I thought it was A-OK, decent and reasonable enough to return again.

I read reviews that the bread is what sets Hue Thai's from Lee's or other places. I ordered the House Special (Banh Mi Dat Biet) and the Pork (Bahn Mi Thit Nuong).Maybe I came at a bad time, the bread wasn't stale or hard, but I didn't think it was soft, either. Definitely tasty, though, I'll give them that. The fillings were delicious, too. Not sure if I'd say it was a generous serving, but it was adequate.

I also ordered a chicken with rice dish to go. That was VERY good, surprisingly, since everyone said that the rest of the menu was just mediocre. I didn't have room to try their boba tea or pho, maybe next time. Service was quick and friendly.

The prices for sandwiches are definitely a great deal. I think I'd definitely get Hue Thai's sandwich to a Subway 7 out of 10 times. 

I'll have to try Lee's Sandwiches or other Vietnamese restaurants to compare, but I thought getting take-out at Hue Thai was pretty good.",q9jCDNZDRUYl2Pwlgxocig,0,0,3,z_slsi-mJ18j4rVKGKMFPA

We saw Penang Malaysian on the signage and thought that it's a good alternative.  At 3pm, it was closed. Weird, I thought we Asians don't have a proper time to eat - if we're hungry, we just eat.

Dizzy and grumpy from setting up the booth for CES, we settled for Hue Thai. Mind you, I had my doubts seeing both Thai and Vietnamese word on the same line. I mean, really...

Entering the place just made it all the worse. It was dark, dank and downright tacky. Come on, an underwater mural? I was hoping to see an Asian Ariel to start singing ""Under The Sea"" - oh wait, it was the lobster who sang that.  

Anyhoo, the menu was extensive and cheap. Really CHEAP! Fuck, why really blow my per diem at those wasteful buffets? People, people are starving in Africa.

Back to Hue Thai, the Banh Mi I ordered was actually delicious and satisfying - the French bread was still warm and fresh off the oven, the pickled veggies didn't overpower the meat and just had the right amount of  dressing.  The Tom Yung Goong was spicy, meaty and hot, served on one of those fiery hot metal pots. Just the way I like it.

2165827,2012-06-02,1,S1N5-ZXwR4fUIPs6dLnBYQ,"Wow! I can't believe how wrong my meal was! I ordered the Chicken Banana Flower Salad for $8.75. While the dressing/lettuce/banana flower part of the salad was fine, what they served as ""chicken"" was absolutely ridiculous!
Have you ever made chicken broth from scratch? You boil a chicken until the meat is falling off the bone, let it cool, then pick through the pot....pulling out bones, cartilage and skin. Well THAT is what the ""chicken"" in my salad consisted of.....bones, cartilage and skin! I seriously could not believe it....there was NO chicken meat of ANY kind! Just the scraps that one would normally throw away.
I called the older gentleman that had waited on us over and showed him the bones and skin, to which he replied, ""Oh, well next time tell us you want it without bones and skin."" 
Um, excuse me? Is this guy for real? 
If you're going to serve nothing but bones, skin, and cartilage, then you should call it a chicken BONE or chicken SKIN banana blossom salad, so that people understand what you are actually intending on serving them!  
I was cool when he said this at first, thinking that I may have just hit a bad patch in the salad, but with my very next bite it was exactly the same thing....a big, splintery chicken bone with absolutely ZERO meat on it, covered by a pile of lettuce, chicken skin, and banana blossoms. 
To their credit, when I finally realized that enough was enough and sent it back, they were VERY accomodating and made me a different salad, right away. 
I think it was a shrimp pork salad, and it was very tasty.
I also noticed several of the employees huddled around the chicken bone salad that I had sent back. They were speaking vietnamese? thai? to what I'm assuming was the cook and pointing at the bones and skin, so OBVIOUSLY this was not actually the way that this salad was supposed to be served. And I must admit that I think it's a good sign that they actually checked it out, and LOOKED at what was going on with the salad, instead of just writing me off as a pain-in-the-ass customer, because atleast it shows that they care about the food they are serving. And hell, anyone can make a mistake.
In fact, I'd probably have only given them one star, except for the fact that they actually seemed concerned.
My boyfriend ordered Pad See Ew. He said it was okay. Not the best he's ever had, but certainly edible. 
I think if we ever try this place again, we'll just get the Vietnamese sandwiches or the Pho, as it appears from other reviewers that this is what they're best at.",0ZOt5C0H0HgOIJ3fBj361g,1,0,2,9Fw5hAZB3I8iLB0xRjkG_w

But now, youd have ro pay me to come here.

Where to begin? Lets start with the drink order. Now I understand it being an exotic eatery, but come on, how is it even remotely possible to be out of Pepsi at 12:30 pm on a Saturday afternoon? And they pour it from cans!

Ok, so now we get to order. 3 bowls of the combination pho (#1 on the menu). of these three, one was requested to have no rare steak. one bowl of the seafood combination noodle. 4 sandwiches.

Waitress comes back like 10 minutes later and says that two of the sandwiches we ordered are not served anymore. Then why are they still on the menu? So we have to order different kinds of sandwiches. 

After another 10 min, a server finally starts bringing the pho. She just starts putting them down and we ask which one had no rare steak. She just stares at us blankly and muttered theyre all the same. Ok, no, we asked one to have no rare steak. She just shrugs and walk off! So we just give up and start eating. After another five minutes, the sandwiches arrive. These things are pathetic. They used to be stuffed full of meats and veggies...but now, about a quarter of how much used to be in there. Honestly, after eating the aandwiches, we looked at each other with some pretty sour faces.

Oh, I forgot to talk about the sorry excuse for pho! First, raw red onions...overpowering. Should be half cooked white onions. Two pieces of rare steak. A piece of beef tendon the size of a silver dollar. Couple pieces of tripe each smaller than an earth worm. and a handful of, what i guessed were, meatballs. And maybe a handful of noodles in a tasteless broth. I have never added salt to any pho broth my entire pho-eating life but this was so tastless!

What really drew the line for me was when the check came. They tacked on an 18% gratuity for a party of six! Granted some places do this and its understandable, but theres no mention of it on the menu or anywhere in the place. Gratuity charges are required to be listed somewhere if the establishment adds them automatically for any reason. And whats the cashiers response when we ask it to be removed? Its a temporary menu and it hasnt been listed on there yet. This means the menu is kind of new and there are still items listed on there they dont serve anymore... Something totally didnt seem right about that explanation.

Seems kind of sad that I used to come here guaranteed whenever I was in town and now will never come back. There are many other great places in town to go to. But only come here if you like tasteless food and mystery chargeson your bill.",-aZvfIa6MjPdPEEPFrbR7g,3,0,1,J3E3HnSXIzXgauGj52_ojQ

2264704,2008-04-04,0,S1N5-ZXwR4fUIPs6dLnBYQ,"Spoiled by Que Hong in Madison Heights, Michigan, I was lucky to have zeroed in on Vegas's best little Vietnamese sandwich shop rather quickly.  

One of the best things about Hue Thai is there extensive menu with a photo of every single dish. It makes it much easier for newcomers to swallow when they can see what they're ordering is going to look like, especially with such a lengthy list of dishes whose descriptions otherwise would probably not do them justice. Plus, Vietnamese food can be intimidating to noobs, and they have their entire menu online, so you can prep your friends before you take them.

The sandwiches are great, as should be expected. At around $4 a piece, it's a little higher than I'm used to, but the rest of the menu is comparably priced. I prefer the special combination, but I'm partial to pate and all things related to organ meat. The chicken salad stands out, as does the BBQ. They're all very good.

The gem of a dish from this place, in my opinion, is the pho dac biet. I've eaten this at probably 20 different restaurants, and this is by far the best I've had. The thinly sliced beef is, as a rule, quite chewy in this dish, and Hue Thai's version is the exception that proves it. It was incredibly tender. They also have beef tendon in theirs, which I've never had before.

The one thing I hate about this place is the horrible top 40 satellite radio station they play. Horrible. But, I'm still willing to tolerate it for the great food.

There is a huge selection of beverages here also. I'm usually a plain hot tea drinker, so most don't appeal to me, but one has the option of probably 30 or 40 different drinks. The obligatory durian shake is present if you're adventurous, or you could elect to get one made with jack fruit, if you're feeling a little less so. They're also working on getting a liquor license, but this isn't the type of place I'd typically order a beer anyway.",Hzt4UPkvv7VXHXVBAlfIqw,0,0,4,U8slBYFrMJLW-JziYWE_Kg
2291002,2016-11-13,1,S1N5-ZXwR4fUIPs6dLnBYQ,"Was recommended by a friend. I went to try close to closing time so maybe my experience is a little skewed. There was only one couple sitting inside and they looked like they had been there for awhile. 

The servers were extremely attentive. I almost felt like a human walking into the bar from the movie Dusk til Dawn. They were nice though. Nothing really wrong with being extra attentive. Better than being ignored, I guess. 

I ordered the fried shrimp sausage spring rolls for an app. It came with a tasty peanut sauce that I love regardless of the roll but the shrimp sausage was also pretty good. 

The server was taking my plate as I was putting the last bite in my mouth. I kind of laughed though. I know how it is when you are working in a slow place and you want the customer to like it. But, pump the brakes a little, boss. The place looks cool inside. They painted the walls and have televisions and it looks like a really chill place but I'm guessing it's just a bad location. Or, maybe I'm wrong because it was my first time there. I've seen it before though and I've never seen a lot of people there. Anyways, on to the entree...

I ordered the chicken panang spicy number 5. 

(This is a Vietnamese owned restaurant. Even though it's Thai food, Hue was a Vietnamese/Chinese owned area on Thailand so it's a mix of the two but being owned by Vietnamese, my thoughts of the Thai dish explain to me that they focus more on the Vietnamese items rather than the Thai. There is a specialty drink menu but I didn't want to mix the two experiences. )

Ok, so, although all of the ingredients were fresh and it was cooked thoroughly and really wasn't necessarily bad, it is not the way I personally like panang curry to be. It was basically just coconut milk with a few curry spices but either the cook didn't thicken the sauce right from adding the ingredients at the wrong time during cooking or they like their sauce very thin. I don't. I've never had Hue type Thai food so I don't exactly know. It was loaded with a great assortment of veggies and a fair amount of chicken but again, the sauce is what ruined it for me. I used to cook Thai curry from the paste a lot and I know that if you don't cook it right, it turns out like this. There were Mexican cooks so it is very likely they don't know how to cook Thai curry but the servers didn't think it was wrong so I'm not sure...

I would be willing to try again but next time I'll avoid the Thai dishes, or curries, at least.

The server did ask me what I thought and I told him I usually like my panang thicker. He did apologize but that was it. I finished everything so not really anything to fix.

Hue Thai has a huge menu. I'm pretty rigid about what I eat at Vietnamese restaurants - I barely stray from the familiar, so I ordered my usual Com Bo Lac (steak cubes, rice, and veggie). It's usually the most Americanized food I can find, which is just fine with me!

I thought it was ok, but I don't know that I would return.  We ordered the Lemongrass chicken ($12.41), spicy beef and pork ($7.99), and the curry goat ($9.99).

The lemongrass chicken was my favorite of the dishes.  It was a simple recipe of light, nearly BBQ-ish sauce on dark chicken.  The chicken was well prepared, and the sauce blended well with or without white rice to back it up.  The spicy beef and pork was actually pho, which we didn't realize.  It was also decent.  It had blood squares in it and a big ol' pigs foot.  The broth was okish, nothing great.  The goat curry was also more of a soup than a curry.

We were in the mood for banh beo so I did my research and it appears that this was the only place nearby us that carried it.This place is tucked away in a little asian business center. When we arrived, there was ample parking (6pm on a Tuesday). There was no one there and the place was dead. Which doesn't bother me, it just means quicker service. 

We ordered:
Banh Beo - Not what I am used to in CA, but they tasted good. I wish they added mung bean and real shrimp, also the dough was a little dense than how I would prefer it, but I still really enjoyed them. They didn't come out with any fresh thai chilies so we asked for them. The chilies were perfectly spicy and really made the dish better. If you're Vietnamese, you should know that chilies and this dish go together like icing on the cake! 4/5

Banh Cuon Dac Biet - The presentation was great. The rice noodle rolls weren't spectacular, pretty plain - even the meat filled ones were boring. However, the pork patty (cha) tasted really good and I could tell that they were fresh and homemade. I also enjoyed the fried crispy mung bean fritters and the fried sweet potato fritter (banh tom chien). Overall we slurped the dish clean. It wasn't the best i've ever had, but it was still very good! 4/5

Goi Cuon Chao Tom - this is always a controversial dish to order. We are always comparing this one to the famous spring roll restaurant in Orange County (Brodard). This place is obviously not going to compare, but they are also not trying to be like them either. We both really enjoyed these spring rolls. 2 large rolls were cut in half making them 4 pieces, they had a nice big fat slice of shrimp patty, and the sauce tasted good. 4/5

We also wanted to try their Banh Mi, so we ordered it to-go for our lunch tomorrow. I requested that they put the pickled veggies (do chua) separate, so that they don't soggy up the sandwiches. The veggies could of been pickled a little bit more - the sandwiches could of used the sourness, however, the sandwiches were tasty. The bread was very fluffy, crispy and tasted fresh even out of the toaster the next day! 

Of the 2 sandwiches we ordered, by far the best one was the Banh Mi Dac Biet. The meat was homemade and moist, very tender, and flavorful. I would skip the Banh Mi Nem Nuong - the nem nuong meat patty was missing a lot and not flavorful.

Hue Thai has lots of variety of food.  And a lot of it is pretty good, too.  The problem here is the price.  They used to be really cheap; a good value and inexpensive food.  But since their popularity grew, they started to increase their prices significantly!  The banh mi is still good, though in comparison to other places (Pho Thanh Huong) the size is way too small, and the price way too high.  The pho is good too.  Another plus is the fact that the food comes out almost instantaneously.  They have big TVs on the walls and always have nice music.  There's good and bad here.

  Another drawback is that it's either cash, or spend more than $20 to pay by credit.  This is a completely ridiculous rule that has now caused them to lose a customer forever.  I know very well the rationale behind it, and I know I should feel thankful that they now accept credit cards at all, when they didn't for so many years, but it really set my friend off today, especially since we were trying very hard to save money by sharing and so forth.  Our total check was $10, but we had to spend $20 to pay because we only had credit.  He vowed never to come back.  For my part, I might, but only when someone else suggests it.

The place has been through a few owners; and with the change, the service has also worsened.  I say this with the consideration that it's a mom & pop Vietnamese restaurant and those are expected to have erratic service.  

At some point, the management decided to serve more than just Vietnamese food, you will find various Thai dishes on the menu.  Variety may be the spice of life in a food court.  But in an Vietnamese restaurant aimed for authenticity, a hodgepodge of mediocre Southeast Asian cuisine will not do. 

Vietnamese sandwiches (banh mi) are the unique feature of this restaurant.  And even though most non-Vietnamese will order the combination sandwich, I urge you to try the egg banh mi.  The eggs are cooked sunny-side-up and a tad runny.  The soft yolk soaks into the crusty baguette and gives a sumptuous cheesy taste in combination with the pate.  Being that they make the bread on the premise, it is very fresh and delicious.

When it came down to the bill, we had two cards & the rest cash. We asked our server to split our bill & he said it wasn't possible. Wasn't possible?! I took a look at the receipt & noticed it was a printed one & then on the bottom was a hand written gratuity & grand total! What the... I've never seen a partial print, partial hand written receipt before. The server then brought the manager over who then said the same, that splitting the bill was not possible. That their cash registers do not allow them to do that. He then walked away & our party was stuck. While we were deciding on how to pay for the bill, the manager came back a few minutes later & said he could split the bill. All of a sudden right?! After he just told us that it wasn't possible?!

After all of the splitting of bills was situated, I went to the register to pay on my boyfriend's card. He then told ME how much to put down as a tip. Really?! Just because their registers don't have an automatic gratuity set up.

When I walked in on a recent Friday afternoon the place was empty except for one family eating lunch. The interior is dark and cavernous, with the walls and ceilings strangely painted with an underwater mural. That's not my idea of good interior design, but luckily I was getting my food to go.

The meat in the BBQ pork sammie was very good, but there just wasn't enough of it. Compared to the size of the baguette and the veggie filling (carrots, daikon, cilantro, etc.) the ratio of ingredients was off. The quality of the bread, however, was good. The outside was crispy and the inside was soft and warm.

I also got an order of the shrimp and pork spring rolls. It came two to an order. While they were both tightly packed and stuffed with veggies I can't say that they were very memorable and at $3.99 they were a little pricey.",C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w,2,2,3,1yg0DUhvt3QzSfeXYWTj_g

I got the pho chin nam and they managed to screw it up pretty badly to the point where I didn't even bother eating much of my dish (this rarely happens). The broth didn't have much of a flavor (pretty tasted like water). The only flavor that I could taste was from the small amount of herbs (cilantro) that they put into the dish. The noodles were still in a block form and had a jelly like texture. The beef was tough and chewy and didn't have much of a taste either. I don't even know what they did right in this dish lol...

The water I got was pretty disgusting as well. I took one sip for relief from the pho dish and was surprised it had this bleach/soapy like aftertaste. Like seriously, how do you not clean your cups properly.

Anyways I would not recommend for anyone to come here...at least for pho. There are plenty of other pho places in Chinatown that are worth going to like Pho Kim Do or Pho Kinh Do.

-Grilled Pork Rolls (had better at Bosa Restaurant)
-House Special Sandwich (Mayo??? WTH?  Can't they just whip up some egg whites and oil?)
-Beef Stew w/French Roll (very bland)
-Curry Goat w/French Roll (Goat was like rubber, very chewy)
-Combination Flower Roll (this is usually my favorite, but not here)
-Combo Pork and Egg Rice Plate (wasn't good, but maybe it's because they lost the ticket and didn't get this dish out until 45 mins later)

We asked if they could make the pork with something else rather than bamboo shoots but, they didn't understand; they wanted us to order something completely different.  So we ordered their grilled squid.... the picture looked good!!  

It took over 20 minutes to get our food.  However we got the squid and it did not look at all like the picture.. but what does right!  So I took one bite with the sauce provided.. and it was terrible.  I tried another piece without the sauce and it was so bad that I had to spit it out!!  It was overcooked - terrible marinade - tasted very old and dirty!  It seriously tasted like their grill/grill pans were dirty.

So we tell our waitress and they come up with that we may not be used to eating ""Vietnamese style squid.""  I said, I have had several different type of squids but, none have ever tasted like this.  She then says that no one else complained before and that we just need to get used to the taste...that is how ""us Asians"" eat it.  Of course, i said well if you haven't noticed.. I am Asian as well, and I have never been served or cooked squid that taste like this.

Yum.  Hue Thai is my all time favorite spot for Pho and Vietnamese sandwiches.  The broth in their soup here is one of the best (most authentic) I've tasted since moving to Las Vegas from California where I believe has the best Pho.  The soup is flavorful and is only enhanced with the condiments they bring out (sprouts, jalapeno peppers, basil leaves, and lime).  The main ingredients I like to put in my soup are well done fatty flank, brisket, tripe, and tendon.  They put just the right amount of meat and noodles, and their tendon has the exact texture I love as it is my most favorite ingredient in my Pho.  Aside from the soup, their sandwiches are amazing.  They don't have the hard bread that scrapes the roof of your mouth like Lee's Sandwiches; their bread is actually really good.  My favorite sandwich is the combination sandwich; number 11.  Everything in this sandwich is good!  It's even good if you save it for later, or even the next morning.  I love this place!

The customer service is hit or miss.  It's probably better when it isn't that busy.  The place isn't that pretty either.  It's like a fast food joint, and it's not a place to throw a fancy dinner party or anything.  Just come for good Asian food!  They have an extensive menu and I plan on trying more items!

I don't ususally eat much Thai food but I took a look at their menu.  They were a Vietnamest place in disguise!  What kinda threw me off was their walls are painted like a big underwater aquarium (for some reason) and even NEMO can be found!  I love me my pho and fried egg rolls, especially when they bring out that big plate of romaine lettuce, pickled carrots and radish, mint, basil, and cilantro to mix with it.  I LOVE colorful food.  I was in a rush so I couldn't stay but I took a menu with me.  The whole week after that I was craving to eat at this place.  I finally convince the gf to go with me one weekend for lunch.  So glad we did.

I've had pho before, but I had never tried Banh Mi sandwiches.  I know, typical but we Hawaii people don't have much Thai restaurants in the islands.  Turns out to be one of the best things EVER!  I tried their Special Banh Mi (the one with 3 different kinds of pate) and it was excellent!  Especially with the pickled carrots and radish on top.  Add some cilantro and some hoisin inside!  Instant yummification.  I'm hooked on these now and have one every time we go.  I've tried a few others since then, the chicken and the beef.  I like em all.  Their pho is good too, their broth isn't as salty as some of the other Vietnamese places here.  That's a plus for me.  I love throwing in basil, bean sprouts, cilantro, mint....well all of it into that broth.  I don't normally like tripe or tendon...but damn, I'll eat it with this broth and all those veggies!

From what I read, this place's banh mi is kinda expensive.  I see that Cali is a lot cheaper.  Still, $3.75 for one of these sandwiches ain't too bad of a deal...even though they used to be cheaper at one time.  Still beats selling a kidney to eat at a buffet!

My family and I ordered the pho, grilled pork banh mi, and a boba drink. Honestly this place was good once a few years back, but now everything was just eh... ok to say the least. Pho was not as flavorful as others, kinda bland for my taste, and the sandwich itself was tasty. Nice crunch of the bread, and nice marinated pork too. That's why I gave it another star instead of one.

I'm more of a milk tea kinda girl instead of the slushy, so I got their almond milk tea with boba, and upgraded to a large. WOW! Almost $6 for a drink?!? I wasn't sure how much it was until I got the bill. I figured it to be like around $4.50 like the other boba shops around town that only serve drinks. First off it should be called just almond powder drink with boba. No tea flavor at all, and being just shy under $6 it was watery... Go to Kung fu tea or Easy life for boba instead.",zGFjW0OXzgs25cxvDmz5rQ,0,1,2,7nQ3anlq9n8Lnk-HEkeJYg

Service has always been a little weird at most Vietnamese restaurants from my experience.  This one is about the same.  There is usually no thought to what comes out first.  They frequently send out the appetizer ten minutes after the entrees or sandwiches.   It's almost like you as the customer need to tell them how you want your food or just order the appetizers then when you are ready order the entrees.  Also sometimes one person's food comes out way before the other people in your party.   The other thing is the check.  You almost always need to ask for it.  This seems to be another Vietnamese thing because nine times out of ten I always have to ask for the check at one of these places.  This may be normal in Vietnam, but in America where we have limited lunch time it is not cool to wait 15 minutes for a check.  If the food wasn't so darn good I might bother me more.  Still the food comes out really, really quickly.  I've never waited more than 10 minutes for food ever and I have been here at least 15 times.

The sandwiches are awesome.  The bread is always fresh.  The fillings are tasty.  I especially like the grilled pork sandwich.  I've tried the others, but this is the best.  Noodle bowls both Bun and Pho are average compared to other Vietnamese places, but they are passable.  The main reason to go there though is the sandwiches.  Their appetizers like Eggrolls have gotten way better with better quality lettuce, basil, and mint to wrap them with.  Boba drinks are Ok, but not the best.

Comparing to Lee's Sandwiches down the street - I prefer Hue Thai.  Their bread is better.  The fillings are better.  Lee's makes better drinks and deserts.  Hui Thai makes much better hot food.

They did apologize which I was good with, but then they started to argue with me...the manager wanted to make my dish for me to go, I did not want it at that point as I was leaving.  They tried to force me to stay and wait for them to make it.

I told them several times it was ok not to worry about it but they kept insisting.  That put a bad taste in my mouth and I don't a dish they are going to rush to make just because.

If compared to to my California spots, it only deserves a 4 star but...hey for Vegas, its up there. 

Pro's: Lots of varies for sandwiches....
 The sandwich is packed with meat and all the garnishes.  (I find Lee's and Thanh huong Restaurant to skimp me on meat and/or veggies. This place doesn't!) They use the Best Bread for their sandwiches..hands down.  Its super soft...and flavorful...sandwich surely doesn't get hard if you fridge it for a couple days. If you ask for extra veggies, they give it.  Oh, They also accept credit card, which is a must! Thank god!  

This place also offers other tasty dishes.  I go here for their ""Banh uot"" too. Its kind of like Chow fun (flat rice noodle) in sheets, garnish with various things...among them...Veggies, Dry onions, pork patties, etc...and its prepared with the sauce to on the side to pour over.  If you like Vietnamese food, are adventurous ..(Like fish sauce) ....its pretty good.  Sorry, i don't remember the number I ordered.  

A side note: they have pretty looking pictures for most if not all of their food.  So even if you don't know what something is called, just look at the images.  :) Great idea!

Con's:
Its kind of hard to find. Its location is inconvenient. If you know where SF supermarket is, its on the second floor of that plaza. 
Secondly, Its way far from me! I drive like 25 miles to get here...(Boo! lol)
Price for the sandwiches around 3.50-4.00 .. a bit on the expensive side for me..since I am use to them being a bit less...

If you love sandwiches...I say come here! I love this place #1, Mr. Sandwich falls into place #2 ....Then maybe...If i have to ...I settle for Lee's ... ( my number 3 choice)

The Watermelon Juice was pretty good but they basically just blended the watermelon and added crushed ice. I prefer that the watermelon is blended with the ice for more a slush texture. With the way their serve it, half was warm and half was cold.

The Chao Tom Goi Cuon was pretty good. The Chao Tom was a huge chunk and was very flavorful in the spring roll. My only compliant is that the lettuce didn't taste so fresh in the spring roll.

Banh Canh Tom Cua was decent. The broth was on the thicker side and had a nice pork flavor to it. The shrimps weren't seasoned so they really didn't have a taste. Plenty of pork slices and gio heo in the soup. They didn't have any crab in the soup! What? Why is it called Banh Canh Tom Cua but didn't have any cua?

Its one of those places you come to that everyone in your group will find something they'll like. Nothing is special however. They have pho, spring rolls, banh xeo, banh mi, and the list goes on and on. 

The pho is just okay. Broth had some flavor, but nothing special. Noodles was flavorless and the ingredients were satisfactory. You likely won't be disappointed, but you won't be impressed either.

The house special banh mi is toasted nicely in their house made bread. The meats and ingredients are good, but a little spicy. I'm not a big fan of spicy food, but I'll still order this. Just be sure to remove the chili paste inside if you don't like spicy food. If you never had banh mi, you'll enjoy it. But if your like me who had banh mi, it'll just taste okay. 

The banh xeo, or soft taco according to one of the waiters (*facepalm*) is a yellowish pancake/crepe like with meats, onions, and bean sprouts. This place likes to load up on the bean sprouts, so there isn't that much meat. It also wasn't crispy when its served. Disappointing. 

The spring rolls here pales in comparison to the one at Bosa 1. Its just lacking the extra flavor of meat to tie in the spring roll together.

This place has almost every Vietnamese food, but the quality of each item is lacking. A great place for groups with difference preferences, just don't expect the best.",j4oWAVprCdwAjyI3VGATBw,2,2,3,2OsbY0L3WN5n2Q9Vj4IHvg

Hue Thai has standard meaty Vietnamese fare: noodles soups, banh mi, bun, etc.  And for the adventurous meaties, you can get tripe and blood cubes and all the extra parts.

We got charbroiled pork and a egg with chinese sausage bahn mi. It was indeed the same bread  and the veggie components were fresh. Charboiled pork was nicely seasoned and fragrant and the egg was fluffy and a good combo with the chinese sausage.

With that said, this place seems to have a hit or miss selection of food. For drinks, I had the thai tea, which was also OK.  My friend ordered the matcha green tea, and informed the waitress that she was still waiting for it.  The waitress then informs her that they ran out of matcha.

DO Take-Out / To-Go and enjoy your awesome food in the comfort of your own home.

BANH-MI: When I want a good Vietnamese sandwich, I'm going to Hue Thai. It's their specialty. They all start delicious bread. They add mild-medium jalapeno, pickled radish/carrot, cilantro, pate, mayo, and your choice of meat. For the non-adventurous, go with the charbroiled pork or beef (#19/#20). For those who don't mind jellied, cured, Vietnamese meat, go for #11: Banh Mi Dac Biet (House Special). 

VARIETY: Pho is ok. I prefer my pho elsewhere. However, this is the only place i know where to get Vietnamese Meatballs or Xiu Mai. Its in a deliciously flavorful tomato-y kind've sauce and served with a buttery soft baguette to dip. If you haven't had a Vietnamese Meatball, you need to eat this NAO.

CHEAP $$$$: Banh-mi is cheap! Each sandwich is just under a foot long and will probably run you around $3.50.

SERVICE: The service is absolutely horrendous here. Most employees barely speak English and the servers are oblivious to the world. Considering the place is usually empty, I have to wonder why they suck at waiting tables. Even ordering to-go at the register is an issue. Employees will be in the back leaving the register un-manned and getting their attention is a mission. Qutie annoying. 

WHY TO-GO?: Every time I go, the restaurant has an unpleasant smell. A blend of cleaning products and cooking pho broth.... Not pleasant to sit in.

Pho Thai ($7.95): Rare Steak Noodle Soup. More of a clear broth here, I can't say it packed much flavor. The meat stayed tender, but it didn't impress overall.  I'd pass!

Banh Mi Thit Nuong ($3.99): Charbroiled Pork Sandwich. This was a bit skimpy on the toppings. The bread was soft and flavorful, but each bite was either meat or veggies...not both at the same time.  I'd pass!

Banh Uot Bi Cha ($7.99): Steam Flour Rice Roll, Shredded Pork Skin & Vietnamese Pork Loaf. This was good...a bit different if you have never had Pork Loaf before. The ""rolls"" on the bottom are packed with meat and are pretty tasty.  Recommended :)

The dish comes with Chai Lu, which is the pork meatloaf and the meat smelled and tatsed bad. It was probably too old or bordering it and they still put it in the dish. That is un-excusable. 

The plaza they are in is dying out fast, almost all the leases on teh 2nd floor are closed now. From the way it is going they may be next, it was really slow in there which explains the old products they use.

When I ask for a charger he lend me his without hesitation. Great place to spend your time to enjoy a pho. Only one comment I have is the Thai tea milk tea with boba. The boba is not as good as the other boba place. But overall, a good place to try.",Sdnt6TO6GJt4636OLTyciA,1,0,5,ZQVloieEpdRNqack5PG6Ww

5736839,2017-07-03,1,S1N5-ZXwR4fUIPs6dLnBYQ,"My friend had a craving for something other than fancy and overpriced celebrity fine dining restaurants on the strip, so she yelp'd this place and I just followed along. Located in a strip mall off the main road in Chinatown, this place is a bit hidden at the corner of the second floor, but the huge colorful signs will steer you right. I had heard that this place had some good reviews for their sandwiches and Pho...so was looking forward to a good down to earth simple lunch.

It's pretty much a typical basic and casual Vietnamese restaurant....nothing fancy looking....sit down, wait for the server to come over and take your order, and you just wait for the food to come out. Or, there's a counter for takeaways....mostly the Banh Mi sandwiches, but most people we saw here were dine ins.

We wanted to try both the Banh Mi and soup noodles so went ahead and ordered the Hu Tieu Ga (flat rice noodle in chicken broth), the House Special Banh Mi, the BBQ Chicken Banh Mi, and the Banh Cuon Nhan Thit (Pork mushroom flour roll).....which I had never tried before. We had actually intended to order the regular pho noodles instead of the flat rice noodles, but it was all good....enjoyed the chicken soup very much....nice and comforting flavor to it....could've given a bit more chicken meat though. The beansprouts were fresh.....then we noticed that they forgot to give us any fresh basil leaves. There being just the two servers/cashier serving the whole busy restaurant, we could tell they were well understaffed and running around like crazy trying to attend to all the other tables......it took us a good 5-10 minutes to get their attention to let them know we needed basil leaves...they finally did.

The Banh Mi sandwiches...tasted good....the pickled vegetables were quite sweet...however, I was rather disappointed with the French roll bread. Every Banh Mi I have ever had in my life had a nice light crisp to the crust, but for some strange reason this one was very flat. The BBQ chicken in my Banh Mi was quite yummy though. My friend enjoyed her House Special Banh Mi with what looked like a couple of different types of sliced luncheon meat and the same pickled vegetables.

The Pork Mushroom Flour Roll was quite interesting.....actually quite yummy, but I don't usually eat a lot of pork so likely would not have ordered it for myself. My friend said it was good.

As previously mentioned, they're very understaffed here and so service is very very slow....despite the two servers running around like chickens with their heads chopped off. When they did get around to attending to us they were very nice and friendly.....and I think it would be unfair to be too harsh on them for this.....they were trying. Plus, I noticed a sign on the cash register advertising for help.....likely even more understaffed in the kitchen as it took our noodles about half an hour to get out to us, and the flour rolls even longer than that......I think they simply forgot about our flour rolls till my friend asked about it.

Yea, I guess if you're not in a hurry to get anywhere and have a craving for decent Vietnamese fast food, then this is definitely an ok place to come get your fill. Although this is the slowest fast food I'd ever experienced. Yea, I would come back, only if my friends wanted to come here....but I would likely just order the soup noodles.",miDc8Po6mLqWxyvXIQ4meg,0,0,3,2XmQuzgdH2QPNuSQVh5WWg
5745208,2015-04-28,0,S1N5-ZXwR4fUIPs6dLnBYQ,This place is located in the 2nd floor of the plaza and it's quite hidden. This is a very casual joint and almost like a cafetaria style where you order and pay at the counter. I came here for banh mi sandwiches before I head out for hiking. It was okay average. The bun itself didnt stand out. We also ordered the white rice noodle crepe and had to assemble ourself. The crepe itself was very thick and was not smooth.

My guests got their pho quickly, but I had to wait for my duck noodle soup.  I waited so long that they were almost done before mine arrived.  Come on, this is service 101, deliver the food together.  There were only 2 other people in the place.  No excuse for bad service.  More importantly, the duck noodle soup wasn't very good.  The duck was tough.",cFubXywYZHvmwwKb5spgQQ,0,0,2,o54dxx7sPFlGmzJeAf4ATw
5778730,2011-02-06,0,S1N5-ZXwR4fUIPs6dLnBYQ,"My first bahn mi experience so I have nothing to compare against. The bread was awesome crunchy and soft, flavor of grilled pork was great but it was a really stingy portion of meat for 3.99
Also got viet iced coffee (think its called French style there). Yummy as always and I was bouncing off the walls soon enough. But it was packed to the very top w ice which means not a lot of coffee for 2.99
So basically I'm a bahn mi fan now but likely won't go back to this specific place again. I keep hearing lees sandwich is supposed to be the best - anyone know when its supposed to actually open and if its same as one in LA?
Oh and its a little scary that they had shrimp spring rolls just sitting in front of the cash register, not even on ice. If they think that's safe, makes you wonder what's going on in the kitchen.",dsaj_eA71FvpUh49zzKcGA,0,0,3,qOo-NNzH9lijSaccBh-ltw

i love food, and its not usual that i give 2 stars but... im giving this place 2 stars... because i kno where there are better places to eat in las vegas.

yes this place is in the 2nd main chinatown mall so if u are around here, order here for convienience. Its inexpensive.


i have only had the banh mi here, which is supposed to be what they are known for and i am not impressed.

5812501,2010-09-22,0,S1N5-ZXwR4fUIPs6dLnBYQ,"My friends took me here. I guess this place serves primarily Vietnamese food and some Thai food. One of the things I like about this place is that their entire menu is in pictoral form so you can discern what you are actually eating.

I mistakenly thought we were eating family style but we actually ate our own individual dishes. My friend ordered appetizers: cripsy fried egg rolls and these interesting gelatin things topped with some orange stuff in a tiny dish. It was good when you add the fish sauce on top of it. I also ordered Pho Tai. It was pretty good due to its hearty beef broth. At least they give you large glasses of water. The decor is pretty interesting, at least it is not drab like many vietnamese restaurants.

Overall this place is much better than some of the typical Vietnamese places in terms of cleanliness.  If you compare Vietnamese restaurants, this is probably a better place to eat due to its cleaner environment. I would say that I would have rated this place a 3.5 stars.

It would be interesting if I ever came back here, I would be curious to try their sandwiches.",XiFzYeOUdkL1HxVFlPsHSA,0,0,4,rLnHAFb-TUTtOGerSJvnMw
5862828,2011-09-06,0,S1N5-ZXwR4fUIPs6dLnBYQ,"Crazy how crowded this place gets on the weekends.  That's prolly why they lost our order for a bit...comped us with two loaves of their house made bread.  Yum.  As far as viet food goes, I was impressed by the variety of entrees.  Its not just the usual suspects on the menu.  I had the chicken salad with banana blossoms.  Not all that impressed since it was the same as the one with cabbage, but with a few blossoms thrown in.  And the nuoc mam was weak.  My fiancee had the fried noodles with seafood.  Probably as good as it gets at a restaurant.  Other dishes we tried were the hu tieu (sp?...ABV), again a little lacking on flavor...and the broken rice with pork and egg quiche...think it was #51...that was perfect.  My mother can really cook, and I lived in Northern Virginia near Eden for a long time...so my standards are high.  3.5 stars for the food and an extra 0.5 star for the variety.  That said, I have this silly craving for some viet bread with egg and soy sauce...so I'll be returning there for a pre flight meal.

In my recent trip, I learned that they were under new management...and I could tell.

For one, it was not as crowded as it usually was. 

Second, in our order of banh beo, there was one that was COLD like they forgot to microwave it. Also, the banh beo order came with multi-sized plates of banh beo. Some were noticeably larger than the rest. Very strange. The waitress even apologized for the mis-sized plates.
