Upsell is something they don't lack on. From  upsizing to adding a cookie.
Fries were nice and hot but the burger lacked presentation. Looked like it had been smashed down to fit in the bag.
Taste was where it should be. Service is spot on.",ks1mktI5fNyc0gpINDqFeA,0,0,4,aC1BHBulGzI8atawoBtbDw

Because I am allergic to diary products.  Order was ready the second I pulled up to the window to pay.  Hamburger was cold and was covered with cheese.  Didn't find out till I got home ( right around the corner). My fault for not checking it before I left the window.  They should repeat your order to you every time!  You shouldn't have to ask!  But no, I ordered fries as well, the only thing fresh!  My lunch was completely destroyed, had to throw the cold hamburger out, tried to remove the cheese but stuck to the cold burger.  Tried to call them to let them know and no one answered( about twenty rings, twice)!  My lesson make them repeat your order and double check everything before leaving that window, Take the wrapper off the burger and check it out!!!  Just shows they really don't give a shit!  Too much competition and they play it stupid!  No wonder I am the only one in line and the burger was cold!!!  Oh and by the way this was on a Saturday!  Go figure!",sHGS41fTsr9aGNKyDzt3Kg,0,0,1,Pvl4dI5Hh3E0m0ko-s5S7g

This location they fall short on water. Look at my picture at that small water cup. SMH... nothing makes me mad like spending 20 to 30 bucks on food and then u ask for water and they give you a small cup of water. Again I dont need to brush my teeth I want water to drink.

She seemed to be the only one managing the drive thru and tje register. Her attitude was great and she was very sweet. I wish I could have gotten her name, she definitely deserves to be be recognized for her stellar customer service. Food was also fresh.",aC40_K4ZibUEKYpVFPD5XQ,0,0,5,rIB_K_r0MPwh1nlBy9Si_w

Nick was the only person working both Front & Drive Thru. He acknowledged us, said he'd be with us in a moment.   Which it was fine, I had no idea what I wanted. I was surprised he was the only person up front at 4 pm besides the one person in the kitchen.

He didn't mind that I had a custom order,  he was more than accommodating.  You can tell when someone genuinely cares about their job. He's making the best of it,  he stays busy.  After he dropped off the food, he started sweeping up. Really nice guy. He could work his way up to a manager someday.  Great work ethic. 

Great first time experience.",_ykg4Fp8j_tU83q2tYC2FQ,0,0,5,2uBcHjhMsIvZTtX7leOFdA

This past time i was next to order and the lady kept telling me ""one more moment please"", ""It will just me one more minute."", etc. I was waiting about 3 minutes before i could actually order. On top of that she forgot to give me my drink and by time i realized it i was too far to turn around. Overall bad experience and probably won't come back again.",TuVBOrxNNkmlyqYif_BNlQ,1,0,2,ZB1-GfB_n1cn2t_QpFDb-g
4451906,2012-11-14,0,8JxhnIJyOOR4qpqhRr0eiw,"Why did I even bother?

Sometimes after work, especially when I work overtime I am simply hungry and nothing is open because I get off of work at 12:30 AM. I was starving and did not feel like cooking when I got home. I happened to remember Carl's Jr. also sells burritos under their ""Green Burrito"" name so I thought I would just try it this once.

Well, it just so happened that night they weren't actually selling any of the Mexican food. Bummer. And I was already IN the drive-thru, sitting there with my stomach rumbling still. I decided to go with the Carl's Jr. Six Dollar Burger combo, bringing my total to a whopping $8.68. I don't know about other people, but paying anything over 6 bucks for something someone is handing me through a window never sits well with me.

And surprise - the burger didn't sit well with me either. I got home and the fries were incredibly sub-par. Just sad ass fries in general. I didn't bother eating very many of them. But my dogs enjoyed them. The cheeseburger - such a joke! I can't believe people fall for this ""it's like a restaurant burger"" crap. I guess if you've never been to a restaurant and had a burger then...

Anyway the cheeseburger from the minute I picked it up was slip-sliding everywhere. Why? Because there was massive amounts of mayo and mustard sliming up the works. I had to undo the burger, pick out everything, scrape off a majority of the sauces, throw out the mealy tomato, and THEN have the actual burger. They say it's ""Angus beef"" - okay. Maybe it tasted a BIT better than normal fast food burgers, but really? NOPE.. 

I'd rather have McDonald's guys. At least the fries are better.",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,2,0,1,aUPOr6n0BXsrfjFe9IuEQw

5513446,2013-07-02,1,8JxhnIJyOOR4qpqhRr0eiw,"I allowed my friends to talk me into making a Carl's Jr. run.  It was a mistake for sure.  I try and stay away from fast food as much as possible.  But, since I have a full house of drunks the last thing I want is for them to start cooking.  So, a buddy and I took everyone's orders and hit the drive thru.  I must admit, that while we were waiting in line, everything started to sound good.  Sometimes a late night burger is a perfect way to end a night.  We got there just a little before 11 pm and made our order.  It took a while for them to bring our order to the window.  We made the drive home and everyone jumped me as I walked in the door, like a pack of hyenas thinning out a herd of antelope.  The burgers were okay but I ended up paying for it a little later on.",P9yweXls2Pg-EMipYr45XA,1,1,3,VYhIwEz_Pznl79T_7nzDzg
