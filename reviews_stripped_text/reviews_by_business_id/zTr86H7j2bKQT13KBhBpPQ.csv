Even though it was late and we did not have change for a $100 he went the extra mile and got change out of his wallet.  If you are out off trop & the 95 and need some late night munchies i suggest you go to carls jr n get a $5 all star meal.,RVwG1uWUJYBtiqoMWVFFqA,0,1,5,Wd7OBE4ecXuPdqAx_Sch0g
897126,2015-06-26,0,zTr86H7j2bKQT13KBhBpPQ,Ordered a Mexicano burito it got to me cold on once side and hot on the other.   Seriously they microwave their burito's? ?    Another complaint....their AC stinks.  It's always warm in there.   Come on guys this is Vegas... today was 111 degrees and this restaurant was barely 91 inside.  Don't come to this location..your wasting your time.,RLURm7kSOiT_yDzX80U5iA,2,0,1,y-7RhL04fz_gyJcPYIoXZg

3480595,2014-11-12,2,zTr86H7j2bKQT13KBhBpPQ,What can I say....I love Carl's Juniors low carb burgers.  A more healthy fast food option minus the bread.  I normally stop here on the way home from work and this restaurant is always fast and efficient.  It's kinda hard to mess up a low carb sandwich....just don't add the bum lol.  Tonight  eating inside the restaurant and it's clean inside and they have some good music playing.  One of the employees did stop by to ask if everything is ok.  I barked out with a mouth full of burger....Of course it is.  I would have been more upset it she had messed up my rhythm of chews that I have down to a science when eating low carb.  Definetly check it out for a quick meal.,_XcsG3krzuXLXaLDncBITQ,3,3,5,H0lSJG7qM_pKbAjIcDY8ig

Fish sandwich is good and sauce is light, perfect for a quick lunch meal between classes.  Dining space in this Carl's is huge but I never really utilize it.. more of a grab and go kind of guy.

3734880,2015-03-01,0,zTr86H7j2bKQT13KBhBpPQ,"This is not a food review. Carl's Jr. is Carl's Jr. no matter where you are and you either like it or you don't. I do. What I disliked on today's visit was my being made to feel as though I was attempting to execute a fraud as a result of the cashier's ignorance and marginal rudeness. I paid for my $5.68 order with a somewhat older (1998 vintage) twenty dollar bill. When she saw it you'd have thought that I was trying to pass either Confederate currency or something which I'd manufactured myself. Saying nothing to me she pretended suddenly that I wasn't there, placed the bill I had given her off to the side and fetched a drink for a drive thru customer totally dismissing the fact that she had rung up my order in anticipation of payment. Afterwards, and still saying nothing to me she began puttering around with the bill in her hand and at one point seemed as though she was in deep conference with another employee albeit out of my field of vision. Having been blown off so that the drive thru customer could be attended to while I waited and then not being offered anything by way of an explanation as to the delay I finally asked what the problem was-I had my suspicions but couldn't believe this was being handled in such a gauche and unprofessional manner. She mumbled something and took the bill into the back presumably for a second higher level conference. When she returned more than a minute later she still said nothing though it was apparent that she would acquiesce and accept the bill. Saying to her in a pleasantly sarcastic tone ""Are you convinced now that I didn't counterfeit the bill...?"" she says to me ""I never said YOU counterfeited it"" (!?!?). At that point I could only conclude that she suspected me of possibly passing a counterfeit bill irrespective of its origins. She did however volunteer that they ""have to inspect ALL bills"". All what bills? Every bill each cashier in this store is handed has to be inspected? I checked to see if I was wearing a sign reading ""Ellis Island"" or something akin to it.. It was at this juncture that I realized this kid was/is chief engineer on the B.S. express.  
I can well understand the necessity for wariness and vigilance when money is exchanged in retail transactions. As a past cashier I can recall a rather careless error I made which taught me a $100 lesson. Likewise, I presume there was nothing personal intended by any of this. Nonetheless the lack of professionalism and just plain bad manners displayed are I feel primarily attributable to ignorance and questionable upbringing. Presuming that the majority of fast food workers are neither PHD material nor Mensa candidates their overall ignorance doesn't obviate the necessity for good people and P.R. skills and again, good manners. The cashier could have smiled pleasantly and asked me to wait for just a moment while she brought the bill into the back. She might also have had the requisite degree of education or training which would have prevented her from having been so thoroughly confounded by a different looking though perfectly legitimate example of legal tender. Rhetorically speaking if I WAS attempting a fraud would I have been so stupid as to pass an obviously different looking bill? 
Perhaps I'm turning a mole hill into a mountain but I nevertheless found the entire episode rather off putting and irritating. I fault the store's management for hiring employees who have little to no knowledge of anything prior to say Twitter or Lady Gaga, and the cashier herself for her clearly anemic one on one skills such as they are.
P.S. Carl's, why don't you issue a revised memo to cease the mandatory though totally insincere ""my pleasure"" nonsense which is inherent to all transactions? It is a thoroughly unconvincing affectation. Adults seldom speak that way; do you think we'll buy that crap when some kid who won't even look you in the eye mumbles it? Have you so little faith in your employees that you don't feel them capable of saying something like ""have a nice day"" without making it company policy?",7usb6VLN0RY22ZdYE8j-Iw,0,0,2,Xu7cNSZMglhtO6o1LVrFuQ

I wanted breakfast and I understand that some places have a time cut off... But when I asked the employee he didn't seem to know if it was still being served so he followed up with what it seemed like was management. 
The manager yells ""no- no more breakfast. No breakfast until tomorrow""

I understand - I needed to pick something else. The employee helps a guest at the drive through and I'm assuming the gentleman wanted breakfast. 

Manager yells again (he has on a headset) to the employee NO BREAKFAST. Breakfast until tomorrow. 

Unprofessional. The employee did a good job and that's why it's a 3/5 not 2.",cIofQoDbdbDf47s3-GhRoA,2,0,3,raCjBe63yPIOLudaXDcQCg
4467420,2010-12-10,0,zTr86H7j2bKQT13KBhBpPQ,"I'd admit, I've never tried Carl's Jr before since there aren't any around where I'm from in New York City. So if this Carl Jr. is exceptional, I wouldn't have known. But what i can say is this joint was absolutely great. The lady behind the counter was very accommodating and pass by my table a few times if everything was alright. Which is very odd for a fast food joint (especially in nyc). 

I've order the Guacamole Burger and my friend ordered the Teriyaki Burger. My burger had the options to upgrade for the burger to be double meat patty or the angus meat patty. So i chose to upgrade it to an angus beef patty which was great and delish. I like the burger being charcoal and the guacamole made the burger moist and creamy. I have to say the sauce in my burger was awesome. No condiments (ketchup) needed. Great place for a quick bite.",yzGTytmMzwos1WKgtun17g,0,0,5,cEDqkUJ_4YzV7Ws-4qCfHQ

4884737,2010-09-27,0,zTr86H7j2bKQT13KBhBpPQ,"It's a rare experience when I go to a fast food restaurant.  I'm not ""anti-fast food"", I just personally don't think most of it tastes that good.  That being said, I usually really do enjoy a Carl's Jr burger.  When judging a place like Carl's Jr, it's all about expectations.  

The burger at Carl's is char-broiled, differentiating them from many fast food restaurants.  Their meat patties are usually slightly bigger than most places, and the burgers usually have crisp and fresh lettuce/onion, and fresh tomato.  The sauces are simple, but effective.  For example, the Famous/Super star is my favorite burger on the menu due to the white sauce they use.  It is like a slightly tangy/acidic mayonnaise.  This sauce is boring by itself, but when combined with the other ingredients on the burger it actually has very good flavor.  

The reason I give two stars is because I think this particular Carl's is not that good.  I live a stone's throw from this restaurant, and usually do not get the level of quality I will find at a Southern California Carl's.  The inconsistency is what makes me bring this place down to a two stars.  Consistency is even more important when it comes to fast food.  

The positives is that it's open 24 hours, and the inside of the restaurant is clean.",icjbGrWlNnkFl_jjSodsEg,0,0,2,bu-iGFenOwHEywzvATn48g
5198298,2017-07-21,0,zTr86H7j2bKQT13KBhBpPQ,I past threw this Carl's Jr. Daily and at times I would stop by for some lunch. Omg the jalapeño poppers are so tasty. Definitely pretty much what I order lol. On July 17th I stopped to get some jalapeños poppers. I was waiting for a long period of time thru the drive thru. The customer in front of me ordered a lot of food. Roxanna was th employee who was directing drive thru. So as I get home and start to eat my jalapeño poppers I notice that the cheese and peppers were missing on 4 poppers nothing inside them. So I called and spoke to Roxana express how disappointed it was to get jalapeño poppers with no cheese and jalapeños. She apologized and took my name down. She told me to go back to restaurant so they can make another order for me. I was very pleased with her customer service.

Not sure if they are understaffed or what but this is the time everyone gets out of work. There is only 2 cars ahead of me in the line and they have not been helped. The wait now is about 30 minutes and no way to get out of the line! I will be speaking to a manager.,c0LQ3In79n8fnvy8H-5uvg,0,0,1,2lsihuNDkVJi2atQ69HhgA
