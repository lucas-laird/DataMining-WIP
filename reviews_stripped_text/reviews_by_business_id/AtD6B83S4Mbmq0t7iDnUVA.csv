Although the staff was nice, our food was bland and lacked any amount of spice.  The lunch soup tasted like water and even the vegetables in the soup lacked any sort of flavor....and to add the icing to the cake I had the review of the GMO soy products flashing through my memory.  Soy is one of the largest GMO crops outside of corn and I couldn't get past it with every bite.

Our food wasn't horrible, it was edible...I left full...it was clean...and everyone was nice.",UjaFrJyZh9b-NtWzW-luGQ,2,0,3,F1Naf81QYmbD1AvDB1DyQA

Das Essen war gut - wir hatten BBQ Beef, Wonton-Suppe und fritierte Wonton als Vorspeise und dann Pinapple Duck und Chicken Sweet and Sour als Hauptspeise - aber der Geschmack der nachgeahmten Fleischprodukte vermochte nicht zu überzeugen. Ein ""echtes"" vegetarisches Gericht mit Tofu oder Bean Crud (was das 'Veggie House' im Übrigen auch anbietet), wären wohl die bessere Wahl gewesen.
Das Personal war aufmerksam und freundlich, das Essen war schnell auf dem Tisch und mit frischen Zutaten zubereitet.
Wer ohnehin unterwegs ist und Lust auf Vegetarisches hat, dem kann man das 'Veggie House' sicher empfehlen, aber sich vom Strip ein Taxi nehmen um dort zu essen lohnt sich dann doch nicht.",-u54-xq843UoYWEV-vU7vA,0,0,3,zb90xAyLMvX8m_ivPsRU2A

90420,2013-06-06,0,AtD6B83S4Mbmq0t7iDnUVA,"If it looks and tastes like chicken, it must be chicken right? Nope, not here.

The walnut shrimp and the sesame chicken could've fooled a carnivore performing a blind taste test! Their textures were deceptively like their naturally occurring animal counterparts. It probably helped these dishes to fry these meatless morsels in a light batter. The crispy spicy eggplant was cut into perfectly-sized strips and the sauce was spot on. Brown rice is also offered as an option, which is different from most Asian establishments.

As fans of roast duck from Chinese restaurants, my friends and I were intrigued by the pineapple duck and ordered it. Duck is difficult to replicate because of its gamey flavor and texture, so I wasn't expecting much. At first glance, it looked similar; however, at first bite, it was akin to fried tofu that was squished down. In the end, I was mostly put off by the sauce.

The establishment itself is nice and clean with very attentive service. The dishes are well-priced, since my group of four paid about $13 each (including tax and tip). I'd like to try their lunch specials and non-fried dishes too!

The crispy ""beef"" was very crispy and had a good flavor, but it didn't taste like meat to me, which is a plus. However, the roti with curry sauce was the highlight of our meal and tasted delicious. 

We had a groupon, which we weren't allowed to use with the lunch special and we had forgotten the details of the groupon because we have so many. The waitress was able to accommodate us by switching  everything from lunch special to full prices. If we had known this, we might have ordered other things. We realize that not knowing the terms of our groupon was our fault, but it would have been nice for the waitress to check if we were using one when she took our order.

The lotus cakes were delicious.  I'm not sure exactly what they were made of, but it included round slivers of lotus root with a coating of some kind of protein on one side (TVP?), fried with a tasty brown sauce.  As stated in other reviews, the service is excellent here.  The waitress asked me how I liked the food, which is actually pretty unusual at a Chinese restaurant.

     We ordered: crispy eggplant, walnut shrimp, general tzo chicken, and spicy fried beef as well as their hot-and-sour soup. 
     Each dish was delicious although I wouldn't recommend ordering the eggplant and beef together due to their seasoning similarities. Soup had a little too much thickener, but was still tasty.

Consider a veg restaurant part of your adventurous Yelp eating!  Is fake chicken really that different from cow guts?  Well yes, but..... what I'm saying is: don't be afraid to try it!

Chinatown isn't exactly the easiest place for vegetarians to visit - a menu can be daunting enough as it is, but then to throw in the question ""is there any (chicken stock/fish sauce/bonito flakes/meat bits) in this dish?"" and be prepared to blow some minds, including your own.  I don't enjoy blowing minds so sadly I don't visit many places in Chinatown.

But hey!  Don't fret, vegetable lovers!  Veggie House is awesome and will fill your Asian-food cravings.  They have a huge menu which always throws me for a loop (I'm not used to so many choices!) and everything they offer is vegan.

The first time I visited Veggie House, I made the mistake of trying to be healthy and ordered an all-veggie stir fry dish.  It wasn't bad, but I've come to find out that they specialize in fake meats.  Now, I've been a vegetarian for over six years so I'm not the best person to ask on how much the fake meats taste like the real deal but I'm going to go ahead and guess ""not very.""  I also want to say that I don't care because I find the food here delicious.

Things I've had that are really great: General Tso's chicken, crispy beef, orange beef, sizzling chicken (think an Asian version of fajitas), and curry roti.

Things I've had that are skippable: vegetable soup, spring rolls, the happy sushi roll (way too much of a fishy taste for me, but my husband liked it).

Service is friendly and the restaurant is clean and large.  My only complaint is that I wish the items were a dollar or two cheaper so that I could feel better about ordering a third item to share with my husband instead of the usual two (yes, I'm a pig).  But fake meats can be pricey so I understand.

A restaurant that has an entire menu I can order from!  Take that, Chinatown!",ELfzWgdf64VBLi5z1ECItw,17,13,5,S78tfszTOyTaB0vy2vUa6w

There are good places, yes but this place definitely will trick a carnivore into thinking they just had some beef right off of the hibachi. When I first tried it, I ordered orange beef to go and when I got home, I opened the box and was confused because it looked like beef so I stared at it for a while just to make sure. After much hesitation, I bit a piece of it and spit it right back out before I was so certain I had eaten beef. I would have been sick after not eating red meat in years. I had to look online about this place again just to be sure and was absolutely amazed. My boyfriend is not a vegetarian and took a bite out of my food out of complete curiosity and thought the same as I did. After explaining it was all soy product, he was completely surprised and now wants to go eat with me. I'm not trying to turn him into a vegan but it is nice to go to a restaurant that we both can enjoy. I did not give 5 stars however because I wasn't impressed with the service. I've only been there twice and both times, they seemed to have ignored me and my wait time was much longer than expected especially for calling in my orders ahead of time to pick up.

 We had:  

seaweed salad- portions were double what you would get anywhere else (and I know, because I order seaweed salad any time its on a restaurant menu) and it is entirely seaweed, instead of a little pile of seaweed with some other veggies underneath to make it look like there's more seaweed there (ahem, other restaurants)

roti w/ curry sauce-  the bread was perfect in texture and taste, airy and not greasy, and the curry sauce was out of this world

Oyster mushrooms w/ lemon sauce-  Very delicious.  Just superb.  This was one of the specials, and the mushrooms are deep fried and the basil (cooked) complements them and the sauce perfectly

Orange Beef-  OH. MY. GOD.  I want to eat this every day of my life.  The ""beef"" had a very nice crisped texture, excellent flavor and perfect amount of tang and spiciness to the sauce

Crispy Spicy Eggplant- This was pretty good, but not mindblowing.  If you really like eggplant you might feel differently, but compared to the other items we ordered...

The ambiance is great as well, the decor is cute and the servers are really friendly and attentive.  

As others have related, the menu is extensive and has an impressive array of meat alternatives.  

The only thing that I wish would change is the packaging for left overs- it was all styrofoam.  Would have been awesome if it were something more enviromentally friendly but I will just have to remember to bring my own containers and bag next time....",CsSnpJ5FIL36E1inGGg7Ig,3,0,5,Inq2nJOdBjFO9r6QrMbSzA

To find the restaurant, you need to walk up stairs to the second level of the plaza (there is also an elevator). I've been to Veggie House twice. The first time I didn't like it so much and I ate very little because the flavor of the food was too meat-like (but maybe that's a compliment to the chef for people who like the flavor of meat - he got it right on). The second time I ate there was much better. I went with friends and was able to try a bit of everything because we ordered a bunch of food to share. I recommend the roti, chicken lettuce wraps, kung pao chicken, and their meatballs in that order. I also found a coupon on groupon so I plan to go back and see if there's anything else I might like.

After I bought the groupon I started to think about what I can expect and I came on here to get a heads up on the menu, decor stuff like that but I still retained an open mind so that I could enjoy the experience and write this review. Everyone said the food and atmosphere was great and they didn't lie. It was a little jewel in china town above a strip mall, you would walk right by it if you weren't looking for it and I liked that. Upon entering the restaurant I noticed how light the restaurant felt, it gave you that feel good vibe, there was no wait time and the hostess was friendly. The restaurant was clean and the sound of running water which was coming from the decor was delightful and calming. A waitress came to our table right away and asked if we had ever been there before, you could tell that she cared about the reputation of the restaurant and the quality of our experience, I loved that. After I said no she proceeded to tell me about the specials and what she would recommend and even asked me what my taste were (at this point it was groupon be damned and I was going to pay full price for the food and experience). I ordered the roti for the appetizer and for dinner I ordered the seaweed steam with basil and my sister had the fried eggplant. With the waitress gone we were able to soak up the ambiance of the restaurant , 5 mins after that appetizers came and 20 mins after that the dishes were on the table. At first bite I was in love with my dish, it was really spicy just like I like and it had a bold flavor (I thought that the seaweed would have a fishy off putting taste to it but it didn't). It had exactly the flavors I wanted and was just different enough to add to  my overall experience. My sister's experience was slightly different, she is a very picky eater since birth and found the eggplant too sweet for her liking but after urging her to put some soy sauce on it (soy sauce has a lot of sodium so I knew it would balance out the sweetness) she was liking her dish too. So desert was next up I ordered the green tea ice cream and she had the cherry ice cream, my ice cream was more of a palate cleanser and seeing as how I love tons of sugar and like I said I wanted something different it was good. My sister's experience of her desert was 4 thumbs up and she would go back just to get the ice cream (being that the place is like 2 hours away from where we live by bus that's saying something).

I merely told the waitress that I had a coupon and she didn't acknowledge my statement so I repeated myself and she snapped at me with a nasty tone and said ""I heard you!"" I replied ""Woah"" and then asked another waiter to speak to the owner, Kenny. I explained that as a customer supporting his business that I shouldn't be talked to like that by his staff. He didn't respond other than nodding his head. 
The check came and as the waitress with the attitude passed by two other patrons she muttered something indiscernible and smiled while shaking her head in disapproval and cheeky manner and then the two women both looked at me instantly. Granted I don't know what the waitress said to the two patrons but I felt uncomfortable as a paying customer seeing that here a waitress is (almost definitely) talking about me to two random customers. I then spoke to Kenny, the owner and head chef, to let him know that I felt uncomfortable and felt that his employee was inappropriate. He just said sorry as though he felt obligated to but I didn't feel like he really cared. As a paying, repeating customer I find that to be annoying and disconcerting when I'm not being heard.

We were greeted with a sample of the crispy beef from the chef.  It was great, lighty crisp, tossed in a sweet & savory sauce, sprinkled with crushed peanuts.  I ordered the 2 item cold dish combo for an appetizer and selected the BBQ Meat and the Bitter Melon Salad.  I asked what the bitter melon was before ordering and was told that it was a squash that was mildly bitter.  The BBQ Meat can be passed off as the BBQ Pork I remember eating as a little kid, red on the outside and grey on the inside.  The Bitter Melon was terrible.  Not that it was prepared yucky, it is just not a vegetable we could eat.

Entrees were General Tzo Chicken, Szechuan Shrimp and House Chow Fun.  The General Tzo Chicken is 5 stars!  Fried crispy on the outside but chewy in texture on the inside.  Tossed in a sweet and spicy sticky sauce, perfect for clinging to the rice.  The Szechuan Shrimp sauce had a good flavor and it really did look like shrimp, the taste and ""shrimpy flavor"" was a little too much for me.  I'm glad I tried it, and I'm sure that it is a favorite of shrimp lovers but I can't say that I will order it again.  The Chow Fun was great too.  The vegetables were stir fried in a super hot wok that gave them that smokey burnt flavor on the edges and perfectly cooks them to a crisp tender.  

The service was fast, friendly and attentive.  When we got the check, the order was taken in Chinese so I had to stare at the symbols for 10 minutes.",G4pBy0nzqqkKgJEHrDNcWQ,3,1,4,vJUjrGDak4YEiiTXp-Qjbw

Everything is vegetarian, so when you see orange chicken on the menu, it's not actually orange chicken, it's vegetarian soy product that looks like chicken with orange sauce which is really tasty!  Their dishes can be really creative like the fish dishes where it really looks like fish, and the fish skin is dried seaweed to add texture. Very well done.

update 2/9/13:
Lunch specials from 11am-3pm everyday!!! Came here twice for lunch and the lunch specials are pretty good as it includes soup, white or brown rice (no extra charge) or a steamed bun, and the main entree. The portions for lunch specials are large enough to do family style with a couple people. The other day we also tried some dinner items and were equally impressed such as the japanese pumpkin with silky tofu and vegetables. YUM!  The spicy eggplant is not really spicy as it is sweet, but they are perfectly fried and I would be happy to eat those instead of french fries. 

Just a reminder that the entire place has no meat. So if they menu says beef, chicken, fish, it's not actually meat it is a soy product that looks like meat, but it tastes pretty authentic. 

Service is very quick too so if you need a fast place for lunch, this is a great healthy spot.",tQVTyovdm4doXxDSkfYUUw,4,1,5,LNDPrfs61Uk570rc9ClGpA

We ordered Vegetarian Goose which is one of the litmus dishes in a solid vegetarian restaurant and it completely failed.  Instead of the tofu skin being soft and tasty, it came hard (brittle at some places) and tasteless; instead of having a variety of vegetables as filler, it has some kind of goofy stuffing material that tasted like mashed potatoes but has an elastic texture.  May be I don't really want to know.

The oyster mushroom dish was no different than an ordinary sweet and sour deep-fried mushroom dish.  The dishes are on the expensive side considering the location and the quality.

My friend actually eats here at least once a week which is what convinced me to check this place out with him. Maybe my expectations were a little too high but I was surprisingly disappointed. 

PROS: 
Let me start by explaining my reasoning for being extremely disappointed with this place yet still giving three stars, instead of one, by listing three positives. 

1. The service was excellent
2. They offer a brown/black rice option (instead of white)
3. The cherry chocolate chip vegan ice cream - YUM!


CONS:
If you like fried, greasy foods and sauces loaded with excessive amounts of sugar then this might not be a negative for you. But if you're like me and expect something somewhat healthy (I mean, it is called Veggie House, right?) then you will be disappointed and underwhelmed. 

Imagine taking a big bottle of syrup and squeezing it into your mouth, that is what the sauces tasted like. Personally, if I wanted to eat something this unhealthy, I would have splurged on a delicious thin crust pizza from Pizza Rock (drool).

Anyways, when we entered, on Christmas Eve a little before 6:30 pm, we waited about 10-15 minutes for a table for 2. After we were finally seated and looked over the menu, we ended up ordering:

Turmeric Salad, $5.95 prior to tax- This salad automatically comes with the dressing on the side. I really liked this salad. It is made with a mix of the healthy dark green leafs, Romaine lettuce and spinach. The flavors were good, especially the dressing. And this is a great starter to share with another person. 

Curry Duck, $12.95 prior to tax- I thought this curry duck was good, but my husband really liked this more. I thought the ""duck"" itself was average, and wished the texture was better. I liked the sauce of this dish. I liked that there were braised green beans in this entree. This dish is good, but not as good as I was hoping it would be. I probably wouldn't order this again.

Spicy Veggie Crispy Beef, $13.50 prior to tax- The texture of this entree is very similar to beef. I really liked the flavors of this dish as well. I thought the sauce was good. I liked the chopped nuts (well I think they are nuts, but they may have been something else) on top of the beef and I also liked that there were a few broccoli florets on this plate, but would have been nice to have a little bit more. 

Both the curry duck and crispy beef entree came with your choice of brown or white rice. My husband and I opted for the brown rice (which was made perfectly).. 
---------------------
(Total= $35.02 after tax, prior to tip)

Service was good for the most part. Our server was nice and gave good recommendations. I appreciated his input when I asked him what his opinion was for some of the menu items. But we did wait quite a while to get our check and to get our boxes to take home some of our leftovers. 

By the way, there is a $6 credit card minimum and there is also free WiFi here (chefkenny, one word). 

There is also one single men's restroom and one single women's restroom. The women's restroom was clean upon this visit and stocked with the essentials. 

The 4 employees working here all speak English and are nice. They are more than happy to explain any of the menu items.

It's a real treat as a vegetarian to be able to order anything on a menu without worry and everything that I have had so far is tasty. However, the service is not up to standard. I found this restaurant because of Groupon and I have been turned away twice trying to use the Groupon. 
 The first time I was told I couldn't use the deal with the lunch special which is annoying but understandable. The 2nd time I was told that I couldn't use it because I ordered online. I didn't pay online, I was going to pay in cash. The owner said that I couldn't use the Groupon and told me to call Yelp about it, he kept my food and told me to come back if I figured it out. 
 To me it would have been simple to re-ring the order and not waste the food but he just told me to leave. I still have the Groupon and I will go back once more because of that but I won't be eating here anymore. There is another all vegan restaurant of a similar style near by so I will try them out.

Dishes are slightly sweet which the servers inform me is to appeal to the American palate. So if you like food a bit more authentic make sure you let them know that.

We also ordered the jiao yan tofu - this was good, but could have been improved by jalapeños instead of bell peppers. Also could have used a bit more spicy.

Fast forward to a couple years, and this time I was able to sit down and try a bunch of different items. I'm glad to say that the quality has been maintained, and I had a real solid meal.

You know the deal with vegetarian restaurants.. They are normally pretty awful. That is because top chefs do not like to be limited on what they can or cannot cook. (they also love meat!) Fortunately, in the hands of the talented Chef Kenny, the dishes here are executed to a high degree, and one can be forgiven for confusing a faux meat dish with the real deal.

Follow the Yelpers advice for ordering at this place. I rarely say this because people have slightly different palettes. But, I believe due to Chef Kenny's consistency, anyone can have a good meal. The spicy crispy eggplant is really good. They reminded me of portobello fries. The crispy beef was another winner. Even though I love the taste of beef, and that was obviously missing, the texture was really good. But, I wasn't a big fan of the faux chicken dishes, but they were good for what they were. I also didn't get the ice cream over sticky rice, I'll be scratching my head over that one for a while.

I'm a pure carnivore. That is how I will be for the rest of my days. I do believe that we need to eat more vegetables for environmental issues. I find this restaurant interesting.

I went for dinner and ordered mapuo tofu, chicken curry, miso soup, and snow pea sprouts. (for $14?!?)
Everything was at least $10 except the soups that were around $6.

The waitresses spoke to us in Chinese; however I felt that they didn't understand what we said or ordered because they got our order wrong and could not understand when we asked for a container for soup and a plastic spoon in Chinese. 
They seemed more fluent in Cantonese I don't see why we couldnt just communicate in English.

The food was also very salty. Everything we ordered was super salty almost unbearable.

What really got me was how overpriced these plates were. Being Taiwanese Chinese and vegetarian for 3 years, I can vouch that other chinese vegetarian places would not charge as much. 
Theyre usually around $8 per plate and for a plate of steamed veggies would NOT be $14! It would be much cheaper than the regular plate, around $6-7.",8Wh_4rVtW9f7kUd3Ayhg9A,0,0,2,DPeIYqpijZDtEWgvfrionw

There are SO many vegan options in Vegas which is fantastic but this place is BY FAR the best vegan place I have ever been to. In Vegas or otherwise... First, the menu seems to have almost unlimited options, with all your 'old favorites'.  Can make it a little hard to decide what to get, but I think that's a pretty good problem to have, especially when I don't think you can go wrong, no matter what you order. 

My husband ended up getting the Kung Pao that came with beef, chicken and shrimp. We were immediately amazed at how real the shrimp looked and tasted. The portion was very generous, and there was tons of everything, including veggies. My husband asked to have the dish made mild in spice and they graciously made the change. It did not sacrifice the flavor at all!! 

I got the spicy crispy beef and it was life changing! The 'beef' was sliced thin, fried and then tossed in the most amazing and flavorful sauce, all topped with crushed peanuts and a side of steamed broccoli. The texture and flavor was amazing and I ate almost every bite even though I was stuffed.

We also ordered the house fried rice for the kids and it came with chicken, shrimp and ham. Along with a bunch of veggies and pineapple. Again, incredibly yummy! The kids both enjoyed it and ate many helpings of it. 

All of this and it doesn't even touch on the great service. They are attentive, kind, patient and very speedy. What more could you ask for. From the moment we got there we felt welcome and taken care of. We were in a little bit of a hurry, not that we said that or anything, and we were in and out in less than 45min.

So near closing time you would think they would just chance it and seat the couples instead of waiting for a chance of a large party--which never came as after closing the 3-4 large tables were still empty.  
Aside from that the food is amazing, fast service, hot, loads of fresh vegetables; General Tzo chicken had great flavor; date had Mongolian beef was good but nothing like the General Tzo great flavor.  Things are fried so I wouldn't say it's all healthy (I don't know what oils they use to wok fry) but I was happy. Not a vegan or vegetarian and love this plaice so much I'm bringing carnivore friends to try.  

Tip:  place is upstairs in a the corner (use the stairwell to the right if you're facing supermarket).  Parking better after market closes.  The plaza has a picnic table outside so looks nice if you sit outside and eat to go.",bCrTTcRjj4RkKIJ68TVYtw,0,0,4,rR-FMGxsDkTnFDNIvaLs0w

Roti curry - 4 stars (I cut one star coz being an Indian i know roti can get better but totally loved it here)
Spicy crispy eggplant - 5 star
Veggie soup with lunch combo - 5 star
Tofu in spicy schezwan sauce - 4 star
Overall this place is a must try for not only vegetarians but for all. I cut one star only because the dishes were not that spicy i wanted them to be. I would have given 4 and half if yelp had allowed me to do so.

I loved the hints of Thai basil and ginger--could have used even more of both.   We asked for it spicy (5 out of 10), but it arrived without heat.   The waitress kindly brought a small dish of chili pepper sauce.   There was really enough for 2 on this $10 entree.  

Now for the shrimp with walnut sauce, which was surprisingly horrible.   The shrimp itself was probably OK, but it was slathered up with soy mayonnaise.   It was visually unappealing as well.   We asked Chef Kenny about the sauce and he returned moments later proudly holding a jar of store bought soy mayonnaise.    This is one short cut that should have been avoided.   Chef Kenny--please rethink this dish.   It would have been a winner if you had 3 dipping sauces for the shrimp.   Perhaps a sriracha sauce (siracha blended with soy mayo), a curry sauce, or a cilantro sauce.  Email me and we can work on this together.  I can visualize this dish with 3 little dipping bowls on the plate with a little cilantro or basil garnish.   Clean, colorful, simple, and gives the customer the choice of condiments.

Oh, enter the restaurant from the front which faces Spring Mountain Rd.   Just go up the stairs and look for Suite 203 in the corner in the middle of the mall.   If you park around back, you will miss the beautiful entry way.

Those were my EXACT words when I tried the sesame chicken. This place is definitely worth a try. The chef here is a magician.. its like turning a cow to tofu while still maintaining the same beef texture. Neat-o! Overall the quality of the food was good however the flavors were just.. not quite right. Everything tasted like soy sauce to me. The restaurant was super clean and the service was great. 

Here's a list of what my friends and I ordered:

Sesame chicken: This was probably my favorite dish. The texture of the 'chicken' and the crunchiness of the coating was really just perfect. The flavor however was a little off for me.

Crunchy spicy eggplant: Definitely a must order.  

Pineapple duck: This was probably my least favorite dish. The texture of the 'duck' was alright with me however the flavor tasted a little burnt to me. Can't really describe it but it didn't taste good to me. 

Walnut shrimp: One of my favorites from dinner too. Texture was good and flavor was good.",cdCvHUFdssePxowTHIo3dQ,4,2,4,L0w-lpJhXp62eGMRUutrQA

It came with a refreshing soup reminiscent of an egg drop soup but with tofu. The General chicken arrived and looked like chicken, tasted like chicken, even smelled like chicken.  I have no idea what the ""chicken"" was made out of and had to ask several times if it was in fact...chicken.  This same analysis was conducted will sampling the GF's ""beef"" and broccoli.

The Paid Thai came with veggies and what looked like 'shrimp'. The 'shrimp' had the taste and texture of real shrimp.

I've tried a variety of dishes here and I've yet to be disappointed; Pan-Fried Noodles, Mongolian Beef, Wonton Soup, Beef Ramen, Sweet and Soup Chicken, Jasmine tea, BUN ROLL!! You need to order a fried bun roll.. Thank me later.

This place is vegan/vegetarian and they serve no meat.. What? Yes. I tell my bestie every single time that they should put quotes around all their meat products so people don't get so darn confused. Their meat, it's not real- but trust me, it's a good thing. Especially when it just hits the table, it'll have you scratching your head. Once it cools, the ""meat"" starts to get a bit of texture, but it still pretty great. If you have the thing and you can't do textures, you're probably safer sticking to something with veggies instead.

All the food I've had here has been really great, even if the service is a little shoddy. Don't let that deter you.

My husband ordered the Kung Pao chicken and I ordered spring rolls and Lemon Chicken.  The kung Pao chicken was one of the best vegan version my husband had ever tasted.  I agreed with him.  Now the bad stuff.  The spring rolls were small and cut into two to make it look like four pieces but they were small and not as flavorful as others I have had.  They served them with sweet and sour but no spicy mustard sauce :(  My presentation of my Lemon Chicken had my mouth salivating.  Unfortunately that is where my dining experience went further down hill.  The chicken lacked flavor and was rubbery.  I thought about sending it back and ordering something else.

Delicious fake meat isn't achieved just by a good sauce. It needs the texture and correct preparation for everything to be on point. This restaurant is a wonderful gem for vegans and non-vegans alike. 

Service was attentive and I liked the green, tropical environment. It gave me asian spa oasis vibes. We got three roti with curry appetizer dishes, orange chicken lunch special and spicy beef lunch special. The roti with curry was so unique and delicious. The curry was really good. It had amazingly soft potatoes (I believe) enveloped in its goodness. The roti was soft and pulled apart easily. The orange chicken tasted exactly like orange chicken. What is this sorcery?! Honestly, if anything, it tasted better than most orange chickens I've tried (most certainly better than Panda Express). The sauce was tangy also. The spicy beef was delicious. This dish wasn't as believable as the orange chicken but still was really good. I really like the variety of ""meat"" options. 

I feel like this is a good place for vegans to bring non-vegan friends and everyone will be happy!

I am from an area in southern California that has a lot of vegan options so I have had really fantastic vegan food. Plus I personally make 3 meals a day for my family so I used to eating clean healthy food. I was very disappointed with my experience here. When I walked in I was greeted and seated immediately. It was a typical Vegas hot day so I was super thirsty. After being seated we didn't even get water till at least 10min after being seated. The waitress and chef were so interested in schmoozing with customers they knew rather than being attentive to new customers. After stressing that I REALLY would like some water my waitress brought a full pitcher of water to what I thought was going to be my table but instead filled the glasses of the table next to me! really?!

In addition to no meat or diary my family also avoids oil. So I told the waitress to have my meal made w little oil as possible. One dish came back un-edible. The reason I didn't give a one star rating was because the chef immediately scooped that dish off our table and had them make us another dish. The second dish was good except why all the sauce? It was more like a soup dish than a noodle dish. My recommendation would be to ask for ALL sauces on the side. They completely saturate their dishes in sauce and its like eating soup. too bad.... I will not go back here nor would I recommend it unless you are ok with fried, oily, sauce saturated meals. 

It was also a turn off to see the chef pull up a chair and sit with customers bragging about himself. If you are a regular and you know the chef then you are definitely treated more special.

But, as in Vegas, there's everything to eat under the sun.  We did a little Yelp search and found Veggie House.   The group of five of us begrudgingly went kicking and screaming at the whim of the one on the vegan diet.  We had NO idea what to expect......

We often go up Spring Mountain for good Asian cuisine.  We haven't been disappointed yet.   Veggie House was awesome!  It's located upstairs in a building full of other restaurants.   We went during lunch hour - not too busy, which translated to exceptional service.  We always had a full glass of water, plates cleared immediately as we finished and a full pot of tea for the table.  The service was friendly and superb.

We ordered a lot of dishes to be served family style.  As appetizers, we ordered house veggie soup, fried veggie dumplings, happy rolls and lettuce wraps.   Main dishes we tried Kung Pao V Chicken, Spicy Veggie Crispy Beef, Crispy Spicy Eggplant, Buddha Delight and Veggie Roast Pork.  The meal came with a selection of white or brown rice.  We chose brown. 

All I can say is WOW!   The food was completely amazing with a depth of flavors.  You would never know that it was all vegan! 100% meatless!  How do they do it?!   They had the ""meat"" textures just right - right down to the grooves on the beef.  With every bite, we all looked at each other around the table in sheer bewilderment at how wonderfully savory the flavors and textures were.  

Our vegan friend smiled from her plate and said:  ""See, I told you so!""  We all looked at her and agreed.   Veggie House would be a great option for Lent!",JaI9g5DdiwNNXnyA82107Q,0,0,5,LHSu07u13pFx7O5HzuAQ8A

Now that being said. . .when I first went to Veggie House. . .I was wondering how I was going to like the fake meat.  Trust me. . .I had serious doubts. . .but my friends wanted to go and try it, so I went along with them. . .

Maybe it was because my expectations were so low. . .that first time. . .but everything that we had was DELICIOUS and so on point.  I think I asked the wait staff about 5 times in that meal. . .you sure this is not real meat???  =)  The textures of the differnet meats that we had were really to close to what you would think the real stuff would be like.  We had crispy beef, crispy eggplant, General Tzo's chicken and some other items that I can not remember the name of. . .they were all surpisingly on point!

One of my friends actually had an issue with the texture of his pork dish. . .and you know what?  I tried it and honestly. . .the texture of the fake pork was the texture of the real pork in the same dish in other chinese restaurants I had before.  The texture tended to be a little on the chewy side and Veggie House was true to form. . .they made the fake pork like it was supposed to be!  crazy. . .crazy delicious!!  =)

On my second trip. . .i had their crispy beef again. . .and it did not disappoint. . .it was so good!!  Loved it!

I also had their Cilantro salad. . .and OMG. . .if you are a cilatnro fan like me. . .you will love this salad.  They chopped cilantro tossed it in a soy sauced vinegrette with a slgiht kick and mixed it with slices of pressed tofu and some fried eggroll skins for texture. . .it was freaking delicious!  I could eat it everyday and I probably would not get tired of it.  =)

I also had their Roti with curry which the serve told me was one of their more popular apps. . .this was one of the dishes that I did not like as much.  The roti was awesome!  BUT the curry was a little on the too sweet side for me.  As I progressed and ate more of the curry. . .the flavors did deepen and I was able to taste more of the nuances of the dish. . .but the sweetness lasted througout and it kind of made it weird for me.  This was the only dish that I had that was NOT a 5 star dish.  

Ambiance. . .(4/5)  It's a little weird inside as it reminds me of huts with straw roofs. . .but for the most part I can ignore it and just focus on the great food.  =)

Service. . .very prompt and very cordial (5/5).

Now if all vegan places tasted as good as Veggie House. . .I could be a vegan but until that time I will enjoy my vegan meals here. . .and enjoy the real stuff elsewhere.  =)  I will definitely be back!",L3DxG0n3lRq5N2lv1QNrrA,6,4,5,9rBMnGqpqJb9mDIZZ9r-pg

After extensively perusing reviews here and the menu online, I finally went in to order my takeout- wonton ramen soup, spicy crispy eggplant with brown rice, and green tea ice cream with sticky rice.

The spicy crispy eggplant is out of this world. It's amazing, and I'd come back just for this dish- side of brown rice wasn't even necessary. Delicious way to have eggplant, and despite being a sticky and almost sweet sauce it did not feel like a heavy meal. 

The won ton soup was a bit underwhelming. I did appreciate how the noodles were packed separately for my takeout order so as not to fall apart in the broth, and I liked the won tons themselves. But the broth was lacking. I liked the green taste to it, and it oddly reminded me of a green smoothie, except in broth form. As in, you could taste the veggie vibrancy. But it was still somehow flat. Noodles were also much thinner than I prefer, and seemed to simply be thin spaghetti rather than ramen.

The dessert was underwhelming as well. The green tea ice cream melted very quickly and was also lacking in flavor- I've experienced varieties with more of a chalky texture but stronger machta taste, but this version was on the thin side rather than creamy. Also struck me as odd that the sticy rice was orange.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,9,3,3,dtAISbksfTqewrkZu5iVMA

1939624,2013-06-28,2,AtD6B83S4Mbmq0t7iDnUVA,"As much as i like this place i often find my liking reduced to a handful of dishes off the lunch menu.

First off the food is very light and a bit on the bland side. more often than not i find myself wondering if i could get away with asking for some table salt or some soy sauce but that'll defeat the purpose of eating wholesome healthy vegetarian food.

Another reason i like Veggie house is the food doesnt exactly bloat you up unlike...well pretty much everything else. It's a good feeling of full without actually physically feeling like you're gut is going to explode. 

Recommendations?
Ice cream is always a good choice as they get supplied from Perfect Scoop so expect yummy high quality hand made ice cream 100% of the time, all the time.

The crispy spicy beef has got to be one of the greatest items on the menu. Not judging this based on taste, if this was a taste game then the rating would be 5 stars not 4. This is due to the texture of the faux beef. Other items such as the kung pow beef or beef with broccoli the texture is close to a tofu like mushroom and carries a similar taste if it wasn't for the sauces.

So overall this place is definitely worth a stop for lunch but dont expect a 100% accurate vegetarian replacement for meat.

As for the vegetarian alternatives for fish...we'll see about that in the updated review...

The owner is a charming and gracious woman. And the dish- I had oyster mushroom and lemongrass sauce- was tasty. My friend, a confirmed meat-man, liked the soup and the spring rolls very much. The fried oyster mushroom had that juicy interior that all fried foods should have, but don't. A big plus. My guess is that most people would find the Veggie House surprisingly good. However...the sodium and fat that is added in order to accomplish the transformation of vegey  into meat taste is, for me anyway, overpowering.

I also like that this is another ""corporate chef"" who decided to strike out on his own and enrich our city's dining diversity. It is run by a very small staff, so be patient. And be clear...if the waitress doesn't seem to understand you, point to it on the menu. And try to figure out where the bird chirps are coming from, while you wait for your meal :-)",0DRa4GSTSml7vpwAFfRXjQ,2,1,5,1HS6efXJbcYRox5oym5R4A

2125232,2012-10-22,0,AtD6B83S4Mbmq0t7iDnUVA,"A phenomenal hidden gem near the Las Vegas Strip! My husband and I recently moved from the Bay area where we had a variety of vegan restaurant options. Moving to Vegas was disheartening because the dining choices are not as vegan friend as we used to. When a group of friends visited from Cali, they were considered enough to offer going to a vegan restaurant. From the group of 6, I was the only vegan, my friend was a pescatarian and the rest of the group were omnivores/carnivores. 

We ordered a variety of dishes and a total of four soups, which were initially brought out. One soup was better than the other and I was continually amazed at the phenomenal taste and authentic flavors of each soup. My friends were equally delighted. As the dishes came out, everybody was amazed how ""real"" the food tasted. In fact, one of them apparently did not even realize he was eating imitation meat! He just thought that the restaurant was vegan friendly but that they had meat options. This is a guy who eats meat for every meal!

After hearing  everyone's very positive feedback, a few days later I invited another visitor friend of mine to try their dining experience. She absolutely loved it as well. 

After the first visit to say the least, I've gone back a lot more. Each time, the atmosphere has been very relaxing and zen; the staff very approachable and extremely friendly; the food has been consistently delicious!!

Overall, this place is definitely my new go-to place for everything- whether it'd be to treat a cold, take our guests, or just have a great time. (When I feel a bit under the weather or get a cold, their soups are a must. I completely recover the day after!)

If you're a local, whether vegan or not, this place is a must to check out! If you've visiting, they're very close to the strip so be sure to visit for a very relaxing and delicious experience. 

NOTE FOR THE VEGANS: If you are Vegan, make sure to let the staff know. I was told that some of their foods may contain eggs- but nothing more. Make sure to ask and they'll let you know the dishes that are off limits.",ki0puqJcbcpWZHRETLH0Kw,1,1,5,BNK1nd0WNQ3_k2Y2daZFDA

I stopped in this shopping mall and wandered through a couple places before I finally decided on Veggie House. When I looked at the menu the price was right and the options sounded more like what I was hungry for on a cold day.

I walked in and was quickly seated. The server quickly got my drink order and I had a big pot of green tea to warm me up. I decided on the General Tzo chicken, which is not really chicken but I'm ok with that. It came with a yummy house soup that was this tasty celery broth that I could have eaten a gallon of, but luckily just had the cup. Not long after I finished that up the server promptly brought out my ""chicken"" and brown rice. It was the perfect lunch size and I ate the whole thing happily. Even though it was fried, the ""chicken"" was greasy and the sauce was tasty.

The grand total for lunch and green tea was less than $9 so score one for an affordable, quick, tasty lunch.

OK, so don't hate me if you come here to eat and the restaurant is full of newborns. There's a reason Veggie House has a 5 star Yelp rating, and the reviews weren't written by infants. I just think it's worth noting that when we entered the restaurant, my daughter was awake and started to become a little fussy. However, I think a combination of the Chinese serenity chimes music and the soothing waterfall next to our table helped her drift off into a nap while we ate. The dining room was quiet with only 2 other tables occupied. (I shouldn't make these claims without mentioning that you won't find a table for diaper changes in the rest room.)

The roti with curry sauce was great as an appetizer, and the crispy eggplant was as good as other reviewers have noted. I liked the ginger in the flavorful sauce coating the eggplant fries. My husband enjoyed his ""chicken"" fried rice, but the flavor of this dish (maybe from the egg) was not at all appetizing to me. I've had some bad experiences looking for vegetarian entrees in various Chinatown restaurants, so I'm excited to return to Veggie House to try more of the menu! Both waitresses were very friendly and the service shined, down to demonstrating how to tear the roti with forks and dip it in the curry sauce. The chef uses quality ingredients and puts care into each dish. I'll stick to the tofu and vegetable options, as I don't want any fake shrimp floating around on my plate.

2240544,2013-11-16,0,AtD6B83S4Mbmq0t7iDnUVA,"Found this place on yelp while we were running errands in their area. Previous reviews mention that it is a 'vegan' restaurant and I want to clarify that since they use eggs, including some of the noodles, it is a vegetarian restaurant, but there is no shortage of options to choose if you so desire a vegan meal. 

We ordered the crispy wanton appetizer, veggie house soup, crispy beef, crispy scallop, and the fried rice with egg. 

The filling in the wonton was sort of a veggie mash that was bland and the wonton wrapper was thick and rather starchy. You definitely needed to dip it in the sweet sauce that accompanied the dish. 

The soup was a mild cabbage broth with celery, bits of carrot, fennel, and tofu cubes. I found myself adding more and more white pepper to season it. I appreciate low sodium in dishes, but it still should be seasoned well to avoid a blah blandness. 

The crispy beef was pretty tasty. You have to eat it right away or the sauce gooeys the crispyness into mush. The crushed peanuts on top added a nice texture. The broccoli that was served along side the dish was just steamed and a bit on the cool side when it reached our table. 

The crispy spicy scallops had a sweet in spicy sauce that had red bell peppers and thinly sliced Persian cucumbers. The scallops were good for me but my partner couldn't get over the chewy texture. They use giant oyster mushroom stems to make the scallops. There was definitely a taste of mushroom. Not the dish for you if you don't like mushrooms. 

The fried rice had raisins, pineapple, peas, egg, veggie ham, and veggie crab. The rice was typical fried rice in flavor with a small note of sweetness from the raisins and pineapple. The veggie ham pieces were so small, you didn't even notice them. The veggie crab had the consistency of little gelatinous snot balls and did nothing for the dish. I picked them out. 

The service was great. Our server was overly happy and constantly smiling and even brought our toddler a free bowl of steamed rice.
 The ice tea is worth noting. They brew it there using red tea leaves. It was crisp and refreshing and we prob had 5 refills. The green tea is not loose leaves but is in a tea bag added to your tea pot. 

I would not go out of my way to come back, but if I was in close proximity, and hungry, and it was lunch time so I could get the $6.50 lunch special, then I'd prob pop in for more of that crispy beef.

So 2 stars for the food and an extra for our friendly server.",HcAyy3XZTCMSMjtg74k36Q,0,0,3,2LipIARAOyTNSujgm4cpYQ

I came with my boyfriend who is a spicy food addict (we are talking about eating habaneros like popcorn, or adding ghost pepper, Carolina reapers and Scorpio Trinidad to his everyday meals, not jalapeños). 
He order the Chicken Kung Pao extra spicy , and was pretty amazing. Even I had to steal half of his plate because... well, sharing is caring.
I order the cilantro salad, I really liked it but I wish it was a little bit more sour.
I also got the oyster mushrooms with lemongrass sauce. I have to say that as someone who used to eat oyster mushrooms on a daily basis, I didn't like that they battered them and deep fried them. Those mushrooms are super tasty per se, so in my opinion they should just sauté them on the wok. BUT, the flavor was pretty good. I'm not complaining, I just didn't feel like deep fried stuff.

I basically obligated my boyfriend to order desert for himself, because I can't eat sugar right now but I needed to try their sweet side. He got the sticky rice with vanilla ice cream and it was pretty good. He didn't complain and took him 5 seconds to eat it all.

Overall, the service is super nice, the ambiance is pretty busy (Thursday at 12:30) and we are coming back for sure, because they have a pretty big menu and I'm gonna have to try it all.

After living in a small town in Tennessee for two years, the options here are limitless.

We arrived there for a late dinner.  We ordered the Spring Rolls, Sesame ""Chicken,"" and House Chow Fun.  Their servings are massive.  If you just walked up from the street and had no idea this was a vegetarian place, you wouldn't be able to tell the difference.  We felt we cheated on our pescatarian diet after eating here.  That's how real it tasted.  The dishes come with your choice of brown or steamed rice.  We shared both dishes and we were stuffed to our gills.  

The service was great.  All the servers were attentive and made sure we were happy by filling up our drinks and asking if we needed anything.  We need to try their desserts next time.  We were so full, we couldn't eat another morsel.

Staying on the Las Vegas strip it is easy to get used to the hospitality and service given to you, but the hostess, waitress, and even  the chef at Veggie House outdid the entire strip.  The restaurant is very clean, well lit, and nicely decorated.  The background music and water fountains are extremely soothing.

Being from Hawaii I have eaten a lot of Chinese food, and being an eleven year vegan, I have eaten a lot of vegan food and Veggie House has the best of both! I went there three days in a row out of my five day vacation and would have gone more if my vacation was any longer.  
Every item I tried, I loved,  from the crispy eggplant to the Buddha delight.  My mouth is watering just thinking about dining there again.  Even my non vegan date loved the food,  maybe even more than I did!   Also the mock meat dishes are so convincing, I am pretty sure you can bring a meat eater there and they wouldn't be the wiser.

It's funny and incredibly ironic that you obviously know yelp but even better that you actually review the restaurant afterward complaining it's fake meat! Maybe you should use yelp to gain insight on the restaurant before you go rather than using yelp to complain about a place that only serves ""fake meat"". What is wrong with people?!? 

Very cute restaurant is a strip mall in an Asian district (we saw thai, Japanese and Chinese places). We found this place on yelp and decided to try it out as me and the SO are vegetarians. The restaurant is hard to see up on the 2nd floor from the parking lot entrance...

We ordered pick up and it was already waiting for us when we got there. Price was great for the amount of food we got. Sweet and sour chicken had some odd chewy pieces (maybe trying to replicate real chicken dishes?) General tso's wad great as well as the spring rolls. 

Food was hot and well packaged to go. Restaurant had super cute decor.

Lady who helped us was really nice.

Knocked that 1 star off because of the chewy pieces in the sweet and sour (about 10% of them) but we will be back.

I looked up vegan friendly places before my visit to Vegas & this place popped up. I made it a MUST GO TO on my trip. Chinese/Asian food is pretty much my favorite type of food and it sucks that most places you go to don't have many veggie friendly options. It wasn't too far from the strip either, I'd say about 10 minutes max, and on the way you start to feel like your in an Asian country because you reach Chinatown and everything is Asian themed, so cool to see. Upon walking up the sign on the door was awesome lol ""no meat allowed"" inside the establishment, I'm like ""this is my type of restaurant.""

The place was pretty busy too which makes me so happy to see. I ordered the General Tso's chikin and it was BOMB. Perfectly sweet and the side of white rice was cooked just right. My meat loving significant other was stealing my bowl and eating some too, he really liked it which says a lot. The portion for the price was a little less than I'd like because I paid about $13 for the one entree but I would definitely pay it all over again, it's worth it.

Had been looking forward to trying this spot, and our meal was more hit than miss. The space has a Zen vibe with a fountain, plants and chimes. Wait staff were super friendly and helpful. 

We shared three dishes family style: the much lauded (and rightfully so) crispy, addictive eggplant, ma pao tofu (I'm a huge fan of soft tofu, but I think it needed spice) and curry ""fish"" (we'd ordered black bean but ate it anyway) Here is where the former vegan in me (sooo obnoxious as a Cal undergrad that I would not ingest honey ""because bees worked to make it"" thank goodness I got over myself!) is not a big fan of faux meats, but they seem to be the norm. The ""fish"" had a great sauce with tamarind kick, but texture was somewhat of an issue for all of us. Included in the price was brown (!) rice and a vegetable consommé which was soothing but a little bland. 

For 8$ each, inclusive of tax and tip, we ate well and enjoyed the experience.

2640845,2014-06-13,3,AtD6B83S4Mbmq0t7iDnUVA,"We love veggie house! I have now visited this place at least 5 times and they have never failed. Some dishes in my opinion, are better than others, but I think the trick is figuring out what you like. Veggie house is a very cute restaurant with a small pond, gazebo, and twinkle lights all in one place. The servers are always very sweet and have not trouble understanding English. They are also patient when my friends and I roll in with 5-7 children as well as accomodating to their needs (forks, smaller water cups, removal of hot tea glasses, etc). Now, let's get to the good stuff.

The spicy crispy eggplant is seriously as good as everyone says. They're like slightly more fiberous (and nutritionally rich) variation of french fries tossed in a sweet and spicy sauce. They are crispy and the flavors are out of this world. We get this every time, but I recommend that this is not ordered to go as they will obviously lose their crisp texture. We get this as an appetizer because everyone just grabs heaping loads onto their plate and is a fantastic appetite-teaser. Their roti with chicken curry is also amazing! We tried it for the first time two days ago and had to put in a second order because the kids couldn't get enough. Even though I make roti (the frozen variation) at home, it had nothing on the light and puffed up roti that was served with that perfect curry. 

My favorite entree is probably the eggplant with tofu because it has thai basil in it! I love basil, so I am unfairly biased to any dish that has basil in it, but this dish is fantastic. The tofu in it is somehow better than in other dishes. A definite winner. Another awesome dish is the braised tofu with veggies because of the HUGE assortment of veggies that come with it. Everything from bok choy, to snap peas, to mushrooms can all be found alongside the braised tofu. My kids of course love the chow fun because what kid doesn't love noodles? The texture and the abundance of veggies is what I dream of from other restaurants. 

While I do cook with a lot of ""fake meat"" at home, I am not a fan of some of the fake meat items from here. Even my husband, who loves his animal products suggests that we go sans-fake-meat because he prefers the vegetable dishes here. The texture of some of the chicken (orange chicken, simmering beef plate) dishes are very strange. They're made from a chinese vegetable with a lot of different layers and are kind of tough and chewy compared to real chicken, but the chicken inside the curry chicken was nothing like this. I don't know how they determine which type of ""fake meat"" to use for which dish, but I say try them all and see what you like. 

Lastly, they have vegan ice cream here and the cherry chocolate chip is on point!! My friends ordered the cherry chip while I got the green tea, and I was envious after I tried theirs that I was stuck with the green tea. Don't pass up the vegan ice cream, or the 10% Yelp check-in offer that they're currently offering. Come one come all for those that are looking to add a little extra veggies to their diet. I promise they'll come in a tasty way.",EKEtbkIswDNQqxcy8vy8Kw,6,3,4,ha1_Z218MmtF-OoxlVAK8g
2647826,2018-05-16,0,AtD6B83S4Mbmq0t7iDnUVA,"Prior to being a vegetarian, I used to LOVE eating Chinese food but found it extremely difficult to do because many of the Chinese restaurants I would go to would be laced with meat products in some way, shape, or form. So, I was happy to find a Chinese restaurant vegetarian friendly (vegan, even). 

I went to dinner here on Mother's Day and it wasn't too crowded. The place is small and very old-looking but don't let that bother you. The menu options here are insane. I had to double check with our server, Jeffrey, just to make sure that even exotic menu items like their shark fin soup was actually vegan...it was, wow! I have been a vegetarian for years now and was so glad that I could, for the first time, pick from the entire menu at a Chinese restaurant. It was an exhilarating feeling! 

We ordered the Mushroom V Chicken, Spicy Pad Thai Noodles, Kung Pao Chicken, Hot Spicy Szechuan Tofu, a shrimp dish that I don't remember the name of, and Spring Rolls. Everything was good except the Mushroom V Chicken and the shrimp. With the shrimp, it had the same texture as real shrimp but had this really odd taste that was far from shrimp-like. Depending on a number of variables, that might be good or bad to others. I never liked shrimp even before I was a vegetarian because it had a certain taste, but this vegan shrimp had such an odd taste that I did not care for it.

Something that spoke to me even more than the food, though, was the customer service. In all my experience eating at Chinese restaurants, I have never seen good customer service until I came here. In my experience, employees at Chinese restaurants are mean, have an attitude, yell at you, and even act like serving you is a chore. Here at Veggie House is a completely different story. I was so surprised to see and hear servers providing exceptional customer service to customers. Our own server, Jeffery, was amazing too! He'd even joke around with us, making us laugh and adding a really comfortable air to our table. The other servers would even come around to other tables asking if they needed anything and refilling their waters. Amazing staff here that I hope is consistent throughout their hours of service. 

I would certainly come back here to try other menu items, even bringing along my non-vegetarian family members. I very much appreciate a business such as Veggie House catering to vegetarians and vegans who sorely miss eating Chinese food.",Jc-bW5Mzktn0o65r3-I1aw,0,0,4,Z1CVJVEgVvWIzKLjrWCWyA

Spicy Crispy Beef *****
Cajun Fried Fish ***
Cherry Chocolate Chip Ice Cream *****
Green Tea Ice Cream ***
Vegan Thai Tea *****
House Vegetable Soup *****

I keep re-ordering the Sesame Chicken it even taste good the next day re-heated. The Spicy Beef is excellent, but you have to eat it fresh, re-heated the next day is chewy.

I always order the Thai tea. I was surprised that I liked the cherry ice cream more than the green tea because I am a huge green tea fan, but I found the green tea ice cream too mild.

I will continue to try the other items on the menu and recommend Chef Kennys restaurant  to everyone. I am even thinking of getting him a thank-you card and a small gift.",nAVooYVZA_3tjWE2kGn9ew,1,0,5,P5CFjzSl5xUEUKaJUtghqQ

I have worked in restaurants my whole life and I have never had a more unwelcome experience. Needless to say, we won't be back. For everyone else, be sure to get there an hour before closing because they have zero respect for their patrons and give no leeway.

I love trying new food so I was all for it. I came in there with an open mind.  And to be honest, this place blew me away!

Lemon Chicken / Kung Pao Chicken- I could not even tell the difference. The meat felt and tasted just like chicken to me.  

House Fried Rice - This one is really one of the best things on their menu. It has ham, chicken and shrimp. He really got the texture and the flavors of the meats down. The way he made the shrimp, it looked and tasted like real shrimp. I have to constantly remind myself that all of these are made with vegetables. Maybe my mind was playing tricks on me!

Crispy Eggplant - By far, this one is my favorite! It was cooked in vegetarian oyster sauce. The flavor was so good! I love how it was cooked crispy on the outside and yet soft in the middle. This dish made me change my opinion of eggplants. 

Salt and Pepper Veggie Rib Strips - Like everything else that we tried, this one really felt like real meat in my mouth. It was a little tough but I guess most salt and pepper dishes are made that way. Or at least the ones I've had were always cooked a little dry. It's not really a savory dish but it was still a pretty good choice. 

I love how Chef Kenny was able to do all these things. I give this place five star for innovation. Even if you are disappointed with some things, the flavors are still spot on. I know that most vegan dishes are made out of tofu. And you know tofu given its texture, you cannot really do much with it. The way Chef Kenny made it possible for vegans to still be able to enjoy the taste of meat is such an amazing work of art. Science and art and some kind of magic!

I've got great service, quickly served food, drinks, and refills. You get good portions that feed 1-2 people just right. 

The food comes out fast but everything is fresh and well made. 

I'm not vegetarian but enjoy eating different non meat dishes. I enjoy the veggie beef and chicken a lot, it has flavor and texture is fair. I'm not a big fan of the shrimp but I don't really like shrimp anyway so that could just be me. 

My favorite is the house pan fried noodles that has all 3 meats and several veggies. I just ask for no shrimp and easy peppers. I do wish there was more consistency on what veggies that go into this dish, sometimes I get celery and bok choy but other times one is missing or not very much. Don't be afraid to ask for what you like as they are nice and quick to help. 

I'll certainly be back. I have brought other that were not vegetarian either and they were happy.

It isn't always easy to find good vegan food around. I came to Veggie House with my best friends. A married vegan couple and my 8 year old omnivorous daughter. We were seated immediately and helped at once by our server,  Don. The menus stated on them ""Proud to be Vegan"". My friend, still skeptical about the menu asked a lot of questions to our server, Don. Don was incredibly knowledgeable about the menu and spoke not only patiently, but enthusiastically about the menu. It was apparent that he was proud of the establishment he worked for. What a breath of fresh air! He was very kind. My daughter tried so hard to use her chopsticks, but couldn't master it. Another sweet lady server came by our table and made a sort of ""chopstick trainer for her"". It was very nice. We ordered and shared 5 entrees between us.

Food: Flavorful, great texture, and not overly sauced/seasoned. 
To start, we ordered the Happy Roll and Spring Rolls. Though I am not a fan of crispy vegetables in a roll, I had to give them a try! Like I said, crispy veggies aren't my thing but the roll was good with the crisp and sauce and I'm happy I tried it. My sister absolutely loved these. The spring rolls had a great and light crisp outside, with a creamy steamed vegetable texture fill -- great combo and VERY flavorful.

Next we ordered the Chow Mein noodles -- I'll be dreaming of this plate. The ""beef, chicken, and shrimp"" within this dish were mind blowing. Our dad isn't Vegan but absolutely enjoyed the ""meat"". 

The sweet and sour chicken were crisped to perfection, I couldn't believe it! Our dad ordered a steamed broccoli plate incase he wasn't a fan of the ""meats"". Turns out that because everything was so delicious, that was his least favorite dish.

Service/Staff:
Kenny was a great host and our waitress was very attentive. We also had other staff members check on us but it wasn't too much nor interrupting to our meal or experience.

I really have no idea what this meat is made of but it's incredible to think that the taste is so close to the real thing.  Honestly, you put their dishes next to the real thing and do a blind taste test and you'd certainly have trouble.  I only tried a few dishes but each was very good.  I had to try the kung pao chicken as I hear many people really enjoy that.  I also wanted tot try to the vegan bbq appetizer as I'm a big char siu fan.  To begin, the kung pao was your typical dish with zucchini, peanuts, peppers, and their rendition of chicken.  I thought it could have had more spice, but overall the portion size was solid and the dish had a good taste.  The bbq pork didn't quite have the strong tast of a char siu, but it was pretty close, especially in Vegas where it's very hard to find a quality bbq Chinese pork.  The prices were maybe a $1 or $2 higher than other take out Chinese, but the uniqueness and selection was great and I believe worth the extra few bucks.  They have a vegan burger joint opening up as well, so I will surely come back to Veggie House and try their beef and fish dishes and also try Vegeway when it opens in late September 2016.",JaqcCU3nxReTW2cBLHounA,1,0,4,jTTWOkR-V-qKQKDdE1Mj_Q

2. Spicy crispy eggplant: amazing flavor!!! Another popular choice. Taste and looks exactly like fries but healthier and tastier. Bit sweet and spicy and crunchy! Definitely eat it in the restaurant because it will get soggy if you take away.

3. Veggie pan fried noodles: AMAZING. Very hot (temperature), crispy, excellent gravy, and tons of veggies and sit shrimps. Another must try! 

4. Curry tamarind fish with veggies: Nice curry taste but too sour for our liking. We ended up changing the order to regular curry and it was much better. The fish is soy and wrapped in seaweed for the ""fish"" taste. Not bad but not my favorite because of the tofu texture which throws off my taste buds.

The crispy beef is so god damn good. Bomb is an understatement. It looks, smells and tastes like Chinese beef!

The orange chicken was just as good, but I liked the beef better.

Their shrimp looks just like real shrimp and basically has the same texture. I personally wouldn't order it again, I just didn't care for the taste.

The wontons were amazing, I don't know exactly what's in them but they were pretty damn good. We just wished it came with more since there was four of us and we ended up with an odd number.

Tom Yum Soup, never heard of it till then but BEWARE: It is shit your pants spicy! If you enjoy eating hot lava, then you will probably love this soup. But if I were you, I would just spare your butthole the fiery burn that you will inevitably experience later on, and avoid the Tom Yum Soup.

The flavor of the dish was delicious and the texture of the ""chicken"" reminded me of the gardein boneless wings from Yardhouse. The vegetable seafood lo mein was a mixed bag. I was really expecting thicker noodles but the restaurant used something akin to instant ramen noodles and the dish had to be sent back to get heated up because it was tepid. Bleh! Once it was heated up it was good. One thing though, my wife and I were fascinated by the ""shrimp"" in the seafood mix.

The menu is fairly extensive with lots of faux-meat dishes. I ended up ordering the crispy spicy eggplant and roast pork. I will echo some other Yelpers' comments that there are a lot of deep fried foods covered in sauce, so while everything is meatless, it is not necessarily healthy.

Nonetheless, I enjoyed both of my dishes. The crispy spicy eggplant had a nice crisp, but wasn't spicy at all, and a little too sweet (perhaps too much sauce?) for me. Portions were medium, and I was full only after finishing everything. Without my Groupon, the total would have been almost $30 after tax/tips. Thus, Veggie House isn't exactly cheap.

However, service was outstanding. The employees are very friendly and have a lot of pride in their food and this restaurant. They are more than happy to answer questions or explain dishes on the menu.

FOOD
+Vegetable Soup: This is a complimentary bowl of soup that comes with your order(s). Swimming in a light broth are chopped carrots, celery, onions, and cabbage. The soup is on the bland side and is in need of salt or other seasonings to give it some life. 

+Walnut Shrimp:  Lightly battered and fried ""shrimp"" in mayonnaise sauce that's topped with toasted walnuts. Sure enough, it tasted like walnut shrimp. Could've fooled me into thinking it was real shrimp I was biting into. Mayonnaise sauce is a bit much, and I had to wipe the excess off onto my plate.  

+Yee Shang: Soft pieces of eggplant wading in a sweet and spicy sauce. I asked our waitress how spicy is the dish, and she said the chef could prepare it ""very spicy"", which was what I ordered. When I took a bite out of my eggplant, I tasted no spiciness whatsoever. I took another bite thinking that if the first one didn't hit me then the second one will. Nope. Mouth wasn't on fire. Our waitress returned and asked if the eggplant was spicy enough. I said it wasn't spicy at all. Even my friend who has a lower tolerance to spice agreed. So the waitress gave me a small saucer of hot chili sauce that helped resolved the minor issue (nice!). Spicy or not the eggplant is just as delicious without the extra heat.

+Crispy Oyster Mushroom: This was my friend's order. Deep fried oyster mushrooms and a side of white rice. Of course this was good, because it was deep fried! 

+Orders come with your choice of white or brown rice. If you order a lunch special ($6.50!), you can choose to order a bun instead.

SERVICE
Fantastic. The two waitresses were so kind and helpful. Even the chef came out from the kitchen to ask about our meal. The service made me feel welcome.

RESTAURANT
Aside from being clean and bright, this restaurant has a soothing quality to it, thanks to the fountain located on one end of the restaurant. Also, if someone claps or maybe drops a pot or pan in the back, a pair of fake birds start to chirp once their sensors go off. Definitely cute and unexpected. 

OVERALL
I'm rating Veggie House 4.50 Stars because of how both my orders had too much sauce, and also for the bland soup that was served prior to the main courses. Other than those criticisms, Veggie House has saved me a long trip to SoCal for vegetarian Chinese food. This is a return spot for me.",epkRB3J_oBEiyiwahvdmGg,8,4,4,W5jSuqS03nNJUI3yJlnGyg

Our good friend is vegetarian, so we all decided to pick out a dish. We ordered the crispy eggplant that was recommended by many yelpers, the crispy veggie scallops, and the steamed ginger chicken with brown rice.

The crispy eggplant was really delicious. As stated by some yelpers, they are like french fries, but with a twist!! It was topped off with garlic, which I love!!! The steamed ginger chicken was to die for!!! It amazes me that its not chicken, but it tastes like chicken!!! It was mind boggling. hahaha. As for the crispy veggie scallops, it was good, but not great. I think it is because I am a huge scallop lover and I love the real thing. As for the price, they give you A LOT of food for what you pay for. =) Since I am a piggy, more the food... the more the merrier!! ::CHOMP CHOMP::

The staff was incredibly nice. At one point, the waitress introduced us to Chef Kenny. He was so nice and humble.

3459594,2012-11-20,0,AtD6B83S4Mbmq0t7iDnUVA,"Having grown up in Singapore...Chinese vegetarian meals were a staple of my diet especially when we were eating out. The cuisine was essentially Chinese food with heavy Southeast Asian influences. 

When I came down to Veggie House, I was overjoyed to see the menu resembling what I was familiar with down by the Equator. And then, I found out that chef/owner Kenny Wang is a Malaysian! Mystery solved. 

The dishes that I have thoroughly enjoyed here include the following:

Roti Canai - With a heavenly curry dipping gravy that is ditto what I used to savor in Southeast Asia

Pork Chop - You can get a half order of this. Very inventive - 3 different textures (soft, fatty and then crispy) welded together and deliciously seasoned

Braised Tofu - The preparation of tofu is just fantastic. Soft beancurd lightly fried and then immersed in a brown gravy. Perfection. The vegetables on this dish were also so crisp and fresh!

Curry Vegetables with Tamarind Sauce - I love this take on curry. In Asia, it's called Assam Curry and is widely available and one of the most popular and tasty dishes. However, it's seldom prepared well outside Southeast Asia...Kenny's done a stellar job. Crispy potato pieces, brimming with veggies in a delicious curry sauce with that amazing tamarind tinge. 

Fried Rice and Flat Noodles - Yummy. Prepped the way I love it. Simple, tasty and satisfactory. 

Prices are very reasonable. Less than $7 for a lunch special (choice of brown/white rice or bread) served with soup. The restaurant itself is very pleasant...bright, clean and reasonably furnished. I love the waitresses. They are awesome!

This place is tucked away in Chinatown and I never would have come across it had it not been for Groupon, so I'm very thankful haha. The food here is really great, the service is fast and the entire staff is incredibly friendly and nice. The first time I ever went here the menu was a bit overwhelming and I didn't know what to choose but one of the servers was very open to make recommendations and I finally went with the Crispy Spicy Eggplant. This dish is a must try and I highly recommend it! I've dined here about 10 times and each time I try to get something different but I tend to always gravitate back to the CS Eggplant. As a vegan, this place was a god-send as it's not easy to find somewhere that has a variety of vegan dishes to choose from, and delicious ones at that. I've also brought my family here a few times and even though they are meat-eaters they still really enjoyed this place. Something else that I love about Veggie House is the portion size of all of their dishes. They really do give you a great sized portion that will fill you up and you may even have leftovers (if you can manage to get yourself to stop eating their delicious food, which is unlikely). Each time I'm in Vegas I have to go to Veggie House at least a couple times during my visit.

My friends and I ordered fish, crispy noodles with vegetables and ""shrimp,"" and crispy beef. You can obviously tell the fish wasn't really fish. It reminded me of tofu, but with a crispy lining which serves as the skin. The sauce was very salty, but was tasty nonetheless. The crispy noodles were good and I have to give props for the shrimp because it looked real and tasted good. My favorite dish is the crispy beef. The taste and texture reminded me of beef, but it didn't have much substance. It was like eating something with a lot of air pockets.

3617410,2016-10-18,6,AtD6B83S4Mbmq0t7iDnUVA,"i'm kind of on the fence about this place.  While the food was generally tasty, I'm wondering exactly how much healthier it is here vs eating at any other ""regular"" chinese joint that serves meat.  I mean the food was for the most part tasty, but the sauces it was covered in were painfully sweet, sorry but there is just no way you could call this ""healthy"" eating which is one of the reasons to go vegetarian, right?  I'm not lying when I say I felt my health was worse after eating here.

Case in point...we ordered 3 dishes, Lettuce wraps, Orange ""chicken"", and General tzo's ""chicken"".  So for the ""chicken"" dishes, I'm not really sure what the faux chicken was made up of, maybe tofu? but whatever it was, it was covered in a thick batter (thicker than a normal chinese restaurant) and deep fried, then buried in a sauce that was basically liquid candy.  I cut a couple pieces in half and it was more than 50% batter, that can't be healthy.  The lettuce wraps were probably the healthiest of the 3 dishes and also the tastiest. The wraps, along with the side of rice, a mix of brown / wild rice, were the high points of the meal.

One other good thing that stood out was the service.  The servers were on it, refilling waters quickly and checking on us multiple times to make sure everything was O.K.. The restaurant itself was also very clean and inviting.  There is ample parking in the shopping complex and there's also a big asian market downstairs.

3618245,2014-12-18,11,AtD6B83S4Mbmq0t7iDnUVA,"Gotta love Groupon! I doubt I would have bothered going here without seeing it on the deal site. There are so many Asian Veg places where we're from that when in Vegas, it's probably the last cuisine that I'm looking to eat.

While we have a ""house of veggies"" (two, I believe) in The Bay Area, it's nothing like what they have here in Vegas. Bay Area Vegetarian House = Mostly Vietnamese style food, served with a side of Supreme Master aura. LV Veggie House = Mostly Chinese inspired dishes, served with a Buddhist aura in a tranquil environment, just a short drive from the bustling activity of The Strip.

They really thought out every nook and cranny of the details to their interior decorations. It's nothing fancy, some of it kinda cheesy, yet it all flows together so naturally. I got a kick out of listening to the water fall from the top of the corrugated plastic roof of one of the gazebos.

The waitresses were great. One gal even rearranged our table in a fit of feng shui (or OCD). It's good that they're easy to talk to since the menu descriptions were quite vague or nonexistent at all.

I'm a fan of the Genreral Tso, so that is one of the first things we ordered. Theirs was done as well as any that I've had. Same with the Orange Chicknon. Crispy with a nice tangy sauce. The General coulda been spicier but that's what the house made chili sauce is for.

The dish that truly stood out for me was the Pan Fried Noodle. My coworkers often order this when we go out to eat at non-veg restaurants. After one bite, I can see why. The noodles were crunchy, while the flavorful, thick sauce moistened things up and added an extra layer of flavor.

They have a Curry Roti that was delicious as well. It reminds me of the light, flaky roti that I used to love before I returned to being Vegan. Get two orders of this or you'll be fighting over who gets the last bite.

Even though we were stuffed, my babygirl was drooling over the dessert menu. We went with the fried 'naner and ice cream. So good! They had several ice cream flavors but they were out of most of them so we went with classic vanilla.

You can tell that Chef Kenny puts a lot of love into his food. He'll come out to greet the dinner guests and chat for a bit before disappearing into the kitchen. He just wants to be sure everyone is enjoying the food.

I could spend my entire Vegas vacation in Chinatown. Partly because of Veggie House. They make being Vegan in Vegas a breeze. They do have egg in some items, but if you tell the waitresses that you're Vegan, you'll have no worries.

I usually get the honey walnut shrimp but is usually one of the those things you just gotta eat there or shortly after because after that the flavor and even moreso the texture of the faux shrimp becomes more prevalent. Asian style decor and ambiance is cozy with faux fountain and birds to go with your faux meat to boot! 

Service is typically on point and welcoming. Probably my only gripe is the prices of the joint as I was spoiled with the numerous, tasty but cheap ones back home in the Bay Area. Veggie House knows that they're probably the best at their job in doing the Chinese faux meat thing here in Vegas so I reckon they feel they can command the prices they do.

Naturally, our group of 4 decided to try a little bit of everything: fried eggplant & a Happy roll as appetizers, followed by 2 types of ""shrimp,"" ""scallops,"" and a ""beef"" dish as our main course(s).

Unless you try it, you will not believe how good there food is. I loved the Kung Pao.  It is presently located Upstairs in the southeast corner in the Pacific Asian Plaza Suite 203, at 5115 Spring Mt. Road.  I found the place clean with a nice atmosphere of Asian decor.  Peggy was our server and was one of the best servers I've had in any restaurant.  Peggy explained what ingredients were in all of the dishes we inquired about and was very professional and patient while we decided what we wanted.  Hot tea and was served and we ordered Hot/Sour soup, Kung Pao Chicken and Crispy Eggplant.  I think it was bean curd they used instead of meat, ( I could not tell the difference from real meat) and a choice of Rice or other options were available.  It was one of the most delicious dishes I have ever eaten.  Both dishes seemed to have a braised flavor and could not have been better.  We ate ""ice creme"" (No dairy products used) with fried banana and it was excellent.  The restaurant uses no meat in any dishes, or onion or garlic and I was blown away with how good the food was.  I can't wait to return and try the crispy ""beef"" and several dishes I viewed other customers eating.    The prices were more than reasonable with lunch specials and appetizers available.

The orange chicken came with slices of mandarins which was complemented the faux meat but apart from chicken and rice, I didn't really have a balanced meal of proteins, carbs, and vegetables. (Some might not care, but when I go out to eat, I like to have as much of a balanced meal as possible.) I'm sure I could've ordered a vegetable dish, but that's just me being nit-picky. Anyway, the food was amazing. My boyfriend is a picky eater and even he scraped up the last of his dish. The orange chicken has a complexity that finishes delightfully and not like that vinegar-y overpowering stuff they have at other chain restaurants.

Atmosphere: Is kitschy charming. There's a faux gazebo and garden awnings on top of booths. There's also a bird's nest that chirps every once in a while. That was funny to try and figure out. 

Service: Two women checked on us at the appropriate times. I asked for chili sauce to go with my meal and they obliged no problem.

I made the mistake of ordering their ramen because I was in a random mood for it.. the noodles were shot out, there was waaaaaaay to much broth, it had these tasteless soggy fried ""things"" in it, and .... corn.. will never order again.

The second time we went, he ordered the orange crispy beef and I ordered the crispy scallops again. I was just as happy as the first time but ended up eating all of my boyfriend's food again. That crispy beef reminds me of jerky, but less chewy. Crispy, thin, and DELICIOUS.

It still astounds me how they can offer so many vegetarian options, all that actually sound appealing. I went to the market underneath them (as they are upstairs) and they actually do sell vegetarian meat substitutes in there. I can't make it as good as the people at the Veggie House, so I will definitely continue to come back. 

Also, the servers are always so sweet!!",giZgTnDxds-FQLi7nBxsBA,3,1,5,FCGOLASPScyGPoakf-OnWw

I'm vegetarian and don't miss meat but was curious to try things like crispy ginger beaf, lotus cakes, lemon chicken. Tasted great! My meat eater friends said that they came close to the real thing!

The staff are really, really sweet. Very happy and engaging! The owner check in to make sure you are happy.

The location is a little tough to find (2nd floor, corner, in a strip mall), but upon arriving your are greeted by an amusing sign forbidding you to bring any meat into the restaurant (no BYO meat!  lol).   The menu has a lot of options (which are played on 2 TV screens as you wait  *drool*).   Having read the Yelp reviews we decided to go with a bunch of items including some of the favorites:  Roti, Lettuce Wraps, and Crispy Spicy Eggplant.  The Eggplant dish was tasty but you definitely want a larger group to take down this platter.. nice and crispy, but obviously very fried.. good flavor.. and probably at least an entire eggplant.   The Roti and Lettuce Wraps were two of the favorite dishes.  The entrees came with tasty brown rice.  We opted to avoid the ""fake meat"" style dishes and went more with the vegetables/tofu/fried rice/noodles-type dishes.  Dessert was decent - vegan ice cream was tasty, but a tad icy and the fried root was only good as an ornament in my opinion.  vegan cheesecake was pretty yummy.  

When we arrived there were ~5 other tables... not bad for Weds at 7:00, but not busy.  However once our food came out (remarkably quickly!) the business started to pick up!  When we left most of the restaurant was impressively filled.

Since there are only a few vegetarian restaurants in Vegas, a good Asian one is a definite welcome addition. It gives you have options for dining out, especially if there is a vegetarian or Buddhist in your party

I was only able to try a few dishes since I was dining solo. I ordered the roti appetizer, pot stickers, and stir fired tofu with vegetable. In addition to traditional vegetarian dishes (stir fried vegies, tofu,etc.) There is a very large selection of faux meat dishes. 

The roti appetizer was terrific, some of the best roti I have had in Vegas. Very flaky and not too greasy. The pot stickers were also very good, having minced tofu and leek, I think. You couldn't tell it was vegetarian since it tasted great. The last dish I ordered was a stir fried tofu dish with vegetables which was fine, nothing special. Brown rice is an option, but they do charge extra for it as well as charging for extra orders of white rice.

Service was friendly and attentive, nothing fantastic, but definitely nothing negative. And the food was prepared and served quickly. Definitely worth a return visit.

The service was amazing for casual dining. The ladies all helped us, were constantly smiling, and always checked up on us. They refilled drinks promptly, they took requests for sharing plates and napkins quickly. It truly was a great first experience.

I've heard great things about ""fake meat"". I've heard that their are delicious fried chicken sandwiches at Veggie places that rival the real thing.

I willingly tried out veggie house for lunch with two friends.

They have a large menu of vegan and vegetarian dishes. Many of them feature tofu, veggies, and ""fake meat"". Sorry I can't figure out a better sounding phrase.

Anyways their lunch special comes with soup, brown or white rice, and an entree. I don't remember the price but the lunch portions of the items were big! I want to say it was $7-$8 for their lunch special.

Between the here of us we had beef and broccoli, Kung pao beef, and their famous crispy beef.

All of the entrees were served with their traditional veggies. Like the Kung pao had water chestnuts, onions, ect,

The veggies on my beef and broccoli were a large portion. All of their ingredients are fresh. 

And let me get to the meat. Upon first bite it truly is a great substitute to meat. It really does taste relatively close to the real thing. They have the texture right. All of the dishes had the same traditional flavors you'd expect. The crispy beef was the least like beef IMO since it is fried it tasted more like fried batter. It was still tasty. Their brown rice was cooked perfectly. The soup had a very mild flavor. It was like a veggie broth.

Last we had a vegan pumpkin cheesecake. It was a good ending to the meal. It was light, sweet, and pumpkiny. I still prefer regular cheesecake.

Am I a convert? No. It did make me rethink all the salt and meat I eat. Will I come back here and was the food good? Yes! 

This is a five star restaurant. Good service, good food quality, unique, good prices, clean.",pZ6P_1V-bTSoYG1fg1TXzw,4,0,5,xiSTGFYvRt01NnaYU99TOw

I personally loved the Orange Chicken - it was AMAZING. I couldn't even tell it wasn't real chicken. I would eat that every week if I lived close enough to this restaurant. The Spicy Eggplant was also a real treat. Perfectly cooked.

We got the Hot and Sour soup which was great. It was a little spicier than I expected, but still very rich in flavor. I normally don't like soups at Asian cuisine restaurants, so this was a nice surprise.

We got the BBQ Beef appetizer, but almost our entire table - vegans, vegetarians, and carnivores alike - did not like it. It was ""okay"" as long as it was hot, but once it cooled down at all it just wasn't delicious at all.

I will say the veggie shrimp was really not my cup of tea, but the rest of the table seemed to like it. It tasted like plain (but perfectly cooked) tofu.

Even for the veggie meats that we all didn't like - the presentation was so, so amazing. It all looked exactly like the ""real"" meat it was mimicing.

The service was beyond excellent. Attentive and chipper even when we had a big party and the rest of the restaurant was packed.

Even though I personally (a carnivore) did not like how certain things tasted, I have to admit I would definitely come back here anytime and explore more items on the menu. Probably leaning towards the veggie chicken items.",yNU0eZAGf0SbKOlcGSzEzQ,2,0,5,ApkACJqEo3oeTKFq1-rvMA

You do not need meat to survive you do however need protein.

Veggie House is on the second floor of what I think is the #3 popping plaza of China Town. Park near the supermarket, it's almost directly over it. Parking in this lot isn't too bad compared to the other two popping plazas. 
They have a top ordered picture menu (not Chef Kenny's specialties on the main menu) and those have been the best things I've had. 
1. Orange chicken (on top ordered menu): Has a spicy chili mark, but it isn't spicy at all. The ""chicken"" is soft and outside crunchy. The ratio of crunch to ""meat"" was perfect. Bye bye Panda Express, this was on another level. 
2. Kung Pao chicken (also on top ordered): Perfect ratio/consistency of ""chicken"" cashew red/green pepper. Not spicy, but watch the chilis inside!
3. Honey walnut shrimp: The ""shrimp"" was a little too gooey for me and turned me off from the dish. I guess it's not on the most ordered for a reason. 
4. Spicy beef: Weird texture

A meal without meat can hardly be called a meal. On top of that the word is vegetable, not veggie, there are few things I hate more than the term veggie. That all being said, this place is great. I went in with much trepidation (I was having lunch with a friend and this was his pick). I figured I would order vegetable fried rice or something inoffensive like that, you see I also don't like substitutes, I don't like fake sugar, I don't like carib, I don't like soy for meat. My friend talked me into the crispy ""beef"". I reluctantly agreed. I was pleasantly surprised, it was so good I forgot I was eating tofu.

4371788,2012-09-10,0,AtD6B83S4Mbmq0t7iDnUVA,"I can't believe it's not meat!

I've had some vegan meats before but if not executed correctly it can be bland and the texture can be a little unappetizing. I'm glad I've found a place where I can indulge myself with Chinese food and feel healthy at the same time. My brother and I tried this place out since Shuseki was still closed (around 4:30pm) and we were famished. Knowing he's a bit of a health buff I told him I knew that there was a Vegan/Vegetarian place in the same plaza. *I know that Hue Thai also serve imitation meat but I forgot about that until now.

My brother ordered their barbequed pork appetizer and I got the salt and pepper fried fish. We ordered these to really test this place out. When our food arrived I was almost confused since the dishes really looked like the ""original."" His bbq pork didn't have any hint of ""I'm not really meat"" texture. If I didn't know it was vegan meat I would assume it's the real deal. 

My fried fish entree surpassed my expectations. At first it really looked like fried fish, with it's crispy and salty outside. The inside has the texture of tofu which could be troubling for some but I was blown away by the flavor instead. It seriously tasted like fish (not the texture, but still). The chef knew how to work with the ingredients. He knew how to manipulate certain aspects of a dish to really make the vegan meat taste like ""real"" meat. They also offer brown rice. 

The service was nice. One of the waitress has a strong accent so it might be difficult to converse with her but she's patient and wouldn't mind repeating herself. She even gave us suggestions. 

The one thing that bothered my brother was that when we paid, the hostess lady took the liberty to keep all the change. We had $6 and something cents worth of change and we planned on tipping $3 (that's 15%, I'm sure) and he can't believe that they'd assume the rest was theirs to keep. I know it's an honest mistake but just a heads up to businesses, make sure to bring the change and wait for the tip after. We promise we won't jip you.",YUzqKt7hmG5BkRykHeZ0gg,4,2,4,GOYFv8onA8rBmjh5oUNeZQ

I love that there are a few vegetarian joints located in Chinatown.  I was excited to try this place out since I had scored an awesome deal on Groupon. 

My hubby is a meat-head (LOL), as am I, but I like having vegetarian options and like to taste how people get creative with vegetables.  

Its a nice cozy little place that has delightful, attentive workers, and when we were there, we saw Chef Kenny making his rounds at the tables.  I like when the restaurants do that, gives you a lot of appreciation of whats about to go down in your tummy.  I heard Chef Kenny say to the couple he was speaking to about how he employs chefs that are also vegetarian.  Guess to be okay of the veggies plates you're preparing, you should be a vegetarian yourself, Hehe.  

There are TV sets on each side of the room that display the varieties that they serve here.  So you won't be completely lost about all the faux on faux on faux they got here.  

My hubby and I tried the Shark Fin soup, Oyster Mushroom with Lime Grass, and the Spicy Beef.  Soup was okay, a bit salty for me, the other 2 dishes were bursting with flavor.  BUT they were both fried and the flavor from one of the dishes was drenched in sauce.  Veggies=good, Fried, not so much.  That was my bad.  I was so intrigued about all these dishes I forgot to order up some clean eats.  Ooops.  

Great, clean restaurant to be recommended to vegetarians.  I'll be back to try some non-fried dishes.",i3bLA4sEdFk8j3Pq6tx8wQ,0,0,3,U3sS6H7YQKGjGPeTTpO4ig

Since going back to vegetarianism a few months ago, Veggie House has been there for me and I'm always excited to treat myself here! You are seated very quickly, orders are accurate, servers are polite, food is delicious, and I've never once left feeling dissatisfied. What does that tell ya?!

So far, I've ordered all of the stereotypical 'Chinese' dishes and have yet to be disappointed. I can't wait to come back, branch out, and order something I won't see at a Panda Express. Lol. My favorites have been the house fried rice (Asian food necessity), pan fried fish (crispy and flavorful) and the orange chicken (of course, of course). If you order beef or shrimp, you'll find that the texture is closer to tofu but it's delicious nonetheless. Oh! Unless it's the crispy beef... That stuff is so spot on that I'm afraid it's real!

Chef Kenny, the mastermind behind it all, has crafted a rather extensive menu of ""meat"" dishes. While the names will read like normal dishes such as orange chicken, the menu is 100% vegan. 

Going one step further, our server explained that the menu was Chinese vegan, meaning they cook with no garlic or onion. My puzzled look must have been obvious because she explained it to me in greater detail. They don't use garlic or onion in order to promote peacefulness of the mind. My google search later on providing me with some very interesting reads on that topic. But back to the review...

The food is phenomenal. I'm not sure if this is true of all the dishes but there are definitely some which I have tried which would have meat eaters fooled. 

Pan fried noodles, sizzling dish with tofu and vegetables, and braised tofu. Our favorite was a toss up between the pan fried noodles and the sizzling dish. This is in no way saying the braised tofu was bad. 

The pan fried noodles were bursting with flavor. We loved how the noodles were crispy in some parts.  The aroma from the sizzling dish of tofu and vegetables filled the restaurant when they brought it out. We especially liked the texture of the tofu, crisp on the outside. The vegetables were perfectly cooked, still crispy, not over done. 

Service was fantastic. Everyone was super friendly and attentive. Chef Kenny even made an appearance to ask how everything was.

This place is different. It's amazing. Come here.

Everything I have tried here has been excellent. Here are my favorites:

Crispy Eggplant 5/5
I checked in with yelp and decided we needed to try this even though we were here for dessert. Very happy I did. Crispy fried goodness with a delicious sauce, this dish highly recommended for good reason. Get it.

Crispy Oyster Mushrooms 5/5
It's hard to describe how good this dish is, it's just ridiculous. Deep fried crispy mushrooms drenched in a thick, rich lemongrass sauce and tossed with sautéed veggies. Be warned, this is a dish you will remember for a long time and probably have serious cravings for. If you try this while visiting Vegas, you may find yourself needing to come back here just to get more.

Vanilla vegan Ice Cream 5/5
Creamy. Vanilla. Perfect level of sweetness. Yummy.

Cherry Chocolate Chip Ice Cream  & Sticky Rice 5/5
WOW. One of the best desserts I have had in a long time, vegan or otherwise. They make this with real black cherries and chunks of dark chocolate. The sticky rice is a must, it's served hot and the ice cream starts melting over it. This one was so good we had to order a second round before we left.

Service here was super friendly and the decor is nice, everything looks very clean.

Guys this food is so freaking worth it. Nothing on the menu has yet to disappoint the tastebuds. My favorites have to be their Thai ice tea, the happy rolls when they're fresh, and their chicken potato curry dish. I could go without the imitation meat in that one, but the sauce is to die for. Unless you up for it, I wouldn't bother with the desserts, they're really small and not really worth their prices.",DR0RxWdLpSGVT3HOj73OZQ,0,0,4,hspzoZQ5BcBLD6Wby8iLBw

My family and I dine - rather, FEAST - here every time we visit Las Vegas. The food is incredibly savory and delicious! 

We will typically order several appetizers and share multiple plates of food. It's impossible to pick our favorite entree, so we eat family style. Everything we've tried is amazing! You seriously can't go wrong. 

I would say the dishes we always get are Orange Chicken and Kung Pao, then we explore the menu, usually always getting something with ""beef."" I'm not a big salad eater at restaurants, but Kenny's Spinach Salad is a surprisingly delicious start to your meal and we always make sure to order that first (FYI: It does have cilantro for those who don't enjoy it). I eat at a lot of vegan places, and Veggie House has MASTERED the plant-meats!! The ""meats"" are quite realistic in some cases, which can be a negative or positive for some people. But for us it's a special treat, and knowing that it's all plant-based fills our hearts with joy. 

There is so much love in this restaurant as well, and it's meaningful that every time we come for dinner Kenny, the owner, is always making his rounds and saying hello. I just wish there was one where I live!

I say with confidence that both omnivores and plant-eaters will thoroughly enjoy a meal here. 
Seriously, if you're in the area - try this place.

I brought a friend (meat lover) and she said that if she could eat this everyday, then she could easily become a vegetarian. A lot of the food is nothing like you would ever experience before and you won't find it at any local grocery store. A lot of the food inspirations were better than the food that inspired them.

I have tried everything from the mixture seafood to their stir fried beef. It is hard to pick one that a loved more, but the most recent one I loved was their pineapple duck. The texture of the food is amazingly close to the real thing, or so my meat eater friends have told me, and the sauce was perfect. It came with it covered in sauce and surrounded with pineapples. The look of it would remind you the look of real duck at the regular restaurant. All this and no cruelty for a low price!

Their fish to me is better than the animal version. Texture is amazingly close, but better in its own way. The taste is dead on, but no nasty mercury after taste. My uncle told me it does not taste like any specific fish, but it does taste like fish. My uncle, by the way, loves fish to death and he enjoyed the fish there too. Their sushi as an appetizer is really good also, or it could be a meal.

Their desserts are very interesting and they even have vegan options. I have had the bean cake topped with green tea ice cream. Presentation is as cool as the ice cream and the taste was top notch. Definitely try that if you ever go.

Overall, I love the place, its easily one of my favorite vegetarian/vegan spots. The service is incredible and everyone is super nice. The decor is really cool and they have done a lot with the place. It is really relaxing and the next time your there, look for the animatronic birds in the corner over the pond, they chirp.",Nh57oGl8AVqLEdHOhQJLLA,0,1,5,5prdkQUZeDn_51z0vWhucw

It is loaded with veggies and very good faux chicken.  It is a yellow curry, more like an indian yellow curry than a thai curry.  if you are sensitive to spicy foods it might be a bit much, but for me it was just the right amount of heat.  The Brown rice here is the best brown rice ive ever had...idk what other rices they use but its got a few dif grains in it that all come together so perfectly.  Tofu soup that comes with the lunch special is simple but flavorful.  For $8 it is a great value...I brought half my plate home!

*general tzos chicken: 5 stars (tastes EXACTLY like ""regular"" general tzos
*roti with curry: 5 stars
*crispy spicy eggplant: 3 stars (this is a highly praised dish, but I personally didn't like it as much as some people seem to. I think It is pretty good as a side, just not extraordinary as a main dish)
*spicy crispy beef: 3 stars. (Another highly praised dish, but again not one of my faves. Not very convincing ""beef""...to thin and crispy...reminded me almost like fried pork skins...but not as hard/crispy as pork skin so just kind of a confusing texture for me.  It was flavorful, and would be amazing on a bahn mi!
*orange chicken: 2 stars. (Tasted more like sweet and sour than orange. Very vinegary sauce)
*sweet and sour pork: 3 stars. (Loved the ""pork"" texture)
*fried dumplings: 3 stars (would have been 5 stars, but the ones i got were overdone.  Very tasty inside tho)
*shrimp and broccoli: 4 stars (One of the ""plainer"" dishes.  No overly rich sauces, but it still has good flavor to it. it tastes very similar to shrimp with broccoli from a regular Chinese place.

A lot of the dishes here would fool meat eaters.   It is a great place for vegans and omnis to eat together. Can't wait for the ched to open his fast food restaurant to open in sept!!! (Featuring burgers and fish tacos and milkshakes and more!)",HQF6pQ9mC52J3BEEDSevOw,0,0,5,WKi5wCG9GjakmarTk1US9w

We came here to try something different and were pleasantly surprised at how tasty it actually turned out to be. The atmosphere is very clean, green and zen like. 

Service was great! The older Asian ladies were all very nice and even wrapped up our leftovers for us! 

Hot and Sour soup (bowl)- was nice and spicy but was a bit bland.. Nothing a little low sodium soy sauce won't fix.
""Beef"" & Chinese broccoli- They didn't have it on the menu but were willing to make it for us.. Tastes pretty much just like the real thing!!!
Sizzling ""Chicken"" and Veggies- This was my fav dish of the day. Bell peppers, onions, mushrooms made the dish especially yummy!
Brown Rice: At no extra charge and is included with entrees!!!

The fake meat looked just like real meat and tastes pretty darn similar. I think the texture is what gives it away. The texture is very similar to that of Inari (tofu wrap used at sushi places..)

Not because I like soy meat substitutions, but because EVERYONE seems to be fooled by this place (in a good way). I have taken the most stubborn ""omnivores"" that refuse to give veganism a chance here, and they all have loved the food. 

My uncles are stubborn eaters that refuse to have a meal without meat or dairy. I brought them here. During the meal, they kept raving about the beef. To this day, they think that it was real beef in their dish. They think the name simply implies that there are a lot of veggies in the dishes haha! I let them think that so that we can still keep eating here.

I brought another friend that asked me to introduce her to good vegan spots around town. We ordered the walnut shrimp, and she was freaking out. She was so confused because I told her this place was fully vegan, yet she just ate shrimp that tasted exactly like shrimp! 

These are just a few examples of the experiences I've had at Veggie House. I love bringing new people here and watching their reactions. The food here does a great job at mimicking the traditional non-vegan dishes. I believe that's why this place is always busy. 

The cherry on top is the owner, Chef Kenny! If he's around, he will usually come out and chat with each table a bit. He is extremely amicable and always willing to answer any questions a guest might have. I will not name any specific names, but there are other restaurant owners around town that are the complete opposite of Chef Kenny and hide from guests for fear of confrontation. Chef Kenny is a genius and deserves all the success that his many restaurants will bring him!

I would highly recommend Veggie House to anyone and everyone...vegan, vegetarian, omnivore...EVERYONE needs to experience this place! My favorite dishes are the crispy spicy eggplant, walnut shrimp, and flat noodles. Yum!!!",i4SBiZHVK3vTYqie4M8P6Q,5,3,5,AuimsXDPlst59tkhhYcbTw

Of course I arrived at nearly 4pm this afternoon starving. I wasn't aware of the lunch closure so plan accordingly.

After a short debate I decided to order the Cajun Shrimp. Surprisingly delicious and the texture was identical in my opinion. The spice level was perfect. 

Chef Kenny's special hot sauce was spicy but tolerable. I tore it up!

- Chow Mein with Vegetables (good but very oily)
- Fried Non-Vegan Cherry Chocolate Chip Ice Cream (Would recommend but ask for flavor availability)

I came here with my family of four while the establishment was somewhat busy for lunch. The biggest issue was that there were only 2 waitresses who were both taking orders and serving food, which made the service very slow. The waitress took about 10 minutes to come around to our table and forgot to ask for what drinks we wanted until I mentioned it. In addition, it took a while to get either waitress' attention when we need ed napkins or extra utensils. Lastly, we had ordered the the Fried Ice Cream with Mango Ice Cream, however, our waitress failed to mention that they only had one flavor of ice cream. When we told her about the mistake, she just curtly explained that they only had one flavor in stock. It was just a frustrating experience.

Veggie House has a huge menu just like any Chinese Menu. As an appetizer I love the Spring Rolls. I really want to try the Happy Roll. It's their version of a ""sushi roll"". When you order your entree you get the option of brown or white rice which is awesome. To me it's all about the Spicy Beef. It's mouth watering and comes with broccoli.

Roti w/ curry - this was the least greasy, yet puffy roti I've had. We both sat there wondering how they got away with so little oil while making it crisp and still fluffy inside The yellow curry that came with was pretty decent as well.

Crispy Beef - this was hard to tell this was soy beef aside it from not having any kind of strong beefy flavor. They know how to fry up something crispy here as the sauce never made the crisp outside sog AT ALL and it was not a greasy dish either. I wish every Chinese restaurant knew the Veggie House secret.

5 Vegetable Delight - this was subtle, but solid vegetables. The sauce is a light soy and ginger and it had lotus root, mustard, mushrooms (black fungus and shiitake), snap peas, carrots and cashews. 

We ate everything up but didn't feel overly stuffed or get that ""itis"" you get when you just eat some filling, fatty, salty stuff. Definitely not feel guilty food at all. 

I'm glad there is a place like this around. My own caveat is for a place that is ""Veggie House"" there wasn't many JUST vegetable dishes there, but I digress. I'm just not keen on fake meats, but that beef was good. 

Service here is pretty good. Checking on us and drinks were refilled and didn't stay empty very long which is much appreciated on a hot summer day.

I am not vegan, but I love vegan food, vegetables, soy, etc. It was just delicious. I liked it better than regular Chinese food, it was that good! I do have to say that when I took the food home and ate it, it was not as good. So don't order what you cannot finish!

Local Specific Info: Check for a Groupon, it helps out a lot!! This place is a little on the expensive side if you want to order a lot! The Spicy Crispy Beef is bomb! and desserts are yummy~!! If you don't finish, you can take home your food!",OoyQYSeYNyRVOmdO3tsxYA,8,3,5,yJUEbYetB2UWcf3wUqJjjg

My friend and I went here to celebrate our birthdays, and we were happy to finally come across a place where everything on the menu is meat-free. How many restaurants have we been to where the only thing we could eat on the menu was the salad? (Hold the chicken please)
The service is friendly, the place is clean, and even the other patrons were pleasant to be around. We ordered the 'duck' with pineapple, and the classic orange 'chicken'. I put quotes cause I don't really know what you'd call the imitation version of that, but it was just that and it was amazing. 
Maybe it had been a long time since either of us ate meat, but when my friend first tried her dish, she stopped and looked at it weird, cause she thought it was real meat. The server assured us everything was vegetarian and then I proceeded to make fun of her the rest of the night for it. I can't pinpoint how close to the ""real"" thing it may be, but nonetheless the food is delicious in it's own right and deserves a try at least once.",4N-HU_T32hLENLntsNKNBg,8,3,5,L3TT6FR81RxLwNq8v_F_WQ

Moreover, the chef himself is highly regarded and conscientious about his recipes. 

The delivery option here is good, but I would recommend you jist bring yourself in. These dishes succeed because of their hard earned texture which gets a bit lost for some items in the ride of over. If you do order take out then choose options like the orange chicken which will be just as good and avoid crispy items that would obviously become soggy.

Upon entering the restaurant, I was sure to inform her that we(my partner and I) wanted to redeem our groupon so any necessary preparations could be made. She interrupted snarkily and asked us if we wanted to dine in or dine out in such a manner that it seemed as though she was annoyed with us already, although we had only been in the restuarant about 5 minutes or so. After opting to dine in, she ""led"", which is a nice way of saying scurried along hurriedly while expecting us to keep pace with her rushing to get us out of her hair, to a table and then proceeded to toss our menus onto the table(not an exaggeration, she literally threw them onto the table), point to our seats and promptly walk off.

Our waitress, on the other hand was wonderful: friendly, professional, and courteous. Unfortunately, our prior encounter with the hostess made us reluctant to stay there, and I informed her that we would like to change our order to take out.

After awkwardly having to deal with the hostess, who by this time was almost giving us the ice cold ""I can't believe you changed your order, make up your mind, I hate customers like you"" stare, we then sat there for the next 15-20 minutes for the food. Soon before we left, the hostess begins to seem amiable, and attempted to make small conversation with my partner and I. At this point we were beyond frustrated and upset, so we were not receptive to her advances. 

What a shame, because when I finally got to the car to try my food, it was absolutely delicious!

The decor of the place was well thought out. They have an area underneath a lighted gazebo for 9-12 people. Water feature which I thought sounded like a waterfall to a pond but I was wrong, it actually came off a makeshift corrugated tin hut roof.

The service here was excellent. Actually had servers who speak clear English, which is a plus! Even the Chef came out and walked around the restaurant to greet customers. 

As for the food. Our first visit we ordered:

WONTON SOUP is great for cold days or if you're sick. Great comfort soup!

GENERAL TSO CHICKEN it was slightly spicy but not too overwhelming. My honey enjoyed this dish!

PAN FRIED NOODLES was the bomb! A MUST ORDER!! If you get this To-Go. Ask for the sauce on the side otherwise you'll come home to soggy noodles and the crunchy noodle helps make this dish what it is. 

FRIED BANANA with Vanilla Ice ""cream"". Typical fried banana dessert. Not too sweet. Good flavor. 

On our 2nd trip we ordered...

CURRY & ROTI (appetizer) ORDER THIS!! You will not regret it. I think it's one of the best curry dish I've ever had. I would order this as an entree if they offer it!!

ORANGE CHICKEN...lightly deep fried but was surprise with the spiciness of the dish. Not my favorite but still a contender for those who like sweet, spicy and crunchy. 

CHOW MEIN was excellent. I had it the next day for leftovers and still tasted awesome. A little oily but very flavorful. 

I recommend getting the noodle dishes here. You won't regret it. I'm not a huge fan of Chinese food but I was this week!!

I ordered the bean curd with bamboo flowers and vegetables and also got to sampled the lemongrass and mushrooms dish. They were both excellent!

On my second visit, I asked for the hot and spicy Szechuan tofu. Personally I don't like non-fried tofu so I made sure to ask if the tofu in this dish is fried. There's definitely a language barrier between me and the server as she nodded her head and said yes to my question. When the dish arrived, it was a mass of white and mushy tofu cubes in a brown sauce. Clearly the tofu was cooked, not fried. After I clarified that I wanted it fried, the dish turned out okay.

5278273,2015-01-26,3,AtD6B83S4Mbmq0t7iDnUVA,"Vegetarian here, reporting for duty! I've been a vegetarian for about 11 years. It's places like Veggie House that get me really hopped up. I am all for fake meat (because I can only eat so much tofu). Veggie House is among a cluster of Asian restaurants in Chinatown on the second floor.    

I walked in and heard what I thought was a bird chipping. Wait, isn't that a health code violation? Just kidding, it's just for sound effects! It was a Saturday night, but we were immediately seated. The waitress took the time to explain that the Veggie House menu is 100% vegan (unless you specifically request that you want eggs or something in your fried rice). 

I went with the Sesame chicken ($10.95) and my husband ordered Curry Chicken ($10.95). Less than 5 minutes later, our food was coming to the table! I think Veggie House broke the record for quickest cooking times. 

CURRY CHICKEN: The curry chicken came out in a Pyrex looking pie platter. Kind of weird. The curry chicken came with potatoes, cauliflower, and LOADS of bell pepper strips. The best parts were the potatoes and cauliflower. The ""chicken"" was too soggy/stringy for me.  

SESAME CHICKEN: I wish it was spicier. The hot chile pepper indicating heat on the menu is a farce! At least for the sesame chicken. Other than that gripe, I really liked my entree. The chicken was super crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. It tasted like it was deep fried and reminded me of a dessert, but in a good way. On a side note, the sesame chicken made for decent leftovers! Oh yeah.

ATMOSPHERE: It seemed kind of dated in here. Could use a little pick me up.

After a Groupon, the total came to $10.97 (deal was $11 for $20). Not bad!

Return visit? Is a tin man's dick made of sheet metal? Yes!

We were very impressed with the food!  It tastes better than what many NC restaurants serve.  I loved the crispiness and the textures of what we ordered.  You knew you were getting fresh veggies!

Also, I some how missed my pocket and left my wallet behind.  I thought, ""I left it on the strip or in a casino!""  I frantically search everywhere I'd been that evening for 24 hours, except the Veggie House.  I threw in the towel and I filled out a police report so I could get on the plane to go back home.  

I get home and couple days later, the owner of the restaurant found me on Facebook providing his contact information.  I called him and he sent my wallet back 100% intact, cash, cards, & IDs.

The thought of vegan friendly Chinese food intrigued me and my Chinese meat eater BF. But I knew we were in good hands since Julie K., who is an absolute sweetheart btw, frequents this place enough to have a favorite waitress. We started off with some yummy Fried Veggie Dumplings (http://su.pr/2v47Ih ) while we sipped on Thai Iced Tea.

They have a very extensive menu (http://www.beyondmenu.com/25320/Las-Vegas/Veggie-House-Las-Vegas-89146.aspx?r=25320 ) I wanted to order something that I knew I couldn't order at a regular Chinese restaurant. I was craving something ""beefy"" with curry. They have ""chicken"" curry on the menu but when I asked the waitress if they have a ""beef"" curry dish, her response was ""We can make you one!"" Whoa, really!?! They will just invent dishes at your request!!! http://su.pr/1Rhxts

When she brought it out, she informed me that this was the first time they made this dish. So we're kinda special being the first ones with a beef curry dish :) The vegan beef was mixed with all kinds of hearty veggies. It was good but I didn't enjoy it as much as our other dishes: Yee Shang Eggplant and the Salt & Pepper Fried Tofu. The eggplant dish was cooked perfectly soft and covered in a spicy sweet sauce (http://su.pr/26qrg4 ). The tofu dish had this light batter and fried perfectly crispy seasoned with just enough salt & pepper. http://su.pr/2UtvSh

At the end of our dinner, I was sad that I didn't have room for the Vegan Fried Ice Cream. Looks like I'm gonna have to venture off strip again for my next Vegas trip. This is one of those places I can definitely see myself revisiting a few more times and eventually updating this review to five stars. So many menu items I want to taste!

Heck, Veggie House is one of my favorite restaurants in general. Chef Kenny's creations are seriously some of the best of both Chinese and Vegan cuisine! I've tried several different dishes here, and they have all been nothing short of amazing. On my first visit, I ordered the Honey Walnut Shrimp. I was a little skeptical at first, especially once my meal came out. ""Looks like shrimp... Tastes like shrimp... But it's not shrimp!"" How he is able to replicate the exact taste and appearance of real shrimp is the beyond me. What I am able to tell you is how much I loved my meal! The shrimp's sauce was so creamy and had a hint of sweetness. His vegetarian twist definitely did this popular Chinese dish justice.

Since we practically live in Chinatown, this is a usual spot for me and Hubby to dine. He always orders the Kung Pao Chicken, which is another excellent choice. I would also recommend the Hong Shao Tofu and General Tso's Chicken- Two of my favorite Chinese dishes. The texture of the chicken (tofu?) is so spot on, it's crazy! You will definitely have to try this place out for yourself to see what I'm talking about.

So it was only natural for Jade W., Christie O., and I to venture off for lunch after doing some community service. I had been eating like a glutton over the past couple weeks and vegetarian sounded good to me. 

Between the three of us, we got the crispy eggplant, fish curry, and mapo tofu. Still to this day, the one dish that stands out in my memory is the first dish. It was fantastic. I would have been happy with just eating this by itself. The ""fish"" in the curry was made of bean curd and seaweed to give it a fishy taste. I was initially put off by it because it felt like I was biting into a sponge. Once I got past the textural issues, it did not taste bad at all. I am curious about their other meat substitutes. Nowadays, imitation chicken and beef has come a long way. 

Veggie House might not be the first place to come to mind when I think Chinatown, but it is not on the no go list. It does not hurt to go for lunch when each plate only costs $6.50.

With an average of 5 stars and a new placement atop my ""Best Match"" list here on Yelp, I was finally tempted to call in a take-out order.   In going through what I could see of the menu in the pics here combined with my fear of vegan ""meat"", I decided upon the highly lauded Crispy, Spicy eggplant lunch special with brown rice and a regular iced tea to drink.  They told me 10 minutes it'd be ready (fast!) and I probably got there 15 minutes after.  It's upstairs?  Minus one star.  Just kidding, but I am lazy so I took the elevator.

It took them a short while to realize I was at the front waiting, but not crazily long and they apologized so no harm done (I also didn't try to flag them down or anything), and I paid for the meal (reasonable at $9 for food and drink combined) and left.  First thing I noticed which was odd was that it was all bagged up, even the iced tea.  I can understand the thinking that it could be more convenient to carry it this way, but when I got to the car I immediately went to remove it because I don't like my hot and cold items so close to each other when I get takeout.  I then noticed that the tea was in a gigantic soup container, and not a normal takeout cup, meaning it was very wide and the lid did not have an opening for a straw.  Given it's width it wouldn't fit in my cupholders so right back into the bag it went.  You win this round Veggie house.  On the plus side it contained a LOT of tea, and I've never been more AMPED to work on Excel spreadsheets on a Friday afternoon in my life.

In getting to work I was a little disappointed when unpacking the bag to find that there was simply the rice and eggplant (and the tea) inside.  The menu states it is served with a daily soup and also lists a ""Bun Roll"" and some sort of sweet potato rice but now I can see how that might be part of an option I could have chosen instead of the brown rice?  Alright look, I still could have used some soup, and they CLEARLY have to go soup containers.  I know several places make those sort of lunch special components dine-in only, but I didn't see any mention of that being the case here so I was still sad about it.   

As for the eggplant and brown rice, they tasted really great as others have mentioned, but I have a big issue with the eggplant being called spicy because there was ZERO HINT OF SPICINESS whatsoever.  On a scale of 1-10 it was literally a 1 if not a zero.  It was much more sweet than spicy which was a disappointment for me as I love spice.  I'm not sure if I should have specified that I wanted it really spicy, or if my understanding of vegan spice is too limited to understand the deal, but I didn't feel like I ultimately got what I wanted.  The flavors were still nice, and I would definitely give Veggie House another try in the future.   Maybe by then they'll have to-go cups?",v3YOx9T4jRSw8XP9Rd9H4g,2,1,3,yoq2Ur3rk8C_wr07YMx-_A

- The Thai Tea was pretty good and unique with the soymilk added to it. Guess it's good for those who are lactose intolerant x) 
- Honey Walnut Shrimp - I was pretty impressed that the shrimp actually tasted and had the texture like shrimp! I liked this dish a lot! 
- Crispy Beef - probably my least favorite dish. It was just fried goodness but not much substance. The broccoli it came with was also a bit cold.
- Braised Tofu with Vegetables - Braised Tofu has been my all time favorite dish ever since I was a kid so I was looking forward to eating this.  The tofu was cooked correctly and everything was very fresh. I think the flavor was a bit underwhelming for me though. Maybe I'm just too used to the amazing flavors of vegetarian food back at the temples in SoCal though. 

The service was very welcoming and friendly! Although, there was an awkward moment where a server came up to our table and excitedly showed us a new fish dish and we thought he was going to give it to us for free. After he tempted us, he left to give it to another table. 
It was too good to be true lol.

5487283,2015-10-20,1,AtD6B83S4Mbmq0t7iDnUVA,"So good!! This is a totally vegetarian restaurant, so there is absolutely no meat in any of the dishes. The menu says ""roast pork"" or ""chicken stir fry"" but it's absolutely 100% meatless even though some of the dishes tastes like real meat.

I think the chef is caught in between wanting to cater to authentic Chinese tastes, & those who are used to less authentic tastes. So four stars bc while a few of the dishes were sooo awesome, a few were overly sweet like it was for a different audience. However, they are a clean restaurant. The oil they use to fry foods is changed frequently and doesn't have that old/stale taste some places have. 

The service was great, very friendly and helpful. Place was clean and quiet when my party of four went (Monday night around 6pm). I'm definitely coming back!! 

This is what we got: 
Cantonese fish: made from tofu with crispy seaweed on top that took on the role of the fish's skin. It looked more like grilled fish than it tasted, but I love tofu so I enjoyed this a lot. 

crispy beef: tofu based too, but this is the one dish that if I didn't know was vegetarian, I would've thought was a delicious beef dish. It was tasty. Perfectly crispy though a little too sweet. 

Chicken hot plate: I loved this one. It was also tofu based and delicious. You can tell it was imitation meat, but this dish wasn't overly sweet. Great smoky flavor to the fake chicken with lots of fresh crisp veggies. I love how Chinese cooking has vegetable dishes where the veggies are both crisp and saucy. My fave :) 

Scallop pan fried crispy noodle: too sweet, but the noodles were crispy and good. The scallops were a form of big mushroom (the literal Chinese to English translation of the mushrooms are chicken leg mushrooms) that was breaded and fried. This was okay, I wouldn't order it again. 

Fried eggplant: sweet eggplant sliced like French fries. Had a sticky and crispy texture which was interesting. Like caramel stickiness to it. I thought it was too sweet again but interesting. In all my 31 years of eating Chinese food I have literally never eaten a dish like this before. Wouldn't order it again but didn't regret it. 

Overall: yum!! I'm coming back for sure :)",mHp4g3_z2dmD9UPXzuE8bQ,6,2,4,83NmcJbzJsFDM9ezcbzGNA

General Tso's (or Tzo or Tsao or Zao or whateverthefuck) chicken was as close as you could get to the real deal and the unanimous favorite dish.  We annihilated it.  We also got the Mongolian beef which was gluten/tofu heaven and the spicy, crispy eggplant was deeeeeelightful.  

I also had the honor of esteemed Yelper, Tony T, stopping by to say hello.  He said he preferred the seafood dishes over the others.  That kind of surprised me for some reason but I will definitely go for some of those next time.  How does one make vegetarian scallop in the first place?

I like to try different things every time I visit, but I always include the Orange Chicken, no matter what. It's so full of flavor & spice (they will alter the spice level to your liking), and it's cooked to a perfect crisp. I like it with brown rice. Orange Chicken is a must!

General Tso Chicken is good, just not as excellent as the Orange Chicken. 

Kung Pao Beef is ok. It didn't do anything for me in the knock-my-flavor-socks-off department. 

Spicy Hon Hon Shrimp is good. It's supposed to be crunchy, but mine wasn't. I think it would better with a crunchy batter. 

It is a 100% vegetarian establishment, but everything I have had was vegan, and other dishes can be made vegan, just ask. Particularly if you're getting fried rice, otherwise, you'll get eggs in your food. So again, be sure to let them know if you're vegan. 

Nice clean restaurant. Super friendly and helpful staff. Accepts credit cards (there is a minimum order amount; I think @ $6). 

Call ahead for carry-out orders. To-go orders come in nice reusable containers. 

Can be tricky to find for first time visitors. It's in Chinatown.  If you're coming from The Strip (Las Vegas Blvd), turn west onto Spring Mountain Rd. Stay on Spring Mountain Rd and once you pass Decatur Blvd, you'll see the Pacific Asian Plaza on your left.

You can find the eatery tucked in the corner on the second floor of the original SF Market shopping plaza.  While going to the bathroom, I noticed that there is parking out back that offers easy access to the restaurant via a ramp from the side of the building.

Practically everything here resembles most Chinese cuisines, except for the fact that there is no meat!  There is even a sign saying that they'll chop you head off if you come in with a slim jim or something of the sort...well maybe not that radical, but something to that affect.  Yet, the vegan faux meats is unparalleled.  I am guessing that most of it is derived from soy/tofu, but one cannot be sure.  Chef Kenny offers pineapple duck, general tso's chicken, and even seafood dishes, all ingredients are made with meatless plant proteins, natural spices, seasonings and even organic. No MSG, preservatives, or food coloring are added as well.

We started with the crab and shark fin soup (delish) and had the spicy beef with brocoli with curry mushroom plate.  Its amazing how closely the faux meat resembles real meat and like to think frying the ingredients has a lot to adding to the texture.  I can't wait to try some of the other dishes that were on rotation digitally on the flat screen TV's in the dining area.  Each time i peeked up, I say something else I wanted to try in the future.

The staff is extremely friendly and accommodating.  There were only two servers and the place is pretty petite, but handled well on the floor.  The place is designed with several cabana themes and a small pond inside.  Nothing flashy and colors were neutral and not surprising.  Maybe a little interior decorating wouldn't hurt.  The place was clean and very well kept to say the least.  Even Chef Kenny was roaming around greeting guests, this says a lot.

I thought that the dishes would be pricier given that it was a vegan joint, but not the case at all.  Everything is reasonably priced and competitive with similar (non vegan) dishes alike.  Although, because the place is small and popular, there could be a slight wait.

But my favorite was my Father in Law who's an avid hunter & a cop who has for years made fun of us for being Vegetarian/Vegan. It took 10 years to get him to come with us anywhere as he suffered from the notion that being vegan means eating only bird seed & tofu & he even later admitted that he & my mother in law went to eat before they came to join us. So they only had small plates in front of them but they kept putting food on those plates !! He loved it !! Next time he came to town he asked "" Hey can we go to that vegan place again ??"" He's also since gone to LA Vegan with us (in LA where he lives) & loved it too !!

We like sitting on the round tables where they have the movable center piece so everyone can share each other's food. Get a taste of everything !!

We LOVE the Roti with Curry (Amazing !!) the General Tao (which they always anticipate me ordering - don't even have to ask) & the Happy Rolls sushi .. but everything is so good !! My wife always gets the spicy eggplant or Sesame Chicken.

-Curry Chicken with Potato: Possibly my favorite dish. The curry sauce creates the perfect gravy for the chicken and potatoes. An ideal comfort food! 
-Geese: Amazing layers of veggies with a crispy outer crust. I don't know how the Chef makes this one, but it's divine. Pair your leftovers with a salad and you'll have a great lunch the next day. 
-General Tzo Chicken: This is my non-vegetarian boyfriend's most favorite dish. He says it reminds him of Orange Chicken and he literally orders it every single time.
-Crispy Spicy Eggplant: A lot of reviewers hailed this as the most delicious dish on the menu, but this is where I'm going to have to disagree. I found it to be too sweet and the sauce to be too thick to properly enjoy.
-Crab Meat Shark Fin Soup: We decided to try something different when we ordered this one with egg drops. It was interesting, but not a hit. I think it would have been better without the egg, so consider that before ordering. 
-Walnut Shrimp: I found the faux-seafood to be too convincing. Ordinarily, that's a compliment to the chef. However, when things taste a little too much like the ""real deal,"" I start to freak out and panic and can't enjoy the meal because I worry I accidentally ate meat. I'm a crazy vegetarian, what can I say.
-Drinks: No fountain drinks, but a decent selection of canned or bottled sodas and juices. 

Worth noting, I have taken both my younger brother (who would live off Carl's Jr. if he could) and boyfriend (who usually threatens to break up with me any time I recommend a vegetarian restaurant for dinner) here and they both loved it just as much as I did. So, rest-assured vegetarians and meat-eaters alike will enjoy this place! You can even bring your pet T-Rex!",ioAxaAZTOIfa-3AkwixF-Q,7,2,5,cR1bhxdBQBM4YxTaT7-INg

Wow, we like it a lot that we went twice during the 3 days we were in LV.  Dishes were so good.  They have a 'BALANCED' taste.  The sweet is not too sweet, the salty taste is not too salty, and the sour taste is not too sour.  I don't know how to describe it but they taste well balanced.

The sign of good food is that you can't stop eating.  That's how it was with my experience.  Every bite was followed by another bite since I wanted more and more.  We finished all of our lunch order dishes. For us the best one was the Crispy Oyster Mushroom with Lemongrass sauce.  Because of this dish, my husband wanted to go back to the restaurant instead of trying other vegan places in LV.  I did try bravely to have the seaweed stems.  Surprisingly, they were good.  The Crispy Eggplants and Crispy Beef dishes were also delicious but we prefer the Crispy Oyster Mushrooms dish.

The price was also so reasonable for lunch specials.  The service was attentive and friendly.  I wish that I can try more dishes before we left but we only have one stomach and only a few chances to dine here.

We will come back to this place again when we have a chance in the future.  I hope that this place will continue and be successful.",6-DIYkaXJuJBYdMAVybIww,5,2,5,X9nHi5JUI54i1uREjAugfA

Unlike any restaurant I have ever been to, the staff knows everything about every ingredient on the menu.  What it is, what its made of if its a processed vegan meat, what allergies it could effect (if you don't eat corn or what, etc).  They know about all the recipes and can tell you all about them.  And they are super passionate about what they do.  They want to share this information with you.  Unlike many waitresses who find it a hassle to be quizzed about how things are made and what goes into them.  These waitresses are happy and eager to share this information with you

Now lets get into what you will eat here.  What you will find here is one of the very few authentic asian cuisine restaurants in the United States.  They make all sorts of hardcore asian dishes.  Like shark fin soup.  Or roast goose.  But guess what?

THEYRE ALL 100% VEGAN!!!

Yes thats right, 100% vegan goose meat!  Made out of vegetables!

Even on the door there is a sign that says ""no animal products may enter this premises""

But don't worry meat eaters!  This place is amazing!  Everything tastes super great!  The chef here is a world famous chef!

I even brought my father there who is a meat and potatos kind of american guy.  You know the type.  hes an old fashioned macho farmer, grew up on a dairy farm.  And even he loved it!  And he wasn't just being polite!  Hes teh kind of guy who will say if he doesn't like something.  And when he was looking at the menu he wasn't sure about any of the dishes, didn't think they were the kinds of things he would like.  So he just let me order and he ended up likeing everything!

And the atmosphere is really nice here, but still casual, not stuffy.

And the owner actually came around to introduce himself and make sure we felt welcome, just like good restaurant owners used to.  He was a very friendly and personable man.  He spoke with us for about 2-3 minutes and I will always remember that.

Disclaimer:  I'm not a vegetarian or a vegan. 

Everything here is fake meat!  I've never had any form of fake meat before this night.  There are soooo many fake weird meats on the menu that I want to go back just to see some of this stuff.  Fake duck?  Fake shrimp?? Fake porkchop??? Fake beef?? Fake fish??  So weird. 

We had vegetable fried wontons...delicious!!! 

Husband had sizzling chicken.  He ate about half of it and then started complaining that he wanted to go to Smashburger on the way home and get something else to eat.  But he ended up taking the leftovers for lunch the next day and letting his friends try the fake chicken.  What a novelty! 

I had what was supposed to be house lo mein.  What came out was a pile of ramen noodles on a plate with fake chicken, fake shrimp, and veggies.  It was hot and the veggies were really good. I've never had lo mein where things are just dumped on top of the noodles...usually it's mixed in?

It cost me and my husband almost $40 to eat here so I probably won't go back but it was fun to try. I felt good after the meal. Ya know how sometimes you eat somewhere and you just hate yourself afterwards?  I didn't get that feeling.",VigsAph76fP7pechJ743EA,3,2,3,_qid6kAM4xeDhSvgt9HFLw

Items are listed as the item they resemble.  Gardein Chikn is listed as chicken.  I wanted something that was heavy on vegetables and asked for a dish they recommended.  The waitress seemed to be in a hurry and said braised tofu with vegetables.  Disappointment awaited me...

The braised tofu with vegetables was made with the softest tofu I've every seen. Absolutely brutal. There were about 3 different kinds of vegetables, mainly bok choy.  Would have expected to get some more variety  Now we get to the sauce, which I asked to be extra spicy.  For a vegan restaurant, I noticed the place was full of overweight people and now I know why.  Everything is covered in sugar sauce and comes with only white rice.  Not much spice was detected in the sugar sauce. 

Maybe I expected too much from this place, based on the glowing reviews.  I think people are just getting mesmerized by the fact it is all vegan.

The inside is VERY nice looking. Decently sized and with the amazing decorations inside, it makes me want to bring in a group of 8 and sit under one of the designated family-style tables.

Service was prompt except it wasn't busy at all so they had a lot of time to go to us in the beginning. By the end, though, they stopped coming over as often. They were nice and helpful and I was also reading the Yelp reviews to see what was recommended.

WHAT WE ORDERED:
2 cold items combo $6.95: seaweed stem & cucumber
-- This wasn't too shabby. I definitely liked the cucumber. Maybe not so much the seaweed but it wasn't too bad. The sauce was nice :0).

Salt Pepper Fried Tofu
-- I love mostly everything salt & pepper so I really wanted to taste it. It was pretty good and my friend liked it. We also dipped it in other sauces but I preferred soy sauce. You can slightly taste the salt & pepper so it wasn't that strong for me.

Veggie beef rolls
-- Last year I had an influx of beef rolls so I definitely think this played into my taste buds. They were good in their own way but a bit too soft for me. And of course, the meat isn't really our typical meat, since it's faux meat, but it wasn't too shabby. If you're a fan of beef rolls, I would recommend you trying. I tried it due to a yelp review but I've since stopped eating beef rolls. Had enough to last me a few years :0b.

I cannot recommend veggie house. I don't think they have a clue as to what gluten free means and I really don't trust that their food is 100% vegan.

The Pad Thai came with shrimp and chicken, and although they were imitation meat, my husband couldn't bring himself to eat it. However, the noodles themselves were tasty and flavorful. They also have good spice levels that they ask (0-10). We picked 7 and that was pretty spicy!

My last visit gave me enough reason to rate it one star and never eat here again. Me and a friend entered through the rear entrance of the establishment and had to wait a while because they were extremely busy. We had a perfect view into the kitchen and were watching one of the chefs prepare a dish in a wok. during the prep we witnessed the chef use the cooking utensil as his own personal tasting spoon several times and continued to use it in the cooking process. I watched in horror after every taste he put the cooking utensil back in the wok and continued cooking with it. After about the 4th taste, he plated it up and took one more taste before sending it out to the table. I watched the entire thing because had to make sure he wasn't just cooking up his own personal lunch. I shared this story with my vegan/vegetarian friends, and none of us will ever eat there again.",ScYRd9eeu7lLdT-ouEHH5g,2,0,1,7AUCmQD0LDUQEaiaObTD_g

We received such a hospitable and personalized welcome here. The chef came to our table and answered all of the questions we had about his cuisine. The food was amazing!! Delectible and creative, we enjoyed the idea that everything we ate were vegetables, even if it looked or tasted like meat. Plenty of texture and chew. The memorables were the Eggplant and a Seafood dish with ""fish"" and ""shrimp."" The sauces were amazing, particularly considering that they did not cook with garlic or onion, as they practice a form of Buddhism that does not integrate these into food.

I ordered faux shrimp sizzling plate & faux Kung Pao Chicken.
I'll admit, I did almost finish the Kung Pao Chicken plate. But only because I barely touched the Sizzling Shrimp Plate, which I might add was not sizzling upon its arrival (that's the fun & exciting part of watching your food come to the table, but this wasn't the case here)

Kung Pao Chicken: did have some good flavors, we requested a 8/10 in the spice level but it was probably less. It was still good but not worth coming back for in my opinion.

Sizzling Shrimp Plate: All of it tasted like it was probably steamed for a few seconds then maybe sautéed after in a very flavorless sauce. It was undercooked and almost raw, lacked flavor, and the faux shrimp had an odd texture.

I am sad to say that I did not enjoy it at all like I thought I would.",Wdm3hCNmJwD689wD6-Bb0w,6,0,2,0yWaRr_IiLjtVNXluASUyw

5942663,2018-06-01,2,AtD6B83S4Mbmq0t7iDnUVA,"This is definitely my favorite Chinese Restaurant. After a good friend suggested this place we had to go and visit The Veggie House. It was my first time here and totally will not be my last. You will be welcomed from kind staff and seated to your table. We had the pleasure to eat such an amazing food!

For starters we had their green tea. We had like 4-5 refills since the tea was so good. We began with the chef spinach salad. I loved the taste of the sesame seed dressing with the fresh spinach and fried chopped spring roll papers. I totally recommend it.
We ordered the spicy veggie orange beef. I enjoyed how they imitate the color and form to create the feeling like you would eat real meat. This dish was made from soy beef, cooked crispy with a spicy orange peel sauce.
With that we also ordered the Spicy Cajun Veggie Fish which is served with brown/white rice. They told us that the tofu is wrapped in seaweed to make it look like fish skin and which also gives it a taste of the sea. Last item we ate was the Szechuan Shrimp, it was amazing. It tasted like real shrimp and the sauce was perfectly spicy and sweet. In total I enjoyed my stay and with every dish we had I felt like I was in heaven. I can't wait to come here again and try more and other of their dishes.
As a Vegan it's hard to find Chinese places where they don't work with meat and other animal products. What I totally loved was their sign at the door before you enter ""Please do not bring any kind of meat or seafood to this restaurant"". 
Inside seating area is clean and very friendly staff. Unfortunately no outdoor seating area. Since they are on the second floor you can park on the second floor either put it's uncovered. They have two entry ways. The main one in the front and also an other one in the back so you don't have to walk all around the building when you park on their level. I am very happy that I visited this place and I would recommend it to everyone who would like to enjoy Vegan Chinese food.",NbhMH4XcHylnROs4oUlfSw,5,3,5,OaOtSrtc4ArOqglj5tIlfw
5959863,2013-05-23,3,AtD6B83S4Mbmq0t7iDnUVA,"I am by no means a vegetarian, but I found this place delightful. I used to be a regular at this location back when it was Noodle Palace and was so disappointed when they closed. Once they reopened their doors as Veggie House I bookmarked it immediately, but it wasn't until the Groupon became available that I got just the right push to get me here. 

My Groupon was just about to expire, so I decided to pick up a meal for my fella and I for carryout. I ordered over the phone and the service was so friendly and informative when I had questions about the menu. I came in after work and my food was ready to go. The ladies who worked here were really nice and I was really impressed with the pleasant service. 

I got our meal home and I actually had to wait a bit before my fella got home. I couldn't resist and snuck a bite from each of the dishes before he arrived. Everything was oh so good. I couldn't believe how much the General Tso's ""Chicken"" tasted and felt just like actual chicken. My fella was especially reluctant, but I made him give it a chance. He was absolutely blown away how good it all was. My favorite was the spicy crispy eggplant and the green beans. The eggplant was spicy and delicious. Even better, they offer brown rice instead of white for no extra fee. 

Despite my carnivorous tendencies, I am quite the veggie addict, so I was thrilled with the food here. I can't wait to make this place a regular on our restaurant rotation for their veggie options. I'll probably skip the faux meat next time.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,11,3,4,f-KFbuAKpdIaup6mxrkkIg

Great service and great fresh food. Truly the best veggie egg-free pad thai I have ever had! It is owned and operated by a very dedicated chef.
Very basic interior design - but the chef hand made a sweet little fountain garden area on one side of the room to add better ambience.

Some of the other reviews may have gone of off nights - that does happen in restaurants - but that was not our personal experience.

We also ordered the braised tofu and veggies, ok....exactly what you would expect. We also had the generals chicken and chow fun noodles both were really good. You wouldn't even know it wasn't actual meat. 36$ for 3 of us (without tip).
