The man making my sandwich was also very friendly.  Probably the nicest subway employee I've ever met.  Over all it was a good experience for subway, parking is kinda crazy though.",fmPko8NeSgKpb5YwhLJ_gg,1,0,4,dBrPqwZu4R3nJtlXmPqdBw
2477533,2017-03-02,0,dP1_wP59hvVDWNzFFS_6YQ,Sandwiches taste like card board. I've eating subway for over 10 years at home and travel. LV Subways don't even follow the national advertising sales. Meat tastes low grade worst.,q61ILaQokrW7xhjOstilHg,1,0,1,_zZoPc_WS8SmeRBjoGrU7Q
2878411,2014-09-02,0,dP1_wP59hvVDWNzFFS_6YQ,"Please don't give this subway your money.  I have been stuck going to it for the last 6 months because there is nothing else around that is decent as far as healthy but it is horrible service and they take advantage of the tourists with high prices and without the usual subway generosity.   The constantly have new employees that don't know what they are doing and I end up payin 8.50 for 6"" sandwhich that I can't even eat be course the employees will not give u extra olives but they dump the sauce on without you saying extra to the point it is uneatable.  This has happened over and over.  Hate having this subway be the closest!!!",4-HYGir-u_5lTDA0pNyv3A,1,0,1,KUB22-Rw169e_qCcBUM7MA
3462700,2017-04-03,0,dP1_wP59hvVDWNzFFS_6YQ,The employees really don't feel like doing their jobs. No customer service. If you got problem don't even call the GM Zuniga. He has more excuses than they sell footlongs. Mostly taxi drivers eat there use bathroom. Not a safe place to eat. Their security is always at McDonald's.  I gave up no more this location.,Wamin4k5s07vLbx_jq4qcQ,0,1,1,DgGv7fKqf-fBseylOBqHbA

3774559,2018-05-05,0,dP1_wP59hvVDWNzFFS_6YQ,"They will literally give you the bare minimum... they don't have napkins... it's not that they ran out.. they just don't provide napkins. I asked if I needed a key to the bathroom and the woman said no, there must be someone inside who locked it. Nope. You do in fact need a key and there is in fact no locking mechanism from the inside. She lied to multiple customers about the use of their public bathrooms until someone just basically demanded a key. Awful. Other reviews are right - they skimp on the ingredients & the fountain drinks are watered down. Otherwise, the sandwiches are fine... but what restaurant doesn't provide napkins though??",_RD91KuqIeEkUQkVNR_j0Q,1,0,2,WOPjVdM2IQKBerUSuZuU0Q
4259517,2010-09-01,3,dP1_wP59hvVDWNzFFS_6YQ,"Busy location on the Strip-  with McDonald's, Panda Express, and small convenience mart (strip mall across from Mandalay Bay casino). If you are in a rush, especially during lunch time, you should call the order in and pick it up. Parking in front and back, for your convenience. Serves breakfast and salads besides sandwiches, sides, & drinks. Also does catering- sandwich platters (serves 5-9) and giant subs (3 ft./ 6 ft.).

(1) Choose type (footlong/ 6"" sandwich/salad/flatbread). (2) Choose type of bread (9 grain wheat/9 grain honey oat/italian/italian herb & cheese/flatbread). (3) Choose your cheese (american/monterey cheddar). (4) Choose your veggies (lettuce/tomatoes/cucumbers/peppers/red onions/pickles/olives/banana peppers/jalapenos. (my favorite part) (5) Choose your sauce (fat free- mustard/honey mustard/sweet onion/red wine vinegar/mustard- full flavor- light mayo/chipotle southwest/ranch/mayo/oil. (6) Make it a meal- choose your drink and side.

When you walk in, you smell the fresh baked bread- my husband loves that smell. I usually get the ham or the turkey footlong and sometimes the ham and turkey combo on wheat, with white cheese, mustard, lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers, jalapenos, banana peppers, olives- I love that there are so many veggie options (that's what edges out portasubs). And healthier options as well- sandwiches and dressing. Plus, this popular sandwich chain is the originator of the ""5 Dollar Footlongs."" Sometimes there is baked lays potato chips. If you get the oil on your sandwich, it makes it soggy and eating a soggy sandwich is pretty messy (the sandwich just sticks to the roof of your mouth- yuck, hate that) and gross- drippy, gets all over your fingers. I like to eat half and save half for another meal (my normal routine). 

This one is close to work and is pretty busy at lunch time, so I recommend calling in your order if you're in the area. Once I ordered about ten sandwiches for a big meeting here and the large order (under $100) was ready for me to pick up, complete with condiments and napkins- really good service. Glad that I called it in, because the line was pretty long- about 8 people. And some of the seats were occupied so I'm sure that it would've been a packed house if the people in line were also eating there.",fiGqQ7pIGKyZ9G0RqWLMpg,1,0,4,WYlbjTee23xDSqPEeh4mhg
5108754,2018-03-01,0,dP1_wP59hvVDWNzFFS_6YQ,It's Subway. My expectations weren't  very high. Service was OK. It was the only place open. Our sandwiches tasted normal.,8C1ZcMv9-zZQpFWUDn8TiQ,0,0,5,3BOQMx5MEeBJYIiyLUl1gg
5345066,2016-05-03,2,dP1_wP59hvVDWNzFFS_6YQ,"They use less food when making sandwiches than other locations. Example: I got a foot long breakfast sandwich and the rep only put two pieces of eggs - other locations I've been too place a total of four on a foot long. 

They also weren't very sanitary. They placed my breakfast meat directly on their counter (when they use a white paper for everything else) when my sub was in the oven. I had to ask for they guy not to use those slices.",-MHIGItpu4wiUQQrJqn2MQ,2,1,1,C5gZIJ6kqsoQNVZ0TeRKqg
5632081,2015-07-13,0,dP1_wP59hvVDWNzFFS_6YQ,"Good service and sandwich, but the cost is ridiculous. I paid $11 for one foot long chicken breast by itself, no chips, drink, cookie included. That's a rip off. I came here from Arizona to visit las Vegas, and in AZ I pay $4 less. Won't be back.",T8ulwYiTN1QKmoHMwrWS3w,0,0,2,TQGo-D_9ADN9bso49katUQ

Have no fear...this subway is open 24/7.  I had a bacon, egg and cheese flatbread.  It wasn't that good, but I ate it.  Coffee was tasty.

The guy working was super friendly so I figured I'd up the stars for that.  I'm sure if you got a regular sub it would be okay.",wzyGNvArcpUjZauRWFrKHA,0,0,3,FomStREcsM179-pfEM8-Mw
