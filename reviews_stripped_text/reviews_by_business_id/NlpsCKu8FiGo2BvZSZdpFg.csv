She told me she had customers inside please wait. So I park the car and go inside and there was two guys eating a sandwich and she had me wait ten minutes and not tell me ?!? So she takes my order and it took her 15 minutes to make my sandwich , just mine nobody else ( there was no one else there except the two guys eating ) she then skimps my sandwich and refuses to put more on , I mean 4 pieces of spinach?????? This lady needs to retire and go back to working at walmart or being a porter . Other Mexican guy that works there is really good though but this lady ruined this subways review .

Lets just say she pissed me off to the point where I downloaded this app, signed up and wrote a review. This isn't the first time this lady SUCKED  at her job. Every time I come here I hope the other guy is there.",erWAz4mU0dHuScIMwjwmHg,1,0,1,KmdOQr0heYQ78KsJ6ogQCA

This location needs better training that's for sure. It literally cost me $13 for crap ass food!!! I hope they read this review and hire new subway people, stop settling for less customer service is key make your customers want to come back and not want to write bad reviews.",7EJmJ-mtm6qMg-XER64wLA,0,0,1,YzT-SAdqdwk7U7uk7MNw5g
4374077,2016-02-18,0,NlpsCKu8FiGo2BvZSZdpFg,"Visited this location last night. The hubby and I were the only customers there. The guy working, Cesar, was so unbelievably rude. He got so annoyed that we decided to get some sandwiches. I asked for an Italian bmt. He informed me that they didn't have any salami. So I asked I if could add turkey to it, even if it was an extra charge, and he flat out told me no. I was annoyed and got a different sandwich. During which, he was so pushy about what I wanted on it. After he rushed through my husband sandwich, he went on break. Even though he could see some more customers walking up. This is just pure laziness and terrible customer service. Will not be back again.",JEdU91t2ucPw-e__2eXnfg,1,0,1,1e2DaKLt9TvQzO_dULiUrw
4753945,2016-04-27,0,NlpsCKu8FiGo2BvZSZdpFg,I had a decent experience at this location. The food was fresh the service was fast and friendly. It is located inside of the Arizona Charlie's casino. This makes it very convenient while gambling here to stop for a snack. There is ample seating located in front of the subway where you can eat.,ObQl16Vuc4sHPGKtzSGNUw,0,0,3,SdlDLJHAj-3xKKxhcvtUSQ
