This little Italian place has very good food, the prices are reasonable for Las Vegas and a lot less than what you would pay for a comparable meal on the strip.  The bruschetta appetizer was light, flavorful, and on a piece bread toasted just right.  My ribeye steak with a reduced balsamic sauce was cooked just right and I would definitely have it again.

So the what are the downsides?  Well it is located off of the strip in the lobby of an apartment building between a Papa John's pizza and a massage parlor.  Sounds worse than it really is.  Its Vegas.  There a A LOT of massage parlors around!  The Caesar salad was a bit bland for my taste, but still pretty good.  The restaurant was also not as busy as I would like.  There were only three parties in the place on a Thursday night during the peak dinner hour.  I have no idea why this place is not busier, but it does make for a nice quiet atmosphere and great service.  Go figure.",KWeMXZv2sL1UtAlbfVZLmg,1,1,4,Uy8V_7L_bffe-Z6gUOpkDA

Having just moved to Las Vegas, and it being my turn to pick a place for the anniversary, I chose La Scala.  What a place!! The other descriptions of the location are right on target, but don't let that deter you a bit.  It was wonderful inside, warm, inviting, and comfortable.  Better yet, our waiter and his assistant (who also happens to bake the bread-fabulous) reflected the finest in European servers.  They had been there for years (as has the chef) and the pride they took in their jobs reminded us of the fine restaurants in Italy, but without the language problems.  We started with the carpaccio (sp?), and while I thought it could have used more oil, it was very good.  We had cocktails with this, and my wife loved her Cosmo.  I had the gnocchi carbonara and my wife had the trout, both of which were on the specials board.  Mine was one of the best I've sampled, and my wife's trout was a large portion, perfectly cooked, moist, tender, with an array of perfectly prepared vegetables in a marvelous sauce.  To top it off, the waiter must have overheard me wishing my wife a happy anniversary toast, and brought a delightful molten chocolate cake, with dollops of vanilla gelato, and fresh strawberries, on the house.

There are thousands of restaurants in Las Vegas.  This is one of the few I will absolutely find a reason to visit again.  This off strip treasure is reasonably priced, well run, and makes your evening a pleasure.  Well worth the trip",Ger_Ldj0G5sUwXc9-AVB3g,0,0,5,uF-4gbGsG1hlJdZzX2bc8Q

I'm starting to wonder if I ate at the same place...

Pretty much the only thing La Scala has going for it are its servers.  They were great.  Everything else?  Not so much.  I'll make this easy:

-It appears the last remodeling was done around 1992.
-The servers carry a giant easel with the specials written on it to your table.  It's awkward for both the server and the diner.
-The Insalata della Casa was overdressed and appeared to have been dressed in the morning since the lettuce was completely wilted.
-The Capellini al Pomodoro e Basilico had no basil, too many tomatoes, the tomatoes weren't fresh, and the dish as a whole had zero flavor.  Stay away from this.
-The Ravioli di Ricotta e Spinaci alla Vodka were ok, but nothing out of this world- especially for $19.
-Terribly overpriced for what you are getting.
-The weird ""Hotel California"" vibe coming from the regulars at the bar.

This is now the second restaurant I've been to that I think is a prime candidate for ""Restaurant Impossible.""  I could just imagine Robert Irvine having a field day with the easel carrying the specials.

This is long - Read it  or just take my word for it and GO TO LA SCALA

We just found this place after living here fifteen years. La Scala is on the Ground floor of the MARK 1 Tower.  OK, I admit we had a GROUPON or we probably would have never found it. This is old fashioned Las Vegas dinner club style eating. 

The decor is beautiful and reserved. Our Waiter, Robert will work hard for you. He absolutely knows the base menu and each special of the day. He will make a suggestion if you ask and tell you why he is suggesting that specific item. The Waiter's assistants will keep your water flowing, your bread and butter hot and fresh, as well as keeping the table free of past course dishes.

I would guess the room hold fifty or so people There were sixteen people at various tables of two and four while we were there. There was the noise of talking but, it was not overpowering. The soft crooning of Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin played through the sound system. It was for us a very good fifties - sixties laid back easy going type of atmosphere. We enjoyed the change from the cacophony that is usual in todays restaurants. 

The Food:  I am a calamari ""Nut"", I will eat it any style anytime. So, the first thing I ordered up was fried calamari. What arrived was a huge bowl of hot, sweet, light goodness. There was enough for me to eat my fill, my Wife to enjoy a plate full, and us both to leave some guiltily in the bowl. The marinara the accompanies this is spicy and warm. It truly brings up the taste of this seafood offering and lays in some of its own twist also. It gets a Bill A+.

Libby was next presented with a fine looking dressed green salad and I a bowl of the Soup Special. Libby says, ""The salad was crisp, cold, and extremely flavorful. I liked it because it had no harshness in it. I thought it felt good as I ate."" So, there you have an opinion that is not from me. The wonderful thick and brown mushroom soup that I chose had an elegant, silky feel and a rich, dark mushroom flavor. What a lunch it would be with maybe a salad. For me, it was so fine I didn't want to give it up. I would have cheerfully had another bowl with some of the crunchy crusted bread they put out for us. That being said I need to add a bit about the table accompaniment of bread and toppings. The bread is a white Italian type with a wonderful crusty - crunchy outer layer and soft beautiful white pillow as the main part. You receive some very wonderful sweet white butter like I remember getting as a kid from the ""Old Lady"" in town who made it herself. Then there is a dish of Oil and Garlic to sop you bread in if you want. This almost brought tear to my eyes. The oil was thick, smooth, and filled with fresh flavor. It was infused with and carried fresh grated garlic. The fresh garlic had a slight bite of it's own that modified this treat to make bread and sopping oil Kingly.

Here comes the Main Course, For Libby it was a huge piece of halibut. You could see that it was grilled to perfection and had an oil caper, a spice addition. There were shaped pieces of zucchini and roasted potato wedges to add even more beauty and zest to her plate.

For me it was a stuffed pork lion that was browned to perfection and stuffed with wonderful flavors. I also had potato wedges and zucchini. The whole dining experience here at La Scala was much better than we expected. It was supreme. 

We could not finish our dinner so, since there was no way I was leaving anything for the trash we asked that it all be wrapped for his to take. We brought home ""Pup"" bags of what is lunch today. Not for dogs, FOR US.",3WHmc6WQ_jk_fIp-dJDKyA,0,0,5,_2i46Tq90ZwzRWcqiUOh7A

A couple of weeks ago, I noticed that Groupon was offering a deal where $15 bought you $30 worth of lunch, so I knew it was time to try it out.

I brought my dad down to the restaurant, and the first thing we noticed was super-small amount of parking available for the restaurant. It looked as though there were only four spaces available, though I'm unsure if the two nearby parking garages and valet are solely available for the apartment building, or are also available for restaurant patrons. That's where the dissapointment ended with our visit.

We walked into the restaurant and were amazed at how nice it looked inside. It had that classic Vegas atmosphere, a little dark and elegantly dressed, though not TOO elegant.

We were seated by the bartender, and waited on by his wife, who were both charming and extremely friendly. 

Our waitor brought us some EXCELLENT bread and butter, as well as a complimentary lentil soup and Caeser Salad (sans Chicken), and everything was WONDERFUL.

We also ordered some Garlic Bread ($3.50) as an appetizer, and were really pleasently surprised. It was definently chock full of garlic, but had a nice blend of cheese and butter as well.

For our main course, my dad ordered the lasagna ($13) and I ordered the Tagliatelle alla Bolognese ($13), which were both AMAZING. I especially enjoyed the Bolognese because it was made with both beef and veal, which actually made it taste similar to Osso Bucco. Both of the plates were so large that we were stuffed sufficiently by the end of the meal, and neither of us needed to eat dessert or dinner that night.

I would DEFINENTLY recommend this place to any Italian-food fans, though it surely is better to go at lunch rather than dinner-time. The prices are doubled, and the menu is actually surprisingly not as appetizing.",UAF1qKkTIcZOVpx0lhU3gA,2,1,5,a1Qp5IUfuUt8pV7VsewYdw

I think they have trended to charging gourmet prices for so-so fare.  Plus, the casino restaurants are always jammed packed.

Having said that, I have been taking my chances away from the casinos and have been very pleased thus far.

I found La Scala via Opentable and went there for this last Christmas.

The place itself is not the fanciest, but the decor is very nice.  It has a very relaxed atmosphere.  The tables are spread out and is not packed to the gills.  The wait staff are helpful and keep the drinks filled.

The food was excellent.  Pasta... al dente.  Portions might be considered a little small, but I think most appetites would be fine.  It is probably the case that it would not taste as good if the portions were ""Buca de Pepo"" size.  If you have picky pasta eaters, I think you are safe here.

Be sure to save room for dessert if there are any dessert lovers in your party.  I myself am not too much into sweets, but I appreciated the pyramid cake that we split.

The wine list was fairly extensive.  While I do not think there was a sommelier on hand, the waiter knew the wines well enough to help me out.  I enjoy wine quite a bit, but am no expert by any means.  I depend on the staff to know their wine, so I do not like it when they are not ready with a recommendation.

As an aside, they actually carry some decent tea if you are a tea drinker.  I cannot remember the brand, but as a guy who appreciates a little Taylors of Harrogate at work, I can say that the English Breakfast Tea was quite acceptable, unlike some of the finer restaurants I have been to that serve Sir Lipton's bitter tea.

So, if you need a place to chill out and have some decent food, this is your place.  It is only a few minutes away from the Strip.  Also, be sure to have directions handy if you are taking a cab, since it seems like not too many cab drivers know about this place.",xgcxhbbnokR-ZBazUrtXnA,0,0,4,ZVgoE5d7KFxPFm1gBqUy9w

First, the good: our server was really nice and attentive. I honestly think he deserves a better restaurant. 

The food itself was kind of hit or miss -- so-so carpaccio, good prosciutto, great lasagna, OK veal, and not-so-great spaghetti with meatballs. However, for the food prices, I expected a lot better.

The wine selection was excellent and prices seemed to be about the same as most restaurants.

The location was kind of funky and appeared to be a somewhat dodgy neighborhood, but that's just based on my observation and not any firsthand knowledge of the area.

I'd give it 4 stars if the location were better and/or the prices were a little more reflective of the good but not great food, but otherwise, it is what it is. Next time we go to Vegas, we'll look for a different Italian restaurant.",vra3ZJlGSc9GpEM4mYtJAA,0,0,3,cz_XlpBiIV1HIup-jLxjhQ

We ordered 1 fish dish, 1 veal dish, and the gnocchi dish. Each one was nothing short of authentic. I've spent many weeks in Italy and this place definitely serve some very traditional tasty food. Service was very attentive, nice ambience, and clean bathrooms.

We started out with a bottle of Chianti before we ordered dinner.  We had all night and was enjoying the company, so our waiter ran down the Specials list and then gave us time to decide.  I ordered the Portobello Mushroom Appetizer ($9) and special ordered a Gnocchi w/Gorgonzola Sauce ($14.95)...not on the current menu, was on the old menu from a few years ago, but it's our favorite and they have no problem whipping it up.  TBH ordered the Escargot ($8.95) and the Gnocchi w/Gorgonzola Sauce ($14.95).

The Portobello Mushroom appetizer was excellent....the Mushroom was juicy and the Sauce that came with it complimented the dish well....it was a Tomato based Sauce that didn't overpower the dish.  It's a nice sized portion that can easily satisfy two people or four people with a light appetite.

The Gnocchi of course was perfect....which is why it's our favorite dish here.  The Gorgonzola Sauce was rich & creamy, but not too heavy.  The texture of the Gnocchi was just right....not too soft, which is a common mistake that many restaurants make.

For Dessert, I shared a Tiramisu ($6) with TBH and I had some Coffee....which is why I'm writing this review early in the AM.  The Tiramisu was very good......light and fluffy, just how we like it.

The service is awesome.  The server remembered us, even though it's been over 7 months since our last visit....made us feel special.  One thing about this place is that they are always willing to please their guests.  Two of our friends had special order dishes that they were more than willing to accommodate.  This was in addition to our Gnocchi order....which the server remembered how we like it and didn't ask for much direction on the order.

Will I return?  There's no doubt about it.",QJI9OSEn6ujRCtrX06vs1w,13,12,5,6OZODdGEMnyEyL_Zct2phQ

Location was a little wierd as it's located by the entrance to an apartment buidling and we didn't know where we could park- only to realize after we already parked that there was parking in the rear of the building...
Once inside though, it looked completely different, we were not expecting white linen table cloths and a slightly more upscale place.  We actually felt a little under dressed. Prices are a little on the higher end than what I was expecting but oh well- I wanted my gnocchi and I was gonna get it no matter the cost.  The mister got his usual- lasagna and we shared a ceasar salad.

The ceasar was not bad- you can taste the anchovies in the dressing, which is a plus, but it was not the best ceasar I've ever had.

The mister liked his lasagna but said the lasagna noodles were too soft, I tried it and thought it was great, you can taste how fresh the ingredients were in the dish.  I mentioned to him maybe the noodles are soft cause they are hand made and not bought from a box? Hmm...

My gnocchi though was a STAR..even though the gorgonzola sauce was no longer on their menu, they still made it for me...the first bite just melted in my mouth...each bite after that was just as good as the first...it had to be one of the better gnocchi dishes I've had in a long time cause some places make it where the gnocchi is still a little doughy or tough.  They made theirs perfectly.

Like I mentioned, prices were a little steep, we spent almost $50 for our 2 entrees and 1 salad but if I crave gnocchi again, I know were to get some of the best!",LltbT_fUMqZ-ZJP-vJ84IQ,2,0,4,DeIvdztlJxpuJOwsI6JRBA

We were seated at around 6:30 on a Saturday, and the place wasn't two crowded, though it was mostly filled. I'm not sure if it's just the environment of the restaurant, but the service was veeerrrryyy slow. We were seated for a good twenty minutes before they handed us our menus. However, until then they showed us a wine list and took our drink orders.

For starters, my roommate's parents ordered calamari and bruschetta for the whole table. Both of these appetizers, though standard, were sooo delicious. The bruschetta was very flavorful, and the calamari was deep fried perfectly. They also had tons of bread and butter on the table. Not sure if it was because I was so hungry, but the bread was toasty and delicious as well.

My roommate and I decided to split the seafood linguini in spicy marinara and the pesto gnocchi. After hearing amazing things about the gnocchi on yelp I was expecting something extraordinary. Though the gnocchi was good, I've definitely had better gnocchi elsewhere. Maybe my expectations were just too high. The seafood linguini was definitely a pleasant surprise. They gave us TONS of seafood (shrimp, mussels, clams, fish) and the pasta was cooked well. However, the marinara sauce definitely wasn't spicy.

To finish the night off, they served us a rum came (i believe) with candles for my roommate's birthday. Keep in mind that I don't usually like sweets, and I was stuffed, but the cake was really good (and fluffy) and came with strawberries (nom).

Anyways, I had a GREAT time at La Scala with good food and good company. Not sure if I'll be back anytime soon, but I was definitely pleased with the experience.",8kgQupO4TS2bpCGSPhTTIg,1,1,4,aZxcrGWNAlpVoa6FGL6n4Q

The short story:
I was in Vegas last week and went here for dinner with a group.  When I told the cabby where we were going, he said ""Are you sure you want to go to that neighborhood?""  I was wondering if we were making a mistake but reminded myself that most hole-in-the-wall restaurants that I love are in neighborhoods that others would describe as being shady.  The restaurant was about 5 minutes from the strip and when I walked in, it seemed a little like one of the restaurants on Good Fellas.  I was half way expecting to see some guy sitting at the table cutting garlic with a razor blade...which if we're being honest, made me a little excited.

The restaurant had a good mix of steak, pasta and fish dishes.  We had calamari and bruschetta for appetizers--everyone loved them.  They also serve warm bread which was excelente.  My Caesar salad had anchovie dressing...so needless to say it was a little fishy.  For dinner, I ordered the grilled salmon and it was perfectly cooked.   

I'm not sure I would go back next time I'm in Vegas....but not for lack of good food or service.  Simply because there are so many places to try in Vegas that I would rarely eat at the same place twice.",JQc05NZ2J0oet8nvlaKPHg,0,0,3,TrDfB4vnohZzXvvNFo5aQg

Also the restaurant only had a few other patrons inside which made it a very comfortable atmosphere. They were flexible with the menu items, probably because it wasn;t packed.

The service was also excellent. They were extremely friendly and knowledgeable of the menu and wines.

I recommend the osso bucco. There was a generous portion of meat around the bone and was very tender. We had it served with gnocchi which was extremely tender as well...not chewy like I've had before. I ordered the risotto which had other seafood besides the lobster. as stated in the menu We had the lobster bisque and beef carpaccio for appetizers topped off with a bottle of Penfolds shiraz.

Sometimes after working a 10-16 hour shift, you just want to sit down and relax while someone else is doing the work for you.

My happy hour partner suggested this place after she had came here during a work gathering saying that they have one of the best happy hours in town. 

I was pleasantly surprised by how affordable everything was and then by the portions that they give out. I believe the special goes from 5pm-7pm on the weekdays. All the appetizers served during these two hours are less than six dollars. We had ordered the duck prosciutto with goat cheese served on a crostini, the crab cakes, shrimp skewers in diavolo sauce, the mixed green salad and the assorted fried foods platter. The first two dishes I named were hands down the best. The thinly sliced pieces of cured duck blended well with the creaminess of the cheese. Topped with the balsamic dressed salad, that comes on the side, gives it a well rounded flavor. The crab cakes were two large, coaster size pieces served with a cocktail sauce on top of a bed of lettuce. The crab were nice big lumps of meat and crispy on the outside.I could have finished one plate by myself.  The shrimp was not spicy but had a good flavor. Make sure you don't say anything is too bland because the owner will put you in your place. He gave us a taste of ghost hot sauce. One dab made our mouths go numb, then burned for quite some time. It gave me hiccups fo 10 minutes. The salad was standard but tasty. The fried food was decent. The zucchini sticks and the calamari were the best. The mushrooms retain too much liquid and the cheese sticks are nothing special.

Make sure to save room for the desserts. The tiramisu and cheesecake are made in house. The first is bold with flavors of rum and espresso, but not overbearing thanks to the marscapone cheese.
The cheesecake was the most soft and light version I have ever tasted. It simple coats the tongue and lulls you into a peaceful place. Both are divine and deserve a try.

This friendly little restaurant is fine dining without being pretentious. It serves a wicked deal for happy hour and provides good conversation. The staff and regulars are easy to talk to and that is rare.",N3oNEwh0qgPqPP3Em6wJXw,0,2,4,H0LogAaYKGlaGT2twBQ1gg

Their wine selection was very wide but mainly consisted of Italian wines (Bring your own if you desire a non-Italian). Anyways, when in Rome... They were out of the Moscato we selected, so they gave us a $10 discount off a similar one. 

This place is very true to their Italian heritage as the dishes consisted of true Italian assortments mixed with Americano favorites. Their Casa salad was good with a homemade tuscan-style dressing. My wife had their Angel Hair pasta which she thought was prepared very well. They managed to make it Al Dente which is hard to do with Angel Hair. 

I had one of their specials of the evening. They have about 30 dishes to choose from plus another 5-6 specials, so they definitely have something for everyone. I had the Bolognese Ravioli that they make from scratch. The sauce was rich with flavor but did not overpower the pillow filled Raviolis.

When the bill came, I was delighted to see that we stayed under our budget. If you are looking for a true Italian experience that is off the strip and reasonably priced, La Scala is the place.

The gnoochi was like little pieces of heaven.  

We were there one week ago, apparently they are closing for a week for a remodel.  Again, I will admit that hubby and I were the youngest couple there by about 15 years.  I hope that their remodel makes the place more current, but they don't lose the quality of food.

My hubby was not as impressed, but he's a German boy for WI.  He prefers brats and beer, so this place was not in his wheel house.

Here's the downside to this place.  I think the prices merit a little bit more food.  We ran up over $100 between two of us and had app, 2 entrees, and shared a dessert.  That's a bit steep, isn't it?  I let them know that I had the coupon and suddenly the nightly special  of  risotto with lobster was unavailable.   How does that happen at 630p.
