Such a sweet place to hangout & drink your hot cocoa (which was so smooth & tasty)...so many items to choose from and definitely a place that locals can come & enjoy! I like that it's shared space with ENVY next door so when I'm finished having breakfast or lunch, I can go shopping!! The store layout is very impressive when you first walk in. Love it!!",vMGSO3INkAa0SdFs7SwuIQ,0,1,5,7vUr5ql-oEIReJn8Ocx08w

The staff was friendly and welcoming and I even got a free muffin and a punch card to get a free coffee after the 10 order.
Thank you Coco Caff√®",zNxDpjMhSjlbE8Gp7HFsfw,2,4,5,SsZXARlkUnMenY3v9U8Msw

There is infused lemon water for everybody in the house free of charge. Great quality and upscale prices. Quiet place that is not overcrowded.",CSjH5smnqLy5lpFHXtynhA,0,0,4,UriYfRrpRKa4IFFe9sHEWQ
2348426,2017-03-09,0,Pg7DrmU-OjuRGLVR7jVHRg,"I had a turkey sandwich and my friend had the sriracha chicken wrap. Both came with a side salad.  The salad good, the sandwich and wrap were mediocre.  It took 25 minutes to get our food. When ordering, it took a good 10 minutes to even be acknowledged and then another 5 minutes to place the order and make payment.

Decor is nice.  The only person that was good was the sweet old lady doing EVERYTHING while a young man was on his phone most of the time. I believe even the owner, a skinny tall lady, didn't even say ""hello"" or ""we'll be right with you"" when we were waiting to place our order and we were RIGHT IN FRONT OF HER.

never again.",tUzxhxYiuJ7QjxpI45IJlg,2,1,1,f6eOnJLV-cPT7370_jMi4g
2363822,2017-01-04,0,Pg7DrmU-OjuRGLVR7jVHRg,Had a fantastic Apple Brie  Croissant.  The people here are so friendly and the food was great. Start out here at the back of the Town Square shopping center and be fueled for shopping! & its right across from Valet parking so give valet the keys & get something great to eat & a yummy hot drink,P-FIwA9dzkqPhS4wQLDh7A,0,1,5,LG6-cm7WR9MIzwvbwkPnPQ

They have a variety of healthy and filling options aside from pastries and coffee. We were there in the afternoon, so I got a fruits and vegetable smoothie instead of coffee.
It wasn't so, busy, but they're food prep can take awhile when there's only one person. It's understandable, because this isn't McDonalds. Again, it's a place I'd return to...especially if it's for a quick healthy meal at Town Square.",2gZRkcQp3SJgVRAC7nlgJw,0,1,4,7ugCMa5himHVgbI0bQVD_w
3085695,2017-04-16,0,Pg7DrmU-OjuRGLVR7jVHRg,"Nope, never again. My husband and I walked in and there was a woman behind the counter. She walked past us a few times before greeting us. It took about 10 minutes to get an order in and we were the only customers in line. I ordered an iced chai tea latte (which is on the menu), but there must have been some confusion because an older woman replaced the other girl and finished the transaction. For whatever reason she explained to me what a chai latte was (chai syrup and milk). I thought it was strange but I told her, ""perfect, that's exactly what I want."") That's not what I got... I received an overly sweetened chai flavored water. I took a couple sips and threw it away. What I don't understand is, why tell me what the drink is and then not make it that way?",MzqlnvVh4OJwFIIzAe50qw,0,0,1,ZzCgW122q5Kr3vkxGawnjw

3576436,2017-01-26,0,Pg7DrmU-OjuRGLVR7jVHRg,"The food is not bad, but I guess that salad that is supposed to come with your $9 sandwich, is only available if you dine in which is super disappointing since you have to extra for a bag of chips and you paid the same amount for dining in as you did taking it out. It's a cute place to hang out and grab coffee or tea though.",afo3heuLVHdlZmjDoKa2HQ,3,1,3,VKvUXTYTQ1CiR4lBFAhYJw

3691824,2017-03-11,0,Pg7DrmU-OjuRGLVR7jVHRg,"You can pretty much get anything from this place for a lower price anywhere else. They do have Lavazza, which is a finer quality coffee, but they'll make sure you pay the finer price for it. Also, all their pastries are from Sam's Club. Those will run you about five times as much than just getting it at Sam's a club yourself. To cut it short for ya here's their Three U's:  Unorganized, Unoriginal, Unethical.",7i47PDFmSBB2KpZ4kKuKCQ,1,1,1,YQZd02ffHYYtadCitDkzPQ
4085090,2017-03-20,0,Pg7DrmU-OjuRGLVR7jVHRg,"This is a cute restaurant in what looks to be a brand new outdoor mall. They have a variety of breakfast and lunch options, though nothing really stood out to me. I got an oatmeal and shake and my husband got the roast beef sandwich that came with a small salad. The food was good, though the oatmeal tasted instant, but nothing memorable that I would return to this spot in particular for. My one year old loved the chocolate nana shake and he's a tough sell! I wish the older lady working was a little more friendly, but it sounds from other reviews that she does most of the work which was the case on our visit as well, so I understand if she gets burned out. The other women working were polite and welcoming though. I hope they are successful in the future and perhaps just working through some kinks as it appears they are brand new.",4wP6hX4C8IVe82skYh36yg,0,1,4,cl5nLitknj93RHY41Sd7QQ

Great friendly customer service
Nice seating and layout
I like how their prices are not ridiculous when it comes to desserts and pastries
Got a macchiato and a chocolate bundt cake, both were tastefully served
Definitely will be returning everytime we go to Townsquare",8FpOYsX0xvWRlKkl6sKnBA,1,1,5,mtmxwqbuGYRgU4bjK4kV7Q

5377847,2017-03-31,0,Pg7DrmU-OjuRGLVR7jVHRg,"Came her on a Wednesday afternoon, the weather was great, and was looking to try something new. Great location, convenient to all who come to Town Square. Did the $10 for $20 deal offered through Yelp. Our total was $30 something so using the deal, we only had to pay $11 in the end. 

Upon entering the cafe, it was not busy and the decor was nice. Indoor and outdoor seating. Great variety on drinks and food items, as well as the desserts displayed right in front of you. We ordered the Pesto Panini with chicken, as well as some smoothies. Don't remember the names, but one has spinach and mango, while the other had pineapple and some other fruit. 

Food: food was great! Came out warm and in a timely fashion despite how busy it started to become. The paninis were warm and fresh and the mozzarella would be stringy, exactly how it's supposed to be. The smoothies came out few minutes after and tasted just as good as I thought it would. Definitely a healthy meal! 

Staff: the guy working was friendly and attentive. He apologized for the food coming out late and asked if we needed anything else. He was the only one working and it became kind of busy, rush people coming in all at once, maybe at least have two people working during the afternoons especially. Traffic seems to come a lot by Town Square employees during lunch time. Having an extra set of hands will definitely help! 

Overall, definitely will come back and try their other food items and possibly a dessert next time!",rSMrbp4gdGOceEcHO-sipA,0,2,4,4gCx8GOneWAfhOwxbq76GA

We got the salmon bagel sandwich and the chicken salad sandwich, a medium vanilla latte, and two smoothies. They were pretty good! I wish there was a little bit more cream cheese for the salmon bagel but overall it was delicious!

Last week we tried to look for this place when we went to Townsquare, couldn't find it, but it was probably just me and my bad driving!

Anyways we just ordered from here today for our lunch later! But so far the food and drinks have been really good!",CO-hrvV8pwxWufDqgtVrdw,3,3,5,B0kBNmYquEWg_1p5QTwrWg
