But they accept card and cash since you pay inside the store, their menu is small but they serve quesadillas, tacos and carne asada fries which they were out of the night I went :( but totally delicious tacos",TtcKl-FoQoigBXmEexsSOQ,1,0,4,02E0OiSSies8mC5DE-ZsfQ

It's not the largest Mercado I've been to nor does it have the widest selection, but what they do have is f*cking fantastic.  I'm kicking myself in the ass for not taking pictures of this south of the boarder culinary wonderland.  The meats and produce are always fresh.  Their selection of marinated meats are absolutely fantastic.  From fajita chicken, to 3 or 4 different cuts of carne asada, to the adobada seasoned pork and beef.  All of their tortillas are made fresh and in house.  In fact you can see them making them daily, and of course they are frying them up as well for chips.  Their salsas are also made fresh and in house as well. 

Since I left southern California I've been on this never ending search to find the perfect little Mercado and I'm happy to say after 3 years my search has come to an end.  Besides it being such a far drive for me I've got nothing but good things to say.  Now on to my never ending search for the perfect ceviche.",AoII0-uM9z0EesGnb9YCjQ,7,1,5,bD-kzgIWp1u0sVcPaMKURg

Prices are a little higher if you're comparing it to the other two, but there are a few things worthy of coming here.  #1 is their Ranchera meat.  Ever wanted to cook up some good carne asada?  I've learned that the best and easiest way to get this done is by buying it!  Who knows how to marinade better than these guys?!  I've tried every ranchera on the East and I have to say that Los Compadres sells the best I've ever had.  It's $8 per pound, but I'll gladly pay.  They use high quality meat that cooks to be so tender, juicy, and flavorful.  

Another secret to this place is their restaurant in the back.  I saw a sign outside of the Taco Y Taco menu right next to the Los Compadres sign.  I was so excited, I thought, ""Taco Y Taco is here too?!""  I went in all excited and ordered 1 carne asada and 1 al pastor taco ($1.70/taco).  I asked the cashier if the tacos were from Taco Y Taco, but she said they are Los Compadres.  I don't know why they have the menu outside if they aren't from the restaurant...but as I sat down and ate my taco, I realized that the tables were the same style as the tables at Taco Y Taco on Tropicana (who wouldn't recognize the old school look with the rose in the middle).  Coincidence?  Maybe if I spoke Spanish, I would've learned the back story to sign and tables and I'd be able to tell you guys about it.  But I could only speculate that maybe Taco Y Taco started in Los Compadres and worked its way up to what we know now.  But long story short, the tacos were really frickin' good!!  They filled it up so much that I couldn't take a bite without meat dropping.  The meat was juicy and fresh!  It also comes with cilantro, onions, and your choice of red/green salsa. 

They also burritos, pupusas, plates, and dessert, ceviche, and more.  

I'll definitely be back for tacos and I'm excited to try what else they have on the menu!",z4RytucxI_XfcMFaEI2DRg,7,6,4,aYS-KBBnxL0j5aFOiSUNyw

We had a huge order and had originally planned on going through taco y taco but they were too busy with it being cinco de mayo. The people at taco y taco told us about Los compadres (same owners), and they were beyond helpful. And the FOOD! Oh my gosh the food was so amazing. From the fresh tortillas they made us the day of to the al pastor. Everyone loved it and had a great cinco de mayo fiesta!

On top of everything they already did for us they also helped deliver our food! Wow, what great service. I couldn't believe how nice they were. 

 Thank you Los compadres!!",VXcvGGII3RSJ6Bl7UjVIfg,0,0,5,NGwX3MGkIN3XEhr-9tK_ZA
