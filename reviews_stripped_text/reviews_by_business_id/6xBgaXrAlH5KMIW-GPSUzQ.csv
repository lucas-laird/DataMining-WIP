The decor of scary movie posters, the movie of killer clowns from outer space playing in the background (Im afraid of clowns so my focus as elsewhere), the little arcade in the corner, and the mini stage with lots of space around it was some of the few things that caught my eye when I first walked in. 

The bartender Jesse ""Yea yea"" was the coolest dude to talk to. He was very friendly and the service was great. One of the owners played a few tunes with his guitar on the stage since it was pretty dead. That was super sweet. He is a good singer and guitarist, so it felt like he was playing just for the few people who were in there. 

I really enjoyed the vibe of everyone in the bar, of the place, and of some new beer I tried. Forgot the name, but it had a good crisp taste. 

I shall be back here, even if I am moving on the other side of town. I will have to go back when I can start sober and enjoy it even more! Also, when I can try their food. I always have to try the food from different bars. A must !",ufn1IPTJP7mRlmQP3a5dIQ,4,4,4,1TJ0Mklcb1gOuJZ9C9PEIg

I didnt have the opportunity to try a drink, since the 2 bar tenders where too busy in the conversation to take an order for my group. Outside smelled like puke.  The inside smelled like Simple Green and Puke. It was pretty empty (-10 people) on a Friday night, but it was only 11PM which is OK for Vegas.

So, I am updating from 4 to 3 stars and seeing Underworld can earn 1 or 2 more.

Pros: It is a fun place, well decorated, with a great sound system and hosting cool events... such as the Wednesday Late Night KILL OR BE KILLED Comedy Show and cool local music.

Cons: Uninspired selection, unfriendly service and prices that change depending on who you order from.

Check it out for yourself and give it a chance.

3088500,2012-05-17,1,6xBgaXrAlH5KMIW-GPSUzQ,"Service sucks. And the food sucks. Only reason why I am giving 2 stars is because the DJ is sort of good. And I like the horror-theme they got going on inside, the Jason and zombie bride human figures looks pretty cool.

Other than that, this place reminds me of those trashy joints back up in Reno, with art posers all full of themselves inside. They would rather chain smoke than work on their tip, and I regret tipping the bartender before my service was done, especially since she forgot that I prepaid for my second round of drinks and didn't even bother getting started on what I ordered from the menu.

When my burger, pasta, and fries finally made it on my table, it was FUCKING COLD! Except the thick fries. It's the same cheap fries that you get from Walmart and throw it into a microwave. The stuff that college kids eat because they are too lazy to cook something real up. 

Burger was lukewarm, does not feel fully cooked. Everything on the plate felt and tasted like it was made with a half-assed effort. Like they tossed the entire stuff into the microwave and took 15 minutes to bring it back out. 

Like what a previous reviewer said, they are trying to do everything at once, and failing at every aspect of it.

There are plenty of other places along the Chinatown area where the workers take more pride in their jobs. Here, this place is sort of nasty.",USpN4MpgR9RpwT7eKUA3aw,4,0,2,7MEboj19riJLePCmIe5KDQ

The beer tasted good and was reasonably priced (especially for Vegas).  The shots in the syringes were tasty.  

The pizza (with dough flown in from Boston) really hit the spot.  The mozzarella tasted fresh and there were lots of toppings.  

While the place seems to attract a goth crowd, we're not goth (at least on the outside) but felt welcome.  We had a great conversation with one of the owners, Jazz, about Bar Rescue and horror movies, on which he's quite an expert.  

Overall, it was a great experience and welcome break from the Strip.   If I lived in Vegas I'd probably be a regular.",WnMKao829Y_5_sr7ViWIGg,11,5,5,2h8JAPydyf3GW0cBASLh1w
3669035,2013-11-24,8,6xBgaXrAlH5KMIW-GPSUzQ,"I am being generous with my star because I love the pizza at this place.  Where to start with this place?  My girlfriends and I went in and the place was empty.  The service was a bit slow but the guy behind the bar, Jazz, chatted with us after we pulled conversation out of him.  I mentioned we were locals.  He seemed uninterested.   

We fell in love with the decor and all the fun items in the room.   I loved the fact that we had the spot to ourselves & the decor,  so I called my husband and his business partner to join us.  They met up with us and we tried the pizza.  

We had one that had chorizo and were blown away  by the flavor so we ordered another pizza.  As we were waiting on the food a camera crew showed up.  After a time of them setting up equipment they asked us if we would be willing to be on camera for Bar Rescue.  We agreed.  Thank goodness we were there or they wouldn't have had anyone to show on the shoot.

A guy with blue hair showed up and was hanging behind the bar.  He was rude and leaning on the bar, watching what the crew was doing.  I asked him if he should clean up or mess of empty plates, dishes and napkins, and he said no he wasn't on the clock.  He laughed and moved to be closer in the background of the camera shot.  I got his attention again and said, ""Don't you take pride in your work?  The empty glasses and trash are in the shot.  Show me where the trash can is and I will clear it up.""  After some reluctance he helped me clean up the mess.

My husband struck up a conversation with Jazz and found out he was one of the owners.  Later we found out that a guy who was watching us from the corner was the other owner.  When we left we said we would be back for the pizza.

Two weeks later my husband and I came in. Jazz was working and had no recollection of us.  How do you forget 5 locals who spent hours at your bar and eventually a camera crew making your place look good?  He didn't remember us so he barely talked with us, instead it was a Friday night and there was a group that came in that seemed to take his attention.  We got our pizza but refills on drinks came so slow that we were tired of waiting and decided to leave. 

Once outside there was the group that had come in and Jazz.  A girl called out, ""Why are you leaving?  Stay the dancing is abut to go off.""  We politely declined but were shocked at how again the place had such slow service and the owner seemed to be more interested in hanging out than making sure customers were happy.

We are gluttons for punishment I guess, because we had some friends in town and took them here for pizza.  They had seen the Bar Rescue show and wanted to try it.  We walked in and there were 6 people at the bar.  (6 on a Friday night happy hour time.)

We found a table and I walked up to the bar to order food and drinks.  Jazz was working again.  He was the only one behind the bar.  I ordered drinks and my friend got his food order out.  Jazz then turned his back to us and started making his way around the bar again.  Checking on people and chatting with them.  He came back after checking the bar for drinks.  He gave us our drinks and I said excuse me.  But some new people came in and sat at the bar and he was gone again.  My husband was on the phone and called out, ""Get me a Diet Coke please."" I said loudly in Jazz's direction, ""I'm trying but he hasn't gotten my order yet.""

After a while he came back and said, ""Did you need something."" I explained he hadn't gotten my drink and food order, only my friend's order had been completed.  He said, ""Okay well what do you want?""  I ordered the chorizo pizza again to which he said, ""Oh I care about the safety of my customers.  There was an issue with food poisoning at Firefly.  Did you hear about that.""  I nodded dumbfounded.

""Ever since that has happened I quit.  I have substituted it with sausage.  You will like it.""  He said.  I wanted to call BS because the Firefly incident had happened in May or late April.  I had been to this spot twice in less than a month and they had it, but at this point why argue.  I was just happy to have my order taken.  I rolled my eyes a bit and noticed a zombie arm was gone on the wall from the decor.    Where it had been was a grey patch and holes where the nails had once been.  (Mind you this is a black background.)  How hard is it to get a ladder, slap some black paint on a spot, and make the focal point of your bar look somewhat okay?

We got our food but as before our drinks were empty.  When we asked the lady that delivered our food about our drinks she said, ""I think Jazz is working on that,"" and disappeared back in the kitchen.  My husband tried to get drinks.  Jazz said he was busy and we would have to wait, as he had the hose in his hand. (We ordered waters and diet cokes.)  I give up this place has the worst service, music, and now what was good pizza is average. This place is a joke, don't go.",ToIicW_B8O4_Nx-1EBWbfg,34,2,1,VD7zOG0y_UjUgiaqd2RIpg
4102678,2012-01-04,1,6xBgaXrAlH5KMIW-GPSUzQ,"A MUST SEE for any horror genre fans!!!

This place is awesome!  It's decorated with any and everything horror film related, a good size stage for live performances, pinball machines and (when we went) House of 1000 Corpses playing!  What more could you ask for?  

The owner was working the night we went in and he was very friendly and helpful.  He was telling us about how long it took them to develop the menu because they wanted only the best and freshest ingredients and it def shows.  The food was the best any of have had at a bar, probably because it wasn't bar food!  The flatbread pizza was the best I've ever had.  My friends ordered a BBQ sandwich, a HUGE cheeseburger and fresh made onion rings.  The prices are vey reasonable also for both food and drinks.

They haven't been opened very long but I can see them having a huge local following and will likely become a must see for tourists. Next time I'll go on a weekend night to check out a band, Karate Karaoke or the Kill or be Killed Comedy show!

5100371,2012-03-01,2,6xBgaXrAlH5KMIW-GPSUzQ,"DTM: Doing Too Much

A bar that serves food without beers-on-draft isn't a bar at all. Fill the place up with old people, a heavy metal band you've never heard of, and deck the place in horror film decorations... the usual barfly will be quite disoriented. 

FOOD: The ""menu"" is freakishly small. We ordered the fried mushrooms, a burger, and a sausage & peppers sub. It was served up on plates that looked like they came out of a Color Me Mine studio. That's acceptable at home, but at a bar? Once I got over the whack plates, I discovered the food tasted as though a college kid cooked our meal in a dorm-room kitchenette--if you get what I mean: cold bread, basic condiments, and no flavor. To say the least, it was edible.I can make better food at home. And considering that no one else in the joint was eating, our food took abnormally long to get to the table. 

DRINKS: Liquor. Bucket of PBR deal. Exorbitant mark-ups on bottled beer, not a tap in sight. Basic beer selections (nothing special): Bud, Corona, Dos Equis, etc.

Underworld is trying to do too many concepts and they're not doing any of them very well. All the employees are decked out as zombies. But I don't consider the services here worth paying for. We used a $5 for $10 Restaurant.com coupon; we have one left but we wish we didn't.

Live metal band with a horror theme inside as their decor and full of people dressed in black in graphic metal band tees. It was a Saturday night and the band was rocking it and I was actually enjoying it until to the point when I wanted to order drinks.

Worst effing experience in my life!!! Me and my buddy waited at the bar making eye contact on the only two bar tender working on a Saturday night! Wtf? I'm waving, yelling and waiting and still no attemp to come where I was at! It came to a point where a stranger had to intervene and yell at the bartender that I needed to be served so she came looking all unpleasant and not really giving a damn or working for tips. Guess what, it's a rarity that I don't tip because of bad service but this one was not worth even a measly dollar!

Went over to the area to shoot some pool. Roomie kicked my ass and so I had to buy the next round of beers.  Waved down a server after she just served the people near us and asked for two budlight. She said yea but never came back! Searched her out to see if she completely forgot because it was a busy night but she was just there watching the band and smoking! Really? I hate to bring race into this but it seems like I was being ignored because of the way I was dressed and ethnicity.  I didn't fit in at all. The majority were white with metal band style attire and here I am dressed like an average joe and the only Filipino in the place.

They have five specialty drinks and I got to try two of them - the one with the pop rocks and the one with a Twinkie on top. I gotta say I was very amused by the pop rock candy making loud fizzy popping noises in the drink, so much that I stole this drink from Max and gave him my drink (which was a coconut rum and pineapple cocktail). I highly recommend this item if you come here.

This place attracts the goth scene and almost everyone except our group was dressing in black, covered in tattoos, black lipsticks and black eyeshadow. I dig that. The music was a mix between techno, house and I don't know what; all of which were cool and different to me. 

I'd say this is a dive bar kind of place - but it's definitely a unique kind of dive bars.",f0TN5yZ7JBMKIzr3hSuwFQ,7,6,4,VxeODaJq2464MO0hNqNzpw
