We had the vegetarian tacos in a red pepper wrap instead of the vegan option and we also had the vegan nachos. Both were amazing full of flavor and good texture very friendly service . The only thing that would have made it better is the protein/fake meat was, it was cold and for tacos and nachos we expected a warm dish . If we had the option to have it heated up that would have made the whole experience perfect . Hopefully when we visit next time they can accommodate our hot request :)",iNfncg-Im_-dzfOwWuuLyA,0,0,4,BbYW0pZWiZK3upRAmHn6Pw

Trying to be a good friend to my vegan traveling partner, I agreed to come to lunch here so she could indulge and have a truly vegan meal. I ate a big breakfast because I was sure I wouldn't like anything on the menu. I mean, vegan cheese? Come on. 
BUT... I think I scarfed down half of her nachos! They are amazing!!! Delicious! They certainly don't taste vegan. The jicama fries are interesting. But the nachos are amazing!

Walking into the small cafe, we were immediately impressed with a beautiful fresh aroma of living food. We ordered the vegan nachos and the chicken salad wrap which are both highly recommended. They have some great fresh squeezed juice combos too. The ambiance is upbeat and casual. You can dine right outside the cafe on the balcony overlooking the center made entirely of containers.

My wife ordered the nachos and they too were excellent, though it is not as difficult to make excellent nachos as it is to make fries using jicama.  The service was quick and friendly and the food was great.  My only negative comment about the food offered is that much of it was an attempt at replicating non vegan food.  I don't miss meat or dairy and I prefer a vegan restaurant that challenges me to try new and wild creations, not replicating food that wasn't that good when I ate meat and dairy.  If you are in the Container Park area, this cafe is a great place for a snack, lunch, or even a dinner.

Spring rolls are as good as you would imagine a spring roll to  be. So no complaints there. Lettuce wraps were great flavor, but I would have enjoyed them more if they were served with a crunchier lettuce. The lettuce used is thin and has no crunch, so since the inside faux chicken is soft in texture, I felt like it's too much ""soft"" per bite texturally. I solved this by crunching up the chips that came with it and adding them inside. Aside from that, though, the taste is GREAT! Best faux chicken salad I have ever tasted.

The platter was certainly big enough to be shared and the price was under $20! Everything was so delicious and flavorful! It was hard to believe the beef was just a vegan protein as it tasted just like seasoned beef.

480100,2014-01-18,0,6TSpAuUdmo2UEn9emgd8xg,"In the past two weeks, I've turned two religious carnivore eating individuals into semi vegan eating animal lovers - well at least when there at Simply Pure by Chef Stacey Dougan in The Cointainer Park area in Las Vegas.  I've lived in 4 countries, over 15 states and tried every rendition of vegetarian meals. I've been on this journey for 12 years and since living in Las Vegas (8 months) I've almost considered being a waterterian because of the horrid food choices here.  When I came across  Simply Pure by Chef Stacey Dougan - it reminded me of why I became vegetarian. All of the food choices are amazingly fresh and flavorful. The inviting experience of Simply Pure by Chef Stacey Dougan continues when you meet any of the knowledgable staff. They greet you with a smile, a sample and a history lesson on the food. You can tell that take pride in their product and presentation.  Simply Pure by Chef Stacey Dougan sets itself apart because its not one of those excessively hippy and over pretentious spots,  where staff members are forcing the health issue on its patrons - they greet you with an honesty.

I've had every item on the menu and there all delicious, but the nachos w/ mock chicken and guacamole is my go to meal. It has always exceeded my expectations and any carnivore who's skeptical, try the nachos with the mock chicken or crumbles both are irresistible.

If you're looking for variety, you can't go wrong with the well  priced salad bar.

Simply Pure by Chef Stacey Dougan has restored my faith in Las Vegas veggie scene. At this point I never need to find another veggie spot to eat at in Las Vegas, because I am completely satisfied with Simply Pure by Chef Stacey Dougan.",-ZhVxZm-wCBGKPWmqm2Big,3,3,5,Ws7-zghsOOuGoNatSw2Tpg

By the name i thought this place was healthy but after talking to them realized its pretty deceptive. I asked if the food was organic...i mean simply pure to me implies clean food but they said no. I asked well, is it at least non-gmo? They said no. I was a bit shocked. How is food pure if its gmo? 

If you dont care about health it tastes great but remember to ask questions and not trust trendy names if you have health concerns.

My husband and I are both vegans who enjoy visiting Vegas and the many delicious restaurants at the Wynn and Encore. This time we thought we'd leave the strip and check out the Fremont area. 

We happened upon this place soon before we had to leave the Container Park for the airport and decided to split a BLT for a last snack. 

After we had paid, I noticed this place had a B health rating. My husband has worked in the food industry and tells me you can be a pretty gross place and still get an A, so this was disturbing. If I had noticed it before we paid, I probably wouldn't have eaten there. So be warned... this place is dirty.

Also after we placed the order, the girl working said, ""It's going to take about 15 minutes, is that okay?"" I have no idea why it would take 15 minutes to make the sad sandwich we were about to receive, the restaurant was pretty empty, but we said fine.

Fifteen minutes later, we received a couple barely-panini'd pieces of bread with some tempeh bacon inside that I don't think was cooked. The bacon was cold and not charred/browned in any way. Unappetizing. Then there was a tiny bit of lettuce and tomato, plus a glop of vegan mayo. The sandwich looked like something I'd make at home while in the middle of a conference call, half-heartedly paying attention to what I was doing.

There was hardly anyone else inside ordering food, so I don't know what took so long to get this. Don't go here expecting good service.

We scarfed the sandwich down since we needed a little snack before a night of travel. But I regretted spending my calories on this, when the day/night before I'd enjoyed delicious vegan sushi, pasta, and much more at other Vegas establishments.",H1lhB-gCSbdtblglfVysag,3,0,2,5bH9Xs-uiRpnCfFxf9DBQg

1561723,2015-04-20,1,6TSpAuUdmo2UEn9emgd8xg,"Driving back hungry to Los Angeles from Utah, it was desperation that had me looking at vegan/vegetarian restaurants on Yelp. On my iPhone. Somehow, it didn't register to me that this was a RAW establishment. I am not a fan of raw food. It isn't typically my practice to eat RAW. So as far as I know, this might be the best raw food on the planet. I didn't enjoy eating it or paying so much for it. We waited a very long time for them to prepare the food. Too long. We ordered I think three entrees and two side dishes and drinks and ended up paying about $90 bucks with tip.

No servers. No plates. No metal forks. This is take out.

Chef Stacey is not the one in the kitchen making these meals. I think she should do more on her Yelp listing to stress that this is raw, uncooked food.  ""Fries"" should be called ""Jicama Fries"" and so forth. The pictures can be very deceiving. The portions are fairly large but if you're not into raw food, a huge portion of ""fries"" made from cold Mexican turnips is bad mojo.

I originally rated this at two stars. I've added a star back since it was my mistake to come to a raw food place when I didn't want to. But ... 

If I were a betting man, I'd bet that I won't be coming back.",ncxAgG2xFSC_WItpLex5jA,0,0,3,EnmODwO7Yf62OY05eOYz9w

Good food but to have a business you have to be realistic. To wait the better part of an hour for getting deli style food is a little ridiculous. The table next to me didn't get what they ordered but didn't complain because by that time they were just hungry.

*update in response to owner's comment below. 
There were 4 employees. Small place like that I'd wonder where more could be. And the owner Stacy was my checkout person, heard (and looked right at me) when I asked for an update at double the time she told me it would take, and the person that handed my food to me. She knew exactly what was happening. A simple 'I'm sorry for your wait' would have been respectful, free and taken no time.",Nr4PuhsPNzHJl09mVTvOlg,2,1,1,0zdAC0z5i8L-acAYzDUuFg

1587646,2016-11-19,0,6TSpAuUdmo2UEn9emgd8xg,"Super small all vegan eatery, so be patient.  Many people purchasing food here seemed to call in their order, which makes sense.  It's located in the Container Park, so you might be moseying around and just want to pick it up and eat outside.  The people eating here seemed to want the nachos - yes, me too!  Who doesn't want nachos?  They looked amazing, but, I avoided the heavy nature that day.... but if I am back in Vegas, this is probably one of the first things I will want to eat.

They have an amazing selection of gluten-free and raw foods, as well as juices, aside from ""traditional"" vegan food.  Zucchini noodles here are beautiful, so opt for having the trio in the platter/ sampler, because otherwise, how can you pick the sauce/ topping you want?  They have kale chips, but sometimes they don't - they run out.  They make everything from scratch, so, yes, for a small shop, they may run out of items.  Spring rolls are good easy choices.  The most amazing thing I ate here was the Chik'n Salad Lettuce Wraps - all raw, nut-based, lettuce wrapped edible brilliance.   This was my favorite by far, and I am dreaming about it from afar.

The best part about this place is you will come here for ""comfort"" and familiar food, and see what other people eat/order, and be inspired or induced into ordering more.  The dessert (cheesecake) is alright, but nothing stupendous.  I would rather have nachos!  Overall, this place is a little gem in the Container Park.

My favorites from Simply Pure are the:

Chicken lettuce wraps- so fresh, flavorful and filling. If you're wanting something light and delicious this one is a winner. Tastes great in the lettuce wrap and if you dip tortilla chips in it. 

Nachos- I think it would be fun if they added some beans or maybe a couple extra veggies but its still delicious and something I come back for regardless of simplicity. 

Lasagne- HUGE portion of yummyness here! All of the flavors are on point in my opinion and it's no wonder why this one is a crowd favorite. 

The kale and cranberry salad- I never thought kale could taste so good... really. Raw kale is something that without proper pairing can be bitter and over powering. But, Chef Stacy has worked her magic into creating a beautiful array of balanced flavors with this gorgeous salad! Not to mention you get a heaping portion for the price (much like literally everything Simply pure has to offer)!

TLC fresh pressed juice is my JAM! Really need some self control so I don't drink it all in one sitting. 

Just as a tip, seating is limited! I hope some day Chef Stacy can open up a full sized restaurant! She deserves it. Until then? Don't be sad if there's no where to sit... just means the food is THAT GOOD!!",4Lih7V69TZ1VTNziz8rs9w,4,0,5,K_oFQyOUrxoxwVujxI-h5A

After the lady takes my order she tells me I have to use my card in order to process the order. I wasn't about to do that when I had all this cash. So I came in and ordered. The cashier didn't say hello, or make me feel welcomed at all. She spoke monotone as if she were annoyed I was there. Then I sat down waited so long for my food. Listening to the cook get on the cashier over every possible thing. So I could imagine why she wasn't to pleasant. It took an hour possibly more for my food to finish. 

My second visit, today. Well, again, another pleasant cashier. People like to be welcomed into an establishment for that all around great experience. This place lacks that big time. They are understaffed as well so the cashier has to leave to grab food while someone waits in line to order and the food take a while to be made.

I come here because of how amazing the food is. By far one of my most favorite vegan food restaurants in Vegas. So I do recommend eating here. Just don't expect to be welcomed when you come in.

2016947,2015-07-02,5,6TSpAuUdmo2UEn9emgd8xg,"Raw vegan food at the Container Park. Stacey Dugan's dishes are tasty, but may be an acquired taste for some. The menu, like the storefront, is small- a few entrees, a couple of sides, plus juices and salad bar options. 

There are only four juices ($7/16oz), but I was pleased with the two I tried: TLC (lemon, lime, mint, cucumber, apple) being the favorite, with a light and refreshing flavor, while the High Octane (beets, carrots, cucumber, ginger) was balanced but less sweet.

Favorite dish to get here is the raw tacos: vegan ground beef with taco seasonings, topped with pico de gallo and avocado slices, wrapped in Romaine lettuce leaves and served with a side of tortilla chips. The leaves are stuffed with plenty of filling, and can get a bit messy. The chips were great for scooping up the excess. Unfortunately, the jicama chili cheese ""fries"" were not a hit with my guy and the cold crunch paired with the chili and cheese toppings just didn't work for me. As Bethany put it, I think I would have enjoyed this more if it were heated. 

Service from Stacey was polite, drinks and dishes were made to order. I would come back here for juices or the lettuce wraps, but pricing is a bit on the high side for those who don't require the vegan/raw dining, around $13/entrée. She does have some plates available that are a bit higher but allow you to try three or four menu items.

2092365,2015-01-25,0,6TSpAuUdmo2UEn9emgd8xg,"I just moved to Las Vegas and I am amazed at the outstanding number of vegan/vegetarian restaurants. I planned on taking my daughter to Container Park for the first time and was looking online for dinner options for myself. I was so excited when I found out about Simply Pure and couldn't wait to give it a try. Once we got there and the time rolled around I grabbed my daughter something to eat from one of the restaurants downstairs and got situated with her. I decided to go up stairs and get my food from Simply Pure. I asked the gentleman working what was the best thing to eat at Simply Pure and he told me the Raw Nachos. Which I was a little taken back by because chips are not raw. I decided to give it a shot any ways. After I ordered and paid the gentleman told me it would be 20-25 minutes because there were about 5 orders ahead of mine. I placed the order at 5:19pm. I said okay and went back down to where my daughter and father were eating. At 5:38pm I decided to head back up to see if my food was done yet. I waited another 15-18 minutes for my food. While I was in the store for the remainder of the time waiting on my food which was now taking almost double what I was told, another worker and I am assuming what is her boyfriend came in with a big box of produce. I thought yes someone to help this poor man working by himself. Well I was wrong. All she did was ask a few customers if they had been helped and then proceeded to make her boyfriend a wrap. I have worked in the food service industry for years and that is a huge NO NO. She did not help her co worker she helped herself and then left. You just don't do that sort of thing in front of customers EVER. After she left and I was still waiting the owner called in and the man working picked up the phone and told her that nothing had been prepped the shift before and that and that someone should be called in to do it. Judging by his frustration the owner said no. Which is also a huge NO NO when you want to run a well organized small company. If your workers call in and say I need extra help now you better get your ass down there and help them. That is how a well run small business is supposed to work. I ended up getting my nachos at around 5:57pm or so. When I sat down and ate them I was actually shocked because usually good food takes time and I do understand that and I am more than willing to wait. These on the other hand were not good AT ALL. The vegan protein tasted like it had been way over seasoned with cumin and the sauce had a very strange taste. I did not realize until it was too late that the nacho cheese that they offer had to be ordered separately so I did not get that. I am assuming that would have been better than the sauce that was on there. On the menu it says that it comes with avocado. It should say that it comes with 3 small strips of avocado which to me was not enough. Over all service was bad food was bad. The moral of the story here is that if you are the owner of a small company you have to have an invested stake in your workers and your company even when YOU ARE NOT PRESENT. With that being said I would not recommend this place to anyone and I certainly wont be back.

Even with it being as hot as it was, Stacey assured me the vegan lasagna is a must try. I am a fan of lasagna so without hesitation I stopped in and ordered it. I was greeted when I first walked in by friendly cashiers waiting to take my order. They informed me the wait would be about 25 minutes. I said that's perfectly fine. I appreciate they take the time to prepare a meal without just throwing it in the microwave. When the lasagna arrived it was a large portion enough to share with someone else along with a side salad. The salad was a nice portion of mixed greens with a really complimenting dressing. Refreshing!!! The Lasagna was full of flavor. I really enjoyed the different ingredients combined which complimented each other well in this dish. You can tell she put some thought into creating this. It was hearty, great tasting, and large enough to share with someone. Being vegan you often times find lasagna just whipped together with a tasteless pasta sauce, but not this one. I have enjoyed every meal I've had from this café.

I do love the fact that it's international dishes turned vegan. International dishes have so much punch in flavor! 

Service: 5/5
Info was explained so well, I was more so shocked rather than listening. Comparing this place to Greens & Proteins, this place is so much better at service. 

Presentation: 5/5
I did a take out, and even the take out box is loud. That's a good thing by the way. When your food looks good and you have a good looking take out box, I believe you'll look good too! Portion of the vegan nachos were just right and filling too! Chinapoblano at Cosmo need to come down and take a lesson about portions from Chef Stacey, because this is the size people eat! 

Taste: 4/5
As a vegan chef, I tend to cook with loud spices that have my clients look out to the horizon with a confused look on their face trying to guess what it is. Chef Stacey did this with the nachos. I did find the vegan protein a bit salty as I devoured the dish. The nice size portion of the avocado smoothed out the saltiness though. Thankfully I had a bottle of water on hand too. 

Overall: 5/5
A great place to indulge and check out if you're in the area. Great location for both locals and visitors. Prices do match the portions so you're getting what you pay for, which most ""hip"" vegan establishments or venues who cater to vegan often miss. 

Tips: 
Parking - Park at El Cortez on Ogden & 6th. There are two separate garages, one for hotel guests and non hotel guests. 

If you can't find a close enough parking spot, just park and walk. DT streets take getting used to, plus one street was closed off for an event, so it made getting to the other side a bit frustrating.",Ws4PEHZHZQ13_sovIIDUsQ,1,2,4,Zfss9p3BRW1jiidY-tKMxQ

2746637,2018-06-06,1,6TSpAuUdmo2UEn9emgd8xg,"I ordered through UberEats. 

I just want to point out that this restaurant creats vegan raw foods so when it comes to wanting hot food or food packed full of flavor,  look elsewhere.  This isn't a bad thing but if it isn't what you want or was expecting,  it's probably because it's a raw vegan restaurant.  To start off I ordered the pesto tomatoe flat bread with lime chips and a half an order of fake beef nachos,  along with two juices.  The flat bread tasted alright but honestly made me nauseas a few bites in (I ate it all regardless because I was hungry). I eat vegetarian and been eating vast amounts of fruits and vegetables, mainly raw, so I know it wasn't because of not being used to healthy foods.  I dont know what kind of imitation cheese they put on it but it just didn't sit well with me. And I just felt the flavor wasn't very balanced;  In my opinion I feel it needed more pesto to balance out the intense flavor of the vegan cheese. I just didn't think it was worth the money when I've eating at pretty much every veg place in town and have had similar flat bread meal that was more flavorful and balanced for the same price. It needs improving.  The nachos I tasted however were decent for non-hot food but the imitation beef was EXCELLENT.  

The con I have is when my ubereats driver pulled up they were struggling to keep our drinks upright as the restaurant never put them in drink holders. They were literally packed into a flimsy box that was falling apart at their weight and I could tell the driver was pissed because she had to hold it with one hand and drive with the other so they wouldn't completely collapse and explode in her car!  When I called the shop immediately after I got my order around 4:10pm and I wanted to speak to a manager about it the woman on the phone said they were outside interviewing but would call me back.  They never called me back,  lol.  And when the woman on the phone asked me what I was complaining about I was brief with her and she just explains that they used to never have drink holders.  And now they just used flimsy boxes that aren't drink holders AS drink holders. Huh? If McDonald's can afford cup holders and these other vegan restaurants have them,  why doesn't this place have them? Furthermore the drinks were warm so imagine drinking raw vegetables or fruit juice WARM.  Gross! I hope they get a good laugh outta this and then actually get some drink holders so paying customers and your uber drivers won't have to worry again about drinks spilling in their $100k cars! Plus both drinks were $12 that was at risk going down the drain and I don't appreciate playing with my money like that.  

Overall I won't be back because honestly what I ate I could make at home that tastes better for the fraction of the cost. I feel they need to improve on their flavor, taste what others are doing around town and then go from there. Because if crave vegan food there are better tasting food,  even though not strictly raw,  elsewhere.",GujGKIqC31ZkSXhLgpxGzw,0,0,3,G_dbW0hRRMbsDp8_7U0WeA

It was super tasty and hit the spot. The food here looked wonderful as well, and I would have liked to have tried it if I had been hungry.

2802902,2015-04-14,0,6TSpAuUdmo2UEn9emgd8xg,"Reviewing this restarant is really hard, especially for a non-vegan/vegetarian. Ill start by saying that. I am rating my own experience, hopefully you'll have a better one.

The restaurant is in container park, which always means a cool atmosphere. I ordered sampler #2. Unfortunately i waited about 40 minutes for my food. And that's especialy surprising since ALL FOOD IS SERVED COLD. My food sure didnt seem like it took 40 min of preperation. The guy next to me ordered nachos and he said it took them 50 min to get his food. I was surprised the employee at the counter didnt even warn me that it would be a long wait - i was hungry and would have gone elsewhere.

As far as the food is concerned, i wasnt that impressed. Sampler #2 comes with a taco, fries, and a spring roll with kale chips on the side. The taco was a slice of avocado and sprinkles of fake meat in a lettuce leaf. That was ok but would have been much better served warm. Cold is just so unsatisfying. The fries were jicama maybe? They were sliced like fries and covered in fake meat and a creamy sauce that was decent. They were very crunchy which was kind of nice. Would have been better hot. The spring roll was the laziest food i have ever seen. It was one of those sticky rice paper rolls holding lettuce together. Thats it. The guy at the counter told me they had run out of a noodle that was supposed to go inside it too...surprised they still made it for me. Kale chips were on the side - ive never had kale chips before but the seasoning was so heavy i could barely eat them. I dont think thats how they are supposed to be....i ended up throwing out almost my entire meal. Very disappointing after that 40 min wait for my food! And $16 for this sampler was a bit overkill too...

They have some fresh juices that look good - may try this place again for juice but i have no intention of buying food here again. If youre a vegan though, you may enjoy the creative transformation of these veggies.",EmWRBnsaKgpJLT2xmKJgiA,0,0,2,E6tDzN6V9k3BmxPlzbbKNQ
2836509,2015-06-15,0,6TSpAuUdmo2UEn9emgd8xg,"Hired Chef Stacey to cater our wedding and we were beyond thrilled with the turn out! It was 100% vegan and gluten free. She was fabulous to work with, listened to what we wanted and executed it beautifully. Her pricing was better than others who would cater vegan that we priced, we were very pleased with it. I was surprised thinking that she would be more pricey than she was. she doesn't automatically add in tip on either. So if you are thinking of having an event catered vegan, she's your lady!!! She will make a menu fit for you, doesn't just have a set list of items she makes that you pick from. 

READ ON FOR DETAILS:
The presentation of the serve yourself food was very pretty and all of our guests loved loved loved the food!! Basically every plate was cleaned, surprising to some people who were concerned about having all vegan GF food. 

We had enchiladas, Thai (fresh) spring rolls with dip, some roasted battered cauliflower thing, a large fruit platter with papaya, mango, strawberries, blueberries, pineapple and cherries (our choosing), chips and salsa, a taco bar with; corn tortillas, Spanish brown rice, black beans, fajita vegetables, guacamole, pico, green salsa, mango salsa, chipotle aioli, cashew nacho cheese, roasted garlic cloves, shredded cabbage & romaine lettuce. 

The meat eaters of the group were IN LOVE with the enchiladas and we kept getting told how amazing they were. At the end of the night there weren't any left and people were asking for more.  No one could believe how amazing all of it tasted, this was before they found out ALL of it was vegan&GF. They knew it would be mostly vegan but figured some might not be. The only soy product was TVP in the enchiladas. 

I knew people would be happy with the food when we did a tasting with Stacey (visiting from out of state) but the resounding feedback saying ""soooo good"" was a bit more than I even expected, since many of our non vegan guests weren't too into ""healthy"" eating.

Thank you Chef Stacey!!!",N0a3GZgm-3gvEEThAG1WtA,1,2,5,D_gvBCIAvRU2ZO6zs79TqA

""Exactly 1 year ago today I quit my job at Wynn Resorts and stepped out on faith to pursue a life of full time freedom and entrepreneurship. Less than one year later, I fulfilled my dream of opening my own vegan restaurant. 1 year ago i was full of anxiety, fear, hope and faith. Today I am filled with abundant love, extreme gratitude, hope restored and faith realized. I am happy. I am free. I thank GOD for allowing me to experience life. My only prayer is that I remain a conduit through which He works and that I teach others to truly live their passion. #SimplyPure #ChefStaceyDougan #January4th #DreamFulfilled #TeamFreedom""

     We walked into the tiny little container and we were greeted by a gentleman who seemed a little over the day at that point. Never the less... He proceeded to give a run down of how everything worked and even let us taste a few salad bar items before we ordered. The couscous was pretty darn good so I will be back for that. 

     We opted for the pesto zucchini pasta with sun dried tomatoes and the spring rolls to share. The prices and portions are comparable to places like sun cafe in LA and GO RAW around town. They may seem high... But they Are definitely enough to feed two people comfortably. The bill rang in at right around 20 bucks before tip. Basically... Ten dollars a person and we both left feeling full and satisfied. Order smart and you won't be breaking the bank and remember it's raw... You fill up a little quicker. 

     The pesto... Probably one of the best vegan pestos I've ever eaten... It was thick and creamy and delicious. Vegenation could use some insight and schooling from chef Stacey on what a good vegan pesto should taste like. The portion was large enough for both of us. My only regret is that we didn't put more toppings on it!! The sun dried tomatoes were a perfect touch and the texture was wonderful. The spring rolls Were fat thick pieces of heaven. They were perfectly crunchy on the inside and served with a nice sweet and sour sauce. We loved both items equally:) and finished the entire meal. 

     This is a perfect edition to the downtown area... And for somewhere like container park... It's an ideal concept. We can't wait to go back and order more of the delicious food and platters we saw... And next time we will make sure to save some room for dessert.

The full order of nachos was quite a generous amount, I was not able to finish it in one sitting. I was so happy that their cheese actually resembled the flavor of nacho cheese. I've had some pretty bad replicas but theirs was spot on. The nachos were topped with a few slices of avocado but they were mostly consisted of cheese and vegan ground beef. I wish they added more pico de gallo to lighten it up and add some acidity. I feel like guacamole also would've been a better choice for nachos than avocado slices and I missed the sour cream.

The jicama chili cheese fries are basically the exact same thing as the nachos except they use jicama. I loved their pesto zucchini pasta! It was fresh, light and flavorful.

3416201,2016-03-31,1,6TSpAuUdmo2UEn9emgd8xg,"I do love this place.  My favorite is the Nachos Grande.  Taste like real Nachos!  This is my go to order when I decide to have this place for lunch at the last minute.  The last several times I've gotten it, it was perfect.  I'm not sure if it was me this last go around, but the ""beef"" to me tasted a tad bit on the salty side.  But it's still my favorite.  This go around, I also tried the Decadent Chocolate Cheesecake.  Love it.  Although to some non-vegan eaters, they would frown upon the thought of having a vegan cheesecake.  I got the ""eww"" text message when I sent a picture to my guy.  You have to have an open mind to enjoy vegan desserts.  Off topic, I tried a vegan muffin at another place and I didn't care for that, which made me hesitant to try any ""vegan"" desserts, but the cheesecakes here at Simply Pure is awesome to my likings. 

In the past I've also tried the Mama Mia Lasagna.  I ordered it to go.  While it was tasteful and good, I thought they overloaded my container with the ""sauce"".  My lasagna was drowning in it.  If I did order it again, I'd ask if they could hold off on the sauce.  

In the past I've also tried their Sampler #1 that came with Zucchini Pasta Trio, Nacho Grande, and the Chicken Salad Lettuce Wrap.  I enjoyed everything except for the Chicken Salad Lettuce Wrap.  I wasn't feeling the flavor or texture of it. 

Last, I've tried the Thai Basil Spring Rolls.  I wasn't a big fan of these.  To me, the vermicelli noodles were on the hard side.  

As far as service goes, all I can say is EH.  It's hit or miss for me when I go.  The workers there are friendly but as far as calling in orders or just calling in general, sometimes I get no answer especially when I'm trying to place a pick up order.  This last go around, I came in and there were three guys in front of me.  I'm not sure what the holdup was, but the gal at the register was taking FOR-EV-ER on one guy who sounded like he ordered one thing.  
  
So with all that being said, I'll always be back!  Happy Eatings!",0uCWbprsjcEwotwKRVKpWQ,1,2,4,TKsQt7IEeE0wd-qu8c--iw

3433578,2015-05-26,2,6TSpAuUdmo2UEn9emgd8xg,"Before going you should know a couple of things. The business is located on the 2nd story at the container park. When you enter the door you'll see that there is only room enough for about four adults to stand at the counter to give their order. You will have to scout out a table on your own. These are scattered along the narrow walk way and clustered in a couple areas outside in public spaces not directly connected with this business. Depending on the time of day you may be stuck sitting in the sun. Additionally you will need to bus your own table. 
I thought the prices were high. Our lunch for 2 came in at just under $50. That included 2 juices, 2  vegan wraps and one kale snack. On a personal note I will say it was some of the worst tasting food I've ever tried. Healthy food need not be awful. The physical arrangements are quite informal. It is really more like a stationary food truck. We went on Memorial Day when the weather was still very nice. The best part of our time there was enjoying the nice breeze. I know this review is negative. I don't write these unless we really had an unpleasant time. Maybe we should have taken the food back and asked for a refund?

So we decided to try it. First off it is located at Container Park which is fine but when you go inside it is extremely small, there are places to sit down and eat directly outside of the business. Inside seating is limited to 8 to 10 people, 2 seats per table. The atmosphere was ok the customer service was average. The best thing on the menu was the nachos and jicama fries. Everything was cold nothing was hot or cooked.

3865654,2014-12-23,2,6TSpAuUdmo2UEn9emgd8xg,"Vegan places in Las Vegas can be so hard to find. I've gotten used to just going somewhere with my friends and getting a basic salad or sandwich with no ""umph"" to them. I had seen some reviews of Simply Pure and saw pictures of the delicious looking nachos but didn't know if I wanted to fork out the money for premium vegan food.

I am pretty dang glad I did. In the future, I will get the amazing nachos every time... Maybe venture to the zucchini pasta. I got the ultimate sampler plate that comes with 1 raw vegan taco, 1 raw vegan chicken salad wrap, a serving of nachos, a serving of jicama chili fries, and 3 different samples of the zucchini pasta. 

The zucchini pasta came with 3 different sauces: a pesto, a creamy cashew sauce (with incredible seasonings on top!), and a marinara. I would defieget the pesto or cashew sauce again but I wasn't insanely thrilled with the marinara. It was good but I wouldn't eat a whole plate of it.

The chicken salad was made from tofu that day and was pretty tastey. The texture isn't the same as real chicken but the flavor was there. The taco was nommy and had the same ""ground beef"" that's on the nachos and fries. I could eat about 3 of them and be pleasantly full.  ^_^

The nachos, like I've said before and I'll say it again, were amazingggg. The cashew cream and fake beef was delightful :D

I wasn't the biggest fan of the jicama fries. It was a raw dish so the fries were crispy. They had good flavor but I didn't like the crunchiness of the raw fries.

Overall, I would definitely come back! Do expect about a 15 minute wait if you order the sampler. I understand that it does take a while to create such a variety of food. I was very happy with my meal!!",giZgTnDxds-FQLi7nBxsBA,5,4,4,JDGwNHbm7S6amRfMW9Y23Q

They have a raw vegan salad bar that is $10.99/lb and I was able to sample a couple different items, the Kale Salad was my personal favorite. I couldn't decide between the Jicama Chili Cheese Fries or the Nachos, but decided on later since I'd been eyeballing them for awhile. Portion was pretty big, I could only eat half of my order.

But - maybe if you are vegan - it works?

My daughter got their grilled cheese and we shared the kale chips.  She loved the grilled cheese and still raves about it.  The kale chips are awesome, very low in calories, and surprisingly satiating.  Price for everything is about average to the rest of the Vegan/Vegetarian spots that I've been to.

4081126,2018-03-14,0,6TSpAuUdmo2UEn9emgd8xg,"This place is ok. But the TVP ""beef"" wrecks the entire menu because it is low quality. It is rubbery and doesn't chew well at all (I spit it out). But humans will eat anything... even rubber... which is really sad.

For example, the Gardein beef at Vegenation is a much much better vegan meat. You could try the pizza there and experience this for yourself! Beef crumbles at The Modern Vegan are also better than the one's here.

I'd like to know what brand of beef crumble they are using because I'm pretty sure it is not the higher quality Gardein product.

Either improve the TVP or else have an option to substitute it with tofu.

Other thing I don't like is everything is premixed so if I want to get enchiladas with no onion, I can't do that.

On the plus side - cashew cheez here is the best vegan cheez in town! It's way more flavorful than other spots and the consistency is amazing.

Simply Pure has potential and obviously it is tough because they are in a cramped space. 

I do appreciate the owner Stacy's thoughtful comment to my review so I really hope they can incorporate some more flexibility into the menu. But - I can't raise my rating to more than 2 stars because I just can't eat here. Oh well.",6gSIqISrFmTeBpEmYjf3Ag,0,0,2,RbDeH871DBf1qFxQ6dCMow

We weren't fans of any of their juice combinations, and we tried them all. They were heavy on some of the more unpleasant flavors (especially ginger and celery). We won't be getting those again.

We found Simply Pure on the second floor of the right side of Container Park.  It was a very small place with no indoor seating which I was kinda bummed out about because it was a chilly night.  But I was relieved that we found seating outdoors downstairs next to the heating lamps.  

When I purchased the Groupon, I read that they specialize in raw vegan food, but the menu is not all raw.  For example, you can get your wrap in a tortilla instead of lettuce.  Honestly, my BF and I were relieved that it was not all raw because after walking all day we were hungry and wanted something that would fill us up.  Our Groupon came with two entrees and two fresh juices. I ordered the vegan chicken salad wrap (vegan chicken salad made with almonds and cashews, julienned cabbage, pico de gallo, and cashew cream sauce) and my BF ordered the nachos grande (corn chips, vegan ""protein"" beef, vegan cheddar cheese, fresh pico de gallo and avocado).

The food was excellent!! Everything was very fresh and tasted great.

Full order of the Nachos Grande $11.95 - Excellent! We ordered it with the cashew nacho cheese. The full order was enough for two people.

Raw Chili Cheese Fries $11.95 - I did not care for the jicama that is used to replace the potatoes. Everything else tasted great on the dish. I just don't care for the texture of the jicama. They would have been great with real fries. If you like jicama, then you will enjoy the dish.

Mama Mia Lasagna $10.95 - Excellent! The ricotta cheese is replaced with a tofu ricotta. It has the vegan beef and mozzarella, along with fresh spinach in a sun-dried tomato marinara.

Asian Tacos $10.95 - Excellent! The tacos were served with the vegan beef, avocado, cabbage, vermicelli noodles, and sriracha, all wrapped in a tortilla. We ordered it with the field greens on the side.

I went to the container park with my family last week and I was craving a salad, so when I saw a vegan place I knew I had to try it. I ordered the Thai basil spring rolls and the coconut kale salad.
The spring rolls were good, fresh, and the sauce had a nice light kick of heat to it. But nothing exceptional.
BUT THE SALAD. Oh, glory hallelujah THAT SALAD!! First off, I ordered a HALF order and it was HUGE.

And I wish I lived in Vegas, I'd be there DAILY to get more of that salad. Thankfully I DO live close enough that I can run and grab one every couple of months, though! Yeay!

It's in ""Container Park"" this shopping center made up of shops all housed in shipping containers.  There's a giant flame throwing praying mantis sculpture as you walk into this hipster haven.  The Simply Pure restaurant is nestled amongst a bunch of cool little artsy/hipster shops and bars.  There's live music playing in the common area.  After looking at the promisingly large menu,  I ordered the vegan lasagna and chocolate cheesecake. Service was very nice. You can sit inside at a few tables or outside at a couple tables.  We waited about 15 minutes to get our food.  

This lasagna... OMG... this lasagna... it was soooo damn delicious that I made my friend bring me back on Saturday night to have it again.  I kid you not... I HAD to have this lasagna two nights in a row because it's incredible.  The portion is huge... and they do NOT skimp on the cashew cheese.  Decadent.  It came with a nice green salad too.   The chocolate cheesecake was yummy, it came with a berry sauce.    The second night I also tried some of the raw angel hair zucchini pasta my friend ordered. She ordered it with mushrooms and basil.  I was thinking ""hmm.. raw zucchini pasta... hmmm"" when she ordered it.  Yet, after trying it, honestly, I was shocked, because it's so healthy sounding and yet soooo tasty!

The crumble on them was really tasty but I prefer more Chilli spice on my fo-meat crumble. They gave me a choice between daiya or cashew nacho cheeze sauce. I chose cashew nacho cheeze sauce but they were definitely skimpy with their cheeze drizzle. I needed more cheeze and more spice on my nachos. They gave me a little extra salsa for my nachos the salsa was alright. M ordered the chixen salad wrap and on the side they put a big pile of chips but they didn't give him any salsa with his chips or anything so I thought that was sloppy. They could have been more generous with their sauces in general. M's wrap was pretty big he could barely finish. Tasted good. Also the avocado on my nachos was really tiny piece. let me be clear the wrap was big and there were a lot of chips on my nacho plate.

Simply Pure is a fresh, modern take on vegan food and less hippie dippie than most people think. A while back I tried her vegan lasagna at a startup event at The Innevation Center and most recently tried her sampler platter and I can say that Chef Stacey Dougan does vegan food well! 

I liked the lasagna and it was flavorful and better than expected. This was my first time having vegan lasagna and I would definitely order it again. 

The Ultimate Sampler Platter #3 was delish as well! It had a little bit of everything on the menu. 

I've had many of these items before, but some items (like the jicama chili cheese fries) were a first for me and may be a little out there for those new to vegan food. The sampler included: 

- Zucchini Pasta Trio -- spiraled zucchini - refreshing and flavorful. Loved it.

- Nachos Grande, Vegan Taco & Chicken Salad Lettuce Wrap were delish. These were my fave in the sampler.

- Jicama Chili Cheese Fries -- a little different, with the combination of refreshing jicama slices and chili cheese, but I enjoyed it. This may be an acquired taste for some, especially those new to vegan food. 

 All I can say is that I enjoyed it! Her dishes made my body feel good, physically. Felt less tired, felt more energized and nourished. (It was a Saturday with the family and I usually have Hawai'ian or ""junk-cheat day food."")

I'm looking forward to having the lasagna again and trying the juices, enchiladas, tacos, and of course, the desserts!",825Ol4rTvAZnUyFMke37jA,8,8,4,NTvWpSxWuSkiod9T3_Fn3g

It's a tiny restaurant in Container Park with about 10 seats inside. While this specific restaurant could improve a bit on their customer service (smiling more, being a little more talkative, speaking louder), their food was still affordable, tasty, healthy, and came out fairly quick. I swear, Vegan places have the nicest customers ever! Their customers who were dining there were so helpful and were very knowledgable about the type of food that they have. The other customers recommended the nachos and the lasagna. Unfortunately, they ran out of lasagna by the time we got there which was around 2pm on a Sunday. But the nachos were amazing and the full order is good enough for 2 people to share!

I got the Sampler #1, which comes with a Zucchini Pasta Trio, Nacho Grande, and the ""Chicken"" Salad Lettuce Wrap. At #13.95, this plate could feed two.  I'm not a fan of tomatoes or cheese (even vegan cheese), and they were very accommodating to my modified order requests. 

Everything was good, but the nachos were my favorite. The food was fresh and light, yet filling. It was the perfect lunch for a hot summer day.

5562363,2017-05-28,0,6TSpAuUdmo2UEn9emgd8xg,"Update 6/2/17: Thanks for taking the time to reply Stacy. Being someone that is vegan, gluten and soy-free I understand the challenges to eat out and cook this type of cuisine. And for that reason I didn't want to give less than a glowing review, but I was being honest and fair. My meal just missed the mark for me. As a  first time customer, I didn't know I had other choices instead of the beef. I mentioned my allergies when ordering. I would have been happy to strap on an apron and make myself some grilled mushrooms. 

As for the salad, there was no dressing on the side and I picked out wilted slimy lettuce (this happens - no foul.) Again, I would have asked about a dressing, but the cashier was short with other customers, as you mentioned, probably due to being busy and stressed. To me rude is not just telling someone to piss off, it's demeanor and body language. And in my opinion (aka, my review) that is what I sensed. 

On a high note, It's awesome you have options for vegetarians and vegans in Vegas, I just think some fine tuning could be beneficial. If I didn't have to avoid soy and wheat, I'm sure I would have enjoyed another menu item. No disrespect at all, just stating my opinion since I cook this type of food daily. 


Original review: Wanted to try this place while on vacation. Very small space and not much charm, which is fine especially if the food was amazing. I ordered the Asian lettuce wraps without fake beef and the side salad. The flavors were okay, but underwhelming. I could have made them at home for $2, but I paid $12. The salad was completely undressed, it was a pile of mixed greens. 

My husband had the pesto panini and really liked it, so I guess that is notable.

The cashier wasn't very friendly and I had to walk back to my hotel with sticky hands.",CUOuC-URpW__u5sY9QIVXQ,4,0,2,Sf-IVQnUzbWiOaLI0eNDFg

5741321,2015-08-07,4,6TSpAuUdmo2UEn9emgd8xg,"Simply Pure offers some of the best raw food I've ever eaten.

My husband and I came here on a Sunday afternoon to find something healthier to eat after  overindulging all weekend long -- a typical Vegas weekend full of rich food and too much to drink.  I had done a bit of searching online to find an interesting and unique restaurant to check out; Simply Pure definitely fit the bill.  Because we had our car with us, getting downtown from the Strip was easy and fast.  (Note: you'll have to pay to park when you visit Container Park.)  

Upon arrival at Container Park, we were both impressed at the lovely and vibrant space.  Simply Pure was easy to find once we consulted the map.  It's upstairs overlooking the green space.  We were a little disappointed to see that there was no indoor seating (we're spoiled SoCal people who have a 10 degree comfort range when it comes to temperature) which meant we would be sweating while eating, but no one else shopping seemed to mind the triple digit heat.  We placed our order and chose a table right outside the restaurant overlooking the lower level. It was cool to see that  you could buy alcoholic beverages at other places within Container Park and enjoy them throughout the park without problem -- next time.

We were drawn in by the nachos but then saw the combo plate for $16.99.  It included three kinds of raw zucchini pasta, nachos, and chicken salad.  I was still recovering from last night's buffet and didn't think I could eat much so we chose to share this plate.  That was a good move considering how incredibly filling the food was.  The zucchini pasta came with three different sauces:  a bright and fresh tomato sauce, a green pesto that was dark and hearty, and a creamy alfredo-type sauce.  My favorite was the tomato sauce, but the others were quite good in their own ways as well.  

The nachos were the bomb!  They're so freaking good that it's no surprise so many reviews mention them.  The crispy chips were covered with TVP (textured vegetable protein) meat and a creamy cheese sauce (both vegan obviously) and topped with avocado.  

Our last item was the chicken salad which I believe the guy said was made with nuts.  I haven't had such a delicious version of raw chicken salad before.  It was light, refreshing, and full of flavor.  Very unique and delicious!
