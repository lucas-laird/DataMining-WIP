I came here during a conference. I got the daily special $8.99 shrimp cocktail which had about 12-15 medium sized shrimp in a delicious tomato and avocado mix and some sort of sauce. I added the salsa to make it just perfect. Then I got the grilled langoustine. It was prepared with garlic and butter. On the sides, there was tomatoes and avocado. Both dishes were excellent. I plan on going again tomorrow.",xjOFSK8sMJ6QTrjvl403nQ,1,1,5,LShFqWrEYK_jA_pJRSZulw

The menu is impressive and the seafood selection is very good.  They also offer traditional Mexican dishes such as tostadas, burritos and such.  The ceviche looked great and they have a large selection.  I had the fish with garlic.  WOW!  the corn tortillas were fresh hand made and were absolutely delicious.  The fish was perfectly grilled and smothered with finely chopped garlic in a homemade sauce that was perfect.  The refried beans were also homemade and were very good as was the rice. I will definitely be back to this place.  This is my big find of the month!",22guc0RON4M9xJa0u0wdCQ,0,0,4,25qtSyaPesGqhG0qiFsCIA

They both were very good. My only complaint was that the young lady taking my order did not speak English very well at all. They really need to have someone taking your order that speaks very good English and Spanish. I went back the next night to eat again. The prices are excellent. You need to try it and they have free delivery. I do not know what their delivery area is.,eK7fMWKECo8N7oes04Ning,0,0,4,DyOi1E0pD9wZlPthxcEV_g
