19333,2014-11-13,1,1FAvxOUOGGyZoYNlAXACag,"I saw a deal on groupon for the Dal Toro exotic cars test drive experience and had some questions about this offer, so I decided to contact Dal Toro and ask them some questions before purchasing the groupon deal. I have been trying to get a hold of a live person with no success.

 They have one phone number for their restaurant, museum, and the test drive experience, which is frustrating. Their phone menu says to press 3 for the test drive experience, then press 1 if you would like to make a reservation, or press 2 if you have questions about the test drive experience. I pressed 1 to make a reservation and it directs me back to their website, then I get hung up on.
Then I call again and press 2 and their menu says ""system error, hang up and try again"" and I get hung up on!!

I have tried the restaurant and they direct me back to the same phone menu that I called before, I have also tried the museum and they direct me to the same phone menu that I called myself. So irritating!!!

After not being able to get a hold of anyone via phone, I sent in multiple inquiries using the form on their website. I completed the form and received a confirmation message stating that a representative will be contacting me shortly. That was 2 weeks ago and I still havent heard from anyone, and their phone system is crap, I cant get through to anyone.

I do not understand how you are still in business If you do not respond to people who are interested in doing business with you.

I'm glad I did not purchase the groupon deal, I will take my $185 somewhere else.

Do not waste your time with this company.",ruVwLL_rWv_s4d0ANPttPw,3,0,1,p_oDaOwA6GHJi4byNSmfig

70082,2011-07-06,0,1FAvxOUOGGyZoYNlAXACag,"You don't often find a great bargain on the strip. And we found one at Dal Toro: breakfast for $12.50 right next to Wynn where we were staying and right at the bottom of the equally fancy Palazzo Hotel. I was surprised when I read the reviews just now: I am glad that we did NOT Yelp this restaurant before we decided to give the breakfast deal a try. Otherwise we would have missed a gem, and now I feel compelled to write a review. Granted: we only had breakfast and we sat outside by the fountains. Somehow the air felt cool under the umbrella even though it was already near 100 degree before 11 am. Probably because of the sound of the moving water, it felt like a piece of tranquility right by the busy main thoroughfare in Vegas. We enjoyed our breakfast while people watching. It almost did not feel like Vegas. 

Another disclaimer: when we were there, we were the only diners (people don't get up before noon in Vegas right?) and sometimes that makes the world of difference in one's dining experiences. Now that we've got the disclaimer out of the way: Our waiter, Ruwel, was absolutely wonderful. My husband asked for substituting 2 of the 3 eggs for a few strips of bacon.  No problem. And the pieces of bacon were done just right - you know how awesome it is when your bacon is done just right. He asked for his potatoes to be crispier. Done. His potatoes were crispier than mine. I ordered the vegetarian omelette and I polished off the entire plate. The eggs for both dishes were done to perfection which for us did not come too often.  The coffee was great, and Ruwel kept the coffee filled and came back several times to deliver extra creme etc. This compared to the not so impressive service we had received from Verandah at Four Seasons the night before, my husband actually asked me to email the management at Dal Toro to let them know how much we appreciated the service and food we experienced this morning.",SAKlFQO8NhL2pPAfJK6rvg,0,0,4,f9q38pfLDCbYRUxvVzg_Nw

Since the food was over-priced and the serving sizes were skimpy, we never would have chosen to eat there without the $10 discount.

I ordered  a pizza, and the the cook ""forgot"" to put sauce or toppings on it.     There were six sliver-thin slices of zucchini, tomato and red pepper on the pizza crust - nothing else.

The omelettes are very good and their version of eggs benedict is unique and tasty. The pancakes and french toast were good, not great. The coffee is strong, which is a huge plus, and the OJ tasted like fresh squeezed. Service was adequate. The dining room is casual, with views of the Lamborghini shop/showroom and Top 40 music playing. Would this be my ideal breakfast destination? Not really - it pales in comparison to Bouchon (next door at the Venetian) and Terrace Pointe Cafe and Society Cafe (at neighboring Wynn and Encore, respectively).

When we were done, napkins on the table,  we waited another ten minutes for our server to come back, which is strange because he was having a conversation with his coworkers a few feet away from us at the bar. We both looked at him and made eye contact which he kind of just sneered and went back to his conversation.

I loved the atmosphere and decided to go back for dinner the food was delicious. I ordered the Spaghettini fra Diavola. The lobster was supberb it melted in my mouth. The brandi sauce had just the right amount of spice. I've also tried Filetto Roquefort the filet is juicy and was cooked to my liking (I am very picky about my steaks being medium rare.. many places make it to rare for me or not rare enough), again the spices were the perfect combination and with the potatoes and vegetables it was delicious. I paired this with a sweet white wine. The service has been great the few times I've been! The luxury cars were an added bonus ;) I only wish I could afford to buy one..haha.

339513,2010-01-16,5,1FAvxOUOGGyZoYNlAXACag,"I joined Yelp simply to write this review: On all levels, this was by far the most horrid meal I've ever experienced in Vegas.

SERVICE
From the non-staffed hostess stand to the 15 minute wait time to place our order, the service was sub-par at best. We had to talk a member of our party into not leaving out of frustration, but I really wish we'd taken his lead instead. Why? The food was just god-awful. It arrived within about 4 minutes of our ordering it (which raised some eyebrows) and came on platters best left for the Circus Circus Buffet elite. 

""FOOD""
I cannot even begin to comprehend why anyone would think Denny's-esque flank stank hiding under ill-prepared sauce with shards of potatoes on the side could even be considered ""food"". Cats eat better than this. I was half tempted to walk into the kitchen and smack the chef's forehead to see if there was anything going on up there. Who on earth said, ""Well, this is just fantastic -- it MUST go on our menu!"" to ANY of these dishes? A previous reviewer got it right when stating that the oil for the bread was the best thing on the table. At the end of my meal, I had two sizable piles of gristle on either side of my plate and was still left totally unsatisfied and slightly disgusted. Everyone in our party shared the same feelings.

ENTERTAINMENT
No, not the Lambos. The greatest, most entertaining part of this meal was the aftermath. We sat around at FIRST (much better) and engaged in a game called, ""The best thing about Dal Toro"" in which we took turns giving one reason we liked the meal. Highlights include:
-Our food came out expediently, cutting down the meal time
-The wine
-Got in a good workout trying to cut the steak
-The door was wide enough for all of us to exit quickly
-Our table had legs

If you're planning on going here, stay away. If anyone tries to tell you that this is anything better than compressed Fancy Feast, question their judgment and quietly remove them from your social circle.",zjIUk9kO2zimUayRpLBJYw,4,5,1,efzteN1dHtzu6Nojsc5_zw

The hostess was not at the bottom of the stairs, so we walked up stairs to find someone to help us.

We found a cook and told him we were with the wedding party. We were promptly seated at a table by a bus-boy. He told us the hostess had left early.

Then we realized that we were at the wrong wedding table. The waiter said ""oh, you must be with the 'other' wedding party and reseated us in the back.

The menu was awful. The top part was un readable. My 10 year old could have done a better job in MS Word. 

We were asked for our drink orders. I asked which beers they had. I was told they had coors light. I requested one. Shortly after, the waiter came back and said they were out of coors light due to a function at another part of the casino, but I could walk upstairs to get one if I wanted.

As we looked thru the menu, we noticed the prices were higher than the prices listing on their internet site. We asked the waiter and he just shrugged it off and said they had not updated the website.

I then attempted to oder the $52 Prime Rib. I was told my the waiter that the manager did not put in the order in time and that they were out of Prime Rib for the weekend. I then attempted to oder the $45 Veal, again, the waiter laughed and said they were out of that as well.

Amazing. A restaurant at a 5 star hotel and the two meals (the two most expensive meals on the menu) I wanted were not available at 5:15pm on a Saturday evening. Wow.

So far, the prices don't match their website, No Coors Light, No Prime Rib, No Veal. 

While we are ordering we tell the waiter that we were told about a 20% discount since we were all staying at the Palazzo Hotel. He confirmed that we would get the discount as long as we got out hotel receipt. One member of our party left the table to get the paper work.

Meanwhile the service was HORRIBLE !!! 

One of our parties entree's was ""forgotten about"" and was served well after the rest of the table. Very awkward as we all tried to wait while our food got cold.

Then the bus-boys and server insisted on grabbing our plates before we were done. I actually had to grab one of their hands and insist that they put my food back on the table so I could finish it. 

The silverware was very dirty and not replaced when they took it. 

The waiter refused to bring more bread to the table. I finally had to beg for more bread. 

Finally when the check came, we asked about the 20% discount for staying at the hotel. We were told it didn't apply to us. We asked for the manager.

The manager, who appeared to be drinking in an armpit-stained White ""Penguin"" polo shit came up and was very hostile. He refused to honor the 20% discount that his server agreed to. He told us that his employee was mistaken and it wasn't his fault.

Let's recap:

The 2 most expensive menu items were not available. According to the waiter, they ""forgot"" to order them.

The service was awful. The plates and silverware were disgusting.

The manager spent most of his time at the bar and not helping customers.

We did not get the 20% discount that we asked about before we ordered.

I really wish yelp gave the option of  giving 1/2 stars. . .  

And so with that opening sentence, here is my review:

A group of friends and I went to Dal Toro out of sheer desperation. It was a Saturday night and well, being Vegas, all the good restaurants were already booked. Now, I know that we could have gone to any restaurant but we were starving and that was the only place we could get. The restaurant is at The Palazzo and located in the lowest level of the hotel. It was actually really hard to find and feared that because we were late, our reservation had been canceled. No such thing. Upon finally arriving, we checked in with the hostess. While we waited to be seated, a bride and groom (it is Vegas after all) went up to the hostess and asked if they could accommodate a party of 23. They said they were willing to wait since it was a walk-in. The manager comes out and says that it will take about 15 minutes. Now, THAT should have been my first clue. Sadly, I thought nothing of it.

The hostess tells us that our table is ready, so we go in. Looking around, I didn't see that many people but again, didn't think twice about it. 

Our waiter comes to greet us and take our drink order. A few of us decide to get a bottle of wine while another one asked for a virgin daiquiri. The waiter tells her that they don't make frozen drinks there. So, she gets a Shirley Temple. Now, the wine selection was not that impressive and to be quite honest, they prices were a bit high.  

We get our drinks and now it's time to order.  2 get the Tuna Tartare, another on gets the Salad di Campo (which is just greens with yellow red pear tomatoes with lemon olive oil) and I get the Caesar salad. while waiting for the appetizers, we munched on the bread and this delicious pesto-type dip. The appetizers are here, yay! What a big let down. 

Let's start with the Tuna Tartare: the description said it was a spicy fresh tuna with a balsamic reduction and micro arugula. It was neither spicy nor fresh. The balsamic reduction was a drizzle on the plate, not even on the tuna. Oh and the micro arugula consisted of a sprinkle of little teeny-tiny leaves, so that was true to the description.

The salads were basic, nothing special about them.

Our waiter comes and asks how our food is. We tell him that the tuna does not taste fresh and it's pretty much a disgusting dish. He asks if we want the kitchen to make a new. Hmm, let me see. . . that would be a no! We asked for something completely different and off he went. The new appetizers were Crab Cakes and a Caprese salad. The salad was good, the crab cakes were not. We didn't say anything else because we feared that our food would get spit on.

The entrees come and we all look at each other not know what to expect and hoping to be pleasantly surprised. Sadly, that was not the case. We ordered the following: Veal Milanese, Prosciutto Pizza, Pasta with chicken and NY steak with a peppercorn brandy cream sauce.
*sigh*

The veal was crusted with  panko bread crumbs but it was so dry, cutting it was next to impossible.  Presentation wise, the pasta was a big mess but it was edible. The pizza was nice and crispy with a generous amount of prosciutto and an even more generous amount of arugula. Upon first impression, the steak looked good. However, when trying to cut it, it disappointed. I say ""trying"" because it was so tough, I had to struggle with it. It was then that I realized I was using a butter knife so I asked for a steak knife. I thought that would solve the cutting issue but again, that was not the case. I could not cut a piece for the life of me. I was arm wrestling it, no joke. The manager happened to stop by as I am doing that and asks how our food was. (I assume he heard about the tuna tartare) I tell him my steak is so tough I can't even cut it with the steak knife. So he asks if he can try to cut me a piece. Even HE struggled with it but played it off like I wasn't cutting it right. He then has the nerve to ask me what was wrong with. Really? He suggest maybe cooking it a little bit more (it was med-rare) and I tell him that that's not the problem. The problem was the big tendon-nerve running through the whole meat. I tell him that I don't want it and do not want anything else in its place. Boy was he mad! He took it and said nothing.

Not once, did he apologize or even PRETEND to feel bad for our experience. Quite frankly, we felt that we were the inconvenience and not the other way around. To be honest, we felt a bit disrespected for having spoken up. With so many restaurants and so many choices, one would think that they would go out of their way to make our dining experience a pleasant one. Our waiter never came back, that's how bad it was.

I hope that although a bit long, my review helps you in deciding whether to patronize this restaurant.",Sv3Iq5BMwPDpaxn5wL_a1Q,5,0,1,F__IdohhAvb8nbr3RU8E7A

Overall, the food was very good.  I had their special steak sirloin with mushrooms in a white wine sauce.  The caesar salad was just ok.  However, I would say the service was terrible.

759678,2014-10-19,0,1FAvxOUOGGyZoYNlAXACag,"Ferrari Drive Review - Heard about this thru Groupon, $99 for about a 10 min drive right off the strip. 2007 Ferrari F430 Spider (roadster/convertible), paddle shifters, mid engine V8 puts out about 480hp. Experience took about 30 mins start to finish (instructor taking car from Palazzo to driving route, driving instructions, own picture taking, driving) 

Driving route is about 5 mins from hotel and is about 3 miles long. First you pull out of a gas station on to a 6 lane highway and pull up to a red light. First thrill is the self initiated drag race at the drop of the green light. As you shift thru the first 3 gears, Angela(instructor) tries to yell over the throaty V8 to tell you when to shift and eventually coasting in 4th before a set of turns. After the turns you downshift to 3rd before entering a tunnel and then just blast thru the echo chamber which left me smiling ear to ear (second thrill). The F430 has a very distinct exotic car sound even tho it's equipped with a V8, a totally different exhaust note than that of an American muscle V8. After slowing down and making a few turns at lights, Angela had me come to a complete stop on a straightaway. The final thrill was zipping thru 4 gears from a dead stop before hitting afternoon traffic.

Overall the experience was a steal at $99 and didn't take half a day to complete. Angela was a super cool chick that made the experience enjoyable. The whole process was very informal (no liability waivers to go over, no additional insurance to pay for, no papers to sign). I would have loved to push the F430 to the limits and go faster but of course you can't do that on open roads. I'll definitely be back to do this when I'm in Vegas again.",_aTP9U-x4S431V1N7eQtrw,1,0,5,5QccS0HNMzErH-Lj7P2Mtw

Service was incredible! We were here the night of feb 28 2016 and the staff was just great! 

The food was excellent and just the right portion for two people who had a huge lunch. 

The location was so nice. We sat on the patio at night, so it was a great atmosphere with a view of the Vegas strip and fun people watching. 

Only a few reservations about this place, the first is how much they stress you need a reservation! We were the only people there! With how tricky it is to find the entrance, I feel stressing that reservations are a must isn't very appealing to people looking up Vegas restaurants online as they plan their vacations. 

My second is the music. It was a nice Italian restaurant with a good Italian atmosphere... Until you hear the top 40 music. Kinda takes you out of the mood. 

Finally, and this is what keeps me from leaving a 5 star review; forced gratuity. The service was amazing and I was going to leave a generous tip regardless, but I'm always annoyed when a business has the audacity to think they're entitled to a tip. This completely defeats the purpose of a tip and I find it just rude.

I ordered a 10oz filet minion cooked medium with a side of spinach. Cooked perfectly, so tender and tasty! The Toscano Chianti complimented the dinner perfectly.

The eggs were fine. So was the bacon. The roasted potatoes were super greasy. The pancakes were OK. The syrup was your standard restaurant syrup. There are two packets of margarine.

When I asked for butter the waiter told me ""No. We're out of butter."" 

The coffee is not great and $4.50.

My biggest complaint is the Menu which is one sided and the print is sooo small (less then 12 point font) I could not see it even with reading glasses.  Very annoying for anyone over 40.

The waiter Gianluca was somewhat apologetic (but not really).  He certainly didn't offer any suggestions.   My son ended up reading the menu choices to me.  The meat balls sfzione appetizer were absolutely delicious.  The wine overly pricey (as usual) but I recommend the Malbec from Argentina $18.- (for a glass) they called it a small carafe but the wine glasses are half the size as what I'm used to.

I have no problem paying that much for good tea that is steeped well, but I do have a problem when all it gets me is 2 tea bags, one of which is Lipton, and one cup of hot water. 

The food is average at best. I had their version of a bagel and lox, with cream cheese which didn't come with the advertised onion yet did come with advertised capers. (Both are usually included). I didn't even finish it because the salmon wasn't that great looking. 

The service was terrible. While our entrees were speedy, our water glasses were never filled and when my tea arrived at the table another server yelled ""that's not hers!""

I would come here for a few drinks and sit outside but the Venetian has many other options for food thats just so much better.  And just an FYI, this place seems to be somewhat suffering from business so there may be deals for this place online/through the casino, etc.

They seated us really quickly, but in a cold freakin' show room with fold out chairs and space heaters.  When the food came out they couldn't remember who ordered what and kept trying to give orders to the wrong people.  My friend didn't get his food at all, they just lost his order or something and the server didn't come around more than once after we ordered our food.  When we were finally able to flag down a waiter to tell him our friend didn't have food he was really nice about it.  But then the food didn't even come until everyone was done with their food already.  And that was only because we had to remind them AGAIN that he hadn't gotten his food yet.  AND THEN, IT WAS THE WRONG DISH!!!  We had to wait another 15 min or so before they finally brought out the right one.  The food was not very good and i wouldn't have eaten as much as I did if I wasn't starving already.  We wanted to pay the check and leave but no one would come to our table and finally the bartender from the other room came to help us.  When we finally got the check they didn't come to collect it for another 15 min!

This place was awful, I get better service at mcdonalds.  i gave the one star because the people were nice.  but they shouldn't be in customer service and the food wasn't the worst i've ever had, but it was still pretty terrible.",UrXkEK2YObxiMjNmuMO3NA,2,0,1,TLn5QaVQnEYhjRgN8djGjQ

I went here for a friend's birthday, and we were a party of 9, so I can understand some difficulty there, but our group has been used to fine dining establishments and knowing myself, I always try to save the waitstaff the stress of tending to a large party.

Believe me, I've waited on large parties before- our group wasn't difficult.  A couple with a baby is already difficult, but we are all adults here.

Let me skip over the decor because I should've regretted the moment that I entertained the thought of dining with cars next to me.  I don't care if they're Murcielagos- the service and the food was still horrendous.

Believe me, I wouldn't skip over the good parts if there were any but to tell you the truth, there were none.  Maybe the hostess- she was pretty.

But the food was nothing special.  I didn't get an appetizer because I didn't feel like it, so I got a dish with clams.  They were undercooked.  The server kept telling me they were cooked, and I told him to taste it because it was cold inside.  Just because they are open, according to popular belief, doesn't mean they are cooked.  That just means they're dead because the muscle holding it open isn't functioning anymore.

So then I ordered a fettuccine dish.  They came out with ravioli instead.  That was the second mistake they made on my dish.  My friends ordered a ravioli dish, and there was only 5 pieces.  Waste of money.

The servers and bussers were inattentive, and they seem to be all hired through friends and hook-ups.  This is alright- it makes sense to managers to hire people who they trust, but it seems that the staff has gotten too comfortable.

I didn't leave a tip- I never leave a tip at establishments where the staff or the chefs/cooks themselves make crucial mistakes.  Maybe it was just a bad evening there, considering there are quite a few good reviews on this place.

But anyways, I went to the giftshop upstairs after dinner and got myself a bottle of Fiji to flush down the salmonella-ridden pasta.. if you call it pasta.  Best $4 I spent that evening, even though it was on overpriced water.

Eat at Lavo instead- the food there is a tad better and there's actually well-trained servers there.",N1eblziJZ5N4OcO2HYWZFA,4,0,1,VXODGbBbfxn4ftlHDP62-w
2113033,2015-11-22,0,1FAvxOUOGGyZoYNlAXACag,"It was good enough. However, you are paying for decent Italian and a good view of The Strip. 

The food was okay. However, I was not supremely impressed. The food was along the lines of Carrabba's. The prices are approximately 50% more. Not a problem. 

The service was okay. It was not quite befitting the high tone the restaurant attempts to set. I have been in service. Sometimes your pattern is off, your customer wants something wholly unrelated to anything your can provide.... I don't believe this was the situation. We, husband and I, found the auxiliary wait staff was more accommodating.  The waiter was more of a sales person. After we stated we were using a Groupon, he was pretty done with us. We use Groupon to boost our buying power and try more things on an outing. We know to tip on the pre-discounted bill. 

The straw that broke the camel's back was the HSE. An extra 15% was tacked onto our bill. This would not have been a problem if we had been notified in advance. We agree that many people work very hard and don't get paid well. Rather than shock people at the end of their meal, include it in the cost. If you know that you cannot charge what needs to be charged to be fair to all parties, maybe your concept needs to be rethought.

Since we are locals, it is highly unlikely that we will return. We will let visiting friends know what they are getting into if they ask whether to go.

When we arrived at Dal Toro the hostess told us that they decided to close because the resturaunt was extremely slow that night.

A simple phone call letting us know they had to cancel would have been MORE than enough - and the fact that this establishment clearly did not care about their customers is absolutely disgusting. There were also still people eating there dinner while we were turned away. EXTREMELY UNPROFESSIONAL. We were all starving and exhausted and dal toro did nothing but ruin our night.

When they arrived at the restaurant, they allowed the kids to select where they wanted to sit & even though it was obviously going to be a no alcohol table, they gave them a lovely table on the patio.  Muero was their waiter & he took special care of them. 

They all said the food was very good & they would love to go back anytime. The restaurant was very kind about their budget and offered to give them desperate checks, which usually is frowned upon by restaurants with large groups.

Yea, they just threw the same steak on the grill and brought it back to her, with a disaster presentation. She had a few bites and it wasn't good at all so she just left it and they didn't care.

Finally the bill came, my chicken was still on the bill, so I decided to take it to the manager I was done dealing with a server that was in lala land. The manager took him the bill and asked him to remove the chicken and bring us a new bill. The server that was so polite when we first sat down was no longer polite but very rude and irate.

That should have been a clue.

Nothing had any flavor.  I don't mean it wasn't spiced properly (although it wasn't), but the food itself didn't have flavor.  Lobster has a flavor, tomatoes have flavor.  Each of the ingredients in Minestrone have their own flavors.  Unfortunately, that's not the case at Dal Toro.  What they claimed was fresh lobster tasted like it had been frozen for quite some time...zero flavor.  And the soup was so bland, I think we've had better out of a can.

Upon inquiring about the freshness of the lobster dish, the waiter quickly took my plate away and said that he would take it off the bill.  It was almost like he knew it was bad.

And please don't get me started on the ""service charge"".  Others have mentioned it, but let's just say that with the service we got (not asking how our meal was while we're were eating, etc.), the 20% they forced us to tip was all we were giving.

The manager did come over (not at our request). She was very nice and gave us a discount on a future visit.

After walking (literally) the entire inside of the Palazzo and Venetian, we went outside and gushed over Dal Toro. We were very guilty having wanting a table 15 minutes before closing, but what can you do? We shyly walked towards the hostess, and she gladly found us a table.

How bout some secret sauce or a pickle? Why just one thin piece of lettuce. This burger was AWFUL. Not even a couple french fries (those were extra).

I will start off by saying the prices weren't as bad as I thought considering the theme so I wasn't terribly upset I was just very dissapointed.

Her partner asked for an orange juice but of course- they were out of that as well. The menu stated you could order a side of sausage links however when the side arrived they were (most likely) frozen sausage pattys.

We were staying at The Palazzo and were looking for a place to eat breakfast that offered more than just pastries, but for less than $30 per person.

We were super excited to find Dal Toro, which offers a fairly reasonable breakfast menu.  My favorite was the breakfast special for $9.99.  

Sit on the patio - it's some great people watching.  From the early morning tourists to the people that look like they're still up from the night before.  It's nice an cozy and there's a little fountain area surrounding the patio where ducks like to take their morning bath :)

We had been dayclubbing and then took our sweet girl time getting ready, so needless to say, we were losing our buzz and realizing that our bellies needed some cushion before we started to booze again (we're classy that way). We headed out of the hotel elevators and then the hunger REALLY hit. Wandering towards the exit, we realized that traveling elsewhere might result in eating our own arms off... and what was (unfortunately) located near the exit? Dal Toro.
I do have to say, being seated outside on that warm evening was very enjoyable. Also, our server was very much on it. Our water glasses were always full and he made sure we had PLENTY of bread to start. The actual dishes, however, left a LOT to be desired (including more food afterward, as I didn't even eat a quarter of what I ordered). Seriously though, HOW do you mess up cappelini??

There was a large group of us so we thought it'd be great to buy a discount at the ""half price"" ticket booth for shows and dinners. Well, it was not quite half price (25% off purchased at $3 pp), but we figured that still shaves off some $$ (at least service) from the total bill. 

The prices were not crazy, about $20 for pasta and $40 for steak. We were hopeful.

The service was not bad; wish I could say the same about the food!! We had caprese salads and Kobe beef carpaccio as appetizers, and pasta as the main. Ack ack ack. They were actually really bad to the point where I wished we ate at Outback, and I'm not a fan of restaurant chains. 

What was so bad you ask? To sum it up, flavorless. There are supposed to be explosions of fresh herbs and cheeses when you taste Italian food! The sauce on my pasta was just salty, but there was no distinct flavors. The chicken was so overcooked that I felt like I was chewing already-been-chewed jerky, you know, the meat left over that you've been chewing for hours but you still can't get it to a swallowable texture. I could do better with a box of penne and a bottle of Ragu at home. 

The girl that helped us pick out this restaurant beamed that this was an excellent choice and that there are beautiful cars to look at while eating. We thought this place would be classy.

3239451,2009-06-22,0,1FAvxOUOGGyZoYNlAXACag,"This is my first Yelp review so I'm kind of excited!

After a long night of partying it up at one of the premier clubs in Vegas, Tryst, me and my group of friends woke up quite early to catch the dreaded morning after meal. We were staying at the Wynn and were actually headed to Denny's for some greasy-bad-for-you food, but actually noticed a sign that said $12.50 Breakfast special in front of Dal Toro. Since Denny's was a long ways to go, and the price seemed pretty decent, we went for this fancy looking Lamborghini-based restaurant that was conveniently located right next door to our hotel. 

The interior of Dal Toro was clean, sleek and lustrous and our group of 11 were seated at a long dining table, reminiscent of ""The Last Supper"" and complete with wine glasses that were later slowly refilled over and over again with water to quench our dehydration from the mass amounts of alcohol consumption the night before. Due to our thirst for water, Dal Toro's waiters were definitely not coming around as often to wait our needs. The restaurant was about less than half filled with customers and yet, the service was slow; not good especially when we were all starving and thirsty!! Nonetheless, they were still friendly, whenever they did come around just overall verrrry slow with: refilling our drinks, serving food, and the check that felt like it took longer to get than our food. 

Food: I ordered the Eggs Benedict that was decently portioned consisting of the usual English muffin topped with ham, poached eggs, and hollandaise and complete with a side of potatoes. It was pretty good except that I would ask for hollandaise on the side because that became a bit much and overpowering as the taste got to me towards the end of my meal. The potatoes, however, were delicious and really tasted like french fries except in a round form! My boyfriend ordered the cheese and ham omelet that came with toast and potatoes as well. This omelet as well as the other omelets on the menu, had the cheese and ham tucked nicely into the inside of the folded egg, instead of it being mixed into the egg (if that makes sense). Though it was different from the usual omelet, he was still satisfied with his meal, although I was expecting it to look like a fancy omelet for some reason, considering the kind of restaurant it was for brunch. 

Dal Toro deserves 3 stars for 3 reasons: 1. though everyone that worked there were nice, they were like the speed of a turtle with their service and it was hard to get their attention even though the place was not packed--slow for a group of 11 that were hungover, hungry, and dehydrated! 2. the food was good, but nothing too different that stood out to me from the normal breakfast meals, except the potatoes that were yum! 3. it was decently price, from $10-$15 for a decently portioned meal.

Hmm... maybe Denny's would have been worth the walk?",kTf9SuxJU5p0LSv4Pt_9Bg,2,0,3,XD6e9rZKIAtTz8qspGl4nA

The food was okay. Nothing bad, nothing great. 

Someone sent me a Groupon for the place so I went. 

However, upon arrival I was seated next to a very obviously homeless man who kept staring at me. And I mean RIGHT NEXT TO HIM. The restaurant wasn't busy at all so I don't know why they sat my friend and I right next to him.

He stunk to high heavens and would NOT stop staring at my friend and I; to the point that the manager came over and told him if he didn't stop bothering my us, he would have to leave. Which was sort of nice but I didn't understand why he was in the restaurant in the first place. 

Turns out, he was absolutely homeless because after finishing his soup he ran out of the restaurant without paying. After that everything was in a shambles. The entire staff was worried about running after this man who had skipped out on paying (including my server) so I sat around waiting for the side of marinara I had requested 15 minutes prior. 

My calamari was cold by the time I received my side of marinara sauce. 

Plus the restaurant is basically part of the Corvette store which I thought was weird. Why would an Italian restaurant be attached to an American car store? Or any car store for that matter?

It's safe to say I would not come here again.",Xde3UEeqDU281Db-3NAxFA,3,0,2,7Uc4hCa-NV1UgxcMoSAnFQ

Me and my roomie came here last night and had a pretty good dinner.

I had the Ravioli and he had the Penne.

The pasta was undercooked however we were informed of it prior to ordering as that's how the chef likes to prepare his pasta, a little chewy and not soggy. 

The sauce's were tasty, not amazing but the service was spot on and here's the best part.

Take 2 dude's, throw them in Vegas in a restaurant and what could they possibly want more than nice looking girls, nice looking CARS.

The restaurant is surrounded in glass by Lamborghini Las Vegas' showroom, so....while dining on your pasta you can make an offer on that '08 black on black Gallardo sitting 10 feet from you....

Too bad they wanted 260K, I woulda actually played a little hard ball but then again, if I did, I would have been eating Ramen noodles for life!! 

Word to the wise, if your wallet is deep and you're feeling no pain, this is NOT a good idea as you WILL make some bad decisions. :)",c9-jEIfBnLa4iNHxVmXAHA,0,0,3,6gdogigAVxImJ3KxdMgu6Q

The manager came and asked how our meal was and if we wanted to sit outside in patio instead of bar. He told us how great the view was and really recommended for such a nice night.

3374276,2014-11-11,1,1FAvxOUOGGyZoYNlAXACag,"Went here for breakfast our first morning in town.  With the 3 hour time change from home we were up and ready to go around 7 am.  We had a hard time finding a breakfast place open that early but we passed a sign advertising $9.99 breakfast specials - 2 eggs, 2 pancakes, 2 sausages and potatoes.  We decided to give it a shot.

We went through the outside entrance and it took about 20 minutes to be seated.  We assumed it was busy because the outside seating area looked just about full, but when we were brought to our seats inside we saw that it was completely empty.  So why the 20 minute wait?

It took our waitress another 20 minutes to come over and get our drink order, and another 10 minutes to get a glass of chocolate milk and water.  We finally placed our order.  We both ordered the breakfast special.  After another 30 minutes of waiting we were really getting fed up.  Coming from NJ we eat these kind of meals all the time at diners and they take on average about 10 minutes to make and bring out.  It should NEVER take 30 minutes to cook eggs and pancakes.

The food overall was good, but by that time I would've eat dirt off the floor I was so hungry.  How can you really mess up eggs and pancakes anyway?  The potatoes were awful- they were hard as rocks and completely flavorless but that just left more room for the pancakes in our empty bellies.

After we were done and they took our plates away we waited yet about 20 minutes for our waitress to walk back past us.  For 20 minutes she didn't even walk in our general direction! We flagged her down and asked for the check.  I watched her walk over to the cash register and print out our check, put it in her pocket and walk back to the kitchen for another 10 minutes.  She came out of the kitchen empty handed and walked over and gave us our check.  By this point we were overly aggravated.  I would never return solely based on the awful service.",Iy-NYLMmvGNPdLqUNEZihA,0,0,2,0uhevcS-hL-ral802yhY2w

I decided to try out this place out since we would be able to sit on the patio area overlooking the Las Vegas Strip.  When we walked in no one was there to greet us however the manager or host on duty seemed to be speaking to a server.  No hi or I'll be right with you.  Okay, that's fine-we waited patiently until they figured out what was going on.  

When we were finally seated, we asked the host (who was dressed in shorts) if we could sit on an empty table closer to the strip and she said NO because the server has a lot of tables and asked not to sit anyone in her section.  Okay- not enjoying my experience so far.  After about 5 minutes, someone sat on that very table we wanted.  WOW!  Okay... 

At this point I was a little upset but I continued to order my food. 
I had the New York Steak with eggs.  I asked for my eggs to be cooked extra well done, burn, hard and smash it.  The server looked at me and said okay.  So perfect, she got the point.  When I got my food the steak was really good and tasty.  My eggs however  was not cooked at all as I asked.  Instead, it was runny and wet.  Not to my liking at all.

The waiter was friendly enough but the food wasn't really to my liking. The arugula salad tasted like it was just dressed in olive oil and nothing else. Had to add salt and pepper to everything and I'm never the type to do that. I usually never lay a hand on the salt and pepper shakers at restaurants. The salad didn't have any sort of vinegar mixed with the oil and there wasn't any cracked pepper or seasoning. Definitely not worth it. 

The sides of green beans and mashed potatoes were also equally as bland. Again we added salt and pepper to both. I did like the seafood scampi but did think it was weird that the crab pieces were still in the shell. My hubby's steak was descent but $160 later I felt like we didn't have a good meal. Plus the waiter didn't even tell us what the house charge was until we asked. Then he explained that 15% goes to the servers and 5% to the house. If we didn't ask, we wouldn't have known.

Food: it was fine. Got the salmon omelet but the potatoes that came with it was good. But I could had made it myself... Maybe better because id put more spices.

Decor: I did love the sink in the bathroom... Yes took a photo ofit cuz it was cool to me haha. But the decor was car theme-ish with the logos but then you see odd paint art.

Service: bad. She was snooty to us since the gratuity is kinda forced on us anyways... I was tempted to complain but my friend said just review it and never go there... So... Here it is.

Bartender was dingy and had to ask my hubby three times what he ordered (seems to be the common Vegas thread lately, bartenders with lots of makeup, big hair and big boobs, tight clothes and major attitude)....Almost $30 for two cocktails that were not even that good/ The restaurant was 80% empty when we got sat and hostess tried to seat us right next to this other couple in a tiny table with about a foot between the two tables, roller her eyes when we asked if we could have a larger table somewhere else?

I made a quick trek across the bridge on Sands blvd from the Wynn and to the Palazzo to get my munchies on.  The decor at this place is definitely stylish. You can't beat the bull infront of the restaurant. It definitely keeps up with the 5 star Palazzo appeal.  Not to mention theres a Lamborghini store right next to the restaurant. All the cars were covered up, and the area was closed off. I guess you have to pay to see or take pictures of those sweet rides.

I ordered a Salmon pizza which came with cream cheese, olives and onions. This was the first time I ever had fish on my pizza, but it tasted wonderful. It wasn't a deep dish, but more of a light and thin cracker style crushed. The food was delicious and I was even more delightful to see the bill at $22. This is not bad for a place where I got a strip view and a free pirate show at the TI across from this place.

Definitely ask for the outdoor seating when you visit the Dal Toro!

Came here on a Groupon, didn't have high expectations after reading the reviews, which are spot on.  We started out with the calamari that was average, nothing special and then we shared Prosciutto e Tarufo pizza, this pizza was probably one of the worst pizzas I've had. I never let a pizza slice go uneaten, but in this case, we let almost the entire pizza go uneaten. The prosciutto tasted old and the combo of mushrooms and the truffle oil, they were both fighting to take the title of strong flavor. The drink menu was less than desirable as well. I tried the mojito on the recommendation of of our server, it was way too artificial tasting.

In the end, this was way overpriced and underwhelming food. Only thing this place has going for them is their outside patio that faces LV Blvd.

Service: is extremely slow for a NOT busy Sat night. The front desk person was rude (short / dark hair lady); we apologized for the changes of total party; she looked away and being ignorance. She gave us the same attitude when we said ""thank you"" for her helps (3 times) . She also made us waited while she was busy talking to other gal and blamed that the server is not ready when we asked if our table was ready. 
The restaurant was emptied when we walked inside and servers were sitting/ standing around ( and the receptionist said server was not ready). It took them 30mins+ for our food. 

Food: only -1 star for the food. I have never try any Italian food that taste salty as this one. We ordered special pasta, seafood pasta, seared salmon, steaks and salad. 
-Salad dressing smell like rotten food. 
-Special pasta looked like they just throw everything on it then topped w cheese then in the oven and on the table. 
- seafood pasta tasteless and seafood wasn't fresh
- the salmon was salty and the sauce came with it was weird and sour. The only thing I was good was the grilled potato that came with the order. 
- steak was so dried : we order well done but never expected to be completely dried like that . We had steak and ordered well done before but never expected a dried play-dough on a plate at this restaurant.

We had to ask another server to help us. He was not friendly at all, and we witnessed the table next to us go through essentially the same experience. 

Another downfall other than service was the fact that there were birds all over the tables eating the food people left behind because they were not bussing the tables fast enough.

Once we were seated we got our water glasses filled quickly but did not see a server for 15 minutes for even a drink order. I found this to be odd as the place was not busy at all.

When served the appetizer, we ordered entrees. We were forced to order something every time the server came over, being  that we barely saw the guy. We all ate and we were satisfied with our food.

We realized that every server outside had a couple tables inside, which made NO sense. Call me crazy, but why wouldn't you have a server devoted to inside tables and other servers devoted to tables outside.

How much time are you really saving and then freshness is seriously compromised! I settled for the salmon and shrimp omelet... how bad could that be? Uh B A D !!! My husband got old reliable, eggs benedict. Well both plates were disgusting. My omelet was super fishy the shrimp was obviously frozen. The potatoes that joined each of our entrees were soggy and swimming in oil. To make things worse it was cold... blah! I took a few bites and left the rest. It was inedible. My hubby's eggs benedict came with very little hollendaise sauce. The sauce was white not yell. The eggs were not runny. They were cooked all the way through and was also cold.

When we did get a table they sat my wife and I at a large table right in front of the patio door which was pretty much open most of the time letting in 30 degrees temp.   Table was not cleaned nor set.  Wife ordered wine which had to have been very old and open weeks ago.  Service was very slow but when they did show up wanted to make it very rushed.  Music was playing so load I could not hear my wife talk.  I could hear and see alot of other guest complaining to the manager who was clueless.  I could have lived with all that until the food came.  It was COLD (all of it), and of very poor quality!  Honestly Dennys would have been much much better for a fraction of the cost!

Went to their patio to watch the fireworks and realized it was already packed solid! Nobody could move and it was full of very drunk younger guys who were pushing and yelling, grabbing other women.

Service charge? Really? That's a 1. 

Thanks for letting us know only once the meal was over....They told me this charge is on their menu. It was at the bottom and in tiny font. But anyone would assume it was a lame mandatory tip, not a *SECOND* Tip, no reason question at that point you know?

So I guess that averages to a 2.

They call is an HSE charge but they could not tell us what it stood for. If you google it, guess what restaurant comes up!?!? Dal Taro (and restaurants in India)! There are a lot of unhappy customers even outside of Yelp it seems. Apparently it's not legal from what I read....Eventually I found out it stands for ""home service charge."" Wait, that's HSC not HSM and what does my home have to do with it lol. I think it truly means ""HOLIDAY SUPPORT FOR EXECUTIVES"" Hahah.

It's listed as a 2 dollar sign here, but really it should be 3 once you add in the 20% price hike. 

I thought it was for us to decide the tip based on level of service? Apparently they decide it for you by putting a 20% automatic fee to your total bill. Bear in mind we were only 2 people so this wasn't the automatic 6+ or 8+ people tip. *****There is still a place for the tip on one receipt to write in the tip, and on the other receipt there is a place for the automatic service charge. They separated them out so a person can easily assume it's the same but it's not, thus you could easily leave a tip when they already took it out.*****

We asked if it was a tip and we were told no. *****So they expect you to add a tip ON TOP of that 20% service charge.***** If not a tip, then what service are you providing exactly that no other restaurant on the strip offers for this mandated 20% I ask. ""Well....ummm....the neighboring restaurant charges it too!"" they said. It feels like their trying to recoup any loss from their Groupon customers.... and charge extra for everyone as well. Wrong on both.

We requested a refund of the HSC fee being we had already left a generous cash tip before realizing this robbery, but they said no. Eventually they said they would but it never happened. My friend worried the owner was from the Mafia as well as the group that surrounded the table, hovering, swarming, talking really loud, all of them standing around us while we were seated trying to eat.... weird! I laughed at the idea of the Mafia comment at first, but you never know.... I will say, it was not a relaxing scene.... believe me.",Rc5Hhdh985HTWGNyF20vVQ,12,3,2,7t1Px29pQaCzpt_RI1G9vQ

We noticed at the bottom of the menu in small font it says that 20% gratuity is automatically added to your bill. When we got the bill there was a ""HSE"" fee, we assumed that was the 20% gratuity and thus did not tip more than what was already apart of the bill. As if the ""HSE"" fee wasn't annoying enough, the first print off our bill said it was $10 so we paid what we needed past the $60 then when we got the change back the receipt said the HSE fee was $12. The first bill ticket said the total was $71 so we gave the Groupon worth $60 plus $20 in cash.

I wouldn't have minded, but my dad is more of a traditional breakfast kind of guy. Oh well, I figured Dal Toro would be just as good, right? Wrong.

My halfhearted latte wasn't hot enough, and it came in a basic coffee mug. Disappointing.

I ended up ordering the Shrimp Omelet, which the menu describes as shrimp, avocado, smoked salmon, and feta. It sounded tasty enough, though somehow lacked any real flavor. I was hoping the avocado would be inside the omelet, but no such luck. Unless you manage to get a forkful of feta in each bite, this omelet is pretty bland. I suppose it was ok enough for breakfast, but not overly satisfying.

Our waitress wasn't just too friendly either. She only checked on us once the whole time. Multitasking clearly is not her forte.

4344061,2015-07-16,0,1FAvxOUOGGyZoYNlAXACag,"The only problem with this place is one of the hostesses and the servers. The food is absolutely wonderful. The kitchen and the one busser seem to be the only ones on point here. 

Was staying at the Palazzo and didn't discover this place until 2 days before I left. Being vegan I actually have a lot of options in Vegas, and had many fabulous meals during my stay. However, I was with my mom and son, and nearing the end of our trip didn't feel like venturing far for a good vegan meal. I found out that Dal Toro had a vegan menu and was game to go. Made completely unnecessary reservations as there was only handful of people on a Friday night, however, being Vegas and having so much competition, I never judge a restaurant there by how busy/slow it is. Anyways, hostess on the Friday night was nice, she let me put my umbrella stroller under the stairs so i didn't have to collapse it. She got me a high chair and seated us outside, right beside the water/fountain. The atmosphere was lovely. 

And then we waited... and waited... finally a busser came with some water and bread. Again, food is awesome here, the bread with olive oil/garlic/basil was so delicious. Finally I got the servers attention and had to ask for the vegan menu. We ordered the Minestrone, the Eggplant Carpaccio, the Capellini Al Pomodoro, and the Avocado Pesto Linguine to share. Every single dish was perfectly executed and to die for. Especially the Avocado Pesto Linguine, which I've already committed to attempting to make at home. It was epic!!!!

And then we waited... and waited... and waited... and waited and finally got the bill. I left a 15% tip even though it killed me to do so. Being a former bartender/server I never tip less 20% even for bad service, but this was so bad, so slow, and there weren't even busy. There was zero reason for so much lag. And we could see our server just chilling and walking around nonchalantly. So frustrating!!!!! Also, on the way out, we left via the street, and the hostess out there was offering a special, a free app with two entrees. I ordered two apps and two entrees and paid for both. Really disappointed that the server failed to mention this but it doesn't surprise me. If I was really a miser I would've gone back and complained. But I let it go.

So, here's where it gets crazy. Last night there we decide again that we would rather do the strip then trek around for food. We had planned on hitting up Wynn/Encore because every restaurant has a vegan menu and they are pure perfection, honestly I know self-proclaimed carnivores who dine off the vegan menu at the Wynn/Encore. But the food was soooooo good at Dal Toro and in our hotel we said, let's just do it, we're going for the food not the service. It's a Saturday night but we risk not making reservations, seeing as they're open until 11 and it was 9:30 when we headed down. When we got there the look from the hostess (different from the night before) could've turned us to steel. I asked if we could have a table for 3. She said the kitchen was closing soon, and I was like your site says 11pm. She was tongue-tied and tried to make up some more excuses. So I was like fine we'll take it to go and wait inside. She then changed her tune and said she would see what she could do. We walk in and there are no more than 4 tables, and 5 minutes after she seats us a group of guys walks in and hug the shitty server we had the night before. Right then and there I was like this place is a joke. But we honestly enjoyed our food that much and it was already late so we sucked it up. We got another nice table by the fountain. I grabbed our server asap (same guy as night before :( ). Ordered everything we wanted no fuss, no muss. Busser brought the food out (should've tipped him directly; worked harder than anyone else there). Again, food was AMAZING, absolutely incredible!!!!!. And then waited... and waited... and waited for the bill again. Went to tip 15%, and then thought to myself, eff that, a tip is something you get for good service, hell even for mediocre service, because it's so ingrained that not tipping is a faux pas. But honestly, I didn't care and changed it to 10% which was still overtipping in this case. 

I doubt they'll learn their lesson and will probably lose their chef/kitchen staff before any real change occurs. That chef is wasting his talent there. And Palazzo should come down on them as well seeing as paying guests are paying to eat there.",Jjun2wgAOsxNN4qSvYk5LA,4,0,2,SYSyXy-S7GvLKWJBLQF4GA

I had to flag the manager down for a refill on my coffee.  Even the manager looked as if she was in a bad mood.  As far as the food, I asked for my eggs scrambled with cheddar cheese and tomatoes.  The tomatoes came out uncooked and on the side, I'm guessing because the server forgot to put them in.  This was by far the WORST dining experience in my life.  As a server, I know how to tip, I normally tip VERY WELL, however I left RODRIGO $5 on a $42 check because my 10 year old daughter could have probably done a better job than him....or the manager for that matter.

We were assured there would be plenty of meat and veggie options.  There weren't -- instead, a few olives, lots of fried calamari, some cured meats... and a bill for $60.  Not worth it.

Our meals -- bleh.  We hadn't eaten for 10 hours before we sat down for dinner, so we ate what we would normally send back. One of our meals was stone cold -- and it was a pasta in a rich sauce, which resembled congealed pudding.  It had to go back.  When it came back out, it wasn't much better, but the sauce was not congealed.

For this meal for 3, including 2 drinks each, no dessert, and no salad, we paid $300.   It took forever to get drinks, and no one filled our water without asking.  The server was very friendly, but that didn't help make the meal less disappointing.

We went there on a Groupon after taking the kid to the strip and playing tourist.

I know when a server see's 4 kids and 2 adults in their section they sometimes aren't so happy.

While I have not had everything on the menu, I've enjoyed everything I have tried, and have several suggestions on what to get.  My favorite dish on the menu is the Proscuitto and Truffle Pizza, which is fresh mozzarella, shaved parmesan, fresh arugula, and white truffle oil on a thin crust pizza.  The waiter, named Byron, suggested this dish and was very glad he did!  He also suggested the Branzino (Sea Bass) and the Tortiglioni Rustici.  The branzino was cooked perfectly, and served with a white wine, lemon, olive, caper, and tomato sauce.  The tortiglioni was the best pasta I've had at Dal Toro, and is served in a cream sauce with bacon, chicken, mushrooms, cheese, and thyme.  Awesome dishes!

I have also had several of their steaks, so if you're looking for a steak I would highly suggest the Ribeye.  It's a very large bone-in grilled Ribeye, another one of the best things on the menu!

5033871,2012-07-11,0,1FAvxOUOGGyZoYNlAXACag,"I've been to Dal Toro several times and have had the opportunity to try breakfast, lunch and dinner over the course of my visits.

The breakfast is quite solid, but not extraordinary. The breakfast menu is limited but covers most, if not all, bases. I've ordered the shrimp omelette more than once and it is huge (I cannot finish it). It is filled with salmon, shrimp and feta cheese (!) and comes with a nice slice of avocado on the side. This enormous plate of yum comes with potatoes and a slice of toasted brioche. Cappuccino is pricey (I think $4), but very good.

For lunch, I've ordered the Fra Diavolo pizza from the ""Specials"" menu. I thoroughly enjoyed it; thin crust, loaded with Andouille sausage and other goodies. It is enough to share (or take leftovers to eat by yourself!) and reasonably priced for a strip restaurant!

Most recently, I had the pleasure of experiencing a nice dinner at Dal Toro. This was the first time I've ever sat inside the restaurant - I normally love to dine on the patio, but it's just too hot for me now! I liked it; it was a nice atmosphere for an intimate dinner for two. I ordered a fettucini from the specials. I cannot recall the rather involved-sounding Italian name of the dish, but it was basically fettucini with cream sauce topped with mushrooms and chopped Italian sausage. It was delicious and I wish I had been able to finish it all! The portions are good-sized for a normal eater, I suppose. I've certainly never left there hungry, but YMMV. My husband ordered a salmon dish, served with string beans and roasted potatoes. I didn't try it, but he said it was excellent. It sure looked good. The bread (served with an olive oil pesto) was fresh and replenished as needed.

Dal Toro has a pretty neat little menu of specialty cocktails. I always mean to try something new, but keep going back to that darn White Chocolate Raspberry Martini. Get one! Or three, whatever. Two usually does me just right! I believe all the drinks from the speciality bar menu were $12 per - yeah, that's a lot, but at least they'll give me Grey Goose in my WCRM.

Finally, the desserts! They do a decent Tiramisu. Certainly not my favorite ever, but middle-of-the-road and a safe bet. I've also tried the Tartuffo ice cream and it was delicious.

The bottom line - can get very pricey, but usually worth it. Dinner for two, using a 25% Facebook promo still set me back a Franklin. I think it's a pretty good representation of a typical ""casual"" strip spot, pricewise. I've only had good service and food here, so I would return (and have!).

Then I used the restaurants website to make a reservation. Today at 11am, I made the reservation for 5:15pm but didn't get a confirmation email until 4:00pm? So I just cancelled it.

I ordered the lobster rissoto which had a little bit of a fishey smell for $40! Totally not worth it... my fiance ordered the filet mignon which was cooked pretty tender but the cheese sauce they poured on it made it taste like it was spoiled meat! Yuck! Also dont get the Diablo mojito because it was not very tasty at all. Tasted like nothing but alcohol with a hint of cucumbers...

The service.. oh my gosh, I dont even want to go there... it was horrible... It took 30 mins just to flag down a waiter and get a refill! All in all, I would definitely not go here again or recommend it to anyone for dinner.

I think the only highlight of the restaurant was the Kobe carpaccio for appetizer and the ambiance of sitting in the patio outside was a bit romantic. ..

Another plus is that breakfast is served until 11:30 am. The ambiance was quite nice, with a nice fountain separating the patio from the strip, and service was prompt. I had the vegetable omelette served with potatoes and a piece of toast with jam and butter - all very delicious. I ended up not getting the special because it was basically just 3 plain eggs and coffee or juice (you can add toppings for $1.50 each). My husband got the eggs benedict, which also came with potatoes, and a coffee.  All of the breakfast options were affordable (about $11), which for a sit-down breakfast is not bad considering the Disneyworld pricing on the strip.

My husband had purchased a Groupon some time ago so we thought we would use it for Valentine's Day. The service was atrocious! There was confusion over who was responsible for our table so it took considerable time before our drink orders were taken. The food was ok, but the servers had a really hard time handling even the basic responsibilities. Our water glasses were always empty. The most shocking thing is that NO ONE would clear our plates before the next course came. The waiter was setting down our food with old dirty plates still on the table. This happened again when they brought our entree. The only time anyone checked on us was when they were bringing food. To top it off, the restaurant automatically adds 20% tip on the bill!! We were extremely disappointed and requested to speak to the manager on our way out. She was rather dismissive and asked us if we knew what tonight was. We both looked at her dumbfounded and she said it's a holiday and are one of the only restaurants that accept Groupon that night and it's just busy.

My whole group of friends loves it; it is a highlight of our visit - frequently the place where our group plans our first reunion meetings after everyone's flights land.

The staff is exceedingly helpful and friendly.  Whenever anyone has a problem, they've rushed to make it right -- we are a bunch of middle aged broads, not high rollers.  The last visit they seated us inside but immediately relocated us to their gorgeous outdoor seating upon our request. 

Anyway, if you go be sure to try any of the pastas.  They are always perfect and off the chain good.  The sauces are delicious and there's never too, little nor too much, they got pasta DOWN.

This visit my husband was with me so we also split a big ribeye steak.  Damn. It was seasoned perfectly.  My husband is extremely picky and hates to pay full price for anything, so the food better be good or he gets very annoyed.  He was blown away by the steak.  It was dry aged and cooked perfectly.  We paired it with spinach which was perfect.  He also despises vegetables but he ended up eating well over half the big side of spinach without even blinking.  

In addition to amazing dinner, great service, groovy Ferraris all over the place, they also do a breakfast.  The breakfast won't blow your mind like dinner, but it is very reasonably priced and blows that crappy Denny's on the strip away.",CZ4tdIXmiiMQHQ62lesnKw,5,4,5,MvwpdLosrsUKFdiXDkes0A

5398293,2010-08-15,3,1FAvxOUOGGyZoYNlAXACag,"I kid you not. At the end of the meal my friend said ""Well, the best thing we had was the water."" And the rest of us nodded our heads in agreement. Let me explain.

It was hot. We were outside. It was lovely to be out on the patio by the water fountains. My fellow diners and I have all lived in  Europe. We are  not super demanding American tourists. But it was hot. All we wanted to do when we sat down was drink some water. It was fully 15 minutes before a server even came by to offer us menus but did not get us water. Another 10 minutes and the waiter stopped by and finally poured some water. My friend managed to get in her diet coke order before he hurried away from our table but my order fell on deaf ears as he was walking away. Another several minutes before my friend got her diet coke and still no offer to take our order for drinks or food. And people - they were not busy - at least half the tables were empty. 

It gets worse. The food was just not that good. My salad was described as an herb salad with yellow and red pear tomatoes. When it arrived it had no herbs and I basically had to mine for the tomatoes. This might have been forgiven but the dressing had no flavor. I think they must have just put oil over the salad, no vinegar, no flair, nothing. Even on The Strip at $9 for a small pre-dinner salad I expect some flavor.

Later came the Asparagus Crab pizza. Asparagus. Ha. The asparagus was used like a garnish. One overcooked, wrinkled looking little half-spear was placed on every other slice of pizza. In total - no more than 3 full spears were harmed in the making of that pizza. The crab was generous but nothing great. Far too much cheese - so much so that the thin crispy style crust drooped when you picked up your slice. It was just disappointing. Hence, my friend ending the meal with the saddest little quote ever ""The best thing about that meal was the water.""",w_0oOSvxsQXFqYDgiRxDaw,2,0,2,e6oXRC2aNrdI_7jLdmpROg

Upon sitting down, we ordered a couple of drinks; my wife ordered a 6-ounce Pinot Noir and I ordered a 9-ounce Chardonnay. When the drinks arrived, my wife noticed the pours for each drink looked identical ... both 6 ounces. We asked our waitress about it and she said the bartender simply gave my wife a generous pour. When we pointed out my wife's pour was six ounces as was mine (which should have been 9-ounces), she said she'd find out what was going on from the bartender. Throughout the rest of our dinner, she never provided us an explanation regardless of our frequent requests for such.

When it came time to pay the bill, we noticed an HSE charge on the check. We inquired as to what the charge was (it was exactly 20% of the total bill). Our waitress said it's a service charge all customers had to pay. I said, ""What kind of service charge? What's it for?"" The waitress said the money is split among the kitchen and wait staff. I said, ""So you're tipping yourselves?"" She said, ""Well, I wouldn't say that."" I asked her what she would call it, and after a bit of back-and-forth, she finally admitted it was a means of tipping. 

What a joke Dal Toro is. Their food is mediocre at best, and throughout our entire experience, the restaurant tried to rip us off ... short pours, imposed (forced) self-tipping, and a rude 'couldn't-give-a-crap' staff. Never again for us.

5471233,2011-08-09,2,1FAvxOUOGGyZoYNlAXACag,"We came here around 11pm sunday night because of a lack of options. Should have ran in the other direction after seeing the poor yelp rating.

Food: I ordered the New york strip steak w/ brandy peppercorn sauce ($33). The only other option was a bleu cheese topping. I didn't like how they didn't offer NY steak option without sauce or topping but I ended up ordering the sauce on the side. This was a good thing because the sauce was flavorless and I preferred not to use it. This was the WORST steak I've ever paid money for, except maybe that $14.99 T-Bone I drunkenly ordered at Denny's 6 years ago. I ordered the steak medium rare, it came out medium well. I sent it back (which I rarely do) and the next steak came out medium. It came with a side of ""frittes"" which were also bad--crunchy fried bits with no discernible potato. Halfway through the steak I had to ask for ketchup so I could finish my steak. That bad.

My friends ordered Lasagna ($20, bad), Seafood Pasta (~$30, ok), Chilean Sea Bass ($40, decent). No one was really happy with their meal. We made sure to fill up on the bread w/ olive spread they provided.

Service: Our waiter was awkward and soft spoken. He seemed nervous, maybe he was new? But we ended up being overly extroverted to be encouraging and make him feel more comfortable, (which is usually the servers job!) However, he wasn't at all rude which is usually my major gripe with service. Also, we ordered a calamari appetizer that never came. 

Ambience: This is what you're paying for. We were seated in a nice, dimly lit outdoor patio area. You can hear the sirens show at T.I. going on across the street although you can't really see what's going on. There is a Lamborghini and a couple of other cool cars in the gallery attached to the restaurant. Not enough of a gimmick to make up for the bad food. 

Bottom Line: I would have rather spent my $45 to drive the Lamborghini around the block once. Don't come here",6J54qM4nxiuqqYUBrvp3fA,1,0,1,STus4T_aRKjNkZwJd9p1gA

Great views and great for people-watching.  I started with the caprese and it was really wonderful.  The tomatoes were fresh and the mozzarella tasted like they make it right there in the restaurant.  My only issue is that they serve the mozza in a huge ball (think grapefruit size) in lieu of the standard slices.  It was delicious but it would feed 4 or 5 people.  I would have been happier with about half of the serving because I ended up not eating all of it.  My husband and I even shared and it was more than enough.  For our meals, the hubby ordered the linguine allo scoglio and he was very happy.  I tried a bite too and it was extremely tasty.  I ordered branzino croccante and it was the best sea bass dish I have ever eaten and I order fish more often than not.  The dish had the perfect amount of breading and the sauce was light and tasty.  My only issue with this dish was that I did nearly ingest a couple of fish bones and they left the fish on the skin (yuck).  I also wish there had been a meatier portion of the fish (I saw a couple of other folks order this and they received nicer portions than I did).  After dinner, we shared the lemon torte and it was heaven.  OK...so the reason for only 3 stars.....SERVICE!!!   Never, not ever have I seen such slow service anywhere AND they were not busy.  I don't think it was the kitchen either.  The waiter could not multi-task at all.  He did not clear the table timely, he did manage to check on us (once) and instead of stopping by two or three tables to retrieve payment, he processed them one at a time.

We walked up to the hostess stand to see a young girl wither feet up on the table...not a good first impression and it didn't help that she was rude and not welcoming at all. She took us to our table and immediately felt bad vibes. The other families around us looked unhappy, there was a large table of overly loud people, and the menu was illegible.

So we walked back in to the Palazzo, past the Sports store and bar (both closed) and were seated at an outdoor table next to the moat of fountains. This is a phenomenal spot for people watching on the strip because you're recessed from the street and separated by tropical-ish plants and a moat of lovely step fountains. 

Too bad the view is the only highlight of this restaurant. 

The service was atrocious. ATROCIOUS. We had a miserable man who may have just woken up himself, possibly still high. 

We had to flag him down to take our order after he walked by our table 5 times, never acknowledging us. No, he was not doing anything like delivering dishes when walking by. 

I asked for water twice before walking up and getting it myself. When he saw me doing so he apologized- I'm glad he had to sense to know that a customer should not be doing that at a non-buffet restaurant. I just shrugged and said Hey I was already up. 

I had ordered eggs benedict and asked for no ham. Of course, out comes the dish with ham on it. I pointed it out to the server who again  said oh gosh sorry. Funny enough just before he brought out our dishes he was apologizing to the table adjacent to ours- someone ordered something ""not spicy"" and he thought they said ""extra spicy"". An easy thing to confuse. Not.

The food was not worth the wretched service. Eggs overcooked, toast burned, bleh. Although the fruit plate was fresh and tasty, I warn you all to not waste your time or money at this joke of a joint.

We came here because we were looking for a reasonably priced steak.  Well, we got that, but it was also reasonably mediocre.  The spidey sense should go off when the steaks are all distinguished on the menu by the sauce going on top of them.

My bolognese sauce was a bit oversalted, but otherwise, fine.

Service was quite bad, but I wasn't expecting miracles.  Still worse than I thought, tho.  It took quite a lot of time to get refills and empty dishes cluttering our rather small table were not removed.

5794203,2015-02-16,1,1FAvxOUOGGyZoYNlAXACag,"WORST VEGAS EXPRIENCE EVER!!!
For New Years in Las Vegas with my wife I purchased tickets on the website of Dal Toro Restaurant for a Private VIP Table for Two. The package included a dinner at 8pm in the main restaurant, followed by a VIP table at the club lounge with champagne service. The most important part of the package was getting a private table all night to have place to sit down in order to enjoy the New Year's Eve. Dal Toro pre-charged a total of $279.95 for two tickets. When we arrived at the restaurant the evening of Dec 31, I was charged an additional ""bottle fee"" of $50 for the table service. 

The entire event was a complete disaster from the beginning. The staff was extremely unorganized and could not smoothly bring guests into the restaurant. Even though we arrived at 7:30pm, we were not seated until 8:30pm. The servers were bringing the food faster than we could eat it, and taking away plates before we could finish. It was clear that they were rushing us out of the restaurant so that they could make the table free for more guests. We did not enjoy our meal, but hoped that the night would get better with VIP table to the club lounge. After dinner, we asked how to get our private table at the club lounge and the worker said the table was overbooked and we should just wait for one to free up. After 45 minutes of waiting, more people were waiting for the table and we did not think the table would free up. I checked with the worker and asked who is going to leave when we are all here to celebrate New Year's Eve. She said that she was just a lifeguard who was temporarily hired for the event and did not know what to do. I asked for a manager, and she said that she could not find any manager in charge. Realizing that we may have to spend New Years' Eve standing in line, I asked for a refund since they cannot get us a table that we paid for. I was told that I can go onto the website to get refund and for now we can go down to the club to see if we can find any table. So we entered the club and found that it was packed with people with no available tables. My wife and I spent the rest of the night looking for a table and asking servers about how to get the champagne service that we paid for. We never got the private table or the service that we paid for. 

Over the next few days I called the restaurant to ask a manager about the refund. I left several messages and my calls were never returned. Finally, on Sunday, Jan 4th, I went to the restaurant in person to request a refund. The manager on duty, Massimo, explained that they overbooked the event and many people were asking for refunds, so it would take time to process it. He asked for my credit card information, phone number, name, and receipts. He said that he would call me the following week after he processed the refund. He also took the receipt for the $50 bottle service and said that it would be refunded right away since it was a direct transaction with the restaurant, and the $279.95 would take a little longer.

There was no refund on my account the following week, so I called the restaurant on Jan 12. They did not pick up the phone, so I left a message. My call was not returned, so a week later on Jan 19, I called several times until it was picked up. I asked Massimo why the refund was not processed. He said he needed more time so that he could speak with the owner, Lorenzo. I asked why the $50 was not immediately refunded and he said he was working on it and there were many other people complaining. He said it would take another week. I called back on Jan 28 to check the status. I asked to speak with the owner, but was told that he has been out of town for several weeks. Massimo told me that the owner would be back the following week and that he would call me at that time. The next week, I did not get a call from anyone at Dal Toro, and decided to settle this through my credit card company. 

This entire situation is riddled with fraud, misrepresentation, and deception. I was swindled out of $329.95 and my New Years' evening with my wife was ruined. From the beginning, Dal Toro cheated me into believing that the situation would improve. Starting with the dinner and club fiasco, and ending with the lies about processing a refund, Dal Toro has successfully scammed me and wasted many hours of my time. As this is the 6th Annual ""Midnight in Venice"" New Year's Eve event, the restaurant should be able to provide a smooth service as advertised. However, it is clear that Dal Toro intentionally overbooked the event and deliberately avoided making refunds, hoping that angry customers would forget and that a fresh crop of unsuspecting first-time Vegas tourists would walk into the same trap the following year. This business practice cannot be allowed to continue. There were many foreigners on vacation who experienced the same con trick, and I am embarrassed that they were treated with such inhospitable service in my country.",FkGhkbV2nZG80zvyaDGsmg,0,0,1,xQfFlx2vXJ2Mh095AuMuVQ

Other members of my party were very happy with their pasta dishes. We finished the night with 2 desserts which were delicious! Our waiter was extremely attentive and friendly. He was from Italy and gave great recommendations. I did not give 5 stars because the quality of food is not worth the price.

The prime rib was absolutely unbelievable.  Like the taste was incredible, the juiciness, the flavorful crust, the meat red-soaked with deliciousness... it was really, really one of the best steaks I've tasted.  It's one of the most expensive things on the menu ($45) but sooo worth it.

The wait staff was knowledgeable but mostly just really friendly.  The bathrooms are awesome -- that's one thing about Vegas, they really do it up in the bathroom stalls.  This one had some sort of orange glass bowl sink with a waterfall stream to wash your hands.  

Their free bread came with a reeeeaally good pesto olive oil, their calamari was just right.  And you can see those Lamborghinis in this glass room next to the restaurant.  Pretty neat.",fV5gsAHc9tSmp98Fb46WIQ,1,0,4,qsLwSHFg1aDcu-HNZNf6CQ

The Lambo museum/dealership is blah, its cool to look at if you're eating there and get in for free, but dont pay money to see it, same kinds of cars are driving up and down the strip on a busy weekend anyway.

Despite the service being rather satisfactory (drinks and food were delivered somewhat rapidly), we were pretty perturbed when they moved us from our table after being seated for at least 15 minutes.  The reason? A (reservationless) party decided they wanted the booth we were occupying and apparently they looked like bigger spenders.
We complained and requested free drinks, and they accommodated.  This was one of the most positive aspects of the dinner (free drinks, that is).  
The decor was beautiful, but a bit too romantic and quiet for a bachelorette party.  I would say it would be better for a date; that is, if the food was any good.  Unfortunately, the lasagna I ordered was pretty detestable.  Everyone else said their food was ""alright.""  Not too convincing to me.  I honestly don't remember if the drinks were tasty or not; I'll consider that as ""they were OK.""  No bread/butter for the table either.
