The crew is really bad at getting orders done properly, often forgetting things like the drinks for kids meals, or ignoring special requests. And if you have a special request or are a repeat customer, the crew tries to use language barriers to say bad things about the customer in question. Unfortunately for them, I understand enough Spanish being raised by my Mexican father. I've heard the crew do this to myself and other customers present in the building. The only reason I've come back so often is because they're the closest location to me without having to drive for a while. Today is the last straw though. Avoid this one. This intersection's food services are all around awful, maybe there's something in the water.",r-pV-q8gmlGxmmIKadIyRA,1,0,1,tM3TUkpnsTeCA7DQfW0C2w

At 12:32 (20 minutes later) they took my order. I pulled up and 'Rain' said, ""Sorry, we were having technical difficulty"" and, ""the other person that works here was in the bathroom, so I had to do everything myself."" Then he asked me to back up and pull back up to the window so it would reset the timer. I finally got the food at 12:38. I will say that at least the order was correct and the food was hot and delicious. That was riDICulous!",ODCLXz7qwhrHOSbjMO6bKQ,2,0,1,uBxR2j3QNPIGV4SJiok0cg

I pulled up to the Dt today,  and said "" can you please pull to the front"" I said no, i want to wait here. I used to work for arbys and I know what your doing,  your trying to beat the clock and fake report to your manager as well as the district supervisor.  I hope they see this as u guys try to Cheat and pull cars forward. I won't ever do that so your wasting your time with me",fzgHuvx5tFnCHf5lQAtNfg,0,0,1,D9kQhm-V97aMjIOpIWQXFw
2539055,2018-03-18,0,taaYWCkUulZL56qZmS1VzQ,After receiving my order I ask for ranch and the guy acted like he put some in the bag but he didn't. I park my car to check if my order is right and of course they didn't so I go in to ask for ranch and to get my correct order. Mean while the guy taking the orders was talking about pitos which means dicks in Spanish. I don't know his name but he works night time. I felt so uncomfortable because my daughters heard them.

2773234,2017-11-24,2,taaYWCkUulZL56qZmS1VzQ,"Thank you for being open on thanksgiving!! Although I kind of wished the girl that was helping me would have had a chance to be with her family because she seemed sad so I asked her if she had a choice to work or not and she said no, she did not have a choice and she was sad that she could not be with family. You know, I'd rather have the place close on this one special holiday than force someone to be away from their family to server me a taco on thanksgiving. I am also willing to bet that if the manager put some effort and thought and communicated with the staff he/she would have been able to staff turkey day with only employees that really wanted to be there -- put your workers first. I could see three or four other employees inside and the diner looked empty you could have gone with a skeleton crew and let anyone who has children and/or a family that they wanted to be with, go home. Please work on that, people matter and I could have found somewhere else to eat and would willingly had done so for her to be with her family. Anyways the tacos were great, per usual thank you so much for being open on a day where I usually eat KFC and they were closed.",-SjQXQd-IRfOdUdYYwWGOQ,2,2,3,V8p_YRiRJMU2kmS8SWDB1Q

I ordered a shake I opened the lid to eat some off the top and noticed a small black hair . Susan was the drive Thur attendant whom argued with about it being my hair and then forgot the dipping sauce that I had asked for ..

Soon as I pulled upon drive thru, I was greeted by her and with such energy and enthusiasm, and I had a feeling her being friendly wasn't just her being at the drive thru window, but it just seemed like her natural personality. When I got up to the pick up window, she greeted me with the same energy and a big smile, even had a short conversation with me and complimented my tattoo on my arm. 

5 stars for that employee.. friendly and quick drive thru service!",P-B0vRy-vGaIPSrV-IxpJw,0,0,5,vKYF_IqB94RyVaoRyWZOSg

5576525,2018-06-30,0,taaYWCkUulZL56qZmS1VzQ,What a waste of $7.50.  I came in today because of the attractive $4.99 combo with spicy chicken.  Obviously that's a scam to bring in more foot traffic since I didnt order not a thing extra (it comes with fry drink and sandwich automatically).  Pretty sure tax doesnt come out to $2.50 on a $4.99 order.  I should've told them never mind.  Only reason I didnt is bc they had already started on it since it was so dead in there.
