1645753,2014-12-28,5,cHPhtFqvkQ9hpr_ka-sLow,"Shopping at Costco is almost always a huge headache, and without fail, even after purchasing massive portions of food, I have no interest in cooking after shopping here and typically end up stopping for a meal on my way out- looking forward to the yogurt parfait treat is almost motivation to shop here in the first place!

Menu is simple, but the fact that they only accept cash is a huge pain in the ass.
The hotdogs, Caesar salad, hotdogs, and pizza are all of acceptable quality, even considering the very small price tags. Speaking of size, portions are beyond enormous. Order half as much as you think you'll need.

In addition to the cash-only policy*, the traffic jam of exiting people and their overloaded baskets stopping and causing congestion are additional downsides to the placement of the Food Court area. There needs to be a designated place for carts.

An older gentleman reached down behind me and into my pants and pretended like he didn't know what was going on. When we called the manager, he tried grabbing her chest. Again, this was my very first day in Vegas. It took me awhile to get over what happened since I was so shaken up- I absolutely hated Vegas for a long time and thought things like ""This would never happen at the SSF Costco"". In any case, the manager did her best, but I was so traumatized at the moment. I wish I had called the cops or done something more. We learned later that the man's wife eventually came and Costco management had talked to her about what happened. It took me a long time to be comfortable eating here again and when I do, I'm super vigilant about it. 

People here get kind of weird in general. I've left my food at a table for a minute to get soda, and multiple times I've seen people already eyeing it wondering if they should take it. The staff here is efficient, they try to clean up messes as soon as possible, and things are mostly stocked. Food quality is better than other Costcos.  It's really the patrons that make things difficult and unruly. It would probably be better if the food court had a separate entrance and was separate from the store so it doesn't feel like all hell is breaking loose.",Y8adrWFzckrjuC11aAs9Og,2,1,3,wzdTSD7uJc6Qooi33yvV7w

I've tried:
- Beef Hot Dog
- Polish Hot Dog
- Chicken Caesar Salad
- Cheese Pizza
- Pepperoni Pizza
- Combo/Combination Hot Dogs
- Very Berry Sundae
- Vanilla Yogurt
- Chocolate Yogurt
- Swirl Yogurt
- Churro
- Gelato (no longer available)

All of the food I've tried are all GOOD AND ALWAYS FRESH! They have Pepsi brand drinks and guess what, FREE REFILLS! The worst part is the waiting in long line to order. 

MY ADVICE FOR PEOPLE WHO READS MY REVIEWS: When are you done shopping at Costco Wholesale, you can tell the cashier (Not food court) at Costco to order food items from the food court. Just bring the receipt to the pick up line at the food court and you can just pick up the food there. More easier and simpler way to get your food faster.

Here at the actual food court they only accept cash, if you need to pay with a debit/credit card go to the check out lanes and you can do so. I would also recommend ordering it prior to arriving as it can take  up to 25 mins or longer on a busy day.

4293835,2014-05-13,1,cHPhtFqvkQ9hpr_ka-sLow,"Seriously, I don't think food can be cheaper than this. My girlfriend, who had never been to Costco before, asked me how they could make this delicious food so cheap. The only thing I could come up with is they are selling it at cost in order to get more people in!

$1.50 for a quarter pound hotdog WITH a fountain drink? Yes please! We couldn't cook dinner cheaper at home unless we were making rice and washing it down with water. 

They also have $10 whole pizza pies, and I'm not talking mini pies like dominos, these are 18 inch pies! With the quality I've experienced in their other items (plus a few other customers on line told me it was very good), I don't see why you'd ever buy a whole pizza anywhere else. 

The most common thing people write about are the ice creams. I grew up with the frozen yoghurt with berry sauce ($1.65 I believe), and they have continually expanded their offerings. Now they have a mocha frozen drink that many said was unbelievable (and looked unbelievable), and they also had gelato! For like 1.50 for 3 HUGE scoops in a waffle cone. After seeing gelato in the Venetian for like 7 bucks a scoop, I practically threw my money at the Costco cashier (who was super friendly). The gelato was also VERY good (surely not as good as what's at the Venetian but at that price who cares?), what I've come to expect from any Kirkland item. 

Lastly they had some interesting items I've never tried purely because they didn't cost 1.50. The beef brisket sandwich looked incredible, not like one of those ""looks good in our ad"" deals, but when I saw it come out it looked HUGE with a ring around it to keep things nice and clean. Well done. 

If you're late night shopping, and don't feel like cooking, stop here and get some delicious mega cheap food, and wash it down with some gelato!",x-W0OQiUdNLsoMhg6GfXSg,5,2,5,qT8PUq8_NzeB6EDq5gZkCw

This night was like any other I'd gone to Costco's food court; which is to say it felt like Wall Street during a heavy trade. Despite the lines being painted on the floor to remind customers what's what and where to go to get it; it becomes chaos -- and it shows on the faces of the employees as well; on a consistent basis. I get that. After forty-five minutes in line, I was still just as happy to be getting the opportunity to sink my teeth into some melting mozarella. By now, I was ready to take down a churro like something FIERCE, but I didn't want to risk filling my stomach with anything but my pepporoni pizza I ordered. Sorry churro -- NO VACANCY TONIGHT!

As I sat for it to be baked, the chaos didn't end. I sat directly in front of the Pick-Up Window to ensure I'd hear them call my number. Several times, I saw people come up and ask for a time update. The answer was always ""20 more minutes."" The others would stomp their feet inpatiently as they walked away, and I reminded myself not to be ""That Guy."" I'll be patient -- let them do their jobs, right?

Well, we're now thirty minutes into my wait. I've now been here for nearly two hours. 

""It's OK, Adrian -- it's OK to just ask them for an update; just be totally polite!"" I told myself.

I was told twenty more minutes, and I plastered a fake smile onto my face. Hey, this pizza is good stuff and a great deal! I sorta asked for it coming during rush hour anyway, right? At least nobody will have to cook tonight!

..... it's been another half hour, though. I check in, again assuring myself I'm not going to be the person who is obnoxious and rude. 

""We called you a half hour ago; nobody came to get it so we threw it away.""

As she said, I heard a pop. It was like a rubber band snapped as it launched a novelty firecracker inside of my head. Hanger has now started to streamline through my blood, and I'm fully infused with it.

I assured them that I wasn't called. I'd kept track of the numbers. There was little to no pattern or consistent pattern. Regardless, I asked what they could do NOW. 

""I can go get it back and reheat it?""

**CRACK!!** Blood vessells had now ruptured straight from my brain stem and into my eyes: The only thing I could see was the many, many people who had finished their food around me; all with full stomachs and smiles. I saw the cheschire grins of the husbands getting brownie points by picking up dinner for their wives to have a night off. I then reminded myself that I was literally just offered nuked trash-pizza.

I'd recap what I said to the manager who was hiding behind several other frontline employees, but all I could hear in my own mind was the aneurysm making it's way through the brain circuitry-inferno and to the soles of my feet that left me scrambling for the pharmaceutical aisles for any sort of first aid to help out. Maybe there's a health insurance rep peddling a plan at a booth somewhere. No matter how or who, I'll need medical attention by the end of this episode ......

..... somewhere in the mess, I heard a ringing noise in my ear and was snapped back to reality. And that reality was that the best they could do was put one in right now. You guessed it; it'll be another twenty minutes. I'd also receive a refund. My options were: Leave; upset and hungr(ier,) or get that pizza that I'd waited for this long, and stick it out. I opted to stay. The refund helped prevent a few more pathways being singed in my head, but this was such a horrible folly that I'll never trust my money and time with this particular location; EVER again.",9wCf_htfipOl80iljteukg,14,11,1,vWmcfupQ6cvln5PtIvu9eA

You get free samples, great prices, mass quantities of who-knows-what, photos printed, contact lenses, prescriptions filled, fresh fruit, toilet paper, mattresses, wine galore, and pretty much anything in between. I love that they don't use plastic bags, no one should. Bring your own large reusable bags for the small items. Duh, that should be standard everywhere! They also have a great return policy. 

The down side? 
You can't use your credit card to rack up those points for free flights. So hello debit card, let me wipe the dust off of you and give you a swipe. 
The parking situation is intense. People act like they're allergic to walking far distances, but ironically enough, once in the store, that's EXACTLY what you're doing! So avoid the crazies and park in Egypt. 
There are never enough employees working in the photo center. The two lovely ladies that are usually there work their little butts off non-stop and there's still always a line of people with questions. 
Sundays are INSANE! Avoid going on this day at all costs. Unless you take a Xanax.",ZuWAof5l6yKeft-F1QCWSQ,2,1,4,bnb39pnGeMTbfAXrCnYREw
5918659,2015-06-13,8,cHPhtFqvkQ9hpr_ka-sLow,"Good, if not excellent value, food for the price customers pay at the Costco Food Court. Even then I am fairly certain they are still making a small profit while providing value added service to Costco members.

And seriously, even if Costco just breaks even or operates the food court at a nominal loss (highly doubtful), the loss leader strategy still contributes to the positive and profitable warehouse operation. I have to try really, really hard to spend under $20 on a visit, and it usually ends up being in the $100-200 range just shopping for myself.  Do the math, and a typical family likely spends a couple hundred per visit.

So for a place offering just a modest menu of hot dogs & a drink, to chicken bake, pizzas, smoothies & gelatos, Costco Food Court is a food service operation that small mom & pop's restaurants can easily be envious of. Now that's saying a lot!

Oh, the line moves fast. You can also add items from the food court as you are paying for all the goodies in the checkout line & head straight to the pickup window.  2 thumbs up.",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,14,11,4,Nw7XuxcOqIR2rEnZat9bNg

If you have 5 bucks and needed yourself a good meal costco food court doesn't disappoint. The only negative I would assign them is that they're cash only",KyMkKb5IohKb0S7v4Jv-oA,5,3,5,V8Rj0nlI7teEJJs_Dz7u5w
