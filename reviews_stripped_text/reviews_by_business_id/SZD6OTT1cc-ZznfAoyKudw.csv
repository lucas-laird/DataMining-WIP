608233,2018-01-17,2,SZD6OTT1cc-ZznfAoyKudw,Was excited to try this place but really disappointed with the way they run it. Music is way to loud you have to wait in between songs to talk to anybody in your table. I try to order a fish taco and was told they dont sell them at that location. Its on the menu but they wont sell you the $2 version only the $4 is available. Seafood was ok but the sushi was terrible. Band members kept interrupting our meal to ask us if we wanted to hear a specific song and told them no. After the 4th time I was asked in a 10 min span I finally said yes hoping the guy would leave us alone and he asked me for $25 for my requested song I just laughed and told him not to come by my table anymore. I than get approached by a server selling shots of tequila as if I was in club in mexico. Never again,KQ520TJcuQQ8oLYMecRNUw,1,0,1,U6wmLhDdjLp1WIDhS-tK8g

Other than that everything else was great. Oh and if you don't like Mexican music don't go there because it's loud and I love it but I see some retarded reviews here saying it's too loud. The name of the restaurant says it all in Sinaloa that's how it's done music seafood  beer and friends. Just saying. Oh and menu is in English someone here wrote a review saying menu was in Spanish.

1869323,2018-02-03,1,SZD6OTT1cc-ZznfAoyKudw,"This was the worst restaurant experience I have ever had. Myself and a group of people got together for a celebration. While dining in the establishment it took 20 minutes to get our first drink order. When we placed our order for food we received a portion of what we had ordered. The food was not good at all. The chicken nuggets arrived soggy and full of grease and everything else was cold. When we asked to speak to the manager it took 15 minutes for him to arrive, he stopped and spoke to the people next to us and proceeded to walk away. My husband to hail him down and ask him to come back. We informed him of the issues and he said he would look into it. 30 minutes later he nor our waiter returned.  People from our party started to leave and we had not received a bill yet. After someone hunted the manager down again he arrived with the bill, stated that he could not locate our waiter and advised us he had taken 20% off. After careful calculation we realized we had been charged for food and drinks we never received and that issue to another 20 minutes to clear up. 

Outside of the service issue there were a couple of other problems. The establishment has a live band that plays Banda music. The musicians go out into the crowd, sing to people, and take special request. They refused to pay any attention to me when My husband requested a song but when the table next to us made the same request they played it. I am not sure if the issue was they did not understand his Spanish or maybe it was the color of his skin. Let me make something clear Hispanics come in all shades of the rainbow and apparently so does ignorance. I recorded a video of him and the way the musician turned his back on him when he made the request. 

The other issue I had with this establishment was while attempting to take care of the billing situation at the register the manager was to busy eating Ramens  he got from another establishment to assist the young lady in correcting the errors on our bill. The reason I know this is because he sat out in the open eating them with a couple of his friends. I don't know about some people but I am a little turned off when individuals that work at an eating establishment don't eat their own food or they eat food from somewhere else out in the public eye. 

If it were not for the fact that this establishment is located in a casino and the consequence of getting black listed from all of their sister casinos we would have all walked out and not paid the bill.",tpOqn0OsbWp0acpw7rkQcA,7,0,1,UW2g9Dp6jYrMfucWoZNaPg

2055917,2017-12-05,4,SZD6OTT1cc-ZznfAoyKudw,"I was really disappointed in this new restaurant located in the Fiesta Rancho Casino.  Upon entering the establishment, there was a Mariachi band playing extremely loud and constant monotonous music; it was non-stop that after we were seated and the waitress came to take our order,  you could not carry on a conversation with the people you were dining with, let alone place your order with the waitress.  I forgot to mention that the menu that was given to us had the descriptions of all food items 
solely in Spanish.  That was a bit of a problem, as a few diners in our party did not read or understand Spanish.  The waitress said that they had ordered menus in English but that they had not arrived by the time of the grand opening of the restaurant.   The small basket of complimentary chips looked and tasted like they just ripped open a stale bag of tortilla chips from the grocery store; the salsa which accompanied the chips was served in a small micro-saucer and had no flavor.  While we waited, I ordered a frozen margarita (which was the only redeemable item I had all night).   It took quite a while for our food to arrive; most of what was ordered was bland and not very tasty.  

The quality, quantity and over-all taste of the cuisine did not impress me and I don't think I will be recommending this restaurant to family or friends, nor will I be dining here again.",kaBecGBXCS4xkv37urcl7A,10,0,1,HbUuqoIMtMa-ap6uw8RlZg
2106539,2018-01-15,1,SZD6OTT1cc-ZznfAoyKudw,"So, I chose this place to grab drinks after seeing photos of the Mango and chamoy margarita and the VIP michelada on instagram. The michelada had good flavor but the only difference between the regular and vip was $6 and 6 shrimp on a skewer. The mango marg was ok. It tasted artificial in my opinion. We didn't eat there so I can't comment on the food. The staff was friendly. When people say it's loud in the restaurant, that is an understatement. They have a live band with horns and they are amped which makes it even louder. We sat in the bar to avoid the loud music and it was still loud. I'm talking yelling to hear each other while the band plays. It was an experience but I probably won't go back.

Consequently, the server was not prompt as our drinks came in a little longer. When the rest of our food came in, some of the party did not have anything, as they failed to inform us that the chef made a mistake. This review deserves somewhat of a star because the band made it better as they sang a requested song and performed an amazing job.

From the sushi to mason jar margaritas served on poor quality plates, silverware, and a rocking table, all I want is Garduños back.

The food was really good. I had the hot chili appetizers that had crab and cheese and it also came with a small side of white rice. I tried their micheladas and they were very good(I'm super picky when it comes to micheladas). 
My husband ordered a ceviche plate that the server recommended and he really liked it. It had shrimp, shreds of carrot, octopus, and lots of lime. Paired with mini tostadas. 
They also have live entertainment. The Banda was super entertaining and I loved how they would go around and take any song requests from the tables. The Banda is really loud so I would not recommend coming for a first date! 
The reason I take one star away is because they brought our plates out at different times when I requested everything to be brought out at the same time. I waited for my plate 10 minutes after my husband received his. They also messed up our drink order and side orders.

La hostess hablan como si no quisieran que uno los escuchara, fácilmente hay personas que pierden su turno en la lista de espera por este motivo. 
Nos sentamos he inmediatamente llego nuestro mesero ha ofrecernos bebidas. Nos llevó nuestras bebidas y tuvimos que preguntar por los totopos y la salsa a lo que nos respondió que tienen prohibido servir primero los totopos que las bebidas; por cuestiones de que hay personas que se han ahogado segun el. ( Hecho que fue mentira puesto que observamos que en otras mesas dejaron primero los totopos con su salsa y después las bebidas).
Ordenamos:
- Limonada ( hecha en casa y desafortunadamente estaba amarga ) 
- Taco gobernador ( pequeño y con una mínima porción de camarón, no parecia gobernador nada impresionante).
- Quesadilla de marlin ( tenia buen sabor, nos gustó) incluso quisimos ordenar un taco de camarón pero nos dijo nuestro mesero que ya no estaba en el menú.
- Tostada Michoacana ( nada impresionante a la vista, le faltaba mucho sabor tuve que agregar mas sal y salsa negra que no sabia que era porque el mesero olvidó presentar las salsas, el pulpo estaba sobre cocinado. Solo me comí el camarón y las pequeñísimas piezas de aguacate)
- Molcajete ( mmm muy pequeño para el precio que tiene, nada impresionante, parecia una botana y no el platillo fuerte.)
- Nuestras bebidas fueron rellenadas por el gerente Alvaro puesto que nuestro mesero descuidó la mesa en todo momento.

La comida tardó bastante para salir tomando en cuenta que pedimos antojitos. Háblamos con el gerente alvaro que se porto muy amable y dijo que tomaría en cuenta nuestras observaciones cuando se pronto llega un comensal muy molesto hacia el mencionándole que tenia mas de 40min esperando su comida.

Tomando en cuenta que conocemos la cocina sinaloense porque somos sinaloenses, este restaurante no cumple las expectativas en cuanto a servicio y sabor en mariscos. El sushi esta bien; prepárate para gritar porque la música esta muy fuerte debido a que tocan banda en vivo.

Upon entering the casino entrance we could hear the obnoxious loud music. There was a 15 minute wait even though there were several empty tables. They sat us right in front of the banda. First of the music was way too loud and I literally had to place my order by writing in as a text form so I could communicate with the waitress. I ordered a michelada and was very disappointed. I couldn't taste the beer and the flavor was pathetic to the point that I didn't not even drink half of it. The chips are stale and not very good in flavor. The salsa was okay but nothing great. I also had the ceviche called Mazatlan or something to that effect. The ceviche needed more flavor, it was awfully tasteless. In addition they don't carry any meat combinations like the other popular Mexican seafood places. What I disliked the most was the music, it was way too loud and if someone wants to request a song one must pay $25 WTH. I will never go to this place or recommended to any of my friends.

What caught my attention was the loud banda music playing when we walked in, which apparently they have everyday after 5. I loved it! Even though it may have gotten annoying a couple times because it was very hard to hear our server or my bf. So we mostly stayed quiet & enjoyed the music lol service wise, our food took a decent amount of time to come out but our server wasn't as attentive as she should've. The manager made the effort to stop by a couple times just to make sure everything was going good so that was a plus! Now to the good stuff the FOOD, is amazing! I loved absolutely everything! Their ceviche is pretty darn good we ended up getting the ceviche VIP, for our app we got the 3 hot chili's, now those were different but I was amazed of how good they were. We also ended up getting the camarones a la diabla & those were good as well, but let's not forget about their mango margarita now that was tasty too.

Something  a Mexican restaurant beside chips and salsa they gave us a sauté pepper with onions with their own soy sauce. Which the secret to their soy sauce is they add orange juice and lime juice takes soy sauce to another level trust me you will like it. 
They have different cocktail as well. I have the tamarind margarita came with a rim of tajin seasoning.

The Drink Menu is limited . Tamarind Margarita was different and delicious (the first one that is-after that... it became an expensive Agua de Tamarindo- it was warm- more tamarindo than alcohol)
Then THERE'S FINE PRINT...Saying... The Prices go up $1 or $2  when the loud banda Is playing. So your ""$6.75"" drink goes up to $8.95. apparently NEW MENUS in the works.

BANDA touch is good! however it is too too loud causing Mis Communication with the waiters. You definitely CAN'T converse with those at your table and we were far from the banda and we had to resort talking in between songs. 

FOOD was Pretty Good!.all seafood selection. But it was real good. But again ... Prices WILL change.

TIP:  Before ordering Ask waiter about the time price changes and if they are the NEW Menus.
