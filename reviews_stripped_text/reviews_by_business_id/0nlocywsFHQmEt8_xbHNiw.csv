We had five different dishes and all were wonderful.

The Ma-Por Tofu was to die for.  They claimed that the tofu was actually house made.  Incredible.

Kung Pao had great flavor unlike some of the out of a can Kung Pao sauce that many places use.  House made!

It was extremely clean and the staff was very, very attentive.  I will return on my next trip to Vegas.",o-__AF4umfaQuut646Voag,1,0,5,KMPwSIXShxN1sAWtgo53YQ
131652,2014-10-30,0,0nlocywsFHQmEt8_xbHNiw,First of all let me say that we will never order from Long Jin again. They can actually have the food back if they want it...it's still sitting in our fridge because no one wants to eat it. The lo mein was greasy and under-seasoned. The pungent chicken was like jerky and there was little to no sauce. The chicken fried rice was ok. The chicken and mushrooms was mainly mushrooms...very little chicken. Lastly the beef and Broccoli wasn't bad. For the amount of money we spent...over $75 total this was a HUGE bummer. We will never order again.,i1jT2MqrmmfKd_1sOdvX-Q,0,0,1,YTFwO9jDfr9GKxaoSTbuWg

My mate and I arrived in Las Vegas on July 24th and after we checked in at our timeshare we were too exhausted to meet our friends for dinner so we ordered delivery from Long Jin. We had not been eating for 5 minutes when my mate began to complain that she felt nauseated. Her chicken and rice was scorched. My food did not taste well at all. A few minutes later my mate was vomiting up the food. It was HORRIBLE!! I then became ill as well. Once we recovered I checked Yelp for reviews on this place, which is what I should have done before ordering from here, only to find out that this place was featured on something called ""Dirty Dining""!!!! There is no telling what had come in contact with our food or even if the food was fresh, which it did not taste fresh at all!!

Everyone was really attentive and came by to check up on how we were doing (not annoyingly so, but after a good amount had passed). When we were waiting for our order to arrive (and it was clear that my parents were antsy with hunger), the staff came by to give us an update on our food and reassure us that it would only be a couple more minutes. It wasn't like we had even flagged them down to ask or been talking about it; they could tell from my parents' body language. Hah.

My family came here for dinner on our way out of Vegas and had some pretty darn good food. We asked for less salt and less oil on our food and everything was still delicious. We ordered Beef Chow Mein, Sauteed Green Beans, and the Yang Chow Fried Rice. The fried rice was probably the best, with the great taste of the char-siu pork. 

Free tea, the sweetest oranges as our post-meal palate-cleanser, AND we got 20% off our meal--not sure why, but thanks! If ever I'm back in the area, I'll be coming here.",j7ddt3RJKFmoI42QrUUgVw,0,1,4,pars25I-YGnV0kIe-JHisw

445033,2013-05-25,0,0nlocywsFHQmEt8_xbHNiw,"I ordered this through a delivery service called GrubHub.com.  It was delivered between the times given, and the food was hot and fresh. A+ for that.  We ordered Sweet and sour Pork, General Chicken and Chicken and Broccoli, and a sided of egg fried rice..  Chicken and broccoli was great, and the fried rice, was OK. Generous portions. Of course, 3 servings of steamed rice for the entrees came with it.  BUT only 3 stars, because the sweet n sour pork, along with the general chicken was fried for way too long.  The pork was cut in chunks and were hard from being over done.  The general chicken was also cut in chunks and way over done, to the point that the batter coating had a burnt taste and chicken was also hard and tough.  Just my luck, that was my entree. lol

I hate being hard on them, as I have worked in the business, and someone just lost track of the fryer.  I just think that they shouldn't have served it.  I wouldn't have.  I understand that they don't want to serve under cooked pork or chicken, but my opinion is that the chicken should be sliced thinner for quicker cooking.  The pork was just plain ole over done by a few minutes.

I will say that I will give them another try, and see if they can redeem themselves as the presentation and taste was fine except for the overcooking on the two dishes.

I'd say give them a try, especially if  you want delivery, and because they have a lot of good reviews, my order may be one of the few mistakes they make.  I used a GrubHub promo I googled for $5 off.  So with $7 tip, grubhub charges, tax and minus the promo, it was $49.

942907,2013-08-16,0,0nlocywsFHQmEt8_xbHNiw,"We ate here due to the good reviews on Yelp.  However, we were very disappointed.

When we sat down we noticed that the table was dirty.  We mentioned this to the server and got some strange answer about how people don't use the tables.  No idea what she was trying to say (she spoke very good english).  My wife got some napkins and washed the table herself.  The server didn't even apologize.

We ordered the asian chicken salad and won ton soup for appetizers.  For the main dishes we ordered Chicken and broccoli and pan fried noodles with beef.

The chicken salad didn't come as described on the menu.  It had maraschino cherries  instead of dried cranberries.  There were no nuts on the salad and the dressing had no taste (supposed to be an asian vinaigrette)  and there was no sesame oil.  If they were out of so many things, they should have told us when we ordered it.  The salad just tasted like lettuce with very little other flavor. 

The won ton soup also had no flavor.  The broth tasted like boiled water and the vegetables and dumplings added nothing to the soup.

Likewise, the 2 main dishes were OK, but lacked any real flavor. I added soy sauce (which I never do) so that it would taste like something.

We tried to explain these problems to the server, but got nowhere.  She didn't even say she was sorry for the poor food.  She really needs to learn how to be a server at a restaurant.  She needs to carry customer comments to the kitchen and apologize to the customer that they weren't happy.

ordered

Hot/Sour soup (bowl- $5)
BBQ Pork ( $7)
honey walnut shrimp ( $12)

gf orders her ""good girl"" chicken and steamed veggies ( I believe cost for both under $12)

The soup was decent and a decent serving.  The pork was also a generous serving and we believe it was the pork loin so a good cut of meat.  I enjoyed the shrimp more than she did - we agreed it was above average.

gf was very happy that the chicken/veggies were properly prepared.  unfortunately, she tasted the honey shrimp and pork and that opened the flood gates !  The chicken and veggies were quickly placed in a to-go container and the girlfriend orders the citrus beef ( I think that's what it's called - cost less than $10) and it's over - she wolved most of that down ( btw - we agreed that was our fav dish of the night ) 

I'm stuffed but again, the gf just warming up - she decides we need  dessert ( the only item I finally got around to taking a picture of ) Banana/nutella egg roll with ice cream (we picked red bean ) - very good !  

Service was timely and attentive, then again, a little worried that we were the only people there at 7:30 pm on a Friday ( they did have several to-go orders while there ) 

Overall, we were very please and will consider this our local Chinese spot.

Jasmine hot tea was great.

I got a veggie lo-mein add garlic. Both seemed like great dishes.

Here is why I only give this place two stars.
1.THEY USE MSG. I'm 2000% sure. Why am I so sure? Because I'm VERY allergic. Had a migraine right after. Was very sick. I don't know if they state if they do/or do not and it's my fault for not asking.

Also, the service is awful.  I can't account for the restaurant itself, I'm referencing the rude individual(s) on the phone.  It's like the more please and thank yous I use, the meaner you are.

This is one of better Chinese restaurants in town. We strolled in around 7:40pm and the sign on the door stated they close at 9pm. When we walked in, the hostess/server looked at us and just said ""yes?"" in a borderline rude manner. We informed her we'd like a table for two. We were the only ones in the restaurant, but there were number of patrons who came in to pick up take out during our visit.

Once seated, the waitress' attitude changed completely for the better. She was conversational and offered suggestions. We opted for the appetizer sampler, Mongolian beef and roast duck. The roast duck is a must have! It was perfectly crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside with a maple glaze  adding to the incredible flavor. My Mongolian beef was one of the better ones I've had. The sauce was unique and delicious, portion plentiful and the meat fresh and perfectly cooked.

Nonetheless, these folks really do seem to care that you're happy and they're genuinely proud of their restaurant and their food.  Of the items we ordered, we really, really enjoyed the tangerine beef, which was excellent.  It's difficult to fry beef without overdoing it into shoe leather.  Happily for us, ours was done perfectly, lightly crunchy on the outside and correctly done on the inside.  The flavor of this dish is delightful, it was the highlight of my dinner.  Another great item was the spring rolls which were also nicely done and surprisingly flavorful.  About the only thing that failed to meet expectations was the beef satay.  The satay themselves were too cool on arrival and the sauce was unusually vinegary. (I'd say to save the satay ordering for when you're at a Thai place.)  Notwithstanding this, we had a lovely dinner and will return.  For the bargain conscious, another thing that makes Long Jin a good value is their participation in the Restaurant.com certificate program.  If you're into that, you can save a good chunk of money.

Always wondered about the food and finally got around too trying me some. I went for lunch in general fan of asian lunch specials. At Long Jin they have really nice one whole page selection of ones too choose from! It mostly your standard ones from the sweet and sour, kung pao, mongolian beef, etc. They do have the regular menu too choose from also but on this day went with the lunch special. Really for under ten dollars get pic k of entree, comes with choice of hot and sour soup or another one forget, fried egg roll, and favorite munchies fried noodle looking sticks dip in sweet and sour sauce before get your soup. I went with the lo mein noodles with chicken. Choice of soup went with the Hot and Sour soup. Also ordered on of the appetizers just too taste more of the menu. I tried the salt and pepper calamari. 

The Hot and Sour soup. Fan!!!! I really liked the depth of the flavor, hearty with lots of mushrooms, and whatever else they put in it. It great way too start meal with nice cup of HOT soup. The salt and calamari this I lOved. Too be fair anything done salt and pepper style (no matter the protein) destroy. The seasoning was well done had nice little kick too it. Best part of it was nice chunks of calamari rather then  ring style that can easily get overcooked and dried out. The breaded was perfect,  It had nice golden brown color, crispy, calamari moist on the inside cooked perfect, and addicting appetizer. The entree this is were felt like just OK nothing really amazed me or wanted me too have seconds. The noodles were cooked spot on, as were the vegetables, and chicken. Just felt that lack identity came too flavor in the dish. I felt like eating plain noodles with saute chicken and vegetables. I understand base of the dish but still could put something in it give it life. 

The service was awesome. I never had empty glass although since only one in the restaurant might not be best gage of the service. Still being the only one in for lunch they were very attentive too service. One thing that found odd was had no music going in the restaurant and since only one in for lunch felt awkward being so quite here pin drop. They do have couple televisions in the restaurants but neither of them was on. I like the decor inside it has nice relax vibe.

AMBIANCE; Long Jin is on the corner of Tropicana & Rainbow (across from Spanish Trail). It's in a strip mall with some cheesy stores. We hesitated to give it a try but because we live in Spanish Trail, we gave it a shot hoping it could be our go-to Chinese spot. The inside is very clean   updated & modern. It's a quaint spot to dine & offers delivery.

PRICES;  Dishes are all around the $10 price range. Dinner for 2 is cheaper & tastier than you could make at home.

SERVICE; the service has always been stellar, the owners are so sweet & tentative. Every time we go in we see more & more people coming in. Words obviously gotten out that this place is the bomb.

COMPLAINT; Long Jin JUST opened & their liquor license is apparently pending. It'd be nice to enjoy some wine to pair with all the amazing flavors.",5aP7I_IRRct_7Jdp-AQAVw,1,0,4,BzVs7_3CqlXRyXlXUYxBEQ

Ok so I ordered: Wor Won Ton soup, the appetizer (pupu) platter, Beef Chow Fun (asked for extra gravy), Pepper Steak, and Garlic Chicken.
WWT-void of BBQ pork slices and Shrimp, broth bland.
PuPu: the egg rolls where mushy, yes mushy. Crab Rangoon had no crab and no cream cheese, it was a fried wonton. The satay was overdone, discarded the calamari. The only decent thing was the crab tempura.
Beef Chow Fun: no Xtra gravy as requested, quite dry and the beef was not typical of the taste Chinese prepared sliced beef is found generally everywhere.
Pepper Steak: same issue with the meet. The gravy (sauce) was not the rich soy brown as I've had with other Pepper Steaks.
Garlic Chicken: not very garlicky, disappointed.
One small container of white rice provided when we had essentially 3 entrees (ok, 2 if I don't count chow fun which is noodle based).
 I had high hopes that were dashed quickly.
Should have known there would be issues when I was told several times-we're understaffed tonight and they game me a dirty glass filled with water while I waited.",huXqrSaGyNO1aZKiM55EUg,1,0,2,F77oJ3yW-EsVNHTqZLTd2Q

When I ordered my appetizer, I specifically, (again asked the same question:  Will I be receiving my shrimp in a circle, like when I purchased from a previous owner of this fraud joint.  Her answer was ""yes.""

I ordered Shrimp fried tempura and beef chow fun.  The chow fun was small, but tasty  The Shrimp was barely acceptable.  Hot, somewhat good, but definitely not what I ordered, both over the phone (questioning) or asking for in person,

There was not ONE person eating at dinner time when I arrived NOR whenI left. 

M guess is this place is ready to close their doors.  They have little to offer in quality of product, personality or ambiance..

I called ahead to let the restaurant know that I would be ordering peking duck so they were already preparing it when I arrived. I started with some hot and sour soup. It was delicious. When the waitress brought out the duck, she prepared it all for us and wrapped it in the little buns, sauced it, added the green onion. It was so so good. Nothing short of amazing. It was the rest of the meal that was somewhat disappointing. I ordered the sauteed green beans and some yang chow fried rice. The fried rice was mediocre...nothing more than average. The green beans, which are usually a favorite chinese dish of mine looked delicious. I got the texture I was looking for, but  absolutely NONE of the flavor. It had no flavor whatsoever. None. Then the rest of the duck was brought out and it was very tender but was nothing out of the ordinary. I haven't crossed this place off my list because it is so close to where I live, but if I would only go there to satisfy a midweek craving for chinese food.",F0nR2cEBLSZtBb2hlxnpoA,0,0,3,kp1HbcgsDHrQZl3k8b7Ccg
3014472,2011-10-11,4,0nlocywsFHQmEt8_xbHNiw,"Chinese food has a pattern; corn starch, MSG, and sweet sauce.  You get the neon orange sweet and sour pork, or the indulgently sweet honey walnut shrimp no matter the Chinese restaurant or location.  You know that there are Mexicans or Cubans in the back cooking the food, and that you always get your meal faster than a McDonald's drive-thru.  

That, at least, was the norm until I stumbled across this quaint strip mall restaurant, once a sushi bar location and now an eclectically decorated Chinese restaurant that broke the mold I so easily cast all Chinese restaurants in to.  It's funky Avatar font sign--not a white box with lights behind it, mind you--that simply states the namesake, with a Chinese stamp-like sign on the large sign pedestal along the road, you would never guess that the food contained within would surprise or even delight you.  Dare I say, but so surely backup the forthcoming claims that this place is, above all else, a delicious change of pace, one well appreciated and happily welcomed.

Upon pulling in to this strip mall, a Little Caesar's on the right and a cash now stop on the left, it seems somewhat out of place and intriguing because of that.  When you enter the tinted glass door you are greeted by a cheery female who is more than happy to seat you immediately.  The half booths, full booths, and few tables contained within are preset with all you need to eat--a plate, a bowl for rice, and a tea cup.  Chopsticks and forks come with the drinks at a later time, and are not the typical wooden throwaways.  They aren't the white slippery suckers, either.  I like that small touch.  

The menu is short and sweet.  There are some regular American choices, like the sweet & sour pork, the lo mien, and the duck.  I am happy to report that the award-winning Peking duck--the one that comes with the steamed bun bread, cut table side (the entire duck, mind you)--is on the menu, along with some nice arrangements of vegetables, seafood, and meats.  I went for the typical fare: sweet & sour pork, BBQ pork, honey walnut shrimp, and green beans with garlic.  With that, the tasting began.

You expect the red BBQ pork sliced on a plate to come out, but nay--theirs is truly smoked, covered in the sweet, clear sauce and made so well that I, a person who hates to eat fat of any meat, ate every piece of the pork, fat and all.  It was lovely and a great starter.  Everything else followed, and everything that lay before my parents and I was presented with love.  A tomato butterfly accompanied the pork, for example, and the honey walnut shrimp lay on the standard shredded cabbage, but was surrounded by broccoli, which made the dish pretty.  It tasted as good as it looked, with a more tart than sweet flavor, but a very light batter and lots of walnuts, which I liked.  The sweet and sour pork wasn't neon orange, but tasted like sauce from scratch and the pork itself was crispy even after cooling down a bit.  The beans were fantastically salty and garlicky, crispy, and had those sear marks from cooking right in a wok.  Overall, the meal was pleasurable, visually appealing, and done just right.

With our leftovers in hand we exited the building after a brief chat with the chef, who is the owner and seems to be younger than I.  What I love about this man is the fact that he wants to get the flavors right and wants to hear directly from the customer.  I had no qualms with the flavor profiles, and praised him for his genius.  After all, I am not easily impressed with the standard American choices from any Chinese restaurant in town.  I hope he keeps doing this, since this is his first break in the restaurant business--I believe this place will do well.

Long Jin is more than the eclectic atmosphere with flowers and plates on the wall, French music playing on the stereo and a woven fat Buddha overhead.  It's the food, done right, done fresh, and well-balanced.  It's the love that you taste in the homemade soups and sauces.  I, for one, am glad to know that there are still those out there willing to make everything and not rely heavily on SYSCO products.

It was a pleasure discovering Chinese food all over again, and I look forward to taking on a few more adventures at a corner table in the very near future.",o68A_3bAJTge-ioGXHdxKA,10,8,4,cEZ_ScDtprpNA9IKnpq73g

The last time I ordered from here I wasn't impressed, however, most reviewers said it's much better eating in than taking out. My aunt and I wanted Chinese food and it's right down the block from her house, I figured why not. I am so glad I did.
The serve you some crunchy noddles and sweet spicy dipping sauce before your meal comes. I saw a lot of people saying there is free hot tea, but we didn't get any and we were offered any either. I' not sure if you order it, then it's free but whatever. No biggie.
We started with the poo poo platter. Very tasty. The spring rolls could have been hotter, they were lukewarm,  and what I thought was the firecracker shrimp had chicken in it. Ew. My aunt loved the chicken and beef satay that came with it. She loved the springroll too. The salt and pepper calamari was very good. I couldn't believe we finished the whole thing!
Since it was dinner time, they had a lot of take out so they brought the rest of our meal as it was done, not all together. First came out the spciy eggplant. We choose mild and I think it would have been better with some kick. It wasn't bad at all, I think it would have been better though with some more spice. The braised shrimp came out next. OMG! This was the star of the evening! It was hot and absolutely delicious. I loved every bite! By the time the chicken came out, my aunt was full and only had a few bites. 
The waitress was lovely and helpful. She kept apologizing because it took a few minutes to give us the bill. It was nice to apologize but truly unnecessary. 
The prices were good, the service was great and the food was really good. Not worthy of 5 star just yet, but a HUGE improvement from my previous experience.
I would not recommend take away, but I will say, TONS of people were doing it when we were there. Maybe it's what you order, but in my experience, dining in was FAR better than take away.",8OeTLey-p-WaL9ErNEci1Q,0,0,4,lAL7s8uNmAOd8KRjY4b1GQ
3517464,2011-12-20,3,0nlocywsFHQmEt8_xbHNiw,"I've been here twice -- both times I've gotten takeout. That's never the best way to experience a restaurant's food, so your experience may vary especially if you dine in. Located in the same plaza as Jarochos Taqueria in the northwest corner or Rainbow and Tropicana, it's a converted Japanese spot with a counter to dine at if you're eating solo. The place is super clean with a modest decor with minimal, but tasteful, design elements.

Service has been quick and friendly on both visits, with my food ready for pick-up after a short drive from my house. I noticed behind the register at the front of the house their computer had their Yelp page displayed, so they do read their reviews.

The food I've had has been hit and miss. Their honey glazed barbeque pork ($8) was delicious! Plenty of tender, sliced pieces of pork covered lightly with a tangy and subtle sweet honey syrup. My favorite pieces were the ones that were slightly charred, which provided the perfect contrast in texture with the slightly fatty meat. Their menu claims it's an ""award winning recipe"". Is it really? I have no idea, but it is amazing and worth getting if you eat here.

The spring rolls ($5) were crispy and filled with a finely shredded veggies. The cashew chicken ($9) looked to be quality meat with a good balance and ratio of protein to vegetables and cashews, but was a bit bland. The beef lo-mein ($8) was clearly my least favorite dish. The noodles were thick and chewy but excessively oily and there wasn't much beef. The dish could have benefited from more onions and green onions. The pieces that were there were also unevenly cut -- some were tiny, others huge. The execution of the dish could have been improved greatly.

Prices are reasonable and because it's close to my house I'm sure I'll try it again. Although I'd prefer to dine in next time to see how the quality of the dishes vary.

I immediately noticed a paper sign noting that pot of tea is FREE!  Choices are oolong, jasmine, and long jin.  I chose the jasmine.  It was nice and fragrant.
I enjoyed looking through the menu but as I was there w/a purpose in mind, I quickly ordered peking duck and a plate of szechuan eggplants.

After our order was placed, the waitress brought out a small dish of crispy noodles w/a side of sweet and sour sauce.  It was a nice snack to munch  on.  Several minutes passed, the waitress ask if we would like to slurp on some soup, which was on the house since the peking duck takes some time.  The choices were the egg drop corn soup or the hot and sour soup.  We both decided on the hot and sour soup.  It came out piping hot and was quite delicious after I added black pepper to my bowl.

Finally, one of the personnel rolled out a cart when the nice peking duck slices and prepared 3 small plates with those lovely slices sandwiched between the nice moist bun, dressed with hoisin sauce and shreds of green onions.  Yum Yum Yum.  after 3 buns, I was happily satisfied.  Few moments later, a big plate of chopped duck pieces came out (the rest of the peking duck), and my eyes were wide, because that portion of duck will feed my bf and I for the next couple of days...yes, there were that many pieces.  Along with the the roasted duck was the plate of szechuan eggplants sauteed with woodear mushroom, bell pepper, bamboo shoots in a spicy garlic sauce, and a bowl of rice.

This was a great dinner experience, and I will definitely come come back with my bf's family to try out many more dishes, such as the tangerine beef, appetizer's platter, etc.

Customer Service was superb: 5 stars
Dinner (Peking duck and Eggplant): 5 stars
Restaurant itself: 5 stars (note:  the toilet paper is so strong and soft, the expensive kind)

We went on a Friday noon and there was only one other table seated (and they seemed to know the owner) so I guess they overlooked the chaos.  The problem was a 6 (?) year old girl running around the restaurant dining room acting crazy, most of the time in her bare feet!  She would lie down on the bench seats and use the remote for the DR television.  Do I have to say more about that?  When an adult tried to turn down the set she stood there and screamed at the top of her lungs until they handed her back the remote.  They never attempted to take her outside or into the kitchen.  I think it was the mom who sat at the front reception area and pretty much ignored us and her daughter.

Long Jin sits in one of those corner plazas with not all that much going on. There's a Mexican joint that I'll probably try soon, there's some sort of casino, and I really didn't notice anything else of importance. I mainly decided to try it because it was nearby so I wouldn't have to spend extra time getting to and back from the Spring Mountain area.

I ordered the beef lo mein ($7.99) from the lunch special menu, which is all pretty typical Chinese restaurant fare. The lunch special includes a veggie egg roll, crispy noodles with a sweet red sauce, and a soup choice of egg flower (my choice) or hot and sour. They were all good, not uniquely great.

The lo mein was a little underseasoned so I ended up throwing some soy sauce on it, and it might be a little too oily for some people, but I didn't mind. The beef was quite tender, which I suppose is expected, again, out of typical Chinese food. I liked the sliced onions but wished that they had diced up the green onions for even portioning.

Overall, I felt pretty satisfied and not hungry yet not overly full. They do delivery within 3 miles for $2 if you're that close and are too busy/lazy to head out here.

Maybe it's because I do love the oil. Our server was very attentive and helpful, he even offered to make all our peking duck buns for us. We both loved his quintessential Chinese accent, he sounded like Po's (goose) father from Kung Fu Panda! 

The service that night was a tiny bit slow because it was such a busy night. This did not bother us at all though, the food was too good that it distracted us. I can't wait to come back to this place again :D",YUzqKt7hmG5BkRykHeZ0gg,3,1,5,_MDoLkyE_flMR3Ddtu4DjQ

There's so many components to this dish and it's really a show when you order it. They slice and plate the duck in front of you. There's the crispy lean skin from the breast. It's important to have this thinly sliced so that it can be easily wrapped with the green onions and bao (the white bread). The remaining portions of the duck is then plated again meant to be enjoyed on its own.  When you put it all together, it's easy to see why this is the beloved dish of choice for most Chinese Vietnamese weddings.

The crunchy mandarin beef is a little on the sweet side, but indulgent and wonderful, and pretty much everything else I've tried has been great. My husband's never failed to eat all of his food and then try to steal some of mine. 

But oh, that duck. Fluffy pancakes, crisp scallions, sweet duck...delivered. For less than $30. Sold! 

We've eaten in store a few times and always had a great experience here. It's clearly a family run joint; often there's an adorable little girl running around. (On one visit she kept trying to quietly change the TV to cartoons and getting in trouble, but it was super cute.) And I'm pretty sure the staff is often the lady out front, and someone in back. 2 people, running a whole restaurant, with food and prices this good. Often the dining room is pretty empty, I think they do a lot of takeout business, but it is still a very clean, relaxing dining room that makes you feel comfortable.

Takeout's usually ready in 10-15 minutes, hot, steamy, and so good. They also offer delivery, but they use a delivery service (who I am not rating in this review, or deducting them points for) that can be kind of spacey. They lost our food twice.

5050060,2011-09-17,8,0nlocywsFHQmEt8_xbHNiw,"My brother from another Asian nation, Andy T. told me about a new Chinese resto that opened up doing a buy one get one free promo so we decided to try it. It's in a older shopping center and inside is quite cute and immaculately clean. 

While we looked through the menu our server brought us small plates of pickled radish/carrot and crispy wonton strings w/ sweet&sour sauce. 

We ordered hot tea and they had a choice of jasmine, oolong or the namesake tea- long jin. It was good quality leaves in the tea so it didn't bother us that it is $2.50 a pot instead of free/few cents what Chinatown places charge for the house tea. 

The menu isn't crazy long, but has a rounded out selection of foods. Portions are pretty generous, prices are about the same as China town area. For food we went with:

Singapore Noodles ($10)- pretty good. Decent curry flavor and was generous with toppings of shrimp, chicken and bbq pork. 

Sweet and Pungent Chicken ($10)- this doesn't pop up on menus in Vegas often so I had to give it a try. It was pretty tasty. Thin sliced and light batter that managed to stay crispy with the sauce. The sauce isn't quite like sweet and sour or quite like orange peel, but a cross between.

At the end of the meal, they gave us sliced oranges and fortune cookies. 

Service was friendly and attentive. I didn't know you had to have some sort of coupon for the buy one get one and when I called to ask if they are still doing it, they said yes until Sept 30th, but no mention of a coupon. However, the server still did the promo since we knew about it.

Really, it should be like that since I doubt way in the NW I get a coupon for all the way down in Spring Valley, but since I knew about it through word of mouth, they got business from it. Business that I think will return for sweet and pungent chicken and other offerings. 

On a side note, they deliver for those in the area. Either through calling them directly it seems or I saw a Roadrunner sticker on their door.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,12,12,4,ota--xTieRqV2DqRRY6y5g

The tea treat along with an unexpectedly clean, modern decor were major highlights of my lunch. You definitely do a double take after exiting the Carl's Jr. parking lot and entering this blissful interior. 

The food was a little hit or miss for us, but even so, I could tell that everything is prepared with great care and attention to detail. The main disappointment is that my entree and fried rice were served a tad cold, which immediately undermined my dining enjoyment. I had the broccoli in spicy garlic sauce, and this sauce would make the average garlic sauce hide in shame in the back room. Too sad that the dish wasn't piping hot. I enjoyed the hot and sour soup, but my husband found it a bit too fermented. Odd, given that he is the Taiwanese one!

Overall, a definite spot to add to the lunch rotation, and I would revisit for dinner as well. It's a Chinese spot that anyone can appreciate, even the P.F. Chang's crowd.",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,13,9,4,gl25ouGkiYJrGtilWj6igA

I placed a to go order for house pan fried noodles. The lady who answered (who I also believe to be the owner) let me know that the price on the menu was not the actual price of the food. While I had thought that to be strange, I didn't care because I was starving.

When I picked up the order in the timeframe stated to me, the food wasn't ready. Not a big deal but the lady then told me that the house special pan fried noodles (which on the menu reads shrimp, chicken, and beef) could only have 1 option. So I was forced to choose shrimp. I was pretty annoyed at this point because they had only started my order when I came to pick it up.

When I finally got back to my office and looked at the food, it was sitting in a pool of grease. There wasn't very much sauce and or flavor for that matter. What I got was oil flavored fried noodles with shrimp and a lot of broccoli on top. I was not happy.

Maybe this is was a one-time boo boo and I've had a rare unfortunate experience. Either way, you won't catch me trying this place again any time soon.",sAEUJb9C6_ekgc8BIScZ5w,1,0,2,CV_OLu6HBiDhhPWnt27hyA
5364385,2014-06-26,5,0nlocywsFHQmEt8_xbHNiw,"First off, this is probably one of the cleanest Asian restaurants I've been to and I've been to quite ALOT since I'm from San Francisco.

Before we ordered, we were greeted and asked if we wanted to start off with any drinks so we all went for a cup of iced water. When it arrived, it was MUCH cleaner than the typical Vegas tap water that 95% of the restaurants in Vegas served. When I asked why this way, the owner, Lily, told me that it's because they used advanced filters that also had UV bacteria killers.

Lily continued to tell me about a new energy drink they started serving pretty recently with the brand ""XS"". She brought out an information sheet for me that compared XS to Red Bull, Monster, and many other energy drinks. XS was much lower in calories, sugar, sodium and calories. I decided to try the pink grapefruit which was amazing and woke me up instantly. Caffeine usually has very little effects on me so I prefer only the strongest coffee I can find but learning about how XS can be healthier because they are extremely high in Vitamin B made me take a look at healthier options.

Onto the food, we ordered the sweet and sour pork, the beef lo mein, rice, seafood soup, honey glazed shrimp and walnuts, beef and eggplants, and fried cream cheese dumplings. The food there was definitely fresh and of good quality which made it extremely tasty. The fried cream cheese dumplings were very crispy and the cream cheese added just the right amount of balance to the dish. The beef from the lo mein was very tender and the eggplants were slightly crunchy on the outer layer. The soup was slightly spicy and tasted great!

I'd definitely come back here for an early lunch the next time I go to Vegas! There were tons of parking spots and although it may be a 5-10 minute drive from the strip, it was nice to be in a part of Vegas that was a bit more peaceful.",FsgjL9No5NxOQF1gUMfvQA,6,5,5,7h5PdEaqaspuHZ8fx-5FDg

In a little she pulled up to the table with a cart loaded with a beautiful display, the big plate was set up with four steamed Chinese buns, with sliced scallions and hoisin sauce.  There were four thinly sliced crispy duck skin pieces placed with a bit of scallion onto the bun with a dab of the hoisin sauce, the smells were terrific and the crunch of the skin with the bun was even better.

I stared at the takeout menu for a good 15 minutes.  It's freakin Chinese food!  I know what I like!!  I didn't know what was taking me so long but I ended up ordering the ma po tofu and house special lo mein.  I then think about how I can't remember the last time I ordered ma po tofu to go as I'm driving home.

NOW I REMEMBER why I don't.  Everything in the takeout bag was a total mess of sauce.  I won't make that mistake again.  The tofu dish was great.  They used ground chicken instead of pork which made it taste a bit lighter than usual and the rest of the sauce that stayed in the container was pretty good.  

The noodles on the other hand were sub par.  I wish I had read Clint B's review before making the order.  I totally agree with his opinion on the lo mein and wouldn't order it again.  Excessive oil.  Chef's gone wild!

The only thing that tasted good was the beef chow fun.  The s/s pork was okay;  and fish didn't taste to fresh, dry but was still edible.  The two chicken plates had a funny taste to it, kind of sour maybe used old chicken.

The guy that took the order also cooked the food.  It took a while to cook the food.

The spicy eggplant had a good texture. It wasn't overly soft and had a good meaty texture that I enjoy, although I wish it was a tad spicier as well. The favorite was the sweet and sour pork.
