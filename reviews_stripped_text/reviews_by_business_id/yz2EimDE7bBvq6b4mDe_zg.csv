Tonight our server was Lidia, she has been here for a few years and like a regular she recognizes you when you walk in the door which to me adds to the whole neighborhood restaurant!

The food order was correct, and what amazes me is she doesn't write it down she memorizes the order! The food was hot and was delicious.",ks1mktI5fNyc0gpINDqFeA,1,1,5,Sj5B2ceVQlXhtLlqHXotcQ
167726,2013-05-01,0,yz2EimDE7bBvq6b4mDe_zg,"I am very familiar with this area, and although it is the not the best, I like this IHOP ok. My food in the morning tends to be fresher than at night for dinner. Since breakfast is my meal of choice, I almost always order breakfast. Not to fond of their dinner choices, although that would be an unfair judgement since I rarely order it. I didn't like the fact that when I went in for an early morning breakfast, the waiter charged me for my coffee, but when I was in their the week prior the waitress didn't. That was bothersome to me, however didn't warrant me making a comment about it until now. I do not have a problem paying for my coffee, but if that's the case, charge me for it every time or not at all. As far as the service goes, the waiters and waitresses rarely communicate with you and you are pretty much left to fend for yourself. They are not friendly at all, no matter how friendly you are to them. Then again I go there to eat, not make friends. They could all benefit from a good seminar to teach them about customer service. Overall, it was an ok experience, but the food is definitely better than the service.",3V04SQJp0KARGoS3upJHPw,0,0,3,Nw9iPJs6FxmyAoo-73ZBJg

When you have a hankerin' for breakfast at 3 PM but you can't be arsed to mix up any pancake batter, you go to IHOP.  It's not the best stuff in the world, but it's cheap, fast, and when you're in the right mood it can be the perfect thing to sate you.

Anything located on Boulder Highway is special though.  Boulder Highway is like a little land that time forgot.  The sweet sounds of Journey and Kansas can be heard floating through the air.  The wait staff at this particular IHOP all have one thing in common:  A distinct lack of urgency.  Or quickness.  Or...well, caring.  I don't know if if was our lack of mullet, but my friends and I spent 2 hours there yesterday.  At 3 PM.  It wasn't full.  Two full hours is far too long to be in an IHOP.

2665863,2017-05-31,0,yz2EimDE7bBvq6b4mDe_zg,"I am giving this IHop a mediocre review for many reasons. First off, the food was as expected. It was good, but nothing exceptional. It did its job by filling me up, so there isn't much to complain about in this category. I got a savory breakfast crepe and my girlfriend got a sweet crepe combo that was served with sausage, eggs, and hashbrowns. Our food was served hot and arrived in a timely manner. My crepe was simple enough to make at home. My girlfriend's crepe was delicious, but small. I can understand the size of her crepe because it is accompanied with more breakfast items. Unfortunately, the service wasn't the best. Our server did the best they could with (what I noticed) a large section during a busy holiday morning. The server was nice, but forgettable; however, my coffee stayed hot and filled. I did have to snag coffee creamer from neighboring tables. I cannot complain about the server. They were friendly and weeded at the same time. They did their best. I wish the host stand did a little better. The hostess seemed uninterested in working. She walked us past at least five empty 'two-top' tables and sat us at one in the back corner that was still being cleaned, soaking wet, and missing silverware. She plopped the menus on the table and hurried away. The table stayed wet without anyone noticing. Nobody walked by for me to ask for help so I took matters into my own hands. I was happy about the timeliness of the service and food, but I never saw a manager in the restaurant. I wouldn't have mentioned anything about my experience. I have worked in the industry for seven years, so I understand that sometimes things don't go according to plan and employees don't always perform their jobs at their highest capabilities. I will return to this Ihop. I encourage other people to dine at this Ihop if they are nearby and are craving a decent sized breakfast. They even have a girl who makes balloon animals and paints your face! All in all, I spent $23 in total on two meals and two coffees. As a college student, this is exactly the amount of money I would like to spend on a breakfast. Next time, I am sure the service will be better.",hozbmvGx-rIhUkJ060U3nA,0,0,3,GT_0ZZLOcnQpPWMODpoJlg

IHOP. Dependable for breakfast. Service was adequate but considering the area, I was quite satisfied with this place.

A couple things to note... Strong institutional coffee, only non-dairy creamer, there is buttermilk added to omlettes, great BOGO coupons are avail in the local coupon clippers (thanks mom).   

If you need to grub then this IHOP can fufill that need. Not a great neighborhood but like another reviewer, this place does not necessarily reflect the sadness of the area.",6Ny9NaRMNlLTPZHjOOsz4g,0,0,3,h0o8GcfA1pEJNwfy_6F4-g

All served with a smile...food was hot and just what I had been craving.  I am fortunate..I live close and will most definitely be going back for this great breakfast.  I also tried it as dinner one night when the steak is served with broccoli and mashed potatoes.

Total dining time at this IHOP was an hour and a half!  There was one server, Christian, and one cook in a dining room of probably ten occupied tables.  While both Christian and the cook did a great teamwork job, there is no reason for a restaurant to be this short staffed. Several times the cook came out with the prepared food and delivered it to the waiting table.  During our visit, there were no tables cleared, and many were dirty, and several times the cook came out of the kitchen to tell incoming patrons to go elsewhere, as the wait for their food would be two hours or more.  When it came time to pay, Christian told us the system was down and we could only pay cash. I had an IHOP gift card and was not allowed to use it.  So, I gave Christian $30 in cash for our tab of $26.30.  He went in to the kitchen where between he and the cook, they made the change of $3.70. Absolutely unacceptable!

If you're ever in this exact area, you know how tough of a neighborhood this place can be.  But I find myself out here often and when it comes to finding a place to feed my belly, sometimes IHOP will just have to do. 

First of all, this place gets pretty busy on Fridays.  I think most of my visits here have all been on a Friday. Known for their pancakes, but they are just okay.  What I actually come here for is their Steak Omelet with hash browns extra crispy.  Not the healthiest breakfast/brunch, not the tastiest, but still enough to satisfy me until my next meal.  

Service is spotty at best in my opinion.  They have someone that serves strictly drinks and another person for food. Nothing can be more frustrating than being hungry, wondering what their specials are, and the person that first serves you drinks telling you that they don't know.  My other issue is that their diet Pepsi machine is always down.  At least it has been down my last 3 visits.

I came here back in april our waitress was I believe bianca she was energetic fun an memorized 10 different orders an didnt screw up!!! Well this time way different. .. our waiter was great didnt mess up buuuutttt as I was eating my ""big steak omlet"" I found a short black hair! So I told him he took it an brought me a fresh new one... but would your appetite still be there? Nope not mine also by tbe time I got a new one everyone I was with had already finished smh. So he didnt charge me for it. Well we went to the front to pay... I asked for a manager & let her know how pissed I was.  he failed to let manager know what happend which is wrong. An also the cook was there with no hair net an a beard (blk hair just like the one in omlet) he was staring the whole time I was telling manager what happend. She gave me a extra $13 off sorry but I think the whole tab should a been given back . An I did still tip waiter. Next time im in vegas I will not b going here.

Food is ok but we come here because it's a great place to eat and chill with a big group after a long night.  Servers have always been nice and patient with us being loud and sometimes un-decisive.

As one who is trying to keep my weight down, I order nothing but the spinach omelette which also comes with buttermilk pancakes and you can add your choice of toppings for an additional $1.49.

I also tried their sirloin tips recently.....eh stay away from it, wasn't that good.",6kvGowEk1AvUUwWHLkJyNg,1,0,3,xpXA-hBD81idkcQ3iT1C5A

5259120,2018-01-30,0,yz2EimDE7bBvq6b4mDe_zg,"I decided to stop in to this IHOP chain on a Sunday after church around 10 ish for their never-ending pancakes. I love IHOP and I love their pancakes but this location lacks so much of the IHOP Essence and brand that it really needs to be shut down. Upon arrival the restaurant was half full and it appeared that the wait staff was moving about appropriately. After being seated it took my waiter 15 minutes just to come and take my order and I was a party of one. After about 45 minutes of waiting after my order was taken I finally received my order of two pancakes, a side of hash browns, and bacon.   My pancakes were ice cold I never received any syrup for my pancakes, the hash browns were ice cold and the bacon was burnt. I had to wait an additional 5 minutes for my waiter to come by so I could send my food back to be cooked or reheated just so it was edible. After about an additional 10 minutes I'm waiting for my food to return , it finally came back to the table and the pancakes were burnt Pitch Black but the hash browns were warm. At this point I just simply gave up and realize that this  establishment really cares less about customer service and the food that they present to them. I can truly say that people should avoid this location because their food is disgusting, their wait staff is absolutely slow, and their customer service lacks luster.",yS1kK5EGcwatp6D6hFGvlw,1,0,2,Ri7atcAt_fUQLDw5PPeZXQ

The food was expected, standard ihop food, no surprises there but the service was exceptional!! Our waitress had a huge smile on her face and was willing to make as many adjustments to our order as we requested.
We stopped here on our way from Las Vegas to Grand Canyon and were in a bit of a hurry. When we mentioned this, she went out of her way to have everything come quickly and even helped refill our water bottles for the trip!

I was a bit apprehensive about stopping at this iHOP after looking at the bad rating but it ended up being a great experience!!",Hwcui0Lv5pCSmhAcr5Gluw,0,0,4,kuVW16grlcSm8bDOGVhmAg

The waitress we had seemed to be overwhelmed and somewhat irritated. Its a chain food diner so u can't expect anything exquisite.

We were seated immediately as we walked in and our orders were taken. However, as always at any ihop it took a while to get the food. The waitress was nice but also kind of forced like she was annoyed at her customers and the restaurant was practically empty. Lol

I ordered a full sampler as the whole meal because that's pretty big amount. And a banana berry crepe. All pretty good and came out to be 18 along with OJ.",Jne7UiKCp_VsSsvh-utyQw,0,0,3,Cp0ZgjD2BbBB49Q7hbHzhA
5846123,2015-09-18,0,yz2EimDE7bBvq6b4mDe_zg,"I've mostly come to this location later at night, typically from 10PM-1AM. The few times I've been in, the waitstaff have always been very friendly and attentive, and the food has been good as well.

The only reason I'm giving this location 4 stars is because the last time I was in, I ordered the Bacon and Blue Cheese Sirloin. My gut instinct was to get something with pancakes, like usual, but I saw the sirloin and couldn't stop myself.

I should've listened to my gut.

I ordered the sirloin medium-rare. What I got was definitely well into well-done territory. In their defense, these are fairly thin cuts, and even a small mistake could push it over, but regardless it was slightly frustrating. The blue cheese was very, very strong. I love blue cheese, but I ended up scraping it off. Imagine what blue cheese made in a lab might taste like, and you've got an idea. The garlic bread was great, and the potatoes were fairly good, but I've always liked their garlic bread anyway.

Overall, I'll still be coming here, but I'll probably stick to pancakes and omelettes in the future.",ul3cgWVJNJ3-glSFC1pi0g,0,0,4,qvVeRSWFZJeR_ZZ2ZMEJFA

It took a while to bring mine and my husbands burgers and he got just a plain ol cheese burger but it's fine whatever. When the hostess/ food runner brought out my burger it was the saddest burger I've ever seen. So the menu says it comes with two onion rings, crispy bacon and bbq sauce.. it came with no bacon, one onion ring and like two dots of bbq sauce. I asked the hostess/food runner for more bbq sauce and she literally rolled her eyes and went uhg. The server brought over my bbq sauce and that's when I told her what my burger was missing. And she is the reason I'm not giving it 1 star because she was so nice about it. Her name is Prashawn and the way she handled it and how fast she was to fix it made me feel better about the situation... the hostess/ food runner at 2 o'clock on Sunday Feb 18th was very rude. But prashawn was really sweet. My burger still sucked tho. It was cold by the time I ate it and was over cooked. And I got like 5 fries. But the water was good. It was very cold and didn't taste like tap so that's good I guess.",V2H8UoM0fhMStAFc0XNVtw,0,0,2,GN3pG9Z9qIDUYCeyTLu1Kg
