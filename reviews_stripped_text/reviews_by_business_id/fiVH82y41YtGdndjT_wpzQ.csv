They just throw the chicken in the fryer. Why don't they make it when they see that people are coming in and there's a line to buy their chicken. This the reason people come to buy here because it suppose to be fast. This is why the restaurant does not stay open long. People get tired of waiting. If I have to wait this long I would go to a fancy restaurant.",lNgXUk-DM9pE7F6daI85oA,0,0,1,_3JWxRcV5lsCfNUX3lbwVg

There is so much feedback that I had to yell to be heard.  Like many other reviews I had to wait for the chicken to be cooked.  I asked for honey - got none.  Asked for mild chicken - got spicy.  Was asked to pull forward in the drive thru lane to wait for my food.  I asked where they wanted me to park,  she said to just pull ahead.  I pulled forward leaving a lot of room for other cars to go around us.  The thing that I am most upset about is the snotty drive thru girl that delivered our food.  After delivering our food she lectured us on where we should of parked.  First of all I parked where the other girl told us to park.  The two cars that came after us has PLENTY of room to leave.  Maybe you should worry more about getting orders correct than you should worry about where customers park.  Also if you EVER had food READY to serve maybe customers wouldn't have to park ALL OF THE TIME!!!  Never going back here AGAIN!!",UIlFmRAJ2D2iag3y2uNFZg,0,0,1,JxsEHLGvFRu1XpiralrHTA

Craving Popeyes chicken since I haven't had it in a month since we used to drive to Durango & Warm Springs just to get it!  This location has been open a week.

I was disappointed at first when people who ordered after us were getting their food and eating.  There was a extra large cook to order in front of us and when it was ready the guy wasn't even paying attention to his number being called so I politely repeated the number in the dining area.  

Then some of our food was being assembled and this other person with large order wanted her second mash potato and they removed it from our order. Finally after 20 minutes of waiting we were next.  I checked our food before leaving and it seemed only like warm but did not want to wait again. 

Opened the bag and took a bite of my tenders they were cold!  Ugh, put everything back in the bag, grab our coats and head back there.  We explained the chicken is ice cold.  A really nice woman helped us her name started with the letter ""V"", I cant seem to remember her name.  

She replaced all the chicken and sides for us, hot out the oven while now it's a quarter past eight PM and we head home the chicken smells amazing in the bag.  The chicken was piping hot, and my jambalaya is hot too.  She gave us a leg and a thigh for the trouble and she was a sweetheart and very understanding person.  She's a curvy woman with a big heart.  She made it all worth the second trip.

I just finished my leftovers from last night and if you debone the chicken it heats up fast in the microwave while still tasting flavorful.  Can't thank Popeyes enough for impressing us as customers.  Happy New Year to y'all.",_ykg4Fp8j_tU83q2tYC2FQ,3,2,4,7gqoC5wuI6znA9dVjLNN0w

So if you follow my most recent reviews on Popeye's you already know that I have been on the hunt for the best location that can offer great customer services coupled with the best quality food. 

This newly opened location is right off Flamingo and 215 attached to the Chevron gas station. Since my mom loves Popeye's just as much as I do we headed over last week with our meal deal coupon for a 10PC chicken with the choice of tenders or mixed (legs,thighs,breast,wings). Tenders it was for this visit and with a fresh to order request we were parked right out front and had our food brought to us in a reasonable amount of time. 

Everything from the wait time all the way down to customer service we felt put this location in the top spot. The question now though is are they better than the Warm Spring & Rainbow location.. I believe they are tied but distance wise I can get to the Warm Springs & Rainbow location faster from home.

I've been to this new location 3 times so far. We have only used the drive thru. The service is polite. The wait times are normal for a Popeye's (maybe even a little faster). The food has been hot and fresh each time with the exception of some french fries that were lukewarm. Most recently we ordered the $20 box of chicken with 2 large sides and 5 biscuits. It was delicious and a good value. My only complaint is that the large mash potatoes had about 2 tablespoons of gravy.

I had to repeat it a couple of times but that didn't bother me. When I drove up to the window to pay, I was handed 3 drinks. She took my payment and I told her I should have 4 drinks. I noticed my food in a bag sitting next to the register. The A/C was blowing the bag. When I asked her for the 4th drink, she picked up my receipt, looked at me and said. ""This is to much"" and she walked away WITHOUT giving me the food. I was shocked. I wasn't rude at all I just simply said "" shouldn't I have 4 drinks?""  She NEVER came back. Another employee walked by, looked at the food, smiled and kept walking. I couldn't believe it. I waited a few more minutes (6 total) and no one came to give us our food. My husband got out of the car and brought the drinks inside and spoke to a manager. The manager said "" what do you want me to do?"" My husband, not to happy now, said he wanted a refund. The manager started the refund and in he middle walked away to take a customers order. In the mean time, 2 other cars at the drive thru drove off without paying and without their food too! We finally got our refund and I took the survey in the receipt. I was honest and when asked if I wanted to be contacted I said yes to explain it in more detail. Still haven't heard from them.
