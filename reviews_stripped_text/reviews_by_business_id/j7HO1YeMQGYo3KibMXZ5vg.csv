Kalua pig was good,  lau lau was a little dry,  squid luau didn't have the sweet coconut taste and the luau leaf wasn't cooked long enough. The lomi lomi salmon tasted great, Mac salad had enough mayo,  poke was good but I've had better.  I wouldn't try the Hawaiian plate again but I did try the Mahimahi sandwich and it was crispy in the outside and moist in the inside.  Quality is average.  I would eat there again.

I'm a big eater and I struggle to finish the heaping plate of thick juicy steak at Island Flavor. The Kauai Cafe teri beef was tasty but the portion was like a mini plate for $10.76 out the door. I had to go directly to the nearby Carl's Jr to have 2 bacon guacamole burgers right after because I was still so hungry.,Mf4RAiWyGAs7LoMOaVksEw,1,0,2,sIgj7Ku5a3uyNyT88U4Zhg

The poke was on the daily special so we thought we'd give it a try. They give a pretty good amount for the price, but it was not fresh at all. It had a pretty fishy taste and you could tell it had been previously frozen or something. 

We also ordered the bbq mixed plate which came with char siu chicken, teri beef and kalbi. I was totally looking forward to trying the char siu chicken and was totally happy with it. It was the best part of the plate in my opinion. We will definitely go back to try other things.

599030,2014-02-24,0,j7HO1YeMQGYo3KibMXZ5vg,"I've heard a lot of rave reviews for the Kauai Chicken, so I had to try it for myself. I decided to do a takeout. It was Tuesday around 11:43a and had only 3 people there, two one one table and a single diner. I waited about 5 minutes then my order was ready. I couldn't wait till I got home, thinking about the great chicken I was going to devour. I got home and opened the cover and had 1 quarter piece and 1 thigh. Took a bite of the thigh and almost spit it out. The inside never look fresh and it was really oily. By oily, there was a ton of cooking oil at the bottom of the plate. I took a bite of the quarter piece .. the drumstick to be exact and it tasted the same. The meat fell off the bone, but it didn't taste freshly cooked. It looked like they fried the chicken ahead of time and then refrigerated it until someone ordered it, then put it in the fryer again. The color of the chicken meat wasn't white, it was a greyish color. I know my chicken and that chicken wasn't cooked fresh. That's why my order was given to me in less than 5 minutes! The only thing I enjoyed was the mac salad .. not too much mayo and the mac not overcooked. The rice was perfect and just enough. Only problem was the main dish. I hope these guys not cutting corners since the restaurant should be busy around this time. I hope they shape up before it's too late cause I want to see them succeed because they the only one close to where I live. I normally take the long drive to Ross J's or Island Style.

Hard to find at first, they are on the west side corner of Hualapai and Trop.  Avoid the poke like any other place they just use frozen tuna and mix some things in there.  Whatever not worth mentioning.

Great that they provide a choice between rice, fried rice and noodles as your starch.  On weekends they have a Hawaiian plate special with everything.  Chicken Long Rice and Squid Luau could have been a little better, but still they put the effort in with Lau Lau, Kalua Pork, Lomi Salmon and Poi!

Menu is small, but the food is good enough to eat there once a week.  Definite difference in quality here as opposed to other places.

857266,2013-01-13,3,j7HO1YeMQGYo3KibMXZ5vg,"Finally, a Hawaiian spot in South Summerlin!  

I was a little afraid to try this place.  The location was previously inhabited by two failed Mexican restaurants.  I figured the spot must be cursed. But, rejoice all, I think this place will last.   

Although sparse and plain, the cafe serves up some pretty decent Hawaiian fare.  The menu is nowhere near as large as places like Island Flavor or Aloha Kitchen, but they seem to have a handle on the classics. If you're looking for Lau Lau, however, you're out of luck.

I tried the Kalua Pork & Cabbage ($10.95) which came with two scoops of rice and mac salad. Unfortunately, I found the rice a tad wet and mushy.  Maybe they need a new rice cooker?  But, otherwise, I thought the pork and cabbage was divinely moist and flavorful.  Just add a little Hawaiian chili water and dig in.  I also appreciated the macaroni salad that wasn't caked in mayo.

I also ordered the spam musubi which came freshly made and piping hot.  I would definitely order it again (it was a pretty big brick for $2.00). Prett-eh tasty.

I'm gonna keep my fingers crossed that they start serving Lau Lau (hint, hint, nudge, nudge, Kauai Cafe). Then I'm in trouble.",gq8dZgJConBUANpSFzKKjg,6,3,4,h5WdywUV8TDIeB5FiwfIJA

Oh. TMI.

Point being, Hawaiian culture fascinates me, and even though I haven't been (yet) I find Hawaiians (and Pac Islanders) to be attractive not just in looks, but in personalities and in their cuisine!

Our foodventure last week took us to Kauai Cafe, which looked fairly unassuming from the front. Another hole-in-the-wall joint, one may say. But step inside, and you'll find what makes Kauai Cafe so ono.

I love chicken katsu, but it was a heavy battle between that and a platter called ""Da Surf Rider"" which basically is a Hawaiian fried seafood platter. I went with the less expensive of the options, the katsu, and thank goodness I did because the portions were HUGE! Emijandro's kalbi short ribs were practically falling off the plate as was my chicken. It was served with macaroni salad and the option between fried noodles, fried rice, or steamed sticky rice. I was trying to keep it healthy but since I had already spoiled that with chicken katsu, I went with the fried rice. Another great choice, as the fried rice has the usual accouterments, but also has bits of fried Spam (that ono Hawaiian treat!) mixed in. It was a fun and tasty addition to the usual fried rice one might find.

I thought the chicken was a little bit on the dry side, but the katsu sauce rectified that problem. Overall, a mighty fine meal.

So why the five star rating? I believe in Hawaiian slang you would say it's because of Da Kine Service.

The server (who may be an owner or related to an owner?) was super nice. He chatted with us for quite a bit, telling us about Kauai, which I found fascinating as Emijandro has been, but I never have. He talked about the experience of moving from Hawaii to Las Vegas, and the fact that like every other person that moves here, he never really suffered from allergies until hitting the 702.

The fifth star that sealed the deal came a week later, chatting with Emijandro in the car about the experience. Apparently behind where we sat (she could see it, I had my back to it), a homeless man was being shown island love: he was fed a warm meal, and they offered him one of their t-shirts to wear as the weather was starting to cool off and their t-shirt was heavier than the one he was wearing.

That, my braddahs and sistahs, is doing business right. Return trips are already being planned, even if it is way out past where the 215 wraps around the side of Vegas.

(OK, screw TMI -- any Hawaiian, Samoan, or Tongan men, I'm single and ready to mingle. We'll go to Kauai Cafe together... heh.)",8prr02BTumjFLYSLmMpO1Q,13,11,5,E53vzIPntU4ev72SWgfdjQ

As a person allergic to pork, :( there were a few chicken and beef options.. 
I did make an excellent choice, I had the short ribs. They were delicious. I chose the side of mac salad and the fried noodles. I did not realize when I ordered it had pork in it. I found out I can order the noodles without pork and will do so on my next visit. 
My DH had the fried chicken. He loved it. The chicken had great flavor, super crispy, crunchy and fell off the bone. We also ordered the waffle fries. They were the star of the show. Perfectly seasoned, and crunchy. It was gone in seconds. 
The restaurant is spotless. The portions generous. The prices very reasonable.
The two suggestions I have is bigger plates, for these huge and generous portions, and a steak knife.

I gazed the menu board and hand held looking for some Hawaiian fare.  ""WTF"", I thought to myself as none could be located.  I sent the boy back outside to tell me what the front of the business said.  I asked the gentleman behind the counter, how long that had been around, he said, "" We have been here since 2004.  The boy came back inside and said, ""Dad, we are in the wrong place.""  It was then I realized we were in a China-a-gogo and not the Kauai Cafe.........Awkward.

Starting over again, we went one business over and ended up in the right place.  Now...I knew I was in the right place.  Cool tunes and good vibrations, we were able to eat.  It looks like a stand and order king of establishment but we were told to find a seat.  From them on we sat as our order was taken and drinks refilled.  The service was friendly and we hung out for a while chit chatting.

The menu looked awesome with all manner of tasty island eats.  The boy went Chicken Katsu.  It came with the Mac salad and rice, but you can get fried noodles instead.  The chicken was deliciously moist and well protected in it's crunchy panko shell.

It went with a Kauai Cafe signature dish called ""Da Surf Rider.""  This plate was awesome!  It contained coconut shrimp which were of decent  size.  One of the more tastier coconut shrimps I have eaten.  Continuing on the plate had macadamia nut crusted scallops.  These were not huge but also very tasty.  Then there is the teriyaki beef.  Thinly sliced and a true compliment to surf and turf presentation.  The mac was good and the fried noodles were da bomb!

I absolutely love the oxtail soup. The broth is so rich and flavorful. It's served with a side of minced ginger, that when added to the soup, gives it that little bite and a pop of freshness. The meat is fall off the bone tender. Mouth watering. 

The barbecue chicken plate lunch is also choice. I've honestly been so addicted to those two dishes that I've yet to venture out! They do a traditional lau lau with poi and haupia and more.

My family and I dropped in for an early dinner tonight, hungry of course, or as my dad likes to say...""we da Flemings and we HUNGRY!""...in that Clyde Klump voice. Lol. I think our family had a fair spread of the whole menu tonight. The menu isn't too big, yet its not too small. You have your breakfast items, your specialty items, main mix plate items, burgers and sandwiches, and sides. The prices weren't too bad either.

Dad and the lil bro had the ""Linaka's Mix Grill"" which consisted of Teri Pork, Char Siu Chicken and Kalbi. I didn't get to have any, but it looked really good, and of course will be my first pick when i go back. 

I had the ""Kauai Chicken"" which is  Quarter hind chicken dipped in Heinikein Beer batter, and deep fried. Ohhh man...this dish as we like to say in Hawaii, was 'Broke Da Mouth!"" meaning DELICIOUS! It was so juicy and crispy on the outside. I will def be back for the chicken. The mac salad was a little bland for me. It could've used a little more mayo i think, and since the rice was still cooking I got the fried noodles instead (which was pretty good). 

Most plate lunches comes with  your choice of Rice, Fried Rice or Fried Noodles and Mac Salad. 

 Out of everyone that was there with me, these were the only two that stuck with me, so I decided to share. The rest, well its up to you to find out.

Now let's look at Kauai Cafe. The server was awfully kind, the kitchen staff look like they enjoy their jobs, AND THE INSIDE OF THE PLACE IS SUPER CLEAN. I can't emphasize enough how sick I am of walking into restaurants that are super dirty -- especially most Hawaiian places.

On to the food -- the portion sizes and the quality of the food is pretty good. I shared lunch with my co-workers and from what I remember I ate some kalbi, teriyaki chicken,  and pulled pork; all of which were quite tasty. If I had a complaint, it would be that the rice itself was a bit mushy but it happens.

Being I have L&L right next to my office and love their offerings I figured I would give Kauai a chance.   My only regret is not finding/trying this place sooner.     L&L is good but Kauai was out of this world.  

I ordered the Kauai chicken and their homemade waffle fries to go.   On the drive home my car smelled so amazing that I had to open up the bag and at least try a fry or two.   I was excited to find that they are cut thin (the way I like my fries) and crispy.   On my first bite the flavor exploded and I was immediately hooked.     I must have had about half the order by time I pulled up in front of my house.   

I grabbed the food and walked inside and instead of my normal ritual of changing out of work clothes getting comfortable, I immediately opened up the chicken and took a bite.      The meat fell off the bone and just like their fries the flavors were going crazy in my mouth.        

The portions were huge, which I have hard all hawaiian restaurants serve huge portions.     I am excited to have the other halves as leftovers as soon as possible.

Never one to doubt Yelp, I ordered the fried chicken platter with fried noodles and macaroni salad. ($9.95). I went to run a few errands and picked up my order shortly thereafter.

When I arrived at home and opened the box, I audibly exclaimed, ""Holy Moly, that's a lot of food!""  It was- a HUGE quarter of chicken (thigh and leg) and another thigh, a nice serving of noodles, and a little container of macaroni salad. 

Biting into the chicken, I think I actually gasped. This was seriously the best chicken I've had...maybe ever! The coating was amazing. Not too thick or bread-y, and it had a delicious, sweet flavor. The chicken inside was hot and juicy. The noodles were also pretty good, lots of cabbage with them. The macaroni salad was okay, but nothing to rave about. But that chicken!!!

It amazing thinking about close twenty years ago first moved Vegas could count with two hands local style restaurants in the Valley outside of downtown (California Hotel). Now too many too keep track of and talk about competitive market. The best part is not only competitive but spread across the Valley and blessed think now have few options in my area. Kauai Cafe is the latest one. It just recently opened so the signage out front is work in progress. Never judge book from its cover because once you get inside feeling the Aloha spirit and literally family run business (The dad/son run the kitchen; his daughter runs the front). Decor inside tell Hawaii pride from the Hawaii state flag and kealii reichel pictures. If you from Hawaii know who Kealii Reichel.

The food since first time not sure what I wanted but ended up going for the Kalua Pork Poor Boy with Portuguese bean soup for my side. I ordered side of fried noodles just because wanted try more...The Portuguese bean soup was good. Talk about hearty soup. So much of the good stuff Portuguese sausage, noodles, beans, and vegetables quite literally one spoonful of broth. The fried noodles I could have just had whole plate of noodles. Just like back home with the charsu action, the noodles, and great sauce. The Kalua Pork Poor Boy talk about mean sandwich. I had my reservations because Kalua Pork is Kaiua Pork and Cabbage. I happy that went outside the box. It stole the show, The Kalua Pork was nice moist, topped with bbq sauce, and the citrus walnut slaw brought it all together. I know might thinking pulled pork sandwich but I felt like nothing like it. Sure sandwich would order again again.

The staff or family truly exemplifies the aloha spirit. John the dad presence very much felt outside talking too customers. He checked up on me next thing know talking stories about they use too run same place in small town outside of Seatttle, WA. Got tired of the weather whole family moved too Vegas. His son is the chef of the kitchen, daughter takes care of the front of the house, and his daughter best friend one of the servers. Truly not only feel the aloha spirit, just the passion they have for the food, and making it authentic local food. Also like is signature dishes that will make return visit. It authentic but with their own touch. The portion sizes any other local plate nice size and nothing more bang for your buck then local food.

What else you get other than the lau lau and kalua pig? Some  haupia like a coconut gelatin. Poi, pounded up taro just add sugar if you dont like the taste, I don't usually. Squid luau, its green but just try it. Chicken long rice, lomi lomi salmon, poki, rice and mac salad. I finished eating one on my own then went back to work with a smile on my face. 

The Island burger looked good too and came with thick sliced potato chips made right there. Oxtail is delicious and perfect now that its colder outside, read my other review or just try it haha. Its tender and what I've been craving for the last few weeks. Could've sworn they were open today but looks like I have wait a few days.

Trust me when I say order anything and everything. When you go, tell me if you notice how good it looks. I don't know how to explain it, everything looked bright like I was looking out of a HD lense. LOL I don't know I'm weird.

Service is always excellent.",vWP8-aQX0rYJszqkWVL7Ew,9,9,5,A6KSXujacvoiteYq4MORqQ

I've been on this Hawaiian food craving for about 2 weeks now. I saw this place driving to my dad's place and saw all the good ratings and pictures and had to try it out. 

I walk in and it's pretty empty, yay not wait. I wanted to try ""da surf rider"" which had coconut shrimp, macadamia scallops and teriyaki beef. However, they said that they were out of scallops. No worries, my go-to dish always is the Kalbi ribs with a side of Kim chee. While I waited for my food, I was reading the menu and it had the story of how the restaurant is commemorative of the owner's mother. I support family owned spots and you know they put a lot of love into their cooking. About 10 minutes later, I was on my way home to enjoy my food. 

I lifted the container out of the plastic bag and it was so heavy. Mind you my Kim chee and macaroni salad were in smaller separate containers. So much freaking food. The meat was cut up into smaller pieces for easier eating, but if they were in bigger pieces, I would have had 4 large pieces of Kalbi. Places usually only give you 3. The meat had a good proportion of fat and meat. The marinade was good and not too sweet. The macaroni salad didn't have too much mayo which I like. And it was really peppery and garlicky, which is also a good thing. I wish the Kim chee was a bit spicier but I still ate it. All this food for $15 and I didn't even finish it. Now I have lunch for tomorrow.

2898854,2013-01-04,6,j7HO1YeMQGYo3KibMXZ5vg,"Mahalo Nicole for finding this place, and I have to say this place is a gem!    I have to admit, it was quite a drive from Henderson to get here, but I wasn't disappointed at all.

Kauai Cafe is tucked away next to a gas station at the Smith food and drug shopping center on Tropicana and Hualapai, and has one of the cleanest open kitchen I ever seen in Las Vegas.    

I made a big mistake of coming here after the gym, because I was damn hungry, and went off ordering a bunch of stuff.   One of the best things about Yelp is how our members will post menu of most establishments, and what caught my eye the most was their Kauai friend chicken.     Don't get me wrong, I almost change my mind a few time because of the other mixed plates specials, but I'm glad I didn't.

From what I notice, Kauai Cafe will let you make a choice between white rice, fried rice or fried noodles at no extra cost.    I ended up with the fried rice, and it was loaded with spam, char sui, peas, carrots, and green onions, and of course it was made to order.    The rice was a little too sticky, but hey...we're from Hawaii, and it was okay.     The mac salad was good, and ate of all of it, but the Kauai fried chicken was a HOME RUN!     Think of a Huihui brine Chicken, with a Manapua man fried chicken crust.    It was juicy, and had a slight huihui chicken sweetness to the meat, but how the Heineken beer was  infused into this recipe was ingenious.    I have to rate  this chicken a 5 star winner, and I would drive 30 miles one way just to eat this again.      

I also ordered the Portuguese bean soup ( $2.50)  and it was better than Island Flavor, it was okay but I wouldn't order it again.       

What dropped my rating down from a five to a four was the Madasada.   Don't get me wrong the bugga was good, and had the perfect crust (which is nearly the same as Leonard's in Honolulu) which had a slight crunch to it, and lightness for most of the madasada, but the very middle was still cold.    I believe they keep the madasada dough in the cold storage, and it  wasn't completely thawed out, but  I still enjoyed it, and for some reason the Madasada was still good and moist the next day.     Yes,if they fix this....watch out Island Sushi, there could be someone in Las Vegas who might top you folks on Hawaii's favorite doughnut.     Again, it's a very easy fix for them to do, and my rating will shoot to a high five if get let it sit for a little while.    

I'm a  fan of this place, and will make another drive to check them out again.",ePWsbOWDTJcgIus-BFuKpg,10,9,4,2x28zLwuhP0Ksl0vRceeAQ

The folks here are so nice!  
...and they like talk story too... so settle in... order some kaukau and talk story for a bit.

They also do take-out and ... NOTE... there's a 20% off coupon for ""carry out"" on the back of the Smith's receipt.  (Smith's is the anchor store in the strip mall where KC is located.) 

Ok.... back to the restaurant and the food.  So, it's family owned and run. Like I said really nice folks here.  

It's a pretty small place... I think there are about 7-8 tables of 4, so if you bring a huge group of friends or the whole fam damily... you might be crowded a bit if they are busy.

We lucked out tonight... wasn't super busy so our group of 7 was able to sit together... 
They did separate tickets for us too which is a plus!

I enjoyed the Kauai Chicken... now I don't normally like fried chicken but this was not your ordinary fried chicken.  The batter was super light and crispy and NOT greasy, and had a really good flavor and held the moisture to the chicken.  They give you 2 huge pieces of chicken so I took half of my meal home.  It also came with either steam rice, fried lice or fried noodles.... I opted for the noodles and it also came with a scoop of mac salad. Noodles were really good and could be their own meal all on their own.

Mom had the Oxtail Soup.  She was a happy mamma.  It was a big portion too.  AND it came with 2 scoops steamed rice and a scoop of mac salad.  So, I took one of her scoops of rice home too and she took 1/2 of her soup home.  I got a taste of the broth and it was rich and flavorful.  I can see why she likes this.  It's definitely comfort food.

And then there was the malasada.  They made them FRESH for us.  And they were only $1 each.  Did I mention they were FRESH as in hot out of the fryer?  Oh man... FRESH is the only way to enjoy these bad-boys.  Broke-da-mouth good.  :)

I drag along 3 of my coworkers and we come here to try the place out.  I see lunch specials at the front door and get excited.  Here we go!

We sit down at a booth, the lady there is very nice and friendly.  We get waters all around.  A few minutes later we order.

Friend 1: ""Da Surf Rider"" with Fried Noodles.
Friend 2: ""Da Surf Rider"" with Steamed Rice.
Friend 3: ""Kauai boy Breakfast"" with scrambled eggs and potatoes.
My Order: Teriyaki Chicken with White Rice, 1 Spam Musubi and 1 Malasada.

Food come out shortly later.  In the meantime I notice the place is nice and clean with ample seating.  The lady checks on us multiple times and gives good service.  That is awesome.  The moment of truth comes when our food does and we begin to eat.  

For my personal experience, with my Teriyaki Chicken, it was a nice sizable portion.  It came out nice and hot and was very flavorful.   
- The chicken tasted good.  Was this chicken sitting in the teriyaki marinade?   It is probably just me though.  It isn't settling well with me.  Maybe I am spoiled with the chicken breast choices from other places around town.  It definitely isn't chicken breasts, I'll give them that. 
- The steamed rice was perfect.  They gave me two scoops.  They are from Hawaii, they should know how to cook it. :)   I, again, wish they had a brown rice alternative.
- The macaroni salad was OK.  The macaroni was a smaller and thicker than what I am used to but it was just me again as I would have preferred a healthier choice like a green salad instead.

The malasada was just OK.  It was a little to hard on the outside, but when I bit into it was nice and soft.  It tasted good.  But, I hit an actual cold spot in the middle of it.  :(

The spam musubi was good.  One side seemed to be a little watery from sitting in its on steam.  Happens.

My friends loved ""Da Surf Rider""  It looked delicious.  My other friend liked the Kauai Boy Breakfast.  He commented on how he didn't need ketchup to finish it.

In the end when we were ready to pay, we were a little confused with the prices of the food.  I thought I was going to get the lunch special price.  But then, when other people came in and started ordering I heard that the lunch special price got half portions.  I wish I would've known sooner.  I happily paid full price because for what I got, it was a fair deal.

I will give them a try again soon.  I see ""Da Surf Rider"" in my future at least. :)   I also need to give their loco moco a whirl.

Awesome people, great service.  Probably just me because I wanted more healthy choices, but otherwise GOOD food.

I really wanted to love this place and give them five stars.  Really.  But, I have to be honest in my reviews.",dLrMDYQ9TwfodJxYLfaKDQ,3,1,3,tmZ105g1-Ov9I_xU5gQoiQ

So my favorite thing to do when I visit Hawaiian food places is to order the Loco Moco, it determines if I will go back usually. The presentation was very nice, it was clean and layered well with the rice, patty, gravy, and egg. They also topped it with some green onions (you can see it in my picture). My other two friends got Fried Chicken with Fried Rice and Chicken Katsu with rice each of which came with a side of macaroni salad. We also got Spam Musubi on the side. 

Onto the taste, my Loco Moco tasted dry, the patty was over cooked, there wasn't enough gravy to counter the dryness between the patty and rice. The egg came over easy, but I usually prefer sunny side, not sure if you can have them change it or not (but it doesn't hurt to ask). Overall I was disappointed with my Loco Moco. I honestly haven't found a place here in Las Vegas that could top it back in Oahu (Zippy's anyone?). 

I believe my two friends were happy with their food choices. The Spam Musubi came with mayo in it, which to us was weird as we don't usually see that, but it was still good. I sampled their macaroni salad and it was a little too salty and watery for me, I normally love macaroni salad so I was disappointed with this as well.

The overall experience was okay, I won't be going out of my way to come here though. If I happen to be in the area and want Hawaiian, then sure, but outside of that it's nothing special.",dM1HHK4szA5Qs6NSAaEk1Q,3,2,3,3vQ9B2bA4hmxd-ZSUKVoOA

I also loved the slaw on my po' boy for the same reason - nicely tart, lightly mayo'd (if there was any at all). You can get fries, mac salad, or onion strings with the sandwiches, and the onion strings were dangerously addictive.

But luckily was worth it for some local Hawaii kine grinds!  Seriously ONO eats.  You like Island Style, Island Flavor, Aloha Specialties?  Kauai Cafe is right up your alley especially if you live in this remote part of town.  Westside!  

Came here with the wifey for a nice dinner out.  Because it is kinda on the outskirts of town, it was relatively empty in the restaurant with mainly folks coming in for take-out orders.  But don't let this fool you, majority of Kauai Cafe's patrons come in during breakfast and the lunch rush, and from what I hear keep the place busy.  

Back to the food.  It was a Friday night, and I really should have got the Aloha Friday Special...the Lau Lau Feast!  With lau lau, kalua pig, lomi lomi salmon, chicken long rice, squid luau, ahi poke, macaroni salad, 2 scoops rice, and haupia..all for $16...how could I have gone wrong?  But I wasn't THAT hungry!  Ah, next time, next time!  

I settled for Linaka's Mix Grill, which is a combo plate of kalbi ribs, char siu chicken, and teriyaki pork with 2 scoops or rice and a scoop of macaroni salad.  Buggah was pretty ono!  Kalbi was marinated good with a nice hint of sweet and fat, char siu chicken really had that char siu red going on, and the teriyaki pork was juicy.  And my rice was cooked just right to absorb all of those lovely meat juices!  With some shoyu, pepper, and Tabasco on my macaroni salad I went to town.  Finished all of it.  The wifey had their much talked about Heineken Beer Batter Fried Chicken, and she wasn't sorry.  Wow!  I had a bite and almost didn't stop.  That Heineken really adds a nice punch to the batter, and helps keep the chicken nice and moist!  Good stuff.  I just wish it came with 2 hind quarters instead of just 1!

Hopefully the Kauai Cafe keeps on with a good clip of people so they can stay in business.  Seeing that we live kind of far away from this restaurant, I don't think I could make the drive there on a weekly basis.

Mom had an island burger and said through muffled bites, ""this is a pretty darn good burger!""  Dad was quite pleased with his juicy burger and fries as well.

It was unanimous that the mac salad was the BEST we have ever had.  The white rice was delightful (which some may think is silly for white rice - but it is the good starchy short grain stuff).  The fried rice was very good; little treasures mixed in such as spam.  The noodles were meh.  I wouldn't order them next time.  The kahlua pig was perfect, the kalbi was fatty, tender and flavorful and the chicken was juicy and cooked perfectly.  The chicken was described as beer battered but it has a very sweet crunchy batter.  I'm not sure what kind of glaze they add.  It was good - but a surprise.  

I haven't seen the inside yet but I'm familiar with the small location in a little strip mall in front of Smith's.  A perfect spot for a diamond in the rough.  Our food getter did say she had to wait around 20 minutes for food.  I don't mind a wait if quality results are produced.  I considered stopping there last night on my way home from work but thought it might be too soon.  Like an addict...determining the appropriate time frame before hitting the sauce again.

Maybe tonight?  Yum!",DPtOaWemjBPvFiZJBi0m8A,1,1,4,-4YUC-DrP_hkw9tbwtKWqw
4054689,2013-04-15,8,j7HO1YeMQGYo3KibMXZ5vg,"Came here for dinner recently and what you'll find here is your basic Hawaiian dishes.  Kauai Cafe is located off Tropicana and Hualapai (the Westside).  Upon reviewing the menu, the one thing I noticed is their prices.  Price here isn't too bad.  Dinner for two will set you back only about $20, which is not bad in my opinion.  The selection is decent and it's pretty much what you'll find at other Hawaiian location.  However, the one issue with Hawaiian food out here is that there's a ton of them and I have my favorites already.  So let's get to the review. 

As for their food, I got their Loco Moco since it's one of my favorite dishes. Plus, I wanted something with a huge protein count.  In case you're not in the know, a Loco Moco consist of rice, hamburger, eggs, and gravy.  KC mixes their gravy with mushrooms, which was a good touch to be different.  Seems boring, but I have one word for this order...delicious.  This order filled me up, but I wasn't done. I always get a Spam Masubi or Katsu Masubi at least once when I hit up a new Hawaiian joint.  KC didn't have a Katsu Masubi, so a regular spam it is.  I was little disappointed with KC's spam masubi only because it was small, not as tightly wrapped, and the spam was a bit undercooked.  

The restaurant is small, cozy, and the staff is extremely nice.  The owner's dad even stopped at our table to chit chat for a little bit.  Okay, a lot of bit. But he's cool and just added to our dining experience.  

I want to say that Kauai Cafe is just okay, but I really haven't tried anything else.  I still have their Kalbi to try (even though I stole a bite from TR), their Katsu, their Heineken battered chicken, and Ahi Ahi (can't remember if they have that one).  From the minimal amount of reviews so far, it's their Kahlua Pork that they are known for.  It's going to be tough for me to judge that one since I don't eat much pork.  I'll still make my way back to try the other dishes I missed.  Who knows?  Maybe my rating drops to 3 or goes up to a 5 based on my next couple of visits.  But as of right now, I'm just a fan.

My loco moco had over-cooked eggs and the beef patty was devoid of flavor. The gravy was bland too. 

The won ton soup was decent but I only found one won ton. 

Crunchy noodles, kalbi and macaroni salad were okay. 

There is only one person cooking so be prepared to wait a little bit.

I would come back, but how can you mess up a loco moco?

I got the wonton min and the hubby got the chicken katsu with rice and Mac salad. He also ordered some spam musubis! The wonton min was tasty, but I wish there was just a lil more noodles. Chicken katsu was ok, not that big of a fan of katsu but my husband enjoyed it.  The katsu sauce wasn't in our bag so make sure you ask/check for it.  The spam musubi has that mayo like sauce which is in sushi so it was a bit different but good.

Being Filipino, a lot of their dishes are similar to what I can make already but why go through the effort of having to make it myself when I'm on vacation and someone else can make it just as good?

Add to the fact that I can get my fix of Lilikoi here makes my decision just that easier. The proprietors here are so friendly - I always seem to talk to the one gentleman with the goatee.

They have a Facebook page which updates their specials and their closures due to equipment malfunction or family death.  I was planning on going and they just happened to be closed those days.  They are also closed on Mondays.

They had a limited menu.  I ordered the Kalbi Short Rib Plate($10.95) and the Won Ton Min ($8.95) to go.  They offer a Military discount like many of the other Hawaiian restaurants in the area which saved me a few dollars.

The 3 strips of Kalbi was served on a bed of raw shredded cabbage.  There was one large scoop of rice and a partial regular scoop of macaroni salad.  The texture of the macaroni salad was a little grainy, like it was whole wheat.  It was pretty tastless compared to other Hawaiian restaurants.  The Kalbi was grilled medium and was tough and fatty.

The Won Ton Min had about 5-6 won tons.  They were very bland including the broth.  The saimin texture was also a little grainy.  It was garnished with sliced fish cake, char sui, spam, carrots, cooked scrambled egg, and green onions.

The Katsu was pretty good can't go wrong with deepfried goodness haha & the Mac salad wasn't overly creamy.. 

Spam Musubi like most places are premade.. I thought the rice was too mushy so I'll probably pass on this next time..

Da Surfrider- 4 star. The coconut shrimp is SOO DANG GOOD. It was way better that Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. and other places. 
The breaded mahi mahi was OK for me, and the mac scallops were alright. The bulgogi was a bit on the salty side for me, but, that shrimp tho. The garlic aioli sauce was out of the world good, though I thought it was tar tar sauce the entire time. I stand corrected. 

Saimin- 5 star. I think this is the best simian I've ever had...and that's comparing to many food spots in Honolulu, including Zippy's. I don't know if that's even a compliment. 

Oxtail soup- 2 star. I was a bit disappointed with the dish. The broth was a bit too salty, maybe too much bouillon cubes in there, I'm not sure. The oxtail was a bit hard, and wasn't as soft and tender as I had hoped. 

Chicken katsu- 5 star. The batter was good, and it was crispy golden brown without burning...I was impressed. This might be one of the best chicken katsu's I've ever had. 

Spam musubi- 5 stars here.

Heineken beer batter chicken. It's a solid size hind-quarter. The chicken has a nice solid crunchy skin and still moist and juicy on the inside.

Portuguese Bean soup. man I wish they served this as a main dish instead of a side order. I look like a fatty when I tell them I want a big bowl of this. My dad would've loved this.

We were greeted warmly and almost everything on the menu looked great. I decided on the kalbi plate and you get mac salad and a choice of fried rice, steamed rice or fried noodles, I chose steamed rice. My dining companion opted for katsu chicken. 

While we waited our server came out and chatted with us for quite a while and he was so nice and personable. Our food came out soon after and our jaws dropped at the generous portions. I enjoyed every bite and I had more than half my meal packed up to take home with me. I was stuffed and so was my dinner partner. 

Great big portions of delicious homemade food for such a low price, I look forward tk coming back soon.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,11,10,4,Uvg3uwi9dETuLQ4iJwQsFw

So good. I was rollin solo so I only ordered the short ribs, awesome. Portions are really large, ate the other half the following day for dinner. Except the mac, cause my chunky butt loves it. 

By the looks of it, I'm assuming it's family owned, support your small biznazz. Everyone was super friendly and helpful.

Can't wait to be hungover again so I can be cured with their island love.",fcb3NvbGr9qaPPLUlSnk6A,0,0,4,xv8pK8HvrbdlA7QdpSZnvw
