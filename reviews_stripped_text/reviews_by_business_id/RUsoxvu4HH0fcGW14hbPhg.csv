There is this one time that Iam able to get 1 pack each but I got so disappointed because there's no cheese inside the bread..but there's cheese outside :-( .. so I thought maybe the baker just forgot to put some inside and he thought he did so I let it passed... then just yesterday I got the chance to get another pimiento bread and Iam eating it right now... well there are pimiento again on the outside of the bread when u looked at the plastic pack..iam so excited to get the first bread on top but to my dismay..as I was chewing it,oh my the first bread totally doesn't have a cheese..inside and out :-( so I threw it).. now my 2nd bread , theres cheese outside and inside..it was totally good..on my 3rd bread,only cheese outside and nothing inside... and this bread per pack are almost $4.. im not gonna crave for this anymore because I felt that I was DECEIVED for the second time with this bakeshop.

For the owner and manager:  just a piece of advice... if you like to keep your customer.. please maintain the quality of the bread even if the prices get higher that's ok because the customer will understand that but if the quality got low and not as expected as before you will lose us and your business.",-zA4hZRJKRZqG1mDxguiFw,0,0,2,I0bGxOHHtbBf4EPtZ2uu3g

Service is below average. There is only 1 lady working and she takes phone orders apparently so she'll ignore you while on the phone even if you're already standing there. Between the phone ringing and us ordering 2 boxes of goodies, the line behind us grew from 1-2 people to nearly a dozen!

Shop is tiny, so it may get a little stuffy if they have a lot of people. Don't let that deter you though, because they have lots of good filipino goodies and foods like Pancit Palabok, Empanada and more!

My sole purpose was the Spanish Bread [Butter and sugar on the inside. Reminds me of my grandparents house which they always had] You can grab one or two for $.99 each or grab (I believe) a 6pk for a couple bucks. However, I just grabbed a couple of them and of course some other goodies to take home. 

I grabbed the Cheese Roll $0.99each [The taste reminds me of an Ensaymada, but shaped like a l, topped with sugar, butter & cheese] Donut 3for$1.25 [literally called donut in the case. lol. looks and kind of taste like a Malasadas but the textures a little different. Definitely tossed in sugar! YUM!] and lastly, The fried veggie lumpia [carrots, bean sprouts, cabbage and onions], HUGE and comes with a vinegar dipping sauce which i personally loved!

2616132,2017-05-11,6,RUsoxvu4HH0fcGW14hbPhg,"Conveniently located next to Seafood City, you can find all of your favorite Filipino carbs here! Turon, puto, leche flan, bibingka, you name it, Valerio's has it! My favorite though, has to be the fresh pandesal. If you come early enough, you can get a bag full of pandesal fresh out of the oven. It's best when eaten right away, but they also make for a good breakfast or light afternoon snack.

During my most recent visit, on top of the two dozen pandesal, I also picked up kalamay ube, and from behind the glass, I chose a banana cue and ube flower. I was able to control myself and tasted everything once I got home. The kalamay ube was definitely my favorite of the three. Growing up in a Filipino household, kalamay ube is a treat that I am very familiar with. The sticky rice flour dessert reminds me of my childhood and the days I would spend at my nana and papa's house. It's served with shredded coconut that is toasted to a nice golden brown color. The coconut gives the kalamay ube a little extra flair with the crunchiness. The banana cue is just like turon (banana lumpia) without the wrapper. It's a deep fried banana/plantain drowned in a brown sugar glaze and put on a skewer for mess-free eating. Lastly, the ube flower wasn't as amazing as I had hoped. It was a little dry and it wouldn't have been as good had it not been for the sweet glaze drizzled on top. It was good for the price I paid!

I love Valerio's and will always remain a fan of the pandesal. If you've never been here and you love pastries, this is definitely a place to check out! It's a small bakery and can tend to get really crowded at times, but it's worth the 5 minutes of claustrophobia.",CqeLXgQUpMZNbz4GwBz87w,7,6,3,GszUigOPGoC_C68cLDDO0Q

Expect that nothing is healthy here. But the baked goods are not bad. If you ever come by seafood city, make sure not to miss this bakery. 

 The ube pastries are a very sweet flavored dessert that is one of my favorites. I enjoy the turon which is a fried egg roll dessert with banana plantains. The egg roll is also coated in a sweet honey like substance that give the texture of the egg roll a smoother taste. 

 The service is good and the prices are on the cheap end if you consider 3-5$ cheap for desserts. I feel that the bakery could be bigger, I felt crammed inside and there were barely any people inside. 

 In conclusion, this place has good desserts for a fairly cheap price and the service is convenient. I will be coming back here sometime in the future. I would suggest you give it a look as it is worth the try.",o1QAhT9-HOVzyso46he00w,7,6,4,LqqMkHzJAJ-GtHIG2upU2g

One friend's parents called in an order 24 hours in advance, and said friend was not allowed to pack very much in his suitcase because he had to have enough room for all of the bread purchased from this bakery.

This is definitely not a place any las vegas partygoer would be able to find...because it is about 20 minutes? off the strip.

Decided to accompany my friend over to this bakery because there was so much hype surrounding his order...the staff here are quite nice and will take the time to explain what their most popular breads are and what's in them (even though ingredients are all listed on the packaging).

I got the ""siobao"" which is very similar to a cha shu pork bun that you could get from dim sum spots, but larger and not necessarily with that same style of bbq pork.

Also tried a red bean bread and that was tasty as well.

Quick Tip:

1) Cash Only
2) Located next to a seafood supermarket

I also tried this bread that had sweetened coconut in it and a type of sweet frosting (forgot the name...sorry!) on the top that was also really yummy.

We then proceeded to check out our items and we asked May if there was a certain bread that they carried and she was very short with us as if she did not want to assist us. We felt very rushed for no reason, mind you we were the only customers in the shop. As we walked out of the shop we noticed that we did not receive the correct bread that we asked for. We then told her about the issue and she gave us a very rude, disrespectful response about how she had shown us the order before putting it in the bag and continued rolling her eyes.

3698208,2012-06-18,1,RUsoxvu4HH0fcGW14hbPhg,"I have to say that when it comes filipino pastries Valerio's is the way to go! Maybe a month ago I probably would have knocked a star for only accepting cash, but now they accept credit cards! An extra star for convenience! There are so many great pastries to choose from! From prepackaged to fresh off the oven pastries! 

Looking for a quick lunch on the go? I'd suggest their bread rolls filled with pork, chicken, and beef asado or adobo. It's really just like a sandwich in a roll. 

When it comes to their sweet delights, I'm a sucker for their bibinka, spanish bread rolls, and their cheese rolls! But! If you're craving for these delights as soon as their open, come disappointed because they're usually not freshly offered until 12 noon, or mirienda time (which is snack time in tagalog!). Their cheese rolls are filled with this cream cheese like filling with a soft, sweet, and slightly sugary outter dough. The spanish bread is a soft bread roll with a nice butter and sugar filling inside. A decent combination of bread and sugar to steer you away from diabetes or an overly sweet explosion. It's just right! The bibinka is also good! Soft breading, enough cheese, and just the right amount of salted egg slices (bibinka ain't bibinka without the salted egg slices. It's all about the slices.) 

Their empenada's, siopao, and pan de sals are great too! Best part about their pan de sals is that they come in regular, cheese, and whole wheat for variety! 

Prices for the freshly baked goods in the casings usually range from $0.75 to $2 s which i think is a good deal for an afternoon snack! Prepackaged goods are also at a decent price ranging from $3 and up with a decent amount of pieces in them,",a48HhwcmjFLApZhiax41IA,4,2,5,dv3r-CSIBSydA905jLlzYw

These Valerio's bakeries offer a variety of bakery items and some I have not even heard of like ""Haba-Haba"" (a 14-inch long Filipino baked pastry with special fillings such as cream cheese, coconut, or ube, and cover coated with butter and sugar), and I've never heard of ""Kepeng"" (old fashioned Filipino cracker topped with a brown sugar coat)... what about this clever name ""Cheesemosa"" LoL! (circular loaf filled with some unique blend of butter and cream cheese). You will find an assortment of your favorites here such as ensaymada, mamon, pan de leche, mocha roll, pan de sal, and lots more!

The store is not that big and could get crowded easily. Now we know where to go when here in Vegas! :)

So let me expand on that...Yes, my pronunciation is all OFF however that is what your index finger is for, so you can POINT.  I'm all about trying new things, I'm also from San Diego, with that said, I've had my fair share of fine Filipino HOME cooking over the years.  Valerio's has been here for awhile, never ventured into the store until my co-worker came back w/....DRUMROLL PLEASE...Adobo Pan De Sal D-E-L-I-C-I-O-U-S.

Very small store, but it is stocked with homemade Filipino baked goods, both savory and sweet.  Clean and nice staff, but let's talk about this Adobo Pan De Sal though...it is a freshly baked bun STUFFED with pork adobo.  The pork has the perfect ratio of sweet and savory, so tender that it easily breaks apart as you bite into the bun. 

That slow breaking of the bun, you know when you pull apart fresh bread and steam rises as you pull apart.  (sorry, I was drooling) YASSSSSSSSSSS, that is the total effect, and that's what you get with the Adobo Pan De Sal.

I've a also tried the vegetable lumpia and a dessert dish (plantains wrapped like lumpia, fried and drizzled with a sweet syrup.) Both delicious

There is lots more to offer, these just happen to be my go-to's when I go.

...but this is just my opinion, check it out for yourself!",ikEbNrDG-0Qtmo9FFb2qwg,5,1,4,ZcaKBiqjntS9GfKSC27JuQ

We walk in and it's fairly empty, the cashier just stares at us, no smile offered not even a polite hello. So we proceeded to browse the store, I then asked her if they had fresh pandesal and according to her they only make their breads in the morning. I grabbed a bag of pandesal and cheese filled bread. She rang it up and then informed me I had to get more things for the $10 minimum if I wanted to use my card. This irritated me even more because I rarely carry cash, I was forced to grab and spend more due to their required minimum UGH! The worst thing is knowing that I will probably be back at one point due to the lack of Filipino bakeries in Las Vegas. Best believe I will have cash the next time I come though!

For those making an effort to see some of the city's ethnic bakeries Valerio's Tropical Bake Shop on East Maryland Parkway is easily overlooked given a location tucked away next to Seafood City, but with a strong local clientele of Filipino's frequently filling the small space a first look showed the goods to actually fare quite well, though service proved perfunctory while the haphazard layout is likely to annoy any with even the slightest degree of claustrophobia, OCD, or any sense of Feng Shui.

Cited more than once by the health department for concerns of food handling, but recently implementing standards to prevent such things according to one of the store's owners, it was around 4:45pm that a visit was made to the bakery and with some items tasted immediately with others preserved for breakfast the next day a total of six items were selected, the total tallying a mere $10.90 with an extra Turon thrown in as a gift, the freshly fried pastry a touch oily on the surface but undeniably delicious as banana presented creamy and molten within.

Having spent some time watching locals make their purchases in order to decide what was best, or at least most popular, subsequent tastes of Valerio's goods continued to show restrained sweetness amidst soft textures, and although the long loaf was little more than bleached flour with a stick of cream cheese beneath frosting both the 'cheese flower' and sibling smeared with purple yam were yeasty pillows packed with natural flavors, a similar dough seemingly featured in several prepackaged bulk items with fillings of red beans, mango, and nuts.

Going 'off-the-board' for the rest of the order, neither item selected by any in the line of fifteen before me, those looking for something a bit savory would be well advised to take a look at the package marked Hopia Mongo, each two-bite morsel chock-a-block full of pureed yellow beans beneath a flaky golden shell, and for those who want something truly unique the Kalamay Ube should fulfill any such desires, the tray of dark purple sweet rice offering a flavor not unlike sweet potato pie with a container of toasted coconut adding just enough nuance to keep the taffy-like texture from getting boring with later bites.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,7,8,3,IcOuNkUskKEmtHRyJXVGqw

5517553,2018-04-30,2,RUsoxvu4HH0fcGW14hbPhg,"I'd drop more stars if I was rating off of mood. Over time, this place has annoyed me more and more. As a Filipino who has frequented many Filipino bakeries through the course of my life...Las Vegas does not really have a solid oh shnap Filipino bakery. We have bakeries that will simple 'make do'. Bakeries that will simply seem like the best option because what option do we have? 

Honestly, it really isnt all that great. Their biko/kalamay/puto/kutsinta whenever we purchase it ALWAYS has some weird taste to it that you know is not a taste you'd get had you cooked it yourself. I've even joked to my husband ugh, I can taste the embalming fluid in here. It is a joke, people. But if perservatives is what they add into their baked goods...my tastebuds are all over it. Which is why we never purchase those items from there anymore. I have a solid place for our fix for such desserts elsewhere.

The Spanish bread kills me. I rarely buy it...but when I do...it's because my kids want it. I've had AMAZING Spanish bread from Hawaii so my expectations are high. Living here, I make-do. BUT! Purchasing something a few times over enough to realize that the filling is all the way to the side of the bread and really you're just paying for bread...is just the way of life here? No, I'm done. (See pictures). Also, we've experienced more dry breads than most times. The only bread that hasnt disappointed is their ube bread. Kids love it and its graciously stuffed. Note, this Spanish bread is Filipino version. Not to get it confused with actual Spanish bread elsewhere.

And the service? Sometimes you get it friendly and sometimes the cashier looks at you with judgment. I dont appreciate that feeling. You'd think as a Filipino with all our fellow judgey Filipinos we would get used to it? We don't. It pisses us off more because we are conscious of such attitude. I've seen better days, though, can't lie. 

But 4 stars? Naw. Not anymore. I tried being positive but getting ripped off isn't fun anymore. Then try going in there on a busy day...you basically have to stand in line and grab as you move along because taking the time to browse and assess your life situation may become hectic since there isn't adequate space when busy. 

And people...please do not bring your seafood city grocery cart in there and stand in what ""corner"" they have. There isn't much room for all that. Other than that, this place def gets business. Where else are you going to get your Filipino treats so conveniently especially after grocery shopping. Personally, I'm over it. However, def give it a try! 

Strollers and shopping carts be advised.

I never was really a sweets gut till I met my fiance, now I cannot resist getting the ube filled buns and couple of bags of pandesal.  This place also has siopao, the Filipino version of manapuas for my tropical peeps and baos for my Chinese kin.  The fillings are slightly different too and more closely related to Chinese style.

Oh and the ensemadas are on point as well.  Hard to overcome the urge for good old fashioned homeland cooking.  The trick is to buy ube ice cream and make an ice cream sandwich with the whole wheat pandesal, bam!  Instant Bliss Baby!  

Not much more to say about this place...they got you traditional bibingka, puto, buko rolls, cassava cake, leche flan, etc.  But if you are looking for halo halo, tapioca or ginataan, you may need to go elsewhere.  They may offer it at Chow King and Jollibee just around the corner inside Seafood City.  The place is real small and can only access it from the outside and is not connected to Seafood City.  

The staff is friendly, but just be cultural aware that if you are one of them, the language barrier and other cultural issues can lead to miscommunication.

It's different texture, different taste and unlike the purple potato it really retains a bright purple color. Now, us Filipino's like Ube anything. Bread, cookies, ice cream, candy, chips, you name it - they probably make it in Ube too.

Now that you are a little bit more familiar with Ube, let me tell you about these Ube Rolls they make. They are always in the glass case and sell for only $0.75 each. Man, oh man. If you catch these freshly made, they are soft and moist and topped with butter and sugar (never a bad thing) and filled with the most delectable ube inside. It is just barely sweet but you have the sugar and butter on top to balance it out. 

Ube doesn't sound like the thing for you, you can't go wrong with their cheese rolls also sold for $0.75 each as well. These rolls do not hold up long so I suggest only buying one or two, and then plan on consuming within the next day or two.

They also have a pretty solid siapoa there. A couple of different varieties but I always go with the chicken. It's bun is soft and sweet and moist and the inside is super flavorful. They come in a package of four and as long as you keep in the fridge, they hold up pretty well. 

Now let's talk about the true staple in every Filipino's household - Pan De Sal. The perfect bread for breakfast or dinner. They are good but would be great if they carried the mini size I love so much more.

They also carry puto and every other traditional pinoy bread item you can think of. This is great place to go for fresh, authentic product.

Definitely a must try.
