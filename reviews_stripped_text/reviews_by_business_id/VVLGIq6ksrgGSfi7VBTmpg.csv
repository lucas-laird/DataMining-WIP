I have never experienced a Cronut before but this would be the place to try one for the first time. Yum. A wide selection on the menu and my husband could watch the football game.",7nf0b6RTjQJy6fj44LwMMg,0,0,5,FbstY2NLECULQ4A0XtI7rg

The wait staff has always been polite and friendly. There is also a huge sculpted map of the US which is fun to look at. I would have given this place 5 stars but on our last trip we decided to try it for dinner instead of breakfast. While it was not bad, the ribs I had for dinner were just so-so. The rest of the group agreed that breakfast is much better here.",zal57frRjy6RtAVz3xYMGQ,1,0,4,_TWQsWeOyC66S9kdsqTlnA

They do a nice job of serving you ""stick to your bones"" food to help absorb Vegas alcohol. The ambiance is pretty cool, and the food is not bad. It sort of reminds me of an upscale Perkin's or Denny's in the heart of a Vegas casino. The service is good, and they have a bakery area where you can buy donuts to go relatively easily. It isn't my go to place in Vegas, but it isn't bad when I just need comfort food.",HiKDQz-yPvda0kNV8LgC3A,1,2,4,52ioirTfTWVqfpt6EbZZcA

We ordered the Sundried Tomato Wrap, Pretzel appetizer, and the Rib-eye special.  The only two suggestions - supply Diet Pepsi or Diet Coke versus Diet Rite (doesn't taste the same) and the artichokes in the wrap were a bit over-cooked which made them inedible.  Other than that, we loved our time here and will return.",kOPRX94rDBXEPmLBZNG7RQ,1,0,5,FqOw49j4iCLFjF4Z0LA2dQ

Never a bad experience, so we keep coming back. On our last visit, the waitress was one of the best I've EVER experienced anywhere - she was just stellar. We left her a fat tip, well deserved. Will definitely be back.",bzapbb28xMO0NE9oRK27gg,2,2,4,bvbt5hnRL8AIT0L63DfdIg
