I ordered the country fried steak and my friend orders the pecan crusted chicken. The portion sizes were huge and way too filling. Like bad. The best part of the meal was the side of mash which was very good actually. My friend hated his order and barely ate it. We managed to leave with stomach aches that lasted only for an hour or so.

The service was friendly but they seemed overwhelmed by the amount of customers. Prices were on the cheap and maybe so is the food. One note, we were told by others that breakfast is the only thing to order here..... 

Then next morning we did the buffet....why....",0adDwsv83ONdvTUahsU94w,0,0,2,Ay9S5RAyUua4Ruf2XwXSVA

The first time I got corned beef hash, a dish that I'm incredibly picky about.  It was good enough to add an extra star to the review.  
My second dish was grilled salmon that I took to my room.  It wasn't particularly good but it wasn't all that bad, either.  The baked potato that came with it was baked properly, another important factor for me.
The third meal I got was standard eggs, bacon and hash browns.  The eggs and bacon were decent, but the hash browns were sub par.  The orange juice I got with it was pretty good, though.
I never got really good service, but it wasn't terrible.  Had to wait a long time (for no apparent reason) to be seated on that last trip, though.  This was only bothersome because there was a lot of open seating.

Although they are nice people, the service is extremely slow (the place is just too big) and the food comes pretty cold.  I think that has to do with the fact that the kitchen is in Camelot or something because it seemed like a long way to go for the orders.

So, in summary.  Nice service, expensive and cold food, cavernous atmosphere, and no Cholula.",c1LmkHeWbwIoLgW6a63UiQ,0,0,2,MH96h2CL8TgtfV6H2AXzKA

Brunch here was a chicken fried steak - I thought this was pretty good. Yum! The batter was just like fried chicken - just the way I like it.

Gave this a go the first morning we were in Vegas, I went in with high hopes because I hadn't been in quite some time, about 5 years to be exact, and like I aforementioned the menu was more appetizing than for breakfast at least, but to my surprise it shrank to nothingness. UGH! 

The service was mediocre, as was the food nothing to go home and brag about that's for sure WAIT! there is something to note our actual server did happen to help us use a coupon for 5 bucks off there, by adding and giving us blueberry muffins to go (at this point I was willing to try everything to make me have a better experience at this place, ha!).

Here's a quick list of the Pros and Cons of this restaurant....


PROS: 

The food! The swiss cheese and chicken sandwich is excellent! Very tender chicken, with a pesto mayo spread and all the fixings.  Also served with huge pickle and very good fries

Paying the cashier up front; you don't have to wait for your server to keep coming back to you for the bill and then back with your change or cc.  

Huge seating area, this is a must especially in a big casino like the Excalibur

Friendly servers and cashiers.  

CONS: 

Nice, but SLOW service.  

The line to get into the cafe especially during peak times can stretch out into the casino floor. 

You don't really know who your server is, one person comes to take your drink order, the other takes your food order, one person delivers it, etc.  But as long as you get everything you need, I guess it doesn't matter huh?  

Definitely a fan, especially for the chicken sandwich!",y4PtwWnmiz8Q3H3D8Xsy_w,7,6,4,aOazqSTWYYAcsWaWDECSOw

Well, one thing I noticed in my brief stay in Debauchery-Land is that the restaurant selection is surprisingly poor. No, I don't want to pay $30 for an all you can eat steak buffet ok? This option out, you are in for some limited choices. 

The Sherwood Cafe however is your standard breakfast place, except with a Keno board on the wall. The prices are somewhat high ($10) but what can you do eh? They serve typical breakfast and lunch attire and vegetarian options exist.

And lets face it, can you really beat a $5 cheeseburger with all the trimmings AND fries? I didn't think so! Hey it was a pretty good burger too ...

I wouldn't bash on this place because most 24 hour cafes in Vegas casinos tend to serve decent fare at a very reduced price at night that's hard to beat even if you go to McD's where there's no service involved.

2669283,2008-08-19,0,KJsGM_gLm597KEJ95PUfsw,"On a recent trip to Vegas I found myself in dire need of some breakfast one morning....and, strangely enough, breakfast was not easily found.  It happened to be the middle of the week and apparently breakfast service at most places stops at 10 or 11am on weekdays.  And we all know that in Vegas there aren't many times that you're up and about early enough for that!   ; )  Now...  To anyone that knows me, a dire need for breakfast is not a rare occurrence.  Breakfast is a MUST for me, regardless of whether it's 7am or 1pm...if it's my first meal of the day it's gotta be breakfast....breakfast is KING.  And, having said that, I was willing to go to the ends of the earth...err...the strip....looking for it.  : )

I first checked out our hotel (Luxor) and, alas, we were too late to find breakfast there.  But....according to our handy little travel booklet from the airport shuttle (btw, these things are VITAL) there was a place in Excalibur next door called Sherwood Forest Café that served breakfast 24 hours a day....WOOHOO!  My kind of place...  : )  Unfortunately for me, that 24 hour-a-day breakfast service was about ALL this place had going for it and my bubble would be quickly burst....

Our food arrived and I realized immediately that it wasn't very good at all...definitely subpar in my mind even to Denny's and the like.  I ordered a belgian waffle, which was dense and kind of tough....not at all fluffy and light like I like them.  It also had zero taste to it, so it was thoroughly disappointing.  I tried to compensate by smothering it in butter and syrup, but even that didn't help much since the waffle was SO thick.  It basically sucked everything up and still managed to stay dry and bland.  My hubby ordered some kind of Mexican omelet, which arrived covered in a ""salsa"" that, to me, looked and smelled more like a marinara sauce or something. *blech*  He said it tasted ""alright""....maybe he was just really hungry.  lol  The ONLY thing that was really good here was my oj, which was fresh squeezed style, sweet and pulpy.

Service also pretty much sucked.  Our waitress brought my husband his coffee without any kind of cream or milk, which he didn't notice until after she walked away...in part because he assumed it would already be on the table next to the sugar packets...as USUAL.  Nope.  We waited and waited for her to come back in the general area so we could ask for it but the place is so big that she seemed to completely disappear somewhere.  He waited so long with his coffee getting cold that he eventually got up and walked around til he found a guy cleaning stuff over in the bar area of the restaurant.  He asked the guy for some creamer and the guy had to actually go hunt it down somewhere.  It took him like 5 minutes to finally reappear with it!  WTF....shouldn't this stuff be around SOMEWHERE and not hidden away somewhere in the back of the kitchen??  Bizarre...  The only real saving grace was that they do leave a whole carafe of coffee on your table...big plus since they never come back to ask you if you want a refill!

All in all, we could have saved money and also gotten some consistently more decent food over at the Denny's on the strip....and that's not sayin' much!  I'd say skip this place if you can!",9LPTj40OXCMQBoy4Wsf7jw,0,0,1,e7evDN6Y8-7efiANtR-OVw

I stumbled barefoot from the clubs on the Vegas strip and walked, yes WALKED, from the club to Excalibur where my hotel room awaited.  My buddies wanted to continue the night on the casino floor, gambling whatever they had left away before heading back to the room.  I was hungry.

We stumbled upon Sherwood Forest Cafe and it looked so tempting.  Wait, it didn't look tempting, the decor was pretty Medieval Times cheesy...  I think I was just drunk and hungry. The little old lady that worked there was extremely kind, providing water first to me and my buddies and I recall her saying ""Here's some water for you kids.  It's the desert and I know, I know it's dry out there.""  So we placed our orders and everything on the menu looked tempting.  I ordered a mushroom Swiss burger and french onion soup.  My friend ordered the Excalibur Omelet.

Perhaps I was hungry or just plain drunk, the burger was absolutely delicious.  The meat patty was not over cooked, juicy, and flavorful.  The French onion soup was really delicious as well.

But, my memories are of people, not food. Don't get me wrong, the food here is solid, with all of my favorite foods-to-eat-before-or-while-drinking-heavily (notably chicken strips and burgers) on the menu. But for what you get, the prices are high, and the restaurant is frequently understaffed. I've always found the servers to be especially nice, though, and usually tip well here in spite of the overcharging.

Not the greatest place ever, but I'll be sad to see it go. RIP, Sherwood Forest Cafe.",rKbHJVoreU_p_Hj1JVqHaw,1,0,2,MAXRiEf14LNKQWQbN8lb7w

I don't know what the manager was doing, but she didn't notice that fact that I was seated for a full 10 minutes before anyone even acknowledged me.  No glass of water.  No cup of coffee (though it was 8 am).  No 'someone will be right with you'.  The food was mediocre at best (and we're talking eggs, hash browns and toast -- nothing elaborate).  The bacon was limp.  The prices were high.  What can I say, except that I won't go back.  Next time, I'm headed to Il Fornaio at New York New York.

4462557,2009-09-24,0,KJsGM_gLm597KEJ95PUfsw,"After arriving in Las Vegas my friends and I decided to head over to Sherwood Forest Café fr breakfast.  The best way to Sherwood Forest Café is that it's a Las Vegas Denny's.  It's your basic American Style Dinner that serves Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner.  The menu here won't blow you away, but there is something for everyone.  

Most of the breakfast items here are under $15 unless you go for the steak and eggs combo.  You're looking at your ""typical"" Denny's breakfast menu filled with pancakes, waffles, scrambles, and omelets.  So if you're looking for something more, this isn't the place for you.

I put in for an order of the egg beater scrambled with wheat toasts, ham, and orange juice and my friends also put in an order for 2 egg scramble and eggs benedicts.  We chatted for a while and out came my juice.  It wasn't freshly squeezed juice, but a lot better than most places where they have it tapped into their fountain drinks.

When our breakfast arrived, portion size was decent.  The egg beaters were ok, I asked for some salsa and that help with it.  I got a good amount of hash browns which were good but nothing special.  Probably the best part was the ham.  It was a nice thick cut piece of ham that you see people get at a buffet (which probably happened considering we are in Vegas).  None the less it was pretty good.  My friends seem to enjoy their breakfast, not making either negative or positive comments about it.

To pay, once you get your bill from the waitress, you have to leave your table and pay up front where you came in.  So that's an FYI so you don't sit around forever waiting for the waitress to pick it up.  The service here was ok, kind of equal to what you expect for in Denny's type place.  They were there and that's about it.

As to rating, best way to describe Sherwood Forest Café is that it fulfills a need.  It doesn't pretend to do more than that, it's just there for people to get something to eat.  If you go in with that kind of expectations, you should do fine.  And since Sherwood Forest Café filled my need of having breakfast, it gets a 3 star rating.",BclQLeF-geeAYb5Re98thA,0,0,3,Ab6wOppSfoC1AhTz8_wFmQ

What we found was fantastic.  We had lunch, then back for breakfast.  
-  Sandwiches - Very well prepared, perhaps 3.5 stars
-  Breakfast - Extremely well prepared, and a solid 4.5 stars.  (what put it over the top for us was the FANTASTIC salsa!!)

The good news/bad news is that they are changing over this restaurant to a ""Lynyrd Skynyrd BBQ"" restaurant in a few months.  

Claudia and Cinda (two great managers) made us feel like family there.  As a matter of fact, we had to give them all hugs as we left today.

See, the thing is all over the hotel they have banners saying steak and eggs for 8$ - shoot, we wanted in on that. We get there Friday night after Jet and we all want $8 steak and eggs (yes, even me - it's rare I eat steak, but hey I was drunk and didn't care). But no, the $8 special is only on the weekdays (of course it is).

Anyway, the food hits the spot since we were all hungry - I had the steak and eggs that night and it was ok not bad. However, the next night Saturday after Tao once again we defaulted to this place and I had eggs, hash browns, and toast.  It was a fail - the eggs were runny! FAIL - hate that.

It does get three stars since the first night's food wasn't bad and if you're staying at Excalibur it is 24 hours so that's convenient.",z9orBUbC8xTSqVIIxvZRjw,0,0,3,-0OMQzpmyvQvdD86_6X1eg

5682902,2011-01-21,2,KJsGM_gLm597KEJ95PUfsw,"The MGM management that runs Excalibur has changed directions so many times the past few years, it's hard to know what to expect if you haven't been there in a few months.  Right now, they're in a definite down cycle - the place is a mess, in more ways than I can cram into this review.  But this review is for Sherwood Forest only anyways, so I won't bore you with the other issues.

Where to start?  This used to be a great place to grab a meal, 24x7.  At one point, they even had a Chinese section (quite an extensive one at that) on the menu.  Prices were very reasonable, service was good, quality was high, and portions were large.  Not surprisingly, the joint was always jammed.  Fast forward to today, and it's hard to recognize the joint.  They've removed the cashier station and now have the wait staff cash you out.  A few months ago, they were shutting down early at night, like 10pm or something like that (wtf?  It's the only cafe-type food in the entire joint, and the only food other than Baja Fresh on the entire bottom floor).  Now it's even worse - it's open for breakfast and lunch only, and closes at 2pm!  What the HELL is going on here??  Also, the menu has shrunk, prices have blown up, and service is uneven.  Well, I found out what's going on - they are getting ready to level the joint and turn it into a Lynyrd Skynyrd-themed night  club.  Good luck with that.  If they screw that up as badly as they've done with Dick's Last Chance, then it will be a total bomb.

I long for the days when they had the rotating food display in the waiting area, displaying plastic food examples, including the world famous ""faded salmon"" that was there for at least a decade.

I'm giving SF 3 generous stars, only because the food we've eaten there most recently was quite good, and service was adequate.  Soon you won't even be able to eat anywhere in the joint late at night, other than the Mickey D's upstairs.

Sherwood Café, nestled uncomfortably underneath the armpit of Excalibur hotel, on the other hand, is like all those glorious classic ~*~American~*~ restaurants of legends past, like TGIF, Mel's Diner, Lori's Café, IHOP, Denny's and Sizzlers, all mixed together and dumbed down to Vegasian capacities for our dull, gambled-out enjoyment. The food was inappropriately salty, greasy and bland all at the same time, the water tasted gray (if gray had a taste) and the servers looked like they had been forced to live through every single work day TWICE. In a row. Under leaky fluorescent lights. While wearing shoes 1.5 sizes too small.

But one thang good, the prices were top-notch (or bottom-notch, as it may be) in that we found Downtown Las Vegas prices in the heart of the strip, which is a miracle in itself. On the Strip, one is used to, and even expects, to pay triple to quadruple the amount of money the dining fare should be worth.
