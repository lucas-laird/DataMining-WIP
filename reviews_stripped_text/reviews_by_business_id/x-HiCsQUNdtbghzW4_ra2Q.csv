He was handling cash/credit cards and making the food without washing his hands (which had visible cuts on them). On top of all these disgusting and time consuming things going on I was given habanero sauce instead of creamy jalape√±o sauce.

Now that I'm no longer a college student and a lot more health conscious, I rarely eat fast food nowadays. But once in a while, my inner fat kid emerges and the cravings will be overwhelming. 

The food is what you expect of any Taco Bell. It's fast, it's cheap and heartburn waiting to happen. However, it is deliciously so bad for you. Everyone knows their menu consists of tacos, burritos, nachos, and most recently added to their menu was the Quesalupa. My last visit, my food was piping hot. The tacos and the nacho chips were crunchy. And my nacho cheese was melty and hot! Their soda machine had 15+ options, but I always gravitate towards the Baja Blast Mountain Dew. The employee who took my order was friendly and smiling when he took my order. And he didn't seem annoyed when I asked him for extra Fire sauce.

I thot it would be a great gesture to call the resturant, and let them know that there food was cold and made us sick. Then GM Fred was very unapologetic. HE asked me ""what do u want me to do."" I can remake the food again, for u or u can fill out paperwork and I will turn it over to our risk management team. Which means what? BASICALLY. I only complain of something is really bad. Both of us are in the sevice industry(wife) and we know that complaints are supposed to handled differently.

This joker was not sorry about what happend. Maybe this happens a lot or maybe he gets a lot of prank calls idk, the thing that bothers me a lot is that he didn't say I'm sorry or try to reimbursement at all. 

The question is do we go back? Food is good and Jamie they drive thru girl is amazing and always friendly. I might given it another try but Fred man u need some help on how to deal with people.
