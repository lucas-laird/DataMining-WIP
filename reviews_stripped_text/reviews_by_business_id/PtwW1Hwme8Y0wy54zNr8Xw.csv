144725,2016-09-21,0,PtwW1Hwme8Y0wy54zNr8Xw,"In such a cute neighborhood, in a beautiful complex, sits this breakfast chain. First, the decor is that of a preschool with a train-theme and florescent lightening. We choose to sit outside. The view of the mountains was nice. 

After ordering eggs and turkey bacon, and a skillet, we got the banana nut muffin. It was warm and was a nice touch. The rest of the food was were it starts to get bad. The potatoes were heavily seasoned for a breakfast dish but that could just be a preference. The turkey sausage looked like flat lumps of mushed meat- tasted as described. 

But here's were it gets the worst for me, the price was 25 dollars and some change. In my opinion, go down the street a ways to Tivoli Village, Leone Cafe and eat a beautiful meal, in a gorgeous atmosphere, for the same price. The quality of food at Egg Works was not worth it. Luckily we had a coupon. Still, would have chosen the other breakfast spot over Egg Works. 

Hoped this place was going to become our new neighborhood breakfast spot but instead we were completely disappointed in everything about this establishment.",Ij5ivYnR5oqn_M2DmBjftw,2,0,1,yyYdEWzrpvU9fAjHchtKiA

I asked the seller if he liked the Egg Works down the street.
Dude said he and his wife go there all the time, and they love it.
Sold.

Went there, felt like I was back east at a breakfast joint.
Will be bringing my parents there when they visit.

I got a breakfast burger, and was very pleased with it.
I was alone so I sat at the counter in the back, got my own coffee carafe and was happy about it.

What's also a cute idea is that they have a dog-friendly patio where your doggie can sit with you. We don't have a dog, but we love to see dog owners enjoy breakfast time with their cute pets. 

Their bottomless, delicious hot coffee is also just perfect for me in the morning! My kids love to come here too. Their favorites are the French toast & the Mouse-shaped pancake. Service is courteous and quick, although today they did forget my banana nut muffin and one of our side toasts (it's okay these things happen sometimes )... but we didn't realize it until after we left... because truthfully our tummies were stuffed silly lol!

386922,2014-04-27,0,PtwW1Hwme8Y0wy54zNr8Xw,"FYI, my husband and I had breakfast there this morning.  In case you're interested, we want you to know why we will NOT be returning.  We found the tables & chairs very uncomfortable.  The tables are so small that when the meal comes, you have to do a lot of juggling around to make room for the rest of the stuff that you already have on the tables.  A few more inches would have been a much better design plus the chairs are very uncomfortable.  The place has no soundproofing and is very, very loud.  It reminded us of a cafeteria much like a school.  We kept thinking we were in a factory--not a pleasant atmosphere at all.  We feel it is disgusting that whoever designed this place all they had in mind was how many people we can fit no matter how uncomfortable they may be.  

Atmosphere and surroundings are just as important to us as the food when we dine at a restaurant.  Even though the food was good and the staff was very attentive, which did please us, I noticed on our receipt, it did not have a website to let you know where you could comment on your visit.",c4hPAGbNYXG2nPgoy0GBPA,4,0,2,zCKHph2kDA9KdxZwPaDNfA

We had pancakes, a scramble, an omelette and eggs with porkchops.
The pancakes were OK but ranked last overall....it must be the LV water since we've not found a great pancake yet.
There was definitely not a shortage of their signature potatoes...maybe a little too much at the table....the next time we might substitute one serving for something else.
Pork chops were the breakfast cut size and was slightly too salty but that may be my preference...nevertheless they were a good change over typical sausages.  The banana muffin that was an option over the toast was very good.  Coffee was good and they left a carafe for refills.

664827,2015-06-18,0,PtwW1Hwme8Y0wy54zNr8Xw,"I have two kinds of breakfasts I like when I eat out: the first is usually with visitors who want a unique experience and are usually still drunk when they wake up so we will hit one of the delicious options on The Strip. The other breakfast option is my more frequent trip down the street to a comfortable friendly place like Egg Works. I don't look for anything fancy and it is the ambience and service that brings me back regularly. This is most definitely the case with Egg Works. The greeting is always welcoming but the severs take everything to another level and make you feel more like you are visiting friends than dining out.
I'm an early bird so I can usually anticipate a seat outside on the patio where I am often doted on by the friendliest staff you could hope for. I am not an adventurous breakfast eater and usually stick to the basics, which are consistently fresh and well prepared. If there is anything to truly rave about though it is the captivating personalities of the staff. Las Vegas is a town where you should expect good service and this vibe certainly infuses Egg Works. Not only is the wait staff friendly, efficient and hospitable, the extra bit of personality offered up just brings the whole experience to another level and starts my day off with a great positive vibe. If you ever want to practice overtipping, this is the place to do it since the servers make you feel so welcome and appreciated.I have even developed my own ""server crush"" and always ask if the lovely Nicole can, you know, ""butter my bread.""",WvkuLL3dKAxdQgb9doFUIg,0,0,4,ivGQQF9qoOWkz-pDkB_zxQ

Based on Yelp reviews I selected Eggs Works for Sunday brunch for my daughter and me. Oh boy!

It was busy but we were seated immediately. Our server wasn't quick but the initial wait wasn't too bad. However, the server seemed a little abrupt. We decided to give her the benefit of the doubt as we were hungry so maybe it was OUR perception. haha  But no. Each time she was distracted and less than present. She wasn't mean or nasty, just not fully engaged. We often had to flag down another server for drink refills or other needs. By the end of our meal she hadn't been seen in twenty minutes and we had to hail yet another staff member for to go boxes. (Incidentally, we were not the only ones. We saw other tables going to the hostess stand for help.)

The food was fine. I didn't get to try the muffins as the server neglected to bring mine, but the omelets we ordered were not bad. The potatoes were over salted, but I don't like salt so that could have just been me. Coffee was good and strong. 

Overall, the restaurant was loud and dirty, we heard drops and breaks multiple times. I'm ok cutting some slack for Sunday brunch being busy but for a breakfast restaurant, they were struggling.

As far as food go, their Banana Muffin is amazing. Served Warm. And melts in your mouth.

The kids meals come with choice of potatoe or fresh fruit, which I love because potatoes are hit and miss with my toddler (and a side of fruit is $6!).

Large selection of sides and all customizable breakfast items.

We came twice in two days, service was great, seating was fast on Friday and wait on Saturday morning was a quick 15 minutes.

Seating outside is also a dog patio.

Fruit side and main dish is awesome, my advice just order the fruit side as the entree includes coffee and toast for almost double the price.

Oatmeal was good. 

Both times we were there the servers customized our selections of sides to creat a meal and saved us $.

Single disappointment was whether you wanted hash brown patties or country potatoes, they were frozen and processed.  Would have liked fresh but or grated but that's a personal preference.

We had one issue with a serving that was quickly addressed with many apologies from 2 different managers and staff.  Handled very well and we came back the next day with friends.",GwWjnIPiaw9uBOVGC8s-RQ,2,1,4,M38CH88Yr4hAPg8rX5eo1g

Stayed at the Bally's Resort since I came late, but just came to my apartment in Summerlin. I was trying to find a place to eat when my bf suggested Egg Works. I brushed him off and agreed to it because I was tired, hungry and wanted to get it over with.

My first impression of the place was wonderment. The outside patio is misted so that the people enjoying their meals are kept relatively cool, since, you know... it's kinda hot out here. But just a little.

When we came in we were greeted and checked in for a table. In the lobby/waiting area there is a tiny cute train near the ceiling that goes through some of the restaurant and the front. HOW CUTE!! Anyway, the prices were a little high, but we were hungry and the place is really nice so why not.

I ordered the breakfast burrito and my bf ordered the country fried steak. Never would I have imagined that they would produce some delicious food! YUM! Also what an extensive menu! 

We thoroughly enjoyed our meals and will gladly come back another time! :)

Servers are quite friendly and on top of their tables, though occasionally when it is busy you might wait a few minutes for a refill of water, coffee is provided by the jug. The ""happy"" or ""sad"" egg signs work to remedy  hiccups pretty swiftly. 

Typical breakfast fare with seasonal specials thrown into the mix in a location close to the gym, where you can absolutely dine in workout gear is a plus. Friends are fans of the bottomless cups of Joe, pancakes, French Toast and hash browns, while I usually stick stick to building my own omelette or a crepe. Something for everyone, at a modest price served up in a non Big Box chain location to boot = a fan!

My wife ordered egg whites, with home fries and a banana nut muffin. I ordered Grandma's  Sausage Gravy and Biscuits, with the home fries. That was after a 10 minute wait.  We finally got our drinks a few minutes later. 

Breakfast arrived 25 minutes later. My wife's egg whites were okay. The home fries were hard and not very tasty. The sausage gravy was lacking something, oh, yeah, sausage flavor. It tasted like flour and grease stirred up with some salt and pepper. The home fries have a weird spice flavor I didn't care for. I tasted them all day.  Nothing was hot. Tepid would be a good word.

We were staying at the Red Rock Inn and wanted to venture out from the basic restaurants at the hotel & ended up here. 

I am on a healthy eating kick but since it was vacation I wasn't too picky but I ordered the veggie something or other (where the eggs Benedicts are). 

It consisted of hollandaise sauce, poached eggs, A LOT (!!!) of avocado, spinach, & tomatoes. 

It was seriously one of the top 5 best breakfasts I've ever had. So delicious. Idk if it was the hollandaise sauce, or they just cooked it with a lot of love- it was good. 

The rest of the fam ordered loco moco (hamburger patty, rice and gravy) and two kids meals: one with eggs and bacon and the other French toast. The loco moco and the eggs and bacon kids meal each came with a banana bread muffin thing. If you check in, you can also get one for free. It was a tad sweeter & stickier than I liked, but still good.

Our waiter was always prompt and polite. Good customer service.

We had one person serving us and taking orders. They put us at 2 tables next to each other, which was fine. Our waitress took one tables order and then left. Came back 10 minutes later and took the other tables order and then left. Table 1 got our good in about 15 minutes. 45 minutes goes by and table 1 is fine eating when table 2 barely gets their food! We turn the happy face to sad and at least 5 staff members walk past without stopping to ask what's wrong. Our waitress finally lolligags over and flips the faces back without asking. So I demanded to understand why half of MY guests didn't have their food. She says she split our order to help the flow of the kitchen. Ok that's fine but a 45 minutes gap is not ok. You could tell she just wanted us to leave by then. I was livid. If my family would have let me I would have not left a tip. None of us will ever return to this restaurant again. Horrible service!!! I should've known this from a few weeks ago when they completely forgot my daughters scrambled egg plate but the food was good so we chalked it up to an oversight and they didn't charge us for her scrambled eggs and toast.

2807185,2017-08-31,0,PtwW1Hwme8Y0wy54zNr8Xw,"I was pleasantly surprised by Egg Works. My partner and I didn't know what to eat when we woke up. I did a quick search of breakfast places nearby and egg works popped up...as well as IHOP. I honestly kind of enjoy IHOP a little, but we decided to do something different. I expected Egg Works to be a very generic breakfast place, but man was I wrong.

Walking in it looks typical. Until you see the little toy train racing long a track that's suspended near the ceiling of the restaurant. The train and little Egg people riding on it. Adorable. The place had a wait, but it was only 10minutes even though there was a good 8 people ahead of us. I thought that was pretty awesome and the reason why it was so quick a wait I'll explain shortly.

After we were seated we were greeted by a very kind woman who had a southern twang in her voice and was rocking a full set of braces. I noticed because she was all smiles all the time. The best way I can describe her personality is what you'd expect from someone touting that ""southern hospitality"" everyone speaks of.

The menu was super unique. It was in the style of a newspaper. Like seriously you just read the menu like a newspaper! I know, I'm amazed by simple things. They had a pretty extensive menu. From country fried steak to breakfast burritos to 5-6 different types of french toast. For real, if you like french toast, then go here. I may not have tried it, but any place that cooks up carrot cake french toast deserves a must a try stamp.

I went with the country fried steak and my partner got the breakfast burrito. Now here's where the explanation for the wait time is. Two minutes after we ordered I was server by banana bread muffin (delicious) and 7 minutes after the muffin we got out food. Wooow was it fast. It's something I'm not used to coming from Chicago.

The portion sizes were great. They gave you a heaping pile of their signature Diablo potatoes, which are just seasoned home fries. They were amaaazing. Loads of flavor and cooked well so they weren't hard. The country fried steak was delicious. Very tender, no tough parts at all, and the gravy was extra creamy tasting. I think it had bits of ham in it if I'm not mistaken. 

My partner's breakfast burrito was very good as well. They basically took a breakfast skillet and dumped it on a tortilla and rolled it into a burrito. It was packed with ingredients. There was a whole lot of flavor in each bite. They also give you a hot sauce/salsa that reminds me of Taco Bell fire sauce but in a good way. It adds a nice smoky flavor if you like that.

When the bill came, I wasn't taken aback by the price or anything. It was very agreeable with the service and quality of food I received. Overall this place was great and I advise anyone in the area to try it out if you love a good breakfast. If I lived in Vegas I'd be eating there a lot.",uwavnlkvnttiDEbrNXYgvA,1,0,5,qc-jbQzetwMi9p3_-chwSQ

The service has always been amazing. Thanks to the Egg card, I never have to wave anyone down. Just flip it and someone will be along.
When you order coffee, it's $2.75. I find this to be pretty expensive. However, they bring you a whole carafe.
They don't do said cubed fruit if you want an alternative to potatoes. Just freshly sliced, tasty fruit. 
Portions are huge, and the hot sauce is so good I  bought it.
The omelettes are huge, and made from high quality ingredients.
Waitresses  have NO problem customizing your order within an inch of it's life.

Unfortunately, the food is bland. I love the potatoes, and the fruit.. But biscuits and gravy are a little off, the biscuit being too airy, and the gravy just missing something. The omelettes, no matter which one I get, never seem to have any flavor. Good ingredients, but they don't season it. To be honest, Baby Stacks is far better.

When people travel to Vegas all they think about is the chain restaurants and the buffets. Well since we stayed in Summerlin this was quite a treat. Unfortunately we sat at a section where the server was not attentive. She was quite slow and didn't check up on us. Hence the reason I gave 4 stars. I don't remember her name as I doubt she even gave us her name. She looked distraught as soon as she came to take our order. The greeter was nice enough to grab our drinks but then waited a good 25 minutes for the server to pop in and ask if we where ready. Aside from the minimal problems with the server. Food was exceptionally delicious. We all ordered an omelet as they make them fresh and use four large organic eggs. I had the Sundance special. It had spinach mushroom and artichokes.

3519796,2014-07-02,23,PtwW1Hwme8Y0wy54zNr8Xw,"I was excited to try this place since the nearby IHOP is terrible and I'm not a fan of the name changing, yet same menu at GriddleCakes (supposed to be ran together I didn't goof!). Too bad I wasn't so thrilled about this place either, but it for sure is better than the 2 breakfast spots I previously mentioned. I came in on a Sunday so naturally it was packed inside. I was with a yelper friend and we were still seated right away even though they were busy. There is a fair amount of tables and tables with half booths inside, but the table we were sat at shouldn't be there. I was practically sitting in the kitchen! Menus were brought to us right away and our server was nice. I just didn't like waiting f-o-r-e-v-e-r to get some cream for my coffee. I asked our server for it and she said she'd be right back. I watched her (since the machine they use to enter orders and the kitchen was right near me) enter in orders and tend other tables including the one customer crazy enough to eat out on the patio on such a hot day, but still I had no cream for my coffee. They have this thing on the table where if you are in need of something you can flip this ""egg"" to black when you are doing fine and flip it to yellow if you need something. The yelper I was with flipped the egg to yellow and someone quickly came over and got me some cream. I had already enjoyed 2 cups of coffee before I finally scored some. I thought the cup of coffee was steep being priced at $2.75, but damn that was good coffee! The coffee was the best thing I had during my meal. I like that they bring a carafe to your table so you can keep refilling your cup at your own leisure. Most of my rating goes to the coffee! 

Priced at $10.75 I ordered a ""Bacon & Sliced Avocado Omelette"" that came with a side of ""Works Potatoes"" and a ""Banana Nut Muffin"" that I have heard many good things about. The muffin came out first and it was hot, fresh and moist, but where was the banana flavor? I tasted no banana. It just tasted like a warm muffin with a hint of sweetness. Nothing special. The works potatoes were good and seasoned nicely, but they tasted exactly like fries. I prefer more of a hash brown type of potato with my breakfast personally not fries. The omelette was just okay. I can't believe I'm about to say this, but there was actually too much bacon in it! Yes, I just said that! It was just too much bacon and not enough egg. The amount of cheese and avocado (it had huge chunks of ripe and delicious avocado!) was very fair. The omelette just wasn't fluffy enough though and when you have grown up eating them at the Omelette House on W Charleston like I have, you know what a perfect, good omelette is supposed to taste like and I just didn't find it here. The coffee being so good, I just might someday come back and give their french toast a try, but with my single breakfast totaling $13.50 before tax and tip and not being fully satisfied with it, I can't see coming back often or anytime soon.",Fv0e9RIV9jw5TX3ctA1WbA,32,27,3,zN0Ia7TQuWer2wQKrqIEzw

I love breakfast food, hate mornings, so I always end up enjoying it at night. Today was different since I actually woke up early enough on my day off to enjoy some eggs and coffee!!! My beau and I ordered: 

- spinach Benny 
- corned beef hash
- coffee 
- banana nut muffin

The spinach Benny is two poached eggs on top of Canadian bacon, spinach, and old English muffins covered in hollandaise sauce with a side of country potatoes. This was super tasty and the hollandaise was perfect and not too salty. The country potatoes were also deliciously golden crispy and perfectly seasoned. Mmm...
Corned beef hash was served with a side of potatoes as well, but my beau ordered a side of rice to mix the hash with. It makes a great combo. The hash was good, I just wish there was more meat!!! 
The banana nut muffins are always popular here, so it's no exception for me!! They're always nicely warm and sweet and perfect when you spread some butter on it. Gives it a nice balance of sweet and salty!! Pairs well with their coffee, and it's actually really good coffee. 

This will always be my favorite breakfast spot and it's reasonably priced too. Portions are generous (although I always finish my plate) and the staff is always friendly and attentive! I'll definitely wake up early for this place...  Well, let's see how comfy my bed is that day... :)",d4XCDUWioKG1XxzSzCkbTA,1,1,5,E-x-eEe7Tl5A-VPdjqGCGw

3617414,2016-06-26,3,PtwW1Hwme8Y0wy54zNr8Xw,"I've come to the conclusion that there are two types of ratings here on Yelp...the Standard star rating, and the Suburban star rating.  The average Suburban star rating appears to generally be a star higher than it would be with the Standard star rating because the restaurant is in a suburban setting amongst all the other ho-hum chain restaurants.  I think that's the case for this place, the food was OK but not 4 1/2 stars worth.

I had the pork chop breakfast and Mark H had the New York strip breakfast.  Both were ok with the steak being the better of the two...seasoned nicely and was cooked to mid-rare as ordered.  My pork chops on the other hand were cut so thin (about 1/4"") that there was no way that they'd be anything but dry.  They were seasoned OK, but just so darn dry.  The other disappointment were the potatoes that came with Mark H's steak and eggs.  They were also quite dry like they had been sitting under the heat lamp for a long time.  The best part of the breakfast was that you could get a house-made banana nut muffin instead of toast.  The muffin was tasty and really moist.  If you check in on Yelp, you also get a free banana nut muffin so we got the free one to go.  The service was friendly and attentive so that's also another thing Egg Works has going for it.

Don't get me wrong, this place is OK and compared to the numerous chain places in Summerlin it's better but I'm just not sure it's worth 4 1/2 stars.",IfLTw-yFMpuiqAdYRxLv8Q,5,6,3,TkIEZoHqEd2Fg1exIriNxw

Husband had the biscuits and gravy meal. He said the biscuits could have used a little more gravy, and the gravy needed a little more sausage, but otherwise really great meal. The potatoes are amazing, and don't have all that ""crap"" other places put in them (onions, peppers, etc). 

I ordered the mushroom omelet, and a side of biscuits and gravy. The mushroom omelet was too much for me, so my husband ate that too. He said it was ""ok"", had to add hot sauce to it, but he ate the whole thing. I filled up totally on the small side of biscuits and gravy, and I thought it was delicious!

""uhhh, what?""  ...but they've got the flavored International Delight stuff hiding in the back. She was cool and left a carafe at the table because obviously I give out the I want a lot of coffee vibe. 

The food though, meh. Portions are huge, lumberjacks could eat here! I had eggs Benedict and found the Hollandaise quite salty. I think it's a Las Vegas thing to put olives on top for decoration, nay to that. Boyfriend had ""stuffed French toast"" and we both assumed it would be a more decadent, dessert like dish than a basic egg/sausage scramble French toast sandwich. Oh well. That's what you get for assuming. They don't do hash browns here, rather they have their own sort of country style potatoes. Now these were WELL seasoned, another friend of ours doesn't like to eat at Egg Works because of this. However, we found the potatoes to be the best part of the meal (besides the coffee) We both at half and took the rest home, potatoes heat up nicely in a skillet as leftovers.

Tidbits: There's a neat electric train running around the top of the foyer where you pay. A lot of outdoor seating it appears, but seem to be understaffed and these sections were closed off. Happy/sad egg sign at each table to fetch a server for attention, brilliant idea.

3880639,2016-08-13,0,PtwW1Hwme8Y0wy54zNr8Xw,"So this is a location that I have eaten once before with no real issue, however this time I can't say the same. Our server was pleasant, though not enough to stand out as memorable. That wasn't the issue here, she did nothing wrong. This chain puts a spice on their home fried potatoes that to me makes them way too salty to eat. One time it was so bad that I had to send it back. When you order an item such as a skillet breakfast, they put these potatoes as the bed that the meals items lie on. In turn, the entire menu item tends to become incredibly salty. I tried it, and was rather shocked at the high salt/sodium level. I'm sure they would have been ""ok"" with us sending it back for this reason, but I'm surprised they don't get regular complaints about this. However, this was not even the main issue of our visit. They have an open (non screened,) ""pet friendly"" dine-in patio. We luckily chose to be seated inside the air conditioned restaurant. After we were seated, we noticed a fair amount of pigeons flying around on the patio. They were flying right by diners and even directly over where people were eating. They were flapping their wings, and making their presence known to all the diners that had the misfortune of eating out there. They were landing on the ground and eating food that had made its way to the floor. However, this wasn't even the worst part. A couple left quite a bit over on their plates upon their departure, and three or four of these birds landed on the table and began to chow down on the leftovers. They were standing on the plates (on the table) and really going to town. This continued for about 5 minutes or so, to our disgust. It wasn't until the hostess attempted to seat some more folks out there that they stopped, and they still didn't even fly away. They finally went to clean off the table, and the busser shoo'd them away. Not only was I disgusted, the words UNSANITARY and HEALTH HAZARD were flashing the color red in my head. Pigeons are not real clean members of the aviary family. It was so outlandish in my mind that I took to shooting pics & a video with my cell phone, I just couldn't believe it. I'm all for ""pet friendly"" environments, but this was just sickening to me that it was taken so nonchalantly and carefree. Like a scene out of the movie ""The Birds!""  A true feeding frenzy! I was sick to my stomach at a distance, if I was unfortunate enough to be eating out there while this was taking place I would have undoubtedly walked out on my meal.

Other things I noticed while there included:

A. My plate was filled with 75% of fried potatoes. Obesity in America is real. I'm all for decent portions but this was seriously beyond a normal serving for one person.

B. The hot sauce on the table says ""refrigerate after opening."" Do they replace the one on a table after its originally opened? I'm sure not. 

C. Waiting to pay at the front, nobody present to take our (or another party's money.) We had to go looking for somebody to man the register.

I have little problem with patio dining normally, but this was a perfect example of how an inexpensive option like a screen would go a long way. To whom it may concern, please do this before somebody ends up sick. I also understand that they don't control said birds, but if this a regular occurrence then the appropriate individual should take notice immediately.

I have eaten in other locations and have had little to no issues, but I'm not sure if this type of thing has ever been experienced by others here before myself. I myself nor whom I was dining with will not be returning.

My visit still gets 3 stars only due to my server wasn't the issue and what I myself ate was fine.

P.S. If anybody needs proof I have pics and a video. I'm not vindictive or I would have posted a pic here today lol.",3tLPT5PzOemSed-ERxwSQg,1,0,3,qC-If7c9SK5xvYe9CwBQ9g

I like counter seating for breakfast because you have the chance to watch the staff do their things and you have a glimpse into the kitchen.

After looking over the extensive menu, I opted for the Sundance Special, a vegetarian omelette made with mushrooms, spinach, artichoke, with Swiss cheese folded in all in a 4 egg omelette.  It was topped by diced fresh tomatoes and feta cheese.  I had my choice of potato but I opted for some sliced tomatoes instead.  Instead of toast, I got the banana nut muffin.

Breakfast was very good and it was also a lot to eat.  Service was outstanding.  There was only one other person at the counter.  Your coffee is poured for you the first time and they leave a thermos of coffee for you.  It was great because I could drink as quickly as I wanted and refill without waiting.

4014559,2015-10-28,6,PtwW1Hwme8Y0wy54zNr8Xw,"Great place for a hearty breakfast!  3 1/2 stars...nearly a 4!

This Egg Works is in the middle of blink-at-the-roundabout and you'll miss it part of Summerlin!  It's like a needle in a haystack!  But finding this popular breakfast locale was worth it!

Came here with the fam on a Sunday of all days and even in the upper boonies the place was crowded.  Like super crowded!  But thankfully even though many of us had to wait outside, it didn't take Egg Works more than 15 minutes to seat us.  And we got a lovely table on the outside Richie Rich Summerlin air!  Ahhhhhh....breathe in the wealth!  And the occasional fumes of Ferrari's passing by.

It's easy to see why this Egg Works is so busy.  It's basically the only one in this part of town.  Plus it caters heavily to the breakfast/brunch crowd.  Plus, apparently folks actually like the food!  It's got a lot going for it.

Upon being seated we were promptly helped by the wait staff.  Our order:

ME
-Original Breakfast Burrito ($9.95) - Flour tortilla stuffed with 4 eggs, diced bacon, bell peppers, Habla Diablo seasoned potatoes, cheddar & jack cheese.  Waiter also suggested I add avocado in my burrito (a $2.50 upcharge!!).  Comes with a side of more Habla Diablo seasoned potatoes & Habla Diablo salsa.

WIFEY
-Santa Cruz Skillet ($10.99) - bottoms layer of Habla Diablo seasoned potatoes, topped with seasoned chicken breast, chorizo, green chilies, onions, and home made Santa Cruz sauce (whatever it really is I don't know).  Topped with a dollop of sour cream, melted cheese & 2 eggs over easy.  Also comes with your choice of toast of banana nut muffin (she chose muffin).

KID
-Waffle Works ($9.80) - waffle served with 2 eggs any style (over easy), with choice of ham, bacon, or sausage.

Plus with check in on Yelp we got a complimentary banana nut muffin to try!

Food was good but it did take a bit of extra time to come out possibly because we were either on the outside patio or because it was just slammed at Egg Works that day.  

My breakfast burrito was definitely hearty, it was huge with the addition of that expensive avocado!  I was only able to eat half, I had to take the other half home for later.  Flavors in the burrito were yummy, fresh scrambled eggs, good quality bacon bits, fresh veggies, spicy potatoes, and more than enough cheese throughout.  Topped with some of their Habla Diablo salsa & house hot sauces this breakfast burrito was pretty top notch!  The side of extra Habla Diablo potatoes are really tasty, seasoned with a nice kick & cooked crunchy on the outside but still fluffy on the inside.  

Wifey liked her Santa Cruz skillet very much.  Chicken was grilled but not dry, chorizo & that Santa Cruz sauce gave the dish some extra flavor and a punch of heat.  All that with egg yolk running down?  Oh yeah, yum city baby!  

Kid thought the Waffle Works plate was OK.  It really wasn't anything special to write home about, pretty par for the course.  The waffle was a bit cold, and tasted like a basic waffle to her.  It was just alright, but they forgot butter!  So her first bite or 2 were dry.  Bacon & eggs weren't anything special, just bacon & eggs.

We were a bit disappointed with our banana nut muffins though.  I thought they would be brought warm to our table but they were cold.  They could have used a pat of butter as well since they were on the dry side.  So the muffin was somewhat forgettable.

One thing that may bother the value-conscious is the prices here at Egg Works.  For breakfast they be on the high side!  To get a decent meal will cost you near $10 per not including any drinks.  And if you upgrade your burrito like I did with avocado, it will set you back over  $12 not including tax!  But keep an eye out on Groupon, they do promotions for this place often.

With the varied menu at the Egg Works we'll probably be back again.  They do Hawaiian type food here too, get a Loco Moco or some SPAM & Portuguese sausage for breakfast!

We'll be back!  If we don't get lost in a roundabout first.",QCtHk02W_Asu2LFfdmGQDA,5,4,3,sg7uasRDm_pCYUCjZF7mbg

Food could have been crap and still would give 5 stars cause I'm so all about that customer service, and Maryann has it! But, luckily the food wasn't crap! It was bomb! I'm not a meat eater but now and again I'll have tuna. Their tuna melt is the best!!!!! Real tuna, melted perfect cheese and the parmesan sour dough??? Lawdy!!! Perfect! Seasoned fries are great too!!! My mom had a Bloody Mary and said it was the real deal! We loved everything about our experience here!",z908ldotiE_K0-gJv0qk8Q,3,3,5,07HI6Bdy7XVmatjGPWKjog

Large portions at reasonable prices, a variety of sweet and savory breakfasts, and a lunch menu make this the perfect place for a quick bite.

Breakfast potatoes are what make a meal for me, and the Hablo Diablo seasoned potatoes are the best. The name makes you think they'd be hot, but they aren't. 

Sophie is an outstanding waitress. Very kind and attentive.

The food, however, was not awesome. I ordered the Greek scramble and what i got was a grey, unappetizing mess loaded with some sort of pressed chicken thing. It was slimey, salty and I didnt love it.

My dog however is a service dog and can go either place, but I'm happy for the patio as some people, even though she is a service animal get upset when she is ""anywhere"" they are. FYI, Service Animals do not have to wear vests or any kind of ID, so you never know when a dog near you is actually a service animal, although the ""handlers/owners"" do have to carry a handlers ID. Some management ask to see it, some don't, but I always have mine in clear view.  This being said:

Egg Works is Amazing.  Everything I have ever ordered there has been perfect and very delicious. The prices are comparable to other breakfast places in the area.  I can't wait to go back.

The location is somewhat hard to find, but there is an IHop and a Starbucks within eyesight of the patio.  So I guess it gets lots of traffic?   This location used  to be an awesome Korean Restaurant.  Don't know what happened to it, but we ate there all the time.

Down home, all-American comfort food.  And a toy train on the tracks above the dining room?  C'mon now, how cute is that!

Egg Works is a great breakfast spot, serving about 1000 different breakfast items.  The problem will be choosing your entree.  Everything we tried was scrumptious.  My fiance got the chicken fried steak skillet and I was tempted to ask for a trade....his looked and tasted SO good!  I got the Huevos Rancheros with green sauce which was very flavorful.  I thought it was a little over-sauced as I couldn't really taste the tortilla and beans underneath.  On the plus side, it came with a side of home fries to help sop up my sauce and runny egg.

Prices were very reasonable, dishes were no more than $10-11.  Check in for a free banana muffin!

Service, per usual, is great. Typically, the biggest challenge at EW, in my opinion, is deciding what to order. With so much to choose from, I felt compelled to try something 'new' to me. 

I don't think I'd ever had a skillet of any kind here, so I tried and enjoyed the Fresh Veggie Skillet. Atop a layer of their Habla Diablo seasoned potatoes, is onion, tomato, bell pepper, sliced mushrooms, and fresh spinach, two over-easy eggs and finished with melted cheese. It's a good, hearty yet still relatively lighter option. And having been making the rounds at some steakhouses the previous few nights, a tasty oasis for me. 

Choose between the fabulous banana nut muffin or toast, I went with my usual, the swirly rye. I don't always remember that butter is standard, so ask for dry if that's your mood. And on the health note: one of my dining companions ordered tomatoes (instead of potatoes). I got to try some too. Fresh and good. I am very pleased that when someone orders tomatoes as their side, that at EW, you actually get a full portion of tomatoes. That's not always been my experience (at Cracked Egg, for instance). 

OK, so, nobody's perfect. And to that, there was one little hiccup this time - lipstick on my coffee cup. Yikes! Just wished I'd noticed that BEFORE I start drinking from it. Not enough to knock off a star, but maybe a reminder that things do get busy at EW, and it's a team effort to keep things running smooth. OK, next time, I'll try the pancakes, unless I have a hankering for an omelette..",yvXEJcXRtffR2GuWULbRjg,5,4,4,4FaXu7OM2foL2ZZEKYFsIA

This was very average but for my first visit the price was great because we had a ""buy one entree get the second free (up to $8.00)"" coupon. Which was great, but for a buy one get one for only up to $8.00 it seemed silly because essentially all their meals are in the price range of $10-$12.

The place itself is huge and they have a cute country like theme with a train running on tracks above your head throughout the whole restaurant. Although right where we were seated, as we looked up to see the train pass by, you couldn't help but notice some cobweb on the ceiling.

On yelp they have the special to where you check in you get a free banana nut muffin, so we were excited to get that. It was a SUPER moist muffin, really tasty with some butter! For brunch I ordered the Santa Cruz burrito (chorizo sounded AMAZING for today). It was a mix of onions, peppers, eggs, chicken and chorizo covered in sauce, then served with a side of their Habla Diablo seasoned potatoes. The potatoes were really tasty and crispy. The burrito itself was just so-so. I was REALLY looking forward for some chorizo but I couldn't taste any! And upon further inspection you could BARELY see ANY inside, it was all chicken and egg. Big let down.

My friend ordered their Grandma's Biscuits and Gravy, and although I didn't get to try it, I heard no complaints. Our waitress was sweet and accommodating, if I go back I think i'll try one of their sandwiches or pancakes, no more burritos from here for me.",8Fr2Jx2vTTo7e0mUb02g0A,0,0,3,uAG7V7eY_4IgCCUM5HCO9A

Our waitress Veronica quickly came over to get our drink order and see if we had any questions. She recommended the Chile Relleno omelette for myself and the Avocado & Bacon for my wife.

The food was fantastic! The Chile Relleno may just be the best omelette I have ever had. My wife really enjoyed the Avocado and Bacon as well. We came in hungry and the portions didn't disappoint. Generous portions of seasoned potatoes along with the omelettes. My daughter also enjoyed her Mickey pancake.

Let me tell y'all about the food though. Based on my personal experiences here, it's average. Today though, with my meal it was just down right trash y'all, honestly truly. I had the Carlsbad sandwich on sourdough with a side of fries. The sandwich is essentially a club ok and I can't even make this up but 3/4 of this sandwich was sad iceberg lettuce. The turkey was barley there. Like there was maybe an ounce of shredded turkey breast on one half of the sandwich. Also the fries were so overly fried that they were nearly burnt through.

The service, like the other 2 locations, is great. So nice to see people who actually like their jobs (or at least very good at faking it if they're not), from the hostess, to the waitress and the cashier (she was a hoot).

I tried the chicken fried steak skillet and holy poop, it was AWESOME!!!  My husband ordered eggs & bacon and after tasting mine, said ""I should have ordered that.""

We have been going here for about 6 years and watched them grow and have tried several of the different locations depending on where our day was going to take us... I have to say each location the food does have a little different taste, same menu but I order almost the same thing here and it is better on one location then another
I love brunch so unless I am going to go to LA or the strip and want a nice variety, we have 4 spots and this one tends to get us fed at least once a month, however it seems the larger they get the quality drops... 
as well as the service has seemed to suffer since their boom..

I always get a skillet and friends get egg white omlets, pancakes etc.
We always leave full and it is a good spot to have a good brunch, just a pain during 11-2 but that's a good thing since they are busy.

Their orange juice is always freshly squeezed, coffee is always a bit burnt so expect to add extra sugar.

Yummy banana muffins (they do have nuts so warning if you are allergic) 

Portions are great and you can get half sizes which is nice compared to other places.

They Rarely get the bacon or meat products cooked to order but the eggs are usually spot on (perhaps that's why it's called egg works ha ha)
They used to have fresh fruit on every plate but for some reason discontinued that practice.

Pancakes are always huge and kid portions are enough to feed a teen so no skimping there...

2 Buttermilk Biscuits
Ham, Egg, and Cheese Stuffed French Toast with Strawberry Jam and hash browns
Candied Walnut Buttermilk Pancakes (seasonal special)

With household chores needing attention it was largely a matter of location combined with a buy-one-get-one coupon that led me to Summerlin's relatively new Eggworks on Saturday, and having visited sister restaurant ""Egg & I"" nearly a year ago I'm happy to say that its fifth spin-off replicates the formula well, a very competent breakfast served amidst friendly confines fit for any age.  Obviously not the sort of place looking to reinvent the wheel, but rather a locals-only kind of spot where nearly all the patrons present during my early morning meal were 'regulars,' it was with nothing but smiles that I was greeted at the hostess podium at 6:45 and offered a seat at the kitchen-side bar or a table I opted for the later, a small two-top amidst spacious confines already loaded with condiments, menus, and utensils as College Gameday played on televisions all around.  Never shy to over-order, even as my waitress informed me that two entrees was ""a lot,"" it was mere moments after seating that I made my selections and starting with two doughy, $3.49 biscuits finding slight salvation in butter plus honey I quickly realized I should have again ordered the signature banana bread, though things would soon improve, my BOGO coupon yielding a duo of plates nearly overwhelming my small table.  Beginning first with another item dubbed 'signature,' the stuffed French Toast is offered with an option for bacon, sausage, or ham and doing my best to recreate the Monte Cristo the results were admirable - the fluffy eggs loaded with cheddar and chopped pork beneath slices of vanilla scented, golden bread ready to be gilded with syrup or jam.  Moving next to an item from the seasonal menu, a $9.75 three-stack of pancakes was next in line and topping the fluffy discs with pure-maple syrup brought from home plus a few pats of butter I'll be honest when I say these could just be the best buttermilk flapjacks in town, each bite surprisingly light with ample buttermilk tones punctuated by pockets of melting brown sugar and rich caramel with toasty walnuts through and through.

Far larger and brighter than the original Egg & I location with similar smiling service and a 6am opening every day of the week Egg Works Summerlin is a great addition to the neighborhood and with coupons frequently offered in the local mailers serves as a great place for families to enjoy a good breakfast without breaking the bank or succumbing to big chains like Denny's or IHOP.  Certainly not a 'destination,' but a great spot for a leisurely morning while reading the paper, watching gameday, or just sitting on the dog-friendly patio I only wish they advertised specials more prominently, the only indication of those lovely pancakes found on a laminated menu left at the table.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,5,4,3,MdPVY3MiQpRuHUv9DkO7Aw

5540559,2014-11-11,0,PtwW1Hwme8Y0wy54zNr8Xw,"My husband and I decided to try Egg Works after some fasting blood work, and it was quite possibly one of the worst breakfasts we have ever had due to the poor food quality. I couldn't have been more hungry, but both of our meals were flavorless.  My omelet had a strange burnt oil flavor, though nothing seemed burned.  Apparently, the restaurant uses a liquid butter alternative (translation:  margarine and soybean oil mix) instead of real butter;  this is all I can imagine caused the strange chemical taste on an otherwise uneventful menu choice. There was no real cream for your coffee unless you asked for it (instead they serve a chemical non-dairy creamer), and we were told (when inquired about ingredients) that the potatoes ""come from a bag"" and the waitress couldn't really tell us what was in the seasoning.  I opted for a side of fruit instead.  The food tasted very processed, and gone seem to be the days when ""The Egg and I"" (1st restaurant) used to serve ""homemade"" breakfasts that you actually had to wait for--because they were cooking them--to be served. The speed with which the meals were served at Egg Works also indicated how truly processed these meals are. We ate little, and couldn't stomach taking the food home, though it was offered.  I noticed that tables on both sides of us were also leaving much of their meals.  When we left and saw the U.S. food delivery truck at the back of the restaurant, our suspicions on poor food quality were further confirmed. 

Items ordered: 
Coffee
Hash and eggs
Vegetable omelet w/fruit side

The location of the former Maru Korean BBQ restaurant, the site has been transformed into one with ample seating.  I arrived this Saturday morning around 10:30am expecting to wait since the parking lot was packed.  However, my friend was already seated, which was a good thing since we were both starving.  Our waitress, Nohemi, was very friendly and attentive.  As with the other Egg Works restaurants, their menu comes in newspaper format and you'll find the same crepes, omelets, pancakes, waffles, and scrambles.  I was craving pancakes, but also just wanted eggs and bacon, but that simple combo is not available, for some odd reason.  I ended up ordering the Blueberry and Cashew pancake short stack, which is three smaller pancakes (you can also get one huge pancake instead of the short stack), a side of turkey bacon (3 strips), and a side of 2 egg whites.  My friend got the huevos rancheros, which came with breakfast potatoes.  Our food came out in a timely manner considering the place was packed and it's brand new.  For a ""short stack,"" the pancakes were bigger than I expected them to be so I ended up eating only half of them.  Blueberry and cashews together sounded interesting, but I didn't love it; I would probably order a different kind the next time around.  I don't remember what the side order of eggs cost, but the turkey bacon was $3.50.  My meal came to about $14, which is more than I like to spend for what I had, so I don't think I'll be coming here too often.

All of their breakfast food is amazing and the habla diablo potatoes are a can't miss item. Not a big pancake/waffle person, but theirs seem pretty good to me, as I've tried a bite of other's food. It can't get pretty packed on the weekends, but you usually don't end up waiting very long for your food once you've sat down, which is surprising. The only real downside is the wait to be seated on the weekends if you're not willing to sit at the counter (which looks like it's pretty uncomfortable to be smashed in if you're not a smaller person like I am) and also the wait to pay. I wish you could just leave the money on the table because it can get pretty backed up trying to pay. If you're coming in at a time that isn't during their peak hours (weekend mornings I'm assuming) then everything should be smooth sailing.

First to arrive was a chocolate-colored muffin, I said 'I ordered banana nut', waitress said 'it is'. Sure enough it was and it was the best banana-nut muffin I've ever had.

Shortly the omelet arrived with a large, 1-cup serving of cottage cheese (and a soup spoon to eat it). The veggie omelet was covered with two types of cheese which didn't add to the taste so I scraped it off. The omelet was excessively oily; too oily for my taste.

My husband tried to pass him money anyway but the host wouldn't accept it. That made a big impression on us. Because of that young man, we will be back.

My spinach eggs Benedict was extremely salty and so were the side potatoes. Additionally the poached eggs were completely runny (not the gooey consistency). I guess I expected a little more based on the great reviews.

I do not recommend the Benedicts. Ask them to hold the salt.",4ZaqBJqt7laPPs8xfWvr6A,2,1,2,u9paweTAbJSYdwRJ2kywPg

5732381,2017-06-10,2,PtwW1Hwme8Y0wy54zNr8Xw,"If I could give this place a 0 star I would. The cashier Linda is a racist older lady. At the register it's says have ID ready for credit cards & debit. Well my African American husband was asked for his ID. Although we watched her not ask the 5 white customers in front of her for their IDs or the white customer behind us. When I questioned her she was mumbling & fumbling her words saying because she knows them they come everyday & proceeded to point to a white man standing next to us & said see like him. WTF does that have to do with anything! I should have asked her the Guys name. I was so steamed at her lying ass. All customers should be treated equal. You might as well have a sign posted white customers don't need to show your ids black customers have your Id ready. I'm reporting this restaurant the BBB & every organization I can think of regarding racist business practices! DO NOT SUPPORT THIS BUSINESS!!

Since my 1st review I received racist emails as well as kind emails applauding me for standing up bc they too had experienced the same behavior from this business. Please see photos. One was from someone with the initial L & had the restaurant's notice as a profile picture. The cashier's name was Linda how ironic. (To that person who I am sure is reading this; I'm Asian get your facts straight buddy.) He she is hiding behind a fake profile using the same initial as the employees. I'm standing up to what I see is as an injustice. It goes back to when restaurants had signs saying ""whites"" & ""blacks"" to determine where you sat by the color of your skin. I hope this establishment stops hiding behind emails & publicly puts an end to this racial profiling.",4P-mQXsgRvv94n8yd_8u3w,1,0,1,XCTKVaVlg6pxrzzBbCr-0w

I understand that the restaurant has just recently opened but i cant say that i'm impressed. The service was slow! I know that during the time of our trip their main customers were the elderly but COME ON! After being seated it took about 20 min before someone came around to take our order. We had to resort to flipping the unhappy egg. 

For those of you who don't know, Egg works and Egg and I both use the ""run forest run"" system. They have happy eggs for those who don't need assistance that flip over and reveal an unhappy egg which means you need assistance. 

The food wasn't that great either. I had the waffle which was pretty routine, nothing really great or bad to say about it. My girlfriend got the one of the crepes and when i tried it it wasn't that bad. I did drown it in hot sauce but still... it was OK. The worst part of our meal was one of the tostadas. The lettuce used in the tostada was still wet and that caused, what should be a crispy and delicious shell, to become soggy and mushy. The taco meat was over sauced and  that caused the lettuce to wilt as well. Overall the dish was really bad. They were able to take it off of our bill since we only took a few bites from it.",SlCXIWAYwL_itoM_gHuzQw,5,2,2,qEvlVdtfjspK8uQFHVRFNg

5845955,2017-11-07,0,PtwW1Hwme8Y0wy54zNr8Xw,"TL;DR: I like this place and they have top notch customer service. I would recommend the french toast and any benedicts, but I would not recommend the omelette.

This place is pretty good. What we ordered: The Works Omelette, Spinach Benny, Bacon Maple Cream Stuffed French Toast, and 2 Coffees.

Cons:
This place is called Egg Works so I thought a safe choice would be an omelette, but the omelette was not that good at all. It was actually very bland and was layered too thick. It was overcooked on the bottom and was sweating oil on the side of the plate. I would have given it 5 stars, but the omelette was sadly disappointed.

Pros:
The best part of the meal I believe is the seasoned potatoes. They were well seasoned, crispy but not too crispy. With a little dab of ketchup, they filled me up and made me happy. When I go back, I will always order the potatoes.
The salsa verde was amazing! It saved the omelette. I was ready to not eat the omelette after the first bite, but the green salsa verde has a very rich flavor and make the omelette edible. 
The french toast by itself was ok at best, but the cream cheese was the staple element of the french toast. The candied walnuts added a very nice touch to the french toast. It was good, but I don't think it was worth the $10.50.
Eggs Benedict was good as well. We asked for a side of the chipotle hollandaise sauce and damn it was good. The eggs benedict was already good by itself but the special sauce they have makes it even better.

**Recommendation for management: Reduce the menu. The menu is extremely extensive. Long menus are proven not to be good. It may give customers a larger selection, but creates a lot more work and tends to end in lower quality food for consumers. Keep up the good work with the great customer service.",Q3_SHSsOVwdgBzovw8Vy3A,0,0,4,wBE_ZJaMjFlB0tBqGzfvWg
