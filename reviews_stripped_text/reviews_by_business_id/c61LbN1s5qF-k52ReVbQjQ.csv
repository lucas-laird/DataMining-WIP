Waitress did not update on the food, and took her time getting back to the table. Was not very friendly.  Very slow, spent more time talking with other customers or new customers rather than serving us our food that we ordered and waited over 45 mins for. 


Might go again for the food, but the service was terrible. You shouldn't have to wait for a meal when the place is dead empty and not busy at all.

She was a medium-dark blond female, with middle length hair, thin girl, maybe around 25-30 years old.  Hopefully the other servers there have a better attitude and attentiveness to time and updating on the status of the food.

I had a deluxe breakfast meal which included scrambled eggs, bacon and pancakes on the side.

Meal was subpar.
I ended up throwing the blueberry pancakes away. It tasted like frozen supermarket pancakes.
Eggs n grits were ok, not great---Coffee subpar.

Like any Vegas visitor, you drink, and then need to regenerate. I happened to see Denny's because I know the prices and I figured I couldn't go wrong. The second night in Vegas I walked on over from The Cosmopolitan (check out my review) and my party of three was immediately seated. It was probably like 3 AM though... So that explains it. The server was very nice and got our order quickly kept my coffee coming. I had the Super Bird, and boy was it delicious! The other two people in my party loved their food as well and said it was the best Denny's they've had (they eat it more than me.)

My second experience was on a late morning. This time there was only two people in my party and I was craving breakfast. Full restaurant, full waiting room, but only 10 min wait. SCORE! 

But this experience wasn't as pleasant. I was the only person who ordered food. He forgot my coffee and silverware. So I received my breakfast with coffee and no silverware. Well now my food is getting cold and I had already poured some creamer in my coffee - what do I stir it with? I saw all the other servers running around and taking care of their customers and with coffee pots in their hands. Mine said, ""We ran out of coffee. I'm making some now."" Translation: You're not my priority and I'm going to hang around in the back room. I say this because I saw all the other servers out and walking around and I saw him maybe three times while I sat there. 

So I guess I should have known better, and I definitely learned my lesson. Would I say this place is hit or miss? Not necessarily. I should have just asked for a different server or waited to be seated somewhere else. 

Other than the terrible service, the food was good. Whatever. It's Vegas!",_7A9uRTB8MEUGrloUdo8Fw,1,0,4,NQUBMADjPZSMyScALC3Wmw

I was told the other section...the front of the restaurant was too busy which is why I was seated in the back. Again, the same scenario I waited 10 minutes and no server.

It's 2am and I'm about to leave in about 3 hours. I quickly get on Yelp, only to find that all the places I'm searching for close at a reasonable hour in the day. My friends suggested we go to this Denny's and try our luck. At first I was hesitant, but it's 2am on a weekend in Vegas. Heavy amounts of alcohol may have been involved. We show up and I pick something off the menu only to ask for a million substitutions on the sammich to try to get what I want. The waitress (Jessica) looks a little puzzled, but then begins to understand what I'm after. She checks with the cook, and confirms they can do this for me. Kudos to this wonderful staff who so nicely accommodated a couple of drunks even when super busy.

He also bought the food out cold on purpose which extended the already long wait . Seeing that I've worked in service before I understand that when things get hectic sometimes workers forget the correct way to operate a business BUT that does not give employees the pass to disregard the well being of the customer. When we finally finished the food and went to the front and told the cashier lady that the service was below sub par she gave a giggle and did nothing about it . The tab was $40.00s but we left him $0 tip for the simple fact the dining experience  as anything far from comfortable or perfect. This Denny's is highly unorganized and the workers are very detached from the people their serving .

Not only is she extremely slow but it's not very busy even. Thank goodness it's not busy she wouldn't be able to handle it.

I'm not too familiar with the Denny's chain so I don't know how this location compares to others so keep that in mind if you read my review.  I was by myself for the SEMA show in town, so I was hoping to just get a seat with counter service.  Well, that didn't happen because they don't have any bar/counter service.  No big deal, I was seated at a table after a 10 minute wait.

The service was definitely not top notch but I didn't expect it to be.  My waiter was friendly enough, I'm not too picky.  However, the coffee was not hot and tasted watery.  
  I liked how I was able to create my own ""Grand Slam"" because I was on a special diet for my physical training and being able to pick all items with limited carbohydrates was a welcome option.  You know how hard it is to find food when dining out with minimal carbohydrates?... VERY.  The food was not bad, but definitely not very good.  However, only spending $12 for a big breakfast was a nice change.

While I was eating, one of the employees brought out a really noisy vacuum for about 15 minutes just to vacuum up some crumbs.  It was a little annoying after 5 minutes, more annoying after 10 minutes, and REALLY annoying after 15 minutes.

We were halfway done with our food before she finally came back over and asked if we needed anything. I asked for a refill on my orange juice. She rudely stated there wasn't free refills and I said that was okay. If I was worried about it I would have asked if there was free refills before ordering another.

I had breakfast here with my friends since we are familiar with the Denny's brand and have eaten at Denny's locations before. The service was good and fast but the overall cleanliness of the place is what turned me off the most.

Where we sat had chewed gum attached around the booth we were sitting at. Not something I want to see or have in my view when I am eating. Also, our waitress who was nice, had open and closed sores all over her arms and even a band-aid. Please cover that up when you are serving customers their food!

The omelet I ordered was beyond mediocre. It tasted like powdered eggs that hadn't been cooked thoroughly and the cheese was slathered all over it and overpowered the dish completely. It felt like I was eating cheese with a side of egg. Not to mention it was also drenched in oil and grease. The bacon was the only thing on the plate that was delicious. But bacon is always delicious, so that doesn't count for much. The sausage was also poorly cooked and almost tasted rubbery.

Upon arrival I  waited  8 minutes. The hostess took cash while making me wait. These people walked up after I  waited 8 minutes.
When paying my bill she asked "" how was every th hing?"" I said hotcakes were cold. She never said one word.

There were other patrons there that were Caucasian and he was very polite to them. the waiter brought over our drinks and every single one of them including the carbonated drinks was lukewarm and watered down we all stated that our drinks were less than par he walked over to the sleepy hostess and they both returned and he proudly informed us ill no longer be serving your party smirked and walked off. at this point i told the waitress/hostess no need to replace my drink because no way i will spend a dime in an establishment that treats me like yesterdays garbage.,PqoelYStfD6ldmKzBeF0Zg,1,1,1,9zTCC9yiw2GdwzSFl-HOkw

Moving on the what they clearly can do better: my food was severed warm an not hot. It arrived rather quickly so why was it warm already. The meat was flabby, like my arms, so I know flab when I see it. The hash browns were very crisp, read this as burnt, underneath the top layer. The toast was about the only thing I ate.

We actually walked down to the Hard Rock instead but they stopped serving breakfast 2 minutes before we came in.  I hate when places do that.  If they were smart they could prob take a lot of Dennys' crowd.

Anyways back at Dennys.............Do not let them seat you next to the front pay counter.  Thats where we were and people were lined up inches away from our table with their butts closer than desired.  The waitress was trying really hard but if the kitchen staff is blowing it the waitress suffers.

They told us that they didnt have a kids menus but come to find out what they really meant was that they had no more kids menus.  Would have been nice to know seeing as how my two year old would have wasted a regular portion.  A bit scandalous I think.

We ordered and 45 minutes later (literally 45 minutes) we got our food.  My eggs oredered over easy might as well have been hard boiled eggs cut in half.  My hashbrowns were burnt on the outside and raw pots on the inside.  My gf found a hair on her sausage!  I brought the attention to the waitress when she passed by our table and she offered to have the things remade.  I didnt feel like waiting another 45 minutes and said I just wanted it taken off the bill seeing as how I didnt eat any of it.  She copped a bit of an attitude.  

Bad experience but places like this and Shari's are really hit-or-miss.  It really depends on whos working up front and in the back. 

Pretty much everything in Vegas food wise is pretty expensive but at least the service and quaity is there for the most part when your paying top dollar.",t5L4lotuc9UTD20RLj9Q6A,1,0,1,cjCb4MkTH6lWX3ZKcJHb5A

Then there was the 20 minutes of waiting without service. Once Luis actually decided to grace us with his presence, he complained about having 8 other tables. You should never, ever do that as a server. Then we waited longer for another server and almost left, until two people from management came over to take our order. Sonya put in our orders and somehow our orders still got messed up with our drinks. I asked for strawberries and whipped cream, and she sent out the whipped cream & strawberries in this sauce on the side. That's not even close to what I wanted or expected, especially when I specified I wanted it on my waffle.

I told her that I was going to give a bad review for this type of service and she that's fine sarcastically. Also .....my my husband and son got really sick after eating here with vomiting and diarrhea GREAT VACATION!!!! AND went our entire meal without drink refills after asking several times.

I came here for breakfast and it was packed. Fortunately, the line was just long and they were just taking time to clean up and get organized. I got seated fairly quickly, within 10 minutes.

First thing I noticed was how dirty the utensil was. But I tried to ignore it. I had the grand slam. It was good, but not as good. The sausage was way too soft and not as crispy. It felt like it was heated and re-heated. Service was pretty good. The lady was really nice.

We did leave since we were uncomfortable and didn't know how our food would be prepared. We did explain to the people at the front register our reason for leaving which she was just smirking and smiling.

But this last time the waitress Sonya M. Or whatever was completely rude to my family and I. She threw us the check on the table and walked away. Also she went around greeting the rest of her tables and never once came back to mine. Never brought us more coffee or juice. Completely rude and it made me feel like she was just being racist to us. But the food was great unlike the service.,4RtIRJ6vH_SwHAm_UD4eCA,0,0,1,-agFTd5oQPpO5g8929q_Pw

Upon ordering the employee by the name of Trevor couldn't figure out how to substitute as well as add on to an order needed help from another employee to get my order correct as I thought. Additional to my order I specifically asked Trevor to kindly add red and green peppers to my meal and he stated ""no problem"" which lead me to the assumption that red and green peppers would be added, upon waiting almost 30/45mins when it was slow in the restaurant meaning no heavy traffic of customers a couple that came in after me placed their order and received their food which was a big order that they placed while I'm patiently waiting on a simple meal for two people. Poor service and all I received was a messed up order and a complimentary orange juice my daughter could have freshly squeezed herself! For the people who stumble upon this post please do not go to this specific location when you can just go to the IHOP down the street, and as far as the employee Trevor please take him off of the register and have him sweep the floors or wash the dishes in which he may be more productive don't so!",phy3Qp8V6plcPXPXaSMcsg,0,0,1,DOh81t1yijWVB3NJ-_4v-w

Naturally, they are pretty busy.",NRB8xfZFzc5KFlKUEzIzWA,1,0,4,oixfJvlCdG_yjaAzytEXeA

After being seated the waitress took forever to come and take our order. After placing the order it took forever for it to come out. After scarfing down the cornbread waffle, it took forever for her to bring us the bill. Never again, this was Super Bowl weekend, not at the best at all .. no tip.",n5Tcogwoqbz1-t4XpW1hvg,0,0,1,bnAUG0UJW52E70RgKIyv1A
