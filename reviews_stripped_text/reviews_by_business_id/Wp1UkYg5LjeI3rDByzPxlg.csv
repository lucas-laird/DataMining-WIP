The entire staff however were focused on a homeless woman who had taken her shoes off to warm her feet.  Swollen, it was obvious her feet were causing her great pain. Wrapped in a blanket, she sat quietly eating a burger.
She had been asked to leave. The staff was so focused, obviously disgusted by this woman, that I worried they forgot my order!  
The staff at this store did not see anything wrong with the brew-ha-ha going on with the middle school students 20+ people.  They had NO compassion for an elderly woman, trying to get warm.

I am always walk inside to get my Order, but they gave me the food so cold , not even a little bit hot, vegetables isn't fresh, look nasty, look like the old food, which you should throw it away, it could not eat! I was so mad, but I was leaving . I would not like  give them the complain, because I don't think I will be back. 
And then Yesterday after I got off work, I went back, because it's close my house, and I hope they already changed and updated the good service , but I think I guessed wrong, they have the same service , they are so rude and mean  with customer, 
I ordered  2 Oreo mc flurry ice cream ! A girl gave me the first ice cream and then 
I asked her 
"" how come you not use the machine for mix ice cream??""
she said "" we don't have machine for mix"" 
I said "" why? ""
And I saw the machine , 
I told her "" the machine was there, why you not use it and mix for me, before you guys always mix for me"" 
and then she had  bad attitude 
she just said  "" no, no more "" 
and in the during time she made  for me the second ice cream , gave it for me, my cup not even full , I bought the large size for my ice  cream, but she didn't give me full cup,just show me her attitude , I am not happy at all, I just said "" thank you""  and was leaving, I could  talk to manager right? But I would not like to do that for give them the trouble and make the problem, I just would  like enjoy my ice cream , that's make me happy, but the reason I write on here, I just let they know, what happen at their store Mc Donald's  and they should solve  their service . I am really dissatisfied  at all, I already gave them a chance . That's why I came back, but now, I think I never come back again!",Du21dnfQ46BFeNU3S3bQcA,0,0,1,m9MW8Qnhe6zRadsMxCftZQ

1486007,2011-08-14,3,Wp1UkYg5LjeI3rDByzPxlg,"I stopped at this McDonald's because I had about two minutes to grab lunch. The ONLY reason I ever eat at a Mickey D's is because it's a) fast, b) cheap and c) predictable. You know the food won't be awesome, but it will be reasonably eatable. Man, was I disappointed on points b) and c).

First, the medium Quarter Pounder meal was more than six bucks. Jeez, that's hardly a deal.

What made the sticker shock worse was the poor quality of the food. This had to be the worst Quarter Pounder I've ever (half) eaten. Maybe even the worst fast food burger I've ever had. It looked like it had been sitting out on Uncle Zeke's radiator all morning. The burger patties were gray and curled up at the edges. The bun was dry and crusty. It's like the damn thing was somehow mummified. Just nasty. Too bad I didn't have time to take it back.

This will probably be the very last time I ever eat at a McDonald's. It was that bad.",wjR3wbFfjz2thNlKKZc7aA,5,4,1,RT9304MfQqxzkC3HbizGJw

Several times now, the fries taste like they are 2 days old. Since fries are the only thing I like from McDonald's, it sucks that they consistently serve rubber fries. Yuk. But, what should I expect? It's halfway ghetto McDonald's late night...but, it just seems so easy to do that part right. 

1. Grab a bag of Frozen fries.
2. Open bag with hands.
3. Make sure oil is hot.
4. Pour specific amount into fry basket.
5. Set timer.
6. Remove basket from oil when timer goes off.
7. Put fries in serving container. 
8. Smile.

My bf pulled up at their speaker and the person said to hold on.

We were literally listening to her talk about her life for three minutes until my bf said to me ""I wonder if she knows we can hear her"" and then she cussed, paused and then came back on the speaker.

We ordered two spicy chickens, two sausage mcmuffins, and a large fries. She gave us our food with no receipt. We drove off and I reached in the bag for fries, only to find SOGGY fries that weren't even warm, which were drenched in OIL. We go back through drive thru and tell her that our fries are soggy and drenched in oil, we would like a new batch, & she said ok drive thru. Two cars ahead of us, which was fine. We got to the window and she just handed us the bag of fries and shut the window quick. No ""sorry for giving you disgusting stale ass fries that were soaked in oil because we re-fried them for you"". We checked the fries before we left this time and they were fresh. We get home, I open up my sausage mcmuffin and it was drenched in oil. This is my very first time ever getting a sausage mcmuffin so oily you can squeeze enough out to fry an egg. Sausage mcmuffins are usually somewhat DRY because the muffins are TOASTED. I feel like they dropped these muffins in a tub of oil then threw it on the grill to toast. The spicy chicken had soggy ass lettuce and it was just straight up sloppy. Like yeah, it's McDonald's, I don't expect a fucking 5star gourmet looking burger, but make that shit presentable to where people will still have a damn appetite!
