I have had numerous coffee drinks from lattes to the chai and the only thing consistent here is the cookie I order with it. The drinks are never hot enough or have the right ratio of coffee to skim milk. There is really an art to coffee making and this place does not fit the bill. Everything I've ordered here tastes watered down.

Back to the cookie, they rock it with their Cranberry White Chocolate Health Cookie. It's made with only bananas, oats, cranberries and white chocolate chips.

They offer pastries that are baked in-house. I chose their Jalapeño quiche (5/5 size of my palm with onions, red bell peppers, and dare I say grilled jalapeños, with a fair amount of melted white cheese on top. I asked for it warmed though she didn't give me the option. She microwaved it- I'm more of a toaster oven fan myself to ensure texture and nutrient content), cinnamon roll croissant (twas bomb! I also asked for it warmed. It was microwaved as well but yummy. I loved the filling and texture.), and a small (12oz) Mexican Spice latte (I asked what it tastes like and she said chocolate. I'd compare it more to a pumpkin spice latte? Definitely had some nutmeg/clove action in there. Not my style really but I'd say it was good for what it was). 

Service was friendly and helpful. 

Their patio made me want to have tea and sunbath the cancer all up! Gorgeous! But Vegas has its tendency to be deterringly windy so I stayed inside to study instead. 

I liked that there was a wide variety of seating. You could have an intimate conversation, a group study session, or some solo time. There is a huge book shelf and a table with puzzles and games. I really liked the feel of the place. Some coffee shops lack the cozy factor but this one catered to it.

1694641,2017-01-17,7,wZJOlSwUZcVQuLt9sZeV2A,"Not bad. The view out the windows is one of the better coffee house views in the city, looking out over Red Rock, which probably glows red every sunset and sunrise. Seating has comfortable options, with cushy chairs and a well-loved sofa, along with standard small chairs/table combos. 

My pour over coffee tasted fine. Served in a take-out cup, though, it had that hint of paper taste and was just unremarkable otherwise. The English muffin sausage/egg/cheese breakfast plate was altogether meh. Egg texture looked like that made from those industrial bags of pre-mixed egg used in fast-food joints. Healthy, but tasteless, one step up from an egg mcmuffin. 

Each coffee house in the Valley attracts a certain customer type. The Cuppa, like Sambalatte west, seems to attract a steady stream of moms-with-babies. If that's you, have at it, and enjoy these spots. If that's *not* your cup of tea, if you can't stand wailing babbling b.s. and interjecting shrieks and high-pitched coo'ing at infants, the smell of diapers mixed with your food and drink, then maybe look elsewhere for your morning and afternoon brews.

The coffees and the drinks are pretty average. Just the regular premade syrups and powders you might get elsewhere. Not really any precision in what they are making for their drinks.

The staff is super rude and not very friendly, especially if they don't know you or friends with them already. Staff looks uninterested and gives you strange looks if you order something not normal.

So again one of those spots need to know where your going or easy get lost. Just make sure driving off Russell turn into Gramercy and as you come around the corner you will find The Cuppa. 

One day decided change up my coffee/reading spot try something new. The yelp pictures definitely looks like cafe that has some personality. So figure The Cuppa would be the perfect spot to write a new review plus always try my best to hit new spot once week. Yelp!!! The pictures no doubt give the place justice comes to personality. The only other coffee shop that comes close would be Grouchy. The difference between the two is The Cuppa way way more modern, adult oriented, and lot ways more sophisticated. The interior from the book shelves, the type of books that anyone can grab and leisurely read, the leather couches, or one wall that hangs picture frames of great quotes from random people. One table that just for puzzles (more community puzzle; everyone helps build it if sit in that are or another spot to chill at), and the book area awesome area just chill read over great coffee. The natural sunlight comes in on that side of the cafe is perfect. In the back of the cafe open patio area that on warmer days great spot chill. Once it does get warm count me in!!

The coffee truth not much coffee expert. I just like my mochas. The white mocha is solid. Me more about relaxing, chill, and great atmosphere read my book detox from reality along with good mocha. The Cuppa no doubt offers all the best things I look for in my coffee shop/cafe.

Sure, it doesn't have a drive thru, which would require you to park and come into the space, but that is the point of this hip, trendy joint.  You just feel good when you come in for coffee and stay awhile.

I must admit that I'm an iced coffee fiend, and they deliver without fail.  I'm always greeted with a smile and feel welcomed into the space.  They have a pretty extensive selection of accoutrements for your coffee, so no matter your sweetener or cream--you will be fine.  The menu offers limited food and pastries, but they can do most anything in regards to your caffeine (or non-caffeine fix) in the form of coffees, teas, cappuccinos, cappuccinos, and espresso.

I had planned on dashing in and out, but I found myself transfixed by the wall of books and soon found myself reading a short passage from a classic I haven't picked up in a while.  This must be the thing to do, for as I was leaving, I noticed I wasn't the only one who had picked up a book, and there was even a group quietly putting together a puzzle and sipping their brews.

3882160,2016-07-05,3,wZJOlSwUZcVQuLt9sZeV2A,"Hey Vegas! Corporate coffee are for suits and individuals who settle for the mundane. Fortunately, The Cuppa has come along to help elevate this city's game and in the process, has shat all over the status quo.  A year after their grand opening, this place is... what do the kids say nowadays? OFF THE HOOK? Nah.. That's probably the 90's calling. Anyhow, keep reading.

Been here a few times, mainly on the weekends and I have to say, that if I could order everything on the menu, I would. Unfortunately, dietary restrictions preclude me from doing so, therefore, seek out other reviews on the expansive menu, which includes your traditional coffees and teas paired with baked delights and sandwiches. Instead, I want to concentrate on everything else that makes The Cuppa just right for this part of town; an area that has been parched for some time and in desperate need of a good watering hole.

The baristas here are probably the nicest people you'll meet. Helpful and unassuming, which is always refreshing, just like their iced lattes. Speaking of which, the freshness of their espresso really stands out. Too many places seem to drown out the espresso shots with milk. Not here. Perfect balance between the two, which leaves me smiling after every cold sip on a 110F summer day.

If you want to conduct some work here, realize that the elongated layout of the store with its high ceilings can cause a momentary cackle/bellow from a nearby group to reverberate among the music being played overhead, so come packing with a set of headphones. The WiFi is password protected, so ask kindly and don't hog up the bandwidth by streaming HD video, BRO. 

The parking situation is a bit sketchy to me, but if you steer clear of any curbside marked ""Resident,"" you should be fine if you intend on staying for more than an hour. Not entirely sure when The Gramercy will officially be bustling with business, but given the infancy and revival from the defunct Manhattan West project pre-great recession, it looks a ways off. 

Outside, in the courtyard, which might be considered the back entrance, you'll find ample seating that is amenable for social gatherings. Would be a perfect place to hang out during a Vegas autumn evening, while consuming hot drinks and snacks from The Cuppa, of course.

Finally, the interior is immaculate. Love the subtle lighting and abundant seating. Overall, it's a clever design with two opposing entrances and the bar/kitchen right in the middle. A bookshelf stock full of good reads and a few games as well. Restrooms are clean, with zero sh*t tickets left behind on the floor by obnoxious patrons. Bueno.

There aren't very many coffee shops in Vegas that have the ambiance provided by The Cuppa. If you're looking for that hip, LA coffeehouse vibe with Edison Lights and decorative wall art, minus the douchey pretentiousness found at LA coffeehouses, then consider The Cuppa home, but please, whatever you do, don't be a squatter.",Ii3IgVncu5cMz3Ao_oRt8Q,4,4,5,QDTt3gTSsUOYkCEOhHFRVg

My overall impression? Meh. 

The area is absolutely gorgeous. I've never been to that business complex, and boy was I impressed with the outdoor area. But this isn't a review for the Gramercy. 

The service at this place  is the reason why I decided to give them a lower rating. It was my first time there, and the baristas behind the counter were very unfriendly. Almost seemed impatient when I wanted a moment to look over the menu. Most small places like this would want to help their new guests out but I guess these guys couldn't be bothered. I agree with many reviews here where it seems they are only friendly to those who they know. 

I ordered a regular iced latte. It was pretty good. 

The cafe itself is very charming. They have a great bookshelf towards the back of the cafe which gives the place a really nice homey feel. 

I chose a table in the back not thinking the sun would be too much of a bother. There's not many outlets around either so I needed the table that was right next to the windows. Biggest mistake. There are no shades or window coverings so the sun was beating down on me, making me uncomfortably warm. 

Would I come back? No. A shame. I really loved the feel and atmosphere of this place. But customer service is a big deal to me and sadly this place lacked that.",t17wZ8sG4IKW67CaCRz3yQ,0,0,2,ONkCRH39enWrpoNLYzN1cg

Super easy to reach getting on or getting off the highway, I loved this place.  I am only a boring coffee drinker, but I drink a lot of it throughout the day.  The coffee is solid and great quality.  Good beans and hand brewed.  

The space is open, airy, outdoor seating options (although not a lot of shade out there at this point, but would be lovely on a cooler day and with the right kind of shade from the building) and inviting.

The food is quite pricey too. I've had the egg and cheese breakfast burrito and the Turkey Fusion Burger- the burger was almost $7 and was so simply made with a sauce that I think was Thousand Island. Put anything on ciabatta bread and I'll enjoy it.
Not my favorite cafe to work at either. Uncomfortable furniture and dark lighting. Better place to just relax with a friend. They have some board games to play.

The next thing that I would like to talk about is the pricing because it is an amazing price! It was cheaper than Starbucks and it was all a decent size. I was very impressed with how much money I had spent on the food we ordered.

Now, lets talk about the coffee and food. First, I would like to stay that they have an amazing selection. I think what really impressed me was there selection of tea. I only got to smell them because by the time I had saw the tea I had already ordered. However, they had one tea called ""jungle"" I believe it smelt so divine and I am going to try that next time. There was another tea that smelt equally amazing but the name escapes me. My sister and I order coffee though. She ordered an iced caramel latte and I ordered and ice hazelnut latte. I was not to impressed with the hazelnut latte. HOWEVER, the caramel latte was one of the best caramel lattes I have ever had. It was a very creamy latte and it tasted like the creamiest caramel was put into this latte! I would def go back for that latte. Lastly, a big plus is they use my favorite type of ice the little circle ones! haha

We were told Chai Latte! The lady claimed it's the best you'll ever have lol. Abby opted for that and a Turkey croissant sandwich while I settled on a Nutella Latte and Bacon egg and cheese croissant. 

It was aight. I wouldn't say horrible but definitely not the best I've had. Abby said Chai Latte tasted the same as SB. A few things I didn't like was the fact they served our coffees in regular paper cups. I thought being that they were a smaller chain they would serve them in those big coffee cups especially since we were eating in. Second and my biggest pet peeve is when coffee is served lukewarm. The coffee was weak and you could barely taste the Nutella. Besides the great company I had that morning, I'd say it's a pass.

We were greeted and promptly served by the friendly Barista. She reccomended a few items and ended up getting a few Sandwiches on croissants. They were good and fresh just needed more of a flavor but the croissants were soft and flakey. However, our drinks were ok and the espresso beans was a bit bitter probably was a bad batch.

Open for less than a month, The Cuppa is a cool new coffee spot in the Gramercy Plaza off of Russell near Fort Apache.  Currently, there is a ton of construction going on Russell Road so it's only one lane in each direction.  I exited the 215 and had to turn around at Fort Apache to get here, but once I was here, it was fine.  However, I had a short visit because I arrived 30 minutes before they closed on a Friday afternoon. 

Right now, business hours are Monday-Friday, 6:00am-4:00pm, Saturday and Sunday, 7:00am-2:00pm.  Hours will probably be extended once business picks up per Charlie, the tall, personable barista/cashier.
I ordered a small Mexican Spice.  Charlie said that right now they're the only food place in the plaza, but DW Bistro and Pinches Tacos are going to be arriving, as well.  I can see how this place probably get more action earlier in the day from the businesses in the complex.  

I liked my drink and the chat I had with Charlie while I was there.  Lots of seating available in a nice, open space.  They offer pastries, cookies, bagels, sandwiches, along with coffees, smoothies, and teas.  The also offer free wi-fi if you want to plug in while you sip or chew.

So today was the day and we weren't disappointed!  Not only was the coffee VERY good... the baristas were lovely and the seating comfy and spacious! Love the library area with the books and the puzzle table for having some extra fun with friends. The Cuppa will be a place we return to soon.

What I love most is the outdoor seating that The Grammercy offers. So many comfy seating options to sit out on the patio and relax. 

Inside is cute too. Seating areas with lots of books. The place could use some art on the walls in the back but who cares really. You can grab a table and study or read and there's a good view of the mountains. 

The service has always been friendly. Their prices are reasonable and they have a few food options. I feel like it's a way better value and flavor for coffee than going to Starbucks and you can support local.",xrvyW1ruKS0uz9RtFewC0Q,3,5,5,8kcNko--MqnmgnBwXR8tBw

Sadly the beverages aren't that good. I'd say the latte is about a 2 star quality, definitely disappointing. If they could elevate the espresso quality, it'd be a great place. As it is, it's a mixed bag.",YE54kKTuqJJPNYWIKIpOEQ,2,1,3,gNNQ7groUbF0YC4rJCo8_Q

I get my nails done at the salon next door and was out of coffee, so I was really excited to get my morning caffeine fix, that is until I tried my latte and thought WTF?!

The espresso was either bad quality, over brewed, or both. I was also disappointed in the lack of variety of non-dairy milk (they have soy or almond, no coconut). Considering this is a locally owned coffee shop, I would expect at least the offerings of Starbucks/other LV based coffee shops. They also had zero gluten-free and vegan options, which was also a bummer. 

I also found it rather offensive that the shop smelled strongly of pine-sol or something similar--an employee was mopping the floors while we were sitting and trying to enjoy our coffee. Personally, I feel this should be reserved for closing/opening duties. It certainly isn't appetizing to huff chemical solvents while eating or enjoying a beverage. For the price of my latte and my mom's coffee and day-old pastry, I expected a lot more.",rJvKwSkbrHphPUK66Fw86A,6,5,3,3RtLHBz1CxiDqk43uxSsiA

I ordered the largest option available and added cinnamon and vanilla. It was less than $5! It tasted great and kept me laser focused for hours. Vanessa was my barista; she was very nice and recommended I add chai to it next time. I'll be back for sure now since I love getting live recommendations.

I did two shots of espresso and it was amazing. I will definitely be back to this place. My friend got the mango tea, and she also said her drink was really good.

I came in here as I had finished eating, and wanted to grab some coffee or slushy. They have some unique selections here, and I enjoyed my drink. 

Service was OK. I think I got some weird looks 'cuz I sure ain't no expert in coffee and had some questions about their menu. AKA, I was semi-excited about some of the stuff they had. Hey man, I'm a newbie at your location, gimme a break here.

I've visited this spot for meetings and posted up to get some work done. It's a great location at The Grammecy with some other local businesses surrounding it and the building offers lots of parking. They have a large menu and friendly staff. 

My favorite drink is an Dirty Chai with almond milk. They use a powdered chai which is a game changer. It's so creamy and adds a richness that you must experience. Subtle hints of sweet spices. Y.U.M. Making it dirty is adding espresso, but be warned that each shot will cost you. This drink is a decadent treat that I hope you enjoy as much as I do. 

There is lots of seating, free WiFi, and although I have not eaten much here, there is decent food. Be careful of the tall palette table though. I skinned my knee on it one morning and that was a real bummer.",NhgU7RhuYYFmpkb1jlYJ6Q,27,23,4,zgKGsZn-GEO_2v7vwD2PMA

5996458,2018-02-25,0,wZJOlSwUZcVQuLt9sZeV2A,"This is my favorite spot so far to come and study. Located in the Gramercy complex. It's small and tucked away next to raw fitness. 

The staff is super welcoming and friendly. My study group and I came here three weeks in a row to study together. The only downside is that there's no shade on the back window area so it can get hot and the sun can get in your eyes if you're studying at one of those tables. 

My favorite coffee is the white mocha with almond milk. I'm lactose so it's a plus they have the almond milk substitute for me instead of regular milk. 

The WiFi in this coffee shop doesn't time you out after two hours which is a plus compared with Madhouse coffee. 

I also really like how you can study in the court yard outside of the cuppa in the center of Gramercy. Overall, I would suggest this place for studying as well as coming to dine at one of their various tests restaurants.",P0rGN5mDue55uIiAzkrRlw,0,0,4,WQ_AtakAFKbAK3x24hZN6g
