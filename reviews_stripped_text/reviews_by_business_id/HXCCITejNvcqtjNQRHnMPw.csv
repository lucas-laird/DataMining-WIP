The food is okay, in my opinion nothing special and more 'Americanized' Mexican food. Tables were dirty as well as the bathrooms. Staff was considerate surprisingly with the customers they deal with on a daily basis.",HrBOg27wfZoFLNcFHXi0oQ,0,0,2,wrOVVy_SdC9xdg6w0ahy9Q

They workers here are always courteous and provide excellent customer service. When I allow myself to splurge on the fries, I always want then we'll done and crispy. This is the only location that gets it right the first time around. 
The drive through I also fast and accurate here. 

I enjoy the 8 layer veggie burrito without the cheese and sour cream. They are currently 2 for 5$. My wife enjoys the fish and shrimp tacos that are now available.  Try the 1$ strawberry lemonade with real strawberries, it's delicious.",rwsz4-xScU0KwwRArsHZhQ,0,0,5,kRsrxrHj3VRkm3eYp69t8Q

However, this particular location probably isn't the best. In one visit I tried to order a shake, ""no, our shake machine is down."" Ok, that wasn't the most polite response. Then once I paid I was asked if I'd like any hot sauce, I said mild, ""we don't have mild."" Lol this one visit soured my opinion on this location.",sn3UUrbV6yK4VuuXbtnwYg,0,0,3,8Efkf0LMd1xgkw3ngrezLA

I typically pick up large quantities of tacos whenever I need to stop by a job site so my guys can eat. Plus, it makes me look really nice when I buy lunch for everyone! I'm typically a jerk ;) lol jk

I mostly choose this place because they are cheap!",yZpzRSK00hFeLNnwOf8R1g,6,5,3,NxZoJSzmHU28_0fQd_SBHQ

Coincidentally, I was parked in parking lot checking voice mail and they brought me correct order. Would not have been happy if I  without my fish tacos.

4283594,2016-02-13,0,HXCCITejNvcqtjNQRHnMPw,"So why 3 stars? Well, we ordered the Epic Chicken Chipotle Burrito and the Epic Carne Asada Burrito. I think I expected Moe's or Qdoba quality for the price. It was more upscale than Taco Bell but not as good as Moe's or Qdoba. Our burritos were decent but just seemed to be lacking in flavor.

On a positive note, the churros were excellent! So if anything, I recommend the warm, cinnamon sugar goodness that their churros bring.",dW8VyCd9gkVyKkmBPYOlmg,0,0,3,p5IIBSwi6l3u2d8fNSsbIA

Unfortunately this Del Taco is directly across the street from my housing complex. Moving in, I thought, hurray -- when I want greasy tacos and the morose feeling that comes with eating fast food, I'll go here!

I'm being facetious - kind of - but I have actually enjoyed Del Taco in the past. The tacos aren't terrible and are usually quite cheap. Quesadillas usually have lots of cheese and the spicy chicken burrito is one of my fave indulgences.

BUT my husband and I came here on a week night and sat in the drive-thru FOREVER. On top of our horrendous wait we got sub-par food (even for fast food standards). My chicken burrito was half-filled and barely warm. I asked for a crunchy taco in place of what was a soft taco in a combo meal, and they gave me - nothing! Yes, nothing. They just didn't bother to give me the crunchy taco I asked for.

Very bad experience here. Oh, but they do give a GOOD military discount.",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,2,2,1,CphnDuKp2ADkGk-vIKF8SA
