I returned a few weeks ago for dinner with a group of 6. 
I was very disapointed with the bread basket, banana bread and carrot cake , this is nice for a brunch , but for dinner ? I don't know.
I ordered the quiche , which was pretty good, but it also came with a muffin ( strange combination ? ) and a fruit plate,,,, 
Overall the restaurant is good and the food is nice , but I don't think they should open for dinner , or then maybe change their menu..",MgTR_Hp2YhIDaodXcZgIhw,1,0,3,6l-X3tUkQxHw9lP8XDc4BQ

We were early (8:30a) so our service was great, our coffee never ran low. I ordered the crab cake Benedict and was disappointed. The spinach was not seasoned at all and the small drip of hollandaise sauce was lumpy; the seasoned potatoes were bland. My boyfriend ordered the corned beef hash (one of his favorites for breakfast) the corned beef was clearly not fresh-made and came out as a slab of beef. The highlight of our breakfast was the apple streusel muffin that came with his breakfast. It was hot and gooey and we both really liked it. Sadly the muffin and service do not make up for the rest of the mediocre breakfast and we will not be returning.",oisQ6O_uV70PhWLqaNhbIg,1,0,2,ApuTSdVKzo_9J7YjszrKTw

One thing you can't miss is the dessert sampler trio for $4.99! I don't usually have dessert, but this was really good. You get a small dish of apple crisp, bread pudding, and a brownie with ice cream! My wife and shared it and it was enough for the two of us. Very tasty! Can't go wrong here. Staff was very friendly and helpful. We went on Valentines Day for lunch and had a coupon which said it was not good on holidays.

While it is located in a big shopping center on Rainbow and 215, it is all the way in the back of the center, along with Chili's and Sammy's Woodfired Pizza.

Anyway, this place is good for all day long breakfast served. I usually get the mixed berry pain perdu and haven't been disappointed. Some servers seem to favor the older patrons.

990981,2013-12-04,1,pRlO48w4GkWEPEYIH2tHsw,"We were served the artichoke frites with the lemon-basil aioli.  The aoili (which is similar to a may base) had a shiny, dark yellow, coagulated film over part of it.  We touched the sauce with a finger and found it was barely cool.  When we pointed it out to the waiter, he basically acted like, so what's the problem with that?  When we asked if, because it's a mayo base, maybe the darker shiny film may not be safe to eat, he acted the same way, as if he didnt understand why we had an issue.  We were not offered a solution, just that we could use a marinara sauce to dip them in instead.  

The manager, who was busy helping our friendly -- but sometimes very absent -- server deliver his orders, must not have been informed of the aioli issue, because he did not speak to us about it.  

Beyond that, the food (a mussels dish with spicy marinara sauce and pasta) was good, except for the flavorless french bread and something that resembled whipped butter but tasted more like whipped vegetable oil that we were served before the meal.

But because of the possible gastrointestinal hazard of an aioli sauce and the lack of concern about it, i just can't bring myself to make this a 3",vgLTRCqySMgyae2zrh5ITg,0,0,2,VTozFzi1L1nUulWGuAiA5Q

1182818,2010-08-11,0,pRlO48w4GkWEPEYIH2tHsw,"My favorite thing about Mimi's is their bakery items, from the signature bread basket they bring you before your meal with slices of carrot bread and baguette (along with a cholesterol-free whipped spread) to the choice of muffins that come with certain meals and can also be ordered separately. Their muffin choices include carrot raisin nut, blueberry, buttermilk spice, and my favorite, honey bran.  These muffins are so good that I sometimes order a four-pack to go.

Mimi's is open for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and offers an all-day breakfast menu.  It is by no means a health-oriented restaurant, although they do attempt to make some concessions to the health-conscious.  There is a ""Fresh and Fit"" menu, from which you can order egg-based dishes without the yolks, and a ""Just Enough"" menu, from which you can order entrees in more moderate portions.  

The prices are affordable even on a student's budget.  A regular entree is lot of food, and after enjoying the breads from the signature bread basket and having some soup or salad, you should be taking home at least half of your entree for another meal -- unless you're a total glutton.  

I couldn't find any indication that Mimi's uses chemical-free meats or meats from free-range animals, so I assume they don't -- which is no surprise because unfortunately that's the norm.  My last time there, I ordered the Mediterranean Chicken Fettucini, which was not the healthiest of dishes in terms of calories or cholesterol, but it tasted all right.  My main complaint is that some of the chicken pieces contained tendons, but that's an issue with most tenderloins.

Mimi's is popular with families and offers a wide range of dishes and a unique and interesting atmosphere.  I've been there a few times, and the service has always been adequate or better. Because of its bakery items, it's a good bet that I'll go there again -- especially since I got that breakfast coupon in the mail.",wM1cuy_w6qsdWLeqQFWqVA,0,0,3,JAbCjIxtCrA3JOEwSQTrKA

I chose the corn chowder soup and the chicken piccata. They were both delicious. I had the soup as my sister recommended it. It was so good. I had never had it before. The chicken piccata was grilled and that was a nice change from the usual breaded or flour dredged.

The menu is very different from the old, multi-page full of goodies menu.  Supposedly they are trying to be more ""French"" now instead of Louisiana-inspired.  The new potato gratin based eggs benedict was good and fresh and the quiche Lorraine my sis ordered was still the same--yummy, cheesy and filled with bacon.  The fruit sides were pitiful, hard pieces of unripe fruit.  They don't offer muffins or quick breads vs fruit sides anymore, you need to order them ala carte.  When I mentioned to the MOD, Luis, that the only reason I wanted to bring my sis to this place is they don't have a Mimi's in Hawaii and I was a cheerleader for their food, especially the lovely sized meals and the hot muffins.  So sad that things have changed, and not necessarily for the better.  Thank you for the service, Luis (and server), but I am still dropping a measly 2 stars on this experience because of the menu change, the freezing temps in the dining area (which patrons applauded when the fan stopped blowing, that's how cold it was), and the fact that the entire dish wasn't good enough for more praise.

2318855,2012-11-07,3,pRlO48w4GkWEPEYIH2tHsw,"I don't like chain restaurants because they almost always disappoint. The food is bland and tastes prepackaged and/or overly salty, the portions are strange (either way too much or hardly enough french fries to cover the plate) and the service isn't the best. 

Mimi's is no exception. 

My girlfriend and my friend and I came here around lunch time on a Saturday afternoon because it is close to my house and none of us felt like driving very far. I immediately regretted the decision once I started looking at the menu and watching the food travel through the hands of the waiters in our section. 

My girlfriend ordered cinnamon french toast. It was dry and took too much effort to chew and eat. My friend ordered some type of eggs benedict. I ordered a grilled cheese sandwich with fries and a cup of tomato soup. 

You can't really mess up a grilled cheese sandwich, right? That's what I thought. Yet, somehow, they were able to make it taste bland and dry. The fries were okay, but I only received about a handful of them. The waiters and chef see the plates before they are taken out to the tables, right? They can tell the plate looks like it was thrown together by a three year old, right? Awful. 

 The tomato soup is the only thing worth talking about because it is pretty consistently good. And it is probably the only thing on the menu that is consistently good and the only reason why this review gets more than one star. It is also the only reason I was able to enjoy my grilled cheese sandwich (dipping - yum!)

Another thing that really bothers me: waiters who are obviously trying to sell you something. We said we didn't want any drinks. You don't have to tell me or ask me 4 more times if I want to try the new mimosas.  I already ordered a diet soda and a water. And I already said no - politely. Please don't make me feel like I'm walking through a used car lot on President's Day. 

And I'm usually not extremely critical of service... but seriously, guy? And to top it off, the service was extremely slow.

Every time I go to a chain restaurant, I regret it. Never again. And honestly, guys, with so many other mom and pop-type places opening up, spending $10-20/person at Mimi's really isn't worth it.

A real alternative to Cheesecake factory! The bread basket is also very good...I love the poppy seed bread and the walnut bread---I always ask for seconds!

The decor in Mimi's is based off of New Orleans; they had plenty of paintings/frames of jazz artists, bourbon street & the chandelier/lighting was unique :) I wonder how busy it was this past Sunday for the Superbowl?! Anyway, I enjoyed my lunch & I will be back again!

*only thing I don't like is the location, people in the Arroyo shopping center can barely see Mimi's cafe because it's at the very end of the shopping center.

Their dinner menu used to be filled with non-exciting and bland American dishes such as a tasteless pot roast that was drowning in gravy and dry meatloaf that tasted like flavorless ground beef. The new menu is more adventurous, and it matches Mimi's decor and atmosphere. 

Tonight, I feasted on Carbonara a la Mimi's with an appetizer of French Onion soup. Let's start with the soup - Meh. The cheese was melted and stringy, just the way I like it. The soup itself was a bit salty and had the consistency of gravy. I did like the small, toasted piece of baguette that was hiding under the cheese. All in all, I don't think I'll be ordering the French Onion soup any time soon. 

The Carbonara a la Mimi's was tasty. It had thick chunks of prosciutto and a generous helping of peas. The sauce was mixed-in and wasn't too heavy, and the noodles were cooked al dente.

The entire meal was nothing to write home about, but with their updated and exciting menu, I'll definitely be back to try other French inspired cuisine!",d_DPeh-LX77efXj6fiMLhw,0,0,3,_i1lEEweiaOeQmmaClBCwQ

This was a tuff one to rate because I wanted to give it 4 stars but service is a big part of my critique and that was a miss big time! let me start from the beginning.

So we walk in and notice its pretty busy the hostess writes down my name and says its gonna be a 5 minute wait well 10 minutes pass and we still haven't been called and we notice people who have came in after us are getting seated before us so i go up to the hostess (who is a different guy this time) and ask him when were going to be called he looks for my name but its not written down so we tell him we had been waiting there a while,I told him the other hostess supposedly wrote our names down and he said we would be sat next well we weren't anyways to make a long story store we finally got sat! Apparently being a hostess at Mimis is rocket science and these guys failed. 

Ok moving on the waitress was very friendly approaches us right away we both wanted a mimosa and the waitress suggested we do the mimosa flight which was only 25 cents more I believe and included a bottle of  champagne (each) and 3 different glasses to mix it with strawberry lemonade, orange juice, or cranberry we ordered it why not for only 25 cents more! We ordered the crab cakes for an appetizer they were good not great but good my moms recipe is way better. I ordered the french toast with eggs and sausage the french toast wasn't anything special and the eggs  were actually brown on the bottom they were burnt! the sausage was good though. My mother in law ordered an omelet which came with a pumpkin muffin she said the muffin was ok and the omelet was good. 

Now onto the service I wasn't impressed with the service its as if we were forgotten about once she set down the food I don't recall her returning until she dropped the check off (which luckily for her I didn't mind it because I was having a good conversation with my mother in law and enjoying being out... fyi I use to be a server I know what good and bad service is she wasn't that great so between her, the hostess and the ""ok"" food I'm giving this place 3 stars.

Considering this was during a slow lunch, waiting 10 minutes for the server to come over and introduce herself was a bit ridiculous. We ordered the calamari as an appetizer, which comes with a tomato sauce on the side. When we finally got our appetizer, there was no sauce. I asked the waitress (who I will not name) if it came with the marinara sauce. She gave us a curt, ""no, it's not served with anything."" And then asked if we would like ranch to dip the calamari in. I grabbed a menu, just to make sure that I hadn't read anything wrong, and sure enough it says that the calamari was served with a warm pomodoro sauce. I got another waiter's attention to get the sauce (after ours ignored my attempts to get her attention), and our waitress got very snotty and butted in. All we wanted was the sauce that was served with our appetizer... The salads we ordered were good, and after we got a little rude with the waitress, she spent the rest of our meal trying to make up for her rudeness.

The initial free bread basket they give out, comes with this bread.  Tip: before they bring that free bread basket out, ask for ALL CARROT RAISIN BREAD.  Best paired with butter and it is spectacular and super YUMMERS!

As for the rest of the restaurant, all the food is pretty good.  I especially love the Italian selections of Asparagus Ravioli, and Chicken Parmesan.  The Asparagus Ravioli is definitely something different and pretty good!  The Chicken Parmesan is a HUGE dish and the chicken is breaded with an extremely crispy and yummy shell.  

Their menu is pretty extensive with a number of selections to choose from and they have a special menu with special deals for $12.99 that include a soup, entree, a dessert, and an ice tea.  Pretty good huh?

My sister got the lunch deal, I got the Chicken Alfredo with the side of Corn Chowder and we also got the trio appetizier.

First off, sign up for their emails because they have coupons just about every week.  Of course, coupons also show up in our newspapers too so we can't help but take advantage of their BOGO specials.

One thing we both love are their house made crab cakes.  They serve them up in a few different ways - as an appetizer, benedict, and omelette.  We love them all!

The Crab Cake Florentine Benedict is griddled with spinach, poached eggs, and lemon hollandaise sauce.  They serve this until noon, and it comes with red potatoes, freshly baked muffin and juice.  ($9.99)  This is my go to choice when I'm dining there.

Another version is their Crab Cake Omelette.  It's a three egg omelette with red and green bell peppers and green onions.  The crab cakes sit on top of them, and they have hollandaise sauce, feta cheese, and diced tomatoes on top.  Also served with their potatoes, muffin and juice. ($9.99)

We've also enjoyed their Crab Cake appetizer, which is also griddled and comes with a citrus remoulade and balsamic baby greens.

The Husband also enjoyed their Asparagus and Brie Quiche, which also has bacon and tomatoes in it, and some fruit on the side.

We mostly come around for brunch, so we can't say much about their dinner menu.

It was a great place that my good friend suggested cuz we were both hungry AND excited to catch up with each other.  

Located just outside Las Vegas it has ample parking and a french charm to it.  From the entrance to the inside...it's really got a warm feeling to it.

Don't remember what my friend ordered but I know her's came with a muffin--- she got the carrot raisin muffin, which was YUmmy!! I liked the two different flavors and they seemed to really go together and complement each other.  My benedict was the perfect size for my appetite.  The side fruit wasn't that sweet but the benedict really made up for that.  They're one of my favorite breakfast meals and Mimi's really delivered on taste & quality.  

My ultimate favorite here was the coffee! It was incredibly delicious, not too strong and not to sweet.  Perfect for a great breakfast with my girl friend and with a wonderful breakfast.
