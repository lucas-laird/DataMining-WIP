Started with  the grilled  chicken  wings which were so good on their own-just the right amount of spice not too hot. Everyone  loved them!  Then, came our nachos.. My husband and I had spicy Thai chicken(again,  not overly  spicy IMO)  and the pulled pork nachos. We shared,  and  Both  really  hit  the spot. Finished  the evening with fried ice cream nachos.. Not sure I can put those into words.  Our server, I believe  his  name was Greg,  also on top of his game! You won't  be disappointed.

45345,2017-02-19,0,G6BwYw_0_atLPTzI1uokIA,"Really good place if you want the Caucasian Mexican food experience. The most authentic item we tried was the 6 dollar street corn. Very good!  The shredded corn chips used as a garnish on the chicken tortilla soup were stale. Besides that error, it was a good soup for those Gringos who don't like too much chili heat in their soup. The dip trio was pretty good. 2 good tasting items and the most bland salsa ever. Mennonites would think this stuff is underwhelming. The chicken on my nachos lacked the pop I thought I was going to get by looking at it. Good rich chili color but did not perform as expected. I was impressed with the naked wings. Flavor and visually appetising, a good start. 

If you are looking for authentic Mexican food with an edge keep driving east. If you want a trendy place to fill up on chips, cheeze, toppings, and good Americanized versions of Mexican classics while
Staff and management make an effort which is nice. This place is good enough.",vHSm0P2ty5WXeCgjA2W6Cw,1,0,3,WAAnYnNujtHBKgXVyiACAQ

I have attended shows at the Henderson location.  I have had a business meeting there.  I've simply gone there on Date night.  I just cannot say I have ever liked any of the food that I have tried.  I've everything from the Nachos to the enchiladas and it just wasn't for me.  It's a hair pricier.  Not terribly, but a hair.  Maybe I just think that because I would have rather not spent the money on something I didn't like.  

But I did try.  The reason it gets at least another star is because the staff has always been good to me, the atmosphere, the look of the place, and even just the cleanliness of the restaurants, are important to me.  I won't be rushing back at all, but with all the advertising and billboards they have, they must be doing something right.  I'm just not a fan.",utEbZHYFHWCSM3_-9K7Smw,2,0,2,3_guv_UF_5BADGCHwEpfWQ

Con: I think the food is horrible. Beef tacos seemed like what I would get at del taco. Nachos are supposed to be what they are known for but we paid almost $20 for nachos that just seemed very basic and lacking of excitement.

203223,2015-11-19,0,G6BwYw_0_atLPTzI1uokIA,"I always got a kick out of the Nacho Daddy name--I have a 5th grade sense of humor.  

So when they opened a location in my neighborhood near Summerlin, I was super excited to try them out!

As the name suggests, they specialize in nachos.  TOFU NACHOS EXIST, y'all!  Try them if you're a veggie.  

Also, the tortilla soup is a MUST.  I am Mexican so I know what I'm talking about.

If you are over the age of 30, you will get a kick out of the music videos that they show when there's not a game on (or they still show them but on silent so patrons can watch football, basketball etc..)  These are classic, hilarious and often mind boggling music videos from the 80's.  Remember when Eddie Murphy was singing about his party girl?  

The staff is very accommodating.  My friends and I sit at the bar which is usually not over-crowded.  The bartenders are attentive, friendly and knowledgable about mixed concoctions and tequila.  Yes, they offer a shot with a scorpion in it.  Be brave!  

On Weds night, they hold trivia night.  The questions are tough.  My friends and I are Public Ivy grads and we usually come in close to last lol.  Put your team together and if you win, I think the prize is a 50$ gift card (not sure since we've never won lol.)  It's a lot of fun and a great way to meet people!

Not sure why this place isn't busier with the creative food, great service, entertainment and reasonable prices.

4 of us ordered, 3 meals were right, 1 not. Flagged down a waiter to explain the problem and he reordered the meal for us. Other 3 ppl were more than 1/2 way done with their food when the last one arrived.
We also ordered White Peach Margaritas thinking we could use the 'buy one/get one' coupon and never realizing it meant ONE coupon ONLY for food or drinks. Got $12 margaritas that were NOT fresh, but a mix. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY! They were awful.
So, we ended up using one coupon and our nachos for 4 of us plus 2 margaritas @12 each and our bill came to $84.

My Sweetie had the enchilada nachos and I had the Thai chicken nachos. My Sweetie's plate was delicious but the Thai nachos are by far the most tasty thing I have eaten maybe ever. Spicy with layers of flavor, texture,and complexity. Who would have known that nachos could be raised to that kind of level. We didn't have any adult beverages because he had to go to work and I had some things to get done after dinner. But next time I plan to check out the guava Margarita and maybe a Scorpion Shot.

354538,2014-11-30,2,G6BwYw_0_atLPTzI1uokIA,"We ate at this new restaurant yesterday - Saturday - about 2:00 pm.  

SO MANY reasons why we will never go back there.

1 - With a name like Nacho Daddy, I would expect that the place would offer a lot more with respect to Nachos - build your own, nacho bar, etc.  This restaurant had none of that - at least we didn't see it.  Our group did order one order of nachos - enchilada style - YUCK - so little melted cheese - you could barely see it.   Not great.  
Sent back to kitchen to add a few beans and it took almost 20 minutes - the table was done eating by the time the order came - note:  the restaurant had less than 50 people in it...

2 - Being a new restaurant in this area, they should be better.  Surely there was a manager on duty - but not once did he/she ever walk around and check each table to see how the meal/experience was going...

3 - The chips and salsa and guac ($10) was good - but we will not be back ever.

4 - One person in our party ordered a bowl with beans/chicken - it was delivered on a black rectangular plate- HORRIBLE presentation - very unappetizing.  Although the chicken had good flavor.  For the $, it was not much food though.  How much do black beans/rick really cost you, Nacho Daddy?  Don't mind you making a profit, but you do need to reevaluate your menu pricing.  A little out of line - you have to compete with Chipotle and Cafe Rio just a block away - yes, they are fast casual and Nacho Daddy is not - but families that don't care about drinking a margarita or beer will not be interested in your restaurant more than once, based on your current menu.

5 - 3 people ordered a meal/iced tea and 2 had only chips/guac/salsa/tea -- our bill was $70 (before tip without bar drinks).  For lunch, that is ridiculous.  

We will go down the street another block and go to Cafe Rio - it's fast casual, but quality food and fresh ingredients - and the entire meal for us would have been closer to $35...

I'm placing my bet now - Nacho Daddy's will never make it at this location.",8h1n9EAM36TO3gF4cHlydA,5,1,1,u-Pe2BGQw0rsfqO-7JSxJw

The service was prompt and friendly.  We all had drinks in a very short period of time.  The menu is pretty long - there is definitely plenty to choose from.  What I particularly like are the variations on standard Mexican dishes.  For instance, they have Thai chicken nachos and filet mignon nachos.  One of my friends sticks to a more vegetarian/vegan diet and this is the only Mexican place I have ever seen that has vegan options. 

I split the Supreme Tostada Nachos with a friend.  The food was delicious.  The nachos came out as a decent sized plate, more than enough to split if you're averagely hungry.  

The interior looks like it can be split in two, with sliding panels on top of a half wall so that it can split up the bar and the dining area.  I imagine this makes it better for families and helps keep the place a bit quieter.

My favorite dishes on the menu hands down are the vegan nachos and the fish tacos. Insane in the membrane delicious! Queso was incredible and the drinks, well, let me just say - the margaritas taste like magic liquid gold - smooth and rich! Not sure about that Scorpion shot they talk about but hey - I'm game. Maybe just once. 

The staff is awesome! The hostess was so smiley and bubbly. The servers were crazy attentive, polite, friendly and super nice. They made us feel right at home, even though it was our first time there. It was like a Norm from Cheers moment - everyone seemed to know our name.

I have been to Nacho Daddy many times and I'm never disappointed. However, my last experience was dinner for my birthday with my whole family was terrible. The Golden Knights game was on so they were very busy.

It was a group of 7 people, which the hostess told us would take 15 minutes to set up our table. Understandable. However, apparently our table had been ready for 20 minutes without us being seated because they simply forgot about us. Then getting to our table and ordering drinks, it took a very long time for us to get our alcoholic beverages. Service was not as good as usual, but it was probably because they were busy from the game. 

*Important* I ordered the vegan fajita bowl and I received something that looked like it. I took a bite out of the ""vegan chicken"" and realized it was not vegan and ACTUAL chicken. I was very upset and told them the fact that I haven't eaten chicken in over three years. They also gave one of my family members a salad with onions, which he said no onion because he is highly allergic. 

Needless to say, they paid for our meal, which is what they should have done. But I want to make sure that the vegans and people with allergies out there check their food before they eat it so they don't get sick for the meat allergy or other allergies.

Start to Finish:

- Visited approximately 2 weeks after their official grand opening. All the paint and decor looked almost identical to Firefly (restaurant in this space before it became nacho daddy). 

- Great Mix of 80's and 90's music playing with accompanying music videos, but was weird to see/hear at Nacho Daddy. 

- Very large menu with only 1 page of nacho dishes. I was disappointed in the selection of different nacho dishes and the fact that the rest of the menu was simply a Mexican restaurant menu. Also, the nacho dishes were listed as appetizers. I was told they would be enough for a meal. I was hungry when I finished my plate of nachos and was hungry when I left the restaurant. 

- Purchased the Florentine and Nacho Average Burger Nachos. The Florentine were absolutely delicious and were a play on an Italian dish essentially with prosciutto and some other goodies on top. The burger nachos were not too bad. We had the snores dessert nachos to finish things off which were pretty interesting/tasty.

- The prices were a bit high for nacho appetizers $12-$15+.

- my wife was excited about their extensive/diverse, coffee menu. Unfortunately, they staff was not trained on how to make any of them and only regular coffee was available. A let down.

- Our server was nice and the service was decent. We had to wait a long period to get the check as the waitress seemed to disappear for a bit. Not the do all end all, but not the smoothest so would have liked. 

- OVERALL, the food was yummy, prices were a bit high, and it was a cool place to go as a novelty.  It seemed to have some identity issues with the mix of music, videos, etc. I don't think I'll be returning although I recommend giving it a try if you want to go somewhere different and are in the mood for Mexican.

It was busy and the servers were busting their behinds and we were still in and out pretty quick. The servers are all so kind and cheery.

There was a charity event going on outside and mariachis inside. Overall I would come back I just wouldn't order the nachos next time.

As soon as we entered we were seated. The restaurant was more than half empty. We let the hostess know that we needed to run to the restroom to wash our hands. A few minutes later we were back. We sat and selected our food and drink, pushed our menus away and waited. We would wait another 15 minutes. About 10 minutes in, two men were seated at the table next to us. They we're greeted within 30 seconds, given cocktail napkins, and their drink order taken. At no point in time did anyone who was employed by Nacho Daddy approach to our table. As I indicated earlier, we left after 15 minutes of no service. We went to Hussong's in Boca Park, where we were seated and had placed an order for drinks and food in 10 minutes. My only other experience with this location of Nacho Daddy was when my daughter and I came here and ate, the service was good, until we needed a check.

We arrived during happy hour and i must admit their house margarita is amazing! I wish they offered a smaller portion of their nachos during happy hour sometimes you dont want a massive mound of food at $10.95 a plate. I ordered the bbq chix nachos which my friend warned me not to order because they are a bit robust. They arrived and she was not wrong - there was too much going on on the plate. The bbq sauce was overpowering and salty, the cheese sauce got lost under everything and just coated your mouth, the onion strings were salty and the chicken was salty. I suppose it came out as it should have but i make these at home minus onion strings and never get this kind of intense flavor. I wouldn't order them again. My friend ordered the hamburger nachos which were an odd flavor combination but good. My other friend ordered the fish and chips which tasted of old smelly fish. We blame him for ordering that in a restaurant that serves nachos, but not sure why thats even on the menu. 

The service was great, quick and friendly. They have a pretty varied menu to choose from if youre not a fan of nachos. I love nachos but will stick to my real Mexican restaurants to satisfy my appetite.",4vj_0BQeXjCyNB7ESS5mGg,1,1,3,ezvxf-m9kimzfnFxDyv_dQ

He decided to order off the a la carte menu, but it didn't come with all the sides or fideo soup like other restaurants do. I ordered the chicken fajitas which were bland and nothing memorable.

We had chimichangas as an app, I had the huevos rancheros and my boyfriend had the Fiesta nachos. Everything was delicious. Both the nachos and my entrée were generous portions. We each had a house Margherita and they were very good, and only 5$ each because it was happy hour. Our bill was just under 40$. Our server, Mikey, was great, very friendly and attentive. And he also honored our coupon even though they usually don't during happy hour. The atmosphere was very nice: they had 80s music videos that we were very entertained by but the music wasn't so loud where we had to yell to each other (think Yardhouse). I don't think it's fair that other reviews compare this to more authentic Mexican restaurants since I don't think it's the point of Nacho Daddy.

We normally come week day after noons and it's slow and quiet, which is perfect for laid back lunch. Last night we decided to try dinner time, and the atmosphere was totally different but still awesome. Wednesday nights are trivia night, and although we didn't participate this time, we sure will next. If you go for trivia plan on spending 2 hours or so there - that's what the dude told me it takes on average. There were lots of people playing and it was crazy fun just to be around. Busy nights and lazy afternoons - nacho daddy is good anytime of day. I heard they have brunch, I can't wait to try it. 

Anyways, last night I got nacho average hamburger nachos and they were awesome. They were exactly like a supped up version of Taco Bell nachos bell grande. If you are stoned or are crazy nacho cheese sauce: get this. It is the caviar of stoner food, I swear. I normally get the filet mignon nachos or the fiesta nachos when I go, which are also both AMAZING. I also tried the fried ice cream - super good. My SO has always liked his food too, but unfortunately I don't remember what he got as I was too immersed in mine. Just know he liked it as well. 

As far as service goes, I have always liked our waiters every time we go. However last night a guy named Alex (I think?) served us and he was hardcore working it. At one point I'm pretty sure I saw him running. Running through the place like James Bond just to make sure people get everything on time. That is a wild amount of  dedication to customer service. 

I would give this place six stars if I could just because of waiter dedication. Nacho Daddy is hardworking, full of awesome food, and fun and I appreciate it.",81TwDLaT--phE6d4ir67UQ,4,0,5,acHJ3_T7AqFdQAaNjNnspA

Weird communication issues when picking up my order, combined with an odd choice of takeout packaging- chips, cheese, and protein are boxed in cardboard similar to pizza carryout. Additional toppings are packed separately in Styrofoam and plastic cups. Initially I was put off by this but it grew on me- could add the sour cream, guac, and beans to my preferred level. Portion did not seem adversely affected by the box used.

Flavors though? Tasty. Chicken and encihlada sauce was well seasoned but not spicy, large rings of jalapenos made it easy to eat around them if you want, portion was large enough to share- maybe add on some tacos and this is easily dinner for two. 

Bonus star for having queso on the menu- one of the few places in town to do so, and one of the major things I miss from home! .",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,8,5,4,6jmuQ5GXe7EgmPEPtTqFXw

We had great service from Johnny. He looked familiar and found out he also was a waiter at my local location.  Wonderful!  He was attentive, funny and friendly.  Our drinks were never dry and it was done with a smile.  

Keeping with the known, we tried what we would usually order ~ Supreme Tostada Nachos as well as the Fajita Cheese Steak Sandwich.  The nachos were piled high with ingredients of meat, cheese, tomatoes, jalapeños sour cream and guacamole.  Chips were crisp and warm.  Delicious.  Our sandwich met the standards of the table.  Filled wonderfully with steak, onions peppers and quest.  Great sandwich indeed!

Bonus~ There is a free house margarita with Yelp check in.  Just a cherry on top of our fun visit here.  I was very satisfied and look forward to my next trip out this way!",xhhE0txKwQtRzgQVVdKkvg,9,7,4,GS9QgIQsc13kjwX5FAD56Q

You have to pay for chips and salsa and if you have more than four people the price doubles. Drinks are priced like a night club. Basic burrito is $11... Unless you want meat and it goes to $16+.

So the rest of us were already half way through our meals before my dad's came out. The quesadilla they ordered was supposed to have chicken and only had cheese. The waitress felt so bad for all of the mistakes that were made though she took my dad's meal, the quesadilla, and another 20% off the bill which made it 1/2 as much as it should have been.

However, its bearable for those nachos. They are not lacking in anything and possibly even better than the original because of all the delicious veggies.

Not only that, but the topping:chip ratio was on point. I hate nachos that have too many chips or way too much topping. This was perfection... tasty nacho perfection. They also have a whole page dedicated to delicious vegan options which I am just so giddy about. 
Boyfriends fajitas came out sizzlin! Which is great because that is the hallmark of a fajita that sometimes is lacking at other restaurants. He also would like to say that the fajitas were good and big enough of a portion to share between two people... come to think of it, I could have shared my nachos too. But I'm a fat greedy vegan girl who don't want to. I digress.
The service, food, and beer was all wonderful. The ambiance was nice too, lots of big TVs playing music videos (a lot of them from the 90s which was pretty entertaining).

- Spicy Shrimp Nachos ($15.95)

Everything was very delicious and our meal with drinks came out to a little over $50, so it was inexpensive for 4 of us to dine in. 

Food was good, atmosphere was pleasant, our server was on top of everything, we never had to wait on refills and she constantly checked up on us so excellent service on her behalf.",RUa2_2yuSwJtU7sTXz-omA,8,8,4,rFyerr-S-9qn7L7tq0AKkg

The selections are numerous and everyone at the table was pleased with their choice! They even have a great selection of veggie entrees if that's whats you are craving. I tried the Chimichanga with filet and a Nacho Daddy Margarita. Both were fantastic!!  
Normally I take it easy on the appetizer to save room for the main meal, but not this time, they were so good.  Our waiter Brian made some suggestions and we're glad we listened.  The order was placed and out came the drinks and appetizer just minutes later.  
The inside of the restaurant is loaded with big screen TVs with a great mix of entertainment that will have you looking up to see the action while enjoying the great food.

Overall, an enjoyable experience. I didn't see any booths, which I find odd in a restaurant, but it was all good. Our server (I wish I caught his name), was friendly and knowledgeable about the menu, even the vegan options (not for me, heavens no, but for our vegan friend). I actually sampled the vegan chicken nachos and they were very tasty! 

I had the lobster and crab enchiladas, and requested no beans, double rice on the side. This is where things got dicey. First they came with the beans. No biggie, they took them back and replaced them with rice. Our server was clearly annoyed that the kitchen didn't follow his order. Then I requested guacamole (an extra $1.00). I received it, then another came! He was definitely annoyed, but I got 2 for the price of 1, so I was happy. 

The enchiladas were tasty, but definitely not the most filling. I'm glad I had the rice, otherwise, I'd have been hungry leaving.

We sat down about 10 minutes later and ordered immediately. The server was nice but he never really checked up on us. He was focused on 2 other tables that were a bit larger. We had to flag him down for water and condiments. It was hard enough to just get his attention with music blasting. 
The food was between del Taco and Robertos.  That's the only honest description I can think of. I opted for the queso dip and chips and quesadilla. My husband ordered the burrito, which was huge, but nothing phenomenal. The queso dip was made out of real cheese, but that was the only dish that stood out.

Our table ordered the Fiesta nachos as an appetizer and they were great. I ordered the Cheesy Enchiladas, and the other two in my party ordered the Chicken Quesadillas and Chicken Enchiladas. The food tasted great.

Our server was Alex and he was hands down one of the best and friendliest servers we've had anywhere. He was very nice and worked quickly and made sure everything was okay at our table and you could tell he was sincere and actually cared about the response.

One of the best experiences at this location, and a big chunk of it was because of Alex and his great service. Will for sure come back",lB15NGtwuMHqi3UX67uPMg,0,0,5,pChBrTNuINcpz-7ZqkYrrw

I needed a drink on a patio and Nacho Daddy has Union Jack on tap and/or a free house Margarita with a Yelp check-in. I skipped on the margarita (saved the offer for later though) and opted to share a pitcher of beer with my party. Union Jack pints were $7 and pitchers were $25. 

It was mostly about the atmosphere and alcohol so the only food I tried was the order of spicy shrimp nachos. It was good for what it was, bar food to soak up some of the alcohol. The service was great, our drinks were never empty. Not awesome but good enough to sit and sip on the patio. The beer selection does take it up a notch if you want something other than the usual tecate or modelo offered at most Mexican spots in Vegas.",u9w4LOoKYsM00Scb0HCH1w,4,3,3,YRacH27rhdJ8OBWyzEN85A

My friend knew a shocking amount of Nacho Daddy fun facts, which was kind of fun & made me feel more connected to it. We ordered the elote (corn), Vegan ""steak"" nachos then went carnivorous with 3 mix & match tacos to try (chicken breast, filet & fish). Everything was delicious! My friend even gobbled down the whole filet taco... without saving me a bite... it was that yummy. The huge plate of vegan nachos were totally not weird. The ""steak"" had steak flavor & tender texture... we scarfed the whole plate but, because it was vegan, we didn't feel weighed down. Our favorite, though, was the fish taco... with a creamy dallop of cole slaw & mango salsa... it will likely be my summer go-to. I've already dined there a 2nd time, but at the Eastern location...

Food was consistently good most likely because all recipes are made in their commissary kitchen.  We came during a late lunch so there was no one in the restaurant.  Food came out in minutes since we were the only ones in the dining area.   Our Nachos were delicious, the chicken tenders for the kids  did not look as fresh.  The chicken strips were an odd shape with a unique processed taste.  

I will always be a fan of Nacho Daddy I think it is a great concept.  One of my favorite features about the Summerlin location is the self serve craft beer area.  You can purchase a gift type cardin $20 increments and draft your own glass of beer.  They have many great selections of local and regional brews available.  Insert you card and pull the lever and your credits will be deducted form your card.  WHY DIDN'T I THINK OF THAT??!!! Great Idea give it a try.

I had to ask her if she was going to get us drinks and as if to be bothered she took our drink order.  By this time I knew the service was just going to get worse.  We have it the benefit of the doubt.  Just so happens the general manager walked by we voiced our concern and he was very quick to disregard the issue.  He was not listening to our concerns and basically said it was a simple oversight.  And it looks like we had drinks because we had water.  He was very unprofessional for being a general manager.

The food is awesome, and served in large portions.  I'd recommend starting with the Ceviche or Grilled Mexican Corn.  The Tortilla Soup is also delicious.  Their Signature Soft Tacos and the Fish Tacos were wonderful, and the Street Taco Combo is a favorite so far.  And finally, if you're in the mood for tamales, try the Mojo Pork Tamale.  Tasty!  I'm looking forward to exploring more of their menu in the future.

On my last visit for lunch I walked in and was struck by how ""normal"" the noise level was.  When this location was a different restaurant, it was always uncomfortably loud, but not now.  The noise level was very tolerable without dampening the fun (and almost exciting) vibe.  I've been back several times with just one or two other people, and also been there once with a large party.  TVs are all around on the walls and at the time were featuring one of the ESPN channels on several sets, and a very eclectic music video channel on the other.  Totally fun!

The staff always seems cheerful and eager to ensure everyone is happy--the waitstaff during every visit has always been fantastic.

We went in and were immediately seated, we arrived there around 6:30PM. We were treated by our waiter, Shawn, who served our drinks quickly. My table and I ordered the BBQ Pulled Pork Nachos for an appetizer and they were amazing! The size was large and honestly I would have eaten it as an entree. We ordered our entrees and I got the camp fire burger (not exactly that name, but around those words) with a medium rare meat and garlic parmesan fries. The meat of the burger was so juicy and the buns were toasted to perfection. The fries were made to perfection, all of the fries were crispy and they didn't lose their crunch through the entire meal. But the fries were just a little too oily but still tastes amazing. Overall, I would say A++ for the food and service. Thanks to our waiter for the amazing suggestion and service. 
The environment was nice. I liked that they had late 90s music playing in the background with the music video playing along. They also had sports games on tv like baseball, cross fit, and football. So A+ on the environment. 

So I went here two days after (July 26) and the service here was bad. But I don't completely blame the waiters. There was probably 3 waiters serving the entire restaurant which made our food service slow. I do not know exactly how long we were waiting here for our food but it was probably 30-45 minutes. This place has its good and bad days. Let's hope that if you do go here, you get here on a good day.",P4EPhH4mAmi-sya-wKAnSg,0,0,3,tIyWUBp6foBdPRvgsomZ-A

I ordered the bbq nachos with pulled pork. They were very good too! They really piled on the meat, which is appreciated, and as they claim, no chip was dry! 

Lastly, I ordered the spoke pie nachos with ice cream! The chips were warm and covered in cinnamon and sugar! Omg! If you are an apple pie lover, you have to try! I had never had anything like it!

We did the cheese dip with chips and salad and that was super yummy with the candle there to keep the cheese warm. Our server was super sweet and helpful but I forget her name - inside a lake outside a lake she kept saying to help us remember it was .. Enlake? Anyways she was super sweet and a great server. She kept my tea full and the food coming. We then did the enchilada combo and two orders of corn. I had a gift card so I was in for the tasting but my girlfriend could not get over the fact that 1 ear of corn was $6.50 when they are four for a dollar at the grocery store. We ate here last night and she's still talking about it today at lunch, wow she's in shock. I get it - corn is .25 at the store and $6.50 at Nacho Daddy LOL yeah sure they add cheese, salt, pepper, and mayo ...hmm does make you think. We ended the night with churro sundae's and OH YEAAA they were bomb. The little churro was warm and the ice cream was cold :) the whipped cream-a-plenty! We had a great meal thank you so much I will be back again oh and my friend wanted to tell you that you must lower the price on your corn, it's shockingly high :) ciao!

I had won the this event through a auction that ""Goodie 2 Shoes"" foundation held in May. We had no idea what to expect, all of us thought we were gonna get some tequilas that we never heard of and a bunch of different kinda NACHOS.  Boy were we wrong... What we got was a 4 course meals paired with a tequila cocktail. Most of us who have been to ND in the past just go for nachos-n-drinks.  I'm not sure if they have the items that we had on their regular menu but just knowing they are capable of preparing this menu and executing it to perfection just say a lot of the restaurant. They even made accommodations for 1 of the party members who is vegan and had a special menu. Her food was identical to the rest but made of vegan ingredients. Compliments to the Chef de Cusine.  I'm not gonna explain each dish but i will say it was ALL delicious (will post pics).  Now, i dunno how one would experience what we did last night but if its something that you wanna try all you have to do is ASK!!!

We really enjoyed it! 
Based on the reviews, we tried the filet nachos and the spicy shrimp nachos. Both were good but  spicy!
My teen got 3 small corn beef tacos and she said, ""These are amazing!""
We even bought a t-shirt!
But even though the price tag says $15, the server tried to charge me $20 for a shirt.
When I disputed it she said it rings up at $20. She was not willing to adjust, no matter what - even when the hostess agreed with me.
She eventually got the check adjusted but it took forever to get our check,  and then again forever to get my change.  
I was at the hostess waiting. Crazy!
10% tip that time.  Usually I pay 25% but I don't reward attitude.
We will be back, though.  Free margarita when you check in with an entree order. Nice!

When a runner finally dropped our appetizer (after dinner arrived and only after we reminded them), it tasted like it had been refrigerated since last week. My dinner came missing items and with incorrect sides. I asked for sparkling water and got soda water from the bar gun. We sat without napkins because no one bothered to stop by to check on us. I was finished after a few bites and it was obvious that I was and needed service, which took another several minutes of looking annoyed to get someone's attention. I asked for a to-go box and you'd think we'd get a server to ask about dessert or the check, but nope we had to flag them down for the check. I actually walked to the bar to pay because I refused to wait while they all stood around talking any longer. We are fantastic tippers, but they're lucky I even paid for my meal!

Food- Everything tasted really fresh, came quickly, all being delivered by friendly food runners. Was it mind shattering Mexican food? No, but it was all really good.

My biggest obstacle is the price point. All through my college years I survived on big delicious burritos because they were super cheap. So in my brain, I think Mexican food should be at least slightly inexpensive. 
We ordered 1 appetizer - Queso Dip- It was good.
3 entrees- 2 burritos and a plate of nachos.
2 soft drinks, and a single beer.
Our check with tip was $100! - OUCH!
I could name 8 places in LV that would be as good and 1/2 that price.

I would go back, if it was suggested.

I have been in the industry for over 10 years..we expect good service. Its super frustrating when you've spent $75 on 4 beers, 1 appetizer, & 1 entree,& dessert. That's a lot of money to spend to be sitting in an empty restaurant for over 2 hours, unable to get refills, napkins, etc..Service today was bad..sorry. Alex was our server, 2 of us showed up before the 3rd. We sat for about 10 minutes before Alex came by&said have you been helped..we said no..he said, ""ok are you ready to order then?"" We told him we'd start with 3 waters as we were waiting for our friend but we'd be getting drinks as well..It took 5 minutes after that to get 3 waters..& we were sitting right by the kitchen entrance&service well..that's crazy.He spilt one of the waters on the table NO BIG DEAL, I told him not to worry about it, it happens BUT WE cleaned it up before he got back with a towel.. never brought us napkins for our food after that. My friends got two micheladas&i got a beer with fresh limes squeezed..something most Mexican restaurants do nbd..well apparently it was a big deal to the bartender who awkwardly looked at our table&then complained about having to squeeze extra limes in my beer..look I do get it, being that I bartend too&people ring in funky stuff but hey you're a bartender and people want what they want..plus at least you had a cool lime squeezer to make it easier, my job makes me hand squeeze them..so you had it pretty easy the commentary wasn't really necessary especially since I could hear you at my table. Not cool. Anyways, my $9 beer was great thanks.Dip trio was bomb.com another server walked by&asked if we wanted more salsa, we said yes..it never came..&our server was unfortunately MIA. We were planning on sharing an appetizer&!an entree with the intent of getting another entree after if we were still hungry...but that never happened because we were so annoyed by the end of the nachos we said screw it, it wasnt worth the wait. I was going to get food to go for my boyfriend as well but I didn't want to wait any longer. Again, so frustrating cause there were literally 6 tables in the entire restaurant If that includes the bar top. We ordered vegan nachos for our entree since I don't eat meat..I've ordered these every time I come in but these were off. Smaller portion than usual & it was missing the green tomatillo looking sauce..whatever still ate them all anyways..about 3/4 through our meal our server reappeared from the room behind the curtain..guess he was eating at the same time, still check on your table while your eating or doing sidework just take 2 seconds then go back to whatever..when he finally did come back though I asked for more chips&salsa..my friend ordered another beer and my other friend ordered dessert just so we could get it in since we didn't know when we'd see him again..she was gonna order some ceviche as well but as she went to tell him &he started walking away so she said screw it..We got up&grabbed our own napkins&hot sauce by the way..We had our nacho plates&everything piled up on the table for SOMEONE to take off the table, no one did. Table touches&prebussing is so important it just makes it seem like you care even if you don't..It took 15 minutes after that for our chips and salsa to come out. FIFTEEN MINUTES FOR CHIPS AND SALSA..friggen crazy.&then dessert two seconds after that. I didn't want dessert I just wanted to nibble on the chips&salsa.... but the fried ice cream looked good..During dessert, Alex came over&asked if he could close us out because he was getting ready to leave... we said yeah..we tipped him $10 instead of the $14 we should have left but none of us were even stoked to leave $10 considering we weren't happy with our service&still left kinda hungry&upset. my friends&I were so frustrated that we were sitting there with no water refills & that we had spent so much time there just waiting around that I decided not to get anything else to go even though I knew my boyfriend was at home & hungry. Needless to say I was disappointed. I was stoked to go there after work today&after today's visit I'm not sure I will be back to this location which sucks cause its right down the street from my work& the food is so good. Another younger couple walked out before we got our food because they had been waiting so long to get their drinks..I saw quite a few people standing around near the keg cooler, I never once saw a manager on duty..I dunno if they were in the room behind the curtain too or if it was maybe the frumpy girl wearing a hoodie or what but that just isn't a good sign.

They saved the day on a last minute dinner that I planned for my friend on her birthday.. Well it was more like a happy belated since we were both so busy and this location is most convenient.

When we arrived the place was kind of dead and this was on a Saturday afternoon! Of course with that being said we were seated immediately and our server came over within minutes! Started off with checking In on YELP because they were running a special for a free house margarita when doing so. I always like to upgrade to the premium tequila because why not? Two Cadillac margaritas it is then! I wish I remembered our servers name but he was awesome! Very personable, attentive and made plenty recommendations on the menu. 

We started off with the Queso dip and my gosh! This Queso is just amazing! My friend really liked how cool it was that they bring it out with a candle underneath to keep it hot and that whole melting thing as your dipping your chips in.. YUM! After chowing down on that for a bit we were ready to order and because I just loved the sizzling shrimp fajitas from the location on the strip we went ahead and ordered that same dish for 2! You can never go wrong with shrimp fajitas and not to mention they brought everything out in a timely manner. I was a bit apprehensive at first about trying them out again but surely glad I did because my friend enjoyed herself and that's all that mattered! #MissionAccomplishedForTheBirthdayGirl.

We ordered nachos, a large beer and a margarita. All three were great, but the prices were a little tough to swallow (pun intended). Don't get me wrong, the margarita was very well done, and the spicy shrimp nachos were excellent as well. The $15 dollar price tag wasn't worth the portion size. Our bill came to $45 or so after taxes, and I just didn't think it warranted what we ordered. 

We'll be back again in the future, but I don't think we'll make this a regular stop. I think a price adjustment in the future is probably warranted (I think they've only been open for a week or so) and if so I think we'd come more often.

Or is it too much to ask for?! We ordered vegan chicken tacos, and separate vegan taco so it will make a total of 3 vegan tacos. Person on the phone told me that order comes with 1 taco, which isn't true, because I have ordered them before and I know that there are 2 of them (mind you, it was the same person taking my order every time over the phone and still didn't memorize menu items, very poor training). Then ordered cheese enchiladas plate and guacamole & salsa with chips. And guess what happened? - we got one vegan chicken taco plate order (which already comes with 2 tacos) and two separate vegan chicken tacos, 4 in total.

I really enjoyed my avocado tacos and Michelada. My husband asked about their beer special and the waiters reply was ""nope"" my husband was a little confused so he pointed out the board with the advertisement of the $2 beer again the waiter was a little rude with his reply of ""yup we put that there to get rid of it and we did"" so anyways fast forward to the bill. Apparently if your children are vegan they don't eat free! I mean the meal was free but they charged extra for the vegan chicken for both kids and extra for the black beans (which we didn't ask for) if given the option we would have said no beans because my daughter doesn't like black beans.

I would hear stories of my friend who would praise Nacho Daddy on his side of town for hours on end.  I was so close to going the one Downtown, however I was recalled home prematurely by my significant other.

This time.  This time, it was DESTINY!   My friends and I counted the days to opening when we first saw it was coming to our side of town.  The the time came.  We sat, we ate, we got full.  We left happy.

This place was awesome.  Great ambiance.  Awesome Servers.  Insane menu!  The prices may be a tiny bit higher than what we usually spend, but totally worth it.

I got the ""Fiesta Chicken Nachos"" with my now infamous custom order of Diet Cherry Coke.  

Both were spot on.  The Nachos were very tastey.  When they came, I didn't know how to attack it.  I accidently got a  little bit of cheese on my finger and when sucked my finger clean, it hit me!  My first bite of Nacho Daddys.  It was epic.

The Fiesta Chicken Nachos was very creamy, very rich (but not too rich) and there was definitely enough for me to take it home if I was sensible that day.  But I wasn't.  I DESTROYED the plate and it was glorious!

I swear up and down that it tasted like I was hitting pockets of CHOCOLATE in my nachos.  As crazy as that sounds and as gross as the prospect may be, it was good!

Our server was astute and prompt.  For being open for only a few days when we visited, the place was well put together and on the ball.

I came to Nacho Daddy on a wednesday for trivia, which begins at 7pm.  My first impression was that this place looked more like a sports bar than your typical Mexican restaurant, with TV's, a craft beer bar, and a large bar area.

The trivia was surprisingly fair and winnable, and there were about 8 teams so it came down to the wire.  The beer selection was very solid, at price points of about ($6-$8).  They also implemented a new craft beer bar where they put local or rarer rotating craft taps on the wall (about 6) and you buy a card and pour yourself some beer on your own.  I absolutely love this concept because I usually get flights to try new varieties.  It did not say what they charge per oz, but I would assume it would come out to about $7 for 12oz.

The person I came with had the burger, which he said was pretty good.  And the fajitas smelled amazing when they passed by.  I have also heard stellar reviews about their margaritas and their scorpion shots (not sure this location does though, however).

Finally, I had a coupon which they honored no problem.  This place is worth a try, especially on a wednesday since there's good trivia.  But I could even be back here to watch some sports in the future because the atmosphere and beer selection is quite nice for a Mexican restaurant.",JaqcCU3nxReTW2cBLHounA,0,0,3,RfYiiM-G24oFTiQcubXx9Q

First off, as a transplant from the East, I liked their beer selection, and enjoyed the Dogfish Head on draft! 
 
For an app, we started with the kale salad. It's very good, as it includes lots of different vegetables, but the kale itself needs to be  - well, not cooked, but rubbed or marinated - just sayin'.  This is a common issue with restaurants trying to include kale on their menu - it's a great vegetable but in most cases needs to be ""softened""/broken down rather than just offered chopped raw like lettuce. 

I shared two vegan fajitas entrees with my partner: Chick'n fajitas and ""flaming beef"" fajitas (a special)   - and both were not only delicious but very generously portioned! We couldn't finish our food! I love that vegan sour cream, vegan cheese etc are all part of the menu.  As per the standard of regular Mexican restaurants, you have your choice of corn or flour tortillas, and all the additional fillings besides the ""chicken"" and ""beef"" are provided - rice, beans, etc. Delicious and satisfying. 

There are many, many other vegan dishes - nachos, burritos, etc etc that we simply haven't had a chance to try yet.  
I will be back! Wish this chain could spread out to other states besides Nevada.  This is a great model of a conventional restaurant seamlessly offering delicious, satisfying plant-based dishes so that ""mixed"" groups of diners can all be happy.",lOCIsxpKPHzBJ56VkbJyUQ,0,0,5,BEjAnos6e00hBhJ_dGkPUw

So let's just say, I think I got three emails from my boss telling me how much she really  liked this place. And I agree.

As an appetizer, we ordered the nachos with filet mignon and why not since it's on the company's dime. It was really flavorful, so so good.

I made the mistake of ordering the Daddy signature fish tacos. The fish was bigger than the tortilla! It was only two tacos but I could only finish one. 

My boss ordered the Daddy signature chicken tacos. It was a little too spicy for her that she could only finish the one.

Everything started out fine the bartender/ waitress (?) came over and took our drink orders. I decided on one of the most popular nachos they sell, she took the order promptly. And that's when the place went downhill FAST. It took probably an hour to get our nachos. And when we got them they were missing 3 ingredients: yellow queso, fried jalapenos, pico de gallo. After telling the guy who ran us the food, he straight up told us ""I didn't think you wanted that on there."" Which was so confusing because I DID NOT SAY THAT. The only thing we wanted was to substitute ground beef for chicken. How could that have possibly meant that we didn't want three items on the already bland nachos? Then he argued with my girlfriend about how the cheese on it was the yellow queso. In the description it clearly had a comma separating ""cheese blend"" and ""yellow queso"" when she pointed that out he said ""Oh I guess you're right."" He took the nachos back... After waiting an HOUR to get the first nachos I can't tell you how surprised I was that the ""correct"" nachos came out not even two minutes later. I wish I was exaggerating, but they really came out in under two minutes. The next nachos we got were a joke. Nachos did not taste good, bland, basically just chips with guacamole. Still missing the fried jalapenos, and a new item the green avocado salsa. We weren't the only ones with issues the table directly next to us had a WAY worse experience, if that's even possible.

She was also nice enough to inform us the happy hour nachos consisted of nine chips so that was a hard pass.  We ordered the sliders, chimichangas and drinks.  Absolutely no complaints about the food.  Service as the night wore on became another issue.   Once our original server left we saw our new server one time.

Without them I would have said 1 or picked 0 if it was an option. Our waitress was overly rude, didn't know the menu, inconsiderate and unapologetic after everything else that happend. 3 out of 7 meals were wrong, a different one had a hair in it and with all this the she still couldn't find the decency to fill our glasses even through she passed us like 10 times and it was not even busy.  James the manager worked with us to fix any issues and stayed to talk to us and you can tell he was sincerely apologetic.

I tried them for the first time today and I probably should have stuck to the nachos the namesake suggests. I ended up getting the grilled cheese sandwich (stuffed with roasted Anaheim chilis, two cheeses, and applewood smoked bacon), because it sounded different and awesome. It was good, but nothing to celebrate, or probably even order again. The bread was a little too buttery tasting and there wasn't as much cheese as I'd expect from a grilled cheese. Bacon was good, but thin. I've gotta applaud the creativity, though.. This sandwich had so many things I like cramped into one package.

My wife went with a sandwich as well and got the cheese steak. It was actually quite small, and I didn't see any cheese on it at all. The beef was flavorful, but the bread also had that weird buttery taste. I like butter, but I'm pretty sure this was some kind of soybean oil based imitation. 

Overall, both sandwiches were good, and the sweet potato and garlic Parmesan fries we ordered were great.

I think next time I'll definitely be trying out their nachos, however, because the pictures and descriptions looked really good, and the food I did have just wasn't good enough to bring me back on its own.

We liked the bottomless chips and salsa. Chips were excellent but the salsas were average. Medium was pretty good, but the hot salsa made me laugh. It was just the same medium salsa with a handful of pickled jalapeños sprinkled on top.

The beer selection was pretty stellar, so if I'm ever looking for a place with great brews and appetizers, this is definitely a top choice on my list!",zFvW-hvtKJ7AAj_kZNXsBw,0,0,3,btvNG4hdHG2McY6JhBhepg

Decided to get a bunch of people together to have a great night out and go back to the place where we'd had such a great time previously. HUGE Mistake!
There was 10 of us, the place wasn't overly busy. We sat at the bar at first and the guy/girl bartenders were completely disconnected from the guests, so much that the couple next to us, commented by saying this here is a 3x ask bar. First is an attention getter, second is a request and thirds is a re-request. Right there I knew (being in the business) this was not the place I had visited months earlier. But I shrugged it off and thought well maybe the wait staff will be better. Boy was I wrong! We got to our table and Amy came over to take our drink order and see if we wanted some appetizers. We ordered drinks and explained the rest of our party would be arriving soon and that we'd wait. 15 minutes later we got our first drinks. Amy only had 3 tables, ours and 2 other 4 tops. We proceeded to wait for our stragglers, and then decided we'd get a couple appetizers and another round of drinks. Another 15 minutes passed, and asked twice if the drinks were coming we finally got them. So this time, we proceeded to order our food. Between the time we ordered and the food arriving we ordered another round, again 15 minutes later and several asks later, we got our drink and then moments later our food arrived. It was HORRIBLE! the street beef tacos looked like piles of poop on flour torts with a dusting of parmesan cheese across them, the chicken was canned chicken that looked like it was taken out of the can heated and layed in the soft shells. I've had better from a food truck. My wife got 1 taco and a side of beans and rice. Instead of Amy explaining the price she charged us $5.50 for the 1 taco and $3 per side. so my wife's meal was $11.50, getting the a full meal would have been cheaper. We had a few nacho plates that were okay (nothing spectacular), but they were lukewarm. For a place that has NACHO in the name you'd expect that they'd have some of the best if not the best, unfortunately, that isn't the case.
So to sum this experience up, this is the last 100+ Nacho Daddy will be getting from us, and unfortunately, none of my friends or family will be coming back until some drastic changes happen to the staff and food.",Agl8_zkI8rtYHrnCcaR2-g,0,0,1,NbeeTR93MF1dHyZWZdJpzw

Before we even got our simple waters 2 other tables seated after us had already received their food. During our entire time here we were never once actually greeted by our waiter. I had to get out of my seat to personally approach the assistant manager to ensure our food order had actually been put in because we had been waiting so long. Despite asking the assistant manager the status of my order I still was left clueless until about 10 minutes later when we got our food. I'll admit the food tasted good but the service was terrible. I've never been treated like this in my life. The only thing fast about this service was getting the check because it was brought to us less than 5 minutes after we received our food. I am never going back to this place because it is not just good food that counts. I also should note that the tables surrounding us were checked up on multiple times by different people and we had never been seen by anyone other than the man who brought us the water. After getting the check we waited a long time as well for someone to come pick it up so that we could actually be on our way out. No one even said goodbye to us when we left. I am not quite sure where the disconnect is but I know the workers there saw us sitting at our table not being helped and it is common decency to check on your customers. After this experience the meal really should have been free. I am very disappointed because even after personally speaking to the assistant manager when I got out of my seat to do so the assistant manager never came to check on us and make sure we were doing okay like she did the other tables.

4014406,2015-10-27,2,G6BwYw_0_atLPTzI1uokIA,"I can give it a good 3 1/2 stars!

Truth be told, we visited Nacho Daddy off the basis of a Groupon.  Without it, I was teetering on the fence about visiting here.  Mainly because even though I love me some nachos, I usually have no problem making it at home (and I do make a pretty mean one).  But in the end I saw some flavors on the Nacho Daddy menu that were intriguing.  It's not hard to make me happy when it comes to nachos, I mean I even like the ones at the local 7-11!  

The fam and I went on a weekend for lunch and was a bit surprised the place was fairly empty.  There was football on the TV!  Nachos!  Beer!  Women in tight tops!  Would have thought Nacho Daddy would have been more filled in for a sports day.  There were only like 6 - 8 tables taken when we got there, and a fairly empty bar area.

We were seated promptly at a nice corner table near the windows.  Our server was very personable and fairly quick.  Looking at the menu we all decided to get two nacho entrees to share and a salad to go along with it.  We decided on:

*Nacho Average Burger Nachos ($10.95) - seasoned ground beef, applewood smoked bacon, yellow queso sauce, red onions, tomatoes & shredded lettuce over house made corn chips

*Florentine Nachos ($11.95) - grilled chicken breast, sun dried tomatoes, bacon, spinach, topped with Asiago, Romano & Parmesan cheese sauce, all over spinach corn chips

*Kale Salad ($6.95 & a Nacho Daddy favorite) - kale with cucumber, corn, grape tomatoes, mushrooms, red onions & avocado with an agave citrus vinaigrette

You might think that with the advert of house made chips at Nacho Daddy you would get a complimentary bowl of them along with some house salsa at each table.  Isn't the chip supposed to be your strong point?  Why not a sample?  But not the case here.  If you want it, Bottomless Chips & Salsa are offered at $2.95 for every 4 guests.  Not a big deal, but it did kinda bother me a bit.  Oh well, price of doing business I suppose.

Didn't take too long for our orders to come out, maybe around 20 minutes.  All looked pretty fresh!  

Nacho Average Burger Nachos were good.  Basically like a cheeseburger on a nacho!  While delicious, I didn't think this was really something I couldn't attempt to make at home.  Chips were crunchy, with a fair amount of toppings on top.  But I could have done with more cheese on them, maybe a healthy layer of shredded cheese in the middle of the chip stack BEFORE adding the queso sauce and toppings?  I had a few spots there where my chip didn't get any cheese on them.

The Florentine Nachos were pretty to look at with all the Italian colors of red, white & green.  Thankfully they were tasty as well.  Grilled chicken wasn't dry, and the sun dried tomatoes and bacon added some good contrasting texture.  The white cheese sauce was yummy, but again there wasn't quite enough to go around!  Some of the spinach chips ended up being bare in spots!  

Surprisingly, the best thing we had on the table was the Kale Salad!  I would go back to Nacho Daddy just for this!  Possibly make it a meal next time with the addition of a grilled chicken breast on top!  This salad was downright great, even though the rest of my fam didn't like the red onion on it.  I think the vinaigrette is what made their kale salad really good.  It was sweet, sour & tangy, a good mix with the hearty kale & meaty avocado.  I just wish this sucker were bigger!  

The manager of Nacho Daddy came to our table towards the end of our meal and asked us how we were doing & if the food was to our liking.  I politely made a small comment about the cheese placement and he told me they would definitely look into making a change on that.  He also suggested on the next visit to try the Thai Chicken Nachos, his current favorite.  Pleasant guy, thanked us for coming in.

Overall Nacho Daddy is going in a good direction for a niche/theme restaurant.  The nachos were tasty but needs some work with getting more cheese in those nooks & crannies.  Also, maybe up the serving a tad?  When I think nachos I think a big pile of chips smothered in goodies.  Adding another little layer of chips would up the wow factor for these guys and add value to their pricing.  I wish the salad were a bit larger as well, but it was enough for three of us to share in smaller servings.

I'd come back again to Nacho Daddy if I had another Groupon handy.  I'm not sure if I'd be back right away without one though, there's just so many other places to dine if you're spending that kind of money.  However, their nacho combinations are hard to beat.

1. Because I love nachos/Mexican food. And 
2. Because they have vegan options! Yay! 
Well we got there around 9pm and the place was empty other than the one other table that they sat us right next to. Which is whatever. Looking at the menu, we see that the vegan nachos are $16, which is retarded, but we figured they MUST be good for that price so we ordered them, along with the Mexican corn. The corn was good, I have had better, but it was a reasonable price so that was a plus. The nachos came out and it was literally mostly dry chips with toppings only on the first layer of chips. Such a disappointment. Why are they charging so much for such a poor excuse for food? And to top it all off, our waiter was walking around in the dining room texting on his phone?!

Their chicken they use on any nacho platter was super spicy. After we were served the Fiesta Nachos one bite told me it was definitely too spicy for me to eat. An inquiry was made to head cook and we were told that all their chicken is that spicy. We couldn't get enough water after just 1 bite so had to order something else. Needless to say I won't be back. Also it was extremely loud in the restaurant and their acoustics are not made for screaming Golden Night fans. Our server was nice and apologetic but unfortunately it's also the food you must like.

4259445,2018-06-19,1,G6BwYw_0_atLPTzI1uokIA,"We've been longtime customers of this restaurant, so I'm surprised that I hadn't written my review yet. We went to the Henderson one the most, but it's no longer there. We went to the Downtown one a few times when we lived on that side of town. Come to think of it, since moving here last March, we've only been to this one a couple times. (Ok, better late, than never, right?)

We selected two choices of Nachos to split between us and our boy this past Father's Day for lunch. Nacho Average Burger- ground beef, bacon, queso, red onions, tomatoes & shredded lettuce and Enchilada Nachos- chicken breast, cheese blend, refried beans, jalapenos, sour cream, & lime salsa (we opted for both the red and green sauce, split sides). Both were really yummy. We finished the Nacho Average Burger (it's our favorite!), and had some leftover of the other one, which we took home minus the chips (we had an ice block and freezer tote in the car.) The Yelp check-in offer was a house margarita, and it was yummy too. It's  a nice check-in gift! 

My guilty pleasure food is Nachos and no place does it better than this place! Our bill was over $28, which was pretty good. (We got dessert once and our son had his own nachos, but this time, it was better this way; splitting two Nacho dishes.) Our son was not talking because he was too busy eating. From the size of the portions, the flavor of all of the ingredients, to the presentation, it is all good here. I think the motto here is ""no dry chips"" which is really the truth. (I'd want to try the other ones, but they might be a bit much for hubby, like the thai one or the spicy shrimp one.)    

There is a small seating area in the lobby area. The counter is near the front doors. There is a bar part and restaurant seating- a mix of tables and chairs and tables/ booths (two areas, plus an outside area too). There were tv's playing soccer coverage but switched over to music videos. They sell t-shirts for $25.00. The bathroom was clean.  

Service was on the slow side, but my review is on the food mainly (and for our past visits as well- keeping all of this, in mind). The server apologized for the wait, repeatedly. Our server was nice about it. I think that two parties left while we were sitting our table. There was a pretty good crowd  having lunch on Father's Day.

4265773,2015-04-10,2,G6BwYw_0_atLPTzI1uokIA,"We came here and ordered the steak and shrimp combo fajita plate. 
I want to give it a 3.5 star, because the flavor was above average, but the shrimp was tiny. It sorta reminded me of the frozen mini shrimp you buy int he bag, and just defrost. 

The grilled wings were actually good. They gave us the sauce on the side, so we could control how much we wanted. For grilled chicken wings, I think it was quite legit. 4.5 stars. 

I did love the layout and interior of the place, especially the draft beer section where you swipe a card and get a drink. I thought that would be fun with a group of people or even as a date. 

As for the nachos, I haven't tried it, and I'm not sure if I really like their method of using cheese that is melted in a pot (like velveeta) versus the real shredded cheese that's on top of nachos. So, I guess one day, I may try it, but because I'm particular about my nachos.

Service was a 5 star. I loved our server, and he was super fun to talk to. I think that was the highlight of our meal besides the good food.

4392667,2015-01-30,4,G6BwYw_0_atLPTzI1uokIA,"Where does one begin with a tale of such heartbreak and woe? 

Pros - seated quickly, pomegranate cherry Margarita, and churro sundae.  Cons - seated next to the shrieking eels of, ""of my god, we're like totally awesome"".  My ears are ringing and bleeding. I may die of this internal injury in my sleep and those screeching college drop outs will get away with killing me. 

Any who, the kids meals were so very lackluster.  The chicken tenders and fries both had an essence of aquarium rot. The mac n cheese was ok, the kids nachos came out both cold and soggy.   (Nice way to watch the goods, servers).  My chicken chimichanga was crunchy on the outside,  and a tongue scalding inferno of mostly beans on the inside.   Not much to write home about. 

Well, then there was the dessert.  Churro sundae...this part they got right. I think the sound waves from the incessant shouting out of the early twenties cat ladies actually made the ice cream melt a little. 

So,  after we practically swallowed the sundae whole, we waited for the check.   I couldn't shout over the stadium of three nor could I make visual contact with Ru Paul, I mean, our waiter.  After ten minutes,  and my son remarking on the steady slew of profanities from the fourth string cheer squad, the waiter magically appears,  check in hand, at their table. If I could have done it, I would've chucked my leftover bean log at him to get his attention. We literally sat for several more minutes and watched the trio jump in a fourth member by making him out-shriek and out-squeal them all,  combined. Two more minutes of feeling my ear drums expand to near bursting,  I got up from my table to leave, no check,  just leave.  Finally, the guy from Cats, off Broadway, of course, addressed me as I was going up the ramp,  with my kids.   I showed him my mean face and he said,  I have your check right here.  ""Well, thanks, glitter balls!  About effing time..."" is what I wanted to say,  but,  instead,  I thanked him for the delicious sundae, while he intermittently gave me his bitch face (and kept turning to look at his new girlfriends).  I will never be back. 

FYI -  the super loud femmes were already eating their giant freaking nacho piles when we arrived, so, I never imagined those potential DUIs were going to sit and drink and scream at each other for another 45 minutes.

Well I'm glad you asked, I have encounter a lot of hype about a restaurant and sometimes it does not live up to those heresy standards. But when we arrived at this location on Sahara OMG, it was clean, once you walk in some one address my party immediately then we were seated. We were asked to start off the drinks where we ask for their margaritas and Margarita was sweet OMG if you're not a drinker and you don't like the taste of liquor but you do enjoy the fun effects. I would definitely recommend one of their margaritas it was very nice very well put together not too much alcohol and not too much sugar and cocktail mix it was great. Then came the waiter who was very personable it wasn't like he was just there to do a job and you know put your food on the table. No, he offered his options he was very engaged which made us seem more relaxed and in a way at home at this location and particular restaurant we had some laughs we ordered our food the food was great appetizers were great.

4484567,2017-11-26,1,G6BwYw_0_atLPTzI1uokIA,"I went to a Yelp Elite Event at Nacho Daddy years ago, when they opened their first location in Henderson, which is now closed. More recently, a superb YEE at their Strip location made me want to try the branch on Sahara, closer to home.

I didn't check in on Yelp until I ordered a glass of wine, so I've saved my free Margarita with check-in until next time. There WILL be a next time.

Nacho Daddy's is famous for their nachos (duh), all kinds of nachos, but we weren't feeling them tonight.  Instead, I ordered a Fajita bowl, hold the tortilla shell. It was full of chicken, black beans, peppers, and onions, and I was gratified that there was a choice of rice or quinoa. I love quinoa! I was sure that the menu had said it was supposed to come with shredded lettuce. Our waitress said it didn't, but offered to check the menu.  She returned with a bowl of shredded lettuce, because yes, it was supposed to be there.  It also had a dollop of guacamole, which it was NOT supposed to be included. I sure didn't complain about it being there. I didn't even complain about the lettuce. Nevertheless, the manager, Flo, came over and said that because the kitchen messed up, she was taking it off the bill. Huh? I didn't ask for that, didn't make a scene about the missing lettuce, even told the waitress how grateful I was for the guac, and still, they comped the salad? Now that's customer service, capital CS.

My husband started with a bowl of tortilla soup, flavorful and slightly creamy. The Laws of Mexican Gastronomy says that it should come with avocado; it's an upcharge here. But he had enough sliced avocado in his Mexi-Cobb Salad, which was served a bit before he finished the soup, to add some.  It also had romaine tossed with an onion thyme vinaigrette, and topped with marinated chicken strips, pico de gallo, cheese, corn, cucumbers, and tortilla strips. He loved it.

Coming here a mere two days after our disastrous Thanksgiving meal at an upscale restaurant, I couldn't help comparing the experiences, apples and oranges though they may be. If Nacho Daddy is the apple, I'll take a bite of that any time. It was delightful, and we look forward to our next visit.",m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,4,3,4,6S5SlX2RKuoUeQXuBnVt0w

Elote is corn smothered in mayo, Mexican cheese, lemon and spiciness. It sounds like a weird combo but I love it! 

The servers are always awesome and they come by to make sure you are doing well. We came in with a mailer that the server had never seen instead of brushing us off he had the manager go ahead and fix the bill to honor the mailer. 

I also like the idea when we were seated music videos were on that I haven't seen in a while like MC Hammer Can't touch this. I personally prefer music videos over sports any day!

The star of the lunch.... Carne Asada Nachos..... duh.... it is called Nacho Daddy!!
They were perfect!!! Really one of the best nachos I have ever had!

We ordered the chips and salsa to start. The flavor was decent, but nothing outstanding or noteworthy. I wish the chips would have tasted a bit more fresh. For a main dish I went with the grilled fish street tacos. I enjoyed the diced mango on top as a somewhat unique flavor, but overall the tacos were just super bland and dry. Very disappointing for a $9.50 price point. The only good part about my meal was the free house margarita with my yelp check in.

I tell him I plan to tell everyone I know not to go here, but I think others have beaten me to it since it was pretty empty for a Friday night. The food is unremarkable, forgettable, and overpriced.

So I pushed it away and waited for the server to come back and when she did all she asked was if I wanted the plate taken away I said yes and was going to tell her about the steak and how awful the food was but she was gone too quickly and never even came back except to drop off the check. No one ever even asked how the food was or why when the server took a full plate of food there was no questions on why nothing was eaten from it.

My nachos were just okay. They were chicken nachos and it was a constant scavenger hunt trying to locate meat. They should've been called 'bean nachos with a chicken surprise'. My date ordered some beef nachos, and this is where the 2 stars come in, his were great! Very flavorful with just the right amount of spice.

We were seated quickly, which was great, but then no one asked us if we wanted drinks or a kid's menu for our little one. So we sat for awhile patiently and then a server came over and we asked to please bring those things over for us. We ordered our appetizer (queso dip - by recommendation from a friend who had been a patron at a different location). The server asked if we wanted salsa with it and I said that I did. When we received it, no salsa was with it and the queso was pretty lackluster. It was a very pale yellow color and it paled in taste as well. It was just sort of bland, like I've had better grocery store queso. From a place called Nacho Daddy, we expected more/better.

We ordered from the kid's menu for our son (macaroni and cheese) and asked for it to be brought out before our food (parents out there know why). They brought it out and my husband couldn't even cut through the noodle, it was so hard and so chewy. We had to send it back because it wasn't edible. The server came back and said the manager apologizes and that he agreed it was hard and they will make us a new one. They fixed it and brought it back and it was clearly much better, so I don't know what happened the first time.

Then the nachos that i ordered came (filet mignon nachos) and I was fully expecting a nacho place to get it right. Wrong. The nachos weren't at all layered, so once you pull off 1 or 2 chips that are loaded with the toppings, everything underneath is just chip. You'd think they'd know better!

I ended up not eating much more than 10 chips fully loaded before I was all done. We saw the s'mores dessert on the Yelp check-in that I did while I was there and we thought it looked amazing and wanted to give it a try. Let me just tell you...it was really good, but it's huge. I recommend 4 ppl sharing that bad boy. Seriously though, best part of the whole dinner right there. Only problem was it was so big and that sort of dish isn't edible later, so we had to leave a big portion untouched.

My husband got a sandwich and he said it was great. So maybe they should change their name or their business model. Nacho Jr. would be better due to the clear miseducation on nacho best practices!

When all was said and done, we left with a $75.00 bill (yikes!) and they STILL charged us $1 for a side of ranch even though they had a lot of missteps themselves (including not ever mentioning that a side of ranch was $1...first we learned was when we saw the bill).

While on vacation I stumbled across Nacho Daddy, and my overall experience was amazing! 

My boyfriend and I ordered the bottomless chips and salsa, it comes with 2 different salsa's, so we got mild and medium. Both were delicious and the chips were crisp and hot, not too salty, just right.

My boyfriend ordered the beer battered fish tacos, and before I could finish white peach drink (which was also very tasty) he was finished and seemed very satisfied with his food.

I dont remember the exact name of what I ordered, however it was the Nacho's with multiple cheeses and chicken. They gave us so much food, that I could barely finish my meal. 

Our Waitress, I dont remember her name as well (it was a good night , lol), but she had pink hair and she was lovely. Very attentive, friendly patient, and she made sure we got our food on time. She really made this whole dinner experience enjoyable.

4909898,2016-02-15,0,G6BwYw_0_atLPTzI1uokIA,"We came for a quiz night a few weeks ago, our first time at a Nacho Daddy. We had called ahead of time to check on the quiz starting time. They told us 7:30. We arrived at 7:15 and the quiz had already started, but we got over it and played catchup before reading the menu.

When the waiter came over, we gave him our drink order and said we needed more time to consider the menu. he brought us our drinks and then ignored us. We told the host wanted to order, and it still took the waiter another ten minutes before he came back (without even so much as an apology). He said he thought we didn't want anything, which made no sense because all we had ordered was water...

We shared a plate of shrimp nachos. They were totally gross and crazy expensive. $15 for a pile of soggy green tortilla chips (I just find using festively colored chips really odd) covered in a thick salty cream of all things. A few diced tomatoes and jalapeños had been sprinkled on the top, and of course some shrimp in there. It tasted like a pile of wet chemicals. I'm pretty sure nothing in there constituted as fresh foodstuffs. 

The waiter came back to ask about desert. My friend asked for a coffee. The waiter said, ""Well, the cappuccino machine is broken. And so is the coffee maker. And we require REALLY hot water to make coffee. You see, we need it to be really HOT."" 

It was really bizarre. And of course, no apology again, just another disappearing waiter. Eventually he brought the check (after taking a shot with a table near us). We put down a card, and again waited, and waited, until finally we gave up and threw down exact change in cash and took off. 

A seriously horrible experience. Quiz host was cool, but there were no multi-media type of rounds and the venue (even without the rude service and yuck food) isn't really suitable for a quiz.",yJLvkgnT2KJHBkgHPKoxWg,0,0,2,jyLuHnBgxHMKkAV0uQOw1g

I usually wait till I try a place a few times before going star crazy but as stated I have things I need to say.. The reason they get two stars instead of zero and a escalation  is  when I called to ask wait times and when we were seated both the female who answered and the gentleman who seated us both who sadly I didn't get their names were friendly and informed...
Food  quality and booze was good even if my experience was not .. so let's get on with this yelp rage review from another one of those hangry yelpers shall we? 


So driving down Sahara on our way to Indian Friday night we drove past nacho daddy and I recalled I tried them out originally at a yelp event and fell hard for their Mexican corn offthe cob so of course I decided before my movie date Saturday it was time for margaritas and some Mexican nachos .. Fast fwd to my evening nacho daddy experience ..


Shawn our waiter set the tone for my Saturday night meal to where this place is going to be tabled for quite sometime before I try Them again ..which is lame cause I totally planned to bring someone who isn't a square bear (my bf doesn't drink much) that will drink and  shoot Scorpion shots when I was photo ready cause admittedly I was in cozy clothes to prep for three hours at the movies after so I was not ""fancy "" to do cute tourist like selfie scorpion shots ....

My biggest pet peeve when dining is being left thirsty .. I need soda usually diet or water and refills often lol my server failed from the jump with that.. I had asked some questions about the premium margaritas .. He didn't really say much but the jalapeño is too spicy for him so  I got this cucumber chili one he recommended which wasn't on the menu but he told me about and my guy got a raspberry one both of which were tasty imo for the 11/12$ price tag but the service went all bad when Shawn left to get those without asking if I need water but also having to be prompted to get some .. Worst thing is he not only brought our margaritas before the water that was requested but we had to ask for the water again and I continually saw him walking around talking to other co workers .. Being friendly ..I'm sorry he can love his co workers but service should prevail especially when I need water ..

He didn't recommend stuff and I had to do the digging and just responded we don't have it anymore so it got old for me really fast ..
Now when date night occurs I typically go for app, two entrees and dessert plus booze  .. This situation already had  gone downhill fast ... It gous to one entree (maybe Shawn thought due to my attire I wasn't interested in spending money ) here is the thing usually I still eat my food and spend my money but I escalate the issue .. However being on a date and having my guy prefer to not make a scene I went another route which is not order stuff to lower my tab which helps make me feel less horrible for not tipping well but it leaves me to where I'm hangry and upset ..

If you do go here check in  on yelp and you'll get a free house margarita.. It was delicious  so I may go back to the bar sometime but..  
Be advised I only got that free margarita to make sure he knew I was checked in but also cause I thought maybe the manager or supervisor would have to authorize it and come by cause I don't usually do top shelf so if I give it a thumbs up
So it's  fair to say they have a good bartender 

Filet nachos won the entree choice due to recommendation of the dude who seated us that was nice... They are 18 something and huge so we shared those fine but it was lack meat and had way too many beans but the taste was good ... Those beans are where Shawn and I went to the point of no return cause I was going to try another premium margarita and let my guy get his dessert but ..My 
meal ended with my boyfriend and I waiting so long for Shawn to check back that the excessive beans on our nachos that had no meat were spread out on the dish and Shawn comes up and says ""are you done playing with your beans? Which 

A. I guess if we had aligned and related that would of been cute but we didn't 
B. You see it not eaten and don't ask what happened or how everything was.
C. You had enough time to watch , lurk but not check in..

My boyfriend really wanted to try the churro banana split  but he had to make due with Ben and Jerrys at redrock.. Why? Cause I couldn't handle Shawn or the sight of beans any longer..it also delayed my finding good movie seats so thanks Shawn you win!! But seriously 

Overall this was just not a good experience but the quality of food was not bad it was meh ..",vwLV4TkRMoghs86tB1Ke8Q,12,6,2,Gr_ygU4pUoozJIzE48uBmg

Nacho Daddy was a 30 second walk from our hotel. Checked out the menu online to see if there was anything for my vegetarian mother to eat. A vegan menu with actually tasty-sounding items? Sweet!

We were greeted and seated immediately by a hostess. Our awesome server Nick took care of us, including making sure my food had no tomatoes. This is really important for me, as I have a food sensitivity to raw tomatoes. I had the chicken fajitas, which were delicious and not greasy at all. Loved the addition of scallions. The rice was tasty; refried beans actually tasted of kidney beans for a change. Mom's vegetarian burrito with a veggie patty, black beans, rice and lots of vegetables was also amazing and proved too much for my mom to finish. As a vegetarian, she was impressed that thought had been given to making a great-tasting dish that wasn't an afterthought.

1.  I really like it when Mexican restaurants offer free chips and dip, sadly this place does not.
2.  The last time we were here, the food was medicore... Here's what I mean by that:  the rice and beans tasted and looked like it's been sitting out for some time.  You know, when it looks all dry and burnt on the edges... You see it at times at a buffet when the food has been sitting out all day.. That's what it looked like. 
3. This is what my bf calls this place: it's kinda harsh though... It's a wanna be Mexican restaurant.  He says the food doesn't taste authentic, and the price doesn't match the quality of food.
*I really want to see this place succeed because they do offer vegan options which I love... but maybe with a few of these changes, they will have more people in the door.",Fr1AHwaEhj1zryGBR49Z5Q,1,1,3,xtdZvV69H40BPe8hgNqjtQ

The cheese, sour cream was great. I wanted to try more but with the nachos and margaritas I was full. BUT I did manage to squeeze in their vegan chocolate cake with raspberries and it was oh so good!

The wings were very crispy and juicy. They were Sauceless but it comes with a side of ranch or blue cheese. I loved it because who doesn't like fried chicken??

If the world offered nothing but these chains, I would eat out occasionally. But in the world we live in, there are better options. Why settle? I would recommend Viva Mercados in the shopping center right next door or Apache Tacos right down the street over Nacho Daddy.

Edit: Business owner - now that you mention it, I remember last time being there, I don't like tomatoes so I asked if there are any tomatoes in the guac. The bartender told me ""yes"". I asked if they could make mine without tomatoes. I was told that the guac is all premade. I mentioned that guac could be as simple as mashing up some avocado, lime and salt, but they still weren't able to make me that guac. Instead I was offered to just have some cut up avocado, which I had to pay extra for.

I've been to the Downtown location and this one. And for some reason, this one is just not as good. 

I will point out, the bartender was awesome. She was so nice and so helpful. She was quick to fill our drinks and to bring us our food. 

We got there 1 hour and 15 minutes before closing. We ordered quickly and we didn't stay past closing. Before they closed, they started turning off lights. That to me is a sign to ""Hurry up and get the fuck out"". I get it and I work in customer service. But, I don't care if it's before closing time, you should never turn off the lights when you have clients in there. Even if they're in there past closing time. It's super rude and very unprofessional. Even the bartender apologized and said how rude it was. 

The food was just ""ok"". I don't know, maybe they were having an off night or they were just pissed because we came in an hour before closing. We ordered a few things and everything seemed slapped together and just not very flavorful. 

I would love to give this place the benefit of the doubt because the one downtown is awesome.

5133923,2017-12-08,0,G6BwYw_0_atLPTzI1uokIA,"This was my first visit to a Nacho Daddy and had heard great things, but unfortunately it wasn't a great experience. 

It wasn't busy when we arrived since it was early, so we got seated right away, which is always good. I started off ordering a blackberry margarita with a specific brand of tequila. The waiter brought out the non-alcoholic drinks and told me my margarita would be right out and he took our food order. There were three of us, so we got two types of nachos to share: the filet mignon nachos & the bbq pork nachos. 

The margarita came out shortly after that, and was much redder that I would expect a blackberry margarita to be. Turned out it was a raspberry margarita (there were raspberries in it, and it was extremely tart). The waiter was no where to be found, so I had to wait quite some time before I could tell him. 

Our food came out about 15-20 minutes later, and as the server put it down we saw that the bbq nachos didn't look like pork. They were actually chicken nachos. The server (not our waiter, probably a food runner) took the chicken nachos back to have them make pork. We started eating the filet mignon nachos, which were really good. As we were eating, a manager came over and asked if we wanted to eat the chicken nachos while we waited for the pork, and we said sure. The chicken nachos never made it back to our table. About the time we were finishing up the filet nachos, the bbq pork nachos came. 

At about this time we finally saw our waiter (had to flag him down) and I told him I got the wrong margarita. He said he would order the blackberry. I got it shortly after that, but by this time we were almost finished eating. I did drink about half of it before we left and it was delicious.

It would have been nice if the waiter had checked back to see if everything was okay earlier so I could have had my drink with my food. Also, when a manager offers to let you eat the mistake while you wait for what you ordered, it would be great if they actually brought the food to you. 

Food and drinks alone would get 4 stars, but throw in the horrible service and mistakes, I had to drop it down to a 2 star rating. I will likely not be going back.",Jtmnh7YtqTxD8ZkeyhSorA,0,0,2,o8eAcHG10r8_QGdTrluKKQ

It consisted of what tasted like canned refried beans wrapped in a tortilla.  Absolutely no cheese,  sauce or sour cream. Taco Bell makes a better bean burrito.  Crab and lobster enchilada was also bland and the seafood tasted frozen. The nachos were basic,  nothing to write home about.  I know my family's tastes may be more ""exotic"" but we went on a day when kids eat free and we still paid $70 for mediocre food. I don't mind paying $$ if the food is bomb. Our server noticed all the untouched food and asked if we needed boxes. We politely declined, seriously what was the point?

We came in and were promptly greeted by the friendly hostess, she got us seated pretty quickly and let us know Morgan would be our server. She took our drink orders, when she came back I checked in for the free Margarita which I ordered on the rocks. She brought out my Margarita, was a little heavy on the salt but over all tasty and definitely had more alcohol than expected in a discount drink. 

When we ordered, Morgan let us know portions are pretty big and even gave some tips on how to reheat at home. We got the street corn app, supreme nachos, and lobster/crab nachos. Overall everything was tasty and the topping to chip ratio was pretty good, although I felt I paid more for the mango salsa on my nachos vs the crab and lobster sprinkle. The entire meal cost about $50, felt over priced for the mango salsa nachos and everything else. Upbeat atmosphere and friendly staff, still unsure that's enough to bring me back for the food and it's prices.",TLLpIA8b69CvkXMulbz5mQ,0,0,3,-b1mYRBqIEyC_zbX4eLWvQ

We arrived at 5:10 to an almost empty restaurant on St. Patty's Day & the kind of Irish folk music that gets aggravating to your ear after about 10 minutes (& the sameness of it didn't quit).  A server named Brie quickly arrived & I said we wanted the happy hour menu.  ""Only Mon. thru Fri."" she said.""  ""But when I called 20 mins. ago a woman said it was 7 days & that in addition to nachos on that menu, there were tacos.""  She said that was not the case but they would honor both.  No cheap drinks on that happy hour menu, nor on the regular menu, espec. the margaritas.

Brie was peddling the corn on the cob at $6.50 & I ordered it, requesting it be cut off the cob.  Though the taste was quite good, it was swimming in so much butter that it spoiled the experience.  I also ordered chicken fajitas with corn tortillas ($15.50) & my partner chose his usual (at all Mex. restaurants), the chicken burrito ($10.50)  The orders came soon enough & he said his was good, though only accompanied by a big mound of tortilla chips.  My fajitas came with flour tortillas instead & though typical in taste, were swimming in oil & & the refried beans were too thick or too cold to spread.   I told Brie I asked for corn tortillas but they came near the end of my meal.  I also mentioned that the fajitas were way too salty & she said ""Oh no they're not.  I've had them lots of times.""  We both liked the two salsas & I ordered the $1 Corona (7 oz.).

We figured we'd save the evening by watching the March Madness game at the bar, but guess what?  The bar is too high to reach unless you're a tall person & I hadn't brought a pillow.  And since, in addition to all of the above, the customer isn't always right at this establishment, why chance it again?",kFFhw53ZEPoDo6okPU4eRg,0,0,3,ZmmrbzMwKUcrBEvKoN5nZw

We asked for new fries but the ones they brought were also cold. The chips and guacamole were decent but nothing the write home about. All in all, we won't eat here again. The prices were expensive compared to quality. If you want Mexican food, take the time to drive 2 miles down the street and eat at merchandito or even Lindo michican with similar prices but bold and delicious flavor.",9Aef3pHrL9o7qNe-bOHQag,1,0,2,ADPEQUUuCNkHWTjQHUPAiQ

The Bartender didn't even ask if she wanted another drink after she questioned the ingredients (the menu didn't say they include soda, but the bartender said they do) and said it was disgusting. I expected some really awesome nachos considering the name of the establishment, but they were probably the least appetizing nachos I've ever had. Definitely won't return to the restaurant.

The BF ordered the smothered burrito and he said it was okay, nothing great. He didn't even finish it which is not like him.

The house made maragritas are really good though. They offered a free one when you check in on Yelp. That was the best part of the meal.

I tried to make reservations for our larger party in advance twice, each time my phone number was taken and they said a manager would call me, which did not ever happen. I finally called again a few days before our planned outing and just made a regular reservation, no manager approval needed. I realized it's probably a lot more casual than I was picturing.

After we got there the servers and hostess were super nice and accommodating however the food itself was not great (I'd rather eat nachos from Robertos or KoMex) and I am not sure if it is because of where we were sitting or the fact there were other large parties there, but half my party ordered extras (like sour cream or guacamole) and it didn't come until the end of the meal, after they had eaten most or all of their food.

The name Nacho Daddy is cute and the thought behind the food and menu was better than the food itself.

5688107,2017-02-13,3,G6BwYw_0_atLPTzI1uokIA,"Atmosphere : when I first came in I wasn't even sure if kids were welcomed here.

Server : nice , attentive highlight of the night I left my card in the slot holder and was in my car writing my review and he brought it out to me. Great to see honest kids working ! 

Food: Eloté or Mexican street corn - it was over with something so much that there were no layers to the corn like you expect when you get street corn. Typically you have the hot sweet corn , the richness from the butter and mayo followed by a sharp bite of Cojita Cheese a little tongue tickle with the Chile and the to cut through it all a splash of lime.  With this corn I found it to be overly flavored with garlic I believe the layers just all bl NCED and melded together. Not what I expected for $6.50 for one whole corn.  Fresca and Frijoles the corn is half the price and much better.  

Two kids ordered burgers I asked for them to be cooked Medium and they both had these frozen overly cooked dried out hamburger patties.  They were very thick though.  The frozen fries were of horrid cheap quality. 

I had fish tacos one grilled one fried. The fish was half the size of the taco shell and the way they assemble the taco is disastrous and weird.  The tortilla is thick like a flauta kind of its good but the way they bed the taco with the cabbages and salsas is just weird. If you take the fish out it's about 60-70% the length of the tortilla.  It feels like a rip off and it is. 

Dessert: Deep Fried icecream now if you have had this ice cream you know that this is a great treat because of the hot exterior shell and cold cook center is a double treat in one well Not Here.  It's like they fried the ice cr an ball then put it back into the freezer to serve whenever people ask for them. The exterior shell is so weird and hard to chew.

We walked in and it wasn't  that busy at all and we had to wait 15 mins to be seated. We ordered our food but we were waiting and waiting for the appetizer (chips and salsa) to come and then our entrees came. Two mins after we were served our entree and appetizer finally came out. The waiter did take that off our bill for the inconvenience which we were grateful. For the price of the food I was very disappointed.

Funny to place a review you have to award one star so this is truly against my decision. Service is awful; when the waiter messes up they go on an on with an apology.  Everyone makes a mistake correct it and get on with it.  Food comes out very slowly; both times I was there the restaurant was empty.  There's no excuse for bad service.  I ordered the cheese nachos last time and this time; not a huge culinary feat and yet not consistent.  I did get my free margarita for checking into yelp and that was good.  I'm not going back and told the hostess such when she asked me how everything was on our way out.  A young girl who was more concerned about her car accident today than possibly allowing us to speak to a manager.  Enough said.,L8T-DBnY2MQZZ8jAWYsEuw,3,1,1,xTx2ehiQFvYrJq8-OiaMKA

At 7:04pm we get seated, it then takes our server several minutes to get to our table as he was talking then cleaning another table. We place our order, my husband asks for a beer but heaven forbid you get only one beer! They want to make him go to this beer wall and pay a larger amount than one beer hoping to get him to drink several. So he ordered water instead. Kind of stupid you can't just get one dang beer. Our appetizer was chips and salsa which had not arrived by 7:26pm. This was after watching three other tables get their orders of chips and salsa before us. Two of those tables were seated after us! So we got up and went to the hostess station and asked that our order be canceled. I gave them back the free $25 voucher they sent my husband for the last time we had shitty service. Told them they could keep it since the idea was for us to come back and have a better experience. Oh and to top it all off while we were canceling our meal and I was asking to pay for the kids drinks the manager on duty was too chicken to come out and see what was going on.

I was also praised by the vegetarian family member for bringing him somewhere with such an expansive menu for vegans/vegetarians.

Also because they took so long to bring our food we finished our drinks and by the time we actually got our refills we were done eating which sucked. I honestly don't recommend this location at all.

Once we placed our drink orders, the service was quick, but sub par. Our waiter walked by our table of empty drink glasses several times and we still had to ask for refills. The food was mediocre, but nowhere near ""world famous nachos"" as they proclaim. We were served a plate of toppings on a very tiny bed of soggy chips.

My problem with this restaurant was the service. Our waitress was nice, but in the beginning of the meal we showed her a 50% off nacho coupon, and she said we would be able to use it. Now, I'm not sure what happened in that half hour or so but the coupon was gone by the time we got the check. I'm pretty sure the waitress took the coupon when we showed it to her, but either way she wouldn't give it to us. I would have liked to speak with a manager but I was too distracted by the table behind us. They asked to move seats and their waiter seemed really annoyed with their request. I saw him roll his eyes when he turned away and he was swearing the whole time under his breath. Really vulgar things. I was honestly shocked. Obviously the table being served couldn't hear him but I could. 
Verdict: good food, but not so family-friendly language and rude servers. If you like to hear the waiter drop the f-bomb several times about the table behind you, this is a great place to eat.",hPv5xh4cETVINMduWfLFVQ,0,0,2,fqBagqzVr-i7P7lNWsDo0w

I don't really have anything negative to say. Perhaps they could have free chips and salsa? (I was always a fan of the bread/weird butter at Firefly)
