Three times in a row they leave out sides and desserts. I mean seriously, how hard is it to look at a list and put everything on the list in a bag????? I wanted all legs in my order and agreed to a 14 minute wait, no problem ... But that turned into 35 minutes!!!! Took me less time at the doctors office!",MlDOCaCMmQrfMy83XqF1Dw,0,0,1,qEX3-jY2oKX59kE6qWl33A

Drive thru has the menu placed in a way that you cannot be near speaker to order and see the menu.  I placed my order, correcting the speaker several times, and repeated every response. Got to the window and she asked what I had ordered.  There was no one inside and there had been one person in front of me. Not so busy they had to sort through orders.  Had to repeat entire order, nothing was complicated or substituted. Total gives, paid.  Card returned, drink passed.  Minutes later a girl opens the window, asked if I had my drink, hand d me a bag, shut the window and leaned against the counter talking with coworkers. I had to signal to ask if this was my complete order or if I was waiting.  She nodded and closed the window and went with her conversation.  I think it's awful customer service when you feel like you have interrupted the server and are a bother.  With no customers in line or in the store maybe they should attempt to satisfy any customer they might have.  The food was decent, not worthy of the price for sure.  Won't be back to see if the third time is the charm. :(",eeNPs1pTJXD5hOc6t0161Q,0,0,2,xc3ay5T2-NwD6aS2-OWDxA

2006201,2017-09-20,0,oTUpxF_E9D1n_LhN5N0NXg,"If I can give this place a negative star I would but I chose not to because SOME of the employees there are very friendly. I keep coming back to this Popeyes because it is near my work hoping that maybe the ""next time"" they will have what I want.  I have been to this location an estimated 25 times this year and they have been out of spicy chicken OR white meat at least 20 times.  What's worse is that I called to share my feedback to customer service AND even shared it on their website LAST YEAR and the STILL have the same problems.  I don't call to complain and be difficult, I call because it is on my favorite chicken to have and it makes me angry that they still fail to make an effort to have enough product on hand.  I only got ONE response after multiple complaints and they have me a couple for a 2 piece chicken meal that had already expired by the time I got it in the mail.  Long story short, if you are open to constantly changing your meals because they run out of your favorite, this is the place to go.  Otherwise, don't waste your entire lunch time going here.",ijveU-JM--aSFaFPTd87DQ,0,0,1,3xM4xa7aPzJbYFeajG0qrA
2307988,2017-09-04,0,oTUpxF_E9D1n_LhN5N0NXg,Always get my order wrong. Processed small strips are what they call the tenders.... Its been over 4 times my order has been wrong and have learned my lesson that this location isn't the one.

3388189,2013-03-29,0,oTUpxF_E9D1n_LhN5N0NXg,"Mediocre. The spicy chicken simply isn't. It's normal, nothing to write (Yelp) about. Soft drink size inadequate and typically over-priced. 

The pricing is not cheap but a little more than it should be. For only two, it was $24.61. 

But today, after I spoke to the person at the initial drive thru and ordered at 6:04 pm, I pulled up, paid, and then she says, ""It'll be 5 minutes."" Hmm, okay, no stock on hand during the dinner hour. Definitely not fast. Could you have informed me as I first ordered?",k_eKYlkhI11VGzb5RxHmOA,2,0,2,B3zY-umWrCwT580oGRTZEw
3490659,2018-04-12,0,oTUpxF_E9D1n_LhN5N0NXg,"If I could give zero stars I would. First, the cashier guy was so rude and impatient. I've never experienced customer service this bad. In addition, we came home with the order ALL wrong. EVERYTHING was mixed up.  I was given blackened chicken when I asked for mild. I cannot stand the blackened chicken so dinner for me was pretty much ruined. Not to mention the wrong sauce was given. Also, the cashier was the one serving the food!!! He went STRAIGHT from the cash register, handling dirty cash, to getting the food from behind, NO HAND WASHING, NO GLOVES.  Gross!  I'm pretty sure that's a HUGE health violation. Also, no butter and no honey was included with the biscuits. Don't go to this one. Don't let them ruin your meal too. It's not worth the aggravation and absolutely 100% not worth the money.  Wish I could've gotten the cashier's name, but he wasn't wearing a name tag. Go figure.",DQILueeIR6fxmXe49wy7rw,0,0,1,vwKh7dRRyjlPqUnhGqo5KA
3768137,2016-05-30,0,oTUpxF_E9D1n_LhN5N0NXg,The worst customer service from the managers and the empoyees. They never get the orders right. Something as simple as a #4 . It's sad when they can't put chicken in a box. I'm sure they cost this company a lot of money. Where is undercover Boss when you need them.,fWwAz1s7xUoCjQijoHIGgg,2,0,1,Bvq6nwrm64r_kWAKtwINjw

4163855,2013-06-13,1,oTUpxF_E9D1n_LhN5N0NXg,"First off this place definitely is not $$$ as it states it is. But then again I only dine here on a Tuesday as that's when they have the Popeye's Special: $1 for a leg and breast. Can't beat that so I usually order $5 worth. Who can beat 10 pieces of chicken for $5!!!! Greasy-you bet it is; why would anyone expect anything different. 

I used to frequent this place about 7 years ago, the one by Sahara and Jones I believe, but back then I think it was to soak up all the liquor consumed or cure the next day's hangover. Nevertheless, I still will frequent Pope-Yes as I like to call this joint. I feel it's better than KFC.",FBlKK57447Wt-EUR1TfENw,1,0,3,FIOimVccHjBEsHS096LNUg

5071654,2013-02-20,0,oTUpxF_E9D1n_LhN5N0NXg,"Wow I was disappointed here for some reason.  I love popeyes chicken and decided to order the chicken wrap that has rice and beans inside, a side of cole slaw and of course the sweet tea.  The sweet tea was definitely not as sweet and yummy as it used to be and the chicken wrap was very very small (comparable to the mini breakfast burrito you'd get a McDonalds). The wrap was hot but it was just eh on taste.  The cole slaw I didn't like at all.  I felt that for almost $5 I didn't get my money's worth including the quality.  I will give them credit for how clean the place was and she was very nice behind the counter.  

However if this was my first visit, I would not return. I am not discouraged though, I will try them again. I will just order something different.",9GyTNxzAN8UxpPPSTfei-A,1,0,2,WtcHIDqLCh5H-gqYBp9k0Q

I got a 3 piece white meat meal with cole slaw, mashed potatoes, and sweet tea. 
I decided to try the spicy white meat chicken!  Apparently that means one breast and two wings :?I think next time I'll ask for dark meat...seems like you'd get more chicken that way.  Pretty darn tasty and fresh!",VigsAph76fP7pechJ743EA,1,0,4,3R5lr71moS6PWg8XwzDrQw
