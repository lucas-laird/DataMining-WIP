We stopped in for lunch on a Saturday and they had a few guest before us so it took about 10 minutes to get through the line to pay for our food, it took another 10-15 minutes for them to bring the food to our table. The food itself was hot but the beef on my was very chewy and tasted a little odd so I took it out and didn't eat it. 

Overall a good option for stirfry and I will return and try new sauces and proteins along with the wings that looked really good.",c5tvQ7RYTYd8BQ1VMqVqNw,1,1,4,-EkWcnCMNUwcQDRtX_2u7Q

The employees remember your name and make you feel special on each visit. I go to this place a few times a week and have not grown tired of eating here.

Now about the menu: they offer a variety of options..even for vegetarians like me. The fried tofu is amazing and although I haven't tried any of their meat selections, I'm pretty certain it is seasoned and grilled to perfection. The proportions are very filling and I always leave satisfied. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a good stir fry...and it definitely helps that the prices are reasonable..10/10",2cbXQRzyf5bkdsSCZfINXQ,1,0,5,gHJitcrLybIBWXMD-TMCcw

1588774,2018-02-05,0,GscGQdN5p48OfiNXr4QKsw,"When I moved here a couple of weeks I immediately started looking for a Mongolian place to replace my favorite restaurant in Cali. I didn't find really any option but when I checked today I learned that this spot just opened up so I had to give it a try!

The restaurant is very nice, modern, urban with really cool graffiti art! So dope and creates a very chill and welcoming vibe. On the menu the dessert section is called Happy Endings 

It's different from other Mongolian places I'm used to where you make you're own bowl, I'm known to pile things really high. Lol I actually like this better where they make it for you and you build your own stir fry or soup. It's cleaner and feels WAYYYY more sanitary. 

I tried the stir-fry with the Spicy Korean sauce. I didn't expect the sauce to really impact the stir-fry because I'm used to watered down sauces but this had a lot of flavor and a huge spicy kick.  So yummy! Portion is big and just the right size.

Owners are friendly and are genuinely interested in your experience.

Overall it's hip, healthy and really flavorful!",ceZv7ccYLHX2Uhm0PkfNIg,2,1,5,bE7LlP0lm2_C7kdWfSPT_A

I drive past the restaurant every day on my way to work, so I've been eagerly awaiting the reopening, as there aren't many great stir fry places here in town. I went with a friend and we each ordered a stir fry and we shared the sriracha fries and the dumplings. All of it was amaaaazing. The apps didn't last more than a minute, and we inhaled our noodles. 

In addition to the great food, the staff there is super nice. They explained the ordering process and helped us decide which noodles and sauces to use in our stir fry. They even let us taste all of the sauces to decide which one we wanted.

2280186,2018-06-12,0,GscGQdN5p48OfiNXr4QKsw,We were immediately greeted by the owner upon walking in the door. After his very nice greeting he explained the menu and how to order the ingredients. The concept is extremely cool you start with what type of noodles you enjoy. After the noodles they have an extensive array of veggies and fruits to add the the stir fry or soup. The soup is a Vietnamese Pho flavor. If you choose the stir fry they have amazing sauces ranging from sweet to spicy and combinations in between. At the end you choose which protein you want to add in. I had one of the best shrimp stir fries I have ever had in my life. The staff is extremely helpful and very genuinely nice always checking to make sure they made you an excellent stir fry. I also highly recommend the fresh homemade ginger ale and garlic edamame (the best I've had in town) our new favorite restaurant!! can't wait to come back and try more amazing combinations!!!,87zmdtmbZ9maVdJxP3DdYw,0,0,5,ikfM5qSEwOZq_wD2jeVLRg
2330327,2018-06-27,0,GscGQdN5p48OfiNXr4QKsw,"Hey there, so I'm dropping 5 stars on this new food spot you must try out. It's right off the 215 on rainbow, super easy to get to and very visible, tall flags by the street. 
   First off, great customer service. Young energetic faces lit up the restaurant which is decorated with some great art work. 2 thumbs up to the artist, great work! Even the manager came out to check on the quality of my experience, handsome young fella with glasses. Thanks Mr. Manager, keep your staff running the way it is, postive 
   So from pictures I've seen, I first thought the portions were small. I noticed everyone didn't take advantage of the toppings list. I myself love veggies, so I pretty much put everything except pineapples in my stirfry. If your super picky with food and only eat a couple veggies, your missing out and can't expect a huge portion when, ""you don't eat your veggies?"" tsk* tsk*. 
   I noticed my plate was going to be big, so I held off from getting their homemade ginger ale, soda makes me full. && I was out in the sun carrying my backpack in the heat, so I went with powerade. Next time though, I'm getting one of their specialty drinks, they all sounded amazing. 
   When receiving my dish, it was a great serving size, I had the stirfry, with pretty much all the toppings like I said. Side of french fries with swag sauce and I asked for a side of the garlic chili oil. I didn't wait long at all before getting everything delivered to my table. I went to town on my food, I couldn't stop eating till I felt like I was going to pop. I finished maybe 2/3 of everything and packed the rest. The food tasted fresh, being cooked to order I didn't expect fresh to be a problem. Flavors were there, I had the signature sauce, it was a little more on the sweeter side. I'm not really a stirfry guy or sweet sauce person, but this place nailed it. Looking forward to trying their other options, sauces & drinks.",G-lXqfGcJDRmi2iUXuj8Bw,2,1,5,ILUcmlZFCEmByAb8K3BhSA
2427305,2018-06-11,0,GscGQdN5p48OfiNXr4QKsw,"Reviewing this place before I even walk out of the restaurant after eating THATS how good it was. If I could rate more than 5 stars, I would. First time eating here and everything was amazing! It's basically a build your own stirfry noodle place. You pick a noodle style, veggies, protein and sauces then they stirfry it all together for you.  There's also an option of putting it all in a broth so it's like a ramen noodle soup. You can make it a meal for an extra $3, which includes their republic fries & special dipping sauce (bomb!) or the edamame which you can get plain or spicy garlic (the spicy garlic is killer) and a fountain drink. Everything tasted amazing. The ambience was super hip and trendy. This building sat vacant for a long time so I'm happy someone has taken it over and turned it into something wonderful. The customer service was outstanding. Spent some time speaking with Ann, Jackie (Jax) and a few others who informed me it's a family owned business which is always a major plus in my book. They were all so friendly. They offered a sample of their homemade ginger ale which was very refreshing; if you like ginger give it a try! I really can't say enough good things about this place.

The food is amazing. The staff is amazing. I love this place. I think I found a new regular food spot.

It's basically the stir-fry version of Chipotle. You get to pick a number and start ordering. They offer five different noodle options including zoodles (super great for a healthier/vegetarian option). You travel through the process of picking veggies, protein, and sauce. I would list everything I opted-in for...but I pretty much jam packed my dish with every keto-friendly option I could get.

The cooking process was very quick and efficient. Everyone I had the chance to interact with was extremely pleasant and welcoming. That's not something you see every day and I definitely appreciate it. The staff even checked on us multiple times while we were eating (it's more of a grab and go place so that stood out a lot). 

There are great options aside from stir fry like garlic edamame, pot stickers, even sriracha fries! YUM.

Super cool wall art with graffitied words to show where the restrooms are as well as trash area. Quite an interesting concept that you can build your own stirfry! Choose between soup or stirfry with a decent variety of noodles available. Add-ons aren't anything special as it would be what you would expect in a typical stirfry, except you can choose what you want or don't want specifically. Order what you want at ease! Except while ordering I noticed the guy seemed to passive aggressively limit my options as he kept trying to move to the next set of add ons, no biggie though but he also put in green onions into the bowl when I haven't asked for it (yet) but still, he added an ingredient that wasn't requested for. Also ordered a chow mein kids meal for my brother which comes with two sides of veggies--with that being broccoli and carrots. While ordering from the beginning we learned that they were out of carrots. So naturally, I assumed another veggie choice would've been opted for to compensate for the missing side but it was not. Finished product-wise, I thoroughly enjoyed the honey sriracha sauce. There were unsupervised kids kicking a ball around the lobby, whom I'm assuming are the kids of the employees. They weren't being overly obnoxious but I do feel perhaps they should have a closer eye on them as they were touching utensils (placing forks fallen on the table back into the dispenser) and things in the self serve area.",ooTnyvza14szGKWm3zKbAA,0,0,4,CW-GcZ5MK-jYE3k9bj3YHQ

Ok, so it's pretty good!  Couple little things will push this review higher. If you're the owner and you see this, I promise, you can earn those extra stars easily. THEY DID!!  The food was tasty. The service was great. The decor is modern and cool. Here's what you need to get those stars up. 

1.  Add fresh garlic, shallots, ginger and herbs. Adds a lot of flavor to an Asian stir fry.  THEY DID THIS!!!  I ADDED CILANTRO AND GARLIC!!!  HUGE FLAVOR IMPROVEMENT!!!

2.  Don't run out of stuff on your second day....or ever. EVERYTHING WAS AVAILABLE!!

3. The grill needs to be hotter to sear the noodles and veggies. The medium heat only makes it all kinda mushy. Cook the protein on the side and add the sauce at the end.  Yummy crunchy stir fry. No mushy noodles. HUGE IMPROVEMENTS!!  DELICIOUS CRUNCH!!  

Besides that, it's a great concept. We will be back to see if it improves!  IT DID!  RECOMMEND HIGHLY!!!",fIM5z8nnpLWWBdGPQ4FNfA,3,1,5,gDYdalJCPwPg6Ugzs3C82Q

So pleasantly surprised to find a lunch spot doing it RIGHT!!! 

From the moment we walked in the door, we felt welcomed and taken care of. We ordered 2 stir fry, easy process through the line and being that it was our first time here, we were thankful for helpful servers. I wound up making a good call on my sauce choice thanks to the guy working behind the counter. 

Our food was beautifully served to our table, very flavorful and perfectly portioned. The best part was that the staff (owners?) each individually came by our table and all other tables as well, to check up on how we liked the food. They were very personable and genuine people. We loved the food! We loved the service! That personal touch will keep us coming back here!
