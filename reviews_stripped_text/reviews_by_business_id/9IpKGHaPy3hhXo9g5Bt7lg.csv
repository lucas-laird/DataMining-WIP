i waited over a hour for my pizza when they driver came i asked to use my card he said i had to do it when i placed the order so i apologized an asked if it could be done an to call he refused so at this point i looked around the house for extra money an couldnt find anything but a extra 100$ emergency bill i keep in my wallet so i asked if he could give me change he said no again an started walking off i could not understand why he would treat a customer like that. so he left with my pizza an drinks completely unacceptable.  

i called metro pizza back an talked to cynthia on the phone (manager) she said sorry we can take your card info however the driver had already left for atleast 15 min an i asked him at first to call an he wouldnt these people have no class an could care less about their customers i was very loyal an spent atleast 800-1000$ with them just on pizza,salads an drinks they dont deserve to be making all this money an not care about their customers at all i have a son thats hungry an my wife as im making them waiting to find somewhere else to eat cause im writing this review this has to stop an it stops buy us the customers giving them so much MONEY.",bshQIPOaw5Adg1cia8DJEA,1,0,1,7i2uf3R6uyZAaG54fTVKXA
29029,2010-05-14,2,9IpKGHaPy3hhXo9g5Bt7lg,"With half an hour to kill and a hankerin' for some greasy pizza, I walked into Metro Pizza one afternoon to grab a bite.

After having a hostess ask ""For you?"" when I told her I was looking to get some lunch, I was seated at a table with a checkered tablecloth reminiscent of every other pizza joint I've ever been to.

What wasn't familiar, though, was the bizarre decorative choices made in this restaurant, seemingly in the late 80's (which was likely also the last time they cleaned the walls). Imagine cotton-candy blue and pink pastels, and then imagine that they somehow devised a way to make these colors less vibrant. Throw in some neon tubes and a horribly-misplaced wooden wine rack for good measure, and you've got Metro Pizza.

Confusing decor aside, I expected a good meal based on my experiences at the Tropicana location. An individual cheese pizza took them a satisfactory amount of time to cook and serve to me, and the staff's disposition was sufficiently cheery (though the bowtie on one of the waiters was a bit creepy). Grease dripping from the folded slice in my hand, I said a quick prayer and took a bite.

When I said up top that I wanted some greasy pizza, perhaps I should have been a bit more careful what I wished for. The river that slopped out of this slice of pizza would be enough to clog the arteries of an elephant. Despite the liberal application of pizza grease to this concoction, it didn't taste bad. I likened it to a less-disgusting version of Pistol Pete's (or Chuck-E-Cheese's) pizza, which I always thought was half-decent.

If you didn't stop reading my review after that last statement, thanks.

I finished my pizza (which must mean it's not that bad, right?) and settled my check, then headed out the door. I left disappointed -- and wanting a shower -- not necessarily because of the food itself (which would merit three stars on its own) but more by the general nastiness and creepiness of the establishment that I had just given twelve dollars.

The first thing Metro Pizza needs to do is take everything out of the place and paint the whole thing one color (and not in pastels, please). The cotton-candy walls and columns made my teeth hurt. Also, lose the neon. Nobody likes neon anymore, especially when it matches the pastel walls.

Let a bit more light into the place, mop the floors and wipe down the walls every now and then, and they'll have a nicer restaurant on their hands. I can't make a better pizza so I can't tell them how to change theirs, but less gut-busting grease would be nice.

If you're going to go to Metro Pizza, go to the one on Tropicana and Maryland. Let this one either realize the mistakes its making, or let it die the death it should have had years ago.",UYACF30806j2mfbB5vdmJA,3,0,2,OvejNuDmFGyBs2Rp2Bp4Pw

249704,2010-10-20,0,9IpKGHaPy3hhXo9g5Bt7lg,"This is our favorite Metro to go to.  There are prettier new locations, but the decor of this location keeps us coming back.  We affectionately call it the ""ghetto"" Metro.  A run down looking throw back to the 80's. 

But the pizza is the best and we've never had any real problems with the staff.  We usually go during 1/2 price time and the quantity of toppings and overall quality are never skimped on.  Same as their full price pizzas.  The are a bit pricey, hence going during 1/2 price, but even when paying full price it is worth the money with the quality ingrediants.

261632,2012-05-22,2,9IpKGHaPy3hhXo9g5Bt7lg,"Hey, Slater!  You wanna meet up at The Max after school?  We should totally study for the bio test before we wind up in detention with Belding.

......oops sorry.  Just getting lost in my ""Saved by the Bell"" daydreams.  It always seems to happen when I go to Metro Pizza.

So if you're still confused, the inside of this place SCREAMS the diner that Zack and the gang would hang out at after school (you know, ""The Max"").  It certainly makes for an interesting dining experience.  1993 decor aside, let's get to the important information: the food.

I have had the garlic fries (yummy), the eggplant parm sub (not so yummy), and plain ol' cheese pizza (good).  One of the lunch specials is $10 and comes with a plain or pepperoni pizza (a little smaller than a medium at most other places) and a big salad.  I always have leftover pizza for dinner, so that's nice.

The bread and salad really aren't anything special when you think about it, but I love both.  The bread tastes like what some little grandma would make on a Sunday afternoon, while the salad is always a large serving of fresh veggies.  I highly recommend their house-made Italian dressing- I don't know what they do to it to make it taste so good, but I would like the recipe, please.

Most days, we get a large pizza that is half Thompson and half Mulberry.  The Thompson is spinach, garlic, and ricotta while the Mulberry is fried eggplant, ricotta, and fresh basil.  The pizza is a thinner crust but still doughy (not crispy) and it is huge.  Two slices and I'm done.

Our pizzas have always been cooked perfectly and there's always a good balance of cheese, sauce, and toppings.  Usually the toppings are tasty, however on our last visit- not so much.  The water wasn't squeezed out enough from the spinach (obviously frozen) and the eggplant was fried to a crisp. 

The servers are friendly and usually our water glasses are kept full.  But for some reason everything is always SLOW.  I'm talking you may spend 2 hours here if it's a busy night.  The pizza is good, but prepared to spend some time in the restaurant.

I believe Metro is a Vegas institution that everyone should visit at least once.  I suggest this location in particular, so you can re-live all your bad memories of terrible neon outfits from the early 90's.",ELfzWgdf64VBLi5z1ECItw,4,2,4,MXWXHzQE-XOsxbBsYoXKyw

We ordered 2 pizzas and a pitcher of beer. While we were waiting for the pizza's to get done we where at the bar. One of he pizza's was not made how it was ordered And it had to be remade. 
There was no bartender on duty. And A employee refilled our pitcher that was grate we had appreciated it. We were halfway through the Second pitcher we  a another employee walked up to the bar and accused us of pouring our 2nd pitcher. 
Choosing us of stealing it was very disrespectful. We still had a half a pitcher we weren't going anywhere we were watching the football game. We went to the manager to complain about this issue. 
He tried to make it better saying that he would take care of the second pitcher. At this point The issue was closed. We then returned to the bar. shortly after the manager reapproached saying he called the cops on us. And created a new conflict.
The manager was clearly upset that his staff messed up the first order and was disrespectful. 
Instead of excepting the truth. The manager then then shut off the game verbally attacked us And had a formed as they had called the police. 

Quite shocking for a manager to respond this way and make a bad situation 100 times worse. He used all kinds of profanity. While he was talking to us. Even though we did nothing wrong I told my friends that we need to go. No more reason for more conflict. 
There was no reason to get the cops involved. So we left peacefully with no other conflicts.

When I got the bill I was bummed that I totally forgot the happy hour times but it's totally fine since I like supporting family businesses. When I brought the check to the counter to pay, I mentioned to the cashier that I totally forgot about happy hour. 

I would have been thrilled if they honored it, or it would have still been just fine if they just said sorry. Instead, the lady told me, ""Yeah... I guess you'll just have to skip pizza for a bit."" I paid and left a lot angrier than I expected. How about I skip Metro Pizza altogether? Seriously, I wouldn't waste my time to write this review if I wasn't this angry, 3 days after the fact just remembering her response.

Even though it's not deep_dish (somehow reviews say it's that, but it's not ), this was good.  The key was the dough.  When we got the little garlic rolls, and they had that good 'doughy smell, I couldn't wait for the pizza.  Very soft, chewy, and tasty.  

We got the salad and a large stuffed pizza.  Somehow I'm not good at size estimation, because this pizza was probably for 6 people, not three.  We had like half the pizza left!  

Will definitely go again, just to try a different (and smaller) pizza.  Good Value, good pizza, great for what it is.... Yeah I think I'll give it 5.",IZ2lrqD_Yt7_8QW2T0n4KA,1,1,5,ThTbRJ1RK_XHk_fVA_25xw

metro is kind of cheesy 80s colors with some florescent lights. the glowing sign will guide you to a pasta pie happy ending. the big booths in the back are great for larger parties; especially once those tummies are filled on said pasta pie! although the pizza is a tad pricey; it's quite difficult to finish more than a slice and a half. i recommend getting a pasta pie on your first night in vegas, then you'll have late night meals for the next couple of days!

Came here for their Three Square event which all the proceeds of their 1 dollar slice of pizza special went to this great charity. This is a great cause and this review has nothing to do with that charity. Coming in here, the place had sort of a retro look to it, sort of a 'Saved by the Bell' type of vibe. Super casual place.

On to the pizza. I thought it was ok, the pizza dough was good. I also thought that the sauce on the pizza was good as well. I wasn't a big fan of the cheese that they used. It seemed to separate a lot, and there was a pile of grease that had accumulated on top of the pizza. Now I have been to other Metro locations over the years. This was probably the first time I had seen this on their pizza. But other than that, it was fine.

I will continue to patronize Metro. They could have had just an off day or something. But generally, the pizza is excellent, probably some of the best I've had ever.",gtwM4ijo65AN4DvXdgCu_w,18,15,3,DGrxCT_ayYqS063kV4z9GA
1448067,2015-11-16,6,9IpKGHaPy3hhXo9g5Bt7lg,"Previous visits I had sliders and salads, but lately I've been eating from the pizza portion of the menu exclusively. The rumors and ratings are right: this place has fantastic pizza. Multiple crusts to choose from, several specialty options, but almost everything I've tried has been great.

The Modesto is my favorite: roasted mushrooms, garlic, and roma tomatoes, with fresh basil. And you can add sausage for FREE. Who has ever heard of that?! So props for having legit vegetarian options, and for kicking them up another level with the carnivore customization option. The small is perfect for two, add on some wings or a salad and you won't do too much damage to your diet.

The stuffed pizzas are also a hit- I'm not a fan of carbs on carbs on carbs, but BF would consider selling one of his kidneys for a large Loop (sausage, pepperoni, roasted mushrooms). The marinara dipping sauce is robust and comforting, but the crust is a bit too thick for my personal liking. I will say that the large, 8 slices for $30, is a great deal if you have a large group: similar, smaller, thinner slices in town go for $5/each elsewhere, and this averages out to under $4/slice with much better quality and a larger portion.

And service. It's always great. Phoning in my order is easy, it's always ready on time at pickup, and staff are friendly when I pop in. Bonus points for having the two takeout-pickup spaces in the parking lot!",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,9,11,4,Wzc7P_EjmmqMhxFwj7eGIg

I first found out about this place from my neighbor, Casey, who I owed a favor.   I asked if he wanted anything from The Vegas, and he said a loaf of bread from Metro Pizza.   It was the beginning of the end.

The crust is thick-ish, which is usually not my style, but the taste of the crust is absolutely magical.  It is the same as the bread, which is also amazing.   They give you some of this bread, toasted to perfection, while you wait for your food to come.

I haven't had a bad pizza here.  They have the option of pre-fab specialty pizzas like the New Orleans (shrimp, garlic, roma tomatoes) or the Napa Valley (white pizza with zucchini and proscuitto), or stuffed pizzas, or you can build your own (my poison of choice being pepperoni, mushrooms, and olives, extra sauce).

In addition to being a ranch lover, I am also a sauce whore.  I ask for extra sauce and they always give it to me, and it is delicious!!  I have never had anything but excellent service here, including nice chat from servers, and even once, when I was in a HUGE hurry, having them pack up three loaves of bread for me (after a short and efficient phone call) so that I was able to run in, throw my money on the counter, grab, the bag, and go. 

A word of warning (and the ONLY reason this place doesn't get 5 stars), for some reason, this pizza is at its best in the restaurant.  It doesn't hold up as well as take out, and it doesn't reheat very well.  I don't know what it is about it....but it makes me sad because it is SO GOOD as dine in pizza, and I love to stretch my meals.  I'm not saying I won't take it home, reheat it, and eat it...but it really just isn't as good.

Walking into this place it feels like you've stepped back into Miami Vice (its an old TV show from the 80's for the youngsters). It's fun and I appreciate that more so than places without any decorations. I'd also like to point out that service was awesome. Both the greeter and our waiter were very nice. 

The pizza made me want to cry. For starters I appreciate that you can create whatever you want and we made one half of our pizza pepperoni, mushrooms and ricotta and the other half was ham, sausage and pineapples. When we went to pick up our slices, they both drooped (a lot, like half the slice). It was like eating wet and uncooked dough. Not only did that happen but the flavors weren't great either. Everything was bland. With each bite I regretted the carbs. Finished my slice and just felt sad.

My server was great. I didn't get her name but she was super attentive and quick. 

They do some really awesome specials throughout the month and giving you a promo calendar when you sit down. 

Ever Tuesday they do buy one get one on different items. I believe the next one up is buy one beer get one free on the 29th.

A table next to me got a pasta dish and wings. They both looked amazing and I will have to try next time I'm in.",O9Dbdo2LZut3e8VqIY9gtg,1,1,5,qoVuBo6QI4O4RlBFxgHhgQ

He recommended to order a Large Pizza knowing we'll have leftovers. So we got the ""The Stockyard"" aka Meat Lovers..Came with Pepperoni, Sausage and Ground Beef. That thing was Stuffed with chunks of sausage and beef! Medium sized crust not super thin nor extra thick. Overall, didn't look that oily (considering all the toppings) and was Very Tasty and Very Filling.  No Comparison with the Big Chain Pizzas Meat Lovers!

I""ve gone to 2 other locations since (boulder and tropicana). And this is what I had:

Garlic Romano Fries: wide fries with major crumbles of garlic and parmesan cheese. These were Awesome!

Cheese Pizza Slice: Decent size (not quite as big as Costco's slices), Thin NY Style, Sauce and Dough both on the sweet side and Cheese was quality you could taste and held together (stringy type).

The Gotham: pepperoni, mushroom, suasuge, green peppers, ground beef and onions. Love the toppings, exactly what I would add on my pie (if it wasn't plain cheese or pepperoni)! Everything Quality and Amount of Toppings So Generous.. 

Service was fine (decatur & boulder) and Prices Fair.. Boulder location is quite small, like a shop you'd find in a foodcourt of a mall, with some tables scattered in front  of it). The Decatur location is more of a dine in restaurant outfitted with a Radical Vintage/Retro theme.

It is good, but it's not like the best pizza I have ever had. I decided to try the lunch special #1 today, which is a personal cheese pizza, side salad and a soft drink for $9.50. The side salad was fine, it had a few slices of tomato, thinly sliced onion, and a few croutons over a bed of lettuce. I always get their house made Italian dressing on the side because that stuff is bomb. I also got a side of ranch because I like the combination of ranch and Italian on my salad, and then I use the extra ranch to dip my pizza into. The personal pizza was BIG, and much larger than what I imagined so that was a pleasant surprise. The flavor of the pizza is just meh to me. Granted I only got cheese this time, but I have tried a lot of their other pizza's before and nothing blows me away.

The service today was spotty. They only had 1 server and 1 cashier/hostess/phone person during the lunch rush, and it is very apparent that they need more help. The cashier/hostess/phone person is busy because she is trying to do 3 different jobs at one time. There are constantly people coming in to be seated, people who are leaving that need to pay, and people who are calling to place orders over the phone. It took about 5 minutes for me to be acknowledged by the hostess and taken to a table when I first arrived because she was busy doing other things. I sat down and was given a menu and some silverware. A gentleman came by and took my drink order and then I browsed the menu. In between that time, the hostess brought me out some fresh bread and butter. After a few minutes I knew what I wanted and just sat there awkwardly waiting for my server to appear. Finally after about 15 minutes, she came to my table. You could tell she was busy. I ordered and off she went. I saw her bounce from table to table all over the dining room. My food came out about 15 minutes later and it was fresh and hot. I had to hurry up and eat because my lunch hour was almost over. This meant I had to flag down my server to bring me my check which took her 5 minutes because she was busy bringing boxes and checks to other tables. Despite today's visit, I have decided I will be back to try their meatball sliders that are voted Best of Las Vegas. Hopefully the service will improve but I will post an update regardless. 

Manager/Owner if you are reading this, you need more servers on at one time. I don't know if you were short handed today, 1/15/15,  but to me it is ridiculous to make 2 people run around like chickens with their heads cut off trying to please everyone. With more help, things will go smoother and I promise your customers will thank you for it, and your servers will get compensated better.

2185663,2013-05-02,2,9IpKGHaPy3hhXo9g5Bt7lg,"After reading reviews of here I was excited to try Metro, well I have to say the pizza was a bit of a disappointment. I got the Gotham, because you need to taste toppings rather than just a cheese pizza. What I got was under cooked and very oily. Yes I know the meats will add oil, but to leave puddles of it on the plate, that is a no go. It actually got better after I cooked it in my oven at 350 degrees for 10 min. I have to say that I have had better from other places here in Las Vegas.

The saving grace were the meatball sliders, now those were good, and had I just ordered those this would be a better review. The knots were fresh, cooked correctly and every thing was in balance. 

Over all the 2 star rating was due to the pizza, and the service I got from the person behind the counter who had to be reminded to give me my slider order with the pizza. Maybe I will try again, but not for pizza.

Oh the kicker is that wanted to charge me $15 to deliver their food to me. Be careful, since their site does not say any thing about the charges you might get hit with,",tNr1ZQchg2P3_iCdJUL3Yw,1,0,2,w-ckpoYyS-W76UJ4Vd8rNQ
2221368,2010-12-28,6,9IpKGHaPy3hhXo9g5Bt7lg,"When you open the menu for Metro Pizza, there is a sweet little ""story"" about Metro Pizza that takes you all the way back to 1905... 

That's great and all, but I want the REAL Metro Pizza story... the one that CLEARLY starts somewhere around '85 with a BetaMax machine and lots and lots of recorded episodes of Miami Vice... or a love for AC Slater and Screech, as evident by the awesome 80s décor that hasn't been retouched since, well... the 80s. 

Seriously! In all its pastel painted glory and neon finery this place is legit and a GREAT place to grub!

I ordered the Meatball Sliders - four garlic knots cut into little 'buns"" complete with meatball, melted provolone, and sauce and served with fries. I ordered my sliders with the Garlic Romano fries, crisp fries dusted in Romano cheese and minced garlic... they were delicious and I'd definitely recommend the sliders if you want something other than pizza, the meatballs were perfectly seasoned and cooked...juicy, not overdone...so good. 

The BF ordered a 16"" thin crust pizza with pepperoni... oh man, the grease was literally oozing onto the plate... haha... Greasy pizza means fresh ingredients and that it's gonna taste yum! I was surprised to see him put away three slices like it was nothing. I traded a slider for a slice and gained at least 4 lbs after that meal but oh man... good stuff. We even had half a pie to take home with us!

2222989,2011-06-28,4,9IpKGHaPy3hhXo9g5Bt7lg,"Sometimes I think I would rather talk about circumcision or which is the best web browser or perhaps whether Deckard was a replicant than try to have a sane conversation about pizza.

I don't know what it is about people that makes them lose all logic and diplomacy when it comes to pizza. Say you don't like New York-style pizzas, for example, like the way some people don't like charcoal grills or folk jazz but are still respectable citizens, and it's like the entire eastern seaboard will hop on a bus to your humble opinion on the internet and burn it for heresy. It's no better with Chicagoans, either. People have *strong* opinions about pizza that tend to manifest as The One True and Only Way.

Me, I've discovered I can appreciate all styles. I thought I hated New York-style until I tried Grimaldi's. I found Chicago-style to be a hot mess until I made my own at home. Sicilian? Detroit? CPK? They all have their merits.

Metro Pizza is after my own heart in this way in that they offer several different types of pizza on both their carryout and dine-in menus. Now we all can be happy! (And take that first step toward peace, which begins with admitting that more than one type of pizza exists.) I was most encouraged by their ""Metro crust,"" a thick crust option that I hoped would take me back to, well, most of the pizza I had before moving to Las Vegas (land of the floppy and greasy slice... and that's okay... for other people).

The first time we had Metro I closed my eyes in joy. Not perfect, but so much closer than most places. Finally!

The second time, same deal, although the flaws (as I see them) seemed to interrupt my bliss more this time. 

The third time... um, what happened? (But edible.) 

The fourth time we threw most of two large pizzas away. (And people, I seldom walk away from any combination of bread and cheese.)

Oh, Metro.

I think everyone needs to try Metro Pizza. They are immensely popular, and if my friends are any indication, odds are you will be very pleased with what they do and how they do it.

The staff at the Decatur location is extremely friendly. They usually offer us sodas while we wait for pick-up, so I feel like a big jerkface to criticize them now. But, I write the type of reviews I want to read, and when I'm considering pizza joints, I appreciate knowing whether I can expect a thick-crust pizza with good ingredients that isn't wet or greasy.

My standard order is a cheese with mushrooms plus Metro Crust. Right away, the first time I noticed that most of the toppings were in the center of the pizza. I don't know why this happens, but I never encountered it until I moved to Las Vegas. Here I see it All. The. Time. 

I also determined that, dough-wise, I loved the outer third or so of the crust, but the middle was just too soggy for me. So, a little scooching of the toppings, and I had a good pizza, albeit with a strange, wet mucky circle of dough from the center left over. The cheese tasted bright (ugh, Food Network is rubbing off on me) and wasn't rubbery, and the mushrooms were hearty and not slimy.

But, as I said, things have been downhill over the past four months. The crust became more and more undercooked, the toppings didn't taste as fresh plus they congealed more and more into the center, and everything took on a greasy feel. We're talking back-of-the-throat acid before the first slice is done.

After the third time we said, you know, maybe we were wrong. It's just not our style after all. But the other day I had a craving for a thick crust, something the local Grimaldi's doesn't do, so back we went and, like I already described, it was so bad that we actually threw the pizzas away. Pizzas that I know so many other people would love. (Along with a batch of garlic knots that could've doubled as rocks should we have wanted to end the meal with some xeriscaping.)

If I had Metro Pizza before moving to Las Vegas (after a lifetime in the midwest and south), I'd give it a two at best. (Again, with guilt for downrating such nice people.) But now that I know that this is (it seems) what pizza is *supposed* to be like for some people, I don't know what to do. 

Three stars, I guess, but it's really not ""A-OK"" with me.",l9YOhaPYvTJi_qfD3Y-wBQ,6,3,3,EuYqhlatJgGJsKssf789ng

My hubby is from vegas so he had heard of them to but never ventured out to try it. Near flamingo and decatur with time to spare before my doctors apt we decided to take a chance and try it. Mind you i was 6 months pregnant! Going here i was so hungry and once i walked in i could smell the aroma of homemade pizza and pasta. I was in heaven! Looking at the menu we had a hard time making a decision. We decided to go with an app [buffalo wings] and a pizzza pie [it had sausage, mushrooms, and pepperoni inside] and a side of french fries. the service was great. waitress was friendly and explained the biggest hits on her menu. 

The bus boy was great at refilling our drinks and they were never empty. i loved that. food came quicker than i thought since they did have a good amount of people there for a [monday] lunch hour. 

The wings were delish and i could not get enough of them. The fries were a little to salty for my liking... but then again i grew up with a mom who never allowed us to use salt plus i was pregnant and my taste buds didnt like salt too much. Lastly the pizza pie was huge! def enough for atleast 4 people. we had sooo many left overs. i swear when i went to the doctor i had gained atleast 10 pounds. 

we shall be back because the food was very good. very much reminded me of my hometown in cali where the pizza has lots of toppings and tastes homemade.

Great thing about this place is their are all about specials. Lunch specials. Specials on their calenders for every day (i.e on may 2nd if your names jacob you get a free pizza lmao. they also give half priced pizzas to those who dine in monday thru thurs from 3-5pm",WaAOt_eG0_-yLpG3fI--3g,0,0,4,B9J6XD-2ZEN8biYYtRdwKg

You can order the usual pepperoni, cheese, mushroom, sausage, etc. They are delicious and huge. But you can also order the stockyard. You say what exactly is a stockyard!? It's only a stuffed pizza. A stuffed pizza on steroids. Eat it with a knife and fork or just pick it up and stuff it into your mouth. You can eat a slice but can you eat another or maybe another after that? Don't forget the baseball sized garlic knots and desserts like cheese cake, tiramisu, and cannoli. 

It's located in a shopping center on Flamingo and Decatur next to a Food4Less grocery store and Makino restaurant. Though it's spacious it does get busy.

The most recent time I had come here, my server was friendly until she walked away from my table. She walked back to the cooking/cashier area she started to complain about my table. Not cool. She might of been having a bad day.

Location aside lets talk about my experience. My friend had it right when she said the ambiance reminded her of being on Saved by the Bell. Bright neon lights, black and white checkered flooring, good thing the 90's look is back in.  Being a fan of all things retro (and sad to say that I can refer to the 90's now as being retro), I enjoyed the cheesy decor.

Service was fantastic, we were celebrating a birthday and had a large party but were seated right away and had stellar service the entire time. 

The food equals delicious!  Soo... I'm doing the not eating fattening foods thing (again) so I ended up ordering their Dominica (sp?) salad while everyone else indulged in pizza *insert sad face here*.  Guess what?! I am a picky salad person and I can honestly say this was one of my favorite salads of all time!  Fresh ingredients and delicious dressing (I went with their house dressing), and excellent portion size.

I did snag a bit of the pizza crust from one of my fellow diners, it was crunchy and delicious and no doubts about it, should I have a hankering for a tasty slice of pie I would venture back to Metro Pizza without a second though (shady neighborhood and all).",9ktB1WEZx6ytMsRxRIMiJg,4,4,4,PY2NOvTRGvwq-kmjTlw-Bw

Put aside that the food was tasty- it was ridiculously affordable. Sixteen of us ate to our hearts' content for $15 each.  That's UNHEARD of for a dinner in Las Vegas. AND we ate plenty later that night as well. Metro Pizza did a great job helping us gage it so that we could have leftovers.

Having said that this location's delivery service has much to be desired. My work has been getting Metro delivery every Friday for several months now. Sadly there is nothing I can do to prevent this from happening as the boss loves Metro. 

From the very beginning we have had problems. Mostly with undercooked pizzas and employees getting sick. The past 3-4 weeks they have been significantly late or they forget things like salad which is all I eat now since getting sick. On top of it the delivery driver has a really poor attitude.  I'm very grateful for my boss providing lunches but this place is TERRIBLE and I would never recommend getting your party catered from Metro.

Recently, a couple co-workers and I decided to order from there for lunch.  I chose one of the stuffed pizzas called ""The Loop"", which references Chicago deep dish pizzas.  However, their stuffed pizzas are nothing like deep dish pizzas from Chicago.  From the description on the menu, this calzone-like dish comes with sausage, pepperoni, and mushrooms, and cheese (all my fav pizza toppings) stuffed inside a doughy shell.

When the delivery guy showed up I was starving and couldn't wait to dig in.  Upon opening the mini pizza box, I found exactly what the description foretold.  This thing was so big (I got the smaller sized one) that I could only eat half.  It also comes with your choice of dipping sauce, marinara or meat.  However, it is ridiculously greasy.  So much so that it bled through the box and even through the wax paper underneath it.  Overall it was excellent.  It was even good the next day since I only ate half.

Additionally, I highly recommend the parmesan-romano fries.  It's just french fries, but they cover them in the above mentioned cheeses and fresh garlic.  They come served with ranch.",zWANMGlOSLgoKm6PX6P-zg,1,0,4,okZfReF-Ee2YpAUPaEic_A

I went here last night hoping to find better than Papa John's and as far away from Northside Nathan's Detroit Pizza as humanly possible.  I've got to say, I really like pizza at Metro.  Although I live in Las Vegas now, I am originally from Rhode Island.  My all-time favorite pizza has always been A-1 Pizza in Newport, RI.  I guess some of my friends would say I'm difficult when it comes to eating out with me.  It's just I expect a lot when I'm dining out.  Something more than I would make for myself at home and service to match.  If that makes me ""difficult"" then so be it.

I've always been a fan of huge toppings and mondo amounts of cheese so I ordered the Metro Pizza with extra cheese on top and added zucchini and spinach.  I'm also a big eater so I figured I'd order a side of hot wings as well.  While they came to the table temperature hot and looking  great, I didn't care for the sauce.  It was vinegary and not spicy hot at all.  I'd asked them to make them as hot as possible.  I guess they just don't have the means to make them any hotter than you'd get with a standard hot sauce from a bottle.  They were maybe just a little under cooked as well.  Everyone likes a crispy wing right?  Requests them extra crispy and you may find them passable.

My partner ordered a small Stockyard stuffed pizza and it looked amazing and he stated that he'd enjoyed it very much.  Noting that the sweet Italian sausage was plentiful and yummy.  All in all, I'd have to say it was a good night for food at Metro.  I will be back to try more of their delicious pizza to be sure.

Okay, now the bad... The service was poor.  Just to give an example and not dwell on it too much I'll just tell you a few points they stick out 23hrs latter.  We sat with empty glasses for 20min till I asked for assistance from a second passing water.  No suggestions were offered and when asked about the different crust options it looked to us like she's grown tired of that same question from every dang customer and offered very little help or sympathy for two proclaimed ""first timers'.  No suggestions were given or up-selling suggested for that matter.

No one ever smiled and when our pizza was ready to be brought to the table it looked as if our waitress was debating with the other water who helped us as to who wanted to bring the pizza to out table (the second water was nominated).  We shared the last napkin at the end of the meal just not wanted to bother with her again.

The friendliest conversation we had with our waitress was the 10 second attempt at influencing her tip upon laying the bill on our table.  I thought the prices were maybe a little high for what we got, but they do have a special going on that attempts to those on a budget.  Mon-Thu 2:30-4:30pm is HALF OFF all pizza!  I'm liking that and at that price I'm still giving them 4 stars with horrible waitressing being my only real complaint.",HqMBoP9BfBkGCbi_iWjtAw,0,0,4,op-iFrVtOmYX9LH2wTiF-A

On a scale of 1-10, it is a 9.5.  I am only holding out because we have a Tony's Little Italy Pizza in Placentia, Ca. that ranks a 10 in my book.

We have been coming here for years, whenever we find ourselves in Las Vegas.  I think this may be the original location.  There is a decent amount of seating, not really huge, and bright, cheerful, NY ambiance.

We usually order the extra thick crust, but we were trying to cut down our carbs this time around, so went with a thin crust.  I loved it's thin ""crustiness""  with cornmeal base, and would definitely do it again.

But....our real downfall was the fresh out of the oven, hot Italian bread with sesame seeds.  Fabulous tasting, it has a crumbly crust and the most tender insides you can imagine. They brought out a soup bowl of their amazing marinara sauce (I ended up drinking it like soup when everyone else was done) for dipping, and lots of butter.  I think I like the less acidic marinara even better than the pizza sauce.  Either way, you will be tripping over your feet trying to come back just for that.

The good Italian sausage with fennel seed, cheese, pepperoni, and fresh mushroom is our standard order.  It never disappoints.  A large size gives you 8 large slices.

They kept the Coke coming, and it was free with a Yelp check-in.  Even refilled our marinara bowl.  Such piggies we were.  No leftovers. 

We walked away full and happy, 4 of us for ~ $30 including one generous glass of house red wine for Mr. B.

3248162,2011-02-14,1,9IpKGHaPy3hhXo9g5Bt7lg,"The wife and I recently embarked upon a quest to find our perfect pizza in Las Vegas.

I'm Australian and the wife grew up in Michigan and neither of us are fans of the two most prominent styles of pizza available in town - New York Style and Chigaco style.

I posted a thread on the discussion forums here detailing my preferences when it comes to pizza and a few people suggested Metro pizza and their ""metro crust"" as possibly satisfying our needs so we decided to give it a try.

The restaurant seemed very pleasant, but we decided on take-out. I ordered a large ""Gotham"" minus the mushrooms and my wife, ironically, ordered a plain cheese with mushrooms. Both were metro style and we were very encouraged watching our nice puffy looking pizzas come out of the oven.

When we got home we discovered that Metro Pizza is getting close to what we are looking for, but still isn't quite on the money. The real strength of metro is the superior quality of the toppings. They are absolutely delicious.

The crust is also tasty, but I sort of wished it wasn't quite so thick on the outside and wasn't quite so thin in the middle - perhaps a uniform thickness throughout.... Like many pizza places around town, the pizzas are a bit wet for my tastes and slices tend to point straight down to the ground when you pick one up rather than exhibiting any sort of backbone. This is a shame because the crust has a pleasantly chewy texture that I enjoy. If they could somehow cut the wetness about the interior of the pizza this would be a real winner.

Overall Metro Pizza is probably going to satisfy the majority of pizza fans in Vegas, particularly those with tastes less exacting than my own. It wasn't quite the crust we were looking for, but the quality of the toppings makes for a delicious taste that will surely call us back for repeat visits - at least until we find the holy grail of Vegas pizza.",U1XB9-3lh8Z3Eki6qU-v2g,4,1,4,fPEdbREqxj4SOMtRS4FzkQ

As soon as we entered I got the reminiscent feeling of a old school diner feel.  Located a bit off the strip but definitely worth the drive.  We ordered three kinds of pizza, garlic fries, garlic knots, and the sangria.  

The Stockyard stuffed pizza, Modesto specialty pizza, and the spring street east side pizza.  Three different kinds of pizza, all so big that I struggled to eat a slice of each.  I had to try them all since it looked and smelled so delicious when it was brought out.   It didn't just look and smelled good but it was actually really tasty.  Flavorful and fresh.  The modesto was the lighter one of the three and the stuffed pizza was pretty filling.  Wash it down with a cold cup of sangria, left us all full and happy.",AgfwqflEQL1VTDF3IMw9Og,1,0,4,tTGsPzmTnv-zLLVpA_3GWQ

I love me some pizza.  Here's the problem...I don't get to eat it much.  If I can, I'd have a pizza every other day.  Too bad, so sad for me.  But I finally got the chance a couple of nights ago after 12 weeks of clean eating.  I earned this and I'm going to turn this mutha out.  

This is not my first time to Metro Pizza.  This is just my first time at this one.  I've always been a fan of their pizza and let's not forget their garlic knots.  I shared half a pizza with my gf.  Okay, I actually ate 75% of the pizza, but who's counting?  My half included just pepperoni & mushrooms and Terri's was just mushrooms.  The pizza was tasty, thin, and not overly sauced out.  This is exactly how I like my pies.  As for the garlic knots, those little baked creatures didn't have a chance. The G-Knots are a bit greasy, small enough, and my goodness, the type of carbs my body has been missing.  Obviously, I'm a fan of Metro and wish to be back in another 16 1/2 weeks.  

PS:  We had a slight issue when our pizza first arrived.  It was missing the mushrooms, but this was remedied quickly.  To top it off, we also got hooked up with canoli's.  

BTW:  This Metro does remind me of Max's from ""Saved by the Bell"".  We're just missing Kelly Kapowski.

The pizza is good, not exactly mind-blowingly amazing, but good. The thing that gets me every time is the house salad dressing. I need to find out if it's made in house or purchased because that stuff is delicious. I always use the bread that comes with my lunch special to soak up any remaining dressing. Mmmm. 

I have been to Metro a couple times with co-workers and shared some appetizers. The only one that stands out is the nuclear fries. They aren't messing around, those bad boys are hot. Or I am a wuss.

4259156,2014-09-08,0,9IpKGHaPy3hhXo9g5Bt7lg,"Ever since college (early 1990s), I've been coming to this pizza chain. This may be the only one that has not converted to their newer, updated theme, like a family style pizza place. It's very 1980's in here. I totally agree with Blair B. on the decor looking like it came from ""Saved By The Bell"" set, bright colors, and geometric shapes paired with black and white print contrast. 

Still my favorite place to get a pizza at a sit-down restaurant. My favorite remains to be be the ""Gotham""- pepperoni, sausage, ground beef, mushrooms, green peppers, and onions. And then, to take some home, to have at another time, it's a treat. It's not as greasy as my husband's favorite, Pizza Hut. I've also had on the menu: the sandwiches (eggplant parmesan), salad (house), and the calzones (huge), too- which are all, very yummy too. What I always saw at the Trop location, was the huge pizza for takeout, I always wondered about that, I think that it's one topping, but I could be wrong.

This location is probably the smallest one, and so, it can fill up fast. But if you get there at the right time, your wait time (for a table and for your food) won't be so bad. Service was pretty good. The hostess was nice. But because it's a small place, there might be a wait for the restroom (single one).

Great pizza, good food, a trusted pizza chain restaurant. There is a reason why I've loved the Gotham pizza for so many years.",fiGqQ7pIGKyZ9G0RqWLMpg,2,0,4,Yr13y5YOE6GX9NbouLpIUA

Service on the other hand has been either spectacular or horrible. That being said, this is the most consistent of the Metro Pizza locations, and as Blair mentioned, its like going to the Max from Saved By the Bell. This has become our local Metro since moving across town, and we go once or twice a month. I've noticed it is never as busy as the E. Tropicana or Green Valley locations, its quieter due to its design, and the service is more consistent. The food is just as good as the other Metro's but the feel is like you are in a one of a kind pizza joint, not a mini chain pizza joint. 
The pizza is pricey, but its worth it. Our regular order is a small South Side (Chicago style cheese), with a side salad (massive - more than enough for two people with great ranch dressing)...if their are more than two of us, we usually add the nuclear fries, which have a good level of spice to them.

I ordered the Green Valley pizza but what came was Death Valley. The pizza was layered with lots of black olives and sun dried tomatoes. I asked for added broccoli, too. A pizza with an adjective green should be green, right? Not this one. I wanted to feast on a fucking evergreen forest. Nope, it was a vast black desert with patches of green.

She was short with us the whole time we were there. Not friendly at all. Yet she was chatting it up with the table right next to us for about 5 minutes after she took our order. Maybe they were her friends. Who knows? But the thing that really made me mad is she purposely made jokes about ""raiders fans"" talking extra loud so my boyfriend can hear. I know she saw the raiders hat he was wearing. She just finished taking our order then went on to the next table and started making jokes about the exact team he was wearing. I just think that's rude and NOT professional. I don't care how you feel about the raiders! 

For the rest of the time there she just ignored us. She looks at my empty drink (I saw bc we made eye contact), walks past twice but never said/did anything. We couldn't even get a refill until we asked.

It wasn't that busy but it still took longer than expected to get our food. I don't know if it felt like a long time because I was starving but I think it was because it took longer than needed. This was weird because all the other times I went the service was fine. Maybe because it was almost closing time but still annoying. Despite the food taking forever it was worth it. We ordered the meatball sliders and the personal pan size of the Metro pizza with just cheese. The meatball sliders come on garlic knots which makes them amazing! The personal pan size was huge and enough to split for two people. Its thick pizza which is my favorite. Since cheese is my favorite the only thing I would add to the pizza is more cheese. I will definitely be ordering these again when I return.,eh9uc8xHYR9-rki7fWggQQ,1,0,4,CNmcmx7fC71-a-KeaSFl_w

The best part of any Metro Pizza is the freakin food!!  The pizzas here are always perfect.  The only one I was disappointed with was the supreme.  It came with WAY too many toppings, like giant chunks of hamburger.  BALANCE, people!!  A pizza needs some balance with it's toppings.  I basically picked off half the toppings and then it was perfect.  Next time, we'll stick to just one or two topping pizzas.

4936441,2016-07-17,0,9IpKGHaPy3hhXo9g5Bt7lg,"Their primary goal is to get a pizza to your home, right? Then why would they take an order from us, spell our street name incorrectly and send the pizza delivery driver out with the wrong address of a place that doesn't even exist? What did he think he would do, sniff us out?

I had to call her back to figure this out FOR HER. Wouldn't you have made sure you even delivered to us before you took the order? Made sure you knew where we lived first? 

It gets better. They charge us $45 for a soggy pizza that finally showed but he managed to forget our salad. So my husband paid him and he went back for my salad. I found out it was missing and that he took the $45 plus $5 tip. I was quite upset. No comp offered and it had been well over an hour already. I called the manager and demanded our money back and to forget the food. So the driver came back with the money AND he took the pizza back with him that he left us. No class. Plus I'm sure he had to throw the pizza away since it was left at our house. Who would eat that coming back from a disgruntled customer?

It's a shame this happened. Dominos has messed up and handled the transaction well to make us happy in the end. This place had no clue. The pizza is too pricey to put up with subpar service and maybe even a snide dig on us (the taking back of the pizza).

The dough was tasty, and they did not short us on any ingredients. The pizza was cooked perfectly with a nice crispy crust yet warm doughy center. Overall we were satisfied with the taste. Only set backs: the crust was not deep dish, the pizza itself was very wide for Chicago-style, and the meat sauce to put on top was very thin (almost like college dorm quality spaghetti marinara sauce).

With that said, this pizza was VERY middle of the road, 'meh'. It wasn't atrocious, but after 7 years in Vegas and hearing about metro pizza, my mind is blown as to how such average quality pizza is a hit to the point of multi-store Las Vegas expansions.

The dough was extremely bland and needed a double proof, a bit of molasses and either some cornmeal or garlic sprinkle to make it stand out.

The sauce was tasteless and again, nothing special whatsoever.

The cheese they use was ultra cheap, substantially worse than the grande brand cheese (industry standard these days) and created an oil slick on the paper plate when folded in half and eaten NY style. I've had tons of good pizza made with marginal quality cheese like this when the sauce or dough were able to compensate but I couldn't find one redeeming aspect at Metro besides the friendly service.

5198953,2010-03-31,9,9IpKGHaPy3hhXo9g5Bt7lg,"Now, is when I admit the ugly truth: I am not a pizza snob. I know I have been hiding behind a foodie cloak, albeit a discount foodie cloak, but I am pretty easy to please when it comes to a slice with cheese. (Couldn't resist the rhyme.) If the sauce has some kick and the toppings are not from a can, I am a star-giving fool!

With that off my chest, I would like to say that I really like Metro Pizza. However, I might add, that I think Metro could please even a foodie. I have been at least four times, and if I keep going back, something must be right.

The place looks like a 50s diner, and there are some rather uncomfortable booths in the back. Watch out for that. But, the servers are always nice, even when we show up right before closing. 

They have a calendar of goofy specials that changes every month. Goofy specials include days when you can get 50% pizza if your name is Mina. (The name changes so don't go and change your name.) Also, they have an early bird special Mondays - Thursdays, 2:30pm - 4:30pm: Any Pizza, Any Size, Half the Price!

Now, as for the pizza, we always get thin crust. They bake the pies in a pizza pan that has knobs along the bottom (probably a technical term for this), and I think that helps create a beautifully crisp crust without excessive greasiness. The toppings are generous and fresh. We generally don't order one of the specialty pizzas; we just get the toppings we want. Man, I can't really think of anything to complain about here, but then again, I am no pizza snob. Which reminds me, have you tried the new Domino's? ;)",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,10,8,4,yi-rHEUbe1jqZ2XsehFwTA

We walked in at about 7:00pm on Friday night for date night, and were seated right away.

The place itself is a little worn down, but still clean, and comfortable.  

Service was...strange.
We were seated by a friendly girl, and then a young guy in a tuxedo shirt and bowtie came over to get our drinks...when we gave him our coupon for free meatball sliders, he became a bit confused, and had to get the manager, who took care of us for the rest of the night...but the guy in the bowtie kind of...hovered around the table, almost like he wasn't sure what he was supposed to be doing...
The manager was very nice though.

We waited about 20 minutes for the food, which isn't a bad wait. 
The food LOOKED amazing. 

The Meatball Sliders:  meatballs, sauce and cheese served on a garlic knot with french fries. 
Whoever came up with the idea to do a slider on a garlic knot...well, they're a genius, and I want to kiss them.  What a great idea!
For me, the meatballs could have been seasoned just a touch more, but they were pretty good.  Very heavy.  I only had one (and it happened to be the only slider on the plate that was DRIPPING in grease), and was pretty much done eating.

Pantheon Pizza:  White pizza with Garlic cream sauce, Mozzarella, chicken, spinach and feta.  YUM.  Absolutely delicious. 
The only issue with this, is that the pizza was not cooked evenly...my two pieces had crust that was solid and crisp.  Morgan's 2 were soggy.   The flavor was really good, but we'd have liked to see a little more consistency with the cooking. 

All in all, the meal was good.  The flavors were there, and service was pretty good.  I would definitely go back again.",renPzRDqMZpMaHiCD_e1_A,3,3,3,FqCP9cuUeajpv_4Jz0j_AA

As a bonus, if you're eating low carb or are on a diet, they have crustless pizza. I know it sounds ridiculous to order this, but for us dieters this can be a life saver!

Stromboli - Hand Rolled with Ham, Salami, Pepperoni, Mozzarella, Red Peppers

Tiramisu
Chocolate Fudge Layer Cake

When family comes to town and only has two requests, one of them for a sweet breakfast spot they've been lusting over via Instagram and the other for a calzone served by one of America's true Pizza legends it is not too difficult to accommodate, a take-out lunch from John Arena at Metro Pizza at Decatur continuing to show that Las Vegas' Pizza scene rivals any in the nation from top-to-bottom, with a few newer spots also cropping up in recent months to fill the space between.

Not generally one to do take-out, but a confluence of circumstances including work, other meals and travel making it a necessity since Chef Arena wanted to say hi to the visitors, it was just before noon on Friday that two ladies visited the ""Retro"" Metro to pick up an order that turned out to include a few bonus items, dining on paper plates in a small office not exactly as much fun as a visit to the Pizza parlor, but showing signs that Metro's product stands up to delivery, though there was never really any doubt considering the birthday spread and countless pharmaceutical company deliveries in the months before.

Starting off with one of Metro's signature Pizzas, the crust one of those indistinct styles that is fluffy around the edges with a slightly wet center that is certainly not Neapolitan, but also not like pan or crispy and thin, the ""Abbondanza"" features all sorts of Meat atop Metro's slow-roasted Sauce and melty Mozzarella plus freshly torn Basil, the ""86th Street Square Pie"" a more recent addition that has thrilled diners ever since it joined the menu just over a year ago, a true Sicilian in the best of ways with great lightness and an open crumb thanks to the prolonged fermenting process.

Happy to see the hand rolled Stromboli for the first time, Metro Pizza's Dough wrapped tightly around Ham, Salami, Pepperoni, Red Peppers and Cheese with a crispy exterior and fluffy center that will make fans of Four Kegs wonder why they've been sitting at that Dive for so long, it was after everyone else had already gotten their fill of the ""718"" that the glistening yet oilless pouch once again proved a best-of-the-best choice, the smooth Ricotta and Mozzarella blend literally bursting forth with occasional bits of Ham as soon as a knife punctured the surface.  

Sold out of Carrot Cake temporarily, the most popular Dessert on Metro's menu something worth going out of one's way for at a price less than half what Carbone charges for a lesser version in a smaller portion, it was instead with a slice of Chocolate Cake, Tiramisu and two Cannoli that the meal came to an end, the filled-to-order shells still leagues better than the one's people line up for at Carlo's or Buddy V's while the Tiramisu was better than remembered, the Lady Fingers a bit lighter and the Coffee flavor more balanced amidst the Mascarpone.

*****Unable to rate a 'restaurant' on take-out, but still the best comprehensive Pizza experience in a city where places like Pizza Rock and Flour & Barley have attempted to be everything to everyone in recent years, Metro Pizza remains ""America's Neighborhood Pizzeria"" in marketing only - it belongs to the people of Las Vegas and Southern Nevada at any of its five locations, though we are happy to share with anyone who is looking for the sort of stuff you can't find on the Strip with a few recent experiences showing delivery to not cause any sort of quality compromise.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,6,6,5,Y7wM24veV9ofOQ6e9Je6AQ

3 Reasons why Metro Pizza is as good as it gets:

1. The service was spectacular. Before we ordered, my dining companions had a math-heavy conversation about whether two small pizzas or one large pizza was going to be a better deal. We asked the manager the same question. I thought that I was going to get some BS answer but I was pleasantly surprised he had already done the math. He assured us that the large is indeed a better deal than two small pizzas. Of course they answered all of our ""stupid"" questions, topped off our waters, brought us refills of bread during our pizza wait, and the usual. At the end of the meal, the manager brought out complimentary cannoli's. What's there to complain about?

2. Metro Pizza is extremely accommodating. They were happy to half/half our pizza. We ended up ordering a large with the Patheon on one side and a Meat Lovers' on the other side. Metro Pizza also gave us nice sides of ranch without the usual 33 cent fee. They have a calendar of specials every day so you know you are going to get amazing food at a steal!

3. The Pie is amazing! Not too thick, not too thin.,.not burnt nor under-cooked. Goldilocks would have been pleased...these people put time and love into their pies. Everything tasted delicious but what impressed me the most was the crust! Pizza crusts are usually doughy and heavy but no! This one was light, crispy and airy. Amazing....simply amazing.",ygTdmtmxYio_uYbWbV5wkg,2,1,5,gIZr6_dbR-rap0VNufNKBw

They brought  a basket of bread it was just OK. Not worth the calories. I ordered wine, chicken wings and a pizza. Husband ordered a pizza. He said his was good but not enough sauce or cheese. The wings were not crispy and not spicy at all. Then my pizza came so much after my husbands he had finished his by the time mine arrived. I also wanted a second glass of wine and had to call someone over to order it. If I were a server I would be all over the wine. It is the fastest way to up the bill and increase the tip. It seems this happens frequently that they keep the soft drinks full but never ask about wine. Anyway it was just OK here.

I always thought he was exaggerating and I wouldn't agree if I ever tried the place.  Sooo we finally went there together and I now must hang my head and say that I am a believer in Metro Pizza.

I got the chicken and herb calzone, he got the small Gotham.  The calzone (which was HUGE) had fresh tomatoes and herbs, cheese was evenly melted, and the chicken was nice and juicy.  As much as I hate to admit it, though, his pizza trumped all others I've had in Vegas.  The meat was juicy chunks of ground beef and pepperoni.  The crust was just the right amount of flaky and crunchy.  Mmmmm!!

Our waiter was very sweet and polite.  He seemed to be a hard worker as he was not only helping us, but cleaning about and doing other duties while the others didn't seem to be doing much.  Unfortunately, there was a weird smell towards the back of the restaurant where we were seated.  Almost a wet table rag smell.  The food and service made up for it though.

Now their salads are like fifteen bucks. For some noodles? ON top of lettuce with a chicken finger? No thanks. 

The pizzas are good too...if you like to spend that much on pizza. And I dont mind sometimes, when it isn't cold and the servers aren't ass-hats. 

I have tried to go back, every time feeling nostalgic for the time when this place was good. I have met the owners, they used to be all about the pizza!  Now it is overpriced, the food does not have the same flavor. The italian sub I drooled for for two weeks and finally got? A HUGE oily disappointment. The sunspot pizza I bragged to out of town company about? Cold, with an undercooked center and sparse toppings. 

The service? Last time I watched a table full of servers sit and have lunch with their manager, while we sat two tables away with no refills, food taking over a half an hour to come out after waiting a half an hour to order, and just in general a terrible time. When I told the server about it, she shrugged and get the manager who blew me off. I was presented with a check and I paid it, vowing never to return and feeling bent over and....well, ripped off I guess would be the point here.

Now my husband and I have been coming to this metro for years and his parents before that. The food in fantastic and always so fresh. I don't live very far from here so I decided to order delivery one night. The food was on time and perfect. Later on that night I went to check my email and found out I was over charged (I get email alerts through my bank), I checked my bank and almost fainted. My bill was about $24, which I was charged and saw on my account, with an additional $236 (separately charged). They charged me twice. I called and spoke with the manager that was on for the night, he proceeded to tell me that they did not charge me twice and he doesn't know what happened. Well I know for sure the bank doesn't automatically charge you on their own. The staff must have charge me twice, the manager didn't believe that was the case. First of all, as a manager you should be reassuring your client, take some responsibility and learn how to do your job. You CANT tell me you don't know what happened . That is a joke!!! He called the owners and they said the charge was going to drop the same night and that it wasn't going to get charged. And then gave me a $25 credit for next time. Credit or no credit, it's not the point. Whoever ran my credit card, ran it twice and they couldn't take any responsibly for it, THEY JUST DONT KNOW!!!! Apparently, they just don't know what they are doing. So good food, but if you ever order delivery, be aware. And check your bank afterwards.",zu9iOobbo5BxfOYxk9CCrQ,0,0,1,vw4jSNp8pVzuWUF1JHcuKA

I have never been to a pizzeria in my life that did not serve single slices, I had to order an entire small pizza with my order. Usually I grab a slice to start off then will grab a main dish. I decided okay, if they only offer the pizza by the pie it must be pretty decent, it was just okay. Wasn't bad wasn't great. Definetly not the best slice I've ever had and I'm sure not the worst. I also ordered meatball sliders, they also were just okay. Nothing about this place was either great or bad. I would have given 3 stars if I was able to get a single slice and save myself the $9 dollars I had to spend on a small pizza.

They have thin-crust pizza and many other selections too, including garlic parmesan fries which are sinfully delicious. 

Tasty warm bread with butter, the most reasonably priced wine in town, and pitchers of Fat Tire for less than $10.  The owners deserve a medal -- and should open one in L.A. ASAP!

5702924,2011-09-28,0,9IpKGHaPy3hhXo9g5Bt7lg,"It was during the MAGIC Fashion Show I was first introduced to Metro Pizza.

My party was staying at the Mandalay Bay Hotel and was looking for something easy to pick up or delivery. I was charged with providing lunch, so I looked around the hotel-- to no surprise, many things in the hotel for was overpriced and of poor quality. In the search for help I went to Concierge service desk. After speaking with a Concierge, he recommended Metro Pizza for delivery. All I needed to hear was that Metro Pizza was featured on FoodNetwork as Vegas' top pizza place. I got their number and dialed away. 

After half an hour post-order, the Pizza arrived at my suite on the 63rd floor of Mandalay Bay (some how the delivery man by-passed all the security). They told me that it would be forty five minutes to an hour, because of the heavy demand for pizza and traffic congestion that day, but I was glad they came earlier than planned. 

I ordered two pans of pizza, both large size, one cheese and one combination. Both were terrific! The price may be somewhat steep, but for a delivery place outside of the hotel to deliver to your room and be the quality that it was is exceptional. (The pizza satisfied many palates that were present: Koreans from Korea, native New Yorkers, vegetarians from Florida, and picky eaters from California).

The pizza itself was different from those other pizza spots. The crust was crisp, but not difficult, the correct temperature for the cheese so it doesn't look like gruyere over french onion soup, and the more than generous portion for toppings that were very tasty.

I will definitely order from this place again in the future!",LMh3DpdEipO7JSrYvQ0QIQ,1,0,4,m91jDe2ah61RzyYHkjzKRw

I began with a very good bowl of old-fashioned Minestrone Soup with shredded Mozzarella Cheese that was chockfull of green beans, okra, broccoli, carrots, peas, Lima Beans, Kidney Beans, celery, cauliflower, White Onions, potatoes, and rigatoni.  That's a mouthful of ingredients, and each mouthful was packed with vegetable goodness.  A Small Dinner Salad was also a nice preliminary course, with Iceberg Lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, onion, pepperoncini, croutons, and zesty housemade red-tinged Italian Dressing.  I tried to avoid the excellent crusty Pizza Dough and butter that was set before my party, but only had enough willpower to stop after downing four sumptuous butter-slathered slices.

I ordered a large pizza with four toppings: pepperoni, cooked tomatoes, mushrooms, and sausage.  My New York style pizza was bubbling and smoking hot when it arrived, with the cheese perfectly melted on top, and the dough suitably supple for slices to be easily lifted by hand and guided to a welcoming mouth.  The pepperoni and sausage were both on the mild side but with just a little kick.  It was excellent saucy pizza.

Diane's large Ham Pizza with extra cheese was also naturally cheesy and delicious.  Surprisingly, even with everything else I had to eat, I devoured all but three slices of my pizza at the restaurant--which left less leftovers to look forward to for lunch the next day.  When that time came, the slices heated up well in the oven, and tasted just as good as when my pizza was originally served.

Service was good, except I was initially erroneously charged for a lemonade that I was never served.  I was merely adding my own flavor drops to water.  The mistake was quickly and amiably rectified.

The jam packed Sicilian sub was great and set on home hearth baked bread it just melts in your mouth!

The baked ziti loaded up with sauce, mozzarella and ricotta cheese it was the best!

The portions are very generous as you are guaranteed to be leaving with leftovers for another meal!

I have always had their pizza in the past which is very good however this is the first time I ordered a pasta dinner and am so happy I did!!!

The Spicy shrimp pasta was divine, the sauce spicy and so flavorful the perfect mix of goodness! The big shrimp mixed in as well was very good and all tied in with angel hair pasta. Soooo good and my boyfriend loved it as well because we shared both of our dishes.

We even saved $12 bucks off of our meal with an Entertainment book buy one dinner entree get one free. That is insane considering what the portion of the pasta dinners are!

I never get the opportunity to take advantage of this offer, until New Year's. I got home early from work and I just couldn't resist trying out their discounted pizza. 

We tried The Loop, a stuffed pizza. It was my first time trying any of Metro's less traditional pies. The pizza was enormous, my mom and I were only able to finish one piece each and we had leftover pizza for the rest of the week. I had wished that the pizza would be stuff with more sauce and our server had recommended we have our sauce on the side as well, since we'd likely be taking it home for later. That was a smart idea, but it also left the pizza a little dryer and less flavorful than I would have liked. Next time, if I order this again, I will definitely get a smaller pizza so I could order the sauce on top to allow it to soak in and really saturate the pizza.
