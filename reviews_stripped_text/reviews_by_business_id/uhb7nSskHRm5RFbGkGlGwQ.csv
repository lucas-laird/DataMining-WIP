124294,2013-02-08,0,uhb7nSskHRm5RFbGkGlGwQ,"After discovering that Carlos' Kitchen closed the day before I got there, I scrambled to find somewhere else close by to get a burger recently. I remembered that a workout friend told me about a new place near our gym called Biscuits 2 Burgers so I thought I'd seek it out. They pretty much don't exist online still; no official website, no Yelp page, so I started driving west on Tropicana until I found it. Despite all of this, was my experience encouraging enough to keep this place around?

The restaurant is in a fairly new strip of retail on Tropicana and Grand Canyon, a lot of the spaces are still empty and this whole area is kind of quiet. Biscuits has a temporary (?) vinyl sign above the door that doesn't stand out too much; I can only hope they replace it with something better if they plan on sticking around. The interior is very open and clean with a large number of 2- and 4-top tables, as well as a high counter facing the kitchen area. The tagline on their menu is 'your neighborhood café', and it definitely had that feel during my visit; everyone knew the chefs while I was in there and they were all discussing each other's family members and things.

The menu is pretty small; one small page of breakfast items, and a handful of burgers and sandwiches. In an attempt to order something a bit neutral, I ignored the pastrami-topped burger, Philly burger and Hawaiian burger and went with a California burger with avocado, tomato and cheddar. There's also a note on the menu that 'all sandwiches are served with choice of chips or macaroni salad', but I was given the choice of skinny or fat fries which relieved me a bit. The burger had great quality meat; it was very flavorful and cooked close to medium rare. The bun was grilled and tasty, kind of the off-the-shelf backyard BBQ variety, and a bit too thin for this burger as it split into a few pieces about halfway through. The avocado was good, but do three slices of avocado turn a cheeseburger into a California burger? I guess so. The LTO were all decent, a bit too much lettuce maybe but that's easily remedied.

The fries were of the very generic frozen variety, but they were cooked very much to my liking of done to a bit over done so I was ok with them. Overall this was not bad at all, and certainly way better than Great Links which supposedly won some best burger contest in town. The place is cute; I hope it can have some staying power in a fairly empty retail development with poor signage and no advertising that I know of. It was also a good value for the money; my meal came to a fairly reasonable $9.19 with an iced tea. If you're in the neighborhood definitely come by to support these guys, I don't know if it would make it onto any of my must-have lists, but they get my approval.",0G9BcXSQscv_GnhlNwFfjw,3,1,3,Zy1fUqyATbf8xh1iX1MryA

We purchased the Groupon, we had never been here but definatly wanted to try it. We figured you couldnt go wrong with BISCUITS and BURGERS. My 3 year old son however only eats soup. 

My father and I both ordered the trump Burger, My son got the chicken tortilla soup, and my mother got a club. 

The trump Burgers WERE AMAZING. They were so amazing and a really good value. They were so big we could only eat half of each, we ended up taking a whole burger home. My son LOVED the soup. He even took some home and had it later in the night. Keep in mind my son DOES NOT eat leftovers, in fact this is the first and only time he has. 

Joe was our server, he was wonderful. He also cooked our burgers and we were able to watch him cook them, they were amazing. 

I cannot wait to try this place for breakfast. We will definitely be back. 

If you want a good burger, good service, and happy kids/toddlers this is a dinner spot everyone can agree on.

315657,2013-06-23,0,uhb7nSskHRm5RFbGkGlGwQ,"We went to Biscuits 2 Burgers today around 1:30 and were happily surprised.  Since it was a small restaurant in an inconspicuous area with a simple, vinyl sign, I did not expect too much.  However, I was immediately impressed when we walked in.  The clean, modern decor and fresh flowers on every table created an inviting ambiance that was accentuated even more by the friendly demeanor of our server.  After ordering, we were offered a fresh pastry while we waited for our food.  While we declined, it was still an appreciated gesture.  My boyfriend ordered the California Burger (avocado, tomato and cheddar on an 8 oz angus beef patty) and I ordered the City Sliders (goat cheese and caramelized onions on three 2 oz angus beef patties).  The food was simple, fresh and delicious.  My only criticism would be about the fries.  They were good, but they were obviously from the freezer, so they were nothing special.  We finished off the meal with a complimentary flan (which our server brought out since it was our first time eating there).  Overall a great experience, and we will be back to try the breakfast at some point soon.  The best part?  For an awesome meal with two entrees and one drink, our bill was only 16 and change.  Wow.  Come and try Biscuits 2 Burgers, and hopefully it will stay around for a while.",gReC0AWzLaUVIj_E-2xTZw,2,0,5,Guu7dFp8HIvtd-qjUl-oKA

350482,2013-10-02,0,uhb7nSskHRm5RFbGkGlGwQ,"Hopped in to Biscuits 2 Burgers on my lunch hour because of a recommendation from a co-worker that had a decent first time.  There were 3 of us and 2 other people in the place.  Before officially deciding on our lunch choices, our waitress brought over  a tray of baked goods.  My friend said in what I assumed was a statement / question, 'We get to pick one of these out?'  Our waitress just smiled and my 2 friends took a muffin each.  We then ordered our meals.  I would say it took about a half hour after ordering to receive our food.  Like I said there were 5 people total in this joint.  The food...average at best.  I went for the turkey burger, and I kid you not, the patty was just like the frozen patties you can find in any groceries freezer section.  Not fresh. And didn't really taste like turkey.  My friend got the 'Pancake Sandwich.' I couldn't wait to see this, it sounded amazing on the menu.  I kid you not again...it was 2 pancakes with an egg on top cooked however you like it.  The egg was 1/4 the size of the pancakes.  Didn't look a thing like a sandwich.  

Now for this last part I will take partial blame.  But I still cannot wrap my head around how it played out.  Right after our meal was over, I asked the waitress if she would mind splitting the bill 3 ways.  Honestly, how it went was 1 meal per person and 1 person had an iced tea, so I didn't feel too bad about this request.  THERE WERE 5 PEOPLE IN THERE!  She says ok and walks away.  Only to come back a minute later and say that the machine kinda fumbled up the amounts a little.  She went on to describe that 1 person has 1 meal, 1 person has 1 meal and 1 iced tea, the last person has 1 meal and 2 muffins.  The iced tea didn't go with the persons meal that ordered it and the muffins indeed were not an act of kindness, rather a ploy to spend more money, which is fine, except my friend in a round about way earlier had suggested that they were free and the waitress did not correct him otherwise.  Now he is stuck with paying for 2 muffins because the machine 'fumbled' it up. Karma I guess for thinking anything in this life would be free.  And just to mention also, those muffins were $1.50 each and no bigger then a kids fist.  Total rip off.  Not only was the turkey burger from the freezer section, but the muffins came from a Betty Crocker muffin mix bag in the Baking Needs aisle.  

Skip it....and believe when you walk in somewhere and it is more empty then full, there's a reason for it.",x7eFMsY6PgI58fU5DVbLGQ,0,0,1,CpVeyotcNpGZLjG2Q-3GyA

1138687,2013-01-25,3,uhb7nSskHRm5RFbGkGlGwQ,"Today I gave B 2B a try after a late morning work out.  Surprised they don't have a sign yet given the apparent money spent building out the kitchen  - all new with dominating stainless steel equipment.  the space reminds me of Mr. Mama, Eggs Cafe, norm's cafe, etc.  - relatively small dining room serving breakfast and lunch.

one other table occupied when i walked in around 10:30.  Straight forward menu - prices seem very reasonable.  I opt for the basic 2 egg breakfast with sausage - $5.50 ( pic attached )   since the place is called Biscuits 2 Burgers i figure i should try the biscuit so i ask for one with the meal.   The server asked if i wanted 2, if so, it's $2 more.  I ask,""  does the meal come with toast ?""  answer: you can also get toast with the biscuit.  I simply want a biscuit instead of toast.  ""Ok""

Food took a while which surprised me since only one other table.  Even with one cook, how long does it take to warm up some sausage, fry up 2 eggs and potatoes and put a biscuit on a plate ?  Based on what i received, I'm guessing the delay was due to the potatoes - my guess they were cooked up fresh - if busier, they need to cut corners on the food prep - this can occur without sacrificing quality ( and yes, I've worked as a cook and I've owned a bar/grill so i know a few things ...emphasis on few ! ) 

The food was decent, somewhat unremarkable but i didn't have high expectations except when it came to the biscuit.  I figure a place called biscuit 2 burger will pride itself on their biscuits.  The biscuit was underwhelming - bummer !

Surprised to see a surcharge of .50 on my bill that can only be attributable to the biscuit.  I figure it's unlikely i'm returning to this place so i opted not to debate the surcharge.",N044aCKJv3G5WuvwT5AJcA,5,3,3,MVR2_WFuyyb-m9EC016MSg

I feel for the guy he tried his hardest. Now for the cook I think he was a rented cook, his jacket had an advertisement  of customcook.com, we looked it up and its a catering company. So upon walking in all the 4 seater tables were dirty, two were occupied and last clean one available for our party of 3. We got seated immediately. We are getting ready to order when we were notified they are out of biscuits, wait isnt the restaurant called biscuits 2 burgers. How could they be out of biscuits its in their name isn't it their specialty?  Its Tuesday morning at 11, not a saturday or sunday where I could understand possibly running out.  So the server informed us the biscuits were in the oven which would only be about 15 to 20 more minutes, ok no big deal we'll wait. Well 15 to 20 mins turned into an 1hour and 10 minutes and I'm not exaggerating. in the mean time a table has already walked out.  We finally got our food, my husband ordered the a poached egg slider it was extremely over done, was not runny at all, I ordered an egg over medium which was over hard, the bacon was under cooked, we couldn't handle this anymore so we had to walk out. I have never written a review nor ever walked out of a restaurant. Not mention the server told us he would only charge us for one entree when we didn't even touch any of them,  needless to say we didn't pay for anything. this place is a joke I was really looking forward to trying something new, It was a waste of an hour in half that I will never get back. Server stated 3 people quit on him today, this place needs needs new management, that cares and would be there to help in situations like this.",wc_mN_1c_tphKmU7LkIWsA,1,0,1,RXC7E3jmdR7zhx27TGRJ-g

I ordered the California burger with an over easy egg and my husband got the New York burger that had pastrami on it. Both of our burgers were cooked to perfection and tasted great! Biscuits 2 Burgers only uses fresh ingredients made to order and you could taste the difference. Also, the fries were skinny and crisp just how I like them. And the prices, amazing!

I think the restaurant should have regular biscuits, it would make it a lot more pleasant for customers like me who wanted a plain biscuit with my sliders. Also they sell donuts, which I loved, but the donuts were dry and not what I was expecting. I would love for them to continue selling donuts, but it would be awesome if they sold Krispy kremes. That would've been awesome. And also when they offer donuts they need to advice you they're not free and what the price is.

The food is good enough- please don't misunderstand - but the service is AWFUL. With just 2 other tables to cover, our waiter left us sitting for 15 minutes with menus in front of us, no apologies, no water, NOTHING. When he finally got around to taking our order, he had to have us repeat it several times. When I asked what kind of yogurt they offered with the granola and yogurt on the menu, he said he didn't know and took another 5 minutes (literally) to come back and tell me strawberry. 

At the 45 minute mark, he came back and asked my husband what kind of cheese and how did he want his eggs cooked again.. he forgot (yet he wrote it down when he took the order?) I started to tell him if they hadnt started cooking yet to forget it, we would leave since all I had was a semi cold cup of coffee served to us). He told me they had, an obvious lie, as my dish of yogurt and granola didn't need cooking and he was asking about the eggs and went away again for another few minutes. 

All said and done, including paying the bill this quick breakfast took us over an hour. 

I know the frustration on the wait was exacerbated by the alternatively whining/screaming child at the table behind us, which isn't their fault, but still made the already bad experience worse (side rant - parents? If your kid is sick, KEEP THEM HOME! The women didn't apologize, but told the waiter during one of the 4 trips the kid and grandma took to the car to calm her down from the screaming temper tantrum, ""no, shes not usually like this but she has a fever and doesn't feel well""  Seriously?)

I'm sorry to see a small business suffer but the owner needs to hire some help and make sure his customers are attended to. I'm generally a patient and forgiving person, and would have been fine if they employed even one basic customer service skill.",y7XuQa2G03PcVQQGmHs3Tg,7,0,1,6FnGPS_8R9-qc9Mfrrvs6A

He needs to prep and hire a fast short order cook. This place is very very inexpensive so I know they're not making as much profit as they should. Don't save on the heating bill just raise the price on some of your items to make up the difference.  People will pay for good food as long as they don't have to wait to long.

I ended up getting the breakfast sliders, due to many good reviews of it here on yelp. Yes the biscuits were fresh, and yes they were good. But overall, the dish was just meh. My sausage was super oily and the potatoes were underseasoned. As for my coffee? Super burnt, which is usually a huge indicator that it's just been sitting on the warmer for quite some time.

A great detail on the Caesar salad is the fried Parmesan bowl. It added a nice flavor!

Other yelpers have mention it. It was more ghetto before then put up permanent sign (one that really cool, nice logo not just words of the restaurant but screams personality). The outside never believe the type of establishment find once open the front door. The area itself really nothing else much open in that small shopping area and most of the other spots are empty or feels like ghost town. Like I said once you walk in be surprise! It had nice clean, totally new restaurant look, and really nice small cafe feel for me. Each table have fresh flowers something that you hardly see in restaurants. It very much open air feeling between the open kitchen, the country decor, and one of the big artwork or art on the wall. It plate with two eggs and smiley bacon strips. Great saying that I forgot. =((( The lady that was hostess/waitress was fabulous from the get go. Friendly. Answered any questions I had about the menu. Good fun talking stories with her. I was the only one in the restaurant. 

I decided on breakfast (I do plan on coming back again for lunch). I had the banana nut pancakes with side of turkey bacon (it comes with sausage or bacon; craving turkey bacon so cost more). Talk about nice portion. Not that I love my go to breakfast spots where the pancakes portions sizes enormous. It was refreshing change look at the plate have three decent size pancakes with nice toppings and presentation had clean simple look. The taste was great! The pancakes was right between dense and fluffy. I like. The turkey bacon on the side was nice crispy and delicious. I also ordered the fresh orange juice. Yelpers that good call!!! The juicer machine thought was pretty cool looking in the kitchen. Just observation. It does the good that for sure. It tasted fresh, not concentrated, or juice get at buffet or any hotel restaurant out of gallon jug. The whole meal for me was fabulous. I look forward to trying the lunch menu and the burgers.

I'm here twice a week for breakfast or lunch. I recommend the biscuits but everything is great. The key to this place is that everything is made from scratch including the sauces that come with the food. The customer service is excellent and the prices are super reasonable. The lowest prices in this area by FAR. Go to original house of pancakes your paying for every single thing A la carter.. ok I think the bastards even charge for butter and syrup separately 47 dollars for a two person meal. My cousin and I were at biscuits to burgers the other day had breakfast for 19 bucks out the door. Better quality then the competition and at a realistic price. The place is never too crowded that you don't get the proper attention from the staff and you won't be waiting outside for 30 minuets like at OHP.,_xIxrX3wWq8N_jtbWOldaA,0,1,5,0GzxbqoMULkvAyhmYo9JwA

We were in Vegas for a week of fun and found the place on a lunchtime walk along Tropicana Ave.  The ""biscuit"" part of their out-front sign encouraged us to stop in for lunch.  Wow!! Their home-made soups are to die for.  Jane had the Black Bean soup and I had the Carrot Apple Ginger soup.  We were sharing spoonsful with each other; incredibly flavorful, well seasoned and the textures were sooo homemade. Yum! And they make great Fresh Fruit Smoothies from scratch, too.  

I had the Black Bean burger (I'm not vegetarian, either).  It was magnificent.  Appropriately crisp on the outside, succulent and richly flavored on the inside.  AND, I had it served on one of their wonderful biscuits.  Jane has a Salad with Grilled Chicken. She loved it.  Lunch was a total Yum!! 

We were so impressed, we returned two days later to try other lunch menu items.  We must have talked about the Biscuits2Burgers food so much that our entire party of five returned to have a marvelous lunch there on our last day in Vegas.

Overall the food was tasty and hot.  Nothing really to complain about.  Prices are very reasonable.

The reason it's not 5 stars is because, in my opinion, a 5 star rating says there is something uniquely special about the business that makes it stand out.

You can get waffles, pancakes, or French toast paired with eggs for less than what you would pay at Denny's.  The food is not elevated, high-end cuisine by any means but for the value you're getting a great home cooked breakfast.  The biscuits were also definitely good paired with the gravy.

The reason I can't give it 4 or 5 stars is based on service.  Now typically I don't really care about service as long as it's not horrible and if I get good food. If service were better I d give it 4 stars tops.  We came on a Sun with only one other table.  The server couldn't multi-task worth sh1t and neither could the cook who was apparently working his first shift.  They were nice though I have to say.

If I lived closer I would frequent more often and may come to find that this visit was an outlier to what type of service you would expect and thus my rating would be higher.

Also, my issue is that with the name of this place, the biscuits were cold and somewhat stale and the sliders were over cooked.

Odd if you ask me. The biscuits were just ok, not bad, but ok. The home fries I was told were cooked with green peppers as well, yet when I got them they were just plain potatoes...the orange juice was the highlight of my meal. Best fresh squeezed orange juice that I've had. The cook came over and asked how my meal was (which I found to be very nice). The server was also very nice, yet when it started getting a little busy I realized he was the only waiter, and took about 15min for him to come back over after he had dropped off the check (only because I stopped him to come over.

Promptly at 8, the door opened and I was shown in.  I was told to sit anywhere.  The first thing I noticed was what a nicely decorated restaurant it was.  It was a sushi restaurant that closed which explains the large amount of bar seating and the food prep going on behind the counter.

I ordered the special of the day which was a breakfast croissant with 2 eggs cooked the way you want, two sausages or two slices of bacon--your choice--and your choice of cheese.  It also came with breakfast potatoes they called hash browns.  They're really not hash browns but they were very good potatoes.

Everything was very good.  My coffee was refilled quickly.  Angel, the server, was very pleasant!  I asked her about the Date Nights they're having and she explained and gave me a copy of the menu from their first anniversary Date Night dinner.  Normal date night dinners are $16.95 and you can call to get information about the menu and pricing.  

Angel brought a case with pastries--doughnuts, cupcakes, etc--and at first I thought she was offering a complimentary one.  When she told me the price, I then knew they weren't freebies.  It wasn't something I wanted with breakfast and since I was riding my bike, I didn't want to take any along to get damaged as I rode along.

Decided to stop by for the $3.97 Tuesday to Friday breakfast specials and between the two of us: we split and ordered the biscuits and gravy, the egg croissant with sausage sandwichand the French toast (Texas style) with bacon.
Overall the good quality was as good as breakfast foods come: the croissant was crisp, the hash browns on the side werent soggy or too salty, the eggs were definitely over and easy and the biscuits and gravy....dear lord. Forget all the biscuits and gravy that you've had in all your late night steak and egg experiences because these were the standout and a complete knockout in my opinion.. 
Which made me curious and eager to one  day try out their build your own biscuit sliders. 

Along with our waitress Tracy's sunny disposition, the classic mom and pop owned diner decor (with the classic first dollar bill received: framed), the quality (and price) of the food, the quiet hum of the morning news going off in the background and the occasional crackle of someone whipping open a fresh new newspaper to accompany their coffee---the experience was more than accommodating, satisfying and welcoming. Which in all is extremely important when choosing to dine at breakfast nooks/cafés. Why else would one spend a little more to venture out of bed and pay extra for food that you yourself can easily make your damn self? If not for the convenience, quality and atmosphere? Lol which in this case: biscuits 2 burgers definitely set the tone for a lovely tuesday morning and subsequent Tuesday afternoon.

It was an intimate experience, indeed.  There were only two employees; the server, and the cook, and we were the only guests.  

We had an omelette, a waffle, biscuits and gravy, blintzes and a 2 egg breakfast.  The food took a little while since there was only 1 guy cooking it and since it was all made fresh.  Everyone was very pleased with their food.  Absolutely no complaints.  Delicious gravy, eggs cooked perfectly, delightful ingredients in the omelette, etc.  In addition, they have an espresso machine and offer flavored lattes - this pleases me immensely.  

The prices were definitely right - all the meals were around $6 - $7.  We got one freebie with our coupon so we wound up with a bill for $37 for 4 coffees, a latte and 4 breakfasts.  Not bad at all!

Another couple came in 30 minutes after us and they got their food at the same time we did. We were sitting at the bar watching the chef frantically cooking the entire time, but did not see any food coming out. At no point did anyone come over and apologize for the wait or explain why it took so long, I'm still confused at what happened. On top of that, the waitress doubled charged me for my coffee but we were late and I was set on getting out of there at that point so I didn't even bring it up. 

About 4 tables finished up and left while we were there, none of which were fully cleared off or cleaned. When a new customer came in, the waitress would just pick a table that didn't have left over napkins and cups on it.

I will say that the homemade biscuits were very good and the meal itself was very tasty. Unfortunately due to the extremely poor service there is no way I would ever go back.",MgUmJA8IOTpqilVmmLiGWA,3,0,1,555UyrayGQ0Lng_C8SjKAQ

The outside is unappealing right now. They have not yet put up a sign, and still have the classic ""NOW OPEN"" sign still dangling right above the door. The inside is extremely clean, open, and has a nice comforting appeal. 

We were handed menus by our server without any introduction, and we ordered some drinks. When I ordered my coffee I didn't receive any sort of creamer, maybe they figured I was that sort of manly man who takes his coffee black, but I'm guessing that wasn't the case. 

I ordered the ""3 Sliders"" which were all the topped with goat cheese and sauteed onions. Each patty is 2oz and they were cooked well. I could have done without so much goat cheese. After the first slider having all that heavy cheese, you are almost dreading the next 2. It would have been nice to either get a variety of sliders, or have something added to those sliders to make them more unique and more appetizing. 

In the middle of our lunch, I was told they were closed. I guess they closed at 2:30, but online it says 3pm. We were rushed out of the restaurant, maybe it was because of the inexperience of the server, or because we were the only table there. Either way, it wasn't enjoyable to be rushed out of a lunch.

During the hour, we were the 2nd of 4 tables here.  First table had their food already before we walked in. The 3rd table didnt get their food yet and the 4th table havent even place their order. That means the kitchen took over 35mins to cook a veggie omelette and a steak and eggs plate.  

There's one cook in the kitchen and 1 waitress/hostess/cashier.  Cook seemed overwhelmed as he kept palming his forehead with his bare hand and pulling on his hair while he was cooking and checking the food tickets.  

After 50mins in the restaurant, my husband had 1 cup of coffee and left without any food and he will go without food for a few more hours due to meetings.  

The sweet potato hash, undercooked.  Slightly warm on the outside, still thawing and cold inside.  Steak had no seasoning at all, not even salt or pepper on it. Don't know about the veggie omelette since my husband didn't get to eat it, and they didn't even take it off the bill after he is clearly gone.  

Would not recommend for business breakfasts/luncheons, or if you're hungry, when there are many more breakfast options within a 5 mile radius. E.g. Rise and Shine, bite, Eggworks, Egg and I.",1y1T-gONnhnC68JlR6RNgA,4,0,1,lDDW_I93IIyrqWP3oeMRaw

There's a daily special for biscuits...today was cheddar jalapeno.
Ordered the sliders.  You choose from sausage or bacon as well as cheese and how you want your eggs cooked.  Biscuit was nice and fluffy...had a good flavor.  Eggs were cooked perfectly as requested.  
My only quibble would be the potatoes.  Think I got a less than optimal batch oas it was overly crunchy.  I like crispy but there should be a good ratio of soft potato as well.

I ended up buying a Groupon for this place a month ago right before I entered, to sadly find out they're closed on Mondays (which probably makes good business sense). Anyway, I've been eagerly waiting and plotting to come back at a perfect time and ended up here successfully, although skeptically, Saturday. It was 2:30pm and it made a big difference because there was just another family there but already eating, so we pretty much had the place to ourselves. The server Joey was very friendly and hospitable (which in some places is sadly a dying art). He was also very helpful w/the menu and even through in a little extra on my pumpkin pancake, w/turkey bacon. The bacon wasn't overly salty and didn't taste like cardboard and the pancake was the best I've had of that sort. Just enough crisp on the edges to contrast the soft fluffiness on the inside. My wife had the turkey burger w/pepper jack on a brioche bun (recommended by Joey) and what delicious suggestion it was. It complimented the patty so well, which surpringly wasn't dry because it was ""turkey"". My wife let me take a bite and man was it flavorful! I had to turn to the server as soon as I saw him again to let him know how good the food was and I truly only speak my mind like that when my tongue is happy (not just to get more ""little extras""). The sweet potatoes fries stayed crispy, which is rare and somehow not overly sweet, the best I've had so far. My son had the burger slider w/regular fries and it was good also.

Coffee

Cheddar and Black Pepper Biscuits

Located just down the street from Ace Donuts, locally owned and operated Biscuits 2 Burgers had been on my breakfast to-do list for a while and although mixed reviews warned of a hit n' miss experience the proximity simply could not be ignored - an 8:15am arrival finding only one two-top filled as the staff-to-patron ratio swelled in my presence to 3:3, not a single other patron present during the rest of my hour long stay.

Featuring two chefs and one server, the later a young man who was friendly and mostly efficient in keeping water and coffee full, Biscuits 2 Burgers features a concise menu of breakfast as well as lunch staples and with everything but the outsourced pastries made in house a three-part order was assembled in a room featuring several medals and awards for various events alongside seasonal décor plus a television playing just a bit too loud.

Watching the chefs operated in a wide-open kitchen while perusing one of the free local rags it was just under twenty minutes before my order arrived and setting aside ice-cold butter, HFCS-Jam, and pseudo-syrup in favor of items brought from home the meal began with flimsy French Toast alongside crispy bacon - the former sliced so thin one would be hard pressed to know it was Challah as opposed to the also-offered Texas Toast while the later was rather par for the course, the $6.95 charge less than most places but still seemingly excessive for the quality or portions served.

Moving next to the namesake biscuits - offered as sliders, with gravy, or individually at $1.50 each - two of the daily cheddar and black pepper inspirations were selected and with the drop-style rounds as dense and toothsome as one would expect both the cheese and spice were quite restrained, the addition of honey helping to make the flavors pop, though certainly not to the degree of those famous versions served up at America's most well known seafood chain.

Wrapping things up with an unlikely selection made mostly because the menu's pancake options seemed genuinely uninspired, it was to a trio of tightly wound blintzes that I was treated and served over what was probably canned blueberry compote the lightly bronzed pockets proved superlative, each creamy bite making me wonder why so few breakfast places offer such things...and why anyone would pay nearly twice as much for the ones at Carnegie Deli on the Strip.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,8,4,2,CcITR9mVT-WUpJvJZnnYCA

We walked in, it looks so great inside! We get seated really fast seeing as how we are the 2nd group in the entire restaurant. We sit down and order our drinks. My brother and husband ordered coffee, I got an iced tea and my sister in law got a soda. The tea was rotten, always something I fear when ordering tea, but shouldn't have to in a place like this, so I thought. It must've been sitting for a little bit. Apparently Vegas people don't drink tea. 

No biggie, we go to order our breakfast. I got the eggs and bacon but needed to get a biscuit on the side to try it. With biscuits in the name, you have to try it right? All they had was jalapeno cheddar biscuits. What?? I appreciate stepping outside the box and trying more than just the standard biscuit but I can't stand jalapenos so I didn't get one. My brother and husband got them though and they said they were good, not so overwhelming on the jalapenos. The rest of the food was good but I was bummed that the one thing I wanted to try I couldn't. 

The owner I'm assuming, came by and talked with us later and asked how we liked the food. The guys answered that everything was great. He said they make the biscuits fresh and don't let them sit for long so we just made the cutoff to get the ones they had. That's great, but I wish they would've had at least just a plain option for those of us who can't handle the extreme flavors. 

I don't know if I'd go back again, because of the lack of food choices as well as the lack of service from our waitress. She seemed like she was from Philly, really nice girl but just didn't care. There was literally a point when the only other couple there left, we were alone. We turned around and we were literally alone. Noone was in the kitchen, noone at the front. Kind of weird. I ran out of my nasty tea and never got to get a water refill. 

Maybe later on down the road when they get the kinks out it will be better? I mean, growing up in Vegas I know the customer service is rather lacking but...",Bi7-tuvUvhwjl6x8q0jL9w,5,1,2,RWuiycFoR_-nDSK1-tKdyQ
