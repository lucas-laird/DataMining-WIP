For dinner my wife had the Chilean sea bass and I the Pollo Fontina. Approximately an hour after eating, my wife began to feel ill. For the next twelve hours she was violently ill (vomiting/severe diarrhea). So ill, that she unable to board her plane home. I spoke with the restuarant manager, Fabio Russo, and explained what had occurred. I explained that we incurred a $400 charge from the airline because we had to reschedule the flight due to the food poisoning. He not only refused to do anything but attempted to have me escorted out of the Restuarant by hotel security.   Don't risk getting sick! Go somewhere else.

The walls in the ladies room were dirty and not sure why the lion head fountain has such a looooong tube coming out of his mouth....looked like a cheap fast fix.
I was grossed out by the fact that the older lady manager kept licking her fingers to go through order slips. I don't want to see any food service worker doing that on the dining floor.
Food: appetizer order was wrong twice, red sauce on the gnocchi literally tasted like a tin can ,lobster was rubbery and without taste. I ordered a well done steak and it was pink throughout. I cut it up and had a few bites and spit a bit onto the plate. When the waiter asked how it was I asked him if it looked well done to him....he said not at all. Then, he asked me if I wanted the chef to put it back on the grill.....that disgusted me. To think they would put food onto the grill that had been bitten into. I had lost my appetite at this point and refused anymore food. 
Suffice to say, don't bother with this place.",rMBFxCGy7SRUo9nSUT8OCg,0,0,1,KcVsjCFHT1X9a8cxIQNWjg

60348,2009-04-25,2,qtc1YZix_5lHBJTZq7DOpA,"My friends and I took a short trip to vegas for the food and entertainment.  We visited several restaurants with either famous chefs or great reviews, and for some reason (cannot remember who recommended it) we also went to Zeffirino one night for dinner.

I arrived slightly early than everyone else and was ignored by the maitre'd as I stood in front of her, instead she walked to a small group of people eyeing the restaurant as they walk through the grand canal shops and started talking to them.  Eventually (after maybe 10-15 mins) I decided to enter on my own and sat down at the bar for a drink.  The maitre'd did not become more effective after my friend arrived and our group of 7 (or 8, i can't remember) was sat at a 5 men booth while there being only two other occupied table in the whole restaurant.  We mentioned the seat being ""too cozy"" and was not acknowledged.

After most of our drinks were served it took another 8 requests for my friend's ""hot water"" to reach the table for her tea bag.  Meanwhile, we realized that the menu was rather limited with plain pasta+marinara sauce being around $20.  The disaster is just about to begin...  as a group, we ordered 6 appetizers, 3 salads, and 6 entrees to share, but it was obvious that the staff at the restaurant felt that we were cheap for not ordering enough and their attitude was absolutely horrible.  First it was the over-cooked duck that the manager insist is done medium rare,

Manager,  ""We DO NOT, and WILL NOT EVER serve duck cooked more than medium rare.""
Us, ""So how would you call this? (showing him the meat)""
Manager, ""That is definitely more than well-done!""
Us, ""and we asked for MEDIUM RARE""
Manager, ""But We DO NOT, and WILL NOT EVER serve duck cooked more than medium rare""
Us, ""Er...............""

Aside from the tea/hot-water problem, and the duck-problem, we seem unable to get the wait staff to provide us with the correct number of utensils throughout the whole meal.  Although they were not busy at all, with only two other tables being occupied in the restaurant, they had extreme difficulties being us 7 but not 4 forks and 7 but not 5 knifes.  The service was simply offensive.

All in all, it was a horrible experience, not a single dish was memorable.  The steak was average, all the pastas were at diner level (even Olive Garden makes better stuff), the salads were nothing more than what you can get at a college dinning hall and the appetizers were so not interesting I can't recall a single thing about them.

Don't go!!!!!",B3I2gWtcgqOW4gW4KGQurw,10,1,1,MOhXX2umG_JWCApBz7Pe6A

The pizza dough did not taste like it was made from pizza flower. it actually tasted as it was a biscuit dough.  this is not authentic italian as they stated and the ingredient was not fresh or tasty.  however the food was plentiful and the service was good. The dough at Five 50 in the Aria tasted much better and you can actually taste the dough.  i confronted the manager but she said she did not know what Yelp is and she stated that the fresh dough was made downstairs meaning not on the premises. if this was authentic italian then why the dough for the pizza is not made from scratch. i rather eat in a fast food rather then waste my time or money on this place. avoid it.,qapGn_raPzUkgd8glQyrBQ,0,0,1,Djcklhrs2fKaZPlCmzcwLw
129765,2014-01-07,0,qtc1YZix_5lHBJTZq7DOpA,"My husband and I came here for Christmas dinner because we had no idea where to dine on Christmas night; he wanted italian food, and I kinda missed the lasagna I had here years ago. So we came for dinner on Christmas night. We didn't order much because we are not the type that can eat multiple course meal without leftover (and we don't want to have leftover during our trip). So I ordered a lasagna and he ordered a veal ravioli. 
The lasagna was as good as it was years ago, I am pleased. My husband's veal ravioli was good too but a bit too sweet for him. I tasted it too and the filling was a bit sweet (not sugary sweet, I think it's certain seasoning and the veal meat giving the sweet taste). They also have a violinist and a guitar player playing Christmas music from table to table all night long. So the ambiance was good. Some servers had a stern face though, and they dressed in suits, they looked so stern as if they were government agents. Well, they don't look rude, just don't know why they are so stern.......
All we wanted there was their pasta as they made their own. And we are happy that we ordered the pasta and not the $39 4-course meal. But it's just us. You might like to have 4 course meal instead if you need to have salad and appetizer for your meal. 
For ladies, make sure you visit their restroom too. It's well decorated. And each stall has its own sink inside, so once you are in a stall, you can take your time to freshen up with comfort and your own space. I asked my husband and he said there is not much going on in male's restroom. So I guess they only did the fancy design for the ladies' room.",gm8nNoA3uB4In5o_Hxpq3g,1,0,4,ez_I6h3SGzxfZ4elAUwoFw

I could tell the staff hated working for Mussolini's granddaughter because I couldn't help but overhear the staff complaining about the old bag through our whole meat, so the trains don't run on time if you get my drift. My wife was ordering a ham and cheese croissant and was told the price was 4.75. At the cash register it was 8.75. The girls behind the counter said that they don't really know the price until they ring it up. The menu listed it as 6.75.

141470,2012-02-17,0,qtc1YZix_5lHBJTZq7DOpA,"The people who complain about the ""slow service"" here are nuts. Who goes to Zefferino's for quick service? If you want fast service, go to IHOP or some non-descript food court. Zefferino's is about the atmosphere (excellent) and the food and wine (excellent). If you go here with someone whose company you don't enjoy, I can see why fast service would be important. 

The food is superb with very large portions (almost too big, really...I totally overindulged). For the quality, it is not overpriced. There's table music. The violinist and guitarist were outstanding, adding *even* more beauty to the ambience. We have been to Venice. I know The Venetian is just a big film set with an amazing sky, but this restaurant took us back to Venice. 

The wait staff were outstanding. Never intrusive, but friendly and helpful. Extremely professional. 

This is a great place to go, whether for a date night, special occasion, or an outing with a group of friends. We went with guests from the UK, and they loved it. 

I don't give out 5 stars lightly, but I cannot think of a single reason to knock a star off. Zefferino's is an outstanding and unique fine dining establishment. I'm looking forward to sharing it with friends again soon. 

Go to Zefferino's...it's the Italian shiz! :)

I am NOT a ""foodie"" and, as such, am rarely disappointed with a meal; however, this was an unexpected exception.  Perched overlooking the grand canal, Zeffirino has so much potential to be a pleasantly memorable experience.  Unfortunately for a place that will run you at least $150 for two people, the food is shockingly bad.  My wife had the half lobster and seafood entree the waiter exuberantly recommended and I went for their dinner set.  In both cases presentation was acceptable but certainly poorer than you would expect.  The food itself, unfortunately, was about what you would expect from a low budget casino buffet....dried-out and seemingly more than a day old.  Maybe we just caught them at a bad time (7pm on a Sunday) but you just really don't expect a place like this to have days this bad.  I am not sure how they stay in business, but have to assume it's only because, like me, the unique location makes many people willing to ignore the bad food reviews.

Had the caeser salad to start,not much flavor in the dressing...and was more crouton than salad.Ordered a chicken breast with a cream sauce,small portion and no flavor in the sauce or the chicken.Portion was small and came with nothing.Had a very basic dinner for 2 with only a single cocktail ordered and it was nearly $100 (with tip) for a very average meal.

499312,2016-05-22,0,qtc1YZix_5lHBJTZq7DOpA,Zeffirino is a quaint Italian get-a-way with many tables having a view of the beautiful Grand Canal at the Venetian. I frequent often to take advantage of their Grand Canal Lunch Menu and bring guests when they are in town for a conference at the Sands Convention Center. I highly recommend going for the soup option as I find it allows me to have a greater appreciation for the Chef over a salad option. The menu has a good variety including fish or even eggplant making it viable to bring vegetarians. All the pasta and sauce are exceptionally fresh tasting; very pleasant dining experience.,pAA-fut56sosUiWRNtnvYw,1,0,4,1snXwf8PBvVqQDra4Rv17w

The appetizer (and plates) were never cleared. Our wine glasses sat empty for over 20 minutes. I looked around for nearly 30 minutes for someone to bring some water after the appetizers were served, but no one ever stopped back at the table. The scant remains of the appetizer were never cleared before dinner. The server brought a spoon for the main course pasta and knife for veal, but he did not remove any of the clutter on the table nor did he offer another glass of wine as our glasses were empty. I finally went and asked for a manager. He cleared the clutter himself, was very nice and apologized.

I believe the issue was there were so many ""levels"" of servers - one for water, one for bread, another to clear the tables, main server, etc - that no one wanted to do more than their job description. The main server should have noticed the lack of attention to the table by his lower staff and either done the job himself or jumped all over the other staff (whom he tips out) to do their jobs. 

I complained to a manager, but at that point we really just wanted to leave, not get another glass of wine. There are too many incredible competing restaurants (Carmine's is now open in Las Vegas, for example) for this level of service (at these prices) to be allowed.

But my real love for Zefferino's stems from the fact that they have superb food. I'm fairly certain that I've never been served a single thing that I didn't absolutely love. Okay, that's not true, there was this one petit four that was kinda wonky, but other than that everything has always been stellar, from the pasta, to the desserts, to the wines.

Then we tried ordering Stella not available as well and it seemed like every drink we tried to order was not available no pineapple juice for a Mai tai no ginger ale for my Jameson nothing. And they didn't even bother to give us a drink on the house they just said sorry we don't have any of that. The food was okay but the service was horrible.

I can only speak for myself - out of a table of seven, but Im sure you'll find similar comments from those that ate there with me.
The antipasta was Ok - Throw on a few olives, add a touch of ham and Mozzerrella for authenticity, and wait for it - here is a top tip in order for you to charge tripple what the average Joe restaurant would charge - serve it on a silver platter.
For the main course i waited in anticipation of Linguine Gamberi....I wish I had continued to wait. Insipid, tasteless, and overpriced - twenty seven bucks to boil some pasta and reheat a watery tomato sauce.

It was just the 2 of us and we ran across this place while wandering around the canal shops at the Venetian around noon. We asked to take a look inside prior to making a dinner reservation and fell in love with the atmosphere upstairs. We made a reservation and requested a table overlooking the canal but they could not guarantee it. We came back at 6. 

We checked in and made our way upstairs. The anticipation for a canal side table was giving me butterflies as they led us to our table......TA DA sitting on the railing upstairs overlooking the canal. 

Now the important part - Time to deliver. Our waiter was Ben (assisted by 3 others) he helped pick out a nice wine (my requirements were Italian Red, bold, unique and under $100) He consulted with 2 others and they came back with a very nice Sangiovanese(?) reserve for $75. It was deelish! 
We went with the calamari appetizer - very good. 

Did I mention we were overlooking the canal. It was soooo romantic. We have been married 23 years and both loved the setting, the sounds of the singers drifting up, the view.......Very special. 

The service was attentive and prompt. Our waiter asked us our likes and dislikes and made suggestions and we went with it. 

My wife had the Sea Bass and I had a seafood pasta dish. The presentation of each meal was great. The sea bass arrived on a plate with half a lobster (in shell) tucked behind it. We did not know this when ordering and thought they brought out the wrong dish but there was the sea bass sitting in front under a topping of thinly sliced leeks. My dish was a split lobster (in shell) with a pile of linguine noodles in the middle, topped with scallop, shrimp,clams, mussels and other goodies. (see photos on my profile). 

No dessert, too full. 

Everything was great. I sum it up this way - Would I go back? YES!

Why weren't we assigned to those unoccupied tables?  Couple of the hostess assistants looked Asian to me, was it discrimination because we were fellow Asians?  Or because we had kids in our party?

Was a little disappointed their was no oil and vinegar for the bread (or even butter).  When we asked the lady for some oil and vinegar, she didn't say anything or even smile when we asked.  Once the food came out it looked great.  Was tasty; nothing too special about it though; could tell they used basic cheap sauce (shrimp Risotto).  Over all the food was good.  When the bottle of wine was brought, out he poured about 4 drips in the glass.  Not even close to enough even tell if it's ok or not; also didn't offer the cork to look at.   Once he poured the wine he put way too much in. Very disappointing seeing they don't even know how to pour wine.  Also about an hour after we ate, all three of us got sick.

I would say this is a 3 and a half star place.

That said, my boss and I were in Vegas for a meeting and came across this place while strolling along The Grand Canal.  As expected in Vegas this restaurant is huge, and when we were there, virtually empty.  However, at our request to have a table along the canal, the hostess said, ""Let me check with that section to see if we have room"".  That irritated me, especially after she returned 5 minutes later said it was okay if we sat on the canal, and when we got to our table, the room was about 1/4 full.  It was an unnecessary pretentious touch, IMO.  

But things got much better!  The friendly Sommelier came over and we ordered a nice CA Cabernet (I know...should have gone Italian but the boss had a favorite wine, and I can never complain about Napa Cabs).  The Sommelier was very very knowledgeable about terroir, so we had an interesting conversation with him.  He was enthusiastic, and clearly passionate about his work.  

The food was great, also.  We had a lovely Salumi plate, with cold cuts, cheese and black olives.  If  you don't want quite that much, the bread (OMG that Italian bread!) comes with little skewers of salami, cheese and olives, so that would have been fine.

The menu is full of standard Italian fare, lots of variety.  I wanted to order something that stood up to the very bold wine, and the Veal Scallopine did the trick.  It was a very rich mushroom sauce, with roasted tomatoes, served atop a mound of homemade fettuccine.  My boss had the beef tenderloin, that came swimming (in a good way) in a a sauce of red wine, grapes and pine nuts.  It was also served with a side of pasta.  The portions here are HUGE.  

This place is pricey, but it is fine dining.

We waddled out without dessert, and this meal sustained me through a long night at the casino, into mid day the next day.  So, don't get me wrong.  I DO recommend this place.  There are just too many restaurants, and too little time!

The atmosphere is beautiful.  The detail that went into the design is incredible.  I heard that the 40 foot tall, handcrafted bar was imported from Italy, and I have no reason not to believe it.",GNBKXDHQoxJLx9J6Rh8W4A,0,1,3,coF8y2o9Mpnn-u6xjWy0ww

Passing through the Palazzo, we were directed to the restaurant by a woman who appeared to be from the House of Medici - a surreal tableau common for Vegas, but exciting to the giddy hillbilly in me nonetheless.  

As with most things in Vegas these days, the place was empty, so we got catbird seat overlooking the perpetual dusk of the Venetian shopping mall, complete with singing gondoliers in the background.  It reminded me of the pleasant escape of that restaurant inside Pirates of the Caribbean: a calming respite from the noisy crowds just a few feet away.   The decor inside enhanced the elegant feel, with rich antique furniture and fixtures.  During the meal, musicians wandered from table to table, keeping us entertained.

I opted for the prix fixe dinner menu for $40, which opened with a so-so crusty bread and pleasant olive tapenade, followed by an okay plate of fried calimari, nicely flavored and textured ravioli, and an decent Chicken Marsala.  Dessert was a bit of a letdown, consisting of three bite-sized (for a very small-jawed creature, perhaps a diminutive early hominid, which, despite appearances,  I am not) and forgettable cakes.  I'm sure they would have been nicer than the petit fours in a Hickory Farms Christmas gift box, but I couldn't get a good taste of the damned things, they were so small.

I've breezed over the meal by design - the star of this place is the setting.  The only flaw in the movie set was a hole in the napkin.

Service was very good, with very little wait between courses.  Being part of the 5:00 pm senior citizen crowd, they waitstaff knew we were there to eat and were not going to keep us from the Murder She Wrote marathon starting at 6pm.

1309530,2017-07-14,2,qtc1YZix_5lHBJTZq7DOpA,"Wow, what a wonderful discovery here amongst the celebrity chef saturated restaurants!  After dinner the night before at a nearby Italian restaurant, my husband was disappointed with his meal and wanted a do over.  So we set off in search of a nice restaurant for lunch in the canal shops area and spotted the top level of Zeffrinos overlooking the plaza activity.  Only problem was we couldn't figure out how to get there.  We asked the security guard outside the hotel elevators who gave directions, but we made a wrong turn, so I came up with the bright idea of calling the restaurant.  And what do you know, the hostess answered and gave us even more specific directions!  (Across from Banana Republic.)

It was lunch time and a bit quiet, but not a problem for us or them.  Service was at its best!  Hostess asked if we prefer to take the elevator or stairs to the upper level.  We opted for stairs and she sat us at one of those tables overlooking the plaza/canal activity.  The servers were dressed impeccably, and I think I even detected Italian accents.  Fine linens, dishes/glasses, and silverware galore.  We started with drinks (wine and a martini) and shared the Carpaccio dI Manzo alla Piemontes.  It was the first time I had carpaccio and at first I wasn't sure if it was my thing, but each bite got better and better.  I loved the fresh Parmesan and capers.  So yes, it is definitely now my thing!  For my entree, I had the Zupetta del Doge di Venezia (sautéed lobster, shrimp, scallop, crab meat, asparagus, white wine, and a touch of tomato sauce).  I ordered it because I enjoy seafood and underneath the description on the menu, it said ""Best Dish Ever - New York Times.""  No year listed, I guess because it's the best dish EVER, and I have to say I'm not going to argue about it.  It was pretty spectacular!  I devoured it and used that wonderful bread from the bread basket to sop up the broth (a dining tip from our server).  My husband was pleased to see they serve fresh pasta, and for his entree, he ordered the Penne alla Ciociaria (tossed with mushrooms, peas, spinach and Parmesan sauce).  I sampled it, and it was yummy, but I preferred my entree because it's the best dish EVER!  After cleaning our plates, we ordered dessert more out of curiosity than necessity because we were full.  I wanted something light and ordered berries and cream.  My husband went with Affogato al Whiskey and said it was very good.  We enjoyed our dining experience here so much that we wanted to return the next day, but they were not yet open and we had to hit the road.  So we are left with that feeling of wanting more!  

In addition to the amazing food, I would be remisce if I did not mention the beautiful interior of the restaurant.  It does feel as though you have stepped into an Italian villa.  Pavarotti is even present to greet you on the second level!  Highly recommend!",0CVrD89fxmo51DpzPsC6rA,4,4,5,DeofiW9BHf-zwAuHAtV30g

I love porcini mushrooms, so when we saw the Lasagna with redporcini's we decided to give it a try.  They explained that it was not a traditional lasagna, but what they brought to the table was lasagna like noodles with plenty of redporcini's, but it had no porcini aroma nor taste.  Maybe a RED porcini is like their lasagna and not a real porcini?  $30 for lasagna noodles and mushrooms and that is it.  Seriously, just an awful dish of nothing.  My date ordered off the menu to get pesto with spaghetti, but it was underwhelming in every way.

That was spectacular, and it was the whole reason that I took my boyfriend here again a year and a half later.

When we came in last summer (on my second visit), service was just as excellent as I remembered, and everything else was too.  I ordered the same dish and was completely happily.  I can't say the same for my boyfriend, unfortunately.  He chose some sort of pasta dish, even though he wanted to order the same thing I ordered.

Had an interview in the Venetian and wanted to find a quiet place to do some work and eat a nice lunch beforehand, and was immediately drawn to their $19.95 three-course lunch special that served vegetarian dishes. I was intrigued, and I went in to enjoy a pricey lunch. 

Pricey, but worth it most definitely. I was taken to the second floor and sat myself in a more well-lit corner. The decor was so pretty and very classy but still had a comfortable quality to it. 

I had some of the best service I have ever received from a restaurant here. They weren't particularly busy, but even after I paid my check they kept coming back to ask if I wanted fresh hot water for my tea. Superb service where I did not have to ask for anything, and they actually went above and beyond. 

For my first course I had the soup of the day, which was a vegan lentil soup. It was a sizable portion and was very good, and I scarfed it down more quickly than intended. 

My second course I savored every little bite. I ordered cheese ravioli in a fettuccine sauce with truffle oil. The truffle oil in this dish really took it over the top, in a good way. The mix of cheesy flavors with that hint of truffle oil is absolutely divine. It's not a huge dish, but it does satiate you well enough. 

The final course I had hot organic mint tea with three little pastries. I don't know what they were really but they were like little bites of heaven! One was a tiny nut brownie, the other was some sort of soft, chocolate ball of deliciousness, and the last one was a cup of maybe custard with a strawberry on top with strawberry sauce on the plate. SO good. 

The service, the ambiance, the food, even the bathrooms - all swanky and amazing. (Seriously, they have mouthwash in the bathrooms with your own personal sink and vanity. Way cool!) When I get a job I will definitely be back here. This is a lunch you don't plow through even though they do pace it very nicely.

The restaurant is rather ""snazzy"" and  can be perceived by the casual observer  as too expensive for the general casino patrons that frequent the passage ways of the casinos to window shop and gamble.  However, surprisingly the price was average of what is expected to that of any other Italian restaurant anywhere away from the strip.  Pleasantly surprised Zeffirino has a happy hour that is again like that of any standard restaurant with an average of $2-3 off on particular wines and cocktails.  I ordered the mussel and clam combination in white wine sauce as an appetizer and Chicken Marsala as an entree.  The  food was balanced, fresh, and appropriately portioned.  The mussels and clams were delightful and plentiful.  The Chicken Marsala was extremely light in sauce and intended in such a way to delicately enhance the well prepared breast of chicken.  We opted to dine at the bar versus the lavishly ornate and ""fine dining"" themed restaurant on the second floor.  You can say we were both intimidated and trying to eat in the ""cheap"" for lunch on the Las Vegas strip.  The bartender which served us was genuine and personal.  In the bar area is a pianist that plays intermittently throughout the day, which is was very nice but acoustically overwhelming at times.  While I hardly mention restrooms in my reviews, I have to mention the ladies' restroom was exceptionally ornate like the restaurant and flawlessly clean.  Each stall has its own vanity with all the accouterments to freshen oneself.  I did notice that I was not the only one to take notice of the uniqueness of the restrooms as I noticed an award dated in 2008 or 2009  for the ""Best Restrooms in Las Vegas"".  Interestingly enough, there is a lot of history involving the establishment of Zeffirino that is captured upstairs outside the dinning area.  May I add there is easy accessibility to the dining area for anyone that requires an elevator.

Plates and silver were cleared and reset in a very organized manner and we did not even opt for the prefix dinner; we shared and enjoyed an antipasti and two delectable entrées. I appreciated the attention when it was needed from our server and the respect for our privacy when we wished to enjoy the romantic view to ourselves and delight in our courses without bother. Our waiter was a mature gentlemen who understood timing and service perfectly. He was a delightful host and made us feel welcomed and at ease. I never once felt interrupted by the service and that is really hard to come by. It was quintessentially italian because of the relaxed and slow environment. Dinner was quite extravagant. The sauces cooked to perfection. And being in the company of my love made it even more magical and dreamy. It was wildly romantic and kind of divine but that may have all been owed less to the restaurant and more to the fact that I was deeply lovestruck.  P.S.

The food, ambiance and personality of the staff made this a great experience.  This restaurant is ideal for everything from romantic dinners to large business functions.  The restaurant is very large but the design offers intimacy to each diner.

I had set out with the fam in search of steak and seafood...a little surf and turf if you will...and they all wanted Italian.  Well, somehow we ended up at Zeffirino because my honey said he saw ""filet medallions"" on the menu...

SOOOOOO not sad that we stumbled inside!  

First of all, the decor is fantastic...a virtual maze will lead you upstairs to a sort of Moroccan feel of a room...complete with open windows yielding views of the painted sky outside.  You really do feel as if you are somewhere in Italy and not in a casino...

The staff are all Italian...that's a plus!  And the food...THE FOOD...Holy Hell.  I had a special of filet medallions (three...and perfectly cooked...slightly crunchy on the outside and perfect pink inside!) in a fondue type sauce, topped with a light pomegranate sauce and coupled with green beans and the most delightful, crispy little potatoes. My honey had some sort of pasta tube stuffed with something and covered in a Beschamel sauce and topped with BLACK TRUFFLES!!  Yummmmm.  The sea bass in lemon sauce looked divine...

As for the desserts...you won't be remiss with the hazelnut gelato, the tiramisu (which is served in a martini glass) or the white/milk/dark chocolate mousse.  So incredibly scrumptious and all the portions were just enough to fill you without making you ill.

Can't tell you the overall cost as we were treated by a family member...I can tell you that my entree alone was $44 so it's not on the cheaper side by any means.  But seriously, it was worth the cost!

And best part, this man and his son come around and serenade you with violins...lovely!!

If I had one critique it would be that there weren't enough traditional breakfast items. 90% of all the food in the brunch was more lunch themed.

Wine selection is huge.
Steak?  Great - order it rare.  Accompanied by a bottle of Jordan Cabernet:  HEAVEN ON EARTH.
Most of the pastas, but not all - very, very good.
Seafood entrees - - some are hugely impressive, but admittedly a bit inconsistent. 

I've been here 4 times total now, 2 times on the same visit a couple of years ago.  Those two times were amazing, knock your socks off GOOD.  The latter two times have been a bit ""off"" once (hence, I knock off one star just for the inconsistency), and then amazing again the last time.  Hmm.

Ambience is nice here as it overlooks the Grand Canal Shoppes.  Lighting is nice, and if you don't sit on the balcony area - - a nice, private booth is also very cool here.  Dining for two, all the way to dining for 50 can be accomodated here - - it's a large restaurant, much larger than it appears!! 

Service has ALWAYS been excellent in true Vegas style.  They charge you an arm and a leg, so I expect nothing less, but it is nice to be treated like royalty!

I don't even have to order here.
Just hearing we have reservations to this place conjures up images of fresh oysters on ice for me..... I could eat these oysters by the ton.  

I kid you not.

But - I shall try it again on my next visit just to be sure what is happening here.  There was a time I'd have given Zeffy's a strong, strong 5-stars.... but that one mediocre time still remains in my mind.  Fluke?  Off-night?  It can happen... but not twice.

Tease:   Zeffirino is a kind of classic Italian restaurant in the Heart of the Venetian.

Why I went:  My wife and I enjoyed a few cocktails from there the evening before, and noticed some reasonable menu items that we thought we'd check out for lunch.

When:  11/19/12

Food:  Between the 2 of us, we had a nice Carpaccio appetizer, a 6"" personal pizza that was super tasty, and eggplant parm (which was also quite good).  We also had a nice dessert of various small tarts.  They also had a nice wine special at $5/glass for lunch.  Overall, the food was all very tasty.  The portions were perfect for lunch.

Service:  Service was very good.

Hints/Final thoughts:  This is a nice Italian place that is both low-key and upscale.  Deals can be had for lunch and some dinner specials.  But, prices overall were not ridiculous.  We made many return trips to their bar throughout our stay as we stayed at the Palazzo.  With every bartender, they were great!

From the moment you walk in, it's classic Italian in every sense. Beautiful decor, dark wood, great Italian music, beautiful seafood displayed at the bar and REAL Italians speaking Italian. 

We make our way upstairs where the dining room is and were sat promptly. Everyone was so nice and inviting. AND did I say all Italian? No kidding! There were 3 guys playing music table side which was a nice touch but I never know if I should look at them or what. It's kind of weird. 

Anyway, on to the dinner- I opted for a special dinner they had for $44 (I think this is a new thing since our economy is in the $#@^*(! ). It included an appetizer or salad or soup, entree, dessert and coffee. Not bad! I got the Caesar salad, heavy on the anchovy paste please. Love it! Hubby and I split the calamari and zucchini. Perfectly crisp, not greasy. A cocktail sauce and a creamy sauce were served with it. Perfect compliment. 

For entree I had the fotina cheese ravioli in a vodka sauce. Perfection! The pasta and sauces are made fresh and it's evident in every bite. Hubby got the veal. Juicy, crispy, just perfection! For dessert they gave me a plate of little baby cakes/pies. It was great to have a nibble of something sweet, anything more and I would have been in a food coma. 

The bathrooms have your VERY OWN SINK inside the stall and mouthwash. They thought of everything! I highly recommend this place if you win a jackpot or have a corporate dinner or you are really rich.

Who would want to? We got up to leave and he stopped us and forced us to pay for a bottle of water and glass of wine that we didn't get to drink because we had no meal for it to go with. Seriously?

We came at about 4 pm, which meant they were not very busy, allowing us a seat right next to the balcony, where we could look at the canal below, people watch, and listen to the gondola singers. The atmosphere of the restaurant was very casual, quiet, and kind of like a small Italian restaurant would look, although this place is pretty damn big. 
Service was spectacular from start to finish. Our server was very polite, very attentive, and took great care of every part of this meal. Had to laugh when he poured my girlfriend's beer, then told me he would allow me to have the pleasure of pouring my own... which I did.
The food... fantastic. The free bread they give you during the meal was DELICIOUS, and that was the free bread! Salads- great. The pasta- unbelievable. The lasagna- out of this world. There seemed to be an awful lot of choices on the menu I would've gone with, a lot seemed to be very complicated with many ingredients and combinations, and I'm glad I decided to keep it simple.
Overall, very pleased with this place. The service was top notch, I felt like royalty dining here. The food was absolutely delicious, and I left absolutely fat and happy. Only thing keeping it from five stars- no beer on tap (they have some downstairs in the waiting room?), and it can be a bit pricey depending on what you order.

2206295,2010-09-07,1,qtc1YZix_5lHBJTZq7DOpA,"This is a review of their lunch prix fixe menu.

The Skinny: small serving sizes, unappetizing entrees - I've had better chicken parm out of the frozen food aisle (2) service - subpar - I have to ding them for not disclosing the additional cost of soda refills (2) value - 2 small glasses (@ maybe 1/4 a can at most per serving) of diet pepsi $6, plus poor entrees for $20 = (1).

We came here for lunch as we were perusing the uber-expensive shops at the Venetian and Palazzo. Overlooking the faux St.Marks, the decor in this restaurant is wonderful. Love the mosaics, the luxurious bathroom, and the tapestries on the wall. If only the food and service could live up to the ambience.

The bread service was okay - some pieces were dried out from being pre-cut for too long. The bread was served cold and with pads of butter which is an odd pairing considering you're at an Italian restaurant (balsamic and oil, please!)

My hubby and I ordered the caesar salad, the mixed fried calamari and zucchini, the chicken parm with linguine and the cheese ravioli alfredo with truffle oil.

When the waiter wheeled out our food covered in cheap stainless steel domes from room service, I knew we were in trouble.

The lettuce in the caesar was wilted from sitting in the dressing for too long. It was too mayonaise-y and loaded with stale croutons. My husbands fried calamari and zucchini was not much better - greasy, soggy with a poor batter.

I was surprised at how bad my chicken parmigiana was. The batter was not crispy at all while the breast meat was dry. I'm serious - I've had frozen chicken parm that was better. The linguine was okay but too heavy on the marinara.

Cheese ravioli was poor - the layer being too thick and the ricotta totally one note. It's very similar to the fresh pasta you can get from the supermarket. The pasta was swimming in the alfredo sauce which was okay but not fantastic (even with the truffle oil). Serving size is very small considering the cost of the entree (see the pics - four supermarket sized ravioli).

Dessert was served - a strawberry mousse with some sort of ?pistachio cake, a chocolate brownie, and a small fruit tart. None of these items are worth a return visit for.

Finally, a word of warning. I ordered a Diet Pepsi along with my lunch. Later on in the meal, the waiter asked if I wanted a refill. Seeing as how my glass totally filled with ice and would contain maybe 50 cc. of soda, I agreed. He did not disclose that the refill would cost an additional $3, plus the soda did not arrive until dessert (he asked if I wanted a refill with the starters).

So due to the service issues and the lackluster level of cuisine, this place gets a 2 star rating.",h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q,3,2,2,Fj_gJe0i8ApTdyWH7qeUgQ

The place is huge and the ambiance is warm, bathrooms are amazing actually, probably the best part of the place!

I figured that our big party had already paid the staff because the service was not quite so fun. Snappy, unfriendly, unsmiling waiters took our orders mere seconds after we sat down. Snatched menus from under our noses, and then stood around staring at us as the big party came to a finish...when we went to the bathroom they started separating out our tables to let us know they wanted us to go. There were a few rockstars in the waiters who were helpful, but the rest...not so much.

Food wise, I can't believe that this place survives in the Venetian with so many other absolutely amazing places around it. It's not like they charge less for okay food. 

The one good thing was the ravioli, which i'd expect out of an Italian place, but everything else was a little too salty and dry. However, was surprised that my seabass was not overcooked, so props on that since fish can be hard to get just right. Unfortunately, mini-desserts were not even worth the time or calories.

The tab wasn't mine though, so I don't look a food gift-horse in the mouth, and the company was worth all the negatives, but I would have easily paid for a better meal elsewhere. Ahh well!

2417331,2013-11-13,0,qtc1YZix_5lHBJTZq7DOpA,"One of the best parts of the Zeffirino experience is opening up their dessert menu and seeing a picture of Nicolas Cage looking back at you. Since it is well documented that Cage excels in being ""awesome"" personified, his presence in the menu for this place confirms that you are in for a treat. And for the most part, you are! Cage would not steer you wrong! Nor would I! Nor would any of the staff here, provided they come around to your table on a more frequent basis.

Las Vegas is not lacking in dining options. Shoot, The Venetian itself probably has somewhere around 73,000 restaurants inside of it alone, making your choice of eatery even more daunting. But Zeffirino deserves your attention for sheer ambience, deliciousness and overall experience. And the whole package starts before you even get inside the door. Well, actually, wait - you probably end up seeing this place before you can get to it: it stretches several storefronts on the second floor, so you'll see blue awnings adorned with the name of the place over shops while diners sit above and look out the windows at the gondolas going by and the desperate tourists trying to convince themselves this is actually Venice, a feat no amount of alcohol or goofy bachelorette photos will achieve. The door leading in is around the corner.

Now then... when you arrive, a duo of hostesses greet you with a level of personality and poise that is great to behold. These ladies either really care about each guest coming through the doors, or are great actresses. Me? I chose to think they liked seeing us, but then again, I live in denial regularly. Anyway, our hostess walked us up a flight of stairs past an opulent bar and lounge area, through another smaller lounge and into an elongated dining room that went around the corner to the windows where the other guests probably vie for seating. We had a party of five and settled in for a booth, and this was one of the nicest booths I've had the pleasure of sitting in. For one thing, the booth backs go up past your head, considerably. It lends a degree of privacy. For another, they're comfy!

We were waiting for the remaining guests in our party to arrive when a waiter showed up to take our drink order and fill us in on the specials. We ordered and settled on a bottle of wine per his recommendation - and he made a great choice, one of which escapes me completely as I type this. Our last guests showed up and the wine was poured, the entrees were ordered and an appetizer platter was prepared. The platter itself was decadent: prosciutto, melon, mozzarella, etc. Each piece was delectable, and ditto the calamari, too. The appetizer price, $78, was not so delectable. Pricing can be a bit egregious here, so be warned.

And then the entrees arrived. Simply put, this is masterclass dining. Everything from the pounded chicken to the risotto and my personal entree, some seafood pasta that made me consider masquerading as Aquaman interviewing for a position as a chef with this place, were outstanding. Food of this scale is known for landing people in comas but at least we were flirting with a comatose status with a smile on our faces. After all, desserts had to still be ordered! And that was how Nicolas Cage reaffirmed that everything was going to be okay with the world.

And for the most part, everything here is okay. We were seated in a great dining room, the food was outstanding and a violinist even stopped by at one point for entertainment. But just as he put in an appearance and moved on with his duties, so, too, did the majority of the waitstaff. Service here, as other reviewers have mentioned, drags... And drags some more... And maybe that's their way of not rushing you and letting you enjoy the full Zeffirino experience. That's fine, but I would like to do it with my after dinner scotch. I'm not sure how long it takes to grab a scotch from the bar but apparently it is an epic quest bordering on the Homeric side of things. And then when it arrived, it was skimpy, at best. If that's what ordering it ""neat"" gets you, you might want to save your booze budget for somewhere else. You're certainly not lacking in options.

But to lose sight over the greatness in the face of service sidesteps is missing the point. This is a wonderful choice to host a private event or try to impress a date at. You've got delicious food, an ambience practically lifted off the streets of Italy and the world's friendliest bathroom attendant! At least, I think that's what he was. I'm not sure... There was a guy I'm assuming employed here standing in the hallway on the way to the bathroom who was quick to open the door to the room and stand by outside. I mention this because, well, why not? If he can be more prompt in his service than some of the other members of the staff, good for him.

The waiter recommended the Chilean sea bass with white wine and capers, which was an extremely bland, flavorless dish. Couldn't taste any wine or any of the three capers served on the fish.  I could only eat a small portion because it completely lacked flavor. It was served with spinach, which was not at all tasty, and I like spinach.  Also disappointing were our appetizers.  To start, we also ordered the shrimp cocktail, which was recommended by the waiter, which made no sense because the risotto dishes had the identical shrimp on top.  Also disappointing was the Caprese.  The tomatoes were tasteless, and the balsamic vinegar was poured on the serving dish with the caprese in such a small quantity that it was impossible to scoop up and put on your salad.

The food was unbelievable, the wait staff was friendly, fun and attentive. We were lucky to get a table overlooking the canal and enjoyed the serenade all night long. Do yourself a favor and stop in for a meal here.

2519658,2015-01-01,1,qtc1YZix_5lHBJTZq7DOpA,"Are you a fan of Restaurant Impossible or Kitchen Nightmare?  Come here to get a first hand experience.

Came here with a 12.30pm reservation for Christmas brunch.  Greeted by hostess with ""how many in your party?"", to which I responded ""four, but we have reservations"".    Reservations is apparently a foreign concept here as her response was ""ok, your name is on the list"".  Fine, it's Christmas morning, so beggars can't be choosers.  So I asked how long the wait is, she said 20 minutes, not bad.

Proceeded to the first floor bar, where we ordered bloody mary and coffee.  Knowing we were going to wait I asked whether it's possible to score some bread.  
The bartender, whom I will call ""cranky"" responded with ""sure sir, let me get your drinks and then I will leave these customers here to go upstairs and get you some bread"".  Well jolly Christmas to you too, cranky!
Luckily she didn't end up having to leave her station as her slowness with the drinks meant we were called upstairs before she could bring them all out.
As we were ready to go upstairs cranky left a parting gift by instructing us to wait for all our drinks, as I'm sure it would have been a disaster for the restaurant if she or her colleagues were to leave their station to bring us the drinks upstairs.

Our arrival at the 2nd floor was greeted by a life-size Pavarotti statue and another hostess who I will call 'clueless'.  Clueless asked us how many were in our party to which I responded, ""four, and we were just called upstairs"".
""OK sir"", clueless responded, please just wait in the waiting area until your name is called.  Lo and behold, there were at least another eight parties waiting for their tables (really, Open Table should cease to do business with this establishment as their practice is downright insult to the concept of reservations).
As other parties started giving up I kept inquiring clueless how long the wait is going to be, but clueless was being, well ... herself.
At some point, dizzy from the hunger, I went inside the dining area to see whether I could score some bread.  A lady who looked like the head hostess was kind enough to grab some for me and informed us that it wouldn't take much longer before we could be seated.

One hour after our reservation time we were at our table.  The dining area overlooks the grand canal of the Venetian shopping mall, Vegas at its best.

Christmas brunch buffet consisted of high end selections such as lobsters, veal, oysters, cold cut meats, cheese, fish prepared in multiple ways.  Food was good, four stars.  
Unfortunately the buffet was served by a row of miserable waiters.  I don't blame them, I'd be miserable too if I had to serve hungry, upset customers on Christmas day.  Hey, let me channel my inner Robert Irvine here: it's a Vegas buffet.  Would you consider letting your customers serve themselves?  

Our waiter, Javier, was the sole reason why I rate this restaurant two stars.  He was friendly, attentive, and has a good sense of humor.  He was the only one I interacted who felt like he belonged there, in a high end establishment.  Five stars for him.

Price was ok, $85 per person including tax and tips.  Expected price for Vegas.

Overall, unless you must have an Italian meal and you must have it at the Venetian shopping mall I suggest you go elsewhere.  The Las Vegas Boulevard has probably the greatest concentration of restaurants in all of America except for Manhattan.  Customers are blessed with choices here.",r01zHizMGnxS00AqXyJb8Q,0,0,2,3qNYPlYlw0H1pP2I7uc8-g

The reception was fantastic. We had a private room, passed items (chicken skewers, risotto balls, shrimp, and more), TONS of fresh vegetables, lasagna, carved ham & turkey, etc. The restaurant also did my cake (white cake with chocolate mousse). I was told by multiple people that it was by far the best wedding cake they had ever eaten, and I have to agree...it was fantastic! Additionally, they brought out pastries which were also great.

It's quiet enough where you can hear others talking at the table, and not have to fight to hear one another over the noise (as with many restaurants in the Venetian, which are very noisy). 

The service was phenomenal. I would give 5-stars for the service overall. I was with for C-Level Execs and they had a hard-stop at 1:10. I mentioned this when we were seated.  The staff was great about serving us quickly and got us in and out in time.  They were very attentive throughout our meal.

I am deducting 2 stars, only because the food was not great. I had the seabass with capers and spinach. Both the spinach and the sauce were SO SALTY, I found it to be in-edible. I did not even finish my meal.  I had to eat bread to buffer the salty taste of the food.  I would not go back for this reason alone, and it's a bummer, because this restaurant has great potential, but something must be wrong, because the restaurant was half-empty when we arrived at noon.

They were able to sit a big group of us, although unfortunately we were the only ones up there, which made me wonder why service was being so difficult.

Located at The Grand Canal Shoppes at The Venetian, this is one popular fine dining Italian restaurant. And for good reasons too.

The minute you step foot into this restaurant, you are completely taken back to old-fashioned, traditional Italy architecture and decor. First level is like a lounge with a full sized bar. Then you can either take the stairs/elevators to the second level for the restaurant portion.

Service was great. Our waiters were very attentive throughout the entire evening. Our drinks were constantly kept full.

Started off with a couple different dishes of antipasti.
***Calamari e Gamberetti alla Diavola----Calamari and Baby Shrimp sauteed with Extra Virgin Olive Oil, Garlic, and Diced Fresh Tomato, in a Spicy Tomato Sauce.

****Carpaccio di Manzo, Parmigiano e Germogli di Rucola----Thin sliced beef tenderloin, capers, shaved parmesan, and rucola sprouts with lemon dressing.


For our entrees, we got:

***Risotto Gamberi e Granchio----Carnaroli rice with crabmeat, shrimp, garlic, a touch of tomato and white wine.

***Filetto di Branzino alla Catalana----Pan seared Mediterranean Sea bass fillet with white wine, half of a 1  1/2 lb. lobster served in a pink sauce and spinach.


Definitely really enjoyed my dinner that night. Plus the atmosphere of the  restaurant made everything so much more elegant. I would definitely love to come back here again and maybe try their pasta dishes.

Fresh and sizeable steamed clams for the appetizer alongside some oysters on the half shell served extra chilled. Very clean horseradish.

Lobster and Seafood linguini was tremendous.
Stuffed quail quarter was very tender.
Mackarel served whole, de-boned at your table, was flaky, flavourful, and very fresh.

Almost nothing else on the menu is from the original or even from Genoa -- sort of a sampler of what Americans think of when they think of Italian fine dining.

The slow, confused service staff asked us what we ordered several times and still didn't know who ordered what when they brought it. It was like watching the Keystone Kops as waiters. There was even a manager involved at one part. It was total chaos and the antithesis of relaxing. 

When they finally put our food in front of us, it was a sad, tiny dish. I ordered the ravioli. They brought 5 of the most limp, flat, and bland ravioli I have ever seen in my life. This is what you get for a $30 dish. 

I'm not sure how they've stayed in business ""since 1939."" I guess businesses can stay open longer in high tourism areas because they rely on the ignorance of their patrons and not on repeat business.

ps: I was just looking at other reviews (I don't read them before writing because I don't want them to color mine.). I am so confused at the comments calling this ""fine"" dining.

* Raviolis bathing in a pesto cream sauce are cooked al dente and the pesto cream sauce is outrageous! It's packed full of flavor and will not disappoint.
* A tray of thinly sliced meats like prosciutto and salami glisten with fatty goodness. The cured flavors are on mark and are excellent.
* Carved filet mignon with marsala mushroom sauce is cooked to a perfect rare to medium-rare and so tender you can cut it with a butter knife.
* Thinly sliced smoked salmon is tender and melts in your mouth like butter. The red onion and capers are the perfect pairing giving it a balanced flavor.
* Antipasto bar with marinated porcini and portobello mushrooms are fabulous and work well with the sliced cured meats.

3293757,2013-04-18,0,qtc1YZix_5lHBJTZq7DOpA,"Many moons ago when I found myself at the Venetian more often than not, colleagues and friends alike would be here at Zeffirino's eating and drinking our work grind away to relax for a solid Italian option in the resort. It was far away from the most popular eateries within the casino, but casual yet intimate enough to be one of the Venetian's most versatile. Good food, great ambiance, and almost always a good time.

Lots of visitors to the Venetian often balk at the fact there is no dedicated buffet on premises, but if there were one, it'd be here. It won't be the self-indulgent, competitive eater training course like many other spreads at nearby resorts, but a classier, simplistic array of Italian specialties that change on a near daily basis and is served by someone every time. Be sure to ask nicely if you want a good helping and know the Sunday brunch hour is probably the most recommended time to try it.

But their best execution has always been items from their nightly a la carte menu. Homemade ravioli of various fillings are no stranger to my plate and their other pasta options were filling and rich. One of their strengths was rolling with anything in the seafood realm. Whether it was a sea diver scallop appetizer or a crab ragu linguini or a lobster risotto, it would often taste as good as it looked. Prosciutto wrapped anything? Yes please.

Some other tips for maximizing the experience:

* Thinking of hosting a wedding reception here? Definitely a stellar choice.
* Things to avoid on their menu: anything parm (especially chicken) and their steaks could use a little work.
* You don't have to eat. Drink wine instead.
* Service is usually super, but beware of the occasional waiter/waitress having a bad day.
* Holiday buffets are nice, but avoid if you can - they're overpriced and incredibly overcrowded.
* There will be live acts on occasion. Appreciate the musicians, they sing tons better than any of the touristy (and cheesy) gondola guys rowing across the canal. At least there's a decent view.",ysCBsXWPB-LAiewVS3jZfQ,2,0,4,4yiHiqndoDGg6H1x3Fcovw

3326220,2009-07-15,1,qtc1YZix_5lHBJTZq7DOpA,"Zeffirino claims to be a quintessential Venetian restaurant.  In reality, it is a quintessential Las Vegas restaurant, which happens to be located at the Venetian Hotel.  Zeffirino is so concerned with maintaining it's fake upscale, fake Italian image, that it almost forgets to pay attention to the food.  Yep, you heard me: the food is an afterthought here.  If you don't believe me, check out their website, which is dedicated to the decor more than the menu.

Don't get me wrong, the decor here is top notch.  Second floor dining with giant balcony windows, overlooking the hustle and bustle of the Grand Canal is very impressive.  The restaurant affords amazing people watching opportunities.  What could be better than watching hordes of beautifully dressed men and women parade on the ""street"" below you?  Before you even get to the second floor, you find yourself in a giant library on the first floor.  Antique furniture, a piano, vases - the place looks and smells like Ron Burgundy's apartment in Anchorman.  By the time you get to the second floor, you expect to have a dining experience of your life.

Our waiters definitely valued form over substance as well.  Clad in tuxedos and looking very refined, they evoked feelings of reverence and respect.  Sadly, I may have overestimated them.  I realize I was in Las Vegas and not particularly dressed up, but it was no excuse for snooty attitude and mild ambivalence.  I have a piece of advice for Mr. Waiter at Zeffirino's: don't just assume, OK?  I'll put up my food knowledge against yours any time, any day.  Your attitude was insulting and uncalled for, as was your inability to read people.  If you really had been a waiter for that long, you would have been able to recognize a knowledgeable customer. 

Now, on to the meal itself.  We had a $39 four-course prix fixe menu, which is what brought us out to Zeffirino in the first place.  As is the case in many restaurants, I had to ask for the prix fixe, since it wasn't brought out to us.  They did bring us bread, olive oil and olive spread, all of which we really enjoyed.  We asked for ""more bread and more spread"" a couple of times, and the busboy promptly brought it for us.

I started with a Caesar salad which wasn't exciting.  Perhaps, it's my fault for ordering a boring salad, but it definitely wasn't my fault said salad was really bland.  The second course was standard, a plate of ravioli.  The ravioli was prepared al dente, and was easily the best part of the entire meal.  My third course, chicken parmigiana, was pretty bland and very forgettable.  I swear, I've had better dishes at the Olive Garden.  Finally, the dessert course consisted of unlimited coffee or tea, as well as 3 tiny (size of a postage stamp) pieces of tiramisu, cheesecake and carrot cake.  As was the case with each of the courses, the presentation was great, but the food was barely aspiring to mediocrity. 

That said, any restaurant in Las Vegas that has a $39 prix fixe, welcomes walk-ins at 8 pm on a Saturday night, and gives you a table overlooking the upscale mall deserves at least 3 stars.  The next time I am hungry and reservation-less in Sin City, I might end up at Zeffirino again.",Z7PaVxobw44iejw3hR0UoQ,6,2,3,xKkjqInR4JbpRpVll2LgPw

The upstairs dining in the VIP room with the view of the Grand Canal has a really neat view and ambiance.  Service was wonderful, and most of the food was excellent.  

But I only give 4 stars for the food because the mushroom Risotto was off.  It's a shame, because we had the same dish last time we went there and it was really excellent then, which is why we were looking forward to having it again this time.  But this time, it tasted like it had way too much wine and was under-seasoned.  I asked for some salt, and getting a proper amount of salt improved it a lot, but the alcohol-like flavor (I assume from the wine) was still a bit overwhelming.  

We also had the caprese and the chateaubriand.  The caprese was excellent.  The chateaubriand was cooked very well.  The vegetables were very good, but also a bit under-seasoned.  They brought us a complimentary tiramisu because it was our anniversary, and it was some of the best tiramisu I have had.  

Overall, we had a great experience.  While a few things were under-seasoned, it's not difficult to add some salt, and we had a great meal.  We will be back, and we will add the tiramisu to our list of must-haves when we visit Zefferino.",FvjhVWS4L4rPAumWpmMwZA,0,0,4,BCaQk_zdBQNX4oQP5_molg

Made a business dinner reservation for 4 at 7pm during CES.
Not unlike many airlines, they clearly over-booked, because we didn't get a table until 8:40pm (while watching many much larger parties get seated before us), and only after much complaining, and then for me to actually walk upstairs to find an open table, and then to tell the door staff about it!

In the meantime, one of my key business contacts LEFT. That's right, the wait as SO long that they had to leave!! 
I was LIVID, but the girl at the front door didn't seem to empathize with me, or the many others who were as pissed as i was.

When the remainder of our party finally got seated, service was slow.
The 3 of us ordered the Sea Bass with the Lobster. Mediocre at best! :(
Sea Bass was over-cooked, and everything was slathered in a rose tomato sauce tht would have been better suited on a linguine dish. It just seemed cheap for the $40 pricetag.

I will caveat this by saying the Lounge (bar) staff were very gracious, and tried to make amends for the misfortune. But I was already too jaded & upset for it to matter.

Again, I will NOT go here again !!!",G63Nfg5238YxDlnts_JZ-A,0,0,1,GAClLWx-Ihu5ENftWQR9ng

3433603,2009-05-01,0,qtc1YZix_5lHBJTZq7DOpA,"We had our rehearsal dinner at Zeffirino in the Venetian.  We found them on Yelp.  Thanks Yelps, my mother-in-law was very excited to read about the decor.  She loves everything Italian.  

We chose the 49.50 Menu for dinner.  
Appetizer - tomato and Mozzarella Awesome
Salad - Caesar basic white parts of lettuce, not at green as I'd like it.
Dinner - Chicken Marsala warm and moist, really good mushrooms.
My honey had homemade ravioli and it had that warm gooey homemade texture, that I like.  The sauce was basic marinara.  This can be a hit with the 12 year old's who are plain eaters.  The Salmon looked large, 12 ounces, I was jealous that I did not order it. They had a weird spinach muffin type cups that were a little odd, but tasted fine. 
They basically handle big parties and they are all about the speed and convenience of banquet parties.   

The banquet lady on the phone told me that she has house wine for about 40$.  So when the wine guy approached me.  I told him to give us the house wine.  He had a bit of confusion. You you need to pick your wine, they sent over the wine director (Thanks, Gary the wine guy ) I felt bad because I just picked the cheapest. I was not paying for the party but I had to kind of handle all of the plans. 

The red was some Italian grape I forget, it was OK. I'm a white drinker, so the Pinot Grigio was way better . The bottles ran about 32$ to 37$. 

We arrived late and we were waiting in the bar for the rest of our group.  My sister-in-law called and asked me to order a kid pasta for her three-year-old.  So I went to the hostess at the downstairs front door and she told me that we could order from the bartender.  The bartender told us that we had to order from our waiter upstairs.  
I went upstairs to tell the hostess that we needed a kid pasta ordered and we will have a screaming toddler arriving shortly.  She tells me we have been wondering where you were, your the first to check in, WHAT.  We checked in downstairs, a half hour ago?.  I don't understand the point of the hostess downstairs?    Lost one star for the teenage hostess that basically stands there and stares at you when you asks her questions like, ""DO you have a kids Menu"", and.... ""Do I tell my family to follow the Canal Shoppes signs from the Valet or what are some of the signs they should follow""? I get no response. I had to find my own menu inside the door.  She just stared at me with, a look like why are you asking me for menu's and directions?

Just play it safe and valet your car in front of Venetian and go straight to the concierge on your right and they will give you a map with about fifteen turns and you still get a little lost.  Eventually you will get there.  

When my sister-in-law showed up, she saw a big party of 65 people walk in front of us. Also, because of the impending screams of a hungry three year old, she was ready to leave. We talked her into getting upstairs to the table, and 3 seconds later there was pasta in front of the hungry toddler. 
I don't think she realized that when you contract for a large party, you have to commit to a certain number of people and her dinner would have been charged. 

The service was impeccable, the food was warm and Delicious, the entertainment was so fun and the decor was absolutely beautiful.

The violinist guys hung out with us for a long time, I realized that our ""Best man"", was throwing down some cash.  They also had a couple guitarist a Roy Orbison looking guy, they were so cute.

The toddler had a fit and grandma took him to the bathroom.  Big couch in there, you have to see the water closet's. 
The servers brought the baby some ice cream into the bathroom. How sweet is that!!!

Zeffirino's caters to big parties, we got a little scared thinking we better hurry and order before that big party gets ahead of us.  The place is so huge we never even saw the big party and our service was fast,  I think we had about three or four servers all over us",9nZuT9_jFkBpzBD_Xvi5Vg,0,0,4,DBNNjJo_pux6epuscxfF-Q

3496566,2012-11-23,1,qtc1YZix_5lHBJTZq7DOpA,"Disclaimer: I've only eaten the Thanksgiving dinner buffet here, so I don't know what their regular menu is like.

Had Thanksgiving dinner here a few hours ago. I would not recommend this to anyone else.

First off, they put our table of 8 in a great big round booth. Keep in mind, the meal was served as a buffet- so basically everyone had to go at once or there was a lot of standing around waiting, changing places, etc. There was an empty table made for 9 people but they refused to move us there.

Second, the buffet. Without even getting to the food- it was not a self-serve buffet. There were people at every station to plate the food for you and this made for long lines in a very small space. Also portion control was difficult- I received much larger helpings of some cold cuts than I wanted but when I got to the pasta I was given ONE SINGLE RAVIOLO. not ravioli. ONE SINGLE RAVIOLO. I asked for more... and was grudgingly given one more.

And okay, now the food. The turkey (breast) was decent with some red wine reduction. The mashed potatoes were horrid and tasted like instant potato flakes. The cold meats and smoked salmon were fine. The caprese salad was BLAND BLAND BLAND and they didn't give me any damn basil. The apple and chestnut stuffing had an appalling texture and very little flavor; there was no regular stuffing. The ravioli (all two that I got to have) were forgettable. The desserts were the only thing I actually liked- there was a tasty chocolate mousse cake and tiramisu.

OH! OH OH OH! For large parties, gratuity is automatic and as a result you will probably see a waiter once or twice throughout the evening, if that. We sat around for like 15 minutes waiting for someone to take our drink order. Instead, a waiter came over to tell us that we could go to the buffet whenever we wanted. We had to remind him that we might like something to drink, too. When the soft drinks did arrive, they were served in plastic Pepsi bottles like you'd get from a vending machine. WHAT?! At least it allowed us to refill our glasses on our own, because we would have gone thirsty otherwise considering how rarely we saw the waitstaff. When we did see them, they were largely unfriendly.

Finally, there are musicians who walk around playing cheesy Italian-ish music. Like the theme from The Godfather, really. They come up to your table and play in your ear and it's super awkward.

Basically- forgettable food and waiters that forget you exist. Forget this place and go somewhere else! You are in The Venetian; it's not like it's hard to find Italian food.",rUW7_B9pBNdDR3Y2bBz9TQ,1,1,1,8ip2UB6FeShQRnsmYrWGLQ

We arrived without reservations and received a window seat looking down upon the grand canal where the gondoliers do their serenades which was quite nice.  The windows are open so you're able to hear the songs and some of the water for ambiance.

I ordered prosecco,  minestone soup to start,  penne with tomato sauce and split tiramisu for dessert.  They also served a bread  bowl with our food. 

Service was on top of EVERYTHING... better than most places by far.  It felt like there was someone on the lookout for any indication they had to get in there.  I'm lowering my folk from the last bite I can possibly eat but not visibly done and there's the server asking if I was done.

It's rather dark inside but the restaurant area is on the second floor and is somewhat narrow but nice.  They boast that it's the only 2nd floor seating in the entire Grand Canal.  Woo.

We had a fixed menu since there were nearly 50 of us.  We only chose the drinks and one of three entrees.  The appetizer (radicchio, mozzarella and speck) and salad were uninspired, as was the bread and butter.  Seriously this is VEGAS, there should be like lava in the butter, or the bread should be red, or there should be a nude lady dancing on the table.  COME ON!

I ordered the beef medallions.  Again, uninspired.  They were a bit salty and had a sauce on top.  And we all know truly good beef needs no sauce.  It seemed that the sea bass was the best of the three dishes.  The wine for the most part was good, but we hit a really nasty one and switched over from red to white.  The service was average, but why would you expect anything better if they've already been paid up front with a fixed menu service?

The saving grace was the dessert tray.  Large 20"" trays of bite-sized desserts were presented to us.  There were so many to choose from and every one that I tried was fantastic.  We all joked that it must have been brought in externally since we saw no indication of a pastry chef and the quality of dessert to the rest of the meal was complete incongruous.

All in all, not impressed.  There are a bunch of other places to go in Vegas, and I'm eyeing that new Cut place in Palazzo.",kxGmX1lBXJAv-4mI_QduWg,5,4,3,UirZD0vQ--LCmFCl0xiW6w

Also, in true strip fashion, we were given the ""water"" option of sparkling or bottled - but tap was not mentioned and I forgot how the system works.  $8 for water - sorry, embarrassing.

The hotel was packed and it was an iffy proposition getting a table at Canaletto's. Upon arriving the hostess says 60-70 minute wait! ""Not Going To Happen"" on my watch so we walked the 60 yards to Zeffirino's.

It was almost empty? What the hell I thought. One Italian restaurant is mobbed and some 60 yards away one is almost empty. Well, that was not a good sign. But we were seated by a very nice hostess and showered with very good bread, water and an opening gratis appetizer. OK so far. So why is this place not doing business?
We all ordered, and the food came at the right temperture, and it was fresh and tasted good and so on and so on and.........So what gives? I couldn't figure it out. Maybe the outdoor (actually indoor) seating at Canaletto's? Maybe the light airy atmosphere at Canaletto's as opposed to the darker more traditional look of Zeffirino's? Could it be the creepy stuffed mannequinn of Luciano Pavarotti in the foray? Probably not.
Well it certainly wasn't the service or the food. This restaurant was very good and I would go back! They had fresh homemade pastas, very fresh fish, a mediocre (though) caesar salad, but very good aged parmigiano-reggiano cheese. 
It was nice dinner for being a second choice. We finished our dinner just about the same time we would have been seated at Canaletto's. We did right by coming here.",mW8MkLll_9arRvWIRy0i5w,2,1,4,wq5nkOzpnd001gnPuG135w
3786590,2013-07-01,0,qtc1YZix_5lHBJTZq7DOpA,"If I could give this place negative stars I would.  By far the worst dining experience I've ever had and the food was absolutely horrible.  Here's a recap:

-My parents received two vouchers for a free lunch or dinner at Zefferino's as part of a promotion for attending a timeshare presentation from a resort that has a booth at Venetian
-We ate at Zefferino's for lunch on June 10, 2013
-My parents free meal had a choice of several entrees and included a salad and coffee or tea.  I had the ""Grand Canal"" menu which was about $25
-When we sat down, the server took about 3 minutes to come over to the table and upon seeing the free meal coupons, he did not greet us and just said ""oh, you have those"" like he was annoyed to have us at his table
-The water that was brought to the table was warm and had no ice
-We asked for ice, had to ask a second server to bring us the ice after our server didn't, and when the ice was brought out he just brought us a bucket and set it on the table without saying anything.  
-My dad doesn't drink coffee or tea and asked if he could have a diet soda instead, and the server said ""no, you only get what's on the card"" in a very stiff and annoyed manner....like it would be that difficult to just give him a soft drink instead of coffee or tea.  
-My mom had a salad and the grilled salmon, my dad had a salad and the chicken marsala, and I had the calamari appetizer, pan seared salmon filet, and the ""dessert"" of ""various pastries""
-The calamari was rubbery and tasted like it was previously frozen, the quality was on par with something I would get from the grocery store frozen section
-The salads my parents had were bland and tasteless
-The chicken marsala my dad ordered was terrible.  When I say terrible, I mean it was absolutely horrendous, almost inedible. Chicken was rubbery and overcooked, tasted like it was previously frozen and microwaved, definitely not ""pan seared"" as it was supposed to be, the marsala sauce tasted like canned gravy, and we both agreed that it was the worst chicken marsala we've ever tasted, and chicken marsala is my dad's favorite dish.
-The salmon I had was caked in breading, had no indication of being pan-seared (no sear marks anywhere), also tasted like it was previously frozen, and there was no garlic, white wine, onions, parsley, or black olives as the menu indicated
-The potatoes were dry and had no seasoning
-The server never came back to the table to ask us how anything was before we finished eating it
-When the ""dessert"" that came with the Grand Canal menu came out, it was three tiny bite-sized pastries and all of them were soggy and soft to the touch, like they had been left in a refrigerator overnight (or longer) and the moisture made them mushy.  They were obviously not freshly made.
-When the server finally came back to the table and asked us how the food was, I told him that honestly everything was absolutely terrible, gave him the reasons why, and he said something to the effect of ""oh, sorry to hear that"".  He walked away, did not offer to bring us anything else, and never told a manager about our complaint.  
-The server did not bring our coffee or tea, he just dropped the check on the table and never bothered to ask if we wanted to order anything else
-After we asked him for the coffee and tea, we had to remind him a second time before it was brought out
-The tea was a Lipton tea bag with hot water.  A fine-dining restaurant should not be giving customers a Lipton tea bag that I can get 100 bags of at the grocery store for $3.
-On the way out of the restaurant, the server was walking towards me and immediately walked the other way, not wanting to say anything to us on the way out

Since this was my parents' 30th anniversary vacation, I did not want to make a big deal out of the experience in front of them and decided to voice my complaints after they returned home.  My parents left Vegas on 6/14. On 6/15 I spoke with Mr. Russo and described to him all of the items above, and he said he would talk to the server and get back to me.  He asked me to send a copy of our receipt to his email address, which I did on 6/17.  As of 6/30, I still had not received any response.  I sent a follow-up email, and his response was as follows:

""Good evening Mr. ******,
I apologize for the delay,
I spoke to the Manager to the chef and to the server on duty on June the 10th. The manager said that none of our customer complained or asked to talk to him that day. The chef said that he didn't get any complain about calamari or salmon. The server said that it was no leftover food during your lunch.
I can only apologize if our food didn't meet your expectations. If we were aware of your complain at the moment, we would have been able to make your experience a better one.
Best regards,

We got to vegas at 7 and were starving. Both the wife an I were craving italian, so we asked to concierge for a recommendation. He recommended Zeffirino, and off we went.

We were given a nice table on the balcony with a view, and the sommelier promptly came over and helped us choose a bottle. We decided to order from the $39 full-dinner menu, both getting the Pomodoro and Mozzarella  for an appetizer (which was excellent). The pasta course (Paffutelli Zeffirino) was especially good. i ordered the Involtini di Pollo as an entree while my wife ordered the Lasagna. The portions were generous, and both dishes were great.

Our food was good, not mind blowing. The ambiance was very nice, and i had no issue with my server, who i felt was very gracious.

I've been to Vegas 6 times and never walked in this place, MUCH larger than i thought, and VERY nice inside.

They have a price fixed menu at the door, but you need to ask to see it upstairs. I didn't have an issue with asking our server, but i think it's definately a way to get you in the door and they ""forget to give it to you"" when seated because ONE entree is the price of the price fix.

I had a very good fettucini alfredo (a side dish i asked for entree size- a gracious yes), and my husband had what he calls the best veal parm he's ever had (he says this every time he has veal parm). we coupled this with only a ceasar salad split and the house bread (very good, airy crusty bread).

I will say the pasta was FRESH pasta which made this italian girl happy. I felt this was authentic italian, everything tasted fresh. It was a bit pricey, and to me, this all equals average because i'm used to these restaurants in Philadelphia.",7Ie0VmQtnGYUVq2YW4dTVw,0,0,3,r0a3Eo8aVaqlB7yUR8nTgA

It seems to be the simplest of Italian dishes that encompasses everything good about Italian food. A well done pasta and a tasty meat sauce that is spiced just right - something basic that mama teaches you.I know - it's a stupid rule but one that has worked for me nonetheless.  

My bolognese at this joint came in lumpy and absent of taste. The waitstaff take their time to get to you (and it wasn't busy at all) unless they are bringing you the cheque. My wife ordered the veal and it was overdone. We had a third person in our party that ordered a eggplant parm (which is pretty much the only vegetarian thing they had)  - and that was done relatively well. 

I can see the charm in wanting to eat here - but it's just not worth the price in my humble estimation. I've eaten good Italian food in Italy, NYC, Philadelphia and L.A. I am yet to find a place that matches that definition in Las Vegas.",UPNuvW7y6aVwhKK5z6eTJw,1,0,2,xj6wdcuRhHyOSiLG6xbaGQ
3866313,2007-07-07,2,qtc1YZix_5lHBJTZq7DOpA,"One word: Overrated.

I was definitely underwhelmed by the food. Ambiance was nice, if you like to watch a shopping mall from where you're sitting (we got seated in a ""nice"" location overlooking the toilet blue water, gondolas and the Kenneth Cole store). The interior is nice, but nothing special if you're a foodie and dine out often. The service was average, a small hint of pretense included.

We went in expecting a nice dinner and ordered the following:
--Appetizer: Sauted clams and black mussels with garlic, white wine, capers and parsley
This was not good. It looked like it would be delicious when presented at our table. There was a light garlic sauce covering the mussels and clams which was quite good by itself. However, the actual shellfish was completely bland and some were too chewy, like they cooked them too long. Overall, it left a lot to be desired.

--Entrees: 
1) Homemade pasta sauted with lobster, white wine and baby Shrimp in a Light Tomato sauce
This dish was pretty average fare. There was one large lobster claw and a bunch of baby shrimp, so they definitely didn't skimp on the seafood. The sauce was pretty flavorful and the noodles were cooked well. It just wasn't orgasmically delicious. Oh, and the serving size was Buca-esque, which, to me, isn't a good sign for a supposedly ""fine dining"" establishment.
Also, it was garnished with a random piece of purple cabbage and parsley. PARSLEY?? seriously?? I thought this was a classy joint!

2) Pan seared breaded veal loin, topped with tomato, mozzarella and parmigiano served with sauted tomato pasta
This was my bf's dish. He didn't like the veal which was SMOTHERED in cheese but he said the pasta was alright.

Since neither of us are wine-lovers, we just ordered a few cocktails, much to our server's dismay. He was visibly bothered by our decision to skip the wine (it was funny and odd at the same time). Oh and a bottle of Aqua Panna still water is $8, just to let you know in case you were hoping for free water :)

We skipped dessert. Check was $150 for two. Meh.

It was a bit hard to find, since I thought I just needed to take an elevator, but that is not the case.  Near the entrance of the Gondolas, they have a restaurant that says ""the bar"" which you will need to go into, and then upstairs is the restaurant which is the only way to get there.  

The interior of the restaurant itself has an old glamour atmosphere to it, with countless photos hung around, and articles scattered away.  It has an amazing design and gives an authentic Italian energy just as you walk through the doors.  The floors were a bit slippery, I almost tripped while walking around the long hallways; but, none the less, they were beautiful.  The silverware was decorated superbly but my fork was bent, and I just can't eat with a bent fork.

THE SERVICE -

I did not make reservations here, but got seated immediately which was awesome (since I was wearing 6-inch non platform heels, walking almost all day)!  The food came at a slow pace and the servers spilled half my cocktail on the table but the maitre'd was nice enough to clean up my spilled juice and give a new drink free-of-charge. 



THE FOOD -

My friend and I started off our dining experience with their Ostriche Fresche which are fresh oysters of six for $15.00, a very good price for the delectable fresh taste.  The side dish of fettuccine Alfredo was nectarous; I don't know how the chefs cooked it, but it was saccharine and brilliantly executed.  

My first course arrived: a plate of Salmon in white wine, the balsamic outer layer of the lemon zest and capers made the fish oh so brackish.  Freshly-made couscous is one of the humble triumphs of civilization.  The miniature diced tomatos were steamed to perfection, the couscous was delicious and added a kick to the dish, I couldn't have ask for a better meal. 

My friend's Ravioli that had Parmigiano cheese, served in pink sauce looked like throw up on a plate. Even the grated cheese did not make it look any more presentable.  Enough said.


To recap, we ordered the following:

Ostriche Fresche - Fresh Oysters Order of 6 ($14.95)

Fettuccine alla Bolognese ($26.00)

Ravioli in Salsa Rosa ($26.00)

Those were the words that launched our unforgettable Thanksgiving experience. I say unforgettable, of course, because this is one of those atrocious restaurants that's so awful that you feel compelled to stand outside and steer people away.

I knew we were in trouble from the moment we were led to the dining room past a big sign reading, ""NO PHOTOGRAPHY WITHOUT MANAGER'S APPROVAL."" When you feel the need to post an authoritarian, unwelcoming sign banning people from taking pictures, you must have something to hide.

The blackshirts who posted the sign set a dour tone for the rest of the service. Our waiter was flippant and visibly disappointed when no one at our table of eight ordered any wine. We literally never saw him again.

There was no salt and pepper on the table, so I had to steal it off a waiter's cart. Our soft drinks were served in PLASTIC BOTTLES, which has got to be the tackiest thing I've ever seen at a restaurant. It's as if they ran out the back door and bought them at 7-11 when we ordered them.

The food was entirely forgettable. At the risk of sounding politically incorrect, a traditional Thanksgiving dinner at an Italian restaurant might not be the best idea, but my mother-in-law is mighty Italian and she has no problem cooking turkey, mashed potatoes and stuffing. Real stuffing, not some weird apple-ly goop.

The dessert station salvaged some of the experience, with a good selection of little cakes and pies, including a very creamy chocolate cream pie and mini tiramisu.

My dad and in-laws came thousands of miles to spend Thanksgiving with us. Tomorrow we're going to have to take them to Firefly to make up for this travesty.

At least we're all together...isn't that what Thanksgiving is about?

EDIT: I forgot to mention that they have TWO things that NO restaurant should ever have: A bathroom attendant and a guy who comes to your table and plays music. No thanks!

APPENDAGE TO THE EDIT: I think they polish the silverware with Barkeeper's Friend. I know this because the napkins smelled exactly like it. Draw your own conclusions about that process.",ITNVSsPgUIWOwgKMSqwZ2w,4,1,1,dQrSxc_LjkIcCH-6EnTS2g

We were seated and waited on by a staff of no less than five waiters. It was a little early (5:30 on a Monday) and after the long drive from Reno, it was nice to have the whole place to ourselves.

Dinner began with a salad made from orzo pasta, barley, basil, cucumber, olives, parmagino reggiano  and tomatoes with an orange juice vinagrette. One of the most unique salads I have ever had!

I had their take on lobster fra diavolo, which was not as spicy as I normally would like, but consisted of a 2 lb lobster, shrimp the size of small dogs, scallops as big as my fists and an assortment of mussels and clams.

We were lucky to sit upstairs near an open window facing the Grand Canal inside the Venetian shops.  The decor is Old World with lots of oil paintings, furniture imported from Italy, tiles, chandeliers and stuccoed walls.  The fine China is adorned with its namesake so you won't forget where you're eating.

The hubby and I started out with a glass of Prossecco, which is the Italian version of Champagne-so you should order a glass from the Sommelier .  It was fruity, crisp, refreshing and romantic.  

The reason we chose to come here was they offered my favorite...Pasta Carbonara!  We had a very early dinner so the restaurant wasn't busy at all.  Service was polite but I think he was a bit annoyed that we didn't order an appetizer.  However, the pasta was not on the menu but he made it for me anyway.  I remember seeing it on the lunch special but it was dinner time...nonetheless I was graciously accommodated.

The menu is incredible with tons of options!  Foie Gras (which can also be ordered as  side dish), Filet, Lobster, Shrimp, pasta...and the dessert which is freshly made in the restaurant.  

My pasta was brought out and it was perfection!  The hubby ordered lasagna and he was very satisfied although he wished he would have ordered something less boring.

We skipped dessert but not to worry, the bakery out in the shops are the same desserts (the restaurant makes them), so if you don't have room, walk it off and have a coffee and Tiramisu later. 

Prices are comparable to decent restaurants on the strip. Appetizers start at $20 and up to $110 for a seafood platter.  The nice thing is the event space can accommodate at least s120 people for dinner, as an event planner, this is good news.

Overall,  a nice place to try at least once for a special occasion or for locals... for that much needed date night.",uEvusDwoSymbJJ0auR3muQ,12,12,4,BA3FMgG-eoBB0aQ0Hoj18g

Great atmosphere sitting up on the balcony overlooking the gondola ride and canal.  We came around 3:30pm and were seated right away.  Bread was good - hot out of the oven.  We both ordered off the prix fix menu for $19.95 each and were SO happy with our meals.  I was psyched to learn that they had one of my favorite Rieslings by the glass (2003 Dr. Loosen) for only $5.  Our server Georgio said they recently won an award for their caesar salad and I found out why.  It was creamy, not overly garlicky like most are.  I've never been so excited about a salad.  I had the cheese ravioli as my main course and it was fantastic.  The flavor of the truffles came through very well without being over-powering.  The service was attentive and Georgio went above and beyond and made it a very pleasant visit. The bathrooms were clean and had their own sink inside each stall.

The waiter asked for our order before asking about cocktails or bringing water to the table. We ordered sparkling water for some and tap water for the others. Bottled flat water, for which I was charged, was served alongside the bottled sparkling water.  I decided to let it go. Our order was taken a bit quickly and I felt we were being rushed.  I ordered wine for dinner and it was served quickly without any request for cocktail orders. The appetizers were delivered very fast, which confirmed my sense of being rushed. Then things started getting more positive. The food was delicious, calamari and zucchini cooked just right, fresh salads, excellent beef carpaccio, and fresh mozzarella tomato salad.  We actually had a decent interval between the appetizer and main course. The pink sauce and pesto sauce raviolis were as good as it gets. My wife loved her eggplant parmigiana. The dinner menu is quite nice. Then, three desserts were quickly served for the people that bought the dinner. But, again, we were being rushed as one of my guests wanted the fruit option and none of them were asked to choose before the dessert was served. Then we had to ask for coffees and a dessert menu for the rest of us. We were given one menu to share for three people. The restaurant is attractive and the table side live music was enjoyable.

We ordered 2 mixed drinks and 2 beers. Can't mess up beer but the mixed drinks were lousy.
We also ordered an appetizer. We finished our drinks and never got the app. We were also not asked if we wanted another round. I had to go up to the bar to ask for the check and said we weren't paying for the food we never got. Was told a manager was needed.

After my trip to Italy, I know what real Italian food tastes like so I hope I am a good judge of Italian food.  Yes it is pricey, so I would reserve this place for your significant other.

The food here is very authentic.  For an appetizer, I recommend the sliced italian cold cuts with black olives, cheese and bell peppers and Prosciutto di San Daniele con Melone ($20).  I have also had the Seitan carpaccio with shaved parmigiano, rucola sprouts, extra virgin olive oil Gamberi (shrimp) al Vapore ($16) and the Ostriche (oysters,. $14.95 for a 1/2 dozen and $24.95 for a dozen.  For larger parties, I recommend the mixed seafood platter: 10 oysters, 4 clams, 6 shrimp, 1 1/2 lb. lobster, 4 king crab legs ($90).

Entrees:   I have had the baccala, Pan seared black cod with extra virgin olive oil, dried porcini mushrooms, garlic, parsley, anchovies, white wine and lemon juice Zuppa d'Astice, Riso Nero, Pomodoro e Curcuma ($30), the spigola, Grilled whole mediterranean sea bass served with garlic, extra virgin olive oil, oregano, lemon juice and parsley sauce (very simple, $38), one of the specialties of the house, a 1 1/2 lb. lobster, shrimp, mussels, clams and scallops served over linguine in a spicy tomato sauce and fettuccine sauteed with crabmeat, half of a 1 1/2 lb. lobster, and shrimp with a touch of tomato sauce (I have had it both ways ($42).

To finish, I ususally have the insalata mista or the insalata alternativa.  A nice way to finish the meal.  I am not much a dessert person so I won't rate the desserts.  But the waiter is good about recommending a grappa to finish an excellent meal.

I would rate the food 5 stars but the service 3-4 stars.  Everytime I go we have to ask for things, i.e., olive oil, water, et al..  At a restaurant like this where you are paying $100/head before wine, the wait staff should anticipate or ask for your needs.

I would have taken pictures but there is a big sign requesting that no pictures be taken.  I want to respect the restaurant's request.",o1_sfJ71nrq5QrF00v3Icw,0,0,4,IQG9AFrF5eClgg3dZWeWSg

Pro's
1) Decor is great. You have the option for a more relaxed bar seating downstairs or a nicer full restaurant upstairs overlooking the Grand Canal Shoppes.
2) Menu is on the website
3) I had the Ravioli alla Vodka $28 and my husband had the Risotto Gamberi e Granchio $36. We ordered a bottle of Sauvignon Blanc Bastianch for the table $75. The food was delicious and the wine paired wonderful with both dishes. 

Cons
1) Our table was a little woobly, but a waitor noticed and 
promptly came over and tried to fix it for us.
2) I was a little disapointed with the amount of ravioli I received. The portion was quite small.

I even dare to say we tip generously. But not when it's already included in the check. Second time in two years. Other place was in Jackson Hole. Also party of two. We have no friends ;).

And if this wasn't bad enough they also charge your creditcard with a reservation of an extra 15% that's returned after a few days. Blaming the creditcard company. We'll I'm surprised. My creditcard company gives an realtime overview of all transactions, including reservations. Travelling throughout Europe, Canada and The United States this is the first time in ver 10 years that this happens.

We'll let's talk about food, service and atmosphere. Because they have a strict policy of no photography without management approval I can not show you the pictures. Minus an other star. Oke, half a star. You'll have to believe me when I say that food was good. European sizes, so not to huge portions. We've split the salami platter. Even for European standards not a big portion considering the price and the presented meats and cheeses. Also a bit dissappointing were the toastend pepers. I'm a huge fan of them, know the're cheap when you buy them in bulk and easy to prepare. But.........these were canned :(. I know because the canned ones are a little bit more firm and have the little sour taste of the fluid the're kept in. Minus an other half star.

My hubby had an excellent linguine with shrimps and scallops. I had the wildmushroom risotto. The risotto was well prepared. Best I had in a while, but could have done with a little bit more flavor. Don't know if this is a correct English way of describing, but it tasted a little watery. 

With the food came bread. Not very intersting. Little old as if it was out since lunch. Not what we've expected. Olive oil and salt only offered after request. Strange for an Italian restaurant.

For dessert they have several Italian pastries they show you on a plate. Nice way of presentation. We shared the macarons. Considering the're not French and not from La Durée (yes, I'm very picky about my macarons) the were oke. But like everywhere, served way too cold to really taste the flavours. And waiting for them to warm up would have meaned that the (excellent) espresso turned cold. Dutchies always eat their coffee with some kind of a biscuit ;). Not afterwards.

I chose Zeffirino because I was staying at the Palazzo and it was slightly cheaper then the Sterling Brunch.  The restaurant is in the Grand Canal Shoppes at the Venetian.  The room itself is upstairs overlooking the Canal.  It has the feel of an Italian villa.

Like the Sterling Brunch, Zeffirino offers unlimited champagne.  I don't remember the brand but I frankly didn't care.  This brunch doesn't offer your typical breakfast fare but what they did offer was fine food with a decidedly Italian flair.  Offerings included a bunch of different cured meats, pastas, and all different  types of salads.  However the real reason I was there was for the unlimited lobster.  They were chilled whole lobsters split in half.  They weren't warm but they were still extremely tasty.  Other offerings included freshly shucked oysters and clams, P&D shrimp cocktail and lobster claws.  Other excellent offerings included Chateaubriand and lamb chops.  The sea bass was delicious as well as all the pasta offerings.  They do offer omelets made to order.  The accompaniments for the omelets are somewhat slim but what they did have was absolutely done right.  I ordered and spinach and onion omelet and it was fluffy and flavorful.  Desserts were ok.  Offerings seemed somewhat limited but in all honesty by the time I got to dessert, I could barely move I was so full.

Service was excellent from start to finish.  The wait staff made sure that your champagne glass was always filled to your desire as well as offering bloody marys.  Plates were cleared in a timely fashion and the wait staff was always there to fill your needs including taking oyster orders and omelet orders.  However they were not overbearing.

After a few days of usual Vegas eateries and the card flippers outside (seriously... does that actually work?), we decided to have a nice quiet sit Italian dinner on our last night.  A friend picked this spot after walking around a bit.

At first glance, this is really a beautiful spot.  Great decor, nice views overlooking the grand canal, and a great spot overall.  That is where being impressed stopped though.

Vegas was still pretty busy, being this was the Monday after Super Bowl.  We had reservations, and had to wait for about 5 minutes before our table was ready.  Walking in though, there were barely any tables taken.  That made me scratch my head a bit, and I hate when they do that.

To the important part here... the food.  First off, they messed up my first Martini and put blue cheese olives in it (Blue Cheese is my kryptonite).  The next one they brought had ice chips (huge pet peeve).  Whatever... on to dinner.  The waiter recommended large apps for our large group (looking around at our massive table of 6 I was quite confused).  Whatever... if the others wanted it fine.  Calamari, cold cuts and mozz, etc.  They were good.  They better be... I didn't even want to look at what they charged for it all.  The $11 Caesar salad was pitiful.  For that price you sure as hell better be making it fresh tableside.  Obviously, it was not.  

As mentioned before, there is the Price Fix menu and a specials menu.  We definitely got some attitude when asking for it though.  It was becoming very clear why this place was not busy.  The economy still is not great, and this place is no deal.  For the main entrees, everything was good.  Maybe I just judge all Italian food by what I get in NYC... but this was really nothing special (especially considering the prices).  I had some ravioli, which for $29 the 12 small ravioli just were not worth it.  By the way, we did not order off the special menus obviously.

By this point I was done.  Again, nothing really offensive here but the prices.  A friend did order the tiramisu as he ""had to have it"", and afterwards regretted it (especially for the price), as it was some custard in a martini glass.  Very odd.  I think everyone enjoyed the meal though, but hell, I was the one paying for it.

My advice would be to save some money and try elsewhere.  The place is beautiful, and at  1/2 the price I would rate this as 4 stars easy.  But walking out around $100 per person with tax and tip just was not worth the money.  And one more thing that made me laugh... in the men's bathroom they had the attendant who was not there (but the bowl of tips was out).  What made me laugh more though was the cologne selection... a couple I never heard of, and then and Axe body spray.  REALLY people?

Our starters arrived before our cocktails. 
Our wine arrived halfway through our dinners (I believe he forgot it.)
Our check didn't arrive until we flagged down our waiter.

The food? All right. I live in Chicago - a city with hundreds of palate-pleasing eateries - and I've had better Italian down the road from my apartment. The standout was the caprese salad - the mozzarella had an almost air-like mouthfeel. Very nice. Other than that - overpriced seafood (shrimp and lobster) that bordered on chewy and bland. 

Many people rave about Zeffirino's lunch prix fixe menu - if that's where the value and experience lay, then so be it. But for dinner - I wouldn't take anyone back here. I've had better service at a Denny's.",rCTVWx_Tws2jWi-K89iEyw,1,0,1,uQ8G1atNY0ufJoVYEhR7Lw

The Strip also rocks the wee hours, especially on the weekends, so there's plenty to do and see.  Fantastic!  What is absolutely NOT fantastic, however, is realizing at 11 P.M. that you haven't eaten dinner, and as a responsible Yelper and lover of snazzy food visiting one of the capitals of snazzy food, a street hot dog will not do.  Several heart-wrenching phone calls to various concierges later, the Venetian informs me that they still have three (gasp!) restaurants open, and to me, Zeffirino sounded the best, so they immediately added me to the books. 

And so it was that in a stroke of fate, my friend and I happened upon a really good restaurant in Vegas, and a very reasonably priced one ($100 for two people - entree for each, one drink, and an appetizer), which is great after reading Yelp reviews of other restaurants talking about dropping hundreds of dollars per person.  We were the last table seated, and they closed the kitchen before we got to dessert, but hey, that was all our fault - though it would have been nice to ask us if we wanted dessert during dinner, just in case.

We started with the sea bass cake on saffron sauce as an appetizer, which was good, not too fishy but nothing too snazzy.  I had the duck, and seriously, I have never been fed so much duck on a plate in my entire life, and I was definitely very pleased with the flavors and the preparation of the dish.  My Dining Buddy had the fettuccine with seafood, which was served in a good but non-threatening tomato sauce.  The wine menu was like a novel (seriously, it had a table of contents), but I selected a very tasty cocktail (Berry Lemonade) from an extensive list of delicious-sounding mixed drinks and martinis.  Aside from the drinks, the menu, though extensive, was nothing mind-blowing from what we sampled, but all was satisfying, tasty, and reliable, even for people who aren't crazy about Italian or seafood.

I started with the Sangria-- OMG, which after my friend tried (she was still debating what to get) she took and I had to order another one. 
We agreed that the chef had a very subtle hand with flavors, which we both loved. I had the lentil soup and it was probably one of the best lentil soups I have had. I then chose the chicken park, my friend had the eggplant parm-- we would order both again. 
We did the special 3 course meal as part of restaurant week, during which a portion of proceeds go to the charity Three Square to feed the hungry.

The ingredients were fresh and the food was good but even in Vegas I think this restaurant was too full of themselves. When the waiter talks about the restaurant's history more than the food you know you are in trouble.

I had a seafood pasta that was traditional and cooked perfectly, but I could've cooked it perfectly. There was nothing unique about it. The sauce could've been out of a can for all I know. Just didn't stand out. The Chicken parm was good but someone's arm hurts in the kitchen because the chicken was so flat that you almost couldn't tell if it was veal or chicken, I guess this isn't a terrible thing. Just not traditional in my opinion (I also think I make the best chicken parm in the world). Anyways, i give the desserts 5 stars. Their pastry chef is working hard back there and the chocolate and little fancy truffles and whatevers were melt in your mouth delicious. The desserts made the meal enjoyable.

The standard menu was on the pricey side, but they were offering a prix fixe option for about $45 that the four of us decided to try.

Once we made our way upstairs, we were presented with menus, but no mention was made of the $45 option and the leaflet was nowhere to be seen.  When we inquired, the waiter sighed and brought it out.  I guess they think you will forget about it, as you make the trek upstairs to the dining room.

The portions we were served were a bit on the small side, but for the price it seemed fair.  Well my portion of the beef was the smallest of the three ordered, but I could use a little cutting back from time to time.
The soup (squash, i think) was ok, but everyone else raved about their salads and the mozzarella tomato salad.

We also ordered a side of broccoli, which I guess threw them for a loop, as our entrees were served and the side was not.  We reminded them, but by the time it was prepared, we were basically done with the entrees.  I did mention that the portions are small, so five bites of the beef and it was gone.

Desert are basically some petit fours with coffee, which again is not going to fill you up, but were very good.

There are two floors in the place - the ground floor which is dressed up as an oppulant old fashioned European bar, and an upstairs with dining rooms over looking the fake Grand Canal at the Venitian. 
For appitizers we had shrimp cocktail of a sort, and fried calimari. Both were good but not great. The mixed drinks were okay too, but not great.

What makes this place 4 stars for me is the ambience, the decor, the good menu, and the fact that it has both a happy hour and early bird specials. In a town that can now cost many hundreds of dollars a day fro two people to eat and drink (this ain't the old Vegas), the specials as Zeffirino allows a couple to eat their fill of fun, decent Italian food while soaking up all of the faux charm of the hotel's fake atmosphere.

That way you can get drunk cheap and drop the money that you saved onto the tables. I mean, who ever looked at a one hundred dollar veal chop and said ""oh, I hope you make me a millionaire"". 

Wishing for wealth at the slot machines is almost worth skipping the chop and grabbing a plate of inexpensive pasta at Zeffirino's.

!2 of us were on a golf trip in Las Vegas had dinner there one night.   The decor is certainly impressive and we had a private area at the back.  We ordered some pretty expensive brunello and appetizers.   When we ordered dinner, I decided to have seafood rather than steak because I had been having steak all week.  There is a very interesting pasta dish which call for a one pound lobster plus many other shell fish so I ordered that.

When the dish came, there was a lobster head and tail plus clams and mussels and bay shrimp but there was NO lobster in the dish.  So I tried five minutes looking for a piece of lobster and couldn't find one.  So I had the waiter come over and asked.   The first one said the lobster was in the sauce.  So I tried to imaging may be they did it like a bisque style to morcellate the lobster.  But the sauce did not taste lobster, it was a spicy tomato sauce.   So I get another waiter and then the manager to come over.  They finally told us the truth that they RAN OUT OF LOBSTER. and the chef did not tell them.   Now, can any of you tell me how a reputable restaurant can put a dish on a customer table which misrepresent completely what it was supposed to be (put a lobster head and tail and pretend there is lobster).  By the way this was one of the more pricy dish (I believe about $50).    When I ask one of the other golfers who ordered another lobster dish which also called for a pound of lobster whether his had any lobster.  And he also said there was very little.   When encountered this with the manager (Gary O.), he was obviously embarrassed and took the dishes off and comp some wine.  However, I really think that still does not compensate what really happened which essentially was a fraud of misrepresenting the dish and charging people for it.

I looked around the room and saw the place packed.   How many would have ordered the lobster dish, ate what is not lobster and got ripped off.  To be fair, as one of our fellow guest said, this is NOT a high end restaurant.  It is a hotel restaurant in the Venetian which appear to be high end.   They have decent decor and great utensils and frankly, OK food.   But they are by no means a high end restaurant or run by the family.   This is Vegas afterall.  The manager was a mid level worker who probably does not have much say and have some limited resource for comping.  One of the guest went to talk to the Maitre D and was promise to tell the ""owner"" but I seriously doubt that.   

But one main question remained.    If there was no lobster, where did the lobster head and tail came from???",zvFFoW8DR4qxTNqUIZja-A,3,0,1,oXytmKpy80G6KkF23PkDew

The surf n turf cones with tenderloin medallion (which was perfect) shrimp (which they were willing to substitute for a scallop) asparagus potatoes and rapini (similar to spinach)
 The Maître D recommended a very nice bottle of Amarone. I was a little disappointed to discover they charged 3 to 4 times the retail price for this bottle. Even though it was a nice bottle I believe about 2 to 3 times is normal. 

All in all it was a very very good meal and I look forward to eating there again",4mMnZmFxV3uqW3RKdVEvQA,1,0,4,FbqvkRxUMBCQ6PhNwRBh4A

We stopped to look at the menu largely because I was past hungry and had moved on to hangry, which isn't safe for anyone. My beau looked at the menu and decided this was the place.

The restaurant has an old world feel without being stuffy or dated. The service was classic, high-end reminding me of many dining adventures with my parents when I was a kid. The pacing of the service and the meal was perfectly timed. I didn't feel rushed or ignored and they timed their arrival so as not to interrupt our conversation. 

Oh! But the food. So the beau is half Italian, as in his dad was born in Italy and the beau goes to Italy every year. So he is a good judge of Italian food. 

So we started with the cheese plate which was truly one of the best I've ever eaten. The variety was excellent and the portions were truly shareable! I hate it when the cheese comes and the cheese is the size of a cotton ball! What am I supposed to do with that?!

We selected the risotto as entrees. Mine was shrimp and lobster; his was mushroom and black truffle. He said this is the ONLY risotto that he's had in the US that actually tastes like it does in Italy. I've never been to Italy but mine was so rich and creamy yet delicately flavored that I am sad it will probably be a year or more before I have it again. Get the risotto. It's a generous size so share it but make sure to order it.

Ahhhhh dessert. Well, I can't tell you about that because the bread they served us when we were seated was amazing and we ate two baskets of it! No shame! We rarely eat bread because the bread in Austin is utterly underwhelming and so not worth the calories. Eat the bread. Go ahead - have two baskets. It's vacation after all!

We arrived looking for lunch, and figured this would be a perfect spot to order a couple pizzas. Members of our party looked at the menu, then were asked by the hostess ""Do you want to sit upstairs?"" ""Sure!"" they told her, indifferent about our elevation while eating.

Apparently, upstairs is the ""fancier"" area, which does not serve the pizza listed on the menu. Holly H. asked if there was a way we could order it, since it WAS on the menu displayed. ""No."" the waiter flatly told us. We tried to get an explanation, but none made sense (and, with 12 of us already sitting down, we decided against making a scene and leaving).

Most of us ended up ordering the ""25 dollar lunch special,"" a solid deal as it comes with an appetizer/salad, an entree, and a dessert.

I had the ceasar salad and the chicken parm. The salad was very good - the ""authentic"" kind that just comes with one large piece of lettuce that you make yourself. The chicken parm was tasty, though the chicken:pasta ratio was low.  

The server was extremely kind and professional after what we all took as initial rudeness (probably more of a cultural barrier). And the food was good, not great. I was starting to sweeten on Zeffirino's, until I learned later that we were charged $24 for water - I have never been given bottled water without asking!

I'd go somewhere else next time where I didn't constantly feel like the restaurant was trying to pull a fast one",ywe8_GknIJ67TALO7P40-w,3,1,2,Ewp7wqpUBic7qAMcd-1vGw

So I take about a minute to decide what I want. My waiter is walking around and attending to other patrons, doing one thing at a time and walking to the back after every single patron encounter. I try to get this guy's attention to order but he never looks up and never looks my way and he seems to be the only waiter. Fast forward 25 minutes later and my waiter finally comes to take my order. Away he goes. As I'm waiting for the food three tables that got seated after me all got their food before me. It's really infuriating me at this point. 25 minutes later my food finally comes out. This whole time I never get a ""sorry, your food is coming up"" or ""we're a bit behind"" or anything remotely apologetic for the long wait I've been experiencing.

I ordered a beef tenderloin with mushrooms and what I got was a plate that was smaller than the size of my palm. Food was ok but the portion was not satisfying at all. I loaded up on bread and still was not full.

Conclusion: Although this restaurant has some nice views of the Canal and good ambiance, it lacks in every other major criteria a good restaurant should excel in. The service was terrible, the food was medicore at best, the portions were small, it was overpriced, the wait times are long and let me re-iterate THE SERVICE IS TERRIBLE!!",u-xQ2Cmi9LvdpGldH3CJKA,6,3,1,jd3CKUqmlOvl98tZyEmC1g

I split the fettuccine al granchio ($42) with crabmeat, shrimp, and a half 1 1/2 lb lobster and it was delicious. Definitely tasted like homemade pasta and the portion was perfect to split for two people that weren't that hungry. I feel the pricing for everything (fish, meat) were very reasonable, but the pastas were a bit on the expensive side. The dessert was AMAZING!

5253405,2012-07-31,2,qtc1YZix_5lHBJTZq7DOpA,"""Serviceable"" is probably the best way to describe Zeffirino. In a city stuffed with superior Italian restaurants, Zefferino falls squarely in the 'mediocre' category. That is not to say that it is poor by any means but at its price point and considering that it's in the Venetian, you should be expecting a lot more. 

Pros: 
* $22 prix-fixe for lunch is a great deal 
* the pasta dishes in general are fine 
* the view of the Gondolas does lend itself to a romantic occasion
* the musicians at the restaurant are very versatile and will perform songs in multiple languages 

Cons: 
* the food is simply not spectacular  and is easily outclassed by nearby restaurants such as Valentino, Postrio, and B and even Canaletto
* the prices are ridiculous. $28 for foie gras is more expensive than in top end steakhouse and only $2 cheaper than the infinitely classier Le Cirque; $20 cold cuts when you can get the exact same dish for 1/2 the price 5 minutes away at Enotecca Otto; $44 for a simple breaded veal dish that you can get for $20 in any neighboring Italian restaurant, etc....
* exceedingly small portions at the limited dinner prix-fixe (it costs the same as a single entree for good reason) 

There is better Italian to be found in the Venetian and in Vegas in general. The ambiance is pleasant and the musicians surprised me when they knew Croatian and Serbian folk songs but on the basis of food and service and especially value I simply cannot recommend Zefferino. An a la carte dinner with appetizer, desert, and a drink can easily cost $100, the same as the tasting menu at a great restaurant sage as SAGE or a fantastic steak dinner at any of the multitude of Sin City's red meat havens.",IOf-UvT_gfpP1c7s3HYx3Q,0,0,2,Q2pV-nqlI5Kbc6uf0wPO5w

They were totally okay with making it since the ingredients are still in house. The eggplant was melt in your mouth perfect! They remove the skins and bake layers of basil in with the dish.

So, on to dinner.  We had the seafood risotto and the spaghetti bolognese.  Bother were attrocious.  Neither of us to finished our plates.  We were less-than-stoked when the bill arrived.  We had spent $120 on a dinner that is worse than Bucca di Bepo.  Next time we're going to do some more research on restaurants.",2fpg__wLqwwRKlYjpxr7dg,0,0,1,OIme2Mk3dYZDFe1hD5ydOQ

We were at the Venetian and decide to eat there, at Zeffirino.
I guess things are little slow, because even without a reservation, we were seated immediately. 
They have a very nice bar and a good wine cellar (and some very nice ""by the glass"" selections.
We started with martini's (excellent, BTW). We shared a lobster/truffle ravioli special appetizer and Carin had Capon, stuffed with Prosciutto and black truffles, and I had Mediterranean Sea Bass.
Both were very good, the service was good (a little bit hovering, at times, but they were just trying to be nice), and the decor and ambiance were beautiful.
The only down checks for this place come from the fact that it's in a casino, so still that smell of cigarette smoke; almost $150 for the light dinner I just described (no dessert, BTW...we had late dessert at another place) and the sort of hovering service (I just don't need to have someone inquire if everything is ""wonderful"" after every second bite).

Our server was great.  He called my wife Miss (not mam).  He was pleasant.

The manager was very attentive.  He visited our table several times to check on us and even delivered part of the service himself.

Service was excellent. Food was very good.
Love the little carts they deliver the food on.

The insalata mista was great, delicious greens, nice touch with the pine nuts and raisins.  Very good salad.

And the bread was absolutely delicious, I mean incredibly delicious.  Nice and crusty with a couple of spread options, like a spinach butter and a regular butter for the bread.

My wife got the tagliatelle bolognese, which was excellent.  Just the right ratio of sauce to pasta, and a very fresh tasting pasta.  It was hot, too, but not too hot to eat.  Sometimes the bolognese dish at other restaurants you get a hot sauce but lukewarm pasta.  Not here, it was nice and hot all the way through.  And a delicious meat flavor.  This is just exactly how you want bolognese to taste.

I had the taglierini sorrentina and it was equally excellent.  Very fresh pasta, delicious red sauce, plain and simple but very satisfying and very tasty.

Also, they were very accommodating to our request to be seated with a view the canal/gondolas.  I thought that was great.

Lots of options in Vegas for Italian food.  This was an excellent choice.",p7xVTJMH4OJ2sRXdyl91_g,0,1,4,7E3D6iZxSdytYkPFRzUyzA

No he loves spending a fortune. Our last dining experience was on Easter. Before that it was on Christmas. Now I come from a culinary family so 1. I am a disecter of foods. I know what it should taste like and how they should achieve such tastes. Their food is MEDIOCRE at best. The filet is decent however like all of their meats, FLAVORLESS. Their desserts have to be the WORST Desserts in the History of Mankind! The men who hover close to the tables to make sure you always have a clean table, a full glass and anything you need ..well they just mainly stand there talking about the guests and their lives.. I think they think no one can hear them but it isnt the case. Their sea bass although drowned.in a sauce was decent. Tender n flakey and it had a good flavor. Their Salates station is decent as well however for the food that sticks to your bones F- ... I told my mom n dad next time the family wants to eat let's not spend $800+ on yucky food from here instead I and my chef brother will cook for the whole family.

For apps we had a family style cold cut platter w various meats, cheeses, olives and red roasted peppers. We also had a platter of fried calamari, shrimp and zucchini which the table shared, everything was good, no fireworks went off, they were just good. 
For some reason nothing on the menu really excited me. I was craving steak which they had a nice selection of. But the combos of steak w cheese and other combos which I felt were weird did not seem appetizing. I couldn't find just a steak. Maybe w some mushrooms. 
I opted for a grilled Black Sea Bass w mushrooms. A nice size portion and presentation was put in front of me, but BLAND is an understatement. It tasted like nothing. Because I was at a business meeting I opted to NOT send it back and eat a little more than half the dish. There was also no salt or pepper on the table which probably would've helped a great deal.

The bread basket arrived at our table with our beverage orders.  Warm bread with butter - what more could you ask?  Oh so much more!

We ordered -
- their lunch price fixe - which is quite reasonable - comes with an appy, entrée and dessert.  One had the fried zucchini and calamari, the other had the minestrone soup, entrées were the veal parmiagiana and some pasta special with red peppers and dessert with mini pastries.  
- also, the 3 of us ordered the Zuppa del Doge - Sautéed half of a 1  1/2 lb. Lobster, 1 Scallop, 2 Shrimps, Crab Meat, Asparagus, White Wine and Touch of Tomato Sauce - Very, very delicious!   I would order this again!
