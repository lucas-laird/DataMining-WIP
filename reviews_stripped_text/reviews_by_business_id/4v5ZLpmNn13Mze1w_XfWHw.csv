4789,2014-06-29,0,4v5ZLpmNn13Mze1w_XfWHw,"Mediocre food and lack of service ended with the waitress giving herself an 18% tip. While I have no issue with tipping I think:

1. They should try to earn the tip- she didn't. She brought one platter from the kitchen to the table and didn't even bother to refill out drinks as well as took 15 min to come back to collect my CC after she dumped the bill on the table. I asked if I could pay someone else and the staff told me no, I had to sit and wait for her to come back.

2. Because of the above, this was not a tip but a surcharge. The HD Cafe should warn that they charge 18% to have their servers bring you food.

Won't go back.

I had the shrimp fajitas, husband had the half order of ribs and then ordered a side of mashed potatoes, a girl in our group had the vegetable wrap, and the other two guys had ribs as well. Everyone pretty much agreed that there was nothing particularly remarkable about the food. It is what you would expect. For what you get, I honestly felt like it was over priced a bit. Shrimp fajitas were $20 for about 10 medium sized shrimp and some fried vegetables. Should have been priced lower at $15 for what it was. I asked for no cilantro but got it anyway so maybe I was already a little let down about that.

If you are into motorcycles, they have staged cycle with a blue screen behind it. Looks like you have to pay, but you could get your picture taken and then photoshopped onto the strip. That seemed kind of neat.

I think there are better places to eat in Las Vegas. If you want to go here to look at the memorabilia, that would certainly be satisfying, but you should skip the food in my opinion.",y28_1T_TjhRIPCpMSScFzQ,0,0,3,-X1bOTu67nSqdTzceP_w_A

165282,2015-07-23,0,4v5ZLpmNn13Mze1w_XfWHw,"I don't understand how this place has anything more than a one-star...... Absolutely awful! My husband and I eat out a lot.. And it sounds over-exaggerated but this restaurant is the worst we've ever been to!

Honestly, we only stopped in the first place because we were extremely thirsty and needed to get out of the sun.

We got seated quickly since it was basically empty.... I can now assume why. Especially at a time when they should have had a lunch rush.

We ordered onion rings and beef fajitas. The onion rings were the worst I've ever had. I honestly have a liking for bland food, but that crap took the cake. I got halfway through my second one and started feeling sick.

The beef fajitas you could tell came out of a pouch, the meat was dry and chewy and the vegetables had no flavor. At one point we asked for an extra 2 tortillas to try and finish it up and the waitress said ""I can't do that,they come in packs of 4"". EVEN IF THEY DO, she shouldn't have said that, she should have either of thrown away 2 or saved 2 for the next table that needed an extra 2.

The portions were so far off. The lettuce only lasted for 3 fajitas, the cheese for 4, the tortillas for 4, the meat & vegetable for about 7 or 8 (by the way, if you want extra tortillas you have to pay for them)

Don't even get me started on our waitress. She is hard to properly explain if you don't experience her in person.... Just awkward and unprofessional........ Stared at us after we got our food, like we should have invited her to join us, told us where we should sit in our booth, told us that the obvious container of BBQ sauce had BBQ sauce in it even though nothing we got needed BBQ sauce. After bringing us our food she didn't stop at our table for at least 30 minutes. At the end when we told her our onion rings were disgusting she said we needed to tell her at the beginning of our meal.. WE WOULD HAVE. SHE DIDNT CHECK ON US FOR OVER 30 MINUTES. I'm pretty sure as the customer we shouldn't have to chase her down, she should be checking on us.

All in all, worst restaurant experience ever. The smell of the place made my husband nauseous and it was freezing cold. The decor and ambience is tacky.

The waitress was really great about my dietary restrictions I thought at the time (now, I feel really unhappy after reading another Vegan review below - her waitress said the veggie burger did have dairy). The waitress told me the cook said the veggie burger had no dairy in it. They put the veggie burger on wheat bread. However, the veggie burger looked and tasted like no veggie burger I've ever seen or eaten. It was a thin pattie that looked and tasted exactly like a McDonald's or Burger King pattie - it's been three years since I ate meat, but I haven't forgotten the taste. I honestly believe this was a meat pattie because that's what it looked and tasted like. And if it was, that is so not right. After two bites, I was afraid to eat anymore for fear if it really was meat I would be physically ill. The waitress was accomodating and took it off the bill. Oh well, the fries were good.

Um pouco difícil de conseguir parar o carro, foi a unica situação na viagem inteira a que tivemos que recorrer a um estacionamento pago ($10 por 24 hrs)

A group of friends and I were in Vegas for New Year's and we decided to stop and eat a meal at the Harley Davidson Cafe.  The decor is kind of cool, and there's a place where you can sit on a Harley and have your picture taken.  

Our experience was below average. Our waitress, Angel, had the personality and IQ of a wet napkin. She came by the table a total of maybe 3 times?  Once for the order, once because we called her over, and then once for the check. 

The food was actually really good, with the exception of the barbeque chicken sandwich, which was small but still tasty.  Their barbeque sauces were delicious!  The beer however, especially the Bud Light, was flat and tasted like it had been left out all night.  But those things will happen.

I left my debit card at the restaurant and didn't realize it until I was already halfway down the strip in the other direction.  I called to see if I had left it at the table and our waitress said she hadn't seen anything.  I eventually went back in and asked the general manager if it had turned up.  He said he didn't think so, but he would check.  He definitely went above and beyond what I expected of him to check to see if my debit card was anywhere to be found.  Lo and behold, it was in the little black book that they use to present the bill.  Guess who left it there?  Me.  Guess who didn't notice that it was still there?  Angel.  Like I said...wet napkin.

1 star if I was voting just based on the service.
2 stars if I was voting based on the service and food.
3 stars because of the general manager who made it his goal to find my card.

Go there if you'd like, taste the barbeque sauce, but don't expect much for service.",3Q3Go6ux0IkXUhMip50rCQ,0,0,3,4kX97slXZuLAcoCjgTBqJw

I feel their TVs should be better and maybe a bit bigger, yet they aren't a sports bar so I understand why they don't have bigger and better TVs. The server was great, he came over right away to get my drink order and kept checking up on me. Overall what you really need in a server. 

The food was surprisingly good and big! I ordered the BBQ Chicken entree thinking it'd be a grilled breast...there was a lot on the menu so I didn't read the fine details.

We got seated by this huge wall of chains, which were caked in about 5 years of dust.  

Motorcycles are on a conveyor overhead, which was kind of cool I guess.  However, the service and food were average to a bit below average.  Your normal Hard Rock Cafe/Planet Hollywood type of fare -- but really nothing tasty about it.  The service was very slow as well....very few servers for a packed restaurant.

The booth belongs to a realty company. The salesmen lure you into the Harley Davidson cafe and to their booth with a sign outside advertising discounted show tickets. It turns out that to get the tickets, you have to go on a tour and hear a long sales pitch for a timeshare. My husband and I were interested in the tickets, and mildly interested in hearing the sales pitch, so we signed up, giving the salesman a $20 deposit to hold our place. The salesman guaranteed that we would be refunded the money even if we changed our minds about going on the tour.

Afterward, though, we decided it wasn't a good use of our limited time in Vegas, and neither of us really felt good about the salesman -- he smelled of alcohol at 10am and was inconsistent about how long the tour was going to take (as much as two hours plus travel, according to the receipt we were given, although he insisted it would take only an hour, or maybe 90 minutes...). 

While we were standing outside making this decision, we got briefly hassled by a weird older man who spat on the ground near where we were standing, but we didn't think much of it. My husband decided to go back by himself to get the refund while I watched from a distance, since the salesman had been giving us the hard sell and my husband anticipated having to argue with him. First the salesman tried to send him to New York New York for the refund, and when my husband continued to insist that he get the money back from the salesman, the salesman became increasingly upset and agitated, then suddenly threatening. Before long, a police officer had come over to supervise the situation, and another employee from the realty company appeared and tried to talk the salesman down: ""Don't do this, man, just give him back the money."" 

While all this was happening, the weird older man walked by me again and yelled something threatening at me about ""your (racial slur) friend"" -- which totally bewildered me until we realized later that he was referring to the salesman. I guess he thought we knew him. At length, the salesman finished yelling and swearing and threw the money in the street, so we did get our refund! Suffice it to say, though, that the whole thing left a bad taste in our mouths. I think we'll be avoiding that corner of the Strip for the rest of this trip.

The Harley Davidson cafe is...exactly as the name says, Harley Davidson through and through. A giant chain American Flag serves as the back drop for this American restaurant. Harley Davidson memorabilia all throughout the restaurant gives anyone ADD because you'll keep staring at everything here ahaha.

The prices are moderate, in the $10 - $25 range so it's not jacked up like everything else in Vegas where you'll pay $10 just for a hot dog and fries. 

""The Best BBQ in Vegas"" is what  they boast and at least for me, live up to the billing. I got the ""Wild Hog BBQ Plate"" which is a plate featuring the different meats in BBQ.

The pulled pork, ribs and chicken were all very tender. The ribs fell off the bone with a nice rub crust over the rib giving it a multi-dimension in flavor and texture. Chicken was very juicy and not dry like most places serve ""bbq chicken.""

I was super-hungry and I wasn't feeling ""bad to the bone"", so no, I didn't take a pic in front of that Harley. 

I ordered the southern fried chicken plate, and as one of the other reviewers noted, they really do give large portions. When I saw how much food was on my plate, I was almost overwhelmed, but in a good way. The fried chicken was pretty good, and I did like the mac & cheese that came with it. 

Our server was a pretty cool dude...I think his name was Andrew? He did a good job of checking up on us frequently and making sure everything was fine. I'd definitely check this place out again on my next trip to Vegas.",HnnGvz1PXm80V93fFU9lhA,0,0,4,rhvGRIBp2HOXx5N-1Cl5Lw

ACCESSIBILITY REVIEW
I remember coming here last August.  There were no signs of a wheelchair entrance, so I tried to get through the revolving door.  I got stuck and had to have help getting out.  Luckily, my wheels didn't break off.  I had a chat with the manager about that, and told him he needed some sign on there, indicating to go through the exit door or something.  He offered me a free dessert, but I was full after my dinner.  That's how I ended up getting in, and then out.  I didn't really pay too much to the restrooms, aside from just washing my hands from all the crap I picked up from pushing my wheelchair all over town.  I would assume just like any place though, the stalls absolutely suck and I'd have to lay on the floor to pull my damn pants up.  Seriously, if anyone can find any other creative ways of pulling their pants up, without standing up, do tell.

If I remember correctly, the exit door is locked from the outside.  They need to unlock it somehow, or put some automatic door on it.  I'm not the only disabled person that travels alone.  I mean, I don't expect someone to follow me around and do everything for me but for god sakes, this place could at least help me out by giving me a better door entrance.  I can handle the rest.

Had I rated this restaurant on accessibility, I'd give it an automatic fail, considering there were no wheelchair signs at the front of the restaurant.  Hopefully things have changed.  I'll check it out later this month when I got back.

RESTAURANT REVIEW
First of all, if there's a cheeseburger on the menu, I always get it.  The exception to that rule, is if a place is known for a certain item (i.e. steak, chicken, lobster, etc.).  I'm pretty picky about how I want my food cooked, unless it's a cheeseburger.  Long story short, figured I couldn't go wrong.  The server actually recommended it, too.  Having that said, I guess I had no choice, so I went for it.  Oh my Gosh...it was huge, and delicious!

I'd also asked for a recommendation on what to drink, there.  I don't get out a lot, so I asked my server again for advice on this.  I was told to try a Sin City, which is a special Las Vegas brew beer.  If I remember correctly, it was a light colored beer and had a good taste to it.

After eating and speaking to the manager about the whole wheelchair accessibility issue, I decided to explore around the restaurant.  Unfortunately, my memory is a bit fuzzy at this point, considering I went last August (see my review date).  What I do remember, are the motorcycles on the track around the inside of the restaurant, and just a whole lot of random pictures.

All in all, this place is worth checking out.  I actually found it by accident, as I did with a lot of things.  My computer decide to go south on me a week before I left last time, so I didn't get much of an opportunity to do my research.  I'm glad I came here.  Hopefully, I also opened up the mind of the manager in terms of providing better wheelchair access.",6LgWG72Sq9lnZGKSjJLx_Q,2,3,5,3uIUXvbi5yf1AHuv0r5bOg

Ein Besuch in Las Vegas beginnt oder endet (oder beides) zwangsläufig mit einem Besuch im Harley-Davidson-Cafe.
Vor 4 Jahren landeten wir nach einem schweißtreibenden Marsch den Strip rauf und runter zum ersten Mal hier, da draußen auf einer schier endlos hohen Säule geschrieben steht ""Best BBQ in town"" und wir eh schon ein wenig überfordert waren von und mit dieser gigantischen Stadt, die abends nur aus glitzernden und funkelnden Lichtern besteht. Das überdimensionale Motorrad, das förmlich aus der Fassade springt, tat sein Übriges, uns zu überzeugen.

Wie es sich in den USA gehört, wartet man artig, bis man zum Tisch geleitet wird - und dann weiß man schon fast gart nicht mehr, wohin man schauen soll. An schweren Ketten werden Harleys aller Bauarten und Jahrgänge durch das Restaurant gezogen und schweben sogar teilweise über die Köpfe der Gäste hinweg. Beeindruckend ist auch die amerikanische Flagge am Kopfende, die komplett aus Eisenketten besteht, die von der Decke hängen, diese Flagge ist geziert von der ""POW MIA""-Fahne, gewidmet all den Soldaten, die im Kriegsdienst gefangen oder vermisst werden (Prisoners Of War/Missing In Action). In der oberen Etage sind viele Bilder zu sehen und mit Unterschriften von mehr oder weniger berühmten Persönlichkeiten versehene Tankdeckel. Heiraten kann man hier auch :)

Aber nun zur Speisekarte: das Menu ist rustikal laminiert und hat uns erst einmal überfordert. Also bestellten wir bei unserem ersten Besuch den einfachsten Burger auf  der Karte - den Ultra Classic Burger. Als wir dann gefragt wurden, wie wir das Fleisch denn gerne hätte, zweifelte ich zunächst mal an meinen Englischkenntnissen, da mich bislang niemals gefragt hatte, wie ich denn meinen Burger gerne durchgebraten (oder auch nicht!) hätte. Der georderte Burger war gigantisch und ein Gedicht - fast wie in dieser Folge von How I met your mother, wo Marshall von dem einen Burger schwärmt, den er in seiner Anfangszeit in NY gegessen hat und dem keiner mehr das Wasser reichen konnte. Leider hielt der Burger bei unseren folgenden Besuchen auch nicht mehr das, was die Erinnerung versprach ;)

Alle Portionen sind hier nahezu riesig und kaum zu schaffen, wie z. B. die Wild Hog Biker Platte oder das Philly Cheese Steak. Die Sizzling Hot Fajitas werden mit allerlei Beilagen serviert und sind auch zu empfehlen. Das T-Bone Steak kostet zwar etwas mehr aber zergeht dafür auch auf der Zunge. Eigentlich ist auch alles immer lecker, aber wenn ich einen Punkt Abzug geben müsste, dann wäre es, weil es einfach zuviel ist... aber hey, wenn es das nicht wäre, würden unsere amerikanischen Freunde vermutlich Punkte abziehen, weil die Portionen nicht dem entsprechen, was sie gewohnt sind. 

Die Kellner sind immer flott und zuvorkommend. Mit der Restaurantrechnung bekommt man dann im angrenzenden Harley-Store 20% auf seinen Einkauf... vermutlich weil man eh eine neue, größere Garnitur Shirts benötigt, wenn man hier regelmäßig essen würde.",U9dEFm_cvhCEPe9i_TlnFw,2,1,5,CtGF2WHaTi_oxhMyh3nRiA

Ribs- were decent,, on par with ribs at fridays, chillis, etc
Pulled Pork-  decent nothing to write home about
chicken-  best meat on the plate, juicy tender but still ehhhh
brisket- total fail if it was brisket/ tasted different than the pulled pork so i dont know

burger--- ehhhh 
french toast- looked good,
turkey wrap- nice sized, but who messes up a wrap..

I beg to differ....

reason:

The BBQ ribs! As soon as we got our order of their ribs, just by looking at them it looked cheap/generic. Really? well the ribs were bland, poor rub, dry, the bbq sauce will just be coating on them, don't expect gourmet or anything special,  your taste buds won't get excited that's for sure. 

Ive been to many BBQ joints some are good,some are great and now this one Meh?! I knew what i was getting into before eatting them, the ribs looked dried up straight/lined hard and was covered with bbq sauce to conceal a mediocre slab maybe? I don't know? but i was very disappointed, I even tried adding extra bbq sauce to make it taste better but that did not helped at all, it'll do no good when the meat is dry.

Our server was another thing, all she did was took our order and served our order and left us hung to dry like dry Harley Davidson BBQ, so our water glasses were never refilled our entire time there. The photo guy came to our table more than the server did, and his job was just to take pictures not to follow-up how were doing? and we had to tell him we wanted to checkout and now came our server, bizzare!

I think motorcycles needs to separate away from food and vice-versa.
Yes Harleys are cool, there are Harelys rotating around above your head while your eatting cool? This joint dubbed Resturant/Museum? Keep it as a Museum only!

I tried some of the Veggie Fajitas that my sister ordered, and that was pretty tasty, too. Overall, the food was alright, but just a bit expensive.

What I really liked about this place was the decor which included displays of Harley-Davidson motorcycles swinging above our heads. Granted, I thought that the motorcycles could have, at any moment, fallen from their support ropes -- but all was good in the end.

I must say that the food was good.  I got the Fajita's because I saw it on another table.  I was impressed with the quality of food.  I didn't hear any complaints from the coworkers.  I'd go here again for sure and I hate to eat on the strip.  

It's also good for people watching.....",TvsPmBJt_Ei1RdOtVhjjiQ,0,0,3,LgnCLzdk0nRxzvz-697EBQ

I'ts not fine dining and it's not meant to cater to your every whim, so if that is what you are looking for you should probably be eating elsewhere,  Paris Casio is next door, perhaps you will find something in there you like.
If however you want some good ol' american burgers, hot wings or BBQ and a beer and a shot to wash it down or if you want to hang out in a cool motorcycle themed bar and grill then this is the place for you.  Since my fiancee and I arrived at the bar on my Harley looking for a beer and a bite to eat, you can guess we fall into the second category.  
Now normally i'm not much of one for touristy places and this certainly qualifies but I was willing to give it a shot considering that it is a Harley themed place and if nothing else I could pick up a poker chip for my collection.  But I'm happy to say that the beer was cold, and the shots were delicious even if they did come in souvenir glasses.  The hot wings and BBQ we had were perfectly spiced and hit the spot after a long days ride from Phoenix.  The staff was very friendly and attentive, something you don't normally find in a place like this.  They even have a guy that sits out in the parking lot to keep an eye on the motorcycles in the designated bike parking.  We didn't even need to lock up our helmets, a rarity in parking lots on the strip.
If you go, seriously, have the hot wings, they are amazing.",EYR6AI-BH__55ADdlkd9Uw,2,1,4,adz1llYJrEcEODav3FcBIA

If your really hungry get a mix platter, a little of everything. Every time I go to Vegas this is a first stop. Always starts Vegas off right, fill up on some nutrtious ribs for the next 4 days of drinking and partying cause the rest of the days your not even hungry! :) I love love love this cafe!",TVv2iLCJ2PjjgEKXIBZMRg,0,0,5,P7pLN4UJ-TyXFyiRZflBhw

I got grilled chicken, mashed potatoes, wedge cut fries, corn on the cob, and corn bread. And let me tell you I MADE myself try to finish all of it. Huge servings and we sat at the bar because of the long wait for the tables, so I can't describe the ambiance. We had a lot of fun at the bar because there was a bridal party, and by bridal I mean both bride and groom getting drunk with their parties. It was crazy fun! And our bartender was so helpful since it was my friends' and I's first time here, he was patient and helped us in what we thought sounded good and gave his two cents. I can't wait to go back to Vegas in the summer and this is top on my list for lunch/dinner places. Outside there's even a Harley so all the tourists can sit on it and snap some shots. HIGHLY recommended.",Hhc5iKV5CDoFLruTunY7YA,0,0,5,nsygK1zcv5nOI-xs4Rxtnw
