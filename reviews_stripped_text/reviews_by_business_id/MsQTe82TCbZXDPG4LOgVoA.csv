Please let me know if it goes back down. Why spend $9 on a medium sub & drink when there's all-you-can-eat sushi for $20 next-door?",Bo9t0rA22dOU34A7uNuFjQ,0,0,2,Mk85n5OW0FVBEH1q2JvJjg
1183620,2017-05-21,1,MsQTe82TCbZXDPG4LOgVoA,"Usually I love this place but today I was just disgusted. Normally I would have reviewed at least 4-5 stars but as of now they deserve 1-barely. 
I went in today and got my usual, veggie sub. I don't eat meat so I asked her kindly to wipe down the slicer so it wouldn't have pieces of meat when she cuts my cheese. She wiped it down (barely) but said she wiped it down right before I came in which I don't believe because it was COVERED in meat remnants. 

The topping bar was disgusting today. A lot of cross contamination happening which isn't rare when it comes to fast food but obviously they didn't care to clean it up.

Lastly I got my drink at the fountain, and right before I put my lid on my cup I noticed something black on a piece of ice. I took the ice out to inspect it and it was a big chunk of mold. I would post a picture of it but right when I was it I was disgusted and just dumped my drink and threw the cup away. The ice machine is supposed to be cleaned because mold can build up. This is sickening and can legitimately get people sick. Be aware if you are reading this that odds are they haven't cleaned their ice machine in a long ass time. Sorry port of subs, I used to love you especially this location but I call it quits.",XMV1L5NNButqMCxmWCFOkg,2,0,1,xID84smELzu7cRgSMAzlJQ

The girl that was working threw her knife down when she misheard me say that I'd like white bread.I think she needs to find a new job or be sent home. HER ATTITUDE SUCKS!!!

Not as nice as the Summerlin one, It was during a bit of a lunch rush. I felt bad for the staff, one lady was really rude (a customer) but the employees did their best with her demands.

Next in front of us was a space cadet looking chick, she pulled out a list of 6 orders, SO annoying! She couldn't read the hand writing of the peoples orders so stood there, called everyone and then go annoyed that the staff wasn't ""working fast enough"" 

When it was finally our turn to order, bread started to burn, so instead of making arrangements to her fan to blow the smoke out, she just opened the oven, smoke filled the room and made everyone's eyes water.

My wrap was made in haste, it was sloppy and came unwrapped. My husband's sub turn out okay. We'll be sticking with the summerlin location from now on.",uZ4z-4ftg7LbGR_blmZTow,3,1,3,eZ6xd9CyWhIu0CpxbxHhvw

3870422,2014-01-05,0,MsQTe82TCbZXDPG4LOgVoA,"This place is ok. Not too bad not too good. Sometimes u just get a craving for it. It's better than Capriotti's, or Jimmy John's. Not as good as Quiznos, or Jersey Mike's. About the same as Subway or Firehouse. I like that they slice the meats in front of you. That adds a nice touch. Everyone has always been super friendly. Even when I had my kids there, bouncing off the walls, the staff never gave me an evil eye, or even a bad comment. That makes them a 3.5 star, but u can't give half stars.",q5j3gxZbF_qCviRctL9wzg,1,0,3,qckYzx6R4tuoVOgcK-GNnA

My family used to frequent this location often as it is close to the house. However, something happened where they stopped cleaning things regularly  apparently. The last time I was in, I ordered then looked down at the grossly messy slicer with a variety of misc things on it and promptly cancelled my order.   I wouldn't have bothered with the review but it has been consistently a mess behind the counter when I have gone in and it's to the point where now if I want Port of Subs, it has to be a different location for me.",McDGTZ5J4ViG46PNrkPOfA,0,0,2,opJNYRAmc1afjvY-HgkaMA
4142753,2013-09-02,6,MsQTe82TCbZXDPG4LOgVoA,"This is an ok Port of Subs location.  My hubby loves Port of Subs, so we eat at them regularly all over town, whenever he gets the craving.  Some are yucky, some fantastic, but this location is right down the middle.  The staff at this location are very hit and miss.  Some are friendly and welcoming and some seem bothered you are making them work.  The store is clean, but looks like it needs a little refreshing with maybe a coat of paint or new flooring or something to update the interior.  

I am boring and always get the #1. I call it the Italian meat buffet because it is loaded with pepperoni, salami, capicolla, ham, and provolone on bread and it is fantastic.  I am drooling just thinking about it!  I am kind of anti-veggie, so I go with just the meat, cheese, pickles, extra mustard/mayo spread, and all of the seasonings.  It is tasty!

My hubby always get the #2, which is the turkey, ham, and cheese.  He loves it and is always a happy camper afterwards.  I guess we just know what we like!

I like how everything is sliced fresh for your order.  The veggies, even though I don't eat them, all look fresh and much nicer than the veggies at Subway.  The bread is always flaky and fresh and tastes great.  They always have a huge selection of sides as well with about 10 chip types, cookies, and brownies.  I am just happy with my jalape√±o chips though and really haven't tried the other items.  My hubby likes their cookies and brownies though and he gets at least 1 every time we are there.

Overall if you want a sandwich quick, this is a great location to grab one and go.",8DBH3BpLINfTAK_Up5BtUQ,10,9,3,sQe-eJrY8k-LUfom77_NMg

When he started adding things I didn't ask for he argued with me that I did. Only asked for mayo and onions,  he wad putting lettuce, pickles, tomatoes. He wanted to argue with me so I left. Won't return. Too nany other Port of Subs in the area.",H7bJDtGzhdg1fsmBL4KZWg,0,0,1,kdB3BbycgOl8K2EecbMr6A
