Anyway, We order. Service was good. 
The food? Was ok. The broth had no flavor. Noodle was... ok.  I was there with 7 other people and they all said the broth had no flavor. 
The loud lady gave us free soda. We dont drink soda so that was wasteful. She gave us free egg rolls. Egg rolls were good. 
I was hoping they had great pho since the restaurant was bright, spacious(although too many tables.. making the seats tight), and plenty of parking. But since food was soso I dont know if I would go back as there are other pho's around the area.",liMJGDTgxvGrry1AVuvdGA,1,0,3,rSd9DVt-3v1ZHHD1_jQWMQ

928259,2017-10-11,1,2g_auUWw7c3c2CUTgVqI8Q,"It's Annie! Yes, it's true, Annie is here, providing a definitive answer to the question, ""What's the best pho place in Vegas?""

The food here is better even than her previous establishment, Pho Annie, and the place is bigger and nicer. The pho is magnificent, and then you can branch out to some of the other wonderful dishes on offer.

The regular beef pho is great. If you get tendon, they are properly cooked, not overly tough like at some places. The rare steak is said on the menu to be filet mignon, and I assume it is because you can tell the difference from other places.

Getting past the beef pho, other dishes of note include the roast duck noodle soup (mi vit quay), which is so good I make little noises while eating it. It's made with egg noodles by default, but I prefer it with rice noodles (which makes it pho vit quay, I guess). You have to be careful of the bones, though, and above-average chopstick skills are helpful.

The beef stew noodle soup (hu tieu bo kho) is similarly wonderful. I've had this at various places around town and this one is ahead by a mile.

They offer a BBQ pork noodle soup (hu tieu-mixa xiu) that you don't find elsewhere and it is great.

The chicken curry noodle soup (hu tieu ca-ri ga) is pretty great and is good for variety from the usual chicken pho (which is also very good here).

And of course the bun bo hue is superior as well. That's the famous spicy beef stew that comes with pig's feet and a cube of congealed pig's blood.

If that one annoying friend is with you, they offer a vegetarian pho. Lots of places make a vegetable pho but use beef or chicken broth. The vegetable pho is so good that I get it myself sometimes, and I'm a certified carnivore.

For shrimp pho... honestly, go to WTPho for that.  I hate to say it, but Annie isn't the best at absolutely everything.

Service is better than you usually find at Vietnamese places... if you go to pho places you know what I mean. Often Annie herself will come by to ask if everything is okay. But you sometimes have to flag down a waiter to get your check when you're finished.

Sodas are refillable, not brought in a can.

It's safe to say this is my favorite restaurant right now.",JV0asALxmnJGmnfrHul0tg,2,1,5,gq7EJoIfYAAGwvKZTcKfBw

They never took our order for more than 10 minutes. Mind you the restaurant is not busy at all.   We finally order our pho and they bring us soggy nasty looking bean sprouts and basil. Looked as if they washed customers old ones and reused them. We ask for new ones and it took over 20 minutes. We were already done and wanted our check. Everyone in my party was disappointed. They even messed up on our drinks we ordered. IT NEVER CAME.  Horrible horrible service and quality !!!! Never gonna come back again!!!! Beware!!!!

Lack of umami, nuance in the broth, etc. Did I catch them on an off day? I knew I wasn't making up things when a companion asked to try my soup and was surprised at how unremarkable it was. He had ordered the bun noodles with egg rolls and while it tasted good, the crust of the egg rolls were dry and not crispy enough. Service was ok, but nothing spectacular even though we were one of three tables there. Lots of seating but that lime green wall color has gotta go. The entire experience has my scratching my heads and doing a double-take to make sure I went to the same restaurant everyone seems to be raving about. I would like to come back for another try but the pho was so disappointing and there are so many other competition out there I haven't even visited yet so a return trip is unfortunately unlikely.",oEqB6qGiV2K3q8g2A8rfYA,1,1,2,cEAGkL9Tpy6G4KhtC6dm8g

Everything was bland, especially the bun no hue, which is the most flavourful noodle dish on a typical Vietnamese menu. I would recommend any of the other 2-3 Vietnamese restaurants up and down Rainbow for Vietnamese food.

1981823,2017-12-06,0,2g_auUWw7c3c2CUTgVqI8Q,"I am genuinely surprised with all the good review for this place. Came here after church my with my family for lunch. Most of us got the special pho and my dad got the stir fried beef with fried rice (bo luc lac). Service was efficient enough, waitress was friendly and took our orders quickly. 

First of the place did not smell like a pho restaurant at all, when you walk into other restaurants (like Saigon 8) you are slapped in the face with the smell of broth and when you leave you smell like a delicious bowl of pho. This place smelled like nothing...which is a bad sign. The broth had no pho smell at all and it was so so very sweet. Not sure if they used MSG or sugar but it was gross, I squeezed 3 big pieces of limes, tons of hoisin and siracha and it was still too sweet to enjoy. For pho dac biet they should have a better variety of meats, they had beef balls and slices of beef, that's it! 

My dad said his bo luc lac was good so I will take his word for it but it was way overpriced. I think it was either $12 or $13 for the dish but he wanted fried rice and they charged an extra $4 or $5 or fried rice, the dish ended up being $17. Are you serious?!

I still think its reasonable though and they have refillable sodas (instead of the can) which my bf can appreciate.",Oi0G3jFm2jtG2W02dZTdEQ,5,2,4,PcbIhND_p-lR2ANWDFET7A

We ordered:
- Spring Rolls
- Pork Chop Rice Plate with egg
- Beef pho

After a couple of months of not eating Annie's recipe, we felt like we were in heaven! Her Pork Chop recipe was so good and has lots of flavors. The Spring Rolls was very delicious.

We used to think it was only a nice substitution to China Town for its location, but now that Pho Saigon 8 is open, you can really tell the difference. Remember, PHO 88 is the NEW NAME. So excited for what's happening in the Southwest! I predicted (well hoped) that this area would be the new Asian food enclave. It's looking GOOD! Must try at the NEW Pho 88 aka Annie!!

You can smell a bit of fish sauce in it but the taste is great. The chicken taste great. There's bits of peanuts and it adds crunch to it.

Their chicken fried rice is good enough for like five people. So much food for $9.99. I think it's needs more soy sauce because the meat is overwhelming. Other than that, it's good. Basic fried rice.

The spring roll is good for four people. It's $5.99. There's a hint of mint in it that you notice right away is there and stays in your mouth but not that powerful where you're like eating toothpaste. It's good. More vegetables than there is shrimp. 

The Special 88 Beef noodle soup for $9.99 is good. The beef is nice and thin but has some weird texture after you chew on it. The broth is good - it's a bit sweet. The noodle is a bit hard as if it hasn't been cooked long enough which is good because I don't like my noodles to be soggy and soft.

I ordered #17 rare steak and brisket pho.
The noodles were inconsistent, some thick and flat others thin. I was confused.
Also was asked twice if I needed a fork, while I was using chopsticks... 
did they think I was using chopsticks wrong or something? 
The broth was okay, not the best or the worst. 
Service was good, never had empty water. 
Biggest issue was halfway through eating a strong smell of sewage leaked into the restaurant and I had to push away my bowl and rush paying to get out of the bad smell. 
Saw staff members spraying the place to try to get rid of the smell so idk what's going on with the building.
May not be their fault.
I honestly would have gave 4 stars if it wasn't for the inconsistent and confusing noodles I got in my pho.

Service:  Very friendly staff that got us seated immediately with smiles.  The servers kept my diet Cokes fresh and I worked my way through the food.  The kitchen got our food to us quickly and was prepped well.

Pho & then some: Dining with my God-daughter, parents and bros ensures we get to try a lot dishes.  I had the #12 otherwise known as the Special 88 Beef Noodle Soup Pho Dac Biet.  Great broth that compliments the tasty noodles and beef.  Lots of noodles and beef ensured it would be hard to finish this tasty bowl of Pho. Great stuff
The pork chops with egg was very good.  Cooked and seasoned well and the eggs complimented the flavor  
The egg rolls were as good as you'd find in any Pho joint but the chicken wings were my favorite non-pho dish. Lots of flavor and you got a lot of wings for the order.  Great value in price and flavor and something I'll have again.

Ambiance:  Green walls and contemporary lighting make for a bright and pleasant dining area in a very large open area.  Red Asian decorations, and art line the wall and floor plants throughout the room.  There are lots of tables and chairs in the center with big booths along the wall.  I don't think there'd be an issue with a wait even on the busiest of nights with this much seating and quick service.

Pho 88 just became my favorite casual Pho restaurant on the Southwest side of town.  I love the fact that even the non-Pho dishes were great along with the Pho to give me more options when visit.

The broth had a definite fish sauce aroma at first. Fortunately, that didn't translate into being too salty. The one thing I usually don't enjoy about BBH is that the noodles are larger and more slippery. Pho 88's BBH noodles were easy to pick up and slurp.

So my quick review is that if you enjoyed Pho Annie, you'll enjoy Pho 88. The advantage is that this location is much bigger and more open. (Annie used to get pretty full).",YwaKGmRNnSa3R3N4Hf9jLw,3,1,4,vN7pvTOWPdP3V0nshWmRVg

In Vegas, it's really hard to find a decent Pho place (District One Oxtail Pho is probably my favorite but it's hard to justify $14 a bowl for more than a special occasion).  

You're not really coming here for the ambiance, or service.  You're coming here for a pho fix.  It's definitely not the best I've ever had, but for the proximity to my place, the price, and the quantity, it's hard to find better.

Service was very quick, staff is very friendly as well.  Got the spicy Beef Soup (one draw back here was they did not give the mint and basil leaves). I would have given five stars if those were included, not sure if maybe they don't serve it, but traditionally that is what I am used to and what makes the soup, but all in all very good.  Also got Vermicelli noodles with egg roll, always a favorite.

Tried something I had never had before Che Ba Mau (Three color dessert with agar agar, beans, condensed milk and ice) different, but it was very tasty and a nice cool treat in the Vegas heat.

The price here is typical of a Pho place, most dishes under $10.00, I would recommend this spot and would come back again.

We ordered:  

Spring rolls
2 Pho Specials
Vietnamese Ice Coffee

Everything was decent.  Spring rolls was great, nice portions.  We tend to eat with nuoc mau dip instead of the actual dip for this dish because I'm allergic to peanuts.  The nuoc mau is very sweet.  This must be a thing in Las Vegas.  I think cutting down on sugar and adding fresh lime juice would be great.  Pho broth was good, it's flavorful...but on the sweet side which is a little weird.  It could only be two things, sugar or a lot of MSG.  I don't remember my parents ever adding sugar to pho.  So I'm lending towards MSG, I could be wrong.  Both isn't so great.  I personally don't like sweet in my entrees.  Vietnamese Ice Coffee was very tasty, but again it's on the too sweet side.  I would give them a 5 stars if these little tips are fixed.  =P

I know the owners are not Yelpers much based on no responses from other negative reviews but here goes.

I walked in to have lunch before I did my errands and the restaurant had 4 other tables. One a group of 4 Vietnamese, 2 Filipinos, a Vietnamese couple with their less than 1 year old child and a solo Asian man whose background I could not discern.

She seemed perturbed that I interrupted her meal while there were other tables in the middle of getting their meals. 

As she sat me, she literally threw the fork on the table on top of the napkin that she placed before the fork. I know the difference between placing silverware down gently on the table, rushing to finish setting and throwing it down. She threw it down. I DID NOT EVEN ASK FOR A FORK!! Previous servers who have waited on my table never even did this to me before. 

As she shuffled away from my booth in her house slippers to check her other tables her attitude did a whole 180 turn around. She went to the group of 4 Vietnamese customers and she started talking to them and laughing with them. Even joking and smiling. She then went to the table with Vietnamese couple wth a baby and she started cooing at the baby. Then she returns to my table and asks what I want. I placed my order and said I'll keep the menu since I was still debating about dessert..

When she dropped the duck noodle soup I ordered I had to force myself to eat it because I did not want to walk out. Definitely not the best way to start my day. As the Filipino couple left, she said her goodbyes and even said ""salamat!"" ..... really?

Go there if u have to but you will be in for disappointment. There are better places in las vegas that have better service.

When the basil and bean sprouts came out they were all wilted and brown on both plates there were four of us.  I glanced around and everyone else had nice green ones.  Nice fresh basil is a must for pho.  So I asked if we could have better basil.  I saw the guy take it to the back and brought back picked off wilted leaves just rinsed again and there was bug eaten leaves.  I was like really wtf.

Second problem, this place has a bad fruit fly problem. I saw one fruit fly and thought maybe it was just the one...until I saw another then another then another. It was so bad I had to cover my soda with a napkin. The server asked me if my soda was ok and I told him there were fruit flies so I covered it, and as I was telling him this, one flew onto my egg roll lettuce and I told him I was not eating the egg rolls.

Portion was on the small end for the soup and I was given 6 shrimps in my soup (other pho places range from 10-12 at least.) They have one size for pho so if you'd like to order extra expect to pay extra. However, the pork plate was beautiful I could say that. The presentation was amazing and to have soup and an egg with it tops off the dish! I'd order that if I decide to come back. The lady who worked there was super nice but I had to ask our servers to keep filling up our drinks, why have servers when I have to walk up to them to get water myself?

Tables were generously set with sauces and utensils except for the typical forks and regular dining spoons, which is okay. Their soup spoons have the hooks on the end to prevent them from sinking into your large bowl, i love these spoons!

We ordered a thai tea which arrived in a to-go cup, although we were dining in and it had a sticker marked with yesterday's date. i'm going to assume this thai tea was made yesterday. as a customer, i'd like to have things fresh, made that day. or the sticker could've been a ""sell by"" date which would've been worse. if you're gonna give me something dated yesterday, be courteous and take the sticker off..

The Pho Tai is made with filet mignon with wider than regular noodles, the broth is not what I am used to but still really good.

Yes, Annie is back and better than ever!!!",S3MlswjY_q9OkRydT_Em3Q,0,0,5,PJ1_0YtwFXCY34YC--_iCA

walking in.. i could tell that most of the people eating there didn't like waiting to get seated either.. so i was relieved.. 

me and the wife and the baby came in.. got greeted.. told us to go where everybody was not.. maybe because we got a baby.. and he was crying at the time.. so i guess being considerate of others.. we were cast away for everyone else.. jk.. maybe coincidence...

anyways.. the place was bigger than what it looked like from the outside.. very spacious and very clean... i see the waitors walking around really fast and moving fast and working hard... all that good stuff.. 

got seated.. felt uncomfortable because as soon as we sat.. a lady came and started asking if were ready to order... pause! can i get a menu first and some waters.. and maybe a high chair.. ? 

placed our order.. i got the pho dac biet.. *special / combination... and wifey got a vermicelli.. 

food came out fairy quick.. and we then commenced in partaking our food... 

average.. typical pho place... price was about the same as any other pho place ( like across the street ).. 

noodle : broth comparison was good.. 

ill be back if the restaurant next door is an hour or two wait again.. lol",A0Sy2srGc-AhXEuFoErDkw,0,0,3,dnR-G2ZBn04FRCVktySDfA

I'm not sure if it's because we went in 20 min before close since we weren't paying attention to what time it was, but the brisket that came with our pho was completely dry. In fact, I would have preferred them to have turned us away saying they're closing. The food also came out really fast, like under 8 min. We also got an order of spring rolls on top of 2 orders of rare meat and brisket pho. I asked if it only comes with shrimp as the only option and the guy answered saying it comes with meat too. I'm allergic to shrimp, so I told him just to have meat and NO shrimp in it (stating my allergy). He nodded and told me he understood (twice). When we got home, much to my disappointment, they completely disregarded the mention of my allergy and only had shrimp in the spring rolls. Maybe there was a miscommunication, even when I stated no shrimp twice? The restaurant was closed before we got home so there was nothing I can really do about it. It felt like a complete waste of 5.99 when no one else at home eats spring rolls. On top of that during payment, the paper that had our order written on it stated something like 24.95. The 4 was written sloppy, but the man who took our order confirmed it being 24. He proceeded to call over another lady who told us is not 24, but 25. I didn't want to fight them on just a dollar, but imagine if they added an extra dollar to every bill? Perhaps if we would have gone during a different time, service wouldn't have been so rushed and terrible.",FbZlmtrfaVsGTkKqSyRlCw,0,0,1,26zB48efiLC2taQ13rcrwA

Remind me of home cooked Vietnamese meals! They also have a great vegetarian selection too, which I really appreciated because some places don't have that many vegetarian options on their menu. The colors and atmosphere in the restaurant is really clean and welcoming. I will for sure be back!",UaM_AyJlcxHssYFnuS27OQ,0,0,5,ojk1HeNHYF8T4OMoatArQw
5848090,2017-07-05,0,2g_auUWw7c3c2CUTgVqI8Q,A must try if you are a Pho lover! This place is fairly new and located in the Southwest. The owner use to own Annie Pho but sold the business and took her cook with her. The portions are large and the food is fresh and delicious!,ZtWi1WgfiiBlKmBA8VS4NQ,0,0,5,JHujm0FbecY5kCBPvShHIQ
5881074,2017-09-10,0,2g_auUWw7c3c2CUTgVqI8Q,"Former owner of Pho Annie.  Food is delicious as always.  They upgraded their steak for pho soup to filet mignon and the price is still the same.  This time my husband had their grill prawn with Vermicelli noodle and my son and I had Hong Kong style noodle.  Like always, the food is always on point.  

This time we didn't order their garlicky, buttery chicken wing but it is something to think about for those who loves chicken wing.  

Their sate (homemade hot sauce) is one of the many reason why we keep coming back here.  No other place in town have the same hot sauce like theirs.",RHh-Z07179OFerbCbM1QpQ,1,0,5,8DaZIpFuBnVyVWUMNExbyw

Coming in, we realized the hostess was a Chinese Vietnamese lady. We ordered Pho Dac Biet #12 and Pho Cari ga #22. 

I got a little disappointed right away looking at our side veggies plate. We were the first guests in the morning and were served super cold and old basils with a lot of black dots. Not fresh or good at all. I bet they gave us the defrosted frozen basil from the day before. 

But the pho and curry came so we decided to enjoy them to the fullest. Sadly, after three spoons of soup, I felt really sick. I am an MSG detector by nature. In another word, I am allergic to MSG. And yep, this place seems to have MSG in their broth. My head is spinning around writing this review and I feel super drained. The meat in the pho was good tho. 

Definitely not coming back to this ""best pho in town"" restaurant. Ever.",e992HTjVMb60p47pCkgj5Q,3,0,1,HO6badLs59UIlMSf37W0IQ

The server came and gave us waters and gave us a few minutes to decide what to order. I decided on phone with beef balls and egg rolls. My husband got a Number 57 spicy beef noodle soup or Bun Bo hue. 

The soups came out first then the appetizer egg rolls came out a few minutes after. I didn't particularly enjoy the flavor of the soup when comparing it to other pho restaurants. I added a lot of hoisin sauce and Sriracha and had to add more throughout my entire meal because of the lack of flavor. My husband seemed to enjoy his soup and ate it all which was good. The egg rolls were good but I wish they would've cake out first so I could enjoy them hot and fresh before my meal instead of in between bites of my pho. I ended up just eating my portion of the egg rolls after I was finished with my soup and by the time I was done they were not really warm anymore.",P0rGN5mDue55uIiAzkrRlw,0,0,3,nJUeb3EeE-vagrol8rBXqA
