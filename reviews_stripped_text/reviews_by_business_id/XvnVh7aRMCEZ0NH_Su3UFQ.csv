1318743,2014-10-13,0,XvnVh7aRMCEZ0NH_Su3UFQ,This is located inside Greenland supermarket. Went there to try their samgyetang or chicken ginseng soup. It took about 15 minutes for the food to come out. I felt it was a bit long since food court is supposed to be selling items that are quick to serve. The taste and freshness of the side dishes could be better. The chicken ginseng soup was decent. I felt I was getting healthier and stronger. It is one of the Korean dishes that boosts your stamina.,Nhp4YAFbMJYU3gFZCDxYeA,0,0,4,-IWbkoHC3OKXYsBZ2tvgwA

2658235,2014-05-26,2,XvnVh7aRMCEZ0NH_Su3UFQ,Stopped by for lunch before shopping at Greenland Market.  Got the spicy mackaral and the spicy nangmyun.  The mackaral was ok but a bit pricey for the number of pieces you got.  The nangmyun was a miss. Noodles should be a nice al dente but was over cooked and the the sauce was lackluster there was very little veg.  The side dishes were decent.,qbq4zC9SrZuaQ4-J-wtRuw,3,2,3,vNRiUVJO1PVaa2ZgMSAemg

The Spicy Beef Soup (Yukaejang) had a good mount of kick in it.  Phenomenal flavor with that amount of heat.  I must have been really hungry because i was still eating the soup with the accompany rice, and they gave me a generous amount of fixings.

2nd time around my bowl was less filled with the usual green onions, gosari, brisket, glass noodles, and eggs.  It's ok since i had a rough start earlier at a neighboring food vendor.  Soup was still kickass though.

A-OK in my book. 3.5/5",pDvDLpD7CiMlIebsDPCRSQ,8,6,4,1Sjlgjk8JaG4kW_oPqcF5g
