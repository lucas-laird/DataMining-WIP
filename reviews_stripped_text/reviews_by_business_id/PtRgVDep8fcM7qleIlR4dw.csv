We know what it means to strive for customer satisfaction, and I'm more than happy to give a great Yelp review when it's well deserved!! I first met Steven months ago when he came around to the office on a Friday afternoon letting us know he had BBQ. Once I tried it, I was hooked! My favorites are the brisket, hot links, and mac & cheese. Absolutely delicious food, and Steven's smile and upbeat personality make it just that much better. 
We got lunch from Holy Smoke BBQ last Friday for a company meeting & to celebrate my birthday (10 of us). Everyone was well fed and enjoyed it thoroughly!",XHFdEd7ySDOv9ufd23CUhQ,1,0,5,rG0ibZ41-UowaPYRuZRmUw

""It's all over Town""

The newest fashion in town for the dining crowd is Gourmet lunch wagons. I grew up with lunch wagons when I worked on the docks in Brooklyn and over in Newark. They were a way of life. This is how hard-working longshoremen got hot, fresh made, comfort foods to keep up their strength and keep them warm or cool inside as they threw around 200 lb. sacks of coffee beans like they were tissues.
In California and across the mud in New York, these wagons and trucks have evolved into just about every kind of food style in the world. Here in Las Vegas I have become acquainted with Steven, who operates HolySmoke - ""On Site BBQ"".  His Nephew Lee assists his Uncle' with the methods used for old smoke taste and smooth BBQ sauce. They drive around to certain spots each day to sell off what they have smoked the night before and in the morning. Their big white pick-up truck pulls along a trailer with a very large steam cabinet where all the smoked goodies are still gathering up extra smoky BBQ flavor.
You can find out were they will be stopping during the day or where they are headed next by giving Steven a call at (702) 773-8654. The menu is usually Brisket, Pork Ribs, chicken or a hot link dinner at $8.00 with two sides and a dinner roll. If you are one of the lucky ones, Steven may have turkey legs or turkey wings on the trailer that day. That is probably the best BBQ meal I have ever eaten. The Guys also have Pulled Pork, Hot link, Brisket, and Chicken Sandwiches for $6.00. There is always Mac and Cheese that is better than your Mama ever made, Greens, Baked Beans, and Potato Salad. As a side with a sandwich your choice is $2.00 a serving. Two sides come with the dinner. They will also offer you napkins and the old knife, fork, and spoon picnic pack so it is truly an anywhere meal. Steven changes things around sometimes to keep everyone on their toes. He will also talk with you about special requests. 
While you are out around town all day give Steven and Lee a call. They will make arrangements to be somewhere that you can meet them during their daily run. You won't be sorry. This is really fine home made BBQ with smooth luscious sauce.

My hair stylist was excited that he was there...so I had to try it. I haven't found really good BBQ since moving to Vegas, so I'm always willing to try a new place.

I ordered half ribs and half brisket with a side of Mac & Cheese. It was the best Mac& Cheese I have EVER had!! It was delicious! The ribs and brisket were both very good and the BBQ sauce made it even better. Not only is the food good, but Steven (the owner) is very friendly! Prices are low too! 

1/2 ribs, 1/2 brisket, 2 side= $10


Delicious!

Not only was the meat perfectly tender and juicy, but the beans, oh my god the beans. Talk about perfection. On top of the delicious food, the service I received was beyond 5 stars. I was offered a sample while working and was told he could bring the food into me at my convenience but I didn't take advantage assuming that I would be able to catch him outside and take a look at my options. Unfortunately for me as I was walking out of the building Steven was pulling away. He saw me though, and as I expressed my sadness in missing my opportunity. He so kindly and without hesitation pulled over and prepared me the dish of my choosing. He was so gracious and even gave me a small story of how he got started. I would recommend Holy Smoke BBQ to ANYONE and EVERYONE! My heart and my belly were so full! Thank you again for your extremely generous service!",LWJedJf7la5iS6n-oRBRhQ,2,1,5,KmfeZmzS1EVooTt5IMwG-Q

I had their pulled pork, mac and cheese, and bbq chicken legs and it was all very good. The chicken legs were moist, flavorful, and not soaked in bbq sauce. Had a good smokey flavor to it. The pulled pork was tender and the bbq sauce that came on the side added extra saucy goodness. The dinner roll that came with the meal was just ok though. Was kind of hoping for more of a homemade or buttery dinner roll, but it was plain. No big deal cause the bbq is their seller. I really liked the mac and cheese though. It was very cheesy and creamy. So good with the pulled pork. They also had baked beans for the side as an option. It smelled and looked really good, but I had a full plate going on already. Next time I'll give it a try. Overall, pretty good bbq, great set up at the event, and would give their actual restaurant a visit after trying out their food.",yyDp7MZ2st7p0fOQuFYpcA,2,1,4,TFDljo77YGj3I2e9Q3ehfg
