35455,2011-04-02,0,KOPittXGiS_CpoAYdPpqGQ,"The bf and I both had the tasting menu. 

The soups were disappointing. I had the sweet corn and boy had the hot and sour. I was super excited for my soup and it tasted like nothing. Literally, nothing. I could barely taste the corn. I then tried my boy's soup and it was too sour for me.

The main course was alright. It was beef, chicken, and lobster. The beef was very tender but like another reviewer said, it's covered in teriyaki sauce. Paired with the other items, this ended up being too sweet for me. I actually preferred the chicken more. How can I ever have Panda Express Orange Chicken after having this stuff? And you know you love Panda's Orange Chicken!!! Anywho, Pearl made their chicken mm mm good. I can't say much about the lobster since I rarely eat it. All I know is that the bf said that it wasn't high quality and he was disappointed in the lobster.

*I forgot to mention that their fried rice was the best I have ever had! Rice cooked to perfection with baby broccoli and other vegetables I didn't care about. Baby broccoli! Woo! 

The dessert was a tiny chocolate raspberry cake and it sure hit the spot. I didn't *love* it, but it was good. 

Good service, could be better but no real complaints. 

I will say that at the end of a long filled gambling Vegas day there is nothing like a cozy romantic dinner with your partner in crime to smooth over a spanking at the tables. We were seated at a booth and while they were super comfy, my baby was like 4 feet across from me. I felt like we were in the Grand Canyon of booths. So if you are looking for a romantic dinner out, go somewhere else. I think it's a good place for groups though.

I enjoyed my dinner there but probably won't go back if it were up to me.",n2xGqfJOdUXuzGqY1tCUGQ,0,0,3,i6U7ZHyCCVRcqFiKLSBXHg

The ribs were okay at best, but the dumplings were great. For dinner we had the Mongolian beef, shrimp and scallops, peppercorn tenderloin, lo mein, and broccoli. Everything was really good.

Ok, I get it.  Vegas is expensive.  Sure, fine, no problem, I can deal with it; so long as I'm getting something great for my money.  The problem with Pearl, is that I wasn't amazed, impressed, or surprised by anything.

Came with my wife and her sister.  We ordered spring rolls, dumpling sampler, and minced shrimp (lettuce wraps) for apps.  Spring rolls were good, but basic.  Dumplings were good, but there were only 3 of them.  3?  Really?  Isn't it like $10 for those 3 dumplings?  The shrimp lettuce wraps were good, but i was surprised they came with iceberg lettuce and not bib, or something a little nicer.  Again, this is supposed to be high end stuff, isn't it?

We ordered 3 entree's and shared.  Some sort of shrimp and some sort of chicken, can't ever remember names or specifics because they were boring.  Paid $25-$30 each, same stuff could be got at PF Chang's for $12-$15 and twice the amount of food.  Ordered the one duck entree on the menu and was informed that it was a cold dish and more of an appetizer style, server offered to make an off menu hot duck dish; this ended up as the one highlight out of the entrees.

Split some cheesecake for dessert, above average.

The restaurant is beautiful.  The service is fantastic.  But the food falls a bit short.  The simple fact is; this is Vegas, one of the highest concentrations of high end dining in the world.  Several of the best dishes I have ever eaten were had in this town; but none of them at Pearl, not even close.",OwWH5NpCMncuNstZbbsX_Q,1,0,3,DlZFgYp1Oj7ze5Hg7NWCQw

505865,2012-09-27,0,KOPittXGiS_CpoAYdPpqGQ,"Yeah, it is pricey.  Yeah, they charge you $5 for white rice, and $5 for a 7 ounce soda (but it comes in an aluminum can).  However, I have never been disappointed here.  The service is always great.  It is attentive, and the staff works well as a team.  The dining room is beautiful and striking.  And, I always like to visit the restrooms, just because they are so nice.  Think of them as the Forbidden City of bathrooms.  Only the elite get to go in.

So, for $200 you can do a lot of damage.  Delicious, sweet damage.  Let me start off by telling you, if you haven't gotten the Spider Prawn dumplings, you are doing your taste buds and injustice.  These hot morsels are full of shrimp.  They are crispy on the outside and well seasoned on the inside.  I dream of these at night.  I seriously do.

If you like soup, they have two that are delish.  Or, as my counterpart said when she took a taste...Ahmahzing.  The Seafood wonton is good.  It has a large prawn and a diver scallop.  There is also some baby bok choy on top of the rich and flavorful broth.  

The other soup you should try is the corn chowder with crab.  Not what I would consider Chinese, but wow.  Rich, sweet, and the whole crab claw sticking out of the soup is fresh and succulent.

So, what are the items I always get when i order my meal?  Other than the appetizer stuff?  I always get the shrimp with fresh berries and candied nuts.  The menu description does not do it justice.  My description will not do it justice.  Everyone I bring comments on how it doesn't sound that good, but that they will trust me.  When it comes out, they love it.  The dish is served with crispy, fried shrimp, candied nuts, a mixture of fresh berries (strawberries, blackberries, blueberries, and raspberries...sadly no snozzberries), pineapple, and... mayonnaise.  Trust me.  It's the bomb.

The beef with ginger and scallion is also quite tasty.  The meat is tender, the sauce is rich, just watch out for an unexpected large chunk of ginger every now and then.  

The crab fried rice is a very mild rice.  The crab is shredded throughout the dish and it is very light.  Egg whites are used instead of the whole egg.  I usually add a dash of soy to this for my tastes.  

I have been warned about the clay pot meals not being that great.  Also, the one time we ordered the crispy garlic chicken, it became a ""Never Again.""  Especially at these prices.  Also, I have not yet had a dessert here that I enjoyed.  They were beautiful to look at, but didn't deliver on the taste.

The restaurant has geoduck (pronounced gooey duck).  Think of an oversized clam.  This runs about $200 per serving and is a specialty.  It is way overpriced here.

517426,2011-10-13,0,KOPittXGiS_CpoAYdPpqGQ,"The food and service here were very good. I've been eating chinese food since I was 11 and this was one of the best meals chinese or otherwise i've ever eaten. The service is great, I noticed some negative reviews saying all the people that work here barely speak english. I think that would be a good thing since it is a CHINESE restaurant. Most other negative reviews cite that its sooo expensive. Did they mention this place is in the middle of the MGM grand in Las Vegas the freaking McDonald's is expensive in there. One last negative review said the food wasn't greasy enough lol. Well, anyway I had the tasting menu that is for a minimum of 2 people for $50 per person which I split with a friend. The starters were a barbecue spare rib and a spring roll. The dinner was almond crusted chicken, fried rice, steamed vegetables, and mongolian beef. I would give the spare rib and the mongolian beef a 4 out of 5, and everything else a 5. One of my other friends ordered the general tsos chicken. Which IMO was the best meal of the night. It wasn't super greasy like usual it was almost light and the sauce was great. Bottom line if you're in Vegas and don't want to spend money on food good luck.

We went here wanting some good chinese food, without shelling out our entire mortgage payment for the other fancy chinese place here in MGM. So glad we did. Has to be some of the best food Ive ever had. I really wanted the General Tso's chicken, but I cant ever eat it because I cant have even slightly spicy food. I mentioned this and the waiter said ""we will make it for you, not spicy at all"". So you can tell here everything is made from scratch! And it was delicious!!

853206,2014-10-22,1,KOPittXGiS_CpoAYdPpqGQ,"For us Chinese the 80th Birthday is one of the most important milestones in a person's life, and it is the most important time for children to honor their parents.  After looking at the venues and depth of menus at other restaurants on the Las Vegas Strip, I chose PEARL at the MGM Grand to host my Dad's 80th Birthday.  Beth Miller in Sales was beyond exceptional in conveying what I wanted to Chef Yau.  But, it was Chef Yau's clean and delicate touch with the each dish that took the night. Among the traditional eight dishes ordered, we started with Chef's elegant spider prawns. They were deserving of the rave reviews online plus some.  The prawns were ever-so lightly deep-fried that the batter crumbled and was a superb counter to the firm, meaty prawn.  The Chinese five spice squab arrived lightly browned & perfectly seasoned so as not to overwhelm the tender bird.  We were immediately reminded of past trips to Hong Kong just for squab!  Chef prepared bell peppers with Mongolian beef that was tangy, colorful and had hints of a seasoning we went crazy, trying to decipher.  The special Birthday whole lobster i-mein noodles were sinful and slurpy but neither soggy nor gooey.  But, the stand-out was one Chef Yau specially-created for the birthday.  He prepared a winter melon dish with Chinese black mushrooms and Virginia ham.  It was presented in an unusual way, almost layered in a clear chicken broth.  Light, fully reminiscent of Cantonese cooking.  Everyone of us, gourmands from NYC to DC to SF to Honolulu, felt every dish stood on its own merits.  And, my aunt--who taught Asian cuisine for 20 years at the California Culinary Academy--said simply that Chef had created a ""well-balanced"" banquet--the mark of an expert Chinese Chef.  Finally, Pearl complimented the food with the perfect wait staff--warm and intuitive about what our guests needed without asking.  Chef Yau and Pearl created a truly memorable experience for our Dad's 80th !",HW4xd31nKu7JPIv0QIe6CQ,1,1,5,8A1qDJ-9P5SKhE_sXg-Ewg

971249,2011-01-27,0,KOPittXGiS_CpoAYdPpqGQ,"A group of my Arbonne sisters and I came to Pearl on a Wednesday evening after a busy day of conferencing. Learning can make you hungry! The venue is very beautiful and surprisingly small (unless there is some secret back room I did not see). 

I immediately noticed that the menu looked very Americanized, so while the other girls were selecting familiar ""safe"" items that they have had before at other Chinese restaurants, I asked our waiter two questions; what is your favorite menu item, and what is the most authentic Chinese dish? He pointed out the Black Pepper Tenderloin and the Scallops as his favorite dishes and the Braised Pork and Preserved Vegetables as the most authentic Chinese. 

I placed an order of Singapore Noodles for the table (one of my FAVORITE dishes) and with out hesitation, I went for the Braised Pork and Preserved Vegetables. Our waiter warned me that the dish was pretty ""fatty"" but I was OK with that because I know that where there is fat, there is flavor! 

All dishes ordered looked beautiful on our plates, and service was friendly, attentive and prompt. Everyone enjoyed their meal immensely, and I turned some of the girls into Singapore Noodle fans. I love making people step out of their easy and safe dining boxes! 

As for my Braised Pork and Preserved Vegetables. YUUUUUUUMMMMMM! I was very impressed. The vegetables had an expected bitty vinegar-ness to them and the meat was EXTREMELY tender and flavorful. The slices were kind of thick so I was worried about eating them with a chopstick, but the meat was so tender that it fell apart in my mount and was not difficult to eat. I definitely recommend this dish, but as the waiter stated, be warned that it is fatty so don't order if you don't mind it.

The sweet and sour soup had a wonderfully playful flavor while the corn soup tasted as fresh as corn on the cob!  Our entrees were the best-- general tsao chicken which was light and overly breaded but all white meat. Incredible. The Kung pao chicken with macadamia nuts packed flavor and a punch at the end.

I would have rather had Chinese food from local joint at home, paid them what I paid here at Pearl, and would have had a better experience and given them 2-3 stars.

Unfortunately, every place I have eaten at MGM for dinner has been a 1star.

Gourmet Chinese food sounded good and it was in the hotel/casino(MGM) that we were staying in.  Why not?  I made a reservation on opentable.com and boom.  It was set.

Very lovely colors inside, red with very plain walls.  They could definitely use a little artwork on the walls, maybe they'd like to commission me.  :-)  heh heh

The preset Valentine menu looked excellent, so we both got that.  

First came the very good soups.  Hot and Sour, very hot and very sour.  Nice!  Not just a cleaver name.  The Corn Crab Chowder wasn't bad either.  It's their specialty apparently.  The main meal of Wok-Fried Spiny Lobster tail and Black Pepper Tenderloin Beef, along side a favorite General Tso's Chicken and Vegetable Fried Rice.  Now If you know me, I went straight for that beef.  WOW!!  It melted in my mouth.  It was like the cow was on crack, and this was the meat that was made from that crack cow.  It was sooo good!!!  About Medium Rare, wonderful flavor on the sauce, and high quality tenderloin.  I would just order this next time I went.  Then came the Lobster....tender, sweet, not overcooked and chewy.  Very nice.  The General Tso's chicken was tasty as expected, not a difficult thing to make I think as well as the vegetable fried rice.

Now the best part.  DESSERT!! 
Raspberries Chocolate Soft Cake and little cups of a champagne strawberry gelatin concoction.  They both were perfect, but that Soft Cake was amazing.  My girlfriend and I were stuffed but this kept getting shoveled and savored into our mouths like we had just sat down.  The smooth texture of the moist cake dissolved in the mouth as the top thicker raspberry mousse like chocolate candy melted away with a strong natural raspberry flavor.  It was perfect.  All accompanied by white chocolate decorations and accented syrups on the plate.  This was nice.  No...This was perfect!

Not a cheap price at $79 a person, but then again, this was no panda express.  The only reason it didn't get 5 stars was because although being a very tasty meal, the price was a little high.  Vegas fine dinning needs to step down about 10-20 dollars for me to continue to eat out.

With that said... order the Chef Tasting Menu. It is a bit more.. but if you are like me and have had Chinese food in China then you'll be cravin' a challenge and a twist to the Asian taste.

The selections on our tasting menu were absolutely delicious. There were about 6 courses that included a chicken lettuce wrap, dumplings and spare ribs, crab fried rice, egg drop soup, beef tenderloin (MY FAV) and a selection of desserts.

Tagged along with one of my high school friends and her high-rolling family, and... wow. They're regulars whenever they're in Vegas and get superb service & food.  We dined there twice when we stayed at the MGM Grand.

It was a bit overwhelming for me... I mean look at my other reviews, I DEFINITELY I do happy hour and use student discounts ;)

I suspect they ordered ""off-menu"", because the dishes were more authentic and traditional and my friend's parents did not need menus. Really, there were dishes that you would get at a great Chinese restaurant in Monterey Park or Irvine. Some stand out dishes:

The starter soup was savory, the broth flavorful but not overwhelming, highlighted with vegetables and occasional chunks of beef.

The whole cod was delicious, an abundance of fresh cilantro and green onions on top of the fish's flesh, and enough hot oil ladled on top to flavor the whole dish, but not so much to make it greasy.

A claypot was served with fish and mushrooms in a light sauce. The mushrooms were hearty and the fish was delicate and flaked, the two contrasting textures brought together by the brown sauce it was cooked in.

Braised pork belly was SOOO good. Melt-in-your-mouth pork buried under  herbs, spices, and I believe steeped in tea. Extremely flavorful! My favorite dish by far, and it was one of the simplest. Something you indulge in sparingly, but hey, you're in vegas, right?

I dined with my friend's family in the back rooms, and we took up a large table seating over a dozen people. The area was still decorated nicely like the rest of the restaurant, but just the sizes and energy of the parties changed the atmosphere, as if I was in a Chinese neighborhood restaurants with pink tablecloth and cheap off-white chopsticks. I wouldn't be able to say the same for the front rooms. Vegas prices, but with a more relaxed crowd.",tyuudUj9llzIQXPe6HyV6w,1,1,4,tUPv4HA-jJkZ7pVTNkmbug

The first two appetizers were followed by a second plate of a pot sticker and honey glazed ribs.  Our main course was spice scallops and wok fried pepper tenderloin that came out hot and fresh.  Which now days it is very unusual to have your food much hotter than the serving dish since so many places not reheat their entrees.

While most of our time was spent in the casinos and lounging poolside, we did take some time to enjoy some of the most amazing food in Vegas. Though I'm not a huge fan of chinese food, Pearl was one of the best restaurants I've ever been to.

The food: Absolutely amazing. We split a chef's tasting menu as well as an additional entree (thankfully, they didn't charge shared plate fees), which was great in itself because normally if one person gets the tasting menu, your whole table is in. Every single item that came to our table was top notch. Even the water tasted better! If I didn't know better, I'd say they were drugging us to like the food. The chocolate lava raspberry something kind of cake with gold garnishment at the top was to die for. I was extremely stuffed at the end of the meal, but I would've napped and eaten dinner #2 there if the restaurant wasn't closing for the evening.

The Service: Some of the most attentive staff I've ever experienced. I've been in top restaurants where the servers are over-the-top attentive, practically feeding you your food and never leaving your side. I'm not a fan of that level of service, but Pearl was the perfect balance; allowing you to converse with your dinner group while still always having full drinks and plates cleared. 

The Bill: Was a little pricey, but worth every dime. I think we had two drinks each, a shared appetizer, the tasting platter and entree, and shared dessert, and it cost us about $100 each.

Hands down best chinese Ive been to in LV. Heres why:

Service was on point, very attentive but not too smothering 

Appearance was very nice, dimly lit clean with some characteristics of a traditional chinese restaurant Id find out here in the city. 

Food was AMAZING! 

Dim sum sampler was fantastic but a tiny bit greasy (im just spoiled with the hundreds of dim sum places nearby my house so with these ive become picky)
The BBQ Spareribs were perfect

The almond lemon chicken was amazing, buuuuut

the highlight of everything was the black peppered tenderloin 

dammmmnn

Ordered 'medium well', these 4 perfectly cooked steaks were presented beautifully and were worthy of being served at the nearby more expensive 60 dollar plate 'craftsteak' . If you ever go to the MGM and want to check out somewhere for dinner... Pearl is the place. 

I tend not to go to the same place twice while im in vegas b/c i want to try as many places as possible with the overload of choices, but with Pearl, im def.  going to make an exception

I think it is kind of unnecessary to compare this Canton and Shanghai Chinese cuisine to most of Chinese restaurants. This restaurant is in MGM Grand hotel, they can't have very authentic Chinese food here, because there is not too many Non Chinese people like real Chinese food. 

The seating and decor is comfy and classic. The food is fairly delicious for Americanized Chinese food. I recommend simple dishes like hot and sour soup, Macadamia Nut Kang Pao Chicken, Honey-Glazed Barbecued Spare Ribs, Fire-roasted Mongolian Beef, Wok-Fried Shrimp with Szechuan Chili Sauce. Skip live seafood, they are obviously over priced at a hotel restaurant, you can get better taste for the similar dishes at any regular Chinese restaurant. 

Not a bad place for a casual lunch or dinner, the bill is from $70-100 if you don't order live seafood dishes. $100 plus with alcohol beverages.",-8EnCioUmDygAbsYZmTeRQ,1,1,3,7WhUPGJyibiTOgq6Ol--eg

2985803,2013-02-19,0,KOPittXGiS_CpoAYdPpqGQ,"I will have to say this place impressed me more than I thought it would. Being that it is in the MGM (not predominantly Asian as is the Caesars Palace and Bellagio), I expected an overpriced version of P.F. Chang's. I shouldn't have assumed. In addition to the usual orange chicken and bbq pork, Pearl has taken very traditional Chinese fare and put the typical American twist on it. We ordered the Spicy on Spicy which is a staple dish that I order at all Chinese restaurants if it is on the menu. I can usually judge the restaurant by it's Spicy on Spicy. At Pearl, it was delicious but not as spicy as it should have been. It was the American version, but still great. We also ordered the kobe beef in sweet and sour sauce. Kobe beef is kobe beef: tender, melt-in-your-mouth goodness. Slather on some sweet & sour sauce and you've got a kicked up version of sweet n sour beef. We also ordered the spinach sauteed in garlic which was cooked to perfection. There was just a little crunch left in the spinach and loads of garlic flavor. We also had the soup of the day which was mostly some vegetables in a pork broth. This is a restaurant I would definitely go back to. Keep in mind, it is fairly pricy. The kobe beef was $130 and there was enough on the dish for 5 people to have one small slice. I would still say that Jasmine's (Bellagio) versions of the same dishes are FAR superior.",F0nR2cEBLSZtBb2hlxnpoA,1,0,4,HHMEz5Y1e-eTEJ7BhNkAgw

HELL to the ya!  We were in Vegas for the weekend to see Jimmy Buffett (awesome freakin' concert btw).  We were relaxing in out hotel room trying to decide on an scrumptious dinner to enjoy.  I made the poor man eat so much fast and greasy food this trip that I wanted to make it up to him with a delicious sit down meal.  The dilemma was finding a place near the concert that took reservations.  VOILA, the combination of good yelp reviews and the fact that Pearl took reservations was the perfect storm of deliciousness for our dinner.

We started with the fried crab claws from the appetizer menu.  So freaking amazingly delicious I had to steal one of the man's as well.  For dinner we shared an order of Almond-Crusted Lemon Chicken and Lobster Fried Rice.... yep, you read that right, Lobster Fried Rice!!!!!   

The Almond-Crusted Lemon Chicken was so amazing.... the sweet and sour flavor of the glaze combined with the texture and crunch of the almond crust put me in Almond-Crusted Lemon Heaven, ya I said it!  The Lobster Fried Rice was the perfect companion.  It was a large portion of rice perfectly cooked, not overdone or underdone.  Lobster chunks spread all throughout.  I'm sure someone will complain that they wanted more Lobster, but I had flavor in just about every bite so I was a happy camper.  Once we were done with our meal, we strolled the hallway down to the concert in mere moments.

If you are seeing a show at the Grand Garden Arena OR KA this place is perfectly located near both.  The prices are a little steep, but in my opinion completely justified by the service, ambiance, quality, flavor and convenience.",ypewwof4Ab4gxZyIaDgzAw,1,1,5,dVqr1whfKDUjZDmOxsTpcQ

My uncle, cousin, and I grabbed dinner here after I had spent an entire day wrangling the children (boy aged 3.5 and girl aged 1.5) with their parents (my cousins).  Oh, it was the best babysitting reward I could have asked for!

To start, I ordered the Seafood Wor Wonton Soup.  My uncle ordered the Dungeness Crab and Sweet corn Chowder.  My cousin ordered the Shark Fin Soup (although not on the menu -- the price probably would have scared everyone half to death anyway).  All delicious.

We then ordered for the table: Pan-Seared Fillet of Sea Bass with Spring Onion, Fried Rice with Barbecued Pork and Shrimp, and Beef Brisket and Turnips (claypot).  I'd do almost anything for a delicious claypot and this one did not disappoint.  The fried rice was pretty standard (and my standards are fairly high).

We learned a valuable lesson:  this is not the way to chose a restaurant!  The reason why there was no wait here was because the overpriced food isn't all that great!

I only gave this restaurant 2 stars because the food is the same quality if not less than the typical Chinese restaurant close to home, except you pay 5 times more!  We got the group special, which included 2 appetizers and 3 main entrees for $49/person.  No dessert.  That's reason enough not to get this group dinner.  Secondly, the fried rice that came as an entree was exactly the same as I would make it at home express style.  Meaning, rice, a bit of soy sauce, and throw in some frozen peas/carrots/etc. and ta DA!  NOT impressed.  The only thing I thought was up to par was the almond chicken, which had a sweet & sour type of sauce under sliced chicken coated with crunchy almonds.  The rest of the dishes were mediocre, at best.

The highlight of my dinner here was that a table of gentlemen across the room bought my girlfriends and I a round of cocktails.  That's how memorable this place was if this is the highlight of my night!  The atmosphere was pretty posh, as with most fancy restaurants in Vegas, and the service was excellent, both of which are the reasons why I gave this rating so many stars.  But overall, I would say PASS on this restaurant unless you have lots of money to spend on so-so quality Chinese food.

Pearl is beautiful.  Very typical of a nice hotel restaurant;  dark, sexy,, and
inviting.
The food is quite good.  American-Chinese, not authentic Chinese. 
They're catering to rich Americans here, not rich Asians.    There's
another restaurant if you are that aformentioned RICH Asian; name slips me at the moment -- I'll update should I remember it.

and to my taste the food at the Pearl was supurb.

Thinking I would try the summer tasting menu that included the spiney lobster tail,  I quickly changed to Chef Yau's tasting menu once I looked over the menu.

The tasting menu included prawn dumpling and minced chicken in lettuce wrap to get the meal off to a terrific start. 
The main course was a wok - fried beef tenderloin with scallops. 
The scallops were in a sauce that was just amazing - it made the shellfish just melt in your mouth.
I do not know how it could have been prepared better.

The only odd feature of the meal was that the tasting menu listed a variety of ""french"" pasteries for dessert.
The cake was the same one provided to the summer tasting menu ...
It just seemed odd after such a wonderful meal featuring so many flavorful chinese dishes.

When making a reservation they answered in 3 rings and I was put on hold.  They did a good job referring to my name throughout the reservation and asked where I was staying and if I were interested in any shows or other dining options (within MGM of course).

Upon arrival, my friend and I were greeted by the hostess and who I think was the manager, but both weren't wearing any nametags.  When we were seated the hostess didn't converse with us, but I didn't feel like it was rude or anything either.  The ambiance of the restaurant is really nice.  There's large booths along with tables that are well spaced from each other.  The lighting is medium to low and they tables are set with nice decor.

He came back within 15 minutes and recommended that we try the spider prawns and wines that would go with the meal.  We ordered the spider prawns, lobster fried rice, crispy garlic chicken, honey walnut prawns and dessert (along with white wine).  

Food came within 15 minutes and the server entertainingly showed us how to eat the spider prawns.  He came back within 5 minutes to check up on us to see if we were doing ok and enjoying the spider prawns.  The rest of the food followed promptly and was served by our server along with another.

The honey walnut prawns were AMAZING.  A beautiful presentation also with blackberries, raspberries, and pineapple.  I could eat that all day.  The lobster fried rice was good and not too dry or salty, while the chicken was moist and flavorful.  Again within 15 minutes our server came back and asked how I dinner was and refilled our drinks.  We ate, and I was pretty darn full, granted we did order 4 dishes for the two of us though.  They came and cleared our dishes promptly and offered coffee for our dessert.

The experience at this restaurant was great.  It was definitely geared toward the trendy and expensive side of people and I don't know if I'd ever pay this much for Chinese food again, but it was quite the experience.  Service was excellent also.  I'd recommend if you had some cash to blow on pretty good food and presentation (albeit Chinese) to give it a shot.  As far as their audit went, they scored pretty well and they're still there!",NFM0QH6X3vQCsXYry4j63g,4,1,4,KyhdyQzZGh_lG0EMve9MOg
4562275,2013-10-21,0,KOPittXGiS_CpoAYdPpqGQ,"Meh! Really average Chinese food. Slightly better than a takeout. For example, ordered sweet and sour pork tenderloin and it was tough and vinegary. Also, it is hugely expensive here.
However, my low rating is because of their snooty attitude, particularly towards the kids. They didn't actually say anything, but we felt uncomfortable having the kids here. just not terribly welcoming compared to all the other eateries we've tried at the MGM.",N2g-CvioqgVCWtF6vPzKBw,0,0,2,ItaSeEsAkHby_SlphLo4xA

We went with the family style #1 the ribs were very tender and the crab spring rolls were quite tasty as well. I enjoyed the almond chicken more than the beef tenderloin.

Somehow he managed to get all the crap genes in the family and they thought it'd be a waste to bring a seven year old (who's also severely allergic to seafood) to a $50+ seafood buffet. Wait was substantial. Atmosphere was cozy, Pearl turned out to be smaller than I expected. If I remember correctly they served sushi, but it was labeled as a Chinese restaurant. Whatever. Our waitress was nice and apologetic when I had to send my brother's plate of ribs back. They were sprinkled in peanuts. Something else he's deathly allergic too. If I had been twenty-one at the time and sitting with some cute guy instead of my little brother who kept insisting on using his chopsticks as part of some impromptu drum set, I'm sure this review would have been more interesting.

The lobster tail was perfectly done and had a different taste to it which was some sauce they had put on top. Steak was better than average, but the other items outshined it. Dessert was great as well. Not pleased with Martinis... had 4 different ones between 2 of us and didn't like any of them. Went with the Sapporo. Dinner was $49 per person plus drinks and tip.

Had the orange peel beef, and the moo shu also. Plus the shrimp and pork fried rice (now THAT was overpriced...$17 for a plate of rice with like three tiny shrimp, and like five tiny pieces of pork).

Everyone keeps commenting on how pricey the place is, but if I recall, dinner for 2 was usually around $100. I feel like for Vegas, that's normal but apparently I have a screwed up sense of reality maybe?

Favorites include Spider Prawn Dumplings, Dim Sum platter, DUngeness Crab and Sweet corn soup, and many of the beef dishes. 

Yes, it's an upscale PF Changs. No it's not authentic! This is nice ""gourmet"" chinese food in a trendy modern environment. Service is typically excellent and the quality of food is great. 

I love it because it's a *nice* place to have dinner in Vegas without completely breaking the bank. A great date spot or good for groups too. It's nice inside but it's not overly loud and you don't feel like you're eating in a nightclub.",kmE8w5Y785eZmodsx0V6Ag,1,0,4,7FM91BFi9I6y7xuZCPnBNg

They have really great, fresh tasting Chinese cuisine and the thing to get here is the Peking Duck!!! I love Peking duck and this place hands down has the best Peking duck that i have ever had. The carve the duck table side and serve it with this thin rice paper...almost like a crepe. Different than other typical Chinese restaurants.

5362458,2012-12-09,0,KOPittXGiS_CpoAYdPpqGQ,"Went here last night with my mom and my husband.  Generally I found the food to be pretty overpriced for the quality.  We had their Seafood Wor Wonton Soup,  Steamed Half Chicken with Garlic Sauce, Tofu and Salted Fish Claypot, and a Thai Eggplant dish.  

The $10 wonton soup was especially disappointing, what I would expect to receive from a take-out fast food place.  The scallop and shrimp both did not taste fresh, the two little wontons were barely filled with meat, the broth was bland, and the wrap was too thick.   I enjoyed the half chicken but I feel like for $30 they should offer a full chicken.  It was seasoned well and very tender/juicy.  The tofu claypot dish was also enjoyable but pretty small.  I liked the consistency of their tofu and that the amount salted fish wasn't overwhelming.  Finally, the eggplant dish was just...bad.  It was smothered in sweet and sour sauce and was overpoweringly sweet.  I would not order that dish again...Pearl should try to make it with oil, Thai basil, garlic, red pepper flakes, and salt.  

It took a while to get the food but I was actually pleasantly surprised at their service.  Our waiter was very attentive and friendly.  The decor/ambiance of the restaurant is also nice.  

P.S. Their jasmine pearl tea is good, it actually tasted exactly like the jasmine pearl tea that Rishi Tea offers.  My only nitpick is that the tea was too strong...I suspect the water was too hot and/or they used too many pearls.  But unfortunately this is pretty common for most restaurants that serves tea.",zpc--HAuQXvZ_vEaNvBrwg,0,0,3,308mSD0f0bjCMdzYelAr-g

(Dang, there better be shaved 100 black truffle casino chips mixed in there).

I concur with all the other reviewers here.  It is expensive for what you get.

I would take hole in the wall chinese food over white table cloth chinese food any day of the week but location wise however, they really got you since there aren't that many other chinese/asian food options nearby.  (The northern side of the strip near the Venetian and any of the Wynn properties will give you more options for Asian food choices).

I guess it wouldn't hurt so much if I could take the chinese leftovers back to my room, but with the ultra sensitive mini bar, there was no way I could maneuver my take out containers in the sea of overpriced mini bottles of liquor.

I'd expected some high quality Chinese food but instead I ended up having Panda Express like food for $$$$ price. 

1) They charge $8 for bottled water; No wonder they didn't even tell me about regular water option and kept asking me if I want more bottled water. 
2) Wanting to try some of the chef's special, I ordered two of their spring tasting menu which is $50/person. Their food serving timing was way off. After having the starter, corn soup, my party had to wait 10 min to get the next entry. The main dish was one small lobster and pieces of beef and chicken lined up on one big plate. The lobster and beef was decent, but the chicken was comparable to the orange chicken from Panda Express.

The dessert was good though. With two glasses of wine which is $10/person and tips, the final bill was $150 for two people. My girlfriend even said we should tell them their food sucks. In summary, I recommend you to opt for other better restaurants in Vegas or just get decent priced entries since this restaurant is no special.",4STgFLIUuKja6Y4U8k1LiQ,0,0,1,ZjxbEKMy5EwBMNg3h8Nlsg

The Kung Pao had no ""pow,"" the Mongolian Beef was bland, and the $9 hot and sour soup was good, but that's not good enough for a small bowl of soup that cost $9.

The only points I can give this place is for its ambiance and large wine list. But for the food, keep walking. Better yet, take a cab to a real restaurant off the strip.",lFPqHl7PTOISNi3ullegmA,1,0,2,_u4K-v2-DUifkbHGWvsbCw
