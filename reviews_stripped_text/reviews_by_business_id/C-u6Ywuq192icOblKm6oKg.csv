15235,2013-11-30,0,C-u6Ywuq192icOblKm6oKg,Worth the trip! The service was great and the menu is very thoughtful. More of an experience than a meal. I have a sneaky suspicion this place can be hit or miss though. Half the items ordered I would order again. The other half just missed the mark or were more sensation than tastation. A few pieces of meat were too fatty to eat and the other half were making us moan. Don't let the parking lot/location scare you. This is Vegas. Many talented chefs come here and open hole in the wall gems to get their names out there.,0EGTsE7UQiS6CuW2uQLh9A,0,0,4,sP87941lQEWhYC9DBHN0fQ

A creative menu without getting overly cute, and everything was done well and nicely presented.  It's an odd location, but don't let that fool you.  It's well worth going a little out of the way to enjoy some interesting small plates-style dining.

Sticky Bun Tacos: 3 - 3 ""tacos"" wrapped in a soft doughy bread filled with pork belly. Dipped in ginger soy. They were very tasty. However, nothing special.

Nachos O'Brien - 4 - Very good! Got these towards the end of my meal, and was already pretty stuffed...but I couldn't stop eating these. The house potato chips were awesome, and smothered in pork and cheese. What more could a guy ask for?

Tiger Cry: - 5 - Thai Beef Jerky! I would have never ordered this had the waitress not recommended it. I like beef jerky, but why would I order it at a restaurant...for $9. Needless to say, it was the best thing I ate all night! Very tasty, tender, and full of flavor.

Smokey Poke: 4 - I love Ahi Tuna, and make it a point to order it from any menu I see. This was definitely a very unique twist on Ahi Poke. It was full of flavor, and drowning in a smokey, citrus sauce. 

Dragon Claws: 5 - A jalapeno popper stuffed with cheese and tuna?!?! Once again, not sure I would have ordered this had the waitress not recommended it. They were delicious, and had great presentation. Just the right amount of spice that could be put out with a cold beer. 

Brulee Salmon Skewers: 3 - The salmon skewers were just OK. They may have been better if I didn't already eat a bunch of really good food, but the salmon was tasty and smokey. Good flavor, but extremely loaded with salt!

Coack-A-Waffle-Doo - 5 - This dish was excellent. A fluffy belgian waffle served with a piece of corn flake crusted fried chicken on top, along with a blueberry reduction syrup. Sweet and salty perfection!

Overall, I give this restaurant a 4. I think they could have used one more waitress on the floor. A little slow at times with drinks, and checking on us...and it wasn't very crowded. 

I can't wait to go back, and try some other dishes...and get more Tiger Cry!",hlSH4Q_xZOqMiruKyA7xpA,3,2,4,6si9jdMCNP45k01sVYft8A

The location is not ideal, but the food is absolutely perfect! It's tapas style, so you're encouraged to share, or to order a few plates for yourself.

I had the Caesar Salad, which was actually a very large portion. The corn was bathed in cheese and herbs, making it juicy and delicious. The beef was tender and well seasoned.

I haven't tried the Dr. Pepper ribs, but I hear they are amazing. I will have them for my next trip, because I will definitely be back for a next trip.

The location is small, and I imagine it can get crowded in the evenings. We went for lunch so it wasn't a problem. The service was also a little slow, again not too bad at lunch, but can cause issues if the place is packed.

I know they are the new kids on the block, so I'm giving them a bit of leeway. I'm hoping they work out the technical issues fast because the food definitely has no issues at all.",I3XJNDCe50zG7ddKDCDqAA,0,0,4,BWl5XNWy38SScO_vItxekA

I LOVE tapas...I mean LOVE...and when my husband suggested Nosh and Swig for a date night I started racking my thoughts...working in the food and beverage industry I hear EVERYTHING about new restaurants...and after much racking I vaguely remember a coworker describing it as delicious...so I figured we'd give it a go...but not before confirming that it had a great review via yelp...so away we went tonight..WOW!!! I can only describe the delicious menu combinations as a little slices of heaven...we were greeted promptly by Ashleigh and the ordering began right away because we were starving...she assured us we made yummy decisions and the journey began...we had the following:

Blueberry Mint Lemonade
Cucumber Lemonade (2)
Spicy Endamame
Lottsa Mozza
Paella
Pescado Torta
Pork Tacos
Korean Chicken Wings
Happy Ending Dessert

Insane...and the attention to the smallest details in food preparation excites me...and they nailed it...from the perfectly spicy Kimchi on the wings to the delicious slaw on the pescado torta...Nosh and Swig doesn't miss a beat...the service was great (props to Ashleigh) and it was nice to see what I'm assuming was the manager on the floor helping out...(props to owners who care!) The set list performed by Jessica Manalo (the in house entertainment) could've kept my attention for decades!!!

Some excellent items, such as short rib, crimini caps, salmon skewers, and aloha tips, but I would avoid the Monte Christo.  Undecided on the chicken and waffles.  The place is super casual, echoes of a diner.  But that fits with the neighborhood.  The price does not really fit with the neighborhood.  Plates average $6 to $10 each, with some higher, which was more than we expected, especially with less expensive tapas restaurants in nicer parts of town.  Staff is very nice, even changing the background music when we commented on the annoying rap music playing.  Will likely go back, if out of town friends come for a visit.",WVbInLGAt-GTxPVNIEbMUA,0,0,4,JGx7kLV192_ixL051uFv3g

Ok, so this restaurant is sort of in a weird location- but I'm glad that we came.  My husband and I went for lunch and I want to go back for dinner!  And hey, you can't deny the charm of a family run business.  I hear the owners are a husband and wife team.

We had a bunch of items on their menu. The monte cristo, lotsa mozza, chicken and waffles, aloha tips, chicharron, and the state fair.  I enjoyed every dish and every bite.

You can tell by each dish you try that the chef loves what he does and the entire staff is proud of what they are offering. And I've tried many of the dishes. It is a very easy going place almost like you've walked into the owners home for lunch or dinner. Sometimes all I want to do is kick back and this is my place to do just that. 

They have figured out a way to have gourmet food at affordable pricing. They are also very good to the local music scene by having performers come in on Friday nights. We held an event there and they really went out of their way to make it perfect for us. They closed down the place, made room for our DJ and dancing. They allowed us to use their TVs at the bar. They printed personalized menus for my guests, create a special menu and helped by offering happy hour pricing at the bar. 

I don't think a lot of place you go out to is going to be perfect every time but at least I know that when I go to Nosh and Swig, they are trying to give me a nice dinning experience.",0ufTlP6EYovFuY7iPuRIZw,1,0,4,0DLczL7TkE7EsHik77R5LQ

The table favorite was by far the Sticky Bun tacos.  The slight crisp on the pork belly combined with the sauce and pickled cabbage.  It was the one dish that we all agreed on to order again.  Also had the Nachos O'Brien, which were house potato chips with tomatoes, cheese, and pork.  This was excellent as well.  Had the Pretzel Brats, and highly recommend them over the Bantam burgers, if you're looking for a sandwich type item.  The chicken apple sausage was AWESOME, combined with the delicious cheese gravy.  YUM!  Also had the Cocka-Waffle-Do, their take on chicken and waffles.  A delicious deep fried piece of chicken breast over a waffle, but the finisher for this one was a very tasty blueberry maple reduction.  Excellent!  The Fromage Fondue, as the waiter said, excellent on a date, but was delicious for the guys too.  The garlic cheese was stellar.  I'm running out of adjectives on how good all of the food was.  And then, our waiter (also the owner), suggested we try the chuyquiles.  You read it on the menu, and you're not sure to order it....well....order it.

I remember this space back when it was catfish alley.  I thought the location was a little odd  still do now but i like that it's a couple trying to live their dream.

As to the food ( since my friend was on a work lunch break, i did not look at the drink menu ) 

The space looks nice.  I like how the menu is set up.

We ordered nachos o'brien, the short rib, meatballs, monte cristo.  Total bill was $46.  Given the serving sizes, i'd say a little pricey.

The food was served quickly but the nachos and meatballs were lukewarm.

The flavor ? 

The meatball sauce was tasty - had a Little bite.  The meat was a little chewy - i think it could use a little more fat, just a little.

The nachos were unremarkable - the sauce was too lumpy/coagulated.  

The short rib was tender with nice flavor.  The polenta ""cake"" cold and firm.

pretzel brats - nice flavor but a very small portion for the $$ ( $8)

I want to like this place - i like the menu options but my sense it's an execution issue.

I will definitely try again - probably at dinner to see if the food is prepped differently.

Here's the deal. 
I had three small plates and a cocktail. 

The cocktail (Sake Long Time) was light and refreshing, and the little lychee balls that popped in my mouth were tasty and fun. It's been so long since anything has popped in my mouth... 

but I digress...

Two of the small plates (a nightly special - Blue Crab Spring Roll, and the Asian Crepes) were quite good. The dishes were well-prepared and tasty.

The third plate - the Chicken Pretzel Brat - was pretty standard. Just okay.

All together, the meal cost about $40 with tip.

And there's my issue. For $40, I felt like I was on the low end of ""enough"".
Yes, I appreciate the fresh ingredients, as well as the inventive preparation - but when I can get good All-You-Can-Eat sushi nearby for $30 total; ...well, I'm more likely to go for that. 

I'm not a quantity-over-quality guy, and I don't need to gorge to be happy - but the balance needs to be a bit more in favor of portion size before I can justify being a regular at Nosh & Swig. 

Glad I tried it. Hope they do well at this location.",8la7DygWKVkfpDatXztktg,0,0,4,GoS8I4zL_XHjLJ9Fk_1Qmw

We ordered items to share for the table and everything was delicious.  More specifically:

-  Caesar Salad:  It is served in a cannister with a dressing on the side.  You mix the salad with the appropriate amount of dressing you prefer.  The salad was delicious.  The lettuce was crisp, dressing was creamy, and the croutons were the best I've ever had.

-  Bantam Burgers (Sliders):  The portion comes with two normal sized sliders (with white cheese and chopped tomato).  They were incredible flavorful and delicious.  I only wished that they were cooked medium rare instead of medium.

-  Salmon Skewers:  My most favorite dish of the evening.  It was cooked perfectly and crumbled softly with every bite.

-  Pork Belly Buns:  A beautifully presented dish with three individual buns.  The pork had great flavor and the buns were very soft.  A great balanced dish.

-  Short Ribs:   The ribs were very tended; however, a little too sweet for my liking.  Nonetheless a great dish for the table to share if you are all carnivores.

-  Cookiemon (Dessert):  The dish comprised of a baked cookie topped with ice cream.  It's baked fresh and as the waitress indicated, takes 10 - 12 minutes to prepare.  It wasn't my favorite dish of the evening.  Nonetheless, it was still very good.

The food here is very good, but the service is even better.  The owners are very engaging and are vested in ensuring that you have a positive experience.  I highly recommend you visit.  It could quickly become your new favorite tapas joint.",qrOXWSK-bpf24dLWnTx29Q,0,0,5,HDfEks35_l43v1KFva9LRw

Food was delicious, especially the sticky bun tacos. I tried to bring my family from out of town to try this place a couple weeks later and we were informed that they ""ran out of food"" so they were closing an hour early. That seemed weird to me...how would you know you were out of what we were going to order. Since this was such a huge inconvenience (went 25 minutes out of the way to drive there) I emailed the owner. The response I got was....they were having some issue in the kitchen and had to close. So how is it that I was given two different reasons? And the response was not apologetic. 

I decided to give them one more time and it was a horrible experience! Air conditioning was off and it smelled disgusting. How can any business in Vegas not have air conditioning when we have been hitting 117 degrees.

If this place would be open normal hours and consistently....it would be a pretty good place. (as long as the A/C worked!) But since this place isn't really by anything...driving there and it randomly being closed just isn't worth it.",UL5K2rnSYIPD1LcqPgbmDQ,6,0,1,iXujxpLh_sV623VDYM3gDg

We have been going here since they opened, first enticed in by a Groupon and then brought back by Chef Steve's wonderfully inspired dishes. This is a small plates restaurant so do not order one plate and expect to be full. The menu is divided into individual proteins and veggies. Read the descriptions carefully and then order enough to share. My husband and I typically order four or five plates and then hesitate over dessert. Chef Steve did a menu change recently so now we will be enjoying some new items and hope that you also try them out. Go with a group of people, its more fun

The Poke is one of my favorites, but make sure you mix it to get the seasoning all through it. One the new new additions is the Beef Carpaccio, Very flavorful. Also the shrimp dish, I believe its called Mini Mi's but its on a bun with slaw. The slaw is so good I would eat just that. They are so many dishes that it is truly had to remember. Checkout their ode to the Monte Cristo, it will make you weep. The owners work hard to provide good service and are always looking to improve. So.....if you want to eat and not be bothered go for lunch during the day. If you want busy with some music and noise check them out on a Friday night. They have a Facebook page that will tell you if there is something going on before you head out. Since I am all about the food, we go during the daytime. They also apparently have a happy hour but I don't know what that is about, I have just read the sign.

The decor is very basic, as is the plating and utensils. Because we have been coming here since the beginning, we have been able to see the changes they have made to the place over time. I can see where they have spent their money and am able to understand their choices. I would much rather have great food than great decor.",rE4q3lTnVoyR95_Ikgs9Hg,0,0,5,LRDV0_51vYuOwyzf9rsRQQ

Not sure it's worth the drive for the $10 Groupon I have. Food was average. Calamari was soggy. Paella wasn't good - I've made better at home myself. Rice was hard & it wasn't hot or even luke warm. We tried a 3rd dish but at this point I can't even remember what it was so it obviously wasn't a show stopper.

1728896,2013-03-20,3,C-u6Ywuq192icOblKm6oKg,"Took advantage of the Groupon offer to try out this fairly new place located a few miles from LVBLVD in the Jacinta strip mall. It's a tapas style restaurant where they have an eclectic representation of international as well as American comfort style dishes served up in small plates. 

The menu is in a little flip type book organized by pages with header pictures of: Pork, Beef, Chicken, Seafood, Greens, Cheese, Desert and Drinks.  Also Vegetarian friendly dishes were indicated with V and color coded green on the menu.   It made it easier figure out and zero in what we wanted to try out. Thing is we wanted to try alot of dishes and it took a few minutes for Bonnie P. and I to decide what we wanted to have for lunch.  We  on settled on four of them which our server said was plenty enough to start out for both of us. 

What we NOSHed on:

Monte Cristo
Teri Chicken
Cock-A-Waffle-Doo
Baked & Blazed 

Fun presentation and not so small plates after all. The portion was enough for two people to share. (Well especially if you plan on ordering 2+ more small plates) 

My favorites: the Monte Cristo, loved the combo of the fried egg, ham with mild flavor of the Gruyere cheese oozing and the touch of sweetness of the berry compote. Also the Cock-A-Waffle Doo! The cornflake crusted fried chicken, meat was moist, had flavor and was juicy. Crust was crunchy and again a touch of sweetness with a berry maple syrup reduction.  I love the fusion of savory and sweet in these dishes! Both ""small"" plates I  I definitely would order again!

The Baked & Glazed and Teri Chicken also pretty good.  The fussili pasta was cheesy and made the perfect comfort food dish and also vegetarian friendly! The Teri Chicken was grilled and I like the garnish of crunchy won ton strips.

We made room for dessert and chose the ""cookimon'"" which was a cookie baked right into a mini cast iron pan. So that little sucker was warm and the chocolate chips slightly melted and topped with vanilla ice cream and whip cream.  Kinda reminded me of BJ's Pizookie! The Cream Cheese Lote, which is the version of Thai flatbread was more like a crepe but rolled up. It was spread with cream cheese, rolled up and drizzled with a simple vanilla sugar glaze (Creme Anglaise)

Service was great! Our server was really sweet and friendly. She truly liked and believed in the dishes she serves up and shared with us what she had tried out as well. Just a minor issue of check when presented, Groupon discount was indicated on check but not deducted..brought it to attention of our server who corrected it right away. 

We were there during the dead zone hour between lunch and dinner so it wasn't busy much.  Two other parties were just finishing up and a large party was setting up towards the end of our meal.  Our dishes came out paced at the right time, there was no awkward long waits between the dishes . 

The atmos was casual with tunes of the likes of Bob Marley playing in the background. Our lunch ended up being an enjoyable two hours. Stars for creative dishes, fair value and portions, good service, and fun place!  I shall return to NOSH again!",2EuPAGalYnP7eSxPgFCNDg,6,6,4,hmZfLdpIM65-hQsfCawa4A

Service - when you decide to eat early as we did, guess who ends up being your server? The owner! She was very attentive and informative, helping us decide what to order. We even had a discussion about Yelp, and she mentioned appreciative she was of Yelp, yet how it was very much a love/hate relationship between them. My boyfriend probably could've done with less talk and chitchat with our dinner, but I didn't mind. He perked up when the owner mentioned that he get a free refill on his Thai tea. Yes, please!

Atmosphere - Decor is very simple and casual. Music was playing pretty loudly as we walked in. As we were eating, the owner informed us she went and turned it down.  My bf and I like background music, but just that, in the background. We were there late afternoon, so it was pretty empty. I'm guessing it could get loud when it's busier, but we weren't sure what the ambiance normally is. 

Food - what did we order?

Sticky Bun Tacos
Smokey Poke
Frito Calamari
Tempura Veg
Elote
Lotsa Mozza

Every dish had great flavor. I've had a lot of poke in my days, I thought their version was okay. The Elote is grilled corn brushed with garlic butter, cayenne, and drizzled with cilantro pesto. Phenomenal! Yes, corn was that exciting! The Lotsa Mozza was recommended to us and it was delicious, herb cheese, tomato stacked on top of eggplant and polenta cake. 

Their menu definitely has me intrigued to visit again. We wanted to have room for dessert to try the Warm PB&J, but our tummies definitely said no. Next time :)",q9jCDNZDRUYl2Pwlgxocig,10,6,4,oNUVmxXArwkwXc8KMMU6YQ

Alright a little about me: My mom always told me that when ever we go to a buffet or a restaurant, look at the price of the item or the cost of the buffet and try to eat that much worth of food. 

With this programmed into me at a young age it's often hard to steer away from this mentality. Anthony M can vouch for this as he seems to believe i am capable of devouring everything in front of me at an alarming pace. So yeah with all this said, I do admit that i generally do not like tapas places because the portion sizes are way smaller then they need to be at entree prices. 

I do fully agree with Anthony M that Nosh & Swig deserves some extra kudos points for not being the cookie cutter run of the mill 'oh look bacon wrapped dates...oh joy bacon wrapped shrimp...' tapas places. Not that there's anything wrong with bacon wrapped dates and bacon wrapped anything. Just saying that after watching nothing but action movies where everything EVERYTHING has to in some way shape or form explode it's nice to break it up with a romantic comedy or two. Just sayin. That and before i get anymore complements it's Anthony M that pointed this out to me so the idea is not original i'm just agreeing with what he told me in person seeing as he hasn't written his review yet.

So i ordered the chicken and waffles because the Urban in me likes chicken and waffles. The price was decent (10 bucks). What came out was a standard sized waffle that wasnt too crispy but had a decent texture. The chicken was a de-boned thigh that was butterflied and stretched out to cover the waffle. Sauce provided was a blueberry reduction syrup like thing. A nice gourmet spin on an otherwise dangerously unhealthy comfort food. 

Overall my favorite were the dr pepper braised short ribs, nice flavor that wasnt too overpowering and very VERY tender. 

Seeing as i dont live on the east side, nor the north side, safe to say no where near the north east side; i just dont see myself going outta my way to go back to Nosh & Swing unless it's another UYE hosted by someone i know.

Would i recommend this place to people that do live in the area. Yes, yes i would as they're doing something new in the tapas scene. Hopefully next time i go back they'll have their liquor license and we can have some cocktails along with our finger food.

1983967,2014-07-21,5,C-u6Ywuq192icOblKm6oKg,"I was SOOOOOO disappointed. 

We had high hopes based on other reviews and friend's accounts of their experiences. 

Seriously, what are you people thinking?!?

First, the hostess/waitress was NOT happy to be at work that day. She wasn't necessarily overly rude or anything, but you could tell she definitely didn't want to be there. (Find a new job if you hate yours so much!)

The popcorn was decent. 

I ordered the Dr. Pepper ribs, or some such thing. $12. There were two tiny pieces or meat, which were very tender but VERY DRY. It was hard to (literally) choke them down. The order came with the 2 pieces of meat, 2 bite sized pieces of broccoli, 2 small pieces of their corn bread and some carrot shavings. No other sides, no rice or potatoes or anything like that. I ordered extra rice. It was $1, so not that horrible in terms of price. So, my ""meal"" was $13. The rice tasted off, the meat was so dry I was literally choking it down. The broccoli was fine, the carrots were not so fine and the corn bread was bland. My rice came with my husband's order, in a plastic sandwhich bag shoved in their serving dish. 

If I recall correctly, the boy ordered their version of chicken satay? He was not impressed. 

We spent over $25 for mediocre (at best), overpriced food and then had to go SOMEWHERE ELSE for an actual meal. 

Also, what is up with the decor?? You have the Nosh & Swig part on two opposite walls, very british-esque feel, then you have a hindu-esque wall with some astro-turf wrapped partitions? Very modge-podged together and took away from the atmosphere. 

We will not be back, or be recommending this place to anyone we know - unless of course we hate them and actually want them to have a horrible dining experience.",sDlRFzGHzfpFHaxvJ1JtTg,5,0,1,RFBl2Y_fX1gpomVH8mA4tg
2008630,2013-01-07,0,C-u6Ywuq192icOblKm6oKg,"[This is a preliminary review for Nosh & Swig because the place has only been open a week and does not have a liquor license yet (though they are BYOB)]

Nosh & Swig is a fusion tapas restaurant with some tasty dishes and fun food combinations.  The food is creative and the kitchen sends out dishes plated in imaginative designs on the plate.  Between the plating of the food and the inventive flavor combinations, Nosh & Swig is a place where you're encouraged to play with your food.

We ordered a few meat plates and each was expertly-prepared, creatively plated, and fun.  The Nachos O'Brien consists of peppered pork on potato chips with stewed tomatoes in a creamy bechamel cheese sauce.  The flavors of the meat and cheese sauce were surprisingly well-balanced.  The potato chips were prepared by the kitchen and the fried flavor might have been too strong, but the peppered pork stands strong and the cheese sauce blends the whole dish.  The kitchen also did a great job with the short ribs plate--the ribs were glazed with Dr. Pepper.  The glaze was sweet and thick on the expertly-prepared, tender beef, which is served on amazingly sweet, crisp polenta cornbread and candied carrots.  The candied carrots were a bit much, but everything else was brilliant.

The non-meat dishes were similarly imaginative.  The salmon skewers came cleverly prepared in a miso sweet glaze, making the fish taste almost honeyed.  The kitchen added a fresh seaweed salad that was an excellent compliment to the dish.  

Our favorite dish on the menu was the Elote plate--corn covered in a sauce of garlic butter, cayenne and cilantro.  Wonderful combination--creamy and tart.  The dish is messy, but who cares.  The sauce mixes exceptionally well with the fresh corn underneath. 

Measuring the plates on their own, I think I'd only re-order the Elote, but that doesn't mean I didn't love Nosh & Swig.  The other three dishes we had were clever and fun to experience.  So much that I want to head back and try several more dishes.

Note on the newer-status of the restaurant: Right now, the restaurant seems a little awkward.  The space is designed to be sleek and cosmopolitan--metal tables and comfy booths with small bookcases on the wall including books and busts.  They're not filling up the restaurant yet, so the space feels a little empty, but its more than compensated for by a staff that's working hard to make sure the customers are satisfied.",wOSHvuJEJflUEesNLno51A,6,5,4,TFEzVZMRzv2WLGR0Qvx-NA
2017727,2013-08-02,10,C-u6Ywuq192icOblKm6oKg,"I, for the life of me, cannot understand how anyone could give this place any less than five stars. I mean, what restaurant were you eating at? Because this is most definitely the most innovative, forward thinking, evolved restaurant I believe I've been to in this town in a LONG time.

I mean, you walk in and you really don't understand what you're in store for. The concept is on the windows, but you don't really get the gist until you sit down and open up this fabulous menu.

I was only slightly, slightly disappointed that some of the things on the menu were discontinued as they are going through a seasonal menu change (for sure a sign of a great restaurant) and were knocking things off at them moment. Trust me when I say that lasted all of about 10 seconds. 

The concept is this: whatever you eat, be it vegetarian, pork, chicken, etc. You have a set menu for each type of food. It's all covered, each one, on one small page, but the tastes are SO big. Also, there are rumors that this is a tapas bar, but that isn't quite true. Yes, the plates are all sold separately, there are no sides, but the plates are a nice sized portion, not that tiny things you get at a regular tapas bar. That's misleading as heck. I was stuffed after I had just three plates!

I personally (as a pescatarian) had the smokey poke. Let me tell you, that was some deliciousness on a plate. The poke sits atop several sauces (of which I've forgotten at the moment) and I was encouraged to dip some in each. Whatever. I totally mixed that all together and then inhaled it. I got a little of the smokey, a nice bite of spicy and some mellow flavors that balanced it all out. It was fresh and delicious.

My second plate was the elote. Listen, I would love to sit here and wax eloquent about how delicious this was, but I'm just going to go ahead and say it: if I could mainline this into my veins I would have OD'd, oh, several MILLION times. There are no words for how great this dish is. I can't even go on, I'm getting emotional about not being able to go get some more right now. And then an hour later, and an hour after that. Hi, I'm Nickolle and I'm an elote addict. CRACK on a cob. That's what they should call it. Try it and come to meetings with me. We'll get through this together. (this is corn on the cob that you grab and eat with your hands - lick your fingers afterward, no one cares)

Next up for me was the lotsa-mozza. This is essentially cheese, polenta, eggplant and tomatoes. But yet so much more. Anyone who has ever taken cheese and melted it in a hot pan knows the delicious taste. That's sort of this, but with sliced mozza and other things in between, specifically, sweet polenta (mmmmm...). The thing that brings this all together is the taste of that melted, crunchy cheese. So, so good. So good.

For dessert (like, someone stop me, okay?) I had the cream cheese lote. I obviously have a cheese addiction as well. I was going to go for the chocolate chip cookie and ice cream, but I wasn't ready to be jolted out of my mellow taste experience with something that sweet. I was super pleased that I didn't. This is a flat bread that is the consistency of a crepe, but with a little more crunch. The cheese actually is very subtle as is the cream anglaise. It sits atop some little bubbles, I can't remember the name name now (arghhh!), but they were sweet when I popped them in my mouth. There were different flavors and they really added some zing to the sort of savory taste of the crepe/cheese combo. Really pleasing to my mouth!

This restaurant is a brand new fave and I can't wait to go back. The owners are so friendly and awesome that I want to be their new best friend. As much as I'm about to start going I'm pretty sure we'll be on a first name basis soon! Get here. FAST.",jjogE_kPPMjxKvDEFlct6w,8,11,5,q3nZ_iJ4-WN_3ZGNb7OWww

hodge podge - fries, sweet potato fries, truffle tots, onion rings
average at best.  i didn't think you could screw up fried stuff but apparently you can by over frying some items and under frying others.

daily special - tofu spicy noodle soup - waaaay salty, soggy noodles, hard tofu

veggie tempura - soggy and some of the veggies were bitter.  disgusting.  i actually had to spit out something i ate because it was that bad.

corn - overcooked but the sauce was ok.

service was mediocre.  one of our friends didn't receive his meal as the server forgot to put the order in but when he received it 30 minutes later, they didn't charge him for it so that was a plus.

basil, strawberry lemonade - the flavor was just so odd.  not prepared properly at all.  there was no balance of flavors.  too much basil, not enough strawberry or lemonade.

severely overpriced.  we spent over $50 to be ridiculously disappointed.

i won't return.",pN6pzJR6mK7549M0azoaxg,5,1,2,xpst0l8xO_zcylvCsfhdvw

We ordered the Elote, Brûlée Salmon Skewers, Cock-A-Waffle-Doo and the Bacon-Wrapped Hot Dog Special. All of the dishes were presented beautifully and were very well-prepared. Everything tasted great, but the Cock-A-Waffle-Doo was a special treat. The cornflake crusted chicken, belgian waffle and blueberry maple reduction was pretty fantastic. 

The restaurant itself is a nicely decorated fun place to have a meal. Although, at the moment, it is a little difficult to locate. Hopefully they will acquire a well-lit sign in the near future so that they can be easily seen from the street.

My cousin and I had this spot bookmarked and decided to have dinner here. When we arrived, it looked like the restaurant was closed. All darken and dimmed is what we saw from the emptied parking lot. It was around 7pm on a Saturday. We did make our way to the entrance and saw they were opened. We were the only ones in the restaurant, except for a few employees of the restaurant. Our host/waitress was very friendly and speculated the emptiness of the restaurant was due to a UFC event happening this time of day. We were seated at a nearby booth and browsed the menu.

The menu was full of delicious fusion tapas dishes. Gloutney was on my mind, but I had to keep in mind that we were mid point of our trip. Still more to see and do! Picking menu items was like picking lottery numbers. We won't know if we had winners or disappointments. For my beverage, I decided to get the Thai tea with boba. Below is the list of menu items we order and shared, detailed with the ingredients of the dishes: 

- Monte cristo: (black forest ham, gruy'ee cheese, fried egg, and wild berry compote)
- Chuyquiles: (sauteed tortillas, melted cheeses, fried egg, and salsa roja)
- Peas & carrots: (sweet carrot rangoon and english pea puree)
- Coq au vin adobo: (red wine braised chicken wings, garlic shoyu, and flash fry)
- Short rib sliders (dr. pepper braised, blue cheese bechamel, fresh apple, petite greens)
- Elot'e: (grilled corn, garlic butter, cayenne, and cilantro pesto)

***For dessert***
- Shaved ice (purple yam ice cream (ube), cornflakes, coconut, melon slivers, popping pearls, and condensed milk)

- Churrnut ala mode (doughnuts churro-style with ice cream of the day which was pistachio) 

All I have to say is with this line-up, we won the lottery. Nothing was over or under cooked. Everything was just right for me. Meats were tender. The chicken wings were fall off the bone good! The spices and marinades brought distinguished flavors that brought all the dishes to life. My favorites were the monte cristo and chuyquiles.

The desserts were equally as good.

My only issue is I think the pricing could be a little cheaper compared to other places that are fancier.

Ceasar salad (served in a very unique fashion)  check it out.  Those croutons!!

Sliders (called bantam burgers).  Two juicy servings, white cheddar all over, on the messy side, but well worth it.

The salmon skewers.  All I can say is so fresh, cooked to perfect moistness.  

The pork belly buns.  Three servings, the dish looks beautiful.  Extra points for not being oily.  I have seen many greasy renditions of this dish, and I like the version here.

Short ribs.  These are on the sweeter side if that is your thing.  Big portion, great price.  Tender, but still requires a knife to eat, if that paints a picture for you.

For desert, we got the cookiemon, a baked cookie topped with ice cream.  Can't really go wrong with this dish, it takes time to make, because it's cooked fresh.

This Nosh and Swig is located in a shopping mall and the sign is not to big so you may miss it!  Drive slowly and carefully so you don't miss it because you'll regret it if you don't get a chance to taste their delicious bites! Parking was easy, right in the front with plenty of other spaces in the parking lot.

It was a Sunday night so there was only one other family in the restaurant and we got to sit in the booth in front of the bar and in front of the TV. 

Byron was our waiter! 

He brought out some herb/spicy popcorn for us to munch on as we looked through the menu.  Nom nom. 

Their menu is pretty cool, spiral style and easy to navigate based on type of meat.  Drinks and dessert towards the end.  

We ordered the following dishes:

1) sticky bun tacos (fried pork belly. pickled cabbage. ginger soy) - came with three tacos so if you have four people in your party, someone has to share!  Very delicious  
2) tiger cry (Thai beef jerky. sticky rice. nam prik) - very filling and they had a lot of meat in this dish! Just enough kick!  
3) smokey poké (ahi tuna. citrus ponzu. norichips) - a bit spicy but REALLY good! 
4) cock-a-waffle-doo cornflake crusted chicken. Belgian waffle. blueberry maple reduction - can you say OMG so GOOD! I really liked this one. 
5) baked & blazed (fusilli pasta. white cheddar sauce. provencal crust).  VERY DELICIOUS.  I couldn't stop eating this one.  The cheese is amazing in this dish
6) statefair waffle sandwich (waffle. vanilla ice cream. candy confetti. chocolate glaze. fun for everyone)  - WOW what a dessert.  This plate took me back to my childhood years and I feel like there was something for everyone in this dessert! 

Cons: They were out of the short ribs and BBQ wings (sad face)

I also got the mint and basil lemonade which was different AND good!  Not too sweet and I like the mint addition to this beverage! 

Overall, the customer service here was superb.  I really enjoyed the people and staff that worked here. You can tell they take time to prepare their meals and they have quality ingredients.  Byron was a great waiter and was super attentive!",5wf-b9hqWbWWPMg_FU50QA,1,1,4,W8tl4U9pJpMKbD1TKRVmnA

I certainly was a bit harsh first time.  I dig the atmosphere.  Now.  It has a campus vibe, bleeding with local establishment character.

It's not trying to be what all the hype made it out to be.  It's just a young trendy Hawaiian type restaurant with fusion dishes.  Service was quik today.  For what it is it's a good dig.

Took my toddlers with us this time.  The complimentary salty sweet popcorn wasn't stale at all.  I gave some to our 18 month old and he was stoked.  Matisyahu was playing and he was actually grooving to the reggae playing the whole time.  Our 3 year old was running amok in the place without bothering other diners and I like that it's laid back enough to allow my boys spirit to be free.  Islander parenting okay!  How many serial killers are islander, huh?

Anyway we stuck to the HH menu today and got the cheesy tots which had some diced tomatoes onions and peppers with white cheese in a mini skillet.  3$ @HH and was really tasty. 3/5

Then we had the Baked & Blazed mac & cheese.  It was about as baked as most of the clientele (maybe workers too, lol)  I don't mind it at all.  We all remember the college years..  It had small shell pasta and a creamy white cheese.  Decent for 4$ HH. 2.5/5

Next was the Manila clams and bacon appetizer.  Served in a shallow bowl with 6 clams and chuncks of bacon in a red sauce.  Like a mini clam bake.  It came with 2 olive oiled french toast slices.  A nice different dish. 3.5/5

Ended with a beloved drunken slider.  We love these.  Its a kimchi garnished sweet beer sauced slider with an over easy egg.  First bite breaks the yolk then that sweet pow.  Still love these. 5/5

Had the specialty drinks.  My lemonade cream and she had the cucumber tea, er something er other.  Both were refreshing and large as last time.  The cream lemonade had those tasty juice boba balls.  So sweet and poppy.  I really need to buy those for the house!  

Overall I gave Nosh a bad rap last time and I really do like to treat local a little better than that so.  I'll add 2 more stars on this rating.  Yeah I might be getting soft, yelpers.",ZngF2uBYrqyFjXd6LvuluQ,3,2,4,hfV1bT0Gb5j_0IesWkNuZQ

Everything sounds and looks sooo much more amazing than it actually tastes. Nothing tastes bad but nothing really pops. Some of their food tastes fresh and some tastes frozen.

Popcorn: super salty and kind of stale 

Cheesey tots - tasted frozen, some tots super soggy, some crunchy, flavor tasted eh 

Chicken and waffles-dark meat and overcooked chicken, sauce was good though

Baked and Blazed- like Mac & cheese from a box, underseasoned 

Monte Cristo- the only item I really liked, good flavor and tasted fresh 

Pretzel bratz- didn't like the sausage they used, and pretzel buns were a little hard 

Cookiemon- hard cookie, overbaked 

I feel that if they spruced up the atmosphere it would be more enjoyable. I was somewhat sweating while eating lol. There's no ac (or atleast it feels like there's none) and they have several floor fans. It feels musty and humid. Also they keep half of their lights off. It feels way too dark for the type of food they're serving and looks like they're closed. It just doesnt feel fresh and they can't blame it on the older building because i've taken several classes at the real estate school in the same building and it's bright and fresher feeling in there. I like their island music though. 

They have a great concept and great food ideas but sadly not executed that great especially for the price. I'd much rather go to firefly even though they've had their health code issues lol.

The beef jerky and edamame are the first things I order the moment I sit down and while enjoying my crunchberries and the free popcorn I decide what other favorites I'm going to chose from... The poke is amazing along with the Steve-o grilled cheese... I always save room for dessert so make sure you do also!

NOSH- You all I know I can nosh. 
Beef Lumpia-Wonton thing. Delish. Served with a sweet and spicy chili sauce and garnished with green onions. Not on the menu, but if you are lucky it just might be a Chef Special that day. 

Pretzel Brat $8- You REALLY need to order these. Chicken sausage, sauerkraut, cheese gravy on pretzel roll. I cannot begin to tell you how much I enjoyed this and I don't usually get down on kraut. Everything works with this and it came on two separate rolls which was perfect for sharing.

Monte Cristo $7- ORDER THIS. My favorite dish here. The mellow melted goodness of the Gruyere complimented the smokiness of the Black Forest ham. But it doesn't end there. It's then topped with a perfectly fried egg and warm berry compote. Hot damn I loved this. 

Truffled Tots- ORDER THESE The best tater tots I have ever tasted. They were creamy, yet crisp on the outside and topped with shredded cheese. Every bite tasted of truffle and made me wish my friend I was dining with was allergic to potato so I could eat every single one of them. No such luck. We both battled it out for the last tater. You won't be disappointed with these and if you are well we probably wouldn't be friends anyways and your mutha's a whore.

Cock-A-Waffle-Doo $10- This was good, real good in fact. My only problem and it's a total personal one because I'm not perfect is it was dark meat. I don't enjoy dark meat chicken, yet it was crispy, flavorful and worked well with the sweet Belgium waffle and Berry Maple reduction. P.S. I could drink the reduction all by itself. 

Spicy Edamame $2- Small portion, but not short in flavor. GET THIS, TOO. We destroyed this and loved the sauce so much we were dipping the tots in it. 

SWIG- I slurped up the Chata-Effup which was a-okay. I am still excited for them to get their liquor license because I know they will have some crazy good cocktails.

Prices are cheap for the creative delicious dishes this place is bangin' out. Great place for sharing plates in a casual environment. The service was on point and friendly.

3226009,2013-03-05,1,C-u6Ywuq192icOblKm6oKg,"I would like to say that everything here is NOSHtastic and SWIGalicious. 

This gem has been open for about a month. It's hard to find (especially at night) because they don't have an illuminated store front sign just yet. So keep your eyes open! 

The decor is modern. Clean and simple. There are smaller booths around the restaurant that seat 2-4. Large tables are available for bigger parties. There are an ample amount of high top bar tables that seat about 3 per table. Where the high top tables and booths are, you can see the open kitchen. It's a lot of fun to watch especially when they start pumping out their food. 

Their food is tapas style, so don't expect large dishes that fill you up with leftovers to doggy bag. Everything on their menu screams fusion. Can't really put a finger on what they're a fusion of so I'll say that they fuse flavors from all around the world! The menu itself is super adorable. They separate their items by categories: pork, beef, chicken, seafood, veggies, cheese and dessert. Within each category, they have around 7 or 8 dishes to choose from. 

Each plate is priced anywhere from $5 to about $12. I took my cousin and we were content after 4 dishes. And then we saw servers carrying plates of food to other tables and decided to order 2 more dishes. In part, this was a big mistake. We had no room for dessert and became overly stuffed. 

- Complimentary popcorn: What a cool way to substitute your average bread and butter basket! Perfect amount of butter. 
- Sticky Bun Tacos: Fried pork belly, pickled cabbage and ginger soy. The pork belly wasn't greasy. I personally think this dish would be better if the pork was shredded. Total of 3 small tacos. 
- Albondigas: Meatballs with salsa roja with sliced jalapenos. Even without the jalapenos, there's a kick of heat in the sauce.
- Brulee Salmon Skewers. Three pieces of salmon on a stick with a honey miso glaze and a side of warm Japanese cabbage salad. I thought the honey miso glaze tasted a lot like regular teriyaki sauce.
-Pretzel Brats: 2 mini sandwiches - chicken sausage with cheese gravy and sauerkraut on pretzel bread. This was my fave, hands down. 
- Cremini caps: Mushroom caps filled with asiago cream and caramelized onions. For all you mushroom lovers, this is a very yummy appetizer. I can sit and muNch on these babies all day.
 - Tater Tots with truffle oil and parmesan cheese: the tots are super crispy on the outside with a soft and tender potatoey goodness on the inside. Truffle oil taste on every bite. I can munch on these all day, too.

The pork offerings seem to be their wheelhouse (seriously great) while the chicken and beef are good options as well.

We sat down and looked at the menus which had a very good selection of tapas,  the menu's were sticky though. Although we were both starving we could not ignore the smell and decided to go elsewhere to eat. We never ordered anything but a water. I spoke to the staff and mentioned the smell, they said they were aware of it and stated that it was coming from the street but it smelled fine outdoors,  then I mentioned it smells like an old dingy building and another employee behind the line stated that it was the building because it was 30 years old. Not sure what the cause truly is but although the concept and decor was nice I didn't want to risk earing there yesterday.

For the hour we were there, there were only two other customers-- a woman in her 60's (who liked walking over and asking about what we ordered) and an older man who came in to watch a game. Is anything wrong with older people? Of course not, but it felt like it wasn't the demographic they were shooting for. 

THE GOOD: The popcorn at each table is cute and fairly tasty. The cheesy tots were good, but it's really hard to mess up tots (I mean, the school cafeteria pulled it off) but they weren't anything special. The ribstack was delicious, and the meat wasn't remotely dry. Very decent iced tea.

THE BLAND AND THE BAD: Sticky bun tacos were a small amount of meat and a TON of soft taco, kind of burying everything inside. The diablo eggs were an afterthought-- if you're ""meh"" on deviled eggs, these will not change your mind. The brulee salmon was almost tasteless... I LOVE salmon (raw is best, but anything well prepared is aces with me) but this was just so bland. So very, very bland.


Service was slow, and as noted-- the place was a ghost town. The young waiter seemed kind of annoyed that we were there (two quiet, friendly people; truly a nightmare!) and seemed uncomfortable in general. They were trying for that ""expanded food truck"" stainless steel decor inside, but when the place is empty and kinda messy and the service isn't particularly friendly... it felt a bit like eating in a room temperature meat locker. 2 1/2, a lot of wasted potential.",X8eIeiiCtUJ8z3cKYf9dkg,2,0,2,XyeiEChZBd1llUc43vF1hQ

I started with a horchata drink. I usually love horchata. Theirs was lacking. It wasn't terrible but it wasn't great. *sigh*
I ordered the holdgepodge, which consists of truffle tater tots, sweet potato fries, regular fries and onion rings. I LOVE onion rings. They are my favorite fried dish. These were not good. Soggy and no flavor. *another sigh*. The truffle tater tots were outstanding. I really liked those. The sweet potato fries were delicious as well. Regular fries were lacking. 
The calamari was not good at all. *sigh #3* The waiter said they were out of it and then asked the chef and he said they had one left. SCORE!!!! (or so I thought) They were tasteless and extremely greasy. The ""cocktail"" sauce didnt add any punch whatsoever. That was a HUGE disappointment. The waiter noticed I didn't eat any of it, and gave apologies. 
The standout was the signapore salad. Cute setup. They serve it in a mason jar, which is put on top of a bowl with tamarind dressing in a plastic container on top of that. Way cute! (see pic). The salad was cold and delicious, the dressing fantastic. The description said stir fried veggies but mine had none. I was gonna ask waiter but he seemed overwhelmed by our party of 20.
I had a great time but really wished the food was better. Unless someone has another UYE here, I wont go back. It's way to far from my house for food that is just not good.

A Groupon was released for it a few months after opening, so I bought it and ate there a couple months later. In short, it seems a place that doesn't know what it is while trying to be everything at once. It's a place where they try their best to be bold and playful and modern all at the same time and it all clashes in a way that is confusing to the palate. Think of all the recent culinary trends...small-plates for sharing, pork belly bao, bold cooking with bacon, clever names, etc...this place tried to do all of it.

First, the environment. It's in a pretty run-down strip mall. Once you go in, the space feels cold and uninviting due to the metal on the walls and the metal tables. The items on the menu made no sense being together. They had pork baos (on the menu as pork bun tacos), some asian-inspired chicken wings, ceviche, albondigas (meatballs), fried elote, monte cristo, carne asada sandwich, etc. I had the waitress just bring us her favorites because I had a really difficult time trying to figure out what I wanted.

We tried two drinks. The ""chata-effup"" (a spiced cinnamon rice drink which is essentially horchata) and the Mint & Basil Lemonade. The lemonade was decent, but the chata-effup was pretty watered down, making it very unsatisfying (imagine a half-milk-half-water blend). The drinks were served in large mason jars. Again, completely unnecessary. Why am I being served my drink in a mason jar? Nothing about Nosh and Swig indicates a reason for mason jars. It's just being done because it's ""cool"".

The food was okay, but not great. The best thing we had that day was the Cornflake-breaded fried chicken and waffles. The chicken was well-fried and the waffles were decent. The only flaw was that it came with a blueberry sauce which was a lot more watery than I'd like (it just soaks into the waffle and makes it soggy). The other dishes all missed the mark in some form. The pork bao tacos really needed something to brighten up the taste a bit. It was a very flat and muddled in flavor. Same for the ceviche. The ceviche had soy sauce and a few other sauces that made it a very salty dish, yet it was in desperate need for some acid. The monte cristo was completely lacking in any flavor and had way too much bread for what little was inside.  For the poor quality and the small portion sizes, Nosh and Swig is vastly overpriced.

We skipped dessert because we were pretty disappointed in our meal. In the end, we paid just over $50 for two people (2 drinks, four dishes) and left trying to think up a place to go to dessert to lift our spirits. I was very annoyed at the whole concept of the place and the food did not make up for it at all.",M9hpSOJG67mGXuwlansGjg,2,1,1,uTWeENOoh-VXvQI406yEPA

Tapas is my new favorite thing since moving to Vegas. What do you know, small plates aren't a hot commodity in South Dakota. Anyhow, I loved my meal with the beautiful Jaime W. and we noshed to our hearts' content. 

Chicken sausage sliders, yum. Monte Cristo with an egg on top, yum. Truffle tater tots? Among the best things I have ever eaten. Make the familiar strange by elevating low class food, and we will be forever friends. 

I don't have the biggest affection for the lemonade. I was expecting muddled herbs, and I could definitely taste them, but I wanted the crushed basil and mint leaves in my drink, you know? However, put a lil rum in there and all is forgiven. 

Can't wait to see how this place evolves. It's kind of hard to find. I drive by it every day to work and didn't even know it existed until Jaime brought it to my attention. It's in a strip mall with a Subway. If you reach Lee's Discount Liquors you have gone too far (well maybe not right now because of them not having their liquor license yet!).

We started with an order of Tiger Cry and Nachos O'Brien.  I wanted to order the Hodgepodge but they don't serve that anymore.  Instead, the server suggested I get two of the dishes that made up the tower thing so I got pommes frites and Truffle tots.

The Tiger Cry and the Nachos O'Brien were both very good.  We shared the dishes and we both liked the nachos and the Tiger Cry.  The hit of the two was the TIger Cry which is Thai beef jerky with nam prik and some sesame.  There was also a container of sticky rice in a ball in a plastic bag.  I'm sot sure it was sticky rice or rice just twisted together in the plastic to make it stick together.  I expected it might be a bit spicy from the nam prik, but it was not.  However, the nam prik they did use along with the jerky glaze made this a great dish.  The nachos were good, but nothing exceptional.  

My error was in ordering both pommes frites and truffle tots.  That's a large portion of both in their small pails.  They were both very good, but I ended up eating most of the frites and finishing off the truffle tots.  I didn't taste any truffle but the cheese, parsley, and salt  made the tots very good and I loved the pommes frites.

We still had some room and I ordered the Baked and Blazed--their take on a mac and cheese dish but made with fusilli and cheddar cheese and having a nice crusty top.  This was an excellent dish, too.  When we ordered this we mentioned the Cookiemon and he said it takes 15 minutes so we had him put the order in then also.  It came out a little early because we hadn't finished the baked and blazed yet but it was OK.  Only a little ice cream melted and the very hot cookie had time to cool a bit before digging in.

Service was great.  Considering we were the only customers in the place, it should have been great.  But, it was above and beyond that.  Our server answered our questions and suggested things.  He was prompt with iced tea refills and a pleasant fellow.

I noticed as Tony T. did that the music was pleasant and wasn't blaring.  Conversation was easy and the music didn't interfere.

I wish this wasn't on the other side of town.  I'd stop in more often.  I do have to make a stop here when I get my car serviced the next time.  I have to try the State Fair or the Uni-cones, or the Warm PB & J.  Well you get where my head's at!",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,6,5,4,YXrqFSDDgIDHCctG-I4q3g

First impressions are important, and the first impression I had of Nosh & Swig was the distinct smell of sewage in the air upon walking in. I don't know if a pipe burst in the back or what, but their feeble attempts to cover it up by burning incense did not work.

We eventually got used to the stink cloud and were seated in the nearly empty restaurant. To be fair, it was 9 p.m. on a Tuesday. Considering that there were almost no other tables to take care of, the service was acceptable, but not great. I would describe the food similarly.

Everything was served lukewarm. The waffle in our Cock-a-Waffle-Doo (try and order it without sounding ridiculous) was completely unheated - and no where was it mentioned that the chicken is entirely dark meat. The Nachos O'Brien were VERY tiny, even by tapas standards, and bland, bland bland. I couldn't pick up on the ""coffee dusting"" that  supposedly coated the beef in the crostini, and the ""artisinal breads"" in the fromage fondue were more like day-old scraps.

The menu that Nosh & Swig has put together sounds so delicious when you read it online. Once you arrive in the restaurant, though, you see that the execution just isn't there.

If Firefly is at the top of the Las Vegas tapas ladder, Nosh & Swig is near the bottom. Such a shame, too, because it sounded like it had so much promise.",ITNVSsPgUIWOwgKMSqwZ2w,4,3,2,6H8L2UUXsaMLBcw0C4H5Gw
3985844,2013-03-02,0,C-u6Ywuq192icOblKm6oKg,"I wonder if I am just being negative tonight?  Oh, well, on with the review...

When we were first seated, we were served water in tall skinny glasses & seasoned popcorn in tiny buckets, very cute & unique.

We ordered 6 items and shared: Singapore Greens & Nutty Popeye (salads), Hodgepodge (a tower of fried treats), Diablo Eggs, Elote (a corn on the cob dish that I didn't try), and Smokey Poke.

Menu Link:
http://www.noshandswig.com/nosh%20and%20swig%20menu.pdf

The salads were served in mason jars with the dressing on the side.  The jars are so you can shake the salad with dressing; clever.  Both were tasty though the Singapore Greens need a protein to round out the flavor profile, IMO. 

The Hodgepodge consisted of pomme frites, tempura sweet potato,
truffle tots, & onion rings.  I liked the truffle tots, but a little overboard on the truffle oil & salt.  The presentation is a twisted & tiered tower; I posted a picture

The Diablo Egss are deviled eggs (obviously), pretty regular, a little on the salty side; there is a recurring theme, appearing here.

The elote was grilled corn in garlic butter with cayenne & topped with cilantro pesto.  I didn't try, sorry.

Finally the Smokey Poke; little ahi tuna blocks in citrus ponzu, garnished with norichips & some type of fried squash or potato slices.  Great presentation & flavor, but SALTY...

Ok, I broke down our food, now for service.  It was feast or famine: repeat visits in a short period of time or no one for many tens of minutes.  They were trying hard, I could tell, but they didn't appear to have any type of ""table visit rotation"" procedure. The waitstaff was friendly, regardless.

Finally, ambiance.  There were cute touches, like the sign for the bathrooms was a street sign called ""Flushing Avenue"", clever.  Decorations were sparse and the feel, to me, was that of a hipster automat.  I didn't mind it, but it also doesn't stand out.

I am hoping that all these issues are due to its relative age.  I will definitely try here again though it is FAR from my regular stomping grounds.  Great ideas & concepts, but spotty execution is my overall impression.  Oh, yeah, and salt.",K2-KRkqecWxmwqPHQWVZbA,0,0,3,qbsmWd9Ot-u1PDO-QlQlSA

Arriving late, as usual, I sat down next to fellow Yelper Tien N and saw his order of chicken and waffles. I immediately knew what I wanted to order first. When my order of chicken and waffles came, it looked nothing like Tien's order. Where his chicken was a nice golden-tan, mine was black and dark brown! The waffle was burnt too, something that is hard to do unless you are ignoring the waffle iron. The actual burnt area was small, so it didn't affect the taste that much, but even Anthony who was sitting two seats away said he noticed the burnt chicken and waffles. I guess they were really busy that night and hoped I wouldn't notice? After finishing my first order, I debated whether to order another dish. 

While I debated, someone set down an appetizer of fried foods on our table. The truffle fries were ok, some of the fries missed the sprinkling of truffle oil. The onion rings were really salty, otherwise they would have been good. I don't remember what the third item was on the plate.

I did end up ordering pretzel brats. This dish was good: a soft pretzel bun and juicy chicken sausage. Nothing was too salty or too burnt, it really hit the spot!

Service was the true saving grace of the evening. Even though this was a newly opened restaurant all the servers hustled and helped each other out to make sure everyone's drink glasses were full and empty plates were cleared.

Overall, the kitchen still needs a little work to improve the consistency of the food. I hope the service does not deteriorate in the meantime!",gqpnDoFx42U5NdtejYfKOg,8,4,2,n_B3ITDm0xMxyhe5tgFUNA

Not too many places in the east are bookmarked!  After stopping by the house I asked my mummy dear if she wanted to eat.  Typical non-Yelper she wanted to go to Sam's Town or some other not so secret potential hidden gem.

N&S is located in a small stripmall but keep looking on the north side on Flamingo and we arrived for lunch.  Overall we enjoyed our lunch but lunch with my mom is the best no matter what kind of food we have.  

The service we had was excellent.  There was popcorn for us on the table and we were given the drink menus.  So we split everything and almost everything we had was excellent.  My favorites are the monte cristo and short ribs.

My mom said this was one of the better monte cristo she's ever had.

The sticky bun comes in three so I had two and they were nice and soft, the sauce is on the side so you can control that portion.  

The cock a waffle doo was another good dish for me.  

Didn't care too much for the dragon claws.

I actually decided to contact Nosh & Swig management via their website before writing this update... and only decided to write this update because I never received any sort of response.

My second visit to Nosh & Swig was nothing like the first. It seems that the word is out, perhaps due to the month-long Groupon promotion, because the place was packed and it certainly seemed to impact the service we received. As I was looking around (usually to find a server to refill my drink) I noticed the vast majority of those seated near us had Groupons on their tables. 

The complimentary popcorn that others mentioned, and that we received on our first visit, was not offered this time around. Other reviewers have mentioned a drink menu... And I noticed that back in January, of of the owners of Nosh & Swig responded to a review here on Yelp stating they received their liquor license.... Now it would have been nice to see the drink menu, but again, we were not offered it this time around. Sure, I could have asked... and would have if our server had come to our table in a timely manner. Instead, we waited about 10 minutes and just ordered normal drinks and a few food items. 

Every item we had on our first visit was delicious. Sadly I can not say the same about the second time around...   Perhaps we should have just ordered more of the items we knew we liked? I had tasted the pretzel brats on my first visit and enjoyed them so I decided to get an order. The cheese gravy was overpowering, but once I scraped the majority of it off the brats were as tasty as I remembered. The carne asada sandwiches were pretty good but not outstanding... The teri-chicken tasted like it was made with low quality meat, we left over half of it untouched. The chicken littles would have been a lot better if they were less sweet and more tangy, again we left a decent amount of these untouched. 

I was prepared to order dessert but again, after waiting far too long for our server to come around I decided to skip it. Nothing we ordered was so bad that it warranted a complaint, but it was surprising that the server didn't ask how it was, considering how much of it was left untouched.

I hope to try Nosh & Swig again after the Groupon hype dies down. Hopefully the service will be better then?",Ae4uXwFHp-5fGrt6OONaXw,4,1,3,QizkF-cQSLVbyJRkZMqK2Q

There's a first for everything and had a great time sharing personal and Yelp stories with everyone.  5 Stars for the UYE, 4 Stars for the restuarant ambiance & staff, and 3 Stars for the food & prices. 

My Eats:
-Short Ribs (Beef):  This was my food highlight.  Dr. Pepper braised ribs that was so delicious.  Thanks Shawn H. for suggesting this.  You can smell and taste the Dr. Pepper with each tender bite.  The ribs are perfectly placed on top of Polenta Cornbread.  You have to eat this with fork to get the full experience. Their Short Ribs were worth the additional wait. Forgot to take a picture because I was so hungry by the time it arrived. 

-Bantam Burgers which is two beef sliders with white cheese.  I have actually had better.  Doesn't compare to 808 Tapas' sliders and messy for a slider. At least these were decently sized. 

-Fries and Tater Tots:  No my order, picked on Christina W's. Just okay, nothing special.  Better tots at Sonic's. 

Pros:
-Nice ambiance, wide open and not dark like some other tapas locations.
-TV by the kitchen bar so you're not missing the game.
-Not a busy restaurant. New and not many know about this place.  As a result, getting seated shouldn't be an issue.
-Service:  Even though there was a little snafu with one of my orders, they more than made up for it. Tons of employees for a average sized restaurant.  There's always someone available to take additional request and top your drinks off (i.e water, no booze). 
-Located on the east side of Las Vegas.  Not too many eats out here on the east side, Nosh & Swig is a change of pace

Cons:
-Parking.  Small parking lot up front with a handful only being 15 minutes.  Parking at the back is an alternative.
-Food is just okay for the price. 
-No swig at this joint.

There's still a lot more for me to try on the menu.  Still want to try their Monte Cristo, Steve-O Grilled Cheese, Smokey Poke, and Salmon Skewers. 

PS:
-Thanks Molly T. for putting this together
-Thanks Stephanie S. for pulling my leg to finally show up for my first Las Vegas UYE.",y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ,9,8,4,xF_INjIyaiw2VFshiYr5eg

The tables had cleaning rags on them, there were crumbs all of the seats and in the nooks and crannies (like it had been there for months), and there were staples coming out of the damaged seats. Aside from being just yuck, I was worried that my 4 year old would get poked by the slew of ragged loose staples hanging out of the upholstery. 

The food was just meh...nothing to write home about, but it was definitely kid friendly. Minus the seat issues. Lots of heavy, heavy food items and what we ordered didn't seem that fresh. The service was decent, if not a little slow.

It started out with flavored popcorn on the table presented in a 3 tier display. It looked really cool and something I would have never thought of for popcorn. 

They do have a diverse drink menu and I really enjoyed the Elderflower cider. It was nice a white wine spritzer. 

The first course was the spinach salad and it came out in a Mason Jar. The ingredients are all in the mason jar,  you add in the salad dressing, shake it up and pour into your bowl to eat. Definitely an interesting and fun presentation but I would have liked more salad. 

The next course was Cocka waffle doo. I liked the fried chicken with the sauce and would totally order it again. I have no comment on the waffle because I didn't eat it. 

The dessert was the cream cheese lot'e, which is like roti with cream cheese in the middle and warmed in sticky syrup. I am not a fan of cream cheese so I squuezed as much out as I could, but still did not like it because the  roti roll was way to hard to cut and eat. Like chewing beef jerky. 

In addition, I ordered the Smokey Poke. That plate was awesome because the tuna was fresh and the flavors did not overwhelm the fish. It was also a generous portion.",vxR_YV0atFxIxfOnF9uHjQ,1,0,3,0sO37DsM5JwvA0oKnP7e0g

It is a few miles off the strip but I guarantee you it is absolutely worth the trip. We got to meet the chef and you can just tell he enjoys what he does and does it to perfection.

Located in a strip mall with plenty of parking. When we got their, it was completely empty since they just got done with the lunch rush, but I urge you to not let that scare you away. You will not be disappointed.

We got 13 or 14 plates in total and split them between the four of us. We seriously wanted to keep going, but just literally couldn't breathe by that point. 

The chicharron off the happy hour menu: 4 stars. It was really refreshing with the tomatoes and cheese on top of the tater tots.
Sticky bun tacos: 5 stars
Steve-o Grilled Cheese: 5 stars according to my friend. She just kept raving about it as she was eating.
Monte Cristo: Definitely 5 stars according to our friend that just keep going on about how amazing it was.
Nachos O' Brien: 5 Stars. They weren't your typical nachos whatsoever. Literally tasted like pure heaven. I should've gotten a few orders to go.
Tiger cry: 4 stars.
(N)gai satay. 5 stars for the chicken as well as the cucumber salad. WOW!
Smokey poke: 5 stars for sure!! Pure heaven on Earth. Please please please don't ever get rid of this!

Diablo eggs: 4 stars
Elote: Absolutely 5 stars. Mama mia the mayo on the corn was AMAZINGGGGG.
Mushrooms: 4 stars
Pretzel brats: 5 stars according to my friend. Sadly he had to get the second brat to go since this was the last dish of the night and he looked like he was close to exploding.

You will absolutely not be disappointed with the food. I've never been to a restaurant where I've liked everything I ordered. I especially love that they're smaller tapas plates for a decent price that way I can try a lot of the menu at one time.

The chef/owner was talking about changing up the menu sometime soon which I love since you get to try something different everytime you come their.

Thank you to byron for the awesome service and recommendations!

Anyway, checking on n&s yelp profile I was quite intrigued especially with my fascination of chicken and waffles seeing that it had its own version dubbed ""cock-a-doodle"" sumthin rather. I knew I wanted to check the place out. 

This place is more of a 4.5 stars. Right off the bat I knew I fit in. I guess you can say it was a hodge podge of the Bay Area mixed with some PB with a heaping splash of NYC.

Getting a tini bucket of popcorn helps too! I'd rather have popcorn over garlic bread.

Although I've had this salad before at other establishments, perhaps even from a Fresh & Easy, I did enjoy my short maraca moment. 

brulee salmon skewers: You receive 3 skewers and a bit of rice and cole slaw. I really enjoyed the sauce. And I LOVED the cinammon fried bits on top of the salmon. They were quite tasty.

The layout of this place is a little weird and it was really hot inside. They appeared to have a portable AC unit but it was really far away. 

The service was a little off to me. Just came over and non-nonchalantly handed us their menu and set down our drinks. Hardly a greeting when we came in the door and no recommendations when ordering. That is why a star had to be knocked off. In this tough business, you must try and make your business stand out with some personality and customer service. 

The food was hit or miss. Loved the popcorn that came before the meal. I thought that was a really fun concept. The sticky bun tacos were a bust for us. The bun was underwhelming and the pork belly was super dry. There were not enough flavors in the toppings to add some dimension to the dish. The tuna in the poke was not as fresh as I would like, but a good flavor. The pretzel brats were pretty great. I kept sniffing them because they smelled like a doughnut to me and I was totally puzzled. When I took off the bun to slather some mustard, I noticed what appeared to be cinnamon and butter on the bun. Whatever it was, it worked. The elote was also fantastic and probably my favorite of all of the dishes.

Dr. Pepper short ribs: not a fan as they were fatty and could have used more sauce. Corn bread polenta was ok. Mentioned the fattiness of the short ribs to waiter with no remedy offered.
Elote: wish they're was a little more punch to their flavor.
Cock a waffle do: would have preferred white meat chicken and more seasoned crust. Blueberry reduction & waffle was good.
Dragon claws: good...spicy tuna inside jalapeño with a spicy aioli. 
Tiger cry: best thing on the menu. Thai beef jerky had a lot of flavor, but did not come with true Thai sticky rice or they didn't cook it the right way.
For an ""ok"" meal, bill including one drink came to $75 with tip. Made us wish we would have gone to AYCE sushi or Fireflies for better tapas.
But at least I can scratch this one off my list.",bzU8Cl6B9nqV1i5NReobvw,10,3,2,ozytY-thL0fA-OeJddr4Sw

My brother's tip $? I wasn't aware, but I think that's how he expressed his feeling of also being non-plussed. 

Curiously, I did receive a Yelp ""compliment"" from a certain male related to Nosh & Swig soon after my review. This compliment simply stated, ""You're a bitch."" So you might want to check with your cook-husband (or other partners?) to see if they felt the need to reach out to me in that particular way. [Definitely not returning, now... Who knows what would befall my food.]

Lastly, I've had no less than 10 ""thank you's"" from fellow Yelpers regarding my review. Safe to say that I'm not alone in wondering where the overly generous 5-star reviews are coming from. Good yelpers aren't so easily impressed. 5-stars are rare, and usually hard-earned; saved for the highest level of culinary (and consumer) enjoyment.

Good luck and continue with the improvements. Make sure you let the good reviews happen organically and honestly. And maybe take the Yelp keys away from whomever thinks its ok to be nasty to us patrons.",7Pxx2FehELyKthPj0OY1sg,20,6,2,BnDgEyETm-ds6RS0CFfWPA

My friend and I ventured to Nosh & Swig at about 6 PM on a Thursday night. We were starving, having fasted all day and we were ready for tapas. I was also equipped with a $20 Groupon so we were ready to do some eating. 

The place itself has a ""cool"" vibe, with metallic chairs and tables. This is complimented by large sayings on the walls and interesting art work. The space itself though I felt was a little... ""cold"". I think if there had been more people there it would have felt a bit less that way. However, only one other person arrived during the time we were there.

This is what we ordered -

Smokey Poke ($8) - I love poke and this poke was quite good with, yes, a ""smokey"" flavor and some kind of sauce with a few potato chips served on the side. 

Pretzel Brats ($8) - Chicken sausage, pretzel bread, deliciousness. I LOVED this dish. I wish I had had two. I will be ordering it again.

Hodgepodge ($11) - Just as the name implies this came with french fries (eh), sweet potato fries (eh), tater tots (pretty good!), onion rings (yummy, light exterior, very good)

Dragon Claws ($7.5) - Spicay! I had one of the three because they were a bit spicy for my palate for some reason. Usually I'm all about spice, but just not tonight. However, for those looking for a kick - get these! Jalapeno. Spicy Tuna. Yum.

Dessert! We wanted the cookiemon - they were out. Nothing else was really appealing to us, so the waitress suggested the chef just whip us up some chocolate ice cream with chocolate chips on it. It was a nice end to our meal.

Customer service was fantastic. Our food came out quickly and our drinks were refilled numerous times. My card was accidentally run for the full amount of the meal instead of the price with the Groupon, but it was quickly fixed. I get it - sometimes stuff like that happens. And they even gave me a $10 gift card!

Awesome spot. So awesome it is on the East side. I love it and I will be back!",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,5,4,5,xdLvrOPcBS_YfXSAY1sj7w

I must say my husband and I were extremely disappointed after dining here. Being a Chef myself, a new tapas restaurant is the foodie excitement I crave. 

Small portions (waaaay small), over priced, and over exaggerated descriptions of menu items.

We started (and ended) with the Smokey Poke, Short ribs, and Nachos Obrien. Smokey Poke- about 3/4 cup of a portion, Ahi was chewy and flavor lacking. 
Short Ribs -were described as ""dr.pepper braised short ribs, candied carrots, and polenta bread"". What we got was ONE short rib (fix your menu) an carrot shavings that were probably candied in the morning cause they were just dried out with no flavor, 2 small pieces of raw broccoli and the polenta bread that tasted like plain old cornbread (skimping on the polenta)
Nachos Obrien- described as "" peppered pork, house made potato chips, Dublin cheese, stewed tomatoes"". What we got was potato chips with melted cheese, BACON with pepper shaker pepper sprinkled on it and diced tomatoes. I know bacon IS pork but don't exaggerate, just say bacon. We were imagining a roasted pepper crusted pork that was shredded or something. The bacon wasn't even pepper crusted, they could have at least did that. 

Server never checked on us but we were still polite and asked for the check since we are both in the industry. That's what yelp is for. 

Conclusion- even after a salmonella outbreak, I'd rather go back to Firefly. Nice try Nosh & Swig",W1jjRdbUg8zIcUI95jTUgQ,0,2,2,fGkMTLqR0Ppwwf0pQ31Zkw

I think it is a cute concept but nothing really stood out for me except for maybe the Pallea. It had a good taste but the Calamari in the dish had tentacles. I was a good sport and ate it anyways. The chicken skewers were nothing special. The deviled eggs were really plain . I think adding Siracha to the mix would give it a little kick. The sliders were tasty. The dessert which was a trio of ice cream flavors were displayed creatively. Most of the dishes I tried just  tasted okay. The presentation of the food stood out though.

The location is a bit far for us, but we have been wanting to try this place for a long while.  We came here to entertain an out of town friend after work, it wasn't that busy, score for us to enjoy the place and the game.  They were playing some old school hip hop, big plus for us.  

We tried a lot of things on the menu but main dish we all liked was the Monte Cristo.  Its a pretty simple concept, but Delicious in flavor.  I also got myself a Lychee Sake.  The mixologist even came by himself to share how he creatively made my drink.  Jesse N.  loved this place because they had a nice selection of beers to choose from.

I love trying a variety of different foods and being able to share small plates with friends.  

Nosh and Swig fills this void in my culinary world!! The restaurant is hip and modern.  The staff (props to owners Steve and Laurie) is attentive and friendly.  Yet, most importantly, the food is amazing!  The menu is laid of by protein (or lack there-of since there is a vegetarian section) and it is filled with fusion flavors.  This could be overwhelming at a restaurant, but not here, because it is done right.  The portions are perfect for sharing and the prices are reasonable so you are able to taste a variety of foods and flavors.

From the Purple (Pork) menu, we tried the MONTE CRISTO (Black forest ham, gruyére cheese, fried egg, with wild berry compote), STEVE-O GRILLED CHEESE (Candied bacon, White American cheese, warm arugula, and tomato coulie), NACHOS O'BRIEN (Peppered pork, house potato chips, Dublin cheddar, and stewed tomatoes), and STICKY BUN TACOS (Fried pork belly, pickled cabbage, and ginger soy).

From the Red (Beef) menu, we ordered the SHORT RIBS (Dr. Pepper braised ribs with polenta cornbread and candied carrots). From the Blue (Seafood) menu: SMOKEY POKE (ahi tuna, citrus ponzu, and norichips) and PAELLA (Seafood mix, spicy court-bouillon, saffron rice). From the Yellow (Chicken) menu, we got the COCK-A-WAFFLE-DOO (Cornflake crusted chicken with Belgian waffle and blueberry maple reduction) and PRETZEL BRATS (Chicken sausage on a pretzel roll with cheese gravy and sauerkraut). Lastly, from the Green (Vegetarian) menu, we got the HODGEPODGE (Pomme frites, tempura sweet potato fries, Truffle tater tots, and onion rings).

For the birthday, my friend received a UNI-CONE with their housemade Frosted Animal Cookie Ice Cream. I was skeptical when I saw the very pink ice cream (I thought it was Cotton Candy and I hate Cotton Candy Ice Cream), but oh my, it was delicious!

All of the dishes were just okay. Nothing really stood out nor did I think anything was spectacular. I did really like the Hodgepodge. Most of the dishes I could have done without completely. All of it is really fun though - the vibe, the overall experience with friends (like a ""tapas"" place should be), and the whimsical dishes - and I still enjoyed myself.

When we got there they told us there was a 15 minute wait, since we drove there all the way from summerlin/boca park area, we thought ok whats 15 more mins no prob.  We ended up waiting 30+ mins to be seated.  Once we were seated we were brought water/popcorn, so far so good, right? No... we waited and waited to have our drink order taken and had to flag someone down to finally get our drink order.  Then we had to do the same thing for our food order, flagged someone down to take our food order too after waiting another 20 mins.  After we ordered 4 tapas plates it took another 45 mins to receive ONE of the plates and another 20 for the second plate and so on...We then flagged down a man in a suit that looked like he was a manager or owner who kept bringing out drinks and shots to two of the other tables and told him of the terrible experience we were having.  He said he will let the owner know and have her come speak with us.  Another 15 mins went by and no owner, so we flagged another waitstaff to let her know we were waiting for the owner and she also said she would get the owner.  Finally another 10 mins or so goes by and the owner finally came to hear our disappointment with the service and the chicken and waffle plate.  She basically told us it is friday night, they are busy and we should have made a reservation (this is not stated on their door or posted anywhere by the way).  Also she explained that the type of food they serve (tapas) take a while to cook and they make them in the order they are put into the computer, the delay in service and food is beyond her control and there is nothing she can do for us.  What happened to customer service, and trying to accommodate the customer if they have not been treated well?  She didn't even offer to pay for one plate on the house or offer a free drink or dessert to attempt to rectify the situation...NOTHING, just told us she couldn't help us.  So we paid our $45 for our 4 tiny plates and two drinks and left.  From start to finish we spent 2.5 hours there for 4 little tiny tapas plates that weren't anything to be excited about and wasted $45.

This has to be THE WORST experience at a restaurant we have ever had.  The only nice thing about the whole situation was the live performer and the tropical ice tea.

Not tapas though, as this is not Spanish cuisine.  There are quite a few Asian influences throughout the menu, so don't expect your typical tapas mainstays like bacon wrapped dates and such.  After dining here a couple times, I've been able to sample a good spread of their menu.  In no particular order:

Aloha Tips: (Photo: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nosh-and-swig-las-vegas?select=36qA9mbLAm4UzNJfqBz9SQ#36qA9mbLAm4UzNJfqBz9SQ)  They're kalbi short ribs, good but not the most amazing rendition of kalbi.  Comes with kimchi veggies and a spicy sauce to dip your tips.

The chicken was nicely fried and juicy, the waffle was a waffle.  But it came together good with the syrup.

Dr. Pepper Short Ribs: (Photo: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nosh-and-swig-las-vegas?select=WcIitJmcgoImCuBXCkN-yg#WcIitJmcgoImCuBXCkN-yg)  Super tender!  I wish it came with more sauce, and another piece or two of cornbread, but these ribs were a winner.  Sharing is not a problem since the meat easily comes off the bone with just a fork.

Elote: (Photo: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nosh-and-swig-las-vegas?select=7TuYpBuRIeP8Zc7al5oEIA#7TuYpBuRIeP8Zc7al5oEIA)  Wasn't a huge fan, it tasted like corn and cheese to me.

Monte Cristo: (Photo: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nosh-and-swig-las-vegas?select=24ey0doywCMI3dz09FLNNw#24ey0doywCMI3dz09FLNNw)  Another winner!  Ham + gruyere + egg + berry compote = delicious.  The compote is on the side, so you can choose how sweet you want each bite to be.

Pretzel Brats: (Photo with Hawaiian Bun: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nosh-and-swig-las-vegas?select=ivFmmcFBhvZxQ3EpAb8xsw#ivFmmcFBhvZxQ3EpAb8xsw) (Photo with Pretzel Bun: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nosh-and-swig-las-vegas?select=pWVunvvwXmNLmJ0F9MldQQ#pWVunvvwXmNLmJ0F9MldQQ)  The first time I ordered this it came on a Hawaiian bun because they were out of pretzel buns; no big, either bun works great for me.  The brats are chicken sausages, and the cheese gravy is delicious; that should be a dipping sauce.

I lied earlier.  I listed the dishes in alphabetical order, but I bet you didn't catch that.  It's okay, the pictures make for an acceptable distraction.

Overall Nosh & Swig has a lot of decent dishes, and a few really good ones.  As of mid-January they really should have just been called Nosh since they didn't have their liquor license yet.  I'm really interested in what their drink menu will consist of and how it will pair with their food.

First of all they start you off with water and a little tin bowl of kettle corn. Ashleigh was our main server, bet everyone serves all the tables, which makes sure you're not waiting long for anything. 

The menu is awfully entertaining. I selected their chicken and waffles, i think it was called the chick-waffle-doo or something like that. We also got the Elote (corn) which was 3 small ears of corn with butter and some sauce that was TO DIE FOR!!!!!! Chicken breaded in corn flakes, over a Belgium waffle, 4 sweet potato tots and berry syrup.

Another in our group ordered the Chicken Satay. Which was chicken skewers braised in peanut sauce, served with sticky rice and cucumber salad. Can you say Aaaaaaa-mazing! 

The last person in our group of 3, the only one who had been there before, ordered some turkey sausage pretzlebun sliders and a grilled cheese. 

Last we shared a plate of sticky bun tacos. Which was heaven in a bun. Fried pork belly with some slaw jammed in a sticky bun shaped into a taco shell. 

To top it off we ordered thai tea, you only get one serving but it comes in a LARGE mason jar.

It was all fantastic, not too expensive and we left full with some to take home for later tonight!  
I've never gone to a tapas place before so I am a little green when it comes to this type of food...but the servers and chef couldn't be any less green. Everything suggested was just right.

I tried the basil mint lemonade, but it wasn't for me.  It had too much basil, not enough mint, and the basil overpowered the lemon flavor.  I just got the regular lemonade, which was good.

They bring you popcorn while you are looking at the menu, and it's GOOD.  I don't know what they put on it, but it seems like garlic powder and a bunch of other seasonings.  I bet it's crazy good when it's hot.  We ate 2 things of it.

To eat, we had 4 dishes:  the monte cristo, the short rib, the chicken littles, and the ricotta roll.  My favorite was the monte cristo, it was perfectly crisp, they use corn flakes in the batter.  The egg on top was over medium, which I prefer, I don't usually like eggs ALL the way runny.  It had excellent jam underneath.  I absolutely will get this again.

The short rib has a Dr. Pepper glaze.  This was too sweet, and overpowered the dish.  But, the short rib was perfectly cooked, very tender and easily pulled off the bone.  The dish needed salt and pepper to balance the sweetness.  But, after that was added, it was another winner that we will order again.

The ricotta roll was a miss for me.  This is basically fancy baked ziti.  The sauce needed garlic, it lacked flavor.  They serve it in a cast iron dish, which keeps it hot to the point it was hard to eat.  

The chicken littles were solid, you get a good portion for the price.  The sauce was more sweet and sour and not quite as much BBQ as we were expecting, given the menu mentions both.  But, it was solid.

All in all, very good prices, and a comfortable restaurant.  There were many other dishes we want to try, so we'll be back.",JXHrhT72U6sZJQSkFfNzjw,1,1,3,iLtwPhlsxHA5ok2IGPKatA

Nosh & Swig satisfied my  kingdom hunger minus the golden chalice and.. the royal beard of course.

I'm a sucker for venues that are inventive, unique and full of fanciful character. This was my first impression of the newby on East Flamingo that fixed up tantalizing tapas with inspired flavors that range from mexican, to japanese, chinese, thai, hawaiian and soul food.  

The service we received upon walking in was on point: Welcoming, confident and observant.  Noticing that we had kids in our party, they immediately supplied the lil' buggers with magnetic doodle pads which kept them occupied.  In no less than 5 minutes, out comes our bread and butter.. Except it wasn't bread and butter, it was a small pail of kettle corn.. Amazing idea!  It's the little things that make a big difference.

We open the pop artsy menu to find a pandora of dishes that go beyond the box of normality.  We travel the road often taken by ordering what other yelpers have suggested.  Mind you, the venue is ""tapa-centered"", so portions can be small, but it definitely did not lack in flavor.  On our list of goodies were: The Elote, Smokey Poke, The Monte Cristo, Baked & Glazed, Cocka-waffle-doo, Steve-O Grilled Cheese and two huge mason jars filled with Chata-effup and the Mint & Basil Lemonade.  I could have done without the Chata-effup (Shut the F up.. Didn't get it at first) but I couldn't have done without the Cocka-waffle-doo!! It was my fave among the list.  This dish can be slightly compared to frosty flake crusted waffles with fried chicken and a dash of dyslexia!  No, no, no.. this time the chicken was covered in frosted flakes and the waffles were left the F' alone.. Thats what I'm talkin' 'bout!  ..and the berry reduction that drenched the waffles made it all the more soul seductive.. And on top of that, they had ""Passin' Me By"" by The Pharcyde playing in the background, such a great pairing!

4974855,2013-05-03,1,C-u6Ywuq192icOblKm6oKg,"Last summer, I was initially really excited about the opening of Nosh & Swig after the owners were the very ones to tell us about the restaurant they were opening.  We waited and waited and bam, they finally opened.  We were further pumped as friends and fellow yelpers were loving them right and left.  We decided to wait a little while since it's on the other side of town for us, and a Groupon appeared.  I thought this was a sign that we better go check them out soon.  We did attempt to go on a Monday before realizing they were closed on Mondays.  But alas, we finally made it.

The waitress/owner gave us a little pail of complimentary sweet popcorn, which was a nice treat.  She even provided a toy for the Little Guy to play with, although she didn't bother bringing a plate, napkin, or utensils for him until I requested it.

* chicharron ""crisp pork belly, salsa roja, cucumber feta pico"" ($7) - When digging through this dish, I thought I found myself a huge portion of pork belly.  Imagine my disappointment when I bit into it and realized it was a tater tot.  Wtf?  The Husband thought maybe one just happened to fall into our dish, but realized that there were definitely tater tots all over.  I thought maybe they put that in as a filler because there was no mention on the menu or in anyone else's review about tater tots in this dish.  I felt this was rather misleading...why call it chicharron when there wasn't a whole lot of it there?  And looking at some of the other pics from previous diners, it looked like they got way more chicharron than we did.  We did get lots of green onion on top to cover the look. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nosh-and-swig-las-vegas?select=pFl95Lbk4GOXxwvN1PwA7A#pFl95Lbk4GOXxwvN1PwA7A

* lotza-mozza ""herb cheese, polenta cake, eggplant, melted tomato"" ($8) - This was a hard dish to cut up and share.  It was alright, except the polenta was more on the sweeter end than savory, which was what we were expecting. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nosh-and-swig-las-vegas?select=pFl95Lbk4GOXxwvN1PwA7A#bKXEGe37z9Ngf51yMSUejg

* pretzel brats ""chicken sausage, pretzel roll, cheese gravy, sauerkraut"" ($8) - The sausage was tough, although it was the Husband's favorite of what we ordered.  We would have liked a nicer mustard though.  I could hardly taste the sauerkraut in mine. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nosh-and-swig-las-vegas?select=pFl95Lbk4GOXxwvN1PwA7A#LEvUquseM9C-4fp92fupfw

* charred beef crostini ""coffee dusted beef, horseradish mousse, guyere baguette"" ($5.50) - I watched as the Husband went to take a bite and ended up putting the whole thing back down on the plate. The beef was way too tough to bite off and had to be cut with a knife and fork.  It was way too large to be a one bite crostini.  Other diners posted pics of getting four portions while we only got three.  They also got some sort of leafy green on theirs and we did not. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nosh-and-swig-las-vegas?select=pFl95Lbk4GOXxwvN1PwA7A#s5_TIPie29f7oyj2M8RPBQ

* statefair waffle sandwich ""waffle, vanilla ice cream, candy confetti, chocolate glaze, fun for everyone"" ($8) - I had seen photos of this from the very beginning and was stoked about getting it.  It didn't look as grand sadly enough.  We only got one waffle cut in half versus those who got 2 waffles.  We had one regular scoop of pink ice cream and a cone whereas others got more ice cream.  And there weren't any marshmallows as other pics showed.  It lacked the wow factor. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nosh-and-swig-las-vegas?select=pFl95Lbk4GOXxwvN1PwA7A#051tAtnhzaJbOlsBSM5BNg

Yes, we ate it all because we were starving.  The Husband went home and had some ramen because he was still hungry but wasn't interested in ordering more here.  It was a Sunday evening and there were a handful of other parties there.  A few more did arrive during our visit.  Water glasses were huge and we got a pitcher to refill ourselves, so there was no shortage of liquid available here.

I wish I had come in the beginning stages when they were more generous with their portions.  I think their food lacked consistency from what other diners got.  I understand that it's always different in the beginning and changes are bound to happen, but getting less food shouldn't be one of those changes.

I do love their clean design and font.  I think the menu is pretty clear cut, and the theme is good.  But the food just wasn't there for me on this visit.

4981595,2013-02-09,3,C-u6Ywuq192icOblKm6oKg,"This place has honestly taught me to never fall for a restaurant with barely 20 reviews, especially when 95% of them are all five stars, which is really hard to come by in the Yelp world unless you're friends with the owners or something.

Walked into the establishment and wasn't sure if it was open since no one acknowledged our presence. It wasn't until we asked the girl at the hostess stand if we had to sit ourselves, which was odd since there was only one other table sitting inside the restaurant around 6pm with more than five people on the floor. From that moment on, we had this weird vibe about the place knowing that the staff wasn't sure what they were doing, or had any knowledge when it comes to any type of customer service.

Next, let's talk about food. This place offers a variety of things and I like that. I mean, it's kind of what you would expect at a tapas restaurant, right? Reviewed the pictures on Yelp to double check what we wanted and decided to go with these:

Cock-A-Waffle: We honestly lowered our expectations since we're jaded with this famous concept from Roscoe's in Los Angeles but honestly, it was bland, dry and flaky. The fried chicken? Kind of similar to the fried chicken packs you could find in the deli section at Food-4-Less. The waffles? It was hard and tough. I had to drizzle my maple syrup all over the plate to soften it up a little then finally decided to call that my dessert.

Elote: On the menu it says that the corn are grilled, which we didn't even taste at all. It tastes as if they were just boiled while hiding that fact with random sauces and garnishes. That would have been ok if they didn't mention that they were grilled on the menu. But seriously, to mess up corn says a lot about a restaurant.

Dragon Claws: Their version of a Japanese popper. Probably the best thing that we've had there but doesn't even compare to the ones you'll find at any sushi restaurant.

We lost hope in this place and didn't remember the names of the last two items that we ordered. One was the bite-sized lasagna dish, served on top of a circular skillet plate and the other was similar to a steak bruschetta. Both were nothing special. Came to this place VERY hungry so you would think we would enjoy any kind of food but it turned out to be the exact opposite. Beverage glasses were thin and narrow so we didn't even get full off of water either and THAT was ok. We just wanted to leave to make up our experience with a better dinner somewhere else.

Maybe I'll give this restaurant another shot next year. Maybe then they'll finally decide to invest in an Aloha System so it doesn't take ten minutes to receive your check and ten minutes to process it (with a card). Maybe their staff will be better trained and knowledgeable about the menu as well so they won't have to disappear every now and then every time we would ask a question about a plate. Or maybe when this place has more than 100 reviews I'll reconsider this place again. Until then, I won't be coming back.",P49ulSRSHLNnIP-efK-qhw,14,5,1,XG4LJk8NgqF93bHPbrkwpw
5016911,2014-03-14,0,C-u6Ywuq192icOblKm6oKg,"I've been wanting to try this place and last Saturday I finally did! I had amazing company from my husband Joel, my good friend and fellow Yelper Dyanna L. and her boyfriend Brent. I can't tell u how much fun it is going out with these guys! I know Dyanna and Brent have been to Nosh & Swig several times so I looked to them on what to get. Their answer was everything is good! 

Nosh & Swig are a tapas type of place. So we of course ordered ALL the things and shared. We started with the Spicy Edamame and the deviled eggs. Once you start eating the Edamame you can't stop. Perfect spice! Next came out our Fondue which had apples, strawberries, bread, chips & some veggies to dip in the cheesy sauce. More food started coming out. Dyanna got the special which was a whole Seared Bass with the head and all! It was covered in a wonderful Sweet Chili sauce. It was excellent and a little birdie said it's going on their new menu in April. I'm so getting that next time. Joel had the Monte Cristo Sandwich which came with a berry compote. It was crispy and gooey with the fried egg on top. The Short Ribs came out next for Brent. I got the Dragons Claws. They were jalapenos stuffed with a spicy tuna and fried in tempura. The sauce on top was delicious. A great bite of food. We also all shared the Sticky Bun Tacos. Which I loved. Mmmmm pork belly. The Korean Bbq Wings had the perfect amount of spice. The Pretzel Brats were so tasty. I could have eaten like five more of those. The Chicken Apple Sausage is a great complement to the cheese gravy.We of course had to get dessert. Joel ordered the Cookiemon. It was cookie dough cooked in a little cast iron skillet with Vanilla Ice Cream on top. Mmmm so yummy. Brent got the Happy Ending it's kinda like a Thai Ice Cream taco. 

I think that is pretty much all we ordered. It was a lot of food and really not that expensive for what we got. The service was excellent. The Chef even came out and talked to us and made sure we liked everything. I hear they have music on Friday nights. I'm for sure going back for more and more!

The location is in an odd part of town and in an odd complex, but I was able to find it just fine. When we entered there was only one other party seated there, a table full of teachers on a Friday night. It was kind of funny! 

The decor is modern, clean, and diner like with booths, high tables and chairs, and solid colors. The menu is full of amazing items! Served tapas-style so they are pretty small portions, but quite filling. 

My friend and I were awed by the selection. The menu categorizes the tapas so it was easy to pick and choose from each page. 

We had the aloha Tri tips, the two chef's specials items of the night, which were tomato cream soup in a cute coffee mug with a mini grilled cheese sandwich on the side and deep fried cheese/rice balls (so delicious!), we also had the seasoned/herbed corn on the cobs, Mac and cheese, chicken bites, and also tried their mango moscato! So sweet and yummy, tasted like juice. 

Our bill came out smaller than expected considering we felt like we ordered everything on the menu and with tapas the price always seems to add up, so it was a nice surprise in the end.

It was definitely nice to finally meet you guys, plenty of Yelpers to talk food and everything else for that matter!  So how does the food fare?

There were a lot of really good dishes!  Some of them were not so memorable though.  I will start off with the yummy ones!

1)  Dr. Pepper short ribs!  This was the reason why I came here!  Well, besides the Yelp meet anyways lol.  I had very high expectations, and it did not disappoint!  The meat is super tender, almost like pot roast, and pulled apart very easily with a fork.  The cornbread underneath was a very cool combination!  The only dish I considered ordering more than one, and every time I come here, it will be on my table!

2)  Monte Cristo!  Never had one of these before.. It was very yummy, with a fried over easy egg on top....a complete breakfast in a sandwich!  I will order this one again!

3)  PB&J was excellent.  Imagine a fried PB&J...it tastes even better than that lol.  This was one of the best dishes of the night...I will order this again.

4)We ordered the truffle tots by themselves...can't say how much it was, but it was cheaper than getting the whole sampler.  The tots are very salty, but still good in my eyes.  You can taste the truffle oil, but the cheese + salt was a little too salty.  I would still probably order these again.

5)  Dragon claws were cool.  It tastes like sushi wrapped into a jalapeno lol.  Fish tasted fresh and the whole combo works well.  Not sure if I will order again though.

6)  Pretzel bratz with chicken sausage was cool.  They were like sliders with pretzel bread.  I was soo full at this point, but it was a nice dish to order.  I might order it again.

7)  Smokey Poke was good.  The fish was nice and tender, tasted like sushi quality, but there was so much ponzu on there.  I really enjoy sushi, so you will probably like it....I just am used to enjoying the fish for themselves without being covered up.  I'd probably skip this one next time.

8)  Fondue cheese itself was great.....The sides were not so much.  One of the sides looked like hamburger bread lol.  Most of the others were too big or two long, so you had to cut them all in half or more.  The skewer sticks didn't do the job well, so we ate it all with the fork.  I wouldn't order it again.

9)  We tried the creme cheese lote too...didn't do much for me at all.  Barely tasted the creme cheese...it was pretty bland IMO and not an adjective I would use for a desirable dessert.  I would not order this again.

Service was decent, and dishes took around 10-15min from order to table, even with our large party.  Cool tapas place to check out, with a chic/trendy feel to it.

When it comes food many of us Eastsiders are well, used to, the same crap; countless run down fast food places situated next to run down establishments.  So when Nosh & Swig opened up a few months ago presenting their tapas plates and items on the menu like ""monte cristo"", ""tiger cry"", and ""mini mi's"" they offered us something alien and I believe I overheard the community let out a big, not unheard before... ""Huh?""

Enjoying Nosh & Swig's food is like staring at an old painting on the wall.  One looks at it before enjoying it.  Each plate is made to be both a presentation and an award on the palate.  Menu items vary from pork, ham, salmon, shrimp, beef, kale, edamame, greens, chicken, brisket, all the way to caviar - and are topped with béchamels, nam priks, aranchinis --- a hodgepodge of fresh delectable ingredients.
  
Yet, Nosh & Swig is expensive.  Plates range from $7/$8 to the $11/$12 dollar range, each.  For a table of two lunch bordered on the $100 range or as we like to call it ""Go to an all you can eat Sushi place!"" price.

And, Nosh & Swig are also in their infant stage.  Twice now I've gone to visit their establishment and twice now the doors have been closed, during operating hours as noted on their door.  It is a little hard to plan to eat there when, and I'm guessing, they decide to shut down for the evening whenever they want.

Self described as 'a food festival of funzies' and offering an 'express train to Flavortown' I was admittedly a bit leery as I entered Nosh & Swig but with a menu that at least seemed willing to take some risks and myself already in the area I decided to take a peak - my meal as unwieldy as the options themselves in a room that seemed to suggest some sort of spiritualism beneath the blare of Top-40.  Apparently part of some recent food-television contest, at least according to the only other diners present during the first half of my hour-long stay, and featuring the sort of service where patrons are frequently referred to a 'buddy' or 'bro,' it was just a few minutes prior to noon that I entered the sizable strip-mall space and seating myself after grabbing a menu it would not be long before 'crack corn' and water arrived - the former a relatively straightforward salty-sweet combo with that wasn't particularly addictive, though a bit more interesting than boring bread-service to be sure.  Clearly a kitchen where tongue-in-cheek and whimsy are part of the show it was in a duo of vegetables that my meal began and although the Peas and Carrots was decidedly delicious with plenty of vegetal sweetness amidst the crisp wontons, the ""beeten apple"" was mostly forgettable - a stacked pseudo-bruschetta compromised by lifeless bread with honey and apple mostly overwhelming both cheese and thinly cut beets.   Moving next to options from the pork and chicken parts of the menu it was the Monte Cristo that arrived first and griddled rather than fried the sandwich was far lighter than usual, a fact furthered by far too little filling to go with just a drizzle of jam.  Moving next to a clever presentation of Chicken and Waffles that proved to be the best savory of the meal as both the waffle and chicken showed well, it was here that my server inexplicably tried to end the afternoon by offering the check and acting as if I'd eaten 'a lot' despite each plates' modest portions I assured him I would like to go on - a duo of desserts again representing a hit-and-miss proposition as the enormous Chinese-donut-come-churro was excellent on its own - and even moreso when crumbled into the ice cream - while S'mores were poorly executed with marshmallows not warmed through and the chocolate a dense chunk inside the oily outer shell.

Probably a space better suited for large-group sharing, particularly if paired with enough drinking to make the 'funzies' seem more fantastic, Nosh & Swig almost seems to be trying to out-Fieri the Mayor of Flavortown himself - a half-hearted attempt that seemed to fall on deaf ears when I mentioned the flaws in execution on both the 'bruschetta' and the S'mores - the later actually garnering a ""yeah yeah, I can see that, bro"" when I pointed out what seemed to be a half-dissolved Hershey Kiss inside the remaining wonton I sent back to the kitchen untouched.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,2,2,3,a1fHAf6odmoUxTG8sw1UlQ

CHATTA EFF UP: Mexican horchata meets Spanish horchata. Cinammon-y taste of Mexican horchata with the graininess of Spanish horchata.  It was the perfect drink for all the food we got. 5/5

CHICHARRON: for $7, you get a bowl of crispy pork belly with cucumbers, feta, tomatoes, beans and tots.  This was my favorite item on the menu.  It was a great play on different flavors and textures. 5/5

MONTE CRISTO: fried sandwich with ham and gruyere cheese.  Their version has corn flakes, fried egg on top and strawberry puree. 4/5

RIB STACK: Shawn recommended this dish since it's his favorite.  Pork ribs braised in Dr. Pepper served with corn bread.  Honestly, it was too sweet for my taste. But the pork was so tender. 3/5

POMME FRITES: it tastes like the fries I make at home so it's not something special. 3/5

TRUFFLE TOTS: I enjoy anything with truffles/ truffle oil. This was a bit lacking in truffle flavor but it was still good.  4/5

WARM PB&J: fried PB sandwich sliced into 4 pieces dusted with powdered sugar. You dip your sandwich in jelly, chocolate syrup or cream/condensed milk that are on your plate. 5/5

I was immediately greeted by the chef in the kitchen and the server.  I told them I was waiting for a friend (shoutout Shirley B) and the server sat me with a menu asked if she could take my drink order.  

When Shirley arrived we were mulling over the menu, which has a large assortment of small dishes.  The server was super nice and offered to help answer questions about any of the meals.  Her enthusiasm for the restaurant and the food was infectious - I was, like, so excited to try a million dishes!  She also gave us advice on how much to order and if we hadn't listened to her we surely would have had way too many leftovers.  She started us out with a little bucket of sweet & salty popcorn.  Sweet and salty anything is like a dream for me.  Also, big ups to her for keeping water filled the entire time.   

We had quite the variety at our table.  Cock-a-Waffle-Doo, a cornflake crusted fried chicken on top of a waffle served with a blueberry maple syrup reduction, was not only adorably named but a fun and delicious dish to eat!  Baked & Blazed, a fusilli pasta with white cheddar cheese was a mac & cheese dish to die for.  And not small by any means!  These are just a couple of dishes among others.  

For dessert - COOKIEMON!  Warm chocolate chip cookie made mushy and delicious when topped with vanilla ice cream.  How can you beat this simple but savory dessert dish?

Simplistic/modern but colorful decor that almost feels like it's missing something.  There are cubes on the wall near the kitchen and you can see the holes where a couple of them are missing.  I'm not taking off stars for that but I just feel like this place needs something to make it ""complete"".   Mixture of low and hightop tables and booths in a larger dining room than you imagine from the outside.  I loved the music choices but every now and then I would ""tune in"" and hear Bob Marley.  I LOVE Bob Marley but maybe a little more variety?  Once I noticed Reel Big Fish was playing.  Cool haha, don't hear that every day.  One small snag when Shirley B. presented her Groupon.  The groupon was written on the check but not reflected in the total.  She sorted it out right away with no hassle.  I read in another review that someone else had this small issue.  Hmm.  

This place overall will have me coming back because there are so many small dishes that I have yet to try!  Great place to come with friends and split a variety of plates so you can dig into all of them.",rNjgVKaBh1PlUA6dYB6EUw,3,3,4,lUOnu4JmvsdVEGY8K8GUGA

Sometimes there is a new server who may be a little slow on their roll, but everyone is always extremely nice and they are ready to offer up a recommendation if you are second guessing your order.

The chef has been rotating the menu lately, and I love it. He has come out of the kitchen to personally serve me and my family because we are regulars, and he exudes passion for his craft and will go into detail about his ideas and his new creations. The vibe there is so friendly and laid back, no pretentious snobbery going on at all.

I'd like to recommend at least one dish, but I've had so many and I cannot choose! The mini banh mi sandwiches are fantastic, and the seafood paella was creamy and delicious. I also love getting their green apple iced tea, which tastes like eating a fresh apple, I simply cannot do it justice with words.

If Nosh is far from you, then I guess dine at your own risk. I certainly don't drive to Summerlin often, if ever, for dinner, but that's usually because I have Nosh within walking distance and know I can get an amazing meal there. But if you are looking to support something local and not some chain or casino restaurant, then you really should give this place a shot, they're worth it.",w6RLJEFWup2iWQpgvun--g,1,0,5,Njkxk-yI8azUrgNwEvT3hA
5476698,2013-01-09,4,C-u6Ywuq192icOblKm6oKg,"I am really in two minds about this place, a second visit will be needed, by then I hope they have the place running smoothly AND they take notice of a couple of reviews on here, mine and CF would be a good start.

We showed up early, just after 5, as the only customers in the place I was happy to be greeted and sat immediately.

The menu is ok, no where near as extensive as some Tapas places I have been to, but there should be a couple of dishes for everyone

The drinks, yep I have to agree here with CF, taking a thin glass, filling it with ice, then adding a very small amount of liquid isn't the way to go, design over use strikes again, you can get away with that if you are serving premium drinks, but these are not premium.

I really need to get this out of the way now, this place screams of an owner thinking about what he likes rather than what his desired customers would like. The seating looks good, but in reality isn't that comfortable and the music choice...Where do I begin, ok, they are aiming for a hip crowd, fair enough, but hip crowds also have kids, gangsta rap really isn't the best idea in the world, to be playing in a restaurant at 5pm, I personally can just block it out, but with the demographic of the area (predominantly older) yeah they may have issues....I totally get that a restaurant should be an extension of the owner/chef, but a neighborhood tapas place isn't the right venue....Anyways food for thought.

On to the important stuff, the food. :

There are some very good dishes, then there are some that I really just wanted to run in the kitchen, grab one of the iron skillets and smack the chef upside the head, just so I could get a clear picture of what he was thinking.

The sticky bun tacos, very nice, the pork belly pieces could have been a bit bigger, but overall a good dish.

Monte Cristo, certainly one of the gems, a great combination.

gai satay, I was in two minds about this dish, I love traditional satay, this is not a traditional version, but after my second piece I decided I liked it, leaving the skin on gives it a slightly different taste and a way different texture.

The Hodgepodge....Ok, this is the dish that had me almost running to the kitchen and is the main reason this place got 3 stars instead of 4 (well ok, hearing the F bomb dropped every 10 seconds for the first 20 minutes we were there also helped, but mostly this dish).

If you are going to open a Tapas restaurant, DO NOT BUY AND SERVE products purchased from US Foods or Crisco, the potato tots I can forgive in this respect, but french fries and sweet potato fries directly from the bag, you have got to be kidding me.

Make the fries fresh, it's easy to do, cheaper for the restaurant and they taste better. A way better dish would be just taking the tater tots by themselves, they tasted great, the fries tasted just like they had come from a bag, sad.

For dessert, well actually I was going to pass, but the cream cheese lote sounded good, so we decided to split it.....And there was the best dish of the night perfect texture, great taste, the only let down was the fork, it wasn't plastic, but it was one of those that are so thin, when you look at them they bend and in fact, ours did bend, yes a crepe (call it Thai flat bread if you like it isn't, but whatever) bent two forks....

This place has potential, but it needs a reality check or it won't be around long, the staff are pleasant, the service quick and friendly, this could be a great place with just a little thought put into it.",5XKjVehgGzb5dJocdI-36Q,18,6,3,FKpdc31yNDfnbmvTMUil7w
5588193,2013-10-19,2,C-u6Ywuq192icOblKm6oKg,"I was really excited to check this place out.  The menu looked pretty awesome when I checked it out online.  Reviews here, to sum up, seemed to be pretty mixed, with one's experience tied pretty closely to ordering the right things on the menu.  Armed with knowledge gleaned from other reviews, the lady and I rolled over there on a Friday night at 7:00pm.

The parking lot was a ghost town.  There were two tables being served.  Not a good sign, but hey, let's give it a shot.

We were immediately greeted by a friendly young guy who took us to a table of our choosing.  We were also immediately greeted by a NASTY smell in the air.  It smelled like someone dropped a deuce under a table.  Five days earlier.  This eau de outhouse permeated the entire restaurant.  I'm not the kind of guy who is up for making a big deal out of things.  I was fully prepared to try and ignore it and have some dinner.  The lady?  Not so much.

""Ummmm.... excuse me.  Do you smell that?""

Our host/server sheepishly replied, ""Haha... yeah, I guess I'm just kind of used to it.  It comes and goes around here.  It's the whole area.""

Now, I'm not a huge fan of the East Side in general, but come on.  The parking lot smelled fresh as a daisy by comparison.  There is clearly something horribly wrong with this building, and I hope that the young owners of Nosh and Swig have an attorney to help them get out of whatever ugly lease they are tied up in.  

After he said he'd be back to take our drink orders, we held our breath, and made a beeline for the front door.

I feel awful for them - and I hope they can get into another location.  One that doesn't smell like the parking garage of the Four Queens.  Two tables at prime time on a Friday night?  How many more Fridays can they possibly have in that space?",Azo9HLEoLJ3T52sO4xRY5g,5,0,1,gBKwSDCi-tKu-XiwUVe_TA
5599613,2014-02-09,0,C-u6Ywuq192icOblKm6oKg,"Just another one of those amazing places that eluded an initial review due to mad focus on handling business.  Yelp...better late than never.

I was surprised to learn that one of our sister departments is no more than a few miles away, if that, and none of my patnahs know how to Nosh or Swig.

I headed out this way to put in my last payment on this year's fantasy basketball league, having snuck into the finals.  What better way than to top it off with some good grinds.  The commish of the league was the first of honor.  
I can't quite remember everything I had the first time I was here, but could almost guarantee the menu consisted of the sticky buns, kalbi sliders and... like I said, I was too busy smashing my face in the endless tapas we ordered then.  I do remember getting the grilled cheese sandwich with the Tokyo crepes that was to die for.  Crepes sushi rolled with shiitake mushrooms, sprouts and other veggies all forming a perfect union and big flavor for a non-meat item.

There have been some good memories in the two whole times I have been here, considering I am rarely in this hood.  I do recall that the first time here, the place was closed down due to some mindless vandalizing.  The next time, I got revenge with a good friend visiting from Virginia and Seattle.  Now, I made sure to share another good moment with another satisfied homie, I'

They have tapas options that they separate by beef, poultry, fish, vegetables, etc and the descriptions of all the items makes you want to order everything!

The food came fast and was also very very good. The drink menu was elaborate and had drinks on it that I had never seen before and I have worked around building drink menus before.

For a tapas place, their portions are decent.  I ordered 3 items and was full and the bill was about $24.

Monte Cristo - Again was the highlight of what I ordered.

Pretzel Brats - Was good, but the sauerkraut was curiously lacking in flavor (as if it was rinsed), and maybe deli mustard would have been better than the plain mustard.

Short Ribs - last two sold out just before I ordered it.  Sadness.

Sticky Buns Tacos - Decent, but some of the pork belly were still tough and the rind too tough to chew and swallow. Glad I tried it, but it was a one and done for me.

Service was great. Was greeted immediately by one of the staff within seconds of walking in.  Ordering, delivering the prepared items from the kitchen, refilling the water, etc. were all positive.

I really enjoyed the 80s playlist of songs that was not blaring out of the speakers, although for a few moments I thought it was what was on MTV at the time.

5960143,2013-03-19,4,C-u6Ywuq192icOblKm6oKg,"I love small plates, oh yes I do. I have wanted to try this place since they opened and once I saw the Groupon deal available, that cinched the deal. 

I came here with my mom and fella for an early lunch while we were running errands in the area over the weekend. Walking in the place was empty, but since it was so early, we cut them some slack. We were seated quickly, in a booth of our choosing. The table was a little wobbly, but ok. Perusing the menu, I was drawn to all the interesting and creative menu items. We decided to order quite a few different items and share them, which is what I love about small plate restaurants. Sharing is caring after all, y'all.

We tried the Nachos O'brien, Monte Cristo, Chicharron, Carne Asada Sliders, Sticky Bun Tacos, Elote, Pescado Frito and Singapore Greens. We clearly over ordered, but we were excited to try as many things as we could. The standouts to me were the Nachos O'brien, Chicharron and Elote. Everything was solid, but I would definitely steer away from the sandwiches and sliders next time. The Sticky Bun Tacos were tasty, but the bao wasn't the freshest I have ever had. I quite enjoyed the filling and would definitely order this again. The Chicharron and Elote were spicy and oh so tasty. The addition of tator tots was an interesting flavor added to the chicharron, but it was still really good. I could eat these two dishes all day long. Everything on the menu was really fun and innovative. I enjoyed the play on words and cheeky item names. You've gotta love food with a sense of humor.

Our server was incredibly attentive and came back with refills very regularly. If only their cups and glasses were a larger, more reasonable size, then she probably wouldn't have had to come back and forth with refills quite so often. There were quite a few cooks in the kitchen as well and all our food came out quickly and almost rapid fire at one point. My guess is because they weren't too busy, they were able to focus all their attention on us. Service was fun, food was great and I can't wait to come back with a larger party to enjoy some more of their fun cuisine.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,7,8,4,7RaYyOunA2cTrQVLmnEobw
5983706,2014-02-03,1,C-u6Ywuq192icOblKm6oKg,"The whole place could benefit from one word: refinement. 

I get the cool & swanky decor, but the booth we sat in was falling apart at the seams and the seats were incredibly worn. Plus, the purple and ivory for some reason feel vaguely reminiscent of an 70s porno stage or something. The environment could've benefited from some polishing touches, like new booths and such.

Onto the food:
The bf and I ordered 2 dishes each, and that was definitely enough food for us both.
Tropical fruit tea - The sweet flavoring syrup (tasted like lychee) was very obvious in the tea, but it was still refreshing & delicious. I did end up watering it down after a bit, which significantly helped dilute the syrup, but it was good.
Pretzel brats - The top pretzel bun was toasted perfectly and had wonderful crunch to it. The item as a whole seemed a tad dry. It could've benefited from more sauerkraut or cheese sauce or something, but I felt the need to visit my glass of water or tea after every bite. Pretzel buns tend to be on the saltier/dryer side, and not much in this dish provided for moisture or hydration. But these were pretty good.
Monte Cristo - It was a pretty typical monte cristo. Nothing bad, but nothing to write home about.
Sticky Bun Tacos - The sticky buns were unfortunately dry and were visibly cracking. The pork belly was good, but the flavors seemed like they could've been developed and infused more. A more moist bun and deeply flavored pork belly would've really made this dish a stand out.
Short Rib Sliders - When you did get every ingredient in a bite (apple, bleu cheese, petite green, and short rib) it was delicious. But the ingredients were unevenly distributed and therefore each bite was incomplete. I got a huge chunk of bleu cheese in one bite (and don't get me wrong, I love bleu cheese), but the sweetness & crispness of the apple would've elevated and evened out that bite more. 

All in all, it was okay. But as previously stated, the restaurant would benefit from some refinement in both the decor and execution of the food. I would go back, but I wouldn't go out of my way to do so. Also, I'd probably go back to try happy hour.",V93YZAMFAF4eejiIPRs0zw,1,1,3,a9V8ryuq38qa_oHj5ucOTA
