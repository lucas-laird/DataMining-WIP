The decor is typical of a mainstream ice cream shop and has very bright lighting. Its usually clean and the customer service is average. What makes me give this place a good rating? Well its the fact that their products with chocolate (like the hot chocolate) actually taste like good quality chocolate. The ice cream and shakes are pretty good too. Also if you go on a Friday or Saturday night after 10pm you get a great view of ""the show"" that goes on at the carnival court @ Harrah's (right next door).  Its the #1 spot on my list for people watching in Las Vegas.",TtV527nQhO9ziCMEIhGEKg,1,1,3,hrHXCi2zfwjgvyER38B9Qg

1709246,2011-02-20,13,_7EsArRtaywrPasvA8ryfg,"***Ghirardelli offers very expensive sundaes that are similar to the type of sundae you would get at a chain family restaurant though the hot fudge is good***

This Ghirardelli shop is located near Harrah's on The Strip.  This shop features both Ghirardelli chocolate (mostly their signature squares but other options as well) and an old-fashioned ice cream and fountain shop.  They make shakes here as well as many different kinds of sundaes.

I went with their signature hot fudge sundae, which consisted of two scoops of vanilla ice cream, hot fudge, whipped cream, chopped almonds, and a maraschino cherry.

I remember liking their sundae (at the least the one I had in San Diego a long time ago).  I have probably had much better ice cream desserts since then; it did not really stand up as well today.  The big problem with the sundae was that while the hot fudge was good and chocolatey, everything else was standard stuff.  The ice cream was a kind of light and whipped ice cream (kind of like Thrifty ice cream), which is not my favorite style of ice cream.

The sundae also had the problem of melting too quickly.  It became more of an ice cream soup because the ice cream was not cold and firm enough.

Service was good and quick.  The sundae maker brought the sundae to the table (he even brought out extra spoons for everyone to share).

Pricing seemed high.  The sundae was almost $9 though I imagine that most sundaes in Las Vegas would cost that much.

The hot fudge sundae at Ghirardelli was a lot like something you would find at a family chain restaurant.  Going in with the right expectations, the sundae is satisfying enough.  Still, for the price of the sundae here, you could probably find a much better sundae elsewhere (maybe at one of the Haagen Dazs locations in Las Vegas).

For parking, you can park at one of the several nearby casinos like Harrah's.",w-w-k-QXosIKQ8HQVwU6IQ,17,15,2,ewYy8Rny2m_wl7x_3JNZng

(There's this peppermint kind at Christmas - and I'm not big on the peppermint - but I think it actually stopped my heart once, it was that good.)  This little shop nestled in the corner of the Harrah's Carnival Court saved my butt many a time during the Swing Dance craze of the late 90s (when the Carnival Court was the only place for an underage dancer to dance, yo!) and still remains a Strip staple of mine to this day.

All this Cold Stone crap makes me mad.  Sometimes, I just want some ice cream, and I don't want no crap in it.  And I DEFINITELY don't want a high school kid to sing to me while they make it.  Just some ice cream, please.

I have gotten the hot chocolate and it was rich and delicious.  Don't know what the other reviewer was talking about it being watered down.

1) It's a Ghiradelli Ice Cream Shop. Duh! 

2) Being big fans of Ghiradelli's hot fudge sundaes, we stopped in here our last afternoon in Las Vegas, because, dammit, we could.  If you've been to a Ghiradelli Ice Cream Shop, you know the system is a) order as you enter, b) take a number, c) have your food brought to you. 

We ordered.  He, a large hot fudge sundae. Me, a small.  After we'd ordered and paid, we realized we forgot to ask for the dark chocolate hot fudge which is our favorite and very cool.  We went back to the person we'd ordered from to ask if we could change our order to this, but she told us our sundaes had already been made. 

When they brought them though, they had messed up my order -- bringing only a single scoop of ice cream instead of a sundae (the horrors!).  As they went to remake my sundae, the person we'd ordered from went running back to tell them to use the dark chocolate hot fudge instead of the default milk chocolate.

One night, after getting bored watching my husband play craps on the strip, we decided to wander on down.  The music drew us in, but the ice cream kept us there!

The inside was bright and clean.  They had a little section where you could buy their individually wrapped chocolates and everything, and then a large counter where they make delicious creations.

It was 10:45 at night, and they closed at 11 that night, but they encouraged me to take my time choosing.  I ordered a layered peanut butter and chocolate sundae to go.  I also added marshmallow fluff.  It was the best decision I have ever made.

This sundae was EPIC.  It was seriously so delicious, and it will haunt my dreams until I am able to get more!  There is a Ghirardelli's ice cream shop in the city, and I am tempted to make a special trip downtown JUST for another sundae alone!  It was THAT good.

5806916,2007-06-20,0,_7EsArRtaywrPasvA8ryfg,"What is Nature's most perfect food?  It's obviously either ice cream or chocolate, but why decide?  Get a hot fudge sundae and have the best of both worlds.  Ghirardelli is a San Francisco chocolate company, but they also operate a number of ice cream shops.  Sure, the shops sell chocolate, but ice cream is their raison d'etre.

The simple menu displays pictures of a number of sundaes - caramel, berry, butterscotch and the like - but the hot fudge sundae takes pride of place.  ""World Famous HOT FUDGE SUNDAE"" and ""Home-made hot fudge sauce fresh daily,"" the menu proclaims.  ""Indulge yourself with the Ghirardelli Classic Two scoops of premium vanilla ice cream overflowing with our fresh home-made hot fudge sauce, whipped cream, chopped almonds and a cherry.""  You may also custom order, specifying type of ice cream, sauce(s), and toppings.


I of course order the hot fudge sundae.  Ghirardelli did many things right.  First, they used a heavy piece of real glass.  It was cup/bowl shaped; while some might prefer a more tapered design, I won't quibble.  Second, they provided a long handled spoon.  Most importantly, their hot fudge was good - not great, not life changing, but good - and there's enough of it.  However, there was one significant flaw - the ice cream.  It was OK, but not especially good.  Worse yet, it was served very hard.
