The burger was super beefy and excellent, as I've come to expect from this chain, and the fries were fresh, crispy, and delicious.",6LMAGpefYskaNPn4w0h5kw,0,0,5,-zIKGGiBWy8SGXFqM0NJSg
2589546,2017-01-27,0,sED2nCJYPWgjTK64_x9IRw,I never write bad reviews but this location is horrible. I placed my order and waited 10 minutes and watched 2 people that ordered after me get their food before me. I thought this was fast food. I just got a refund and left. It wasn't even that busy.,ibvANuQ5EfR4djKG7oltfg,0,0,1,6Wu0eIZA2usS1Gs6WAJYPg

I finally got a chance to try Carl's Jr since we don't have them where I lived in NY. I got the Guacamole Bacon Burger, which is made from 100% Black Angus beef. Let me just say,  that burger was jumbo sized and delicious- I could barely finish mine. I didn't even trust my fries. I am a fan, next time I will have to try their zucchini fries.",rypcWiSNGM0suWsiSLh9xA,1,1,5,C_Fdt8VgHnhsX6gA83WD0A

I called to make a large order,40 double sliders and they knocked it out right away. 
When I arrived everyone was kind and helpful!

Thank you!",kzd8RMZKbDoZF133UjNRVA,0,0,5,SMhqPoXq3l0TgnymbW0Iog

Small shift of members for a saturday. Rose was runnin around crazy but did it with a smile & offered any help to the customers. Very nice staff.",ryqJ5re09J5u94jDVImCew,1,0,4,ARiHC6Ie_dNIxgDsbkpTvw
5967613,2017-04-10,5,sED2nCJYPWgjTK64_x9IRw,Their teriyaki burger is the best! They are even better than any hawaiian bbq place I've been to in the valley and that's kind of sad because their's is the closest to an actual teriyaki burger from the islands. I always order it minus the fancy smancy pineapple and onion. Blah. Fruit should not be on an type of food except dessert dishes. Drive thru workers are very friendly and cheerful which is nice to see especially during the lunch rush.,Znid_azpcHmdRMHGicmkWA,7,8,4,0Ry3xzNniV326wmhrgYY2A
