I explain to the manager what happened and she starts laughing. Then goes on to tell me ""we encourage people to place orders online"". It shouldn't matter how I place an order.

Food was cooked and seasoned perfectly. I'm so glad they opened this location, we used to go to the 7017 Spring Mountain Rd location for over 10 years but the service went down hill ,they use to take the food to your table but I guess they stopped doing that and traded it for a bar stool where they sit in behind the register, they don't even stand up to take your order. As for the food it sucks, the wings feel rubbery and always lack enough sauce. Plus there's some perverted fat bald short guy working there, he straight up stares woman up and down. I know because he did that to my wife I laughed at him and said what's this fool staring at and the guy acted like he didn't hear me. He also loves engaging in long awkward conversations with single woman, trust me I've seen him do it on several occasions. Feel bad for them you can see how uncomfortable they are by there face.

1540672,2017-07-25,0,SQHhAQi-sGqKRMFDlTbR5w,"Nope. You (Wingstop) had one chance to do it right and couldn't.  I ordered the Family Meal (24 pcs) for me and the wife. (We were starving and looking forward to the chow.)  The cashier put everything into a bag, then the bag into a plastic bag. Good thing. The paper bag's bottom was soaked by the time I got home and the plastic bag? It was was leaking.  

The food was overcooked and tough to chew. We'd ordered three sets of 8-piece plain, lemon pepper and garlic Parmesan plus corn and veggies. The food had no taste at all. The plain wasn't even seasoned in any way; just fried in oil. Cardboard tastes better. Of the other two, I found they were just plain wings with flavoring powdered on the outside. Dry as a bone. The corn made up for the lack of seasoning by being WAY over-seasoned.  The dressing was watered down to a thin, soupy consistency.

I'm disappointed beyond belief.  A trip back for a second chance is not in their future.",2Fhn9QvBYxt_NtMIiXXwdw,0,0,1,ZAec1xlsSVnoPWQ9J2c4Ew

Any place that I spend almost $30 for something and still have to come out of my pocket and my own fridge for something , just isn't worth it.

3019662,2018-04-21,0,SQHhAQi-sGqKRMFDlTbR5w,"My wife and I made an order yesterday on 4/20. In order to beat the crowd, we called ahead so we would just have to show up and pay, unfortunately, that's not how it worked out. 
(Despite waiting on hold for 10 min, making a very clear and concise order, and having the correct order repeated back to us.) 

Here is my advise to this location on things they need to clearly improve on:

1.) If there's a holiday or otherwise a day in which you know you will be slammed, please make sure to have your strongest cashiers scheduled to work.

2.) If you do in fact have a weak cashier, it might not be a good idea to have the other cashier hold his line as well to help the slow one. It only holds up both lines. See how that works?

3.)  If you're going to have 2 lines (one for call ahead orders) make sure your cashier pays attention, and makes sure there is no one there for pick up so that the regular line doesn't think pick up customers are cutting the line.

4.) If YOU mess up on an order because your employees are not prepared/ trained correctly, don't catch an attitude with your customers, especially regulars. You actually need customers in order to stay in business.

and finally  

5.) Get a better night manager,the one you have panics under the slightest pressure and then your other staff reflect that.

Small low key spot for some wings. Servers were very nice. I ordered the mango habanero, garlic parmesan and the lemon pepper. 

Boy the mango habanero really have some  kick to it. I really enjoyed this flavor. The garlic Parmesan was okay I enjoyed it a lot less. The last flavor lemon pepper chicken was pretty much horrible. All I taste was salt, really tough to eat. I paid for it so I had to munch away anyways. 

Wish the cooks took more time preparing, 20 minutes for salt chicken was tough to eat. Everything else was pretty much perfect. Not my first time here. But I'll be back !",Vd24R1OnKzw8WjHLrrDTtw,2,2,3,n2ta6A2gH7qP40xgsM23gQ

My brother and I went when it was busy and waited 15 minutes to get our food which was pretty fast for how many people were in there, just in case though I would recommend calling in your order. 
The staff is friendly and they keep in clean. I saw at least 2 people cleaning the whole time we were there.

We tried the new Brazilian dry rub and the normal Atomic.  Both were great.  If you like wings and a great atmosphere for a quick meal.

Best part can be on how they keep the food coming out in time never really have to wait. I would say they have my favor kind of wing better then Buffalo Wild Wings.,JqZYNIVBS0FYpTsJDlaHGg,0,0,4,9yu0Sxjj930IL7NzNx4-qg
5239173,2017-02-25,0,SQHhAQi-sGqKRMFDlTbR5w,FEATHERS ON MY WINGS. Not okay. Not cool. I will never be going back to wing stop. I should have never strayed from Buffalo Wild Wings. I understand you make so many wings so you maybe don't notice but I am paying good money for wings. Not wings with chicken feathers. I would be giving 0 stars on here if it was possible. There's no way this is normal I've checked online.,wy-FrNKJvBBBXa4-6Z950A,0,0,1,x4-vn-IJXwE0NqslEAd7_w

My first time here and the boneless wings are chewy as can be, which I'm praying is because they were frozen and not undercooked, we'll find out tomorrow... the blue cheese is tasteless, and the fries are oddly sweet? I was really hoping to have found a great wing spot, but all I found this evening was disappointment",R0y5IO1MNwcAScmJMowN-g,0,0,1,awgWgGO-hS4YEe0guX94DQ

Nancy was my cashier and she handled my order really well and went above and beyond what I would expect from a cashier at a counter place. She made me feel welcome and handled a few special requests I had with my order with no problem. 

Frankly, I knew I would come back to this place before I even had my wings because I appreciated the level of attention paid by each member of the staff to the customer experience. 

Even so, my wings were delish. I got ten garlic Parmesan and if you get the full meal - 10 wings, a soda and a side with two huge sauces - there is excellent value for money. 

IRecommend this place for wings for sure.",sWLXpqNLhIBi_4QOPwKPog,0,0,5,AbHgr5kWbX5FGtwCz12ipw

The fries were cold and they were ridiculously high! I've eaten at many wing stops before and this by far was the worse ever! I will not be eating at another wing stop anywhere ever again! The cooks need to learn to fry chicken if they wanna have a career in frying chicken",WsYny0rvcJPUXpuKeEYcjA,0,0,1,UZXS1IA-0N3Zf3e5VS7GrA
5878300,2016-12-10,0,SQHhAQi-sGqKRMFDlTbR5w,"Not awful. But definitely not the best. The flavors are hit or miss. Some are great. Some are best described as very salty honey. The only other complaint I can think of is that there is only one drink machine. The restaurant is in a great location, so it's pretty popular. The last time I was in there, the line for the drinks wrapped around the wall to the doors of the restrooms. It took FOREVER just to fill up my drink. Another machine would be really useful. The customer service is great, the fries are great, everything else is great. Just those two things, and the wing thing specifically is kind of a dealbreaker.",eV6wMkE_VIJDUrRTHOnTVQ,0,0,3,UJjkVAWry5i1LP0MZJS6-A

I used to not be a fan of their french fries as they seemed mediocre BUT dip them in the honey mustard sauce and it brings their stock up 50 pts. This is a great place for lunch or dinner but I do suggest ordering online if you are not going to eat here because they do take a while to cook. That's how you know they are fresh. 

Service is always nice and patient especially when you're boyfriend can't decide what flavors he wants. I don't blame him they all look pretty good but I stick to my Lemon Pepper (my favorite) and Parmesan.",Znid_azpcHmdRMHGicmkWA,7,8,4,NL_4Va-cPtI9ITViCB5KdQ
