2648105,2018-06-17,0,xxaqaD9IVsqxiNF8FoHdYA,"I want to start off by saying this location is normally fantastic. The food is good, it's clean and the staff is on top of it here. My son and I come here a lot. I've never had a bad experience with anyone here until today. 
I just had surgery and decided to use a local food delivery service for the first time today and picked Port of Subs because I feel I can count on them. 
I had my usual order (1 veggie combo and another veggie with a bag of chips, no drink). When the delivery came some of my order was missing (no drink and only 1 bag of chips). The delivery girl apologized and said she'd be back with the rest of my order. She also told me to call Port of Subs and let them know what happened. I called and talked to Jamie (she helps us all the time and recognized me). She apologized and said she'd get it ready. Apparently, there was someone new working on orders. 
While we were waiting, we started eating our sandwiches and they were covered with avocados. Gross! We did not order avocados (did not check ""add avocado"" which is an extra charge). I called Port of Subs again and this time got the new girl. The following interaction is what prompted me to write this review. Instead of apologizing for messing up my order she got an attitude with me. ""So you didn't want avocados then?"" If I wanted avocado I would have ordered avocado. She acted like she was doing me a favor for giving me avocado. Just because I'm ordering a veggie sandwich doesn't mean I want avocado on it. Also, the correct thing to do when you not only forget half of someone's order but also make it wrong is to apologize not get snotty. Clearly, this girl needs more training. 
When the delivery person returned our order was correct and our sandwiches were delicious. Thank you Jamie for making it right and for being so nice and patient with me!",kZPL_fHvZ9P4XA_9C1NdRA,0,0,3,t2Hiv2hY1UPKX06ymsEKdA

2895489,2017-05-04,2,xxaqaD9IVsqxiNF8FoHdYA,"I am so disappointed in this location. Every time I come in I feel like the customer service, quality and selection is lower. I use to come in once a week and now I refuse. I will drive a little farther to get better service. 

*staff* they are too busy having their own side conversations, they can't make a simple sandwich order. I always have to repeat myself several times because they don't simply listen. 

*food quality* lately when I come in the  whole wheat bread is harder than a crouton.  You don't even need to toast your sub because the bread is so stale. Don't get their sourdough! It's always as hard as a rock, and that's if they even have it in stock.  I also use to love a side of macaroni salad with my sandwich but it's always dried out and the noodles are literally hard to the bite.

I've always loved Port of Subs sandwiches so as a company I'm still a fan but this location needs to step it up. Train your staff and keep inventory up. It's disappointing when you are out of meats and breads. That's the minimum of a sandwich shop!",1he_r7kQnK5MXOYqXD-Gkg,3,3,2,asoUFI_rOgZrMxgCmPWVtA
3113056,2018-03-04,0,xxaqaD9IVsqxiNF8FoHdYA,"We ordered the six foot sub party tray containing three different sandwiches, three different breads and the fixings on the side. This was suppose to be our dinner during the super bowl half time. Some started eating when It was noticed there was mold on the bread. We immediately put everything back in the containers. I called Port of Subs but they never picked up(learned the next day that they closed early at 4 pm). We had to put together frozen food for our dinner as we would not eat moldy bread or food that came in contact with the mold. No one would go out to get food because we would miss the second half of the super bowl. I brought the food back the next morning and spoke with the manager, Jaime.  She apologized and told me that the owner does not allow her to give refunds. I was not coming back again so I told her to call the owner. This took quit a while. Finally the owner's wife gave her permission to refund my $54.13. I told her to have the owner call me. Two days later  after not hearing from the owner, I called the corporate office. I was told that  a field consultant would reach out to me. On February 13th the field consultant Gina called and listened to the situation about the mold on the bread. Gina  she would speak with the owner.  First of all, the workers should have noticed the mold on the top of the bread!

My husband had a sandwich there and the white bread was hard as a rock. We have tried on several occasions and their quality is nothing compared to other locations.

I had the #18 on a flatbread with their mayonnaise and mustard sauce; with extra mayo of course. Lettuce, tomato, onions, and a few jalepenos. I thought I'd be in skinny-fat-girl heaven, but not so much. 

It was weird, it was like there was no flavor at all. It almost seemed like the meat they were using was the low-sodium heart healthy junk that taste like nothing, but has meat texture. All I tasted was the doughy flatbread. I ate half of it (but only because i was starving and already committed) and called it a day.

My boyfriend had a chicken sandwich with cheddar, and he too said all he tasted was his doughy bread.

This place is new and super clean, friendly staff, the subs just aren't very good. Next time, I'll be going to Subway-- which isn't incredible, but is leaps and bounds tastier than Port of Subs.",mYNZLYcnZol-oSfU-WP4CQ,1,1,2,R_rtMt0vzZH_v73mUVLXwQ

5446841,2018-05-21,0,xxaqaD9IVsqxiNF8FoHdYA,"Port of Subs at this location has maintained the quality my fiancé and I are used to experiencing.

However, the employees have serious attitude problems that need to be dealt with by a manager or corporate. The girl who made our sandwich had an attitude the entire time she was preparing it. Once she asked us about the condiments we would like on the sandwich, we told her what they would be, her response was, ""Are you serious?"" flabbergasted, for some reason I couldn't tell you about.

Then, we stood and watched her prepare the sandwich (because wtf else do you do?), she got pissed off we were standing there and made us pay before we even got the sandwich. If you don't want people to watch what you do to their food, work somewhere else.

So, she asks us would we like onions, tomatoes, and pickles on the sandwich. Both me and my fiancé agreed, yes. So he told her that. He was loud enough to be heard. But she turns to me and says, ""Did you not hear me or?""

Will not be returning to this location period. No wonder why they have a ""hiring now"" sign taped to the door.",YmiJT51LBYK-yexzbgWHfA,0,0,2,xFK3qE_SG5cU0hCWxqYH2g
