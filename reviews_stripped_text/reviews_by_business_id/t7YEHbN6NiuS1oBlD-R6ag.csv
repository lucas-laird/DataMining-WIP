Jesus our rep was super friendly and way accommodating. Aley our cocktail waitress  is on point she is super cool great personality and attentive. She's a hustler when it comes to getting her clients taken care of It was slammed and she made it happen and kept us full of beverages If I could recruit her for my company I would. We did so much research before coming to Vegas with the kids and we made a great decision by picking Excalibur. Great pricing, friendly and not once did I feel we shouldn't have the kids in Vegas. From the moment we checked in it's been a 5 star experience for us. Pool is clean and if ever you have any doubts they get you taken care of immediately. Good job Excalibur you have trained and hired a great staff. Edit originally have them 5 stars but then me and my husband wanted to go to the adult pool just for 30 minutes or so and its ""paid"" access regardless of checking IDs and just us they said we needed to pay more even tho we had the cabana.",fajP6FhRf4G5etoj_-Y3mA,0,0,4,ZRRYKa9o2NUpxqqBfB4xhg

However it is completely overrun by children and I know it's all they can do in Vegas but you shouldn't go to Vegas if you have to bring your kids with you.  

It may be worth the $10 per person for the adults only pool.  It's a nominal fee they have an abundance of nice padded deck chairs and you get to avoid the rug-rats.

You also get free bottled water in the adults only area.  Peace & quiet on your adult vacation heck is pay more than the $20 I did for me & my wife.",Z29ZHBc9Rf23nxYLIkG_lw,8,1,4,cbo6hpa9vUNdUPszbioFZA
775864,2016-07-22,4,t7YEHbN6NiuS1oBlD-R6ag,"MUST READ!!! This is a late review only because I wanted to see if my complaint and theft report was thoroughly addressed by Excalibur. But since they have failed to follow thru, I will now give my review. Its lengthy, but need to give full details. 

My trip to Vegas (7/6 - 7/9) w/sister, her friend, my niece and 2 of my nephew's friends (their 1st time in Vegas) were there to celebrate my nephew's 21st bday, staying at Excalibur. I wanted to help make his 21st bday experience a memorable one. 

I rented a cabana in the adult pool side. Our waitress was named Ally; the pool area was not packed. They had a nice set up that had a dresser w/drawers for us to put our belongings in. I stored my little purse in the top drawer and had my phone charger and back up portable charger on top of dresser. The morning bday celebration started w/mimosas. My sister ordered breakfast, which one of the breakfast burrito had plastic paper in it and meal was comped. 

We had a great day in the cabana, enjoying the pool and bottle service my sister's friend bought, making great memories. We left @ 3:45 to get ready for nephew's bday dinner. When I got to my room I opened up my purse, only to notice that my 4 $100 bills inside the middle zipper were gone; my $20's were still there. I went downstairs to the spa desk to file a theft report.  I was walked by one of the spa members back to the cabana to see it was already cleaned up, the drawer was empty and my 2 chargers were also gone. Security came, had me write my report and said they would be reviewing the cameras. 

The location of our cabana was in plain view where we could see who was going in and out, which was our waitress. Later, one of the boys mentioned at one point she was seen a little too long in the cabana; our curtain was drawn halfway which we could not see what was going on. 

Later that night my sister's friend came to our room to say his credit card was stolen as well, which he had on the table. Needless to say that really ruined the bday celebration. After dinner I stayed in the room because I was upset and my sister's friend was upset, got sick  and could not sleep. He got up early in the morning and went to the poolside to search the cabana for himself, which they did not want to let him in because the pool was not open, but was persistent. He searched the cabana thoroughly and found a plastic garbage bag shoved behind the dresser in the cabana where he found his credit card and my 4 $100 bills!!! (Who cleans the cabana and shoves a plastic garbage bag behind the dresser?) I went to front desk to speak to the main manager for Excalibur. The manager I spoke with said I needed to speak to Risk Management, I then asked to speak to the spa manager (over telephone) named Caryn. I was nit letting this sit! I told her how the items were recovered, she was in complete shock asking me to repeat how the whole incident happened. She said she was going to look into it herself, which I felt she was going to do. She also had the security come to take the additional complaint. 

When we returned to Ca. I followed up w/Risk Management Department, whom I was referred to playing phone tag, but the message I did receive was she was bot sure why she received this call because she read that the items were returned. In other words who cares how it was taken from my purse, I got my items back. THAT WAS NOT THE POINT! I followed up w/Caryn, spa manager and she had a different tone and was nonchalant about the whole incident. It was a night and day conversation. Bottom line, I got minimal communication and the full runaround. Feeling of true disrespect!!!  

Excalibur does not care about complaints, theft, who they employee and ESPECIALLY about their guests that stay at their hotel every time they vacation in Vegas. I am very sure I would have experienced something entirely different with any other hotel. Making me feel important, heard and compensated by refunding the cabana and bottle service fees for the stress, feeling violated and huge damper it had imposed on what was supposed to be a memorable trip. A true disappointment! Nothing to make it right for their guests, wanting us to come back to their establishment. Not Excalibur, so not the case!!!

So if you want to rent a cabana at Excalibur, make sure that you have all your belongings with you at all times. Watch their staff because you may be next; I can only imagine how many other victims there were? 

I WILL CONTINUE TO SPREAD THE WORD ABOUT EXCALIBUR!

Were at the pool three days. There is no all day shade, I got there and had shade but an hour later I was in the sun, even if you rent an umbrella you will have to move with the shade. :)  The sun moves you won't find shade in the same place all day.   You can rent a cabana, which we did near the slide pool for a discounted price of only $30 and it was nice. Came with tv, couch, table and chairs. Ceiling fan and mini fridge that came stocked with 6 small waters, 3 pepsis and 3 Sprite-type drink. And a bucket of ice.

Water is 3 1/2 feet deep, which is plenty to float on your back or ""walk"" on your knees. My 16 y/o was on the slide ALL DAY.  People where coming and going throughout the day so finding a place to sit never seemed to be a problem.  The largest mushroom shaped pool wasn't open.

The day before we just grabbed lounge chairs and had better service.    You have to pay 10 to use the adult pool which I think is absolutely ridiculous since you have to pay a resort fee at checkin  -wtf?  You have to RENT umbrellas that go next to your chair for shade as well. 40 a day. Give me a friggin break.  Not impressed.  The pool area is nice and has potential to be so much better.

Loved the dj and music.

from Claudia
So disappointed.  They are expensive and because of that I was expecting amazing service while there.  I reserved one and paid for it a month before we got to Vegas, girls trip.  
The whole checking in process to get to your Cabana sucks, it was slow, not organized, not at the pool, you have to go to the spa which you don't know until you go to the pool then you get sent back.  OK, once there, we didn't even wait for a host to walk us to the cabana (we knew how to get to the pool).  The cabana itself was clean, but it was NOT ready with the bucket of waters and gatorades you are supposed to get.  The host came back to ours, took are of the bucket of stuff we were missing.  That was the last we saw anyone come by to our cabana.  2 waitresses for the whole pool, it's freaking hot, I'm sure they were running around like crazy but not for us.  We waived and waited several times.  Finally we see the same host, we tell her we have been waiting to order drinks, she says she can't bring us drinks but takes a not of what we wanted - which at this point - we wanted/needed diet cokes.  I had already gone to the bar myself to get an alcoholic drink (it's hot, it's a cabana at the pool in Vegas, you want to drink, right?).  Still, drinks never came.  Now there is more people in the pool, waited for another 1.5 hrs and we walked to the bar again!  Got our own drinks and diets cokes. By now is lunch time so we wanted to order food, but nothing! no service! 
Around 130 pm I went to the spa and asked for the manager.  I explained my situation and how disappointed I was.  I told him I had done this as a surprise for my girlfriends and paid good money for a ""special treat"",  He explained to me how the whole business model works to ultimately tell me that if there was nothing wrong with the actual cabana then the food and drinks department was responsible.  
Well..... as a customer, although I appreciate the business model, I don't care how it works, or whose fault it is.  FIX IT!  Make it better.  I said I didn't feel like I should pay full price now.  It had been 4 hours of no service.  What's the point of a cabana?  Another manager was sent to our cabana, the food and drinks manager.  Guess what she did to make it better, she told us we would get a CASE OF DIET COKES.... uuhhmm, thanks but what the hell do we do with 24 diets cokes now?  and that felt like a ""just shut up now"".  She did comped our salads! Thank you for that.  Explained to us how the 2 waitress were at fault for not figuring out who was supposed to service our cabana.  OK, thanks again for sharing your internal issues but it doesn't fix our lack of service and bad experience at all.  We left our cabana early as by then we had been getting up and going to the bar ourselves too many times and waited too long for anything to happen.  
Super disappointed and I want my money back!  I will call them when I get home too.",zYwpJGFLFwncmSc8U8TFrQ,6,1,1,K249ksgOCfbAuwDkHY226Q

How can you beat that anywhere. I agree that this isn't the best pool in Vegas and they close the slide in winter. My kids are able to play as long as they want and I can relax and read a book as I watch them. I can tan on the upgraded chairs or sit in the shade. 

You can't beat the price and for twenty five dollars you can't go wrong. Even if you only use it for an hour you got your money out of it. 

It's January and the pool isn't even cold. The hot tub is empty because everyone is in the pool.

2242803,2013-06-25,0,t7YEHbN6NiuS1oBlD-R6ag,"I would rate the pool alone a 4 1/2 or 5 because of the pool and the service. However, I would rate Drenched, the pool's bar, a 2 1/2. 
The pool is a nice pool for the price. I went at the beginning of summer when it was hot and did not have a problem finding a seat. If you want something specific, get there before 11am and you should be fine.  It's a nice place to sit in the morning as the sun is not completely over the hotel at that point, but it does get very warm, which is to be expected. The pool is kept at a great temperature. The pool area looks nice with the palm trees and the rocks. There is also a water slide that I did not use, but it looks nice and it seemed like most of the kids were enjoying it. All of the lifeguards were very helpful. The pool is not a beach like some of the higher-end resorts have, but it is a nice pool and I enjoyed it. 
There was some crazy activity by the pool, such as people jumping in the pool who were probably not thinking right at the time, but the problems were taken care of right away. And for Vegas, they weren't even really making that big of a scene, so I was impressed with the crowd that hung around the pool. 
Wheelchair : If you are in a wheelchair, I would highly recommend this hotel's pool. There was an excellent group of staff members in the spa, as well as great lifeguards, who helped us with the wheelchair lift. It can move to where you want it and it is easy to use. The staff helped us a lot and did not make us feel rushed. It was the first time I used one, but they made it very easy. 
I lowered the rating from what probably would have been a 5 to a 4 because of the bar inside the pool area. It's Vegas so I should have assumed, but they did not have a sign outside saying you had to be 21 to go in, and they serve food and other drinks so I thought it didn't matter. I'm over 21 and the guy practically barked at me to show him my ID, the first time he asked, when I was buying  a non-alcoholic drink. I know they have to legally ask, but there are much nicer ways to ask, as I saw at many other hotels during my stay.

After walking the Strip from here to The Wynn and back, I was ready to cool off and relax.  I had no idea how large the pool area would be or how crowded.  

My naïveté thinking this would be a traditional pool with folks just lounging.  Turned out to be a squatters version of a day club; murky water, drunken college folks (or those revisiting their glory days) and people getting whistled back by the lifeguards for taking their beverages too deep. My resort fee hard at work.  Whatever.   

Smokers and overdone tattoos galore!  Tons of butt floss bikinis and board shorts that have never seen a board.  Not a relaxing poolside hangout at all!  Better to head to your room and turn the shower on.

There are multiple pools and a lot of lounge chairs at the 30,000 square foot Excalibur pool area. 

The most exciting and family friendly of these pools is the Slide Pool which has a cool ""rock"" formation along one side of the pool that includes a very fun water slide as well as waterfalls flowing from the rocks onto the edges of the pool. 

Another pool has a very shallow area which is good for lying out in the sun while in the water or having your non-swimming kids playing in the water.

The pool is easily accessible by anyone (I think, we weren't screened by anyone).. so that doesn't make me feel comfortable leaving stuff to go for a dip.

Every pool is no deeper than 3 and a half feet. This a fact that was told to me by one of the five curmudgeony life guards that perch high above a pool, and seem to be some of the most unapproachable people in Las Vegas.

But back to the point.. 3 and half feet? That barely puts my legs in the water? Even the adults only section? Come on. That's brutal.

On top of it, there is no shade out here.. so burn or be burned in the wallet to rent an umbrella or a cabana.

If I didn't have a pool of my own at home (ie. had gone to Vegas to lounge by the pool) I would have gone to a better pool I know like Luxor, or Monte Carlo.",2qTCiejiaPcHD2vawRrWZg,7,1,2,futRyUDi07kr0ZIqcXY4cg

Food and drinks were good. Ali was our cocktail waitress and she was super cool. Everyone had a great time playing cornhole and taking the $5 Patron Silver shots!

My only cons were cockroaches were in the cabana. Gross. Also saw a dead one in the pool. As far as the adult pool goes it was FILTHY!!! The water was so cloudy you could barely see your feet. There were wads of hair floating around! Gross. It definitely seemed like it hadn't been cleaned very well. The Slide Pool water was much clearer and colder. The slide was fun.

The whole checking in process to get to your Cabana sucks, it was slow, not organized, not at the pool, you have to go to the spa which you don't know until you go to the pool then you get sent back.  OK, once there, we didn't even wait for a host to walk us to the cabana (we knew how to get to the pool).  The cabana itself was clean, but it was NOT ready with the bucket of waters and gatorades you are supposed to get.  The host came back to ours, took are of the bucket of stuff we were missing.  That was the last we saw anyone come by to our cabana.  2 waitresses for the whole pool, it's freaking hot, I'm sure they were running around like crazy but not for us.  We waived and waited several times.  Finally we see the same host, we tell her we have been waiting to order drinks, she says she can't bring us drinks but takes a not of what we wanted - which at this point - we wanted/needed diet cokes.  I had already gone to the bar myself to get an alcoholic drink (it's hot, it's a cabana at the pool in Vegas, you want to drink, right?).  Still, drinks never came.  Now there is more people in the pool, waited for another 1.5 hrs and we walked to the bar again!  Got our own drinks and diets cokes. By now is lunch time so we wanted to order food, but nothing! no service! 
Around 130 pm I went to the spa and asked for the manager.  I explained my situation and how disappointed I was.  I told him I had done this as a surprise for my girlfriends and paid good money for a ""special treat"",  He explained to me how the whole business model works to ultimately tell me that if there was nothing wrong with the actual cabana then the food and drinks department was responsible.  
Well..... as a customer, although I appreciate the business model, I don't care how it works, or whose fault it is.  FIX IT!  Make it better.  I said I didn't feel like I should pay full price now.  It had been 4 hours of no service.  What's the point of a cabana?  Another manager was sent to our cabana, the food and drinks manager.  Guess what she did to make it better, she told us we would get a CASE OF DIET COKES.... uuhhmm, thanks but what the hell do we do with 24 diets cokes now?  and that felt like a ""just shut up now"".  She did comped our salads! Thank you for that.  Explained to us how the 2 waitress were at fault for not figuring out who was supposed to service our cabana.  OK, thanks again for sharing your internal issues but it doesn't fix our lack of service and bad experience at all.  We left our cabana early as by then we had been getting up and going to the bar ourselves too many times and waited too long for anything to happen.

Anyhow, they have a small water slide that anyone can go on. It's small, short, and doesn't go too fast. They have cabanas that are decently priced, about $120 for the day. The pools are only 3.5 feet deep witha  10 inch section for the little ones. There are three pools, one of them being 18 and up only. 
All in all a nice pool, but more family oriented. Nice place to relax, but if you're looking for a pool where there are people drinking and partying, this isn't it.",5YZ_GAtYVU6NXv7QiwNlwA,0,2,3,GgtSrEHRIkM3Bk9PaDguZw

The spa pool was cloudy with hair and bandaids floating around. It's so gross. The need to vacuum these pools more often. There's a lot of shade by the main pool in the morning, but the main pool doesn't open until 11a??? I think the rest of the pools open at 9a. I'm not sure the reasoning for this.

Get to any of the ""Resort"" pools early enough, grab your chairs and you are fine. If your looking for something specific in terms of shade, a particular spot etc. GET THERE EARLY!! 

Unless you want to go the extra mile and spend a few more bucks to guarentee a spot. Get a cabana by the pool of your choice and enjoy the day. To me it is well worth it.

We travel with teenage twins, one boy one girl and are always pleased with our experience. Yes we might be even more pleased when they are 21 and can enjoy everything together but for now, in my opinion there is no better place then Excalibur.

First of all, it's really tough to find a seat with any shade. When we did find one under an umbrella it was shocking to see a sign saying you had to RENT a chair with shade for 50 bucks! Are you kidding me? I understand the whole renting an exclusive cabana concept but this was just a lounge chair with an umbrella! 

I guess it's the Vegas mentality and they are trying to take you for all you're worth. We also asked for a cup of water and were told they could only bring us a bottle, $7 for a small $9 for a large. It should be illegal to not provide water when it's 100 plus degrees.

(Aug 11,12,13) I WAS a bit disappointed because we chose to stay here for the economical room and then a shaded cabana for the day time use as we spend entire days at the pool and then eat on site and gamble on site. We book for multiple cabana days and hope for a great deal. Never once on a non holiday weekend have I ever seen the cabanas even half full so when I asked this time, I felt okay asking. I was offered  a very slight decrease and could not believe the lack of flexibility they were willing based on the occupancy.  
So my husband and I booked one day cabana rental at MGM which was higher but at least offered more with the rental. This was our first experience offsite of Excalibur. After the one day, my mind was set that we would change our future plans to stay there with the options of more pools were available. Since we were booked here already, we went out to the pool and sat in one of the chairs and knew I'd only last an hour.  Mind you, this was MY REASON for choosing the Excalibur and Las Vegas--the adult pool and the cabanas.  The rooms are okay, but the adult pool being quite relaxing and a wonderful place to meet other vacationers. Andres came up and asked if there was anything he could do for us (and he continued to do so for the rest of our trip) and I gave it one more shot.  I told him what I'd like to get and he made it happen.  He literally changed what was becoming an extremely sad trip for me into the reason I drove 10 hours for.  I look forward to this each year. This is our 6th stay here and I had just about lost hope.  We did rent a cabana for 3 days and we ate, drank and had the restful trip I so love.  I know you have so many people using the pool but the cabana price doesn't match your customer base. It makes no sense to me that you aren't willing to fill the chairs and cabanas by making them more affordable to your customers. 2-3 out of the 9 cabanas were occupied in the adult area and truthfully they aren't worth the $220-$520 M-Th pricing tiers. The pool property really does need more cleaning attention by your hospitality service because I literally go in and clean myself. The floors are dirty and the lounging chair pads need to be cleaned or over-hauled with new.  There were holes in two of the chairs in our cabana area.  I really can't see spending $500 for a cabana with dirty floors, trash inside the refrigerator cabinet, and dingy lounge pads.  I'm not particularly finicky but this hasn't changed since the first time I rented one several years ago AND every year I comment or suggest things that might make me feel that the cabanas are worth what you are requesting.  Actually, the best part of my experience by the pools are your awesome cabana, life guard and massage employees. They are fun, hard workers, kind, personal and I enjoy tipping them. The names I remember are Andres, Jessie, Evan, Austin, Mason but I'll always remember their smiles and helpfulness.
