I ordered a bellini and my husband ordered a vodka redbull (with house vodka - which was skyy). 17 dollars for his drink!!!!!!! RIDICULOUS!!!!! We got seated and it took our waitress about 20 min to acknowledge us. She took our drink order and it took about another 15 min to get the drinks (which funny enough, were lower in price than at their bar). We ordered the shrimp cocktail as an appetizer, which was the only positive experience dinning at this restaurant. The shrimp were huge and yummy! I ordered the surf and turf open faced sandwich and my husband ordered the scallops. For over a $300 dinner, I would think that the lobster wouldn't be brittle-dry. It was disgusting! The steak that accompanied my entree was cooked correctly but luke warm. My husband's scallops were gritty and extremely salty. Added to the crappy meal, the ceiling was broken so the only thing that ""switched"" were the walls. Our waitress had a huge section therefore taking forever to get anything we ordered or needed. I have no problem paying a lot of money for a great dinner, but when it sucks...it's disappointing - especially in Vegas.

370065,2009-09-07,0,EbP8eduNl-aEy2UVfs3zJA,"So the most expensive restaurant to build in America is definitely worth checking out. I went there with a couple friends of mine for a nice dinner in Vegas and Switch did not disappoint. Our waiter was awesome and told us all about the restaurant and the food. He was very knowledgeable and the recommendations he made were spot on. Also, it should be noted that the executive chef of Switch used to be the executive chef of the County Club Grill. If you have been to that place and liked their food, then you should definitely check out Switch.

For starters, I had the Lobster Bisque. The Bisque was not as creamy as I would have liked but the Bisque was very flavorful and had a lot of lobster chunks. However, I will say it was not the best I have ever had. A friend of mine got the corn chowder and I will say that the was best corn chowder I have had. It also had lots of crab in it, which was delicious. 

For the main course, I had the scallops on a bed of ratatouille with a sweet pea sauce. The three scallops that come are HUGE and the best I have ever had. They were very tender, could be cut like they were butter, and just melted in my mouth. The ratatouille was also delicious and if you like peas, you would like the sauce bordering the plate.

One of my friends had the Ahi Tuna steak cooked rare and it was also delicious. I usually have my Ahi Tuna seared but the chef cooked the Ahi Tuna perfectly. Another friend of mine had the veal chop and that was also cooked perfectly. It was charred on the outside and medium rare and pink on the inside. It was tender and also melted in my mouth.

Unfortunately, we were full and did not have any dessert but I did have a cappuccino that was done well. We sat and had dinner for two hours and enjoyed watching the restaurants walls and ceiling change every 20 minutes. The experience of watching the restaurant switch was definitely worth it and the best part about it was that our waiter let us take as long as we wanted. We did not feel rushed in any way, which is the best way to dine in my opinion. 

 I would definitely go back to Switch.",N7Nn41BA9wRubQZu790DgQ,0,0,5,WuNA4AtqZvqTm-cZsDe7sg

Not only was the bone-in rib chop which they recommended mediocre, but the hotel's response to this fiasco was unbelievabe.  I was shocked that they not only didn't comp my meal or room, but told me that because I didn't want to go see a doctor in Las Vegas, spending my weekend at the ER, that I could have gotten the flu as well and so they were not responsible.  I am sure that this is the case, considering I was fine until I went to dinner and both my girlfriend and I threw up after the meal and were both sick all weekend.

425944,2009-02-05,1,EbP8eduNl-aEy2UVfs3zJA,"Horrible. There is simply no other way than to describe this NEW, restaurant located inside Encore, the latest addition to the Wynn family of resorts in Las Vegas. I would say that this experience rivaled my equally repulsive time at Gordon Ramsay in the London Hotel in Los Angeles

Let us delve deeper. Firstly, I had a reservation for Switch at 7pm. I showed up on the dial and was told that my seat would not be available right away. What the hell is the point of a reservation if they don't respect and live up to it?

Already becoming annoyed, I was quickly set aflame when my table became ready and was told that I would not be able to enter the restaurant because of my attire. I was wearing slacks and a monogrammed polo shirt. Apparently, the dress code is for buttoned, collared shirts and jackets are recommended. As I perused the restaurant behind the tyrant of a hostess, I saw that MANY people were wearing far worse than myself.

I quickly and smugly showed the hostess that her ""rules"" were out of line and that apparently someone let others in with t-shirts and jeans. For god sake, there was a man in a Hawaiian shirt! After realizing that the hostess would not hear any more, I went back to my room to change. It also gave me time to cool down!

After being seated, I took in the decor of the restaurant. Switch, changes its surroundings every half hour, with walls rising up and down, some from side to side and even the ceiling gets in on the act! This dance reveals new and different motifs, all of which are rather bland and boring.

Our waiter for the evening seemed more accustomed to McDonald's than a fancy restaurant. For he showed up exactly 3 times the entire evening. First to take our order, then to drop off the food and lastly, the check. My guest and I ordered wine straight away and it came in no less than 30 minutes! Our food, risotto and scallops came after 1 hour and 15 minutes of waiting! What in the hell takes so long for these two dishes? There is simply no excuse for this. To add insult to injury, the food was just average!

I managed to flag down a female manager and told her of my experience at the beginning of this adventure. In true ""circle the wagons"" fashion, she defended the hostess and said that she was right in stopping me from entering. I again showed how others were wearing t-shirts and the manager looked at me blankly and said the ""rules (were) the rules"". Who hires these people?

I do not and will never recommend Switch to anyone. It is a horrible place with food that can be better prepared from a campfire by children. The entire experience was shocking and utterly disappointing to say the least. Steve Wynn needs to implode the restaurant and start anew.

The service is efficient.  Portions are decent sized.  We enjoyed the shrimp cocktail (3 cold, firm shrimp).

We booked our reservation online, but it didn't matter anyways since they lost it.  They were able to seat us within 5 minutes since it wasn't packed.  The hostesses were nice, but the servers not so much.  Anyways, we ordered our food and was totally disappointed.  First mistake was they brought my sister the wrong salad.  We aren't too picky so we didn't throw a fit over that, salad is a salad.  Then our 9 oz. filets come and looked so delicious.  We ordered both our steaks medium well and were expecting that.  Instead we got one well done and the other medium.  I guess put together equals medium well?  So we complained to our server after it took a good ten minutes to find him and get his attention to come to the table.  He just looks at the both steaks and says ""yeah, thats supposed to be medium well, but this one is well and this one is medium"" and he just walks away.  No duh jackass!!!  So a few minutes pass and he comes back and asks if we want dessert.  We asked did if he had told his manager and if he was going to come over.  His reply is yeah he did and he's off doing something.  Manager never came to speak to us about how disappointed we are with the meal.  He came by the table to give us a mediocre complimentary dessert and didn't even say a word to us.  This place is horrible.  I've had better steaks at cheaper places and with better service.

So I'm going to try and catch up a little and review a few restaurants I've been to in the last 3 months starting with Switch at the Wynn/Encore Hotel in Vegas.  I was here last month and had the chance to eat at this lovely 5 star restaurant.  The scenery was quite beautiful, how the room switched to different scenes every 20 minutes.  It was pretty cool to see the walls come down, the lighting changed and the decor changed to different French sceneries.  

The service was definitely outstanding, it is a 5 star restaurant, so I wouldn't expect any less.  I had the Butter fish and lobster and we also ordered caviar.  I have to say the Caviar was AMAZING.  It was so delicious, I could've eaten it all night.  Everything else after that was good, but did not equal to the Caviar.  The wine was good, I supposed for $500/bottle it should taste good.  The desert was good, we have the powdered donuts w/dipping.  

Overall the experience was outstanding.  Personally I wouldn't pay that much for food, but it was a business dinner... I would say I have had as good of a dinner, except for the caviar, else where for less money.  Even the ""switcheroo"" atmosphere wasn't worth the money, but nice to see and experience.

The crispy oyster mushrooms were amazing, and a surprisingly large portion. The vegan Caesar salad was nothing special, certainly not next to the mushrooms. The bananas foster was one of the most flavorful desserts I've had in a while too. Of course, the place itself is gorgeous [as is most of the Encore].

I had the taste of Wynn menu-Caeser salad, Lobster and scallop vol au vent, and Creme brule. The desert was good, but not memorable. The only thing unique about the salad was the crunchy parmesan cracker (for want of a better word) that came with it. Even on special, for the price we were paying, the lettuce should have been fresh without brown edges. I'll say the single scallop on top of the main dish was pretty darn good, but the little tart it sat on was almost inedible. Inside was a brown goo with some small bits of real lobster, but no lobster flavor whatsoever.
My husband let me try a bite of his steak and potatoes au gratin. The potatoes were too heavy for even a big eater like him to finish half. And the steak itself was overcooked. The wine glaze was good-maybe a little too sweet, though.

I also was unimpressed with the ""switch"" of the room. I think they could have gone all out with the walls. While it is quite neat that the walls do switch, I found the overall decoration of them unexciting.

Gee another steakhouse - i just don't get it - is this really what the ""powers-to-be"" feel is what's needed on the Strip - really ? oh that's right, let's add the gimmick of switching up the walls/ceiling every 20 minutes or so ( yeah, one of them was kinda cool - but the option that opens up to the casino and basically the front entrance - i can't believe Mr., Wynn bought into that option ) 

I'm still laughing about the server making a big deal about the filet being wet aged for 55 days, "" no one else ages it that long ! "" - come on, 40 days, 50 days, can someone really tell the diff. Does a fillet need much aging anyways ?!?! I the hosts went with the fillet - 10 ouncer cost about $55, i went with the 18 ounce bone-in rib eye ( almost went with the hanger steak ) - i think mine cost about $58. 

went with the asparagus, mushrooms and cheesy potatoes ( goes by some fancy french name that escapes ) for sides - about $14 each ( that's even high for the strip steakhouses ! thank god i wasn't flipping the bill ) 
The jamon serrano salad was my starter - i think it was $16 - that was decent - nice chunks of Roquefort cheese, the dressing was a little too oily. 

we opted not to have dessert - the choices were kinda boring - creme brulee, molten chocolate cake, bananas foster, etc 

started with some sort of lychee cocktail and we had wine - nothing remarkable.

The special thing about switch is how the restaurant setting changes every half hour between 3 different themes.  I guess that was kind of cool.  The thing we didn't like was how close it was to the casino floor, so one of the themes didn't have anything blocking the restaurant from the casino slot machines so you can see everything in the casino from your table, wasn't private at all.

The food, I'd give 4 stars.  As someone below noted, the menu online isn't the same as the one in the restaurant.  We had the kobe beef and carpaccio for appetizers.  Both were amazing, especially the kobe beef.  For side dishes we had asparagus and creamed spinach - good but nothing special.  I also had the bone in rib eye - which was good, but didn't seem like a $50 steak.  They also got it wrong too - i had ordered medium rare, and it came out well done.  Actually 3 of our steaks came out overcooked, but mine was the worst.  I let the waiter know, and he was really cool about it and said he'd bring me a new one out right away.  Both him and the manager had apologized.  It was over 15 minutes and both him and the manager came by to let me know it was coming out, but the waiter was really honest and let me know why it took longer - because the chef had thought they said something else and cooked something else on accident.  But the waiter was definitely really nice throughout all of this.  I finally got my ribeye and it was just right this time. 

He also brought us 2 free desserts because of the steak situation.  Chocolate peanut butter lava cake and bananas foster.  Both were sooooo good.  Probably the best part of the night.

Yes, I agree with some of the earlier reviews that the food wasn't the best out there.  But it was still good, and you have to remember that it's been open two months!

Appetizer: Crab cake- Scrumptious crab cake topped with carrots and fried to perfection. 

Salad- We had regular, basic field greens with a basic balsamic vinaigrette. It is perfect to balance out the crab cake (because it is fried- duh.)

Meal: Red Snapper- this was what took me into the sweet stairwell to heaven. Every bite was filled with a bang and each bite just brought more surprise as I ate throughout the dinner course. It is grilled then laid on top of a bed of tomatoes and onions. The sauce is tangy and zesty. PERFECT for a prized fish. Oh how I love thee, my red snapper friend. 

Sides: Yukon mashed potatoes- Golden, creamy, and whipped to perfection. Just how I love my mashed taterz. 

Creamed spinach- There was a sweet taste to it that made my palate jump to surprise. But it still was delicious. Creamy and sweet, what a weird mixture for spinach- but it worked. 

Dessert: Bananas foster- I was disappointed when it wasn't lit, but it tasted just as if I were in New Orleans. I could still taste the rum off of the bananas and it was pure bliss.

Dining at Switch is an interesting experience and worth the novelty, but the entire concept of the restaurant switching it's designs and lighting every 20 or so many minutes is actually distracting and annoying after a while, because the dramatic music they play during the switch can drown out your dinner conversation.  I'm not exactly a fan, but it's interesting at the least.

More importantly, the food had its high and low points.  In order of consumption: bread, good; guava mojito, probably the highest note of the entire meal...really good; butternut squash soup, good but standard; caesar salad, also good but standard; grilled octopus, plentiful but a little underwhelming; bone-in-ribeye, far outstripped my expectations by a whole lot and served alongside some curiously deliciously out of my mind unfathomable garlic heads that were so good we ate all of them; monkfish, also really good if a tiny bit salty...tasted like lobster; standard mac n cheese; the most god awful cauliflower mush I've ever tried to shove down my throat, which really surprised me after the hearty endorsement our waiter gave it; and finally for dessert a chocolate cake I can't even remember because it was so mediocre.

The most important parts of this meal, the two entrees, were both very good and beyond my expectations, but the rest of the meal was sort of lackluster (barring the delicious mojito).  The entrees make me want to give Switch 4 stars, but the remembrance of that unacceptably disgusting cauliflower side and the sheer annoyance of the restaurant itself prevent me from doing so.",zmARcxsPqv2WrQ4RhO_zww,1,0,3,i8msJpHAD2ZsNMJU4kgk0g

It is obvious that there was alot of money invested for the technology.  The walls shift, the ceilings cave in and form new creations, and the music changes all at once.  It is pretty incredible!
As for the food and service, it was okay.  Service was a little frazzled and disorganized at first and it was hard to tell who was our server.  The sommelier was difficult to locate...like 20 minutes maybe?  and when he did come he was unhelpful and kind of condescending that I would actually consider and desire an Argentine wine.  Still stuck-up with the French or bust attitude.  But, I'm the customer, so please at least don't pull that on me when I'm just asking for a suggestion on New World wines!  That's my taste.  grrr...

However, I did enjoy my experience here.  My gf took me here for my birthday dinner over valentine's day weekend, I had the bone-in ribeye (my usual selection of steak at restaurants, I might add), and she had a fish filet of some sort.

I had the lobster bisque soup and my gf had the caesar salad.  From trying both, I liked the lobster bisque more than the salad.

My bone-in ribeye was super delicious, it tasted at or around the same way the cowboy (bone-in) ribeyes at ruth's chris steakhouse tasted.  My gf's fish filet was cooked over some mushrooms that tasted even more delicious.  Plus my gf and I could not stop raving over the mashed potatoes.  We both agreed that the mash potatoes probably had more than twice the daily serving of butter in it in order to taste that good.

And the sweet potato fries were extremely tasty, but after eating the entire ribeye, I could not finish the fries.  I'd suggest ordering only one sweet potato fries for at least two people because it's a huge serving.

Anyway, I'm not giving it five stars because of the service.  We made reservations a week prior via open table, which were taken care of seamlessly, but our waiter was very stern and not very social at all.

We ordered the Seafood Tower, and it was just amazing. Granted, it was expensive for what it was, but I have to say that we didn't regret it. We also ordered the Truffle Risotto - I have to say, every bite was equally delicious, and my taste buds didn't get bored with the explosion of flavors. So butter and truffle risotto, along with shaved truffles on top - a symphony in my mouth. Want more.

O. M. G.  

Service was perfect - they only came around a few times, and only did something when needed. Because our original plans for dinner fell through, we decided to go here around 9:30 pm on Monday night. When we arrived, there were plenty of tables to dine at. We didn't have to worry about reservations.

Oh - the deal with this place is that the ceiling and walls shift every half hour. Cool trick, and a neat to see. We felt that it didn't distract the conversation. 

Overall, when we're in vegas again, we're definitely returning to this restuarant.

One more thing - The management really appreciates when people arrive with dressy attire. We were helped by I believe one of the managers for more than 20 minutes before the actual waiter came around.

Our server, Will was one of the main contributing factors to this as well as the amazing food and a restaurant ambiance that hasn't seen it's equal. 

Will was very patient with us as we looked over the menu. The level of quality service that he provided was astounding. He offered thorough explanations as well as suggestions on what we should try. We ended up ordering the lobster mac and cheese, green tea spiced ahi, and Montana bison. Yes, bison.

-Vermont cheddar mac and cheese with Maine lobster: $18
A very perfect portion of the best mac and cheese this stomach has ever digested. We both don't like mac and cheese but loved this one. The lobster portions in here were nicely cut and prepared. 

-Green tea spiced ahi tuna: $42
This was served with lentils and endive. It was a HUGE cut of ahi. Very fresh and seared to perfection. The green tea added a nice dimension of flavor here. I've had a lot of seared ahi in my day but none like this. Amazing.

-Montana bison rib eye : $48
This was served with a very nice port wine sauce. It was cooked medium well and it remained juicy throughout. The bison was very lean and tasted very clean. It had no gamey taste at all. Very impressive.

-Caramelized profiteroles : $12
Think of these as very small cream puffs. I had never heard of this dessert before dining at Switch. The puffs were full of flavor and very light. It was the perfect way to end the meal. We didn't want to get bogged down at all: we had shopping to do.

So why call this place Switch? Well every 20 minutes the restaurant itself transforms. Wall panels give way to one of three different types and even the ceiling opens up and recesses to give a different point of decor for the discerning customer. This was a very nice touch and although I knew it was going to happen ahead of time thanks to Yelp reviews, they can't really prepare you for the real deal. I had never seen anything like it before in my life.

1853424,2009-01-09,4,EbP8eduNl-aEy2UVfs3zJA,"Two MAJOR slipups in the planning of Switch: location and table spacing.  

I don't like to dine looking at a casino or within earshot of my neighbors.  Luckily we had an early dinner and they staggered the parties.  Later in the evening we were joined by a lovely blue-haired couple from Montecito, charming, but we were secretly happy they crashed our party at the end of our meal.  

Otherwise, the restaurant is gorgeous and the three different backdrops of the evening were OOOOH and AHHHH worthy.  Seriously it was like dinner and a show rolled into one.  Remember to look UP too.

Normally they just have an ala carte menu, but NYE, there was a special tasting for $150/pp.  Well worth it for the quality and presentation.

No amuse, 4 courses, sorbet, dessert & no mignardises:
C1: Lobster bisque w/a lobster claw on the side
Excellent, huge chunks of sweet succulant meat in the soup, robust flavor.
C2: Butternut squash ravioli
Quite enjoyable and not too sweet, it's usually not my favorite.
C3: Pastry wrapped scallops w/slivers of truffle
Bold and adventurous presentation, good.
C4: Foie topped Filet
This baby was HUGE, but also quite good.
Desserts: Cannot recollect too much, both were very good, but check out the visuals I posted, I liked the fruit one more, but the chocolate one was rich, moist and the crispy rice texture was delicious. 

We were happy and surprised to find our sommelier from Restaurant Charlie had relocated to Switch.  His pairings were spot on and much more reasonable in price. We did not mention a price cap, but it was only an additional $75/pp for the vino.  

Switch is supposed to be the premier restaurant at the Encore, but I was expecting a bit more luxury and elegance.  Maybe he didn't want another over indulgent restaurant to compete with Alex?",53bZ_EsXH71L7iFs5MP9_w,4,5,4,96yXfDIp1gjECX1OPe1mHg

However, maybe it was just what I ordered...I ordered a vegan dish.  I am not vegan, but I was just not in the mood for steak.  The rest of the party ordered steak and one of them raved it was the best steak they had ever had while the other 2 simply said it was good/decent.

Also, I think I hyped the wall changes up a bit too much in my head.  They weren't all that impressive.  It was kind of like a ride a Disney that is ready to be retired.

2002187,2011-05-31,0,EbP8eduNl-aEy2UVfs3zJA,"The Wynn has numerous restaurant choices and I decided to roll the dice on Switch Steakhouse. I had no idea that the scenery changed every 20 minutes. It was a clever trick that screams Vegas, baby! In an upscale, sophisticated way, I suppose. The walls rise up or are taken down, the ceiling flips closed or turns inward and opens. The music blares and the lights dim or brighten while the action is in progress. It's a fun little show. 

The food is overpriced, but what do you expect in the Wynn? I've read other reviews that speculated Switch has a 10-20% premium and I'd tend to agree. That said, I was lucky on this particular night and was seated quickly considering I arrived with no reservation. The wait staff was courteous and helpful. 

I decided to try the Bison Steak for my entree. I asked for medium rare and they delivered, slightly bloody as expected. The meat was lean and juicy. Not as juicy as a normal steak, but bison is different from beef and I expected as much. The fat content is far lower than normal beef. They also had a port glaze sauce which I enjoyed. As a side I ordered the potato gratin. The top was crispy, herbed and appropriately salted. The potato underneath was creamy and cooked just enough. The combination was delicious and satisfying. 

That day they had a Seafood Soup special that was comprised of a tomato based broth, shrimp, salmon and a few mussels. The broth was tasty and the seafood fresh. It had a nice balance and there was a surprising amount of salmon in the soup. 

I paired this with a nice bottle of Cakebread Chardonnay. 

All in all, it was a clever, fun environment with the ""switches"", the view of the pool area and the overall ambiance. I can't complain about the food because it was a nice meal, but somehow I was expecting more. The dishes didn't have the pop, pizazz or unexpected flavors or contrasts I'd expect from such a high end location. That said, it's a steak house. Not a gourmet fusion french/asian wonderland, so I should keep my expectations in check. However, what's the point of a review without a few nits to pick.

They were able to accommodate 35 guests on two hours notice in the main dining room, and even allowed us to order from the full menu- unheard of in most cases when it comes to group reservations. 

The service: We brought some of our top clients to dinner at Switch, and on such short notice they either couldn't, or wouldn't, change into a sports coat and dress shoes. While I understand flip flops are probably out of the norm, I think they could have bit a bit gentler about insisting our VIPs wear jackets. They wouldn't even let them enter the restaurant entrance until they had the proper attire on. 

Once we were seated, a bit of organization would have been great too. The servers seems a bit confused as to who was taking orders on which side of the table, where to start and stop, etc. 

Food: Service aside, the meal itself was great. We had more than enough food including gigantic seafood platters, amazing steaks, and enough sides to feed an army.

I am huge fan of bone-in rib eyes and this one is definitely one of the better ones that I have had. Switch definitely allows the steak to shine with only a touch of salt and pepper and then grilled and charred with just the right temperature. They also give you a side of roasted garlic that goes with the steak that is just great (if you are a garlic fan). 

The sides - mac and cheese, creamed spinach, black truffle risotto, caesar salad or the chopped salad. All of the sides are great and definitely enough to share.

The patio was pretty and the view of the nightclub and the pool at night was beautiful. We thought it was going to be cold but it wasn't cold at all. 

Our first waiter was really rude and condescending, I was simply trying to order for 3 people including myself because we all wanted the same entree. But, for some reason he got confused or pretended to be confused to make me feel stupid because there was nothing complicated about it.

We started off with the oysters on the half shell which were very good (fresh and clean) and the wedge salad which was pretty good but not great.  When it comes to a wedge salad I prefer more bacon and blue cheese but I thought the dressing could have been more creamy and there definitley wasn't enough bacon for my taste.  For my entree I ordered the 9oz filet cooked medium rare and it was just perfect.  I loved that the meat was encrusted with a rock salt on top, which gave it a great flavor. I'm deducting one star here because my husband ordered the bone in strip which he also asked to be cooked medium-rare, but I thought it was more on the medium side.  In my opinion, a great steakhouse should get the meat right every time.  For sides we had the potatoes gratain which were ok, the mac and cheese which was really good.  I liked that they used the very tiny noodles which really allowed the cheese flavor to come through.  We also had the creamed spinach which was very good, the sauteed mushrooms also very good, and the truffle risotto which everyone really enjoyed but I'm not a huge risotto fan.  The side of broccoli was the only one that I didn't care for, it was a little too sweet for my taste.  We didn't try dessert since everyone was too full but I would defintiley come back here.",r3efcEywbG9WPorAtNx2Ug,1,0,4,lq0BGHdUecQRJcd__-mtXg

I probably made a sad face and then decided not to have anything.

Everything was top notch from the service to the food and atmosphere. Maybe that's because Steve Wynn (the owner) was in the restaurant while we were having dinner, but I don't think that was it.

The steaks are the highest quality meat and we tried a 9 oz. filet and a bone-in filet. Both we're melt in your mouth delicious. The waiter said the top two sides in his opinion were the spinach with truffle oil and the mac and cheese with Vermont White Cheddar. They did not disappoint.

Oh, and they served a roasted garlic clove with the steak. The trick here is to eat each bite of steak with a bit of the roasted garlic. Oh my!

Wine prices are sadly the normal way too high restaurant markup, but we had a lovely bottle of Golden Eye Pinot Noir.

The tables are a little too close together for my tastes, as it almost seemed like we were having a double date with the couple beside us.

I ordered a tuna carpaccio and the veal chop, with a side of grilled asparagus, while my wife ordered the mixed greens with a filet steak and a side of potatoes au-gratin. The sides were plentiful enough that one order of each was more than enough for the two of us.

The food was very good, with especially high marks for the gratin of potatoes. My veal was flavourful and extremely tender, and the puree of parsnip was a really nice additional flavour.

I did have to use one of the pre-determined menus due to the size of my party.  The food was excellent and they were accomodating about letting me make substitutions to the menu (although I will share that I thought their wine list was ridiculously overpriced.)

The food was perfectly cooked, the service was excellent and the lobster mac & cheese was like a hug from Jesus!

The ambiance was fantastic and they were playing great music when I was there.  I didn't realize it before I arrived, but the reason it got its name is because the walls and ceiling ""switch"" every 15-20 minutes.  It's really cool.

Do not get suckered into trying this wanna be ""steakhouse"". The premise seems cool @ first, every 20 minutes or so the decor of the restaurant changes, but after a couple ""switches"" it gets old. 

So, onto the meal. To be honest, the meal I had was not bad at all. I kept it simple since I wasn't super hungry. Started off with the lobster bisque, which was actually excellent. Rich creamy bisque and an ample amount of lobster. Was off to a great start. 

For my meal, I had the kobe beef carpaccio w/arugula salad and mac & cheese. Both were good, but I wasn't blown away by either.  

My real ""beef"" with this joint is two fold. The first problem is, we went here being enticed by the ""Taste of Wynn"" menu they had offered. An app, entree and dessert for $69. On the website, they offered a 9oz filet. However, once you got in the door, the filet was not an option. Instead the substituted a ""sliced"" NY Strip. When we asked the waiter, they said they stopped offering the filet because they were losing money. Really? You're losing money because you're offering an $8 cut of meat for $60? Hmmmm.....

Here's a tip you pretentious used douchewater recepticle. You're not losing money because you're offering filet at a ""discounted"" price. You can't get people in the door because the food is average, overpriced (albeit expected since it is Vegas), but the service is absolutely horrible. We barely saw our server besides him taking our order and presenting our check. And for what we paid I expected a little more. Maybe if the waitstaff didn't act like they were doing you a favor by bringing you the meal you are paying an arm and a leg for you'd be able to get people in the door.  I must not be the only one with this opinion either since the restaurant wasn't even 1/4 full on a Friday night.

3725517,2009-04-12,1,EbP8eduNl-aEy2UVfs3zJA,"I went to Switch with 5 other friends.  None of us had tried this place, but hey what the heck?  The restaurant looked pretty inviting, and it was pretty packed with people.

Before I comment on the food, I must say that I really do like the ambiance here.  The place is called Switch because there are 3 different ""environments"" that is being switched every 30 minutes.  They are kind of fun; however, I much rather would have preferred to switch every hour.  We were in the restaurant for 3 hours... so that means we saw the walls and windows switch 6 times.  The wow factor was pretty much gone after the first few times.

As for the food, our group got a ""Seafood Extravaganza for Four"" to split ($150).  The appetizer included the following:  oysters on the half shell, jumbo shrimp, ahi tuna tartar, Maine lobster, bay scallop ceviche, and Alaskan king crab legs.  

I personally loved the bay scallop ceviche.  The oysters on a half shell, jumbo shrimp, Maine lobster, and Alaskan king crab legs were all good and fresh.  I didn't like the ahi tuna tartar.  The tuna wasn't fresh.

I ordered the Bone-in Rib Eye with the bordelaise sauce ($52).  The sauce was a recommendation from our waiter.  I ordered my rib eye medium rare, and it was perfect.  Usually restaurants cook the steaks too done for me.  The only complaint I had about this dish was that it was a bit too salty.  The meat itself and the medium rare cooking were both perfect.

Some of the other dishes that my friends ordered were the following:
- Sauteed Sonoma Foie Gras (appetizer) - I took a bite to taste and it was delicious.  The sauce on the dish was really tasty.
- Filet - also the same comment as I had about being a bit too salty.  This friend ordered his Filet also ""medium rare"".
- Slow Simmered Short Rib of Beef - he liked his dish; however, the portion was a bit small.
- Roasted Lamb Chop - she liked it; however, said the dish didn't have enough salt.

The seasonal wild mushrooms on the side was delicious.  I ordered a Lobster Mac & Cheese just to try.  (I love Mac & Cheese... even though it doesn't exactly pair with my entree).  Anyway, the lobster flavor and cheese was really light.  I felt like it needed a small kick in the Mac & Cheese.

My friends had ordered their mojitos as a cocktail.  The flavors are pretty good, but it doesn't really have alcohol in it.

All in all, it was a pretty fun experience.  The food was good.  I wished my Rib Eye wasn't as salty as it was.  The seafood extravaganza had really fresh seafood (except for the tuna tartar).  I liked the atmosphere a lot, but also wished the walls didn't change every 30 minutes, maybe every hour or so.  I don't know if I would come back again for the price (my share was $130 with tip).  It's worth a trip to go to this restaurant once for the experience.

The restaurant is beautiful, but only from certain tables....other tables look directly into the casino.  Before dining, I didn't think that was a big deal...but there is something about paying $60 for a steak and looking up and seeing not beautiful interiors, but rather the annoying progressive-slot lights, and the silly music that goes along with those slots.  Often, people dine at nice restaurants to get away from that, and at Switch there is no escape. 

The menu changes...so if you went to encorelasvegas.com and looked up the menu and fell in love with some items, don't plan on actually being able to order the items.  Even if you ask nicely.  I REALLY wanted to try the Lobster Macaroni and Cheese, and the waiter said no.  Even though it had been on the websites menu.  

The service at Switch, at least our service, was really poor.  The most the waiter said to us was, ""You ready to order?""  No mention of specials, recommendations, etc.

Finally, after a really bad first impression, we left the restaurant and walked about 20 feet to Botero in The Encore.  It was one of the best dining experiences ever!

Brief account of hands down the most expensive bad service I've ever received in a restaurant:

Switch Restaurant

Arrived at concierge at Wynn approximately 8:30

Attendant recommended switch over craft

They did not have available reservations at the moment unless we wanted to sit outside.

We wanted to sit indoors so we opted for a 9:30 reservation instead.

We arrived at switch at 9:10.

I asked the hostess if it was possible for us to be seated earlier than our 9:30 reservations.

She said to go ahead and be seated at the bar and they would get the table ready for us and get us shortly.

We waited at the bar until 9:30 and then decided to check on our reservations again.

We let a new hostess know that we were waiting on our 9:30 reservations. 

She said they would prepare the table right now and seat us shortly.

After standing there for another ten minutes I approached the podium again to ask for status on our table.

She said they were getting it ready right now.

She helped more guests then she went looking around the restaurant.

She came back and asked us to follow her.

She proceeded to lead us outside.

I explained to her that if we wanted to eat outside we would have been there an hour and a half ago.

She sat us at a 6 person round table immediately and asked if it would be alright.

Although the table was too large for any group conversation, we took it anyways to avoid having to wait any longer.

Too bad since we then had to wait 20 minutes for anyone to acknowledge we were even there.

We tried to flag down several people passing by but no one would even glance our way.

Finally when the manager passed by for the third time, we had to get up from our table to get his attention.

He brought us water and menus finally.

We had to wait 10 minutes after putting our menus down for someone to take our order.

We waited approximately 20 minutes before the waiter came back and asked if he could get us anything.

We suggested some bread to help the wait.

When they came with our food (3 out of 4 being steaks), it took 10 minutes before they brought out steak knives.

We finished our meal and the waiter came by and apologized profusely for the lack of service on his part.

For $250, I would have expected better service in the very least.

We promise to avoid this place at all costs and will definitely stick to Craft.",74Rc0u7CDwkFTzC-IvDYWA,5,1,1,AHt2-dpIB6JLRdPTQkWerQ

Admittedly, I chose Switch Steakhouse at Las Vegas' Encore Resort because of the restaurant's visual ""wow factor"".  Julius & I were in Vegas after all, and I wanted to be entertained!  So even with all its gawdy displays of excess (ain't nothin' wrong wit dat, we LOVED it!) the food wow'd us even more, if that's possible!  We started off with the octopus appetitizer -exquisite, super tender, and just heavenly (we even recommended it to diners at the next table, who thanked us profusely for doing so.)  For our entrees, Julius ordered a juicy NY steak, cooked to a perfect medium rare per his request.  I ordered the Alaskan Halibut - flaky, meaty, and unspoiled in its simplicity. If either of our dishes would have been overcooked in the least, our meals would've been ruined.  So props to the chefs - we watched enough Hell's Kitchen on TV to know how easy it is to overcook steak and fish lol.  For our side dish, we selected the sweet cippolini onions with spicy jalapeno - such a great compliment to both our meals. 
 
I'm now going to dedicate a paragraph to the most ingenious dessert...the ice cream cones!  We had a choice of 4 flavors, so we picked the tart lemon-uzu sorbet (Julius' favorite), the flaky coconut, the rich chocolate, and my ultimate fave, the buttery popcorn (!)  And they were served to us on this cute ice cream stand, with a Happy Anniversary message (we were celebrating our 10 year wedding anniversary a couple of weeks early.)  Julius also ordered a yummy coffee liquor dessert too, because he's on this funny coffee trip right now lol.
 
Switch definitely got us switching up our expectations.  We thought it was going to be all ambience, and the food would be just OK.  Au contraire, it was the other way around.  With the theatrical lighting, music, and walls + ceilings rotating in and out, the food still managed to be front and center.  As it should be!",uyXVvhqI4cgLQl4nY8g47Q,0,0,5,ZwMcQpmwGaT0xu9iQjrGKQ

Music comes on and the whole restaurant dims as if a magic show was about to start. The decor changing wasn't anything spectacular, but it was entertaining for sure.

This restaurant is definitely pricey, but that's what you can expect for dining at Encore. We started off with the grilled octopus which came with potatoes, olives, tomatoes, cured lemon oil. I was worried the octopus was going to be chewy, but it wasn't at all. The potatoes, lemon oil and tomatoes were a perfect compliment to this dish giving it a light and delicate taste. I also ordered the Hudson Valley foie gras that came with chesnut & cranberry cake and cranberry syrup. It was easily the best tasting foie gras dish I have ever had and would highly recommend it if you are a fan of foie gras. The chestnut & cranberry cake with cranberry syrup brightened up the foie gras. The flavors came together effortlessly and were truly divine.  

For steaks, we ordered the dry aged New York Strip and bone-in Rib-Eye. The New York strip had a deep, beefy flavor. It was delicious. The Rib Eye was juicy and made to perfection! The steaks come with a roasted clove of garlic which had great flavor and complimented the steak very well. For sides, we shared the Yukon Gold Potato, Gratin Dauphinois and the Black Truffle Creamed Spinach. My favorite was the creamed spinach.

I was very excited b/c the front desk lady recommended it strongly, apparently the decor changes every 30 mins and she claimed the servers also changed their outfits that often, but it didn't seem to happen with the servers... although we did have at least 2 waiters and 2 bus people at our table. 

Pros: The ambiance and way the restaurant is built is cool.  So cool that I might even add another half star to my review if yelp allowed it.  That said, you can see the decor from the outside if you really just want to see the changes happen. 

Cons:  Customer service was horrible.  We weren't seated until 30 mins past our reservation.  Then it took them another 10 mins to give us a menu.  Then another 20 mins to take our order.  We had to ask for bread and water, which all the other tables had.  The waitress made a recommendation to me and then came back to say the chef couldn't do it.  They switched back and forth between waiters with no communication which was very frustrating.  Because of the waitresses mess-up I sat there without food while my friend ate her dinner and finally just ordered a salad, which was mediocre.  I also had tuna tartare as an appetizer, which tasted like it had been sitting out for a while.  My friend ordered pasta with black truffles for $55 and was something we could have easily made at home (if we found black truffles).  A pile of pasta with butter, salt, cream and black truffle oil.  boring.  Expensive for what you get.  Service is bad and food is mediocre.  They did not comp us anything despite the mistakes and did not even do the basic niceties like saying thank you as we left.

I met up for dinner on a Monday night (surprisingly very busy!) with another vegan foodie friend and her very non-vegan husband. We started with some cocktails - she had the margarita (good, but nothing special) and I had the Ketel 1 Basil Gimlet ($12), which she was immediately jealous of.  This is a fine fine beverage, if a tad sweet.  The basil flavor really comes through and the drink is well-balanced.  We both had this on the next round!

The vegan menu (see pictures) is included on the right flap of the menu, no need to specially request it!  We decided to split the Tofu Carpaccio appetizer, then also split the two vegan entrees, Ratatouille and Polenta with mushrooms.  

The Tofu Carpaccio was really delicious.  Raw, thinly sliced tofu was topped with artichoke hearts, porcini mushrooms, shaved fennel and some ridiculously good sauces.  The sauces really shined in all of our dishes.

The entrees were good, but pretty over priced for the small portion size and lack of high-end ingredients.  The ratatouille was very good, but the timbale was only about 3/4 c of food! And it was topped with almond slivers, which are tasty, but it would have been nice to get some pine nuts up in there for $28.  The polenta cake ($32) was also a fairly small portion, but came topped with several good-sized grilled royal trumpet mushrooms and a smoky, earth sauce that I wanted to lick off the plate.  The polenta itself was well-textured but slightly underseasoned.

After the main course, I was hovering between a 3 and 4 star review, but dessert pushed it up to 4! We split the vegan brownie with raspberry sorbet and fresh raspberries ($12).  Whoa.  I wasn't sure after the first bite, but it just got better and better with every taste.  So good!

(The hubs got a steak and mac n cheese, both of which he said were excellent, then the profiteroles for dessert.  Also a win.)

I kind of like the gimmick of the environs changing every 20 min, although it does tend to stop the conversation dead for a second while you watch the show and adjust to the change.  

All in all, it was a pretty great dining experience.  The service was also awesome and all of the servers seemed to understand and accommodate our vegan needs.  I would definitely return to try the remaining vegan items or give some new entrees a shot if they SWITCH up the menu a bit.  hahahahaha, I slay me.",C-DfyTJjLP6PDP4P__TsBw,6,5,4,x_qV9ku2h7ji3kUWhXxEBQ
4909635,2012-02-21,0,EbP8eduNl-aEy2UVfs3zJA,"I have to admit that it is hard to find chilean sea bass on any menu so the fact that this restaurant served it already gave it a few steps ahead of their counterparts.  The fish was cooked nicely and my husband's steak was also cooked to the right temp.  The food was up to par to what I expect for an expensive meal.  To be honest you can probably get the same steak for cheaper.. it is after all Vegas.  But sea bass is tougher to come by.

8.50 for fiji water? Ouch.  my soda was cheaper... go figure.

The service was nice.  And the waiter even left us alone to enjoy ""the switch"" because he knew thats what we came for.

You don't need to stay too long to see all the switches.  

**spoiler alert:  There are two ceiling switches and three wall switches.  The switch happens on the minute every half hour.

4939640,2010-07-28,0,EbP8eduNl-aEy2UVfs3zJA,"Another pretty decent steak restaurant on the strip, but not much more.

As far as food is concerned, I felt that it was solid, but nothing to write home about, thus the 3 stars given the price which is obviously OVER priced.  I had the bone in rib eye which was perfectly cooked to medium rate with excellent flavor.  I had a piece of my friend's $125 (or something) 4 oz (real) Kobe beef steak and it was fantastic.  

For a decent steak place, the decor could be good or bad, and for me, it was bad, real bad.  It looks like a loud, cheesy buffet restaurant on a cruise ship.  It may be good to take a friend from a small town USA, especially with the ""switch"" thing with the wall and everything, but it's pretty lame for a Vegas local.

For a solid steak, I think I'd prefer to go to a more classy steak place like the Capitol Grille, Prime or Joe's Prime rather than a loud, people-watching kind of place like this or Nine.  BTW, Steve Wynn was sitting a few feet away from me.  I wouldn't go back if I had to pay for it myself.",I510KttlB4dxqER7AueQnA,1,1,3,_MXD8_SEOcFNfaIHPRmGyw

SWITCH elevates steakhouse dining to an elegant affair.  Plate presentation is very modern; if you eat with your eyes, this place wins over SW.

Prices are higher than SW.  

The American kobe beef carpaccio is excellent.  It is served Italian style with a parsley pesto, porcini mushrooms, arugula, and Parmesan cheese.  Yum

I don't usually order seafood at a steak place but had to try the monk fish.  Wow.  Perfect.  The  micro herbs and horseradish just make the dish.

The steaks are excellent.  The aging of the corn fed beef really brings out the beef flavors.  The dry aged new york strip is incredible.  Nutty with blue cheese notes.  The NY strip steak flight is also a must try.  You get to try all three offerings of SWITCH side by side.  Its like a mini beef tasting!  Its a lot of fun but recommend you share it.  

Sides are more inventive than at SW.  The cauliflower gratin, woodland mushrooms, and switch ratatouille are all good choices and all pair well with the dry aged beef.

Service is excellent.

got seated as soon as we showed up.
and then the switch happened...:)  soo NICE!!
the walls moved up/down and switched to a new background, the ceiling moved in/out and switched to a new ceiling, the paintings did the same...changed every 30mins or so.  made the place look different every 30mins as if we were in a different restaurant.
our waiter and the help were awesome.  always checking up on us, water glass always filled.
we had the oysters and lobster bisque for appetizers.  both had no fishy smells and the presentations on both were beautiful.
we had to a lemon drop martini and a house red wine.  
then our entrees, presentation again was nicely done on the filet and the new york strip.  you will not need additional seasonings to it at all.

5230901,2009-01-05,4,EbP8eduNl-aEy2UVfs3zJA,"I wasn't hating this as much as the other reviewers, but I'm being relatively lenient with a few issues we had due to it being so new!

Decor: I thought the walls and ceiling changing every 20 minutes was fun. Kind of silly, but it was a novelty. 

Food:
French Crab cocktail: just crab meat that had been shelled and served chilled with some sauces on the side. Fresh, sweet, succulent, delicious. 

Lobster salad: really tasty and it wasn't just some goopy mayo mess like some others I've seen. Lots of lobster, some avocado.. a nice light dressing. Delish. 

Bread: cold... similar to the bread they serve at bouchon, but not as good!

Risoto: It appears another reviewer didn't love this as much as I did. It was parmesan/champagne flavored and delish! 

Steaks: Awesome, but we had several prepartion issues. The people who ordered their's medium had awesome perfectly cooked steaks. The people (3) who ordered them medium rare all got medium well steaks. 2 of the 3 ate their's as is, but when the 3rd diner asked for a different steak he got some attitude from the waitress. I'm sorry when the steak ordered medium rare is significantly more done than the steaks ordered medium, there was a goof somewhere... they should have replaced it no questions asked. The steak was a dull grey-brown in the middle.. not  a hint of pink.. hardly what I'd call medium rare!

2 diners ordered their steaks rossini style with foie gras.. tasty of course.. but as you can tell from my reviews, I'm a foie gras freak so unless they overcooked it or ruined it, I'm loving anything with foie gras. 

We ordered sweet potato fries, but the waitress forgot to bring them. She belittled my 18 yo sister and told her ""oh you forgot to order them""... umm no, the entire table heard her order them, nice try though. Oh well, so we didn't get to try these. 

I do think this place has some potential. Cool atmosphere, yummy steaks (when they prep them correctly), and some good seafood starters. Service really needs to clean up their act though. If this was a restaurant that had been open for more than 2 weeks I would have definitely give them 2 stars... a steak restaurant shouldn't screw up cooking steaks!",kmE8w5Y785eZmodsx0V6Ag,6,4,3,vcgtWDBwqjnxrOzKS65unA

We began with the carpaccio, which was delicious.  Then I had the bone in filet, which was cooked to perfection, exactly medium rare and hot all the way through.  Awesome!  I had it crusted with black truffle, yum!  Mr. Mixer had a steak and a lobster tail.  The lobster tail actually had quite a bit of meat, which is getting harder and harder to find.

You have to expect the price when you dine at a place like this.

I left 1/2 of my rib eye and was so disappointed that I couldn't take it with me!    My husband's Ahi was plentiful and so tender- it cut with his fork!   The sides were amazing!!

the rest of the girls were mostly satisfied with what they ordered - and yes i totally had food envy.  the table had a nice spread of the sea bass (with yellow tomato coulis, braised fennel, basil-parsley pesto,) sea scallops (with eggplant ratatouille, sweet pea ver-jus sauce) and the lobster salad (artichoke, asparagus, avocado, truffle vinaigrette.)  the lobster salad wasn't what you thought though - no lettuce.  from my side of the table it looked like a big scoop of guacamole with lobster on top.  at least she got a side of the mac & cheese to make up for it.  since we were celebrating two birthdays we were treated with a free dessert.  we were tricked though b/c we were asked what we wanted and they came out with two different desserts, one we had to pay for.  i don't know why they didn't just give us the one we wanted for free.   so we nibbled on the milk chocolate crunch cake (toasted hazelnut feuillantine, devil's food cake, port wine cherries) and the peach cobbler tart (streusel, apricot sorbet.)  i thought that i was going to like the crunch cake more, but the peach cobbler was a pleasant surprise.

if it weren't for the company i was keeping, i think that overall i'd be a little disappointed.  i've been to restaurants and paid way less and was way more happy.  i do love the encore though - it's so pretty and clean.  i'll just have to go back and try botero which is where we originally had reservations, but there was some event going on so we switched restaurants, no pun intended.

5770442,2010-03-11,1,EbP8eduNl-aEy2UVfs3zJA,"The greatest part about this place is why they call it ""SWITCH"". Well once you enter the room, you already know you have to be ready to dish out at least $20 just for some appetizers. We're talking about 5 star dining at the relatively new Encore at the Wynn Resort & Casino. 

So they call this place Switch because every 20 minutes the walls and, believe it or not, the ceiling change. Yup yup you read right, the theme of the entire restaurant changes. I'm not just talking about cheesy wallpaper rollers that just roll to show new pictures, but walls that actually overlap another wall, disappear and reappear, a ceiling that actually transforms before your eyes and folds to fully expose even more gigantic lamps and chandeliers. The music and lighting also changes according to theme. It's not really a negative but they only have three themes hence the change every 20 minutes to cover the hour. This is truly the most amazing part about this restaurant. 

Now for appetizers, I shared a $18 Caesar salad which actually is genuinely the greatest Caesar salad I have ever had in my life. They also provide you with their signature and complimentary sourdough bread and bacon and cheese biscuits, which are different and quite good. They're not great but the presentation is. 

Now for the steaks: 

My cousin had the New York Strip which was actually really juicy and tasty and that was $48. He also got a $10 side of ""whipped"" potatoes which is apparently different from mashed. Me being from the hood I was unfamiliar with the type lol. Anyway it was really good, but unfortunately not great... 

I had the Bone in Rib Eye and that was $52 and that was unfortunately dry because even though I asked for medium-well, it almost came out well so it wasn't as juicy as I would've liked. Honestly whenever I go to a restaurant, I always always always order the steak, even if I'm at Denny's or IHOP and honestly Switch's steaks weren't beyond those places as much as I expected for 5 star dining. Oh yeah and I ordered the Bacon and Mushroom crust which is $7 extra and it really isn't what you think... It's just this awkward greenish brown stuff that tastes nothing like bacon or mushroom with a nasty bean texture. There's nothing crusty about it. 

Aside from that a little complaint I had was that our drinks together came to a total of $9, but I guess that unfortunately comes with the 5 star rep. 

The service is excellent, all the waiters are most definitely on their ""A"" game constantly asking if we need anything else at a not so annoying rate, and they are very polite and helpful when it comes to the menu. They all know their stuff and that is a big big plus. From the drink menu to the actual menu they will take good care of you. 

All together I payed around $175... 

So in general, if you have extra money and you're willing to spend at least $40 for your steaks, $20 for appetizers, and $10 for regular soft drinks and sides, then eat at Switch. The price is considerably worth it considering service and environment. Again the food is good, but unfortunately not great.",Eyr55nGzP5A5wjfqwnEgEA,3,0,4,AtfH2564ORiJMk1Gh33nBA

Loved the truffle creamed spinach and the blue cheese garlic crust that you can add to steaks.  The seafood tower was delicious, but I think presentation was a little cheesy.  The whole dry ice smoke thing is a little 70's.  Baby Gem Salad was wonderful.  Bone in filet which was the special was good, but needed a little more flavor.  Would I go back again.  I don't think so.  I've been to some great steak houses in town with comparable prices.  For the quality and ambiance, I think it was a bit overpriced.  The atmosphere doesn't give the feeling of fine dining steak house.  It feels a bit more casual which to me doesn't translate in price.  The decor changes where fun, but not much more than that.",8tX-EprIfJarL2n88bnqkw,0,0,3,DxCfXkhuenbze4hX2Xbqvw
