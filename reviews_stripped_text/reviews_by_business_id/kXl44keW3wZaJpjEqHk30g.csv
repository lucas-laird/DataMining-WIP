The sides were meals in themselves so beware (the crispy zuchini was litterally a quartered & fried whole zuchini).  The breading in the zuchini was very light & tasty.  It had a sweet note that paired perfectly with the veggie.  Four people ate for approx. $25.00.  The only reason this isnt a five start review; the drive thru service lacked to say the least.  The guy seemed like he really didnt want to work that night...the burgers were slapped together & had to be reasembled before we could eat them.  Crispy zuchini was thrown in the bag with everything on top causing most of the breading to fall off.  Chili fries ordered w/o onions arrived w/ onions.

I finished all of my food and was excited for what I would try on my next visit.

Today's visit was a 180 turnaround for the worst. I ordered the barn burner which is a cheese burger with jalapeno, pickles and all the fixins. I ordered it to-go and maybe that's where it all went wrong. Usually when you take something to-go, your food is still hot unless you're driving across the country! I drove across the street and I kid you not, my bun was cold and crumbled a bit as I tried taking a bite. My meat patty was cool and I was very disappointed(0-1/5 stars). I was starving and didnt have time to take it back or go anywhere else so I took three bites and tossed it away.

Noticing the butter was already applied to my french toast, I replied that the butter was supposed to be on the side. She said she could have it remade, but I said it was fine. I also asked about the coffee and water I ordered, for which she promptly returned with. To me, sunny-side up eggs should be runny. The picture on the menu shows eggs prepared that way as well.

The prices are about average for this kind of place nowadays.  And, considering the quality and quantity of the food, a good case could be made for saying it's IN-expensive.  If my wife and I could agree on a meal, we could very easily eat too much with just one entree.  So, food and price-wise, no problem.  The reason I'm bringing it down a star from 5 stars is because it's a stand-in-the-line-to-order kind of place and the line management is a bit lacking (single-queue, multi-server -- but the line location is odd).

We have had the chicken avo...It comes with big pieces of bacon that cooked nice and cripsy but not fried to oblivion!
The Chicken Club...also tasty and VERY filling. $5.79
The Cobb Salad wgich is a big portion with lots of goodies. No running out at the bottom of the plate. 
Their fries are ok, crispy and a good sized portion but nothing special.
The Fried Zuccini is wonderful. The 4 piece order is 4 huge spears of zuccini. Enough to share. they are coated in a corn meal batter that is light and crispy.

You order at the counter and they give you a number to post at your table. When it's ready, they bring it out to you. I asked him to order a cheeseburger and fries for me. I figured I'd get something simple since these burgers are supposed to be good. As we're waiting I notice the jets that are painted on the ceiling. I guess it was a tribute to the AF base? In any case, it was a little out of place considering that the wall and decor were country themed.

 Well, my burger comes out and under the bun is a whole mess of what looks like thousand island dressing. It wasn't a light smear.  It was a glob of it. Yuck! I managed to scrape it up and covered it with some ketchup and tabasco to mask any remains of the offending sauce. The burger itself didn't seem too bad but I think I was just turned off by the sauce. I have to say though, it wasn't the best burger I've had.  It's not even a mid-range burger for me.

We had:
Country Fried Chicken Bowl: I got the gravy on the side. The bowl was built simply with hash browns, eggs, and a fried chicken patty. The chicken was definitely more succulent than it appeared and overall, I was very satisfied with my meal.
Farmer Bowl (I think that's what it's called): this comes with peppers, zucchini, ham, sausage, bacon, hash brown potatoes, eggs and cheese. I didn't try this dish, but it looked good. If only it came with toast, or we had thought to order an extra side of toast.. Hmm..
Hot Chocolate: ordinary, but what's wrong with ordinary? I enjoyed it.

For around $18 (before the discount), we had 2 complete breakfasts. I'd say it's a pretty good deal if you're in a pinch and don't have time for a full service breakfast place. We both decided that we'd prefer the Cracked Egg, but this place is right around the corner, service is quick, and the price is right. 

I'm definitely planning on coming back to try the burgers, but kind of expect them to be a disappointment.. but until then- I was very happy with breakfast and would go back in a heartbeat.

I got the veggie burger and it was delicious! Even my meat eater boyfriend thought it was tasty. Boyfriend also loved his food, but he always loves his food from farmer boys. 

Environment is inviting and clean, service was excellent (I mean they actually bring your food to you and take your plates when you're done!!) food came out quick (but not too quick you know?)

I have a very light colored leather interior in my vehicle.  Part of my order was 2 small sodas.  The girl Elizabeth went to hand them to me, and I noticed they had a lot of soda drops along the side of the cup.  I politely asked her if she could please wipe them off.  She replies to me with an 11th graders attitude tone, ""They aren't even dripping"". I was shocked! I couldn't believe such a normal request would warrant an argument.  I asked again, can you wipe them off or put them in a cup holder?  She looked at me like I was nuts, Finally I said ""Can you do it or not?"" And she says you don't need to be rude.  Um, is this a joke?  She slams the window in my face as she ignores the fact I asked for the manager.  When she returned I told her to get her manager.  She goes to the manager (I am witnessing all of this through the glass) and tells her side of the story.  Another cashier comes to the window and says, (with her purse on her shoulder, why is she serving or handling anything with her purse?) ""Is there anything I can do to make this experience more enjoyable?"" I said, yes you can get the manager.  She finally comes to the window I tell her exactly what happened.  She sits there like shocked, confused, lost? IDK But I was so livid that if I hadn't just spent $30 and half of the order wasn't for my boss I would have demanded a refund.  DO NOT go here.  
PS: The rude, obnoxious, and obviously spoiled and favored ""cashier"" is named ELIZABETH.  This location needs to put the cashier's in their place, hire a manager with a backbone, and fire the cooks who ruin everything all the time. I am over it and will post reviews everywhere I can find an option.  Totally ridiculous, no offer of a discount, not a free cookie just um', oh, sorry mam.

I just might have to go to the one in my hometown in California more often -- the ones here in Vegas are a bit far away from where I live.

The onion rings were also delicious and crunched easily (meaning the actual onion part didn't slide out of the batter when I took a bite).

As a gluten free vegetarian my options were severely limited (like they always are) but I did get fries, a side salad and a shake. The shake had real strawberries and was hands down one of the best shakes I have ever had. Fries were good, not amazing, but good. The salad, hmm, I would skip the salad. It was just lettuce and tomatoes - nothing bad, just really extraordinarily boring. Hubby had a greasy spoon type breakfast which he dug, so all was good.

Loved the coffee and the continuous refills in a real diner-style china mug - a little expensive at about 1.50 per serving but a nice smooth breakfast blend.  The gravy on the biscuits had a nice amount of crumbled sausage, and definitely used the drippings so lots of taste and plenty of pepper, the way I like it.  The biscuit was not great, though, not very thick, not flaky, like a large round flat disc.  I saw they also have a Strawberry Dessert Biscuit and I can't imagine it standing alone without the gravy.  On the expensive side also for what it was, $2.79.  Better than McDonalds, not as good as I hoped it would be, so I'm still looking.

First, let's talk about this burger.  I got the Farmer Burger since it was my first time there.  I really liked the fact that it came with all of the usual burger toppings and also had avocado.  The burger patties themselves were the disappointing part.  If you're not In-N-Out, I'm kind of over the thin patty thing.  If this is the world's greatest burger, I'm looking at it like I'm looking at my new friend at the nude beach, I want to be impressed by the meat.  Sadly at Farmer Boys, I was not impressed.

The reason this review is three stars instead of two is for the sides.  I got the onion rings and the crispy zucchini.  The onion rings had a good batter and were quite large so the small order of only 4 rings wasn't really an issue.  The zucchini was surprise.  One small order of the crispy zucchini is literally a whole plant quartered and fried in the same batter as the onion rings.  Impressive, yes...practical, perhaps not.  I would have preferred a thinner cut so that they were actually crispy, but I did like the fact that it was a generous portion.

The service was standard, and someone did come around the entire restaurant at one point and ask how everyone's meal was and offered to get guests anything they needed.",ZWTR80zMUGlfcYMjTSQm0A,0,0,3,B_g1z16FFqZDa57LK407Cg

The star was for fast polite service but not for the food. We ordered two barn burner combos. I had the split side zucchini and onion rings and my husband had fries and had his burger no onions. Being they recently opened it was packed. 
The placement of the soda machine was awkward where only one person could get drinks and hurry to find the lids with no where to place your drinks down. When we finally found a seat our order was brought to us. My sides were not right, so we told them and they brought me the onion rings. Then my husbands burger didn't have the jalepenos that should be in the burger and had LOTS of onions! We decided share my jalepenos and scrape the onions off because by this time we were starving. Well after 4 bites my burger was pink and cold and seemed like I was eating a salad. I went to try my onion rings and they had no taste what so ever. By this time we had had enough of the loud conversations where I could barely hear my husband ask me for the ketchup. We left needless to say that my husband didn't finish his meal either.

Farmer Boys is pretty much a high end Carl's Jr. Food freshly made and served straight to your table by number so no standing around waiting and what not.

If you're a fan of Zucchini fries, the ones here will not disappoint you. Even though frying them defeats the concept of being healthy Lol.

You know when you go out of your way to visit a place (one of my favorites I might add), and the food is a disappointment, it bugs me. 
My favorite items to order are the Onion Rings and the Fried Zucchini. Some may know that I spent over 20 years in the food industry, so I know a lot of the little tricks they use to save money.
When you try to maintain your food costs, over keeping up your food standards then it may be time to rethink things about this Farmer boys.
The onion rings were dropped back in the fryer to cook a second time, how can you tell well, the color is not the light golden brown you expect when you pull it out of the fryer. My wifes rings were dark brown, extremely hard for her to eat. My zucchini was not up to parr either they were not the crisp planks of sections of a whole zucchini we are used to. Like they had been sitting under the heat lamp or a bit. 
Now the best thing about having the above two mentioned itwms waas thwir ranch dressing, nice and thick and creamy. Not this time... saving money costs to make the ranch go farther, dilute it with milk, make it runny so it doesn't stick to the food and you get more out of it. 
Gonna go to our old one on the south end of town to see if they maintained their standards. If not Adios Farmer Boys.

Service and cleanliness remain high in ranking that's why the 2 stars.

This place is suppose to use all natural ingredients. We wanted breakfast, but when I seen how thin the bacon was, I opted out for their burgers since they said they were award winning. Well, what credited award was it? Because the burger I had was mediocre. It had no flavor and didn't taste the freshness of the beef. 

The staff was very nice and explained to us about the franchise and that's why this place gets a 3 Star. One person with us didn't even finish her breakfast burrito. Didn't even bother to take the other half home. The salads looked good.

With no one in front of me, I waited more than five minutes to have someone take my order. no one was at the counter, and there was no one in front of me or behind me. Two people on headsets were busy taking orders from the drive-through window which progressed nicely. I finally ordered, and then proceeded to see a number of people in the drive-through window be served their food first, at least for cars. While waiting, a young family entered the restaurant went to the counter and we're helped immediately. When I was finally served, I took my food to go and, of course, fries were cold.

I've been hooked on their salads lately.  Well, actually, mostly just their ranch dressing but I can't just drink ranch dressing because I'm an adult.  So I smother things in it and since it's salad I tell myself I'm eating healthy.  

Anyways...moving on...they have some great new salads.  My current favorite there is the southwest chicken salad ($8.96 after tax).  The lettuce is always cold and fresh, and the black beans, chicken, avocado, cheese, and corn are like a fiesta in my mouth.  I'm in love with this salad right now.  

The drive-thru here is relatively quick and it's on my way home so it's really convenient to pick up dinner here.  I've maybe eaten 5 or 6 times here and it's good food.

*UPDATE* 
I took off a star because the last three times I've been here there has been a problem.  

-2/16/16- Went through the drive thru at 5:30 and asked for three containers of ranch and received none.  

-2/20/16 Went through the drive-thru at 5:30 PM and was charged $17.93 instead of $12.51.  Manager had to correct it and refund my card.  

-3/8/16 Went through the drive thru at 6pm and ordered a southwest chicken salad.  The avocado they put on there looked like they dug it out of a dumpster.  It was almost black.  I can't believe they served that to me!!!  Gross!!!!

I am usually not one to complain or return food at any establishment, I just take the loss and keep it pushing. Considering Farmer Boys is pretty pricey, I had to return my food. I came around 2pm and ordered a BLT, 4 piece chicken finger, and fries. I was in a rush because I had an appointment to get to. I get to my appointment across town and begin to eat my food. The fries weren't fully cooked, literally still crunchy as if it was a raw potato. My blt was soggy and the toast was burnt to a crisp. The fingers seemed like they were in the freezer for ages and fried way too long. I ate a few fries and a few bites of the BLT and threw away what I had but kept the rest in the bag. When I came back to that side of town around 5:30pm I went to return my food. I went back thru the drive thru and explained what was wrong very politely. The manager says rudely, ""do you have the food? If not no refund."" I said I did have the food and went to the window. Again explained what the issue was with the food nicely and the manager, Jesus, was very rude and just kept peeking through the bag. The girl with the red short hair was very nice and she honestly should be the manager, because she handled it nicely. I then get my new order because obviously I didn't want the same thing to be disappointed again. I tell the manager I'd like the difference because my new order was cheaper. He says AND I QUOTE, ""no I won't give the refund because you ate half the food and coming back hours later and it's sketchy to me."" Sketchy? Are you kidding me? Because I didn't come back right away I was on the other side of town. I was very disappointed with how he handled it and I will never be coming back to this establishment. I feel bad for the workers in there that have to deal with such a rude manager.

Fries were just okay.  But O-Rings were real big and thick, such that only a few would do.  And, a simple salad was very good, with fresh little cubes of tomato, Iceberg Lettuce, and a little cabbage.
