Also, we must have had he same server (I think there's only one), agree there also.  This restaurant's saving grace was its food.  Unfortunately, there's no way it'll last under current conditions.  My husband and I went on a Saturday night about 6pm, were there until almost 7:30 and besides us there was only one other table of people, little awkward at first, but we got over it when the food came.  I will go back for the bread and dips alone.  I'm not expert on Afghan food ( for us layman, it is Mediterranean), but the dips were delicious.  My favorite was the yogurt with the ""mediterranean pico de gallo,"" because I don't know its real name. Not a fan of their humus, I think the olive oil was too strong for my taste.  My husband had the filet kabobs, very good, little well done but a good cut of meat that fell apart.  I had the chicken kabobs, delicious, well seasoned and cooked perfectly.  It's too bad this place doesn't have a chance, unless the word gets out.  It wasn't easy to spot, it's hidden in an old storefront, trees covering the sign.  Unless you were seeking it out, you'd never know it was there.",rdz9QHEPoecQ7DJk49ZI-g,0,0,4,I5mgBKtpCeLGGepxp_SIPg

My girlfriend and I were super excited to try this place as it looked really cool from the pictures on the web site and it was reasonably close to our houses.  Unfortunately, when we pulled up, we realized they made it look much better in the pictures as it was just in a strip mall.

We then proceeded to have a very awkward waitress take care of us.  She wasn't bad, per say, but considering the place was empty, it was a little slow.  And just everything about her serving technique seemed awkward.  For example, when bringing out some pita bread and dipping sauces, I had to pry out of her the information of what each sauce was, rather than get a standard explanation of what they were.

The food itself was tasty... if it wasn't for the fact that the place wasn't visually appealing and the service was strange, we'd be back.  But seeing as how we couldn't stop talking about it while we were there, we'll probably pass and go somewhere else next time.  Food alone? 3 1/2 stars.  But overall, only a 2 star for me.",1O638BDK_fWuxgTVJwff-A,0,0,2,s-12Olg5UuxMuqJId_Y-8g

The sign is gone, and although the lights were on and tables were set inside, they quickly turned off the lights as we pulled up in front of the building.  They went back on as we left.  The phone number is now disconnected too.",KF10eZ4ljJ-MtqKb_KXVbA,4,0,1,3RkuySMJe1-FFTIS0fRM1g
