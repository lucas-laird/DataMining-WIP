Only ordered 3 items:
hot bibimbop
chicken gizzard
pork neckbone soup

Not a fan of the chicken gizzard.  bibimbop was standard and the soup was actually pretty good.  Nice place to have around the neighborhood.

1 downfall for me:
It wasn't busy (3 table including ours) and it seemed as though the owner knew the 2 tables that were eating and kept coming by to talk to them.  Would have been nice to maybe stop by and ask if we liked everything.  Being your new maybe you want to make a good impression to your customers.",_O34OQgnyeJ-9w3VnjDR1Q,6,3,3,OSP3JTzaTZe_mGxHAUoO7A

So if you check in at least for us...we got 1/2 pot stickers.  It was nice and crispy.  I like them this way :). The sauce was rather spicy...like a dry spice. It was good when I only dipped a little in the sauce.

We had the bulgogi...I didn't try it so I can't comment on it. But my bf ate it all.

Also ordered was the Japanese ramen.  It was not a typical miso/shoyu ramen...I mean I didn't get a choice on it.  It was a lighter broth.  It was good. No chashu though :( the egg was just a regular hard boiled egg though...so that was a little disappointing..then again this is a korean place...so it's ok.

Next spam musubi...yummy!!! They have egg in it and the rice has diced daikon? It's s yellow picked japanese dish...not sure if it's daikon or not.  Either way it have the spam musubi a nice crunch. It was good and refreshing.

My bf ordered the burrito...it's made with veggies inside. He did not easy a lot of this. It's not the typical burrito.

Then the mussels.  It was ok. The sauce was good and there was cheese on it? But I'm used to a more creamy sauce and flavor with the mussels. I wouldn't order this again. 

So in trying this place I really liked the spam musibi! And the atmosphere...other than that. Typical good. Wasn't bad.  Paid $50 including tip...was full...yeah decent place. 

Great service to btw. They asked if everything was ok...and the owner/manager did ask how was it when we were paying and asked if we wanted boxes....so did the server. But we didn't want any. It was nice of them to see and ask though.",wKF94_BSlODc_v17hDZ9sw,3,0,4,Pf6heZ0CNw21-bxkUt5HnA

I have eaten here several times in the past. I have had nothing but positive experiences. Tonight I had to fend for myself with dinner as the family had prior plans. Eating at a place that offers fresh/healthier choices is always top of my list. 

Tonight it was rather slow compared to the few other times. Which def ment that the service was rocken! My waitress was very attentive, she stopped by several times to check up on me, to make sure the water glass was filled and to see if I needed anything else. 

My food was very delish! I started off with an order of the korean wings. I was very impressed. The wings where hot and juicy. Very fresh! The seasoning/sauce was sweet with a spicy kick to it. I was shocked that the wings was tossed with almond slices, but they was very tasty!  My main dish was was the Yakisoba. But I had them add Bulgogi. Nothing is better than noodles with some bulgogi. Everything was fresh and tasted outstanding. Tonight was the best flavors I have had. I think I might have found my favorite combinations... With these two dishes, I AM STUFFED!!!!! 

I am very glad that I live a few streets away from K-bop... I just wish I ate here more often...",0ZCWuIKOlaB69C90XwpEow,2,2,5,tc64YeV688ExDuQ1XTs5Vw

They were gracious enough to bring some sweet potato sticks, kimchee, and pickled red cabbage for us to try. The Hawaiian bento is both delicious and hearty. The service was excellent. The location is semi hidden on the other side of Baja Taco which is visible from the street. Looking forward to coming back again and again to try more delicious creations. I was allowed to peek at a sample of the dinner menu before they finalized it as they were only open for lunch during the first week of operation and it looks very dynamic. Plan to try more of the lunch menu and have dinner here as well.

We had the fried dumplings as an appetizer which were tasty but I wish there was more to the filling.  The same goes for the bibimbap.  It was served in a sizzling stone pot.  It had beef but honestly the pieces were minuscule and I was hard-pressed to find or taste it because the rice made up most of the dish.

The menu has since changed since we've been there a few months back. We always enjoy the complimentary wonton cinnamon strips.  My children enjoyed the spam musubi.

The server was very accommodating to her allergies and separated her plate from the soy!  The bento box was a perfect serving and very tasty! The bulgogi sandwich was soggy after a while as the juices wet the bun too much.  They need to serve it on another type of bread. My husband has the garlic squid and steamed egg.

1375824,2014-05-07,8,h7vh4Ai3-W4e1sMKhJUNQw,"Hmm, where to put K-bop... probably 3.5 stars but leaning towards the 3. Walking in the door, the surroundings are groovy! The restaurant was adequately contrived. 

The Happy Hour here is for 30% off on drinks only, and runs from 3pm - 7pm. I purchased a couple of Hot Sake's. They were sharp and tasty. Soon afterwards, I ordered some food.

To begin with, I have no choice but to scrutinize the water. It had a murky, pond-river taste. I perceived that it materialized straight from the sink. Grrr....

Ok, so now the food. While inspecting the prices of the tapas, and then scanning the pics taken by other Yelpers, I concluded that it would be more reasonable to order an entree rather than to procure a tapas. (Even after the meal, my belief was that, all in all, every item on the menu was about 2 dollars overpriced)

Banchan - Positively satisfying, but small. 

Soon Doobu - Basically, a spicy seafood stew with ultra-soft tofu. The broth, seafood, and vegetables tasted good. Regrettably, as many other Yelpers have said, it's way to damn spicy!!! (and I LOVE spicy, but it was too much) Furthermore, temperature wise, soon doobu should be bubbling insanely when it arrives to the customer. The one served to me was barely simmering, and when I cracked my egg in, it had completely stopped. So, by the time I mixed the egg in, the egg whites didn't even cook all the way.. Gross.

Service wise, we turned up as a big group, and service was OK.
To conclude, the food is OK but pricey, and service is OK. So maybe between 3 stars and 3 1/2. ¯\_(?)_/¯",gtwM4ijo65AN4DvXdgCu_w,13,7,3,IJ7KOwMY-AhK7VAacIsHcg

First thing I noticed was that they have squid dopbap! I ate that all the time when I was in Korea and their version of it was quite tasty. I also had the Spam Musubi (I know this isn't Korean, but it sounded good to me at the time). Honestly, it was probably the best I've had anywhere. The service was very friendly, and maybe it's because they had plenty of time to serve me since I was the only one in there. I really hope that more people find this place and enjoy it.

The only drawback for me was that there was a strange smell coming from somewhere. It wasn't evidenced in the food, so I don't think it was the kitchen. Maybe it was from the build out of the restaurant since it's so new, but it was not a pleasant smell at all. Hopefully they get that taken care of.

2595399,2014-10-07,7,h7vh4Ai3-W4e1sMKhJUNQw,"I wouldn't consider this place extraordinary, but the generous sized portions are indeed a reason that's worth a return trip. The flavors offered here are semi-mild and not exactly what I come to expect at a legit, authentic Korean ""drinking"" restaurant. It seems as if they dulled down the seasonings a tad, in order to make it acceptable to a wider range of palates.

Don't forget to check-in to yelp and receive your free mini order of 3 gyoza (pot-stickers/ fried dumplings) they were actually crispy, juicy and not bad. They also bring out complimentary cinnamon sugar wonton chips that I could seriously get myself addicted to. Also, their banchan display was gorgeous, but the flavor of each was lackluster and too mild for my taste.

Here's what we tried: 
Dubu Kimchi AKA Pork Kimchi with Tofu ($15.95) (my personal favorite Korean drinking food!) Stir-fried kimchi with spicy pork and served with silky raw tofu cubes. The portion size was impressive and more than enough to share with 3 adults. Flavor-wise: I've had spicier, more flavorful and better, - but it certainly satisfied the craving. Flavor rating: 4/5

Bibim Guksu / Bibim Gook Soo ($8.95) Ice cold Korean spicy (not spicy) noodles. Mix it up and slurp it up! We found it interesting that there were actual ice cubes in the broth; I've never personally enjoyed the dish that way before, but it didn't bother me. We enjoyed the refreshing cold noodles with the tangy and vinegary broth; but it wasn't spicy in the slightest and more on the bland side, so we requested some more hot sauce and doused it with more of the seasoning vinegar that's on the table. Unfortunately, the hard-boiled egg and the tiny bit of meat in the dish was minimal; they were also tough and dry. Other than that, the noodles were beautiful and slurp-a-licious. Flavor rating: 4/5

Although I complained a lot about the flavors being too mild, I have to clearly mention that the execution of each dish was done well, we haven't had a better version in Vegas yet and my boyfriend and I enjoyed our dining experience here.",u_wqt9RshdZsoj8ikLqoEQ,8,7,4,qfJqMWkE_J8mIMl6xC4o5Q

The potstickers were cold on the inside, which was unforunate, but the replacement order was the right temperature.  The bulgogi was decent.  The gizzards were very tough.  I'm surprised they didn't boil it to break it down then just stir fry it with the onions and cabbage.  It would've come out soft, but that's just me.

chicken wings were fried super crispy and delicious.  served in a Korean style chili sauce.  

the mussels were cheesy goodness.  cooked perfectly with a good amount of cheese to compliment your mussels.  

the ebi yaki was really good.  especially being served with bonito shavings, I would go back for these spheres of deliciousness alone.

pot stickers were complimentary with yelp checkin.  membership has its privelages.

school food was ok.  a big portion of pot stickers, Korean sausage, and rice cake.  the sausage was good as was the rice cake.  only complaint was serving size isn't what I'd expect from tapas.  

all in all, a good meal.  food all tasted good, nothing was bad.  i would recommend going with a larger group so you can try many items.  4 or more would be preferable, given the large portions.",1JEXL5K6VTx01tAs6Jskkg,2,1,4,RrSGeZTVJiLTR823cBCodA

Third, they have a free appetizer for check-ins on Yelp, they offer a frequent eaters punch card and they also have chips covered in cinnamon and sugar! So it's a great change of pace or substitute for very costly Korean BBQ!

Strong, favorable first impression. Pleasant setting with modest modern chic appointments and tasteful use of Korean-themed and nature-themed wallpaper. Clever use of woven screens to suggest privacy among tables. Service was polite and timely. Food presentation was pleasing. Taste excellent. We enjoyed the hot bimbipbob and japchae dishes along with chicken gizzards and garlic squid. That was more than enough food for two with enough to take home for a snack. Especially impressed with the garlic squid, which is a dish that can be easily overcooked. Not in this case. Perfectly cooked in a surprisingly tasty sauce. Chilled Ching Dow beer was just right for this combination of plates.

4050512,2013-08-23,5,h7vh4Ai3-W4e1sMKhJUNQw,"I came in hungry and 6 dishes later i can safely say it was unpleasant.  Not the experience, but the food.  I don't understand how this place have such high rating.   I'm actually kind of upset still!  To go through all that and eat everything.  And at the end, pay for it??   Gahhh, what a slap in the face! 

Korean ck wings.  The sauce had a bit tang and sweet, but overall there was no mind blowing factor.  If this was an option at any ck wings joint this would one the less popular item.. There are nuts sprinkle on top of it, yet none in the sauce itself. Luckily for me two pieces didn't fall victim of my EpiPen. The chicken was tough so it's been re-fried.  In fact all the food came out too quick. Like they were all premade or something.  

Corn cheese. I felt there wasn't enough balance of butter and mayo to make this dish pop. The cheese was overwhelming. I had 2 bites and that was more than enough.

Bulgolgi Wrap.  I was going to take this home, but the interest got the best of me so I took a bite.. That first bite was all rice and veggies. Reminded me of a fresh Vietnamese spring roll (that's a good thing), so I took another huge bite to actually get piece of meat in.  The beef had some flavor in it, but overall the fillers were overbearing for the Bulgolgi to shine through. For ~5bucks skip it. It's not happening. 

Garlic squid: prob the best tasting item we had.  They offer grilled squid too, but we opt for this instead since it's out of the norm.  At first it looks like a lot of squid but after picking at it we're left with just as much garlic gloves in the platter.  Share this because it get quite heavy after a while.

Grilled meat balls: We found out later that there's a sweet and sour sauce that goes with it?  My guess is that it's bottled. Somehow it was misplaced on the table, so I'm just going to assume they're paired because those balls needed a major lift.  Still, it didn't help. Skip this popular item.

Budaejjiigae: This was more of a personal item served in a stone pot rather than in a casserole.  You get usually fixing; 1/4 a ramen brick, sausages, hot dogs, spam, kimchee, rice cakes, onions, and glass noodles(new to me.)  Everything I love in a stew, yet no fidelity to this one here.  Super bummer because I was so looking forward to this one, but it was terrible.  If i had to describe it, it's like eating all your favorite shit in a pot of hot water.  The color were spot on too, but why was i cheated??

Last but not least we had a Deep Fried Oreo:  Light Tempera batter, ice cream, chocolate drizzle, and whip cream.  Pretty much foolproof.

Service was cool.. Our waitress was nice.   Would have been dope if she mention something about the HH, because i totally forgot about that until after we left.  

+.5 for Barley Tea.  I'm only putting 3stars to keep it mutual for yelp.  But to my friends here, skip it. Unless you like being miserable and paying for it.",pDvDLpD7CiMlIebsDPCRSQ,9,4,3,Q9VCSUJrj3p0pTyrIt3EPQ

Potsticker: Crispy and really good with the soy chili sauce they gave us. 
Grilled squid: Garlicky & really flavorful but we had to eat it fast since it was served on a hot plate which could make squid taste rubbery if overcooked. 
Baked mussels: Was okay. Very cheesy and not a lot of flavor. 
Tobiko steamed egg: Light and fluffy. I like how they added the roe on top giving the egg the taste of the sea. Also try the eggs with their house chili sauce. Yummy :)
Hot bibimbap: I liked the texture when the rice at the bottom cooked and became crunchy.
Bulgogi plate: Tender and delicious. 
Soon tofu soup: pretty good but the pork was a little tough.
Honey brick toast with ice cream: ordered this ahead of time since it is supposed to take  about 15 minutes to prepare. It was served while we were still eating our entree so some of the cream melted :(
It was simple dessert but really good and satisfied my sweet tooth;  my kids ate it with much gusto.

I came across it on yelp, while looking for a restaurant that serves tapas, naturally having a nice spanish meal in mind, but I saw photographs of this one and absolutely had to try it. 
Ambience: Like a lot of places off the strip it is located in a strip mall, but as soon as you enter, you end up in a minimalistic orchard with sheltered paper-framed cabins for small groups, the walkway to the restroom is wall-papered with trees, so I felt as I was having a stroll at Champs-Élysées. Dim lighting appropriately completes the mood, but bright enough to read the menu ;). 
Food: You will definitely find most of your favorite Korean specialties on the menu, however it definitely is contemporary fusion with French/Japanese style taste layering and presentation. We could not choose and ordered too much to eat, but ended up finishing it all to the last piece. I am not sure what to recommend, as we had 6 dishes between three of us and they were all perfect from soup to dessert, so I assume other things on the menu are comparable.
Food presentation: is clean and minimalistic tastefully mixed with traditional very much in tune with decor of the place. 
Price: very basic as the menu card, we ended up spending about $80 for three of us, that included drinks. I could not have expected better experience for the money for sure.",96lXgJA0j3AdpgURfXjj-g,2,0,5,OMxS1RV_UINiTF_D7La1KQ

We finally made it in (3/22/14) and it was awesome! I feel so bad though because there were probably at least 5 times we had driven by on a Saturday night and decided not to go because it looked like nobody was in there! Do not let that fool you like it did us. We feel stupid for waiting so long to try this place. My boyfriend is Korean and the food was really delicious. 

I had the Stone Pot Bibimbap which was one of the best I've ever had- the rice was perfectly browned on the bottom and came out sizzling. I ate every last bite. My boyfriend ordered the Poor Man's Soup and devoured it- it was fantastic but of course the one his mom makes at home is the best. ;) I love how they present their banchans all together on a cute little plate too. 

One of the things that really surprised me the most was how nice it was decorated inside. Obviously the owners spared no expense and it reminded me of a place you would see inside of Mandalay Bay or something. I really loved the Korean wallpaper and the backlit walls. It was spacious and they were really smart about their partitions between tables as it gave a sense of privacy without taking away from the ambiance of the restaurant. 

The service was great too- while our server only had three other tables while we were there, she was very attentive and had a genuinely caring attitude and smile. 

I really hope this place does well and that more people discover how nice it is for themselves. I think the location (next to Home Depot) has a lot to do with it not being very busy when we had previously driven by. Nothing in that area is open very late except for K-bop and it's hard to see!

It may be because I've been accustomed to how I believe it is supposed to taste due to past experiences. The spam musubi had too much sweet daikon in it, that it overpowered the musubi which is hard to do considering spam is so salty. It was also greasy and fell apart quite easily.

Besides that, the service was good. The waiter was so nice and he was pretty funny. 

My hot bibimbap was actually average. I've had better, but the honey toast. I've been looking for a a good honey toast and I've tried a lot. This place is pretty good. The presentation made it look so good and it was!",z4xZolh3zzBmPEW6RuGuJQ,0,0,4,xoOll2Uv6Y1rawav8wxXIg

It took me a while to choose from the menu because all of it sounded so good! I decided to get the box because it has three different meats and rice. Their side dishes are served in a really cute way, and they really care about presentation. For an appetizer treat, they give you fried wonton strips that are sprinkled with sugar which are suuuper tasty. I even saved some for the end to dip in our vanilla ice cream with chocolate sauce and that was such a treat! 

They place k-pop music videos and it's definitely a fun atmosphere. The inside decor is beautiful as well as the painting job on the way to the really clean bathrooms. That was a plus. My experience was here was very enjoyable. We came on a rainy day because I was getting my car done near by. And I'm glad we did! The lady was super nice and always helped with a smile. If you're ever in the area, you should try it!
