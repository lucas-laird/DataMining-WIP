However all the lights were off and a young man was parked at the open drive through window with his window down as well. I stayed there for ten minutes hoping the young lady would be polite enough to stay open for the hours posted but she did not.",unBY2d6ytv9jzKZrjtV1eA,0,0,1,Xzp3OPX-i8GDW5ijluVP1A

I've been saying for years how awesome it would be to have a drivethru subway. But this place had like 4 tiny tiny tables to sit at inside, the lady who helped us had a crazy attitude AND they didn't have the veggie patty!!! What?!? That's the only thing I get at subway! So I ended up just not eating. Dumb!",Qq8_wsGicIneUeA9XJYaWQ,2,1,2,jDqnB2SKBVeP-pfDuPpEDw

I past them on my way home from work, but I back track and go to the one on Nellis & Lake Mead. Yes it's out the way but the drive Thur is amazing, and it's always good.",uFgu9NzU9-kmALQf4keqcQ,0,0,1,WHtgkbNj_l6cmh6Kircb7A

Those are the nicest things I can say about this hell hole.  Like everyone else I only come here because of the drive thru (which usually takes about 20 full minutes to get through AND THAT'S WITH NO LINE).  The employees there are clearly depressed and could care less (which isn't really their fault. They make 8 dollars an hour.) Just awful.  Avoid it at all cost.  It's gross clearly never cleaned and they don't care about their customers at all. Go 2 miles up the road there's another one, it's also 24 hours. Clean and friendly.  Trust me.",zMLVGX6T4KvCnwLLtWt56g,0,0,1,nwytXGGMNNhn_ZnoHUvH7w

I am 9999% sure the cashier was on acid or completely baked.  But when you stop mid order to make the sandwich and forget to ask what you want on your sub until it's completely made, it's pretty ineffective.  

In a span of 10 minutes the phrases, ""whuuut?"" ""Hold On...whut?"" "" Wait..."" ""Huh"". ""Um...ooh yeah"" were used at least 3 dozen times.

And they didn't toast my meatball marinara subs.

Looked as if she was robbed or something. She told us we had to order through the drive up window. It's a subway so no big deal. Customer service ended up being ok. I would come back if I don't feel like getting down.,kBlma2kzCdtKXOzO4xhKFA,0,0,4,cq7i6WGteb1_ATLEWMk1eQ
