The parking lot situation can be a little strange here as there is minimal parking at the front of the restaurants, but plenty in behind.  Anyway, we were jones-ing for burgers, and this is where we decided on.

The place is nice.  Has an island theme, of course, and plenty of booths.  Our waitress took a while, but we weren't in a rush so no big deal- but could have been better, and quicker.  We got a chicken burger with guac, cheese, bacon, etc. and the pepercrusted burger- both with wheat bun.  Props that they give you the choice of white or wheat.  Both were about $10 each, tasty, and definitely hit the spot.

Overall, decent enough.  Will probably try LBS in the RedRock or hit up Kilroys the next burger excursion though.",LR9E4bHOHnYnjLnUGYOV8A,1,0,3,wthaaSEbagXrvYLagRC50g

621608,2008-07-30,0,SycXTaA4MeJZuDK4Y1owDQ,"May be a ""Fine Burger"" place, but I had the Fish Tacos. I didn't even notice a burger on any of the tables. But I wasn't paying that much attention. https://www.islandsrestaurants.com/img/top/menu.png

Service was spot on!! Right on top of it.

The Tacos (qnty.3) were fine. A bit oily. One of the folks I was with commented ""not as tasty as I remember"". It was what I believe was a just a piece of Cod. They were worthy.

 ""Curb Side"" Take-Out orders available (order online). Designated parking spots around back for your ""Curb Side""orders. Which I don't know about how well the fish tacos might handle that.

Genuine simulated Bamboo and Palm details. Not a big room, seats maybe 100 max. Sort of an enclosed Bar straight in as you enter. I somehow ended parking in the ""back"" (next to the take-out spots) walked in the door I saw. Ends up a rather adventurous walk to get to my party who were seated inside of the Bar space. Picture a square inside of a square type Maze cluttered like Gilligan's Island and you entered the wrong way.

I'd go back. But not sure I'd shout out ""lets go to Island's"" if in a group looking for a place to eat. Now if I was staying at Red Rock Casino Hotel and I wanted to leave the grounds, Island's is right across the street.

The staff was genuine and friendly. Didn't miss a beat!

This last time I was there in particular, my food was just ok tasting. The meat patty itself was very thin. And it was expensive! My boyfriend and I both had water to drink and ordered a burger and it was $28.00 minus tip!!!

Walked in at was somewhat overwhelmed by the generic /Hawaiian motif.  It was a Sunday and the bar seemed to be the place to sit.  Not for the football because I am in protest mode despite being a hypocrite and being in a fantasy football league....but I digress...It just seemed a fitting place to chill and have a burger & beer lunch.

The bartender was friendly and attentive.  We ordered up some Cheddar Fries w/ bacon.  Tasty fries, cheese and added some bacon.  When the cheddar cools the dynamic changes but I am not hating....just add ranch.

The burger ordered was the ""Nalu Nalu,"" and contains Roasted garlic aioli, swiss, sautéed onion, mixed peppers, hot deli pepper rings & lettuce"" (Retrieved from https://www.islandsrestaurants.com/food).  It was delicious!  After the fries I could only eat half of it....speaking of fries, because I had already ordered a the appetizer, I had the burger come with onion rings.  They were....delicious!

Point Break burger is my favorite here, loaded with Gruyère & bleu cheeses, caramelized bacon & onion relish, lettuce, tomato & mayo. I love how they cook their burgers to medium here, but the large patty and overabundance of toppings, plus the medium cook, means the burger is on the brink of falling apart. I also blame the juiciness of the patty, to an extent.
All burgers come with bottomless fries, which is a great idea but not one I can handle- order to go if that's a death wish for you as well. Beware that your takeout fries may be cold and stale though...

Fish tacos are on the menu, but I have yet to try them. Swing by for Monday and Friday night football specials, in addition to their weekday happy hour specials.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,2,3,3,sR4Q-smDQEef66vFj1J7LQ

1632999,2014-10-11,1,SycXTaA4MeJZuDK4Y1owDQ,"Took the family out to this Islands for our Friday night dinner. A little back story I grew up in San Diego and went a few times to the Islands in Carmel Mountain  Ranch. The wifey lived in Rancho Bernardo for years and went to that particular location also. That place was almost always busy but we always got at least decent service. So now I was craving Islands and decided to check this location out. We live in Henderson so it's a good 30 minute drive. We walk in and the place is basically dead. I could see at least 6 vacant tables. The first worker sees us and walks over and says he'll be right back. A good 5 minutes later another guy comes over and say he'll be with us shortly. He walks to their little podium and starts writing. Then the phone rings and he motions with his hand another minute or so. So finally he seats us. Of course they put us in the noisy area next to some lady who can't shut the fuck up. It wouldn't bother me so much that she couldn't stop talking it was how loud she had to talk. My wife and I talked about how some places like to seat us with other families with kids. We agree it's a common practice.  It does take awhile for our server to get to us but finally we get the ball rolling. She orders the kids meals then we order our meals. We both want burgers but the odd thing is our server asks immediately ""Is medium okay""? We're both cool with that since that's what we usually order anyway but found it odd that she was pushing the medium so hard. This is where it gets interesting but not really. We get the food in literally 2 minutes. I couldn't believe how fast we got our food. I've never gotten it that fast not even at a fast food restaurant. But when we started eating we realized how they were able to cook our food that fast. MY burger and the wifey's burger were basically raw. They barely seared the outside of the patties so it was all pink inside. After that we never saw our server again until after the meal. Oh by the way I was hit with a spray of Ranch dressing while I was eating my burger. A server at another table was clearing the table and dropped a full container of Ranch dressing. It shot everywhere but of course it only hit me. Got me in the shirt and the face. I was looking down so when I got hit it felt like someone spit in my face. I semi yelled ""WTF! who spit on me""? Two servers came over and asked if I was okay. They kept asking me but that was it. So we finished our meal and we had finished our ice teas halfway through the meal but nobody ever came by to refill our drinks. We didnt see our server until she brought the check out. The whole time once we sat down we felt like they wanted us to eat fast and leave fast. We felt very rushed and we couldn't figure out why because for the time we were there the place didn't fill up. I would guess this is a management decision. Get them in and out as fast as you can. At least that's what it felt like. It sucks for the servers because they aren't gonna get any tips that way :) Just a theory of mine though. So make sure to order the burger the way you want it. The fries were good if you like crispy and don't expect to get a refill on your tea. We won't be going back to this location ever. We have a ton of burger places in our immediate area so theirs no reason to drive this far for mediocre service and food. Plus we hate leaving a restaurant parched.",E3pXvQwKsPBQGQ7RkLrN3g,1,0,2,lhordnhEOS78xYbs3Y6jAA

The hamburger tasted like a Jolly Rancher. It was a plain hamburger but had some weird watermelon flavor in the defrosted mass produced bun perhaps? The hamburger patty reminded me of a TV dinner Salisbury Steak. It was very light and had the texture of a sponge.  

The service was good. After eating at this establishment, I threw up when I got home. The scent of watermelon meat is still in my nose.

2462752,2018-04-04,0,SycXTaA4MeJZuDK4Y1owDQ,"I always think it's a bit silly to review chain restaurants because you almost always know exactly what you're getting. A Chili's in New Jersey tastes exactly like the Chili's in San Fran.

Island's is a little bit of an exception though. While there are a ton in SoCal where I'm from, this is the only location out here in Vegas. For that reason, I think they deserve some recognition. 

So their burgers are radical, bro. Big Wave w/ cheddar cheese for the big kahuna over here. I always appreciate the option of having a wheat bun as well. They also have KILLER tortilla soup. I always sub that instead of fries. Which, BTW, fries are single handedly the most overrated side dish in the world, maybe universe. I also recommend the chips & salsa as a starter. First, unlimited refills, ammaright? Second, they are really good. Just like Chili's actually, if you're a fan of theirs. Islands also has Cherry Coke, how sweet is that? Super sweet, bruh. 

Big fan of all the surfing videos they show throughout the restaurant too. 

My one complaint would be the price. It's definitely on the higher side for burgers. Then again, it's a chain, you get cool ambiance, and the food is almost always great. Probably worth a few more bucks.

I wish there was a location closer to me. I have to schlep all the way to Summerlin to get my Islands fix, which sucks. I don't like Summerlin. So build another one that's closer to me, please.

Not only is everything there made fresh (as in no frozen patties or fries) but they have a great menu with lots of different delicious burgers to choose from.  The best part is, if you're picky, (like me), then you can change it up. Don't want beef? Get turkey. You don't want turkey? Get veggie or chicken. It's always that simple. Plus you can add island reds (thin crispy onion straws) to any burger and at this particular Islands,they pile em' high.

With all that said about the delicious burgers, I actually go for the fries. They fresh cut their potatoes in house and fry them to golden perfection served fresh. Yum!

Oh yeah, if you don't like burgers (super weird but okay) then there's lots of other things to chose from like salads, sandwiches, tacos, quesadillas, nachos, buffalo wings and more.

We got our bill and I was shocked to see we were being billed for the nachos. I couldn't believe they had the nerve to charge me for them when I complained about them twice! I think got up and asked to speak to the manager. The manager comes over and I explain why I felt I shouldn't have to pay for the nachos. She then begins to argue with me about the length  I had to wait for the nachos. Wait. What? Is she serious? ! Finally she says she will remove them from my bill....she leaves for a few minutes and then comes back to our table and then says to me..we are able to check ticket times and I didn't even let her finish her sentence at that point. I was shocked that she'd come back to tell me that! !! I said are you really coming back over here to argue with me about the time it took? ??

The result now was zero wait time to be seated ona Friday not which I was pleasantly surprised.  We arrived just before the end of happy hour so I rushed the bar to take advantage of $4.69 IPA and Mai Tai. They did have other choices that were all reasonably priced. Service was quick and accommodating. 

I ran back to my table and server was waiting.  I've had the Bluenami Burger and it was delicious. This visit I went with there special the ""Hana hou"".  With grilled onions, cheese and a spicy mayo sirracha sauce.  I did enjoy the kick the burger had and they actually cook the burger to order and proper temp when I requested. The fries were a tasty natural cut with a generous portion. Someone said they were all you can eat but I did not have to have seconds.  I like that you can order wheat buns for your burgers if you choose.

Personally, I always get the Big Wave (hamburger) no cheese, well done on a wheat bun. Plus you can never go wrong with their bottomless/endless fries. I always ask for some fries to start with. Food is always cooked to your liking. The tortilla soup is really good too. Very flavorful. 
For those of you who are complaining that they will not make your burgers anything less than medium, I'm sorry but if you want a bad case of e.coli or diarrhea because you are practically eating raw meat then go eat a cow right from the farm. Is that raw enough for you?! Eating such rare meat isn't healthy. Anyways.... service is always good; they always top off our drinks and get us any extra condiments or napkins in a timely manner.

It's a shame that this is the ONLY Islands in the entire city. Wish they will open up a location in Henderson or somewhere besides just in Summerlin. Born and raised in So Cal, Islands was my place back in the days. Oh...those 2005-2009 memories!

The menu doesn't seem that big, but it definitely has something for everyone:  a nice variety of burgers, fish tacos, sandwiches, soups & salads, and my favorite: the Hoisin Bowl with chicken.  There are also appetizers, a kid's menu, and even gluten-free options.  If you're in the mood for an adult beverage, be sure to look at the drinks they serve with an island flair, and the nice selection of domestic and craft beers.

I find the idea that ""they tell you"" how you like your meat cooked a bit annoying, although they will happily tell you it is for your own protections and I assume for their legal protection? -Still. Annoying And in my book, their Med is Medium Well.

Seated right away so that was good I guess.  Not really greeted at the door but it's whatever.  Waitress came right away and got our drinks so that was a good start.

Kid had burger and apples.  Burger was fine but apple should have been trimmed, lots of brown spots in the middle.  Wife had a burger, which she enjoyed however the fries were tasteless and not seasoned at all.  According to the menu and pictures there should have been something on them.  I had the Northshore Tacos... the best thing about them were the beans.  Lettuce had some brown spots, so it wasn't fresh.  Cheese was non-existent and overall the tacos were bland.  I honestly had better tacos in a military galley and they feed you for about $2.  For something that was about $12, I left hungry and disappointed.  I was bummed about it because I do remember them being good.

2 stars because it was clean, had I based it just on food... 1 star.

After a long day of shopping at the Downtown Summerlin Mall I wanted to actually try something different and dine at something outside of the food options that they provide there.

You know how you have those places that you always drive past that you say to yourself I'm going to eat there one day? But continue to procrastinate? Yeah umm Islands was exactly that place! So glad I finally tried them out because my family and I had a fantastic time here and really enjoyed the food! Our server was amazing and so helpful with my stepmothers gluten free diet. It's difficult sometimes eating with people who have allergies to certain foods so having a server be understanding and accommodating was appreciated! 

This place is of course known for the burgers so I went for one of the spicy ones! The Sriracha Smack burger was my choice of the night followed by a side of  chili cheese fries! My dad and younger brother said they really enjoyed the ""Pipeline"" burger which is basically a chili cheese burger! My other younger brother ordered the grilled fish tacos and gave two thumbs up and lastly my stepmothers gluten free concoctions came out just how she liked. Can you say a happy and full family?!

My friend had one of the burgers, and it looked sensational, and he said it was.  My one complaint is that the fries were not good at all.

The fish had burnt grill marks that seemed harmless but the fish was apparently charred down deep so it really tasted burnt. I tried 2 bites and that was enough to send shock waves throughout my system. Besides the 2 bites the meal was boxed up for Mikey ( you know the commercial of the Life cereal kid who would eat anything) . Well my Mikey tried the fish tacos the next day and agreed that the fish was burnt. So I paid a hefty sum for two bites of food. The only thing I can recommend at Islands is the burger and fries. Otherwise everything else that I have tried has not been good.

My husband and I ate at Islands about a month ago for the first time- we sat in the bar which was pretty quiet for a Saturday night and had delicious drinks and burgers.  So yummy!  A week or two later we decided to try it with our kids (3 and 6) in tow.   We hadn't seen the kids menu so didn't know what to expect but it was great.  Our kids LOVED the grilled cheese sandwiches and we appreciated that they have two different sized meal options for the kids- the half ""Sandcastle"" (grilled cheese) was perfect for our daughter and our son gobbled up the regular Sandcastle.   We also loved that they have many options for sides for the kids to choose from besides french fries.

Our waitress (wish I'd caught her name!) was great- when we ordered apple juice for the kids she asked if we wanted it cut with water- something we do at home but have never been offered at a restaurant unless we ask.

I had my favorite drink- the Mahaka.    After I ordered a second one the waitress came over with the bartender- apparently they were out of one of the ingredients and so the bartender suggested some alternatives I might like.  It really impressed us that she came over with suggestions.   

All in all, we love Islands.  The burgers are delicious, the kids menu is great, and the service is top-notch!  We'll be back soon!",zW_7gEgX12ZUkBGlZt_Gbg,0,0,4,A7P2buFkcpdhG6bnxXIqLw

My fiancé and I visited Islands Restaurant on July 4th around 6:30 pm. We arrived just in time for happy hour. Happy hour is from 3pm - 7pm at the bar and on the patio area only. There is plenty of seating in both areas, but we opted out of happy hour and got a booth.

I love the theme of the restaurant because it goes with the name. The restaurant is island themed and items on the menu are as well. All the burgers on the menu seemed delicious so it took me a while to order. While we were looking over the menu our waitress Amanda offered great drink selections as well as food. Of course I had yelp to help me decide, but it is always good to have a server recommend their favorites. 

I ordered a strawberry pina colada and the Hula burger. The hula burger has yummy sautéed mushrooms, lettuce, tomato, swiss cheese, and mayo. I added bacon on my burger with a side of cheese fires, and it was all delicious. My fiancé ordered the burger with the crispy onions, ( I can't recall the name of it) and enjoyed every bite of it. I also like how you are able to substitute the fires for other side options.

My husband always gets a burger- now comes with fresh cut fries. I think he gets the Hawaiian- pineapple, teriyaki sauce, lettuce, tomato, onion, & swiss cheese. I've had the Kilauea- jalapeno, black pepper, pepper jack cheese, chipotle, lettuce, & tomato- tasty for the person who likes a little spice, like me. I've also had the sandpiper- grilled chicken breast, sautéed mushrooms, swiss, lettuce, tomato & mayo- I always scrape it off because every place puts too much of it. Otherwise, very gratifying eats. 

Also on the menu are: chicken sandwiches, tuna sandwich, wraps, soft tacos, salads and soups. For those of you watching your waist line, the  ""Paradise Bikini Beach"" menu- kinda like Applebee's lighter menu, listing the total calorie count. 

The last time we were here (around summer), there were a couple of senior ladies across from us, who kept staring at us and our food- they even tried to make conversation, ""Ooh, is it goooood?"" But my annoyed husband, who hates when people stare at his food, opened up a menu and placed it standing up, so they couldn't look at us anymore- I think they got the hint. They were pretty chatty and talked to several other people in passing. Other than that, we enjoyed our meal here.

Overall a great place for burgers. It's fairly popular with people of all ages and a good crowd is always here for lunch (the only time we're here). And then afterward we walk around in some of the stores in the area.",fiGqQ7pIGKyZ9G0RqWLMpg,2,1,5,kLfoUDaCB7Gb7mP6wqL0UQ

This location is in Summerlin so for the most part, the service is what you would expect in this area-- friendly, smiling faces!

4286915,2008-08-29,4,SycXTaA4MeJZuDK4Y1owDQ,"I don't really eat red meat outside of the family farm, so is it really fair to critique a burger joint when I didn't try a burger? Screw you, here's my review anyways. 

Bf was craving a big burger and he figures I'm from the islands, might as well take me back. What islands this joint mimics, I'm not sure. But I don't think its the Hawaiian islands. Maybe the Florida Keys. The place is decorated like a Jimmy Buffet song. It pretty gross. 

The service was friendly enough. Our waitress was attentive and polite. They're located right next to Palo Verde High School so at around 2p, a bunch or under-aged waitstaff waltzes in. Yes, young waitress snatch. 

Bf normally tries the wings where ever he goes. Its his barometer of overall quality. My barometer would be the fries. More on that later. The wings were $9 for a basket. I said the basket better be pretty big and made of gold for $9 and change. The wings were standard buffalo wings with that buttery, vinegary orange glaze, served with ranch and carrot and celery sticks. On his second wing, he bit into a cool spot. Quality control much? 

The menu items are hokey ""island""ish names like the Hula burger, the Kilauea burger, the Hawaiian ... The Maui burger comes with quacamole. Um ... is Mexico an island now? 

They also have a Kaanapali [sic. Should be Ka'anapali, with okina] Kobb, a cobb salad. There was absolutely nothing Hawaiian about it. 

I ordered a Hula burger on wheat, like a mushroom swiss + extra charge for avocado ($8 + 1). My favorite thing about this place is that they'll substitute any beef patty with a veggie patty, free of charge. They also sub chicken breast burgers for +$1. 

Bf ordered a Kilauea burger ($8). He wanted his burger rare, but our waitress told us they don't go less than medium. Hold the phone. Why is this? It takes less effort to cook a burger rare. Because you cook it less. So why in Zeus' name can't they cook it less? We didn't make a big deal, beyond the Zeus speech and he just got it medium. 

When I looked at his burger, I couldn't tell the difference between the wheat bread and the thoroughly-cooked beef. Brown brown brown. 

My burger was good. But if you screw up a veggie burger, you need to kill yourself. My burger smelled so buttery. The butter from my sauteed mushrooms soaked into the top bun. The whole thing was mushy from the moisture of the mushrooms, the mayo, and veggie patty ... and it was wonderful. There's a part of me that enjoys mushy burgers. I ended up having to eat it with a knife and fork in the end. Its like the middle of the cinnamon bun, all messy, but that's where the biggest concentration of flavor is. Oh, yeah, and I eat my burgers in concentric circles. 

The fries. A travesty to fried foods. They were like greenish. They were thicker than shoestring and flavorless and dry. But they're not cooked in lard and have no trans fats. Honestly, if I'm eating fries, they better be cooked in lard and taste like pig guts and I don't care about the trans fats. They're french fries goddamnit. Not jicama. 

There's a little table tent advertising about how their wonderful fries now come with the burgers. Because they can't sell them any more. They have to give them away. 

There were only two desserts, each $6. But we didn't bother because they looked super boring. One was a brownie with toppings. The other was fudge ice cream with toppings. Meh. 

The total before tip: $32. Gr.

Oh. And ""Fine"" should be stricken from this establishment's name.

This place reminds me of my college years at UCSB: its Islandy, laid back and relaxed. They have three TV's near the bar with a variety of sports on and they will always change the channel for you. 

The beers are great, highly recommend the IPA. The food is great too. Its a burger joint and the Rincon ( Guac and Bacon, whats better than that?) and Malibu are my favorites.  The hidden jewel on the menu is the Chicken Quesadilla with Baja Chicken, I tell everyone to try this, if you do, you will be back. 

The Fries: Always freshly made and served warm and seasoned. They are endless with burgers , so get some to take home if you have leftovers.

Everyone was as nice as could be, but I guess when I was remembering 'Islands' from driving by it, I always forgot that 'Fine Burgers and Drinks' was part of the name.  So I was expecting to find a totally different menu, but when we pulled up I realized I had made a mistake.  I was cold and we were heading to a movie after, so I didn't want to try to go find a new place to eat.  
Anyways, if I had gotten a burger, I might be giving this a 4 or a 5 star, but my boyfriend and I both got salads.  They cut the lettuce into the tiny pieces there, which isn't my favorite style, but whatever.  I got the Kobb (sic) salad and he got the BBQ Ranch Salad.  Neither were great, neither were bad.  Mine needed more bacon and the dressing was a combination of creamy ranch and caesar, which was mildly offputting. 
Being a dessert person, we also shared the Brownie Sundae, which didn't taste homemade, slathered in what tasted like Hershey's syrup and aerosol whip cream and almonds.  The almonds  were a tasty addition.

I used to like to come here for a juicy burger, you know, the kind the owner looked for after surfing many years ago and was his inspiration for opening the restaurant in the first place! The burgers are now thin little patties like the kind you get at In and Out. Seriously, 5 Guys puts out a bigger burger for half the price.  

As for the fries...they need to be seasoned when they come out of the oil so it sticks. 

Service, well, not impressed. The server stood against a booth across from us and asked if we wanted anything. I wasn't even sure if he was talking to us. Not much eye contact. What happened to making your customer feel welcome? Oh, and when your guest presents a birthday email sent by your company offering a free dessert, saying ""Happy Birthday!"" Is a nice gesture.

Once we were seated it took about another 10-15 minutes for someone to come and take our drink order. Following those delays everything else went fine service wise. Regarding the food, I will first say it was good. I had a bacon cheese burger and fries. The fries were very good and crispy. I have never been one to say this, but their menu selection leaves a lot to be desired. The essentially only do salads, tacos and burgers. Their kids menu on the other hand is great, with two different menus based on age and portion size. One menu was for 6 and under, the other for ages 7-12.

5100264,2013-02-28,0,SycXTaA4MeJZuDK4Y1owDQ,"Not great, not terrible, but three thumbs up for that TORTILLA SOUP!

I recall being 13 and thinking Islands was this fancy place with fancy burgers. I'm now not 13 anymore and have been set straight. Not my first choice to eat here but after a 3-hour hike with only a Cliff bar in my stomach, anything that wouldn't give me food poisoning was sounding pretty good at the time. 

I went with their limited edition burger whose name escapes me. The burger was tasty enough. Seemed like there was too much liquid in all those toppings. It tasted good but the bun got soggy real quick. Speaking of buns, you have a choice here! White or Wheat? And for my non-red-meat consuming friends, you can sub your beef patty with a turkey one. If you have a french-fry obsession like myself, you will love Islands unlimited french fries. The first batch that comes with your burger is relatively big. But the additional orders get smaller as you continue ordering. I believe they hand-cut their fries here. Think along the taste of In-n-Out fries with a thicker cut and longer fry.

My brother's friend had his heart set on the tortilla soup here. The hike started and ended with a tortilla soup discussion. In total, I can imagine we spent at least 30 minutes discussing this tortilla soup so my brother and I shared a bottomless one. I don't think that's allowed... but if you do share try to be stealthy about it and don't ask for a second spoon? All in all the tortilla soup was the star of the evening. It doesn't have that processed pre-packaged soup taste (but for all I know it might be). It has a homemade quality to it. It's really very delicious with little strings of melted cheese. If I come here again I'll probably skip the burgers and go all-in on that unlimited soup.

Also noteworthy is the Longboard beer. It's served ice ice ice cold. Tiny little icicles form on the top. It would probably be more refreshing on a hot day but it was still enjoyable after that freezing a** hike.",AL4hosjTZzsLt99egmBszA,4,1,3,a8_982CUKEKI_2q9RdNYoA

5167122,2007-11-26,1,SycXTaA4MeJZuDK4Y1owDQ,"How would you like to put your mouth over the best burgers in town.  Yes.  I said it.  It's the best burgers I've had in such a long time.  This beats Red Robbin, In&Out, and the small mom and pop shop burgers I've had in my entire life.

Last night, mom and my step-dad decided to take the family out for dinner.  Instead of going to a buffet or a Mexican Restaurant in a casino like we normally do I suggested this spot since we had a variety of ages in our group.  There were 10 of us so I was hoping to get a huge table for all of us to fit in.  We were unlucky since the table they suggested fit nine.  ""Oh hell naw!  I want some elbow room dammit!!!""  I looked at their restaurant lay out on the hostess's desk and noticed there was two open tables side by side.  I pointed it out to the hostess and said that would be fine.  So, we had the kiddy table of 5 and adult table of 5.  It definitely worked out well.

Looking around at the restaurant, the whole theme was definitely Hawaiian.  There were Bamboo huts and the lighting had a red and yellow feel to it.  I guess it almost felt like I was in a setting of a sunset/sunrise beach waterfront.  The good thing is that it was clean, the host persons were nice, and our server was also helpful.  He knew his menu very well and gave suggestions quickly.  The seats were very comfortable and each booth can comfortably seat 6.  Unless you get a bigger table that can seat 9.  The decorations clearly gave a distinct sense of being in a restaurant shack in Hawaii where all the tourists would probably go to order some burgers and fries.

Now, two thumbs up for awesome service and mad patience with all of us since we took a short minute to order.  Plus my cousin gave back the Passion Ice Tea and had the server replace it for Strawberry Lemonade.  For appetizers, we ordered TORTILLA CHIPS & SALSA which was bland.  I wouldn't recommend this since it was boring.  We also ordered SPINACH ARTICHOKE DIPChopped spinach and artichoke hearts mixed w/ sauted onion & garlic in a creamy
alfredo sauce served w/ fresh chips and salsa.  This was just okay too.  Just be careful because it's really hot when they place it on the table.  Give it time to breath and cool down before dipping in to it.  Another appetizer we ordered were CHEDDAR FRIES Islands fries w/melted cheddar & scallions.  This we scarfed down.  I wasn't sure if it was just out of starvation before we got it but I thought it was pretty good.  

Yes, the moment of truth... BURGERS!!!!  I was so excited my mouth was definitely salivating.  The burger I chose to eat last night was HAWAIIAN - Pineapple, teriyaki sauce, lettuce, tomato, onion, swiss & mayo.  But, I had them grill the onions and added the seasoned onion strings to top it off.  I know there's already enough flavors to it but what can I say.  My eyes got bigger than my mouth and stomach.  The flavors combined were just magical, the onions with the pineapple, teriyaki sauce all just danced on my tongue.  I am so amazed with this burger I would come back by myself just to order it over and over again.  As for my cousins, they ordered the MAUI - Guacamole, lettuce, tomato, swiss & mayo which was also good.  But, I think because my burger had an overpowering mixture of flavors anything else couldn't beat it.  The other burger that was also good was the HULA - Sauted mushrooms, lettuce, tomato, swiss & mayo.  This burger was pretty good if you like mushrooms.  

What did we learn today?  
Host persons were helpful and friendly.
Servers were very prompt and quick to make suggestions.
Restaurant was clean.

My daughter had a chicken sandwich and it appeared some parts of the chicken were not cooked all he way. I rarely give two stars but not a good dining experience at all.

I enjoyed the amusement of surfing and other adventurous videos displayed from a variety of angles in the restaurant. The entertainment was a conversation focal point while we waited for milkshakes to be served. 

The children's menu hosts a variety of choices. Sweet potato fries, buttered noodles, applesauce, and broccoli florets are four we can depend on for busy fingers and hungry stomachs. As always, I hope restaurant's like Islands will make the choices ORGANIC but I am at least grateful for the variety and fresh options.

The service was quick and attentive. The server ensured my turkey burger could be wrapped in lettuce to eliminate the bun. I made the request and the chef delivered. The timeliness of service was efficient. The smiles and patience were abundant.",ssgRnGGXxigWTEXM-n92lg,0,1,4,4yl1MZ9s3hV2IC5ymmOdIg

Burgers:
=======
My fav burgers are the: Hula (sauteed mushroooms), Hawaiian (pineapple, teriyaki), and the Point Break (Gruyère & bleu cheeses, caramelized bacon & onion relish). About 12 kinds to choose from, all burgers can be made with beef, turkey, or veggie.  Price ~ $10.50, but carb heaven --- fries (all you can eat come with each burger!). 

Salads/more:
==========
The salads are large, the nachos are a monster (and great), and I also like the soft tacos with chicken (a lot!).

Desserts:
=======
Kona pie is one of the best things in the world.  Mocha almond fudge ice cream, oreo cookie crust, topped w/chocolate fudge, whipped cream.  C'mon now!  Seriously, just pop in for one of these things (and don't share!).

Happy Hour:
==========
Served 4pm-7pm, Monday-Friday --- with good options!  Chips/salsa ($1, made fresh, thin, and served warm), cheese quesadilla ($2.95), 4 sliders ($3.95), among other items. Drinks featured: drafts ($2.95-$3.95), wines ($3.95), and mixed drinks ($4.25).

What's unique about this location?:
