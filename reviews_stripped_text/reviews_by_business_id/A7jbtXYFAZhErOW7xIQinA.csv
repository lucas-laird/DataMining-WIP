I'm Korean and the only thing that matters to me is good tasting food and banchan. Service doesn't matter. I got kalbi tang (overpriced at $15 when it's worth 8-10$) and the broth was so bland, there was not much substance to the soup- just 3 pieces of meat, 3 leeks, couple thin slivers of egg, and some noodles. Worst kalbi tang I've ever had (comparing this to Seattle and LA). We also got he budae jigae (overpriced at $44 when it's only worth 28-35$) it was ""ok"" not as flavorful as I expected.",vHjQmrA6zChHPWzS1ChmQw,0,0,1,3hSIx30P1SpddLHnzZdqzA

Mothers Korean Grill is the definition of high-class, lavish Asian cuisine, and for those of you looking for the ultimate food experience, look no further.

The restaurant is clean to the point of operating room-sterility, with a modern and fresh atmosphere.  With open space to spare, claustrophobics flock to a place like this.  

The staff is subservient to the point of Philippino megamall department store clerks and there is no inkling of doubt that the customer is their #1 focus.  It's easy to see the owner has taken great measures to ensure her team works together to provide best-in-class service.

Galbi, Bulgogi, Joomurlk, Japchae, you name it, this place wont let you down with it's options.  

High-class, lavish, flavorful, clean, subservient, fun.  GO HERE NOW!!!!

our waitress was very attentive. she brought out more panchan for us when we needed it and cooked a good amount of our food for us. they were pretty busy for a sunday afternoon! the paemul was definitely too much for us, and i unfortunately thought it was a bit too thick.

We decide on Korean BBQ, we then go thru our memory banks of good Korean BBQ we have had in our lives and that boy MP can eat him some KBBQ.  I also pride myself in the same manner.  So we go on the Yelp and catch a couple reviews on Mothers Korean Grill.
We thought WHY NOT!?!?, Yelpers dont lets us down....I was sadly mistaken...read on....

2 Stars - Dont want to bore you with details so lemme break it down...

We do this one FOOD/SERVICE/PRICES - If you are industry, nuff said...

FOOD - Nothing particularly special at all, salad was regular (easy on the vinegar chef!!!), the KIMCHEE was not that good (A little too fonkay), and to top it off....the meat was not that good.

YES LET ME SAY THIS AGAIN........
THE MEAT WAS NOT THAT GOOD..........now before I get challenges from all over LV, ima killit right now......if you want to eat my opinion of good KBBQ hit me up privately and ill give you a couple places in Los Angeles KOREATOWN that would make this place close down DUE TO SHAME!!!
Not good at all, NOTHING WAS MEMORABLE OR DELICIOUS.
2 STAR

SERVICE - This was OK.  Nothing great but nothing terrible.
3 STARS

PRICE - This was actually worse than the food...lol.....waaaaay tooooo expensive.  Im not a cheap bastard (Word to BIG BIRD) so its not that but rather.....YOU WANT VALUE FOR WHAT YOU PAY FOR........I felt no value for what I was paying.  If it wasnt for the company I was with it would of been a shitty dinner (Whats next on deck?)

When we came back to dinner the waitress informed us there was two AYCE eat prices. For an extra $6 you can get Galbi and another meat. We thought for an extra $6 that it would be worth it. Unfortunately we were dupped the extra meat was only for one serving per person and not AYCE. The serving portion they brought out were children portions. They brought us $2 extra in meat while we paid an extra $36. 

Also they tried to rip us off on soup. They said you get one soup per two indiviuals. We had 6 people and we had to fight them for the third soup. 

I don't really expect great service at asian resteraunts, but if I ask for a refill and they say ok I expect to get a refill. Also if I ask for six dipping sauces I expect to get six dipping sauces not one. 

Pros: Nice Decor since they rip the customer off

Cons: Bad Service, Overpriced, Small portions, Uncomfortable seats, Not for Large Groups, meat was barely marinated,

We don't mind the hefty price tag of $15.95 for a bowl of beef and vegetables over rice.  Korean food, like Indian food, is always a bit pricey in our foodie experiences.  But what they served us today was the saddest, skimpiest dolsot bibimbap we've ever seen.  There was barely anything in it!  I mean trace amounts of beef and vegetables.  I wish I had taken a picture of it but it was a late lunch and we were so hungry.  $15.95 for this?!  It should have been more like $2.95!
The waitress's grimace when I told her I was not Korean made my husband and I wonder over our lunch if our experience would have been better if I was.
The 2 men who sat across from us were brave enough to tell the waitress that the food presented to them didn't look anything like the picture posted outside of the restaurant and walked out!  I don't know if I could ever do that, but good for them!
By then we were the only patrons left and never saw our waitress until my husband walked out of the restaurant to start the A/C in the car for baby and she hurried over with the check and asked for the first time if we would like some more water.  Too late, lady!  We're ready to end this disappointing and overpriced lunch.
I don't recommend this place anymore and don't plan on ever returning.  They totally bombed on service, food, and value.  You get this feeling like they just don't care!  About anything!  Wish I had noticed the recent negative Yelp reviews and tips before coming.  Time to look for a better Korean restaurant on Yelp!",xQDRytksJkMPErWHvC1xjA,2,0,1,4lf_BznNBbT914qxHAfY3g

My husband&I found this place a couple of months ago when we were looking to try something new.since my husband loves meat, we went for the korean bbq.The first time we dined there, I wasn't really impressed with the food quality..all i was having where the side dishes..but it was a new experience so I was excited that I put korean bbq on my list of ""tried cuisines"".After a couple of months, we gave this place another try-unfortunately the experience wasn't better..service is horrible, food quality less than mediocre, not enough flavour..During our  second visit to this place, we found this tofu soup that we liked..it was spicy, soft and warm so after that, my husband would have lunch there just for the soup , also inviting his friends along.
Yesterday, after an amazing day at the Red Rock Canyon, our friends told us that they would like to try something completely new, a dish they never had before..after a couple other ideas, they chose koreean bbq..so that's how we got back to this place /I should ve just tried another bbq place A LONG TIME AGO/.We sat at the table, were having a good time/because of the company, not the service/, tried the beef on the bbq and then asked for some chicken and brisket and refill on the lettuce salad..we got a refill alright-when the waitress brings the bowl with salad, I serve my friend first and then my husband, then I got some ..and as soon as I put the bowl on the table, I see a  moving COCKROACH IN MY FRIENDS PLATE!!!!! This is where the panic started, she took the plate, droped the insect on floor, I got scared. .felt like there were insects on the table, under the table, in the salad we had before, the meat we had..OMG...during all this commotion, I see a waiter coming asking what's going on..I was like..well, this cockroach that's on the floor now, was in the salad u just brought from the kitchen..he says ..oh no, no, they come from inside the grill..i saw one the other day on a wall, WHAAT? U SAW ONE BEFORE  in this restaurant and did nothing about it???? He was trying to make it better by assuring us  that the cockroach in the plate was not from the salad, but from the grill we cook the meat...HOW IS THIS BETTER? Then he starts to argue with us and just digging a dipper whole for himself and then asks""anyway, what can I do for u?""..implying the cost of the food..I was mortified. ..I didn't come here to scam u of your ""delicious&precious"" food..I came here to eat, drink, have fun with my friends&family and ended up blushing in front of everybody because I mentioned this place and oh..minor detail..UNWANTED INSECTS ON THE PLATE!! Do you really think that I am loocking for a discount?? My friend /in which we found the insect /was about to throw up and I took her outside during which my husband and the other friend were dealing with an incompetent owner saying that""oh, it's ok, it's nothing to worry about , in Korea this is normal, we eat cockroaches all the time in our food""..WHAAAT?? I don't mind other ppl eating ""bizzare foods""...but I did not ask for a cockroach in my food.
I called the Southern Nevada Health dept. and I hope that something will be done about this place ..as for my guests&I, we'r scared for a long time..it's going to take a while to get back on track.",NcUcarcROY3j63ZESC4ruQ,6,1,1,QlRhqkInsWpSmlc8DAeZmw

For me, Yuk Gye Jang  is the most inconsistently prepared dish and I like to use it as my Korean litmus test (I use chili rellenos for Mexican). They make a spectacular Yuk Gye Jang, easily the best I've had in the U.S. and better than most of what you can get in Korea.

The Hae Mul Pa Jun  was the best I've had in a decade. Most will have too much batter and turn out on the mushy side. They had the perfect balance such that there was just enough batter to hold together and cooked perfectly to provide a nice, lightly crisp texture around the fringe. A little soy sauce for dipping and BAM, you're in Hae Mul  heaven.

However, when the word grill is added, I automatically think BBQ and will try it. The only reason I ended up here was from an invite from Victor A. I am glad I went, even though I had already eaten a little bit before, I was still interested in trying some things. 

I ate some of the pork belly which was surprisingly good! It was probably my favorite thing out of everything I tried. Those I was with were salivating over the eel, but that was way to exotic for me. However, for those who do like it, apparently it was super good. 

I liked this dressing that we had. Apparently you were suppose to use it for the salad, or at least I think that is what your suppose to use it for, but I dipped my rice in it and it was super good! I want to know what that sauce/dressing was! I would eat that on salad everyday! 

A lot of the things I tasted were a bit too spicy for me. I did think the egg souffle we got was pretty tasty, but very slimy. It was a steamed egg, never seen that before so it was pretty cool. 

I really enjoyed the decor of the place. It was very ""motherly"" and beautiful. 

I probably would not go back unless invited again, because it is pretty expensive, but I was very appreciative of being invited this time because I can now say I tried it! :) 

I also was slightly embarrassed because me and chopsticks do not coordinate well. I was trying the whole time to use them because I did not want to be the lame one using a fork, so I learned a little bit, but still not an expert, not even close. In my defense it was a lot harder to use because they were metal chopsticks.

1) Their sign said 9.95,nothing was 9.95, the least priced items were 12.95, MISLEADING!
The service was ok (a few ladies were nice) but Mother(?) the older lady was not nice, as soon as she finds out we were not Koreans, and we were not ordering enough food, she moved us to a table, smaller, further location. 
2) The Bibimba was supposed to come with meat.... this older Mother(?) came, took the bowl, brought it back with tiny little meat... saying ""Here we go""...
Even my usually a ""very patient daughter"" was angry.... very rude, no word of apology, etc.  It may even have been intentional. (that's the kind of treatment we received from this older ""Mother?"" lady.

1208703,2009-06-19,0,A7jbtXYFAZhErOW7xIQinA,"Attention all readers- the rating was originally 4 stars but now has been lowered to 3 (only because I can't do 2.5). Here's why...

My husband has been stationed in S. Korea twice already (getting ready for a third time). I have been fortunate enough to visit him while he has been there and will again this 3rd time around. As a result of our Korean experiences we LOVE Korean food. Upon moving here, we asked around and was told Mother's was the place to go. 

We went ... and we love the food... the first few times. However, our most recent visit (a week ago) may very well be our last.

I usually order the bulgogi (my fav) and my husband has the bi bim bop (his fav). Our past experiences at Mothers were great- both dishes were always delicious and worth the price for the most part (see part about the lettuce charge)!  I was extremely happy that Mother's also had my favorite Korean beverage, beksaju. The side dishes had always been amazing and the server continously replenished a dish that went empty. 

However, during our last visit, I noticed immediately that the price of the bulgogi had increased to $24 for one person. Also, the bakseju had increased from $6 to $14. These bottles are pintsize in the first place and sale for only $3 at the nearby Chinese/Korean Grocery market down the street (near DKJ). 

Therefore, due to the increased price for my favorite dish, both my husband and I ordered the dolsot bibimbap. Another reason why I didn't order the bulgogi- past experience had been that we were charged $6 for the lettuce to eat with my bulgogi. Frankly to me, this was a rip-off. Bulgogi is supposed to be served with lettuce or spearmint leaves. The fact that I had to ask for it and then get charged was ridiculous. Another saddening thing- there were only 3 side dishes instead of the customary 5-6. When the food was finished, the side dishes were left empty.  

Both of us have felt that the quality and quantity of what you get has decreased while the price of what you pay has only gone up. Bad idea, especially given this economy that we live it. As a result, we will be very hesitant to recommend this place to anyone and will probably never go back ourselves.",KBrv0-tU2YlDJPOD_BTjcw,1,0,3,dOGTOp8OY8dnKdn78cqpXw

The place has a very sleek design and was overall very clean. 
We came in with a group of 6 on a weekday afternoon and were seated promptly.. not a lot of people in the restaurant. The  main reason we came was because someone wanted bibimbap and this was the closest place so we all said heck why not. However, after one look at the menu, we all noticed how overpriced everything was. I don't exactly remember the price of the bibimbap but it was enough to make me gawk. The rest of us ordered galbi which was tasty.. but the portions did not match the price. Their banchan however included a wide variety and were quite tasty. Service was alright. 

Overall, might want to avoid this place if you're looking for korean food.

On Wednesday night, a few of us couples headed on over to this place for a date night meal.  When we walked in, we were seated right away, however it's summer in Vegas and even before they turned on our grill it was scorching hot in there.  

A waitress comes over and we start to order, after placing two orders of five, all of a sudden without warning or a word said, the waitress just walks away from our table.  WTF???

Then, another waitress walks over and we tell her what just happens and she says, ""Oh, she's new.""  As if that somehow excuses that sort of behavior.  Then, she proceeds to take our order and tells us, even though there are five of us, we can only order two items at a time.  Bullsh&t.  The menu said four items at a time and I quickly told her, ""Nope, sorry, two isn't enough...we want four like the menu says."" At which time she says ok and proceeds to take our order.

Then, when she comes back with our drinks, all of a sudden, the two drinks we had previously ordered from the runaway waitress appear.  She's confused, we're confused...it's all confusing.

Then the food starts coming out.  The first round we ordered was great and we proceed to enjoy that round.  However, on the second round of meat we ordered, we ordered pork, but it should've been called pork fat, because that's all it was, fat.  How they even had the face to serve such a mess, I'll never know.  We ended up leaving it there, because it was inedible.  

During the second round of meat we also ordered a refill of salad and of the pancakes.  The salad never came even though we asked for it two additional times.  And for the pancakes, though they are open supposedly until 2am, at 9:30pm they ran out.

The bill came and it was approx. $40 a person with tax and drinks.  

I have never been to a restaurant with such poor service and attention to detail.  Eating out is supposed to be a pleasure and an opportunity to relax and enjoy, not a hassle like our experience here was.

My cousins and I (Six of us) had ordered four dishes amongst ourselves whereas the parents ordered their share for themselves. We ordered the seafood pancake, rice cake, the tofu soup, and the bibimbap. The waitress taking our order asked us if it was for the six of us and we said yes. She laughed and walked away. Ok rude. We didn't order more because the prices on the menu were outrageously expensive. $20 for seafood pancake? BYE. We were desperate for food so we came here. It was Christmas and a lot of restaurants weren't opened. 

The banchan comes out and the six of us are sharing four banchans whereas the adults were sharing more. Didn't mind that. My mom asked if we could get more but they said they charge extra for more banchan. I've never been to a Korean restaurant where they charge extra for banchan. Koreans are usually very generous when it comes to side dishes. Super disappointed. I later realized all the banchan were different so they had only gave us one set of banchan for 13 people. 

When food was coming out, we told the waitress that the food belongs the side with the older adults. We did this twice and she rudely exclaimed ""What DID you guys order?"". What kind of service is this? 

FOOD:
Bibimbap was flavorless. Rice was mushy and there was no sauce at all. It was expensive for just regular bibimbap. We didn't want to get the dolsot bc it was expensive like we mentioned before. 

The soup was your typical soup but it was $13. lmao I don't even know how they still have business. They took away our extra bowls bc the soup is one portion but we were all sharing it and she knew that too... She had a rude tone about it. 

The rice cake was alright but not worth the buck. 
Seafood pancake wasn't bad but I would not pay $20 for that.

The RICE CAKE SOUP was alright. I really wished there was more flavor to it, but the portion was a lot and I couldn't finish it all (they really filled that broth up with the ingredients). The rice cakes were the perfect, chewy texture - not too thick or thin. The dumplings were well-made although I had to eat them fast because the dumplings wraps kept tearing easily. 

In the end, I probably wouldn't order the RICE CAKE SOUP again. My sister has made it before and she did tell me it's not suppose to have a lot of flavor, that it's suppose to have a mild taste to it, but I prefer her homemade soup to this one. 

The restaurant service was pretty good. We received our side dishes; we had to get their attention quite a bit to ask them to refill some side dishes though. They also supplied us with water (we had a water bottle off on the side, but they refilled that too when it was empty).

Yet I've often wondered what if moms was a super cook?
I think I've found my surrogate cooking mom.

Mother's is located in Las Vegas' Chinatown.
It's a modern and spacious restaurant which kinda threw me off since I'm use to Korean joints that are a little more cramped: Toyose and Shin Toe Bul Yi.

The Galbi and Bulgogi were good cuts of marinated meat with just enough fat to give it some flavor.  Tasty.
The sides were a bit on the tame side as my search for dried anchovies was to no avail.
According to the wife, the bibimbap was only okay.

The service was excellent.  Korean BBQ at your table means you cook it yourself.  Not here.  I don't know if it's standard practice to help the customer with the cooking or if they could tell we were too inept or thought they would be liable if we got burnt or afraid we may cause a fire.  Whatever the reason I think I liked it.
They also suggested which flavors of Soju we might enjoy -- and where to buy some more after we left.

The only thing about this restaurant is it's pricey.  I know Korean places that charge less for an all you-can-eat buffet than what this place charge for their entrees.
But if you're in the mood for some good Korean BBQ at 3:45 in the morning, I couldn't recommend a better place.

It was the best decision, and everyone LOVED it. Many of our guests are still raving about how good the food and service was.

My maid of honor later told me that she requested champagne for our toasts, but as they are quite authentic and only serve Korean drinks, they did not have it, so the waiter INSISTED on sending a fellow staff member to the store to buy it! My MOH told them not to worry, but they insisted!! Now that is dedication to customer service!! 

The room was beautifully decorated and easily accommodated our party of 20 people. The servers were so friendly and made sure to explain each course with us (as we didn't order from the menu since we had a large party). The owner even came in to greet and welcome us!! Seriously, we were treated like family.

FINALLY, The food... ooh the food!! DELICIOUS and super duper yummy!!! I honestly ate entirely too much, but I could not stop myself because it was so good. I loved sampling everything.

2500824,2008-03-09,1,A7jbtXYFAZhErOW7xIQinA,"""You are either with us or against us"". When president Bush made that moronic statement it polarized people, and when the manager at San Toki Korean BBQ next to the Hard Rock made this statement ""We have the best Korean chef in Las Vegas"" he polarized me. He made that statement after I had told him ""this is the worst Korean BBQ I've had"", and now I'm on a mission  to find the best Korean BBQ in Las Vegas because I know San Toki definitely wasn't the best. It didn't even come close.

After all 3 of us piled comfortably in to my 2 seater we were headed off to find MOTHERS, but our initial start was met with retardedism (new word)  because we ended up at Garden Korean BBQ up the street which almost threw off my quest, but that was corrected when we asked the waitress where Mothers was, and she accidentally slipped and told us down the street, so we piled back in, and off we went.... we should have left a tip (my tip, don't send customers to your competitor..haha).

Mothers is located in a huge complex with several restaurants, but they're positioned approximately in the middle of the complex on the first floor.

Unlike San Toki which gives you a whopping 3 side dishes (5.95 for refills), Mothers gives you the typical onslaught of 10-12 varying dishes which were all decent, and they had no problem in refilling them either. 

The meat quality especailly the Galbi was by far several times better than San Toki. Mothers also didn't bother cutting the meat up into tiny little squares like San Toki's idiotic presentation. The second dish was my favorite hyemit gui which is sliced beef tongue... yumm when cooked rare. Even the portions were a lot larger than the tiny portions of San Toki and it has nothing to do with quantity over quality because Mothers is still a lot better in regards to taste too.

Service! The younger guy wasn't the best, but the older lady was somewhat attentive. She also made small talk, and asked how are meal was when were on our way out. 

Mothers is substantially a lot better than San Toki, and I'm definitely going to have to try the place out again.",zVldd49Xt6AUFWso0oY8hA,1,2,3,hr70_QiW4vhj_10aJRSM2w

Mother's Korean Grill is my favorite Korean restaurant in Las Vegas.  It is pricey, but well worth the price if you get the right things.  I have never eaten all you can eat here, only a la carte.  If you would like your food to be cooked in front of you, you need to order 2 meat dishes.  I suggest table cooking over kitchen cooking. The side dishes and salad are always great!

The absolute best meat you can get here is yangnyum kalbi.  Pretty steep price $35 for two slabs of meat.  However, it is amazing....tender, melts in your mouth, and seasoned just right.  This is a must try for everyone.

Last night, we got the kimchi jjigae.  This is a kimchi soup with cabbage kimchi, tofu, and pork cooked in a stone bowl.  It was delicious, just like my mom's.  It it pretty spicy.  My only complaint, needed more pork in the dish.

We also got Dwaejibulgogi (pork bulgogi).  Over previous visits, I was not too fond of the way they seasoned their dwaejibulgogi, so I usually get the regular beef bulgogi (which by the way is great.)

I decided to go off book today given the scorching temperatures outside and opted for the Korean cold noodles known as bibim naeng-myun at Mother's, located in the massive strip mall that houses Ranch 99 and various other good eats.

There is definitely a serene ambience as one walks into this zen-like oasis in the desert where the clientele is definitely more old school so I would definitely take a fellow colleague here if I wanted to do a power business lunch or catch up with an old friend over quiet conversation.  The staff is polite but not overreaching, and classical music plays overhhead rather than tv monitors blaring hypermanic Asian pop music.  

The meal began with some tasty banchan, and the selection was a nice balance of sweet, spicy, and tart....much like the imminent  pièce de résistance.   Upon presentation of the bibim naeng-myun, a little rack consisting of squirt bottles of vinegar and hot mustard was placed to the side for additional flavoring.  There's a fine line between genius and insane, and the concept and look of this dish tiptoes that line beautifully.  Who would have thought to take resilient translucent sweet-potato starch noodles, place them in a cold broth with crushed ice (!), serve alongside thin slices of beef, julienned cucumbers and pickled radish, throw in some asian pear slices,  add some sweet/spicy chili paste and place a hard-boiled egg on top of it all?

The sesame oil/salt/chili powder sauce they gave was pretty good though. The bulgogi was all right but also kind of overpriced, like around $26 or so. Service is pretty much non-existent once you get your food.",taPq7IxYskEWH7Vfc261pQ,2,0,3,qc0t9apRkdam8t_qNF5Y5A

2955594,2012-05-20,1,A7jbtXYFAZhErOW7xIQinA,"It's a shame to see so much of traditional Korean food being boggled down by all the AYCE offers these days. Mother's has no AYCE, and quite frankly I hope they don't include it. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE AYCE, but I'm starting to notice a trend where ""Korean food"" is equating to nothing more than ""eat limitless B.B.Q."" This is one of the few places to experience a traditional Korean dish. Before you shout, ""No AYCE? Nevar!!"", let me explain:

When you walk in, the atmosphere is immediately different; cozy interior decorating, soft classical music playing in the background, and a overall relaxed feel. So much of Korean B.B.Q. these days have a fiery atmosphere with the clink and clank of soju shot glasses, Girls Generation songs blasting in the background, bickering and laughing everywhere. It was nice to see a change. In fact, it seems like the perfect venue to pitch a business idea, meet a relative, or bring a out-of-town friend and catch up on old times. The open grills have the ventilations installed so you don't have to worry about smelly B.B.Q. wafting around the room.

On to the bigger question: how's the food? I had the kalbi naegnyum (cold buckwheat noodle) dish, and wow it blew me away. I'd say the naegnyum is better than Sandai's, which was my favorite prior to eating at Mother's. The kalbi is great, although the portion is pretty small. But to make up for it, the banchan at Mother's is second to none.

Everything tastes so fresh and right at home. The portions for banchan is huge. Traditionally, this is the way Korean food should be served. I know banchan has taken a major backstep in the AYCE scene, heck, even I don't eat a lot of banchan when I'm at a AYCE. But Mother's is different. The banchan deserves more credit than it receives.

It's hard to place where Mother's fits in the overly crowded Korean restaurants in Vegas. I'd say it's experiential dining. I mean for a Korean restaurant to be bold and just stick to the roots, it's hard to not give them five stars. This is as close as I felt to home. For small instances inside the restaurant I felt like I was back in Seoul, enjoying a ice-cold naegnyum dish at my grandma's restaurant.",De-dImXf-TOFWWPTUWwIvw,2,0,5,llcjlEV9qG7JFz3B1Rqmbg

This place is in a strip mall, but the interior decoration is nice and would be appropriate for a nice occasion.  The parking lot is huge but is very busy since it shares with many other businesses. 

I went here for a light lunch and did not do the Korean BBQ, which may be a completely different story.  I had the yukkejang, bibimbap and sundubu... that is what we collectively ordered.

I thought all the above were acceptable... if not a little bit standard.  For a place called Mother's I expected a little better.  The panjan (side dishes) though plentiful and decent were nothing to rave over either.

This may be a little cheap of me to say, but I think that $12.95 is too much for Yukkejang... unless it is mind blowing.  Ditto for the sundubu and bibimpap (I think they were around $11.95).  Maybe the ingredients just cost more to ship to LV.

In case you are interested in the BBQ, know that it runs $25 - $30 per meat order and I am not sure that meat would be up to snuff.

First of all, they have raised their prices significantly...you know, one of those really subtle price-change strips down the side of the menu so there can be no doubt in your mind that you are paying more. With all the extra money they're now making, you'd think they could spring for a newly-printed menu. Not to mention that raising prices is a bad pychological move in this economy. 

They have no wine list that I could see, and only 2 Korean beers. We ordered beer, but the waitress forgot . So after we dove in to the Kimchee sides and our tongues felt like we were fire-eaters, I had to chase her down to bring the beer to mitigate the mouth-heat. Lots of apologies followed. (Too late girls.)

My group ordered the 4 beef-combination plate for 3 people at $75. The beef was kinda gray and measly. It tasted fine once it was barbecued, but it was not high-quality meat. (Here's another tip: if bringing raw meat to the table is part of the dining experience, make sure the meat looks really good cuz people are going to look at it!)

The place is open 24 hours, not that I ever have a craving for beef at 5 in the morning, but all in all, I think it's time to explore some of the Korean restaurants elsewhere in town.

I was mad and told him we have been waiting here first, he refused to say anything and said no, they told me first but then my bf had to step in and say we told 3 servers we needed a table and these men just got in! The manager gave up and said something (probably swear word) in korean and just pointed at the empty table and walked away. So we sit down wait another 5 minutes, no water no menu no nothing, once again i waived servers down only to have them say ""not now"" or wave their fingers now.

The meat came on a big platter with the meat arranged very nicely in a bed of vegetables and lettuce. Also, the server actually does all of the cooking and serving of the meat to each person.  I also ordered the vegetarian hot tofu soup, which was very good. 

Overall, this is a very good Korean restaurant. Their menu is varied enough for everyone's taste whether it's BBQ, hot pot, or just a good bowl of Korean Tofu, which is my favorite. On top of that, the place is very clean and the service is excellent.

The place is nice, and the service was good. Our waiter was really cool about letting us know what everything was, what it should taste like, comparing it to other things... all that good stuff. He was a good dude. 

The rub of it is that though the service was top notch, I'm not sure the food was. See, I went there based on Misti's enthusiastic review of the eel. Let me tell you: the eel was really, REALLY good. I would go back there JUST based on the eel (if I had another Yelp deal). It costs something like $21, which is kinda steep. 

We also ordered the pork belly, which was around $25, and also pretty good. The portions, however, were not so generous. You get three slabs of it, which is probably good for two not-that-hungry people.

So naturally, my family enjoys Korean food. Upon moving to Las Vegas, we found the Koreatown district and became enamored with this place.

We love the hours here, especially during our late night party binges. We refer to the owner as Ama (Mom in Korean), because she treated us like family. Service was impeccable, never a messed up order. And always offers a helping hand when we order takeout.

Prices here hover between moderate and pricey but they are well worth the extra buck.

The food (according to our Korean born eating companion) is the closest tasting to her hometown fare. The Tofu Kim Chee (te-COONG-she-geh) soup is very flavorful and possesses a medium heat. The marinated ribeye is freakin awesome with a slightly sweet twang. I recommend both with high regard.

  1. Mother's Grill
  2. Dae Jang Keum Korean BBQ
  3. Korean Garden BBQ
  4. Honey Pig
  5. Shilla Korean BBQ

not to mistake this place with the best in atmosphere, ventillation, service, etc...  and here's why:

LAYOUT
Mother's Grill is spacious, clean and the decor is satisfying.^^  you'll find the typical wooden tables, booths and ventillation fans above grills throughout the restaurant.  the seating is comfortable anywhere you sit and there are private rooms in the back for large parties.

the only CON i can think of is the ventillation can be poor.?  i think this is a common problem if you do a BBQ indoors (you leave smelling greasy), but Dae Jang Keum Korean BBQ actually doesnt suffer from it.

SERVICE
is prompt and the servers attentive to cooking your food and your needs.  this is probably because i've never seen Mother's Grill packed at any time of the day (2pm OR 2am).   tho, i don't think being ""crowded"" detracts from ""tasty"" food anyways...  in retrospect, i think the fact that it stays open late (2am) and is not crowded is a win-win situation for getting the delicious foods to you.^^

special note: Mother's offers a discount to Military personal.  i think it's around 15%.^^

FOOD
Mother's Grill has, IMHO, the best tasting meat dishes when you are looking for Korean BBQ.   i've always found their meats WELL marinated as opposed to many of the above mentioned restaurants.   additionally, their serving of SALAD is excellant and flavorful...  i don't know why some places don't understand how tasty meat dishes are when they are wrapped in savory salads.

i've never had anything else off the menu besides the BBQ meats so i can't really justify a 5-star rating...  but we're talking Korean BBQ here.^^

PRICING
i must admit, for how uncrowded this place can be, Mother's Grill is a TAD pricier then normal by $2-$3 vS. other establishements.    i personally don't mind...  i know i'm paying for a VERY good meal.^^

CLOSING
underrated and overlooked...  i am dumb-founded as to why i'm not waiting in line to eat here everytime i go.   but if you want to understand just how good Mother's Grill is, then try ordering the Short Ribs in special sauce (a basic dish every Korean BBQ has)...  then eat it with their salad.   after this, goto any other Korean BBQ and repeat.   i think you'll understand what i'm saying then.^^

Recommendation:
1. all their BBQ meats - especially their Short Ribs.!
2. setup a conveyor belt for the Salad - cause it's FREE.!!

AVOID ordering the BBQ shrimp.  you're buying 8 shrimps for $24 if i recall correctly.   not that it's not good - it's just dumb.^^",nxtqjMAPbIyJT2-0rYFUbA,1,1,5,lhXWLqOMdK50Ju9XYRalmg
4615535,2011-09-14,2,A7jbtXYFAZhErOW7xIQinA,"I was excited to try this place because it's one of the very few Korean restaurants I HADN'T tried in Vegas... plus some of the yelp reviews and pictures seemed promising. I went for Chuseok (Korean Thanksgiving and Moon Day), excited to eat a hearty Korean meal. 

I enjoy and appreciate variety on the table... I never turn down the option of ordering an appetizer or two, and love to split/share entrees. If we were to do this... we would've spent a fortune. I searched for the lunch specials and traditional stews were $9.95 and higher. These prices are standard dinner prices... so I was very disappointed in the menu. No real appetizer menu (dumplings, Korean-style pancake that's NOT $15!, etc..), my favorite stews regular price are $12.95+... these are not the norm for Korean food at all... the only dishes I can understand being more expensive than what people are used to are the table BBQ options. 

I told my boyfriend that if the stew is phenomenal, I will stop complaining about the prices. Unfortunately, it really wasn't :-/. The soon tofu jjigae (ordered to be as spicy as humanly possible) was pretty mild and not of great flavor... certainly not what I'm used to in NYC or LA. I will continue to go to Tofu Hut or DJK for this dish. The Dolsot Bibimbap was pretty typical.. and only 3 side dishes!! I take pride in Korean culture and restaurants offering such great, abundant variety of unlimited side dishes! It was lunchtime; however, still way too limited on variety and not generous with portions. 

On a brighter note, good location on Spring Mountain.. service was friendly, polite, and attentive... and if you're NOT Korean, there's a good chance you will love the food :)",WpZTKVU09--Fb2qFneqkZg,2,0,2,3Exyh9S7RqTWQuAq54GpbA

I would say that each dish by itself could serve a person and a half so my party ended up ordering only two dishes, while devouring the side dishes that accompany the Korean BBQ meals.  Prices for the assortment of beefs were quite exorbitant, as well as bowls being more than 10 dollars!  I'm the type of person that is used to all you can eat Korean BBQ at $16.99!  This place is NOT at all, an all you can eat restaurant.  My friends and I ordered a Galbi beef dish to be cooked at our table ($29.99).  We also ordered the bim bim bap ($12.00) with anticipation that it would come in a clay pot bowl with the sound of crackling crispy rice at the bottom and egg yoke on top. We ended up getting bim bim bap without the clay pot!  The sauces that usually accompany the bim bim bap were set on the side, where amounts could be added to ones own discretion.  The service was nice, albeit once our side dishes were finished up they were not replenished unless we asked (I'm used to being asked or refilled automatically).

Then we ordered the Grandmother's Special.  They brought the wrong order and started grilling the wrong meat.  They ended up removing the meat from the grill when they realized their mistake.  

Once they brought the right food, every time anyone tried to cook the meat, someone came right over and took the tongs away and cooked the meat.  (No fun what-so-ever)

Atmosphere - Very clean, big and roomy restaurant. Well designed. Many of the places around Sahara Commercial Center and the older places are, well,  old.  This place is easy on the eyes for sure.

Service - Very nice attentive and helpful, especially for novice BBQ eaters. If it gets busy though,  you will need to be a bit more assertive and ask for things. 

Food - Very nice, went for the Pork and beef. All nice and subtle tasting wtih not too much overpowering spices.  Kim Chi selection was nice, but very, westernized, meaning, that there were mostly the mild type of Kim Chi. They will refill for you based on request.  Odd that they do not serve a soup with the meal.  Fire was a bit low, so things took time to cook. Overall pretty nice.

Selection - A bit more on the food. I usually order Bulgogi or Kalbi, and here they have various levels of quality of beef that I normally am not used to, so be prepared that you have choices in quality. More expensive, more quality the cut. I find, however, that proper marinade and tenderizing the meat and proper slicing make for a great meal, and I am not one to really be able to tell the great cut of meat in Korean BBQ. So, i ordered the least expensive.

Other - I will for sure go back as it is easy to get to and park, as it is in Chinatown plaza, and it is fun to stroll around the little plaza and see what else is going on. Be sure, if you are on a date, to bring some mints and gum with you. The food has a lot of garlic.....

However, if you're not into buffets, need to stay away from the strip to stop gambling, and want the option of bubble tea afterwards (there's a tea cafe next door), this is a safe 'bet'.",DkifKRPhR8l9pmfmRzmFbg,1,1,4,E7fobhA0F08FAmXLWvX1nQ

The staff was very friendly.  They keep coming by to mind the grill and they cut the meat into nice bite-sized pieces.  The place is small enough that you are never neglected for long.

They served a sauce which was sesame and sweet vinegar for it, but it was just alright. The dak bulgogi had decent chicken and the yetnal bulgogi had decent quality beef, but it wasn't marinated enough....it just had a hint of the marinate flavor that the menu described so it need to sit moreThe chap chae was good, but standard.

Service was the huge issue with the last visit. It was so bad and discriminatory that it was ridiculous. This morning, the owner was there and I didn't see the terrible service lady there. We received pretty decent service this time around. 

For the price, I don't know if I'd go here again. It's good food, but pricey for what it is.  $100 for a lunch is a bit much for BBQ that can be done easily at home.

We arrived and there was noone dining, but the sign said ""open"". So we walked in and was immediately greeted and we took our seat. We noticed how spacious it was and being open 'til 2am, wondered why there weren't anyone eating.

So everything on the menu looked pretty good. We ordered the brisket, beef tongue, bulgogi and spare ribs. The brisket and beef tongue we cooked at our table and the ribs and bulgogi were cooked in the kitchen and brought out to us. The spare ribs were my favorite followed by the brisket. 

All the food was really good, maybe cuz we were starving, but the side dishes and the order of steamed egg soup were tasty too.

Service was really friendly and attentive for us since we were the only ones dining. 

The prices are pretty expensive but not ridiculous. Food portions were ok for the price. If you're starving and want to eat tons within budget, this may not be the place.

With tax and tip, it came out to about $35each.

The place is clean and cozy, and the service was attentive and kind. Yes, our waitress made sure to oversee our BBQ, but in a mom kind of way. She wasn't mean about it!

We came here after purchasing the Yelp Deal, so we weren't quite as phased by the pricing. However, I do think that $29 for kalbi is a tad expensive for BBQ, and the serving was not more generous than usual. The price would probably prevent me from coming back regularly. The flavor was good, and the meat was quality, but I didn't think it reflected the price. 

We were excited to see brown rice on the menu, but they didn't have any. So, I am not sure if they would normally have it?

My husband did order the eel, and he thought this was a good value! Given the smile on his face, I could imagine him going back just for that. 

As for the true highlight of a Korean meal, I did not fall in love with the banchan. We didn't empty any of the bowls. I was happy to see a green salad though. Overall, I felt as if their banchan were sweetened artificially, with Splenda perhaps. That is probably not the case, but it is the best way I can describe the flavor. The vegetables were definitely fresh. I simply didn't prefer the overall taste of these tasty little sides. 

It is worth a try, especially if you purchase the Yelp Deal, but I might recommend it for eel lovers or if you're looking for a nice spot to provide someone their first taste of Korean BBQ.",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,9,4,3,C0eo2zXvV6-ngH5neosuRw

Then she added that because i was told that they were doing it they will go ahead and let us. they gave us this seclude d room because apparently to them our party was ""too big!"" and she repeated this like twice before we got seated. 
5 adults wanted to do AYCE, 2 didn't. When we told them this, it was when they really gave us a hard time. They would not, by any chance, let us do what we wanted.

5320625,2011-07-17,2,A7jbtXYFAZhErOW7xIQinA,"Okay so right now its Sunday morning and for a good hour, Ive been driving around town trying to find something decent to eat for lunch. I had a craving for Korean food and after going to my usual places, I realized Koreans don't like to be open for business on a Sunday. =(

Out of last resort, I decided to go to Mothers Grill located right in the heart of the main Chinatown plaza. Ive known about this place for over 3 years now, but never bothered trying to go there because many people have told me it was very expensive. What made me decide to dine was the big banner they had in front saying there was a tofu soup special. I figured it was lunch time, therefore, the price had to be a little bit more decent. What do you know, I was wrong.. again.. like always.

Upon walking in, needless to say, the restaurant was gorgeous. It was very spacious with 3 different dining sections. It was clean, with paintings along the walls, fake plants here and there throughout the tables and even candles against the glass windows. They also played old school hits, such as Rhythm of the Rain and Fever. The place almost looked like an aristocratic home in the late 50s where your grandma and her 10 helpers and like 4 butlers would cook and serve dinner for a ball or something. It was cozy, elegant and even had a fire place in one of the sections where I was dining. However, right off the bat, you could tell, their main goal here was to attract more American customers and tourist visiting Chinatown than the local Asians. 

As far as the menu, the food here was very expensive. I'm talking about the cheapest thing was around $15, and from there it went up as you ordered Korean BBQ. Even with their lunch specials, their typical tofu soup was $10.95, bolgogi was $15, and for a combo, was like $24...And that was supposed to be their specials.

I ordered the seafood tofu soup. When it came out, I was very disappointed. There were no mussels in my soup like the picture. It came out not filled to the brim, and all I got for seafood was 1 shrimp, and 2 clams. I'm dead serious. The only good thing about my meal was the 4 side dishes that they gave me which were pretty decent amount. However, it was still kimchi, seaweed, cabbage and sweeten potatoes. For that price, I could have easily gotten more at a different Korean restaurant. Their soup was very bland, it did not taste rich or deep in flavors at all. In my opinion, they put way too much tofu and not enough broth. I couldn't even finish my rice because there was too much tofu and the rice would've made it literally mushed. Their spicy level was like a 1, even though I told my waitress to make it extra spicy. 

I can only assume because Mother's Grill is located in Chinatown, which is why their store was so pricey. I would not recommend this place to go eat, even if you have a special occasion. Unless you want to impress your guests with looks more than quality and money was not a problem.. than it could be ideal for special occasions. But that's really all up to you. Otherwise, the other Korean restaurants off of Chinatown plaza would be more ideal if you eat it on a regular basis.",3HXyXpdkH1rNAEEaSxQucw,2,1,2,oCKL4OWynYCBzEkGHKBTgw

5361285,2011-12-04,0,A7jbtXYFAZhErOW7xIQinA,"**Summary**
       - Language Barrier - I ordered Kalbi to cook at my table. They waitress then asks me if I'd like to cook it at the table. I say yes, and they bring it out precooked 10 minutes later. Does yes mean something else at this place?
       - Price - Their soup was about $3 more expensive and not as good as other places. Kalbi was way overpriced for the amount that was given. Other places can charge $30, but they give you enough to feed a family, not two ribs (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/A7jbtXYFAZhErOW7xIQinA?select=RwOwE1oYriUilsINL9YFyw).
       - Portions - Their portions are tiny and will leave you hungry and unsatisfied. I had to go grab a Wendy's Baconator after the dinner.
       - Flavor - We ordered two easy Korean dishes to test out the quality of the place. The soup was too salty, but the Kalbi was ok. I've never seen a place screw up Kalbi though.
       - Yelp Deal - I can see why they have to offer a 50% off. With prices/portions like those, it's a wonder they are still in business.
       - Extraneous charges - They charge $2 for extra rice and $3 for a can of soda. This tells me the business model they are based on.
**Ordered**
       - $29.95 Yangnyeom Galbi (Marinated Short Rib) - Flavor was good, but then again, you can't screw up Kalbi Ribs. You got two pieces of rib for 30 bucks. I could of gotten a buffet for that much (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/A7jbtXYFAZhErOW7xIQinA?select=zN1dqICqY41rXst-kftKAQ).
       - $10.95 Kimchi Jjigae (Kimchi Soup) - Soup was too salty and it didn't come with an egg. Usually they crack a raw egg into this dish when they serve it to you.
**Recommendations**
       - I wouldn't recommend this place. There are tons of other Korean restaurants that give you more food at a reasonable price.",37S80IUIfb8yMsSwWWDsFA,4,0,1,lgr0EgXRShvCeOpzNOAIyA

Its comedic to have a large groups of people eat here cuz even though it seats six, its like a puzzle trying to figure out what food goes where on the table and it actually promotes eating faster since you need clear plates to make space for the mackerel, bibimbap, and that 3rd meat plate you ordered cuz you didn't think 2 was enough but it was.  

And to top it all off, you get that nice ""beef cologne"" scent from all the bbq that lasts on your clothes for at least a day.  I've always felt like the aerosol spray market was pigeonholed into just flowery type stuff and it could be big business to sell such scents as ""Korean BBQ"", ""Apple Pie"" and ""Mcdonald's French Fries"".

Service was great.  Its interesting in the US that the staff has to grill the beef for you as opposed to places in Korea and Japan.  I guess that's just a health regulation thing making sure some crazy person doesn't eat the whole plate raw or super rare, get sick and then sue the damn place.

When one of the food trucks needs to get their hands on the best Kimchi in Vegas, where do they turn?  Mothers!
Besides their spicy pork (which is phenomenal!) I would also recommend their haemul pajeon (seafood pancake) and their seafood soondubuchigae (spicy soft tofu stew).
The only improvement I might add would be to put in some charcoal grills for us old school Korean BBQ'ers.  Besides that, I will probably not be going to any other Korean restaurants in Vegas in Mother's price category - I would just be wasting my money on lesser quality food.",8rjx_whu6Zm-Kn3rsrugsg,3,0,5,-37SNxZb3yyISarCf07Gaw

I went there two days ago for Bibimbap for lunch.  There were hardly anyone in the restaurant because it was about 3 p.m.  But, service was slow and they never came back to ask how everything was and I had to call them to bring me more water and for the check.  The dish was probably the worst bibimbap I've ever had and it was $13 at lunch which is at the expensive end for this dish.  And, they forgot to include spinach (what's bibimbap without it?) and the egg was so raw that the whites were still runny!  The gochujang sauce was so blend  that it did not add anyflavor to the dish.  They had not properly seasoned any of the veggies that were in the dish so the whole thing had virtually no taste.  Then, immediately after eatomg, I got a headache and I found out that they do use MSG in the sauce.  So, I am sure that they use MSG in their other dishes especially BBQ marinade and hot dishes.  If you are allergic to MSG, definitely avoid the restaurant. 

I've had BBQ there and it was decent, nothing special.  Also tried hot casserole dish another time.  I am never going back to Mother's.",8p2sYQWMBibPYW1jei49eA,0,0,2,7s9D---g_jFJDCmqrE--KA

Now both of us are Korean and we are super picky about how food tastes and it is super hard to find a korean restaurant that meets our standards. We both had the dolsotbibimbap (rice with mixed veggies on a hot stone plate) and it was ok. It's definitely not something special and for the price, you can get the same thing at other korean restaurants for about $5 cheaper so for the price and the service, which wasn't all that great, I don't think I'll be going back again.",jgoG_hHqnhZvQEoBK0-82w,5,0,2,v6Uke28nZEsmibThfPyxsA

We recently ordered 3 entrees, soft drinks and no dessert, and the bill was $85 with tip. But for that price you get a lot of food, great banchan. The bulgogi is some of the best I've tried in town. All the dishes are authentic. The owner made a nice gesture by coming to the table to ask if everything was ok.

The best thing we had this evening was the kimchi and rice, but the rice wasn't even that great. I used to love the food here but now it seems just over-priced and the taste just does not justify the price.

I decided it was time for me to introduce the family to Korean BBQ, and so I googled to find the best Korean BBQ in Vegas.  Mother's was on the top of a few lists, and so that's where we went.  Well...the long and short of it is that the food is basically inedible. We tried to pick our way around the fat and gristle on the steaks and then basically gave up on the chicken.

5893610,2011-01-06,2,A7jbtXYFAZhErOW7xIQinA,"Went to Mother's as sort of a last resort. We had been craving pho but after a mishap, we couldn't go back to Pho Vietnam upstairs. I was glad we ended up at Mother's anyway because I wanted some bibimbap. 

Upon arrival, we were seated promptly. The first thing that I noticed was the restaurant was decorated like a home. There was a fireplace and all kinds of little sayings on the wall (like ""home is where the heart is""). The decor gave it a very homely feel. Even their bathroom is decorated well. The handicap stall even has a bidet! 

The menu was pretty extensive and had most typical Korean dishes. I ordered the dolsot bibimbap ($16). I wasn't used to the agar that they perched on top of my dish. It was weird, so I avoided it. The bibimbap is served on a flat stone plate rather than your typical stone bowl. It was so good and satisfied my craving. The soup (I believe it had daikon in it) was so perfect on a rainy night.  The only thing that disappointed me was the lack of banchan that they offered. They had kimchi, bean sprouts, cucumbers, and fish cakes, but I wish they'd offer more. Overall, it was a scrumptious meal; that bibimbap was bomb.

I just saw that their hours on Friday and Saturday are 8am-5am! Yikes! They sure know how to cater to the drunk masses!",CZqB9PPVV0oUjapqODsisg,4,2,4,yJlTPryST8CmvqK8hhG4wg

5918628,2010-06-24,2,A7jbtXYFAZhErOW7xIQinA,"My ex-coworker from NorCal came to visit with his wife, and we decided to meet up and grab some lunch.  Since we used to go to Palace BBQ Buffet in Sunnyvale, CA, (at least once every two weeks for 3-4 years, before our Santa Clara office was moved to San Mateo) we decided to drive around Spring Mountain and look for another Kroean BBQ joint.  The first one we found of course was Mother's Korean BBQ, and since we were really hungry we decided to try it out on the account that it serves Korean BBQ and it looks nice.

We ended up order their most expensive BBQ combo platter to grill at the table.  They didn't have all-you-can-eat (which was one of the major draw of Palace Korean BBQ Buffet back home, plus they marinated the various meats with perfection only attained after years if not generations of practice and refinement), but the platter of beef and seafood looks decent, except none of it was marinated.  I was thinking WTH!?  $100 something and the meats are not even marinated, I could have done this at home for 25% of the cost.  Anyway, initial expectation and perceived value of the meal aside, the shrimps were fresh and the beef had nice marbling and it tasted good after being seared on the grill.  The side dishes had good selections, and when we asked for refills of the ones we finished the friendly Korean lady were quick to give us more.

Not sure if it is the Korean Mother instincts kicking in, but they also tried to help us cook our food.  I was mildly offended, because I am so used to doing all the grilling whenever I went out to Korean BBQ with my friends and coworkers, and didn't need the wait staff to unconsciously rush us by cooking all the food we have ordered as quickly as possible.  Plus after we started our meal we weren't in a rush, and with the restaurant being semi-empty, didn't feel that table turnover was an issue.

Anyway, I definitely have had better Korean BBQ in Korean (of course), in Taiwan and of course in NorCal and Korea Town in Los Angeles.  Price-wise I thought for what we were served, it was really expensive.  The quality of the food was good, the beef was sliced thin as expected.  The service was friendly but also inadvertently rushed.  The place was clean and in a prime spot in the ChinaTown Plaza.

Would I come back?  Probably not for their expensive BBQ, although their Kalbi is supposedly the best in town.  But I can also make that at home with a quick stop to Greenland Supermarket when I don't feel like making it from scratch.  So only a 2 stars review from me, since I have definitely have had way better food and experience from other Korean BBQ restaurants.",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,1,1,2,XVsdXeRca_nyUP4IHqmkRg
5968652,2013-05-28,0,A7jbtXYFAZhErOW7xIQinA,"Make it simple, this restaurant try to rip customers off.  $17.99 big banner hang outside the restaurant but when we get in, no one give us any water or anything beside REGULAR menu, until we ask, a guy brought us a ""All you can menu"". Price? of course it's different, $22.95 or $27.95 all you can eat.

Me and my wife were starving but they serve everything so slow, the grill, never hot and they just dumped the raw meat in there.  I keep turn high heat on the grill but all servers when they approached my table, they turn it down with no reason.

Third round I ordered some pork belly & pork ribs, end up they served me a huge pork chop at least 1 & 1/2"" thick, I cut a piece and cook it myself(which I always want to cook it myself, but servers keep come bother us and said they cooked for us).  The next moment totally piss me off - an old Korean waitress, came and said there were people waiting for tables (actually no-one were), we have to cook the whole piece, we can't cook little by little and mentioned that there is a time limit for ""all you can it"".  I asked here when we started, she didn't answer and walk away, moments later she came back and said we've another 1/2 hr, I told her to tell all waitress stop approaching my table and let me finish my dinner.  

I asked for at least 5 times for my check but no one give it to me, probably they want to wait until I finish everything on the table, if not, they can charged my left over.  Too bad I ate it all.  There were groups of other customers came before us but they even left behind us.

My conclusion, they want you pay full price and eat half, maximize their profit.  They turned down the fire so customers spend more time on cooking.  If you order more than 2 rounds, they will find excuses to kick you off.
