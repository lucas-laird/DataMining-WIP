It wasn't too sweet or too saucy or anything like other locations. I love their white fried rice too!

It was clear she was not happy at this particular moment. No greeting, no smile. The most disappointing part was when she got us Sweet and Sour sauce, she stood by her station and waited for us to walk back through the line, pass some customers to retrieve the sauce from her.

Tasty Beijing beef and orange chicken with bacon with noodles...delicious!  All this enjoyed in what is single handily the LARGEST PE dining area I have ever been in!

My only complaint with this location is the indigenous personnel strolling in and out of the lengthy business.  Enjoy your chow but keep your head on a swivel.",HJj82f-csBI7jjgenwqhvw,4,4,3,154-TNrD3iKngRDp5uXd6w

If you've been to several Pandas, you've noticed that some give so little. Customer service is very good for what it is. Fast food is sometimes crazy. I would agree that sometimes the food servers get distracted with another workers job, but that's life.

 My cashier acted like I was inconveniencing her when I came back to the register to get my spring rolls and fortune cookies they forgot to put in my order. She added the spring rolls with a bit of an attitude like I was the one who missed something then moved on to the next customer before I had gotten my problem resolved. She ignored me until I asked her for a couple cookies. She handed me one, instead of the normal two I've always received at other locations.

3469580,2015-07-29,0,GdnLwnezKcZwoP-fnVtPNg,"Customer service should be a priority no matter what type of restaurant it is. I visited this location and it was 20 minutes till closing time, if the clock has not struck closing time then a customer should have the full service that they are paying for. As soon as my partner and I walked through the doors to enter the cashier seemed annoyed, the staff was more than ready to close their door. Only scraps were left and she immediately stated that what they had left was the only thing that we could order. The noodles were broken and not even a spoonful was left, and the sauces were thick and reduced to sticky clumps. I was so hungry I chose from their mediocre selection and whatever didn't look like it had chewed up and spit out onto the platter. I felt frustrated and then insulted when my partner asked the cashier for soy sauce packages and the cashier gave a rude sigh and rolled her eyes.  
No matter what type of restaurant it is, a customer pays for the food and should receive great service. A good restaurant should require nothing less than excellent customer service from their employees.

If you've never been to a Panda Express, I'll explain how it works: You walk into this place and have options on what you want in terms of meal sizes. 2-entree plate? 3-entree plate? Family Panda Feast? Take your pick. Then you pick either chow mein or fried rice (or both!), plus your choice of entrees. It's quick, it's pretty good, and it's priced right. 

In terms of what's good to eat here, I'd say you can't go wrong with the Orange Chicken. It's pretty good, and it's consistently a top-seller there. I like the Honey Walnut Shrimp and Sweet and Sour Pork, too.

You should know that nothing here is of exceptional quality. There's nothing here that's going to blow your mind with how good or how fresh or well-prepared it is. That's not to say this place is bad. It's just good Chinese food that's made quick and it's a value.",D-ZyQ4iT1XRFkcOAWXnxCQ,3,0,4,KCvbl1olxuUj-Hbe2NMDrA

Seemed like the bosses needed more profits or something. It was a very uncomfortable feeling for me. 

We had to order three times what we usually do. 

Someone made some mistakes with chili sauce and made my kids freak out. We like hot food but certain things we order for a baby shouldn't be hot !
