I wasn't even able to choke down a single bite, it felt as if I was chewing on a chunk of rubber. My girlfriend however was able to find eatable morsels around the edges, where the breading overpowers the rubber. After overcoming my urge to vomit, I went on to try to feed the chicken to my dog, who favored licking his asshole over trying to eat the hunk of grissle being passed off as a chicken sandwich. Please don't waste five bucks on this poor excuse of a restaurant! I mean I wasn't expecting much but its honestly surprising how they screwed up a
 piece of meat this bad! Even the frozen chicken shelled out by the grocery stores puts this crap to shame!",sJSeFwx68D_w0W8BAaUcIw,0,0,1,qYb5GXC_aerHwnTj6uEJpg

I just think they are under staffed for one reason or another, and have been for the past couple years I have been coming here. Gyros are great, so that is why I wait, but the manager/owner needs to get their you know what together, because I don't have time to wait this long, and will think twice before stopping by again. This time the drive thru was so busy when I pulled up, I decided to go inside because I thought it would be faster. Nope! I don't frequent fast food often, but will look for a different option next time. Too bad, the staff that helped me was amazing, and offered me a free drink or turnover, other...maybe I will come back, the lady was so nice. The third star is just for the awesome lady at the register, who worked to keep me engaged, and kept the energy up with her team.

1834439,2012-11-24,0,FEEJ4rK8EZ7cqIvBM5luGg,"The service here gets worse every time.

We stop for fast food about once a month, usually when we are in a rush to be somewhere. Arby's has recently become my ""go to"" fast food spot, on account of the selection. Honestly, most of the sandwiches I get do not feel like fast food.

On this stop, it occurred to me that, every time we come to this Arby's (about once every 2 months), something happens that leaves us sitting in the car for 5+ minutes waiting for our food. They may as well close the drive through option at that point. While I do not expect the attendants to be the standard of professionalism, they do some ignorant things, like take the money before mentioning the ""5-8 minute wait"" and rush me while ordering. Also, be aware that the speaker box faces Durango, so it can be difficult to hear clearly, even when the attendant does attempt to speak properly. 

On this particular stop, the wait ended with a bag stuffed with napkins, 2 fresh sandwiches and rock hard, cold fries... I imagine that even your typical stoner drive through attendant would think the heat up some fresh fries after initiating the unexplained waiting period.

Do not stop at this Arby's if you want to be in and out or if you want a constantly prepared meal. We have not eaten inside, but I would guess that the tables are sticky and none of the salt shakers are full.",rdysF0ymVkMX82Bu_8x3nA,0,0,2,Wnp-UNL2KdSZhxR7rX7_yA

I think the gas station nacho cheese from a pump is a higher quality. We gave them a chance thanks to some mailer coupons and I wish we paid full price at the sub shop across the street. The only thing saving this review from 1 star is the service.

2165188,2016-03-03,1,FEEJ4rK8EZ7cqIvBM5luGg,"Well, I went to Arby's today to get a chicken sandwich and mozzarella sticks, both of which I was craving. Went through drive through, and still waited a while to get my food. Thought this was a drive through of a fast food restaurant. I get my food and start eating it. At first I thought it was just a very fatty chicken sandwich. After eating nearly half of this sandwich, I take it apart to get the fat out. Turns out, I was eating RAW chicken!! The outside was barely cooked, just the fried breading, and the rest was completely RAW. I turned around and went back, spoke to the manager and demanded my money back. First thing she asked me? ""Can I get you a new one?"" No, you already fed me a raw chicken sandwich, no way will I let you feed me something else equally or more harmful to me. Now, 12 hours later. I am still very nauseous, struggling to keep my little bit of dinner down. All I've been able to eat today is a little bit of dinner. I can't even drink without almost losing it all. And I've had a fever for over 9 hours now. Definitely will never eat at Arby's again. Especially at this place. Can't believe they gave me raw chicken.

They messed up our order and the two people before us.

Problems? Large onion rings only half full. No cheese in the mozzarella sticks.

I was going out for dinner last night and she didn't want the food I was going to be having so I had to provide something for her.  After giving several choices, she opted for Arby's whose Market Fresh sandwiches she liked in the past.

I drove down and got a turkey ranch with bacon Fresh Market sandwich and an order of curly fries.  I was home in no time at all.  When I got in late last night, she elated how good her dinner was.  She liked the sandwich and the fries were something that haven't been in the house for years.

Now from my perspective, service was just OK.  The counter critter who took my order was lethargic and that's being kind.  After taking my order, she went about filling some others and motioned to me when my order was ready.  There was only one person in the restaurant besides me and only two cars at the drive through.

Overall, the place gets an A-OK rating.  My wife was happy, I didn't have to make something for her at home, and I was off to Bouchon for some French Bastille Day food.  Win win!",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,4,5,3,I5yhP6UjBwfKEg2gdyXpOA

I absolutely love Arby's.  I thoroughly enjoy coming here for lunch to get some tenders and curly fries or a chicken sandwich with bacon all washed down with a nice refreshing Diet Pepsi.

I cannot say enough about the Arby's Sauce and Horsey Sauce.  I usually get two cups of each for dipping my curly fries in! They're that tasty!

Arby's is one of the few fast food places that serves Pepsi products and Diet Pepsi is rapidly becoming my new favorite Diet soda instead of Coke.

4738648,2017-03-30,4,FEEJ4rK8EZ7cqIvBM5luGg,"Introduction:
Arby's is one of my favorite go to place when I crave fast foods.  Actually, at least once a week.  However, I haven't been to one almost 3 months now, due to their consistent poor customer experience.  I decided to give it a try here since I haven't been to one in Las Vegas.  Boy, was that a mistake!

Customer Service: Negative trillion 
WOW! I've had bad service and I get it when certain people have bad a day.  But this experience was beyond that. 

I was assisted by a Kenny, from start to finish, this guy just appeared miserable.  One of those individual's that looks at himself in the mirror and thinks to himself ""my goodness, I hate you""!

I tried saying hello to him cause he looked like he had a bad day.  You would think the common courtesy is to reply back. Nope, I was ignored. When I asked following up questions, he replied in the most unfriendly tone you can't imagine.  I figured I am not going to give up on this miserable Kenny, so I said thank you after I paid, you would think he replied. Nope, I was ignored again. Very sad!

Quality: 4/5
The bread and meat was a little dry on certain areas, but still decent. I am sure it's due to the slow traffic.  Probably from the crappy service, no one wants to be there.

Price: 2/5
Would be 5 stars, since the service is so bad, I felt overpaid.

Atmosphere: 1/5
Kenny brought this down!

Cleanliness: 2/5
There was lots of sticky sauces on the table.  Had the service been good, probably would've been tolerable.

Tips to owner:
Go eat at Chik-Fil-A and take notes on how to hire.

Tips to Kenny:
Life's not that bad, you have a job and you can walk. If you hate dealing with people, get a back office job. Hopefully, you will pass the interview. Smile, life's good if you can walk and talk.  Perception is everything, you are a walking business card, you get 1-2 seconds to impress. 

Tips to customers:
STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE.  IT CAN RUIN YOUR DAY!",a69W0w2h-1Q_YpEebzwt7g,5,2,1,Tqn9I0SiqJTl5hMCIJOLLw

One fryer even caught on fire and instead of closing or getting it fixed they just used the other ones for WEEKS. 
Homeless people come in and out. People constantly come in and used drugs in the bathroom.

Lately, both the quality of their food and service have gone down hill. I also used to like the French Dip and Swiss, but the last 2 times I ordered it, the sandwich and the Au Jus has been flavorless. A few times, I decided to try other things on the menu, like the Chicken Bacon Swiss Sandwich and the Jr. Ham and Cheddar Melt, but both were very very salty. 

Service used to be good. I have never seen this place busy, but the employees have always been friendly. However, when I came here the other day, the employee at the register didn't even greet me. She just stood there staring into space, waiting for me to say something first. While I was waiting for my food, I could hear the drive thru intercom inside the restaurant.
