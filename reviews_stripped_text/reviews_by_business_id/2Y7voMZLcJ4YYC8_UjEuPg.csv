I ordered my food and the woman taking my order kept giving me my total before I could even finish. ""May I have the combo...total....ok and an order of....total....."" As annoying as that is, I finally got through. Here's to the reason for the review and impeding call to corporate. I used a $20 bill to pay for my $14 and change order. The woman gives me my coins with honey and ""drops some"" as she says. I go to put the honey away and fish for my coins. I look up and the woman is gone and window closed. I wait and flag her down and ask for how much my total was again. She says ""oh"" and THEN gives my my receipt before attempting to close the window again. I say ""excuse me but I kid with a $20"". This woman says ""oh yea that's what I took out"", she gives me my $5 but didn't open the register meaning she had my money! It's unbelievable that she would ""forget"" change and receipt. Wow.

it was hot and I wasn't in anyway ready to order and serenity was super patient, which means a lot to me lol 
She gave us a cup for something to drink while we waited which really helped cool me off. We didn't even have to wait long either. 
When she gave us our bags she repeated everything we ordered even included sauces and honey with out us asking ... round of applause for that and because she felt the pieces of chicken were small she gave us a few extra pieces of thighs.
