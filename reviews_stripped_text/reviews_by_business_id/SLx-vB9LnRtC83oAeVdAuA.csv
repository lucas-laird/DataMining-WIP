Appetizers: We ordered Soy Garlic Chicken, The Sh*t, Bulgogi Fries, Baked Lobster, Amaebi Shrimp, Pink Scallop, and Oyster.

Seafood: Shrimp, Mussel, Crab leg, Dungeness Crab, and Lobster with Chingon sauce.

1355404,2018-03-29,0,SLx-vB9LnRtC83oAeVdAuA,"I can't believe how incredible this place was, though not unexpected, since it's owned by the guys behind Neko Sushi and Hwaro.

We went here for my fiance's birthday, she loves crab. The prices are extremely fair for the quantity and quality of seafood you get. The options are plentiful and they have unique sauces for whatever you end up wanting to order, the AYOC really makes it easy for experimentation. The food is amazing, absolutely blown away, the clams and shrimp especially were always just right and the clams have such a good texture to them. All 3 sauces are unique and equally enjoyable, though we preferred their most popular the cajun sauce. They have some of their baked rolls from Neko here, like the Japanese Lasagna or the Baked Scallop rolls, both are ordered as appetizers and are as great as they are downstairs. Also, their soju cocktails are great tasting too.

The atmosphere with quiet piano music and beautiful artwork makes the place feel so comfy; but even more importantly was how well we were treated by the staff. Orville and Simba, the two gentleman working that night, were insanely attentive and would always cater to our needs. They were able to accommodate utensil requests additional dipping sauces, and they would CONSTANTLY check on us to make sure we were stocked on waters and alcohol. They were never intrusive and it always felt appreciated having such wonderful staff at a restaurant.

The biggest challenge they had last night was the wrong items being delivered to the tables.

The waiters were very attentive...the soju was great, the sauces were VERY salty 

But it wasn't even that, it was this one guy, probably the manager, practically telling us how much we should get...you ask for five order he tells you i'll give you four cause your probably not going to finish it. The whole time he might as well have the menu and order for us, you'll FEEL like your in somebody's house and can't eat to your hearts's content. 

I've read from reviewers that the sauces were bland, well now it's VERY salty just like the manager. For snow crabs they should have an option of no sauce, just plain fresh crab legs, not boiled, they taste the best.

It's good that they improved on their waiters though, the other waiter was so kind, thoughtful and attentive unlike the manager otherwise they should just put in their menu 4 orders at a time max if they won't let you decide anyway",sorCv1dsZN4oNl7w_ZtCXg,2,0,2,RtP1KQqUBnB8HdJ0thLnrQ

They have a variety of appetizers to choose from. We had Bulgogi fries, tempura squid, KFC, Dynamite, and tempura crab (stick). The tempura crab was our favorite...imitation crab stick with a yummy sauce drizzled on it.

I got black mussels, snow crab, corn, potato, and a seafood ball in a spicy sauce (which you can get ""spicy"" or ""crazy""). My brother got shrimp, mussels, corn, and seafood ball in Cajun Garlic Butter. 2nd round for me was snow crab, clams, and seafood ball in Cajun Garlic Butter...and my brother got more seafood yummy goodness in Lemon Pepper.
Cajun Garlic Butter was our favorite out if all three offerings.

Shrimp were headless, which we liked, so you head-suckers out there might think otherwise. Crab was actually Dungeness, but I didn't miss the snow crab because I think Dungeness is fresher. My clams were fresh, small and tender...NOT overcooked like some places.

After having our fill of appetizers and seafood, we got to have dessert to end our evening. I chose the affagato (scoop of vanilla with a shot of Korean coffee over it) and my brother got the Gangham style ice cream sandwich. Both were tasty and finished off our meal wonderfully.

The service was spectacular...and very friendly. They checked on us often, cleared our empty plates often, and consistently asked if everything was OK.

I highly recommend you try I Love Crab. We will definitely be back in the future.

Note to management: I think having real spoons and forks (instead of plastic) would be a plus...and instead of the American Hip Hop, K-Pop music would be much appreciated!",OcpxS8U7evLWyfw1K2pwng,2,1,4,wkODQJuDwe8VRLqy_YbQBA

Walk in and behind the hostess bar is a fair amount of empty boxes just thrown there. 2 steps in an the bartender comes around and asks for our IDs because it's 21 only. No hello just ""let me see IDs"". Then doesn't read our IDs correctly. She didn't know the birthday was on the back so she just checked the front and gave them back. Nice... harass me then you don't check.

We sit at the bar and ordered a Scooby Snack & a Crown & Coke. The bartender making our drinks is in sweats.... classy. 

The Scooby Snack was poorly mixed and tasted awful. The Crown & coke was fine. 

In come our friends and the same weird harassment about the IDs for them. The next party that came in didn't get harassed and I'm assuming they're regulars.

Keeping this in mind I was really excited that we decided to come to this restaurant again tonight because we loved the experience we had the first time, tonight this is why I decided to give this place a one star.

I'm here anticipating that I'll be having a good time, but how I was treated at the restaurant when I was near the end of my meal just turned sour all of a sudden. They sent out one of their employees to stand next to my table, the man stood there and watched us waiting for us to touch the check and insert a payment. He was watching us like we're some kind of thugs out here to skimp out on paying the bill. I'm sad to say this, but tonight will probably be my last time I'll visit. I wanted to share this so everyone is aware of the treatment you'll get.

It's more like boiling crab style but ALL YOU CAN EAT. It's $20 late night special from 11 - closing. Step 1 is AYCE appetizer. The baked mussel and bulgogi fries were REALLY good! (*dont get the magic seaweed rice..*) Step 2, 3, and 4 are the side with seafood and sauce. We tried all 3 sauces and the one I like most was the Cajun butter. It was a good amount of flavor and very buttery. I usually love spicy but their spicy sauce is not even that spicy. Step 5 is the dessert. The Gangnam is worth a try but not amazing. If you like coffee though, the affogato is for you! Personally, I LOVED IT! All of my friends said it was bitter, but I thought the ice cream mixed with the coffee was the perfect taste. Service there is really friendly. Overall, I only gave it a 4 because the sauce weren't up to my expectation.

But man, am I glad I decided to give it a shot.

I Love Crab is upstairs to my favorite sushi restaurant Sushi Neko. They are related and have a few of the same appetizers. I Love Crab has their own unique appetizers, too. One of my favorites was the crab tempura. So delicious and perfectly crunchy. Their salmon sashimi was fresh and wonderful sitting in a tasty, sesame soy sauce. 

They were missing 3 items on their menu due to some miscommunications with one of their vendors and quite a few were permanently crossed off the menu but, my gosh, there's a whole lot to choose from still!!

Our server and host was so kind and our food came out super quick.

There is nowhere that beats $28 AYCE seafood. Yes, you can only have one really, juicy, meaty lobster tail but you get unlimited shrimp, snow crab, and mussels. That's pretty outstanding and definitely worth it.

I chose the spicy sauce and my boyfriend did the crazy spicy sauce. I didn't taste his but, mine had a nice spice to it but both of us agreed that we would've liked it a little spicier.

I thought the quality of the food was high, the interior was fun and hip, they played some KPop that I thoroughly enjoyed and I'm not even a KPop fan.

Seriously, this place is awesome. There's nowhere better in Vegas for AYCE seafood and I'll definitely return when I recover from my seafood coma.",dDe8K-gvBXuqp2zXmUFotg,2,2,5,6Dj54VRBNhkN8wqfsgbhEw

Had an evening of fun reasons to celebrate getting our celebrity on.  First timer at this karaoke joint.  We were given a private room to belt out our talents and laughter.  The experience was really enjoyable!

Our courteous server Simba took care of us throughout the event; checked on us frequently throughout the night.  He even gave us a quick tutorial on the equipment and explained food items before taking our order.

It's a cool idea that food is served for this kind of hangout.  The sweet potato fries were a shock, not what we expected in appearance.  But the chicken wings, musubi, and monster fries were all gobbled up.  
  
Pricing is per room by the hour; and not per person.  The establishment is also available for dining without karaoke and there's the ""coolest bar ever"".  Bar goers to decide... But the art and deco are things to gander upon.

$27.95 for AYCE Cajun crab sounded like a great idea.  

The appetizer menu was decent.  Flavors were not good.  Everything seemed like it was drowned in eel sauce.  

But who cares... we were here for the Cajun boil seafood, right??  

Unlike Boiling Crab or Hot & Juicy, when your whole group orders, they put all the orders into one bag.  So if your friend across the table ordered Cajun Garlic like you, both of your orders will be in the same bag.  Our server explained that they do this because they only have one steamer in the kitchen. Lol.  

None of the flavors had good flavor.  We ordered the spicy which was flavorless until you were hit with an extreme spiciness that killed all your flavor buds.  

The Cajun Garlic has no flavor.  

The Lemon Garlic was probably the best flavor but the car was set low.  

The actual seafood was good. Just disappointing that it was cooked in such flavorless seasoning.   

We won't be back.  This place won't last another 6 months unless they bring a real chef to fix their menu.  This menu was developed by somebody who did a very poor job of copying their competitors.",sjZ3ScfAJ2bjDVI6MmSNGA,0,0,1,yJG-ILaz3E7p11NEjCw0iQ

Mediocre at best Korean food.  We opted for the Korean a la carte menu rather than the AYCE crab (weird combination at this karaoke locale).  We had dukbokki, the sausage and vegetables, and side of fish cake.  Dukbokki tasted alright but the sauce had mild at best after ordering extra spicy.  The dish was bland and was just a plate of rice cake with a fe onions sliced around it.  Way too little sauce for dipping and fish balls ,although supposed to be a topping/with the dukbokki sauce and innards, was on the side.  Fish cake were deep-fried - unexpected - and tasted very freezer-like.  The sausage and veggies were poor tasting.  Low quality hot dog with again ""vegetables"" that included sauteed onions.  The sauce was a gross ketchup consistency/taste that we barely touched and left half on the plate.  Soju is available for $10 as is karaoke for $20 or $30 depending on the room.

Some of the items took a bit to come out but it's understandable because they have to bake them and deep fry them what not. For the main course, My parents and I got the Cajun Garlic Butter seasoning and it was jam packed with flavor, I have no complaints! My brother got the Lemon Pepper and he said that it was good and my sister got the spicy one and her lips were dying by the end but it was worth it lol! The crab legs with full of meat and the shrimp and crawfish were full of flavor! For dessert they just have the basic vanilla ice cream, green tea ice cream, affogato (vanilla ice cream with Korean coffee), and they also have I Love It (their specialty). The I Love It is definitely a must try! 

Although the food was amazing, the service was lacking. All of our orders had things missing from them. I ordered baby corn (not really baby corn...it's just cut up corn), baby potatoes (red skin potatoes), shrimp, and crab and I only received the crab, corn, and shrimp. I told our server and she later came back with the shrimp. My brother had all his order correct, my sister was missing her potatoes and fishcakes, and our parents were missing their sausage. We just told our server and they come back with it when it's ready. From what I can tell there were only 2 servers and since it was getting busy, they were kind of rushing. Once they drop off the food they just leave and sometimes we want to order something else but they're already gone. Even though it would be a while before they stopped by our table again, they would stop by when they get a chance.

I will start by agreeing with Henry K, the Korean Fried Chicken is very good. I suggest you order the whole chicken fried (don't worry, they cut it up so you can easily eat it without making a mess). Do know, the chicken is prepared ""to order"", (not sitting under a lamp, like at KFC) so it does take 30 minutes. Suggest you order an appetizer while you wait. Wait is worth it. 

The other Korean dishes are also very good. Spicy, but just right for a Gringo, like me.

Service is very friendly and efficient. They have private Karaoke Rooms, so you can take the good time you had at dinner, and add to it.

This review is only for the a la carte menu and not the ayce seafood menu.

Order: 
Chicken Wings:
We ordered the large wings which is 12 pieces of wings. We did half and half of plain and korean sweet n spicy. Noted this is supposed to be ""korean"" with all the korean menu and advertisements all over the wall. Let me tell you these chicken wings were FARRR from korean fried chicken. THE WORST I've had. It literally seemed as if they took frozen wings and fried it. The sweet and spicy wings was not even tossed to cover the whole wing but they drizzled some korean spicy red pepper sauce on top which was thick and not good. French fries where the steak fries (also seemed like it came from a frozen bag of fries you buy at walmart). 

O-Deng-Tang
So o-deng tang is korean fish cake soup with fish cake inside. It's supposed to be a light anchovy based broth with fish cake inside. Similar to udon noodle broth I guess. Even on their menu it is picture how I described it. However, when we received it, it was a red spicy broth. Tasted like the korean fish stew (maeuntang). I mean this was actually not bad. Better than the wings. But they put waayyyy too much garlic and red pepper flakes. This was seriously false advertising on their menu. 

Soju Cocktail:
It was a buy one get one free. $12 per cocktail. It is not good. We ordered the peach and melon soju cocktail. The melon had some weird pulp to it as we drank more and more. Both cocktails were super watery soju tasting. I don't recommend. 

Honestly I don't even know if this place is korean owned. The food is so ridiculous. We also asked for a cocktail menu for the server to bring us one, but she said that they don't have anything on that menu right now. WTH? They why even bring it to us?

Overall, I would never come back to this place. I rather go to Q Bistro up the street. Drinks and food sucks here. I don't recommend at all. Only reason for 2 stars is because the o-deng-tang was decent (even though it was falsely advertised on the menu).",3LNCN_aMHo97xvEFR4PhDw,0,0,2,2P_admj1VaTEmAG2f6wkMg

The garlic lemon seasoning is underwhelming. Is there a garlic shortage because if you look at the a sooonful of sauce from Hot and Juicy you get enough garlic to scare old Dracula away. The sauce here is eatery clear with bits of garlic here and there. Seasoning and flavors did not seep in at all. We tried one of everything. The tasty items were the fish balls and potatoes. Everything else was like casino food where they boiled the flavor out of everything and overcook. Try a Hot n Juicy shrimp around the corner and then try the shrimp and sauce at A18. It's a night and day difference. Pretty much all of our black mussels tastes spoiled and we just threw it all out. It was mushy and tasted spoiled. The big ones were ok and firm tasting but it had no taste and overcooked. The desserts were very good. However we came here for crabs. After all the name is I love Crab not I love Potatoes and Fishballs.

We had to wait but the servers were nice and gave us water while we waited. Kudos. However until they change cooks or recipes, I will not come back and in all honesty cannot recommend to friends to try it. I like crab and got roped in by the reviews, price, and well I like the many legged creatures.

When the guy behind the bar asked if we wanted drinks and we asked for a drink menu, he told us he actually wasn't the bartender but the bartender would be back after some ""outside business"" and could take our order then. Turns out the bartender was at Starbucks and unfortunately it didn't get any better when he returned. 

Our waters came in styrofoam cups, and they didn't give us silverware, plates, or napkins. We waiting about 10 minutes to see if they came out with it and no luck. Our wings had sauce on the side versus being tossed in it like the photos on Yelp. 

What's more, none of the Soju cocktail flavors on the menu were available, NONE. But they were buy-1-get-1, however we could not sub a beer as our free beverage (beer is $5 and soju cocktails are $12).

The saving grace and the only reason we didn't give it one star was the other woman sitting at the bar apparently worked there and not only offered to get us chopsticks when we had no silverware or plates, but she also chased us out the door when we forgot our to-go box on the bar.

My trusted yelp app told me this was the closest restaurant that was still opened at 3am, so we made a beeline there. 

Climbed some stairs and you are there. We were greeted almost as soon as we walked in. We ordered the sweet and spicy chicken wings and rice cake with no fish cake (dining companion is allergic to all seafood).  

The chicken wings were so good but they weren't joking about the spicy part.   Super fun and perfectly sticky with the perfectly deep fried crusty skin, the meat was still amazingly juicy. The order came with a side of pickled radish cubes and cole slaw; good but not great. It also came with fries. These are French fries that you know they get frozen from Costco or something. But they dipped them in this light batter. They almost tasted like super light tempura fries. I don't know what it was; maybe the Koreans are just really good at deep frying stuff, but they were so good! 

The rice cake was also good, not as good as the wings but I suspect the lack of fish cake simplified this otherwise flavorful dish.

The reviews here are pretty accurate when it comes to the great service for the first 15 minutes then goes downhill after that.

She was nearby helping other tables and we would try to signal her to get some more food because our party was still hungry, she would ignore us, turn around and once again dissapear. We then managed to get another waitress attention to place another bag of crab and 20 minutes later a bag of crab comes, with one leg for 4 people! Whaaaat!?!?

We came here last Friday..  we Love crab too.   We did not get a welcoming feeling when walking in.  We were just told ""one minute"".   We stood by the door for about 5 minutes then were seated.  Waitress came over quick and asked if we had been there before.   We said no.  She didn't explain much just said it's all you can eat.  We told her give us a second to decide what we wanted to drink.   She never came back to get a drink order.
We waived down a waitress and started ordering some appetizers and crab legs.  
I ordered 3 appetizers.   Only 1 came out, then our crab.   We ordered a couple more items.   Asked 2 more times for the 1st 2 apps that haven't come out yet.  They apologized and said they were backed up and it would be out shortly.    We ordered more crab.
One of the 3 appetizers came out.   Then the second order of crab.
We asked again for the apps we were waiting on (this time we asked the male who carried himself as a manager.  He apologized and promised it soon).   Never did receive them.   Waited so long for our bill we ended up doing the math and leaving exact change.  
We are really disappointed because this place has so much potential and delicious food (chicken wings, snow crab legs w sausage and the crab tempura).   Just wish I could've tried everything I ordered.  (Never received bulgogi fries, baked lobster, Korean chicken wings).

5594759,2018-03-02,0,SLx-vB9LnRtC83oAeVdAuA,"Okay I've been to this place MULTIPLE TIMES!  At this point you can call me a regular, bc all the waitstaff recognize me.  To be honest, I'm the kind of client they want,  I come regularly and every time I come I bring new people that have never been bc at one point I talked so highly about this place and spread the word about this place like the gospel to anyone that wants a unique experience and good seafood.  At one point I came here 3 times in a 2 week period bc I chose this place to bring out of town friends, celebrate my birthday and to just enjoy myself with my family.

With that said, I have to say that their organization and attentiveness in their waitstaff IS THE WORST!  I kept writing it off as ""maybe they're understaffed, maybe they're super busy, maybe they just hired new people and they're training"" but I've been there so many times I can recognize all the waiters and at this point no one is so new that they pass with the whole ""newbie, I'm still learning the ropes"" pass.  

The problem isn't that they aren't nice, the problem is that they ALWAYS disappear and hide.  It's AYCE I'm sorry...but at AYCE, ESPECIALLY ones that you have to order at the table and wait for it to come the staff needs to find a system that involves constantly clearing out dirty plates and piles of seafood shells off the table, filling up drinks and taking new orders efficiently and swiftly.  They FAIL big time at this, and this isn't the first time they are REPEAT offenders.  Seafood shells and trash build up so fast and no one shows up to clear it off your table, so there is a mountain of shit in front of you.  

The biggest MYSTERY of all is how LOOOOONG it takes to get rice  !!!!!!!!!!  Like literally EVERYTHING comes BEFORE the fucking rice!!  It's so perplexing....like how long does it take to scoop rice into a bowl??  Every. Single. Time I've been here the rice takes an exorbitant amount of time to get and you ALWAYS have to ask twice from the sometimes there staff!!???  It's SOOO ANNOYING! Do they cook the rice on order? If they do, that's stupid!  It would make sense if this was an American style restaurant that is generally known not to have rice on hand, but it is an ASIAN themed seafood joint, with a mostly ASIAN clientele in CHINATOWN for God's sake! 

In my experience, the Asian guy waiters have been more accommodating than the female waiters, I don't know why.  I'm starting to think that the asian guys that work there are more invested (owners?, managers? Family of the owners?  I don't know...they just seem a little bit more apologetic when we complain) the girls look like they don't give a shit and they are just trying to pick up a side check and could give a shit about what this review says tbh.  I'm also wondering if they are just bartenders that are asked to wait.  Bc the girls especially love to run to the back & disappear behind the empty bar and go on their phones, all while this unorganized mess is happening around the corner.  But the guys love to hide too and when they do show up and you complain about something they give you the whole ""oh my God I'm soooooo sorry, let me get you a drink for the wait..."" in a way that is so overly nice that it's a bit condescending and/or they are secretly corrupting your food in the back.  (Trust me, I know that tone...I work in customer service too and I am VERY FAMILIAR with that tone) At first you're like ""ok at least they apologized"" but then nothing is fixed and all the same issues keeping coming up!  It's as if they think apologizing in their slightly annoying tone fixes all the problems with this place.  

With all of that said, the ONLY thing that keeps me coming back is the value of the food you get.  The food has been consistent, but their service strategy needs to be revamped.  Maybe they should go to a restaurant that has a similar food service style like Umiya Sushi on Flamingo.  That place is like a well oiled machine.  They move so fast there and water is filled up before my glass is even half way full.  Whoever is training them needs to do some consulting for this place.

Final word.  I may or may not be back...it really depends how badly I'm craving a late night, seafood binge. But the past few time the service has been so lackluster that it's leaving a bad taste in my mouth when I leave...

BONUS TIP!!  If you want to prevent them from ignoring you and hiding I find that sitting around the bar, upfront is the best place to sit bc you can easily see them & wave them down to ask for something DO NOT sit on the right side of the restaurant by the windows bc it's like a cul de sac and you're completely hidden from their view when they retreat to the ordering window and the bar.  I think that's what Ive done wrong the last few times is sit somewhere that doesn't have a clear view of where they love to hide.",97bIIVHvtKGJbSwv2Slf9g,3,0,2,s205zo4hr0jGm2b3c31Tsg

Interior - it was nicely designed very simple and lots of seating. A little unorganized bc the outside door doesn't say ""I love Crab"" it just says A18 karaoke, so I thought is the entrance for the restaurant was next door.... 

Customer service - The servers really lacked customer service. Not once have any of them checked up on my table to see if we were okay. They even past buy maybe 5 times and still didn't ask. We literally had to flag one down while they were quickly walking passed our table... the restaurants wasn't busy at all when I came. Ive only seen three other tables that were seated. We placed an order for the scallop roll and they totally forgot about it... so we had to order it again... we also had to wait a good 10-15min to receive our rice AFTER we already go our entree... then another 10min to receive our check. When the employee passed by our table he did the whole ""ohh...(forgot to get their check expression)"" 

Food - The appetizers was good. The oysters were a little bland. But the spicy cheese squid & soy garlic chicken was amazing!! 1 star each for these dishes!!! Let's get down to the main entree. We got the crawfish, shrimp, snow crab legs and lobster with the Cajun garlic butter. The sauce lacked so much flavor. It tasted so watered down. The crawfish was so rubbery... I just didn't enjoy the seafood at all. 

If I had better service it would make up for the food but I didn't have great service or great food... the whole concept with the ayce seafood is great but it had a lot of flaws.

Not only did it have great reviews, but the owner is supposed to be the same owners as Sushi Neko and Sakana (which both have great food). We got there as soon as it opened so there was only one other table other than us. Our server was kind and helpful explaining the menu to us at first. After we placed our first order our huge pot of seafood came out piping hot. To be honest the taste was very disappointing. It was a mix of a wannabe hot n juicy and boiling crab sauce mixed with curry. The sauces had all fallen to the bottom of the pot so all the seafood was bland. To top it off there was hair on the corn. Don't get me wrong. I am not a food snob and 3 out of 5 of us work the f&b industry as well so we understand these things happen. We still finished the first pot and wanted to place another order. The server never came by. We tried waving her down, calling out excuse me as she was at the table right next to us, but nope. Nothing.  After waiting and waiting we finally waved her down and took our order. Took a good 20 min for our second pot to arrive but at this point we're pretty full from waiting 30 min.  To be fair there were about 7 tables at this point and two servers who were hostessing, taking orders, serving, and closing checks.  They need to step their game up on cooking time, hire some more (experienced and friendlier staff that knows how to smile) staff, and find a better sauce for their seafood.
