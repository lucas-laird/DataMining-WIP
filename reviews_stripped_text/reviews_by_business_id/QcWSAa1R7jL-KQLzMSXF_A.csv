You can see them cooking the meats on the grills and their pricing was better than their competitors.

The potatoes were crispy, but a bit greasy on the bottom and pork was really good, but the carne asada was just okay. It seemed like they didn't give us the fresh carne because the meat we got was from the back instead of the grill.",LMPWMy_kvHjlUzVQ_9jz6A,7,5,3,4ZwQcBNp7LIPxfAW0dHL5w

Can't knock them on presentation. My fault with their food is in preparation. The sauce they brought wasn't just plain, it was outright bland and option for anything different. One sauce period. The big one though was a BBQ cardinal sin. They left the silverback membrane on their pork ribs. That membrane when smoked leaves a plastic type of texture on the back of the rib. Gristle between your teeth if you bite into it. Their ribbon fries were a hit with us but portion of carne asade was skimpy. Can't go higher than 2 stars.",f5Wj7qcQCX_mSdKnRQTD_A,0,0,2,xeHZ2um8Af6A13JJdsckmA

It appeared that everyone loved the ribbon fries. I unfortunately wasn't able to try them because there was other food from other countries that I tried first. I did have their ribs and I must say they were good but I wasn't too impressed with the sauce. I saw them pouring it out of some generic, possibly from smart & final, sauce out of a plastic jug. The bbq sauce is just as important as the cooking. The sauce is usually a prized recipe that's kept away from everyone like the krabby patty recipe. Again, they were under the gun at this rugby tournament with long lines and possibly cut some corners to be able to feed the masses (& they had long lines of customers). I still wanna get my hands on those ribbon fries. I just hope that generic bbq sauce is not the norm for you guys.",mH_D6qR2NXZkNrzTxYKkyg,0,0,4,YOm6DAbmicG1_29qjZtTAQ
