Never a problem with my order and the staff at the window always friendly.    Never been inside because after hitting the drive-thru, I really enjoy rolling over to US Airways Air Cargo parking lot off of Surrey & Patrick and enjoy watching the jets coming and going. I have fond memories of really going overboard with my DT orders but as I grow older and food costs have gone up, my orders are more streamlined now. It is healthier and it keeps the car cleaner.",HJj82f-csBI7jjgenwqhvw,5,6,4,k0WH3HI5nmeSF-iJyeEQEQ

We ordered red bean and cheese burritos with extra cheese. Wow they loaded them with cheese!! 
For a quick bite this place is pretty good.",UlsZJ618qrY5W6NIcHk8pA,1,1,4,2cnnO4pTyCeGiaOjC3Whqg
1912181,2012-08-24,0,mKNzA_CjO3NXcCn9RphHiw,OK so I was a little nervous going in there... I mean my picture is on my yelp profile... What could they do to my food to make me not come back.  But!  I went to the manager on swing shift and showed her my yelp review.  My fries have been better but still not AWESOME!,LuFNX3TMX2cvm-lNJXyyZA,0,0,4,2x9Wvga5osAuqv9gCinRqA

3324733,2018-01-14,0,mKNzA_CjO3NXcCn9RphHiw,Queso nachos with beef is great. The Veggie works burrito needs lots of work. More flour tortilla than the middle beef and bean thats just ploped on the bottome leaving the middle with nothing but lettuce and tortilla.,FT-G28ekjjb3draGTHCmDw,0,0,2,bHMbCkQw5r5bsI9OIAzqGg

4576551,2012-01-11,0,mKNzA_CjO3NXcCn9RphHiw,This is the best Del Taco in Las Vegas! The service is always great and the food is always hot and fresh. The only complaint is that it is in the flight path of the airport so occasionally a 747 will fly overhead and make your drink shake...,eXVdbhzZGvIVbqVJzP2bxQ,1,0,4,9LGEodPWlQ0puPwsrdIf0Q
4642258,2017-12-11,0,mKNzA_CjO3NXcCn9RphHiw,The worst drive-thru! I've come here on several occasions and each time I've had to wait for at least 20 minutes for my food. I feel like I've been hijacked into this line . No Escape . The slowest service ever!,8GmEgoyBDVmsQZNpKoo6Cg,0,0,1,oQiOSOHhKDY-2mj21bADaw

Just now I ate here. I was not impressed. I just got off work, and was running errands at McCarren Center. I was hungry and exhausted, and could not wait out the walk to the Walmart McDonald's.
  So there in front of me was a Del Taco sign promoting a shrimp and fries meal. I can tell you that this was in reality average tasting fries with a few small fried shrimp. I should have taken a picture of it. As far as taste, I rate it on a par with a frozen dinner. 
  I have been to Del Taco in the past. In my opinion their cheeseburger is tasty. In general I will eat here when I get in the mood for their cheeseburger.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,0,0,2,gdkBOjRfk1O-DbNxe6pquA
