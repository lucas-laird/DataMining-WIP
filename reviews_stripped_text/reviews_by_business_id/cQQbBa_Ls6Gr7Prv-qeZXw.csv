I tried to get a sauce to add flavor to my boring sandwich and the employee offered me the pesto.... It was watered down and had zero taste.... I spent almost 10 dollars on a breakfast sandwich and a caramel latte that was also so bad I threw away!!! I never throw my lattes away.... This was my second time ever being there.... I gave you another chance, but no more..",89jyGlrPsoHF074gqtIbXQ,0,0,2,gEw1uOHLrgOXfqlIPoiT7A
2009698,2014-07-27,0,cQQbBa_Ls6Gr7Prv-qeZXw,I've been coming to this Panara Bread location for some time. The food is ALWAYS fresh!! Today I had the Lemon Chicken Orso soup and a Greek salad :)) yummy!! Not to mention when you get a Panara Bread card you earn food. Today I received a free cheese Danish. Feeling Happy!,UmpKTuYxZSSxQUd-XMIKcg,0,0,5,c7T4pYX-LmZ3KZKgLCJGaA

I prefer to just order online then go through the hassle of waiting in line.,fxrQSMhHlBv6eJVRdchG9Q,1,1,3,Tl6nuaYQZwDHGTcjUClpeA
