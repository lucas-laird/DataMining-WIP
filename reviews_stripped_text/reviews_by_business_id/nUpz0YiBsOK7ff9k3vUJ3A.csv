Our waiter was beyond terrible though. It wasn't one specific thing, just a lot of little things that added up to a poor experience. 
The bus boy/bread deliverer/water guy was great, and that's the only thing I can say positively about the place. At these prices, we definitely won't be back.",AdxhlxXSGjRsCQxG6ZjfTw,1,0,2,PyOqQfXAIDGpM1S759W0Xg

My husband and I decided to share an antipasto and a pasta. We started with Grandma's Meatballs. I typically don't like red sauce or meatballs but this was soo soo good. 
Then came Nona's Lasagna Al Forgo. They gave it to us in 2 separate dishes which made it a lot easier to share. The portion size was extremely generous especially for lunch.

I had reservations for Friday (11/28/14) night at 6:15. They had a table for me but it was not in the main dining area. I asked to be moved to the main area but was told I would have to wait. The GM Adam came right over and asked if we could wait about 5 minutes and he personally would get find me a table. He found one for us in about 3 minutes. 

Adam spent about 5 minutes with us going over the menu with us and telling us the history of the restaurant and Buddy. After we got our drinks, Adam came buy again and was going to take our order but we told him we could wait for our server. Adam was very personable and made sure we were taken care of. Way beyond your typical GM.

This restaurant cannot compete with anything else nearby.  Maggiano's -fabulous, Brio - lovely, Buddy V's -meh.  We had the meatball sand and the vodka sauce pasta.  Both were bland, small and overpriced ($23 for a very small plate of pasta.). No hot bread and butter, no attentive wait staff, no one asked how are meals were, we were invisible.  Then we come to the real reason we went - the lobster tail pastry.  At $15 we were sure it would be crazy good.  It wasn't. The cream inside was luscious and the presentation was beautiful, but the pastry itself was so hard and overcooked we couldn't cut it and that made sharing difficult.  Worst of all, I left my commemorative photo of my little girl and I from  the National Geographic exhibit on the table.  When we realized this 2 hours later we rushed back to the restaurant.  They had thrown it out!  Who doesn't keep people's forgotten things for at least the rest of the day?!

This is one of the few restaurants on the strip that actually has real windows to the outside world (no fake ceiling here) which was refreshing. A little loud in the dining room - but then is Vegas known for being quiet? 
We had:
Salumi plate- salumi was terrific, cheeses better than average, olives OK
Eggplant parm- on app menu & can be shared even though waitress said it was too small for sharing. Easily enough for 6 to share
Scallopps- not very Italian, was it bacon? too over cooked but polenta & scallopps were perfect
The lasagne was HUGE & very good.
Kids chix parm was a large sized portion and excellent. 
Chix marsala came with 3 pieces of chicken!
Ceasar Salad was tastey but way over dressed. Very soggy. Ask for less dressing.
With a bottle of wine & tip our meal for 6 was $300. Not an inexpensive night out so don't be misled by the lower $ on yelp.

The octopus and tuna caponata are also delicious and the polenta croutons on the Caesar Salad are delicious! I've never seen polenta croutons in all the Italian restaurants I've dined in.

Dessert is also a must, I mean it is the Cake Boss' restaurant. The lobster tail is light and crispy and the tiramisu is soooo good with the chocolate cake on the bottom.

A group of us decided to give it a try last week.  We got right in and the service was fast.  The server knew nothing about where she worked nor any details about the cake boss himself or the famous bakery across the hall.  We informed her as to who Buddy is.  Bad start for this employee we thought.

Later that night we decided to give the bakery a try and experience the famous treats we had only seen on the TV show.  We waited in the long line and ordered our treats.  After we paid, I heard some construction noise and realized that a construction person was knocking bricks off the wall some 15 feet behind us.  In fact the debris actually hit one of our guests.  In the small bakery their is a small bar to sit at, but in this case that was even closer to the construction guy.  We asked the cashier if we could sit across the hall at the Buddy V's to enjoy our treats.  She said ok but to inform the host.

We crossed the hall and asked the host if we could sit in the dining area that was in the hall, she said no that area was closed.  The restaurant was near empty and I clearly pointed out the construction mess as it was only 30 feet across the hall.  I then asked if we could sit anywhere inside to eat our already paid for treats.  She said no, I should go eat it at the bar inside the bakery.  Needless to say we left and found some tables out in the mall.  

I can not believe that the same establishment from across I the hall would treat people so negatively.  I will not return given their lack of service.  Too bad, the food was pretty good.  They really need some training as to who they work for as well as the true value of a customer.  I will never go back for that reason.",h2Bp8hJT-u9PddFv9zgnog,0,0,2,vEtqPQ9aVv-A1-brZ9j29g

The hostess enthusiastically escorted us to the sexy lounge area adjacent to the dining area.
This is not your typical ""sit at the bar"" experience, it's more like a ""VIP club experience"" with stellar views of the strip. Our super friendly waitress made our experience memorable. The food is totally authentic grandma cooking & the prosecco is a delicious brut, not sweet. The drinks were $4 & the appetizers were $5.
 Just as we couldn't drink or eat another bite, my husband was closing the tab & we quickly realized WTF are we doing turning down desert?? We are in the cake boss restaurant. As we were deciding between cannoli's or tiramisu, our adorable waitress suggested the Nutella cake with espresso ice cream. What a slice of heaven!!!!!!

As soon as the bubbly started to hit, an amazing jazz band ( The fabulous baker boys) arrived & blew us away with their great jazz/Italian hits. They were more than happy to accommodate requests. Dino, Frank, Bobby Darin, they know it!

It's not that we didn't think it would be good, but didn't want to go to yet another celebrity-associated restaurant. Enough with the names and prices to go with it. We were pleasantly surprised at how much we enjoyed it. 

There was a wait at 8pm on a Sunday night, so reservations help. We were told the wait would be an hour. We made reservations on-line and only waited 25 minuets! 

The decor is nice-- the ceiling light fixtures are cool. Big whisk attachments-cool use for them. They have an open kitchen and it smells wonderful. Lots of red and dark wood, feels very comfortable. 

We ordered a Caesar salad, garlic bread and panzenella salad to start. The Caesar salad was the best I've had in a long time. Very garlicky, croutons that were warm, soft with a little crunch and a hint of fennel in the salad.  Just the perfect amount of fresh Parmesan cheese. The panzenella was delicious with the same lovely bread, fresh tomatoes and a great dressing. The garlic bread was cheesy, dense and delicious. Just like you imagine good garlic cheese bread should be. 

For dinner, we ordered the spaghetti Bolognese ( for the little one), lasagna, and the Sunday Gravy. The little one wanted lasagna instead, so I traded with him. The kids' spaghetti was plenty for an adult ( I left half of it at that) and incredible. Some of the best I've had that I can remember. The lasagna, although expensive for what it is, was equally delicious. Baked in a cast-iron pan, it was warm, gooey and delicious, with a light tomato sauce on top. The Sunday Gravy was good, but he agreed that  the Bolognese and lasagna were infinitely better. 

We didn't order dessert, but those around us who ordered got cannoli, which looked fantastic. By the way, Carlo's Bakery is across from Buddy V's if you want something for later.

I didn't like how they didn't give us bread but instead some type of cracker. We were hungry, so we munched on until we saw our entrees.

The meatball sub was decent looking with seasoned fries. The fries were tasty, but the meatball sub wasn't worth the money. It was tiny and tasted like it had been heated in the microwave. It was still passable if it was about $10.

The caprese salad was not worth the $16 we paid. From left to right were a whole tomato, a small blob of caprese, about 12 cherry tomato halves drenched in dressing, and a spinach leaf. It was the tiniest salad I've ever eaten. Wasn't that good and definitely not worth the money.

Once we were seated though the place was great. Service was good though a bit slow at times, the waiter was really passionate about the food and was able to recommend several options for my parents who don't normally eat Italian. 

We ordered the osso buco, the shrimp scampi, and the gravy with rigatoni. All the food came out hot, and parmesan was very quick to be offered.

The food tasted great. Like the waiter said, the osso buco literally fell off the bone, I didn't need the knife at all. It was a bit oily, but otherwise very good. The polenta it was served with was creamy and well seasoned. I felt some vegetables/salad would have gone down nicely, but it was very good overall.

The shrimp scampi tasted very good, but the pasta seemed slightly overcooked (by maybe half a minute) and the sauce a little scarce. Flavour wise it was brilliant. 

The gravy was probably the least impressive in my opinion, the sauce just needed something extra in terms of flavour to really make the meat stand out.

Portion sizes were generous, originally we were keen for dessert or a visit to the cake store just opposite, but it was a bit too much. 

Overall it was a very good meal and one of the few decent Italian places I've been to in Vegas or anywhere else and it shows in how busy they were, but it seemed slightly let down by some small details.",gQGKrlTdy-G1GAcHnYrUPg,0,0,4,QxoLE7EqTqGbwC72RnXAtA

I would like to start off and say that we are lenient when it comes to services.  It is a very hard job and not everyone is cut out for the job and unfortunately Perry M. at Buddy V's is one of them.  
Our evening started out with us walking up to the hostess station around 5:15 that Sunday evening.  We asked the two ladies if we could have a window table.  They stated it was going to be about 20 to 30 minutes.  We stated no problem that we will go to the bar and have a drink to please come over and get us when the table was ready.  They stated that was fine.  We ordered two drinks at the bar and about 20 minutes later we saw two tables being cleaned at the window area.  So my husband was paying close attention and before we knew it the hostess was taking up a couple that had just arrived.  Luckily a table was being cleared up behind them so my husband had to go grab the hostess to remind her of our table.  She then remembered we were waiting and sat us down.  Point being, if my husband wasn't keeping an eye out we would have lost those window seats we were waiting on.  
Now on to our next adventure, we meet our waiter Perry M., he asked if we wanted water and we stated we did.  The assistant waiter came through and gave us bread and I stated thank you to him, but got no response back.  Perry then came back and got our food order.  The food came out as scheduled and was delivered by a young gentleman from the kitchen.  Our assistant waiter came by and gave us more bread and again I said Thank You with no response.  I come from the south and when someone says thank you, your response should be Your Welcome or My Pleasure.  To me this is plain rude.  Again, we are just holding our tongues in the whole situation.  My husband wanted another beer.  Ever since Perry ordered our food we never saw him again at the table to ask how everything was.  I told my husband to put the empty glass on the edge of the table maybe he will notice it and walla' he did.  My husband asked for another beer and he went on his way.  At this time our water glasses are now empty.  Well after 10 minutes still no beer has arrived at the table.  By this time the dessert has arrived and my husband and I are sharing a glass of water since we have not been refilled or asked if we wanted any.  Again, we are not saying anything.  We don't ask for much.  We know it is hectic sometimes doing this job.  We were going to let go not getting the beer, but we do like for our water to be filled up WITHOUT having to ask.  So we just asked for the bill and were just going to chalk it up to bad experience and not return.  Until our bill came, the first two charges are for the restaurant week special at 30.14 per person (which is correct).  Then two additional entrees where added and the kicker was he added the beer that never arrived.  Our total check should be in the range of 60+ change, but the total was 122.00.  So that is the point my husband lost it and grabbed the manager.  
The manager that night was Sean Fiori whom assisted us.  We explained everything to him expect the experience with the hostess earlier.  We explained our experience with Perry M and his assistant.  We showed him the bill and he immediately apologized and said he will fix the bill and gave us an after dinner drink to make up for not getting the beer.  We are not people to complain.  We put up with a lot from waiters/waitress, but this was awful.  We are simple people and want to be acknowledged and respected and just fill up our drinks every now and then.  Literally he orders our food and gave us the messed up bill.  That was all and wants us to tip you on this service.  Don't get me wrong.  We had no problems with the food, but the service made this experience awful.  Hopefully he gets continued training or he needs to find another profession.",EsIKccnUt3sC90H75eFsMg,2,0,1,245Dq2sDXanq4QBmJ8JBjQ

530033,2016-11-13,0,nUpz0YiBsOK7ff9k3vUJ3A,"Phenomenal Italian food, which is what you might expect from a unique restaurant owned by an Italian family. The staff was wonderful as well, from the hosts at the front all the way to the manager who greeted us and had a minute or two conversation with us. 

The menu suits itself to family style dining. My wife and I each had drinks, split garlic bread with oil and vinegar, and the pollo rigatoni alla vodka, which is one of the best dishes I've ever eaten. The polenta croutons on the Caesar salad must be tried to be believed. The salad looks so simple that you might be disappointed when it comes to the table vs. my wife's house salad with beautiful heirloom tomatoes, but both were exceptional.

Contrary to many of the reviews I read, they do bring some small bread. Thinking that we didn't, we ordered the garlic bread, which could easily be split between 4-6 people. It was a little much, and if I did it over, I'd leave off the garlic bread and order dessert. We were simply too full! 

I'd you're looking for phenomenal food that's not terribly expensive (with drinks and all we were under $80), don't even give it a second thought, and come here. You may want to reserve your table through open table or something similar to get in quickly. Our reservation was delivered exactly on time.",ll8hskbwQs03lq9cWia2aw,0,1,5,F8IEwSz9FhHyzpm0pVqkiw

Bobby V's was one of the eatery's I specifically wanted to visit while we were here. Upon being seated we were met with welcoming and friendly customer/guest service. 
Caleb was our server and hit a Grand Slam in doing so. He was very attentive to our request and even provided suggestions when I seemed unsure. 
I ordered the Tomato & Basil soup and my wife ordered the  Aunt Nina's Mozzarella en Carozza for appetizers. At first bite, the authenticity of the food was evident and the Riesling and Moscato wine that followed were right on time. 
Shortly after finishing the appetizers, our entrees showed up and my wife's Capellini Shrimp Scampi and my Nonna's Lasagna Al Forno  dishes pushed the experience over the top. 
All the while being treated like relatives by Adam, the Asst. General Manager. I pulled Adam to the side and mentioned that I had a confession and that was, that my wife and I eat out a lot, while home and this was the best all around experience we've had in a long time and thanked him for the wonderful experience. 
The cherry on top was when they brought out a piece of Chocolate Expresso cake, on the house, for the Mrs.'s birthday and a couple of lattes.
This customer service is what I strive to exemplify in my own business at Ambassador Barbershop, Atlanta, GA, because long term relationships are better than short term money, any day.

Our server greeted us shortly thereafter.  The menu has such a great variety of classic  Italian staples. It was hard to decide what we were going to eat.  For the appetizer, we ordered Mozzarella en Carozza (""mozzarella in a carriage"").  Hands down, this was the most delicious appetizer we've had in such a long time.  The crust was nice and crispy.  But the gravy (sauce) just took it over the top.  It was so full of flavor.  It was a nice balance of tomatoes and basil.
 
For the main course, my hubby ordered the Sunday Gravy.  I loved the presentation.  They served the meat in a separate metal pot.  Plenty of sausage, lamb necks, pork and meatballs.  It's served with rigatoni.  This entrée was so tasty that we immediately started looking for the recipe on the internet.  I ordered the Linguini with Clams.  It came with plenty of clams.  The portion sizes were perfect.

We were pretty stuffed by the time we were done with our meals.  However, we wanted to try a dessert while we were there.  I loved the dessert menu. It looks like a family photo album with pictures of Buddy and his family.  We selected the Italian Wedding Cake.  I didn't think I had any room for dessert.  But this little cake was so good that we knew we had to finish it all. Luckily we had a long walk ahead of us. The restaurant was at the far end of the shops in the Venetian.  We will definitely make this a must the next time we're in Las Vegas.   You should too.  We plan to try the chicken parm.  The atmosphere was what were looking for.

I must have high standards seems how I work in a restaurant but I certainly would expect more from a restaurant of its caliber and popularity. We had no greeting, no hello, no nothing. When we were seated we were handed menus and we knew it was a bit pricy before we went so that wasn't a shocker. It's the Las vegas strip and you're paying for the name. But honestly for the price and because of the name I really pictured a warm, friendly atmosphere. Not a cold environment where we were treated like we intruded and were not welcome. I felt so sad for my daughter. She was excited to go there for the amazing experience she thought she'd have and to have my 12 year old on her birthday feel so let down and disappointed about the service is very disheartening.

It reminded me of the old Villa Penza and other old school joints where the cook or the owner mingles and sits with you for a while and makes you feel at home even though they know you are leaving.  These are the special touches that made the old school joints what they were with tile floors and checkered tablecloths and the food was nectar of the gods and 'ambience' was for people who didnt know anything about food.

These elements gave us the confidence to break some rules like 'never order spaghetti and clam sauce outside of the metropolitan area'.

The simplicity of this dish was a revelation.  The DeCecco macaroni was cooked to perfection, It was the perfect platform for the teeny tiny baby clams that are mandatory for this dish and no substitutions.  The fragrance of the baby clams, the garlic, the textures, it was just magnificent and like no other commercially prepared dish we have had in years.  Kudos!

I dont like sitting on top of the kitchen.  Its too loud and too hot.  This was neither.  It was very entertaining.  They were loving the food they were preparing and it made you that much more excited about how good it was going to be to see this.

The veal marsala was fantastic.  It was good quality veal and the marsala was not cloying and sickeningly sweet as the cheap marsalas are.  This was proper marsala.

The osso buco was great, cooked to perfection, falling off the bone resting on a pool of creamy polenta.

I highly recommend the 'birthday cake' for dessert.  Its an experience.

While many of these authentic homestyle dishes are stylized for presentation, this is the way we really eat in  NJ.  Great meatballs.  

This visit was AFTER Gordon Ramsay Steak and in no way was it a letdown, it was right up there with GR.

Two kids got meatball sandwiches, one got the margherita pizza, and my wife and I split the salumi and cheese plate with a couple glasses of house red. Happily I got a few bites of the meatball sandwich and it was probably the best I've ever had. The salumi and cheese plate was a great split for a light meal, with excellent meats, cheeses, and I loved the olives. Not normally an olive fan. My daughter really liked the pizza, too.

The bill was about eighty five bucks and the service was good, not great.

Tip: If you want to hit the bakery, grab a number before or during your meal. There was a significant wait for the bakery, although perhaps the novelty will have worn off after a little time has passed.",KGnZERoRCA_Gv4Zw3yc8Aw,1,0,4,AN_A6I-MDaQjGcDQpMEA9g

We were there a good 20 minutes before the waiter came to take our drink orders and it went downhill from there. 

The garlic bread was disgusting, and the chicken parm tasted like a frozen TV dinner.

The atmosphere is calm and the decor is very nice. Overall, I would eat at Buddy V's again, but would order something different than spaghetti.",OQDf5SB8ambsItXlg9kevw,0,0,4,ZZroaMwlcb8-NxU6kx8kGA

Polenta was creamy and a fantastic side with the scallops and shrimp.  The sear on the scallop was just right ~ they were tender and very fresh.  For dessert I decided on the butterscotch creme brûlée - again, it was beyond perfect!  Holy cow!  Creamy, rich, just enough butterscotch flavor and the caramelized sugar on top with the pecan short bread cookies... I just couldn't stop eating-even after I was full!

992605,2015-06-22,2,nUpz0YiBsOK7ff9k3vUJ3A,"Restaurant week provided the perfect excuse to try Buddy V's. We dined with a group of nine. Service was a bit sluggish at times, but otherwise attentive. They started us with delicious herbed focaccia which paired well with oil and vinegar. I only wish they left the bottles on the table so we could help ourselves. We didn't know upon ordering, but draft beers in the 20 oz and Liter sizes come in a souvenir glass with $9 refills (the cost of a pint). So, that was a nice surprise when ordering a second round. 

The restaurant week menu is $40.15 and it came with choice of appetizer, entree and dessert. The majority of the table ordered Grandma's Meatballs, made with beef, veal and pork. They were tender and juicy, the marinara sauce was nicely balanced and flavorful. I was quite pleased. Likely, the second best meatball in town. Those that had the Panzanella Salad seemed satisfied, the mozzarella was very fresh. 

The table tried each available entree: Pasta Bolognese, Sea Bass, Carbonara, and Chicken Parmesan. Each were beautifully prepared and damn tasty. My Sea Bass was perfectly seasoned and brightened with a spritz of lemon, the side salad was fresh and light, which was welcomed since I was already pretty full. The chicken parm came with a nice helping of pasta and two lightly breaded baked cutlets topped with mozzarella and provolone cheeses. The pasta across the board was the ideal al dente. 

And for dessert we had a choice of tiramisu or cannoli. Both were well executed and scrumptious. I loved dipping the lady fingers into the layers of the creamy tiramisu. The cannoli was filled end to end with sweet ricotta; no hollow center. 

I was a little skeptical, but dinner was delicious. Many celebrity chef restaurants fail to deliver, but that's not the case here. It has good eats and casual charm. If you have the opportunity, there's still time to check out the restaurant week menu which is an absolute steal. It's well worth navigating the labyrinth that is the Venetian. Don't park at Venetian like we did, I believe Palazzo self parking would provide better access.",ZsUSGU1-L1ImomLZjXxxTg,5,3,4,fg2Y23aYsPkbaB9mbY_uxg

For appetizers, we shared the mac & cheese, salumi and mozzarella en carozza.  These were all solid dishes, with the mozzarella probably being my favorite.  Our entrees were brought out before we were even half way through the appetizers, but when I said something they took them away.  I was a little worried that our meals would be sitting under a heat lamp, but kudos to the staff for bringing us fresh dishes when the time came.
I thought the wine list was rather lame.  I like wine, but am not an expert, so when I recognize a bunch of the wines as the variety I can find at my local Smith's, I am a bit let down.  I finally ordered a bottle of an Italian variety I liked, but when it came time for the sample taste I was almost tempted to refuse it.  It wasn't spoiled, but sure did taste as though it had been stored at the wrong temperature.
For entrees, we tried the lasagne, Dad's Bucatini and spaghetti and meatballs.  Again, all the dishes were good.  I especially loved the Bucatini and would get it again.  Desserts were not quite as good as I expected.  The cannoli were fresh, but the filling was lighter than the ricotta I expected and overall had a strong cinnamon oil taste.  The Nutella cake was your standard lava cake that has been around since the 80s.  The coffee was nice and strong.",7HOTOydGS7wJYaJqNoDfeg,1,1,4,l07GlMjx8auRmxtukNrMTQ

For the service, I'll keep it short. Just our luck as first time diners to get the waitress in training on a Saturday night.  It would have been tolerable if she had any personality or acted if she even cared about our experience there.  Never engaged us, we had to continually ask for refills on water,  and brought me the wrong drink.  Trainer right at her side, for what? I blame the management and trainer for this.   Servers in training should be up to speed for the weekend dinner service before being put there.  When customers leave satisfied with the food but disgruntled over the service after paying nearly three bills for a mediocre dining experience, you end up losing a repeat customer.

1194833,2015-06-29,0,nUpz0YiBsOK7ff9k3vUJ3A,"First thing first - Standout dishes:

- Buddy's Caprese: I am normally not a fan of Caprese salads, but Buddy really nails this one. High quality ingredients, and finely tuned flavors make this a worthwhile starter.

- Cheese Ravioli: I know what you're thinking. ""I can get cheese ravioli anywhere."" Yes, you can. The great thing about the ravioli at Buddy V's, however, is that it is a perfect companion to Buddy's outstanding roasted tomato sauce. It's bright, tangy, smooth, and well rounded all at the same time. Definitely memorable fare.

- Cannoli: I am normally not what you would call a ""fan"" of cannoli, but, once again, Buddy has proved me wrong. Most cannoli, in my experience, are disappointing in their grainy, and under-sweetened filling. Not so with these cannoli. Perfectly sweetened, incredibly smooth filling paired with just the right amount of cinnamon in the pastry make these cannoli worth writing home about. (Added perk: After eating at Buddy V's, you can walk right across the hall, and buy a whole box of cannoli from Carlo's Bakery to eat back at the hotel if you are so inclined.)

Now, to business. There is definitely no shortage of Italian food on the Las Vegas Strip, but Buddy V's is definitely a major standout. Even among all of the other celebrity chef restaurants to be found in Vegas, the Cake Boss is definitely holding his own.

My wife and I stopped by for lunch one afternoon, and had a great time. Our experience was so good, though, that we went back for dinner two days later. For lunch we just stopped by, but for dinner we made reservations through OpenTable. Neither time was the place so busy one would need reservations in order to avoid a wait, however.

Here are some highlights of Buddy V's worth noting:

- The service at Buddy V's is excellent. They are easily on par with restaurants with much higher price points.

- Having worked in food service, I am hyper-sensitive about cleanliness. I had absolutely no complaints here, however. The entire restaurant is very clean, comfortable, and inviting.

- The pricing of most menu items is very reasonable in comparison with many similar Vegas eateries.

- The whiskey/scotch selection at Buddy V's bar is truly impressive. It's not hard to find a bar that serves Johnnie Walker Black anywhere, but one that serves Johnnie Walker Green, Gold, and Blue is tough to find at any price point.

- Unlike most restaurants in the Venetian, Buddy V's is right near an entrance making it an easy place to duck in for a meal without having to stray too far from the strip.

Final pro tip: Be sure to note on your reservation that you are celebrating a birthday, if that is the case. They have some fun, no-loud-obnoxious-singing-involved surprises for birthday-folk. I would imagine the same is true for most other celebrations as well.",MYpm8UbqB0Lf4O_YoP6-Ww,0,0,5,nCYlzH11Z8WdteoQwK9_rA
1199183,2014-01-04,1,nUpz0YiBsOK7ff9k3vUJ3A,"My wife and I were dying to go to Buddy's new place in Vegas. So I made reservations ahead of time and couldn't wait. We went earlier in the day just so we could know where in the mall it was located. I'm glad we did since it was off a corridor from the main forum shops. We liked how the place looked. Well set up and inviting. They had a long row of outside tables in front of the restaurant. 

So we go to the place and they found our reservation and went to seat us. They brought us into the bar and sat us in the corner with a view of the strip. I didn't mind the view but if I made reservations why was I sitting at the bar? Kinda of set the mode already. It was not to crowded for a Friday night which we were very surprised when most restaurants are hopping. There were bread stick on the table already but they were prepackaged ones and not from Italy, they were made in New Jersey. 

We wanted the best from Buddy so my wife ordered his wife's linguine and clam sauce. While I had Buddy's chicken rigatoni ""ALLA VODKA"". My wife's meal was plain and not worth the $26 that they charged for it. It tasted like my wife made it herself nothing fancy or fantastic taste. Mine had maybe 6 pieces of chicken in it and the pasta was kind of chewy. It was like my wife made it also. Not saying I wouldn't eat it but not real fine dining. We have been to several restaurants in Vegas since we go 4-6 times a year. So I'm no newbie. 

Oh I missed the garlic bread we ordered before the meal. Which consisted of three pieces for 9. Nothing special and little over priced again. My wife and I agreed Buddy should of opened a café type restaurant and not fine dining. The food is more family food but over priced for Vegas. It would be totally packed everyday if the prices were lower and family orientated. 

But not to jam on Buddy over his place. We had the Italian birthday cake and let me tell you it was no disappointment. We loved it and that what Buddy is famous for Cakes. I wish he had a bakery with the restaurant because that would go no stop. Hope this helps you guys out. thanks",l4DR96r3o5fguyezVij5iw,1,0,2,SIN1dKcUJ-NcRnCrwkTrxA

Most of the Italian restaurants we've picked thus far have been quite good.  Buddy V's received great reviews from various sites so we made reservations there and gave it a try.  It exceeded our expectations!

First timers or those not familiar with the location of restaurants in the Grand Canal Shoppes should allow time to navigate.  Buddy V's can be a bit hard to find but worth the search!  Upon entering the restaurant we found the ambiance handsome and comfortable...neither too elegant or casual.  Views of The Strip were an added bonus.   The staff was courteous and efficient.

Being Italian food aficionados, we look for entrees that'd are a flavor-packed indulgence when dining out. We asked to split the Caesar Salad, which was kindly plated on two plates, and very good.  The fresh warm cubes of polenta in place of regular croutons were a tasty option.   The warm bread that came with our meal was also very good. I ordered ""My Dad's Bucatini Carbonara"" and my husband ordered ""Valastro Sunday Gravy"" which includes meatballs, sausage, lamb, pork and a bowl of rigatoni in a delicious red sauce.  Both pasta dishes fulfilled our culinary wishes -- generous portions that were delicious!  (reasonably priced for on the Las Vegas Strip)

One of the reviews I read suggested letting them know if it's your birthday, which we did, and were treated with a delicious dessert with ""Happy Birthday"" drizzled on the plate.  Our meal was excellent from start to finish!",MLWa5lwhg7yjysOREx-knw,0,0,4,JpRvT9me8OdhUhlBmn2fPA

The ""Spaghetti Bolognese"" was incredibly basic, the sauce tasted like it came from a can, and the spaghetti noodles were simply basic. The biggest disappointment was the cannoli. Obviously I had high expectations not only because of the price, but because of the insane hype that surrounds this restaurant, because of the fact that it is owned by Buddy Valastro and family, from the show Cake Boss, which regularly features and highlights their cannolis as a staple item. It was so incredibly stale on the outside, I had to literally smack it with my knife to knock a chunk off of it to eat, which would have been okay if it wasn't just a greasy, dried up piece of crust. The filling was sub-par as well, I'd have rather had some cool whip inside there, at least it would be somewhat pleasant. Overall, the food was poor.

Service: 
The initial welcome from the host was incredible! She greeted me and inquired about anything that I am celebrating. She then very politely showed us to the table.

Nice view of the strip below, but it was so loud.  Music was already playing at a loud volume, and then it seemed as if they turned it up even more.  So no dinner conversation for us.

Lots of choices on the menu, and I almost got meatballs, but I decided to try something else.  The menu had a prix fixed dinner that included a starter, an entree, and a dessert.

My entree was the orecchiette with sausage.  It also contained broccolini and roasted tomatoes.  It was tasty and super satisfying.  My husband's entree was the steak pizzaiolo and it was served with a side of polenta.  It looked good, but my husband was not happy with it.

First, the Nutella Cake is insanely amazing! Everything else was very good as well. Honestly their kids Mac and Cheese was one of all our favorites! It should be available for adults. The meatballs were prefect. Loved the flavor combination of the chopped salad but my 19 year old daughter who likes things simple, thought it was too much.

We were running a bit late so we called the restaurant and they were so nice and had no issues pushing our reservation back by about 15 minutes.

Once seated we ordered some wine and sparkling water. I know this is something very minor but I loved that the sparkling water was nice and cold -- you'd be surprised how many restaurants give it at room temperature. We immediately ordered entrees and I ordered the Chicken Rigatoni Alla Vodka and my friend ordered the Bucatini Carbonara. Both of them were so so good. My Rigatoni had just the right amount of sauce and it was incredibly flavorful and they gave Parmesan cheese and red chili flakes on top and that just added the perfect touch. I had a few bites of my friends Bucatini and it was so delicious -- usually restaurants use spaghetti to make Carbonara but using Bucatini was such a great touch. I love that the egg was mixed perfectly in without scrambling it. My only regret is that I wish we had been more hungry to eat more!

We started out with the cheesy garlic bread, which was huge and quite good.  We also had the meatballs, which were very flavorful and the red sauce was delicious.

I had the linguini vongole, which is my go to usually, and I thought it was fresh and well flavored, and not overly oily (my sometimes complaint).

We finished with a plate of all of their desserts, and every single one was good.  I think the cannoli may have been my favorite.

Who wasn't even our waiter.  We made a reservation and were seated at one of the two chef's tables.  After giving us the details on the family style meal not on the menu our waiter filled our drinks.  Then we met Kaleb... Nope not our waiter.  He informed us we were being moved because they wanted to use our table for a 12 top.  There were six of us.  He didn't ask he told us we needed to get up and move and leave our drinks on the table.   We asked what was going on.  He just kept saying we had to move.  So as we were being basically pushed to another table at the back of the place he was being a jerk through the process.  Then he tried to switch us from the lunch menu to he dinner menu without explaining what the difference was.  Also telling us he would get a free desert for one of us.  Apparently the menu change is basically a higher price and more items.  Luckily he wasn't going to be our waiter at the new table.  As most should do we called the manager over.  He apologizes and asks us if we want a different table.   Which we didn't care about the table.  He was missing the point Kaleb was being a jerk.  He offered at least free desert to all of us.  We even confirmed it was all of us and not one of us.   Our waitress Kristy... Was amazing!!! So again take note this 1 star rating is not the norm... we generally would give it 5.  Kaleb should get a 0.  Even a few of the staff agreed and confirmed Kaleb was a jerk.  The manager was subpar.  When ordering the apparently free desert we were told it was for 4 of us.   Our waitress went and made sure it was adjusted to what was promised.  Again, We would request Kristy because her service was amazing and she dealt with the situation better than the manager.  When we left 2 hours in... The 12 top never showed up.  We were going to order the family dinner.  So they lost out on probably twice bill and still would have been able to seat the 12 top.  When we told the manager on the way out that that party never showed he said they had to save the reservation and we should be happy because he bought us over $100 worth of desert.  We reminded him that 6 people x $9 doesn't quite equal that.  He says ... ""Well I tried."" We didn't care about the free desert.  It was how the restaurant handled it.  The point is how this situation was handled.  In our opinion ... It was terrible.",82H6juBOsXs7Q-qAlP29Aw,0,0,1,KH_WzWr_LTyIuPH_kNjGgw

Anyways let me tell you why this place is amazing.

Service:

It was lunch, so we got in really quickly. We asked to be seated at a window and they did just that! The servers were all really nice and were happy to be doing their job. One plus is that I was really thirsty at the time and they were on top of refilling my water. (5 out of 5 stars)

Ambiance:

It's really beautiful in here. When you sit inside it feels nothing like the craziness of Vegas. It's so nicely decorated in here, and it's huge so you get seated quickly as well as you don't feel crammed or packed! (5 out of 5 stars)

Food:

So we were sinners and had dessert before lunch (to be fair we didn't have breakfast). I said to my family, ""if the eclair is this amazing, then I'd love to see what the restaurant is like."" My dad wanted to go elsewhere, but I made him come here and all of us were drawn by the selection on the menu. We all ended up ordering Philly Cheesesteaks. Let me tell you, that was probably one of the best Philly Cheesesteaks I've ever had in my life! So flavorful! There were other things on the menu too, like chicken parmesan, pastas, and lasagnas that I saw people eating nearby which all looked amazing! (5 out of 5 stars)

Pros

Macaroni & Cheese Carbonara: One of the most decadent and rich mac & cheese I've had. Although the pancetta was lacking, the cheese sauce was pure heaven and the penne pasta was cooked just right. 

Aunt Nina's Mozzarella Corozza: It's pretty much a delicious version of the grilled cheese sandwich filled with plenty of mozzarella and pesto that is placed on a chunky bed of ragu. The only dislike I had about this appetizer was that the sandwich was drench in too much olive oil for grilling. 

Margherita Pizza: A simple pie that was baked to perfection with a perfect ratio of mozzarella, tomato, and basil. 

Overall great dining experience with delicious food to start off the day. I definitely will return and also will be saving room for dessert to try out his popular bakery, Carlo's Bakery that is located across the restaurant.",-pzlhxN6-DtuvpX4blnTxw,8,9,4,sPBz5HutZeDzJ0JOW-doRA

The staff greeted us warmly, suggested we take a window seat with a great view of the strip and were responsive and attentive during our meal.  My husband and I ordered the three course express lunch, which was an incredible value at $22 by Vegas standards. I had the panzanella salad and found it to be superb. My husband had the Caesar salad served with polenta croutons, which was pure deliciousness. For our entrees, we both had the chicken Parmesan, again delicious . The lunch portion was so generous, that we could have easy shared one order. We looked forward to the dessert, as that is what Buddy V is known for. We were not disappointed: the cannoli was heavenly on its own, but the dark chocolate sauce put it over the top. Hubby had the salted caramel gelato served with biscotti. Good, but no competition with the cannoli.

We passed on dessert in order to gamble sooner.  Overall, the food was ok but the price for what we got was too expensive.

1506618,2015-10-16,1,nUpz0YiBsOK7ff9k3vUJ3A,"Not as pleased as I thought I would be!

Came here for a birthday celebration while in Vegas and was let down.

Got here on a Saturday evening ready to feast and was seated promptly after waiting for the rest of my party to arrive. The hostess lead my group to a table by the window and we were seated and given menus.

The items on the menu seemed really good. I knew I wanted something with sausage while the rest of group went with the steaks and spaghetti. The first issue came when everyone had decided on what they wanted and they server took 20 minutes to come back to the table to take our order. That was somewhat odd especially since when the drink was taken he overlooked my order, seriously!!!! I had to ask another waiter who was helping another table to grab my drink, that's not good.

Next, when the waiter did eventually come over to take our orders he insisted on orders rather than giving recommendations, hmmmm, not smooth! The issue with the orders was that everyone's order was taken except for one but that member of my party could not order because the waiter has walked away after getting the 5th order. Why would you do that when there is another person at the table!!! Once again, we had to get another waiter to add another steak to our order because our waiter was unable to do that the first time!!

As for the food, my meal was great. Everyone that ordered a steak loved their food. However, the spaghetti, I was informed, was a bit sour! I did not try it but I told by another member of my dinner party. 

Once finished with our food. We had to wait another 20 minutes before we could get the check. Getting the check went like this. In finally getting the attention of the waiter I got two words out asking for the check and then he interrupted and didn't let me finish to offer dessert. Seriously, usually there is a back and forth in communication but this guy had to speak over me, confusing to me! Again, he was insistent about getting a dessert rather than suggesting or recommending. 

Once I finally got the check everyone was ready to go because this waiter was just no helpful in explaining anything or being attentive to our party. Not a memorable birthday dinner for the birthday girl after talking with her about her dinner. She liked the food but the service a bit aggressive. I guess working here causes the workers to be impatient and overbearing. I don't think so because the other waiters that I talked to were very gracious about assisting my table. I think the gentleman that helped us that evening was just trying way to hard and no making a good impression. 

The food was fine but the service was below what I expected based the reviewed I have heard about Buddy V's. I wanted to 5 star this place but the service killed that potential rating. I hope this situation does not happen to anyone else. But, kudos to the chefs in the kitchen who worked hard to prepare the food.

Buddy's Salumi and Cheese Board: damn yo this was real good. I didn't care for the olives but I'm not a fan of them anyway. The meats and cheeses I could have ate all day.

Orecchiette and Italian Sausage: This dish had sausage in its name so I ordered it. It was not as heavy as a spaghetti with sauce which was nice. I ate every bite and would order it again. 

Spaghetti Bolognese: I was very surprised to like this. When it came out I expected some sort of red sauce on it but that wasn't the case. My wife took a bite and really liked the taste too. Winner winner bolognese dinner!

Lisa's Warm Nutella Cake: Came with salted caramel ice cream. This was hot and good and everyone should order it. 

Zeppole: I guess a spiced sugar is outside of these but I didn't taste anything but fried dough. I didn't like this.",eytpwJXgg5nWU6jrlQ6qAA,17,16,5,wPCP9KX0vi_bpWoo0vYNaw

Chicken parmigiana- a bit bland chicken. Needs a bit more spices. Still good to eat though! Spaghetti was yummy! Some Italian places make this dish too salty so I preferred it more bland and adding a bit of salt. 

Prime rib- yes, at an Italian restaurant. Not the best to order but it was a prix fixe meal so we tried it. Prime rib was also a bit bland, but again, better than salty, which I've gotten too. 

Lou's gravy- meat lovers would love this one! All kinds of meats- sausage, meatballs, lamb, I forgot the others. Husband loved it! He said it was actually too much meat. That's not often heard of. 

Clam spaghetti- seasoned on the bland side again but clams were juicy and not chewy. 

Garlic cheese bread- now that was delicious!! I could have more of that!! We're ordering more of that next time. 

Customer service- 5 star rating!! The young gentleman was very accommodating. He was so patient with my son too. When asked why there was no star on the Xmas tree, he said he wasn't sure but he would look into getting one next year. He then took my son to see a bigger tree at the back of the restaurant to check for a star. He said he'd tell the manager that that tree needed one too after confirming with my son. The extra help in getting out dishes and filling our cups were so ""johnny on the spot"" too!!! Loved every bit of the wait staff!!!!!",7jLbsvtBHy43r_68JDfEbQ,0,0,4,UiFgqDD6jT1RE4C2S5B4Vw

The warm, complimentary focaccia bread is always a hit and we've had the calamari and caesar salad which were great.

Then we figure out the gnocchi isn't coming. We eat the ricotta and both think the cheese is bland too!

Sevice has been good, no problems in that area. My one complaint was the first time I went I got breadsticks, second time none. I am not a fan of Cake Boss so I was really just there for the food, next time I might try something different like chicken parm.

I got the salad panzanella, margherita pizza and cannoli. Everything was great. I would have liked more fresh mozzarella on the salad because it was so good.

The lasagna, Caesar salad, house salad, and cannoli were all delicious and a highlight of our visit. The chicken parm, unfortunately, was disappointing. There was barely any marinara sauce present and the chicken was not soft and succulent like I've come to expect from excellent Italian-American joints in the New York area.

The red and white checkered tablecloths on the tables in front of the restaurant made it obvious we had arrived. 

Buddy's is very spacious inside. I loved the decor of lights made with whisks from large mixers. Also, the rolling pins hanging and bundt pans were so creative. It felt very cozy and welcoming. 

On to the food! There were breadsticks waiting on the table. We were pleasantly surprised when they brought out olive oil and balsamic with warm focaccia bread...melted in your mouth. The bread was so soft, yet crunchy at the same time! We ordered the meatball sub with Tuscan fries, the Margherita pizza and kids spaghetti with tomato sauce. The Margherita pizza wasn't exactly as thin as most that I've had but very good! The crust was soft and a little thicker with chunks of tomatoes and fresh basil. My daughter ate so much spaghetti she couldn't believe how good it was. 

On to dessert! I loved how the dessert menu had pictures of Buddy's family, so sweet! We opted for the warm Nutella chocolate melting cake with salted Carmel ice cream. Words cannot even describe...we fought over it with our forks...it almost got ugly. There was not a crumb left. 

The service was great. I wanna come back for dinner now!

When we were to be seated, the hostess tried to sit us right opposite the open kitchen, which is brightly lit, noisy, steamy and certainly not where we wanted to be. She then went back to see where else we sit and we got a table for 2 in the bar. The food was good. Foccacia was warm and they offered oil and vinegar as well as butter. We found the service was fast, maybe a bit too fast.  Maybe Saturday night is a busy one,and they try to move their diners along. We had the beef medallion, $38, cooked a little too rare for medium, but it was tasty. The mashed potatoes and sauteed spinach that it was placed on, could have been a bit more generous. Very skimpy on those portions. We also had the price fixed dinner for $38, which gave you choices. We had: Grandma's meatballs, chicken parm with spaghetti and they were tasty but they skimped on the sauce so although it was good, it could have been better. The chicken parm was very crispy and tender but the spaghetti was a bit dry. The meatballs had a nice portion of sauce served with them, so we should have kept that dish, just for the leftover sauce. The desserts you could choose was a cannoli or a Nutella cake with salted carmel ice cream.  Nah...didn't appeal to us, but we were told you couldn't substitute from that menu.  Really?  I can understand the entrees but the desserts? We were told that they had a 'full dessert menu' but our waitress never offered to show it to us. Carlo's Bakery is right across the hall from the restaurant, but by the time our meal was done, so were we. There was quite a long line waiting to get into the bakery, and it wasn't moving very quickly.  What we did notice, was that when you go to sit at the bar, there are 2 steps up, and there is no handrail in the middle of this wide expanse. We saw two patrons stumble, and one of the waiters actually took a flat out fall. We may go back to give Buddy V's another try and since we now know the lay of the land, so to speak, we will be specific about where we want to be seated, and will order with a request for ""additional sauce on the side"".

1932486,2014-01-12,1,nUpz0YiBsOK7ff9k3vUJ3A,"So the wife and I went to Buddy V's last night and here are my thoughts.  Overall it was a good dining experience, but not a great one.  I wasn't bowled over by either the service or the food, (except for the desert).  It was just kind of okay and most likely won't go back.
First off, the restaurant is tucked away in a spot that has a fantastic view of the Strip, but the internal design was emotionally cold.  I want an Italian-American restaurant to be warm and inviting and this place was trying too hard to be fancy, (which is most likely a result of its being in the Venetian). 
We didn't order any appetizers but for entrees my wife had the Veal Marsala and I had the Chicken Parm.  My wife and I both loved the taste of our meals.  They were both well prepared but both were a bit on the small side for the money they are charging. The Chicken Parm had only two cutlets and the side of spaghetti was only about a half a cup's worth.  Same with the wife's dish.  Like I said both tasted real good, but not really any better than any other Italian joint in town. Also, they give you fancy Focaccia bread with dinner.  Sadly they offer no butter or Olive oil to go with it and really, the bread had a distinctive taste to it, which made it non-optimal for dipping.  I'd rather have warm, fresh, and plain Italian bread over the fancy stuff. 
For desert we shared a Tiramisu and that was fantastic.  The quality and taste of it was spot on.  
As far as the service, the wait staff was very attentive.  Our waiter was professional but a bit stoic.  
We probably won't go back because I can get just as good Italian food from a local spot 10 minutes from my house but the desert was great so maybe it's worth it to try lunch there instead of dinner paired with desert.",V_JMMYKw5RE9taNe8owAgw,2,0,2,t1or1PGshrDYYrH6-kSrBw

We each ordered a sangria which shockingly were only $4 each since it was happy hour. They were delicious. Lots of good fruit in them. They were not cheapened because of HR.
 
We each ordered the same dinner, the rigatoni with lamb, pork, meatballs. and sausage. At a $26 price tag, I was very happy. Most Strip Italian places will charge $18+ just a plate of spaghetti alone. We meats were tender and delicious as was the sauce. The pasta, cook perfectly.

You may be shocked by the prices at first (well probably not it is Vegas), but the dishes are served family style. Yes, you can realistically share a dish with someone else. (My exception to this would be the spaghetti.) The Cesar salad was crisp and coated in dressing and could easily be split between two or three. There are very few options for vegan's or people who don't want dairy, but you can opt for the Spaghetti Pomodoro. Usually, I do not like spaghetti at restaurants because most of the time I can DIY. However, the flavors of the sauce were fantastic. Super tasty my only gripe is that in comparison to everything else the portions were tiny. Luckily you can load up on the deliciously garlicky, buttery, and cheesy bread.
This place seems to stay pretty busy, so get there early. In a world of lackluster name driven Chef restaurants don't be affraid to take a chace on Buddy V's Ristorante.",Qpp-bP3e99Oq52BONFDLkA,0,0,4,sACWexSVjbuqt_UPkDYq0Q
1962324,2017-01-29,0,nUpz0YiBsOK7ff9k3vUJ3A,"Came in with my boyfriend for my birthday on January 19th. We had reservations at 7:00 and even though we were about 10 minutes early we were seated right away. I really liked our table as it was right next to the window overlooking the Strip. The restaurant was busy but not overly packed. 

This is where it started to go downhill. We sat for almost 15 minutes before my boyfriend had to flag down a busser to ask him to call our server. We hadn't even been poured water or given bread at all. The busser was nice enough to bring us both, telling us that our server would be right with us. 20 minutes goes by before our server even acknowledged our presence. What was really disturbing was that she was the waitress for the table directly next to us and had been walking right past us and using the register right next to us the whole time! I would not expect service like that from this type of establishment. Especially when it wasn't even very busy. 

We ordered the mac 'n' cheese carbonara for an appetizer and it did not disappoint. It was very tasty and just the right portion size for the two of us. I decided on the chicken parmesan while my boyfriend got the spaghetti and meatballs. The food came out quickly and was delicious. 

The only complaint was of the service and lack of attention from our server. Every time my boyfriend tried to get her attention to let her know it was my birthday she would ignore him. She seemed very preoccupied with a table of older men. I understand she saw a big tip but it kills the restaurant's reputation as there are many different groups of people who come in to dine. 

It was good but there are other Italian restaurants in LV that have better food and prices with much better service. I have to say it really bummed me out that this experience wasn't what we had hoped for as it was a special occasion that we had been looking forward to for some time.",lzImaBMEBT5h-_tFoYAbHw,4,1,3,t3COcGr6nDp6pevopeXzqQ

Locate Tao, then use the exterior door to get the covered balcony, hang a right and it's past Rock House. I'm usually good at navigating casinos but this place was hidden! Worth seeking out though.

Came in for Restaurant Week lunch menu with Lauren C- $20, 3 courses, $4 donation to Three Square food bank, so a win all around. As expected, they are spectacularly good at carbs here, from the house focaccia you are served upon seating to the polenta croutons in the Caesar. We shared the spaghetti and meatball and chicken parm entrees, both with more than ample pasta for a lunch portion with a great robust sauce and well-seasoned protein. I'm not much of a dessert person, but the NJ style cheesecake was well made and nicely accented by strawberry compote and chocolate almonds. 

Service was attentive and I really love the ambiance of the dining room. While this spot is hard to find, I'd come back to try more.

2002746,2017-12-11,0,nUpz0YiBsOK7ff9k3vUJ3A,"Holy cow. If you're not down to read this long review, the gist of it is: best buffet in Vegas hands down.

I came here for a comp'd Sunday Brunch buffet, which is normally priced at about $35 per person-- already pretty reasonable for the strip. But you're getting SUCH BETTER FOOD than you're finding at the standard all you can eat buffets in hotels. Everything was fresh, flavorful, and beautifully presented. The food is constantly being swapped out for fresh batches, and everything just TASTES homemade. The meats were the biggest surprise-- I don't think I've had meat that tasted that good and UNprocessed since visiting Europe... I'm not joking. The pastries were also fluffy and clearly created by an expert. 

There was a lot of variety though I did feel that the brunch leaned more lunch than breakfast... so know that coming in. The breakfast food was limited to regular scrambled eggs, ""Sunday Style"" eggs (with cheese and veggies mixed in), bacon and sausage options. Other food available was cheeses, meats, shrimp, pastas and a SLEW of desserts.  I tried getting a small taste of everything and there wasn't one thing I didn't like. I often have trouble with buffets where I grab a bunch of stuff on my plate but it doesn't necessarily taste great TOGETHER-- but that didn't happen here. Everything was very cohesive and worked well together no matter what you piled on your plate.

I highly recommend the Orichette pasta, the Carbonara Mac & Cheese, the sausages, and the croissants. You won't go wrong with any of the desserts-- but be sure you grab one of their famous cannolis!!",YEg9YxQQ0dL5ajzkwokyyQ,3,1,5,0-u76SDmc0siWmV8E-bpYg

Overall = 3 stars

We had a very uneven experience at Buddy V's. The room was nice, but you really want a booth, as the tables had very uncomfortable-looking, unpadded chairs. Service was scattered and disorganized. Our server, Kacie, while very nice, seemed to be kinda all over the place, we had just sat down when she asked us if we were ready to order (??) and the bread service didn't arrive til after the entrees were served -- disappointing, as the restaurant had been open for long enough to smooth out those kinds of issues.

On the bright side, the food was excellent, we started with the meatballs, which were surprisingly light and tasty, with a nicely seasoned red sauce. I had the whole wheat penne pasta with pesto and veggies, delicious with a lot of flavor but still light. Hubby had the shrimp scampi with perfectly cooked shrimp and angel hair pasta and a light and flavorful sauce. 

The prices were pretty good for Vegas so we felt we had a good value, but it was really too bad that the overall experience didn't match the quality of the food. With so many options in Vegas, I doubt we would be back.",uJqy8uK0js_OGkBgOi1WSg,0,0,3,d7MtLIMv0a75QKz6C_apag

I was extra excited to find the best lunch deal i've seen on the Strip here at Buddy's included chicken parmigiana. Boss' Express Lunch for $22 got us an antipasto, main entree and dessert. For a starter, Grandma's meatballs were tender and sat in a bed of tomato ragu. The much anticipated chicken parm was a little on the dry side but nothing a little more sauce could've helped with. It was just the right amount of food. My heavy lunch was offset by the refreshing lemon sorbet with biscotti. Very strong lemon flavor, it was good! I would also suggest the Panzanella - i tried a few bites and it was a really great salad if you're looking for something lighter to start your meal with.

Fun touches related to baking and family incorporated into the decor. Ceiling lightbulbs encased in mixer whisks, rolling pin structures and at home pictures on the brick walls.

The whole table had the Jersey City style fried Mozzarella, margarita pizza, chicken parm, warm nutella cake, and XL lobster tail dessert.

The pizza is nothing special to me and did not stand out compared to the same style of pizza at other restaurants.  The chicken parm was a good portion which came with pasta that really did taste homemade.  My friends thought the Lisa's warm nutella cake was the best dessert they have had in their lives!

And the sauce was perfect!  The salad...probably some of the best dressing I have ever had and the polenta croutons! OMG!  Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, so yummy!

Then for our entree hubby got the carbonara and I got the chicken parm.  Both were amazing!  Pasta was cooked perfectly, the carbonara was creamy and rich, the chicken was moist and crispy, just...yes!  And then there was dessert.  I couldn't even finish my meal so we got the warm Nutella cake there and the cannoli to go.   The Nutella cake with ice cream was like heaven on a plate!

I took the safe route and ordered Chicken Parmesan. This dish is pretty difficult to mess up since it's so common and every Italian restaurant has it. But to my surprise, it was just....Bleh. Nothing spectacular about it. Tasted better everywhere else. 

I was with 7 other girls, who ordered a variety of dishes. All didn't seem wow'ed at all, too. Two girls ordered the same thing (forgot what they ordered), but one girl's dish was way more salty than the other. We all had a taste of both girls' dish and agreed. 

Service was also just.... Bleh. Whenever we asked our waiter for something, he had a lame excuse why it couldn't be done or if it can be done, he would take forever to do so. One thing I don't like is how they can't split up checks. Even very small restaurants don't have problems with splitting checks now a days. I also don't like paying a lot for food that's less than mediocre. 

I must add though that their dessert menu looked amazing. Too bad none of us were in a mood to try anything. I MIGHT be back to try out a dessert or two when I make it out here again to L.V.",A1o0CeEJn51zWHxRiG0Qdw,2,0,2,b5Wwp2IabyDnVz5LypPbQA
2114769,2017-05-18,1,nUpz0YiBsOK7ff9k3vUJ3A,"Nothing touches this food. Nothing. This is the one restaurant I recommend in Vegas over everything. You'd be doing yourself a disservice if you're in Vegas & looking to eat Italian & don't come here. Don't break the bank at Rao's or Carmine's or some other fine dining Italian restaurant. Eat at the place that feels like home but has the quality of food that can compete with the more expensive places. At those places you're going to pay extra for noodles with your parm. At Buddy V's it's all included for a lower base price. 

I'm not going to give a review based on a specific experience because each time I've gone it's been nothing but the best. Girlfriend and I love it. We start with the meatballs that will blow your mind; I order the chicken parm & she orders something new every time. While you wait, piping hot, fresh bread is delivered to you with classic oils for dipping; however, I'm a much bigger fan of dipping it in the meat sauce that comes with the meatballs. Red wine to wash it all down & I am a very happy man. 

Aesthetically, the restaurant feels like someone's home; classic oldies & doo wop are played throughout the restaurant. Seating has never been an issue for me even when I go at 6 or 7 PM on a Friday or Saturday. Restaurant may be packed, but there's plenty of bar seating. 

Two entrees, an appetizer & a glass of wine runs you roughly $70. Kinda pricey, but well worth it. Servings are huge. Most restaurants in Vegas will run you close to that amount anyways.

Locating the restaurant was a little tricky but a couple directions later we made it. Inside is beautifully laid out, while not overly fancy, it is classy. 

We were seated in a clean red booth immediately and drinks brought right away. The burger was $16. I asked to have the meat cooked away from pork and the server kindly let me know that the only pork they cook is in the meatballs in a pot. The grill only cooks shellfish and steak. Super nice. 

Burgers came out with Parmesan fries. Asked for pickles and had them right away. Drinks filled automatically. No breadsticks or other food while you wait. There are some really thin straw like bread sticks on the table that are average.

2186537,2014-05-11,0,nUpz0YiBsOK7ff9k3vUJ3A,"The hubs and I RARELY go out for Italian food. Why? Well, because we can make most of the dishes at home with high quality ingredients. Well, when I had some family in town, I suggested all of us going to Buddy V's only because :1. Pit stop at Carlo's Bakery; 2. It's easy for me to get back on the I-15 to head back to suburbia. 3. Italian food is always safe when entertaining guests.
Well, my cousins decided to day drink while waiting for me to get off of work, so by dinner time, they were fighting off a massive hangover. And it wasn't even 5 PM. Then they blew us off. 
The hubs and I decided to take advantage of our time together with our diva because we both had lobster tails from Carlo's Bakery on our mind. We figured, dinner was going to be a bonus, so I don't have to cook and clean, and we made the trek from suburbia to the Strip. 
We checked in for our reservation and was seated within a couple of minutes. When I made the reservation, I requested a table along the windows for the view. I noticed all the tables along the windows were designed for larger parties and I was prepared for them to seat us at a smaller table since our party decreased from 6 to 3. But no, they get a high five for seating our party of 3 at the  primo table that had a view of the Strip as well as a view of Carlo's Bakery so we can keep an eye on our number. 
Our server, was personable, just a tad slow. I'll take 'a tad slow' over crappy personality any day.
We ordered:
Kids Margharita Pizza
Grandma's meatballs
Caesar salad
Chicken Parmesan
Agnolotti

I enjoyed  everything that we ordered. I thought the pizza crust was outstanding; thin, crunch AND chewy, perfect amount of sauce and cheese. The meatballs were heavenly. The Caesar salad took us by surprise. When it arrived at the table, we thought the salad looked dry. But when we took our first bite, we understood why it looked like it was dry. It was one of the best Caesar salads I've ever had. It didn't need all that dressing because each bite had the perfect amount of acid, garlic, cheese and saltiness from the anchovies. The croutons were unique; I forgot to ask but I think it was made out of polenta. The croutons were perfect to dip with the meatballs. I had the Chicken Parmesan; it was good not great. MY hub's agnolottis were divine. Hand made, they were filled with veal shank, sausage and pork with a creamy, sage brown butter. The one complaint I had was I thought the agnolotti pastry was a tad thick but the flavors were very good. 
All together, we spend $113 with tip for 2 adults and a princess. A tad high for a family dinner, but overall, it was a great experience for us. Too bad my cousins were too drunk. But that's what you do in Vegas.",QiVO1CAXajUamfYhjimaew,0,1,4,D8Ry5VxQzNmprpm8Kn492Q

2206279,2015-06-23,1,nUpz0YiBsOK7ff9k3vUJ3A,"Restaurant week lunch menu 2015 review 

The Skinny: maybe I just don't get it but the food is okay,  not great... Surprisingly their dessert was the worst course and cannot recommend. (3) service is good and prompt (3) value: it was okay for Restaurant week special but I would skip this place at regular prices. 

We came in to try their restaurant week lunch menu which serves a 3 course lunch for $20.15. 

I got her Caesar salad,  grilled salmon over a cucumber/chickpea/artichoke salad while the hubs got the tomato basil soup and spaghetti and meatballs.  Both came with a dessert course of cannoli and cookie selection. 

The tomato basil soup was a little too bland and needed more basil. The texture was good.

I liked the Caesar salad better albeit it was a little heavy on the dressing and needed more acidity. The hubs thought there was a little too much anchovy in the dressing but I kind of like that. The polenta croutons were a great addition textural and flavorful. 

Spaghetti and meatballs was really nothing special and the sauce was too bland -  there really wasn't enough tomato flavour to really make this dish stand out. The meatballs were under seasoned. The spaghetti itself was cooked a bit beyond al dente which in a dish like this,  makes it disappointing. 

My salmon dish fared better. The grilled salmon was done perfectly. However the salad of cucumber,  arugula,  chickpea and artichokes was a bit underwhelming and needed more acidity/brightness to bring the flavors together. 

The worst course was dessert. It each came with a cannoli and 3 cookies -  oatmeal, chocolate chip and sugar cookie. The cinnamon cannoli was okay albeit rich...there wasn't enough cinnamon in there to really distinguish itself. The cookies were really bad -  they did not have that rich buttery taste to them. The sugar cookie especially tasted more like shortening and artificial flavors. I think they also skimp out and use cheap artificial vanilla extract.

After we finished lunch I was watching the bakers at Carlos bakery. Guess what I saw? A half used package of pre-made manufactured Rice Krispies treats with the shiny blue foil packaging and Kelloggs branded elves (see the pic). Seriously. As a bakery,  you cannot make rice krispie treats yourselves? (Just FYI, all you need is a microwave,  marshmallows,  butter,  rice krispie cereal, a bowl,  a spatula and 10 minutes to make this dessert). To me,  that is just bad form. 

At the end of the day, I give the dining experience a 3 star -  it's okay but nothing I would return for. As for Carlos bakery -  just the cookies and the aforementioned shortcut I saw are enough for me to stay far away.",h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q,1,1,3,fHzaA6bZ_ViWYJvyntcfxw
2216420,2015-11-20,0,nUpz0YiBsOK7ff9k3vUJ3A,So I can't say I love the fact that Buddy's feels very much like its part of a mall. I think it's due to the fact that the entranceway is huge. The open floor plan just makes the restaurants main Dining area feel like it's right in the middle of the mall. However despite this minor flaw the food here is authentic. Our waiter was from Naples and had a true passion for the food he was serving. Our apps were delicious including the Caesar salad and calamari. The meatballs were top notch. For dinner I ordered the mixed meats with pasta. The dish had a name but I can't remember for the life of me what it was called. The lamb was fatty though which is why I can't go to five stars. Plus the dish was missing a component in my opinion. Like maybe some cheese or vegetables. My friends dishes all looked good. No one seemed   blown away but we were definitely satisfied and impressed by the cleanliness and authentic Italian cuisine we were served.,6pCzQCyqoZHSNMZGdIRApg,1,0,4,F_JyetKrMg2g8Un9XBJv5Q

So, if you are okay with or need to impress someone by spending about double what you would normally pay for a good, but rather run-of-the-mill and somewhat small portioned Italian meal, then you will likely be satisfied with your experience here.

Otherwise, you'll probably feel like what I felt afterwards. No longer hungry, but not particularly impressed.

We had the panzanella, turkey dinner, linguine and clams, cannolis and apple crostata. The panzanella was good, but we wished there was more than the four small slices of cheese on it. The turkey dinner was good. Was it $24 good? Not so sure. The linguine and clams was somewhat overpowering with the spices. Is linguine and clams supposed to make you sweat? Apple crostata was pretty darn tasty. Easily the highlight of our meal. The cannolis? Seeing as how the cannolis are seemingly a signature type thing, you'd think they would wow. They didn't wow us. They're good cannolis for a Hoboken bakery. But for a $$$ restaurant in the Venetian? For $$$ it needs to be BETTER than ""home cooking"".",TprC8sujz8MkwuomrqUSiw,5,2,3,5ksg-PLAzCbv2aBZmfYW4g

I would suggest that you take full advantage of that.  Some days are harder to get into the restaurant than others.  And online reservation makes it more convenient.

Good sauce, chicken breast a little tough but all around not bad. We opted not to have dessert with our meal since we were full and instead went 'across the street' to Carlo's Bake Shop. I've never been to the original one in New York, but I'm guessing they serve many of the same items in Vegas. It was just as crowded as the restaurant if not more.

2284727,2015-07-28,1,nUpz0YiBsOK7ff9k3vUJ3A,"Maybe I expected a lot more because of the name behind it. I Have to admit I was pretty excited to try this place out and not that I was disappointed but more so I wasn't wowed or left with a ""can't wait to come back"" feeling. A couple friends were in town and like any vegas visitor wanted to try something new. We came for Sunday brunch and instead of ordering off the regular menu they offer a Sunday brunch buffet. Though the selection was more than enough to fill me up, don't expect a lot of food (the idea most might get when thinking of a vegas buffet).  The food was ok. Nothing spectacular but very well presented. First time ever seeing dragonfruit and lychees (served in original shell and ""hair"") in a restaurant so that was new for me. Disappointment #1 for the price you are kind of better off checking out one of the other casino buffets.

The restaurant itself was cute, family like and had a really open feeling. Love the concept of the open kitchen! 

As for service, this would be disappointment #2. Our server sold us the idea of unlimited drinks for an upgrade (of course) but the fact we only saw him 2 times our entire visit, limited the drinks we could order. We had to ask our busser on 3 different occasions for more water. Plus side though the bloody mary bar was pretty neat, lots of hot sauce options, vegetables and additions to choose from...good touch! We could tell they were a bit short handed since we only saw 3 servers (from what we could tell) covering the entire floor and they were fairly busy.  So we cut him some slack because he was very nice. 

Hostess staff was a little rude and not very personable but our interaction with them was short enough to make it tolerable. 

We wanted to visit the bakery but the line was so long we decided against it. I'm a local so not sure I would visit again unless visitors from out of town really want to go, but even then I might suggest another spot.",fVILhIglx6RNOXQba5t4kQ,2,1,3,bgp_24vvlZTV0D9iWnGQtg
2286476,2017-07-07,1,nUpz0YiBsOK7ff9k3vUJ3A,"Yum!!! It's insane how many restaurants there are in Vegas but my friends and I decided on this one because the menu looked good and it was in our hotel. The service was really good. Our waiter took the time to suggest us some appetizers and gave us his opinions on his favorite entrees and pastas. For appetizers, we got the fried calamari and a margherita pizza. The pizza was good and the calamari was really great. The calamari also had fried green peppers which was a little strange and I would have preferred those peppers to just have been more calamari but whatever. It also had really thin lemon slices that were somehow cooked to the point that they were crunchy and they tasted so good with the calamari.

For my meal I decided on the chicken and rigatoni a la vodka because I love pasta with vodka sauce and I don't have the chance to get it a lot. It did not disappoint at all. I loved the pieces of pancetta in it and the pasta was cooked perfectly. Sure it wasn't the healthiest dish (I definitely felt like I needed some vegetables after my meal) but it was delicious so I have no regrets. A couple of my friends got the sea bass and both loved it. Others got the chicken parm and carbonara and everyone enjoyed their dishes.

On to price, is it worth the price? Yes, the food was good, but $24 still is a lot for a pasta dish with sauce and chicken. If it wasn't on the Strip, I would say the prices were ridiculous. However, I think this is one of the more reasonably priced restaurants considering some of the other restaurants nearby.

2298538,2013-10-07,5,nUpz0YiBsOK7ff9k3vUJ3A,"Grand Openings are not always grand.  I get it.  Staff is nervous.  Owners are stressed, etc.  Today was the opening of Buddy V's in the Venetian.  My fellow event planners and I wanted to escape the 3200 person conference we were working on and go somewhere without strobe lights and bass, so we came here.

I will start with the good:  
The decor here is great.  It takes up a corner spot on the Canal Shoppes level and you have a view of TI, the Trump and the strip.  It's rustic and familiar.  Red checkered napkins and rustic wood tables with interesting lighting fixtures.  My favorite was the children's artwork on the walls and the family photos everywhere (especially the dessert menu).

The food was GREAT.  I had the Orechiette with Italian Sausage.  It was flavorful and satisfying.  It had a perfect balance of al dente pasta, savory sausage and broccoli and tomatoes.  I wasn't starving, but I ate ALL of it. My team had the spaghetti and meatballs, the Burratta Salad and the meatballs.  They ALL raved without exception.  If it only depended on food and decor, i would have been more generous with my rating.   However, for me, service trumps it ALL. 

The not so good:
Service was odd.  We arrived for our noon reservation and the restaurant was probably 1/4 full.  There were PLENTY of open booths that would have accommodated us perfectly, but the hostess decided on putting us at a table in the back.  Once seated we waited a bit to be greeted by our server, but he eventually showed and took our order.  Once orders arrived, we all seemed to receive what belonged to someone else.  Then we had an unfortunate situation that involved our waiter spilling ice cold lemonade all over someone in our party.  It was a mistake and I felt terrible for him.  But the problem was he didn't seem prepared for the situation.  He remedied it as best he could by getting help, some towels and eventually a staff tshirt for our young group member (which lucky for him was not someone in an expensive business suit).  At the end of our lunch he announced his apologies and included that his manager was so sorry about the situation that he would be sending over a dessert for the table.  Now I don't know about you, but once I was at BJ's restaurant and there was a spill at our table that hit a few of our shoes and the manager raced over, paid for our dinner AND offered to pay for our shoes and dry cleaning!  and that was at a chain pizza place!  I'm going to take a wild guess and say that if someone spilled ice cold anything all over one of Buddy V's kids, he wouldn't be so keen on getting a hard puff pastry filled with custard as an apology.  While the spill was the waiter's mistake, management could have comped her lunch or at least her drink -- which he still charged us for!   

Unfortuantely, this is what I will remember most about my time at Buddy V's.",i6w1V5iPWdYKVPnZLOeLkA,6,2,3,1H_zUdjAkgOABnnY0w68nA

2303851,2013-10-25,1,nUpz0YiBsOK7ff9k3vUJ3A,"Where to start...

Location is awkward (end of a mostly deserted hallway) and was certainly of no help to former occupant FIRST Food and Bar.

Ambiance inside the restaurant itself is quite nice, although tables thrown in the hallway seem strange.  Outdoor seating is laughable and ill-conceived.  It's essentially at the top of an escalator leading up from Walgreens/down to the Strip so plenty of foot traffic will get to check-out your food.  The outdoor view is obstructed by a wall.  This area was never intended for restaurant seating and has emerged as a hot spot for Grand Canal Shoppes' employees to congregate and smoke.  Enjoy!

Service is slow and uninterested, perhaps even worse than FIRST.  Maybe the same staff?  A friend of mine said he and his date waited 15 minutes at an empty bar to be acknowledged, let alone served.  He was so aggravated they left without eating.  He's a bartender in the Venetian and understands the importance of timely service.  My experience wasn't much better.

My food was bland, we're talking CPK bland.  A penne dish was swimming in flavorless oil and assorted vegetables that looked to be left-over from some other dish and the chicken parm was just as bland.  Skipped dessert which was probably my mistake given that's the namesake's claim to fame.  Speaking of, who thought naming an Italian restaurant after a well-known PASTRY chef was a good idea?

I've already spent too much energy on this place.  Maybe it will improve and it seems others have had better experiences, but I won't give it a second go.",Dnvd1SjN7DaeAqo71aIGSA,7,1,2,p6YykzBjkmwf0yTCsbwn2w

No reservations were needed for lunch and there are many tables. Casual Italian fare of sandwiches, pastas, and some meat dishes. We shared the eggplant starter and each had one of the sandwiches for lunch. The eggplant was okay - presentation was on the sloppy side though. My BLT was nicely presented with grill marks on the bread. Service seemed a bit forced and over cheerful. Food was a little slow to arrive given that it wasn't particularly busy when we arrived.

As a table of four (or more) we had the family style option, a fixed price, multi course meal. It was spectacular. Our server, Georgio, was the perfect combination of attentive and conversational, while knowing when to allow us time to chat and digest between courses. Family style dishes are determined by the chef. First course was panzanella (Italian bread salad), fried calamari (accented with thin sliced fried lemon!), grandma's meatballs, and a charcuterie board. Each item was prepared perfectly. We had a very nice Chardonnay with this course. If the meal had ended there we all would have been wonderfully satisfied with our meal. After letting that settle a bit, out came the entrees: a perfectly cooked beef tenderloin on a bed of mashed potatoes, a gargantuan portion of lasagna, tender chicken medallions in Marsala sauce, and a beautifully prepared sea bass. With the entrees we had Pinot noir. There was no room in our bodies for another morsel of food, but we cheered each other on to eat a bit of each of the desserts: a miniature Italian wedding cake (in honor of our brother and sister in law that were celebrating their 25th anniversary), chocolate cake with coffe gelato, and a conical, cream filled pastry called a lobster tail.

2427679,2015-02-01,0,nUpz0YiBsOK7ff9k3vUJ3A,"Looking back at this experience, I'm actually angry. Maybe it deserves a 2, but this is the worst experience I've had on strip, I expected much better. I feel used, dirty. We had a party of 8, 4 couples. I brought 2 bottles of wine (tempranillo and a cab/syrah) intending to pay the corkage fee, which turned out to be $35 (highest I've ever encountered). The waiter said that since we were Seahawks fans and he was too (night before the super bowl) he would waive one of the fees if we tipped him more, more or less, even though he'd rather see us enjoy an Italian wine with dinner.  After examining the wine list we opted for the ones I brought. The waiter also informed us that since we were a big party we should take advantage of an ""appetizer platter"" for us all to share, meats, cheeses and salad, sold to us as a family style Italian sharing experience. We talked it over and all agreed it sounded good. Then we ordered our entrees, 1 couple opted to split the ravioli, my boyfriend ordered the lasagna and I planned on ordering the small margherita pizza so we could share. When I tried to order my margherita the waiter told me it was really small, just an appetizer, I told him I wanted small because I wasn't terribly hungry and didn't want leftovers, he insisted I should get the chicken alla vodka because they had just won an award for it, I asked if it was small, he said ""oh yes, very small"" and gestured with his hands. I caved, and ordered it, after all, I do love pasta and vodka sauce.  Appetizers came shortly after, 2 different salads, 2 meat/cheese/bread platters, calamari, and the meatballs (6). It was all ok, nothing spectacular, but one of the salads was pretty good (it had arugula, yum), and the meatballs were pretty good (nothing compared to Casa di Amore's off-strip though). The entrees came and my pasta was huge (bigger than he implied at least, average dish size for most restaurants though). My noodles were undercooked and the chicken was incredibly dry, sauce was decent, but not enough to make the chicken palatable.  I gave away most of my dish to the couple who split the ravioli, as they were pretty underwhelmed with theirs too, and thought mine was a slight improvement. I took one ravioli in exchange and nibbled my boyfriend's lasagna which was actually pretty amazing (in comparison), meanwhile kicking myself that I didn't just stick with the pizza.  The check came, north of $400, turns out the appetizers were all billed separately, so we should have just ordered what we wanted to begin with.  Looking back I'm convinced that the waiter only wanted me to have the more expensive entree, not the one I'd be happy with, and it angers me that he wouldn't just take my order as I intended. I suppose I've learned my lesson, stay away from gimmicky strip restaurants, stick to your guns, and recognize the upselling. What a swindle, this waiter put used car salesmen to shame, I've never felt more used after a dining experience, and the food was mediocre at best. I'm pretty sure he wasn't really a Seahawks fan either. Buyer beware. We'll stick with Casa in the future.",VtXp8YJA5YEYnHOsiLQGVg,0,0,1,yOIYMvFhD_PucthsNyx6Zw

However; the things that drop the rating down are more about the overall experience. The starters were okay (meatballs), and the whole place/atmosphere overall was a bit iffy. The chairs are your standard fare for restaurants like this, and seemed really flimsy and were uncomfortable.

We also shared a couple of desserts of which the Canoli was very creative and extraordinary. The Canoli is kind of deconstructed which makes it fun to eat.

When we moved into the restaurant area, our experience just got better from there. Service was fabulous! All of the wait staff were very attentive. We ordered grandma's meatballs, lasagna and the chicken parm. The meatballs were absolutely delicious! Best restaurant meatballs I've ever had. My husband raved about the lasagna and talked about it the rest of the night. We would definitely go back just to have that. Chicken parm was good, but not the best in LV. The sauce on all the food had great flavor and consistency. Being Italian and growing up in NY, this restaurant exceeded my expectations.

2496738,2014-04-01,0,nUpz0YiBsOK7ff9k3vUJ3A,"The RJ did a review on this restaurant and I had no desire to visit until I read it.

We came for a late dinner on a Monday night. I didn't think we would need reservations. Walking down the hall, we were met with a huge line and I hoped it wasn't a dinner rush. I suddenly second guessed my decision to gamble on a walk in. We got closer and realized the crowd was for the bake shop located directly across the hall from the restaurant. Still, there was a good amount of people in front of the host stand. Turns out, Buddy and some of the guys were there! He was near the bar that was sectioned off for a private party, but it was still pretty cool to see them there none the less!

We were seated right away and really liked the decor and vibe of the place. Caleb was our server and he pretty much made our night. He offered bottled, sparkling, or tap water to start while we looked over the menu.

We started with Aunt Nina's Mozzarella en Carrozza as suggested by the RJ review and also by Caleb. Be sure to order this when you come! Think fried mozzarella, but done the way it should be. The outside provided a perfect crunch and the inside had all the ooey-gooey-ness you hope to find when you get fried mozzarella. It comes dressed with a tomato sauce and pesto sauce drizzle. After our first bite, we immediately contemplated ordering another. We held off as we planned on saving room for dessert.

My fiancée ordered one of the specialty cocktails as well. I don't remember which one..it had good flavor, but the alcohol was a little strong for her liking. Caleb was attentive enough to notice she wasn't drinking it and asked a couple times if she would like him to get her something else. Being in the service industry herself and not wanting to create more hassle, she declined and figured she would drink it with her entree. Caleb came over once more and took the glass and said he wanted to get her a glass of his favorite drink on the menu. He brought back a cocktail the was tequila based and had a sprig of rosemary. My fiancée doesn't care for tequila but I enjoyed the drink very much. We were very appreciative of Caleb's initiative to make our experience the best it could be.

My fiancée was torn between the chicken parm and the chicken rigatoni ""alla vodka"". Based on the descriptions and recommendations of our server, she went with the latter. I ordered the Agnolotti. The rigatoni was perfectly al dente and the sauce was very well prepared. The Agnolotti was so hearty from the flavorful meat filling and the brown butter sauce was a perfect compliment. 

We somehow managed to save some room for dessert. My fiancée has a weakness for cannolis so her decision was made fairly quickly. I came in with the intention of ordering the XL lobster tail pastry. After the meal I just had, the ""XL"" part turned me off of that idea. I was torn between the birthday cake and the Nutella cake. I turned once more to Caleb for advice trusting he would once again deliver and not turn us astray. I ended up with the Nutella cake.

The cannoli was very flavorful and had a nice touch of cinnamon. It was served with a side of chocolate sauce. The Nutella cake was actually a lava cake. It was very moist which is often lost on such a dessert. It was served with a scoop of salted caramel ice cream which perfectly balanced the sweetness of the cake.

All in all it was a great experience. The dinner menu is a little bit smaller compared to other Italian restaurants, but if every item is executed well, who cares?? Be sure to ask for Caleb and be sure to order Aunt Nina's mozzarella. I am convinced that everything on the menu is delicious and we will definitely be returning to test that theory.",W5_OS_FuMRWZ0KobEscPlQ,7,3,5,HYikTPYdjjyZvfGY74sAXg

i also got 2 desserts which the waiter suggested i do cuz i asked him if it was better to get desserts in the restaurant or across in the bakery (price-wise, etc). he suggested the restaurant for the lisa's warm nutella cake (i love nutella so this was a must and tasted very good when i had it later that nite). the lil cake has a filling of peanut butter (if i remember right) in the middle, it was thick lol, i wish i had eaten it when i was in the restaurant still... also, it comes w/ salted caramel ice cream which i wasn't a fan of the taste.. i like my ice cream sweet lol, not salty so that was an adjustment for my taste buds but i ate most of it nonetheless.. the crunchy bits that came w/ it were tasty tho IMO... and of course i had to get the tiramisu (i LOVE tiramisu so i was having high expectations w/ this!) it came in this lil jar deal w/ a few lady finger cookies on the side. i was pretty satisfied w/ the tiramisu but i do wish it was more traditionally plated (a square freely on the plate.. idk what it is about vegas strip restaurants putting desserts in jars lol). a nice lil touch is, they give u an italiany postcard saying thank u on it w/ the check which i appreciated and brought home as a souvenir! :) overall, the food wasn't to die for IMO, w/ buddy's shows and cooking/baking being his forte, u'd think his restaurant would be amazing food-wise, but idk maybe the chefs were having an off day or it should've been cooked by buddy himself lol... either way, i still adore the guy and will continue to watch his TLC shows happily as i have been since day 1!",Dvnk_tH7D1ZXWZAALOGeqQ,0,0,3,dweTMHQicQD5ISSTHfKGbA

This place probably has the best croutons in the world. Next time I go, I might just ask for a side of croutons with my salad because WOW. Because I split our main courses with someone else, I got to try both the Bucatini Carbonara and the Spaghetti Bolognese. I personally preferred the Carbonara, because I thought the sauce had struck the perfect balance and the noodles were great, but the other person slightly preferred the Bolognese. Moral of the story: both were excellent. We finished with cannoli and tiramisu. Both were, as you could have guessed, fantastic. Moreover, the servers were very friendly and we felt that they paced the meal perfectly. I can't wait to go back.  However, before you do, make sure to call and ask if the prixe fixe is on the menu that day because, when we first arrived, even though it was a Thursday at noon, the waiter said that he had to check.

UPDATE: I came back, and learned that we are not limited to their packaged breadsticks for lunch. Instead, they have (free) focaccia bread. All you have to do is ask for it, and then someone will come around with a big pan of focaccia bread.

WHERE: Located inside of the Grand Canal Shoppes of the Venetian and or Palazzo.

WHEN: Monday through Sunday from 11:30am-10pm; Friday & Saturday from 11:30am-11pm. & most importantly, Happy Hour from 4:30-6:30pm! =D

WHY: BECAUSE EVERYONE'S DOING IT! Lol, just kidding. Wouldn't you like to take part in a sit-down lunch or dinner with your friends and or family in Buddy V's first restaurant in Las Vegas?! & also because Carlo's Bakery is going to open in a few weeks to months just right across the restaurant! SO PERFECT!

WHAT: The first time I came here, my family and I did dinner. As I walked into the restaurant and to the table, I noticed the perfectly dim ambiance that filled the entire room. I love ROMANTICKLE restaurant settings! It makes me HAPPY! 

Random Tangent: Sometimes I make words up so don't dictionary.com them because it most likely won't be in there. Haha

So as my family and I were seated, we were handed the menus and ordered. I love dinner with family because we purposely order something different so that we can try each other's food! Too good!

FOOD:
Chicken Parm- I personally got the chicken parm, and it was excellent! I wish there could have been a tad bit more spaghetti with it, but overall Yummy!
Margherita pizza- My younger cousin chose this pizza, and I'm glad he did because there were slices for every single one of us! SHARING IS CARING!
Nonna's Lasagna al Forno- My older cousin ordered the lasagna. From the bite I took, I remember wishing I ordered it! It was definitely a hearty meal because there were leftovers! Thumbs up!

DESSERT:
Buddy's XL Lobster Tail- As I was scanning the dessert menu, my eyes suddenly zoomed into this dessert! I absolutely love the flaky pastry shell that enclosed the yummy, creamy, and PERFECT custard cream! (Everytime I go to NY, I search for Lobster Tails!!)
Lisa's Warm Nutella Cake- My cousin is addicted to chocolate, as this made his eyes light up! I loved the hazelnut praline crunch, good touch to the chocolatey goodness!

I still want to try the rest of what's on the dessert menu!!! GIMME GIMME GIMME!

HAPPY HOUR: My cousin and I just made it in time for HH the other day, and we went HAM!
Grandma's Meatballs- The perfect tasty, softy GOODNESS! I love these meatballs!
Macaroni & Cheese Carbonara- I am a mac&cheese fiend! This mac was pretty good. I've never had it with peas, but it actually gave it a sweet taste, GOOD COMBO!
Calamari Fritti- Loved the grilled lemon pinwheels, banana peppers, and the tomato aioli! AIOLI!!
Meatball sliders- We couldn't get enough of the meatballs, so we had to order it in bread!

Lastly, try the ""CAKE BOSS"" chocolate martini! If you love chocolate & alcohol, it was a really good mix! Tasted exactly like a chocolate cupcake... the only difference is it is in LIQUID FORM, and you may not be able to walk straight after! Lol

Before I continue typing, I am going to STOP and leave you with one thing... ENJOY!! & LET ME KNOW WHEN CARLO'S BAKERY OPENS! HOLLER! =D",udpfGxriuoBdWRBdplJl-w,6,4,4,KtSqEcNezW0pnmrcCwkywQ

2627526,2016-03-24,2,nUpz0YiBsOK7ff9k3vUJ3A,"While I still think dinner is a solid three, their Sunday brunch buffet is five stars all the way! 

I really don't like traditional breakfast food, and Buddy V's Sunday brunch had two egg dishes and one French toast dish at the buffet. Perfect! 

The buffet is divided into five stations: starters (charcuterie, shrimp, antipasto, soup, Caesar salad); carving station (props to the bacon and the spicy Italian sausage); Kids corner (Mac n cheese, pizza, candy); entrees (loved the meatballs, chicken Parmesan, carbonara Mac n cheese) and DESSERTS! Delicious tiramisu in mason jars, cannoli, and zonuts were my favorite. 

The buffet is $34.95. I opted for the extra all-you-can-drink mimosa deal for $14.95 and you can choose from mimosa, Bellini, sangria, beer or wine. The Bellini was tasty but that sangria tho! I'm embarrassed to say how many glasses I had. 

My fiancé got the Bloody Mary deal for $18.95 in which they bring the vodka and you craft your own Bloody Mary from a different station. He had fun doing that (and adding shrimp from the appetizer station) and he also got to choose from all my drinks. He ended up switching to the sangria as well and drank as much as I did. He got to keep his glass as a souvenir. 

We got seated right away with no wait (even during March Madness weekend) and I can't wait to come back. Wish it was served every day!",im1piwjKBavmW1-tbqhqEw,6,2,5,BeO6zGD8BuGgxTKSwViyMw
2627995,2017-01-24,0,nUpz0YiBsOK7ff9k3vUJ3A,"Meh, Buddy V's is a 3.5 stars for me but rounding down because of slow service and complicated bill -_-

I made a reservation at Buddy V's for my birthday. We were a large party of 15 that seated us pretty quickly once our whole party arrived. I know that we were a large party but I just felt like the overall service was very slooow.....The older man (maybe the manager) walked us very s l o w l y....to the table and as we were seated, it just took a long time to get our utensils or menus. It was around 4:45 when we arrived and the restaurant didn't look too crowded at the time.

I am a huuuge fan of moscow mules and I make it a point to try a restaurant's signature mule. Buddy V's has a ""Jalapeno Mule"" on their cocktail menu and I was instantly intrigued and pleasantly surprised upon tasting it. It was bright and zesty, but the subtle kick of jalapenos would kick in afterwards. It's not a really overwhelming spice, but rather quite refreshing. Highly recommend trying this!

And for my meal, I ordered the linguini and clams and shared with my friend who ordered the sea scallops. Much to my disappointment, the linguini was super salty and extra garlicly. I didn't mind the garlic but the salt was just too much for me and found myself taking gulps of water in between bites. The sea scallops on the other hand were quite enjoyable. The creamy bed of polenta beneath the beautifully seared scallops complemented it well.

The dessert was probably the highlight of the meal. The Italian birthday cake was soo delicious. I'm not a big fan of desserts because I don't have much of a sweet tooth but the sweetness of all the different layers was not very overpowering in this. I loved the chocolate mouse layer. So dreamy....

It was time for the check and here's where things got unnecessarily complicated. Again, service was slow and we seemed to be waiting for forever for the check to come out. Prior to even ordering I had asked if we could split the check into separate bills, by tables, since we were a large party. They had forgotten, but no big deal, I asked them if they could fix it and they said they would. We wanted to split the bill to put it on two separate cards. When they brought back the check and I took a look at it, I was so confused. Our server had literally split everything on the check in half (see my photos), which made it 39247038x more difficult for my party to figure out who we needed to pay back. I clarified with our waiter what I wanted and off he went to fix our check. What could possibly go wrong? So instead of just ringing up another two new bills, he took a looong time trying to move halves from the two checks around. So instead of ""linguini and clams"" on the bill it said ""1/2 linguini and clams"" twice. He spent a long time trying to move things around but didn't move everything properly. I think it would've taken equally as long to just create two new bills where each meal was not a half.

So yeah, that was frustrating to deal with. Everyone was getting grumpy because we had been in the restaurant for so long because of the slow service and we were ready to leave after two hours of being there. But our waiter did try...and he was nice...just not efficient. Overall, good food and a nice interior!

 Buddy might make this food for his family, but not allowing them to sit until the entire party is present is rude!!

We asked both the hostess and the manager (both rude and short) if we could sit and have a drink and we were told no, but you can go to the bar and get a drink.  Since a few of us worked in the industry, we understand the policy when it is busy, but when it is not I would think a good manager would make the right decision.

Came here on a date and yes, I do agree with a fellow Yelper that it IS a big spacious restaurant so it doe not give you the intimate, romantic/family style a Italian restaurant should be. But hey...it's located in a 5 diamond hotel right ON THE STRIP...what else can you expect?

To sum it up, everything we ordered was delicious. The service was great, our waiter was attentive the entire time keeping our drinks filled, napkins/utensils were delivered quick. 
We got an order of their famous meatballs as an appetizer. I believe it came with six. Perfect to start off with. The meatballs were very flavorful and they weren't puny little meatballs either.
For our entrees, I ordered chicken Parmesan and my date ordered a pasta dish. Let me tell you, like most restaurants here on the strip, portions were pretty big. I definitely had leftovers for the next day. My chicken Parmesan wasn't dried and they put the perfect amount of melted cheese on top. 
We also ordered dessert. Not a big fan of sweets to begin with and I was already full from dinner. But my date suggested we share something soooo....sure, why not? We ordered the canoli and it was wayyy toooo sweet for my liking. The cream filling....bleh....over powering. I much prefer a gelato or something if I ever get a chance to come back here.

Overall, this is a really good restaurant and I can see it thriving here at The Palazzo. Prices aren't as expensive as say, Dal Toro or Bouchon. If you're in the mood for Italian and kind of on a budget.....I definitely recommend Buddy V's.

the chicken Parmesan and I had the chicken rigatoni with vodka sauce. Everything was so good and the only thing we could say is it didn't taste like restaurant food, it tasted homemade. We also had to order the lobster tail. Even after a bottle of wine and our dinner it was so light and airy. Amazing.

3pm is a perfect time to visit! It's slow in the restaurant, but the service is top-notch. They even had a specific menu for 3-5pm which was a-little-lunch-a-little-dinner. Here's what we chose and the consensus on each.

1. Meatball Sub and Fries: Good! large meatballs, delicious marinara and cheese, crusty bread, tasty fries that seemed almost batter dipped. I ate half so I'd have room for dessert.

2. Chicken Avocado Club Thingy: Good! The Caesar salad that came with it had what looked like croutons on top, but really they were a fried cube of something - we thought polenta - with a mildly lemony taste. Really added to the salad and surprised in a good way.

3. Margherita Pizza: Good! The person who ordered this enjoyed it a lot. I had a bite and thought it was good. One other person at our table thought it was horrible. Whatever. I'd still give it a solid B+.

4. The Meat and Cheese Board: Excellent! Our difficult-to-please patron got this and enjoyed it immensely. It had 4 kinds of Italian cold cuts, very fresh and very good, sliced thin. A few hunks of cheese (the Parmesan was to die for!) and some olives and other pickled veggies rounded it out. There was also some toasted bread.

Nobody finished any of their meal, and it was boxed and given back to us in a pretty bag with utensils and napkins for later.

We'd saved room for dessert and got the XL Lobster tail with fresh fruit, lemon sorbet, and the caramel creme brulee.

All of them were very, very good, but I've got to say that hands-down, that was the BEST creme brulee I've ever had. EVER. And I love creme brulee. And it wasn't even my dessert!

I'm not ashamed to say, I used my finger to get the last of the creme brulee out of the bowl. Well, maybe I'm a little ashamed. 

The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is that, while everything was good and fresh tasting; it lacked something. Very good, but not indistinguishable from other good Italian meals that I've had. I'd love to say ""there's nothing out there like Buddy V's"" but I can't. Yet.

I think I'll have to try again, just to make sure.",VeKdP0nPZjt__MSevRVEFg,0,0,4,RAIyCAaRnuW3VpXGldojrg

We dined at Buddy V's for our anniversary.  The service was fantastic and the food was amazing.  They serve the best warm focaccia bread with olive oil & balsamic while you wait.  

We both had the linguine & clams with sides of polenta and broccolini.  Usually when you order linguine & clams you get very few fresh clams in the shell.  It's typically just enough to add some theatrical value.  But this place piles them on.  We both were given a lot of fresh clams in the shell.  The white wine sauce was excellent and the pasta was cooked perfectly al dente.

There was no room for desert so we didn't get to try any of Buddy's famous confections.  Next time.

Only complaint... When you're coming from the valet parking garage the place is sooo hard to find.  The signage in the Venetian isn't very good and every person you ask sends you a different way.  We walked around that enormous hotel for more than 20 minutes looking for this place and almost gave up.

It's not necessarily a romantic atmosphere but that's just Vegas in general. Doesn't matter where you go, there's always someone in shorts and a crappy t-shirt and flip-flops. Having said that, we still managed to have enjoy a nice romantic evening. The waiter was great. The chicken parm was great, the corozza was great, the lobster tails and Italian birthday cake were of course great. And just because I needed to try the tiramisu, we came back a few days later. And of course, that was great too. Nice touch with a little bit of chocolate cake in the bottom. I liked that the place wasn't overly crowded and we could go and sit down pretty much whenever. It was certainly one of the highpoints of our trip and I very much look forward to going back. And next time, I'll look forward to stopping into the Carlos Bakery shop opening up just next door. I know some complained about the pricing. I would argue that once again, that's just Vegas. Cocktails cost pretty much $14 wherever you go, unless you're sitting at the slots, and restaurant food is pretty much always $20+ for entrees.

2807789,2017-06-22,0,nUpz0YiBsOK7ff9k3vUJ3A,"Before we get to food or ambiance, first you have to find the place - which is buried in the maze of the Venetian / Palazzo Canal Shops.  I have been to the real Venice many times and I swear it is easier to find your way around there than it is around the Canal Shops.  At least the real Venice has guidebooks with maps.  It would be helpful if Buddy V's website would at least give a clue, like saying ""We are on the second floor, about 30 yards down a hallway from Barney's New York, and overlooking the porte cochère facing the Strip.""  Would that be so hard?

So, anyway, after a few wrong turns and roaming around for 10 minutes I'm a little grumpy but we find the restaurant.  My first impression is that someone crossed a mob restaurant from Jersey with a Chuck-E-Cheese.  Very bright.  Very loud.  Very crowded.  Lots of kids.  Hard chairs at the tables, although the booths looked comfortable.  (The booths were all full at 6:00 p.m. on a Wednesday.  Whatever criticisms I have about this place, they sure don't seem to be keeping the customers away.)

The wait staff was attentive.  Drinks came quickly (I needed one), along with a piece of foccacia bread and some olive oil and vinegar for dipping.  We were here for restaurant week, which meant ordering off of the prix fixe menu.  I started with Grandma's Meatballs; they were not the best I've had.  They had a kind of a light, mousse consistency and not much (if any?) sauce.  Well, I've never understood the iconography of ""Grandma"" as the pinnacle of  the culinary arts anyway.  Personally, I'm more impressed by training at the Culinary Institute of America and a few years working in a Michellin starred restaurant, but hey - maybe your Grandma was a better cook than mine.

My entree was the roasted sea bass, and that was a very nice piece of fish.  I also had a side of Mac & Cheese Carbonara, which was excellent,  My wife had a Cesar Salad and a pasta entree, and she enjoyed them both very much.  For dessert we each tried the cannoli, which was kind of mediocre.  That surprised me, since Buddy V is known, first and foremost, as  baker.

The $40 prix fixe menu was a good bargain, although the prices on the main menu were definitely creeping into the ""fine dining"" range.  Oh, it's not Sinatra or Giada's by a couple of hundred dollars, but it wasn't priced as a family restaurant either, even though it felt more like a family restaurant.

So, time for the trek back to the parking lot.  At least we didn't get lost this time, and the Venetian is one of the few Strip hotels that still provides free parking - hat tip to Sheldon Adelson for that.",ZmKGF8ZZUo16g2ISrz4ahw,0,0,3,JNjYi8qdkbsV5AU5PHVnuA

The not so good - Calimari. It was very chewy and may have been a little undercooked. The sipping sauce was pretty good, had a bit of chipotle/spicey flavor to it.

The good - my wife and I split a plate of Chicken Rigatone A La Vodka. This meal was very flavorful. The noodles were large and had chunks of chicken mixed in with it. The vodka cream sauce was very tasty, I would order this again.

They are a little cheap with the bread but it is great and quite frankly I dont need to eat it anyway.

She described a few of the beverages when asked, but after ordering ""bellinis"", she told us the Bellini machine was broken.

I personally ordered a Caesar salad and as the waiter walked away he said he would being enough to share. Bill comes and were being billed for a huge family portion for which 2 people ate and more than half was left.

Bestie and I were in a major hurry to catch our flight but had a hankering (and a reservation!) for Italian before we left Vegas.The hostesses were incredibly accommodating and let our server know we had a tight timeline.

As a result, we sat, ordered and ate - including dessert to go - and drinks in a mere 30 minutes! Clearly a dining world record.

Our server Kristin had impeccable recommendations. We started off with the caprese salad and then had lasagna and spaghetti and meatballs for our entrees. The pasta was cooked al dente as it should be. Everything was piping hot, fresh and flavorful. After the complimentary bread and breadsticks, there was no way we could eat all that food. Portions are this side of ginormous.

The manager Adam came by to check on us and chatted about other Vegas restaurants we had been to even offering future menu suggestions for a steakhouse we had been to the night before. He clearly runs a tight ship while making sure guests are well taken care of and well fed.

I was hungry, and to make matters worse, I was indecisive of what to eat. (Don't you hate that feeling?)  One of my suppliers suggested grabbing a bite at a place called Buddy V's.

They also have a limited al la carte menu that offers pretty much everything that is already on the buffet, but why would you pay $23 for just chicken parm?

My! How quickly expectations can change. 

We were warmly greeted buy 2 pretty hostesses, and immediately sat at a table. I couldn't wait to look around. Our server greeted us, and went over the workings of the Sunday Brunch. We also got the unlimited alcoholic beverage option.

My lovely wife got sangria, I started with a domestic beer, then went a red wine. Sangria was great, and so was the vino. We stuck with that for most of the meal. 

As a foodie, I have to say ALL the food offered was FANTASTIC. If you like Italian comfort food, this brunch will satisfy all your needs, and make you eat way too much. 

I ate so much, I did not eat again till the following day. 

The italian sausage on the carving station (see pic) was luscious. The fritatta delish, orecchiette pasta amazing, the french toast unlike anything I've had before. Chicken parm was tasty. They put fried polenta croutons in that amazing fresh, cold, caesar salad. Meatballs were nice. My wife loved the ham on the carving station. 

EVERYTHING was so good, so good, so good. 

I visited the dessert station and discovered a totally different Tiramisu than what  I'm used to. This one was done with love. It was light, wet, and beautiful. The bread pudding and red velvet cake changed my mind about not liking bread pudding and red velvet cake. Hey, the cake boss apparently ain't no joke. These desserts were great. I can't wait to go back to try the Italian wedding cake.

I thought I was done after dessert, but went back to get more of that sausage and meatballs. With a little garlic bread of course. Also had a bloody caesar that was very good also. 

Did I mention how good everything was? Man! this place is my new Sunday after church brunch spot!

I've been to buffets on the strip that offer 3 times as much of a selection for about the same price. You know what though? No one could possibly try that much food. Even if you could, not EVERYTHING would be fantastic. The other thing I dislike about buffets is that the food is almost NEVER hot. 

Buddy V's Sunday brunch offers a smaller selection of fantastic HOT, FRESH food in a buffet style setting. 

The food is so good, that when you float out of there on a euphoric foodie coma trip the last thing you think about is the price. A total value experience.",lhPuskGXTRSjCwKOOOYeoA,5,3,4,K5xvPiVNupH23uuqxGNK6g

My friend asked for the wine list and the way she rolled her eyes you would think that's a dumb question (is that a dumb question?). When she finally came back another 10 minutes later to get drinks I asked for a food menu and that was also apparently really labor-intensive for her because she seemed crazy annoyed. The place wasn't that busy but I could tell she was the only one behind the bar which I can sympathize -- I'm a pretty patient person so if I have to wait it's not usually a big deal as long as you're pleasant when you do get to me.

The portion was big enough to share, which we should have done, since we had food coma shortly after. The customer service was great and our server was attentive.  I just think the food is pricey for Italian food and it didn't even contain any seafood, but then again anytime you have a celebrity chef attached to the restaurant's name then expect to pay more, so excuse my rant.",393M4uM_4GBLPbhQIQtF9g,29,26,4,loVWVyo1P3n2cK8xGxA9MQ

Here's a legit spot to get Italian food on the strip of Vegas. Had a plentiful selection of dishes ranging from pasta to pizza to seafood/meat. Overall cost for the dishes were sorta pricey... However, we're in Vegas so the whole situation is justified 

Here's we're we got:

Focaccia Bread 5/5- So bomb ! I wanted to eat the four or five more rolls but we had so much food. Dipped this in oil/balsamic and it's like heaven.

Calamari Fritti 5/5 - so delicious! The breading was perfection. Not too dense and not too salty. The perfect blend. I would highly recommend it!

Grandma's Meatballs 3/5 - they aight. Personally, didn't think it was anything special.  I feel like I make better balls myself . 

Dad's Bucatini Carbonara 4/5 - This dish was very rich and creamy. I was in the mood for something like this so I knew what to expect.  I was very pleased with the taste and how it turned out. There was a nice crunch from the pancetta. But beware, this might be the creamiest dish on the menu. The sauce was so nice and think that I felt like my stomach was putting on a warm blanket to keep my belly warm.

Mother and Law's Shrimp Scampi with Linguine 4/5  - here's a nice size plate with good size shrimp. Scampi sauce was buttery and rich and worked with the pasta.

Veal Marsala 4/5 - Strong plate with a very nice protein.  Marsala sauce was very good with a strong red wine taste. Veal was super tender and tasty.

Caramelized Sea Scallop 4/5 - Very good dish. 6 small sea scallops and everything was very tasty. Crispy prosciutto and parmesan polenta was on point. Only negative was that the dish might be good for someone with a smaller appetite. You definitely get more bang for the buck on a pasta dish.

Lisa V's Linguine and Clams 4/5 - Another great dish. Sauce was tasty, clams were fresh, good size. Can't really screw up a clam linguine unless you really try.

Overall, solid place to eat and great service. Great for taking a date. Didn't get any dessert because we were so full. But I'll be getting that next time!

The atmosphere was nice, homey touches here and there, nicely decorated, and cute touches like whisks for the light figures. My disappointment was with the food. I ordered the chicken Marsala on the advice of our server.  Unfortunately, my chicken was not properly trimmed, and had a large strip of fat on both pieces. In addition, the chicken was overcooked and chewy. (A patron at the next table had chicken rigatoni, and felt his chicken was overcooked as well). It seemed like the chicken breasts had been cooked earlier in the day and then reheated. The Marsala sauce did not have the sweet flavor you usually taste with Marsala, and tasted more like a simple brown sauce with very little flavor. The side pasta that came with the Marsala was well cooked, well seasoned, and quite tasty. My husband ordered the lasagne, as it was a ""specialty"" according to the server. The lasagne was fine, although not really any better than other Italian restaurants I have tried. It is heavy on the veal, and heavily seasoned with anise.  If you really like anise, it's definitely the lasagne for you. We ordered the famous lobster tail for dessert.  It was a very small portion for the price ($9 for a piece the size of a very small pear) and did not taste fresh. The cream filling was very good, but the pastry was very chewy and even hard to cut through.  On the plus side, the service was very good, and the focaccia before dinner was also very good.

After that, our server wasn't very present. The chicken Marsala was pretty good; however, the pasta carbonara was very rich. My friend ordered it and I felt overwhelmed after two bites. Dessert was wonderful -we got the lobster tail and it was decadent. Great flavor and texture. The pit of night was when our waitress, Kacey, dropped the bill and told us the gratuity was already added so all we had to do was pay the total noted at the bottom. 
  The problem there was that we were a party of 3. We looked at the bill and printed directly on there was something along the lines of:
""No gratuity has been added to your bill. For your convenience, here are some preset gratuity amounts, just circle the one you'd like to apply.
- 15%
- 18%
- 20%
- 22%""

Kacey had circled the 20% option and wrote the new total at the bottom because I guess she thought that that was what she deserved. After she dropped the bill, we noticed she was constantly circling our table, waiting for us to provide a method of payment. We were a party of 3 and even though we are young (early 20s) we know how to tip. It was pretty insulting. I get it, you work in the heart of Vegas where many international visitors aren't aware of the customs. But that doesn't mean assume everybody is like that. After talking it over amongst ourselves, I got her attention and pointed out what the receipt stated and said that if it says that, then the gratuity amount should really be up to our discretion. She tried to cover it all up by saying something like, ""Oh, that was just a suggested amount, if it's that big of a deal I can just take it off."" And she ripped off the bottom of the check. 
  I've worked in the restaurant industry and servers face heavy disciplinary action for that type of behavior. We still left a tip but the whole ordeal really just left a bad taste in our mouths.",Pao1vLmA5w3zVy7GovwCOg,7,0,2,-DykGjlRjZ145PK2FA-TXg
3255539,2017-04-09,1,nUpz0YiBsOK7ff9k3vUJ3A,"This was our second time visiting Buddy V's.  The first time I came was about a year ago with several other couples on an adult trip.  We celebrated a friend's birthday and we had the most amazing experience and an extremely attentive waiter.  Our waiter completely took care of us with a flat rate per person and an unending amount of food, all of which was incredible.  We enjoyed it so much that we've been planning for the past year to come back and bring our children so they could experience it for themselves.

On Friday evening, April 7, 2017, we had the opportunity to bring our children, however the experience fell short of what we'd been long anticipating.  In town for a volleyball tournament, our first Vegas dinner was at Buddy V's.  We had a party of 8 and were celebrating birthdays for two of the girls in the group.  Upon initially sitting down at the table, I placed my purse on the back of the chair, as I do in every restaurant.  I pulled the chair out to sit down and as I sat, I fell completely on the floor as the chair had tipped over.  My purse is not THAT heavy, but rather the chairs are incredibly lightweight and not durable.  The waiter attempted to help me up but made no offer to get me ice or to notify management.  He did ask if I was okay, but due to the embarrassment and humiliation of falling down in front of other patrons, I quickly said yes, even though my elbow was hurting.  Leaving the restaurant that night my right elbow hurt.  Saturday morning I noticed my right elbow was bruised in addition to another bruise on the back of my left arm.

With regard to the meal, my daughters ordered off the Dinner Prix Fixe menu where you get a salad, an entree, and a dessert for $40.  The girls split their meal.  When the bill came, our girls had been charged for each item they ordered according to the a la carte menu pricing, instead of the Dinner Prix Fixe menu and it was added to the other party's ticket instead of our own.  The waiter also expressed displeasure with having to split the bill for the table into two separate tickets, which should not have been shared with us.

We asked the waiter toward the end of the meal if they could sing to the girls for their birthdays and he notified us that they don't sing.  He offered instead to bring each of the girls a birthday cannoli.  What he failed to mention, however is that there would be an additional charge.  I would not have minded had he mentioned that before bringing the desserts out but rather I discovered the additional charge when I got my bill.

Feeling dissatisfied with our overall experience, I decided on Saturday evening to write this Yelp review but wanted in all fairness to first call the restaurant and speak with the General Manager to let her know of our experience.  I called at approximately 6:30--not the most ideal time to call, which I acknowledged but I felt it needed to be addressed before anymore time had passed.  She told me that anytime a customer falls in the restaurant, she is to be notified.  She mentioned she was there on Friday evening when I fell and no one made mention of my fall to her.  She asked for my email address and told me that the next time we were in Vegas just to email her and she would take care of everything.  It is now Sunday at 11:15 a.m. and I've not received an email or phone call from her.

Incredibly disappointing, especially with all the hype I've given to Buddy V's in anticipation of this trip.  We will be looking for a new location for Italian cuisine on future visits to Vegas.",HJjzB4Iar--ph0jFsA4Q3Q,0,0,2,k1E7Us9I-HVwdLK843OdHA

Hubby and I had been excited to visit Buddy V's since the construction announcement. We are big fans of Buddy's so we were curious to see what his restaurant would have to offer. 

This restaurant is located in the Grand Canal Shops. I'll give you a shortcut - if you enter from the side Walgreens is on, just go upstairs and you'll see the signage. Go in through the glass doors for the shops area and you're there. No need to go through the entire casino. His bakery is right across the hall. 

Hubby and I decided beforehand that we were going to split the Chicken Parmesan and split a Lobster Tail for dessert. We got a great seat over by the window in the main dining area. The entire restaurant is decorated really cute, and I loved the family photos. Service was attentive but only by our waiter's helper - our waiter took our order then went missing until time for the check. The assistant was great, he deserved all of the tip but I doubt it ended up that way. 

Chicken Parmesan was huge, definitely big enough to share. We each got a chicken breast and a large portion of spaghetti so I'm glad we split it. The spaghetti sauce was amazing, I'm still dreaming about it. Noodles were cooked perfectly. Chicken was cooked nicely, no complaints about the meal at all. Our Lobster Tail was a little hard though, like it was either over cooked or a few days old. Not flakey in a good way, more like shards of hard bread. And the pastry cream tasted like whipped cream, not what I was expecting for the price. We'll definitely be back but only for the Chicken Parm. Might try a different dessert next time.",WjitTYyu1ab10jKi9b-fIA,1,1,4,U9KjXR1_K6LbU5GQRnHAJw

Spaghetti and meatballs were home-made tasting, in my book that means you can taste the true tomato flavor and it is not overwhelmed by the many spices normally found in spaghetti sauces. 5 medium size meatballs complement the pasta in a heavenly smelling and tasting treat. Garlic bread was buttery, crispy, garlicky, and substantial. Calamari crispy, peppery, with lots of tentacles. This is how calamari should be.

Wait staff amazing, in my book. I had technical questions about the tomato sauce, as in how their Bolognese is prepared. Suffice it to say, it tasted great...not too infused with basil and oregano. Polite and courteous, all staff were pleasant and kind.

The breadsticks were wrapped in separate packages. Just ask for more if you want more. Real grissini torinesi, as they are long and thin, with a hint of olive oil taste.

As good as it gets now...if you've read my reviews, I only give 5 stars to any place only after it has consistently shown, after many visits, that their quality and commitment never wavers.",9LX0aIyVbmhfEjqJEbt4ZA,0,0,4,fV92b5Kc4UpKOTEco73zcA

The Sunday Gravy (have no fear, you can get this every day) reminded me of those many Sunday dinners back in NY/NJ that started at 2 and ended around midnight. It almost brought a tear to my eye eating that food because it tasted so much like what my grandparents would make for us. Those grand meals are unfortunately a thing of the past, but Buddy V's brought it back to life. The meats in the Sunday Gravy were perfect, the pork was so tender, and you can taste the flavor in every bite of the sausage and meatballs. It was quite a feast and a pretty good value considering that you are right on the Strip. My wife had the lasagne and it was massive. The service was excellent, attentive, but not overly. 

Buddy, your pastry shop may not be great, but your Italian restaurant is. Great job! Thank you for bringing a taste of New Jersey to Nevada.

The one star is for the service.  Although at first 'Caleb H' (from the receipt) was pleasant, his follow-up service and care was horrible.  I watched him as he checked on the other tables - he did not come back to us after taking our orders at all.  Although dinner was around 8:00 PM, it was not too busy (considering it was a weekday too).  He even passed by us twice without saying a word.  When I looked at the other servers around us, they checked up on their customers at least three times.  I wonder if it was because I mentioned we had a coupon from booking a stay at The Palazzo?  Did he treat us differently thinking we were cheap?  I wonder if it could be something else?  I mean, we spoke English, so it could not have been because we were Asian.  I wonder at times though.  Every other restaurant I have been to in Las Vegas had servers who were attentive enough to check back with me/us at least once.  

At least Mourad was kind enough to make sure my mother and I had everything we needed during our meal there.  He apologized, but there was no need.  I also voiced my concerns with the on-duty manager.  If the server does not want to serve me/us, at least send us someone who will.  Mourad and the on-duty manager were kind and listened to my complaint about the service.  Hopefully, 'Caleb H' will not disregard other patrons as he did us this evening - it was insulting.

Come here for the food - not the service by 'Caleb H.'  I should contact The Venetian/Palazzo to stop considering giving hotel guests a coupon to this restaurant.",oEmvhFEssAeSO-W391rqqw,2,0,1,HuQFpqA7bSPmdVLcsrJ_aA

If you're coming for the Happy Hour you have to sit in the bar area but there's plenty of seats and it's very comfortable.  Great view of the strip can be seen from most seats, as well as TVs for watching the game.  

I began with a $4 house red wine and then ordered the sausage and pepper sliders, veggies and olives, calamari, gnocchi, and meatballs.   I would specifically say the calamari has a very nice texture to it and isn't too crispy.  In addition, the meatballs are simply outstanding.  The gnocchi is a bit weird as it's not the typical pasta variety, but instead a cubed pasta variety.  Still tasty, but not what I imagined when ordering.  The sliders were great and come 2 to an order.  And the olives and vegetables were a nice addition to any meal with crispy, tasty bread to add.  The pizza was actually very good as well with sausage and fresh cheese.  I had to get a pinot noir by the glass added to my order off the main menu to compliment the meal.  In total, I got out of a Las Vegas strip restaurant with all of that food and 2 drinks fro $60.  What an incredible deal.  This place is a must for Happy Hour (until 6:30pm) and I imagine their main dishes are just as good.

I've watched Buddy on T.V. and have been impressed with his portrayed personality anyways.  So when we saw the restaurant we decided to try it.  All of the tables with the view of the strip were taken so we decided to sit at the bar where my husband could watch the hockey game that was about to start.  Christian was our bartender.  She greeted us promptly, set us up with waters, offered suggestions, had a vast knowledge of the foods and drinks and patiently waited for us to make up our minds. They offer a decent selection of bourbons and whiskeys.  My husband loves a good old fashion.  Not only was Christian accomplished in making one she recommended the Elijah Craig and took it to another level.  She muddled the fruit and then strained it off which he always appreciates. Comes over square ice, nice presentation with orange rind and not one, not two, but 3 luxardo cherries.  We got there in time for happy hour, which ends at 6:30 or 7 p.m.   I had the sangria for $5.  You can't beat it.  Probably 1/2 cup of fresh fruit at the bottom.  It was refreshing and the wine was actually a decent one, which isn't always the case for sangrias.  There was another bartender working, Matthew.  They worked flawlessly together.  No one's drink without ice or is left with an unfilled glass.  Usually  you get the attention of 'your' server but here, they are attentive and make you feel like family.  Speaking of which, Matthew recently became the proud Pappa of a preemie which he is still visiting daily at the hospital.  Prayers for speedy growth and discharge home.

They get a star for service - our waiter was quite personable and competent and the bartender made some tasty drinks. But that's where the praise ends. I ordered something simple: spaghetti and meatballs. It was very...ordinary. As in ""I've had better at my junior high school cafeteria."" Absolutely nothing to praise about the dish. I make better at home. So does the wife. So does Chef Boyardee, for that matter.

The wife ordered the veal parmesan. It was a huge hunk of meat, on the bone, pounded way too thin and then burnt under the cheese. The cook obviously put it on too high a heat and forgot it for a bit. Totally inedible.

For a place opened by a ""cake boss,"" you'd think the desserts would be exemplary. Guess again. The rum birthday cake was so-so, and the cannelloni were stale and flavorless. Again, worthless food served in a nice room with good service.

Save your money and taste buds and go anywhere else for dinner. Maggiano's is just down the block and light years better tasting. Heck, go to Battista's.

Caleb H checked on us probably about two times during my dinning experience. I ordered the chicken parm and was not even offered extra parm or fresh ground pepper. If you come to this location make sure you don't get served by Caleb H!!!!!! I am a server and I know what to expect for quality service. I felt like I was under served just because I was of the younger age group. Definitely not worth it!!!!,AHKlkZldxzeGriYCefQUsw,0,0,3,TeEo37WRRuieePlhQkIpZw

This restaurant is located right in the Venetian hotel right across from Carlos's bakery. The restaurant was dimly lit inside. It's a great restaurant that has an amazing view of the north side of the strip. You just have to request it when making a reservation. It wasn't too crowded and for Vegas it is truly affordable! The dishes run between $15-30. They give you just the right amount. It's definitely not a family style Italian restaurant so I suggest not sharing. I had the chicken rigatoni which I made spicy and omgosh it was so good that I had every last bite and wanted to lick my plate up haha.

My absolute favorite, I order it wherever I go, Italian dish is eggplant parmesan. Somehow at Buddy's it is an appetizer, not an entrée. Luckily I asked the server and she was able to make it an entrée and add a side of pasta. I was nervous, not knowing what appetizer eggplant my look like, but it was delicious. It was layered slices of perfectly fried eggplant with a chunky tomato sauce and cheese. Honestly, I was half starving from walking all day, but I would say this is one of the best eggplant dishes I've ever had. I cleaned my plate.

Can I tell you how much I enjoy this place? I don't watch ""Cake Boss,"" but I'm a fan of Buddy V's Ristorante. Its setting: rustic and contemporary with a homey ambiance that's reflected in its decor. The tall windows open up the space, providing view of Las Vegas Boulevard below. All right, enough of the interior design, on to the food!

Appetizer - Caesar Salad with Polenta Croutons, Parmesan, and Eggless Garlic Dressing: During Restaurant Week, I ate my share of Caesar salads from one restaurant to the next, and this one was the best because of the polenta croutons that were crunchy and soft at the same time. I wish I could eat this salad every day. 

Main Course - My Dad's Bucatini Carbonara with Pancetta, Cracked Black Pepper, and Egg: One word: Divine. Ok, maybe a few more descriptive terms like creamy, pleasing to the palate. I would lick the entire bowl if no one was looking. 

Dessert - Cannoli: Good, but not the best that I've had. It definitely packs a crunch and isn't too sweet as is, but there's always the option to sweeten it up further by dipping it into the chocolate sauce that it's paired with. 

Not on the Restaurant Week Menu. 

Appetizer - Garlic Bread: Topped with melted fontina and mozzarella cheeses. Makes a good, tasty starter. 

Dessert - Lobster Tail: Filled with buttercream and garnished with fresh berries. Pretty yum, though difficult to cut into. 

Service - Staff members were always aware of our table, never missing a beat.

Overall - This has quickly become a new Strip favorite of mine, and I'm already looking forward to my next meal here.",epkRB3J_oBEiyiwahvdmGg,4,4,5,-b1CWbJKMtZ0gA4Re-NpPQ

Once we got to sit down we were promptly served by a great busboy. Our waiter was Rocco.  He did a great job. We were talking and were not quite ready to make our order just yet but the rude hostess came over took all menus but one and said we could share? Does this place not have enough meñus? 

The food was ok. I got the angus burger on brioche and others got pasta items off the menu also said it was ok but not for price. Fries were not savory. It was just ok and overpriced. 

In the past I have tried the zappolis and wedding cake and they were phenomenal!!! But on this trip  I was just here for food. I wanted to give this place a better score but I was not happy with the limited selection, prices and the taste.

Upon arriving at 10pm for a table of five, we were greeted with ""Is everyone here?"" ..Yes, we reply. 'Ok - they're setting it up"".....5-10 minutes later we ask what is going on and we're told ""It'll be 5-10 minutes"" not remembering what they said earlier.  We get to a table by the window and it's too breezy with the vents so we ask to be moved.  She says she can clean off the table next to us and we can move there.  

The waiter comes by later and says that's nonsense because that table JUST ORDERED!

So we ask again.  This time we're told we have table 38 in the corner...they just have to set it up (again).  We wait patiently.  When our group sees another group of five moving to table 38, it stuns me.  They of course get seated and I have to ask for the manager.  

She promptly comes by and asks all sorts of questions - and in the end comes back with ""Sorry for the confusion.  It's been really busy"".

REALLY?  ROCKET SCIENCE?  I think not.

We made a reservation in advance because we knew that it was a popular high demand place to eat. When we came to to the resturant we waited about 5 minutes so that while they got our table ready.  Once we were seated, we were instanlty greeted and served with drinks. Our Waiter was extremley nice! We informed them that we have people with food allergys and they took note to them.  Our waiter asked us what they were and took note (peaches, peanuts, onion, shell fish, and nuts where the allergains.) When it came time to order our food, he helped those with food allergeys first. Insuring that they order somthing that they can eat. He even made sure to check with the chef if it can make something without it in the dish. 

Everytime someone came out with food they asked who the people were with the allergey and told them wheather or not it is safe for them to eat it. One of the managers informed us that it would take a while for the food to come out since there are so many allergeys. All in all it took 50 minutes for our main entrees to come out and 30 minutes for the appitizers. The food not only looked amazing, but it tastes delicious.  We also had some cocktails, which were not only very strong (for those who like to drink with their meals :)) but they were very refreshing. 

Towards the end, we had informed our waiter that we have two people celebrating their birthday and he went to the back and brought them both out a canoli with a candle.

The whole restaurant reminds me of classy establishment that will not scare you away from wearing jeans and a tshirt.  The food is Great and the service is excellent.  Our waitress yesterday was I believe Graciela and she did an excellent 5 star job !  Nuggs had the classic cheese pizza.. of course.. and although the presentation was nice the sauce tasted like it was straight from the can (in my opinion).  It did not compliment the pizza at all and I could only compare it to what would seem like Hunts canned tomato sauce accompanied with good pizza dough and cheese.  My friend had the Chicken Parm , and I had the Bucatini Carbonara which I hoped I spelled correctly.  Definitely NO complaints on those two dishes!  I would definitely try those if you are not sure what to get.  Cheesy Goodness accompanied with the subtle flavor of bacon and texture of what seemed to be bread crumbs in the Bucatini are going to have me coming back in July for a double order!  Super deliciousness! My only sadness is that for 23.00 nugget stole most of it from me and there wasn't enough for me.  It's a portion size designed for an average person I would imagine but being that I'm on the bit larger side of the spectrum I could have eaten two plates easily.  Chicken Parm with spaghetti was demolished by my friend so I would imagine that should tell you how good it was.  The Cheese board is also a good add to your list of things to get while you are here.  Great selection of meats and cheeses but the bread was not enough for the amount on the board.
Desserts I might have to say are phenomenal !  I would have to say a best choice would be the Nutella cake and ice cream.  I say this only because after our meal the nugget had finished most of her pizza and half of my pasta so when I asked her if she wanted a dessert she replied NO.  I received my nutella cake and after having one bite I asked her again .. Are you sure?  It's nutella cake.. and the result about dessert is in my picture for this place.",ssTOI7wBj5jJlBmBjr2bbA,4,4,4,4gX46fo_MEfFw_GehYpYyg
3517655,2014-06-14,1,nUpz0YiBsOK7ff9k3vUJ3A,"They did a nice job renovating the former First Food space. It feels more homey and approachable. The interior may skew towards an over-the-top, typical Italian restaurant  with red and white checkered tablecloths and a panoply of picture frames, but there are cool touches like the light fixtures and use of rolling pins throughout. The place doesn't reinvent the cuisine, but executes traditional Italian-American dishes with a few subtle modern touches to create one of the better Italian restaurants on the Strip.

The eggplant parm app has plenty of great flavor, but could have benefitted from a crispier exterior. The dough of the aggnolotti was a touch thick, but the crispy texture from being pan fried was a nice touch. The sweetness of the sauce with the savoriness o the pork filling was great. The winner of the night was the huge brick sized portion of lasagna that arrived in a small cast iron dish. The mixture of proteins along with the boldness of the ricotta made for a wonderful combination that was only enhanced by the depth of a red sauce that any Italian grandmother would be proud of. For little ones, there's a kid's menu available. Among the items was a large order of buttered noodles that my kid loved. No meal is complete without dessert, and the nutella cake was a satisfying way to end it. It's their version of a lava cake with a rich, moist cake enveloping a gooey nutella mixture. A scoop of salted caramel ice cream accompanied it with a brittle underneath that added a good contrast in texture.

The execution was solid and the dishes different enough from your typical Italian American joint to make Buddy V's a good choice among moderately priced restaurants on the Strip.",C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w,5,2,4,yrWBne0ssx7moIIRxEGBqA

A person who may have been a manager, ( who knows....she didn't introduce herself)...apologized but instead of comping us anything ( like the salad I didn't enjoy anymore) she proceeded to ask if we wanted Parmesan cheese on my entree.  

AND as soon as we sat back from our incomplete entree, our check arrived!  Imagine the servers surprise when I told her I wanted another glass of wine.  She was put out because they would mean running our check again.

I don't think this is how The Cake Boss envisioned this. 

Save your money if you want a nice, un-hurried dining experience. We especially wanted this to be nice because it was the last night of our honeymoon.  Epic fail.",n6jS0am7b5zSETUPaf0MwA,0,0,1,Bbn-Izko-kLwC9ys_YeVcg
3519592,2014-03-18,22,nUpz0YiBsOK7ff9k3vUJ3A,"I ate here for Restaurant Week Spring 2014 and again the following night from their regular menu. The portions here are nice and the different types of dishes on the menu make it hard to decide what to order. Our server, Perry is fantastic! He checked on us often and made sure everything was to our liking. Managers, Adam and Christopher also stopped by our table at different times to introduce themselves and make sure we were enjoying everything. I could tell that not just the managers care about the experience of every customer, but the servers and rest of the employees do too.

The cost for the RW week dinner was $30.14 per person which I found to be a very fair price considering what I got. I had the following:

Buddy's Caprese

Chicken Parm & Spaghetti

Zeppole

The next day I at the following:

The meal started out with warm bread and oil and balsamic. Nice start!

Buddy's Caprese ($16) - This salad is sooooo good! It had charred green beans, burrata, tomatoes and balsamic. The variety of tomatoes and different colors of them were nice. The tomatoes tasted so fresh. The burrata was fantastic! So soft and tasted great. 

Buddy's Salumi and Cheese Board ($21) - Prosciutto, spicy capicola, genoa salami, gorgonzola, pecorino, grana padano, pickled veggies, olives and grilled bread arranged beautifully on a cheese board. The meats had such great flavor and the olives (they contain pits) had a nice garlic flavor to them. All the cheeses were good, but the gorgonzola was my favorite. It was creamy and easy to spread on the garlic toast. Delish!

Chicken Parm & Spaghetti ($23) - This is oven baked with provolone and mozzarella. I thought mine from the night before was soggy, so I asked that it be cooked longer this time and it was just perfect. Nice and crispy were is should be and the cheeses tasted good. The spaghetti on the side had marinara on it and parmesan and even though I barely had room, I couldn't let it go to waste! I did take half of my chicken parm home and it reheated nicely. 

Lisa's Warm Nutella Cake ($9) - The cake was warm and baked perfectly. It also came with a scoop of salted caramel ice cream that was excellent. 

Zeppole ($9) - These are served hot and coated in a spiced sugar. 2 dipping sauces accompany them, lemon raspberry jam and chocolate. The raspberry jam I wasn't crazy about, but the chocolate dipping sauce tasted great. 

They also have a kid's menu as well a lunch menu that offers burgers and sandwiches. I am eager to come back and check some of the sandwiches out. I was very pleased with the service, food and atmosphere. The first night, we sat at a table near the bar area next to a large window that overlooks the strip. The next night we sat at a booth that was closer to the kitchen. Both are different experiences so try them both! They also can host events here.",Fv0e9RIV9jw5TX3ctA1WbA,31,28,5,a83gMm7y7ttXEtR8Ey-wUQ

Food was great, service was pretty good, and prices not really bad if you compare them to other joints on the strip. I paid almost $20 for a terrible cheeseburger at the TI. I paid $24 for some of the most amazing chicken parmesan at Buddy Vs. I know which I'll be going back for next time. 
We started with the salumi and cheese board. Everything on the board tasted great. You really get a lot. We had a party of six and didn't eat all of it. I loved the pickled peppers that came with it. 
I had the chicken parmesan. Crispy breaded chicken with delicious marinara sauce covered in gooey cheese. So freaking good! It came with a side of spaghetti which I don't normally care for (don't shoot me), but theirs was really good. I just couldn't eat it all, and I'm a big guy.

We ordered a pizza and a sausage and pasta dish. Both were very tasty and average sized, not huge but not small either.

The restaurant is beautifully decorated and very clean, looks brand new inside although it's a couple years old! We were seated in a lively bustling dining area. And a young man immediately, upon us sitting down, took our drink order and poured us water. Right after that Caleb (our waiter) arrived, wished us a happy anniversary and asked if we would like to move to a more private table with a special view..we agreed of course and within 2 minutes he had checked with the hostess stand and ushered us to the back of the restaurant where the bustling was at a minimum and sat us at a beautiful table looking out over the palazzo and the strip. Was already amazed at this point and we hadn't even ordered yet! Caleb then spent a few minutes chatting with us and made some recommendations, we ordered the recommended appetizer a crispy mozzarella bread in red sauce..OMG they brought it so fast and it was to die for...could have just eaten that for dinner. I had the 3 course special, chose Caesar salad(amazing), chicken parm(light and Delish..ate the whole thing) and the Nutella chocolate cake with salted caramel ice cream(words can't describe how Devine) hubby ordered the bone in veal parm chop.

Wife and I had dinner there on Friday night. Overall the entire experience was very very disappointing. The value for the dollar was not good. 
We had 2 drinks, 2 Apps, the caprase tomato's, laughable small  no taste at all. The potion size was the smallest I ever saw. The price was high even for the strip and it was tasteless. Wife had the tomato basil soup. Was only avg. 
I had had the spaghetti bolognese and wife had the regular red sauce. I don't know how Buddy can call himself Italian but the bolognese  sauce was totally tasteless. red sauce was just avg. 
Our male waiter upset us big time. Coming to Vegas 4 times a year I am or so I thought well schooled at efforts to run up the bill however.. We ordered drinks, apps etc and he says, oh do you want garlic bread at the table? Thinking it was an opening (welcome) dipping sauce and bread like most Italian restaurants, we say sure.
Well us and the table next to us made the same exact mistake. It comes and it is actually $13. charge. We both looked over and said, we just got taken! Shame on Buddy V's for this type of tactic to its guests. BEWARE..
Also, FYI, tables are very close to each other, private conversation is impossible. We heard everything the table next to us said and they were not loud at all. 
You need to understand that the value for the dollar you pay is NOT there.. 
Buddy V should just stick to what he does best, bake!! The open kitchen quickly reviled that there wasn't an Italian in the entire kitchen as it shows in the taste! 
There are much better choices on the strip. This is just another celeb chef guy trying to capitalize on the name.
If people stop going to these places to eat they will go out of business or start getting it right. 
For the life of me I cant figure out why there are positive reviews unless these are being gamed intentualy. 
By the way, a manager never came around to even ask us or the other table how everything was. Just another sign! We will never go back.",4tAE-OTiM-UlFgCUTNuGYw,0,0,1,5b6YIp9_cXxI-nGzaDDVgQ

The pasta was perfect and the sauce complimented so nicely I could have had it without the meatballs. But who am I kidding, those meatballs just took it up a notch! Definitely freshly made, juicy with all the right spices. I was so full that I had one meatball left and yes..I took that fist sized meatball in a doggy bag! No shame here. 

My kids enjoyed the oven baked Mac & Cheese gooey on the inside and crispy on the outside & the gourmet burger on freshly baked brioche bread with aioli and side of fries. Happy campers with full bellies! 

Of course being so full we had to take our cannoli to go. It looked so darn good that to my surprise tasted even better than I imagined. We ordered the chocolate chip and pistachio nut toppings. The cannoli stayed crispy/flaky even after eating it hours later. The cream and chocolate sauce was sheer perfection.  Definite must!

Went by Buddy's early in the day (in late morning), to look into dining later that night. I immediately LOVED the decor, and homey, yet elegant look. The awning, wood floors and red checkered table cloths go well together, and it feels like you are in South Street Seaport in New York.

But, the hostess was useless, and had little to tell me that morning.  She was not friendly. She seemed more interested in dancing by herself to the tune that was playing. (They play good music there). So, I just decided to return later that night with my dinner companion. 

Well, that was a mess. Now, for the first time that evening (at around 6:15pm), I learn that we needed reservations, and that the wait was 45 minutes to an hour, which we were not willing to do on our schedule.  And again, the hostess was super useless. She did not apologize for the wait, or invite us to sit at the bar (which was empty), nor did she explain why there was such a lengthy wait when we could clearly see that there were at least 4 or 5 apparently empty tables in the foreground. Instead, she made it seem like we were complete fools for not having reservations.  Not a good tactic with your prospective customers.  

And I have a pet peeve of restaurant hostesses dressed like they are headed to a trashy nightclub.  Does not fit the family vibe that Buddy's seems to be going for (especially with the quaintly named dishes after family relatives, such as Aunties and Grandma).

The bakery across from the restaurant seems much better run and friendly!

Ordered:
x Panzanella Salad w/ Shrimp (buffalo mozzarella, focaccia croutons, tomatoes, arugula, balsamic red onions) - Salad with lots of flavor. Wait, what? It was perfect with the added shrimp, but I think if you order it without protein it'll feel more like a side salad. LOVED this salad. Croutons were amazeballs.
x Grilled Salmon (Mediterranean chickpea & artichoke salad, roasted tomato vinaigrette, balsamic) - L-L-LOVEEEEE! I like salmon, but I don't LOVE cooked salmon. kinda tastes the same for me everywhere I order it, but this one was excellent. Highly recommend for a healthy option from the menu. All the components complimented each other very well.
x Butterscotch Creme Brulee - My favorite dessert in the world. I didn't really care for the cookies or the vanilla cream it came with, but the creme brulee itself was perfection! Probably one of the best ones I've ever had. 10/10 would recommend.

Service was extremely slow, but the food made up for it. Ask to sit by the window and enjoy A+ food with a strip view :0)

I have been to the best places in Vegas and some are over hyped and some under hyped. I went into Buddy V's not really thinking anything was gonna be all that amazing but I was wrong on a few things.

One, The mussels they have are the best mussels I have ever eaten in my life. The mussels were so good I ordered another order after dessert.

Two, The surf and turf I ordered was cooked to perfection.

Three, The XL Lobster dessert is probably one of the most amazing things on this planet.

I love to watch new restaurants as they open just to see who really has their shit together and I think Buddy V's did a pretty good job on their opening. Staff was nervous and If I worked there I would be too. Not only is it opening day but the owner, owners business partners and the owners parents are all there. 

We were greeted by Adam Margolies who is the asst G.M. and it was really great to talk to a guy who is really into the property enough to where he had an answer for every question. I know to people reading this that may not seem like much but being from Vegas it is really hard to find knowledgeable people that know things even at the places were they work. We asked him how the XL lobster is made, where the cuts of beef were farmed from, if the scallops are flown in or driven, if the broccoli is organic, if the chocolate chips in the Gelato was made from scratch or store bought. 
We asked all these questions and he answered all of them with no hesitation. 

The decor is 10/10 for the type of restaurant it is and I think it will do well here in Las Vegas. I love eating at places that don't feel stuffy as I don't believe you should ever feel uncomfortable anywhere in Las Vegas.

Welcome to Vegas Buddy V!! Your gonna do great here and we are glad you chose Vegas to serve. Gonna get more mussels now !",5GKyq26mStA4bfjakyfzsg,6,2,5,4QriHSlbdZ9oe_LWXMfobg

I came in for a late lunch, the staff was friendly and attentive. It was pretty quiet, not too many people around which was nice, I didn't feel like competing or waiting for a table.

I really loved the decor, it was decorated like a nice italian kitchen; I thought the rolling pins that decorate one of the walls was a cute and creative idea. There were family pictures on the walls that gave it that homey feel, and I have to say I really appreciated that the restaurant was spacious, so it didn't seem cluttered.

My friend and I ordered Aunt Nina's Mozzerella en Carozza, which was fried mozzerella with crotini in a tomato sauce.....OMG!! So Freakin good!!!! We were tempted to order another one, but decided to wait till we had tried the rest of the food we ordered. 

We also order the linguine in white clam sauce that was also pretty good, it had lots of clams yummy!

For dessert, we got a lobster tail and a cheesecake. The lobster tail was too f*ckin good!!! We were in heaven, the flaky pastry filled with fresh custard cream and fresh berries, it was perfect balance! Not too sweet, not too tart, the berries complimented the pastry perfectly.

Needless to say after that we were stuffed, so we had to take the cheesecake to go.

3698178,2014-03-12,1,nUpz0YiBsOK7ff9k3vUJ3A,"I came to visit for the first time for Restaurant Week for my sister's birthday. I'm pretty impressed Buddy. I have to admit that so far, your dishes taste just as good as your cakes (well...the cakes look good so maybe as good as your cakes look?) 

I booked reservations for seating on Open Table for my sister's birthday. Told them the occasion and requested a nice little ""surprise"". They did more than that. They gave us the best seat (take note here because this seat is the seat you want) in the house. You walk past kitchen, past the bar, and the main floor. You'll see these big windows that help open up the room with natural sunlight. In front of that window lies a simple yet perfect table for four. You can look right out and see the strip from above, and if I'm correct the pirate show at TI also!

My sister and I ordered the garlic bread, caprese salad, meatballs, and Chicken Parmesan. 

The MEATBALLS are definitely one I recommend, but beware! These come as appetizer and can be very filling! So if you intend to make it to dessert, I'd be careful with this one. One order would be good to share with your party. It's so full of flavor, juicy, and tender. Major noms. I think it's because of the veal. 

The GARLIC BREAD. Oh the garlic bread is also a major 5! Extra cheesy, extra buttery, and extra extra garlicy. An extra 5 points if I could because it tastes just as good as a leftover. It came with 4 HUGE pieces and one is a good size to split in half with another (that is if you're a light to medium eater). 

CAPRESE SALAD is also a great recommendation if you're looking for a nice salad to eat. Full of color and flavor. They have like 3-4 different types of tomatoes in it. There was cherry tomatoes and some tomato that is red, purple, and green (it's good I swear!). It was topped with a perfect ration to cheese and drizzled around with a light olive oil and balsamic vinegar. 

**CHICKEN PARMESAN two extra stars because Buddy V's chicken parmy will probably become that GO-TO-MUST-HAVE dish. I mean it's just chicken parmy right? I know...but it was perfect. The sauce wasn't too much nor thick or overpowering. The breading on the chicken had that perfect crunch to their tender chicken. It had that nice bed of creamy melted cheese topped with a wonderful POW of garlic flavor and herbs and spices. I'm a variety seeker so I always go to different place and try different things, but once I find THAT DISH it's hard to steer me away from it. That dish is THIS PARMY.

**DRAGO ROSSO-It hasabsolut ruby red, pomegranate, jalapeño & mango. It's divine! I love spice. This has a whole lot of spice. If you're into bloody mary's or the mexican drinks with the clamato juice. You have to try it. WARNING though. It is really spicy so if you only like a lighter taste of spice for your palette I recommend you pass.

BUT! Service was great, the ambiance was amazing. Casual, but upscale? More for business meetings, lunch, and special occasions. Lastly, it was cute after my request they surprised my sister with bakery made cookies with a light up sparkler.

The Service is good and friendly and realized last night what my biggest issue with this restaurant is. The appetizers come out fast, which is awesome, but the wait time between your apps and your entree is excruciatingly long. We ordered plenty of apps to keep us busy but 45 minutes elapsed between apps and entree. This was way too long. I think I blamed the server on my second trip when the same thing happened but I realized the kitchen is just slow to get out entrees and the servers lose attentiveness when they have nothing to bring you. I hate having to ask for more water or a refill. 

That being said, I highly recommend Buddy V's, the food is amazing Italian food, the desserts are delicious and the live music was a nice touch last night.

Honestly, who would wait 30 minutes for a pastry, when Sprinkles Cupcakes is down the street and pure perfection. Anyway, we saw Buddy V's and read the menu at the front door. The prices seemed reasonable for a Strip restaurant, so we made reservations for 7:00 p.m. We arrived on time, only to wait 30 minutes while they took walk-ins before us. Once seated, the greeting was non-existent. I actually had to stop our waiter, and ask what his name was. It was Chas. After bringing our beverages, he quickly recited the one special, and he asked what we wanted. Totally rushed. I stopped him right there, and began asking questions about the restaurant. ""Chas, who is Carlos?"" ""If Carlos and Buddy V are famous for their cakes, why did they open an Italian restaurant?"" As he became increasingly annoyed with my questions, he explained that the restaurant is based on Buddy V's grandmother's recipes, not Buddy's recipes. Naturally, I commented that Buddy V shouldn't have his name on the restaurant if they're not his recipes. Oh well, just a logically conclusion. The veal Marsala came with a side of pasta. The pasta was good, but the veal Marsala was tough and the sauce was tasteless. Really salty and bland. Our dining experience lasted a quick 35 minutes...even with my insistent questions.

The caesar salad was also good, very garlicky which I like. Next was the mains, we got a few but the most memorable were the shrimp pasta and the spaghetti and meatballs. Both had tons of flavour and great portion sizes. We were celebrating my 25th birthday and all I wanted was to try something at Carlos Bakery. The manager was incredible, he went across to the bakery and got me a cupcake because he knew how much I wanted to try it and the line was crazy.

What I ate: 
- Cheese and charcuterie plate: I love cheese, I love charcuterie. Why wouldn't you enjoy this? Great to share. My friends didn't like the blue cheese, but I gobbled it all up!
- Chicken rigatoni alla vodka: Plenty of large chicken pieces, flavorful sauce. This was just a tad on the salty side. The rigatoni were perfectly al dente!
- Buddy's special pizza: Dough was fresh and flavorful, the toppings were delicious. I was glad I stole a slice from my friend and tried it

Pros:
- Easy access from the strip, located in the venetian shops
- Ten min walk from venetian hotel
- Great food
- Service was nice
- Plenty of room for large or small parties. I watched staff bring together tables for groups of 10, and quickly break it down for smaller parties
- loved the open kitchen
- you can definitely get some of their famous desserts without having to wait in like across the hall at their bakery
- Lots of bright light and space

Cons:
- can be confusing to find if you've never been there
- Lots of bright light. If you're nursing a hangover, this may not be the place for you. Order the pasta/pizza to go and eat it in the dark cave of your hotel room

Buddy Valastro

A good thing happened to my wife and I. We were driving down Las Vegas Boulevard and were trying to decide where we wanted to eat lunch.

Heart Attack Grill ? Been there, done that. Please see review.
Carson Kitchen ? Been there, done. Please see review.
Lagasse's Stadium? Been there, done that as well. Please see review.

Lola's Louisiana Kitchen?
Rock N Noodles?
Grimaldi's Pizzeria?  
Been... there... done... that...
Please... See... Review.

Long story short, we found Buddy V's Ristorante and we enjoyed it a lot!
I ate a Hoboken Cheesesteak. I love cheesesteak, but have never been to Hoboken. I'm not really sure what Hoboken would taste like? But the sandwich was delicious.

My wife ate a Chicken BLT and said her's was delicious as well. 
Service was spectacular. Our server, Danny was one of the best we have had along Las Vegas Boulevard. If you don't believe me please see my review for Mon Abi Gabi. 

The bill was under $40.00! But then again that was without alcohol. That's right it is possible to eat on Las Vegas Boulevard and not consume alcohol!

I have two concerns about Buddy V's Ristorante. One, the bakery across the hallway is over the top and smells addicting. Two, there is a kid's menu, but I have a feeling, Buddy V's Ristorante would not be good for kids in the later hours of the day. Lunch or early dinner, sure. 

Great Place. Great Service. In closing I would like to suggest reading my review for Buddy V's Ristorante... but you just did.",S156HzsEW-BjCfzu0xLe9A,0,0,5,V--qPnUczfatR7PFjyZmaA

3769405,2013-11-07,0,nUpz0YiBsOK7ff9k3vUJ3A,"Mamma Mia!!! Wow!!! Way to go Buddy Valastro! This feels like a classic Italian home the second you walk in. Family photos of the Valastro family, hodgepodge furniture, comfy sofas and chairs...only thing missing is the vinyl and plastic covers, but honestly who misses them? 

Teaming up with Kim Canteenwalla & Elizabeth Blau, who have created beautiful restaurants here in Vegas (Society Cafe + Honey Salt), the trio came together to make the Cake Bosses culinary debut a real knockout, start to finish. 

I went with my Italian buddy to try it out and we were really impressed (to say the least)! Straight forward and diverse food menu, doesn't overwhelm; drink menu follows the pattern of the food menu with good wine choices by the glass.

I chose the agnolotti which was seasoned perfectly and was in season with the sage brown butter sauce. My buddy went to spaghetti central with a rigatoni and meatball bowl and he couldn't hold back the tears knowing the impending rejection his mother would give him after finding a better meatball. 

The meatballs came really really really close to beating my Italian grandmother's secret recipe, but that leads to a lifetime of questions and heartache on my nonna. So, its easier to say that grams are better and avoid the remaining years of rejection by telling her a little white lie.

Dessert was the highlight (as expected) as my Tiramisu was not only flavorful but semi deconstructed as the lady fingers were on the side that you could dip into the cake and creme combo. My friend's salted caramel ice cream came loaded with bits of dark chocolate and an awesome biscotti.

If the restaurant wasn't in the Venetian/Palazzo's Grand Canal Shoppes: A) It would be way busier and the menu prices wouldn't be so high; and B) it wouldn't have awesome floor to ceiling windows facing the strip that make the space even more visually enjoyable.

The food was great, fresh and tasty and not too much, but enough to share tastes with everyone at the table. I had the linguini and white clam sauce, it was delish. I also appreciated that most dishes were slightly under salted. The flavors really came out. But, if you go for no other reason, go for Giorgio!  Even though the place was crazy busy he took the time to give us special service. I've been in family-run trattorias in Italy and that's how Giorgio made us feel, just as if we were in his family's kitchen. It's Buddy's, don't skip dessert!

What always blows me away is the line across from the restaurant for his bakery, it usually is formed at least halfway down the corridor.  All I can say is the bakery must be delish....but I digress.

We only had to wait 10 minutes for a table at lunch which you can sit in the bar or wait in the corridor.  We were seated in the bar area.  The best way to describe the vibe here is casual chic.  The restaurant feels very open yet has a Brooklyn restaurant feel to it.  Servers are dressed casually and make you feel very comfortable.

I would have liked the server to be a little more friendly...don't get me wrong she was very efficient...just didn't seem happy to be there.  However she gave us great service and everyone has those days so it did not take away from the experience.

I had the eggplant parmesan  which was HUGE and delicious.  No way I could eat it all or even half of it...but I sure did enjoy trying.  Hubby had the spaghetti and loved it.  The cheese garlic bread is like an entree on its own...perfectly toasted with yummy gooey cheese.We both enjoyed the menu as all of the entrees have special ties to the owner like My Wife's Eggplant Parmesan or Lisa V's Linguine, this just gives you the feeling of being in an Italian grandmas kitchen.

Hubby ordered a Buddy V's lobster tail for dessert and I can tell you they look just like they do on his tv show...big and stuffed full of tasty goodness.  I only had a bite as i was still trying to tackle the eggplant parm but it was magnificent.

We show up and get seated very quickly it was about 8:45-9:00pm we are sitting for five minutes when a biased comes to the table and asks us if we would like some water...sure he brings us water...we've never been here before so we are taking our time with the menu and decide to order mozzarella as an appetizer when our server finally arrived at our table we had already drank our glass of water it was a good 15 minutes after we sat down...unacceptable if you ask me! I don't know his name cause he talked so fast and was trying really hard with what seemed like a fake accent to be ""cool"" and laughed at himself....we told him we've never been here and that we would like to order the mozzarella...he then said are you ready to put on your Order for dinner...I said could I have a few minutes he then proceeded to say that I wanted the Veil Parmesan without giving me time to look uhh ok I guess I'll have that since you are in such a rush for me to order when you haven't even put in my appetizer...my boyfriend ordered lasagna...
I never saw my server again...well not willingly anyways...I had to flag him down for more water...the buss men were passing out cheese bread and vinegar and oil to every table that was there...except us not once were we offered anything nor where my drinks refilled without having to ask!! I wanted to order a soda and nope didn't even get to do that!!!
Our appetizer came was different and so yummy!!! Server never came to see how we where....our food came no server nothing...what if I didn't like my food...oh but I had to flag a biased down again for more water even though they have walked by my table 100 times and I know they seen my water empty!!!
So on with it...I had to yell for my server who had been ignoring us after I've asked for him 3 times by a bus man he came I said may I please have a box...10 min later my box arrived...he asked if we wanted desert I said may I see a menu!!(been wanting Buddy's lobster take for years almost went to New Jersey just to try one!!) then my boyfriend asks for a manager cause the special request he set up was to have a lobster tail desert show up to the table as a surprise with writing on the plate saying happy anniversary....my boyfriend was so upset that they ruined the surprised when he talked to the manager he kind of still felt like it was no big deal!! A new server delivered our desert and the comped it(didn't asked them to nor did we want them to) 

At the end of everything the SERVICE WAS HORRIBLE! I have been in customer service my whole life never would I treat someone the way we were treated!! We felt abandoned when the people around us where being well taken care of!!!

I give a HUGE SHOUT OUT TO THE KITCHEN THOUGH!! FOOD WAS AMAZING!!! I don't eat leftovers never have my whole life but I did eat the left overs for dinner Saturday!! That says something!!

Everything she said about the bar was accurate: Comfortable, great view of The Strip and really friendly employees.

Honestly, it was not easy to find this place and I know my way around The Venetian as a longtime fan of Grand Lux Cafe and that casino floor where I once played blackjack with 90210 hottie Lindsay Price.

My bartender at Buddy V's was a tremendously nice guy named Mike and he poured me a strong vodka cocktail.

The entire place just smelled too good to not at least look at the menu while sipping so Mike steered me right in a modest order of Grandma's Meatballs with some delicious bread that was exactly the right amount of food.

This simply was not your typical Vegas bar or restaurant experience...and that's why I will be back on my next visit.

Oh, and the place has some nice windows that overlook The Strip and a few tables are right against these windows if you want to just eat, drink and take it all in.

Buddy V's wasn't too loud, wasn't too snobby, wasn't too busy and wasn't too expensive either.

My friend and I came on Saturday and we sat at the bar since it was happy hour. We ordered the sausage and pepper sliders, mac n cheese and Italian birthday cake. And we were very pleased with our order. The sliders tasted like what you would expect typical sausage and peppers, but tasty. Mac n cheese had chicken and veggies, which is more like a entree versus what most Americans think of it being a side dish.  Service was standard and considering we sat at the bar I've never had a bartender treat me poorly, but I must admit she was kind of awkward towards us. Lastly, the Italian birthday cake was really moist, but not dippy. I can't wait to come here again and try the Chicken Parmigiana, a customer next to us ordered this and it looked delicious.

I was craving lemon chicken and saw on the menu they had chicken paccata, which is close enough if I modify it. So my husband and I walked from our hotel over to Buddy Vs without having a reservation. When I first saw the place, and how large it was, I kind of thought this might be just a so-so place, maybe closer to fast food than I had hoped. But it absolutely was not fast food. It was lovely.

Upon being seated, our waiter (Peter) immediately came over to inquire about drinks. When I went to order, my picky self literally needed to modify everything (sorry, chef). Instead of a salad, I asked if I could have just tomatoes and cucumbers with a little lemon. For the chicken piccata, I asked for it without the capers and without any garnish. Sweet Peter says, ""oh, so you basically want lemon chicken?""  Be still my beating heart. Yes. My cucumbers and tomatoes (at least 3 different varieties) came out quickly and were fresh and delicious. My lemon chicken came out exactly as I wanted it.

From the person filling the water, to the person bringing bread to the table, to the person delivering the food, and - of course - Peter, the service was way beyond our expectations. Not once was I made to feel that my modifying the food was a problem, which is huge to a picky eater like myself. Everyone was genuinely nice, enough so that we went out of our way to find the manager before we left to let them know how happy we were.

If I am in Las Vegas again, I will definitely visit this restaurant and will specifically ask to sit in Peter's section. I hope he knows he can never, ever quit.  :)",rjyuU4cYaVuoeP7gd6WBeA,0,1,5,qt6y2wsI699n4B8dIgvjPQ

Buddy V's is located inside the Palazzo and on one side is the restaurant and on the other side is the cake shop. We had reservations for 7pm on a Sunday night (on Memorial day weekend) and we still had to wait a pretty long time to be seated. So much for a reservation, but that's not too huge of a deal I guess. I was just getting tired standing in my heels lol. 
Aesthetically, this plays feels very home-y, which I liked. There were photos of Buddy and his family members incorporated into the dessert menu (it was really cute), and there were photos all around the restaurant--makes you just feel good inside when you know that this is a longtime family tradition! 

We were seated and a few minutes passed before we met our server. He introduced the idea that we could order family style or we could just order individual plates. Although ordering family style would probably be a more economical option, it was just too much fuss to do with a group of 8 girls. A lot of us (including myself) ended up getting the chicken parm, and a few others ordered a pasta dish (the one with the vodka sauce, I forgot the  name). ALL OF THE FOOD WAS SO DELICIOUS. WOW. Even the appetizers and bread that we got was finger-licking good. JUST LET THE CARBS WIN. GET THE FOCCACIA BREAD APPETIZER TOO. You'll thank me later... 

Although we didn't need the server too much, he was nowhere to be found, never really checked up on us, so service gets a ding. 
The price point was really reasonable given the enormous portions we got (chicken parm dish gives you 2 large breast cutlets; this is easily shareable). We had tons of leftovers that we happily ate after a long night of dancing. 

The only reason this review gets 4 stars is because the service. It was just lacking. But everything else, just superb! Superb food, superb pricing, portions, value, etc. I try not to eat that many carbs, but when in Vegas, carb it up. And come here to do it.

The service was great and everything tasted homemade from family recipes. We didn't eat again the rest of the day and there was something for everyone (except fish) since its Italian.
I do have a suggestion though:
If you are eating at Buddy's how about providing a menu for the pastry shop across the way and having those to go orders ready and waiting. Having to wait in line shouldn't be something you have to do if you have already splurged on the meal.

A long line outside the bakery across the hallway, but no wait for the restaurant, possibly just because it was FILLED with exhaust/smoke. They assured us it was not normally that way and let us pick our table in the least-smoky area of the restaurant, which overall got better as we went. Not sure what the issue was.

The octopus salad was super small, so I was glad I wasn't that hungry. More so, the octopus smelled like tuna in a can. I've never had octopus that smelled bad, and almost didn't eat it, but took a chance. The special Cake Boss dessert cocktail was strong, gross, and the red velvet crumbs on top weren't even red. 

There are two cakes on the dessert menu, and we got both. The chocolate cake was underwhelming, but the Italian Birthday Cake.... oh my gosh amazing. Is this really what Italian Birthday Cake is like? We have been DOING. IT. WRONG. Chocolate ganache filling AND cannoli filling, covered with mounds of fresh whipped cream, sliced almonds. Definitely Top 5-10 desserts of my life.

Our waiter Charlie was very nice, but he was overbooked it seemed as it took 12 minutes for someone to take our drink order, and we often waited and waited just to have someone walk by so we could grab their attention. I also asked him 3 separate times to bring the check before he did. 

It all felt extremely, extremely overpriced, too. $100 for 2 entrees, a cocktail, and 2 desserts, that mostly were not very good? Meh.

On one hand, we were incredibly impressed with the quality of the food. We're accustomed to plain-jane low-budget Italian restaurants (that many people scoff at even calling Italian) like Olive Garden. Buddy V's was accommodating and everything we tried was exquisite. They even made a custom Alfredo sauce for me that they don't have on their current menu.

I had the eggplant parmesan with added Alfredo, as well as the cheesy garlic bread and a caesar salad. The eggplant was perfectly crispy on the outside and juicy and full on the inside. And the Alfredo was to die for, especially since I had been craving it so bad. And their caesar salad had croutons made of polenta! Definitely never had that before! It reminded us of tofu at first, but we knew it couldn't be. So good!
The fiancé also was in love with his lasagna but had devoured way too much bread for sure beforehand, and whined that he couldn't finish the size. Haha. 

The downsides of this place is that it was busy, so we ended up having to ask for our own complimentary bread and balsamic/olive oil dip that only about half the restaurant was getting. Also we got sat next to this horrendous couple that were so weird and probably bored with their lives that they sat there discussing and making fun of us like we wouldn't be able to see and hear them.

As for the pasta, nothing exciting about the flavors or presentation. The ravioli dish looked messy and rushed. Reminds me of Chef Boyardee canned raviolis (except bigger) that when you microwave them the sauce splatters everywhere on the plate. 

As for dessert, we shared a cannoli. That was good but seemed a bit soft on the shell. Not sure if it was pre-made so it was starting to get soggy or just a softer shell recipe but not the crunchy cannoli I was expecting.

We got an order of Nina's mozzarella en carozza.  It was like having a toasted cheese sandwich with mozzarella cheese with some tasty marinara.  It was very good.  We shared the order and each had two wedges.

For our mains, my wife ordered  Nonna's lasagna.  It came with beef, pork, sausage, and four kinds of cheese and it was huge.  We could have split this between the two of us had we known how large it would be.  It probably weighed a pound at the very least and it was very good.  We brought 2/3 of it home and have it frozen for a meal for the two of us.

I got the Sunday Gravy.  How could I not go with his signature dish.  It's meatballs, sausage, lamb, and pork simmered in a Sunday gravy and served with a bowl of rigatoni.  The rigatoni was a sensible serving size, but when you added all the meat, this also was a dish that could have been shared.  This dish is worth the praise it gets from reviewers.  The Sunday gravy is excellent and the meat is so tender from the hours of cooking in the gravy!  Saving room for dessert, we opted to have part of this boxed also.

For dessert, we wanted something small and went with our server's recommendation of the Nutella Cake, cake with a warm Nutella center, chocolate sauce, some praline crunch, and served with salted caramel ice cream.  It was delicious and perfect to share at the end of the meal.

Our server, Graciela, was a gem.  She was around often to check on us.  The bus people refilled iced tea glasses quickly,  Service was very good!  The only drawback was the large Palazzo sign along the Boulevard which was at the level of the windows and was extraordinarily bright.

We eventually got there and settled in for happy hour -- which lasts till 6:30 pm. Great deal -- $4 wine/proseco/sangria and $5 appetizers.  We enjoyed the calamari, meatballs, and mac n cheese (it was delicious).

Headed to the front desk at 6 pm for our dinner reservation and they assigned us a table right outside the open kitchen hub.  When I requested something quieter?  She walked me back to the bar area!  First I was a little annoyed -- why did I make a reservation if I'm still in the bar?  But turns out it was for the best, a quiet window table in the bar area with a view of the strip.  Perfect.  We were able to order another round of happy hour drinks and their pre-theater menu for $38 pp!

Opting for light choices, we had the tomato soup, salmon, and cannoli.  Salmon was cooked perfectly and the cannoli was a perfect ending.

Both servers in the bar were EXCELLENT, friendly, and attentive.

Sadly, our only disappointment was the quality of the happy hour drinks.  The chardonnay was very dry, which is great for some people, but the big issue was the sulfites in the wines.  Really didn't enjoy the chardonnay or the proseco.

Otherwise, lovely restaurant with good food and great service!",uw3MVkLgUpVKncunVFSktA,0,0,4,Jv_lKjZH60Vu3c6N8GVHzg

Part of the reason we decided to check out this spot was because of the amazing drink special. We were sold on the $14.95 for bottomless drinks, thinking that the food would be a run of the mill Vegas buffet. Our group of 9 ended up arriving pretty late to our reservation due to traffic and the navigation of the hotel. Our waiter, Charlie, couldn't have been more understanding and cool about it. When we ordered our drinks, we found out that with the special you could switch your drink at anytime. Because of that, our boy Charlie was generous with keeping a mixture of carafes on the table, and kept them flowing! Once we actually got started on the buffet.... Wow. Everything was DELICIOUS. I highly recommend the Mac and Cheese (it was on my plate every single time!)  Overall for the price of the buffet/drinks and the actual quality of the food, this place is a steal!

This is the kind of sauce that makes me want to step up my game because it Puts my gravy to shame !! For the meal I ordered the bucatini carbonara - again it knocks your socks off. The pasta is cooked perfectly , pancetta is crispy and the sauce light and creamy.. Simple and elegant . For dessert I ordered the tiramisu which came in a 2 oz canning jar and 3 lady fingers ..

He ate it before I could get a pic , and I didn't get to try anything he ordered except his dessert .

The spaghetti my sister ordered was extremely sour and the flavor was disgusting. One bite of it and my insides starting screaming. Mid-way through the meal, my sister needed to use the restroom.. for a while. 

My margherita pizza? Equivalent to the taste and thickness of a napkin. Zero flavor and toppings spread so thin, they must have evaporated upon baking.

After dinner, I left it to Lisa's Nutella Cake with Salted Caramel ice cream to save Buddy V's reputation. I mean, there's no way someone can mess those flavors up - the title alone is perfect. I was wrong. Overly sweet, dense, rich - one bite was too much (and must have contained at least 75g of sugar). The ice cream had nothing salted or caramel about it. I am a huge lover of desserts - and this made me so so sad.

Based upon strong portions, I highly recommend splitting with your dining companion (easier to do on romantic getaway than conference with ""the work guys!"")

On our visit in Dec., 2016, we split: calamari (good flavor), meatballs (yessir!) and chicken piccata.  This latter option had the most absolutely delicious pasta i have EVER HAD.  So much so, that despite the $7 addition, I asked the waiter for an extra side.  Huge mistake: by the time the kitchen made it, my tummy was starting to bloat.

But this is Vegas baby, so we still visited the bakery counter across the way!  One observation: they are really strict/ serious about the Happy Hour ONLY in the bar. As i recall, they were equally adamant that we would have to ""move tables"" to the main dining area (4 feet away) to order off the regular menu.  We didn't fuss with it.  You've been warned : - )

I've been coming to Buddy Vs for a few years now. No weekend trip to Vegas has been complete for me without Sunday brunch here. Their Bruch buffet features high quality breakfast and lunch dishes, fresh premium fruits, cheese, Italian cold cuts and best of all: the desert bar. The service has always been good and the overall value is reasonable for a major resort Strip front restaurant. 
Today I came for regular lunch. We ordered the salami and cheese platter, spaghetti Bolognese and tiramisu. As always, the food was outstanding. The three cheeses and three meats were of the finest quality and paired with freshly open-fire grilled garlic butter feloni bread. The Bolognese, while a simple dish, has always been one of our favorites here, as they do it perfectly. Saving the best for last, the tiramisu by itself is worth coming here for (and it's served as part of the Sunday brunch buffet as well !!). I also loved their new coffee from Fonte, which is a perfect pair with the tiramisu.

I finally had my chance to try both the sweet and savory while my husband and I vacationed in Las Vegas. 

Buddy V's restaurant and Carlo's Bakery are right across the way from each other inside The Venetian. The line for the bakery was a mile long, so we opted to have lunch and enjoy one of the desserts in the restaurant instead. I loved the feel of the place. It was cozy and warm with large windows to view the gorgeous strip. 

They serve warm focaccia bread with olive oil to start. It was so light and fluffy... We both asked for a second piece even though we promised each other we would save room for that dessert! They offer a prix fix lunch special for $22, which is what my husband ordered. You can choose from a few slightly smaller portions of appetizers or salads, entrees or pastas, and desserts. He went with the meatballs, chicken parmesan, and cannoli. I had the whole wheat penne primavera, which included all sorts of tasty grilled veggies. My husband split his cannoli with me... I really didn't give him a choice. :p It was stuffed with sweet ricotta and dipped in chocolate chips and pistachio. Not to diss my hometown of St. Louis, known for its Italian foods and restaurants, but this was the absolute best cannoli I've ever had in my life!

Wir sind dort spontan aufgetaucht und haben auch ohne Reservierung noch einen Platz bekommen. 

Allerdings nur im Bereich der Bar an einem kleinen Tisch für Zwei mitten im Raum. 
Etwas ungemütlich platziert. 

Die Geräuschkulisse ist extrem anstrengend. Man muss sich ziemlich laut unterhalten. Dabei ist es egal, wo man genau sitzt, da der ganze Laden einfach laut ist. Das wird auch nicht besser, wenn die Live-Musik aus Schlagzeug und Keyboard wieder anfängt zu spielen. An der Stilrichtung der Musik ist allerdings nichts auszusetzen. 

Wie zu erwarten ist das Essen typisch italienisch. Man kann sogar zwischen der uns bekannten Bolognese-Sauce und der Soße mit Meatballs wählen. 
Wir haben die erste Variante genommen. Die Nudel waren schön al dente und die Sauce sehr lecker abgeschmeckt und mit reichlich Fleisch. Portion war auch angemessen. 

Für den Preis muss man halt Vegas-Maßstäbe ansetzen, aber immer noch erträglich. 

Abzüge gebe ich aufgrund der Lautstärke. Nach dem ganzen Trubel am Tag wäre es schön beim Essen Abends mal etwas die Ohren entspannen zu können.

4299050,2017-05-21,0,nUpz0YiBsOK7ff9k3vUJ3A,"Was super excited to come here being a huge lover of Italian food and a Cake Boss fan.  We were seated relatively quickly in the ""patio"" area for their happy hour.  We started off with small bites right away, but our waiter never came back to take our freaking entree order.  We sat there patiently for half an hour after finishing our appetizers.  He specifically knew we were ordering more since we said we'll start off with the appetizers and asked to leave the menu since we were still ordering an entree.  While we were waiting for him to come back, the host grabbed the menu off our table and gave it to the table next to us, without even asking if we were done. We continued waiting and were so annoyed we didn't even order more food. So after 60 minutes of waiting for them to take our order, even though we told someone to grab out waiter so we could order earlier, we just asked for the check, which took another 30 minutes.  It's not like it was busy. Maybe 25% of the restaurant was full, and they had a separate person seating, a separate person taking order, another delivering the food, and another cleaning the tables and refilling water. Not to mention he was one of like 4 waiters, and the place isn't that big.  He charged us $16 for a medium beer, which is totally fine, but other waiter told us it should've only costed us $12, and then they said just kidding.  Seems kind of steep to go from $9-small and $16-medium. I'm a waiter so I'm pretty big on tipping.  Didn't bother to tip as the service was awful. I think our waiter's name was Danny or something. The host sucked too for grabbing our menu without asking, like dude, come on.  They were middle aged people so this was most likely their full time job since we went on a Thursday.

Never watched Cake Boss, so didn't know anything about the celebrity status of the chef. We didn't have reservations and tried to get a table around 6:45pm on a Saturday for 2 people. Apparently there was a private event so they couldn't seat us til after 9pm, but luckily there was a table at the bar, so we took that. The bar is a bit noisier than the restaurant, but totally worth it to not wait. Before 7pm, they have a 3 course menu  for $38 which includes an appetizer, entree, and dessert. 

Loved the moist and soft Grandma's Meatball appetizer. You only get 3 and they are half dollar sized. For my entree, I got the bolognese. Absolutely delicious and extreme chunky sauce. I also loved the fact that they were very generous w/the sauce so that I actually had plenty of sauce for my pasta! Even had some sauce left over to dip a piece of bread!

4350366,2016-11-28,0,nUpz0YiBsOK7ff9k3vUJ3A,"Long review: First off let me start by saying this review is not about the food. The food is amazing. I've been coming here for 3 years in a row for my birthday and once for our anniversary and the food has not disappointed once. 
This is about their service. Like I stated I, with my family, having been here 3 years in a row and have received excellent service and food, until this last time in August. I originally called to reserve a table for 8 guests and a baby. I was later informed that one more person was to be added, so I called to see if I can get a bigger table. I was told I couldn't because it was a busy night for them, that maybe we could squeeze another chair, that was fine since it was for a kid. When we sat down there was so space for a car seat sling, my cousin's baby was on the floor behind her chair. The manager did not want to move us to a bigger table, which there were plenty of! The whole time we sat and ate and left there were bigger tables all around us! How is having a baby sitting in a car seat on the floor behind the chairs next to another table safe? We asked if this was a hazard or safe or a fire hazard and she kept saying no. We felt uncomfortable leaving him there (he was 2 months at the time) so my cousin had to hold him the whole time we dined. Then came time to pay. We could not do split. He la according to the waiter, the ""computer"" wouldn't let him. So we all wrote down our amounts and the card number on the back of the receipt. He then came back to say we were short. He was talking about the SUGGESTED gratuity. When then explained we would add gratuity when we signed the receipt. He said again that the ""computer"" would not let him because the total of the bill was the amount with the SUGGESTED gratuity includes. How is this even possible? My cousin tried arguing with him other wise but the waiter would not budge! He was determined to get his suggested gratuity. My cousin was getting rather upset so we budged and paid the total and walked away. Happy 30th to me! Sad to say that even though I LOVE the food here, this will no longer be my annual birthday dinner spot.",LN-vWOEme6TyfRlb13th8A,0,1,3,b-ejW2ZdBTtbYXCDgPYIxw

The service has been attentive and friendly. Both times I had reservations and was seated right away. 

On my most recent visit I started with the Caesar Salad. The salad was basic and not overly exciting, but the polenta croutons on top were tasty. The warm bread served with oil and vinegar was pretty good. 

Spaghetti and Meatballs made for a hearty, delicious lunch. The meatballs were fairly seasoned and I liked the spaghetti sauce on the dish. My friend's Chicken Parmesan was my favorite of the two dishes though. The chicken had plenty of breading and cheese. 

I'm a big dessert person and both hit the spot for me. The Cannoli had a great tasting filling with yummy chocolate chips and pistachios on one end. I just tasted the Cheesecake, but loved the flavor and I don't usually care for cheesecake.

Buddy V's is probably not my first pick for Italian in town, but a solid option if in the area. A big perk is Carlo's Bakery across the hall for more post dinner sweets.",3nIuSCZk5f_2WWYMLN7h3w,4,3,4,9DXBgH2PDraKPRKp-r8f3A

 I had the Sunday gravy it was a nice assortment of meats sausage, lamb, and pork in marinara sauce. My girlfriend had the sea bass and gave it high marks. I don't eat fish so I can't vouch for it personally. We finished with the Italian birthday cake. It was very moist and flavorful without being too sweet.

Well, it wasn't the Venetian, where I was lucky enough to park and walk from. Grrrr!  After getting the waiter to confirm, use the Palazzo Valet, but it's still a little trek. 

The waiter was super friendly and nice, even when I returned my soda, because it had a funny smell. I promise it wasn't me...I made half the table confirm it smelled bad. 

I asked the waiter what was good and he said many things. I mentioned the chicken parm, because so many people on yelp ordered it, and he said that was a good option. So I went for it.  Buyers remorse!!  It was decent, don't get me wrong, but the guy across from me got a burger that looked amazing!!!  Who would have thunk it...a burger at an Italin joint?!  Next time!

The parm was ok, and most would probably love it, but I am super picky about my sauce, being raised in an Italian pasta sauce making family. It did have two big pieces of chicken, fried well, and not dry with ample cheese on top. I wouldn't throw it away, but it wasn't OMG, I am ordering this again.  I already know I will be ordering the burger next time. :P

I also wish I had room for the lobster tail dessert, but I just don't. :(

Everything was so delicious. The garlic bread was a meal by itself. The portions here are huge, so you better go here with a huge appetite.And lastly we got the lobster tail and this was the cherry on top it was light,airy, and yummy! I'm very excited that the cake boss opened a restaurant in sin city! Now I don't have to drool all the time while watching him make amazing pastries on tv, I can just stop by Buddy V's ristorante instead!

Hostess staff was warm and welcoming. Started off with a nice Brunello and Caprese with burrata cheese and organic heirloom tomatoes,  accompanied with grilled Italian bread. The manager Kristina was very attentive and brought us their nicest red wine glasses for our Brunello, which we really appreciated. The Caprese was one of the best my husband and I have ever tasted. We have been blessed to spend lots of time in Italy and have had some spectacular Italian meals. Buddy V's was right up there with the best we've had in Florence, Rome and Tuscany. The pasta was perfectly al dente, prepared by Executive Chef Bryan, who we had the pleasure of meeting. We finished our meal with their spectacular cannoli's that were clearly made fresh to order based on their crunchy shell. We can't say enough about our experience at Buddy V's.....from the hostess, busboys, server, managers. This group definitely worked well together just like a big Italian family.",_aca3jYHP8X6hx4z_CsPzw,0,1,5,8rw8ymmDPk9ntEb_C1kmpQ

The Sunday Eggs were our favorite, and my wife isn't much of a fan of scrambled eggs.  The frittata had a lot of huge chunks of vegetables, especially asparagus.  The meatballs, chicken apple sausage, freshly smoked bacon, chicken parmesan, and mac-n-cheese were all excellent.  Of course, there were croissants, fresh breads, pastries, cannolis, tiramisu, zonuts, and other desserts.  The food was all delicious and far exceeded our expectations.

We also had all you can drink alcohol.  My wife had bellinis, sangrias, and mimosas.  I had a few beers which, unfortunately, was cheap domestics, but whatever.

In short, it's awesome. It's probably our favorite brunch on The Strip due to the selection, quality, value, and service. 

The selection is huge and there's a menu online but for a brief recap there's a carving station (ham, bacon, 2 kinds of sausages), shrimp cocktail, eggs/frittata, charcuterie station, a couple kinds of pasta, meatballs, chicken parmesan, salad, french toast, crespelle, pastries, like 5 kinds of cookies, like 4 kinds of cakes, cannolis, and fruit. A nice touch is that there's two sets of meatballs/chicken parmesan so if one is empty you can get some from the other station. They were great about refilling the dishes and every trip I went up, everything was available.

It's a buffet so don't expect things to be the same as ordering from Buddy V's off the menu. That being said, it was all still very good. Even the fruit was good (because it was sweet), and they had more exotic options like dragon fruit and rambutan as well. 

Service was friendly and they were very good about refilling drinks and clearing plates. All that said, I think what you get is very good for the price.",89MRppNHY1wtoI0V7vqdSA,0,0,5,rwap5eP0MI6Q7_ovDZEN7Q

The food in this place tasted like home in Brooklyn in my mother in laws kitchen. The restaurant is in a wing of the Venetian and across the way from it, is Carlo's Bakery. (You can easily access the restaurant from outside the Venetain. Its above the Walgreens close to the Deuce stop. Almost like you are leaving the Ventian and walking towards Palazzo). The restaurant was very pretty with gorgeous views. The vibe is very causual, laid back, like you stopped by a friends house. Any clothing goes. No dress code. Not at all stuffy and pretentious like Giadas. (see review). We had a friend with us from Texas who had never had NY Italian food, so we had to take her there and see if it was authentic. Authentic it was. We started out with the mozzerella and Carozz that was amazing. I got the ""Sunday Gravy""- which is exactly how we make it here. You get a bowl of pasta, with a seperate skillet of red meat sauce with meatballs (OMG delish), pork shoulder, lamb. My husband had pasta bolongese. Insanely good. My Texas friend had the lasagne. It was huge and she ate it for 3 days. All portions were big. The food was not pricey. The dessert menu comes in what looks like an old photo album, and it contains pics of a young Buddy and family with his dad, and then pics of him with his own kids. The whole place is decorated in family pictiures in frames on the walls. For dessert, we had the Nutella (yes Nutella) Lava cake!! OMG. Melted Nutella runs out of the center of this lava cake served with Salted Caramel ice cream. There are no words. Get yourself there  ASAP. You will not be sorry. It was so good, we went twice during out 10 day stay. Had to go back for lunch and got more meatballs, eggplant parm and 2 amazing salads. My new fav place in Vegas.

Went personally at noon to confirm reservations, as the two ladies in our party of four were celebrating birthdays, and wanted to make sure we would get window seats.  The original reservations were made at the same time room reservations were made by the pallazo hotel.  We were told we would be given window seats. Well the hostess said she could not guarantee, but made a note of the request as well as the birthday celebration.
We arrived at 4:45pm fifteen minutes early, and found an almost empty restaurant.  As luck would have it, the original hostess was there.  She said she would be able to seat us ""near"" a window table.  I laughed and said, well it looks as though you have lots of tables.....her comment was to go sit in the lounge ""bar"" area until our reservation time.  Trying to sell drinks I suppose.  We sat there , not ordering drinks, and she started to seat us away from the window....again I reminded her, and miraculously she found a table.. It dawned on me later (after my wife explained) she was fishing for a tip to ""find a table""
Anyway, we ordered.   The Lasagna came, large portion, lots of cheese and meat, little skimpy on the sauce.  Wife had Chicken Parmesan which was overcooked and little sauce.  The other couples order consisted of a new York steak which she raved about, but her husband had steak and lobster, and said the steak he had was tough, but the lobster was good.  
Table service was good, lots of flat bread, water refills.
Oh....if you happen to like a nice fruity White Zinfandel (the fastest growing wine category in the US) you will not get it there.. They don't carry one,  I know some restaurants are a bit snobbish because its a ""blend""  

So regarding the birthdays?  Well most restaurants will make an effort to do something to acknowledge a celebration.... Desert came and went, nothing...

Anyway, I know they have not been open for very long.  Our waiter was good, food runners ok...The Floor manager spent his time looking from a distance, but made no contact with the customers.

4748146,2013-12-10,0,nUpz0YiBsOK7ff9k3vUJ3A,"After spending most of the day in the sportsbook, I was ready to chow down and my belly was craving some Italian food. Upon check in at the Palazzo, my wife and I were handed a coupon book to select restaurants, bars, etc. inside of the Venetian and Palazzo. This included a coupon for Buddy V.'s. So we decided give this place a shot when we saw that this place had opened recently and had received four stars on Yelp. 

We started off on the light side of things with a Caesar salad. There was nothing particularly great about this salad except for the croutons. I'm not really a crouton fan because they tend to be too bland, salty and/or crunchy.  Normally I would pass over them completely. After my wife urged me multiple times and after I had refused multiple times, I saw my wife's fork with a crouton on the end of it right smack in front of my mouth. I succumbed to peer pressure and tasted what was probably one of the best croutons ever. The crouton had a crunchy exterior and then evolved to a smooth and creamy interior with a terrific garlic flavor inside. It was so delicious that I had to fight my wife for the rest.  Looking back, she probably regrets shoving that crouton in my mouth. 

I ordered the Nonna's Lasagna Al Forno which was served in an incredibly hot iron skillet. I think the cheese was still bubbling a little bit when they brought it out to our table. This was probably one of the thickest lasagnas I have eaten in a long time. This lasagna came with generous portions of fresh Italian sausage and ground beef and layered with ricotta, mozzarella and provolone cheeses. The marinara sauce was a perfect blend of sweetness and spiciness and had settled to mostly the sides of the lasagna. The top was sprinkled with a tiny amount of Italian parsley. This was one of the best lasagnas I have had in a long time. Each bite melted in my mouth. There was no doubt I was going to finish dish.

Because of the reviews, tips, and photos of meatballs on Yelp, my wife had to go with the meatball spaghetti. Needless to say, she polished off the dish easily and said it was one of the best meatball spaghettis she had tasted. The meatballs at Buddy V.'s inspired her to go home and cook some meatballs herself. I think that in itself should speak volumes about their meatballs.

We had just enough room at the end to split their Tiramisu which was equally as delicious as our entrees. It was a nice touch to include a side of lady fingers in order to swipe any remaining coffee flavored cream at the end with them.

But she was right! The chicken parm was delicious! I personally don't like chicken, but this was juicy and crunchy, covered with hot marinara sauce and cheese covering it all.  It also came with spaghetti marinara on the side.

Other folks in our party had bucatini and it was rich with great fresh pasta. Was not over sauced to allow all flavors. We did the Price Fix menu which for $40 bucks gets you an app, entree and choice of dessert (cannoli or tiramisu). Meatball appetizer was really good though they are a little on the small size compared to Carmine's, Lavo or Matrianos. Chicken parm is a little thicker than other places but keeps the chicken juicy without too much breading. The red sauce on the parm and pasta side is super fresh tomato taste. We had one each of the cannoli and Tiramisu. Cannoli was crunchy with cream and chocolate chunks with a side of chocolate syrup. Wow was it good. Tiramisu was also very good and I liked because not to bitter with coffee taste. It comes in a little jar with a couple of side cookies. Both great for sharing at the table.

Caesar salad usually has hard-as-rock bread croutons. Not here. Buddy's croutons were amazing, soft, warm polenta/cheese cubes. Loved that!

 My experience was very enjoyable, from the good food to the excellent service.

Since it was a buffet, I ended up trying a lot of the food they had to offer. Some of the food that stood out to being especially good was the Sunday eggs, the chicken parm, panetone French toast, the caesar salad, the chicken apple sausage, and meatballs. There was mac and cheese there as well. This was the first time I had mac and cheese at a buffet or all you can eat setting, and it tasted exceptional. The noodles weren't over cooked, and the cheese sauce was tasty and creamy, there was a bread crumb like topping on it that help bring it all together. There was even some partially peeled shrimp there. Unlike some places, it was properly cleaned and deveined, on top of it not being over cooked and mushy. I wish the cocktail sauce that accompanied it had some more flavor and horseradish in it. The, what I were to assume, mini cannoli were excellent, even though they were already filled, the shell was still crispy and crunchy while the filling wasn't overly sweet.

All of the food I tasted had flavor, and was appealing to the eye, which tends to be a lacking attribute for a lot of buffet places. While you saw the cooks actually make the food, it actually tasted and looked like it was made from scratch, not something that came from a bag, frozen, or reheated from the day before.

The service was top notch. My glass was never less that 1/3 empty, and the busser made sure I always had fresh forks and knives when I came back with more food. The waitress and busser were very attentive, always making sure I was comfortable, enjoying myself, and asking if there was anything they could do for me.

Although tonight, it was crappy. My son was eating the cracker sticks and we placed the opened packet on top of the plates. The guy comes to pass out the plates but dumps the cracker onto the table. Literally took the plate and dumped it. Hello...my son was eating that and what kind of table manner/service is that. 

Then they came around with oil. He left and then a few minutes later came with bread. Our waitress finally asked if we wanted balsamic vinegar with it. I said yes, of course. I never had bread with just the oil! I guess the guys did that to the same table as well.

Boy was I wrong.  While the food was adequate, the service was non-existent.  To get anything, we had to constantly flag down staff members.  While some may accuse me of being too picky, I think the fact that the restaurant did not have fresh grated parm cheese available (they claim their wheel broke) is a major blunder for an Italian themed restaurant.  I mentioned how poor the service was to one of the floor managers on our way out, and all she could say was ""Please don't let that stop you from coming back.""  Really?  That's it?  Spend a couple of hundred dollars on dinner only to be told that?  I think it will be long time before I head back that way.  Which is too bad because the bone-in veal parm, with our without parm cheese, is really a wonderful dish. Ironically, shortly after we were seated, a table of 10 or 11 was seated next to us.

One of my favorites is Buddy V's.  They have great traditional Italian food that is simply prepared with the best ingredients.  The flavors and quality of the food for the price is pretty incredible for anywhere, but especially in Las Vegas.

One of my favorite dishes is the Bucatini Carbonara.  It literally calls my name sometimes.  The best carbonara I have ever eaten is in Austin, TX at a place called La Traviata, but I digress.

Buddy V's Bucatini Carbonara is pretty amazing.  It has just the right mixture of flavors and with the richness of the sauce is just amazing.  I have to confess I was a little high maintenance and asked for a flat pasta (linguine).
 
My dinner Caesar salad was large, but as Caesar salad go, pretty uninspired.  Don't get me wrong, it was good, but it wasn't up to the level of the pasta dish.

The wine list was reasonable (for Las Vegas) with several good selections by the glass.  Since I was dining alone, a bottle seemed an overindulgence.

If you are anywhere near the Palazzo, Buddy V's is a must.  You need to eat this food.  The one star deduct is for the just average Caesar salad.  Everything else was great.",q9F1L84m6l6Sqc93GXNAUA,0,0,4,tImmJiR9os2g62qb22IJGQ

Unfortunately they were booked for the night, but the hostess asked if we'd like to sit at a high top at the bar.  Since they offered the full menu we readily agreed.  Within minutes of sitting down we had waters and our waitress greeted us.  The service was great and she happily gave recommendations.  We started with the calamari and it was excellent, the fried anahiem peppers were a great counterpoint to the calamari, which was cooked excellently.  I ordered  the chicken parm and my wife had the chicken picata.  My chicken parm was delicious!  It was two chicken breasts fried to perfection topped with mozeralla and a side of spaghetti with marinara.  I'm very picky about my marinara, I can't  stand when it's sweet, and this was done really well.  Very savory and went perfect with the chicken.  My wife's picata was cooked wonderfully as well but was lacking in the citrus.  She asked for a plate of lemons and was able to season to get desire.  We finished off the meal with a lobster tail dessert.  The pastry was beautifully done, the cream rich and smooth, and the berries tasted very fresh.  

All in all it was a great meal, my only gripe was the decor / ambiance.  It was like they couldnt figure out what they wanted to be.  The decor was that of a nice italian restaurant, low lighting and dark wood.  But their menus looked so cheesy like something from Farrels and the busers all wore bright red shirts but the hostesses wore little black dresses.  They need to go either elegant or cheesy, either would be fine but straddling the line is kinda weird.",gOHhINnL8GQx7Y9GzzsIIw,0,0,4,BlYPHNBkcfRneEl2Gquqqg

I asked what it was and she told me white peach juice. I had her make me a drink with the juice and it was delicious. She was very generous with the champagne and I really appreciated that. I hate paying for a drink of mostly juice. My mom and I had a couple of them and took off to do some shopping.

5054194,2015-04-22,5,nUpz0YiBsOK7ff9k3vUJ3A,"I do not like being cheated out of my money, and sadly, guys, that's exactly what they did to me here. This is the first time I have stopped by in years after claiming they have the best tiramisu. It was so HUGE. And now.....it comes in a mini mason jar. 

I understand businesses have to make money, but some dishes and desserts have become painfully small and remained at expensive prices, which is just plain sad. 

Furthermore, they try to trick you into paying for water now. Instead of offering tap water like they used to, they get rid of the option in their speech. 
--SO if you DON'T want to pay for nestle water, and they say ""Still or Sparkling?""...SAY TAP. Don't pay for water unless you really want to. Because that is just a damn waste of $10 folks. 

They never used to trick me before, so I was totally not expecting this. I can't even rate them like I normally do, because I was so mad. 

The big points are: 
1) Their food is just average, so just skip it. 
2) The dessert is the better part of the meal, so if you want some, just go to Carlo's Bakery. 
3) They do have really good service, but they tricked me, so that was a little messed up since they didn't used to do that. It's totally what you expect restaurants that serve $80 per head to do. If you're going to do that, can't you at least do it during the more expensive dinner time?

When I realized that Buddy brought Jersey to Vegas, I couldn't wait to try it. It's difficult to find a restaurant on the strip that has character, good food, and great service. Buddy V's has all three. We made reservations on a weekday evening and the restaurant was about 3/4 full. The ambiance was casual with an upscale Italian vibe; translation: fine dining without leaving a hole in your pocket. Win Win. There were two people taking care of our table, so we got double the attention and service. Both our waiter and waitress were friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. We ordered ""My Wife's Eggplant Parm"" as an appetizer and chicken rigatoni alla vodka and Nonna's lasagna al forno as our mains. 

My Wife's Eggplant Parm- clever! I like how Buddy gives cred to those who deserve it. The eggplant parm was pretty much a tower of crispy goodness. Eggplant, melted mozzarella, tomato parm, eggplant, melted mozzarella, tomato, parm...you get the picture. The eggplant was had a nice crunch and the melty cheese and tart tomato sauce were a delicious combo. I'm using to a more traditional baked eggplant parm as opposed to the deep fried dish that was served. Don't get me wrong, it was delicious, but I was missing the deep flavors of the eggplant that was fried away. 

Chicken rigatoni alla vodka- rigatoni, pancetta, grilled chicken swimming in a decadent tomato cream sauce was heaven. I really enjoyed the creaminess of this dish. The sauce was a perfect combination of flavors (it's all about the sauce). This pancetta was a nice touch of smokiness. Super filling, you will have leftovers! 

Nonna's lasagna al forno- YES. CHEESY, MEATY, traditional lasagna with a ton of flavor. This hefty lasagna had Italian sausage, beef and pork, ricotta cheese, mozzarella, provolone and parmesan baked to perfection. Four types of cheeses people. It was cheesy. If you are looking for a classic and delicious lasagna, look no further. The only thing I was missing was a bit of sweetness in the tomato sauce. Otherwise, I would absolutely order this item again. Totally big enough to split. 

I truly enjoy traditional Italian food. Big portions, big flavors and lots of sauce. Warning, you will be in a food coma after you finish your meal. Come with an empty belly and be prepared to eat. We had a ton of leftovers which is what should happen when you go out for Italian food. I enjoyed the decor of the restaurant, the ambiance, as well as the service. We let our waitress know that we were on a time crunch, and she got us in and out of the restaurant in no time with full bellies and smiles on our faces. This restaurant was closer to Palazzo then Venetian and somewhat of a mission to find, but we found it and we were glad we did.

- She was born in Calabria, Italy
- Loves Italian food (given), but almost never goes out for Italian food since we have it with family often and her standards are high.
- She does not like to spend money, everything is compared to a cheaper alternative and rarely thinks money is well spent at restaurants. 

Our waiter hyped up the family style dining experience, which we usually do on our own. The fact they had a program to do so was great to hear, and it did not disappoint.

The food was amazing. Exceeded all of our expectations. We had a great spread that really covered all the bases from the menu. One dish was better than the next.

The waiter, Georgio, was the best in the business. I've eaten at great restaurants around the world and had great service but he was truly world class and made the night.

Orrechiete sausage pasta had good texture and flavor as well. For dessert the warm nutella cake was their most popular- it was great.

They had a buffet set up and for $34.95 we got to choose from an array of antipasto, pasta, meats, soups and desserts. We also took the option for all you can drink for only $16.95 additional which included peach Bellini, mimosas, sangria, domestic beer and wine. 

I took full advantage of the cheese board/antipasto area and filled my plate with prosciutto, salami, Gorgonzola, pecorino and focaccia bread. The marinated olive mix with peppers was delicious! Must try this. Also grabbed some iced peel and eat shrimp that had a nice spice to them that I wasn't expecting, but enjoyed. 

Chicken parm was a bit soggy from sitting in the hot tray unfortunately. Orecchiette and sausage pasta was simple, but great and probably my favorite thing.

We both got the Prix Fixe and it was so good! It seemed a little pricey at $40/person, but for what you get, it's better deal than you would think at first glance. 

The complimentary bread they bring for you to dip in oil & vinegar is as a type of a focaccia, so delicious. I don't care for Balsamic vinegar, so the waitress kindly brought some marinara for me, and that sauce was perfect. I chose the panzanella side salad, which was so huge and packed with goodness. They didn't just throw some salad mix on a plate! Very fresh, croutons made in-house and packed with flavor. The cheese, the tossed-in dressing, all in perfect proportion to the greens. Also noted that they halved the grape tomatoes, which is a sign to me that they pay attention to detail. (I love the taste, but hate biting into a whole grape tomato and having it burst.) 

As entree, I had the Bucatini Carbonara, which is a dish I am super picky about, and it was the best I've ever had! Pasta was perfect and I could have easily saved half, if I was a little less hungry, or it was less delicious. As it was, there was such a generous portion, I didn't finish it. 

My guy had Orecchiette and Italian Sausage. It looked lovely, and had some red peppers, broccolini, roasted tomatoes, and the spicy Italian sausage. Really, all the flavors he loves. I tried a bite, and it was fantastic. 

The wine  Paolo Scovino Dolcetta d'Alba 2013- was great pairing with pasta, just enough sweet and mild acidity and richness to be a wonderful accompaniment to the meal. It's a variety I hadn't tried before, so I have a new love. 

Tiramisu was beautiful and flavorful, not too much of any of the ingredients, and a couple of lady fingers on the side. My guy finished his cannoli in about 3 minutes, as well, so I'm assuming he liked it.

 The service was prompt and the waiters and bussers were extremely attentive. Our glasses were never empty, our table was never dirty. The staff was also helpful in making sure we knew where everything was and offered suggestions on the food and drinks. 

Speaking of food... The first thing I noticed was that the food was put out in small batches to keep everything fresh. You could really taste the freshness.

Spaghetti Pomodoro
Chicken Rigatoni Alla Vodka

Pro:
While the restaurant is usually quite lively, they separate the tables out in a way that makes conversation possible, which is usually an afterthought nowadays. The service was quick and practically invisible, which can be good or bad, depending on your preference.

The food itself was simple, solid Italian. You won't be disappointed, nor will you be blown away. It's a safe choice for a good evening out.

We ordered salads and the calamari appetizer and they also brought out complimentary bread and olive oil.  Everything was perfect as was the Pino Noir and Cabernet we were drinking.  

For the meals everyone tried different dishes which were almost all shared by the time the dinner was over.  We had eggplant parmigiana, chicken parmigiana, spaghetti and meatballs and cheese ravioli.  Everything was spot on and delicious. 

I finished my meal off with an espresso and two others shared a butterscotch creme brûlée.  As expected everything was perfect.

Our party of 8 came here around 10:30pm on a Sunday evening. We got seated quickly, even with our big party. None of us were very hungry, so we ordered all appetizers or small dishes and a couple of drinks. 

My boyfriend and I shared a Margherita Pizza (definitely big enough for two -- has about 8 small pieces). Both my boyfriend and I agreed that the pizza was really tasty!

I also ordered a Salad...I don't remember the name of it, but it was decent sized and tasted fresh. I was so full on pizza, I couldn't eat my whole salad. I definitely could have just done one or the other. 

I don't remember what the rest of my party ordered. There was a variety of dishes, but they all must have been good because I don't remember anything left on anyone's plate when we were done. This means the food was delicious! Or else we were all just hungry. Either way, it was good overall. 

Service was great. Our server was friendly and personable. I like that when it comes to servers!

My only gripe was that our food took forever to come out. We waited a good 15+ minutes before anything came out. That was a long time considering they weren't that crowded or busy when we were there. They may need to work out some kinks in the kitchen. 

On a side note, this restaurant has good views of the strip. I really liked that, and I spent awhile gazing out at the bright lights and the busyness of the strip. Good people watching!

5279837,2017-04-05,3,nUpz0YiBsOK7ff9k3vUJ3A,"Having enjoyed dinner shortly after opening with friends in town from Phoenix, the plan to re-visit Buddy V's at a later date somehow getting lost in the constant shuffle of Las Vegas' restaurant landscape, recent rumors from a trusted source suggested that the All You Can Eat Sunday Brunch pairs a good price to food better executed than it needs to be, something each day more difficult to find in the Casino properties of Sin City.

No doubt still a hot-spot amongst tourists, the restaurant itself just under capacity by noon as the line at Carlo's Bake Shop continues to snake out the door at all hours of the day, it was just past 11:15am that one adult and a child checked-in at the hostess podium to be quickly led to a tight two-top adjacent the open kitchen, food displays tempting on all sides as the décor of rolling pins, whisks and ingredients continues to impress without making the environment feel like a 'theme' restaurant in the least.

Half-expecting service to be sub-par, most of the full-time Buffets in town generally better suited to this style of dining than a place converting the dining room into a free-flowing event once a week, it was with greetings from a young man who poured water and occasionally returned to clear plates or refill Coffee that instructions were given to ""get started whenever you like,"" a quick perusal of the options that are mostly laid out on the tableside menu showing a decent variety, though certainly not the same multitude of options as the Hotel's AYCE space.

Obviously focusing on Italian American classics and Buddy's interpretation of the topic by way of long-time Chef Brian Forgione, it was with a plate of Charcuterie, Cheese and Baked Goods that the meal got underway, the 9-year old happy to see Peel n' Eat Shrimp offered, but confused as to why the Salami did not taste like the version offered at Von's, the quality theoretically superior and not nearly as processed but nonetheless lacking in flavor while the Prosciutto, Blue Cheese and Pecorino were all good specimens, though the Focaccia was nearly inedible and hard enough to make one wonder whether it had been baked the previous day.

Modestly impressed by the Croissant as well as two mini-Muffins, a Pain au Chocolat entirely forgettable as a result of too little filling, the decision to investigate the Cake Boss' desserts early was well served by a pot of Tiramisu that would rival any in town, the Red Velvet Cake also quite tasty with a most base and tangy frosting while the Cannoli was much like that across the way, already feeling the sog of being pre-filled and generally underwhelming.

Batting about .500 on Italian Cookies, the Almond Cluster and soft Chocolate far better than the dried Butter rounds topped in Sprinkles or Jam, it was with patience that a fresh pan of pasta was waited on as part of plate three, the Mac n' Cheese Carbonara far too heavily salted to be appreciated for any sort of subtlety while the small Breasts of pounded Chicken Parm and Orecchiette with Italian Sausage were better balanced if not particularly memorable, the surprisingly light Roast Vegetable Frittata offering some evidence of a kitchen that is capable of doing 'high volume' right.

Far more impressed by the Garlic Bread than the Focaccia, crispy and fragrant with just melted Mozzarella or when used to scoop up Grandma's Meatballs and Sauce that takes no short-cuts en route to a fresh Tomato flavor without any added sweetness, choices from the carving station including Spicy Italian Sausage and Smoked Applewood Slab Bacon are well-displayed and prepared properly, the youngster at the table also fond of the Maple-Glazed Ham and sticks of Beef Jerky procured from the Bloody Mary Bar.

Going back to the sweet stuff for plates five and six, the common occurrence of dirty stacked plates and an empty mug at this point almost more amusing than it was an annoyance, fans of Bread Pudding would be well advised to save room for Dessert as the version served hot from a steamer with Caramel Sauce and Whipped Cream is a custard-laden masterpiece that far outperformed Panettone French Toast that is a bit dry along the edges, a better investment for the sweet tooth being the dainty Crespelle served with Nutella, Pureed Raspberries and Whipped Cream...or perhaps a bag of piping hot Italian Donuts offered with the same trio for dipping.

**1/2Charged $36.95 per adult and $10.95 for a child, a price not inclusive of tax or tip, the question of whether Buddy V's Brunch is 'worth it' comes down to whether one prefers quality or quantity as well as an understanding of celebrity Chef branding, the recent Buffet upgrades at Wynn, Cosmopolitan and Caesar's seemingly a better value with superior service, though certain items and the chance to sample several of Buddy V's Signatures without investing in a full lunch or dinner seems worth it for fans or those looking for a family-friendly alternative to Grand Lux Cafe while staying at the Venetian",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,7,4,3,Um6PDIQYLAILfE_TPbQMZw

However, the reality is that this place was mediocre at best. I will start with the good. The service was good, the meatball appetizer was good, and the fresh bread was great. This is where it stops, the spaghetti was somewhat chef boyardee tasting and the chicken parmigiana lacked flavor. Consequently the only flavor from that dish was from the cheese, which was all cheese no chicken. At this point the wife and I chalk it up to a loss and believing the hype and figures hey the desert has to be good, after all it's the cake boss right. WRONG!!!! This was probably the most disappointing part of the meal we got the cannoli and tiramisu. The cannoli was bland and lacked any depth and the tiramisu was also boring lacked any real flavor and to boot was but in a small Masson jar. Oh let's not forget the cookies that were served with the cannoli they were as hard as a biscotti. Now I can chalk up the good as a loss but the desert really?! That should have been second to none.

My wife and I are typically appalled by kids menus because everything tends to be fried, or bathed in cheese; Buddy V's was no exception.  With that said, I ordered the kids chicken parm, however I requested the dish be with a grilled chicken breast, and no cheese. Our waitress gladly made the change, and my daughter loved the food. $12.00 for a kids meal is a little pricy, but it is the strip after all, and the food was a big hit with my daughter. I don't mind paying for quality.

The lunch menu is a little small, and I was wishing I'd looked at it before getting a table, I figured I'd just grab something with little expectation.  Big mistake! I ordered the adult chicken parm, and my wife had the chicken blt.  The pasta with the chicken parm was slightly al dente, and perfectly cooked. The chicken breading was crunchy with juicy chicken inside. 

My wife was a big fan of the thin piece of chicken that came on her sandwich, and the perfectly toasted bread.  The basil was fresh and tomato not mushy, another big hit.

I would have given a higher rating of not for the poor service.  Our waitress, Bethany, disappeared from our table for 20+ minutes. She took our order, and didn't come back until it we'd been finished eating for quite some time.  All in all, we'd come back for the food but the service needs some work.

These croutons were perfect, one-inch square cubes, caramelized to a perfect golden brown on the outside. Biting into one, I discovered a filling of warm polenta - also known as grits in some parts. It was apparent that these croutons had just come out of the oven, and they were HEAVENLY! I wished I could  have ordered a whole plate of them - they were that good. The rest of my experience at Buddy V's was outstanding - the main course, the service, the ambience were all great.

For the price, this place is reasonable. Other places are way more expensive. It is not a five star brunch, but it's a solid four star. 
This is a good place for families and it is a great place for kids.",leY7FqJ3NKPzpM5awAQ2-Q,0,0,4,2PgjH6DuVAXijw49wJ35mg

For appetizers we got some amazing Jersey mozzarella dish as well as a grilled cheese garlic bread. Both were amazing but now looking back perhaps we shouldn't have ordered two cheese appetizers. Cue in the awkward silence... Just kidding! No such thing as too much cheese! For entrees I highly recommend the lasagna, Sunday gravy and orecchiette with Italian sausage and broccoli I.

I called in a week ahead and made reservations for a Friday night. They were accommodating and I called the night before to confirm the reservation. The place isn't hard to find, but it can be better described..I was told it was across Barney's, but there are many levels and entrances. Anyhow, we were seated promptly, but without menus. The waitress came by a few min later and described that they do family style or menu if we prefer. We preferred the menu. Since we were pretty hungry, I ordered 2 fries for our table and we all ordered our food- some of us to share the meals. 
The fries came, and they were mediocre. Then someone came by with warm bread for the table- I wish they did this sooner so we knew. Or even mentioned it. Anyhow, food arrived and it was fine. I shared the chicken parm and it was decent. No one complained about the food, but no one raved about it either.

It wasn't too crowded and I wasn't sure what to expect. We were seated promptly given we had a reservation for 10. After looking at the menu a few of us decided to get a few different items and eat family style. 

// FOOD //
Margherita Pizza: sliced tomatoes, basil, fresh mozzarella. Simple and light. It's a medium sized crust, not crispy or too doughy. I really enjoyed this one with a little grated parmesan and crushed red pepper. 4.5/5

Buddy's Favorite Pizza:  spiced sausage, caramelized onions, fennel, four cheese. I didn't care for this one too much. The sausage and the blend of cheese didn't go well together. I would definitely go with the margherita pizza instead. 2.5/5

Spaghetti Central with Meatballs: Your basic and simple spaghetti with five meatballs. It was simple, but I thoroughly enjoyed the tomato sauce. I thought it had excellent flavor. I would definitely order this again and maybe try it with the bolognese next time. 4/5

Chicken Parm: Provolone, mozzarella, spaghetti marinara. This dish was excellent for sharing. It would have been too heavy if one person just got it, but it was great for our group. They give two chicken breasts with a decent portion of spaghetti on the side. The chicken parm was deliciously cheesy! 4/5

Overall, I was extremely pleased with the service and food at Buddy V's Ristorante. I will definitely be back for more of that tomato sauce goodness. The only thing that can possibly make this place any better is if they served you some fresh break with oil and balsamic in the beginning. Just saying...

I love Cake Boss's show so I had high hopes for his restaurant. We went at about 345pm on a Thursday afternoon. We were sat right away at a great window table that over looked the strip. It is always nice to feel like we are tourists here even though we have been here almost 3 years now.  We decided to get things we could share...so of course I had to order the garlic cheese bread and Mac.n.cheese to start. Both delicious. The garlic cheese bread was served with amazing marinara sauce. The mac.n.cheese was creamy had pancetta and peas with a crumb top on it. Delicious. Made the way mac.n.cheese should be...creamy goodness. For our main dish we ordered Buddy's favorite pizza and Bolognese. The pizza was yummy, sausage, grilled onions, fennel and 4 different types of cheeses. The crust of the pizza was cooked to perfection, a little crispness, but still soft and very tasty. The sausage was perfect with all the onions and cheese.  The only item I was not impressed with was the Bolognese...lack of flavor, creaminess, and the spaghetti noodles...we're just store bought...I guess since he is a baker...I expected homemade noodles...so I was a little disappointed...and the Bolognese I had at Bootleggers blows this out of the water. It was also $23 for a bowl the wasn't even big enough to feed my man. Had we only ordered this we would have left hungry....and we probably would not ever go back. But luckily we ordered other good dishes...so if we happen to be at the Venetian again and are craving italian...we would go again.

Buddy V's was literally on of the best restaurant I have been to in Vegas. To start the lobster tail (dessert) could make a grown man cry of joy, I literally would have been happy to stick a straw in it and suck out all the cream out instead of actually ordering a meal (Which is what I did the following day, pretty sure i gained about 10lbs just off of lobster tail filling)

Enough about the dessert (I'll be talking more about it more when I write my Carlos Bakery review, yes it was that good!) The entrees are not something to overlook either. Let me start out by saying I am a somewhat food snob when it comes to classier restaurant. While I have left some places questioning the quality based on what I paid this is certainly not one of those times. As far as Italian food goes it doesn't get much better, the quality is spectacular and there is nothing that I would have changed. To top it off the portions were HUGE!

I had only previously been to happy hour here, which is one of the best values on the boulevard from 4:30pm-6:30pm daily by the way, and had my mind set on a couple of items prior to walking in.  

Skipping formalities, like ya know...salad, we started with ""Grandma's Meatballs"".  The six spheres mixed with beef, veal and pork were very good and perfectly portioned for the group.  I usually prefer them pan-fried first before being dropped into sauce, which these were not, but eaters gonna eat and they disappeared within minutes.  

And funny how things are always extra special and endearing once ""Grandma"" is added to the front of it. Grandma's apple pie.  Grandma's pet rat.  Grandma's criminal record.  

The ""Bone-In Parm Chop"" was screaming out to me and totally rocked my world.  With a  hefty quantity of crispy, juicy veal meat doused in a mouth-watering marinara sauce and then finished in the oven after being topped with ooey gooey mozzarella and provolone cheese, this dish was outstanding, well presented, and worth the $42.  Being such a large entree, I'd recommend two people going in on it together while getting a few more appetizers to make it a better rounded meal.  I personally felt rounder afterwards.  

A couple of other ""can't go wrong"" items I was able to sample were the ultra meaty ""Nonna's Lasagna Al Forno"" and ""Veal Marsala"" with its rich mushroom ragu.  No room for dessert this time, but I am confident that I can count on this spot for a solid ""pasto"" in the future.",8DEyKVyplnOcSKx39vatbg,106,81,4,bT7-EVfpMzuYu4dmlXKi4g

We also had the Nutella cake with a scoop of ice cream if this wasn't a snack I'd say you can finish the lasagna on your own but it was a perfect share.

We arrived with a 1,5 year old toddler and my pregnant wife, they let us wait on the side - even we arrived before the peak time. We needed to ask for a highchair multiple times. Our server (Caleb H, if I can believe the name, what is on the check) was super pushy. He didn't event care about we are with a small child. No plastic cup was offered, not even straw for a child. As soon as we told him nicely we don't want any appetizer, he became even more pushy and extremely rude. 

We just wanted to have a nice dinner, and enjoy our first night in Las Vegas, in a special restaurant. Especially because it was the first experience for my mother in law from overseas - who loves Buddy btw, she even went to see his Hoboken cake shop! 

After we had our meal, Caleb never came to offer Parmesan cheese to our dish and hardy did any check back on us. It was super obvious, that we received ""different"" service, comparing to the table next to us. We felt really unwelcome. 

The food was really delicious and the busser/or server assistant was super nice and caring. He took care of us better, than our server. Unfortunately we don't know his name. He was the only reason we left tip for the server. We hope at least the server treated him better that night, than the paying costumers. 

The restaurant was really busy, so we had no chance to speak to a manager. So we couldn't leave any feedback personally.",XbPk2n2EXV5RRG7qCRWeYg,0,0,2,eb84-sjuyS40LJy9Y36Tog

1) As celebrity restaurants go, Buddy V's doesn't try to be trendy, rather it sticks to rustic italian fare and is very successful at it.
2) Pricing is actually more on the reasonable side than ultra expensive.  For $38.00 you can get a fixed price meal of an appetizer, entree and desert.  I had the Grandma's meatballs which were incredible, light fluffy balls of flavor in a red sauce; a pasta dish consisting of Bucatini, a thin tube spaghetti with pancetta black pepper and egg(this was my favorite dish of the night and is worth going back for more), and closed the night with nutella cake which was delicious.  Everyone at the table enjoyed their meals.
3) The service is fantastic. The waiter was very knowledgeable, guiding us with knowledge of all the dishes on the menu and providing prompt drink service and bread service.

First of all, the hostess and waitresses are very kind and attentitive. They were also informative as well since they knew it was our first time here at Buddy V's. I ordered bottomless mimosas, but you could also change your drinks to a sangria or a Bellini! I thought that deal was one I had to take! Their food was delicious!

Their ""Grandma meatballs"" were also very flavorful and satisfying  I've been to the brunch buffet in Paris but I've got to say this Sunday brunch buffet tops Paris!

5601709,2016-01-01,3,nUpz0YiBsOK7ff9k3vUJ3A,"When I was booking the Palazzo as the hotel for NYE 2016 I noticed they offered a $25 dining credit for Buddy V's. As I was choosing from several options the Buddy V's credit sealed the deal as I can always fall back on this restaurant to serve delicious ""homemade"" comfort Italian food. With this I convinced my family to dine here for dinner.

Dinner is a different beast from lunch. With lunch the No1DP and I are able to have a pretty quiet meal with plenty of natural sunlight. There's also not much activity going on in the middle of the day. Come dinner, especially on the day before NYE, the place was swamped and the tables were loud. There were also plenty of people in line to get a table or in line for the nearby Carlo bakery.

The 3-course pre-theater menu ($38/person) was a hit with everyone in my family. It made ordering a lot easier and since I was covering the dinner tab, along with the $25 credit made a Vegas dinner more reasonably-priced (but still expensive for regular casual Italian). What made it particularly appealing for me was that the menu options included my favorites: Grandma's Meatballs, My Dad's Bucatini Carbonara and Lisa's Warm Nutella Cake. These were the standout dishes I stated in previous reviews and I was very happy I could have all my favorites in one sitting. This was a lot of food - I remember eating cold bucatini carbonara the next day for breakfast (which BTW is still very good if you don't mind eating it cold).

In summary I've enjoyed both lunch and dinner at Buddy V's though the situations that I'll recommend both are different. I'll recommend doing small plates for lunch as the portion sizes are more manageable if you want to save your appetite for a big and fancy dinner. This is currently the arrangement for the No1DP and I whenever we're in Vegas. I'll recommend dinner as a non-date or casual date option if all a party wants is just some good comfort Italian food.

DINNER: 4.5/5.",7gNtYzygF7dB8e7k1mWdjA,6,6,4,L8b09nt6U4B_Q31x7oBkGA

Do not misunderstand me the food was good, the service was quite poor. I did not see a manager walking around, critiquing the troops on their performance and yet obviously it was needed.

The restaurant did NOT appear full, several tables were unoccupied. This adds to my confusion of tonight's performance. Perhaps we caught a bad night for our server and her customer skillset?

I will say the meal started strong with the meatball appetizer. You get large meatballs in sauce and both were very good. So it set the standard high.

One of my favorite items at Italian restaurants is the pasta vodka. While it was good, it wasn't great by any means. Just okay. I did appreciate the al dente noodles though. 

But the most surprising thing was the desserts. I get it, you want to include some family favorites like cannoli's, but still. No cake? What about featuring mini cakes that are decorated? Just something to play off the show. I just expected more than just three plain jane choices of sweets.

We came during Happy Hour, 4:30-6:30 pm 7 days a week. We were here Memorial Day weekend, and it wasn't too full on a Sunday afternoon. The seating in the bar was really comfy with stuffed chairs and couches, high top bar tables with padded seats and bar seating with padded seats with backs. 

We tried one of everything on the Small Bites for $5 Happy Hour menu!!!  We also had the Butterscotch Creme Brûlée for dessert for $9. So creamy and great butterscotch flavor! It's a good sized bowl, but only about 1/2 inch thick, so not as many calories!

Ricotta cheese was smooth and creamy. It came with grilled buttered bread, and was a great accompaniment to the Olives and Pickled Vegetables, which was served with the same bread. There was enough cheese to also put some on the amazing and Must have Grandma's Meatballs. 3 large beef, veal and pork meatballs with about 1/2 of tomato sauce, sprinkled with a good amount of parmesan cheese. Our other favorites: the Calamari had some big tender pieces that I loved, there were crispy big pieces that that the little tentacles that our friend loved and some fried banana peppers that the spicy food lover liked. My wife's favorite was definitely the Mac and Cheese Carbonara, with smoked mozzarella, fontina, egg, pancetta and peas with a creamy sauce and golden bread crumbs. We got Roma style Gnocchi, which are little fried cubes of polenta with a little metal tub of marinara mixed with pesto dipping sauce-delicious. Crunchy on outside  and smooth inside, great sauce. The smashed meatball sliders was a fun little 2 bite sandwich with peppers on top. Same for Sausage and pepper sliders, which are a bit spicy. 

Loved the little to go novelty light up cup for the soda with unlimited refills for $7. 

Krystal waited on us, and was very happy and attentive. Manager Kristina Poole visited the table and sat and visited us for a nice chat. We got an update on the restaurant, it's sister restaurant in Bethlehem, PA and Buddy's moms health when we asked. The Assistant General Manager, Sean Fiori, came and whisked her away after a quick picture and check to make sure we were happy. 

Very nice evening, could be quick, but this time we stayed and enjoyed ourselves and they were not pushing us out after we paid the bill.

We spent a good hour narrowing down Italian food restaurants based on reviews and the menu, and we were very disappointed with our experience at Buddy V's. When you walk in the atmosphere is very welcoming, dimly lit, guy playing the piano, and nice decor. That's where the nice experience ends. Once we sat down, our waiter tried to hard sell us on this wine that was clearly the wine the restaurant wanted the waiters to sell that night. We had to tell him ""not interested"" at least 3 times. I don't expect to get hassled and given the ""hard sell"" by our server at a really nice restaurant. The food we received tasted like it had been frozen and reheated. Definitely did not taste fresh. We started out with the Meatball appetizer. The meatballs had no ""crispiness"" to the outside. The sauce was thin and had no flavor.  My boyfriend got the Lasagna (which was supposed to be their signature dish), and I got the Pasta alla Vodka (normally very yummy if done right). The sauce with the Lasagna was runny and had no flavor. He even commented that the Lasagna I made at home tasted better than what he got at Buddy V's. As for my Pasta alla Vodka, the sauce was runny and had no flavor, the chicken was tough, and the pasta wasn't cooked enough. I went to an Italian food restaurant in Shenzhen China that had better Pasta alla Vodka. To top it off, the menu prices were $25+, which is kind of what you expect from Vegas, but I expect top quality food at that price, and especially from a celebrity chef.

We started off with the Buddy's Salumi n cheese board($19) as an appetizer...nothing special for the price. Then waiter asked if we wanted garlic bread (FYI not free it was $9 for 3 pieces) bread wasn't even warm, great Italian bread is a precursor to a great meal, not even close.  Menu was limited which isn't bad bc that usually means that the stuff on the menu is usually great...Uhm not the case. The linguine n clams ($25) portion small & there was spaghetti noodles instead of linguine??? Caprese salad($14) there was a whole tomato on the plate which was like boiled n peeled, unimpressed. The angus burger had no flavor n the French fries were overdone n cold, really??? 
Ok so after being disappointed by the food I was really looking forward to dessert... The XL lobster tail ($15) was so disappointing bc the pastry shell was hard as a rock n hard to eat. As you bite into it all the cream would shoot out bc the shell was so hard. The cannoli shell was hard as well, like a hard cookie ($9). If you had real cannolis you know that they are not supposed to taste like that. To top it off the coffee yes the coffee tasted horrible, like it's been sitting in the pot all day. For 3 people and sunset menu which is cheaper than dinner total $153 and that's with no alcohol..for that total there was not one thing I could say anything nice about. I had leftovers that weren't even worth taking home. 
Yes, I should of known better to go to a gimmicky restaurant. But I liked the show and I'm from NYC and was hoping for some good Italiano food n dessert. No love in the food at all. Don't waste your money n time going all the way to the crazy strip for this place.

Grandma's Meatballs covered in Red Sauce (Sunday Gravy) were authentic classic Italian meatballs, and Aunt Nina's Mozzarella en Carozza was a hot and cheesy confection once again.  Calamari Fritti was another nice starter.  And the complimentary Focaccia Bread was great.

And Nonna's Lasagna Al Forno was again one of the best lasagnas I have ever tasted--besides Diane's vaunted cheesy and saucy concoction which won the 2014 Ardiente Lasagna Baking Championship in a blind tasting by judges.

Alas, Diane failed to persuade the chef to make her Veal Parm Alfredo, and had to settle for a good Veal Marsala instead, which unfortunately arrived late to the table.

That said,  and it needed to be, I rarely eat southern Italian in restaurants because growing up in NY, I had the good fortune to eat the real master chefs cuisine,  my grandmother,  father,  aunts and friends parents. Anyway my point is,  I'm seriously biased. 

My goal was to eat something tasty and not heavily laden with sugar,  flour, carbs as I'm in the middle of a book about that stuff which is gross, scary and fascinating all at the same time.  But,  I digress. 

I went for lunch and ordered grandma's meatballs and a side of Tuscan Kale with roasted tomatoes.  While I get that we didn't use real San Marzano tomatoes here,  it did come close to replicating an authentic flavor.  I should point out that meatballs to Italians is a very serious and personal matter. My extended family can argue endlessly on the what constitutes the perfect meatball, whether there should be inclusions such as pignola nuts, raisens and tons of other stuff you can't possibly imagine. 

The Tuscan Kale wasn't on the menu,  but Star, my server,  not wanting to disappoint,  checked with the kitchen and they said they could do it.  I was very happy.  That's service! Problem was,  it came out very tough, chewy and barely edible.  So I appreciate the extra effort,  not the result, and the results are what matters.

5845462,2016-01-07,0,nUpz0YiBsOK7ff9k3vUJ3A,"Buddy V's Ristorante is a lovely place to go for home-style cooked Italian food.  The menu offers a variety of appetizers, salads, pasta, chicken, veal and seafood.  Last but not least, the cakes are insanely delicious- not surprising, seeing the restaurant is owned by the Cake Boss himself.  Do whatever you have to do to save room for dessert!

Our server brought us a tray of freshly baked focacia before the meal.  It was so fluffy and warm.  i could have eaten a whole tray myself!  My sister and her boyfriend shared some of their fried calamari appetizer.  It was great!

The cocktails were wonderful.  I tried my sister's martini called the Cake Boss- red velvet cake, chocolate liqueur and Bailey's.

The restaurant sadly did not offer any Alfredo entrees, which are typically my favorite, but my Chicken Piccata (breaded chicken cutlet in a white wine & butter sauce) was excellent!  The side of pasta was also very good.

I tried my mom's Eggplant Parmesan and was very impressed!  The food truly tasted like we were eating a homemade dinner at a family member's dining room table.

Even though we loved our meals, the best course of the meal was dessert.  I had trouble deciding what to order.  The Cannoli, Butterscotch Creme Brulee and Nutella Cake all sounded so good.  Our server recommended that I try the Italian Birthday Cake- Rum soaked sponge cake with cannoli filling, chocolate pastry cream and toasted almonds.  It was heavenly!

The restaurant's ambience is perfect for a nice family dinner.  It is beautifully decorated with a combination of vibrantly colorful kitchen items and upscale decor.  The restaurant has an energetic and happy atmosphere,  They commonly have upbeat live music playing, but at a reasonable level so you can hear the people at your table talking to you.

The service is also amazing.  The employees make you feel like old friends of theirs- definitely the ideal Italian kitchen.",PtV45pQ1JpGVp6EeGyqS3g,0,1,4,7wkO6_AEwdXy1hrMn_5k1g

After standing in line at the bakery we found ourselves starving and impatient so we decided to just go into this sister restaurant right across the hall. Went in with no expectations and having read nothing about the place and was totally blown away! 

I had the chicken ceasar salad cause after spending 3 days in vegas all I wanted were vegetables and water. The romaine was crisp, the dressing was yummy, and the crutons were the star of the dish... parmesan polenta crutons!? That's a thing? You're damn right that's a thing and it's amazing! Would give it a full 5 but they were a bit skimpy on the chicken. 4.5/5

The man ordered the Philly Cheese Sandwich which was also delicious. Crisp and soft bread, ooy-gooy cheese, juicey thin slices of perfectly seasoned meat. It's not a traditional Philly in any sense but it's truely one of the best I've ever had. 5/5

Might I add they offer the dessert we were standing in line for at the bakery. Kind of wish we had just dined here and ordered a pastry for dessert!

The first time was for a late Sunday brunch, but we just got there too late for the buffet brunch, which looked really good. Gonna definitely have to come back for that some time.

Me and my date tried the salumi plate, which was pretty good, especially since it came with crispy grilled baguette slices. Schmeared some of the blue cheese on a slice and then layered the salumi and prosciutto for a nice little open face mini-sammy. Yum! I ordered the chicken parm, which came with a side of spaghetti marinara and my date ordered the caesar salad and we split them both between us, which was more than enough food since the caesar was pretty good size and the chicken parm came with two equal sized filets covered with cheese and sauce. The caesar came with polenta croutons, which were amazing and would have been a great appetizer on their own with a side of red sauce! Crispy on the outside and warm and fuzzy in the middle. Almost took away from how good the caesar was. My date thought there was too much dressing, but I like it that way. The chicken parm was awesome! Probably the best I've ever had anywhere. Good thick tender piece of chicken, nice breading, and great cheese to chicken ration with a nice marinara on top. But the coup de grâce was the unassuming side of pasta on the dish. I don't know what it was, but it was just spaghetti marinara but the size and texture of the pasta was just amazing. It was like the unknown actor stealing the spotlight from all the big name actors in a movie! 

I went back for lunch later in the week and got the Express lunch for $22 which included a 3 course selection. I got the caesar, spaghetti bolognese, and lemon sorbet. All were awesome, expecially for the price. But the spaghetti again was amazing. And the bolognese sauce was nice and thick and held to the pasta like glue. Easily the best spaghetti dish I've ever had. Again, I don't know what it was about the pasta (size? texture? taste? perfectly al dente?) but it was like crack in pasta form. I can't wait to go back! And this is from a guy who try's not to eat pasta much because it's a carb bomb. And I don't think I've ever had a more perfectly balanced sorbet. Not too sweet, not too tart (lemon sorbet). And 2 big scoops! What a great way to finish the meal and cleanse the pallet!

My husband and I both had salads.  I had the panzanella, which is mozzarella and grilled bread on a bed of greens.  The bread was wet and mushy.  The greens had way too much dressing.  The good news: the tomatoes and cucumbers in the salad were delicious.  

My husband got the Sicilian charred octopus. He said the octopus was nice.  The problem is, with so many outstanding restaurants close by, ""nice"" just doesn't make the grade.

I know there is over 300 different types of pasta, but the waitress should at least learn the names of the ones where they work.  She didn't know the difference in the dishes, when I had a question.  I asked for the dessert menu up front, so I could decide if i wanted salad verse dessert, she never brought it.  (finally got it from the bus staff).

Our Server Gal did a great job, and we enjoyed the free entertainment of the Brothers so much that we tipped them well.",fM_UsuFAYu2TVUqJiYAKsg,4,1,4,qYGZHxqiDT23OSyJU_VWKQ

All I have to say is that I was disturbed by my meatballs. I was flat out disappointed by my meatballs. Those were not good meatballs. 

I had spaghetti and meatballs. My first cause for concern was that our dishes came out insanely fast. Never a good sign in my book. I'm not at Burger King, I do no expect my food to arrive in less than five minutes. The meatballs were small and when I split one with my fork, it did not crumble like a freshly made meatball should. It was hard. And I bet you anything it had been frozen at one point. Sauce was incredibly bland. I was incredibly disappointed. 

Main cause for disappointment? This was not my first time here. I've had their meatballs before. They were heavenly, delicious, tasty and FRESH! 

Saving grace was their Italian Cake. That was pretty good. But as for the meal, all I can say is how corporate of them.",GQFtveqbz9M6s3z7TAXKag,1,1,2,nZsJuOD0VrAtPxOS6nJ8ww

I ordered the Italian hero with Caesar salad and my friend ordered the meatball appetizer. The sandwich was really good. Perfectly cooked bread, crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. The meat was flavorful and had a nice kick. The tomato tapenade added a nice spiciness as well. I tried some of my friend's meatballs and they were great. Moist and well-seasoned. Some of the better meatballs I've tried in town.  

We couldn't stop by without trying some dessert, so we gave in and ordered a tiramisu as well as a Nutella cake with salted caramel gelato. The tiramisu was enormous, large enough for four people to share. The Nutella cake was not overly chocolatey and wonderfully paired with the caramel gelato. I'm not typically a fan of Nutella or cake but this was the perfect combination. 

They are opening a Carlo's Bakery across from Buddy V's, which will be a great addition to accompany this restaurant.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,10,6,4,3T4UM4QUxckYk7paQgNICQ

Chicken parmigiana was just ok, needed more seasoning, came with a side of spaghetti which was delicious, wish the portion was larger though. The lasagna was just ok to me, it has Italian sausage in it and I don't care for that. A bit pricey for what you get, but it is Vegas, so expect to pay. Outstanding service, on top of everything, very friendly, polite and polished. Would definitely return, but would definitely get the large bowl of spaghetti instead.",oVYJtZbKEV_SEuqP-y9pzg,0,0,4,XX5hdbwG6AcL1GMGo-edHQ

I'm a huge fan who occasionally watches episodes of Cake Boss and dreams about going to Hoboken to taste his food.  So when I heard about Buddy V's Ristorante during this recent birthday trip, my heart skipped a beat and I told my husband we HAD TO go!

From the outside, the charming decor mimicked that of a quaint cafe nestled in the corner of somewhere in Italy (or so I'd think, since I've never been).  It drew me in!  I love how it felt homey yet upscale inside.  We had a reservation and were seated promptly.  Our food took a while to arrive but the taste more than made up for it!  I ordered Nonna's Lasagna.  Oh my!  It was as if I've never had lasagna before!  There were so many layers with meat and cheese that just melt on your tongue.  That good!  I wished my stomach were bigger just so I could have more of that lasagne.  It was a very generously portioned dish.  My husband ordered Mama's Style Chicken.  He loved his dish too!  

Oh and don't get me started on the dessert!  Lisa's Warm Nutella Cake was perfect for my birthday treat - chocolate cake drizzled in chocolate sauce with caramel ice cream.  Scrumptious, to say the least!  They decorated with ""happy birthday"" and our server sang to me in Italian.  It was the perfect ending to a perfect meal.

The customer service was amazing.  Our server was funny and accommodating.  We had our baby with us and enjoyed a memorable dinner out.  What more could you ask for in Vegas?!  Definitely one for the books!",v1um_EicLz4lZIx-HVnpow,3,1,5,vujJMSGU2OPgyIbN3_-kAQ

Food was outstanding, we had chicken parm, spaghetti and the lasagna at our table and we all tried bite of each meal and all were very delicious and tasteful. Service was a little slow to getting our order and then getting the check but he was a great server none the less, very entertaining. I love the family atmosphere they had as well as the touches of family in the menus. We also had a bottle of the moscato which was amazing with our meals.

Our server was very nice. She was attentive, nice, and pleasant to speak too. Ordered a few drinks, chowed down on our Canoli and chocolate mousse cheesecake, eventually we ordered some food (mac and cheese, calamari, they are standard off any Italian menu, however they were delicious!). The ambiance of the bar was very nice, it was packed and had a live singer (with a VERY nice voice, Thanks to the Fabulous Baker Boys!) it was so romantic, and straight out of a movie- I was so in love (we were on an anniversary trip:).

Overall I thoroughly enjoyed it all, and look forward to visiting Buddy V's when we in town again! :)",yBFD-Fi1r4UNseuc-6RrkA,0,0,5,glmnZKr5RoNb3zbqa9oJVg

My wife and I ate there last night (not our first time) and from the time we were seated to the time we left everything we great. Generally I'm not one to sit too long.

The service was exceptional. She recommended three different meals: Chicken Parm, Lasagna, and Chicken Rigatoni. We had the Chicken Parm, the Chicken Rigatoni, and I went for the Chicken Marsala, as it is one of my favorites. Each meal was delicious! There was not a speck left on our plates! 
I will definitely return AND recommend it to all,",FdUlNbncr_rZU4gkhHWIUg,0,1,5,T2BFgUOrgVC6yfmutk9jtQ

Parking:

Located at the Grand Canal Shoppe closer to the Palazzo side so it is nice stroll from the Venetian Parking structure. Where parking can sometimes be a pain but usually plentiful.

Establishment:

Service was okay it was a tad bit slow but not annoyingly so. *3 stars*

Food (Brunch):

To begin there is an all you can drink for about $15 which is probably worth it if you plan on having more than 1 drink. Bringing your total to about $50 a person. 

The concept of quality over quantity definitely applies here there is probably about 10 dishes of breakfast items and some Italian dishes some of their Italian dishes were just okay though but nothing I regretted trying.

What shines here though is their dessert. They have a glorious display of desserts that will be sure to satisfy your sweet tooth. *4 stars*

Overall:

First brunch in Vegas so nothing to compare to but for the price I thought it was very enjoyable especially after 3 sangrias.",nWS4xS4lAfi9xeW8uABx8g,0,0,4,KAfuJ2smV2hnon9-Yqu4LA
