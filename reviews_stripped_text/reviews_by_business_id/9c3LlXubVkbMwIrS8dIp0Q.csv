In my opinion, the food was average; I ordered a cheese burger medium done. The meat was flavorless and the bun was stale. Very disappointing, I expected a delicious burger from a place the specializes in burgers!! 
The price was a little high too for such a basic burger.

Perhaps it has potential to be good, but when I received my food and cut into my burger, it was oozing blood....GROSS! I was so hungry, I ate about 3/4 of the first half, but couldn't do anymore, it was just so rare. When the gentleman came by to ask if I wanted a refill, I asked if the burgers a normally served rare/med rare like this?? He said that is medium and that us how we cook our burgers here. Clearly it is not medium, but whatever, customers should be made aware that the burgers are cooked to medium, not everyone likes a medium burger...me for one prefers my burgers well done, so you can imagine that I was not very happy with my $15 combo meal. I am not going to eat the other half, and I doubt I will be back. And it only gets one star because the fries and pink sauce are actually good.",OkBzedpTrIOjSLv9yQhiJw,0,0,1,Y4OXcEOCx-SIMwBvx04LFw

Keep in mind, it's about 12 minutes or longer. The cook places the order on the bar for the waitress to bring to us. Instead the waitress takes our order to the family that came after us. Now I am irritated! So, I asked the cook why did those people get there food before us when they came in after us? The cook states and I quote, ""your food is ready!"" I replied , Well..we didn't get so do I need to get my money back? A this point, I'm mad so I demanded my money back from the cashier. Here's the topper! The cashier tells me that the people that walked in 7 minutes after myself and my husband walked in that they had the same order as us. Now, this family walked in with 2 toddlers and a baby. So, I say to myself, what are you kidding me? I'm absolutely insulted because not only did order runner have a lame excuse but the manager didn't seem to care. I'd like to think that it was an honest mistake but I know that it wasn't. To seal the deal in this terrible establishment, they couldn't figure out how to give me a refund so I had to provide them with my receipt.

I mentioned this to the runner who then brought me out a plastic container of feta cheese, thanks :/. My dad ordered a sprite and had to wait due to the carbonation needing to be changed, which is fine but no one let him know what was going on. When the counter girl brought part of our order, he asked if she was bringing his sprite to which she bluntly said ""No."" and acted as if he offended her by asking that.

Within 15 minutes, our order arrived (see the pictures).

Ordered the ribs ""sauce on the side"". And the kitchen thought that meant extra sauce on the side. They weren't bad ribs. Nice if you like something plain.

However, they refused to serve us, even though there was more than enough time to cook and serve us our orders. Not to mention the fact that the restaurant was relatively busy. It's one thing to close up shop ten minutes early if you aren't busy, but a casual dining restaurant that closes a half hour early? Talk about major disappointment.

He then told me that he'll give me a sample of their beef ribs with the pork ribs. The pork ribs was delicious, my girlfriend order their most basic burger and she said it was good and pretty cheap too. While I was eating I forgot that chef Adrian was supposed to give me sample of their beef ribs. He came out with an order of the beef ribs which I tried and he was right, if you like tender meat most likely you're not gonna like it. He gave me a whole order of the ribs for free for me to try.

1393454,2015-04-01,0,9c3LlXubVkbMwIrS8dIp0Q,"So, I was one of the first 100 people in line for this joint. That means that I won a free burger a week for a year. A pretty good deal for waiting outside overnight. Unfortunately, each time I go to this place, there is one more thing to complain about. 

The first time we went was great! The burger tasted good, although that may have been because of staying up all night with only small snacks to munch on periodically. Regardless! Our order was taken, the staff was friendly, and we received our food promptly and hot. 

The second time, we got our food a little bit slower. I ended up upgrading my free burger to the Salmon burger. I did not care for it. At all. It wasn't cooked badly, it just had a weird combination of ingredients. Capers and teriyaki sauce do NOT go together. Plus, the fish was abnormally fishy. Also, the milkshake we ordered took an unnecessary amount of time to get to our table. My boyfriend had to go up and ask for it and he was the one who ended up bringing it back. 

Tonight was the most recent time we visited Ribs & Burgers. We arrived slightly later than we wanted to and got there at 8:30, which should be fine considering they close at 9. Well, it was a problem. They refused to serve us despite the restaurant being full of individuals eating their meals. Apparently, closing at 9 means they stop serving people at 8:30, which is ridiculous for a restaurant. We traveled all the way to Downtown Summerlin just to eat at Ribs & Burgers and ended up leaving empty handed. Very unprofessional. 

Obviously, we'll be back because of our free burger card, but I probably wouldn't be back here except on occasion for the milkshakes. Can't pass up a milkshake.

UPDATE: Been back a few more times and service is getting progressively better. A friend of mine works here and said they had some communication problems at the beginning but they're getting better each day. I think he's right because my food has been getting to me a lot faster and a waitress I had the other day was very prompt. Moving my stars up from 2 to 3. Let's hope they had a bad case of New Restaurant Blues and they keep improving from here on out.",VFtQI1mODorJr_mHIglsCA,3,1,3,YTozCtxbuHoN80OO6jSbdw

Stopped by this place while walking around Downtown Summerlin. 
The interior was cool, clean, and very open. Love how they have a sink in the middle of the restaurant near the ketchup section (did not use, but I appreciate unique details). 

Downtown Summerlin offers free-wifi so I was able to handle business quickly on my macbook while waiting for the food.

Staff and service was very inviting and accommodating. (I had an adventurous two year old with me so they are kid-friendly).

Ordered the Pocket burger, drink, and fries. They give you a little bucket with your table number on the outside that holds napkins, fry sauce, ketcup, etc. It was a beautiful day so we decided to eat on the patio. Food came fairly quick (thankfully as I was anxious to eat). 


For it to be called a pocket burger, it was pretty big. Fries were amazing and crisp. Really enjoyed the fry sauce paired with the burger and of course, the fries. More than likely will come back to try the other items on the menu.",KqjcQSIS-FyaOAGgZhuZuQ,0,0,4,nYGhQ0g26otTsqOgV5XJ8A

After numerous unfavorable reviews, I had to find out what the fuss was all about. I came in for lunch, looked over the menu that hung just inside the door, and paid for my meal before having a seat. There are no servers per say at Ribs & Burgers. The hostess is a cashier and the one who makes the delicious shakes. The chefs make the food and deliver it to your table. You are given a tin of silverware/napkins and a table number for the chef to locate the correct table with the right meal.

I ordered a chicken sandwich. He ordered a Greek salad with chicken. My chicken sandwich had a zesty lemon flavor. It was very good! The Greek salad looked amazing, so I had a couple bites of that too. The salad had an excellent flavor - the vegetables were fresh and lettuce was crisp. Chef Cliff brought out some French fries for us to sample with our meal. This was a hit! The fries were crispy, hot, lightly salted, and delicious. 

We enjoyed the atmosphere while we ate. Then, following our meal we had our alcoholic s'more milkshake. Wow, that milkshake is a phenomenal experience of flavors! It was so good that I even took one to go.  I am sure it was like a billion calories too!

1503037,2015-03-24,1,9c3LlXubVkbMwIrS8dIp0Q,"I don't know why I am writing this review - based on my experience and other reviews; this place will be out of business in 4 months.

First you walk in, the menu is on a big chalkboard opposite of the register. There is no menu behind the cashier. So when you are trying to order, you are talking away from the cashier and trying to look over other customers' shoulders. BIG MISTAKE. Please print some paper menus for customers to look at while in line. PUT A COPY OF THE MENU BOARD BEHIND THE CASHIER SO YOUR CUSTOMERS CAN TALK TO YOUR CASHIER. It seems that your cashiers are having a hard enough time as it is.

As I am ordering, someone in a half-tucked in blue button-up shirt (manager?) is hovering over her to make sure she types in everything correctly. Very uncomfortable. 

I order a whole rack of ribs w/ fries, extra side salad, a burger, and two waters. I am handed two room-temperature COSTCO/KIRKLAND brand waters and a bucket with number on the side of it. Just under $40.00.

** Do not insult your customers by serving generic $2.50 a case water and charging $2.00 per bottle for it. At least get a brand name in there or label your own. **

** I was not asked how I wanted the burger cooked, very odd for a $15.00 burger **

** I did not get an itemized receipt **

I sit down in a half-booth / half chair seat located directly behind the kitchen at 6:50pm.

We wait.

We notice what we think is our food come up in the kitchen and watch it get delivered to another table.

They complain to the manager that they didn't order a salad (we ordered the salad). The manager (in all black) brings them more fries.

We give them the benefit of the doubt and wait.

And wait.

It is now 7:25. 35 minutes after we paid and sat down.

We notice a couple that was standing behind us has already finished their meal.

I go up to the cashier and ask what is going on ??

The manager (all black) ignores me and the head cook comes to talk to me. I explain the problem.

He talks to a waitress 4 feet away from me. She tells the cook that she mis-deleivered the food to the party of 6 behind us. She digs out our ticket that she had already punched. She explains that she forgot to replace our order.

The cook then comes back to me and LIES STRAIGHT TO MY FACE. He tells me that they couldn't find our bucket and assumed that we left. He accused us of leaving !!! He said our food was given to someone else because we had left.

WE NEVER LEFT !??! WE WERE SITTING RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE KITCHEN THE ENTIRE TIME ! 

HOW MANY PEOPLE JUST LEAVE AFTER PAYING $40.00 FOR FOOD ? ARE YOU SERIOUS ? I JUST HEARD YOUR WAITRESS TELL THE COOK THAT SHE MIS-DELIEVERED IT TO THE PARTY OF 6 !!!

It is now 40 minutes since we ordered. I ask for a refund. I show him my receipt and he tells me that ""this doesn't help, it doesn't show me what you ordered"". I tell him, that is all you gave me, you didn't give me an itemized receipt"". 

The cook can't figure out how to do the refund to a credit card. He panics and starts yelling at the kitchen to not put my order on. They STILL had not even started my replacement order after 40 minutes ! 

The cook asks the manager how to do the refund and the manager barks at him ""just give him cash and get him out of here - do what you need to do"". They didn't have enough cash in both registers for our refund so we ended up with over $2.00 in nickels and dimes. 

The entire time I was watching the kitchen I noticed multiple orders come back as incorrect and the kitchen staff yelling at the servers. Very unprofessional when you have customers listening 5 feet away.

I urge the management and owner to have lunch at a food truck or any fast food restaurant today (McDs, Del Taco, Taco Bell) so that they can understand how to take an order and how to serve an accurate order on time. If things don't change, I don't expect this place to be in the directory the next time the Downtown Summerlin re-prints it.

I'll start with the burger! Great burger. Really well cooked, well seasoned, toppings were good and flavor was pretty solid. Overall, I'd give the burger a 5 star if that were all I'd eaten here. Don't be afraid of the beetroot on the Aussie burger. Take a chance. It's actually amazing. I ordered mine ""naked"" (no bun) and it came out wrapped in a huge amount of lettuce. It was quite difficult to eat -- as most all lettuce-wrapped burgers are! -- but was worth it. I'd have this burger again in a heartbeat.

The downside to my visit was definitely the sweet potato tots. I am a big sweet potato fan, and I'm 99% sure that these tots have sugar in them. They were *extremely* sweet, and just terrible. They were *far* too sweet to eat on their own, and they clashed with the flavors of all the sauces available. My wife agreed. We threw them all away after trying and failing to find a good way to eat them. 

Too bad about the tots. I was really excited to try them as a healthy alternative to regular fries.

When we saw that this place had finally opened, we were really excited to try it out. We had to walk in to see the menu - it was writen on a giant chalkboard. At first glance, I thought it was kind of overpriced. Also, I can only imagine people gawking at the menu inside causing a huge line of some sort. I predict being annoyed at waiting and just walking to some other place to eat. Upon ordering, they don't have normal soda and you have to pay for water. This is seriously a place you eat after shopping a little, not a fancy restaurant so I was shocked that you had to pay for water. Once done ordering, you get a bucket full of utensils and you can sit wherever you want. 

We got the full rack of ribs (they don't have a half slab option), angus burger, and steak sandwich. For the price of the burger and steak sandwich, you get no sides. I felt like you should get some type of side, but you have to order it separately. The full slab of ribs came with like...15 french fries though lol. Oh, you also get cole slaw with the ribs, but they forgot. We had to go up there and remind them twice. Overall, the food was alright. It wasnt' hot just room temperature? I guess.

However, my burger was completely raw. Probably seared for 2 seconds on each side then plopped onto my burger. The texture was mushy, UNCOOKED raw meat. This location is moving so I just won't ever be back anyways. And I don't plan on finding their new location.

***UPDATE: the manager handled the situation very nicely. I just felt so disgusted after investigating the burger that I needed to say something so that nobody else would get the same quality, they just need to pay a little closer attention.

1893061,2015-03-21,4,9c3LlXubVkbMwIrS8dIp0Q,"Aussie burgers, Aussie ribs, Aussie beer, oi! oi! oi!  The lamb ribs are frickin' delicious and my juicy burger was, too. Some kinks to work out as a new business, but I'll be back to try more menu items soon, no doubt about it.

FOOD: Menu is burgers and ribs. Duh. The aforementioned lamb ribs are what they recommend most, and with damn good reason. They're flavorful, they're juicy, they taste great. The Old Skool burger (American, mustard, pickles, onion, BBQ, and aioli) is classic, juicy perfection. Meats are really good quality, cooked just right. 

BEVERAGES: Wine, beer, ""craft bottled sodas"" and Fiji water available only. We were told tap water wasn't available yet the table next to us was offered some after they finished their beers. Other tables had a (probably lower-priced) generic water bottle yet we weren't offered other options than the small, room-temperature Fiji. Not really a fan of the inconsistency, just let me have iced water. Snag a can of Fosters to keep the Aussie spirit flowing.

SERVICE: Mostly friendly staff, management welcoming folks at the door, that's what I like to see! Line at door was backed up, moved slowly. Guy at register was easily distracted and took several minutes to take our simple order. Food took 40+ minutes to come out, I won't count this against them unless it's still that backed up when I return in a month. Expediting and streamlining the kitchen takes time with a new business, I get that.

PRICING: For the few other reviews whining about pricing, ribs are not budget food in the first place. The $18 rack of lamb was priced just right, IMO. Burger was under $10 but some went up to about $14. Still not outlandish, our dinner was right over $30. Considering the other options in this area AND the quality, they're not overpriced.

I didn't get to try a bite because he ate it so quick. I had the lemon aioli chicken burger. It was really yummy. I Love That the fries come piping hot. One thing I still dislike is that I had to go up to get a refill. If it was a self service place that's fine, but I had to awkwardly wait for a server to see me to get a refill and the waiters weren't attentive enough to do it for you. My hubby was offered one when his drink got low, but I'm a nursing mom, I got to drink a lot. The chef was there yesterday, he had great energy and made the guests feel real welcome. I thought that was nice. I do think they should consider adding a bigger menu board on the right wall right when you walk in so that more people can look at it.

I agree with a previous reviewer who mentioned the woman working at the register.  I did not get her name but I have to assume (or hope-could multiple employees be like this?) that this was the same woman.  She acted completely disinterested to the point of being rude.  My husband greeted her kindly/like a normal human being and she just barely acknowledged him.  Throughout our order, she behaved as if we were inconveniencing her by ordering food.  I am confused why she chooses to work there, as she seems to really hate it.  
To the owners, this is not the kind of employee you want to be the first person your customers come in contact with.  Actually, probably shouldn't want someone acting like this to ever interact with your customers if you want them to come back.  We just chalked it up to her being an unhappy person, and unconcerned about the quality of her work.
As stated above, the food was mostly average in quality and flavor.  The burger was disappointingly bland, but I do like that you are able to get both ribs and burgers on the same plate.  No need to decide which one to get!  Still, both the sliders and the ribs were lacking in flavor.  Overall, the whole meal was slightly sweet.  Would have been great to have something spicy or acidic to balance it all out.  Maybe I should have gotten the slaw instead of the fries!
Sadly though, I will not be going back to see if that makes any difference.  The food didn't leave much of an impression and the staff left a bad one.",XsMF004zCO2mYGlGc60V1A,2,0,2,QSZvyX8H49QV5rvQ9NMeGA

2118911,2015-06-20,0,9c3LlXubVkbMwIrS8dIp0Q,"Having heard good verbal reviews my friend and I decided to try Ribs & Burgers while at Downtown Summerlin.  While not a fan of counter ordering the small, casual rib joint was not busy on a Friday evening. That definitely changed by the time we left. Customers were lined up to order and all tables were full.
After reviewing the chalkboard menu by the door we ordered the pork baby back slab to share. It was 110 outside so we wanted to eat light.  A few hearty souls even sat on the patio.
When we were served we very surprised at the meaty portion of ribs and the piping hot fries.  The sauces were pleasant that came in a teakettle with napkins and utensils. The delicious smoky flavor of the ribs with the moist and tender meat was a big surprise. Such a small restaurant just served us the best ribs in town! The single $24 portion left us full and happy.
Try it. You will like it. The steak burger and wagyu burger served next to us looked large and were tasty according to those diners. While everyone's tastes are different I was left questioning the other reviews I read here. Simple, good food, pleasant service for $30.

We got some nice advice from a man standing by the front door who greets people and answers questions.

2206264,2015-03-18,6,9c3LlXubVkbMwIrS8dIp0Q,"The Skinny: so-so food served lukewarm if not room temperature (2.5) service: poor organization and set up makes for substandard service(2) value: high prices for below average quality makes this a pass...plus they do not even offer tap water and only offer expensive small bottles of Fiji water(2).

Let me preface this review with the fact that my husband ordered the food and I joined him later once the food had arrived. 

He was really enthused about this place opening so close to home. Hungering for burgers he came earlier when they opened but was dissuaded from eating there for lunch due to all the people lined up for Opening day offer of free burgers for a year for the first 100 people. 

So he decided we would do dinner with a friend of ours.

Initially when he entered the restaurant,  it was unclear how to order as there is no hostess to greet you.  The way the restaurant is set up,  it appears as if it ought be sit down service. But after a while they figured that it was counter service. 

So they go up to the counter to order and pay.They were a little weirded out by the large basket of non-packaged straws was sitting there at the counter. Not to mention condiments are located right next the wash sink in the middle of the restaurant (see photos). We liked the concept of the sink but do not like the fact that the condiments are in a splash zone. 

In addition to all the weird set up,  they also will not serve you tap water. Your only options are overpriced small bottles of Fiji,  sodas or other beverages. 

Anyway,  we ordered the lamb burger ($14),  kale salad ($8), and a rack of ribs ($24, comes with fries and coleslaw). 

The lamb burger was definitely only so-so in my book. The patty was rather thin compared to the bun.  The tzaziki/hummus flavor really overwhelmed the taste of the underseasoned,  dry, lamb patty. FYI - For a burger joint that charges the prices they do,  they do not ask how you liked your burger cooked (ie, medium well, well done,  etc.). 

Rack of ribs were decidedly meh. There wasn't enough smoky flavor and the meat was not tender enough. It was a bit pretty sad state for the ribs. The coleslaw was too salty for me and slathered with too much mayo. Normally,  I love coleslaw but even I could tolerate only one bite of it. Fries were okay and not really anything special. 

Kale salad was rather uninspiring.  The creamy dressing seemed rather bland and definitely needed some acidity to brighten the flavor. The blanched almonds, green beans,  apple and cranberries appeared as an after thought rather than as an integral part of the salad.

In terms of the service,  the burger and ribs were lukewarm and not hot enough. My hubs and friend had to ask twice for our fries which were missing for a while. The manager finally noticed and comped us an extra serving of fries which was nice of him. 

Granted that we did go opening day,  Ribs and Burgers has a lot of issues to iron out in terms of execution, service and organization. In terms of value and quality, $50 for what we got seemed very overpriced. (2 starred review).",h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q,5,3,2,YM1y0B0r6NJ7M0-Xn1EP0A

We ordered the lamb burger, the salmon burger, two drinks and a plate of fries.  First of all, I though everything tasted very good.  Fries were great, salmon burger was great, but the lamb burger was overdone for my taste.  The cons; get a damn soda fountain.  I understand when the only option is a bottled soda if I'm on the strip or if I'm at some high priced restaurant.  Not for a burger joint.  I think that's just ridiculous especially for 3.50 each.  Come on, now.  Also, our fries were brought out about fifteen minutes before our actual food but they noticed this and brought us extra.  I had no issues with the service but would recommend putting up an additional menu or having some to hand out so the line doesn't get backed up when people are waiting to order.

I'm not sure if I'd go back.  The soda thing is a real point of contention for me.  Good burgers but not something that I couldn't find elsewhere or make myself.",NUd3sqehiGnM5Meh5ChbYw,1,0,3,gD2FiGoO5Eg8ZAcniMRRmQ

Think I saw a plate that featured sliders and half rack or ribs.

 I ordered the Wagyu(or they say!). I get it well done when I ordered it medium. It was so dry I had to bury it in their bbq sauce, which the sauce was good I might add. So back to the meat, I wouldn't be able to tell the difference if it was regular beef, Wagyu, or anything else! I was surprised to see other reviews saying how good this place was.

#1. Duplicate the menu board for outside the door. If you have never been here before your going to clog the line trying to decide.
#2. Teach staff to listen to orders and repeat as they enter to POS .
#3. Teach cooks to read and expiditers to check orders before they go out. I lacked 2.00 Avacado and 1.50 bacon on my 14.00 Waygu beef burger that was over cooked. And I never got the side mayo.
#4. Unless I'm in a 5 star restaurant I should not have to pay for water. We live in a desert, whatcha gonna do in the summer when folks are standing outside in 100+° weather. If you don't have room for ice machine and glasses. Give bottles of cold water, you charge enough to make it up.
#5. Fridge should be really cold. My expensive Root beer was warm. And the girl who cleared my table of condiment bottles removed it before I was through drinking it.
#6. I know your Ribs are par cooked(steamed) before being put onto a grill. You guys should work on that for the price. However in all fairness they had great flavor. The Waygu beef should have been juicy as that is the style of beef (fat content). It was not .
#7. I went to the bathroom to wash my hands, on the way back I peered into the kitchen you are holding raw ground meat at room temp in a hotel pan on the counter with which to make pattys for burgers. You should have that pan on ice to keep the temp cool.

2716980,2015-07-11,0,9c3LlXubVkbMwIrS8dIp0Q,"Who doesn't like ribs?  Or burgers?  You can get both here!  Located in Downtown Summerlin, Ribs & Burgers is another addition to the growing number of restaurants located in the still new ""downtown"" area on the west side of the Las Vegas valley.

When you walk in, you can review the menu (on the wall) and then place your order at the counter to your right.  Quick and easy once you know what you want, although it seems a little awkward to stand in front of the main entrance while you take in the respectable choices for the first time.  Three of us were there for the first time and felt like we were partially blocking the door while we made our selections.

I ordered the Beef Ribs, my wife ordered the Original Burger with Bacon and Cheese, and we ordered the Beef Rib Bullets for our son.

I like beef ribs better than pork and this drove my choice for my first visit here.  The beef ribs were definitely tasty, but honestly, they were average.  They were good enough though that I want to go back and try the pork and lamb ribs.  That's right, they have lamb ribs!  Unique!  To be sure there's no confusion, I'd happily have the beef ribs again, too.  They were cooked well, tasted great, but they just weren't my favorite.

My wife was very satisfied with her burger.  Juicy and cooked just right.  We were a bit confused with the beef bullets we ordered for our son though.  We asked what they were at the counter when we ordered and the waitress told us they were just the meat tips from the ribs.  This wasn't the case.  They were the full rib (with the bone) cut into slices to make them bite-sized ""bullets"".  They were good, but they weren't what we were told they'd be.

While it was an order at the counter affair, you sit after you order and the staff brings you your meal.  Everyone was courteous and our waiter came back to the table several times while we enjoyed our food.

For fans of ribs and messy hands, take note, there aren't wipes at the table but there's a sink with soap and tools in the middle of the restaurant.  Cool concept, allowing you to actually wash your hands instead of just wiping them with a tiny toilette (without having to go to the bathroom), but you're literally right beside another table of customers when you're washing your hands.  It felt awkward to me, and I wouldn't have liked other people constantly walking up to my table to wash their hands.  Easy to avoid by not sitting there though.  Not a problem, but again, a little awkward if someone is sitting at the table right next to the washing station.

Note there are non-rib and burger menu options, including chicken wings, steak or grilled chicken sandwiches and chicken breasts.  They also have a small selection salads and a vegetarian burger.  Have kids?  Bring them.  There's a kid's menu.

I'll definitely go back to try the other ribs, especially the lamb ribs.  I'll keep you posted what I find!",djb61X-vkg5PF16qM_wI5Q,1,0,3,XeNFc7IXa23ZDG0AP-Vo0g

2797471,2015-06-26,13,9c3LlXubVkbMwIrS8dIp0Q,"Had an early dinner here with my wife at around 5:30 on wednesday the 24th day of June 2015. It was your typical triple digit temp day in Vegas so the nice cool air that greeted us as we came in was a welcome feeling.

You order at the counter, they give you a bucket with utensils and two sauces in it. You sit down at whatever table thats open and then later on you get your food. On your bucket there is a number assigned to you so that they know who's order was theirs.

I ordered the Ribs Combo ($18). It is a combination of baby back ribs and Korean short ribs. Comes with your choice of a side and cole slaw. My wife got the Lamb Burger ($14).

The baby back ribs were just ok. Not fall off the bone like but had enough tenderness to it for me to bite it off the bone with no problems. It wasnt dry but I thought lacked a bit of flavor. I squirted some of the barbeque sauce on it along with the fry sauce that came with the bucket. The barbeque sauce had no flavor either. The fry sauce was really good. For the side you had your choice of salad or fries. I chose fries. They definitely go good with the fry sauce but I think everything goes good with it. The cole slaw tasted like it didnt have enough vinegar. I tasted mainly mayo. The other half of my combo were Korean short ribs. Man, now these were really good. Marinated and cooked just right. Portions were generous. I would go back just for these alone.

As for my wife's Lamb Burger, she did not like it after the first bite. I gave it a couple bites as well just to verify. The bun that it was on was a bit dry. The ground lamb patty had a strong after taste which I think means that the lamb is not meant to be grounded and that they did not cook it properly. As a side note, I have had lamb chops before straight off the grill when I had visited Melbourne, Australia some years ago and let me tell you those chops had no after taste whatsoever! Ever since then, anything lamb related I  compare it to that point in time. I was told that if the lamb was not prepared and cooked properly, then you will have a strong after taste.

The service could use a bit of improvement. When I got my food they bring it out to you on wooden cutting boards. I like the concept but here's what kind of turned me off as the first bad impression. When the lady brought the ribs out to my table, the short ribs that were on it were dangling a bit off the edge of the cutting board, which caused the marinated juices to drip off to the side. I kid you not, our server had a trail from the kitchen to our table. To make matters worse, after she put the cutting board down the the juices continued to drip down onto our table. I had to move the short ribs away from the edge of the cutting board just so the sticky sauce would not drip all over the table and on to my pants. Thats just bad presentation.

Some other things worth mentioning. They dont have any fountain drinks there that they can refill for you. You have to purchase soda by way of 16 oz bottles. I paid 2 bucks for a coke zero. Thank God they didnt charge for just a glass of ice water. In the middle of the restaurant there is a sink that you can wash your hands in. Not a bad idea for those messy two handed eaters.

Overall, I think that they need to work on the service and presentation a little bet better. Food was just slightly above mediocre. I would like to try them again sometime and hope that things improve a bit better.

2878375,2015-04-18,1,9c3LlXubVkbMwIrS8dIp0Q,"I'm always open to give places second chances but not so much for this place. When my friend and I first walked in we were confused trying to find the menu. After searching around, we found that the menu was across the cashier on a chalkboard; very inconvenient when ordering. My friend ordered a ""bacon cheeseburger"" and I ordered the ""old skool burger,"" both of which were huge disappointments. Our burgers were both well done even though they claim that their burgers are ""medium.""
The only thing notable was the onion strings I got, but $18 for a burger and onion strings, it's overpriced. To top it off, we waited around half an hour and the waitress never gave me my water.

Aside from my terrible food, the staff is very lackluster. One worker was just outside the restaurant on a phone call talking to a friend while the rest of the workers seemed clueless when trying to deliver the food. My waitress literally walked around the restaurant twice trying to find my number. Furthermore, the waiters/waitress don't even check on you if you needed anything or if your food was good. Very unprofessional.

I now know why they make you pay before getting your food, otherwise everyone would just leave.

Pros:
The weather was good

Cons:
Confused staff
inexperienced staff
lackluster burgers
overpriced
long ordering time

After having watched a movie we were just walking around and doing some window shopping (and actual shopping), when we decided to grab a quick bite to eat and try this place out.

We each opted for an original burger ($8.50). I decided to enjoy mine with a slice of American cheese ($1 extra) while my friend added Swiss cheese on his. This is just for the burger. Fries or any other sides will cost you extra. Bottomless fountain drinks were available serving Coke products ($2.90 each). Beer was available there as well.

The burgers were fat and juicy and tasted pretty good! These were very sloppy, messy burgers. Not a bad thing, just an observation. Not the best burger I've had in the city, but still alright. 

Service was good, so there was definitely no issue there. The guys who rang us up and refilled our drinks were very cordial and friendly. 

At this price point, I have to say that everything was alright, but I wasn't blown away by anything. You could do a lot worse though.

2935603,2015-04-04,0,9c3LlXubVkbMwIrS8dIp0Q,"Where do I began with this place? My husband and I wanted to try a new place and we were looking for ribs. We noticed this place listed on the Downtown Summerlin website and decided to give it a try. We don't typically go on yelp prior to visits so we can have an open mind. So here's our take on this place...


First off, the ordering process and area is uncomfortable and a bit off point from your typical restaurant. The large menu facing the cashiers is weird and causes traffic. You place your order and they hand you a bucket with your number and some utensils. The concept is the server needs to bring the food to you, wherever you decide to sit is up to you. Issue with this is as we got a table, we overheard servers stating ""I can't find where #8 is sitting"" they walked around a few times till they found them. It's not easy for them to get your food to you because they are on a scavenger hunt. 

Second, when it comes to the basic service they are lacking quite a bit. The bucket provided doesn't provide enough napkins, they don't check on you until your done with your meal and getting a second beverage is a nightmare. You have to flag someone down to get water. And even then they are so overwhelmed in turning tables or searching for table numbers, that they will forget about your request.  

Lastly, the food itself is served on a wooden board. We get the whole different rustic serving dish idea, however, it does not work well at all with a rack of ribs and fries. They plated the fries underneath and if you are trying to cut your ribs fries fall off the board and on to the table. A completely uncomfortable mess when your hands are full of bbq sauce. As far as the taste is concerned the Lamb ribs were perfectly cooked, great slaw. Side note on bbq sauce: it would be nice to have wet napkins available. 

I will leave you with this: if you got plenty of time to wait in line, wanting as little attention as possible and don't mind eating off a board you should check this place out.",orA3HUtw6vatcBkqIF623w,0,0,2,2dLIR385ycLZ1za6FrcLZQ
2959323,2015-08-16,1,9c3LlXubVkbMwIrS8dIp0Q,"Ok, Truth is more like a 3.5 stars.
When we first walked in, it felt a bit chaotic. Which is odd, since there was a guy there trying to instruct everybody on how it all work, to make it easier. But in a way I can't quite explain, he somehow made it more confusing.

But, hey, we are smart guys. We figured it out pretty quickly. Look at the board, order from the cute smiling person behind the register, sit down.

I ordered a 1/2 rack baby back...(yes you should say it 6X really fast!) and a side of sweet potato tater tots. Both were great. Ordered a side of aioli for the tots, and it was a home run. The sauce on the ribs was a bit on the sweet side for me. So adding sweet potato tots gave me a double sweet thing going on. Maybe next time onion strings? The ribs were super tender, and the meat really tasty!

My partner ordered a naked turkey burger, side of fries and cabbage salad.
The burger looked more like a burger on a clump of iceberg. I think he was envisioning a lettuce wrap burger, but once he 'wrapped' his brain around burger salad, we were good. He said he kept getting ""super salty"" bites with the cabbage salad. I think I liked mine more than he liked his. 

Over all, food was all pretty good. What really stood out was the service!
Once we got in to the register, every single person was AWESOME, helpful, smiling. We really felt welcomed and taken care of by the staff! With service like that, if they can iron out a few food kinks, they will be rocking that little corner in Downtown Summerlin!",y5rqDe6uO06WKZ26-Pla8g,1,0,4,Ry3EuQnncC-FzIjHQEv0Ng

2970852,2015-04-23,8,9c3LlXubVkbMwIrS8dIp0Q,"Where's the love? 

The reviews for Ribs and Burgers have not been kind. Most of them seem like growing pain issues, food service, menu placement, and timing. My experience here had none of these issues. Move over Dundee, this could be the next Cinderella story from down under. 

I came here for lunch with some work friends and based on the reviews, I was very intrigued to see how everything would pan out. We ordered off the wall hanging menu opposite of the counter, which seems to be an issue with some people, but they now offer paper menus, which you can grab and read while you wait inline. 

I ordered the sliders and a boozy milkshake. The sliders meal comes with two sliders, one all beef patty and one mini chicken breast. Which is a normal chicken breast, but cut in half. This meal comes with fries and is served on a cutting board. This board does leave little room to maneuver, I recommend asking for another plate for dipping sauces or for whatever you might need. 

The burger was delicious and cooked perfect. Very juicy with just a touch of pink in the middle. The sauce on top was simply called, ""Pink Sauce"", it's like a spicy aioli. An insanely good addition to the burger and added just a little kick. They have bottles of this stuff at the service area; I recommend dipping your fries in this stuff as well. Nummers!

The Chicken slider was super tender and super juicy. The veggies piled on top were crisp and added great texture and sweetness to the slider. It was good, but I preferred the burger to the chicken. 

The boozy milkshake was a Maple Bacon masterpiece. I'm not a sweet fan, but this thing was delicious. Great mix of sweet, salty and just a hint of vodka, which I preferred to an overly alcoholic sweet drink. I would recommend trying this at least once while you're here. They do offer flavors of boozy milkshakes incase you're not a maple fan. 

Overall, I had a great experience from the service, to the food, and vibe of the restaurant. I didn't use the sink in the middle of the restaurant; I preferred the bathroom to a public cleaning. I would most likely come back here, if I lived on this side of town. 

Hopefully Ribs and Burgers will find their glass slipper and go on to serve the hungry masses of Las Vegas.",i_DR3vdE73nVm2GlMbGpGA,14,14,4,Lged1jeSYApK94_vmnbNQw

My boyfriend and I went here on a Saturday afternoon. The place was not packed, yet not dead either. From Yelp stalking, I knew about the sink. Towards the end of my meal, my boyfriend was looking for wetnaps, when I pointed out the hand washing station in the middle of the dining room. His reaction was priceless. 
The menu was not huge, and covered all areas of burgers and ribs. 
Between us, we ordered a full rack of baby backs, an old school burger, and a grilled chicken sandwich. I also opted for a side salad versus fries for the side with my ribs.  
I will start by saying the ribs are ideal for my preference.  Some people like a dry rub, some like smokey. Some prefer the grill, while others prefer a slow cooker, fall off the bone style. For me, I like meaty, full of flavor, and not too tough. Well there is your description of the ribs, everything I like and more. There was a small amount of char, but the meat was still juicy and succulent. They have pink sauce, which I had no idea but apparently is a thing with ribs. (Tasted like fry sauce) My boyfriend loved them because he was reminded of how his mom used to cook his food. I did not try his grilled chicken sandwich, but he devoured it, so that speaks for itself. My old school burger was great. I LOVE when you can taste meat quality. It is a big deal to me, especially when I pay anything over $10 for a burger. ($9.50 for this one)
The side salad was even good. With that being said, it was the only thing we didn't finish. Good, but not comparable to the meat!

My son was really wanting ribs that is why we chose a rib place to eat that night. We asked if the could make the pork ribs into a kids size and they said no. So we walked out. We went back on a Thursday afternoon to try again. They had ribs this time but we had other issues. My husband and I wanted diet cokes. All they serve are bottled soda.

I ordered the Aussie burger which comes with an egg on it. I asked for medium rare because I'm from the south, so well-done meat is pointless murder in my opinion. I asked how long it would take because we were catching a movie next door and my recent, poor experience at Trattoria Regiano left me hungry and dissatisfied. She said, ""ten minutes or less is our thing"".  ""Perfect"", I replied. 16 minutes later starving. I look at the food window and I see my burger sitting there. Food runners were out back smoking or something. So I broke the rules, got up and grabbed it myself. The cooks looked at me and said, ""oh sorry bro the runners should bring it to you"". Obviously their gimmick is to serve their burgers ridiculously tall so you can't fit your mouth around it. It was absurd. Like 8 inches tall. I HATE eating burgers with a fork. The meat was well-done and the egg was hard rubber. I picked at it for a second but was irate. Left it sitting and peace'd out. The employees couldn't care a less, I'm sure.

The older gentleman who I believe is the Manager rarely acknowledges you with eye contact let alone a smile. But the cashier was very nice. My order was waiting when I arrived.  I noticed the French fries were placed in a Baggie out side. (Cold) normally every time they are in the same box as the ribs an remain nice an warm.  The ribs were dry, not plump an juicy.  My company said we can get the same thing at Smiths.  
It seems as Management is going down hill an is reflected in the quality.  There was a point that you felt very welcomed by the Chubby mgr who was very personable an would welcome you there an wish you a heartfelt thank you.  But now seems your at a QSR at the mall.

I am addicted to the onion strings, some of the best I have ever had.

So we ended up at a  ribs and burgers place, not quite salad but here we are. 

So as much as I would love to try their ribs, I was in a burger mood, I ordered the original, add bacon, add Swiss cheese (only have American and Swiss on the menu and I am not a fan of American cheese). My wife ordered the original with American cheese, 7yo daughter got the turkey burger, and my 3 yo daughter got the kids meal slider. We ordered a side of fries (large) and a cabbage salad (had apples, pine nuts, and vinegarette dressing) to share. 

This places has a different burger style than other great burger places, but still very good. I like different.
They are kinda sweet, but they did come with bbq sauce (not a ton),so maybe the sweetness is from the sauce. The burgers were very tasty, cooked perfectly, I really enjoyed my burger!

The fries were pretty good, not seasoned but good. However a large was to much for us. The cabbage salad was sweet as well, but I guess that is expected with the apples, it was decent but not my favorite... Kinda tasted like cranberries would had fit really well on the salad (pretty sure not an option). 

My daughters and wife all enjoyed their meals.

Good food for the money and fantastic service.  Manager Brandon really made sure it was a great experience.  I also appreciate and support that they employ people with visible tattoos.

I was pleasantly surprised on my first visit to Ribs and Burgers.  It's a casual place with an outdoor patio, but the menu was definitely full of potential.  My first choice was the salmon, but they were out (it was late evening).   I chose the kid menu ribs and my dining partner chose the chicken protein plate.    They also have military/veteran discount, which is always cool.

The kid menu ribs came with four hearty ribs and fries.  I don't generally eat fries, but I had a small nibble and they were delicious. The pork ribs were super tender, had just a bit of sauce, and were not gristly or fatty at all.   I would come back for the ribs for sure.

The chicken plate came with two seasoned chicken breasts and a cabbage/apple salad.  I am not a huge chicken fan, but that chicken was incredibly good.  Moist and seasoned perfectly.  The salad was fresh and crisp.  

They serve boozy milkshakes which sounded interesting.  I didn't get to try those on this trip.

Brandon, the manager, was super informative about the food.  I really appreciated him taking the time to talk to me about the food origin and preparation.

When we arrived, the ordering area was backed up a little.  There;s a choke point at the register when they're busy.  This will be interesting when it's in the 100s outside and people are waiting out the entrance.  There's a large menu on the left.  Some reviews have noted this and how awkward it is.  There are now paper menus available at the counter before you reach the terminals.

We met Mona who expedited our ordering and then sat with us at the table we chose on the patio.  After the order is taken, you get a metal pail with a number on it that lets the runner know where to deliver food.  The pail has two sauces, salt and pepper, some utensils, and some napkins--one for each person.

We ordered a lamb slab, an original burger with cheese, pork bullets with fries and coleslaw, onion strings, and three kid friendly milk shakes--maple bacon doughnut, birthday cake, and pecan banana split.

While waiting for our food, Mona explained the concept of R&B and one could sense her excitement and pleasure at bringing this Australian concept to the US, specifically in Downtown Summerlin where it was halfway between the fast food places at the south side of the mall and the high end places to the north.

My favorite of the meal was the lamb slab.  Good tasting meat with some good flavor from the marinade.  Since I didn't do the ordering, I'm not sure if burgers can be gotten at different temperatures.  Our burger was done well.  I would have had blood running down my chin.  The burger was OK but I didn't get the special nature of the flavors as described by Mona the way R&B constructed their burgers.  It was a burger.The menu notes their ""Famous R&B fries.""  There was nothing that would make these fries famous.  The fact that most of them went back when our dishes were cleared was testimony to how we both felt.

The 3 kid friendly shakes were hit and miss--mostly miss.  The birthday cake sprinkles clogged the straw so sipping it was almost impossible.  The maple bacon doughnut was just lacking in flavor but the banana split was a really good shake.

As for service, there were a number of servers always circling about but when we asked for more napkins, we did not get them.  A trip inside to the sink to wash up was necessary.  

We did ask for some ice water and we were brought glasses with ice water.  I did see some others with paper cups so I'm not sure if we were treated differently.

There are some kinks that need to be worked out.  The whole ordering process seemed overly long.  It did seem like they were turning over tables rapidly.  We'll see what the future brings.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,3,1,3,rvJo42-uTbnc-sGMmOeHdw

The decor is cute and rustic. There's a sink in the middle of the dining room which is different and fun....or may make you feel like a circus animal.  

I had a cheeseburger with crispy onions substituted for the raw. It had BBQ sauce, pickles and was cooked perfectly!  It was flavorful and juicy. A truly scrumptious burger. That said, it was $10 and didn't come with anything. Just a burger. My little guy had ribs and fries for $8 with a side of ranch for an extra $1.30. Seriously? That's a little much. Hubby had lamb ribs with cabbage salad. The kids ribs meal was generous and soooo tender. They fell apart and were yummy. Hubby raved about his! The salad was flavorful, light and fresh. So, 1 burger, 1 rib meal and 1 kids meal and 3 ice waters...$40. I think it's a bit steep for counter service. The prices would make more sense if they had waiter service. 

Everyone was very pleasant, welcoming and helpful. The food was delicious.

For only being in business 31 days (as of 4-18-15) they were very organized. Especially since it's dinner rush time on a Saturday night. The entire staff was friendly, professional and accommodating. NO COMPLAINTS!!!!!
There are two entrances into this place. One off the promenade that walks you through the patio seating and one from the street. The registers you order at are closer to the street entrance. The owner was working tonight and pleasantly greeted us and explained a few things about the menu since it was our first time in. NONE of their food is smoked! It's all cooked on an open flame.  
The GM was there too. Cleaning tables, running food and checking on the guest's experience. 
We split the Wagyu burger with cheese and added bacon. All of their burgers come cooked medium unless requested differently. We also split the pork bullet combo with a chicken slider & beef slider and fries. 
Everything was delicious! Burger was a perfect medium, juicy and full of flavor. I wish I had a bigger mouth to take a full bite. That sucker was tall. 
The pork bullets are basically rib tips but meatier. They were cooked to perfection. Not tough at all and had a unique flavor to them. I didn't need extra BBQ sauce because they came with enough. 
The chicken slider was great. Had a little spice bite to it.
Probably should have gotten 2 chicken sliders since we already had a burger but we wanted to try that too. 
The fries were great and even though the pink sauce wasn't meant for dipping fries, it works. 
It's ribs and a juicy burger so it's going to end up all over your hands right? No weak wet naps here! After you've licked off as much as you can you can wash them at the fully functional sink in the middle of the restaurant. Want more drinking water but don't want to go back up to the register?

But unfortunately, all the other negative reviews about this place were correct.

SUMMARY: 
Food was not worth the price.
Unorganized
Rude staff
Awkward layout

My BF and I was here for their grand opening but didn't bother going in because it was too crowded, but we returned to try it yesterday 3/29/15. Yes, it's a new restaurant and things are messy at first BUT I've never seen such a disorganized and rude restaurant like this.
There is no line formation and the menu is hard to see. I had to squeeze my way pass the line to grab the paper menu at the front (I felt rude doing that because I looked like I was cutting in line).
MENU:
The price of ribs were reasonable but the burgers and everything else were overpriced for the quality.

After we ordered, we were handed our bucket and cups for our water. The water was located in the middle of the restaurant, which was a bit awkward because it was next to the sink along with condiments. If this place was busy this area would be too crowded. I was able to fill up one cup and half to wait about 10 minutes to fill up my other cup, I was disappointed cause it was a very hot day and the water was warm. 
STAFF:
We waited about 20 minutes for our food, not bad, but during the wait we noticed that the servers kept delivering orders to incorrect tables. We slowly got turned off by this restaurant's ambiance as the ""manager"" (tall man in casual attire) would yell at his employees in front of customers on the floor.
My BF asked one of the servers if they had hot sauce and she snapped ""You have to get it yourself!You didn't see it next the water?"" Please train your servers and managers in customer service!!

FOOD:
Lamb Ribs $18: meh. My BF makes if better from the Costco ribs. I was only able to eat the meat(should I say FAT) on top because everything else was just tough and flavorless. LITERALLY FLAVORLESS, NOT EVEN A CHARCOAL OR LAMB FLAVOR. I buried it under the BBQ sauce so there was some flavor. They give you an opinion of side salad or fries, I chose salad. Salad was overdressed with oil, actually it was just SWIMMING in oil. Yeah, just oil...

Naked Mediterranean Burger $14: they should make it cheaper for no bun. They should also just name it regular hamburger because you could probably go to your fave fast food chain and get a better burger. It was overlooked/burnt with no flavor (maybe it had flavor but it was burnt away). It came out on a WILTED, OLD lettuce (see pic) had to send it back. The manager (short guy in causal attire) took it, said nothing and threw it back onto our table. NO APOLOGY!!! 

END: 1 star for now, might come back in a couple months to allow them to straighten out all their problems, IF they even survive.",XszsZOTE72wHCLcebcpeyQ,5,2,1,nm7ay6txKcen25kd0Z4vqA

The people that work here are also super nice. My boyfriend and I changed our mind last minute that we wanted regular fries instead of sweet potato tots, and the chef saw me standing in line and he pulled me out of line and asked how he could help!

4216328,2015-05-18,1,9c3LlXubVkbMwIrS8dIp0Q,"Ok, trying to be real here considering they have only been open about a month or so.  For the prices they charge, the food better be damn good, and it is really average.  Went on Sunday, 5/17/15, not overly crowded, plenty of seating, but took at least 20-30 minutes before our food came and it came in spurts.  Ordered Vegas Rib special, came with fries, ordered side of  house salad, and side of cole slaw,  and turkey burger.  First came the fries, then the cole slaw, then the ribs, then the turkey burger, and last came the salad.  Turkey burger was ok, it was actually a turkey breast, not ground turkey, liked the added items, like crispy onions and aioli sauce.  Ribs consisted of kalbi and baby back.  Kalbi was good, baby back not so; kind of dry and did not come off the bone. Fries were extra salty (yuck), cole slaw liquidy and bland, and the salad had some kind of vinegary dressing slathered all over it instead of on the side (no one asked how we wanted the dressing whereas most restaurants do). 

All in all, just another example of  a business wanting you to think they are upscale and trendy.  Sorry, making me order like I'm in McDonalds, then waiting for someone to bring me food, is not my idea of upscale, especially if the food is not that great. And if you take leftover food home, do not ask for a small box because it is only cardboard, has no wax covering on the bottom to hold grease and spills.  Our leftover cole slaw just oozed thru the box and by the time we got home, was all over our plastic cooler bottom.  Gross...",Dp8XPHRHByk_5y35aqMNRA,3,0,2,pQr1m4VKtiOJCsieZBJNnQ
4217292,2015-08-08,0,9c3LlXubVkbMwIrS8dIp0Q,"The food may be good but I may never know.  35 minutes to get a burger and here I still sit.

42 minutes later we got our food.  

Buns were cold as if they were just taken out of the fridge.  Onion straws on the turkey burger were cold.  The slider burger was cooked well done, not my favorite but had nice flavor.  The chicken slider was very tasty.  The ribs were flavorless.  The meat was cooked nicely and was juicy, perhaps the burnt charred outer crust that was inedible is where all the flavor would have been?

The lady running food looked sad and exasperated every time she dropped food off at a table.  I assume she was tired of having to apologize for extremely long wait times for food that should not take this long. 

Perhaps the manager (s) should have spent more time getting food out vs. standing front of the menu board trying to explain it all.  But then again he was too busy socializing with the hipster kids drinking water and overtaking the patio area to even notice the slow food times. 

My suggestion is the chicken sliders and call ahead at least an hour and get it to go.

My first time here I ordered their Greek salad and sweet potato tots. The salad was fresh and perfectly dressed with plenty of feta cheese and katamala olives...I'm grateful they didn't hold out on these because they're the best part of a Greek salad. The sweet potato tots are uh, uh, uh, good!!! They too were made fresh and served piping hot. I could snack of those bad boys all day! 

The second time I ate here I ordered the rib tipss off of the children's menu. These too were delicious. They were incredibly soft and slathered with tasty bbq sauce. My only gripe about them was there were small bones in almost each of them. For me it's only a slight inconvenience to maneuver around, but I could see a potential danger for children enjoying the dish. Parents you've been forewarned. This meal also came with perhaps the BEST french fries I've ever eaten. They were cooked perfectly, with a slightly crispy outside and soft center. These too were served fresh and hot with plenty of salt that kept me stuffing my face handful after handful.

We went on 3/21 The only menu is inside, which if there is a line can make the entrance very stuffy. You order at the front counter from girls who don't seem to know what they are doing.

I went with the Aussie burger and fries and my honey had the burger and ribs combo. I felt like I was winning all around because he got the combo just so I can try the ribs, winning!!!!
The Aussie burber was pretty good. I love egg on my burgers, I do wish the egg was runny but that may be too sexy for a family establishment. The fries was delicious! I've recently that many places do not season their fries with salt which makes NO sense to me. Ribs and Burgers isn't one of those places. Great job on the fries. 
The burger and ribs combo comes with two sliders, half a rack of ribs and fries. The Mr got mixed his sliders, one chicken, one beef - he enjoyed both. The ribs were pretty yum! They ran out of beef ribs so he got baby back. They were tender and meaty, just how i like them ;)
I also had a boozy milkshake, I asked for it to be strong and THAT it was. They really hooked it up! I don't recall the name but it had pecans, bananas, Godiva, and icecream - so good!

I had the Italian feather steak on a board with a side salad. I'm not a big steak person but when I have a craving I expect it to be filled with goodness.. and I'll have to say that Ribs and Burgers succeeded. The skirt steak wasn't tough, dry, or overcooked. It was probably one of the most tender and flavorful skirt steaks I've had.. and I feel like that's hard to do with that kind of cut. I dipped it a bit in their Pink Sauce which was delish.

Went last evening, it was once again in disarray. Employees did not know the menu, no one managing tables and the food was not correct. I tried to substitute fries for the sweet potato tator tots and was denied by the owner/manager. My wife tried to send back a chicken sandwich which had spicy chili topping added to her chicken sandwich. The waiter sat the sandwich on the counter for five minutes, then he brought it back and said we ordered that way. The chili was too spicy and turns out they charged us $1.50 extra for this option. Our friends ordered a plain chicken sandwich with no mayo. Guess what, it came with everything and extra mayo.

I guess that's asking too much. I was torn between the Aussie and Wagyu, ultimately ordering the Wagyu burger. Burgers come cooked medium, so I went along with the recommendation. Unfortunately, mine came out well done. Such a waste of Wagyu beef. For a restaurant to be two levels off on the doneness scale is disappointing, especially considering I ordered at the recommended level.

The employees were friendly, but the speed of service was lacking. This restaurant doesn't know if it's fast food or sit down. I don't mind having no service after ordering at register, but you need to figure out your identity. If you have the soda fountain behind the counter and bring out drinks after seating as if it were a sit down restaurant, then you need to provide service and refills like a sit down restaurant. I finished my whole burger before ever getting a refill on my soda. By then it was too late.

On the bright side, the fries were tasty. They remind me of the fries I used to get at lunch in middle school. The sweet potato tots were delicious. You can't go wrong with sweet potato anything.",s8v5KKrZShVK29M4XP8Q3A,0,0,3,pT-K6ZADzVVLEN3skfQzHA

They just kept cranking out the people in line with no tables to be had as we all piled up with no where to stand. We finally saw our opportunity to bus our own table. Took forever for someone to figure out dirty dishes needed to be moved and still 4 glasses and the leftover tip stayed there for the duration of our visit. Waited 45 minutes for food which came delivered by the cook one plate at a time. Forgot fries, drinks, never got a receipt and to top it off the food was mediocre at best. Chopped salad was not chopped and had very little of anything in it, only good thing was tomatoes. Vegas pork ribs were tough, fatty, cold. Burgers were lukewarm and too rare. Never asked how we wanted them cooked. Watched people everywhere getting up to help themselves to ketchup, napkins, and whatever else they needed because what help there was were too busy trying to deliver food plates. They ran out of beef ribs and something else I heard them say while I was standing waiting for a table. A coke consisted of a 6 oz. coke bottle served without glass or ice. Water was a bottle - free.

My boyfriend ordered the Wagyu burger (which I tried, of course) and it was excellent! He ordered medium rare and they erred on the side of rare - which is always the right choice with a good piece of meat.  

We also shared the Butchers salad, with easy dressing.  It was a pretty basic salad - nothing spectacular, but because the burgers were so good, I didn't need a stand-out salad.  

My only complaint is the bun.  For such great burgers, the buns were surprisingly awful.  They were too flaky and too big.  We saw someone else who had a different bun (maybe sesame seed)?  If you remember, ask for whatever alternate bun they have.

I remembered their fries were really great from the YEE event, so when my friend wanted a snack (preferably fries), this was the first thing that popped into my mind.

You order at the counter and if you're dining in, you're given a numbered watering can with fry sauce, utensils, and napkins. Then, you choose a table in the dining room. There's also a sauce station where you can grab ketchup, mustard, etc.

The service and vibe of the place was wonky. There were only five other patrons at our arrival and it didn't feel welcoming. The person who took our order seemed to have difficulty and he was barely paying attention since a couple other employees were speaking to him at the same time. Although we only ordered fries, my friend had to repeat the order three times and she read it exactly as the menu listed it: Our Famous Fries. After our fries arrived, we requested a dish to put the fry sauce in and he was confused. Then, we saw him ask the kitchen staff and brought a large bowl to the table (the same one the fries arrived in). I'm not sure if that's typical, but it was an awkward situation for sauce and dipping fries. We were assisted by another person with fry delivery and water refills, and fortunately, he was very pleasant and helpful.

Anyway, the fries were even better than I remember. They have everything you want in a fry. Light, crispy exterior and tender interior. Very lovely. The fry sauce, although not as amazing as I recalled, was still a delicious companion. Those fries are enough to want to return again and again (and I will!).",TdYKJgSgY2GF_YJnwsi5yQ,7,5,4,W4t4dBx6a9q_DhMiAT7Msw

As far as the food went the ribs were tender, but my boyfriend did not like the seasoning. Another thing he did not like was the way it was served. His FULL rack of ribs was served on a smaller board, making the ribs touch the table. Maybe think about a bigger cutting board for a FULL rack??

I'm a huge fan of ribs, but I decided to go different and get a lamb burger.  My fiance on the other hand got the ribs and burgers combo which comes with either french fries or salad (sneaky little b*stard knew I wanted ribs).  The combinations of my burger went really well together, I'm not a huge fan of sauce but I loved the Tzatziki sauce in it!  The meat was nice and juicy on mine.

I was getting the steak sandwich before I noticed the grinders. Not the case, the meat was over worked and to compressed. I ordered med rare, what I got was med well. 
  Salad - It was a average salad with a average piece of over cooked steak.

Delish!! The beef slider was a perfect medium rare (something I only hoped for when I ordered rare), the sauce on the grilled chicken slider was very complimentary, and the ribs were perfectly charred on the outside and juicy on the inside. This place could use a couple more options for BBQ sauce given one of their two specialties is ribs, but very satisfying over all. The food was the reason for the 3 stars. The service was the reason for the lack of the other 2.

Invited in by Public Relations while the Australian Team was still in town working on issues related to food, service, and design it was just prior to 5:00pm that a friend and I approached Downtown Summerlin's Ribs & Burgers, and with a line of perhaps twenty snaking out the front door our first impression was one echoed by several previous visitors - pure chaos, several potential patrons taking a pass while we actively had to seek out our liaison, a three person process that took us through two persons who seemingly had no clue what was going on.

Described (more than once) as a quick casual concept, the focus on quality food without the 'fine dining' feel, Ribs & Burgers acts as if their setup is something unfamiliar despite locations such as MTO Café offering the exact same thing, but by shortening the distance from entrance to counter while servers still in-training struggle with a rather limited menu the result is one with peculiar delays and prolonged lingering - the diner eventually receiving a numbered bucket and left to find themselves a seat while food is prepared.

Spending most of the early visit speaking to Mona, a pleasant brand spokeswoman clearly excited by the prospect of brining the high quality concept to US Shores, it was perhaps a ten minute wait between ordering and receiving our food and having heard so much about the braising process, special sauce, and sourcing of meat and produce it was with high expectations that first bites of 'pork bullets' were enjoyed - each bite not exactly 'falling off the bone' tender, but decidedly well prepared with nuances of sweetness rounded out by several sorts of spice.

Having received no water on order, and only two napkins for a meal that was obviously quite likely to be messy, it was on request that the first was delivered while the second never appeared and allowing for the fact that our order continued to arrive as readied from the kitchen with only one mistaken item appearing unannounced it was onward to the burger, 'chips', and onion straws that our dining commenced, the fries completely forgettable and really no better than those from the Golden Arches while the piled-high burger and crispy onions were indeed quite good, the former featuring a great grind beneath a good sear while the latter were surprisingly dainty and entirely greaseless with plenty of natural flavor to be found.

Moving onward to the most intriguing item, the novelty of lamb ribs not lost on someone who loves lamb and finds it far underrepresented on menus here in the States, suffice it to say that the meat's natural flavor was not overwhelmed in the least by the braise or the baste and although the provided knife was barely capable of sawing through connective tissue adjoining the rack a little elbow grease proved well worth the effort, each saporous bite offering a reason to return even when taking into account the somewhat sizable tab for something served in a 'quick, casual' space.

Rounding out the evening with a trio of shakes, at this point a 'must' for any place serving burgers in the 702, we were told by the man up front that the team had recently stopped using gelato from Messina as they wanted something more 'thick and rich,' but whether an effect of temperature, prep time, or our decision to eschew alcohol only the Pecan Banana Split proved truly memorable in texture or taste - the birthday cake thin and milky with sprinkles clogging the straw while the Maple Bacon Donut tasted mostly like creamy Log Cabin syrup without a bit of pork or smoke to be found.

Still finding their footing in terms of service and structure while already serving up some rather excellent 'American Classics,' no matter where the concept hails from, it will be interesting to see how Ribs & Burgers does as other similar speed locations with more local recognition open nearby at a lower price point.  Certainly offering something a little different, with high quality ingredients readily apparent, it will require a few tweaks to make Ribs & Burgers really 'work,' but if these things can get dialed in I've no doubt the concept could succeed in several large markets nationwide.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,7,7,3,c7HP8uC7zFTevPiLYE-Maw

5307782,2015-04-13,1,9c3LlXubVkbMwIrS8dIp0Q,"Ribs & Burgers, do you pay attention to yelp?

The first time we came here, a couple interrupted us at the register to say they had been waiting forty minutes for their food. The woman actually encouraged us to leave. So we did.

It was one of those moments where curiosity gets the best of you, so we went back the next day. I guess we waited 15-20 minutes, which is fine. I was afraid my vegetarian burger would be bland, so I ordered jalapeños. This was not the case! The portobello was packed with flavor. Super delicious. It was also so big that I didn't need to order the sweet potato tots. My only compliant is that the mushroom is so juicy that it made the bottom bun soggy (yuck), but maybe that's just #portobelloproblems.

The lamb rack was served over fries, and whatever issues he had with it seemed to be inherently lamb related (tougher type of meat, etc). 

Some issues need to be remedied: house water, or a quicker way to order a second drink (perhaps asking a passing server), and bigger plates. Serving meals on a cutting board is cute, but doesn't leave enough room to effectively cut your rack of ribs. Some proper hot sauce would be nice too.",6qTJVWJ9RmVuoHi1CNcb_g,1,1,3,a5vM4srXNIkML0TaObGxQg

More recently, it seemed like ratings were on the upswing and since my family will easily come to consensus agreement on burgers for a meal, we stopped in on a Saturday afternoon.

Without any line, we ordered five sandwiches and I was pleased that the young man at the counter reviewed the entire order before he entered it. I ordered the Wagyu burger with a Brooklyn Brown Ale. Also ordered were the Pocket, the Old School Cheese, the Chili Chicken, the Turkey, and sides of fries and sweet potato tots to share.

My burger was cooked as I ordered with the beef being juicy and flavorful. Sauces are something I don't prefer on my burgers, but the BBQ and pink sauces paired well with my sandwich. The sweet potato tots had a crispy outside with steaming hot shredded sweet potato on the inside. They didn't last too long on the table. Other than my wife's burger being under-cooked to her liking but still edible, everyone else polished off their sandwiches completely.

We had no issues with service, which included about a short ten minute wait for food and a visit by a manager at our patio table to check on us. $75 might be a little steep for a party of five but a price I'm not up in arms about. We'll definitely be back to try the ribs.

With all the food competition in downtown summerlin I would expect this place is not long for this world. But some of you seem to like it and while that confirms my pessimistic views of humanity, I will try to set the record straight.

The place looks pretty nice. It's casual and probably a fun place to hang out and the presentation of the food is enjoyable. The let's put our food on a slab of wood style can be found here.  But past the appearance lies food that should leave you wondering who exactly did they hire to run this kitchen.

-Beef Ribs. Tough chewy and borderline edible. BBQ sauce certainly not A+ so nothing to offer here.

-Burgers. As a category these are probably slightly below average. I've had a few different ones and they are both indistinguishable from each other but pretty much just sloppy messes. No add ons will fix that the buns don't appear to be made in house, nor is the meat seasoned all that well. They just slap on thousand island and hope for the best.

-Fries. I don't even understand what they do to these. They feel like cardboard, certainly not crispy. Close to flavorless.

-Sweet Potato Tots. Soggy and not seasoned. Bleh.

-Orange Creamsicle Shake. Okay this was actually good but Im just gonna go to Jamba if I want an orange creamsicle drink. Maybe the drink gave this place it's extra star. Maybe.

If you're high maybe you'd like this place. Otherwise just pick any of the other 50 fast service restaurants in the shopping mall.",TZhIAnp1m3RzWevju1mp1g,5,2,2,SJtBPgQtGrbs5vtocVRzjg
5607808,2015-04-02,0,9c3LlXubVkbMwIrS8dIp0Q,"I was really disappointed. A lot of my complaints are things that can be modified to make the experience better but due to the number of little things, it seems like a bad execution of a mediocre concept.

FOOD: OK
I got a burger with mushroom(s) and cheese. THe meat was cooked really well. Many of my complaints about medium rare in vegas are that most places think that rare  is medium rare. And its not. They had their meat temp spot on. The presentation was definitely arty/rustic, but completely pointless. My burger was over 9 inches high and I had to disassemble it to even start to eat it. The mushroom was a solid portobello cap that was grilled. Tasted good, but non functional because the minute you bit into a whole cap that's been grilled, all the juices come out at once. Makes for a messy addon with a burger when some assembly is already required. 

With so much work required to deal with the food, i'm not sure why they put a piece of paper under your burger and then serve your burger with a fork and knife. ""Here, you're totally going to need to use these and we're going to make you work for it."" 

There were a lot of fries. They didn't say that when i ordered and they needed too. One for me and one for my two year old. Extreme overkill. I mean heart attack overkill.

My son tried the chicken burger, First, its not a burger, its a chicken breast slider. Second, massively over marinated meats aren't a good idea for children menu items. In fact, I won't ever go back with my kid because there's nothing for him there.

SERVICE: Good - we were in early so i'm not sure what the rush hour service is like. 

AMBIANCE - good/confused - i tend to wonder why so much is spent on dust collecting decor - having a hundred meat grinders sitting in steel shelves just seems not too efficient. But it didn't impact the taste so...",3EPBhYWMcglaqhJYgcofHg,0,2,2,NAE0mpFd4benDRvH5L6V5A

We immediately flagged down a waiter and expressed our discontent and they swept it off and promised another... Being that it is a new restaurant we forgave the mistake easily.

It's a nicely decorated, modern looking place. Lots of meat grinders filling the shelves. Not just a couple, but maybe 80 of them. Don't ask me why I found this fascinating. I just did. I also found fascinating the fact that there is a sink located right in the middle of the restaurant. 

My friend and I decided to go for ribs, so we ordered the Vegas Rib plate for $18. Comes with two meaty portions of baby back ribs, and 3 Short Ribs. 

Baby Back Ribs were very good, firm yet tender the way ribs are supposed to be. If you think great ribs fall off the bone, then you don't know good ribs. They come seasoned with a sauce, which was mild with a hint of pepper. Very tasty and I enjoyed them 4.5/5

Short Ribs were also cooked to perfection with a sweet sauce that wasn't korean kalbi sauce and wasn't teriyaki, but a new sauce for my palate. I loved them! 5/5

Negatives..... Cole Slaw....served in a thimble sized dish, this wasn't creamy or vinegary or anything. Lacked any imagination. We both thought it wasn't good.

Table BBQ sauce.....I poured some out and my friend asked what it was. I took a taste, and didn't know. I took another taste....still didn't know. He took a taste, and said it was ketchup. I disagreed because there was a hint of some kind of extra flavor. Our waitress said it was BBQ sauce. I'd pass on this.

Overall, this is pretty decent BBQ, way better than Rollin Smoke. Those guys should visit these guys and learn to cook ribs. Portions were great for $18.

They were so delicious that I can't praise them enough. They were so tender, juicy and so flavorful - and cooked medium exactly as I ordered. They tasted like they had been marinating for days in a lemon herb sauce. When they were served they had this incredible caramelized glaze on them. The severing size was very generous too. I hear this is an Aussie concept, and they sure know their lamb.  The french fries are a real treat too - crispy but not crunchy, with just the right amount of salt. Fortunately, or unfortunately, you just can't stop eating them. 

The decor is kind of modern but comfortable - not cool, hard as bricks little chairs, but lots of comfy banquettes. I'm the kind who hates having sticky hands after I eat ribs, but I hate those smelly wet naps even more. This restaurant has a sink right in the middle of it to wash your hands before and after eating - what a pleasure. The staff was friendly, and I loved the open kitchen concept. The aromas of the grilled meats waft throughout the restaurant. The music is not too loud either, as in many restaurants these days. You don't have to shout and lean across the table to be heard.

I can't wait for my family to come to town so that I can take them to have these ribs - they all love lamb as much as I do. I'll definitely return to this restaurant frequently to have more of those ribs.

Why would you ask a customer for their contact info and not contact them immediately? It shows how much they value their business and customers.

Takes some getting use to cause at first glance the place is nicely decorated you would assume they take your order table side. But it works and we enjoy coming here to eat. The staff is always friendly and constantly check in with you to make sure everything is ok! This must stem from the Manager Brandon, you won't miss him he's as friendly as friendly come. Always makes sure your service is met with a smile and constantly checking on his staff to make sure everyone is taken care of. If you want great service and food, look no further.

Mediocre food and the price doesn't fit what you get (yeah that rhymes). If I have to pay that much I would want someone to come to the table and take my order. I should not have to wait in line to order food and pay more than it will cost me if I went to a full service restaurant. 

Order - Ribs, Burger, and Creamsicle shake. 

Pros - The location is great. Outside seating is nice. Good service. The burger was good

Cons - Price, ribs were just ok at best. creamsicle shake was $10 and was nasty.",osQ4bMibJLmMPAtovvEkJw,3,1,3,6qZ6j1Kwziw4bI4am6CikA
5918778,2016-10-08,1,9c3LlXubVkbMwIrS8dIp0Q,"October 7 is a special anniversary for Ribs and Burgers. I wasn't sure if it was the birthday of this particular location or that of their original restaurant. Whatever the case may be, the tall and very pleasant-looking lady who took my order, excitedly told me that I would received $5 off my order of their Original Burger. Sounds good to me!!!

I also added a side of bacon to that order. Probably the best thing you can do to their burgers. If you are not opposed to having bacon in your diet, then forking over another $1.40 for their bomb bacon is a must!  It is smoky, crispy and good that must be why it is the number one banned substance by some major world religion.  Based on just having their bacon, I think their ribs is likely to be above average too. 

So before I get ahead of my self this is what I ordered on my inaugural visit to Ribs and Burgers.

Original Burger - Grain-feed Beef Patty, Grilled, Basted, and served on Sesame Seeded Bun with Iceberg Lettuce, Tomato, Spanish Onion*, Dill Pickles, and their Pink & BBQ Sauce.  Added the Bacon.  I added the BACON!

Aussie Burger - Grain-feed Beef Patty, Beetroot, Pineapple, Swiss Cheese, Bacon, Fried Egg, Iceburg Lettuce, Tomato, Spanish Onion*, Dill Pickles, and their Pink & BBQ Sauce.

Non-alcoholic version of the S'Mores Me Up Milkshake (Ice Cream, Marshmallow and Hersay's Chocolate).

Ordering process was friendly and smooth.  There was a small crowd ahead of me, so the modest wait time was completely acceptable. But that area is not large, so line will easily go out the door if there is more than about 10 people placing their order or waiting to do so.

There is a huge menu for you to inspect just inside the door, which is pretty straight forward.

About the food. My S'Mores Me Up Shake took a few minutes to be served. But it looks and tasted just like a plain chocolate milk shake. No marshmallow or pieces of real Hersey's Milk Chocolate pieces to garnish came with the order. I am assuming that their recipe has changed since they opened, because Yelp photos of the same drink looks different than mine. Maybe the non-alcoholic version does not get the same finishing touches as the age-restricted version.  Subtle age discrimination at work here. Junior Civil Rights Groups, Teen Titans, and Young Justice League would all be outrage at the fact that minors and those that opted to not booze it up are not receiving equal treatment under FDA restaurant labeling requirements.  All this potential legal drama over an innocent milkshake!!!

Aussie Burger - Very substantial burger!  Most people can't even open their mouth wide enough to fit this burger. I suspect that magical Slytherin or muggles with the ability to unhinged their jaw or expert practitioners of foot in mouth talent (e.g., Donald Trump?) would be capable of accomplishing this feat. 

Totally got sidetracked. So... Best part about this burger is that it comes with BACON. Plain old raw Red Onion served in all burgers instead of the sweet Spanish Onions (* Spanish Onions have lower sulfur content, naturally sweeter but with shorter shelf life) in the description.  The Fried Egg would be better if is closer to the ""over easy"", so the runny  yolk can add that extra richness to the burger experience. The pineapple and beetroot can both be eliminated, it didn't add anything except bulk and carbs.  Overall just an average premium burger.

The Original Burger is decent, closer to the ideal for purist, I personally think that it is better than the Aussie once the BACON is added.

Medium was requested for doneness, but both burgers served closer to well done (just a tiny bit of red left on a canvas of brown. Still juicy, but that is probably because they baste it during the grilling process.

A nice amenity provided by the restauranteur is a hand sink in the middle of the dining area. No need to find a restroom or organize all your girlfriends for an expedition, just to not have sticky hands on the drive to the next destination.

Summary: Outdoor seating area is nice when the temperature is not excessively hot or cold. Burgers are just alright. I really wish it was better given the effort to develop their signature burgers. I overpaid for chocolate shake which I can get cheaper and better at Burger King (BK Vanilla Milkshake tops my list for fast food milkshakes).  Their $10 lunch combo is a good value if you are already at Downtown Summerlin.
