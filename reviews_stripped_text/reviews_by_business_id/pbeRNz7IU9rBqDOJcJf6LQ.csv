For food this restaurant is very good and tasty but the michelada was dissapointing. Took one drink and had to get something else. The micheladas I'm used to drinking have a nice spicy mixture with beer with a spicy salt mix on the rim but they don't make it like that there. It had no flavor at all not even beer flavor just tasted like water and regular salt. Not good sorry",j_oYbxrlz2BiAWyy3j6dfA,0,0,3,wZFhPJnlOojW_jTAyLQq_w

1120486,2015-03-23,0,pbeRNz7IU9rBqDOJcJf6LQ,"La Palapa was a fairly authentic Mexican restaurant. It had the colors on the outside and very friendly service from the staff. I really enjoyed the flavorful carne asada and beans. I wasn't crazy about the yellow-style type of rice. I guess because I'm used to tomato-based rice. The beef tamale was also good and not dried out as I often encounter when eating tamales. The waitress was kind, friendly and accommodating that she made our meal very pleasant. The one unusual thing that I did not like were all the people coming up to you to make money or begging. There was an accordion player, a trio of singers, a duet that kept singing at our table although we said no thank you, a little boy that was selling cookies, a trumpet player, a dancer, and then, I think, two Americans because they spoke perfect English and looked American, begging for money because someone in their family was dying of cancer. All this while we were eating or trying to eat. It was the strangest experience that I ever had dining and reminded me of when I was in Cabo San Lucas when people would wake you up on the beach to sell something to you (Hello...can't you see that I'm sleeping!). But that's Mexico for you. I can't imagine why the owner would allow all these people to come in and disturb the customers. I imagine this is authentic to how the restaurants are in Mexico. I don't think I'll go back because of that.",y5YNzZwQuYxgE-jSDcZLxA,1,0,3,RsubFYCiQ7Zqt_L1IWi_fA

1317907,2012-10-22,3,pbeRNz7IU9rBqDOJcJf6LQ,"Writing this review because there are so many debates about whether or not Las Vegas can serve up good Mexican food.

I was referred to La Palapa by a friend who hails from Mexico, and is picky about their food.  Especially mariscos!  I myself, having spent a significant number of years being part of a Mexican family, have a discerning pallet when it comes to Mexican fare.

I arrived at La Palapa with my friend and his family, and upon sitting down he was immediately greeted with a michelada 'preparada'.  This is one of the best inventions ever, so I quickly followed suit, while presented with several options of the cerveza to be used in the drink.  I'm a traditionalist....Modelo Especial is my standard.  I have to say, this preparada was unique to anything I've had elsewhere, including those in Mexico City.  It was much lighter in tomato than most, but had great spicey goodness!  The 2nd one was better than the 1st!

I split a tasting of shrimp and octopus ceviche cocktail and a combination shrimp and fish taco.  All was phenomenal.  I think there was a full pound of 21-25 shrimp in my ceviche, and the lightly fried goodness in the tacos was amazing.  Super fresh and awesome.  Even did a dozen raw oysters on the 1/2 shell as appetizer.  a) I wouldn't risk this at 90% of the restaurants in Vegas and b) I never thought sliders with lime juice and Tapatio would be awesome!  I was wrong!

Needless to say, this was worth the drive off the beaten path.  I'll definitely be back!",6x3aIb8SLZcOFcHEcWBLog,7,3,4,g-Q7_8Ot-CI9RZzcPG9ZAg

All of the fried fish dishes we tried were very good. Price for 3 of us to eat (with 1 beer and 1 horchata) was about $45. We had a cerviche that was quite good too.

This is the kind of place you'd expect random people to walk in and sell you roses and candy bars.

3321304,2012-07-20,2,pbeRNz7IU9rBqDOJcJf6LQ,"Best shrimp tacos ever! Best cerveza preparadas ever! Awesome service! Nobody ever gives me a hard time for not speaking Spanish.....probably cuz I'm Asian. There are places that expect me to speak Spanish cuz they assume I am Latina but it's all good over here.

Their fish and shrimp tacos are battered and fried, served with shredded cabbage, pico de gallo, and a white cream sauce with a lemon wedge. If I can recall they are huge and cost about $3 - $3.50. Not bad at all cuz they are not greedy here. The campachana cocktail with shrimp and octopus always tastes so fresh. I have yet to find it better anywhere else.

Their cerveza preparadas are made with a concoction of shrimp stock, lime juice, hot sauce and whatever beer of your choosing. They are served in a frosty goblet that makes the beer so delicious on a hot day, after a long day at work, after a long night of partying--the morning after of course, or just any old freaking time they're open. The first few sips have that icey layer of frost on them that I just love so much. Almost like a beer slurpee, kinda....not really. Just go there and get one.

Also, you have to try the prebalada. It's like a michelada, but with shrimp stock instead of Clamato. It's pretty much the best and great for hangovers.

The rice was also tasty and lightly flavored.

4484298,2011-02-12,1,pbeRNz7IU9rBqDOJcJf6LQ,"La Palapa is a Mexican seafood restaurant on the north side of town offering incredibly fresh underwater fare at incredibly affordable prices. 

I insist that you start with a Modelo Especial served michelada style, or 'preparado' ($4). This is a light Mexican beer laced with hot sauce and fresh lime juice, served ice cold in a massive salt rimmed goblet. Sounds strange, I know, but once you try it you'll be hooked. I actually had a similar drink served to us in a plastic cup at the HUGE Broadacres swap meet on the north end LVB, which I also recommend for delicious cheap eats, but this is the first time (and certainly not the last) I've had it in a restaurant.

Then, you should order the fish taco ($3). This was primarily desirable to me because of the price, but once it came to the table I knew I wouldn't be let down. It needed a shot of acidity (may I recommend their house salsa, a dash of Tapatio, and a squeeze of lemon?) but the beer battered fish was hot, crispy, and oh so good.

The entree of shrimp served ""a la palapa"" (I love saying their name, try it!) came to the table looking one note and blonde, and not in the appealing sort of way men like. I was amazed, however, after taking the first bite of snappy, sweet shrimp. It was flavored with bay leaves and some sort of dried pepper, and tasted fantastic, especially when bundled up in a warm tortilla with their great refried beans and rice.

I also very much enjoyed the combination tostada of octopus (pulpo) and shrimp (camaron) ($3.75). There aren't many places outside of the Mediterranean you can get great octopus, but this was fantastic considering our desert surroundings. It was tender, yet firm, and very fresh. In fact, none of the seafood I've had here has been anything but fresh, so if you like offerings of the sea but don't want to drown in debt, La Palapa should be on your 'must visit' restaurant list.

PS. Do you like flan? Then don't pass on dessert. La Palapa's version is as creamy as cheesecake. I'm generally a poster child for self-restraint when it comes to over-indulging in foods that are very bad for you (I'm part foodie, part health nut), but I can only attribute that to my strict evaluation of whether or not something is worth the calories. The flan here most certainly is, so I left only a token bite.",RiU99Ze8UEoUutHMl73HIg,11,5,4,0owZdsejtZX_V6PBmZ9-ag

Started with a shrimp cocktail.  It was very boring, shrimp with tomato juice, a scant amount of cucumbers and one small piece of avocado.  There was very little flavor to it.

The service was ok.  I was super irritated when a lady singing and playing the guitar on the other side of the restaurant  came over and demanded a tip.
