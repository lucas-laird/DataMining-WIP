Quick Review
+   Great location within striking distance of multiple buildings (A,B,C) on campus. Parking is free. Food OK.

+/- Food OK. You aren't asking anyone to freeze this and ship it to you via courier service if you are across the world. 

-    Breakfast menu could be expanded and competitively priced (although, they have no competition, which may be the problem). Limited desserts are not good.

Employee of Excellence: María. Anyone named María at a taco shop is definitely going to be an employee of esteem.

In One Sentence: Consistent, cheap -- although not exactly inexpensive -- calories conveniently located in B (or is it C?).

This might be the very embodiment of cheap, Mexican-inspired-Southwest-based dive. One always wishes it were better ....

It pains me to relegate María is just an average three-star. We've been through so much, María! 

There really is nothing else around here (walking distance) and with the bizarre sudden appearance and even more rapid disappearance of Smashburger® across the street at Charleston Festival, it might be Maria's or certain starvation (if one did not bring food) unless you have time for the exceptional Moko (http://www.yelp.com/biz/moko-asian-bistro-las-vegas) across the street or upstart Sofrito Rico at Campus Commons (http://www.yelp.com/biz/sofrito-rico-authentic-puerto-rican-cuisine-las-vegas). Chipotle® sucks (http://www.yelp.com/biz/chipotle-mexican-grill-las-vegas-5?hrid=k9UPnGqKGDDMGiRMsNmlAQ&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)). 

I digress.

I am not going over all the plates I have had here. I've had too many. (Check the check-ins.)

What I will do is exhort you to not try the desserts because they are no bueno. And anyone who knows me knows that I love my sweets. No bueno, amigos. Tacos are alright. Burritos do well in a bind when you have very little time to be wasting. 

They need food trucks on campus to elevate the food racket around here. Go grab one of your campus senators by the collar and demand they introduce an item for the next agenda meeting calling for food trucks to be invited to campus. 

Until then, we have María's.

This place usually has a pretty long line going as its located on the CSN Charleston campus and is undoubtedly the most delicious thing to eat on campus. Because of this, the food can take a little longer, but they do make everything to order!

They have a 99c menu but the items I've seen from that menu are very small. They also offer fresh fruit frescos and horchata. The salsas are obviously homemade. Overall, good cheap greasy food. I approve!",Gap65780O9PI3Ui7Zj6Avw,3,3,4,NMG-XL__5nspBSQYGbRzOQ
4585757,2016-06-09,1,vZafOAECfChenbQjhlZQlA,OMG I have found my new favorite taco place! I came here because my professor recommended it to the class. The service was amazing and the cashier was very inviting! I got my food within 5 minutes. I ordered 3 carne asada taco and woahhhh it exceeded my expectations. It tasted very authentic and was very flavorful. It tastes amazing with the green sauce which had a kick to it. I tried one taco with only lime and it was just as amazing because you could taste everything. They serve a variety of items and have fresh desserts like tres leches cake and mango with chili powder. Today's special was the chicken or steak chimichanga and was only $6! It was gigantic. I will definitely be back every morning before my class starts!,nRicr5sDYwpDUM9s2bjS4w,1,1,5,x3UnFIvQxjDNuxiRVw9ZVQ

My girlfriend(s) and I like to come here for lunch during our break from Art Class on Fridays. 

Quality of their food fluctuates depending on who makes it. My friend prefers to not have onion on her veggie burrito (our usual order) yet sometimes, the staff unconsciously adds some in anyway. We've had oily burritos, some with too much cilantro (*cringe*), some with too little taste, some stuffed with fistfulls of cheese. Churros are occasionally coated in so much sugar that we'd have to scrape them off in the trash.

Only uppity to Maria's are their 'free refill fridays' where we take advantage of the opportunity and get ourselves a couple servings of thirst quenching horchatas. Watch out once again with who prepares your food because the horchata quality can range from super bland to too much cinammon. 

We've still got about 4 weeks to go before the semester ends. Guess that'll be how much longer we'll be checking Maria's out, unless we get another friday class in fall.",QJMOgjRYeogK43kyfX6PKw,0,0,3,M6oByD4-Dzxg072eyYZrfQ

The B.R.C. burro is plain, but very tasty. I would also recommend trying the chilaquiles, carne asada tacos or fries, and an agua fresca to go with it (the horchata is great!) And Maria is very nice! I'll always be coming back here.
P.S. If you don't like anything spicy, don't try the chile, its delicious but very spicy.",LpvLLwebARJ02L8jgEhoVg,1,1,4,X8WXRE6KexGoxTHCNb-OUg
5471053,2013-04-15,4,vZafOAECfChenbQjhlZQlA,"The food is really good here, and depending on the plate you get, you can get a lot of it. My boyfriend usually gets a ton of meat and stuff on his plates; the cheese enchiladas though, not so much. My friend gets a burrito with just beans and cheese, and it's a LOT, so I guess I will have to do that since the price is lower, and there is more food. Every meal comes with a drink, and it costs something like 50c to get a refill. 
The beans and rice are my favorite part though! So good! And the enchilada sauce is just right for me.
They also have Churros! Yay! Those are really great and crispy, with a soft center and oh so yummy!",g8_8roieVRwGJVTpNOgbYw,2,2,4,TMZ6Q_vowZJsKJIq6ssS0Q
5811272,2017-12-07,1,vZafOAECfChenbQjhlZQlA,"I'm not one to post rude Yelp reviews, but this place truly inspired me. This place sucks balls. I ordered chicken enchiladas with Roja sauce last night. Worst plate of enchiladas I've ever had, and I've eaten A LOT of enchiladas. Absolutely bogged down with shredded lettuce, getting soggy. Unmelted cheese. Bland, thin roja. Unseasoned chicken. No salt or spice to be found. 
As Mexican food goes, the place scraped the bottom of the barrel. Look, I'm an L.A. native. I'm a strong lover of Mexican food and this place was some of the most abysmal I've had.
To top that off, when I went and politely said that I did not enjoy the dish and I would like something else, even saying I would pay full price for another dish, who I assume is the manager stormed up and was disgustingly rude toward me. That's probably what pushed me to write the angry review. If it was just about nasty enchiladas, this would not be an issue. She essentially was aggressively trying to tell me why I was wrong for my opinion on her shitty food. Like I don't know shit about Mexican food. ""That's how we do it. That's how it's made."" Yeah, bitch. I get that's how you do things, how you do things is just fucking terrible. 
Then, she insists multiple times without provocation that the most she can do is give me a 50% discount, like I was begging that bitch for free food. I said I would pay full price if they wanted! Get out of my face, take my goddamn debit card and make me some better food! That lady's attitude is repulsive. 
Nice girl at counter gave me street tacos for free after her warden walked off, which was nice. The tacos were better but were still not even close to worth it since I could get street tacos from a million better places in this town. Plus, tacos are harder to fuck up.
When I walked up to get napkins, the owner basically acted like I'm a nuisance to her. I'm just here for napkins, sis. I said the tacos were better and she has the nerve to tell me that the enchiladas just ""weren't what I expected."" You know what? You're absolutely right. I expected them to be fucking edible.
That's it, I'm done ranting. I'd only eat here again if I was starving and broke down on campus with no gas in my car and that's probably pushing it.",uzUVjzYRFZhTLJ5IxNSbUg,0,0,1,mrcH3eRWc_CXS-hNoDw-XQ
5871391,2012-12-13,0,vZafOAECfChenbQjhlZQlA,"This place is just terrible. Maria and her crew are all very polite but Maria is extremely money hungry. She'll charge you a dollar for a small amount of guacamole. That's another thing, the quality of their food is AWFUL! They charge more than Roberto's for the same exact thing, and it's DISGUSTING. I'm not sure if its because they prepare the food now here, at CSN, or what, but the food is just a huge let down and the price is just ridiculous. Which is unfortunate. Obviously, we're all poor, college students. I can't afford to shell out 8 dollars for a meal that's just going to give me diarrhea later.",OLXQbtFoIMob7kDr6AL0ZA,1,1,1,cY5e_DwQ3lxzVj7h38ZI2g
