Clocks everywhere but don't tell time so it's easy to lose yourself in the moment. Mix and match chairs but compliment each other perfectly...and most important,comfortable. We had the Batista come to our table to answer our questions and explain each coffee drink on their menu...and brought our drinks out himself. We were there for breakfast one day and lunch another. Food has great presentation and excellent flavor. I only wish there were more options to the breakfast menu but I was able to find something I enjoyed from what was on the menu that day. The service was great as well. As a local I can recommend to my family and friends. I hope tourists that visit us in Vegas will come and engoy this gem as well.

They seem to go back and forth between a bunch of different ideas. Are they a gourmet coffee shop? A fine dining restaurant? A diner? They need to settle on one thing at least until they become good at it since bouncing all over the place and doing a little bit of everything but being mediocre at all of it.

I initially popped in for coffee, surprised to see a variety of specialty beverages. My Islander Latte (with rich coconut flavor!) was impressive enough to prompt me to order food. The Texas Scramble was tasty with marinated roma tomatoes, onions, and mushrooms, served with perfectly-crispy potatoes. My guy's Belgian waffle with fresh fruit was flawless.

I returned for lunch, and was thrown off by the Mediterranean menu of kabob plates and appetizers. I ordered a trio of snacks and was pleasantly surprised by the chicken-potato salad (similar to a Russian oliviet), a fresh Shirazi salad, and a savory eggplant-garlic dip, all served with plenty of pita.

We had a get together to In my moms honor, on the 5th anniversary of her passing. The experience was perfect! 

The manager took the time on his day off, to meet with us prior to the event. He was able to give us great suggestions to set up the food. He went above and beyond to make everything perfect for us. 

The ambiance was very nice. The decorations make you feel like you're inside a coffee shop in Europe. 

They provide a wide variety of coffee and tea, as well as a very diverse menu.

The quality and taste of the food was First Class. 

The service was good. The only thing I'd have suggested, is instead of just dropping off pitchers of water, he should have taken drink orders.

The price is very reasonable, if everyone in our party would have ordered a couple appetizers, main course, drinks, dessert, and a coffee or tea, it could have easily been double from what we were charged.

Next we had the pita and hummus song with the salad shirazi! They give you plenty of pita to go with their delicious hummus. The salad was very flavorful. My husband normally doesn't eat cucumbers and he dipped in the bowl a few times. 

I ordered the chicken barg. The chicken was very tender. I barely needed a knife to cut it. Cooked thoroughly and great flavor. My husband ordered the Barg and it was very tender and juicy. Not over cooked, not under cooked.

And if you take the time to look around at the decor you'll find yourself transported to a place that seems like the perfect setting for a book. Turns out, you wouldn't be too far off your mark.

As I enjoyed my amazing meal recommend by the waiter I found myself at a bit of a loss. The decorations held much more character than I usually experience. And then for no apparent reason my eye would catch on random, seemingly out of place, objects. Well, in some cases, radically out of place objects. As I ate in wonder I couldn't help but ask my waiter what this and that object was, because there was no way it was done by accident. To my absolute delight I discovered it most certainly was not an accident. Turns out that this very restaurant is going to be the back drop to a new TV series soon to be aired. The title of the series shares that with the name of the restaurant. This turned my meal into an immediate adventure.

Not only that, but you'll find a most accommodating staff. Thus restaurant just opened so take advantage of it while you can. Enjoy a good meal and check out their wide variety of coffee.

Okay, heres the deal.. I went to this place on recommendation of another business, as i was looking for a location to hold monthly meetings. I was looking both on behalf of a Fortune 100 company as well as a local 501C3..
I saw their facebook page, and thought the restaurant looked rather inviting.

Our business associate planned to meet us there and alerted the manager to our meeting. 

We arrive at 9am

EMPTY.  We thought they were closed...

At first impression, the  restaurant is warm, inviting and very eclectic..
So we had high hopes. 

That was the end of the positive experience. The manager had stepped out... And was not there  for our meeting. She showed up later.

The service.. Very slow.. The wait staff are novices that probably have never served before.. Ever. They couldn't get orders right, as they didn't listen attentively. This was an ongoing issue.
After a considerable amount of time, out comes 3 of 4 orders. We wait...
And wait. Order 4 comes out wrong.. And is sent back.. We wait.
It comes out, and is still wrong. All the food is cold.
I ordered  a cheese bacon and sausage omelette, side of crispy bacon.
I got an overcooked egg "" pancake "" folder over with undercooked bacon
And sausage, no cheese. The crisp side of bacon was limp and undercooked.
Its as if this was the cooks first gig ever after graduating automotive school.  AND  they said HE is going to train the new cook.

If you go for ONLY coffee and a nice atmosphere, you might be OK. Its hard to screw up coffee.. But then again..
They an to open at night as a "" Persian "" restaurant. Maybe they will fare better although they have an identity crisis. I will never know as i don't plan to repeat the experience..  You can have a more satisfying experience  with  an egg McMuffin at MacDonalds.. 

The manager finally showed up for the meeting and talked to us as our food turned cold..where is the quality control ?

As I wrote on the beginning.. They are new.. So if they get their act together as a wait staff, find a good cook, get some semblance of quality control at the pass, it may turn out to be a viable spot.

There is one review I read that was a 1 Star.. That guy was dead-on right.
I would question the validity of the other reviews.
So D Coffee Shop. 
WE will not be bringing business to you. We shared a lot of ideas, and I did tell you 1 Star in person..please take the feedback, otherwise your restaurant will join the others in that area to shutter quickly.",x-WX7YV_2HQU_IL4hGIrPw,13,0,1,vc58C2UCJAfSB9BlMXI3Cg

They don't deserve but Yelp gave me no choice to hit only one star.  Anyways, we went to eat here because the sign says it is the ""best kabob"".  The only problem about the sign outside is that their sign is completely wrong and I cannot believe they will make this claim about their food.  I'm sure the coffee is better but me and my wife did not try the other food or drinks.  How can you suggest to recook the beef kabob if they didn't cook throughly?  They did take one of the kabob off the bill but we just paid and left, because this is ridiculous business.  I would read reviews of people who have went there before going here, because you would not want to go here for sure.  We left to a different restaurant that has ""The Best Kabobs"" in Las Vegas.  I'm sure if you been there you would know their name and location.  Otherwise of you don't know the place and never been stay away from here.  Message me for the name of that Best Kabob place to save your money, time and stomach from aching later on.  I would suggest they go another restaurant to take their business or close down the food area.  But this is the choice of the business and that's my opinion.

5572440,2016-01-11,4,G54fcIaoI89tc6X285suRA,"Severely disappointing. 

First off, let me start by saying that we should have turned around upon spotting their 'B' rating from the health inspector. 

The decor can only be described as unnecessary and tryhard. It looks as if a middle aged rich housewife had some sort of crisis and decided to open a business. But we decided to put the decor on the back burner because why judge a restaurant on decor alone? 

The food is a different story. I'm incredibly confused at the number of positive reviews of this place. 

I ordered an iced coffee and my partner ordered the house brew. My iced coffee tasted like it was sitting in the back of a dirty fridge for a few days and the house brew just tasted like burned gas station coffee. Also, I'm pretty sure the creamer they used was off. 

The soup came about 35 minutes after we ordered. It was bland and tasted almost like a canned soup. I'm not actually sure what the soup I received was called, because our server wasn't actually the server, but the barista. 

Almost 40 minutes after the soup was served, our meal showed up. I ordered the ham and Swiss sandwich and my partner ordered the pasta primavera. My sandwich was literally a cheap store bought hamburger bun, one slice of Swiss cheese, and some prepackaged lunch meat. Also my sandwich was COLD?! 

My partners meal was just as disappointing. The vegetables for the primavera were absolutely the same frozen, bagged kind that you receive in hospital meals. The pasta was severely undercooked, cold and the sauce had absolutely no seasoning whatsoever. 

Ultimately, I will never set foot in this place again. It's insulting that this place would charge these prices for a hospital or school quality lunch. Honestly, the name of the place should have warned me. ""D'coffee shop"" really? How stupid.",2iM9yEE2rdkaifZEtc8_Rw,12,2,1,ilEs_frbELGlbxzB8B4hfg

Between the poor ambience and food quality, this place is surely losing money and will be out of business soon.",W4Qg9-8PAojxB4oDpBMRTA,3,0,1,dmc0v7RBNAbE4WQMjWMdeA

I love the theme and look and just the vine of the whole cafe as well was the food is AWSOME and very reasonable. My waiter was so great as well, she talked to us and gave us advice and motivated us to never give up and keep pushing an to never listen to what others say. She felt like a really good friend that I haven't seen in Forever by the way she was talking she was great and so friendly!",-FAUTkaAa5s4mN5sVel1yA,1,1,5,UXdxSNTkW-8zZVonlK1Lsw
