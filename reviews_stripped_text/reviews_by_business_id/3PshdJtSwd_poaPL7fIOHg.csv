Gone are the chimmichurri wraps, quinoa and tabouli dishes, no more are the vegetable pastas. You can pick burgers, flatbread pizzas, or pulled pork. They're not bad, but I can throw a rock and hit four more places to get those foods.

Additional star removed because they can't seem to keep their own hours- out of four attempts to visit, they've been open once during their posted hours. The fried zucchini is about the only option left that is at all interesting left on the menu, and even that's not actually healthy at all.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,3,2,2,cMm91RL7RYtRCO5PirJs6Q

Healthy? No..
Delicious? Absolutely!!

I have had their burger on several occasions, and it is truly delicious! 
This exceeds all burgers that I have had..maybe even my own. 
They definitely do not skimp on the meat! The patty has to be at least a half inch thick!

I just tried their special, BBQ pulled pork and onion ring combo and let me tell you.. it was beyond exceptional!

Make it a point to visit them at least once and I promise, you'll be hooked. 
They do have odd hours, I believe Mon - Thurs 11:30 - 4:30.. so don't expect a late dinner..lol.",r_cOJxTxaSTJx73HWDnYwQ,0,0,5,VC33nfEexz7IJWAsIkBUww

I was so sad though because it was after 12 and it was closed. Frowny face. BUT, when my friend arrived, very fashionably late, 27 minutes to be exact, it was OPEN!. WOOOO HOOO!!!!

I decided on two things: the spicy apricot quinoa and the cherry tabulah.  The owner asked if I wanted the quinoa hot or cold...interesting....How do YOU take it. She said she liked both so I asked if I could get half hot and half cold. She said no problem.

The cherry tabulah was outstanding. Dried cherries, not couscous but buckwheat berries or something, fennel, raw cauliflower (personally, I think they should have been blanched a bit but still delicious)  cherry pomegranate dressing. OMFG! So damn good. I will be back for that NO DOUBT!
The spicy apricot quinoa was delicious too. So flavorful and tasty with just the right amount of spice to kick it up a notch!

My friend ordered the no preservtive, all beef angus hotdog and he really enjoyed it.

This place is amazing and I hope she's here to stay. I will be back. Probably next week. I want the zucchini lasagna.

If you like delicious, good food, and a very decent price, this is it!",8OeTLey-p-WaL9ErNEci1Q,2,1,4,kFklQrIP25h8UTHRZL3p9g
3985849,2013-04-11,0,3PshdJtSwd_poaPL7fIOHg,"I have finally eaten enough menu items that I can write a decent review!

I have tried the following and will order them all again: Spicy Apricot Quinoa, Zucchini Lasagna, Chicken Chimichurri Wrap, and the Loaded Oatmeal Cookie.

The first time I tried their food was at the CMYE: Reverse Spring Break At Campus Commons.  I knew, from this event, that I was going to be eating much more of this healthy & delicious food.

I have promised myself that I will order something different, next time I make it to the Campus Commons food court, but the Spicy Apricot Quinoa calls to me.  I already miss it; like an old friend.  It is a blend of spice, sweet, light aromatics, and properly cooked quinoa.  I once said,""I could have eaten buckets.""  As of now, I think I have!

The Zucchini Lasagna (w/ red wine marinara) was such a great take on traditional lasagna, I didn't even miss the pasta. The cheese, veggies (zucchini, roasted red peppers, spinach, & mushrooms), and sauce were done so well with nothing being over-powering.  I may try it again with meat sauce, but I am not sure, because it seems self-defeating in a veggie dish.

The newest item I tried was the  Chicken Chimichurri Wrap.  Very straight forward and tasty.  The sauce is a mixture of a spicy red sauce & chimichurri.  Fair warning to those sensitive to heat: this item is fairlyy hot (5/6 out of 10 on my random heat scale).  Though I liked it and it was tasty, it was a 3 ingredient dish, chicken, wrap, & sauce.  It was served with a few little, whole pickles on the side.  I think the flavor of the pickles actually masked the flavor of the wrap, so I didn't eat them all.

Lastly, the loaded oatmeal cookie and loaded it is! Chocolate, cherries, coconut, & seeds fortify the standard oatmeal.  There's lots going on in this cookie and one of the best cookies I have had lately.

The speed of food isn't supremely quick, but I don't have a problem because of the high food quality.  My last order took nearly 10 minutes; the chicken wrap & quinoa.  Prices are reasonable, but not exactly cheap.  For me, the bottom line is flavor & the healthiness of the food.  If this is eating healthy, then why can't everyone else do it this well?!?",K2-KRkqecWxmwqPHQWVZbA,1,0,4,kxFy_o1be7QcfwNenqs-1g
5651067,2014-08-22,1,3PshdJtSwd_poaPL7fIOHg,"You can find this restaurant in a food court right next to CSN Charleston. I wanted to give this place out a try after the owner put their weekly special: Bourbon BBQ Pulled Pork Sandwich with onion rings and soda/water for $8. Pretty good deal if you ask me! The food took awhile but that's because it was made to order, plus the wait was well worth it if you ask me! 

This is definitely THE BEST Bourbon BBQ sandwich I've ever had! It was so juicy and tender. It wasn't hard to chew. And it was exceptionally flavorful! It was very delicious! The onion rings were perfect as well. It wasn't disgustingly oily or anything. I also tried the triple chocolate brownie.. BEST brownie I've ever tasted. I'm the biggest chocolate lover, and this is definitely my FAVORITE brownie! 

I would definitely recommend others to give this place a try! It's a new menu with new food! You won't be disappointed!",O8BcJ8S4JwHHZWnx3Asd1A,1,1,5,hcM8SeNwcSitX-tAEWLZAg
5676840,2015-06-11,0,3PshdJtSwd_poaPL7fIOHg,"A big step above fast food! We both had the pulled pork sandwiches. The pork is very flavorfully smoked from lean cuts not a packaged or processed product, so there is no fat or grease, but it's not dry either. The portion size is quite generous. I'm a fan!",IIumEd4NKdw9Iglfx6NjWA,0,0,5,9uxOLPCsunvR3QdISeWo_w
