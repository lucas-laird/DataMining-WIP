2208,2016-03-23,0,6nbPXEjmBnDtsgM_YNwGjw,I called in for a take-out order. The staff was super friendly.  They were completely accommodating as I continually adjusted my order. The food was completely off the charts delicious. Hands down the best Ahi Poke in the valley. The Furikake Chicken is absolutely amazing!  The portions are big and the flavors are wonderful.

The poke (we got the Avo Poke) was the best I've ever had--and I'm a huge poke fan. The furikake chicken was delicious; it was crispy with tons of furikake flavor. The beef teriyaki was tender and perfectly cooked.
We also got the chicken katsu, kalua pork, shrimp, & the Korean chicken, which were all good but not as tasty as the other ones. 

The service was friendly & helpful. The inside was small & clean. We will definitely be back :)",OT5pvCbmi02lwWrfwFxrFQ,1,0,5,63cZHtUuqczss2JpDxIgFQ

470761,2017-06-10,0,6nbPXEjmBnDtsgM_YNwGjw,"The ambiance of Island Flavor Express was about what you can expect from an establishment with the word ""Express"" in it. The casual Hawaiian restaurant is a quiet hole-in-the-wall in a strip mall off the 215 and Eastern Ave. As soon as you walk in the door, you are engulfed in the distinct scent of steamed rice, grilling meat, and soy. The dining area, which is quite small, as they do mostly to-go and catering orders, is not much to look at. The tables, chairs, and flooring all look dilapidated and in need of repair or replacement, though everything is clean and organized. The environment is overall welcoming, as the manager personally greets each customer and seemed to immediately know when it was someone's first time (a sure sign of a loyal customer-base!). 

Despite its humble appearance, the food was fantastic! The restaurant, both the dining and cooking areas, appeared clean. Though the kitchen was open to the dining area, there was not too much kitchen noise that it disrupted conversation. Besides the great food, the aroma is the next best thing I remember after walking in - the perfect combination of sweet and salty married with delicious grilled meats. I was also astonished at the portion that is served in one of their platters, which costs just $9. Not only does the meat of your choice come with two sides, but it comes with enough meat to easily feed two to three people. It was a fantastic value!

Not only was the food excellent, but the service was decent as well. Both the service staff and the kitchen staff had good attitudes and greeted people as they entered. The manager, who was serving as well, was very warm and attentive. The service was both authentic and efficient, and the staff all appeared tidy and well-groomed. The restaurant did seem well-staffed, as there was little wait time, though it was not very busy when I was there, and with increased volume, additional servers may be a good idea to keep up with their service standards.  Overall, I was very pleased with the food & service I experienced here.",3SzM4RfCh9M29CS4virbEg,1,1,5,cWkNNnTKfrRw1H424wW6Ww

961464,2015-12-02,0,6nbPXEjmBnDtsgM_YNwGjw,"This is my new go-to when I am in town for business.  Being from Hawaii and living in Houston, coming to the Vegas area serves one purpose for me: Hawaiian grinds.  A lot of Hawaiian places do not take AmEx, which is fine but I would rather use my company card when on the road.  It's not a deal maker or breaker for me, but it instantly gives them at least half a star for my purposes.

The food is so ono!  Last night I ordered the mixed plate with katsu and kalbi.  The mac salad is legit.  The chicken katsu was moist, which is rare for a thin cut like that.  The kalbi was delicious!  The rice was perfectly cooked.  It's the best Hawaiian food I've had since leaving Pearl City.

The decor is nothing fancy... as it should be.  The Jawaiian music is playing.  The people are nice and take the time to learn the names of their customers.  This place just feels like home.

I am going back for lunch today since I have to leave tomorrow.  This place will definitely be on my ""must eat at"" list whenever I am in town.  Mahalo!!",IACko8JfwHg-h6MZsaHmeQ,4,2,5,w_S_5seDH5CyWFofOkMqJA

Please take this as constructive criticism, and not a negative comment.

I ordered the Teri Beef with Stir fry, it was very tasty but the stir fry really didn't have much vegetables. Maybe putting a little more onions, some bell peppers and some mushrooms would bring it up to another level.

My wife got the Shrimp Scampi. We were not aware that it was shrimp with rice. we were expecting shrimp with pasta. Suggest letting customers know it doesn't come with pasta. Also the taste really wasn't there. I couldn't put my finger on on what was missing. but as a suggestion, maybe a little more garlic/butter and maybe with some olive oil and not cook as long as the shrimp was really overcooked.

We would like to come back and support local businesses from the 808 as that's where we moved here from.

teri beef:  a solid bit too salty. and even though cut properly (against the grain), still tough.
macaroni salad: sadly, it was served super cold! couldn't taste it.  i think they need to turn that fridge down a few degrees! then again, if you're doing take out, that thing is the perfect temperature by the time you get home.
poke--was ok this visit. got the hawaii one with limu.

friendly service, lots of local people hanging out. i wish they could have someone bring them a BIB of the real strawberry flavored fruit punch from the islands instead of the tropicana version. i like the fanta syrup, but it's easy to get the big box at restaurant supply places--they're even near the airport. :)  i'd be happy to volunteer to bring you guys a box next time i have to bring checked luggage anyway. or maybe LV coke distributor can nab some for you guys. :)",9M8PtXcHhP5y4wgcR_Iv8w,1,0,3,tpM_L8I9gqpAOT1hJT9x2A

1513544,2015-11-21,4,6nbPXEjmBnDtsgM_YNwGjw,"I haven't written a review in awhile...but, I felt obligated after trying Island Flavor for the first time. Located right off the 215 and Eastern in the Regal Plaza, right next to the PT's (the old Roadrunner bar, for those who remember that place). I had heard good things about this Hawaiian (excuse me, big island) style plate lunch spot. I had the day off, so I thought I would give it go...

First off, very small place, maybe 5 bistro style table seating to one side and the kitchen on the other side. Love the Hawaiian/Reggae music selection playing ( does anyone still call it Jahwaiian?). Decor is what you would expect, pictures of Hawaiian flowers and foliage and a representation of all the islands on the wall...but, hey, not here for decor, here for the foods.

They have a small specialized menu and daily specials board (all sounded good to me...), but I opted for the mix plate w/ the Furikake Chicken everyone's raving about and Roast Pork with gravy ($11.25). Ordered to go...when the chef called my name and handed me my plate lunch bagged up, he gave me one of those ""what's up bruddah"" chin nods. Like he knew what deliciousness I was in store for. I grabbed for my bag of food, and I swear the thing weighed like at least 5 lbs.! He noticed the surprised look on my face and smiled, I mustered a ""thanks bruddah"" and headed home.

In anticipation, I popped open my styrofoam container and...boom! Huge, I mean, HUGE portion of the chicken ( I think I might've actually gasped). For the unbelievers, see photo... Now I know what all the hype was about, the Furikake Chicken was super ono. Crunchy fried chicken nuggets of love, rolled in a honey sweet sauce and salty seaweed,bonito flakes with sesame seeds...sweet and savory, how I likes it. If I had to reminisce, I would say it kinda reminded me of the ""Tasty"" Chicken they serve at the Alley in the Aiea Bowl in Hawaii ( if you're from Aiea, you know what I'm talking about). The Roast Pork was tender and juicy, it just fell apart as I dug into it. Good gravy! The gravy was good...and the Mac salad was legit. I think there was an audible ""oh my god this is good!"" As I was nom-nomming away.

So, yeah...that happened. So delicious, but couldn't finish it...leftovers, yay! Island Flavor, thumbs up and shakas!!! will definitely be back, maybe give it the fifth star",rkZ_FQ1yWxPOm3JCv_wKwQ,6,5,4,hFK_6L6mniGrCQ3XMe93yA

You'll notice here at Island Flavor that it's double, but man oh man when you get that Kalbi on your table and you open it up, you'll notice the difference. Very thick and just tender enough where you can easily bite and break it down as you chew. Juicy and the marinade they use just tastes so good.

1652512,2016-12-10,11,6nbPXEjmBnDtsgM_YNwGjw,"On my last foray to Las Vegas, I was mindful I had review number 200 waiting to be written, and I wanted number 200 to be something sexy. After making my way through every nook and cranny of the strip and beyond, I found myself sitting at a tall table in Island Flavor and greatly anticipating my lunch. 

We ordered Chicken Katsu and Teriyaki Chicken plates with the requisite sides of white rice (which comes in two scoops) and macaroni salad. When the food arrived (with a broad smile from the cashier/server/greeter), I was impressed with the size of the meal. As is typical of Hawaiian food, there always seems to be too much for an average sized person to consume. Since I was lodged in a hotel, I was forced (not really) to man-up and eat it all. 

My Teriyaki Chicken had three generous slabs of tender chicken (with a nice outer sear), which were well marinaded and seasoned. I think there was also a hint of smoke on the meat, which was a nice touch. The mac and rice were standard. The Chicken Katsu had a nice exterior crunch. Put it all together, at a value price and served in an unpretentious atmosphere, and you have an ALOHA BOMB of a meal. 

Unfortunately, as hard as I tried to look for a back story to go along with this review, I struck out. Nothing colorful and nothing sexy to add ""Flavor"" to this review, but since Island Flavor is more about the food than anything else, the lack of fluff seems ever so appropriate. 

FOR THE RECORD

I will go on record by saying my meal at Island Flavor was more pleasing to me than any other meal I had in Las Vegas on this trip (and that includes spending over a couple of C-notes for a fancy steak dinner). 

If you're in the area and you have a hankering for a good hearty Hawaiian meal, stop by Island Flavor and check them out. Aloha!",Sdai6ywiZCa7q46ghuoVYQ,17,16,4,Dm7fnUduLO10SSNWpc7Qyw

I've been to the Island Flavor out in Durango a few years ago and I liked it then. I've obviously forgotten how good it was, but now very glad that they've opened this one on Eastern!

Kind of dangerous that it's near by LVAC (gym we go to) because it's an easy ""postworkout"" place!

Things we ordered :
Loco Moco - Juicy, thick, beef patty over rice, topped with eggs (cooked in your way), drizzled with brown gravy!

Furikake Chicken - The Hawaiian version of orange chicken? Chunky, chicken chunks, fried then tossed in this salty sweet sauce! SO GOOD!

Yakisoba with Teri Chicken - Pan friend noodles with veggies, BBQ pork, eggs, onions, and of course grilled teriyaki chicken! Great comfort food!

Their Mac Salad is also amazing, comes with most of the plates!

BIG PORTIONS, might be a good a idea to share plates!

Island Flavor definitely has that authentic taste in their dishes, service is fast and staff are nice and attentive!

A minus in my part would be the tall tables and one regular table. I'm 4'9'' so it was a little difficult going back and forth from the drink machine to table, also making sure my little one didn't move to much so he wouldn't fall (not kid friendly)!

Literally the best Hawaiian food in vegas. I always get the Teri beef, my gf gets the kalbi ribs. They use the most quality meat I've ever tasted at any Hawaiian BBQ place. The Teri beef plate is like a giant steak cut up into thick cutlets. It's enough for 2 meals. One now and one later :D

People who lived in Hawaii are blessed that Vegas is the 9th island. You don't have to go far to get some Island grinds. The newest addition to Henderson is located in the shopping area on Eastern Ave & Pebble. 

Same owners as Island Flavor on Durango, they are a casual place-order/pick-up order or take-out service style restaurant. The staff has been incredibly friendly on each visit and the place is clean and simple, with about 6 tables inside. 

Food I've ordered:

Furikake Ahi Poke
Hawaiian-Style Poke
Kalbi Ribs
Furikake Chicken & Shrimp

Furikake Chicken - Let's cut to the chase. I don't even eat chicken. The batter and glaze they use is insane, I couldn't help but try a few pieces that were just crumb batter. OMG. Sweet and salty deliciousness! My boyfriend and toddler loved it, too. I tried the shrimp version, and they over-fried it, so I wasn't as happy with it. 

Poke - The portion they give are great. The fish is cubed into good sizes. However, I can't say it's the best I've had. The fish tastes good, but I prefer the poke to have been marinated longer. Melt-in-your-mouth kind of poke...

Kalbi - Ridiculous portion and the meat is tender! Look at the posted pictures below.

Desserts - They have a rotating selection found in the fridge by the door, so you can self-serve and take it to the counter. I have yet to try any, but I've seen Chantilly, Haupia, Guava Chiffon, and Coco Puffs. They also stock Hawaiian Sun canned drinks.

Look at their chalkboard for their daily specials. They serve Lau Lau on Fridays and I've seen Mahi Mahi and Kalua Pig posted, too.

This has become one of those regular stops I'll make when I want some quick but tasty Hawaiian eats for the family. I'd love it if they could start serving oxtail soup and malasadas! That's the only thing I can say they are missing. But I'd highly recommend stopping by if you're hungry in Hendertucky!",q9jCDNZDRUYl2Pwlgxocig,22,16,4,KTbLuy8GJ0Yk_NPYYc0xOw

I wish their portions for the macaroni salad was bigger!

The short ribs were delicious, flavorful and had great char marks.

Also had the guava cake, the cake itself and the guava jam is really good. Not overly sweet and the guava flavor is noticeable. I just was not a fan of the cool whip frosting. I love real whipped cream. Will probably stick with the Furikake Chicken only, for next time!

The sauce really enjoyed! They do put lot of sauce but then again everything here is huge including the sauce. I literally had half my two scoops of rice soaked in it. In good way.  I got some Poke action. I got the Hawaiian Style Poke Half Order. It was good. The quality of the tuna was solid, the sauce was ok, and best part was the limu. It been long time since had some.

Bruce and Maili no longer are the owners of this business and now its owned by Viaggio-Vita-llc, a haole owned company.  Not knocking the new owners but the food quality has gone down and the taste is no longer the same.  A lot of the old time workers are no longer here and the Hawaiian music is gone, maybe forever.   A lot of new young servers are now working here which is good because they still bring the Hawaiian Mana.  Sad to say but because of changes in taste and quality of the food don't think we'll be coming back anytime soon.  Need to find another good Hawaiian restaurant again. Even the fast food outlet on Eastern was sold to the same guys that bought the original store.  SAD.  Good luck to Bruce and Maili and thanks for the wonderful years of dining experience.. Aloha oe.  One thing I've noticed is the new cooks working here.  I don't think they have the experience of Island cooking at all and our order was totally screwed.  Grand daughters spam rice came really late, and our poke didn't show up till we asked what happened.  Heard the cooks telling the servers not to ask for the food because they were backed up on orders, never seen or heard that before.  Wow what a disgraceful action from the kitchen.

First off, the poke and the way it's cut is definitely how traditional poke should be. It was seasoned really well, close to perfection, however, this time around the seasoning was a little bit more salty than what I remembered. Still better than any poke place in California that claims to have traditional Hawaiian poke (besides North Shore, which is really close to traditional), however, as I said, it was a little bit too salty this time around. Next, is the Furikake Chicken, which is definitely something myself and my girlfriend every single time we visit Las Vegas. The crispiness of the chicken was really good, and it seemed this time they added more sauce, which I absolutely loved! For me it was very flavorful, and mixed with the warm rice they served along with it gave it a nice balance of heat and flavors in my mouth.

I'm a creature of habit and tend to get this every time I go, but it's just too delicious to try something else! The poke is great too! The fish is cut into perfect sized cubes and it's always fresh.

But I dont think I can rave about it if the trend continues, it will just be one of the many options available and not really stand out from the rest.",VwtocvViCk7kx8JMvOVciQ,0,0,3,8Al9lLA3mAj_8dqUbkAOaw

2698474,2015-10-28,0,6nbPXEjmBnDtsgM_YNwGjw,"I'm in love with the saturation of Hawaiian restaurants in the Las Vegas area (of which the East coast surely misses out on) and another welcome addition is Island Flavor.  The prices are slightly higher than some of its competitors but the quantity and good flavor surely makes up for that.

There are quite a few options of fresh ahi tuna poke here.  I ordered 1/2 a pound of Hawaiian style poke.  The cuts of tuna they used were very large and quite fresh.  It was marinated in a soy and chili flake sauce with some minced onions thrown in the mix.  Pretty good option for poke in my area.

The mixed plate we ordered was fairly good as well.  Furikake chicken was spot on, kind of like crispy orange chicken but with more flavor from the furikake seasoning.  The kalbi short ribs ($1.00 more) were good and came as 2 huge pieces of meat.   There's quite a bit of fat on edges which I did not eat and one of our meats came out a little more red on the inside than my wife likes to eat.  Luckily, I have no problem with that.

I've glanced over some of the breakfast options and saw the Portuguese sausage and eggs at over $8.    That's $3 more than I'm used to for a standard breakfast option.  I decided to get a side of the Portuguese sausage but they were considerably smaller and not as good as my go to spot for Portuguese sausage (Aloha Kitchen next to UNLV for those wondering-amazing).

For the closest location with good poke and friendly service, I'll definitely keep Island Flavor in mind.  Truly a good mixed plate with plenty of left overs for a second meal.",Mho2GibREwsPesKEyQbt8w,3,2,4,o2Q1-7iMMW4ksxgSXIEXlQ

Look at all my pictures, and you'll see what I'm talking about. 

Short ribs: waaaaaaay too much fat. After eating just 1 short rib, I had a big pile of fat sitting on a napkin. And nibbling on the bones is usually my favorite part about short ribs. I couldn't do it with these because I refuse to eat pure fat.

Furikake chicken: the majority of the serving was the crumbs/breading. There were only a few big pieces of chicken. 

Korean short ribs: mushy and all breading. 

Don't get me wrong, the flavoring of the short ribs and furikake chicken were good, but the execution was a huge disappointment. Sometimes trying new places isn't always a good thing.",BI4jBJVto2tEQ0NiaR0rNQ,10,5,2,qhoiRv-Dar0gVJL2t7_uWw

Anyway, the last time I came in, there were 3 women up at the seating area. I had ordered to go.

The flavor of the furikake really shined through and paired with rice in each bite, it was a great balance of flavor between the taste of the chicken protein, the furikake and the sauce on the food. I can't even begin to tell you how massive the adobo friend rice was too. I was not expecting anything as huge as what we got. My husband and I picked up food from here before heading to the airport.

Such a great spot for a quick bite, that way you can get back to instagramming food-stuffs and checking the Netflix library. I was doing all of the above while I waited for my food. 

I went with Hamburger Steak, a 10 oz. patty broiled and topped with mushrooms, onions, and brown gravy. This is a tasty Hawaiian standard; the hamburger was juicy, the onions were still snappy and the brown sauce coated everything.

Every time I come to Las Vegas, I actually get excited to eat Island Flavor again. This is their quickie express version with counter service and a few tables. 

First things first: haupia cake. It's perfect in texture, and the haupia flavor is subtle and beautiful. I ate dessert while waiting a few minutes for my plate lunch. (The cream on it isn't particularly special, but the rest of the cake is PERFECT.) 

Next: unless you are Michael Phelps or the god Maui out of the movie Moana, these meals are filling enough for two people to share. Holy hell, there's so much fatty, delicious food that it's surely grave to your health on a regular basis. It's all good quality and done with great flavors. They are on the sweet side, but my favorites are the furikake chicken and short ribs. 

Like Durango's location, the service here is so unbelievably kind that you can't help but wish the whole world could live life like that everyday. (To the lady working today, THANK YOU. So much aloha in your heart that the world must be a better place because you are in it!) 

They have daily specials posted on the wall when you walk in and everything legit Hawaiian on the menu, including all those glorious Pacific Rim fusion meals.

Very busy, but that could have been due to it being Black Friday and many other restaurants were closed. I ordered the miso ahi steaks, perfectly cooked with a tasty sauce and rice, my wife got teriyaki chicken, also very good. The staff was friendly and even attentive, unexpected, considering it was more of a fast food atmosphere. Both meals together cost about $20.

I actually prefer this location over the Durango one.  I know they're supposed to be the same, but I think get bigger servings here.  Island Flavor has huge portions and their prices can't be beat.  The only item that I have ever had at this location is their Loco Moco.  In my opinion, Island Flavor has the best Loco Moco in Las Vegas.

4107181,2015-11-10,7,6nbPXEjmBnDtsgM_YNwGjw,"I expected a really mindblowing experience after all the hype around the original location and the positive comparisons drawn between the two, but the Eastern outpost of this restaurant lands merely in the ""really good"" category.

Island Flavor Express is in the Regal Colonnade plaza on Eastern and Pebble, and it's very clearly a Hawaiian restaurant given all the depictions of the islands, reggae/ska music, and typical plate lunch menu options. They also offer varying specials and some desserts, although the desserts seemed to have run out in the waning evening hours. The decor is very simple but doesn't detract from the experience. Make sure to walk to the far end of the counter to place an order, but feel free to sit down if you're not taking it to-go. They'll bring the food out to your counter (or table, if you've picked the one table).

I ordered the mixed plate ($11.25) with Furikake Chicken and Kalbi Short Ribs (+$1.00 for this particular meat). It's presented in a foam to-go box even if you're dining in. My favorite part was actually the macaroni salad, which was salted in a good way, and as creamy as you'd expect. The chicken was kinda like the ""KFC"" at Gen Korean BBQ in a not-so-good way. It has more of a dry, stringy texture than a moist, natural chicken texture, and the furikake didn't stand out as much as the sweet glaze did. Sriracha saved the day though, bestowing a little extra sweetness along with much-needed acidity and heat. I don't like having to add a condiment to make something stand out, but I'm very glad that I had the option.

As for the other parts of the dish, the white rice is cooked perfectly, and the kalbi is a great rendition with tender beef, a nice touch of ginger, and some charring. It's a little on the fatty side, but let's remember that fat = flavor, which was proven in this case. Actually, it has muted sweetness when you eat it after something as sweet as the Furikake Chicken, but I was able to taste the full flavor when I dove into my my leftovers. If I get a mixed plate again with kalbi, I'll probably have to go for something like a pork dish that's not so sweet.

My friend shared a spam musubi ($2) with me. It was a nice-sized portion, but the rice ratio was a bit high for me. Also, the seaweed was a little too mushy, which my friend pointed out may be a side-effect of the heat lamp. Although there are interesting seasonings and herbs in Island Flavor's version, I prefer the Ross J's rendition, which I'm sure is prepped to order.

I also tried my friend's oxtail soup ($10), which actually comes in a real bowl if you're dining in. Unfortunately, I can't compare it to the renowned Hawaiian oxtail soup at that one hotel downtown (because I've yet to try it), but this version tasted well-seasoned and meaty. The vegetables are a welcome sight, but watch out for the not-so-edible ginger and the inedible bay leaf. I'd consider ordering it again, especially now that we're getting soup weather daily, although I might have to make it a to-go order or otherwise bring my own soup spoon to avoid dealing with the inadequate plastic spoons.

Given that the food here is reportedly much the same as OG Island Flavor, I wasn't quite as impressed as I'd hoped. I certainly enjoyed having plenty of leftovers with the huge portions, and I'll definitely come back to try their other proteins and specials (pork chops w/ mushrooms and onions, anyone?), but I expected to experience something ""sublime"" other than the music. Maybe I'll find it in the future.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,10,7,4,1aalnKM5g04D4nHmYk8O2g

The restaurant is more of a take out shop, but there are enough tables/chairs that you'll be able to eat in if you choose. 
Furikake chicken: Imagine orange chicken, but better. The quality of rice here is always a lot better than the other restaurants I go to. The rice is a little closer to the moist flavorful Japanese rice than that dry white stuff they call rice here in America. The macaroni salad is GOOD. I hate to admit it but since Macaroni salad is the one thing you always get at every Hawaiian restaurant, it plays a big part in how I rank my Hawaiian restaurants. The macaroni salad here does not disappoint. Super creamy, super thick, just how I like it. 
Spam musubi: The one here at Island Flavor has furikake in it instead of the usual brown sauce. If you're expecting the sweet sauce flavor that spam musubi usually has, you might be a little disappointed in the one here. 
Katsu chicken: Super thick pieces of katsu! the breading to chicken ratio has to perfect and Island Flavor really gets it down.",8XKSiMpMxgdwI3qjuqmXFg,8,6,4,uV2mOOiFZDsuWyu6Le64WA

Setting: In the regal colonade plaza on pebble, it is right next to a smoke shop and on the side of PT's Ranch. A smaller restaurant but still places to sit and eat. 

Service: Service here is fantastic. I have never received bad service especially from a Hawaiian restaurant. The young lady behind the counter was very engaging and we ended up talking more than I had time to eat haha.

Food: Ok the most important part. The furikake chicken and kalbi are the stars of this show here. Luckily the kalbi is still on point but their signature furikake chicken is different. They over fry and batter their furikake chicken and makes them really hard and crunchy. NO BUENO!!! Cut back on the batter and don't fry them to the point where they're gonna start popping like popcorn. Also AVOID AVOID getting the furikake shrimp, same story as the chicken and they only give you 4 pieces of shrimp.

4352974,2016-02-04,1,6nbPXEjmBnDtsgM_YNwGjw,"I used to go to the other location, and was very happy when they opened this up just down the street from me.  As stated in its name it's island flavor express, so it's a smaller version.  The seating is minimal but there are still a few tables, and the menu is smaller as they occilate some items as specials.  There have been some hits and misses.  One big plus is their fried poke salad.  You order which marinade you want on your poke, I always get shoyu, and I ask them just to sear the cubes of poke as well.  This is a big deal because the other location always over cooked it for me, and here it's perfection.  The salad is about 16, but that is because it comes with a ridiculously large amount of poke.  It's easily a salad for two to three people, except you need more greens actually lol.  I love the purple taro that they put inside so much and the crispy wontons, there is also cucumbers and tomato.  The creamy sesame dressing is totally addicting as well.  I wish they had a half salad order option where they just give half the poke when you are ordering on your own.

The traditional poke uncooked and also in shoyu sadly does not compare to the other location, both times the way it was cut was not not promoting the best mouth feel, and was chewy instead of like butter.  You might as well just go to island sushi and grill down the street since theirs is always on point.

The kalbi is cooked nicely, however for me it was just to salty.  

Each time I have ordered it has been for pick up, they always package it nicely and with a smile, and are more organized than the other location in this respect.  

So basically the only dish I have really loved has been the poke salad, while the other items I am not interested in ordering again.  I give them a solid 3 and hope to raise it in the future. That poke salad is totally a 5 though on its own",XYZw8rWQ0wjMWQChRCU8Hg,1,0,3,YzAm7hnIeCF2Gnm50OyQ5A

4382527,2016-04-16,3,6nbPXEjmBnDtsgM_YNwGjw,"This is my favorite casual Hawaiian restaurant in town so far. 

As soon as we walked in we were warmly greeted by the woman that was taking and delivering orders to customers. She showed us the specials and asked if we had any questions as we reviewed the menu, but she didn't rush us. 

The inside of the restaurant only has about five tables, but is clean and organized. I definitely felt comfortable dining inside the restaurant. 

I had the Mixed Plate with Kalbi Short Ribs & Furikake Shrimp. The Kalbi Short Ribs had great flavor, plenty of meat, and most pieces had more meat than fat. The slight char on each rib was perfect. The Furikake Shrimp had a the perfect amount of breading and the seasoning on the breading had a nice flavor. The white rice  was simple, but well prepared. The macaroni salad was so good! I loved the black pepper taste and the dressing on the macaroni. 

My husband also had a Mixed Plate, but with Chicken Katsu and Kalua Pig & Cabbage. The Chicken Katsu was very tasty with tender chicken and the breading was tasty. The Kalua Pig & Cabbage also had great flavor with tender meat.

Of course I couldn't pass on a piece of Guava cake to take home. Guava is such an underused fruit and I love the guava in this cake. The cake has great flavor and is very moist. 

Both meals had very generous portions of both meat and sides. I see why meals are served in to go containers after seeing the portions. We definitely had a decent amount of leftovers. I like that plastic bags are out to help with taking leftovers home. Prices are reasonable given the portions and quality.",3nIuSCZk5f_2WWYMLN7h3w,8,6,5,Nv6PiLIUupOIgo1LXxDuiA

Kids wanted Musubis for dinner, and some local grinds sounded so ono, so Island Flavor was next on the rotation. And I'm pretty sure the rotation stops here. Look no further for fresh, traditional, island favorites, with fantastic friendly service. We really felt like ohana tonight. 

Kalbi is so tender and succulent, Furikake Chicken is more flavorful than any I've ever had on the mainland, and the Teryaki Chicken... Well let's just say the kids ate almost a whole plate to themselves, and they're damn picky! Hubby says their mac salad rivals mine, and that's saying a lot (and I may have to agree).

Complete with Pass-O-Guava and Lilikoi Hawaiian Suns, this meal was so worth every penny (just bummed we passed on the Haupia cake that we had last time... Next time for sure cause that stuff is like legal crack), I'm positive we will be frequent offenders here!

They were also selling a chantilly guava with huapia cake, which I asked about and the person said it was like a chocolate cake with a yellow something, they personally haven't tried it, but the worker said people like it. May I'll try it next time. Also,  I opted for sauteed veggies instead of the macoroni salad for my first try here.

The Hawaiian plate lunch.  Double carbs (two scoops rice, one scoop mac salad), loads of protein doused in gravy or coated in sticky, sweet teriyaki sauce.  2,000+ kcal, and two days of saturated fat.

I know I'm gonna catch heat from da bruddahs back home, but plate lunch here is better than almost any in Hawaii if you excuse the strange ""mainland"" menu items ie French fries or sautéed veg sub for rice.

Eater Vegas calls it Hawaiian BBQ.  Deeply marinated untrimmed, fatty, shortribs in a soy, sugar, ginger concoction, grilled and served on the bone.   Sweet, juicy, fatty; the burnt bits adding character, pulling the uber flavorful membrane from the bone and chewing it like a dog chews a rawhide, an added bonus.

Their furikake chicken, deep fried nuggets of chicken, heavily coated in flour and doused in a sticky sweet teriyaki sauce with laver and sesame seeds good eats.  Some overcooked, dry and chewy (da sauce taste better on those), larger nuggets moist and juicy.

Solid loco moco and hamburger steak with pan gravy.  Good beef stew made with fatty chunks of well braised beef (not dry and stringy). Huge spam musubi.

Pass  on the katsu, poke (previously frozen fish), fried shrimp, and teriyaki chicken (doused in sauce after being cooked).

Friendly counter service.  Inexpensive with most plate lunches $9 - $10.

Today we got the kalua pig with no cabbage, 1/2 order of ahi poke with avocado and mixed plate with teriyaki chicken and hamburger steak. 

Kalua pig comes with 2 scoops rice and Mac salad which taste great. They use corse ground pepper which makes it have a more peppery taste but I like it. The kalua pig is good. Not to salty, not to smoky, juuuuust right. 

The ahi poke is good and one of my wife's favorites. It has just enough sauce without drowning out the flavor of the fish. 

The mixed plate was great. It also comes with Mac salad and 2 scoops of rice. This is the first time I've had their Teri chicken and I must say that it was sooooo good. The marinade is on point and the grilled flavor kicks it up a notch. I will for sure order that again on its own. The hamburger steak was good. They have one of the best gravy around.

The chicken furikake is battered, deep fried and then glazed in this teriyaki-like sauce.  The batter has a good crunch despite the glaze and it's an addictive dish.  Knowing it's deep fried, I tend to shy away from these types of food, but I can never come to Island Flavor and not order this dish.  

The pulehu ribs has a dry rub versus the kalbi ribs more of a saucy seasoning are both salted heavy.  I always have to order my dish light on the sauce and the chef is more than happy to obliged.  I get an option to have brown rice instead of white rice, and then I replace my mac salad with sautéed vegetables.  This place offers a good medium for me.  Even though I'm having a cheat meal, I still get a dose of my healthier options.  

The kalua pig is smokey, light on the salt, and you can't go wrong with shredded pork.

Sad face!!!

So, I spent a good chunk of today on Yelp researching for places to eat, those that may offer lunch or dinner or daily specials, as well as those that are closed on Mondays. Yeah, I am not afraid to admit I research potential places I might eat at the way some people research and plan their European vacation. But with the WiFi sporadically cutting in and out, which the Cox technician blames on the 2 year old Netgear router, this impromptu query took longer than expected. By the time I narrowed down my list and picked a spot I was already very hungry and is way past the time for a Hobbit's second lunch.

Luckily, Island Flavor Express was just a few minutes drive on surface street without too much traffic.  Finding a parking space was also not that difficult, although I did have to drive to the side of the building to locate a vacant parking spot that is not designated as short term 30 minutes parking.

Upon walking in, I saw their Today's Special and after a quick glance I opted to ordered their Kimchi Fried Rice with Korean Chicken Wings, instead of the Furikake Chicken that helped secured my decision to come here today in the first place.  Yeah, when it comes to food I am fickle like that.  None of that boring 60's diner conversation that either starts or ends with ""have the usual"" for me.

So after a few minutes the lady that took my order dropped off a to go box filled with my Kimchi Fried Rice surrounded my a mob of Korean Chicken Wings (the container was closed). Even without picking it up, I can tell/edumaguess that it was going to be substantial from the soft thud that it made when it made contact with the surface of the table. But I could totally have hallucinated it as a result of the low blood sugar level.  But picking it up only confirmed my 6th sense was not off at all.  How about that :)

The Kimchi Fried Rice also contains pieces of chasu, not just kimchi as one would suspect. It is decent, not the best I've had, but the portion is definitely on the high end of the spectrum for serving size.  The Korean Chicken Wings are cooked nicely, but is not sticky like the ones served at Korean Fried Chicken spots around town. But after awhile the whole meal elevates your sodium level, and as much as I love Hawaiian Sun products with Island grub, a single can is not enough. So plan ahead, buy 2 cans at $1.25 each or get soda from the fountain or water.

I'd totally be back again, hopefully for the Furikake Chicken, in the not too distant future.

Price: 4-5/5. very reasonable for the portions you get.

Parking: 4-5/5. plenty, just might have to walk a bit if the spaces directly out front are not available.

Tastes: 4/5. Nothing fancy, but pretty good and worth coming back for more.",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,9,7,4,WZqJIJNB40wGJhjrhfpLnw
