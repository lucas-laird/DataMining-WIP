The grilled beef short ribs was excellent, as well as the beef carpaccio.  We also enjoyed the fried noodles, spring rolls & pho.  Yummy!  Service was quick & efficient, very pleasant owners & staff!  We would definitely come back! I almost forgot, they have the best home-made coconut, mango & durian ice cream!

The fish was fried just right, was not overcooked and they they did pick the right size for our party of 6. There was even left over fish. We all thought that the fish looked a little small on the plate, but let me tell you, it was kind of deceiving. It was like a never ending fish. Al the veggies were fresh. The shrimp paste wrapped around the sugar cane was also very delicious. We also had the Bo Tai Chanh and it actually came with a very interesting sauce. Fish sauce with wasabi. I'm not a big of the burning in my nose, so I opted not to use the dipping sauce. Without the sauce the the Bo Tai Chanh was still very good. this restaurant also has the 7 beef serving, which i will definitely try next time. The service was attentive and they made sure we had enough wrappers for our spring rolls and that our glasses were filled. It's nice to find a Vietnamese restaurant that serves all these types of dishes. Usually you find one, but not the other. I think the drive is so worth it to have great food and will definitely come back here when I am in town.",-3jtBudQjQpLzlG-apGc5A,2,1,4,srWgoApjyiFCZ1MmVbxldQ

I would have never thought that one of my top three would be found in a strip mall in Las Vegas, NV, but it is.  I know this is a Vietnamese restaurant, but folks, you REALLY need to try the Korean short ribs at this place.

Had the steamed clams for an appetizer.  Delicious.  I see a few iffy reviews from others on this dish, but with mine, the basil broth did not overpower or detract from the clams by any stretch.

In addition to the kal bi, we had a ginger-onion dungeness crab with their special jalapeno chile sauce.  If you want regular ginger-onion dungeness (in and of itself, yummy), go to Chinatown.  If you want an indescribable flavor explosion, order this.  It's really good.

Best part about this?  It's family-owned by a gentleman and his wife who definitely take pride in providing you with great food at a great value and great service.

I go to Vegas 3 to 4 times a year.  This is a little bit of a drive from the strip (20 to 25 minutes), but definitely worth the visit and one that I will make on a consistent basis.

I became a pho lover about a year ago and have to say I was really happy to find a place near my house so I wouldn't have to go to China Town anymore. With that said the food is really good. I always got pho ga but a friend of mine always got this HUGE dish with egg rolls, some meat, an egg, rice, and other stuff and he loved that also. Speaking for the pho the flavor would vary slightly from visit to visit sometimes being really good (maybe it was a hangover day) to just being good but really people it's pho and you can't really mess it up. 

As for the service. I get what people are saying that they may seem a little impersonal but really people. It's obviously a small family owned place and the people are really nice overall and attentive. It may be that I'm used to it now but I got used to it by my second visit. I think they just expect you to act as family and they will treat you as such so just do what I do... just walk in and seat yourself where ever you like and say hi when they come over quickly and give you a menu. I think most have gotten used to that which is why they are only really awkward during the seating process in which yes they do kind of just stare at you if you stand at the door and wait to be seated.

Pork Chop Shoulders:  Excellent!  It's a big plate of meat and you get some meat sauce and rice with salad.  It's a big plate to be shared with two people.  It's always tender and juicy.

Pho:  Satisfactory.  The conventional Pho.  You can order it in different sizes.  Regular, Large and Family size.  I usually order the Large so I can share it with people.

Egg roll vermicilli Satisfactory:  THis is just a dish with egg rolls and rice noodle and fish sauce.  I like this dish because you get a lot of egg rolls.

When it's the owner who is taking our order, everything is great. She understands us well, gets the oder right, and gets the food to us quickly.  But when it's her staff, it's a whole different experience(one time I could have sworn my order was taken by a twelve year old, and another time it was taken by some really unpleasant and visually irritated man).  We believe that if your main clientele are people who live in the neighborhood, you might want to step up your service standards, because we might not come back.  Especially if there are 2 other Pho places literally down the street.

Anyways, aside from the hit or miss service, we actually really like the place. The dining area is spacious and clean, well-lit and comfortable. The quality of their Pho is great, especially the fresh spring rolls, pho with steak and tripe, and the charbroiled pork bun.  The prices are competitive and they accept most major credit cards, unlike Jenny Pho down the street, who only takes cash.  If you are a fan of Fresh Spring Rolls, try their summer rolls, which is when they substitute the traditional pork with charbroiled pork. Yum!  

All in all, We will still come back, but mainly because the food is great and the location is ideal, considering Spring Mountain is so far away for us in Mountain's Edge.",VizhcyMWWPz3UDXEBeix4w,0,0,3,nahHHJkeaX17qdeCgoWvgg
1620384,2013-01-22,1,ZGXd87vme_dDVYqr-HpRQQ,"This is a review that has been way overdue. 

The first time I dined here was actually 7 months ago when I moved into the area. I thought it was great find a vietnamese restaurant that was close to home and wasn't located in ChinaTown.

I walked in the whole staff was siting down doing their duties like rolling utensils. They seemed confused, debating who should seat us. Our waitress seemed to be more interested with a friend she had dining at the restaurant than us. As she tells her husband to tend to us, she continued to keep talking to her friend. Her husband barely spoke to us and was not at all friendly. We ordered Pho' and the grilled lemongrass beef served with vegetable and rice paper. The Pho' was okay and the grill lemongrass beef was great. Overall my first experience there was horrible.

A few months later I went here again because I didn't want to drive all the way to ChinaTown because of the heavy traffic at the time. My boyfriend and I walked in and was completely ignored. I asked if we should seat ourselves and the husband pointed his finger up in a motion to hold on as he was looking at something on the computer. His wife and staff were siting down doing their duties like last time and none of them assisted us either. He finally sat us, served us water, and said, ""here you go,"" and walked away. As a family walked in, the staff, husband, and wife quickly greeted them. He sat them, served them water, and gave them menus before us. We were completely in shock on how we were getting treated. As the husband, wife, and staff glimpse over at us, they continue to talk for a good minute before he started to work his way to our table to give us menus. I said thank you as he handed us our menus and he said, ""Yeah,"" and walked away to talk to the other table. We had enough and walked out.

Even through the food was okay and it's only 1.0 miles away from home; I would never step foot in here ever again. The service is horrible and the staff seemed to only cater to the people they know. It seems like they would careless about their NEW guests. This place is a joke.

My rating is five stars, and I will explain how I derive that score...

First, they have a great tasting broth that isn't over powering, and is always consistent in flavor. I go to different pho spots, because of the uniqueness of there broths. I come here when I don't want to experiment or take chances with flavor or quality.

Second, I like the location and it's clientele. I live in Summerlin which is really close, and It's a very mixed crowd no matter how you want to dice it up (i.e. race, $$, families, singles, etc). Not a loud place, but you dont have to be quiet. And parking is not a hassle like in Chinatown.

Third, it's a very nice establishment compared to the majority of Pho restaurants. Very clean, airy, sunlit, no odors, and no dirty tables. The servers are courteous, and will help you with the menu. The Owner/Chef  frequently greets guests and suggest things.

On the first day of the New Year, my taste buds were treated to a seven course meal consisting of four beef plates.

Started off with a beef salad with Julian slices of celery, mint, carrots, and daikon.  The textures and flavors were uniquely refreshing.  I can get use to this kind of salad.

The next dish was a chicken and squid combination with a curry pancake thing on top, and the third was a honey glazed quail.  Tasty.

The next three courses were a variation of beef: grilled beef, meatloaf, and paper thin slices of beef in vinegar.  Mmmmm . . . meat.

The final course was a hearty soup with rice and ground beef.  It was the kind of soup that makes you feel good on a cold day when you're not feeling too good.  It was a great way to end the meal.

The food was filling without feeling stuffed, and I'm thankful for the experience.

Put a bit of Siracha and it's perfect. I also really like the Yuka Root with bbq meat and shrimp that you can put into a wrap. The Yuka root is a healthy alternative to the potato with a great texture. 

However, the pho is decent at best and there has been multiple times our pork shoulder has not been cooked all the way. Otherwise, this is also a great dish. I think a little more attention to detail can really bring this place to another level.",JteQGisqOf_pklq7GA0Rww,1,1,3,JU7M5BM-sui5p-QoKke7sg

That seems to be an issue with his take on basil, not the quality of the dish itself.) None of their fried spring rolls were vegetarian, which was a downer.

The atmosphere was pleasant and the size of the place was good and they didn't have the tables jammed in there. The place was clean, and that is a big plus to me.

I would say this is a decent place to come for Pho if you're just jonesin' for it.",_fFpucW8mSKvFJ46zSJCrg,0,0,3,iFzHKafx_lfUPWQfO7oknQ

Who knows how many large bowls of pho I've gone through in the last 12 months, it's definitely more than all my prior years combined, lots of liquid.  

Anyways Bamboo Bistro has grown on me it's not just a pho place they serve more than pho. Their pho is good though I can't tell the difference between good pho and really good pho. I remember it satisfying my cravings each time. They have a decent selection of items to choose from and add to your pho. I enjoyed the pho rare steak, cooked beef, and meat balls.  I also enjoyed the pho rare steak and brisket.  I've haven't tried the oxtail or beef stew yet but that's on my list next. The broth was good, usually I need to load my pho with a lot of sriracha and hoisin but I didn't here, just a little. 

For their non-pho, I've had their grilled pork.  It was a more than generous portion of food and you could probably split it with another person.  It was I think 3 pieces of grilled pork topped with 2 fried eggs, a large scoop of rice, and house salad. I've seen others in the group order the katsu, the tilapia, and the salt and pepper shrimp plates and they were all delicious looking.  Their egg rolls are good also. They make various Asian desserts and drinks.  

It's spacious with a nice flat screen TV on the wall.  Clean with good customer service and they're good with getting large groups in and then out with no problems. Most of their items are under $10 which is always good.",vWP8-aQX0rYJszqkWVL7Ew,3,1,4,oAuOrlPjJ0uyslgAMr3vbg

This restaurant is near Summerlin rather than China town, yet it still attracts many Vietnamese clientele (maybe 50%).  Food is quite authentic - surprising so, since the decor is somewhat  Western (and quite pleasant).  I've traveled in Vietnam, and am always pleased to find the few Vietnamese restaurants in the US that combine both the Vietnamese and French elements of the genre.

I go there at least monthly.  Great for business and social.  Especially try the beef carpaccio and quail appetizers, curry dishes, grilled beef dishes, catfish, and even the pho is surprisingly good.  Healthy food, fresh veggies, good ambiance.

2713290,2010-08-25,0,ZGXd87vme_dDVYqr-HpRQQ,"My first taste of Vietnamese Carpaccio (Raw beef served Vietnamese style) was back in time somewhere in the former 2000s, in Northern California somewhere (Bummer I don't remember the name of the restaurant). I remember loving it so that when I visited Momma in LV, I introduced her to this undercover, off the meny item, and she simply never looked back from that day on... Today, she is a firm believer that Bamboo Bistro has the best Vietnamese Carpaccio in the LV West.

I went to this restaurant with my family, as my mother was craving this Carpaccio that I still hadn't tried, and she had no one to accompany her...

Now I'm more familiar with Vietnamese dirty style restaurants. You know, spots that are ""B"" graded, food that is served rapidly, prices that are unbelievably reasonable. This place is nothing like that. Nothing. No special #1. There is one beef soup combo, others are chicken, or pork, or even Duck soup! Everything was out of the usual viet-price range. Rice dishes at $9, soup bowls starting at $7, vermicelli at $10. ... 

Anywho, I tried this beef carpaccio my mother raved about and was NOT impressed, nor was I disappointed. It was decent in it's own right, but I still haven't seen a carpaccio that's lived up to the one back in Nor Cal (I REALLY wish I remembered that restaurant!). There was a hair on my plate but I let it slide. Then my beef soup came out, and there was a hair in my soup and I did NOT let this one slide. I got another one upon request and adjusted the soup to my own liking -- slathering siracha, chili sauce, basil, bean sprouts, and jalapenos into the mix. Soup was too salty to what I was used to. Pretty unhappy with that.

My mom ordered the pork chop, and that was something Momma and I could agree on. It was HUGE, and it was really delicious. My brother kept hinting that the reason for it's flavor was because it was the fattiest part of the pig, but mother and I had no complaints. 

Verdict: Come here for the pork chop and beef carpaccio. Don't come here for the soup and the viet experience.",zoyb93pskMhDgXZgv-DKtA,0,0,3,2CQab7ebfIzyTbwWoJT0kA

I was going to try the 7 course beef meal, but some of the dishes have peanuts in it, so i opted for a curry dish due to allergy.  Shame, I really wanted to try something different since i have Viet food at least twice a week at home.

- Saigon Curry with Chicken = $17: Not your typical, thick curry, more soupy like Pho.  The only place i found that make curry similar to my mom's but not as spicy.  Still Decent and has good flavor. 
Loaded with bunch of fillers; eggplant, onions, baby corn, asparagus, green string beans, potato and chicken.  Came with a side plate of rice vermicelli.   It's nice that they put the noodles on the side because there's no way in hell you can finish the curry in one sitting..  The serving bowl was also arranged with a candle set-up underneath the bowl to keep soup warm.  Thought that was a nice touch as well.

-My mom ordered her usual; Grilled Short Beef Ribs = $15:  Five (5) thick slice of Korean BBQ style ribs (gal bi), side salad, and a cup of some really clean tasty fluffy white rice.  I was really impress with how much flavor the rib had when fresh.  My mom usually bring leftovers home, so I'd never had a chance to fully experience it.  Pretty darn good ribs, but for 15bucks?  Hmmm..


Service was non-existent.  Water was placed on the table 5min after we ordered.  The curry dish came out first wayy before my mom's ribs did, so i made my mom a small bowl and another for myself.

We seriously kept turning our head and looking for her meal for the next 15-20min.  How do you expect me to enjoy my meal when my mom hasn't even been served her food yet? 
I've actually finished eating before it came out.  Not a good feeling to be honest.  Had I known it would have take that long I should have never started eating regardless if they bring out two empty side bowl for the curry.

We had to flag them down for everything because they never bother to check up on us. I was mortified.  I get it.. I'll grab my own to-go containers, thank you.

Come to find out they simply moved locations! how happy was I! 

I finally got a chance to get over there, I live in Henderson and it's quite a jaunt but for me, well worth it.

My favorite meal there is the 7 courses of beef.... it's enough for two people and absolutely tasty... 

First you get a very fresh tasting beef salad. Next you get a  hot pot where you cook thinly sliced pieces of beef to your preferred doneness.. with that you get rice papers so you can make your own spring rolls with them along with lots of fresh vegetables. 

then you get a plate full of little rolled up morsels of beef 

and then you get a ball of beef filled with glass noodles peppercorns and LOVE.

after that you get a bowl of amazing beef soup... it's really flavorful and a perfect end to the meal.

I haven't read any reviews of people who have tried the 7 courses... I encourage everyone to give it a try..

I should mention that the owner came to my table and acknowledged that he hasn't seen me in awhile! I explained to him that I was out of state for awhile and he graciously accepted my return.... I can't wait to eat here again... I love this place and I hope you do too once you give it a try.

I've added photos to the ball of beef steamed in banana leaf and filled with love!

I would also like to point out that I don't think that any business should get 1 star just because they changed their hours when YOU wanted to go there but couldn't because they were closed. 

it's pretty tough out there right now for a lot of people, and giving a business 1 star and leaving a review about them being closed is a pretty terrible practice that should be avoided because it just isn't fair.....

The menu is the standard cuisine you would expect from a traditional Vietnamese place. It has spring rolls, egg rolls, vermicelli salads, endless varieties of Pho, 7 courses of beef, you name it, they have it. 

Flavors developed in the kitchen are great. With each dish, you can really taste the oriental spices and marinades that go into the proteins. Even their salad has a nice vinaigrette dressing lightly tossed in. As far as the Pho goes, it's fantastic, cheap, and delicious.

As far as service goes, do not expect corny, smiley faces each time you go in, it's just not in the culture to bend over backwards for everyone. The owner is very friendly however once you get to know him, and his wife is very sweet. He has his sons helping them out on their off time, which makes it that much better knowing you are getting a quality meal from a family owned place than a chain that half the time, doesn't give a shit.

I came at an odd hour but definitely was hungry for lunch!  I ordered the beef carpaccio, lemongrass tofu, and Vietnamese iced coffee.  My waitress was excellent and friendly.  I believe the owners were there, and one showed me how to eat the beef by wrapping the thin meat around a daikon-carrot-onion salad with peanuts and dipping it in a nuoc cham with wasabi.

This really was enough food for lunch, but I sampled my lemongrass tofu and took it to go.  It came with rice and salad.  Plenty for 2 meals!  The iced coffee was strong and delicious.  The tofu did say on the menu that it was ""5-alarm"" but it was hardly spicy, so that was slightly disappointing.  However, I had never had beef carpaccio Viet-style, so that was a real treat.  The meat was sliced so thin.

However, the bowl was surprisingly large for only $6.50. I'd say the broth was tasty, but I'm not one to get into the complexities of broth ingredients. I also take off points whenever a place only has Sriracha and none of that ""home made"" style chili sauce. This isn't really a big deal. I just prefer the chunky chili sauce.

Anyway, for the price, this place is definitely A-OK. The service was a tad slow (it seemed like they didn't really have anyone working out in the customer area).

I distinctly remember the broth on the pho being very peculiar. Not a good kind either. It had a really strong beefy taste that just overpower the entire dish.  I didn't request any beef fat on it, so it couldn't be that. The beef balls didn't help either. I like to call it the bacon wrapped in bacon effect. Having a strong beefy broth and beef balls doesn't add anything to the dish, you're just eating beef.

At least, the ingredients are good. Just execution didn't work on the Pho. The pho could have been served much hotter, but at least it wasn't lukewarm.

Service? You're in an Asian restaurant, there is no service, period. I'm sure the people working there are friendly though.

1.  Ambiance - Kinda of very casual and simple, plenty of tables.

2.  Service - Went there around 11:30 for lunch and only a few people, so very easy and casual to get service. I did not get a lot of suggestions on the menu even though I asked, however, the service was okay, no issues at all.  I would say just casual.  I liked the fact that they let us stay as long as we wanted without pushing the bill on us.

3.  Menu - Huge selection of rice dishes, meat dishes, Pho, table barbecue as well.  I want to come back for the table barbecue as it looks like a really good.

- Chicken and Meat dishes - My friend ordered the grilled chicken and it was quite large serving, so be hungry when ordering the meat dishes.

- Pho - No number system and let's face it, I cannot pronounce the language very well, so point and shoot was the best way to go.  I had Pho Beef Combo with all the beefy stuff , tendons and brisket in it. I ordered the large and wow was it very large.  The soup was okay, I put a lot of spice in it to get it some flavor.  They put a heck alot of noodles in it, however, mine was a bit clumpy and while the taste of the noodle was good, I found the fact that it was clumpy to be weird at best. Since texture is as important as taste, I would say that the Pho is not the greatest here, however, i will go again and try it to get a better idea.

- Table barbecue - I am going to go back to try this with friends as it seems a really nice way to hang out and be with friends.  Even though I haven't tried it yet, I am excited to do so!!!

4.  Price - No bad. Everything is just under 10.00 or slightly over. The table bbq meats and seafood is just under 20.00 for the plate of meat.

5.  Will keep you updated on the return visit. However, I am interested enough to try this place again. 

My suggestion also is to go to Bosa 1 on Jones and Spring Mountain when it is not busy time, you will see how the service is different, where they are explaining things, letting you try things and helping you with your culinary experience!

* Pho Beef ""Combination of slices of rare beef, cooked brisket, & beef ball"" (Medium $6.50) - The first thing I noticed when the bowl was placed in front of me was how small it was.  The bowl was of average size, but it was the portion inside the bowl that looked a bit disappointing.  I looked at the Husband and he was thinking the same thing.  When I started to stir the noodles around, they were stuck together in one big clump.  Not good.  And it also took a bit longer for an order of pho to come out, and I have a feeling my noodles were sitting in the bowl too long before it was brought out to me.  The broth smelled great, but tasted average.  There wasn't that much meat in my order either.  Sure, it's a medium and they have the large and x-large family sizes available, but I'm usually pretty content with the smallest size offered at Vietnamese restaurants.

* Grilled Chicken ""Marinated, then grilled."" ($8.50) - The Husband couldn't decide between the Chicken with Basil Sauce or the Lemongrass Chicken.  (The Golden Baked Chicken was unavailable this evening.)  The table next door got the Grilled Chicken and the waiter (owner?) suggested that was a better choice over the three.  It came with a side salad, rice, and a dipping sauce.  The Husband said it tasted like he expected it too, and appreciated that it wasn't dry.

Overall, I was a bit disappointed with my first experience with Bamboo Bistro.  Pho isn't what they are known for, so that was my mistake in ordering it.  Next time I'll have to try their Beef Carpaccio, House Specials, or the 7 Courses of Beef.

With what looked like a husband and wife team running the floor, they were efficient and friendly.  Mostly families were dining there on a Wednesday night, so I'm sure they'd get higher stars once I try their other offerings.",rt3PC7WCgCKsoufmQJELfw,8,6,3,odp4eLHp3iUNsEsropi8Bw

Our server was also the manager and was very mean or so I thought, but that's just the way he spoke (loud as if he were mad).

Everytime I go here I get the same things because they are soo good! 
If you need some suggestions and want to try authenticcuisine try these:

1) Beef Carpaccio- The best!!
2) Spring rolls
3) Chicken wings or short ribs
4) The shrimp rolls - Where you wrap the rolls yourself (How true Vietnamese people eat)
5) Any other things that you can roll yourself - Beef, Pork, Lmb, Shrimp

One of the bst Vietnamese restaurants in Vegas!",ccG2Mo0w3Lifc8hyQd9FgQ,0,0,4,QBC4_KM8vwXvhRBCRr-Iaw

5918597,2010-09-24,0,ZGXd87vme_dDVYqr-HpRQQ,"I used to live pretty close to the previous Bamboo Bistro location at the Durango/Desert Inn location, but for whatever reason have never visited that restaurant. And today I visited their new relocated location on 7537 S. Rainbow Blvd (Rainbow exit off the 215), as the previous location has since been closed.
Bamboo Bistro comes highly recommended by my Vietnamese friend, who loves their Tri Color Dessert and their Sn Bò Nng (Grilled Short Beef Ribs). He comes here orders it to eat at the restaurant and 2 more of each to go for breakfast and lunch the next day.  Seems a little crazy, but after sampling them both for myself I can see that the obsession is well justified.  The Tri Color Dessert looks similar to the Tri Color Dessert served at other Vietnamese restaurants, but is actually an original creation of the owner. The taste is better, and you get mostly the goodies and not the ice cubes as fillers.  The same goes for the Grilled Short Beef Ribs, which is basically like the Korean Kalbi served in Korean restaurants or Hawaiian BBQ, but again it just tastes better.  My guess is that the quality of the beef ribs used is probably better, what it is marinaded in is also better balanced and tastier, and it also looks about 20% thicker than at other restaurants.  I didn't try anything else, but just based on these 2 items I will definitely be back for more.

The location is also better for Bamboo Bistro, as the business is doing well with a lot of steady customers coming in relative to the previous location.  However, with the restaurant being busy, they may need to hire additional help to service the guests in the front and maybe more cooks in the back too.

Anyway, the ambiance is nice and the dining room is roomy enough to seat 99 guests. Service is friendly, the food tastes great, a solid 4 stars for me.",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,6,5,4,H643zkGIh4AVuAQQHfj2EA

All of their menu items are made exquisitely with love and the restaurant is overseen by the owners everyday. Rest assured the quality of food & service will always be good! My favorite dishes are the the korean bbq spare ribs, beef carppaccio (which is thin slices of rare beef topped with lemon juice, garnish & crushed roasted peanuts, who knew raw meat was to die for!?), ground beef wrapped in lotus leaf, & don't forget dessert/drink tri-color drink! They have dishes you can't get at any other vietnamese place, but don't worry they still have Pho & Vermicelli bowls! Everybody that I have taken here has been impressed so far, that's why you should try it too!",UAO-fiRQl0Why09SjUaMjw,1,0,5,CD01t1hpF7QnglGxTvR2Fw

I will mention that I've been all over the world and never had I come across quality dishes like this. The staff is intuitive, thoughtful and understand the intricities of their menu. I recommend anyone from anywhere to come here while in Vegas, or for locals to make this place your new go-to restaurant for a fast and awesome meal.

The restaurant in pretty roomy and clean. I'd definitely be interested in eating there next time. The service was pleasant as well. I ordered some vermacelli bowls to go along with a tofu summer roll. I wasn't a big fan of the noodles. Just not as good at Pho So 1, but still tasty. My shrimp was ok, but a little on the fishy side for my taste. My fella's pork was overly dry and really well done. The tofu summer roll was pretty tasty and I liked that they included hot sauce in the to go bag as well. This place didn't blow me away, but I think based on other reviews I might just have ordered the wrong things. 

If I'm in the area again, I wouldn't hesitate to check them out but this first experience doesn't have me feel like I want to rush back again soon.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,4,4,3,PNiqgleoRl8hDY7aLBno6A
