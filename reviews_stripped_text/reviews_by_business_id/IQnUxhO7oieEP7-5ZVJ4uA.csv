We were having fun as we had out of town visitors, we did not pay attention to the bill. We later realized that the pad thai never got served. The receipt they gave us never had the breakdown of what they charged us.

Last time we ordered take they had recently changed the name to Siamese Bistro but online it was still under Pin Kaow. They have since raised the prices so we asked why was it still under Pin Kaow online with there old prices. After speaking with the manager we were told they will not honor those prices but we still placed the order since the food was so good. Today we placed an order. They charged me for the order then called back and said they didn't have beef teriyaki but we could have store credit or get something else so we got Calamari and Chai Tea. Well the food was not good and we got about 8 pieces of Calamari and the cup they used for the Chai Tea was smashed and the bottom tore off so we had our tea in a plastic bag. We called and were told the driver would not come back so we can get a free Calamari within the next 2 weeks. What a joke seriously after ordering beef salad, yellow chicken curry, broccoli with chicken, pot stickers, Calamari and this Chai Tea spilled into a plastic bag and tipping the guy $5 thats there service to long time customers.

1942142,2018-01-26,12,IQnUxhO7oieEP7-5ZVJ4uA,"Siamese Bistro has been on my bookmarks for ages, based in large part on the fact that their social media promotes one of my favorite hard-to-find Thai dishes: Khao Soi, a curry noodle soup with chicken topped with fried noodles for a beautiful presentation. Planned a group dinner here during the holidays to check the place out with a few friends, most of who are Thai or have been to Thailand. 

Menu items were hit or miss- the soft shell crab and mango salads were both great, refreshing starters but the curries we ordered were on the sweeter side, even when ordering green (which is supposed to be hotter).  
 The Khao Soi that I was so looking forward to was underwhelming, with a bland curry soup base and dry, overcooked chicken. We chose another business in the plaza for dessert.

Service  was not particularly engaging or attentive. We repeatedly had to ask for additional sharing plates/bowls, spoons, etc. All of the diners were seated in adjacent booths along the right wall- out of the entire restaurant space, literally all of the customers were in one area, all right next to each other, which hampered conversation as we didn't want to disturb tables immediately adjacent to us.  Not sure why this was done but it contributed to making our visit less enjoyable.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,23,18,3,Ggb6EiyZeYttx1zlBrQn3Q

3030363,2017-01-26,0,IQnUxhO7oieEP7-5ZVJ4uA,"Not the best thai restaurant I've tasted. Me and my cousin decided to try another new restaurant and we chose Siamese Thai since it was nearby. It was the worst choice. We went in on Wednesday, January 25, 2016 around 1:30 p.m. and the place was dead.

We ordered a few dishes, they were:
- Beef Jerkey
- Catfish Delight
- Chicken & Shrimp Pad Thai
- Chicken and Shrimp Pineapple Fried Rice

We first got the Beef Jerkey. The Beef Jerkey itself was very delicious but the sauce was ok.

Next, we got the Catfish Delight. The Catfish Delight was alright. It wasn't the best nor the worst dish we had. The catfish itself seems it wasn't fried enough and the sauce tasted ok. They didn't add any spice, just plain fried catfish pieces with curry sauce on top of it with vegistables on it and that's all.

Then, we got the Chicken and Shrimp Pineapple Fried Rice. Since my cousin loves shrimp, we ordered this dish. She was looking for shrimp and only found three pieces. Really? Three pieces of shrimp in a fried rice dish. Disappointed. The worse part was that one of the shrimp pieces was bad because it had a weird smell and taste. As for the whole Pineapple Fried Rice dish itself, it tasted alright. It had tons of onions in it and less chicken and shrimp.

Finally, the Chicken Pad Thai came. The dish itself was ok, it didn't taste as good as the other Thai restaurants I've gone to. It just had a little flavor.

As for the service, not the best. The waitress just orders our food, brings out the food, gives us the check, and box our left overs and that's it. They didn't come and ask us how's our meal? Do you need refill for your drink? Or anything like that. We had to wait a few minutes to get one of the waitresses attention since all of them were having lunch.

Overall it was not the best. I recommend to eat somewhere else. They do have lunch specials here but probably taste worse. We ordered the dinner menu and it was costly. We could of eaten somewhere else where it was very delicious and way cheaper than this restaurant.",fTt_rcnc-nNpjWaDrbvEow,1,0,2,ZzetlkLSSQNJVHmRc20ypg

I had the spicy basil with ground beef. I thought it was really good. It had great flavors. You can taste the basil which I loved but not overpowering. Most places make their spicy basil salty but this had the right amount of salt.

I also tried their pad Thai. It was really good. You can taste the peanut sauce but not too much of it. 

At first the service was kinda slow but they were really attentive and nice overall. I enjoyed it.

We asked if we can order the mongolian beef with only green onions & white onions (instead of all the bell peppers that it cooked with). Server said ""no, can not change"". I told her but onions cost less than bell peppers...and asked if she could ask the chef's if they could do it. She continued to shake her head and said no, we cant change. So we ordered it anyway....and i cant tell you how tough the beef was and absolutely did NOT taste like mongolian flavor (not because it was cooked w/bell peppers)...the flavors were highly lacking. The whole dish looked light and grey. WORST dish I've ever had! Even my kids were like...is this mongolian beef? I also ordered the basil chicken...it was a tiny portion and it wasn't good.

Service needs just a tad bit of work.. as soon as we walked in there were no workers available or anywhere to be found so we just seated ourselves. Sat there for a bit until a worker finally noticed us and provided us a menu.. once we were noticed the service was great (besides the fact that they mixed our spice levels up on our dishes) and we were constantly checked on.

We ordered:
-Thai papaya salad, spicy 5 (received a spicy 8)-- bomb and it was actually the perfect spice so I'm kinda glad I was given the wrong spice level here lol.
-Yellow chicken curry, spicy 8 (received a spicy 5)-- this was really good but could've been spicier. My girlfriend had to order more spice on the side.

Pros:

4) Fast/reliable service- Gave me 15-20 minutes and it was ready when I arrived 20 minutes later.
5) Spring rolls were a lot larger than I was anticipating! You get 4
6) Massaman Curry was delicious (not too salty) and I was able to get it sans meat. Came with Jasmine rice, potatoes and onions. Ample serving size. I was able to have some for lunch the next day :)
7) Convenience: Directly across the street from my house!

Oh what a beautiful spot.  The outside sign looks like a pub more than a bistro.  The inside has that WOW factor.  But I didn't come here for the wall décor or to taste their design sense.  The décor was super nice.  The bench area was beautiful... But I wanted to EAT!!! 

I was hangry and expected some good stuff especially for all the yelp reviews.  I wanted Jenni Pho but was forced to come here.  The waitress was very pushy and was rushing us.  The place was empty - WHY ARE YOU ALL OVER ME LADY?! But we finally ordered.  We got the BBQ chicken which I think was as big as a pigeon.  For the price of $14.95 I expected a bigger piece.  I felt like we had to fight for the small pieces.  Also, the chicken was overcooked and dry.  Then we got the Crying Tiger Beef - Oh I was crying... because there was not enough beef for two people.  It was enough for a baby bear.  I was highly disappointed with the flavor.  We asked for medium and we got medium well.  GRRRR.  The plus was the beef soup.  it was the cheapest and the heartiest but there was only 1 1/2 beef ball in it.  I mean COME ON guys! We asked for the menu to be left and the lady asked for it back in the middle of the meal.  I mean come on lady, what if we wanted dessert? Ever asked if we even wanted sweets?

4823743,2016-09-18,1,IQnUxhO7oieEP7-5ZVJ4uA,"Ordered take-out from Siamese bistro looking to scratch that Thai-food itch and was sadly disappointed.

The Panang curry had no peppers or ""normal"" Panang curry trimmings... just curry-broth and green beans. So weird. Also the curry kind of had a sour taste to it and it was sooooooooo salty. Without rice to camouflage the saltiness this would be inedible.

The Massaman curry also really, really, really salty.

The silver noodles were decent, not very flavorful, but we still ate them.

The crab rangoons ~ always the star of the show. Cream cheese, imitation crab, wonton-ed and deep fried? Yes please. These gut busters were great, my favorite part of the meal.",mYNZLYcnZol-oSfU-WP4CQ,3,1,2,D6KcRawmYxlQUAxlW1Njsw

After only 1 bit of chicken, I just ate the green curry sauce and rice. It was the day after Christmas, so maybe they didn't get fresh chicken for a while. Still, they shouldn't make us pay for really bad food. They did offer to replace the food, but that doesn't make any sense.

I was really looking forward to the mango sticky rice but the sticky rice could have been heated up a little more or should be softer. The spicy beef basil was bland and not like any spicy beef basil I ever had tasted before. The duck egg rolls was ok.

I prefer to order takeout for that reason, my boyfriend and I have been one of maybe three other tables in there and would not get things we asked for and also in a slow manner. As for the food however, it is the best curry & Tom Yum soup I have EVER had and I give it a two thumbs up! I do think though that they should spice it up a bit when you ask them for an 8-10...mine isn't usually as spicy as I would like but the flavor is impeccable. Great job with the food quality and presentation, I hope that the next time I am brave enough to eat inside that the service is better.",vUcAM6d1K3nVnLUtXQIU7A,0,0,4,if8_IUL6pIJv1QRQp4Vtzg

I walked in this place and it looks the same as before. The male server is very nice, and always helpful to us. BUT the old lady server was rude. I don't think a woman whose limping should be serving food in my opinion. All we asked for was a spoon with our soup and she gave a disgusting attitude about it. I feel really bad for the male server that works there for her. You deserve better. 

Now for the food, everything is SALTY ! The Tom yum soup was drenched in a gallon of salt. The lemon grass trout taste just fine. The pad Thai was okay. This place would've been good, if their food was right and management was polite. Then they would've became a very busy dine in.",w9WmBotuUdQlmuLa3XUkFQ,0,0,1,BXvLRd7Lh_QXW45WljeYuQ

1. Fast service. It took them only 10 minutes to get my orders ready. 
2. 10 mins away from my house

Cons:
1. Not recommend the service. 
Called in for a to-go order. The lady on the phone asked for my phone number and told me that my name (and my phone #) was not on the restaurant's system. She told me to call other locations since they have 3. I told her that this location was near my house and that I wanted to order and pick up from here. She, then again, told me to call others. I had to repeatedly tell her that this was my first time ordering here so she won't see my name on the system.

2. The foods are not Thai authentic. 
Ordered Pad Thai and Chili Mint Fried Rice. There were missing ingredients that made up Pad Thai, including peanuts and slices of lemon (that supposed to squeeze in). Pad Thai was oily and less tasteful.",xmy1y1htU7UfPy_T5AgrEw,4,0,3,ajoW5dFjYIeOCXny51zM7Q
5693803,2017-11-27,0,IQnUxhO7oieEP7-5ZVJ4uA,"First time there, got takeout...ordered yellow curry w steamed tofu & pad thai w shrimp.  Got home to find the shrimp was barely cooked, it was still translucent!  The yellow curry was very tasty, but only has potatoes...it really could've used some vegetables added, perhaps some carrots, zucchini. I got it w steamed tofu and it was all just too yellow, really needed some color!  The portion sizes lacked for the $27 we spent. 

I called and spoke w Joy about the shrimp problem, she was very nice and apologetic. She said I could return at a later date for a pad Thai shrimp replacement, which I did several days later.  Even though Joy didn't request it, I brought back what was left of the dish to show the uncooked shrimp.  Joy wasn't there, but the woman I gave the food to started counting the shrimp! She said ""there's 5 here, we give 8"", I couldn't believe it! I said we threw out the ones that made it on our plates.  Her response should've been ""We're so sorry we gave you obviously uncooked shrimp!"", that's the only acceptable response.  When they brought the replacement meal out, it was almost insulting how they made a big deal to uncover it saying the cook wanted to make sure I was happy with it. I simply said ""yes, I'm happy when my food is cooked"".  It was as if I was not believed the shrimp was uncooked, even though I gave them the raw shrimp back.  That was last month.

Today I craved some yellow curry. I called and believe I got the same woman who counts shrimp. She's hard to understand. I asked for yellow curry, vegetarian. Pretty sure she said they could put broccoli and carrots and I asked if there would be any extra charge. She said no. I asked for tofu, she said that's $2 more. Then she said the broccoli and carrots would be $2 also. So this little dish was now about $15, all because I wanted a green vegetable. I was annoyed, guess they must not want customers.  I told her to forget it.  Too bad, this place is close by.  I'll be looking for another Thai place.",lhlvTfKX9181dowOvpVqlg,0,0,1,Rr_q-WVGbDtdLoGEqdizAw

5793434,2017-04-26,0,IQnUxhO7oieEP7-5ZVJ4uA,"I've been really turned off by this restaurant since the change of ownership/name change, but today the service was too horrible to not say anything. 

We have been ordering take out here for a very long time, and the food has been good. They have ALWAYS been able to accommodate slight tweaks and special requests (both before and after the change over). It's always to leave the meat out of a dish and make it vegetarian.

Today when I called to place a pick up order, I was told that my usual request would not be accommodated. After she checked with a coworker she said they'd do it for a hefty up charge. Uhm, what?

The request was to simply leave the meat out of the dish and add more cashews and raisins that the dish already comes with. The girl taking the order was so rude about it, acted like she didn't need or want my business, and kept saying cashews are very expensive. Really? Not as much as leaving the meat out, I'm sure! 

Needless to say, we will not be coming here again. When businesses make it clear that they don't care about their customers, especially repeat customers, believe them. 

After this incident, I called up Benjarong Thai restaurant, ordered and got ZERO problems when ordering and I was definitely not upcharged either. They had it ready in 10 minutes and was a huge portion and delicious.",-95gDpECFDSjWEL1AIrkAA,2,0,1,7_7XXtlM5d-5btO1w6IG9A
