 I got the Vegetarian sandwich, and as another yelper mentioned, it comes with both pesto and guac, which is weird, so I asked for just pesto.  The veggies have been soaking in some kind of marinade, which makes the bread a little soggy, and also makes the veggies feel a little slimy.  The guy personalized my sandwich with less cheese, though, which was nice.

I asked if they could toast the flatbread, and was told no.  I asked if any sandwiches could be toasted, and the guy behind the counter said they were all cold. :( 

I said the sandwich was ""for here,"" but was served the sandwich in a to-go bag.  

While I was sitting at the table eating my sandwich on top of the paper bag, another guy came in and ordered the vegetarian sandwich from a different worker, while the guy who made my sandwich was standing by.  The new customer asked if he could have it toasted, and the worker said yes.  I watched her toast it until the cheese melted and looked sadly at the guy who made my sandwich.  He avoided eye contact and didn't say anything.

I was a bit slow since I had SOOOOOO much time but the person helping me wasn't pushy or irritated.

After I got my yummy roast beef and provolone sandwich, I perused their condiment section which boasted all sorts of insane condiments you could ever want for a sandwich. I slowly ate half of my sandwich then I sat there.

I sat there because I had absolutely nothing to do. People walked by me wondering why such a young looking kid was traveling alone in Las Vegas, maybe, probably but it didn't bother me any. I sat there and none of the workers complained about me.

We ordered a breakfast pocket with ham, cheese, and egg - and then a breakfast plate with scrambled eggs, bacon, biscuit, and potatoes.  My husband's platter was cold - the food was barely warm and the eggs when she scooped them out of the pan she had to let them drain a while - yuck - before putting on the plate.  The biscuit tasted like nothing and was cold.  Bacon was ok. Cold greasy potatoes- nope, not a good thing.  My pocket was heated by a heat lamp - and when I took my first bite I almost gagged - as the oil they had fried it in had gone rancid.  It was so disgusting - I immediately went up and said I could not eat that, it had gone bad.  She offered a egg and cheese bagel instead, which I reluctantly took, knowing that my husband's platter was not going to be satisfactory as a replacement.  She heated that up in it's wrapper on a panini maker - which was kinda strange, but it worked.  The cheese and egg were melted but tasted just gross - I don't know what they were made of to be honest.  And she left the other remaining breakfast pocket under the heat lamp -I think she should have thrown it out too along with mine.

Checker was kind and friendly.  The rest of the staff seemed to be all on break eating in the front dining room or yelling friendly comments back and forth in the back - discussing the purchase a of new tote bag by one of the gals.  I don't mind all that - it was early morning - no big crowds, but since we were one of the first customers, the food should be really fresh and hot...instead I am sure it was just left over stuff from yesterdays breakfast....bleh!

After 10 minutes, my wife orders the Uptown Works pizza. I ordered nothing, which is my standard practice when the staff seems perturbed with me (my wife said something to them about serving the four other people behind us first, which didn't seem to sit well).

I had SUCH high hopes and this place did not live up to them! The sandwich was dry & the ingredients tasted a little weird. Maybe it's the fact that they mix pesto and guac on their veggie sandwich (their ONLY vegetarian option, it seems). That's kind of a weird flavor combo. The lettuce was wet & it made the sandwich a bit soggy. I also wish they'd heated the sandwich, because it was cold & would have been a lot less gross if it'd been heated. Anyway... Not a place I'd visit again!",ugGd3ctRaKfc19JHxcrgyQ,1,0,2,UjDUSOV2aLoqpwHDZvpdKQ

This place is SO GOOD, that I took the shuttle bus, and went through security all over again, just to eat here on my lunch break! I would always have the ""Sicilian"" Flat Bread Sandwich - THIS IS GOING TO GIVE YOU A SMILE AT THE END OF YOUR MEAL!

No words can describe how amazing this sandwich is. I have eaten at alot of different sandwiches spots - but this is HANDS DOWN THE BEST SANDWICH PLACE I HAVE EATEN AT!!!

Ordered a sandwich and waited 10 min...went to check if they were making our order and the girl said it would be 3-5 min. Waited another 10 min and nothing and when asked the second time where our order was she responded with, what did you order? Then needed to get a manager in order for us to get a refund. All in all wasted the only half hour we had before our flight. Save your self the time and go to o burger king.

I ordered the kale and arugula salad with chicken and it actually tasted pretty good. After leaving the place and walking back to my gate I immediately started feeling off. I had a long layover and was uncomfortable for about an hour and half, hoping it would pass. 

Then, of course, 5 minutes before my flight starts boarding things get worse - quick. I rush to the bathroom and pretty much barf up the whole salad. The other stalls probably thought I partied too much in Vegas!

The good news is, I immediately felt better and made it onto the flight with a few minutes to spare.
