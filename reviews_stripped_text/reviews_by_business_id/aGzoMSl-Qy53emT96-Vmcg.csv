Haha, ok couple days ago I went back and the co worker that has the midnight shift told me they were close because the cash register wasn't working ?

I regret not getting his name now, but complements to whoever made the decision to hire him. That kid is going places. Food was hot and fresh, which at the time made me completely forget how long I'd waited on it but 100% justifies the time. What a good Checkers experience.",A6eI3xr2S5uQq6qZjRFWKw,2,1,5,lNeA2tJsnkBOb6eCxljSYA

3284382,2016-12-28,0,aGzoMSl-Qy53emT96-Vmcg,"Last night I popped by because I told my friend about the fries here and she's never had them. Somewhat friendly staff here. Cashier was a little iffy on how to ring things in. Didn't know how to substitute the drink for a shake. Me and my friends ordered something quick because we were in a rush to get home. 

The staff gave me looks for going through the bag and checking my order. I find when it's a big order it usually has one thing wrong lol.
They kept assuring me it was right. After I put half the bag back based on trust. I got home and low and behold my large fries weren't in there. I go to checkers JUST for the fries alone and to not have them with my meal totally was a bummer. Plus I have a tomato allergy and I told the girl that. I said whatever I order please put no ketchup or tomatoes. SHOCKING my hot dog had ketchup... 

Next time let the customer do what they want with their food, this coulda been avoided if they made it right or didn't give me a hard time for checking the order in front of them. When you pay for something you earn the right to make sure your food is correct.

Maybe being a restaurant manager I have too much expectations. Again I was right though. It wasn't even busy enough to have a messed up order :(",ugpGI6jgFq_gDyaGBn1Cmw,4,3,3,QMfg72fAmV4tjcovQANS8g
3705304,2016-01-17,1,aGzoMSl-Qy53emT96-Vmcg,"Never thought I'd have to do this to Checker's because their fries + ranch is my drug of choice, but frick! The lady working the drive-thru & the cook (maybe they're the same person - who knows) around 1:00 AM are a WRECK...

As soon as we pulled up to order, she very rudely told us to wait in an exasperated tone. After about 5 minutes, we placed our orders (both simple combo meals) and pulled around to the window, just to get another 5-minute wait. Not a single word exchanged as she took my debit card. A few more minutes later, she tossed our food at us & projected a quick ""thank you,' then slammed the window shut. I couldn't even ask for napkins or ranch...

Sooooo over it, ready to go home, eat, & knock out after a long day of thankless work, I drive home just to find out that my soda was flat & my chicken tenders were so overcooked that I couldn't even bite into them. 

Disgusting food, disgusting attitude, I will NOT be dining here again... at least not at nighttime.",ImnJ5KKaWWNjj1E9kEArmQ,0,0,1,Jpcy38exeH02k-c38OVJdw

There was only 3 people working a lunch rush. Wait times on the screens exceeded ten minutes or more. I'd have left, but I needed something before work, and I was already there.
