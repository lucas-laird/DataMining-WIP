I love their T-BONE STEAK and all the trimmings that come with it. Also breakfast is amazing. Angie makes huge pancakes I have ever eating.
I have been going to this restaurant religiously everything Saturday since opening. I really really recommend this restaurant. Oh, by the way it's VERY clean and rated A rating by the city. Please Angie and Richard KEEP up the excellent service you are doing. See you soon next Saturday.",1KiSl4-oEOMVQRHqYRP9vw,1,1,5,HrTnbEFJsLAoaB-F6yexHw

We had the homemade chicken strips and homemade steak strips.  Delicious.  Definitely comfort food.  Met the owner/chef/server Angie...what a doll. Felt like hanging out with an old friend.  

Nothing fancy...just good comfort food and great conversation.",wfN6tTTTnRcym5JhtHhQpA,0,0,4,61TirvRGj2iJJSI_wborAg

3555406,2018-03-26,1,yJdFEd5AlF1mXKXApDkGXg,"I found this hidden gem and it is located across from Santa Fe Casino tucked away in a small strip of shops that I didn't know existed.

The place is decorated tastefully in Southern style. It made us feel like back in the south and also feel like I had stop somewhere outside Vegas on a road trip.

They serve delicious homemade country style food. Being from North Carolina, it reminds me of the many places there. 

There was a little bit of a wait since everything are made fresh to order.

We had the Steak and eggs; Everything but the Sink and Chorizo & Egg Burrito.

Everything was made so flavorful and fresh. And to top it all, the price is so inexpensive.

The restaurant is family owned. The owner, I believe is Angie serves us and she is a delightful woman. I asked the young boy who also served us when the place was opened, he mentioned last October.

Such a great find! Looking forward in trying out their lunch menu.

Overall, a wonderful country home cooking!",8dxkcmAXY4ttrVFD1GhbdQ,2,1,5,snwbnM76AhX2sN8PmlmRwA
3635283,2018-02-14,1,yJdFEd5AlF1mXKXApDkGXg,"Had breakfast at this cafe this morning and it was mediocre at best. First, the coffee was lukewarm, the beacon cold and brittle, bread was un toasted. waitress/owner, didn't bother to inquire about my meal nor offer me a refill of my lukewarm coffee. The total of my meal, $9.20. I gave the lady $10.00, with no change offered. My wife was upset, especially about the proprietor keeping the change. I explained to my wife that my ""Tip"" would be given on yelp.",zN4M-hA86ps5I6BwXoqcqA,5,2,1,bOGwTx7HPdC1Avxh4zE6sw

3759866,2017-12-27,0,yJdFEd5AlF1mXKXApDkGXg,"Great little homey breakfast place.

It's tucked in the parking lot behind the Santa Fe casino next to a large church.

As we stepped inside the owner came out send spoke to us and told us about herself and her restaurant. She was very welcoming and sat us down. 

I had the pancakes, bacon, eggs, and sausage. 

The girlfriend had an order of biscuits and gravy. And we shared some grits. 

The pancakes were incredibly delicious and flaky. You could taste the buttermilk on them. Soooo good! We both agreed they were the best part. 

I'm not a fan of biscuits and gravy but the GF is and she liked them very much. She said she really liked the biscuits. 

The sausage patties and bacon were cooked perfectly and the waiter was very attentive. Overall it was a nice morning and a yummy breakfast. 

We were invited to come back for dinner and we definitely will. La novia [GF in Spanish] wanted to try the chicken fingers, and I want a burger, so we will definitely be back. 

Only drawback is that there was no tip option when paying with a credit card. So bring some tipping cash!",Eyard5dGOqZVVSCAtH7iOg,2,0,5,GRGK-arJ9jXYTYL6KKZQKw

Angie is a very awesome soul, she made the whole experience worthwhile. We ordered and I purchased a chili cheese burger with fries. I like how the fries are homestyle and made in house, they tasted great! Angie's corner is complete comfort from the menu, the people and the atmosphere. I'll be back!

4213084,2017-09-04,0,yJdFEd5AlF1mXKXApDkGXg,Discovered this place about two weeks ago.  Now we are going back every weekend.      Angie makes everything from scratch.   Some of the best chili I've ever had.   For her chicken fried steak she even  hand breads them and the cornbread is also great.  Can't wait to try other things on the menu .   Husband Richard is a great person also. Really friendly folks and good home cooking.  You will not be disappointed,Ip5yFz3eP75oBjsyWYIxVA,2,1,5,9sFA8OddLL1siDEe7G1SCQ
4613403,2018-02-04,0,yJdFEd5AlF1mXKXApDkGXg,"I was on my way to the Santa Fe and passed Angie's place and decided to stop in and try the place out and I am good I did. I really enjoyed my breakfast with my morning paper and though Angie and her staff were busy catering an event she still made time to talk to me.  Her husband was very friendly as well, I would like to mention I ordered some grits with my breakfast that didn't arrive with the other food but Angie was extremely busy with the large group that was starting to assemble and there was a slight delay.  I only mention this because she was very graceful and apologetic and offered me a sample of the smoked ribs they had prepared for the days special and let me tell you though I was completely full from breakfast I ate the whole thing when I got home......Great place I am planning to make a stop there weekly....

4726429,2017-06-28,0,yJdFEd5AlF1mXKXApDkGXg,This is a nice place and it has good potential however Mrs Angie needs some help. We sat there in the place while she cooked the people who was there before us food after they were gone we waited soooo long for our food.  When we finally got our food my container was so light i thought it was empty..lol you can tell it was rushed. My pancakes were the size of 2 silver dollars and ill just leave it at rushed.  Like i said it's a nice place and shes a nice lady but when you serve food you never know who and how many people you might have to feed on any given day.,2OpJ6oZ30PXPyW_ioYGtSg,2,0,2,3658n6j6TSXaqq9bZzoLow

The food wasn't bad if you ever received it and the service was beyond horrible!!!!!!!!!

$35.00 later and I left hungry and wasted my hard earned money!

So many things were wrong that I would run out of space!",kOqcNFcpDl3h8vFNJ7FwWA,0,0,1,PhU3g6p325R7zadjJzInFA
