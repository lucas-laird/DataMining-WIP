They had a ton of nicely flavored meat on them, tomatoes and onions.  The sauce came on the side and was very good.  We'd have preferred to have some lettuce and feta on them, but the default configuration is still excellent (and filling).  Next time we're there, we'll ask them to add those things (it looks like the feta will cost a bit extra).  While we were eating, we also noted that a lot of people were ordering their fries.  They *looked* darn good, so we'll probably try those next time, too (though the sandwich alone is already more than enough food).  It's a bit expensive for, essentially, a gyro in a fast-food setting.  But, overall, I think it's worth it.",IgFS6DZRcePxecF17YA3Qg,0,0,4,CQdUDt7up4DNiNEAQtXJCw

I ordered the chicken sandwich, which is grilled chicken, tomatoes, and ice berg lettuce with cucumber sauce on the side. Again, I was disappointed. I wouldn't say that it's bad, more so that it's completely bland and not very flavorful. The chicken takes like it was marinated in water with a some sprinkled pepper and salt. I added a bit of the cucumber sauce for flavoring and it didn't make much of a difference. Overall, I don't think I will come back and try this place again.

Have never tried anything else here because it never disappoints. Generous amount of meat, warm thick pita bread, fresh tomatoes and onions. Comes with a side of tzatziki sauce.

The thing that makes this place amazing is I have to say their tzatziki sauce is my all-time favorite among ANY other gyro place I've tried! It is probably the standard of which I rate others. Seriously so fresh, so savory and so light... pairs perfectly with the gyro! 

Only downfall is this place does not open until 11am, and they close relatively early at 8pm.

Now I'm not the special one who came up with the pricing, but my request is simple - pita, gyro meat, cheese. Not so hard right? Well, apparently it is. The Gyro Time and the BBQ gyro are the same price, but the bbq one comes with cheese. So why pay extra to get it on the plain gyro (gyro time) when it comes on the other one for the same price. But today, for whatever reason, when I asked to sub the BBQ meat for the regular one, they ""can't to do it"" and ""our boss wouldn't like it"". Well, you've been doing it for months.

As far as food is great! I usually always order the grilled chicken or the original gyro wrap. Comes with tones of meat and vegetables, and come with a delicious side of cucumber sauce. I also like the fact that is comes on the side for I think you get a little more and it make the wrap not get all messy. 

Another great option they have is that they have a vegan option for their is no egg in the pita and the falafel. So gf loves that and she gets in a wrap or salad. 

And for sides they have very good French fires or on the healthy side they have grilled zucchini.

I called them to tell them what had happened and they said they would give us credit on only the one meal........but with gas, time, and travel and heat WE felt that beings our dinner plan was ruined that it would be nice if they would credit two meals (JUST FOR THE BOTHER).  My God If you are at a restaurant and they screw up on one persons order the meal is comped, because the second person doesn't want to eat in front of the other person with no food. Therefore they comp the meal for two......this doesn't hardly ever happen where a restaurant screws up but at GYRO TIME it did!  When I had asked for a comp for both driving time and gas and heat  they basically may as well of said HELL NO!!!!!  Poor customer relations in our opinions!!!!!!  Hell, I guess they think GAS AND TIME ARE FREE!!!!!!
WE WILL NEVER GO BACK TO THIS ESTABLISHMENT.  I suppose that one GYRO is more important than customer service /customer care.

Way too much oil (not olive oil)to the point of tasting fishy!  The lettuce was in huge chunks and brownish. The ketchup was chunky like it's never been mixed properly.

3378465,2011-07-23,4,gKFDJ9IpFxt95DHxTN7ZHw,"Finally you, the genius reviewers of Yelp, have gotten it right! I agree that Gyro Time on W Cheyenne firmly deserves a 3 - 3 1/2 star rating.

The major problem with Gyro Time is the price of the food. Each gyro, although generously proportioned, is seven bucks or more. Even a Greek God with a brain the size of a rabbit turd can realize seven plus U.S. dollars for a single gyro is outrageous!

While paying a total of eighteen bucks for two gyros and a small french fry sucks, the food deserves praise. My steak souvlaki and my significant other's gyro time sandwich were mouth-melting. That means good. And the french fries, although average, got along really well with the creamy cucumber sauce when making love. 

Since I was picking my food up to go, I can't say with conviction whether or not the service was good. I will tell you this : The girl that rang up my order used her Library voice in a completely empty restaurant when I asked her a question. I could have taken offense to the way she was acting, but I just took it out on her tip. She got nothing.

Baladie Cafe, atleast in my world, remains the best Greek food in Las Vegas. If I'm ever in the area of a Gyro Time again, I'll probably just fart and drive by. But if I ever make Bill Gates money and crave a fat, meaty gyro, I might think twice.",kKbGPQ1Cn-6J1XRkdA50Uw,2,2,3,XJq9Q-7cBduTNbSeDOoLOQ

The Pita was nice and moist but the Meat was bland to me.  Despite putting the Tzatziki Sauce on it, it was still lacking flavor.  I was hungry, so I finished it.  Next up was the Falafel Pocket.  It was stuffed with Falafel, Tomatoes, Onions, and Cucumber.  I used the Hummus and remaining Tzatziki Sauce with the Falafel Pocket.  I liked it better than the Gyro.

Gyro Time Sandwich ($6.95)- pretty decent but I like my gyros with more than just tomatoes. 

Fafafel Sandwich ($5.95)- This is what I came to test out. Angela H. said the falafel was decent so I wanted to give this place a try.  I think it's pretty solid overall. It was crispy, but kept moist inside. Flavorwise- I still have a preferred place to get the flavor I seek. 

They gave us tzatziki yogurt and hummus on the side. Hummus worked better on the falafel. 

For $3 more you can make it a combo meal with a drink and a choice of side: fries, grilled vegetables or spinach pie. The BF and I both chose the spanakopita and were surprised by the size. I was expecting a small triangle, but they gave us a generous slice and it was pretty tasty.
