The good, the wait staff has been really good except for the last time. She might have been having an off night so it's ok. Also, the drinks and bar tenders are really good. I can come to this restaurant and order something and it will come out the same every single time. We've almost come just to drink for this exact reason. If it wasn't such a long walk, I have no doubt we would.

The bad. The food here really isn't good compared to other Mexican restaurants, I've had three different meals worth of food and the only thing I even kind of liked was the pibil. The second time we were there the server said that the menu was in the process of being redesigned. 

Overall, this is a great watering hole and the food serviceable but nothing to write home about.",BRN_UPViHXJ3DtZGklmdqw,1,1,3,9HZq87vDlTg_W5dtrGwpzA

1099305,2011-12-28,0,8pLlsYgvrC5SJL1Con8FYw,"Came here the other night with my best friend's family. The first thing I noticed was how accommodating the restaurant is for those in wheelchairs. The hostess immediately directed us to every single ramp and moved obstacles out of the way ahead of our group. 

We had the chips, guacamole, and salsa trio to start. The guacamole is very oniony but we all like onions so we loved it. Amongst us we had the beef enchiladas, pork special, chicken enchiladas, and the chicken nugget kids meal. My little friend Dustin was well supplied with sheets for coloring. 

While the chicken tortilla soup that came with my entree was a little brothier than I'm used to and a little more bland, it was still pretty okay. All of our entrees were good (I loved the rice that accompanied my enchiladas) and the sweet potato tots that I kept snagging from Dustin's plate were delightful. He was also plied with bowls of ice cream which he seemed to really enjoy. We had the friend banana for dessert and couldn't even finish it because we were so full.

The food was good, our server was fantastic, and while the prices seemed a bit high, the restaurant.com coupon made it pretty reasonable considering the food and service was great. The restaurant also has a nice look to it; a bit darker and quiet as well as roomy. It made for a great dinner with great friends!",3CMiTAhq_o_GP1tLs-ihbg,0,1,4,Hu1Gogp6Z12R-suLaeGpvA

I had eaten here before, and really enjoyed it.  They changed the menu: it  now has more  classic Mexican dishes but they become something at a higher level in this restaurant.  We started with a made- at your- table guacamole: a lovely young lady prepared it the way we wanted- she offered a menu with selections such as mango and chipolte-really excellent - I could taste every flavor and it tasted so fresh-then we had ceviche- a separated trio of halibut, ahi tuna and shrimp- there was watermelon and other flavors and textures that made it really fantastic.  I then had their black bean soup;  I have eaten black bean soup all my life, but this was the best I have ever eaten- smooth and flavorful- I devoured it.  We ordered only one entree, and I was already full, but the presentation of it was so appealing and it tasted so good, I couldn't stop eating it: Pork Pobil  - the meat was just right, tender and the flavors, again, were complex and perfect.  There were rice and beans with the dish,  and they were both fresh, with great texture,  it was a substantial dish, but it was light and didn't make me feel like I'd eaten something heavy, at all. The shot of Mezcal I wanted for dessert, was smooth and the perfect finish.  This food was on par if not better than the many gourmet restaurants on the Strip I dine at frequently, but the biggest and best difference was the much  lower bill at the end.
I also enjoyed the enthusiastic service, the atmosphere and the duo that was playing on stage.  I look forward to going back here.",WdZbDQpbUsy3vyCVBPnjnQ,3,0,4,Hadt66JK8nFPJZGjpTLfgQ

Paintings, decorations, comfortable chairs, high ceilings, huge building hard to miss...big sign advertising happy hour! So I had to stop. We asked for chips and salsa because even though is complimentary is only served to those who ask.
We also asked about the happy hour specials and were told that it's only happy hour at the bars, not the main dining room. Ok, I'm already feeling stupid paying full price when the person 3 feet away is in a different price zone. But I'm already seating here eating the chips. Didn't seem right to move and start a new bowl of chips somewhere else. I'm not going to upset the waiter, I'll just be upset myself!
Ok back to the main dish! This is not. let me repeat...this is not, your regular Mexican food. everything is made with a different twist. Even though we wanted Mexican food we ended up eating Nouvelle Mexique Cuisin al France. Nonetheless the food was good and so were the margaritas. Service?

But once you enter it's quite an impressive restaurant and has a very polite and attentive wait staff.

The menu isn't something your ordinarily see in a Mexican restaurant and a bit pricier, however the caliber of the food and slight changes on traditional dishes made it worthwhile.  I really enjoyed the Boracho beans and Cilantro rice.  I had the traditional fajitas which were both flavorful and aplenty while my parents had the fish tacos.

2010006,2011-11-29,1,8pLlsYgvrC5SJL1Con8FYw,"So I wrote a review of this restaurant the other day that was not favorable after I saw a 4 star rating.  Let me say that when my family and I ate there several months ago the dinner was horrible to say the least.   I was contacted by an owner as well as their social media manager.  They both asked me to come in for another try as when I ate there they had issues in the kitchen which were later ironed out.   

Since I wanted to rate this place again I went in as if I had never eaten there before and told the waitress it was our first time.   I asked what shouldn't be missed when ordering.  She mentioned the fish tacos and the mushroom enchiladas.  We ordered both along with the bean and tortilla soup as well as the carne asada tacos for my son.  We all loved the food.  It was 1000 times better than our experience 4 months ago.  Whatever changes they made were for the better.   

The meal was top notch until the desert.  We ordered the tres leches which should have been called UNO leches due to the fact it was more dry than wet.  Bottom line it was horrible.  Everything else including the service was fantastic.   We will definitely return but not order desert.",6WaFlZxILBkPG3bmGICcRg,2,0,4,aIrxHErqcF_AEeM3eiJ2tQ

I ordered chicken tacos which is pretty basic so I wasn't expecting much. I was pleasantly surprised by how delicious they were! Never before have I been sad to eat all my grilled chicken....it was really that good!

Family friendly place, they gave my 2 year old crayons and coloring sheets which is always appreciated. Didn't order off the kids menu since she wasn't hungry but I do know they offer one.

 anyone who looks at these restaurant ratings like I do when I'm looking for somewhere to eat with my  Fam.  N especially  looking for a new place that your not sure about! Please read my review about this place n run the other way! I'm dead serious! This is by far the worst place I've ever eaten in my life n I'm not kidding!
 The food is way overpriced for what you get n way awful! Terrible!
 when my Fam n I walked into this place @ 8:30 in the eve. n there was not one soul in the whole place dining we should of caught the hint n walked out right then n there! but when you got kids it's a pain in the arse!  Our waiter was pushy n tried to upsell everything right off the bat! I get it as I used to be  in the industry too but sheesh! At least wait till 2 of my butt cheecks hit my seat n I have time to grab my menu n look at it!
That irritated me from the get! When we where not offered any chips n salsa but was told we could buy it for 7 bucks that got me more irritated! What kind of Mexican restaurant doesn't offer that to you complimentary? So many chances to walk out n we didn't! Shame on us! 
Getting to the food that was the worst part! I ordered the beef enchiladas! A 20 dollar plate! Gross gross gross! First off it was cold! 2nd. N I swear it looked like 3 taquitos as long as I've been eating Mexican food in my 37 years of life enchiladas are a pretty decent size! I was shocked! I even asked our waiter if it was the right dish I was served! the meat was bland n chewy the rice tasted like box rice n not Mexican at all! N the beans looked n tasted like pork n beans with a twist! It was that bad! My husband ordered the nachos n that was just as bad n gross! The whole top was charred the meat was bland n chewy n the cheese they used was either a white version of velveeta or they used ricotta on nachos n tried to melt it! Gross! All of it! We where so bummed n actually left hungry cause we took couple bites of our food n couldn't stomach to eat anymore of it! Oh n the chips n 3 dipping sauces we bought for 7 bucks cause it's not complimentary, the sauces where disgusting! The salsa tasted like tomato sauce with chili pepper flakes n the  attempt at a guacamole dip tasted like water avocados with lime juice n peppers n it was runny like diharrea! The only thing we enjoyed was our sodas! Thank God they didn't make that! Trust me! Avoid this place if not you'll be sorry.......",fYubasho7eQ5yU9jfT5ZNw,1,0,1,yZV95yTiaGM5pdWPz7zEjg

What I am reviewing with ONE star is the message I received back from the owner.  Not only did she accuse me of being a certain customer who used happy hour, restaurant.com and a yelp check in, she acted as though I had given her restaurant a horribly undeserved 1 star review instead of a more than half 3 star.  

As it is, I am NOT that certain customer.  Not only am I not that person, I, as a customer, am extremely put off to learn that the management looks down upon those that use the very coupons they put out to draw people in.  

I now realize why this place was completely dead the night we went in.  I do NOT appreciate being put down by ownership.  I thought my review was fair and honest.

I was hesitant to try this place given some of the early reviews, but I was hoping the new owners would make a go of it where several others have failed so we decided to give it a try tonight.  I'm so glad I did.

We were seated promptly--it was not busy--and our hostess asked if it was our first visit.  When we said yes, she explained some things about the food, the menu, and the restaurant.  She then left and got our iced teas.

I ordered the new pollo con mole which is not the chicken listed on their online menu.  They recently replace the pollo limon with the pollo mole.  My wife ordered the pork Yucatan pibil.  With the meals came a soup or salad and we both got the black bean soup.  It had an excellent flavor, but there was one thing missing.  The soup is pureed black beans and I would have liked some chopped or whole beans for texture.  Still, it was very tasty.

Our main dishes were excellent!  The mole on my chicken was rich and had great flavors.  I liked it because it wasn't heavy on the chocolate which I find with some restaurants.  My wife thoroughly enjoyed her pork Yucatan.  Portions were large enough we each could have brought some home for lunch tomorrow, but I, of course, pigged out and ate all of my chicken.

For dessert, we shared--sort of--a large piece of tres leches cake.  Yelpers note: with a check in and the purchase of an entree, you get a dessert.  They also have free wifi.

Service was excellent all night.  The manager came over and spoke with us about our dinners, and our iced tea was always refilled promptly.

4120424,2011-08-02,0,8pLlsYgvrC5SJL1Con8FYw,"Yeah I know we are in Las Vegas and I choose a California restaurant, what can I tell you it looked so good from the street we decided to check it out.  I am sooooo glad we did it was really worth it.

First the ambiance is great, we even sat outside in 95 degree weather because it was that nice.  The inside turned out to be amazing, with these supremely high ceilings and modern decor.  The staff AWESOME...

We ordered Queso Fundido (cheese dip) with chorizo and the Beef Flautas as starters.  There was so much food in front of us I knew we had over ordered again.  The Fundido was fabulous, ooey, gooey and tasty.  It is served with fresh tortillas in a warmer, excellent.  The Beef Flautas were not my fav, the beef was dry from being cooked and then fried, but the green sauce it's served with was amazing, oh so tasty.  For lunch we ordered the Chicken Fajitas and the Chicken Limon.  Each entree has a choice of soup or salad, we chose one of each.  The salad was very light and the house dressing was very refreshing.  The soup was a black bean soup with creme and oaxaca cheese, this was slightly spicy, very tasty and worth coming in for a repeat visit.  Hubby did not feel his fajitas were spiced properly, he said they were lacking in flavor.  My Chicken Limon was a little dry, but it was excellent in flavor.  The mashed potatoes it was served on were definitely worth coming back for too.

All in all we have found a new place we will be spending our money at as often as we can.  OH YEAH, how can I forget the margaritas were the BOMB, really perfectly made.

4491412,2012-01-22,0,8pLlsYgvrC5SJL1Con8FYw,"This is a beautiful restaurant with a romantic looking patio area. It was too chilly to sit outside though. When you walk to the entrance the sound of water fountains automatically sets you in a relaxing mood. The interior is nicely decorated with wood, stone and a water wall above the bar. 

We started off with the Chips and Guacamole ($9.00). It has a nice chunky consistency to it. The taste level was good but it wasn't the best I've had. The best Guacamole I've had locally would be just down the street at Islands Burgers. 

I also ordered their Tortilla soup ($7.00) to warm up. It was not only visually appealing but I liked the way it tasted. It was a little salty for my taste but still was really good. It had chicken, Guajillo Chiles, Tortilla Strips, Queso Fresco, avocado,  crema, small piece of roasted corn, little pieces of radishes. It was also topped with a sliver of a lemon which was great because I love lemon. After I finished the soup it was nice to eat the little piece of corn on the cob because it was sweet. 

I wanted something exciting and new to eat so I chose the Shrimp and Mango Enchiladas ($18.00). It had Mexican cheeses, shrimp, mango, and  mole sauce. That was delicious! The big disappointment was with the sides. I told the server that I didn't want any beans at all. When my entree comes out  I see beans! I was thinking about sending it back until I tried the rice.The rice was green and hard. It was hard like Uncle Ben's Rice and tasted very bland. I ended up not eating both sides. I think the sides should be an added treat to the meal. Having both sides that didn't taste good made the price of the entree a rip off. I would want to eat this enchilada again but not if it wasn't sold ala carte or if I couldn't choose from different sides. 

We did a Yelp check in which had an offer for a free dessert. I chose the Tres Leches Cake . It's normally priced at $7.00. My husband said he wasn't going to eat it. This is the first time I saw Tres Leche with berries so of course my husband decided to eat it after all! It wasn't what I was expecting but still very good. 

I think they should definitely offer an a la carte menu or a menu where the sides can be mixed and matched with the entrees. I know that Wahoo's is opening in the same complex soon and they offer a mix and match menu of Mexican food.

5632541,2011-09-25,0,8pLlsYgvrC5SJL1Con8FYw,"First, let me address the name issue... there was already a ""Hotel California"" in Las Vegas, so that became an issue.  

Now I have to mention how incredibly friendly the entire staff is!  
The first time I was here for the cigar lounge.  The good: It was very comfortable, and it is a great place to have a few (drinks/cigars).  There are several tvs and plenty of comfy chairs and sofas in there.  The four exhaust fans clear the smoke out very well.  However, the cigar selection is not great.  Not a problem, there is a cigar shop in the same area of the shopping center.  

On my second visit I went to the cigar room again, but also spent some time on the patio.  The service was great!  We had some appetizers and they were tasty and fresh.  Misting system and fresh guac makes a great patio set up.  Also, my date really liked the sangria. 

(This was from my June, 2011 review while it was still called Hotel California.)

I have been back a number of times and admittedly spend most of my time in the cigar lounge.  I have to say the staff has been very friendly each time I've been there.   Grab a drink and light a stick, enjoy.",5lOtqU-BVcGdangJNy9kXw,2,1,4,uKEKOWTedVRPPJe0zHHQCw
5902361,2012-01-23,0,8pLlsYgvrC5SJL1Con8FYw,"I would love to be able to give Baja California a better rating than three stars, but I can't.  

What's to like?  A lot, it turns out.  On the site of the former Hannah's, followed by a seafood joint for a brief moment in time, this place is spacious and beautiful.  The patio is fabulous, though it was way too cold to be of use now.  There is a cigar lounge with comfy chairs and sofas, tv, and a powerful ventilation system, so all of us addicts don't have to freeze our asses off in the aforementioned patio.  And best of all, the restaurant turns into a Latin nightclub on Friday and Saturday nights, with a live band and a large dance floor.  Unfortunately, on this Friday night, the Latin band would play for 20 minutes, then take an hour break.

We were seated immediately and were attended to a server-trainee, but the regular waiter was with him.  The menu touted their house-made Sangria, with it's ""secret ingredients,"" so we decided to go with that.  Even though the waiter affirmed that, yes, it did have liquor added to it, it turned out to taste perfectly ordinary, no better than what's in a Yago bottle.  I also ordered it without ice, and got half a glass.  Much worse, though, was that the menu was a combined food/drink one, and PRINTED in the regular menu, in bold letters, it proclaimed ""Two for One Drinks,"" anytime.  Not a card on the table, as a special promo.  Not a chalkboard special.  Just the regular, everyday policy.  We had a restaurant.com certificate, and when we got the bill, we were dismayed to see that we were charged for four drinks instead of two.  The manager was adamant and unyielding, reading from the certificate about how it's not valid with any other promos.  BUT THIS WAS NOT A PROMO!!  And she wouldn't budge.  But she did offer to bring us a Tres Leches dessert, which we didn't really want or need.  More about that later.

Some things are really strange here, foodwise.  First, the Queso Fundido appetizer.  I've spent a lot of time in Mexico, and the hallmark of this dish is the spicy chorizo blended with the melted cheese.  In this restaurant, the chorizo is listed as a $2.50 upcharge.  It's not Queso Fundido without that chorizo, so why not just make that the default and raise the price?

There was a choice of soup or salad with our main courses.  We're both nuts about Tortilla Soup, so we opted for that.  It was a very thin broth, but tasted very good, except for the chicken pieces, which I swear came from the same Costco chicken can I'd put in our salads at home the night before.  The chef passing by  swore that it was fresh chicken.  You'll have to be the judge.

I ordered the Shrimp Fajitas, and that's when it really turned to Planet Jupiter.  The sizzling shrimp came out on the standard platter, and there were a surprisingly large amount of shrimp, surrounded by the usual pepper and onion suspects.  But where was the pico de gallo, the sour cream, or any of the other accompaniments that always come with fajitas, like a bit of guacamole  ""Oh, we don't serve fajitas that way here, but I can bring you those things.""  Most incredibly, the tortillas were 4"" babies.  One shrimp, no peppers or onions or anything, and I couldn't even fold it over!  My exclamations to the waiter had him bringing out burrito-sized monster tortillas that were way too big.  I just don't get it.  And the shrimp, though plentiful, tasted a bit weird and were overcooked.  Hubby ordered the Pollo in Red Mole, which we were unfamiliar with, so we were given a taste.  It was just like the usual brown mole, but much thinner.  He got some rice along with it, but no beans and no garnish.  He did like his chicken, though.

Meanwhile, the restaurant had gotten significantly more crowded, and our trainee was nowhere to be found.  When we were at last able to flag down the waiter who'd been training him, he explained that it was the guy's first day, and he sent him home because he was exhausted.  But that made the service very slow, because our waiter was all over the place, doing it all.  He sure did stay cheerful, though, so props to him for that.

Finally, the Tres Leches was okay, but nothing special.  It wasn't soaked enough, and I found it a little bitter.  Again, hubby liked it, but he's a lot easier to please!

Yelpers note:  You will not get your free dessert if you check in and also have a coupon.  But that IS a promo, so I can't really complain about that.

Will we go back?  I'm not sure.  I'm a Latin music freak, so I loved that part of it, and despite the cliche, I'm a firm believer that you really CAN eat the atmosphere.  Maybe in Spring, when the patio is livable.",m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,2,0,3,tjN48aRcQ-JXZratU-C4Mg
