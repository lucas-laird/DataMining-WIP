I was the only person in the restaurant at the time and I stood for a few minutes waiting for someone to come up and greet me. I saw them in the back eating and chatting and they looked at me a few times. After standing at the front for 10 minutes and no ""hi"" or no ""be with you"" or even a ""Go away we don't wanna serve you"" I asked one of the workers how they were doin and as soon as I said it he turned his head and started speaking in Spanish to someone in the drive through! I've never been so completely disrespected in my life, this isn't the first time these people have been rude as they seem to have something against you if you look Hispanic but don't address them in Spanish. I finally ended up just walking out after 15 minutes of standing there like an idiot and 3 more minutes of just plain disbelief. As someone who also works in food service I can't believe this establishment would allow people like this to work in their store and represent them. I'm so disgusted. When I got back in the car my daughter asked me why I didn't have food and I had to tell her "" I guess we will go somewhere else, these guys don't want to serve me"".

1042722,2014-07-20,1,PxoBae2DdxirOTdwRIsb2g,"Delicious, Hot, Mexican Goodness! For being a small shop, they go BIG at Don Tortaco. I'm not gonna lie, I can barely walk right now. The burritos are epic and stuffed full of meat and veggies, and the sauces provided inside (haven't gone through the drive-through yet) are exquisite. The gal who took our order spoke perfect English and was very friendly.
Now my one gripe is with their chicken burrito. It tastes great, but they for some reason take two big pieces of chicken breast and just stuff them in there, which makes it very difficult to eat! If you order this I strongly recommend asking them to slice that chicken up a bit first.
They have ala carte items that range from $4-$6 or combo plates (very filling), of which most are about $8 after tax. Very modestly priced because the dishes are, despite being a fast-food type joint, easily $16 restaurant quality.
Up to this point I have seen what appear to be some very unfair reviews, and I must say that I strongly disagree with them. If you are a good person with a positive attitude who just happens to live in Southern Highlands (maybe by accident? fate?), and you like Mexican food, this place is worth a fair shot.

The drive thru is not very well lit besides the menus and its a very quite and vacant area when you pull in. I wanted to just test the place out so i didn't order anything to big or crazy. I Went with just 3 Carne Asada Tacos.

I pulled up to the window. The guy took my money i think about $8.50 and i proceeded to wait a good 5 minutes at the window. I Have no problem waiting cause usually that means its made when its ordered. Order came up and i told the guy i want red and green sauce and jalapenos. He looked at me and said very matter of factly YES OK.. Was kinda funny.

So i get home thinking they are probably going to be some wimpy little tacos, As i open the box i'm amazed at the huge size of these things! Loaded with lots of meat, pico de gallo and guacamole. They tasted as good as they looked and i will definitely be back. I'll remember to take a picture next time. i just wanted to dig right in!!",f4NdDEdefqJWe7MRMUDnig,1,0,5,YWQ1-I8A4lsihufR_Z16bg

Right when we got there, my boyfriend and his roommate immediately started joking around about the name and about how catchy it was. We went inside and only saw one guy working. I think he was the only one handling everything, such as cashier, drive-thru, cooking the food, etc. It took him a while to get back to us and get our order but I really think i's because he was the only one handling everything and there was someone in the drive-thru when we got there. Anyhow, he got back to us, my boyfriend and I ordered a chicken chimichanga, and about 10 minutes later, it came out. I should've taken a picture, but it was delicious. What was different was that the tortilla was like deep-fried or something I believe. It was crunchy and the chicken was so soft and moist. Really good food!
The environment was very friendly. The walls are painted bright green, bright orange, and bright yellow which made it much more welcoming. And a plus is that it was not cold in there, the temperature was perfect. (It is always cold in Roberto's and the people working there were always giving us looks like they didn't want to be there and they didn't want us to be there....) Here, though, he seemed to be the only worker, he was working late, and he was still friendly to us.

Second- YELPERS BEWARE OF THIS BUSINESS! We've ordered from this place a couple times, always by drive-thru. Here and there they would mess up our order, and I concur with the other reviews about a sassy lady at the drive-thru window. But being that it is cheap food, we didn't complain.

Last night was the last straw, and the last time we are going to any Don Tortaco. 

Husband ordered, and paid the ""lady"" $30.25. The total was actually $21.25 but he only had a $20 bill and a $10 bill, and he gave the cashier 25 cents so that his change would just be bills. Handed the said lady the cash and the quarter and she closed the door. Of course my husband waited and stared at her. He also noticed that the cashier DID NOT put the money in the drawer, but off to the side. So he waited, and then the cashier opened the window and asked if he needed anything else. Husband responds, ""yeah I need my change, $9. SHe then proceeded to state that he shouldn't have any change because according to her, he gave her the exact amount. Again my husband said no, I gave you $30.25, so I need my $9 change. Cashier again said and tried to argue with my husband, until she called someone and this person then counted the money and gave the change to my husband. 

Okay we get it, when people give you more than the total, and then give you change, it's kinda tricky isn't it? But you're a cashier and I'm pretty sure your job is to count the money you're receiving, and then PUT IT IN YOUR DRAWER, NOT set it aside. I can only imagine how many customers this person has done it to. People tend to just grab their food and go, and heck I don't even count my change at times.
