304400,2016-09-16,0,Sv0mCDEF0-V-HGR0nk5Egg,DO NOT GAMBLE HERE. For starters the odds are at the lowest level allowable which means winning isn't likely. On top of that I went in on graveyard and a bartender named Brian was working...I had gambled around $200 and was told I would have to be charged for my next beer...WOW..now I don't blame Brian as he explained how ignorant the owners were when it came to gaming knowledge. Bottom line I'm not playing $200 to have to then also pay for a beer...owners don't get it..just another example of someone who shouldn't own a bar with gaming. Won't be back.

I expect to be raped at the House of Blues like that , but not a neighborhood bar. I wanted to love the place , great kitchen,  friendly bartenders, door guy was a sweetheart. Just need to be more reasonable with those beer prices. Id rather have a few extra bucks to buy some merch from a few of the cool bands!",XNl-wIhklnH2n3h8EKY-GQ,0,0,2,1ZVESSSOcGB9R5fQksMQkA

1050053,2014-03-21,0,Sv0mCDEF0-V-HGR0nk5Egg,"This Review is based their food, as I had heard some good things from friends about this place.  I have been living in the neighborhood for almost a year, and hadn't taken opportunity to check it out, so I put my foot down.  After looking at the menu on-line, I decided to keep it simple~ Pub food is an art... Simple fare, simple ingredients, assembled with a little love~
""The house hamburger adding cheese"" (Comes with fries or tortilla chips)  was the metric I would use to gauge this joint~
The atmosphere was cool enough~ The lady at the bar was perfect, and the people that run the exposed kitchen were all super nice~  The mural behind the bar could only be improved with a hallucinogen!  
The fellow that took my order was so refreshing!  When he asked my preference of cheese on the burger, I responded ""American is fine"", to which he responded, ""Good Choice!"" LOL~ 
Back to food~ So as I watch the lady squash every last bit of juice out of the patty on the flat top, flipping the patty @ 50 times~LOL~ I was already dreading it~ 
On a positive note, I asked for my burger ""Medium"", and it wasn't over done~
They put tons of lettuces, a pile of red onion, (sliced in the most peculiar way for a hamburger... from the end, in strips?) and what appeared to be a tiny end slice of tomato on the burger.  No dressing present, I had to ask for mayo after the fact~
One more thing I though was odd~ They put the bun on the flat top to toast it, but the outside of the bun~ (Not the part that should be toasted!) LOL~ 
They serve a generous portion of ""Fresh cut fries"", which is great, if you know how to cook them~ But, they do it from the slicer, straight into the hot oil, and as the moisture escapes the potato, all the oil is soaked up~ Limp, soaked with oil, and kind of burned~
So, cool pub, (I'll go back) nice people, but 0% technique in the simplest sandwich on the menu~ (Almost like you dropped someone in from a different ""Planet"", and set them up with ingredients, and said, ""Make the classic American Sandwich!""~
Oh, the next review for them will be their new BBQ on the menu~ They were running a couple of ""Oil Barrel"" BBQ's on a trailer out front~ I would have tried that first, but I was afraid I might be too critical!",zq6x1AKzX2GhK2mFi8wK6g,1,1,2,Rgqkad8SujQgwL8By6GAHg
1145702,2017-11-05,0,Sv0mCDEF0-V-HGR0nk5Egg,"I have been out of the electronic scene for some time. I lived my 20's in the Bay Area and fell in love with both music and its accompanying culture. I entered a ""musical desert"" in my early 30's, that took me away from this genre. In any case, this desert wander has stumbled on this oasis, known as ""The Hard Hat Lounge."" Music line up for that night, for those interested in checking out their music online, to see if this venue plays stuff you like is here:

https://www.residentadvisor.net/events/1031838

By and large, I was pleased with what they were playing. Having as I said been out of the scene for a bit, I am going to hold off trying to categorize the overall music. Terms like ""Progressive House"" could well get me crucified by the music police out there!...But that is what I THINK, I remember what the term sounded like. 

Acoustically, they had a REALLY good sound system. Both in and outside the venue where there are some tables and seats for you to chill. Well if you could stop dancing for a sec. Sometimes the session was just too good! 

Clientele-wise, the demo graph (based on this night) is early 20's. With a few outliers (like me). Which I HOPE does not mean I will not find a scene here in Las Vegas that is geared to us older partiers! But back to the topic, You will see all the classic stuff associated with this genre; very cute women spinning/twirling/throwing led glowing hula hoops, dudes with other light emitting devices, but in both cases worth a moment of your time to check out. Some of the performers were quite skilled, I was impressed.

Interior was, as expected very divey, but certainly not the worst I have seen. Hell, some people like it that way though, seedier the better you know? So to each there own. The important thing was that I felt safe enough to enjoy myself. 

I guess the only negative to the evening was the food that they got at the little kitchen. Not a problem if you want a burger or some similar bar food. But I guess it kinda bugged me that the $12 Korean ""Bulgogi"" plate they had, didn't come with the kimchi it listed (they ran out), didn't come with a cucumber salad (it was a lettuce salad with some pickles), and it didn't actually have any bulgogi meat.. it was hamburger meat (see this link for what bulgogi looks like:

Which I guess some might not care (I was hungry so I didn't much). There is a fine line between marketing and lying I know, but I felt compelled to call BS on this one! Other than that, not a bad venue.",FqjbgAoZ2tZSaw80_2rZew,0,0,3,PePckgYVsIvZPVNQLh2uLg

& let me tell you.... 
This place impressed the H E double hockey sticks out of me. Drinks were pretty cheap and the crowd was pretty friendly. The girl at the kitchen can make some meaaaan food. 
Also they had live music, & they happen to have this school bus that was converted into a stage/dj booth. It was the absolute coolest thing and very unexpected for a small dive bar downtown. 

I later found out that the hard hat is managed by the same guy that used to run the Bunkhouse. And anyone knows that bunkhouse was the place to be before.

With that, I'll say that they're definitely heading in the right direction and become one of the best dive bars in the area.  The weakest link, which was their lack of good food, has finally been fixed.  If you're into flavorful burgers, look no further.  Their menu has a little something for every random craving such as a selection of grilled cheeses,  several bar appetizers, and even dessert like Carrot cake or Funky Monkey.  
     Add to the food their hosting of live local bands and great djs and you'll find yourself becoming a regular in no time!!!",lDkHgAdZhxH93IaAfEZnKw,2,2,5,eYoLxmjNrUVfXYsCaipulw

2220826,2014-08-09,1,Sv0mCDEF0-V-HGR0nk5Egg,"Talk about another dive bar in Vegas. The Hard Hat Lounge not doubt would qualify cause not only does it scream dive bar. The surrounding neighborhood off of industrial not exactly the most pretty of all places, not much parking, and the apartment building nearby does not exactly make you feel comfortable leaving car out on the road. One must never judge book by its cover. Once you get inside little surprise to find that it had own sense of style. It definitely still goes with my dive bar list. It not very big bar to begin with you have one long bar area, and few bar tables in the middle. The drinks not much comes to selection of draft beers (not sure since Bobby Yang Unrivaled Players performing but all drinks were being served in plastic cups. No glasses at bar?? Dive. Not sure if daily special but that night running $3 PBR and some mixed up fruity shot added dollar. Again screams dive bar. The decor at times looked tacky all around but definitely gave it personality. They do have service kitchen nothing special just your normal bar food from burgers, salad, and fried foods. I can tell you looking at the kitchen (some things that would make health inspector freak out) I would be scared to order food. I came here support YELP family Misti and Bobby. Booby Yang and Unrivaled Players. Not about the food. 

In the back area have small stage set up for bands. At times had some sound check issues. Overall for tiny place felt like the sound was pretty good. Room for concert goers it nightmare. Really truth its bar not concert venue. Yelp family we packed it in. Tiny dance area if call one in front of the stage. The service both bartenders were great staying on my drinks. 

Overall since out of my way and really nothing special about the place will stick with my normal waterholes. If they have great band playing would come back again.",iSC96O2NjQc3JExGUHQG0Q,1,1,3,W_NRoWaz-vZCoVlHN9H4kg

I wouldn't necessarily call the Hard Hat Lounge a dive bar since it's not divey at all.  There's a small stage located at the corner of the bar.  You really can't miss it since the lounge is so small.  Drinks are comped if you're dropping at least $20 in the video poker machines.  In the mood for a burger?

4251160,2016-04-18,4,Sv0mCDEF0-V-HGR0nk5Egg,"I came here recently for their open mic night. Really this review is about the ambience on that evening, perhaps it is not the best assessment because I disliked the entertainment so much. The bar itself is cool, small but homey. Have a couple of beers on tap, nothing too fancy. But the comedy that night left much to be desired. The comics started around 9ish; pretty much all of them white males. The majority of the jokes centered around sex and women. I think these men are what one would call 'man child', as their jokes really were very immature. Don't get me wrong, I am a very open-minded individual and feel that comedy in this country tends to be very politically correct. But a lot of the jokes I heard that night were about domestic violence, attacks against minority groups, etc. There was also an abundance of pedofilia and priest jokes. And interestingly enough, a lot of talk about abortions (might I have found some supporters that night?). This will sound harsh, but it seems like these men are afraid of women. Not one made eye contact with me and I am not an intimidating person. We stook around for a good two hours because we just couldn't get over what was happening. 

I will be back because I've heard that their live music nights are cool. And the bartender that evening, Tracy, was very, very nice.",Se3XL5Opy0e2cHbxxjs2ZQ,4,4,3,f0TTnOb3FkUPBU5_uKOKdg

4529703,2016-01-23,2,Sv0mCDEF0-V-HGR0nk5Egg,"This place is a typical divey, small Las Vegas bar with gaming machines. It was comfortable place to pull up a stool at the bar and grab a beer. 
They have about 20 stool seats at the bar and a few high top tables in the middle of the room. They have outside seating too. There is even a few seats along the wall at a high bar like table. They have a small stage in the corner of the room. 
Smokilicious is the new BBQ restaurant now located inside opposite the bar. 
I ordered a Joseph James lager on tap while I was waiting for my BBQ order. 
They only have a few beers on tap, but I just happen to be there when a beer rep came in, so I got to sample about 5 or 6 new beers.  That was cool and yummy!
The staff was welcoming, friendly and attentive. 
I like this little spot and would definitely come back.",-50XWnmQGqBgEI-9ANvLlg,7,4,4,D6Sl1uy9TvkD_vZd33RpFw

Jess the bartender was really nice, knew all about the beers on tap and the menu, made our stop for a quick beer a memorable one.  Great stories about all the places she lived, worked, life and we just had a blast.  This is now our first stop when we roll into Vegas.  Then we grubbed down on the Bulgogi and Jamaican burgers made to perfection by LBC native and Filipino chef Paul, don't let him tell you he is any other ethnicity (inside joke)...  Bottom line, if you're feeling a beer in a super friendly, local bar where they make you feel like a life long customer, stop by and say hello to Jess & Paul... Cheers

There was a DJ playing some noises that sounded like annoying screeching, like a cat in a grinder (and I even like dub step music!). The bartender was nice though, made us a decent drink. Gambling was not so good. This place needs to make up its mind. If it's a dive bar, no trendy laser and DJ shows. If it's hip, advertise it as so!",ObQl16Vuc4sHPGKtzSGNUw,1,0,2,XXcP90QbZBrooPu398PwHw

I dropped into the HH after a night out for one last drink, that turned into two.  We were practically the only people in the bar (I hear that is common).  The bartenders were super friendly (and they give you snacks!).  They no longer serve food from their kitchen, but they do have some chips and stuff to purchase if the pretzels and goldfish crackers aren't to your liking.  Drinks were cheap ($7/round for Jameson + 7&7)! Plus one star because I won $50 playing Deuces Wild.  Seriously though,if you're into low key dive bars where you can just sit with a friend (or lovahhh) and just booze it up and talk, this is perfect.

When we sat down and ordered I overheard his friends say ""what is this now a gay bar?"" And they left shortly after. I can imagine this what black people must of heard and felt like back in the day. The bartender was nice enough, and I didn't feel like confronting the other two.  It's a decent bar, and we would have loved to stay longer to gamble and play the juke box, but just didn't feel welcome. I'm sure they have base and loyal clients, but not welcoming to strangers.

5727184,2010-11-23,1,Sv0mCDEF0-V-HGR0nk5Egg,"The Hard Hat lounge is a typical, traditional bar. It still has a kitchen-but since the smoking law came into affect a few years ago, the oven is idle. On the border of a sketchy neighborhood (the once fantastic Naked City), I had never had an issue visiting this bar. At nights you have to get buzzed in, but once you are in the mood is sedate and comfortable. A pool table exists in case you need more exercise than lifting your beer or your jack and coke! BUT--- the real star here is the mural by Frank ""Maverick"" Bowers from 1963.  The mural evokes more a feeling of 1956, than 63, but maybe The Maverick was stuck in his painting ways.  The legend has it that he painted the mural to pay off a bar tab (google his name and you may find more mentions of his doing this in other areas like Los Angeles).

And, accompanied by His Unrivaled Players, he did just that for appreciative Yelpers and other lounge regulars.  The narrow, small building barely fit in all attendees, but it did just manage to do so.  And feed us too!

My Montana Club (ham, turkey, bacon, chipotle, mayo, lettuce, tomato, and onions on sourdough bread) was large and very tasty--except somewhat overpowered by the spicy chipotle, which added too big a kick.  And I saw that the skin-on Fries were freshly deep-fried but they tasted unseasoned and rather dead.   

The two female bartenders were friendly and efficient; the mural painted on site in 1963 was eye catching; and the live sounds of Bobby Yang and His Unrivaled Players were well worth listening to live, enhanced by the interpretive dancing of past Las Vegas Yelp CM and now DJ Misti Y., and excellent acoustics.

This is a bar with character!
