My mother is a fan of this place and yeah maybe they were good way back when but they are awful. Here is my issue with this place first of all any and every time I have visited the level of service is ridiculous. The employee's here obviously hate the job they have. My most recent experience was enough for me to say I'll never return. What is most interesting is that they constantly market themselves by putting these coupons in the mail but not being able to honor more than half of them. The story is that they are not a ""full service"" Long John Silvers. This was explained to me by the rude young man who was already full of attitude before we even began to order. With that being said they only offer select items and not the ones that may be available at a full service location. That's all fine and dandy but let's make sure that it's properly disclosed on the coupon. If you are thinking about going through the drive thru, forget about it they only service KFC orders. You have to physically walk in to place an order for Long John's. How much sense does this make? Do better or just simply close down. The food is subpar and I can't believe how expensive they are. I feel like I'd be better off going to the grocery store frozen food aisle and buying some Van De Kamp fish fillets or hell even some Gorton's fish sticks....",qPVtjjp8sNQ32p9860SR9Q,8,4,1,3Yf9-bDjeaiOTCortW0mRQ

So I get there and its one where  KFC and LJS have combine the 2 stores. I placed my order for the cod and shrimp meal. When I got my order home I was fairly disappointed, because my order consist of half LJS and half of KFC products. If I wanted KFC I would have ordered KFC. This what was inside my box of LJS 1pc of cod,4 shrimp,2 hushpuppies, KFC potatoe wedges(fries), and KFC cole slaw instead of LJS (coleslaw). The food had a taste of KFC instead of LJS, like they cooked the food in same fashion as KFC. So my advice is you might not want to order LJS from this establishment unless changes are made for the LJS to give out its own product with their food and get their own taste back.",pVzlYQ9Kp6tczj3weAwKBw,1,0,1,0azVAWTHcaV5cvG2y70QfQ

Lazy employees didn't want to make extra pieces of chicken. The restaurant was filthy with old food, drinks, trash, and napkins all over the tables and floor. The trash cans were not usable and had a note written on them that read ""Do Not Use"". 
Food was greasy and disgusting. 

This place needs a health inspection. No wonder people mark this restaurant as ""closed"".

The lady behind me asked if my order was wrong and said hers was also from another time. I had to ask about a cashier and she came. No tarter sauce either. That was just extremely disappointing.

He was very patient and knowledgeable of the menu. The food was extremely quick and when I got home it was so fresh. The girl that I picked the food up from was polite and asked me if she could get me anything else. The only disappointment is that it's a LJS Express so you have to get KFC wedges as fries. I'm not sure why everyone is complaining about not being able to order by drive thru. I understand why they do that and I'm more than willing to get out of my car for hot, crispy fish.

DO NOT GO HERE. Especially if you're hungry or suspect you have low blood sugar. You will most likely die waiting for your food. I could feel myself aging while waiting for my to go order.

None of the orders were right. First they argued the order was correct but when the manager compared the receipt to the order even he couldn't match it up. He offered to remake everything but said it would be another 2 minutes.  It was three simple orders. We just ate what we had. Won't be back.

First of All, they have a drive thru with a LJS sign indicating to order, then they tell you nope sorry you have to come inside for fish. If this were the only complaint I would ignore the stupidity, but sadly it isn't. You walk inside and the floor is noticeably sticky meaning uncleaned. Trash laying around and pretty rude service! Lots of blank stares in response to simple things like how many pieces are in a family pack....its not shown on the menu, you'd think asking an employee would get you the answer but nope! The true saving grace is that I love LJS and I wish this wasn't the only location within 10 miles from my house. My favorite part is that I arrived at 8.00pm, received my order in about 25 minutes leaving before 9 at night, to have a rather annoyed looking gentleman practically shove us out of the building and lock up the door and started closing up shop when their hours state open until 11....lazy, rude, and needlessly tiresome.

I felt really gross sitting there, I should've left, but there are only TWO LJS locations in Vegas and both are horrible, its sad really. The food was hot but also over done, and the sides are KFC sides and not the LJS sides, I wish they would have a stand alone place instead of sharing with KFC, and also how sanitary is it when you see the staff preparing food and also washing and scrubbing the floors for the evening (I guess to speed up the clean up process) but I definitely will NOT be coming back here again.
