The six of us went here to try it out since our usual place has went down hill. The pricing is very good, although they don't have any all you can eat. Most of the rolls are half price! We all ordered about 5 minutes after getting here...keep this in mind. After about 30 minutes, our first rolls began to arrive. We did not see our server for this entire time. And we each got one roll. By the time we finished our first rolls, our second rolls began to arrive, which was fine. But 2 of us at the table ordered chicken teriyaki bowls, and 40 minutes in, they had yet to be seen.  So the two of them sat there with no food for this whole time so far. 

At the hour mark, we finally mentioned something the next time we saw somebody, our server was still missing. They said sorry, and that none were being made as they didn't know they were ordered. After being here for about an hour and 15 minutes, finally they brought out the bowls, but one was chicken and one was beef (Again wrong). We didn't want to deal with it, so we just ate that. They also forgot two of our rolls that we ordered and had to bring it up. Throughout the entire service, our server was seen only once or twice, and that was mostly towards the end. We waited long wait times for refills on drinks, and someone at our table who ordered the ""meal"" didn't receive the soup or desert promised as a part of the meal. When we got our check, we were amazed to see that they had added 18% gratuity automatically, when we hadn't seen our server at all the whole time. We complained and they took the tip off, and another 10% off the bill for the troubles. The manager was nice about it and seemed sincerely sorry. 

While we were there, one of the other tables just got up and left before getting their food. And the table behind us was receiving the wrong items. This place needs to get their act together, or they won't be in business long. The food tastes great, but we will not be returning due to the horrible service.",LChvA_6Yb1qOFDnQpKEdjw,0,0,2,nqG4OlBqXv4_nujLTAShMQ
92442,2012-07-04,3,8bZ49zy4KlFVu5teFETYhQ,"Third time's NOT a charm!  We have eaten here three times and it was only busy the second time we were there. First time we were there we ordered cooked entrees and it was pretty good.  Price seemed reasonable even with a bottle of wine. Second time we ordered specialty rolls and beer.  Again, reasonable and tasted good. However, our experience this last time (Monday night) was really bad.  We decided to just have a couple of glasses of wine instead of a bottle.  They were out of our first choice which left only a more expensive option by the glass.  It wouldn't have been that big of a deal except when she delivered the wine the glasses were only about 1/3 full.  And the glasses were already small.  My guess is that the glasses were 8 oz. in size and there was about 2.5 oz of wine in them!  I'm accustomed to a more generous pour, so we challenged our server.  She said that it was a half of a glass and it was what they normally pour. This was $10 a glass!  We were really unhappy but sucked it up because we were hungry.  The tempura was good, but the yellowtail lovers roll was chewy.  We also ordered mackerel sashimi which we hadn't tried here yet but we normally love when we've had it elsewhere. In a word, it was AWFUL!  My guess is that it was stale and they had to cover it up with some funky sauce.  We couldn't finish it because it was so bad.  We asked for the manager but we were told he wasn't there.  We asked for consideration because of the bad experience but the server wasn't interested in helping us at all.  Our bill was $50+ and we left hungry. Never going back.",Wt86cS0w4_BTA0Ij-v2ljg,1,0,1,jgjT8tAKsyUe4tToanjUMQ

I know it can be very difficult to prove exactly where someone gets food poisoning, but I was able to deduce that my 24 hours of torture was due to some not so good sushi from Go Wild.  However, food poisoning isn't actually my complaint....

I called the restaurant to make them aware of the situation.  I meant it only as a head's up for them.  I wasn't looking to get anything out of it.  First, the waitress was completely patronizing and frankly just rude on the phone as was the manager.  Here's the big deal....

The waitress told me I would need to provide them a doctor's note regarding my food poisoning because they get calls from people at least twice a week with the same problem.  Um???

The sashimi comes in an ice packed oversized martini glass. Also had  live jazz. Always enjoy a place where the chefs are having fun. Lots of toasting and laughing. Nice place to hang with your friends. Prices reasonable. Its can get a bit loud when the bands going. Not a bad place to bring kids since there is so much going on and you don't have to worry about their noise so much. Also awesome giant tvs everywhere so you can watch events.

I am going to start my review of Go Wild Sushi with the incredible service.  I came here on Wednesday afternoon around 4 pm.  I walked in carrying an arm load of books ( I am in the Nursing program at CSN) and was promptly greeted by a man who I think was the owner.  I told him it was just me and that I was there to eat and get lots of studying done.  He sat me in my own section away from the middle of the room where it was a bit noisy.  He took my drink and appetizer order and before I knew it, it was sitting in front of me!  My water was refilled often and they allowed me to delay my order for a bit.  Towards the end of my dining experience,  I over heard my waitress tell the next waitress ( I was there through the shift change) not to bother me too much as I was trying to study, but refill my water often!  Really, what 5 star service!  I will be here often between my classes just for the service!

Oh yeah, the food was great too!  The salmon sashimi comes in this huge martini glass and tastes wonderfully fresh.  I also order a spicy tuna which I wasn't crazy about but sometimes it can just be too spicy!  They have so many rolls it's mind boggling!   The menu has dinners, noodles, and many other traditional dishes.  I can't wait to try more!",Ig4MBERqYl9fSjQRYSWOlA,6,4,5,_9fcUVM8PkJ08XLS6B2mSA

Even though I didn't know that, I asked my husband if he wants to dine in and we decided we will and we told the hostess we will dine in and she sighed and rolled her eyes. After that, I just wanted changed my mind completely and she said it was no problem and that she can seat me right now but I wasn't up for it anymore. I rather go to Yummy Grill and Sushi.

At first I was skeptical - I was thinking they were going to go the used car sales route and jack up the prices by 50% and then claim, ""oh hey let me give you a really great discount deal.""  But in all reality, I think the quality of sushi that they provide is more than fairly priced at 50% off. Las Vegas Roll ($7)  and then there was this other roll that came with a jalapeno and was freshly spicy...i forget what it was. 

Anyways, this place has extremely affordable sushi with some of the best customer service I've had at a restaurant. The waitresses are very kind and well-mannered and the sushi chef was interactive. Just about every patron that left that night gave the chefmaster a high five or fist bump. It seems like this place has a very loyal customer base and the employees take good care of their patrons. 

Highly recommended....especially if you want to watch the game....unless there is no game, then you'll be sitting there watching a 1997 women's sand volleyball game on espn classic pretending to be interested.",6p1NDChnIpGl29Ce3cMKWg,6,3,4,GMseP7FkMFOkOTLENmg74Q

On occasion, I can be convinced to go to a non-AYCE, if it's really, really good or I can find a bargain. In this case, I had a Groupon for Go Wild Sushi.

Let's start with the nigiri. In a word - awesome. The salmon, super white tuna, and yellowtail were fresh and tasted wonderful.

Then came the rolls. The rolls are half off, all day, every day. Except when a coupon is involved. It is posted somewhere (according to the waitress) but I didn't see it. Fortunately, they were very nice and only charged one of my three rolls at full price, and the rest at half. I didn't even have to ask. What great service.

Speaking of service, it was awesome. My water glass was always full, someone was always coming by and checking on us, and, in generaly, they were just super nice.

The restaurant had a nice ambiance: upbeat music, dim lights, and pretty decor to look at. The booths were interesting, as they were all U-shaped. Even the smaller ones for two people. Not the curvy U's either, more the angular U's. I liked them - it created a ""deeper"" booth and a pseudo-intimate experience in a rather spacious restaurant.

I'll definitely be coming back again, sans the Groupon.",G-5DEYSYWv6aNss-YnKHmg,3,3,5,OEserL1y7d54pPVAMgUe4A

3491057,2011-09-13,6,8bZ49zy4KlFVu5teFETYhQ,"My brother and I went here yesterday because I bought the Living Social deal. The staff was very attentive from the moment I walked in and sat down (mostly because they were dead, on a Monday afternoon, too). The place was a decent size and looked nice and clean.

This is why Go Wild gets 2 stars from me:
When the waitress saw my Living Social deal ($20), she stated that it could not be used on any lunch specials or combination specials, which was fine because some restaurants have a ""catch"" to these deals. So, we decided to order a few regular-priced rolls that equaled (and was even more than) the amount of the deal. On top of that, we wanted to go ahead and get the lunch special anyway because the $20 amount was fulfilled. The waitress told us that we couldn't do this even though we were ordering more than the $20 worth of regular-priced sushi. It didn't make sense why they wouldn't let us order the lunch special after that, and the waitress should have asked her manager if it was okay, because in most DECENT restaurants that care about their customers, it would be.

Furthermore, the sushi was just okay.  We ordered tuna sashimi, the Japanese lasagna, the 007 roll, and vegetable tempura. Everything came out fine, nothing spectacular. This place has changed its name so many times since it has opened as a sushi restaurant; maybe because of poor management. I don't know. I wouldn't go here again because of the experience we had there.

3519480,2012-02-01,3,8bZ49zy4KlFVu5teFETYhQ,"I'm not a sushi purist. While I'd love to eat nothing but delicate cuts of sashimi and simple, well-crafted nigiri, my wallet dictates that I feast on rolls if I want a satisfying meal without spending a fortune. And I have no problem eating crazy, sauce-covered rolls that would horrify most Japanese and drive them to seppuku. 

My tastes are Americanized, afterall, so rolls are cool with me. Their specialty rolls are half price all day, every day. But, if you use a restaurant.com gift card like I did on my first visit you have to pay full-price for the rolls.

The rolls we've tried have all tasted good -- the Bonzai, Red Dragon, Spicy tuna crunch, Hawaiian, and Yellowtail cover rolls. But, are sometimes sloppily assembled. Having ordered some of the rolls twice, we noticed that they don't always come out the same. QA issues aside, I can't really complain because the food is relatively inexpensive.

The yellowtail with jalapeño ($13) was also solid. We ordered tuna sashimi ($12) but what they brought out was seared tuna with a bunch of crispy stuff on top. We tried telling the waitress it was wrong but she insisted that that was how they do it there. Right... I guess that's what they tell all the non-Asian looking folk. 

That brings me to my biggest gripe about this place -- the service. They're friendly, but slow. If you want a quick meal this is the last place you should go. Expect a long wait to have your order taken and even more time to go by before you get your food. If you want refills, think again. Even if the place is empty, which it was on both of our visits, you'll spend a good hour and a half or more eating there.

At least the place is comfy. The interior is quite spacious and they have a few large TVs scattered around in addition to a projection screen and a stage where there is occasionally live music. Large booths are scattered around the room, making your wait time somewhat more enjoyable.

Despite its flaws, it's a good place to get some rolls at a decent price if you're not in a hurry.

Before you get too excited, I gotta say the rushi rolls on the 50% off menu are about $3-5 over priced compare to other places.  So your  50% off is probably equivalent to 30% off, however, still a pretty good deal.  

The inside is a much bigger and fancier than it looks from the outside,  although I rarely see more than 3 tables occupied.  Because they don't have all-you-can-eat I've only ordered the special sushi rolls.  I liked everything, especially the Great White Shark roll and the Kiss of Fire roll, both spicy rolls.  The best thing about this place is that the rice on the rushi rolls is sooooo thin.  I guess that's a clever strategy by the chef to make you order more food.

I thought that the place was going to be a hole in the wall with good sushi dishes.

So, we dressed very casually. We drove to the shopping complex and it was new.

It was about 5:30 p.m. when we walked through the door.

Well, I was proven wrong. This place was absolutely wonderful and beautiful. We were very underdressed. It was a beautifully decorated. Every detail was not spared in designing this place. We loved the booths and the big screen wall TV that played amazing Jazz videos.

The menu was amazing. There was amazing detail and thought into the menu.

We order the following dishes:

Shrimp Yaki with mushrooms: good
Calamari: lightly breaded and the rings were big. Not burnt.
Baked Langostinos: THIS DISH WAS AMAZING! The langostinos were baked in an AMAZING sauce then poured over a sushi roll. I forgot what the Sushi roll was, but it WAS JUST AMAZING!
Tuna Sashimi and Garlic Sashimi: see photos posted. That was amazing! presentation was AMAZING! Fresh sashimi.

Note: The bathrooms were amazingly decorated with textured walls, floors, and fixtures.

Overall, they deserve all the press and word of mouth good news.

3974423,2012-05-02,0,8bZ49zy4KlFVu5teFETYhQ,"I've been having nigiri sushi lately and tonight I decided to have some rolls instead.  I've driven by Go Wild a number of times and I've seen their ad saying 50% off all rolls, all day, every day.  I generally shy away from places that may increase prices only to offer 50% off, but after reading the Yelp reviews, I decided to give Go Wild a try.

I ordered two rolls--the baked Langostino lobster on a California roll and the Kiss of Fire.  The menu describes the baked langostino roll as baked baby lobster, mushroom with dynamite sauce on Cali roll and the Kiss of Fire as Inside-Shrimp tempura, spicy shrimp, cucumber. Ouside-spicy soft shell crab, albacore, jalapeno topping, extra spicy ponzu sauce.

Both were excellent.  The presentation was great as any good sushi place should have.  The flavors of the lobster mixed with the California roll was very good.  The Kiss of Fire was aptly named.  It had spicy seasonings that gave it that kiss of fire, well a small fire.  I found that the rolls were so good the way they were that I used no soy sauce but merely used the wasabi.  I almost finished the portion they brought and almost asked for more so I could make more fire for myself.  As another reviewer said, they use a small amount of rice.  There isn't a huge amount used to make the roll look bigger than it is or to take the place of other ingredients.  

I had a few more rolls on my to try list, but I decided not to pig out but stop at the two and have some dessert.  I got an order of tempura red bean ice cream.  It was a pleasant ending to a good meal.  There were three servers circulating through the restaurant that wasn't very busy.  They were attentive and even after bringing the check, asked me if I wanted another iced tea.

I really liked the decor of the restaurant.  I'm not a fan of sitting at sushi bars, I've come to learn, so I sat at a table.  The music was reggae--odd for a sushi house--and the big screen TV had ESPN's Sports Nation.  It's amazing how good ESPN is when to you don't have to listen to a word of the drivel they're saying.  The TV was on mute so I watched the plays they were chatting about and tapped my feet  to the music.

I'll be back and try some of the other rolls.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,6,4,4,19dpIYeDejoXMLSH6eDEvw

The unagi and albacore was pretty fresh, but other than that the quality was good. Everything was just sooooo spicy, roll wise and I couldn't eat it! There's a pretty large selection of specialty rolls to choose from, but I am more a nigri person. Service was attentive as they weren't too busy on a rainy Thursday night. Overall, I think the bill came out to about 50 something bucks with the Living Social Deal taken out.

4267079,2012-04-04,1,8bZ49zy4KlFVu5teFETYhQ,"I really struggled with my overall rating of Go Wild Sushi & Grill. They've got some really strong positives going for them (really fresh fish, very reasonable prices, nice presentation of the food, clean and inviting decor), but some pretty irritatingly strong negatives, too (slowwww service, rude management). Go Wild Sushi could be extremely successful, if they improved on the ""people"" part of the equation, since they already have shown a knack for the ""business"" side.

They definitely earned 3 stars for the quality of their food (fresh, flavorful, artistically presented), price for the quality/quantity (very fair $11 sushi combo of 6 nigiri, California roll, spicy tuna roll, miso soup, and a side salad), and having a clean and attractive venue (freshly decorated, vaulted ceiling, big screen projection TV, and a killer jazz band on the weekends).

However, I have to knock off 2 big stars for their woefully inadequate people skills. Minus one star for the slow waitress #1, and the inattentive waitress #2 (yes, Go Wild Sushi seems to have a knack for switching up waitresses, as described in other Yelp reviews). And to top it off, the management was extremely rude, and it was obvious that they think their customers are completely gullible suckers. As I mentioned, the jazz band on the weekends is really good; I mean REALLY good. Good enough for me to want to go and pay to see them perform in a jazz club (like the awesome Anthology in San Diego, CA). So I ask waitress #2 if I could get any information regarding the band, like what the name of their band was, how I could contact them (either website, phone, or email, etc.). The waitress kindly went to the owner/manager to pass on my request, and I could see him give her a scowl and a frown, and said something at length to her. She came back and apologized, and said that the owner doesn't know how to contact the jazz band, that he doesn't know who they are, and they wouldn't pass my questions on to the band. However, the owner relayed that if I did like the band, I could only see them by coming in to the restaurant on the weekends! Surrrrre, he doesn't know anything about the band, who they are, how they can be contacted, or anything else, but he knows for certain that the only place to see them is at their restaurant!

The crab mix with the steak was fabulous! I also tried their 007 Roll which was okay it had a fruit topping on it. I would choose the New York Steak Roll over the 007. The last thing I ordered was the Go Wild Rice bowl which had pieces of sea food,  and seaweed  in it. It was really spicy!!!

Beware of ordering drinks during happy hour; I was in a group of 4, so only two of us ordered beers with the intention of giving the two free drinks to the remaining two diners.

The first thing I noticed about the place was how beautifully designed it was, it's got a high ceiling with a big screen that plays concerts (Eagles), movies (Avatar) and sports (Superbowl, Basketball). It wasn't long before we got to know the owner and found out that he designed portions of the famous Caesar's Palace at the strip. He took it upon himself to build a stage at the restaurant that now has a grand piano for musicians to play. There's an ambiance to Go Wild that I couldn't find in Ichiza or RA, I can't quite put my finger on it, but it's made me love the place ever since. 

On January 29th, my family reserved a table for 7 to celebrate my mom's birthday. When we got there, we were led to this huge booth especially prepared for us :D Since it was a special occasion, we decided to be adventurous and order something out of the ordinary. 

Here's a partial list of what we ordered:
- Fire Go Wild Rolls
- Screaming Orgasm
- Sea Urchin Rolls
- YakiSoba
- Tempura DonBuri
- California Rolls
- Potstickers
- Crunchy Crab Roll (there was a name to it, I forgot. Woops)

When the Fire Go Wild Rolls were served in a flaming fire-lit plate, I swear everyone was so in awe that we simultaneously started taking pictures of it XDD Everything was excellent, not to mention they've got a 'half-price on all sushi' promotion right now, so there's more reason to try it out!

The service here is a joke.

Came here b/c one of my friends had a groupon or something which as previously stated in other reviews cannot be used on ""happy hour"" which is all day and applies to all their rolls OR the lunch/dinner special... which is almost their whole menu.

We ended up ordering one of their 'boats' which took over an hour to get to us... this comes with a soup and salad... our waiter forgot to bring the salad.

During this hour, a vendor or some company that delivers for them came into the restaurant to complain... and we saw it all go down... at no point did anyone guide this person to the manager, they just let him complain to the chef and a waitress who appeared to be on break and chatting w/ the chef @ the sushi bar.... as this person was complaining all the employees got defensive and started arguing with this person, in front of other customers!  Which made no sense.  All they had to do was apologize, but instead they argued, who argues with their customers!?

Anyways the food was OK, service is horrible.

I ordered a 3 rolls which I only received 1 roll, hamachi Kama, and the udon tempura. The female manager came up and apologized for the wait in the rolls and than apologized that I never received the 2 other rolls.  The sushi chefs seemed to be drinking sake bomb after sake bomb and slacking on the rolling!  

Also, their marketing gimmick is 50% rolls (Normal avg. price $15) then they give rolls for $7.50 but do give small portions.  

The food that did come was ok at best.  Staff definitely needs to improve on their customer service and get those rolls on the table.

  We had an avocado ""roll"", more on that later, a fire dragon roll, some baked green mussels, 1/2 dozen oysters, and some gyoza. The sushi chefs had a gong to ring when they had an order ready, kinda cool.  The food was really good, the mussels were some of the best I've had, oysters very fresh.  The rolls were really creative and tasty; the avocado roll wasn't a roll at all but an avocado bomb as my fiance gently reminded me basically took an avocado and stuffed it with spicy tuna, soft shell crab, and eel sauce.  The fire dragon roll was lit on fire with a blowtorch, anything cooked with a blowtorch is good btw.  the gyoza was standard.

Spicy tuna crunch roll- probably one of our faves of the evening. Tuna was very fresh and the spicy sauce was quite good.
Spicy salmon crunch roll- this was very tasty. Same as the tuna, but with salmon instead (obviously).
Avocado bam- If you love avocado you will love this crazy looking concoction! A dome of avocado slices with all kinds of tummy stuff on the inside. Great follow up to the spicy rolls as this is on the sweeter side. 
Kiss of Fire- this one was no joke! I felt like I could breath fire after eating it. Very good though.

5390881,2012-07-03,3,8bZ49zy4KlFVu5teFETYhQ,"Tried Go Wild for the first time yesterday for lunch.  It's difficult for me to know how to properly review sushi restaurants when I haven't had a chance to visit them in a setting where I can get plastered off of Sake bombs and polish off 5 lbs of fish and rice.  I like it all, from simple sashimi or nigiri to the oft ridiculed by foodies Americanized rolls covered in some nondescript sauce and topped with bacon, ice cream, and corn syrup.   But when I go to a sushi place for lunch I feel a bit like a caged wild animal, completely restricted from being able to ""Go Wild"" and eat with a Sake influenced appetite.  Just something to keep in mind.

I decided to go for the Salmon lunch special, which I assumed was Teriyaki salmon and was to come with a some pretty standard options for a sushi joint lunch special (Miso soup, Califnoria Roll, Rice, Salad, Gyoza, and an egg roll)  I abhor teriyaki sauce because it's usually too sweet for my liking and requested the Salmon just be simply grilled.  The waiter didn't think that would be a problem (he also said he ""thought"" that it was in fact a teriyaki salmon when I originally asked, which I in turn thought was weird that he wouldn't know).   Not too long later the food arrived.  Miso soup to start which was about the same as most versions.  I found the gyoza and egg roll to be very pleasant tasting and devoured those up quickly.  The California roll was a little lacking in terms of amount of food stuffed in the roll, but the taste was fine.  The Salmon tasted great but was a little more dry than I like.  

Our server checked on us several times for refills and to see if we needed anything further, but at the same time also got us in and out of there quickly which I appreciate during a work lunch break.  

So I went mild at Go Wild, and was pleased!  I'm more at about a 3.5 for this restaurant but will upgrade it to a 4 due to the service I received and reasonable price for the meal.",v3YOx9T4jRSw8XP9Rd9H4g,5,5,4,pb-zZdBJf8OZbpLFxt5cnA
