1455165,2018-05-27,0,Q283sagGad1VlOncWykBKQ,"Slow service, stale bread and bums in front blocking the door.  Very sad. 

I almost drove away when i saw the bums, but in Vegas it is nearly impossible to avoid them so i pressed on. 

Huge mistake.  

Do not recommend. .",iQ-gmfsU74G2qnLatXFo5w,1,0,1,HF7Tl4EUF_EO-rj9H2SBHQ

4163803,2015-04-04,1,Q283sagGad1VlOncWykBKQ,So I just came here again the other day and I was pretty disappointed. Service was decent but the quality of food not so much. Literally all the drinks were watered down. I had to switch out my drink FOUR times to finally settle for a drink I did not want because it was the only thing not watered down.,FBlKK57447Wt-EUR1TfENw,2,3,2,ZsZC49C7dRjaibp2vErnQw

Of course I remind them to  change their gloves, but I shouldn't have to. This place needs major education on sanitary and food handling.

The guy at the counter asked whether or not I wanted meat or cheese, I said no. The guy then turns to his female co-worker and starts laughing at me and says "" toast that sounds good"". They are sitting here snickering right in front of me. So rude. No you morons I am not going to order just toast... I proceeded to get vegetables, avocados, etc. Was extremely disappointed, as most places are kind and dont laugh about what I am eating.",lYg8Hm2SZb74hHhF2ubzrw,2,0,1,fouij0dpfSmAaTV91pHcDQ
