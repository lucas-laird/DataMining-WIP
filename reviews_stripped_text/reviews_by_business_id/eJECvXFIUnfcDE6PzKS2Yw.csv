205974,2014-06-21,0,eJECvXFIUnfcDE6PzKS2Yw,"First of all let me say that this McDonalds doesn't have a sign in their drive thru stating that they charge for Ranch. 
Second of all customer service sucks here. I know that you can't expect them to treat super great but at least have respect. The stupid cashier at the 2nd window was Rude about me asking for ranch then got her manager which wasn't that nice either.
Third of all when I get home, my order is missing! I was missing one of our burgers. 
Then I try to call them but no answer. Why do they have a phone if they won't answer? So guess what store#18966 I call the 800 number and did a complaint. Hope you learn to have respect, I'm not asking for u to all happy and jolly JUST RESPECT!
Forgot to mention that my husband's fries where half way full! What's wrong with them!",cCO_FRwe_XHfMuQuKAfuIg,0,0,1,K_w_5k3YSw3rK_5rMnma_g

The drive through is usually pretty busy due to the layout but its usually quick.  The food I get is good and if you haven't tried it get a McDouble with Big Mac sauce, i highly recommend it, it's excellent!!!",aT_AzbpcsbodNNtFzPqRVg,3,0,3,F0JrEyIAsx2TPIO5oapWCQ

Servers chit chattin including the management.  I waited because I needed help. Server blah face no smile. What happened to McDonald's served with a smile? Not here that's for sure.

Today is like the third time in the last 2 weeks that I've ordered a DR PEPPER and got a DIET COKE, which I'm incredibly allergic to! Thanks for not taking the time to be careful of giving people something they didn't order! Maybe you guys need to be educated about artificial sweetener (which diet is worse for you than regular btw, readers) being a major 'food' allergy, before someone gets a lawyer. If it was my grandpa we were just getting a soda for, he'd be in the hospital right about now.

Thanks guys for making my insides burn for the next several hours!! I really (DON'T) appreciate it!!!!!",ySyXNs92s3_sItaZlt1f5w,1,1,1,F2_IXKF7s3FPpUHGXcVAew

It says 11 even at the door and I've tried to get food for the kiddos at 10 and the door is already locked and they say they are close. Also they take hours to get an order ready, I once waited 40 mins for ONE BURGER. It always happens . I used to try to get breakfast from there before going to work but it's impossible unless I arrive there an hour early, staff is friendly I just hate the actual service.",xBQRyGd9nnjIrO6C3-dnnQ,0,0,1,ufnt_vVscyNnnLwEbrZg2A

1493090,2016-01-16,7,eJECvXFIUnfcDE6PzKS2Yw,"Just happened to be working in the area and really needed some chow.  While on the way to our destination given the short amount of time we needed to be there and the direction we were going, we ended up at this location.

I have not rolled into a fast food drive-thru in sometime.  I also did not consort the app prior to our arrival.  This was a moment when you see the ""Golden Arches"" and make a split second decision to visit.

Upon arriving at the squawk box..given the cold tone of the server at the other end, I was filled with dread thinking this is going to be a mistake.  I ordered up a fried chicken sandwich, some fries and a sweet tea.  

Moving on to the next window, my trepidation was confirmed by the blunt, no smile serving clerk taking our money.  This was confirmed by the no smile serving clerk at the next window handing out the meal.

When we arrived at our destination and I reached into the bag for my meal, I found the fries and sweet tea to be all that is McDonalds.  Those items built around the centerpiece of the sandwich I so wanted to enjoy.  Just like the robotic order taking, order serving experience I had received, the chicken sandwich had no soul.  I would have derived just as much pleasure eating the wrapper it came in.

Shame on you McDonald's location and shame on me.  Given the geographical location, I should have known better.  But mark my words........I WILL NEVER COME BACK!",HJj82f-csBI7jjgenwqhvw,7,4,1,JkTyP2xL2sR41sMW0tLxzA

2159702,2018-05-29,0,eJECvXFIUnfcDE6PzKS2Yw,Worst experience here. First they were giving me someone's $5 order when I paid $15.86 for mine. So I park and wait. Guy comes out with no drinks. So I have to wait AGAIN. I get home. N NO sauce for my nuggets like are you serious. The sauce type is legit on the dam receipt.

2286894,2015-06-25,0,eJECvXFIUnfcDE6PzKS2Yw,Horrible horrible food. The burgers were left out way too long and the fries weren't even cooked all the way. Don't go there if you don't want to waste your money or time.,9aPPubjeD2vdv3R4c829sw,0,0,1,z2fMNsNEza8_9PmpeFppcw
2773173,2018-05-10,1,eJECvXFIUnfcDE6PzKS2Yw,"Super busy Mc D in a very packed part of town. I wish they had someone full-time assigned to the diner/eating area because they all were stuck behind the counter and I had to ask someone to come wipe off a table. I get surprised to see some customers sit at dirty tables with no problem. I just can't do it. So the gal comes out and starts sweeping, the place was super busy and super messy. There was a long row of tables, you know the ones, all connected with many spots to sit. Six of them had dirty, crumbs, grime, napkins, straw wrappers, food remnants - just assign someone to the diner for their entire shift. So the gal comes out, and begins sweeping and taking care of the full trash bin. So I have to go back up and ask someone to come wipe down a table. I spotted a rag I almost just did it myself. I wish there was a priority list too, for employees: when you go in to clean up the diner do these jobs in this order: wipe tables, clean up floor, clean up drink station area, empty trash...

Anyways, thanks for lunch it was fresh, hot and yummy per Mc D usual.",-SjQXQd-IRfOdUdYYwWGOQ,5,1,2,0Q8JTpO0mlnZDO9ObfJEig

3841842,2015-05-28,0,eJECvXFIUnfcDE6PzKS2Yw,"Drive thru menu showed the same price for Ala carte & meal.  Figured they were having some promotion.  
When I went to pay, cashier said $2 more than menu price.  When I asked, the price she said a different amount.  I told her what the menu said, she said she would get the manager.  I explained what was going on, manager told me I was wrong & asked if I wanted him to go look at the drive thru menu.  Sure.  He left me in line, with line backing up, came back and still said no, I was wrong & for me to go check myself.  I paid full price, drove back around & looked.  Manager came back out front.  We're standing arms length from the board, not 12 to 15 feet back where the cars order, & can see, underneath the glass, the bottom part of the 6 has been removed, so at a distance, it looks like a 4.  Even after manager acknowledges the problem, he does NOTHING to rectify.  One of the WORST customer service experiences.  I took a picture to send to corporate.  I told manager board should be fixed, because it's false advertising.
If he had honored what the board DID say, rather than what it SHOULD have said, this McDonald's would have kept a customer & not received a negative review.",8xf6CpwiCd1lbvEiXlcjhw,0,0,1,w2mngYCsxiLRdcDKoLyLpA
3914284,2017-08-31,0,eJECvXFIUnfcDE6PzKS2Yw,"This place is unclean. It has a putrid, foul odour. There's flies flying around. It doesn't have paper towels in the bathrooms which means even If an employee washes their hands they must either wait until someone else opens the door or touch the contaminated handle prior to making and/or handling a customer's food and/or drink. Also there's lack of diversity as no Moorish people work at this establishment. Yelp forced this star otherwise they'd get zero.
