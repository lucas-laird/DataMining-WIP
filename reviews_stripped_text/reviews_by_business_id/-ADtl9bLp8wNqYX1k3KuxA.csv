54433,2017-11-13,0,-ADtl9bLp8wNqYX1k3KuxA,"Visited Ichi for the first time about a week ago. We ordered Ramen and one appetizer, Agedashi Tofu. The Ramen was not bad, but not great either. Broth was flavorful, but lacked depth. Noodles were fine as well as most of the other ingredients, but the broth definitely needs work. As well as the pork slices, which were thin and  chewy.  

The Agedashi, OTOH, was not good at all. Unlike any I have had, it was heavily battered, which might have been ok had the coating been fully cooked. Yecch. Skimpy sauce and no bonito at all - hardly Agedashi! A friend who has been here 4-5 times said he had previously ordered several of the appetizers (but not the Agedashi) and they were consistently sub-par.

Staff was super friendly and attentive enough. No complaint on that end. If they get the broth and the appetizers dialed, could be really good. Fingers crossed 'cuz it'd be nice to have a decent Ramen spot on the North side of Vegas.",wpnn_cODD0at47N6ubIaPQ,0,0,2,LLaKo0xP_dlSYhrwm6ksNA

However, they can improved it by adding a little bit more broth coz the bowl is about 1/3 full and it look anemic. The noodles are over-cooked and a little saggy.. lol like cup O noodles at Walmart, yuck... Needs improvement. The extra garlic chips becomes soft which is ok, but don't put to much. The half egg was overdone. The broth is actually good and very rich in taste. 

For the price, it's ok. Employees are nice and little confuse sometimes. Maybe they're new. Overall the atmosphere is great. Oh, the restroom is clean.",kvk1XK4jsclzBQB5YZOveA,0,0,3,RJaE5gmLTlkvSO-EENhXlA

Place is small like many ramen houses, but service was rather quick and the wait wasn't bad either (about 10 min). We tried the shoyu and the chicken ramen, both spicy. Spicy level wasn't spicy at all for us and my husband isn't too big on spicy food. From a scale of 1-10 I'd say the spicy was maybe a 5 at most? Overall the ramen tasted great but the shoyu broth was a bit too salty for my liking. 

During this trip, we also tried the crispy rice with tuna and the crunch roll. Honestly, these were my favorite and definitely something that I will be ordering in the future. Looking forward to trying other things on the menu next visit.

The portions were very small compared to other ramen places we've been to. They do have an option for extra broth which is $2 more and another option for extra noodles which is also another $2. So an extra $4 if you want more I guess. That would make it about a $12 Bowl and that's not including other add ons you might want. Seems kind of pricy for the amount you get, but it was tasty. We ate every last drop of our bowls cause they were so small & We left hungry Maybe make the portions just a little bit more larger or even have a option for a small, medium or large bowl and or make the add ons a little more cheaper.

For ramen, I went with the classic tonkatsu (of course). That was surprisingly good. Deep flavors in the broth. The chashu was very tender and the noodles held good flavor.

I also ordered some Pork Katsu to add to my Ramen, but they burned the hell out of it, so I sent it back.

My most recent trip was pick up. I ordered extra soup and when I got home I realized the entire bowl had spilled out. First thought maybe the lid wasn't on correctly but looking closer I found a small cut on the bottom of the bowl.. super disappointed. 

Original review:
5stars for food. The ramen was very good!
Kevin was my server and he was super nice. 
Why 3 stars?
It was just me so I sat at the bar to avoid a wait and there were two things:
Every time the door opened the air would come in and it's freezing, so I'm sure it'll be hot in the summer.. 
Second the bar stools were SOOOOOO uncomfortable! Seriously, horrible. I sat down and there was no stability at all. It took me 2 mins to ""kinda"" get situated. Then tried again by getting up and pulling he chair in, it was a disaster. Then the ladies sitting next to me commented that they had he same issue. Then a party of 2 girls came in and one was like ""omg, I'm gunna fall."" THEN a guy sat directly next to me and did he exact same thing I did, trying to adjust his seat a million times.

Ramen was tasty. I had the miso ramen with some extras. I read other reviews and agree it was a bit salty. I was informed though if I like it less salty, I should choose either the chicken, creamy or vegetable broth since (as I learned) miso broths are typically on the salty side. My only suggestion would be to either address the complaints and adjust the salt level in the broths (guests can always add more, right??) or inform the guest that it's a little on the salty side when they order. No apps this time, just da souuuuuuuup. Gotta try the black garlic next time. 

Clean decor and good prices. Great menu variety with some unique/not often found apps. It's a small place, so don't think you can just bum rush in there with 7 of y'all on a Friday night and expect to get sat immediately.  Plan appropriately.

There isn't much room inside to wait, so put your name on the list and let them know you'll be outside hanging around.

You will not be let down.  Google their web site--Ramen-ya.  http://www.ramenyahawaii.com/",fYBwTpuyK5ujW2vZs9OWlQ,0,0,2,e9Mkv09BvOEU4O0opno5lg

Ordered the Tonkotsu ramen, which turned out better than I thought since I've lived in Japan for a few years and it's pretty hard to find ramen in LV where corners haven't been cut.  The authenticity was pretty good and the spiciness had enough kick to it.  

The gyoza was a bit of a disappointment, as it looked frozen and didn't spend enough time to get a crispy skin.

I saw this place had just opened not too long ago and it's down the street from me so I figured now's my chance to try it out and see what everybody says I've been missing.

I will say that I did actually enjoy the meal I had. I got the combination platter so I got a salad, a side of my choice and a big bowl of Ramen and it was decently priced. I got the Black Garlic Ramen and it was actually really good. It's VERY garlicy, but if you like garlic, you'll love it. We all tried different sides and different Ramen and they were all pretty good. The crunch roll and gyoza were good. The fried rice was good too. The chicken one however, I didn't think was that great. It tasted like the normal chicken Ramen that you would make at home, nothing special. I don't have any other restaurants to compare anything too, but it's worth checking. 

Downside is that the place is very, very small and chances are you're going to have to wait. There's a few seats at the bar, a couple tables and some booths. I wouldn't recommend going with more than a party of 4 because of how small the place is and how tight the seating is. I think it makes a great date night spot though. Not a huge fan of their drinks either.

I tried the Curry Ramen this visit along with edamame app. The broth was thick and creamy with delicious curry flavor that was enhanced as the the bottom of the bowl came near. The noodles are accompanied by chopped scallions, corn and a pan fried chicken breast sliced into 1"" strips.  The dish was served with a generous portion of noodles which I swear we're tied to the bottom of the bowl because I struggled to get them into my mouth. Or maybe I just suck at using chopsticks. I really enjoyed this bowl of curry broth goodness.

Edamame was typical of what you would expect anywhere. No sense in trying to get creative in the explaination, keep it simple like this dish with just a hint of sea salt.

I'm not even taking a star away for that, because it was really good.

The noodles had an excellent texture, the veggies were fresh and crisp, the meat was very flavorful... and they managed to package an egg to go that stayed soft-boiled.  I killed it on my own by pouring the broth over it -- but that was me.

The bowl of ramen was hot and filling.  It kept me happy all afternoon.  Even better was the price.  $8.95 plus tax.  I was very pleased - the cost was for a complete bowl of ramen and they didn't try to upcharge me for every little thing.

The first time my husband had the Miso Ramen and I had the Black Garlic Ramen.  My husband said his was good but I loved mine.  The only thing is that are only about three pieces of pork so I would suggest ordering extra meat which is an additional charge.  The second time my husband had the same but since I wasn't hungry I ordered the gyoza and fried rice.  The gyoza was fantastic but I found that the rice was hard.  They were willing to take it back and take it off the bill.  I ordered another gyoza and they didn't charge me for it.

The tonkatsu had more of a pork broth than your ramen/umami combo, so very good for the kids and those looking for an easy-going ramen.  Came with egg (well overcooked), bamboo shoot, and onion.  Noodles were basic and very closely resembled instant.  Ichi is pretty cheap under $10 and offers sake, beer, and soju.  Though they close early so not your typical drinking spot.

Line was insane at 8pm on a sunday with a 30 minute wait.  Place is tiny, but service was quick once seated.  Many people did take out which seemed like the way to go at Ichi.

Isn't it common sense to not smoke within a couple feet of the restaurant WITH THE DOOR OPEN? One of the customers stood up from their meal and had to close the back door. As for the vapist, I was able to see her cloud of smoke rush in through the door, into our dining area. She must have been smoking right next to the open door.
As for the actual service, expect every.single.server. at the front of the house to come up to you every 5 minutes to ask you the same question. They seriously take turns and come at you every 2 mouthfuls.

Food:
Miso ramen is too bland. Broth is pretty rich and a tad bit more saltiness would change the game. 
Don't order karaage here thinking of the real deal. Their karaage is the size of popcorn shrimp, no joke. I felt so cheated because their meat doesn't even seem marinated. They just give you tons of sauce on the side.
All of my takoyakis were crushed and you can just feel the sloppiness on each dish.",2-O8qKuyQ63M_qWujFQ0Lw,1,0,2,6PHlWPYZLlg__1XC1Y98Tw

I ordered the spicy chicken ramen with the salad and gyoza. They offer a meal where you can get ramen, a salad and appetizer. The ramen portion size was HUGE. The gyoza was really good, and the salad with their house dressing was excellent!

The black garlic ramen is what immediately caught my attention, so I tried that. The broth was surprisingly better than what I anticipated. The only problem was that they are skimpy on the meat and the egg is only soft boiled (not even marinated). I think they only serve thin ramen noodles as well (I prefer thick but oh well).

3687345,2017-11-26,0,-ADtl9bLp8wNqYX1k3KuxA,"This ramen shop filled a deep void in the Centennial part of Las Vegas, which lacked a decent ramen shop.  I've been here twice now and am ready to share my review.  Please keep in mind I am a HUGE fan of Monta Japaneses Noodle House aka Monta Ramen.  So Monta Ramen is the golden standard for ramen in Las Vegas in my opinion. 

1st off Ambience:  Nice and clean atmosphere.  The music is trendy and on the loud side. So don't come here if you're looking for a quiet meal.

2nd Service:  I went on the weekend this time.  So it was busy.  No one greeted me at the door because the waitress was busy taking orders.  So I was left standing at the door along with 2 other different parties for about 5 minutes before someone could properly greet me and inform me there was a wait.  The first time I was there was a weekday, and I was greeted and seated immediately.  I recommend an area where guests can sign in on their own while waiting to be assisted.  Besides the small wait, the servers were friendly and periodically checked on how I was doing. 

3rd Quality of Food: The first time I went there,  I ordered the creamy tonkotsu ramen, but felt I couldn't give a fair review by comparing a creamy tonkotsu with a classic tonkotsu.  So this time I ordered a classic tonkotsu with no additional garnishes besides what it already came with.  I got the combo this time, which came with a salad with dressing, and I chose the spicy tuna roll from the choices listed.  The dressing on the salad was absolutely delicious.  It tasted like a citrus vinaigrette dressing.  Light and crisp yet savory in flavor.  Sadly, it was probably the highlight of my meal.  The spicy tuna was your basic roll with nothing overtly memorable about it, but it was suitable for it's purpose.  Then I had the tonkotsu ramen,  which I wanted to love with all my heart since Monta Ramen is far from where I live.  The accompanying chashu was slightly charred, which gave it nice flavor.  The noodles had a nice firmness and taste to them, but the ramen broth itself lacked the depth and flavor I had grown to expect and love at Monta Ramen. 

Conclusion: Would I eat here again? Yes, I would because they are close by, and it will satisfy me if I need a quick ramen fix.  But if I'm craving to eat  ramen at it's best, I will just have to make the drive out to Monta Ramen.",kYKL1VvoI8bHjuOyq2_yUg,3,1,3,fVr8t7iTiwpo2qmEefNxqw

I have been to this spot a handful of times. On a few of vista, the wait was too long for my taste, so I ended up going elsewhere. This spot is super small so anticipate a wait on a weekend or evenings - over 30/45 minutes at times. To avoid this, we now call ahead before driving out to check on the line. 

The few times I was able to sit down without much of a wait, I thought the service was good, and the prices were reasonable. Presentation, size, and the overall heartiness of the bowls we sampled were as just as expected.

To date, my husband and I enjoy the black garlic ramen. We are garlic lovers and really enjoyed our bowls. The broth and the garlic paired perfectly together and we slurped down our bowls quickly. 

On a separate visit, we each sampled the Curry Ramen, and it fell short for us. The curry had thicker noodles, pork, and a thicker, spicier broth. It was not bad by any means - we both felt that the black garlic was more flavorful and enjoyable. This was just our preference. 

This restaurant is a good ramen joint and a welcomed addition to the Northwest area. Although this spot is solid, I believe there are some amazing ramen joints in town that rank ahead of it in my mind. It is a solid  'A-OK' and we will still be back to enjoy the black garlic ramen bowls.",3Qv2rjPXC2eNKyV5lh3J_g,18,14,3,X-MsPW3IYnzxRw7eNwQBNg

The place is tiny compared to other ramen or pho spots I've been to so be prepared to wait if you're visiting on a busy night. 

The decor is very cool and hip. Unlike a traditional American restaurant [booth or a table with chairs] you are seated at a bench table with bench seating. Or you can be seated against this corner where you are on bar stools similar to a diner. I prefer prefer the tables though.

Everytime I've come the server immediately greeted me and brought out water for the table. The water is stored in this cool little wine bottle thing, I wish I took a picture. 

The menu has various ramen styles. I usually go for the miso or the regular tonkotsu. You can add extras for a little more $$$. I usually like adding an extra egg and nori [seaweed] to mine

3901530,2017-12-12,0,-ADtl9bLp8wNqYX1k3KuxA,"Sorry Monta, you've been ousted as my top Ramen spot in the city. Bold words, I know. 

We've been impatiently waiting for a ramen house to grace us here in Centennial Hills, and were pleasantly surprised when we ran into Ichi - a tiny spot in the corner of a plaza up in our neck of the woods. Decor is minimal and modern, with a few booths, tables and bar seating on the left hand side. 

I got the classic Tonkatsu and my husband tried the chicken - both were a slam dunk. The flavor development in the broth is nothing short of phenomenal, noodles fresh with a bite and we found the perfect amount of additions to the bowl. Nothing is worse than when extras crowd the bowl and you have to search for broth. We've been back time and time again, we've even had it delivered because we crave their delicious flavor. 

So why the missing star? Service. If you're taking the food to go - the guys at the counter are top notch. If you're at a table, you'll find yourself with time to scroll your IG feed before even placing your beverage order. In our opinion, the staff is slow to serve even if they appear to be running around like crazy. I'm not sure if it's a lack of table assignment - but three people ended up asking us if we've been taken care of... it took 17 minutes for us to get drinks. 

Service is something that will be worked out with time - I hope they get it figured out sooner rather than later, because Ichi has become our favorite in the city, and we want it to stick around!",uYlzvshOSWCTwNLFBELTug,2,0,4,Afc81nl8YmURqPaJK-vazg

To say I was excited when I saw that Ichi had opened up is an understatement. Every time I drove by it, longing would wash over me, but I would keep driving, resolving to one day stop and enjoy a bowl of delicious brothy magic. That took longer than expected but I suggested this spot to my friend for lunch this weekend and she was all for it. YES! Finally. 

We got there right when they opened on a Saturday at 11:30 a.m. and there were people waiting outside already. I felt a bit territorial. I was thinking ""yo, I don`t want to have to fight someone. I come here in peace, but I`m hungry"". When they opened up the doors, we walked into a clean, modern eating area with booths on the right hand side and a bar style seating area on the left. We snagged the first booth on the right. I need space to spread out all the food and joy I derive from eating it. Bar seating just does not provide that option.

Anyway, we were brought water pretty quickly. They give you handled cups with ice and then they have a cute farmhouse type bottle with water that you can pour from. It's probably tap water, but I ain't mad at their attempt to be fancy. I see you, Ichi. We also ordered some Sapporo because what else goes well with ramen? Come on people. Get on this level. Sapporo was as expected: cold, crisp, delicious. They brought us cups with the bottles and offered to pour it a moment too late because we were already doing it. No points deducted. 

Our waiter came over soon after and I cannot remember his name but he is the nice young man with braces. Okay, I just felt hella old typing that, but yes, he was friendly and attentive. We had a few menu questions and in the end I ended up ordering the chicken ramen combo with spicy tuna roll and salad. My lunch date opted for the seafood ramen with vegetarian broth. She really wanted the curry ramen but it is made with pork broth. Suggestion: Offer the curry ramen with vegetarian broth somehow and that would be a great option for folks who do not eat pork.Just sayin'. Would be a great option for the menu, but hey what do I know? Everything, clearly. Lastly, we ordered the deep fried soft shell crab because it looked amazing on the menu and our nice young man with braces waiter said it was delicious. SOLD!

My chicken ramen was amazing. I really enjoyed it. The broth was deep and complex. That is my foodie way of saying I ate it all. Seriously, the broth was really good, comforting and really hit the spot. The egg was soft boiled, which was nice. Sometimes I get an overcooked egg and I do not have time for that nonsense in my ramen. Noodles were tender but had bite. My only gripe is that there was not enough chicken, but hey I get it. Overall, filling and very satisfying. They gave me some chili sauce on the side but I didn`t use it for some reason. Next time. They give you the option of mild, medium, and spicy. The spicy tuna roll was good. I read another review that said it was too salty? I don`t think so. I thought it was perfect and it was spicy. I had to replenish my fancy bottled tap water several times. Salad was fine with a light dressing on it. Gotta get those greens' y'all. 

My friend got the seafood ramen with vegetable broth as I mentioned before and while she thought it was good, there was a turn off in the fact that Ichi did not shell the shrimp. It was just messy to eat having to stick your fingers into the bowl and retrieve the shrimp to peel it. If they had peeled it, I think it would have been a lot better. Take note Ichi: peel those shrimp, please. If we wanted to peel shrimp, we would have gone to Hot N Juicy. Overall, she said the flavors were good, though.

The crowning glory? That dang deep fried soft shell crab. Look, I would marry this appetizer if that were possible. It was fall apart soft once you got beyond that initial crunch. The carrot puree at the bottom was unexpected and divine. I`ll take ten more, thanks.

Overall, a solid three stars. Good service, decent prices, happy tummy food. Just peel those shrimp and get a vegetarian curry ramen option and I would not hesitate giving more stars. I will be back.

4043797,2018-02-28,0,-ADtl9bLp8wNqYX1k3KuxA,"Very solid Ramen House, and a welcome addition to the Centennial area.

Pros:

1. The Ramen here is very good. Good broth vs noodles/meat/veggies ratio, and the ingredients are always flavorful. Their black garlic dish is one of my favorites there, and its highly recommended. 

2. Appetizers are solid. They also serve tako yaki here, which is a big bonus, and its done well. The sushi part is acceptable, but not great by any stretch as it's primarily standard california roll type stuff. But hey, you're not here for the sushi, right? There's a million and a half places in town for that.

3. Staff is always friendly and on the ball with your orders and general service. 

4. Prices are on target, and you won't leave feeling like you broke the bank.

Cons:

1. It's tiny. Seating is always limited strictly due to the size of the place, meaning wait times are inevitable, especially on weekends when there's more customers. Expect a wait of around 15-45 minutes, give or take, during the evening. Short of knocking down the walls and expanding, there isn't much they can for that. Unavoidable as it is, I have to knock one star down for it, though I'd only knock a half one down if Yelp allowed.",v0QQFY3i8IkCMHtGik4rTw,0,0,4,3TVIsdYPeuncl1wznyxaZg

The first few regular ramen has a choice of original, mild and spicy which most ramen places to have. I've tried the curry ramen and the creamy tonkatsu ramen on the spicy side and they tasted superb. The basic bowls are good themselves and like other ramen places, there are sides you can add to your bowl.

They have a combo where you can order a ramen bowl, salad and a side. (I got curry rice on my side)

The staff were great and friendly, one even greeted me remembering who I was when I used to go to their sister restaurant Sweet Poke.

Waiting time is great especially for me since I go alone and both times there was plenty of space on the bar table area.

All in all I'd give this place a 5. I was pleased with everything even the location since it's close to where I live. Going to try other food on the menu next time.

We arrived for an early dinner and only had a short wait for a table, but the line definitely grew as we dined. The dining room has less than a dozen tables and bar style seating as well. Take-out appeared to be a large part of their business as well.

To start the meal we shared Gyoza, Edamame, and Crispy Rice with Tuna. The Gyoza was tender with a nicely flavored filling. Edamame was soft and had the right amount of salt topping. The Crispy Rice with Tuna had more sauces than usually on this type of dish, but overall was good. It probably would have been better without so much sauce though.

My main entrée was the Creamy Tonkotsu Ramen. This was delicious, especially the broth. I loved every individual ingredient as well as the overall flavor. The pork slices were thin which made it much easier to eat. My friend ordered the Classic Tonkotsu Ramen which I tasted and I loved the broth on this one as well.I really didn't have a favorite between the two because they were both great. The spice for both was served on the side so spice level could be added at the table. My friend did the combination option which added a salad and the gyoza to his meal. The salad dressing for his salad was amazing. It tasted like a great combination of ginger and garlic.

Our service was attentive and no time was wasted getting our orders in. The pricing was the real standout here. For two of us to have ramen and starters we left for around $40. I thought for sure that they forgot to charge me for something when I saw the total. Nope, the pricing really is that great.",3nIuSCZk5f_2WWYMLN7h3w,6,4,4,k4YLDrWzl6Nl-fvtx_VKFg

We quickly decided what we wanted, orderin an appetizer of Agadashi (deep fried tofu) and then a California Roll & Chashu Fried Rice for my son and a Curry Ramen bowl for myself.  They were very accommodating to my changing my ramen order, substituting fried tofu for the katsu pork. The food was fantastic, and came out quickly. The servers kept checking back asking if we needed anything, and clearing the table in a very timely fashion.
If there was any complaint, it was that the soda my son ordered was in a can and over priced for that, and that my hot tea was a Lipton Green Tea Bag just dropped in a cup. No hot water refills, no soda refills.

4435977,2017-11-21,0,-ADtl9bLp8wNqYX1k3KuxA,"Honestly, the best Ramen I have enjoyed since returning to the US. 

Pros: A wide selection of 85% authentic Ramen. They have Sapporo on Draft and even a variety of flavored Soju (Korean...but delicious)...Takoyaki. When ordering ""spicy"", the level of spice is admirable considering the typically bland US palet for anything other than salt and pepper. Bravo. 

Cons: The chef should be ashamed at his attempt at Tako Yaki. I should lower my expectations when ordering a Japanese street food in a brick and mortar restaurant, but omitting the Katsuobushi is a mortal sin. 

Sapporo is nice, but Asahi on draft is non-negotiable. 

Overall - a damn delicious place to enjoy a bowl of Ramen and more than likely the best location in the area. I just wish the establishment would make the food more authentic - which in this case would actually make it better.

I don't know what those other people ate but the chicken ramen we had was quite possibly the worst food I've ever had in a restaurant.  Specifically, the soup base was so salty that after one or two spoonsful I couldn't take it any more.  Since I'd paid good money for this, I felt I should at least eat the solid stuff.  After a bottle and a half of water to wash it down, I finished the solid stuff and then went home and drank some orange juice to get the salt taste out of my mouth.  Speaking of the solid stuff, what my $8.95 bought was two slices of chicken breast 1/8"" thick, half a boiled egg and some noodles.  They must get about six bowls of soup out of each chicken breast.  With so little content, even if this soup had been delicious, I would have been better off to go to Teriyaki Madness nearby for a MUCH better value.  Better yet, I could have gone to about any Vietnamese place for a bowl of pho that wouldn't give me high blood pressure from all the salt.",yUPpcGlvcw9a49OEhpfEvg,0,0,1,7QRn5oRdEaVAgw-xq_SVsQ

I ordered the curry ramen, while my wife had the Tonkotsu ramen; we also ordered agedashi tofu, and spicy tube roll to share. I must say, this spot might be on my favorite ramen joint list. I know for sure I'm coming back to eat this tasty food. The chefs here know how to make a good ramen without overly seasoning the soup base. So far I am just loving this spot, with the whole atmosphere and everything.

When walking in we were greeted by a really nice left handed guy who got ya on the waiting list sadly I didnt get his name because he literally was the only great service we received ... he got our name on the list and told us we had a 10 minute wait which was no problem . We got a to go menu to look at but while my mom was checking it out I received a phone call so I didn't get the chance to decide my food .

Once seated we had Soo who got our drink orders but from that moment on she was rushing us to order . I don't know about you but I hate feeling rushed especially when I patiently waited for my seat plus I was trying to decide on different appetizer choices and browse photos of items .

Anyhow we ended up getting the popcorn shrimp be the chicken appetizer plus I got a jalapeño bomb thing . All the appetizers were decent nothing amazing but the salad side with the chicken and shrimp were really good the dressing was bomb and the portions were pretty large .

I got the garlic ramen soup and it was really good I know others complained about salt but mine was tasty .

When our food was delivered by Ash it was my soup and jalapeño popper I asked for a fork not only was her attitude bad but no fork came when I finally got soo she got me a fork but I saw Ash continually being grumpy and over all it was her day .

Later the chicken and shrimp and my moms fried rice showed up ..


Once we were done I literally was waiting while my mom was in the restroom to try to get another soda but when I had to flag my server down I was so annoyed I opted to get to go boxes and the check.

For rushing me to order and then having to wait for my fork and then not getting the option to give them the 1.50 more for another soda and for having delays and such this was only two stars .

I'll probably be back again purely due to the location but I hope I get better service ...",vwLV4TkRMoghs86tB1Ke8Q,9,4,2,I0IYkk9P9n79yesFi10IyA

As I entered through the door, I was greeted with a very unenthusiastic ""Irasshaimase!"" However,  I was seated right away towards their bar seating which was facing the wall. No complaints here since they had an electrical outlet to plug my phone to charge. Plus they had USB adapters on the outlet itself in case you forget your charger base itself. Nay to not being offered a booth or table. 

Nothing stood out on the menu. They offer your typical fare: tonkotsu, shoyu and miso broth with appetizers and simple sushi.  For their house specialties, they have a seafood tomato broth ramen, black garlic tonkotsu and a curry ramen. Not wanting to suffer from double the allergy attack of the seafood+soy allergy,  I just went with the black garlic. 

I can see where guests would complain that it's too salty for their liking,  but I was more concerned with how fatty the dish is with no vinegar condiments to cut through the richness like other ramen houses I've been to. Chashu pork slice portions were very skimpy.  
What would be 2 or 3 whole slices at other restaurants, theirs are 2 half pieces that make up 1 slice. The soft boiled egg is only a half piece. Where's my other half? Haha. The only redeeming quality was that I preordered extra noodles. The thin straight noodle which is vey similar if not the same ones that Monta serves. Thought this while time, the initial server didn't check in on me to see how my food was, but they checked on the other two guests sitting on the bar with me. They only inquired about my food when they came to pick up my card for payment. 

The decoration is geared towards a modern style. Bathrooms were clean. 

Last but not least,  there really was no fond good bye it any kind of ""welcome back, "" ""come back and see us again."" However I did hear ""good bye"" being called out to me as i was already out the door. Should be no excuse not to invite a guest back to any establishment if you wish any guests to return. Definitely no excuse to acknowledge a departing guest even if a server is busy ringing people out. Makes me wonder if i even want to return and try any of their other dishes at all when I'm on this side of town again.

5091791,2018-05-10,0,-ADtl9bLp8wNqYX1k3KuxA,"5/9 2nd Visit Update: I had a crazy ramen craving and couldn't get to Chinatown, so I gave this place another shot to redeem my impression last time. Well- my stars aren't changing... (brrr). I was very hungry and ordered the black garlic ramen based on other reviews here and their ""chicken"" karaage. I quote ""chicken"" because I surmise there MAY have been a scrap or two of flesh somewhere in the small pile of over-fried, greasy, thick, unsalted, tasteless clumps. They were crisp and then as you got to the center oil flavor just kept coming. I even bit experimentally into 1-2 of the larger pieces looking for meat, and only saw thick, oil-soaked batter. Got queasy. Decided to move on to the soup, which incidentally, they served to me a good 5 minutes before the appetizer, with no utensils (someone else, not my waiter, noticed I was sitting there with a bowl of hot ramen and no chopsticks and did bring a pair over with an embarrassed chuckle). First thing- the entire surface of the broth was encased in oil. I've had delicious, deeply flavorsome black garlic ramen at other places in town and it's always garlic oil DROPS floating on the surface, with fried garlic slices. This was a veritable layer of oil on top and the fried garlic and shallots? onions? in the broth were exceedingly bitter. The brother had decent flavor but tasted weak, like it was watered down. As I was sitting at the bar trying to eat, my neighbor to the right, a lady, kept exclaiming to her dining partner that her broth was ""so salty, way too salty, yes, too salty for my taste"" and finally pushed it away. My final disappointment was the noodles. They weren't the same as the ramen noodles served last time, which was the one redeeming quality of the horrible seafood ramen I ordered last visit and a point of positivity that I was looking forward to. They were white, and looked and felt like thinner rice noodles, definitely over boiled with none of the fresh bounce and chew and yellow color that I noticed last time. All in all, to say I regret spending $18 here (yes, I tipped the waiter $2 though he never checked on me once after he took my order) is an understatement and I definitely won't be back. Save your money for gas and drive to Chinatown- Ramen Sora, Monta, or even Sapporo Revolving Sushi which unexpectedly has the best black garlic broth I have tasted recently.

............

This was literally one of the worst meals I have had in a while. I should've re-evaluated my choice to order the tomato broth seafood ramen when most Ramen places are known for their Tonkatsu, but I wanted to have something a little lighter for lunch. I also ordered their tempura appetizer which was a shrimp/ veggie combo. So... the ramen. It came looking like a jumble of noodles and vague ingredients in a liquid that smelled and looked very startlingly like Campbell's tomatoes soup. Not nicely laid out with ingredients on top, and I could see chunks of raw onion, which was not listed on the ingredients. I poked into it, and a sweet-tomato-seafood smell wafted up. I don't know what I was expecting, but the sweet, super salty, almost ketchupy taste was not it. The ingredients were spare, but I just couldn't get over the broth. To make things worth, I had ordered extra broth like I usually do and I was completely enveloped in this sweet salty tomato soup smell. The tempura didn't fare any better- no light crispy batter here, it was heavily battered, almost like a thick beer batter, and the shrimp were tiny- the vegetables a joke (one of them was a heavily battered single green bean) and to add insult to injury, the tempura sauce was super salty as well. My 2 stars are only for the cleanliness, decent service, and texture of the noodles, which were decently springy and chewy even being the thin style of ramen noodleGiven we don't have ramen options at all in the north, in sheer desperation I may come back to try the regular tonkatsu broth / meat options, but take my word for it- steer clear of the seafood option and the tempura!",lFcmHJTpCXLY_RtMQHS1BQ,0,1,2,8BUeaeql2SZH2y-D301msg

I will say, it's not my favorite, but it is tasty. The only thing I wasn't as thrilled with was the pork chasu was cold. And it wasn't as tender as I was hoping.
Otherwise, the miso broth is pretty good. The beers are cheap, the food is cheap, and it's a nice place to warm up with a bowl of ramen. They have a pretty decent selection as well.

Place is super small and a bit cramped. Finally got a table and within a minute, we knew what to order. Waited again nearly 15 minutes, no water, no water, no order, no service at all! I can hold only so much patience. So guess what, we decided to leave. 

I truly understand they just opened but hey these staff must be trained properly. Smile, be aggressive! While waiting, I've observed almost every little thing. You got a guest that's been waiting for his check at the bar area since we were waiting to be seated. Dirty dishes at the bar counter left for nearly 25 mins.Two servers served the same table while the three tables that they've sat are waiting to be serviced. The 3rd staff member is arranging the take out orders. Why not one take care of the order, the other runs the food, and the other cashier/to go orders. But instead, two of them were doing the same and no one took any orders. I wonder if they even noticed we left. Even to give us water to start while we looked at the menu. Nope that didn't happen. 

Ramen joints are usually quick because I've been to several and they are fast. Service are top notch too. All the broths and toppings are pretty much prepped. It's a matter of just putting it together. They need to get themselves organized and situated or it's gonna be a problem. We are all customers/guests so as a restaurant worker, it's pretty much common sense on how to provide service. We all eat out somewhere so we pretty much know what's expected. It's a step by step process. From reviewers photos, their ramen sure looked good but sorry, lost an opportunity.

I ordered creamy tonkotsu ramen & tempura veggies/shrimp. It was super packed & they didn't  get to me for awhile. I already ordered in advance on the phone, but they did not get my name or number. This caused confusion with other orders and they had to ask other people what their orders were. After picking up, I noticed the soup spilled all over the bag & my car. The soup container had holes in it! :( Thankfully there was some left to eat. The ramen and broth were very good, BUT it was missing the corn which was listed to be part of the creamy tonkostu ramen. :( Corn is one of my favorite additions to ramen so that was upsetting. I will be back for sure since the food is good. They'll probably tighten up soon.

We came in  a little after the dinner rush and the place was still fairly packed. Waters came quickly but we had to wave someone down to take our order after sitting there with the menus closed for 10 minutes. The server had said he'd be right back to take orders when he brought out the water.

Service: Poor, pretty much non existent after taking our initial order. No check ups or anything after waiting over 30 minutes for the food to come out. My water cup was empty and they did not bring water until after the food arrived. I could've used a refill during the lull. The servers don't have specific sections so we were receiving overlapping service.

Food: Ordered the Agedashi Tofu and it was bad. Instead of the traditional thin layer of crispy starch, it was deep fried in tempura batter. The ramen Miso and Garlic Oil ramen were decently portioned for the price. I like that they include half an egg and spice for no additional charge. The egg however, is not seasoned and just plain boiled. 

Overall: Truly it deserves two stars but I'll be nice since they are brand new and still going through growing pains. We're still thankful for a Ramen shop near home and will be back!",H-aP41mXiys_hQPBAu1yYg,0,0,3,4d5gFGQjlmsTbIT6hmICdw

Our ramen was warm but people next to us had steam coming from there ramen. Second our popcorn shrimp was more like bread and there sauce there was no shrimp. This place is very inconsistent and it could be a 5 Star. What is really embarrassing is I recommended this place to a friend who happens to be a ramen lover and I was embarrassed inviting him.

5517532,2017-12-31,3,-ADtl9bLp8wNqYX1k3KuxA,"Busy, yes. Limited seating, yes. Which could be why it appears busier had it been alot more spacious in there. I've been to many ramen houses not only in the valley, but ramen houses in Japan...and honestly, they've all been pretty limited in seating. Does it suck having to wait in the brrrr because of a verryy verrrry limited seating area in the waiting area? Yeah. When it's busy, those waiting tend to stand behind those seated at the bar. If I were eating and there were people standing behind me...it'd ruin my vibe for real. 

None-the-less, I've had to wait about a good 20mins before being seated, thankfully, not at the bar. I don't really recommend this place if you have a large group (7+) because your wait could be even longer, and most likely you'll be separated. I think to alleviate their lobby, they should seriously consider the beeper system so people don't feel the worry of missing their name being called. 

I do appreciate the fact when their waiting area is crowded, a hostess will go around asking if everyone's name has been jotted down jussst incase, you know. There's always that one person who enters, that'll just stand there disoriented at all the busyness. Lol.

Each visit I have stuck with my order of the crispy rice tuna and the black garlic ramen. The first time my crispy rice tuna was not as crispy, so it did break on me while picking it up with my chopstick. While I was bummed about that...it was still good and at that point, tis all that mattered. Besides, crispy rice is merely texture. The next time I visited, they got the crispy rice on point. My tastebuds was amused.

If you like gah-lic at all...the black garlic ramen is the way to go. It was delicious on each visit, my ramen noodles were cooked fantastically, and that garlicky essence was present, annnd I have yet to experience a bland or salty visit. Lol. My broth came out at a nice temp to warm my chest and make me sniffle. 

It could easily be a 3.5 star experience for many, but 4 stars for me because I'm not going to compare it with other places. We have a ramen joint in the NW, y'all. Appreciate -because it'll save you a drive. Our area is slowly but surely picking up on the food vibe. Parking is much easier than alot of other places, staff is busy but not neglectful and friendly. 

Keep the stroller at home, parents. They do have high-chairs! Definitely recommend giving them a shot especially if you're in the area. I find it worth the try. I appreciate the fact that the prices doesn't seem to be inflated because of its advantage being the only ramen spot in the vicinity.

5593582,2018-04-14,1,-ADtl9bLp8wNqYX1k3KuxA,"Our family spent three years in Japan, and since returning to the states, we (unfortunately, to some) have developed a relatively ""elitist"" view on Japanese cuisine. (Lucky I'm Yelp Elite, right? ...Hello? Is this mic on...?)

I wholeheartedly agree with another Yelper on here - The food here is nearly as amazing - and authentic - as the ramen we had in Japan. But I'll get to the food in a moment...

We were immediately greeted when we walked in with a hearty ""irrashaimase"" (welcome!) by a staff member, who took our name down for their list. We only waited 15 minutes at about 7 pm; not really peak but they definitely had a longer wait list by the time we left. One issue I noted was there wasn't too much sitting space for people waiting - 5, maybe 6 people squeezed on 2 benches. Yes there was room outside, but it was still windy and chilly, so inside was preferable. While you're waiting inside, there is a running video/slideshow featuring some of the food - safe to say it was enticing and definitely inspired our meal choices.

Decor was great - dark grey-toned wood paneling was very modern and trendy, which gave the place a feel of 'old world traditional ramen meets 21st century spins.' They have a combination of bar seating, booths, and 'farm-style' tables with benches. Our one table had our backs to the walkway to the kitchen, so it saw a lot of traffic. It felt a bit crowded at the tables, which were pretty much back to back, but if you were at the booths or the bar, you had a bit more room between you and the next diners.

Service: Our server, Joshua, we on POINT. He was upbeat, very positive demeanor, very professional, and enthusiastic about Ichi Ramen. He knew the menu well and provided his recommendations, which, for our first time there, we followed many of them, but I'll get to that later. He was terrific. He even had a recommendation ready for my toddler (which she loved)! Other than asking for initial silverware/chopsticks, it was like he was reading our mind. We never had to ask for a beverage refill, he was quick to clear or table of empty plates/bowls AND little garbage (wrapper for the chopsticks, wrapper for the kids chopstick helper, etc.). He seemed to know - without being pushy or rushing - when we were about done, and brought us to-go containers, followed by the check, again ALL without having to ask or even wave him down! COLOR ME IMPRESSED!

Now, the FOOD (Finally. Sorry guys, but thanks for sitting through me painting the experience for you!):
* The Creamy Tonkatsu Ramen was spectacular. Great soup base, and the noodles were PERFECT. Definitely comparable to the real thing. Thick without being too chewy, and didn't get soggy, even with our letovers the next day. The toppings definitely added to the textures and flavors as well. My one issue (and this is purely subjective due to comparisons) is that the chyasu (pork) is relatively small in size and a bit dry. In Japan, we would get these size-of-your-hand, thick cuts of pork with more fat/marbling on it that lends to the meat's added tenderness and melt-in-your mouth texture. This change would definitely get tha tlast star from me.
* The Deep-fried Soft Shell Crab was amazing! Great crunch, very meaty, and was accompanied by some drizzles and some kind of slightly sweet, tangy topping that added to the savory flavor.
* The Gyoza wasn't too salty or greasy, and the dip that accompanied it was very complimentary. My one issue with this was that I wish it had a bit more or a crisp/crunch to the gyoza (assuming they were pan-fried) - this would have made it a perfect 10 replica to the gyoza we've had at ramen houses in Japan.
* Crispy Rice with Tuna: I personally loved this! You know when you fry rice and there's that really hard, crispy part at the bottom of the pan? It's like that, with soft tuna on top, with drizzles of sauces and a sliver of jalapeno. The flavors and textures WORKED: spicy, tangy, creamy soft tuna with crispy hard rice.. This was a personal favorite!
* Popcorn Shrimp: Not bad! I half pictured something from KFC or similar, but this was much more akin to 'honey glazed prawns with walnuts' from a Chinese restaurant. I can't speak to the 'authenticity' of this because I don't think I've had anything like this in Japan, but it was pretty good! I was just so full at this point that I couldn't eat too much of it, but the breading and frying was light and airy, the shrimp was cooked to perfection, and the drizzle was light and sweet - not at all overbearing. 

Overall, I loved it. a few changes would easily score this a perfect 5/5 stars for me. But I absolutely plan to visit here again and I highly recommend this place to others! Thank you again to Joshua for his OUTSTANDING, above and beyond service!",NO7hzgi7ZS3b2D5gNi2Gfg,2,3,4,JBlOvF4NwJEXkZmjKQ1pRA

Right away we noticed the eggs were overcooked. The meet taste ok, but was cut so thin. It wasn't hearty meat I have come to love in my ramen. The black garlic tonkotsu was good as well as the noodles. Overall it wasn't bad but just didn't live up to the many great ramens in the city.",O-nFhs8UBvWaCkgkOTynDw,5,1,3,fiJsPG39oDorMgIdu08sPw

But this ramen was amazing! It met all of our needs.

If you go, you must try the Spicy Miso Ramen. We shared that one and it was incredible.

Other than that, the customer service seemed to be great/friendly and the atmosphere/decoration was traditional and nice.

There wasn't just ramen on the menu and I'm sure the other stuff was great too. So whether you're craving ramen or not, you really cant go wrong with this place! Would highly recommend.",qHXFK5iYvj1HgpQZ02Ni1Q,1,1,5,2BYSGPBFLp4DpGx8UjtCbw

I had the Tomato Seafood Ramen and it was delicious and had great flavor. My only wish would be for there to be more scallops. I only had a half of one and it was a small one.  Fair amount of shrimp(they are very small though) and clams.  My sister had the chicken ramen and she really liked hers too. We also got the tempura brussel sprouts but they were very hard and I have dentures and couldn't eat them. . I will definitely be back.,79Ea49GrBLDPQMewNGtSlw,0,1,4,Tx7zMtItNnIzhrD0E9EwqQ

Anytime I review a Ramen place I always use Monta as my frame of reference. They're seriously the king of Ramen in Vegas. This place is so close to home & i've been meaning to try it for that reason. I would appreciate not having to drive all the way to Spring Mountain in order to get my Ramen fix. The menu is pretty extensive they have more options for standard bowls than Monta. The add-ons are also less expensive. In order to get an egg you will only pay one dollar (versus $1.50 at Monta). Not to mention in most of the bowls you actually already receive your first egg and corn included. WIN ON THAT FRONT!! The broth is solid. The add ins are tasty. The only reason they don't win a four or five? The NOODLES. That is after all the whole point of the trip. These noodles are more reminiscent of the packaged ones, than of most Ramen places. Don't get me wrong. They're thick, less likely to get soggy but they're definitely not the quality being used at other places. You can tell that by just looking at the way the noodle has that little Ramen curl. 
Another downside for me is that they don't have chili oil or minced garlic. I've come to appreciate those little perks because they pair nicely as a dipping sauce for GYOZA! 
All in all, I'll definitely be back, but for Ramen... my overall recommendation is still the king. Monta.",lBYr_iY0idEpsVEQkaEBmg,1,0,3,88Dc-CfJsa1zeGhjSzBQ1g

5889397,2018-06-30,0,-ADtl9bLp8wNqYX1k3KuxA,"Ichi Ramen is on Centennial and celebration way.  Make a left on Celebration and make a left in the parkinglot make a quick left to the end where you'll see two palm trees.  It is a small place with eight or so booths and 4 person tables.  Our servers were Drew and Kevin and they were nice guys.  There may be a  wait until you are seated with your party.  The menu is small but I urge you to order the combination plate around $13.00.  It comes with the ramen of your choice, small bowl of salad drizzled with their signature sesame dressing and a sushi roll or gyoza, your choice.  I went with their signature pork katsu curry ramen and their crunch roll drizzled with katsu sauce and Japanese mayo.
  My sibling got the tonkatsu ramen with spicy tuna roll for his combo. 
  My girlfriend I think got the tonkatsu ramen, signature rolls, Takoyaki balls.  
Takoyaki balls can use more tako in it. I think it only had one to two pieces in it.
The curry ramen was pretty good, different but good. The curry is not at Zen curry but everyone has to make it their own and I was fine with that.  You can ask for their spice to add and I went a little much with two scoops.  Do only one or you will be sweating.  It went well with my crunch rolls, the salad was okay.  I tried my girlfriend's signature roll and it tasted like my crunch roll.  I can't tell a huge difference  between the two.  I tried one spicy tuna roll and it was your normal.  I tried their broth on the tonkatsu ramen and it is like the jinya ramen just their twist.  The broth was perfect as nothing needs to be added.  Why 4 instead of 5? I still like Jinya Ramen more but no way I am complaining.  The Takoyaki needs more tako in it.
