We had cucumbers and tofu with preserved egg as starters, then had beef and tendon noodle soup and cold noodles. The portions for the noodle dishes were smaller than what you would expect for entrees but obviously you shouldn't expect that for $5 or less. They were tasty nevertheless. We added an order of boiled dumplings as we weren't quite full. They were also good.

Their menu has changed to combine the old Liang's Kitchen and China Mama, which is an affiliated business.

Service was ok, but minimal, and while the waitress peered over a couple of times never really came to check in on us and we had to go to the cashier to ask for the check.

1307577,2017-06-21,0,YTfXZ9tbTBJkWsDI7cMDWQ,"Unfortunately we came in on a Tuesday where they don't have the normal menu because the main chef is off. 

So we ordered the 
-beef roll
-pork chop rice
-soup dumplings
-beef stew noodle

Beef roll is described as a scallion pancake wrapped in they sliced beef. The pancake texture was just right, it was not too crunchy or too raw in terms of under cooked dough

Pork chip rice wasn't the most impressive dish but the rice they used was great compared to all the other Chinese rice I've tasted

Soup dumplings - the wrap they used tasted a lil bit Chinese, but at least it is fresh and not frozen. The filling was bigger than most soup dumplings I've tried. I wished there were more soup inside. The temperature was just right and not scorching when it came out. Overall not the best soup dumplings I've had but well worth a try

The beef noodle stew was my favorite. The soup was not too oily like a lot of restaurants I tried and it has an interesting spicy taste to it. The beef is what stood out, it melted in my mouth in comparison to most which is really dry

I rated this 5 stars because this tiny hole in the wall should get a lil more recognition in terms of food and a great staff or at least our waiter",SaD9_drXyVGxV1Nzi2kkQA,0,0,5,RTFwvvY6ZrkL4qxEU066Ww

1380601,2017-03-17,0,YTfXZ9tbTBJkWsDI7cMDWQ,"Came here for dinner unexpectedly, suggested by family from a recommendation from mom's coworker, and recently visited by some friends as well. Liang's Kitchen used to be in Chinatown but I guess recently moved (within 1-2 years). Weird that it had moved to a location where it has changed a few times and next to a real estate brokerage. Liang's Kitchen was a restaurant I was familiar with having in San Jose a few years ago. Popular Taiwanese style cuisine known for their noodles and other items. 

Xiao Long Bao (8) - Steamed dumplings with pockets of soup within. When done well, its amazing. When we got our two orders, we had started to eat them as soon as it was delivered. Upon delivery to table, they already looked a bit shriveled up. When eating the XLB, some had maybe a few drops, some maybe a little more. None of the XLB where plump and full of soup. The meat texture was rough and a bit overcooked feeling. 

Pan Fried Chive/Pork Buns (6) - ""shang jian bao"" is typically a ""bao"" filled with pork or other ingredients, cooked in a pan from raw to where the bottom half of the bun forms a really crispy/crunchy crust with the top half still being soft. Their version has a very minimal crust to where it almost seemed like they pan fried it for a minute or two, and threw it all into the steamer. The bun itself was very ""soft and moist"" on the outside. You have the choice of chive or pork or you can split the 6 buns half pork and half chive. Those with chive will be differentiated with a sprinkle of black sesame seeds on top. Filling flavor wise was nice and not over-done. Pork style is mainly pork. Chives is mainly with chives, glass noodles, and egg. 

Mama's Special Pan Fried Chive/Pork Buns (8) - ""shui jian bao"" apparently a derivative of the ""traditional"" ""shang jian bao - pan fried bun"", is an interesting dish. Similar to a pan fried bun but they pan-fry the buns with either some water or broth creating a crispy bottom later, similar to what you may have seen in other restaurants done with dumplings called maybe ""crystal dumplings"". The crispy bottom layer is yummy to eat itself and often not enough for people to pick at XD. Surprisingly, being a ""water-fried"" bao, the bao itself was ""drier"" than the pan fried bun previously. Didn't exactly make sense. LOL. Same as the previous pan fried bun, they are offered in a chive or pork version and able to split half and half. Same type of filling. 

Beef Roll - typical style beef roll where thinly sliced beef with cilantro and sauce rolled in a green onion pancake style of wrap. 2 wraps cut into 4 servings each per order. Nothing special but not bad either. Would have preferred a little more beef. Seemed a little lacking in amount. Sauce amount was good. Not too much, not too little. 

Pork stuffed Pocked Bread (4) - out of the buns/wraps, this was probably the best. little hard to describe but ill try my best. From my speculation, these are similar to those ""jian bing"" in shanghai where they create a thin crepe-like wrap, add ingredients, and fold to create a closed pocket. Cook the sides enough to create a crispy texture, cut in half, and serve. As the name may suggest, they are minced pork stuffed ""pockets"". Kind of similar to this chive pocket that I love eating. Would be great if they added chives to this too but the pork itself was nice and flavorful. Additional $3 gets you 2 more pieces.  

Shanghai style thick noodles - one of the two suggested items by mom's coworkers and one of my two favorite items to order in terms of shanghai cuisine. To my disappointment though, they did NOT use thick noodles... if in fact, they were fairly thin noodles. Flavor wise, was pretty nice. Not too salty. Just sad about the noodles. That's one of my favorite aspects of this dish. Also has thin pieces of pork, spinach, and napa cabbage cooked with the noodles as well.  

Shanghai style rice cakes - the other favorite item I usually order. Amount wise, it was a little smaller than expected. Flavor, same as the thick noodles. Though TBH, besides the difference of noodles vs rice cake, I think they are almost the same XD. 

Lion's Head in Hot Pot - my family's favorite dish of the meal. Lion's head is a shanghai staple item often known as the ""Chinese meatball"". Lol cooked and braised to a perfection in a hot pot. Soft meatball soaked in flavor. its almost hard not to eat a bowl or two of rice with this. My uncle and cousin went through a few bowls themselves on this dish alone. HAHA. Outer layer of meatball dusted in a starch of some kind and fried, creating a skin similar to a fried tofu, then braised in a savory sauce. Oh so good :) 

Funny, them being a Taiwanese based restaurant, they did better on shanghai dishes than the Taiwan ones. Granted some are Taiwanese as well but some may understand. 

Overall, not bad of a place. Pricey though. Id probably return for the lions head hot pot or similar but not the dumplings/bao.",Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,2,2,3,aggIGH2jRhgA9N_SX0sUzg

They located on the blue building on Flamingo and Lindell. They shared parking lot with a realtor offices next door but I was able to find parking easily, plenty of parking space around. Building was a little old but they kept things clean and unique on the inside. 

I ordered their pocketed bread stuffed with pork $9.99 and LOVED it! The outside sesame pastry was crispy and the pork stuffing inside was tasty! Super good and must try! 

I also had their dry noodle with beef $10.25. I chose thin noodle and thought it was pretty good. The beef brown sauce had a strong pepper spicy taste. So if you are not a fan, you should probably ask for less sauce. Other than that, I thought their portion and food were good. 

Prices were higher than other  noodle place around the area such as Shang Noodle but still reasonable for lunch. 

Service was excellent. I was able to get in and out within the hour and had plenty of time to enjoyed my lunch! Hot tea was a complimentary too.

My first impression was good! Lots of Asian restaurants can be quite dingy, dark, and dirty. However, Liang's is modern, well decorated, and clean! I loved the planes that hung on the ceiling. Our server told us the owner's husband used to fly planes in Taiwan. So cute! I loved that they added their personal touches but in a cute way rather than random.

What we ordered:
Bok Choy with mushrooms and bamboo shoots - holy shit get this! These three ingredients complimented each other very well. The sauce it was cooked in was delicious. The Bok Choy was tender, another plus. We really enjoyed these veggies. 

Fish with hot chili sauce - We asked them if they could make it mild AF, they said it was no problem! Came out pretty quickly in a huge portion. Could need a little more salt but still good and we devoured every bit of it. I dipped a few of the pieces in vinegar and enjoyed it. 

Shrimp two ways - Pretty good! Half cooked in a sweet and sour-esque tomato sauce while the second half was a more simple sauté. Again, a huge portion, but this dish was also on the pricier side. Prob wouldn't this again but it was good!

XLB - Not the best XLB I've had, but still hit the spot!!

Overall, we really enjoyed our experience at Liang's. The service was prompt and friendly! This can be quite rare at an Asian restaurant so that was another huge plus. Definitely will be back to Liang's next time we're in Vegas.",p8VlaSVW1cLCNA9RHNP90w,2,1,4,v4nne_itnNk-7cUFMgjJMQ

Compared to little kitchen-pork chop rice, they give you 4 side dishes which are not flavorless. Although  their pork chop was a bit over cooked the day when I tried, it is only 8 dollars.

When you walk in there are about 50 model war planes hanging from the ceiling escorting you to your table. The menu is not the American style Chinese food but is more authentic type I've had in China on past trips. The food was excellent and the portions were the right size not oversized but not skimpy. I had the Mongolian beef and it was very tender and had plenty of flavor. I also had the chow main like noodle dish but I had them make it with the wide noodles.   This is the only place in Las Vegas where
they hand make the noodles and you can tell. They have such a wonderful consistency with a fresh taste. The only negative I found was that the service was absolutely horrible. It was slow and almost non existent. Besides having to wait a long time to place my order I had to go up to the counter to get napkins and silverware for my son. It took even longer to get the check and a to go box. This place would be great if the service would improve here.",QH9i-p3cvlI8G18PE4aVkA,0,0,4,NcKJGNtA8He_UOCVpgwsRQ

2831036,2018-04-04,0,YTfXZ9tbTBJkWsDI7cMDWQ,"I first visited Liang's Kitchen after reading a glowing review in a recent Las Vegas Weekly magazine.  Liang's Kitchen is Taiwanese cuisine.  I was pleasantly surprised to learn that they had changed the menu since that review, reduced the size of portions, and that all menu items are now $5.00 or less.  .

This afternoon when I entered, there were only 6 empty tables, with none of the empty dishes having been cleared away.  I ordered the beef wrap and beef & tendon soup.  The soup was brought very promptly, but when I finished eating the homemade noodles, beef, tendon, and vegetables, I realized I had not been given a spoon.  After finally catching the waitress' attention I finally got a spoon.  But I had to ask for hot tea 3 times, and when it finally arrived, it was a pot of hot water and a tea bag on a separate plate.  This is not typical of Chinese restaurants!  Also tea is generally brought as soon as you sit down.

When the owner's son or the male waiters are there, they are very attentive.  However, the female waitress on duty this afternoon was totally inattentive.  As I was finishing my meal, the empty tables when I came in, were finally being cleared.  But I observed something rather unusual.  On one of those tables, most of the food had not been eaten.  The customers had been long gone.  The waitress packed that uneaten food in take-out containers which she then took back into the kitchen.  I'm not sure that is in compliance with health regulations.  Was the waitress planning on taking that leftover food home and eating it herself later!",0PjSykzxXt8o98Qrm7P4pA,0,0,3,vrXNqjdhL7gyI9o6dVKFSA

We ordered a massive amount of food: xiao long bao, shengjianbao, beef noodle soup with fat noodles, beef tendon, seaweed, spicy wontons, and green onion pancakes.

I wasn't a huge fan of the baos, and I've had much better. I think they didn't have enough soup. The other dishes were decent though. They do give you a lot of food.

Started with the cold seaweed which was surprisingly good. Then followed by the Xiao long bao. The broth of the Dumpling was pretty mediocre however I kept putting dollops of chili sauce on it mixed with a little bit of the vinegar solution that they put on the table. 

Next was the pork pockets pastries. These were actually quite good as it was pork sauteed with hot peppers and other spices stuffed into a nice Sesame pastry. This was by far the best thing I tried here.

Lastly the entree we had was the green onion chicken. I was unaware that this dish came out room temperature to cold and was pretty bland tasting. And to be honest I really could not get past the texture of the chicken skin and Bland meat texture. 

The service here was good, however the food here is pretty mediocre in comparison to other places I have tried on the East Coast.",D3fOi-5w4intrUTWXzIQew,2,2,3,6r_xFya41M6-R9gKlJbyQg
3250828,2016-10-20,0,YTfXZ9tbTBJkWsDI7cMDWQ,"My buddy and I decided to give this place a try due to their high ratings (despite only 17 reviews). We split the sesame pocket bread with minced pork, pork chop with rice, and a half order of duck. 

Sesame pocket bread- It was pretty solid but a little bit dry. I enjoyed the flakiness of the bread, and the minced pork was flavorful. 
Pork chop- the pork chop was seasoned well but a little too sweet for my liking. The minced pork on top of the rice was a nice addition to the dish (probably same minced pork from the pocket bread). 
Half duck- no bueno. I thought it would have been roasted, but it was cold and also very gamey. It didn't come with hoisin sauce or anything. The server was kind enough to take it away and off our bill. 

I hate to say this, but I don't know if we'll be back. The server was really nice and all, but IMO, I would rather go to Big Wong's for half the price.",NCRGj36ihdwX-VUCYEX41g,4,1,4,c8kwBLNFtGyDegEgdp1MfQ

3445660,2017-03-04,1,YTfXZ9tbTBJkWsDI7cMDWQ,"I had Liang's Kitchen bookmarked for a while, and finally made it over to try it out. It's located in a standalone building with a realty agency next door. It was definitely a little more off the beaten path, but the parking situation is not as bad as a result.

The interior was smaller than I expected, but as others have mentioned, it is quite modern, clean, and contemporary. The many airplanes and Taiwanese flag caught my eye.

Although the cuisine listed in this Yelp listing is Taiwanese and Chinese, I would argue that Taiwanese food does not make up the majority of the menu offerings. While there are some Taiwanese staples, Liang's Kitchen serves up a lot of Sichuan dishes and a random assortment of Chinese dishes that probably can't be attributed to any particular region. The menu is extensive though, and the dishes are certainly authentic.

There were some simplified characters in the menu, and some of the servers and cooks were definitely mainland Chinese, but I'm sure at least one of the owners is Taiwanese, and the logo does tout ""Taiwanese flavors.""

But I digress. The service was very friendly, certainly above average for a Chinese restaurant. Granted, all of my interactions with my waitress were in Mandarin.

I ended up getting two dishes I had never heard of before: ???? (a cold and slightly spicy appetizer dish mixture of bean curd, pig's ear, and sliced beef with tendon) and ??? (literally ""big mouth pastry,"" a flaky sesame seed pastry pocket stuffed with minced pork and scallions). The portions were fair for the price, but I spent almost $20 for the two dishes (though they did fill me up). Both were very tasty. The appetizer was a bit salty, but it was more tolerable paired with the pastry. The pastry would have even tastier sprinkled with a little white pepper, but the white pepper shaker on my table was empty and I was too lazy to ask for a new one.

After the new year, prices went up by a lot and quality goes down drastically. I used to come here almost daily but since the change, my last experience here last week will be the last.  First of all, the dinning area has a BO now. I don't think they wipe down the tables and chairs thoroughly. Second, the chef forgets to put seasoning in the food. We had to send the food back to the kitchen. Third, they cut down on the quantity of food per order. Everything got smaller. Meat dishes have half the usual meat.

We both shared this hot pocket looking dish that was stuffed with some herbs and I think ground beef.

That would be a dish I'd order again because it was awesome in terms of having a crunchy shell and being filled with savory meat while also having that freshness factor with the herbs. For my personal dish I got the bean bean noodles which was okay. I felt like I was mainly just eating carbs and they could give a bit more sauce and meat! It was like eating a plate of spaghetti with one serving of marinara sauce lol. The flavor itself wasn't too bad, they just need to fix their sauce to noodles ratio.

So far celery beef, shredded tofu with pork, basil chicken, pan fried pork buns, meat ball stewed in cabbage/mushroom (lions head).  Beef stew and dried noodle al dente (wide hand tossed noodle) Crispy chicken with Sichuan garlic sauce is basically breaded chicken fried steak, with garlic sauce with a hint of sweet sour. Despite the name Sichuan garlic sauce its not spicy at all. 

 All dishes are tasty, portions enough for two meals.  Complimentary hot tea are very tasty.  This is a great addition to our thriving Asian food scene.

Having been here over a dozen times, we have come to appreciate Taiwan's comfort food, or home cooking. Waitresses have warmed up and provide good service. Their doughy items, buns or pancakes, are very tasty. New favorite is Beef stew in wider dry noodle, al dente. Mix it up b4 eating, enjoy.",2HNU4vNP8c_EtWG4MhlVVw,2,2,5,a5OnZPekMCy9hOhh1EC36Q

5148698,2017-06-10,0,YTfXZ9tbTBJkWsDI7cMDWQ,"This is probably one of the best and most authentic Taiwanese restaurants in Las Vegas. It's a little hard to find (it shares a building with an insurance company), but just a little searching and you will find the most amazing food.

If you've been here maybe 5+ months ago, the food was maybe not so good, but they've recently switched chefs and boy oh boy is the food delicious.

When my dad and I go, we always order some cold dishes, especially the noodles. Every Tuesday is Noodle Day! The beef noodle soup is also quite good for those of you who know that Taiwan is famous for their beef noodle soup.

Their soup portions are also pretty large. I would say the small can feed about 2-4 people.

One day when we came we were quite lucky and they served us passionfruit juice and it was so good, but they don't do this every day, so don't expect it, but if you go and get some kind of juice when you sit down, it's quite delicious.

For appetizers: 
- Honeycomb in spicy sauce and oil: was served cold. It was not fresh when tasted. 
- Mini dumplings in spicy sauce and oil: also served cold and the portion was pretty small.
- Xiao Long Bao was hot and yummy.
For main dishes:
- We tried Mongolian beef and crispy chicken in Sichuan sauce and they were good just on average. 
- Fish fillet with pickled mustard soup WAS A TURNDOWN! I tried this soup in a lot of Chinese/Taiwanese restaurants but this place, man, the soup was bland and tasteless. Fish fillet did not taste like fresh fishes. I barely finished my tiny soup bowl. 

Overall, the staff was inattentive. We asked for a cup of water and the server did not bring it out until 10mins after. Later when we asked for more water, it never came. I noticed that the servers were on their phones. The foods were pricey comparing to its small portion.

We tried the house special Onion Oil Chicken and the Steamed Fish Filet in the first visit.  Both are so good that we decided to come back again the next day, before departing Vegas.  The 2nd time we ordered the Spicy Jalapeño Beef, Mapo Tofu and Muster Green with Edamame Beans and Bean Curd.  All 3 dishes are made to perfection, again!

We then decided to order some snacks for take-out as we will get home by dinner time and these snacks will be perfect for dinner.  We ordered the Beef Wrap, Pork Pocket and Chive Pocket; needlessly to say we had a wonderful light dinner and breakfast the next morning.

My strong recommendation for Vegas visitors (or residents) - when you are sick and tired of the casino buffet like we are, give Liang's Kitchen a try, you will like it and include it on your to do list for Vegas, next to Bellagio's music fountain.

We waited for a couple minutes to be seated but there literally was no one eating inside the establishment. We were sat in a booth and asked if we would like water or tea. We choose tea and it was really good. Before ordering I got up to use their restroom and it was really hot inside there. Not sure if the AC reaches all the way back there.

My husband and I shared a beef roll, soup dumplings, and beef noodle soup. Everything was very delicious. I really like how they make their own noodles. It made the dish even better. I mixed the chili sauce they provided on the table with the sauce they gave for the soup dumplings. It gave it a bit more flavor and was very satisfying. 

Overall, service was okay. I had to ask for water a few times before our server actually came and gave it to us. The food was excellent. The left over beef roll was still good the next day.",P0rGN5mDue55uIiAzkrRlw,2,1,4,ilUhQRbUN9HCBHE3aT3v0w
