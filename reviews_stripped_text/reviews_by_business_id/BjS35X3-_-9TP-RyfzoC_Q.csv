The 2nd time we went they were closed during business hours an there was a note saying they closed at 4 that day.The last time we went, I called first to make sure they were open.  She assured me they were open and would be til 10:00 PM.  Upon arrival an hour later, , we noticed no cars in the parking lot and it was dark.  There was a note on the door saying they were closed early....AGAIN!!
I'm no business owner, but I do know this is no way to run a business, closing early whenever they want, not being open during business hours, saying over the phone they were open til 10 and then closing early.It was unexcusable behavior on their part and not much business sense and I've got to say that after giving them 3 chances, they lost us as customers.  Since they never want to stay open for their loyal customers, we are never going back. The food was good but their business sense is questionable.  Before you head out there, I would call first, but I guarantee they will be closed anyway!",z9YPtdnxbyvhqfPBOQYYhw,1,0,1,baRrJRAHlYy21MIRQHBOTQ

They are decent prices and I actually enjoyed the food more than Egg Works. The biscuits and gravy platter was huge and I ate every bite. My boyfriend got the chicken fried chicken and waffles and that was delicious too! The waffle was fluffy and chicken wasn't pounded too thin. 

I would come back in a heartbeat and try one of the Hashes that they offer as well. Please keep up the fast and friendly service. Food came out in a short time, was hot and they even offered to fill my coffee several times.",HpjM1cw7Yo37mykS-9y0Nw,1,0,5,Zquu4dt1vNz96aRrkqc0dg

457317,2017-01-16,0,BjS35X3-_-9TP-RyfzoC_Q,"First and foremost, the prices on the menu link on Yelp are not even remotely close.  I got the French Dip sandwich and it was $10.50.  The price at the menu link said $6.49.  Granted, it came with fries for that price but that's still a pretty large difference.  To be fair, the menu is not their official menu but you should be aware that what's here is way low.

As to the quality of the sandwich: meh...  It was pot roast with cheese melted on it.  It was served on a toasted bun.  I was struck by the size of the sandwich.  The bun was about the size of a hot dog bun and the meat and cheese didn't cover it.  For that price, I would expect a large sub roll packed with meat.  The flavor wasn't bad, but it wasn't anything special.  One other thing to note, the ""au jus"" that came with the sandwich was, for lack of a better term, weird.  It was pale yellow in color and was essentially flavorless.  The fries that came with the sandwich were also pretty mediocre.  Lot's of small pieces.

My daughter got a hamburger with bacon and said she enjoyed it.  Although, the menu pricing was way off on this item too.  It was $6.79 with fries while the price on the menu was $2.99 without fries.

Our bill for a sandwich, a burger (with bacon) and two drinks was $25.  That's pretty expensive for a so-so lunch.  We won't be back.",u7PMejT-ypJ6YGR7eEGClg,0,0,2,R4Ssn2LPIKMZaimay3euYA

We were greeted and taken to our table. The lay out of the tables is great very evenly spaced and plenty of booths. You can also sit on the counter; great for single diners. 

I had two things that I wanted to try. Either the chicken fried steak or new your steak breakfast. I orders the fried version and I am glad I did. Here is why; the steak was fried to perfection and the breading was perfect. Super crispy and just enough flavor to go with the gravy. Eggs cooked to order. I opted for the English muffin instead of toast and I am happy that I did. The muffin was toasted perfectly. Home potatoes was awesome. Next time I will ask for hash browns. The breading on the steak is what I really enjoyed. I would have to say that this is in the top 3 of my chicken fried steak list and I am picky when it comes to my chicken fried steak. I just wished they offered grits.

Service was good. Took a while to get a waiter for our order but I was offered drinks immediately. My coffee was refilled 2x without asking. It's a very good sign of great service. I see some yelpers has issues with service but it may be an isolated incident. The food came out on time and it was appetizingly presented on a plate.

I really want this place to be successful because the people here are nice and it's a small business - not a chain. The food is awesome. I want to try other things and I will definitely be back. Price to value is good. They do not have a kids menu but I don't think it's a deal breaker. Not a big deal.

I ate the pulled pork breakfast plate.  My eggs were cooked perfectly.  Since I ask for over medium eggs I know it's hit or miss with most places.   Pulled pork was savory and the green sauce was just spicy enough. It was topped with potatoes and cheese that set it off.

1455113,2016-05-16,0,BjS35X3-_-9TP-RyfzoC_Q,"So when we got there, there was only one couple waiting to be seated. After we had waited about 10 minutes, a few other people had come in and were waiting as well. The original couple asked a passing waitress, whom I later found out her name was Jackie, when they can get their to-go order that they had already been waiting for at least 20 minutes. Jackie was REALLY extra snooty saying, ""I am right now the busboy, the server, and the cashier!"" Then she walked away. And there was a busboy and a busgirl there helping so I knew it wasn't all true. 
Me and my two friends laughed to ourselves when she walked away and said that we hoped she wasn't our server. She was! While waiting to be sat we looked at the menus. They keep a large unkempt pile of them for you to grab off the unoccupied hostess stand. The menus are basically printed on paper kept in a clipboard, fine I guess but it shouldn't be soooo many pages long. 
We finally got sat, got to the table and the seat has a huge rip in it. Repaired with red duct tape to match the red seat. This is a repair job of approximately 12""x6"". For a newer restaurant, I'm surprised. So anyways, Jackie comes over to take our orders. She asked each of us what we wanted without ever writing it down. Then asked each of us a second time what we wanted while writing it down! Why not do it the first time? Anyways, so she goes away. She comes back about 5 minutes later and says that she had written our order on a menu and not on her pad of paper and didn't know what happened to our order. So she had to take it down again.
So she goes off with our order. We wait. And wait. And wait. By the way, the waiting area is completely full but there are many many cleaned tables that noone was using. They obviously needed more servers, or maybe some were out sick. I don't know but Jackie seemed to be covering everywhere.
We get our food 35 minutes after being seated. And remember only 10 or 11 tables were seated and half of them already had their food. Two of the three orders were wrong. The pancakes were just so so. Also the pancakes had powdered sugar on them which I assume is an additional mistake since I ordered regular pancakes. My eggs, undercooked. The wrong potatoes on one of the other plates, the wrong syrup (I asked for sugar free and received regular). The eggs on the eggs benedict were overcooked, no runny yolk at all. 
All in all a bad experience. Maybe it is a good place, but on this Sunday about 12:30pm on 5/15/16 it was a horrible experience.",dxCce2EdLOAy78Y3fAXCgw,1,0,1,KbV7-yUDmb2gQcpxzwWugQ

The decor is overwhelming, I felt like we were eating at a hoarders house. When the young lady came to seat us, she asked booth or table, I say booth. She leads us to a booth with the bench seat has a gapping hole I it covered in red duct tape. Of all the empty booths she led us to that one. I said can we have one without tape, she points to a table booth combo, and says how about a half booth? Anyways we are sitting there in our half booth half chair table, I asked for water with lemon, cuz our water sucks here in Vegas. We are handed the menu, it's a stack of yellow wrinkled, soiled, papers stapled and put on a clipboard. You have to take them off the clipboard to flip he pages so it's useless. This bothered me more than it should, go laminate them! She brings back our water and says they are freshly cutting lemon right now, instead of waiting to bring them out together. We are still looking at the menu so she said she would be back. I watched a lady walk in from outside, apparently a server just getting in for her shift. She asks if we have been helped and we said yes because we thought we had a server. It wasn't busy in there but all the other tables orders were taken but ours, finally I hear someone behind the garage sale finds asks if someone had helped us, I heard a bit of ""well I asked"", the server comes over and asks for our order and said ""I did ask if you were helped"", to which I said I thought we had but I was mistaken. Still waiting for lemons by the way. The server does what I hate, she doesn't write anything down, we order she walks away comes back asks again my part of the order cuz she forgot already. I got a salad that came in literally a teacup and saucer! The table got more salad than I did, which is sad cuz it was tasty. Next the food comes out fairly quickly, my husbands was wrong, go figure.(write it down!). I had pot roast which was really good but it does say there are peas n carrots no peas were harmed just pretty much meat and potatoes. My husband had steak and eggs when the proper hash browns came out he said it was all good. My suggestions to management, 
-clear a little bit of the decor it's too much! 
-fix the menu(are you a Mexican restaurant or a diner?) I almost left based on the menu alone.
-once you fine tune the menu get it laminated! 
-fix the broken booth seat or avoid sitting people there when there is others to use, duh!
-salad plates! You can keep the size of the salad but you try and eat lettuce out of a teacup and not look like a slob, it's embarrassing. 
-OHHHH, and a big one, stop interrupting customers every minute to ask if everything is ok! We were asked by 4 different people at least 4 times each of we were ""ok?"", that's about 16 times! It was ridiculous.",arvk83HzouLnXXdITrbV-A,2,2,2,JBlRqPV3WIVm4llJ8cQSUw

Their humble beginnings started in downtown Henderson. They are located in a larger place now!!  Corner of Pecos and Russell Rd. Plenty of parking and easier access than the former location. 

Got a quick glance of the menu that lists dishes for breakfast lunch and dinner! Yes! Now open for dinner too! 

My focus was on breakfast since it was early in the day. So I chose a brisket hash,Southwestern style! It's tossed with potatoes and grilled peppers and onions and their own signature chipotle sauce. A cool twist to this breakfast hash. It was good but just a tad spicy for me.  The brisket was really tender!  I should note it's listed as Southwestern ""Briscuit"" Hash and described as beef briscuit.  I guess that is a phonetically plausible way to spell brisket ;) 

Everything here exudes a warm homey feel and country charm! I love the upholstery prints of the booths. The dining area is pretty bright, airy,clean and everything is brand spanking new. They had several large tv screens throughout the place. Had to do an eyeroll to that two star reviewer who has problems with them playing news stations.  If something simple as TV programming offends you, y'all got some issues,,lol

The menus are on copy paper and on clipboards.

You will find a large chalkboard adorned with cute drawings from their artistic young customers. It has the Daily Blue Plate special and Soup Of The Day listed. There's also a chalkboard stand that had Happy Hour specials. 3-5pm? 1/2 off appetizers.

Service was great! There were several tables occupied early AM. The  host/server took the time to acknowledge us and we were seated pretty quickly. Our orders were taken and came out promptly also. No complaints of cold, or lukewarm food from us. Our dishes were steaming, plates were hot. Our drinks refilled without having to ask. As we got up to leave, staff acknowledge us again.

On my second visit to this establishment. I was accompanied by my 4 year old son and we arrived around brunch. We were not dressed elegant as this is a pretty casual place. There was a lady who made eye contact with me from the kitchen but did not say hello. There was also young lady and maybe one or two young men catering to a reasonable sized crowd. Yet they still looked pressured to be hastefully serving the relatively average crowd. There was a couple already there when we arrived and as we were waiting they were pulled to their Seats, still no acknowledgment for us though. Soon enough another couple comes in they sit down for 2-3 mins and the young lady greets them and asks how many... Still not a greeting or even awkward eye contact for us...  That couple who came in after us was even seated and we were never agknowledged so we left.I thought for sure the couple would agknowledge us , but no.

Also, the boyfriend's fave - corned beef hash or whatever- was also on the menu. We had also ordered two large orange juices...first of all, for $4 a glass (it didnt even seem much larger than their normal cups), the orange juice didnt even taste fresh.

After being walked past several times a server stopped by our table with a menu and then told us our server would be right over. Well, many more minutes passed and the same server came back with water and took our drink order and told us our server would be right over. So, again after several minutes another server came over to take our food order. We were set on breakfast and were actually interested in trying their famous hash browns but was informed that they did not have them today!
The food came out pretty quickly and was actually very tasty although the toast came out dry and we had to ask twice to get some butter for it. The servers were actually nice but just so incredibly slow and disorganised that it ruined our whole experience, as did the fact there didn't appear to be any air conditioning in the place.

The NY steak was cooked just the way she liked it and the toast had just the right amount of butter in it.

I've met the owner a couple times and it's refreshing to see an owner check to see if you're enjoying your meal. 
The only thing I would look into would be maybe lessening the menu because it can be overwhelming and maybe laminating them. They are currently just pieces of paper on a clipboard and they get gross really quick. Other than that the place is better than blueberry hill, dennys and IHOP all together.

First, a bit on their service. Honestly, it was fantastic. ""C"" and I ordered iced tea. The Aussie ordered water. Refills were plentiful. For those that know me, I never wanted for a refill. They were managing our table with at least four individuals, including the manager. 

We ordered an omelet, a breakfast skillet and I had the NY Strip and eggs. Mine was good, although my steak was over cooked. I asked for my usual ""very rare"" and it was probably medium. But, it was tasty. Tasty enough I didn't send it back. Steak was. It a top shelf cut by any means (it was $13 for the entree) but had good flavor and reasonably tender. And for me to be ok with it medium it had to be decent. I am also trying to avoid wheat. Although I would have loved a biscuit, i asked for other options and our waitperson quickly offered sliced tomatoes. Perfect. Most places just say sorry when you want something else other than bread. 

C's skillet had chorizo and eggs. One weird thing is they put chunks of potato in the skillet, and then give you hash browns as well. A bit too much potato for her.  But, they also gave her a green and red salsa. She liked them so much that although the skillet was gone, she wanted to take the left over salsa back with her. They were both good

Lastly M had his omelet. He liked it and scarfed it down pretty quick. He asked for hash browns, but only had a few as he was trying to be good on his low carb diet. But, the manager saw this and pushed to get him something else, and offered him green beans with carrots a few times (very nicely). He finally got them as well and between C and M they both liked the vegetables. Very attentive of the manager to see this. 

Overall, I would go back. Heck, may be back this trip. I'll try next time to tell them they over cooked   my steak and really tell them I mean very rare - like 20 - 30 seconds a side. Otherwise our bill was $42.48 and left $8 gratuity. Very reasonable for the three of us walking out quite full. I would recommend!

We figure, maybe the cook and server is new or having a bad day and will give them another few chances. Unfortunately out of the six times we have been there, only two times did we like it.

2975734,2015-05-24,5,BjS35X3-_-9TP-RyfzoC_Q,"After seeing several businesses come and go for this location, I decided to wait a bit before giving this place a shot. After seeing several weeks with a steady flow of cars, today was the day to try them! Walking in, the place is much bigger than I expected and it had a super cozy and fresh vibe with all the decorations and large windows. All of the employees were also really nice and friendly.
Our waters took pretty long to get, basically came when our food came out (around 20-25 minutes) but our server apologized and had a friendly attitude about it so no problem! 

Chicken Fried Steak $9.50: Anytime I try a new place and they have Chicken Fried Steak on the menu, that's usually what I go for lol This one was pretty solid. Came with Sourdough toast (my choice), potatoes, and scrambled eggs. Potatoes could use more flavor, eggs were perfect, sauce was bomb, and the actual fried steak was seasoned good but the breading didn't stick and was sliding right off! Wah! No biggie though, I would still order it again. I still have Rise & Shine and Hard Rock's Mr. Lucky's 24/7 cafe as my leading contenders for the Chicken Fried Steak lol.

Southwestern Brisket Sandwich $9.50: The boyfriend had this one and of course I tasted it lol pretty good as well. The side it normal comes with is I believe french fries or potato salad but my boyfriend is a little weird and requested hashbrowns instead lol Our server asked if he wanted them extra crispy, he said sure. They came out kind of weird lol pretty dry but tasted like straight potato chips lol he'll probably settle for regular hashbrowns next time. Brisket was tender, soft, flavorful and had a good amount of sauce, wasn't dry at all.

One thing that stood out to me was that most of the time these diner-esque places use bad oil and I can taste it pretty heavily in the food. However, the food at this place wasn't even really oily and there was no oil taste at all! Bonus points lol

Overall, I'm not exactly a ""fan"" yet but everything was yummy, the location is super close to me, the ambiance is really neat, and I'll definitely be back mostly for breakfast. Oh and maybe their burgers, one of the tables near us got several burgers and they all looked pretty good :)",Gjv3ERasrRJqtEPa7ZMUSw,9,6,3,JyGG4Y703OnA8lX7hekJgg

So we then phone ordered off of the yelp menu.  I did the math, ordered breakfast for me and my hubby.  I figured maybe phone ordering will be quick in and out.  So I send the hubby and he comes back with no change???  So I rechecked the prices from yelp and it should've been no more that $15.  So I call and spoke with a lady, very nice lady who tells me that the prices they have on Yelp were from 5 years ago and they hadn't updated it yet.  So I can was pissed!

I ask for a iced tea but the waiter tells me their is no iced tea, something was broken or I don't know?  Ok so I just say apple juice.  So we are ready to order and hubby wants a grilled ham and cheese, to our surprise the waiter says they have no ham!!  Damn!!!  So I guess its hit and miss here   I thought maybe we would get a discount since there was no tea or HAM?  Nope!!!  Plus damn glass of apple juice was $4.75??

What you need to know: 

The milkshakes are made with Thrifty ice cream. 
The biscuits are made from scratch.
They serve an open faced hot turkey Thanksgiving style sandwich with white bread soaking up all of the goodness.

I have had the chicken fried steak and enjoyed the crispiness of the steak along with the biscuit and peppery brown gravy. I've also had the grilled cheese on rye which isn't ground breaking in itself, but it was exactly what I like. I have tasted the turkey sandwich mentioned above, but thought the gravy needed some work.

The staff and owner are friendly and accommodating to allergies and preferences. The pricing is also reasonable with lunch specials during the week.

The eclectic decor lives up to the ""hometown"" part of the name and made it feel a bit home-y.

We were given clipboards with pages to thumb through for menus, which was a little odd but fine. My aunt's menu was missing a page but she at least could peek off the others. We all ordered our fair share of breakfast food -- veggie omelette for me, pick-your-own egg meals for the others. The food arrived warm and prompt, and it was delicious! My aunt and I were pleased with our choices of the hometown style potatoes, which included peppers and kick of spice mixed in. My omelette was great; plenty of veggies on the inside nor was it runny!

First off, I came across this gem when stopping by the nearby Sprint Store. I fell in love with the outside appearance of Hometown Eats since it looked like a very cute, friendly restaurant. My fiance and I were talking about how we wished there was a restaurant we could go to monthly, and I even saw ourselves dining there in the far future as 65-year-olds.

We would go there whenever we had the time together (college students, full time work, and fiance is in the military). However, about twice already whenever we would go to the restaurant after work, class, and what not -- the place would be closed and we would have to eat somewhere else more or less satisfying. I'd look at the hours beforehand, but it differed from the hours once we got to the place.

I love the restaurant: the food, atmosphere, staff, decorations, and everything else is just so great. My fiance is starting to lose interest in the restaurant since it closes early at 3 pm now, and I feel pretty sad but understandable as to why he is losing interest. After the third time when we stopped by and it said closing hours are 3, even I started to lose some interest in the restaurant since I don't get out of work and classes until 5 pm.

The food is very delicious and the atmosphere is always so welcoming. However, I feel as if the hours could be improved on. When it used to have closing hours at 8 pm on the weekdays, it was perfect for my fiance and I to meet up after classes and have a nice dinner together. Oh well, can't have best of both worlds!

Other than that, I do recommend for everyone to try this place out. You will be guaranteed to have a good time and an enjoyable experience!",jzEC5V3YUSBVyKxCTggzAw,1,0,3,E2RbkG2BSgIqZfepa2qQZw

Came in with a group of three and were greeted nicely at first; and seated right away. The hostess hands us clipboards with at least 10 sheets each of copy paper; and walks away while we figure out what just happened. We're all removing the pages from these old nasty wooden clipboards; to find that the menu is strewn like a slop shop all over these pages. To over dramatize this further, we couldn't even see the tops of the pages until we removed them; as they were being blocked by the clips on the boards. How utterly f'n annoying! What's worse is that the menu pages are completely out of order; with breakfast lunch dinner and other misc pages all thrown together in a mixed up cluster. Then the hostess comes back and see's that one of us was somewhat perturbed; and goes into a lazy explanation as to why the menus look this way. (btw - we just wanted to eat, not be lectured!) She states that she is the owner, and that her & her husband have come to Vegas from the Midwest; and have failed to make real menu's because they were waiting to see if their business succeeded into a second location. She further indicated that a new location was coming soon, and that only then would they get this menu debacle under control. At this point we were good with the explanation that we didn't even ask for. In fact, the only reason we came in here for our first visit, was to possibly eat some good food. The time was around 1:30pm on a Saturday afternoon; we were then greeted by our waiter and proceeded to order. All of us wanted to order dinner's, since we were really looking forward to their specialties; to be then told that they were not serving any dinners. WTF?? The menu states that dinner's are served starting from 10am daily; with exception to baked potatoes which were only available after 4pm. To make things even more bizarre, the restaurant closes at 3pm daily. So how does anyone order dinner's if they can't be ordered at all. So I guess baked potatoes aren't ever available either; since they are only available after 4pm once the restaurant has been closed already at 3pm? Seriously folks...maybe you can get away with this bs in the Midwest; but this is Las Vegas! Home to customers that want anything and everything whenever and wherever they visit; the flip side being they will simply leave your establishment and never be back, just like us if they cannot even simply order what you offer on your menu! There's always a restaurant's replacement right around the corner, and bs like this will always send us and other's right out your doors. Think that your wallet's won't be harmed by such? Think again, since those who care to go out of their way to grace your establishment, will in fact spend the most $$$. Cash in customers' wallets stays in customers' wallets, when your practices are this discombobulated! To top it all off, we all felt like the hostess/owner had a bit of attitude; which obviously was on purpose when she heard menu frustration from one of us. Ohhh poo poo...did we hurt your little feelings by expressing our dismay front & center over your shortcomings? Tough s**t, get your act together and be a real Las Vegas restaurant; otherwise go back to the Midwest and boil some potatoes out back. Sorry to be so rude, but your actions upon us as hungry customers; not even being able to order any food due to STUPID BUSINESS PRACTICES gets you one of these good ol' sour yelp reviews. TIP 1: Don't give people menu's with dinner's available when no dinner's are available. TIP 2: Make some REAL menus! TIP 3: Treat every customer as if they were the future of your businesses success, because THEY ARE! TIP 4: Don't ever let customers' leave your restaurant without being able to order food; as letting customers leave hungry & miffed will always cost you $$$ and future business.",rGjpP9NYkBiEHGB9oJJafw,0,0,1,G9T9mXykYYlYmBl0GqpDGg

4025879,2016-11-26,0,BjS35X3-_-9TP-RyfzoC_Q,Wanted to try some place new and this was on our way. Staff was super friendly and the food was good. Like going to your grandmas for a meal. My hubby got the smokehouse brisket hash and I got the chicken fried steak based on recommended yelp and our server. The food definitely has a homemade taste which is good. The only reason I can't give 5 stars is that they brought out my husbands plate and apparently another server grabbed my meal for her table. I had to wait at least another 20 minutes for my food. I insisted the hubby eat since his food was getting cold. It wasn't our servers fault and I actually felt bad for him since he was a little upset. They were apologetic but that was it. I didn't expect a comp but they didn't offer anything for the error. There is a 10% off when you check in so we took advantage of that. I would give them another go as the food wasn't bad. The chicken fried steak tasted homemade and not the generic frozen patty. The only thing we weren't crazy about was their home fries which tasted like boiled potatoes put on the grill for a few minutes. I think I would get hash browns. They just weren't crispy enough for my taste. Not bad at all!,ucBB3Q9CmNL2CuqTUl74ng,0,0,4,jq8W3klBFK5RmxB2FXjYsw

Once with my husband, and we had a pretty good experience. The food was good, and the portions were big. The second time with my son. Mom-son bonding time. The second time did not go as well. With the breakfast, you get potatoes. If you wish to switch to hash browns, they indicate on the menu that it will be a 15 minute wait, as they are never frozen. I love hash browns, and just had to have them. My son and I both chose them, and so we waited. And we waited. 

We had our coffee and water arrive, and then it was not refilled until breakfast was almost over. That is so frustrating. And the water had a weird taste. I could not even drink mine. We waited more than the 15 minutes for our hash browns, but it was okay since we were catching up. When our plates arrived, I was really bummed to find that they had not given me my hash browns. The server apologized and said that he would get them going right away. I decided that I would not be a bother, and took the potatoes instead. 

The food was good, and we both enjoyed our meals. That was the last we saw of our server for a long time. We could not catch his attention after we finished, as he appeared to be the only one working the front of the restaurant. It had gotten busy after we arrived.

So after 10 minutes waiting there we left and another big family behind us left also. I guess the owner is making a ton of money because they didn't care.

4451834,2015-09-08,3,BjS35X3-_-9TP-RyfzoC_Q,"On a lazy Labor Day morning my husband and I woke up and decided we needed breakfast. I searched Yelp for a place with a decent review, and I also wanted it to not be too far from our house because we wanted to get back to loafing around fairly quickly -- such time is important on a 3-day weekend. 

American Eats had a decent review and as I read through some of the reviews I figured it would be a good shot, and hopefully not super packed. 

When we arrived there were a few other patrons, but we were seated quickly. I requested a de-caf coffee, my husband had chocolate milk. These were brought out promptly and our order was taken.

Unfortunately this is where things got a little ""off"". We waited, and waited. Then the server came back by and confirmed our orders again. After that I heard yelling from their open kitchen, requesting our orders quickly. I suppose the server had forgotten to put them in. Le sigh. 

I could dismiss the mistake, and I do -- it happens. But when the food arrived I wasn't WOW'd out of my mind. My Denver omelette was just OK - choppy, diced ham, kind of bland, and tiny chopped up peppers/onions. There was also a lack of cheddar cheese which made the omelette dry and somewhat unpalatable. When eggs are super dry, especially in an omelette it's a huge downer for me, someone who really enjoys a soft, exquisite egg dish. Eggs are meant to be gently cooked, not blazed to death, whatever form you are eating them in. The home-style potatoes were quite good, but the toast was like eating cardboard and barely buttered.

My husband received his French toast, and he got a sizable portion (a plus indeed!), and he said they were good. However, he did not receive his over-easy eggs he requested at the beginning -- I think because when our order was confirmed the second time, the eggs didn't get added. Luckily though they did not end up on our final receipt, which I appreciated. I think we would have requested them, but by that point we had already been at the restaurant for longer than we had expected to be.

All in all, I really did want to enjoy this place, but I don't think the food is as great as it could be. Honestly, the service mistake is something that I can dismiss as a once ""oops"" - but the food being mediocre is what will steer me away to the many other breakfast places in the valley.",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,4,2,2,ExkFgaPvD1siVIC9PMpJ0g

Facility:  What a cute diner. The inside has counter seats, tables and chairs in the middle, and booths along the Windows. It was very clean and had such cute decor.

My Grandpa even mentioned how he was glad he wasn't on dusting duty here with all the knick knacks. 

Service:  The service was really good here. Super friendly and attentive. My Grandpa likes to give the wait staff in any restaurant a hard time, teasing of course, and JR hung right in there. Super nice guy!

Food:  The food was pretty decent. 
I ordered the chicken fried steak breakfast. It was good, but not the best I ever had. Being from the South, I am a connoisseur of chicken fried steak, so I'm just a tad finicky.

The service is awful and food is not very good from what we had. The server is nice and funny, but never ever checks on his tables. We saw him once and there was only 3 other people here. Our drinks never got refilled. The server is actually still talking to the table in front of us about his truck and where he lives. He is not attentive at all. The girl server came to refill my soda and when she came back she accidently spilled it all on me and the person in the next booth. She said sorry and asked if he would like a towel. She also can not remember what shes doing. We asked for ranch and she came back to our table asking if what we wanted again. We still have been sitting at this table for 15 mins or more waiting for a check or even a drink refill. This is some of the worst service i have ever had and the food is less than the equivalent of a dennys. Nothing special here to eat. And still after writing all this our server still hasn't come back.  I will never come back here and can't wait until this place goes out of business and this location gets another shot at a new restaurant. Final note. The only person in here that gave good service was the busser",nnXljc4ENgJblSXgovNTiA,1,0,1,AASJuwW4cDy4i1WX5bvdIg

I felt really horrible coming in late (30 mins before closing... yes, we were those people *sad face emoji*), but I was craving chicken fried chicken sooo bad. I actually have never been here before but one of my coworkers brought me back her leftovers one time & I couldn't stop craving it since then. 

We were seated right away & it was quite busy when we came in. I ordered the chicken fried chicken dinner with the cream of mushroom. OH MY GOODNESSSSS!!! I love cream of mushroom. The server told me that their cream of mushroom is homemade & it was seriously the best I've ever had. I will keep coming back here just for that lol. The dinner plate comes with the chicken, mashed potatoes, vegetables, and a choice of soup or salad. Let me tell you, the whole thing is MASSIVE. I was so hungry that I finished all of the chicken lol. What I like about their chicken is that it wasn't heavily battered. For something fried, it wasn't too heavy. I wish the mashed potatoes were hotter though lol. It came out kinda cold. The dinner roll was okay, a little burnt on the bottom. The vegetables were okay, you know just the usual steamed veggies. 

What really compels me to give this place 5 stars (besides their beautiful chicken fried chicken) is the service. Even though we came in so late, the staff was still so helpful and came and checked up on us frequently. I will definitely keep coming back here!",WPcEBAbrPZxvCGlvH9XLsQ,5,2,5,3XPM-5X3lwlYysBDg83QdQ

So I drove by to see where it was going to be.. Wow much bigger location, so now i was ready for them to reopen.. So the time had come. I took my family to dinner there ( oh yeah they use to close at 3 only did breakfast and lunch ) Now they are open till 10 pm. I was very happy to see they did not raise the prices with the new location added some wonderful new items and are the same very friendly bunch of employees. They did an outstanding job inside with decorations and making it feel warm.. and the tables are spaced a nice distance apart but you do not feel alone.. they have booths and tables and can accommodate much larger groups.

1.  They get this off the bat for being the only restaurant in the last 15 years to actually have people eat in the restaurant. I drive by this place every day to work and never have seen any cars there, breakfast, lunch or dinner!

2  The service - Owned by a local couple who moved their restaurant from old Henderson, I was wondering how this place would do since it is so far away from their client base .  The service is great, the owners and their staff are very consistent and friendly.  This is a local place, family owned and they make you feel pretty darn comfortable.

3.  The food - 

Everything here is great!  I have had:

Cobb Salad... this is full of stuff!
Garden Salad  ok, no garden salad is that good...
Pot Roast....yum the wife says this is the best ever in the city.
Meatloaf... very likeable.
Chili ....just the right amount of spice.
Omelettes... I have had a variety of them, skillets, to the basics. I order them with egg whites and they are just right for me.

They have fish, hamburgers, salads, southwestern / mexican flavored foods and so far, so good. I have been here about 8 times now and enjoy it quite a bit.

On the second visit there were four of us and a child. We were the only ones waiting to be seated and it took around 10 min. The hostess told us they had a booth and we just needed to wait for it to be cleaned and it would take 2 minutes.

The entire wait staff was super friendly and made sure our drinks were never empty.  Our food came out pretty fast too and was simply delicious.   You get a lot of good food at a decent price.,Yy0CAv2eIy-X1BDbtzXykQ,0,0,5,BrjpkTNSczgFYlQQj_5-gA

Had to wait 10 minutes to be seated and another 10 minutes before a waitress took the order.  Later found they got robbed the day before, sorry but that is not a good enough reason to not give good service.  Maybe next time it will be better!",u9VT-aGvXdt0g1vRLDaQ-w,0,0,3,2cB6lZZOKwylluv3ycNeAA

5764270,2017-11-23,0,BjS35X3-_-9TP-RyfzoC_Q,This was a very nice diner. Cute Americana atmosphere. Came with my husband and in laws. It's the day before thanksgiving and they're heading to Mexico and wanted thanksgiving dinner. Both ordered the turkey dinner and it was great. My husband ordered breakfast chicken fried steak and eggs and loved it. I had the cheeseburger and fries. All of them were great. Food came out in a timely manner and was tasty. Staff was friendly and attentive. The check in offer was cool too 10% off. Would recommend.,KXkl7tyD1G0uv5v9ddNYmQ,0,0,4,E58DmqcYTu5YsYEb3fC_cQ

I rolled in here and was quickly seated at the counter (only person there). This place is fairly large and it sounded like they had a larger party in the back that I couldn't see, so I will give them the benefit of the doubt on the slower service. 

This isn't gourmet or fancy food. Just good old fashioned regular food at decent prices. I actually liked the fact I could get French Toast and Bacon for $5 off the Kids/Those who don't eat much menu. The plates I saw come out were full of food, more than I needed. 

French Toast wasn't on fancy bread, just regular, and the bacon was tasty. It was good and served with plenty of butter and syrup. Exactly what I was looking for. Iced tea was that type that lacked flavor so maybe skip ordering that. 

Nice decorations with lots of friendly signs saying things like ""Love Laugh LIve"" and similar sayings. Two TV's to watch the football games overhang the dining area. The cook was a nice lady who gave me a smile and told me she'd get my food out quick and she did. Bonus points there. 

I'll be back because its clean, convenient, and fair priced. Will have to try the chicken fried steak next time.",wXZS42D0L8hoCiSh2Krc_A,2,1,3,B3Fd-sUCXOgEGNueT7kfHg

5894873,2016-10-08,0,BjS35X3-_-9TP-RyfzoC_Q,"Horrible horrible service. When we walked in, servers walked past the front host stand without even a simple hello, it wasn't until the manager or owner came by, that we were greeted. Once we got sat and the waitress took our order, not only was the order completely messed up when it came out, but she also forgot to put it in, because tables that came in after us were completely finished with their meal before food even hit our table. I asked her if she forgot and she got defensive saying that she hadn't. When the food came out, it came out one plate at a time so we all ate at different times. The manager / owner said she would take care of it, after I let her know that we had somewhere to be and took a whopping ten dollars off of our bill. I am not one to complain, as I work in a restaurant as well, but when you forget to put in an order and your guests wait over an hour to have breakfast, you apologize and make it right... especially when an anxious toddler is involved. I will NEVER come back to this place again. Awful.",8x5N7FAd1-WosORYOtO5WQ,1,0,1,gXeTsCwrl1MEB555uAdMOg

5953067,2016-11-16,0,BjS35X3-_-9TP-RyfzoC_Q,"Wish I could've given this restaurant five stars, but I simply can't, even though the food is well above average for this type of restaurant.

What cost them three stars is the wait time. Waited at least twenty minutes, probably closer to thirty, for a simple biscuits and gravy meal. I was engrossed reading news on my phone so lost track of time though had couple groups get up and leave while I sat here reading.

The thing that irks me the most is the restaurant wasn't overly busy as I came in after the lunch rush, which is typically one of the fastest times to get served. I can deal with delays when they're busy but it seemed as If this was negligence to some degree.

Once the waiter realized what went wrong had meal in a few minutes.

The food was pretty good, though it did suffer a little in taste due to my attitude after the wait.  Everything appears homemade from the potatoes to the biscuits and gravy. The biscuits were exceptionally tasty.

But the wait....

The flavor of the food is truly amazing and unexpectedly great. If it wasn't for initial service would happily give restaurant five stars, or more!",_IcrRgXW1gtVNruseNHAJQ,4,0,2,1G2MfAMSSgXQg5v3OsrLSA
