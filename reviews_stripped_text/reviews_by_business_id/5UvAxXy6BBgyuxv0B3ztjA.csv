223390,2013-01-04,0,5UvAxXy6BBgyuxv0B3ztjA,"If you are looking for a good duck noodle soup then look no further, noodle bar in the LVH nails this soup right on the noggin.   I was so impressed, which was refreshing after being horrified by the sushi bar in the LVH that was dreadful. 

The lemon pepper chicken was also very well seasoned as you can taste all the hot peppery delight in the dish.  However, there is a reason they do not place the mongolian beef on the menu and that is because it is done all wrong.  It is sweet and nothing to do with the sensational onion taste that usually accompanies a well-made mongolian beef dish.  

However, if you are in the mood for a good house chow fun and noodle soup then this is the place to be.  The service was also superb as we were served with our drinks and food almost as promptly as we could get the order out.  I recommend going to noodle bar but I do not reccommend ever eating the mongolian beef.",UuNlh98_fV4zZlQgy1wDTw,1,1,4,dsOWfNA7Gz99Jm_PAYtZrg

Once seated, we waited more than 10 minutes for water and then had to ask for the drink menu. After finally ordering, the drinks/food did come quickly. I ordered the pad Thai, which was so bad I couldn't eat more than two bites...and it is extremely rare for me to turn away food! My boyfriend tried it as well and wouldn't even go back for a second bite...he compared the noodles and sauce to spaghetti o's...!!  His house chow main was good, but cold. I would have ordered something else to replace my pad Thai, but the server never came back to check on us. Eventually we had to ask for the check, though the server did offer to remove the pad Thai charge before we needed to ask. Once the check came, it had an extra appetizer charge, which then took a long time to get someone's attention to remove it. And once the check was finally corrected, the manager than hovered next to until signed (with her hand on the back of one of the chairs at our table!)!

3293510,2008-08-15,0,5UvAxXy6BBgyuxv0B3ztjA,"Overpriced and hardly authentic, 888 Noodle Bar is a ghastly crap hole of a restaurant in the overly touristy Benihana village of the Las Vegas Hilton.  There are too many things wrong with this place but it all starts with the service.  Shocking for a place so small that they take ""reservations"" and may give customers a hard time about wanting to sit down.  

While some Asians may frequent this place, its only because the property is too far off the strip for them to go anywhere more decent.  I was convinced to ask a ""regular"" who says he only ate there because he hated all of the other restaurants and the casino comps his meals here.  He says its hard to mess up a $10 bowl of Pho, which I think they still managed to screw up.

The nearly $20 Seafood Udon noodles I had were so bland I had to ask them to change it out twice before giving up on it entirely.  $8 for a side of Gyoza (6 pieces)?  Forget about it.
