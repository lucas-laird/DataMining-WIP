357778,2013-09-02,0,m6TRzUX-QizEkvNRpub3lA,"This review is for the Wendy's inside MCCarran Airport in Las Vegas. For some strange reason, this Wendy's location was freaking amazing when we were there. I'm pretty certain it's the best Wendy's I've ever had. I had a Pretzel Bacon Burger, and my wife had some sort of breakfast flatbread sandwich. Everything tasted remarkably fresh, and the bacon was perfectly crispy. This was a very surprising experience.   Honestly, the food quality was more like a sit-down restaurant than a fast food joint.

Generally, I do like Wendy's well enough. But this was far beyond other experiences I've had with the chain, so much so that I felt compelled to give them an Internet thumbs-up. I don't know if this location is always this good, but wow...unexpectedly exceptional, especially for an airport restaurant.

I did notice there are a few reviews on this airport Wendy's from 2011 that are fairly poor.  I wonder if management is different there now?  I'm not sure what's changed, but the place was pure greatness when we were there (August 2013).",YJFvUjG5uYqM6kz-ZW0_pA,0,1,5,o2x-5IYZI0o6G7qbBxtmjw

1336537,2015-08-24,1,m6TRzUX-QizEkvNRpub3lA,"I was happy that a Wendy's was at the airport and therefore I could eat some decent food, but my happiness was short-lived.

The prices here are astonishingly high. Now, I understand that airport food is always more expensive than not, but $5.69 for a cheeseburger seems slightly excessive for what you're getting. The best deal was the 5 piece crispy chicken nuggets at $2.49 each--nothing else was remotely worth noting from an inexpensive standpoint.

My low review--given my happiness with most fast food locations--stems from many factors. 

Firstly, service. The service was fast, I guess as it should, but lacking any sort of human emotion...I guess as is normal for most airport places. I also did not receive any indication that grated cheese on my chili would be 30 cents extra, which would have been nice to warn me of (most Wendy's don't charge!). 

Secondly, the food. The food was decent, but the standards just didn't seem as high as normal Wendy's locations. The burger was hastily put together and was a complete mess of mayo and ketchup with some pickles slopped in. 

Third, accuracy. I clearly ordered--and I repeated and the cashier repeated--3 orders of the aforementioned nuggets, but ultimately I only received two (as was indicated on the receipt). That was a major bummer (when you don't get enough nuggets, your day is ruined). Plus, I also ordered the hamburger without cheese and without mayo, and lo and behold it came with not only mayo and cheese BUT ALSO bacon. It seems like they just completely mixed up sandwiches or something, and I feel kind of bad for the person expecting a bacon cheeseburger and instead getting a regular hamburger.

In the end, I could not believe that I was walking away from a Wendy's with a less-than-great experience. Wendy's is my go-to, and sadly, this one failed. In this case, what happens in Vegas DOESN'T stay in Vegas. The world must know that this Wendy's is lame.",vzxAYKVVpo_Ft4DWxa_TdA,1,1,2,tNVTbnZIRvH2_6spWRyukw

4595273,2015-05-16,76,m6TRzUX-QizEkvNRpub3lA,"Got to have my frosteeeee Frosty, this one a half and half:  chocolate and vanilla.  Not so much a swirl, but a mix, in the tall cup.

The famous Frosty dessert, trade-marked and found exclusively at Wendy's, is a welcome sweet comforting treat, when trapped in this terminal of McCarran, waiting what seems like eternity for your extremely late flight.

Then again, had it not been for the delay, I might not have wandered around and spotted the freckled red-headed burger girl sign.

Anyway, the Frosty could very well be the only edible thing in an airport that isn't outrageously priced.  At just a few bucks, who can complain?

Had I bought one of the square burgers, which I have not eaten in decades, this rating might be different, so that is the disclaimer on this review.  But the frozen-ish creamy confection was perfect.

If you happen to be stuck in Terminal C, you can fetch your own Frosty near Gates 24 and 23.
