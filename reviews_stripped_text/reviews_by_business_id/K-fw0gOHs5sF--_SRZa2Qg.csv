305968,2013-09-30,0,K-fw0gOHs5sF--_SRZa2Qg,"I've always liked Port of Subs but I think this experience is worth sharing.

Their posted hours for Sundays are from 9am to 9pm.  So I walk in at about 7pm on a Sunday; the lights were on, ""open"" sign blazing, and the guy behind the counter asked me ""What can I get for you?""  So, the idiot that I am, I assumed they were open for business.

Evidently not.  I wasn't eyeballing the counter too hard so I didn't notice that they had put the bread and such away until he very laboriously dragged it back out.  He sighed and scowled at me the entire time, and was sarcastic and rude whenever he spoke.  He made it extremely clear that he wanted me out of his shop and wished that I hadn't come in.  It was also made clear to me that they had to re-open the register for my order.

I've worked in a shop before, and I really did feel guilty.  I know what it's like to have people come in just before closing, but I've never treated a customer that badly just for some last minute business.  But the kicker is that it was 2 hours before posted closing time, and they hadn't bothered to turn off the sign OR lock the door, even though they had apparently shut down the register.  I'm not a mind reader; I don't know you're closing 2 hours early unless I'm told.  He could have easily said ""sorry, we've just closed"" and I would have said ""oh sorry dude"" and walked out, no problem.  Though I was getting sandwiches for my parents, I'm sure they could have lived with something else.  With the same ingredients, I can make better ones at home.  I'm glad I wasn't getting anything for myself, because after the way this man treated me I doubt I would have wanted to eat it.

I don't know why they happened to be closing early, and I don't care.  I just wish the older gent that ""served"" me had been honest and said they'd closed instead of using his precious five minutes to treat me like a rat turd in his lentil soup.

Needless to say, I've been put off and I doubt I'll go back.",pzgmn4aIXwlfHzhUqx9CDg,0,0,2,OsEeRQae7cOvyGbFZsyC0g

460086,2013-05-13,0,K-fw0gOHs5sF--_SRZa2Qg,"Let me preface this review by saying that if you love/like Port of Subs, by all means, continue! I am merely one person with my own opinion and you don't have to pay a wit of attention to this! .... 
Having said that, I blame myself for the lousy, ok, wretched sub I just had.  
1.I  forgot, 2. was lazy and 3. had forgiven P.O.S. for their past sins.... I forgot that the last time I was at P.O.S. about 2 years ago, I hated their subs, I hated the sloppiness of them and the pitiful condiment/veggie selection.  I was lazy, there is a P.O. S. right by my house, so convenience was paramount today, I had been working around the house all day and when I realized the time, I was too lazy to drive to Subway/Jersey Mikes/Jason's Deli, hell even the gas station would have been better.  And going back to my #1 issue, I forgot how much I disliked P.O.S. that I forgave them, I thought maybe I had got a sub when one of the workers was having a bad day or maybe my tastebuds were having the bad day. So when I went there today all three of those issues came into play for me. 
I gave this review one star because I will say this, the staff was very nice, very pleasant, and that goes a long way with me, I have boycotted other food joints for the service, I mean the food may have been great, but bad service will kill if for me, my money spends everywhere, and trust me, in Vegas, I can find hundreds of places I can eat at. 
So to end my rant, which is what I feel like I have been doing, I dislike P.O.S., I dislike your sloppy, tasteless, pathetic attempt at being a reputable sub shop.  I will make a concerted effort to remember this, so in 2 years from now I won't find myself at P.O. S. again and kicking myself for not remembering that I could have got a better sub at the Albertson's pre-made sandwich section.",ZfjLTP-nb5F_M887vhJKyw,2,0,1,mPTkkxuj5RxEFp6Ep0PqhQ

Not can I help you what can I get for you she said what do you want I was a little shocked I have my order as did my husband she slammed down the cheese and made it clear she wasn't happy and that we were all a bother my husband asked to add bacon she threw a clump of bacon in the microwave not a few pieces like usual it was a huge clump like 7 pieces thank you for the extra but he didn't want a bacon sandwich lol she just didn't care and wanted us out , the next guy that puts the toppings on the sandwich was also rushing us as well as wiping his nose on his sleeve !

Not every location takes them and I refuse to pay regular price for a sandwich at port of subs. The $5 large coupons are the best but the BOGO coupons are great too. I had a old school stamp card from 2005 that I found in my desk and this location still took it even though they haven't used that rewards program in a while. I had my whole card stamped in so I just needed my free sub! I didn't expect him to take it but thought it was worth a try so it ended up working out and I gave him a tip.  

The sandwich I ordered and always order is the #1 and that has ham, salami, capicolla, pepperoni & provolone cheese on my choice of white bread. of course I have to add my toppings like mustard, mayo, onion yadda yadda. I like how they slice the meat fresh in front of you. They just don't put enough meat on it. The sandwiches here are good or I wouldn't eat them but like I mentioned before, to pay full price with out a coupon when you could get more bang for your buck at Jersey Mike's is crazy. keep your eye out for coupons or have family save them for you like I do!",eytpwJXgg5nWU6jrlQ6qAA,4,5,3,oXDgcJTabaIb_tOUa6htBQ

Tomatoes were soggy, if you have bad tomatoes why even put them out? The guy that was slicing meat was extremely helpful and joyful. He tried to help the guy next to him that was taking long to put toppings on an order of subs so he tried to help by topping my order of Subs but he was yelled at by the manager. The manager was extremely disgruntled, not sure why. Maybe it's because she works at a sandwich shop. Even tho I didn't like my sub my boyfriend loved his. Over priced, rude manager, gross tomatoes.

I'm a huge Port of Subs fan, since it's the closest thing to my beloved SoCal Submarina. The fresh-sliced meat, the mustard/mayo combo, the excellent sandwiches, the wonderful fact that you can make any sandwich into a salad.

Now for the gripe: I'm all for friendly employees who greet their regulars by name. This place has that in spades...but too many spades! No customer should have to wait longer for their food because an employee is having a long, personal conversation with a customer. My poor lettuce sat, waiting for it's toppings, other orders piling up behind it, for far too long, waiting for this little chat to be over.

Many choices of Griller, Steak, Italian, Chicken, Meatball etc etc. I take the chicken with pepper jack. They heat the chicken in the microwave then put it into the bread with the cheese and press it in the hot grill thing. Then they remove and pull it apart for your veggies, can they not put the veggies in first? I dunno.

Good sandwich, I used to come here a lot and they still put a huge pile of shredded lettuce in the sandwiches when asked. That's ok but if you are not eating in, the lettuce spills out of the sandwich and in your lap/car/keyboard/tv remote/whatever is beneath your mouth.

It's a busy store, the guys that run it have been there a few years which is a good thing and everyone was looking happy as they dug themselves out of the shredded lettuce and finished their lunches. 

Good option for lunch in North Summerlin.",hRzmJCPmV1_ggM5jSxq2bA,1,1,4,EAIp0mTVpypVEeBL7du6Vw
