55896,2014-01-16,0,Ms_el67lrNsKBmdEXVxl6Q,"Even though my husband and I are Chinese, he is not a fan of Chinese food because he eat Chinese food all his entire life. One day he told me that he found this American Chinese restaurant was pretty good, I was surprised to hear that and thinking I must try this place!  The first time I tried it and this restaurant just blowed my mind away :D.

First of all, everything in the restaurant was super clean and well-organized the fact that they only open for six months.  The service was great; server was very friendly and the wait for the food wasn't long at all.  

We went for lunch special and it was the best lunch special that I have so far.  Honestly, I never found one American Chinese restaurant (not even china a go go) would cook their ""lunch special"" fried rice right after you ordered and they did it for all customers in this restaurant when you pay only $5.75!  I was wondering how could they turnover fast enough during lunch time? I talked to the owner, Mr. Liu, he simply said he wanted to keep good quality food, fresh taste so this is how he did it.  Everything I tried it was excellent, no complain at all.  Even though a small item like crab puff, it was so tasty; Mr. Liu was creative to put some veggie in it and made it even better! 

The presentation of the food is good and neat.  You can see how Mr. Liu has put a lot of effort and hard work into this restaurant and I truly applauded his dedication; someone who cares about the quality the food, looks into details and wants you to have a great dining experience overall.  

He also has a great business partner who manage the front.  Even though they work seven days a week, they still talk to you with smiles on their faces and patiently explain how they prepare their dishes and operate their business.  You can see their passion for their business; it truly shows that this is America, u can reach your dream when you work hard enough.  

I hope that this restaurant would never closed down, serviously.",PtU909CdR4BFbMp9Dj0zEg,2,1,5,1YBkfiTROCSeTPlDzMxNDg

We were surprised with the wonderful service provided by the man and woman inside. They were very kind and helpful - it almost felt like we were at their house for dinner! 

Food was good - above average for a small Asian restaurant! We tried the potstickers, General Tso's chicken, and Spicy Honey chicken. All great choices! They offer Coca-Cola in the glass bottles too, major points for that! Overall great dinner choice that will find its way into our rotation!",aWtij20vVUm0uglJViiCxQ,1,0,5,kI253YwM-44aIXq2m3W7uw

All the dishes I have tried so far were just delicious. Especially the fried rice, they made it when you order so it always taste and smell fresh.

So my wife and I decided to try this place for dinner, and we ordered the family dinner A for 2 people. It includes 2 daily soup (choose Hot & Sour or Egg Drop), 2 Egg Rolls, 2 Crab Rangoon, 2 Pork Fried Rice, 2 entrees. For the entrees we ordered the spicy honey chicken and Chinese sausage with snow peas. They spicy honey chicken was great and the snow peas was fresh and tasty.

People like to talk about portion, but taste to me comes first. With Liu's kitchen, both taste, portion and price are better than many Chinese restaurants in the china town area.",VVe3YG5lvgeOhB3WT34X5g,1,0,5,4L8VdN79NNe9AUcE0q_Iqw
433566,2013-09-20,0,Ms_el67lrNsKBmdEXVxl6Q,"I was ecstatic when I found out about this place because it's so close to my house. Seeing all the good reviews, I decided to eat here. Today was my second visit here and probably my last. 

First time I came here, I was greeted with a warm welcome and the customer service was great. However, this time, I think it was the owners son? that was working here and I got greeted with no welcome or acknowledgment. He was busy talking with some lady and didn't even notice me until I have been just standing there for 5 minutes. He was quick to apologize to the lady for pausing the conversation so he can help me, but I got no apologies for me waiting there for 5 minutes. 0 star for customer service. 

Now for the food, I got the lunch special for Salt and Pepper Chicken and Mongolian Beef. The Salt and Pepper Chicken was really inconsistent. The bigger piece of the chicken was perfectly crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. However, all the small pieces was burnt and inedible. The Mongolian Beef was basically inedible because the beef was way too tough. I thought Mongolian Beef was supposed to be soft, but they seem to deep fry the beef first (think Beijing beef from Panda Express) and then stir-fried with vegetables to make Mongolian Beef. Yuck. 0 star for the food.
They also got my order wrong and gave me an Egg Drop Soup instead of Hot n Sour soup. 

The horrible service and bad food really stops me from giving this place more than a 1 star. This place has definitely gone downhill ever since it opened. Stay away from this place until they get their stuff back together.",oNqnBJX9Tj4Jq7RtoVC3hQ,1,0,1,ahrfLNuml2FE9SPcK-05qQ

The quality of food is off the chart. My favorite items so far are Walnut Shrimp, BBQ Pork Chow Mein, Orange Chicken and a huge bowl of Egg Drop Soup. 

Staff is super friendly and always accommodating. Liu did a great job hiring the current staff, I hope he takes care of them because they really do top off a great experience.

INSIDER TIP: They also make an awesome HOT OIL that is out of this world! Not to be confused with the CHILI PASTE that all Chinese restaurants have. This is also different then the normal chili pepper flakes in vegetable oil that other places also have. It has so MUCH FLAVOR!!! 

But beware the oil is ridiculously hot. If you like fire and flavor then just put a few drops on anything and you will fall in love. If you want the flavor without the burn try to get the the contents of the jar with as little oil as possible. I say ""contents"" because I have no idea what is in it, but it tastes like heaven in a little glass container. It's homemade and not store bought.

I popped in here with my family the night before the opening. The owners were having a massive family dinner, but they still sat us with big smiles and enthusiasm.

This is your typical local Chinese joint. Lots of familiar items, along with some Chef specials that I haven't seen anywhere else in town. 

My favorite dish from this part of the menu was the Spicy Honey Chicken. Different than Orange Chicken, because this had a more robust, and balanced flavor. It didnt taste like crispy chicken tossed in syrup. Vegetables accompanied this dish.

The Hot n Sour soup is delicious, flavorful.

Now for the item that set this place apart: home made chili paste/sauce. This is the stuff dream are made of. Spicy, delicious and is like heaven.

This spot is brand new, family owned and worth the trip even if you don't live on this side of town.

I was looking forward to have a decent American Chinese restaurant in the neighborhood.  The food when they first opened was top notch.

1982095,2013-09-24,0,Ms_el67lrNsKBmdEXVxl6Q,"Been here twice now. First, we dined in. Second, we had it to go because I was too cheap to pay for a tip.

We had the Family Dinner the first time, which has pork fried rice, crab rangoon, egg roll, soup (egg drop), and two entrees (Mu Shu Beef and Honey Walnut Shrimp). The Walnut Shrimp was just okay; I wouldn't order it again. The Mu Shu Beef was good. The egg roll is chewy. The Crab Rangoon was good. The Egg Drop Soup was good. We also had Sausage Fried Rice to go. My boyfriend liked their sausage fried rice. 

Today we went there and had the following for take-out: Fish Fillet with Black Bean Sauce, Mongolian Beef, and two Sausage Fried Rice. We liked both the fish fillet and the mongolian beef. Although the black bean sauce was a bit too salty, I like getting the fish and veggies without the sauce anyway.

Service is good. The place is always empty, except for the family I saw who dined in today, and the lady who grabbed their to-go menu when we first went there.

Tip: I would grab their menu so you could just call in your order ahead of time for take out. But the wait wasn't too long. It was done in 10 minutes, like what they said the wait would be.

I would go there again, if I want some cheap Chinese food, and wouldn't want to drive all the way to Chinatown.",8P8dgzKDQg7OSlEiAUUqlQ,0,0,4,Uolv7S_jxNrj_PGQQmc5MA
2078728,2013-07-31,1,Ms_el67lrNsKBmdEXVxl6Q,"7/30: I saw that this new place received a few good reviews so I decided to give it a try. The service was excellent -- 5 stars! The refills kept coming and the food was prepared and brought out in a timely manner. The place is clean and the ambiance is standard yet relaxing. The staff is very well run and efficient. My waiter Titus was very friendly. He even asked how the food was, basically asking if I could give any constructive criticism. We also introduced ourselves and chatted for a bit. This is how new places should treat customers! 

Me and a friend ordered the Family Meal for 2 ($21.75), which included a choice of Hot and Sour Soup or Egg Drop Soup, Crab Rangoon, Egg Roll, Pork Fried Rice (very generous portion -- this could be a $10 entree at other places), and 2 entrees of your choice. We ordered Mongolian Beef and Chicken with Vegetables. Beverages are relatively cheap as well ($1.50).

I'd give the food 3.5 to 4 stars. The food was fresh and the presentation was vivid. It could be delicious depending on your taste -- it's not really authentic style though. I think the chefs could opt to make the food more so, but from a business standpoint I think they choose otherwise (their clientele appears to be mostly locals in the surrounding neighborhood). Overall there's nothing wrong with it! But I'd recommend places in the Chinatown area if you want authentic. I think their hot sauce is homemade. I'm not sure what's going on there -- it's definitely unique. But I'll just say normal Sriracha chili sauce would suffice. 

If you're in the area or live nearby, I highly recommend giving this place a go at least once. They did have 15% off for July to get customers in the door, though that ends today -- maybe one of you Yelpers will make it in time :) Nevertheless, the food has decent value (average $7.95 for a la carte and steamed rice). I didn't look, but I wouldn't doubt they have a good lunch special as well. OK, time for leftovers (plenty!).

2332563,2014-04-27,0,Ms_el67lrNsKBmdEXVxl6Q,"Talk about bang for your buck for lunch special! At first looking at the prices thinking too myself really that cheap. My first thought was like why do I even bother with places like Panda Express when you can get fresh made too order chinese food the same price?? It not as though limited in options on Liu's lunch special menu. I was blown away that at Liu's there is one full page that can choose from. A truly diverse menu too.  You would think or my experience most places see lunch specials limited. Not here they have it broken down too different proteins from chicken, beef, pork, or shrimp. Most of them are your traditional chinese options find at most other restaurants. Also not only does the options start and end with entree. They give you the option of either hour and sour soup or egg drop soup. Even your starch can be steam rice or fried rice. Some of the entrees not your typical ones that plan on checking out on my next visit. 

I ended up ordering the general tso chicken. I felt like it was okay. The chicken will admit was cooked on point. It was nice crispy on the outside and chicken cooked perfection on the inside nice steaming hot. The sauce that were for me did not work. I felt like the sauce was just bottle of sweet and spicy hot sauce get at any asian market shelf. If anything more sweet then anything. The egg roll that comes with all lunch specials was good. I really liked the most was the pot stickers. Talk about HUGE. I got them thinking use too pot stickers being certain size most part eat in one biter or two. At Liu's the pot stickers take two too three bites. Still even oversized. It had nice sear on one side. The pork filling was not only cooked perfectly but had nice taste too it. The dipping sauce was the perfect compliment. You get six pieces per order. Surprise that able too eat everything good thing came too LIu as recovery meal from day of triathlon training. So when it comes too value up and down Liu's for lunch is hidden gem.

The service was excellent, friendly, and love the vibe of small family businesses. I might have order the wrong lunch special but so many more options too try. Just cause had ok lunch I know Liu's has more too offer. The price not doubt plan on coming back trying more of the menu.

They have a $5.75-$6.75 lunch special on selected dishes, about 40 different ones using chicken, pork, beef, or shrimp, which included steamed or fried rice or chow mein, an egg roll, and a soup.  It is a solid deal, I always complain about not having enough $5 meals around Vegas, it's always about $10+.  I wasn't feeling well and instantly thought of egg drop soup with something crispy and spicy.  So I went with the General Tso's Chicken w/ egg roll, steam rice, and egg drop soup http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lius-kitchen-las-vegas?select=JeWE4l25T4G1aEDj6PAQQg#Yjq_E0xGqUs_mAjolJEumA I asked if they could make the chicken extra crispy and they did. It was crispy and spicy to my liking, filled with lots of chili peppers. The sauce on it wasn't too sweet which I also liked. The egg roll was crispy. The egg drop soup made me feel  a lot better cause I wasn't feeling well going in.

Clean, tasty menu, cheap, friendly, and a new business in the SW oh yea I'll be back definitely. They have a Spicy Honey Chicken dish which looks good, from the pics posted, and I do want to try more of their menu.

Now for the mixed review: I ordered beef w/vegetable and like a few other YELPers, I found the beef ""different"", a strange texture vs others and the chicken chow mien was a bit on the greasy side. Sad.

Upon entering i thought the inside would look like most Chinese take out places. But this one had actual sit down and order service. I was sat and the server kid brought me a menu.

I decided to order 3 things. I ordered the pot stickers, Mongolian beef, and the chicken chow mein.

Potstickers: These were probably the worst item i ordered. They were soggy, im used to the seared and burnt crispy bottom of a potsticker. They also had meat the size of the tip of my pinkie. The rest of it was just the wrap of the potsticker.

Mongolian Beef: Good dish. flavor was good. The meat was really tender. Only complaint is the meat were small. There was a lot of meat. It was just cut up too small.

Chicken Chow Mein: This dish was also a disappointment for me. The flavor of the dish was good but everything else wasn't. The noodles tasted too firm almost raw and the chicken was dry.

Overall the everything was just ""OK"". The service is good. Food came out fast but it just wasn't that amazing. I don't think i would go back that often. Maybe once every 2-3 months.",fKqMqB36iwQuskyXB1kOtw,1,0,2,J1j99aFOLXkmLIeLsfu1ug

At first we thought we found our new neighborhood Chinese Restaraunt (which I've been looking for a while now) and had no complaints.  Close to home, cheap prices, nice employees...then we ordered the 2nd time, this time we ordered chow mein, won ton soup and shui mai.  This time, the food seemed to be forgettable because when I came back again today I really didn't remember if I liked any of it or not last time.  I walked in again tonight to order take out and thought, what the hell, I'm craving soup and dim sum, so I placed an order of each.  When I got home and started eating, it all came back to me.  I didn't like the won ton soup last time since there was barely any meat in the won ton, it was more like floating pieces of won ton wrapper and guessing if that piece had any meat in it.  When I actually did find meat, it tasted a little off, I could be wrong but I was expecting pork won tons where these tasted like ground beef won tons.  Next I take a bite of the pork/shrimp Shui Mai and had to quickly spit it out...sad to say, I don't think they were cooked all the way, I ripped open all the dumplings and every single one of them seemed to be a little undercooked.

Everything was delicious...except slightly salty. I love these type of Chinese restaurants with lunch specials. You get way more food then Panda Express and it tastes 10x better. The only thing I didn't enjoy was the Thai Tea which was cloyingly sweet.",33O3WZ_odvT2GdwTKMXROg,2,1,5,v-d3p5nz_CGWmTHh-hs7dA

The egg drop soup was unrecognizable as such. More like a brown slimy egg containing broth. The Szechuan  beef was also slimy and not very flavorful. There were 6 people in my party and no one enjoyed the food.

I will say that the waitress was polite and accommodating.",KV8YcH0JBaynbC1M-RM4PQ,0,0,2,eDnqN-xLdOWFTyEA3cOS8g

The Chow Fun was done extremely well. The ratio of vegetables, noodles and meat was perfect IMHO. The veggies had a nice sear on them and still had a nice crunch to them.

A big surprise was the Beijing Pork Chops. If I had to describe it I would ask you to imagine a mellow sweet and sour pork but spicy and minus the batter. The level of spiciness in this dish was mild but still enough to satisfy my craving for heat.
 
I hear good things about the salt and pepper dishes and some of the other entrees so I'm going to have to come back...

So I came back before I posted my original review and will go ahead and tell you that the Salt and Pepper Pork is an excellent blend of salt spice and aromatics. I am a big fan of meat on the bone, it just imparts a certain element of flavor I just don't get when meat is cooked boneless.

Having already tried the Beef Chow Fun, we decided to try the Vegetable Chow Fun. It was equally as good if not better because of all the extra veggies. I am usually a more of a carnivore but I may end up ordering these again when we come back

My new favorite item is the BBQ Spare Rib. It's a four bone appetizer so I will be ordering two of them next visit. These ribs are done exceptionally well with a crispy slightly charred exterior and a juicy bite at the same time. No shortness on flavor here. They tasted like they marinated over night with a salty sweet Asian marinade and BBQ'd with care. They have run out of this item before so get it when you can.

This place is pumping out some excellent Chinese cuisine.",ssz4_Rj8p1CLgO2WWnIoTA,1,1,5,MSptt623wG9GpCVrHChY7g

The first time was awesome;  the second time was...so-so; the third time was disgusting.  

I was originally excited about this place since it's so close to my house but they've really slacked since opening.  My last take out from there was truly awful.  I ordered the chicken chow mein and the chicken tasted rotten...I couldn't finish it.

I will say the fried rice and noodles there were still good despite the rotten chicken but c'mon.  When you serve rotten chicken, I can't help wondering about the condition and storage practices of the rest of the food that maybe doesn't taste as bad...

I didn't bother giving them a second chance b/c my girlfriend had the exact same experience about a week after my last visit there...

Just avoid this one",qKmbjDjH7rI1QjGLzhCDtA,4,0,2,YO2OS5UDvqj4FznELE7XyA
4898368,2014-02-14,0,Ms_el67lrNsKBmdEXVxl6Q,"To say I'm disappointed would be an understatement.  After finding Liu's via Yelp I was excited to order from them.  We ordered takeout yesterday (a Thursday around 6:30pm). The pictures looked appetizing, they have a solid four stars, and the prices seemed reasonable.  We ordered the potstickers, crab rangoons, spicy honey chicken and BBQ pork with black bean sauce.  

When we got home and saw the food, at first we couldn't tell which entree was which.  They were both loaded with onions and peppers, I mean LOADED. Easily half of the entrees were filler vegetables.  I expect some in most dishes, but this was like they ran out of protein and had to make the container full.  The flavor of the dishes was generic, but if I hadn't seen a few jalapeños in my honey chicken I would have thought I had received the wrong order, not any honey flavor to me, just salty soy... Certainly not the flavor I was looking for.  The crab rangoons didn't even have a tablespoon of bland filling in each, they were actually indented on the bottom instead of the plump pockets I'm accustomed to.  

We will be trying another place for sure, and would not recommend this place",EMo6jQHr_VyMfwg_9BQosw,2,0,1,izIzsyT9QPgIYHHUmuy_Bg

Along with your lunch portion of any given item, you receive either eggdrop or hot and sour soup as well as a spring roll. Portions are extremely generous.

For a quick lunch on the the go, this is a great spot. I ordered the Szechuan chicken on my visit and although the food is not extraordinary, it is an absolutely solid option. My meal wasn't as spicy as I anticipated, but it was tasty and fresh, which I was impressed by. Given the long list of items on the lunch menu, I anticipate coming back to try more of their offerings.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,4,3,3,H-xrR512O4iyJky-pACHgA
