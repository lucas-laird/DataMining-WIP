875272,2011-12-02,0,IDex-hVAfYnVMNF8l0t_ag,"I still call this place Roberto's Taco Shop even though the cheap LED sign says otherwise.
     ""Don Tortacos"" is a very adequate and cheap alternative to high priced Mexican food;  knowing the area, there are quite a lot of them around. If I were to compare this place to other Roberto's Taco Shops, I would have to say that  this specific joint can't hold a candle to any of the franchises around the Las Vegas area.
     The quality of the food just isn't as great compared to sister franchises, and I really have no idea why. I could have sworn that restaurant chains were suppose to have the same recipe. One of my complaints is the very soggy refried beans they serve; the texture is unappealing and it's really more liquid than solid. I thought I was eating bean soup when I first tasted it. I also don't appreciate the lack of servings. If you're a Roberto's regular, you should know that the restaurant is very generous with their serving. This specific joint is not. I mean compared to other Mexican taco shops you still get a lot more, but it just doesn't live up to the Roberto's name.
     I don't want to sound like absolutely hate the food here, I actually like this place. I go here fairly frequently, given that I feel like eating Mexican food. There are a lot of things I like about this place. This specific taco shop's employees are really nice and helpful, and they're not dicks about hanging out 2 hours after you eat your food. This is also a great place for pre-drunk snacks, post-drunk snacks, and mid-drunk snacks. It's even next to a PT's Pub; get drunk then get fat. It's an amazing combination!

I suggest the Carnitas Fries, it's not on the menu but they'll make it for you. It's like an untouched potential.",pCsLCDFmk_XfpgzH6htWNw,1,0,3,voVonpL3HsuLS-vjyE_iCg

Oh, how I miss stumbling in to Roberto's at 3am for some of the best drunk food I've ever experienced. If you want light (as light as you can get at Roberto's), go for the taquitos with cheese and guacamole, and mix the red and green sauces at the condiment bar. My personal fav would have to be the made-to-order carne asada burrito with cheese and guacamole added also with the mixed red/green sauces. I miss it just thinking about it.

What I can offer, although it HAS been a while, is that the Tortas were always VERY good.

My ex-girlfriend turned me onto them, and I discovered how hard it is to find good tortas (Mexican sandwich - basically pita bread, asada, rice, onions...).

The tortas here are very good, even for a low rent food joint like Robertos. 

It's cheap eating at it's best.

Even though in Vegas you have a multitude of options, this is a place where you can get good mexican tortas, for quite cheap.

I ordered a carne asada burrito, which came out awesome. The meat was pretty juicy and the burrito definitely wasn't lacking any ingredients. I ate half and saved the rest for lunch.

I asked them to deep fry some green onions for me, which he did. They were great side dishes along with the pickled carrots, onions, and jalapenos. The red sauce was also good.

However, I only gave them 3 stars for three reasons. One, when I showed the cashier my 10% off card, he said he didn't know how to do it. I told him to just take 10% off my bill, but he just said the same thing. I just said whatever. I would have only saved 57 cents.

Two. There is no bathroom in the place! I mean, it is pretty small, but since there are seats and tables available for eat-in customers, I don't understand why there wouldn't be a bathroom. It's an essential in a Mexican restaurant.

And three: there were no plastic utensils at the condiment area. I'm not sure if I needed to ask for them, but in other locations they have them ready for you. I had to attack the entire burrito and stop halfway to save the rest for lunch. A knife would've been helpful in this case.

Maybe I should've stuck to what I already knew. To say I was disappointed would be putting it mildly. The adobada was burnt and full of fat. It would've been seemingly edible had there been any pieces of meat that weren't charred or full of fat. The beans tasted as though they were from the can.

They are open 24 hours, 7 days a week and is the spot to go to after a night of partying!  I love their breakfast burritos (with sausage) and their carne asada FRIES -- SO delicious!  ALSO, they have those spicy carrots -- I usually fill up a whole sandwich baggie full of them -- they are so GOOD.  They are the only taqueria that I know of that has huge sliced spears of these spicy carrots and not those wimpy canned bought carrots.  

Roberto's is one of the top reasons why I miss Las Vegas.  And PT's coming in a close second.",NnsKC3MtsnAD3Jf22cuIxw,1,0,5,hLYBFgDSylWiB84h6zJd5g

 Clean, very polite, would have gotten 5 stars but every now again the oi isn't quite hot enough, living a little stale taste in the fried items, which is pretty much what I live on.

5205075,2016-10-24,1,IDex-hVAfYnVMNF8l0t_ag,The food is decent. But the cashiers are always SO RUDE!! Also if you pay for extra meat in your burrito (3.50 additional) theyll just put the regular amt of meat. The soda machine drinks taste like the staff here never clean out the fountain. I also dont understand why you have to pay for a refill on a horchata if pepes tacos has the horchata machine out for self-serve. I honestly only come here for the carne asada fries and the cashiers refuse to split them for me and my son. He is allergic to guacamole and it would be more convenient for me if they would just split them for me rather than me getting the guac on the side.,Wi2Fz1qaXVuYU9IV7R3Qig,0,0,1,fDrJbM9QzYZkPISD9jGz_Q

They had a special for Tacos de Lengua.  I personally have never had Lengua, but I figured other people eat it must be okay.  I just had to get over the fact that it is tongue.

Anyways - the tongue tacos were muy bueno.  I am now a fan of tacos de lengua.  

This place is pretty much a Roberto's - maybe a little cheaper.  Over all - the place was not the cleanest place.  It was a little suspect even.

It's fast and it's cheap.  the food was decent.  I would say - stop by in a pinch, but I wouldn't go out of the way to eat here.",L15JCA18Ib_vMUVJILxiSw,0,0,3,Pl5G48HQgNOoId9rGWbE9Q

I get beans cheese rice avo sour cream and French fries. Why do good things have to change ?? The original burrito I get is $2 and some change why did they start my burrito off at $5.75? Don Tortaco is going to lose some very loyal customers. While I was there an old lady said she had been coming there for 8 years and was mad that she had to wait 15 minutes befor being told they ran out of her order.

Today while at work a few coworkers and I were wanting to pick up some grub for lunch so a friend suggested Don Tortacos. The best idea of the day was calling in an order which was promptly prepared for us. The services is great and their food looks and taste impressive. The items ordered were carne asada fries, hard shell carnitas tacos and a carne asada burrito.

My burrito was Amazeballs, I swear it must have had at least two pounds of carne asada meat stuffed in it. I like my meat, I can handle my meat however this seemed a bit of a challenge for the first time in my life. 

This burrito was so good it made me horny. I was stimulated, I was aroused, I was wanting it over and over this day. I made love to my burrito with every flavorful bite and swallow. 

I will be back for sure, as I want to try other things on their menu that look irresistible. 

Food price is reasonable, friendly staff, a great salsa bar with those yummy spicy carrots and green salsa.

I will be back for sure as it has left me yearning for more! I am a dirty little whore for this place.",deL6e_z9xqZTIODKqnvRXQ,7,1,4,5N8f_anzWOdsKSjdCdbsBQ

after sitting and chomping on carrots and cucumber for some moments we decide we dont want to stay and ask for it para llevar. they got kinda upset. as we get the food and start collecting salsa my girl over hears them talking shit in spanish. i wouldnt normally mind but she was very offended especially since there were other mexicans in the dining area. 

we didnt say anything but quietly left. 3 stars for being one of the only taco shops in the area with decent food.
