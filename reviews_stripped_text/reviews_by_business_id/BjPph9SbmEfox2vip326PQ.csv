475818,2014-01-29,0,BjPph9SbmEfox2vip326PQ,"As far as ambiance goes, Brooksy's Bar & Grill does have a ""one-up"" on the other local bars on west Flamingo with its vast amount of entertainment. Not only can you enjoy one of the multiple television screens as well as a projector screen during game time, but also, if you get bored, there is always the ice rink located on the south side of the restaurant that is visible through a thick wall of clear plastic. 

However, that's pretty much the best part about Brooksy's. Some of the menu items do stand up well, but overall, the service is so unbelievably awful time and time again that unless you're a regular that buys the wait staff shots during their shift then you're probably not going to get very lucky at this establishment.

If you do venture in, as I have more than a handful of times to try and give the place a 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th chance, you'll most likely want to avoid the bar altogether and grab a seat in the restaurant portion of the open floor plan. Just keep in mind that you can't smoke in the restaurant part, regardless though, the ventilation system isn't the nicest, so you'll be walking through smoke either way, but that is the norm for Vegas. 

If you've made it in far enough in and you're in the mood for some pizza choose between the Great White or Buffalo Chicken. The Great White is made with garlic and basil as well as two types of cheeses. The Buffalo Chicken is pretty delicious with chunks of freshly grilled chicken tossed in hot sauce baked into a golden crust. If you're a meat eater, the meatballs are homemade and accompany a bowl of piping hot spaghetti and marina or can be tucked into a French loaf for a sandwich style option. Trying to watch your waistline? Then get the Chopped Salad with your favorite vinaigrette as it comes with ham, olives, onions, tomatoes and lettuce.

Again, unless you're playing at the hockey rink, watching someone play at the rink or planning on getting your food to go, just avoid Brooksy's altogether. There's plenty of other places where ambiance, delicious food AND service are offered.",o4DTgtdKpi_qpoHw4NsP5Q,1,0,2,yb1KLdKETO9bnEMxOad6aw

1333476,2014-03-12,5,BjPph9SbmEfox2vip326PQ,"I have been coming to this bar for years because my boyfriend plays hockey here. The wait staff here is absolutely terrible. The waitresses are always changing but the last two have been the worst so far.

Last week we had some blonde girl who was unbelievably rude. The way she talked to us was shocking. At one point she came over and left a pitcher of water on the table. My friend asked her for a cup and with the rudest look on her face the waitress said ""I left you a pitcher on the table!"" My friend said no I need a cup and again the waitress snaps at her that she left a pitcher of water on the table.... Umm okay, let's all drink out of the pitcher. One of the girls ordered fries and asked to change them to fire fries. The waitress goes, ""what did you order again?"" Guess what she brings out? Regular fries. They tell her and all they do is cake on spice.

Today we had another blonde waitress (different one). It was 11:56 PM and she asked if we were ready to order. We were waiting til midnight for the half off pizza deal and she told us that were not supposed to wait til midnight to get a deal, implying that we order now and pay full price. Excuse me??? Then she rudely asks what kind of pizza we want. She doesn't even ask us what size before she storms off. We ordered other stuff just for the two of us so obviously we wanted the small one, but of course she purposely brings out a large one. 

When we ordered our food I asked her for a water. She just nodded and 10 minutes later I still don't have my water. I ask again, have my friend ask, and ask yet AGAIN before she brings it out and literally slams it on the table 20 min later. Then she says to my friend ""oh you mentioned a water too"" and slams another water on the table a couple minutes later. Our food is out by that time and the rest of our party is done eating. I literally watched her do everything she possibly could except get our drinks. Talk to customers, talk to people at the bar, etc. She messed up my friends order and again she received plain fries instead of fire fries. After having dirty plates in front of us for 15 minutes she finally came by with a scowl on her face and we had to ask for our checks. The only reason we tipped is because my bf felt guilty. That only tip I wanted to leave her was ""check your attitude.""

Unfortunately I'm stuck coming to this place, but I'll stick to the bar or won't order anything from the dining area until they find different waitresses.",FWYjGKHmbjxrkXROctTGYA,9,2,1,LZYWiEvyYM5e7JyVp2EhmQ
1344183,2013-03-18,4,BjPph9SbmEfox2vip326PQ,"This bar and grill is attached the hockey rink that my husbands hockey tournament was taking place in over the weekend.  It was expected to be 90+ degrees in Vegas so I somehow managed to forget to pack a jacket (duh!) so I was a little under dressed to be spending time in a freezing hockey rink. I was lucky that Brooksy's had an entire glass wall where you can view the game and also order food and drinks in a nice cozy environment.  

The service here was great. Even though this was a bar, they didn't make a fuss when we brought in two packs of beer for the boys to drink after the game. We didn't drink the beer here and ordered lots of beer from them so perhaps that's why they were cool with it. The food was pretty decent - not super healthy stuff but it got the job done. 

We happened to eat here on Good Friday (no meat) and little was there for us to choose from. We ended up adjusting the ham and grilled cheese sammy to just being a grilled cheese. The bread was buttered and toasted perfectly and it had cheese oozing out the sides. It was so tasty! The fries that they were served with were ok. They could've stayed in the frier a little longer to get a bit more crispy but they were decent. I also ordered the side garden salad and it was really good for a garden salad. Lots of tomatoes and cucumber so they weren't stingy with their ingredients at all.

Their spicy bloody mary wasn't all that bad either. The glass it was served in was tall and narrow so a little on the smaller side but at least it was done well.

The service is great.  Friendly and quick. Good drinks (strong drinks!) and I even order food there.  (I don't typically eat bar food.  I just go for the beverages.)  The staff is super cool and do what they can to make your visit even better.  For example, I was there with a friend one time and the kitchen had closed.  I was craving their grilled cheese like crazy because it's SO good.  My friend made a special request (he might have slipped the cook a little cash--I'll never know!) and they made me a grilled cheese.  Even if my friend paid a little extra for the sandwich, I still found it nice of them to accomodate me. 

Nice atmosphere--spacious and open.  It's fun to sit next to the windows of the ice rink and watch the skaters playing hockey.  We also went iceskating one time and had a lot of fun!

Brooksy's will always be at the top of my list.  It's a great, chill, local hang-out.  Low-key and low-maintenance.  My favorite!",mJEgcdJj2Bw8T60BHvKvNQ,0,1,5,ukoGowz4hCvhTqhB2NCeFQ

I dropped him off and headed over here because I have always wanted to go to this place to watch hockey practice.

I was starving and I did not want any pizza so I just had a salad :) I don't eat meat or dairy but honestly I did not even look at the rest of the menu to even see of I had any veg options to choose from lol. I was just craving a salad :)

The salad was fresh and it had some really yummy cucumbers and tomatoes. I thought I was just imagining things because I was soooo hungry but nope it was really good :) The lettuce was not just iceberg, it had butter lettuce and a few mixed greens.

How can a big mixed salad be that good from a sports bar? Not sure but it was ;) I picked Italian dressing and it was not regular. It was full of Italian seasoning and not just oil and vinegar I it had some tomato paste in it also :) sooooo good :) 

I sat at the bar and the bartender (only front of house employee) was very nice and pleasant. The bar gaming machine I was sitting at def ate my money but I'm really glad I spent a little time in here today :)

Brooksy's Bar was the spot for post beers and some adult rec roller hockey league. All the times been never really ordered food. 

So here we go. I came with some of my hockey OHANA to watch the Vegas Golden Knights and USA hockey games on television. I ended up ordering the Zamboni Calzone. I got mixed emotions about. First impression talk about solid looking Calzone. It takes up half the plate, perfect golden brown color all around the outside, and looks like Da bomb. When I cut it in half felt little bit of let down. The filling was not very hot and overall the filling just had no wow for me. If anything hoping to see cheese melting out of it or something grab my attention. The dough itself really enjoyed and could see myself killing pizza next visit. The menu has good diversity from breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Nothing really fancy just ur basic Italian menu. 

Honest the best thing about Brooksy's! Truly hockey bar!!! I know with Vegas Golden Knights success this year lot of bars that show the games. Brooksy's is one of the few I know that turns the volume up on game day. Not just the volume the atmosphere. All the decor, during NHL season always showing games on NHL network, and you can even watch aspiring hockey player live for entertainment right in front of u.

ATMOSPHERE- Well, if with a name like Brooksy's you're expecting to walk down a dark set of basement stairs only to have to knock on the door and a pair of eyes asks you for the code word to get in.....you're WRONG. This was an inviting, fun atmosphere where i felt a really comfortable vibe.

SERVICE- I didn't encounter any real service issues, but the place gets very very busy and in turn sometimes you will wait longer to be served.

FOOD- One of the times i went there was a VGK (Vegas Golden Knights) game playing and they had an all you can eat spread. This gave me a perfect chance to sample their wings, pizza, salad, garlic knots, and cookies. Although these are only a few items on the menu they were very good (especially the pizza as you will hear many times in many other reviews).

This is a solid hang out spot, If there's a happy hour here no one went out of their way to make it known (a few years ago they didn't have one to my recollection)  

If you see me there, we can have a shot & toast to another great Las Vegas local bar.

The coolest thing is that they have shuffleboard! I don't see many bars with this game anymore. It was awesome being able to come here with my father and play. It brings back fun memories for him.

Many other options to choose from though. 
Service is questionable when not at the bar. Bar staff is really attentive to refills, or food orders. Roaming waitress however, I'll agree with another patron, forgetful, chit chats for too long with patrons, and if there are multiple checks in your party, lol good luck. You'll have Joe's pizza on your check when all you ordered was a beer! Instead of waiting for 20 minutes for her return to check on the payment of bills, we typically just sort it out on our own with IOU's.",48Ip5iJtWNvxo9QrdX07Og,0,0,4,bXzOTkRpy2n2fFhg679rMw

I had the appetizer platter and it had great chicken strips fried cheese great tasting potato skins and a different type of garlic roll knots which were just ok. The pizzas are super good I loved their crust. The pizzas were super loaded with fresh toppings. The major negative to this place that dragged it down to thee stars was how full of cigarette smoke was around. Smoke permeated the restaurant besides the lounge area even though I didn't see people smoking in the Restaurant.

They also have their venue overlooking one of the only ice rinks in town.  They host tournaments every few weeks, so come in on a weekend and you might see a few games going on, live.

Overall the staff was hit or miss. I went during a tournament so they were swamped and working long shifts.

(Forgive me I don't like to share..LOL) But I just had to do it. I saw a coupon for Brooksy's like 2 weeks ago and figured I had a credit I would try it out. I then went to Brooksy's website and saw that Friday and Saturday nights are Ladies Night! Women we drink from 5pm-midnight half off! And it's not just WELL DRINKS it's every drink! I was thrilled to see that. Usually on a Friday if you want to get into Happy Hour you have to rush from work and you usually don't get more then 2-3 hours of the good stuff! Well that's not the case here! The bartender Tammy was the best! We also had server Sandy that made sure my husband's birthday was done up right! Now to the food. Bar food at it's best a good thing but Brooksy's Sampler made me feel like we had enough food for the troops! We order 2 of them which was only $10 a piece and got more then we asked for! They didn't give us our moneys worth, they over passed it! They have a junx box but it didn't work but Sandy said no fear. They had Direct TV and she put on the music and that's when our party got into full gear. Now here's the best part. It's right next door to the LV Ice Skating Ring..so for all the people who like and love hockey you can eat and drink and actually watch the game! There's a clear wall that separate Brooksy's from the Ice Skating Rink! You sit on the end and you get to see a great game! We only caught a pick up game but thought we have to come back and watch a real game(and I don't even like hockey..LOL). All I can say about Brooksy's is save me a seat if everyone is going to steal my new GEM that was found in Vegas.

The chicken parm sandwich is pretty decent. Good size chicken breast and the sauce is thick and doesn't soggifiy the bread. Sandwich with soggy bread = FAIL.

Their mozzarella sticks and chips/salsa - both of which were pretty tasty, the tortilla chips were freshly fried and just the right amount of salt.

They jukebox plays a cool mix of old 80's rock - at least on Fridays. It'd be nice if they had a pool table but they do have shuffleboard if you're into that.

5180351,2017-09-17,0,BjPph9SbmEfox2vip326PQ,"Went to this ""Hockey bar"" to watch the Golden Knights first ever televised game, unfortunately the focus was set on the Cowboys game instead. After requesting sound for the game multiple times and eventually watching another group of hockey fans leave to find a better venu, we decided to do the same.

Before we left I stopped to let the manager know about the slow and disappointing experience we had, and his response was that the hockey fans weren't gambling as much as the few gentlemen who were there for football, so they got to choose the focus.

For a place that would represent itself as a Golden Knights bar set inside a bloody ice rink, they should be grossly ashamed of themselves. I'll be watching the remainder of the seasons games somewhere else.",rhAaS5kCbMtxfnROu_RxIg,0,0,1,krDjCQ2ZOC2JnVyDWDDuqA

Literally I walked in asked a waitress if I just pick my own table she said yea. I grabbed a table by the windows so I can watch the hockey game. 15 minutes later no one had approached me about an order or anything. I looked over finally asked a waitress for a menu. She came and brought me one. Then waited another 10 more minutes and still nothing. After waiting so long I said fuck that and left. Probably one of the worst customer service experiences in history. The two waitresses had two big tables and two small ones. Like what the hell are you guys doing at work? One of the small tables finally got pissed off still waiting to pay his bill, he walked it up to the waitress. Get some better servers, they're ruining your establishment.",lMTCG3qG5prxSzLTArZV3g,1,0,1,Ypx9kzKrtkDbcFwzZ6VJcw

5353838,2015-06-27,0,BjPph9SbmEfox2vip326PQ,They are well known for the pizza and calzones' and now I see why! My 3rd time getting food here and it has been an incredible experience every time. They also have great specials everyday. The staff is super friendly and service orientated. You can eat/drink while watching live hockey games at one of the 2 rinks.

5354853,2018-05-13,0,BjPph9SbmEfox2vip326PQ,"This was an interesting find, and I really really wanted to like this place. I never knew there was a restaurant with an ice rink on the inside. I definitely have to keep this place in mind for a great date night of ice skating in this desert hellhole hahaha. I personally don't like Hockey and the weekend I went there was a hockey tournament so the place was very loud with spectators, and for me, nothing entertaining to watch in a room with TV's. That aside, the restaurant rates 2 stars partly for the overcooked food, partly for the unattentive wait staff. I ordered onion rings, and they came out incredibly hard and cooked to death. The fact that the waitress even brought them to my table looking like that cost them my favor. Then, when I went to leave, my mother whom I brought for breakfast, wanted her plate taken to go, had to ask the waitress 3 times for a container and a bag, she finally brings just a container, no bag. We ask again for a bag, she walks away and is never seen again. Once you pay the tab you're worthless to them. Will never return as a customer to the restaurant itself, but the ice rink possibly.",3a8JVsABTdbJ8pLVX-Dcsw,0,0,2,43uBjOkcSUsdmjBbXnKrQQ

You can come in, have a full view of the hockey rink and can watch the players do their thing... It's a total experience!!
Their happy hours are amazing! Half off drinks from 3-7 and ladies night on Fri and Sat (half off!)
We are picky about the places we spend our money,..and Broosky's is a place we always feel like we got our monies worth and have an amazing time!!! 
And - the waitresses did the Ice Bucket Challenge on my partner, which was amazing. Thank you Bethany and the other blonde!:-) We love you!:-)",ahf3K7gq9OBTIz8HBcm4Mw,0,0,5,Hc1AqrUJm26snhi0Bdg10w

If you enjoy hockey and ice skating you'll love this place even more because it sits right above the Northern Rink of the Las Vegas Ice Center, allowing for an exciting, and fun, view of all games taking place. Did someone say dinner and a show?! With the Golden Knights sweeping our hearts here in Vegas, hockey has become Vegas's new love and here, you can feel it. 

Previous review mention poor staff, but I  was taken care of greatly and my items arrived quickly. 

Take my word for it, if you're looking for a good drink, good food, and gaming, come here. Plus, it's a lot better than heading to the strip.",PD6bD3EABnDgE6utrTo9TA,4,1,5,CuzkJq9I2eONorxl33Zs4g
