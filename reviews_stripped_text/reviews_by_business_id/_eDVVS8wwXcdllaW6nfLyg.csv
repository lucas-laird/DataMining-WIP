The food, vibe, and staff are all absolutely mind blowing. They have blended traditional Japanese street foods with a hip and unique twist that will make you want to try everything on the menu. The foie gras okonomiyaki is a MUST try as well as the udon fries. I'd also recommend trying Kylo's Mom to wash it all down.",G3PjMOdTmz862OMZyW3U0Q,0,0,5,5d2QDoNoeqoUY9M5HnShnw

My favorite dishes were the Corn and the Asparagus.  All the noodle dishes looked great, but we didn't save enough room for all of them so we tried the Pork Ragu and were very happy with that decision.  You must try the Takoyaki as this is a unique part of the restaurant  (you can go classic, but we ventured off and had the Escargot and Salami versions) and all are freshly made which our server said is not the norm for this dish as most people buy it frozen.  The playlist is great if you love old school hip hop (which I do).  The decor is playful.

We wanted to check out what was new and hot and the eater website led us to this place. Japanese street food? Hmm I lived in Tokyo for a while and thought now this sounds interesting. Thank you, Eater!!!

Upon first arriving I was pleasantly surprised with the decor, like nothing I had seen in Vegas before and would expect to see in the MIssion district of SF. I love Eric B and Rakim so there's that.

The food was fusion, delicious, innovative, inventive, clean, and fun. The food was also unreasonably inexpensive. Sooo cheap. The staff was friendly and knowledgeable. The music was throwing it back in the best way. A restaurant like this in SF would have lines around the block. I want to go back for more.

1296300,2017-12-02,4,_eDVVS8wwXcdllaW6nfLyg,"Japanese Tapas! Do you like things fried?

Last night I came to Paid in Full with a couple of friends to try out their tapas and chat the night away. While we ate, we couldn't or I couldn't help but move to the old school dance music that was playing. At this point in the game, my friends are used to it and I do not embarrass them anymore. Paid In Full has a very urban vibe from the music they play, the street graffiti art on the walls and the bar height table and chairs. This restaurant has an incredibly fun vibe to it. Plus there is a disco ball in the ladies bathroom, just an FYI!

After looking at the menu and several ""What do you want?""... ""I don't know, what do you want?"" we settled on four shared dishes- The Crab Croquettes, Crispy Tapioca, Traditional Octopus and the Oyster Furai. Out of all the dishes we shared, we all agreed that the Traditional Octopus was our favorite. With the rest of the dishes, it became a toss up of second to fourth place. All the dishes were good and very fried although I do have say the Crispy Tapioca came in as my second place favorite. 

The Traditional octopus were little fried balls of octopus meat and served hot with Takoyaki Sauce, pickled ginger and dried, shaved bonito. The bonito is fun to watch as it moves from the heat of the dish. Besides being entertaining the Octopus was spot on great! 

Since Paid in Full is my hood, I will definitely make an effort to stop by again. There were so many other tapas I wanted to try. See you soon, Paid In Full!",quDu_Z0-i9TCYvdHRnULEw,6,7,4,EHJRumAycbeZPit7ofahiA

1438109,2018-05-23,0,_eDVVS8wwXcdllaW6nfLyg,"Came here on a Sunday afternoon for a 2nd brunch after having a pedicure (yes... I got a pedicure. it was my first one too LOL) 

I had first heard about this restaurant at a promotional event a few months ago but never had the chance or rather forgot about this existing. Apparently, the husband of the renowned Miss Suzu of Suzuya Pasteries down a few spots had opened this restaurant. Originally I had thought this restaurant was serving similar food as what it had replaced (sushi, etc). Boy was I wrong .... LOL 

Paid in Full, to me, is like a Japanese American fusion spot. Typically not too much of a fan of fusion places but this place is gooooooood ! 

They have a small menu with a 14 small plate items, 5 large plate items, and 5 varieties of takoyaki. There is also a small brunch menu of 4 items. Large drink list on the back of the menu, and 4 more options on the brunch menu

My friend had came here previously with her sister before so we decided to try some other stuff, different from what she had.

""Pork Belly & Potato Hash w/ 2 fried eggs, shishito pepper, and garlic ra-yu oil""

Funny thing is, we enjoyed the potato hash and eggs more than the pork belly. The pork belly is good but mildly dry. The potato hash was SO GOOD ! very well seasoned and soft. very small potato cubes full of flavor. The garlic ra-yu oil (yu.. oil... redundant name... LOL) is a homemade garlic chili oil which was not that spicy but was quite fragrant. Yummy crispy chopped garlic ! 

""Marinated Mussels w/ preserved yuzu, shiso, and nori cracker""

Very light 'small plate"" item which was a nice contrast to the pork belly and potato hash. Small little mussels tossed with light greens (I cant remember specifically what kind of green this is) on 2 large nori cracker on the bottom.

""Shrimp Takoyaki w/ mentai mayo, roasted nori, and takoyaki sauce""

4 standard sized, fresh made shrimp takoyaki balls topped with a mentai mayo and takoyaki sauce. Shrimp takoyaki... shouldn't it be called ebi-yaki balls since it doesn't have tako (octopus). We both made the mistake in shoving the entire ball in our mouth (.... ehehe...) when we first got the order and regretted almost immediately. The flavor was pretty good but the shrimp didn't give the same amount of bite like octopus usually would. Maybe next time ill try the traditional takoyaki or the escargot version 

I had came up with the idea of, if they could put the fresh takoyaki balls on a bed of the potato hash with a side of fried eggs, it would be perfect. Haha maybe they can do it customized ? 

Definitely would return to try to other things. Maybe brunch again with one of their yuzu brunch drinks. I had something fairly strong earlier in the day so opt'ed out of alcohol this visit.....",Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,0,0,4,L9L-HQc4lbxAHRB-h2u3vw

I've always wanted to check out this place ever since it opened. The owners are the same owners as Suzuya patisserie. And you know how I roll with that.

What would be the best way to describe the cuisine? Modern American? How about Modern Asian? I think it's the best of both worlds so I'm just going to call it ""modern Asian American"". I like the sound of that.

I liked the deco inside. It gave me a fun vibe. It's casual so no need to wear any high end suits or spandex (if that's your thing, Great!). Just wear whatever you like, no one's going to judge. We all want the same thing. That thing is called great food.

Where to start... OK, everything was fantastic. All I need to say is this. Kurabuto Corndogs. Foie Gras Takoyaki. Sweetbread Katsu. Must I go on? If that doesn't tantalize your taste buds, I don't know what will. The options are endless. Desserts were solid. Well balanced and not too sweet. Just the way I like it.

There have been so many new places now that seem to offer innovative, creative and delicious food but ended up being below average. This place exceeded my expectations and really made me excited to come back. 

First off the place is super cool, from the wall tables and chairs to the wall paintings and decor, and the disco ball in the ladies room, very chill and creative space. The place is bright so great for foodie pics! Service was great, our server explained the menu to us, explained the name of the place to us, made recommendations, constantly checked in on us and re-filled our waters. No complaints with service at all. 

I tried one of their specialty non-alcoholic drinks, the one with yuzu (forgot what its called), it was pretty good but too pricy for the size. 

We ordered a bunch of stuff to sample and they definitely served the dishes in the order they should be served in, cold dishes first then moved onto the hot appetizers then hot entrees. 

The asparagus and crab was really good, chilled crab meat with crunchy and fresh asparagus, very light was a great dish to start with. The escargot takoyaki was great, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, pesto sauce was delicious! Wish they had bread to I could finish the rest of the sauce :) 

The sweetbread katsu was delicious! I have never had sweetbread before but my sister had so she was really excited to try this dish. Perfectly fried on the outside, soft and chewy on the inside. A little fatty but not in a nauseated way. Such a good dish and not at all expensive. The foiegras okonomiyaki was good, the ""pancake"" was too sweet for my liking and I didn't think it went well with the foiegras but overall I still enjoyed it. 

The oyster furai was awesome! Big oysters, perfectly fried, really good yuzu sauce on fresh and chilled lettuce, I like the mixture of hot/cold temperature. Clams and dumplings were good, wish I had some bread for this sauce too! I love the presentation for the yakisoba but it was way too salty, all three of us thought so. Too much sauce, this turned us off a little bit, good flavors but too salty to enjoy. 

We also got the black sesame para cotta and toast, I was too full to try so I cannot comment on that personally. But my sister and brother both said desserts were ok, nothing special. 

Overall, I highly recommend this place if you are looking for a twist to the traditional Japanese dishes. Got to try quite a few dishes and the overall check was not bad at all.",7svBs9qqPJHPRXZ56Q3ZuQ,0,0,5,l3qJS1H0h9EgZ5_tBVIUTQ

I tried a few dishes and really liked the escargot takoyaki that Rod U praised months ago- but I have to point out that I'm not usually a takoyaki fan at all, so this version with wine-poached escargot (which I DO usually love) and a great garlic aioli is a rather unusual exception. The crab croquettes were also enjoyable, and reminiscent of the version served in a shoe over on the Strip for triple the price while the brussels sprouts were similar to other versions across the valley. But the real standout here was the dessert: vanilla soft serve sounds like a snooze but the chef-suggested topping combo of balsamic blueberries and sea salt graham crackers was an aria of flavors!

2029944,2018-01-05,3,_eDVVS8wwXcdllaW6nfLyg,"""It kinda pisses me off how much I liked this place"" was a comment made by my husband shortly after our dinner at Paid in Full. It hit exactly on the nose what I was feeling, but could not verbalize. 

To give some back story, a couple years ago I had an extremely disappointing meal at another Japanese tapas place in town that shall remain nameless. I was so disappointed, in fact, that I swore off Asian tapas altogether; believing the cuisine to be overrated, overpriced, and underwhelming as a whole. To this day, that meal still qualifies for my list of top 5 worst dining experiences. 

This all said, I heard great things about Paid in Full; at least enough from the reviews on Yelp and texts from my sister and Ghia G to pique my interest. To be honest, what convinced me and my husband to give it a shot was not so much the food as it was the promise of hip hop playing in the restaurant and a drink on the menu called ""Wu Tang Punch"". I'm not kidding. My husband, our friend, and I were sold on Wu Tang Punch *THROWS UP THE W*. 

As a quick aside, hip hop playlist was on point, save for the one Will Smith song that came on. Also, unfortunately, delicious as it was, Wu Tang Punch is not alcoholic. Not a dealbreaker though because the food far exceeded our expectations. 

So, let's talk food. Here's what we ate, in order of how it was received:

UDON FRIES
French fries cut spiral-style in long, udon noodle-esue strips and topped with animal-style sauce. I was advised that it can be challenging to eat this with chopsticks. Naturally, I decided to only eat these with chopsticks. The long strands of fries were fun. However, since they are udon-esque, keep in mind that they're ""softer"" than they are crispy. But the sauce. Oh my goodness, the sauce. They nailed it so well that one might suspect they just stole a bunch of In-N-Out sauce packets and hid them in the kitchen somewhere. 

KARAAGE
Just delicious. All the pieces were juicy and crisp; perfect with the maggi ranch dressing

SWEETBREAD KATSU
I love me some sweetbreads. These were great. That is all. 

TRADITIONAL TAKOYAKI
The only place I've had that I would consider ""better"" are the ones in Little Tokyo in Downtown LA. But that's also partly because the ones in Little Tokyo are $2 and eaten while waiting for Daikokuya. There's levels there. 

KUROBOTA CORN DOGS
I'm having a bit of a rebirth in that I've suddenly decided I like corn dogs. I hated these as a kid. These are great; sausage was juicy and paired well with the nicely fried cornmeal exterior. 

SEA OKONOMIYAKI
Yo, this is bomb, dude. So good. So full of seafood. So good. 

(The above concluded our initial order for 3 people. This was plenty of food. However, because everything was so good and we learned that the foie okonomiyaki was on the way off the menu, we got greedy and ordered more food.)

CLAMS WITH UNAGI DUMPLINGS
If I wasn't about to reach max capacity, I would have drank all the broth. Let's just say my husband dislikes clams, but was sopping those suckers up. 

FOIE OKONOMIYAKI
Fall on a plate, man. So warm and rich. *INSERT HEART EYES*

The service was great. We were immediately greeted upon entering. Once a table was cleared for us, Brian came over, introduced himself and Karen, and welcomed us. Both were warm and attentive; I don't think I ever ran out of water to drink! I enjoyed conversing with them and discussing their thoughts on the menu items. 

I think the best indicator of my feelings about a new place is when I start compiling lists of things to order next time. I have such a list here. And, perhaps, a list for a visit after that. I basically just want to eat everything they make here. Paid in Full resurrected my faith in Asian tapas.",5DFshFQlbQiQTvtzH7qwlA,7,4,5,ZL-n7-7QAPp7IOZjhtKljQ

The staff is very friendly and welcoming, they made sure to check on us and were very attentive. They serve tapas style with some meal size options as well. Decor has an urban feel to it having graffiti style murials. We had ordered: 
Crispy Tapioca- AMAZING very flavorful and I love the texture, 
Edemmame Hummus- light and u can ask for more lavosh if you run out , 
Udon Fries- sooo good, animal style....tastes like fries, 
Asparagus- refreshing, 
Crab Croquettes, 
Greens & Beans- comes with pork belly on top, 
Tradtional Octopus Takoyaki- I loved em, but my friends thought it had too much ginger, 
Mushroom Takoyaki- definately recommend, 
Clams, 
Udon-like spaghetti but with udon noodles 
And Yes we made room for dessert!!
We got 2! Black Sesame Panna Cotta and Sweet Anko & Camembert Toast......BOTH

a journey which along the way will bring to you new color, new dimension, new values
thinkin of a master plan...""

combining a love for old school hip hop, star wars, japanese urban street culture, and traditional izakaya food, paid in full is everything i love about life.  when i walked in, i was immediately taken back to japan, one of my favorite countries to visit and definitely my favorite cuisine.  and then suddenly a wave of concern swept over me as i thought of all of the failed places that have tried to turn perfectly good japanese fare on its head.  my concern quickly faded after the first bite of deliciousness at this perfect little izakaya.

what i find so great about paid in full, despite the amazing name and nod to one of the greatest hip hop duo's in history, is that they make everything in the traditional way.  the takoyaki, the okonomiyaki, the karaage, all of it, is made the way it has always been done in japan, only with different ingredients like uni, foie, and sweetbreads.  some of my favorite foods made with some of my favorite ingredients.  there's nothing better.

my one and only complaint is that their vent hood might not be sufficient as i smelled like fried food when i left.  not a big deal.

i'm a huge fan and will be returning very soon.",pN6pzJR6mK7549M0azoaxg,3,2,5,pZSu2BHOo44qA1XEAzPDcQ

The decor of the cafe is really cool. Although, I'm not a fan of their high table only seating, that's just personal preference.

The service is friendly, but probably needs some polish. Our server was amiable, but felt inexperienced.

We had Sweetbread Katsu, Escargot Takoyaki (Esukarugoyaki?), Smoked Salmon Takoyaki (Sum?kus?monyaki?) and the Triple Garlic Yakisoba. Overall, the food tasted good, but it felt like their fillings and breading covered up a lot of the ""main"" ingredients' flavor. I really would like to have tasted more of the smoked salmon in the Smoked Salmon Takoyaki.

So overall, a fun and interesting cafe to try out. I would return for perhaps a snack, but not necessarily a full meal. Their dishes are priced a bit on the high side for what you get.",TprC8sujz8MkwuomrqUSiw,25,18,4,OgCatyVzuUxmaz-PZy9DHg

Of course we tried 3 of the takoyakis the original, mushroom and escargot. I liked all 3, surprisingly the octopus was my least favorite of the 3, but the mushroom is a must try.

2339262,2017-10-04,0,_eDVVS8wwXcdllaW6nfLyg,"First let me say that I am so happy that so many cool spots are opening in the SW! Thank you PiF!!!!
Ok so, Monday after our long Sunday nite, I just couldn't cook, so I came by to check out the new spot on the corner! Boy am I happy I did! Now o have one more awesome place to eat within a half mile from my house! 
The decor and style of this place is similar to Dirt Dog, but a Japanese version. Japanese street food, casual atmosphere, cool graffiti art, and awesome 90s music playing. 
Admittedly I am a newbie to Japanese street food, but was so excited by the menu  all of my dining partners were unfortunately busy or donating blood, so I was burdened with the task of trying as many menus items alone, without exploding. 
I started with one of their house NA drinks. I can't recall the name now but it was made of a mixture of a drinking vinager, fresh lime, and tonic. Yes! Loved it! Tart, refreshing, bitter. 
Then I had the crispy tapioca and the crab cocktail Mandu. Both new dishes to me, both well done. The mandu was similar to lil fried wonton/empanada type things. They had a nice crunch and spice and something I wouldn't have ordered normally (not a spicy fan) but were great! The crispy tapioca was everything I expected and more! They had aged parm finely shaved on top, and a nice crunch, before the tapioca softness. LOVED them! 
Then on to the Takoyaki, which I had seen before but never tried. So so good! Light fluffy lil balls of dough with tasty goodies inside. I had the mushroom ones, and escargot. The escargot were my favorite, only bc you don't see them much and the garlic and parsley flavors we perfect! So light and flavorful! The mushroom ones were also good, subtle mushroom flavors. 
I finished dinner with the black sesame panna cotta, with a cherry compote and sesame brittle. A great way to end!
All of this, 5 dishes and a drink, cost me $45 dollars and I was stuffed and satisfied!
The ONLY suggestions I have at this point is they need a lighted Open sign. The location is situated in an awkward spot and a lil obstructed by a low tree. I drive by often and noticed the business had changed but didn't know they had opened yet! So... don't doubt it, it's open and amazing!!!

2496964,2017-11-08,19,_eDVVS8wwXcdllaW6nfLyg,"Located in the former Fish N Bowl space on S. Durango, Paid In Full is a fun & funky spot for classic Japanese Street Food as well as Asian-fusion Street Food. They've been making noise for the last couple of months with their killer food and 80's rap/R & B sound tracks. 

My love and I met up recently with the famed Yuhi K. and enjoyed everything we shared. My favorite item of the night was the Sea Okonomiyaki. This squid and white fish pancake is topped with bonito flake, sea urchin aoli and single piece of uni. Most of the dishes at PIF are fried or a little on the heavy side, and as such, are great for sharing, but this Sea Okonomiyaki is something I could easily devour on my own.

Another favorite of mine was the Clams. Composed of unagi dumplings, sake dashi broth, mushrooms, and clams of course, this dish was wonderfully balanced and a great example of how good fusion items can be. The unagi dumplings came out just like gnocchi, and soaked up the flavor of the broth perfectly.

We were planning on trying their traditional octopus takoyaki, but ended up trying two fusion takoyaki versions instead. The mushroom takoyaki with black truffle and scallion worked great as a fried ball of love! I would definitely order them again. We also had the smoked salmon takoyaki, made with dill cream sauce, wasabi mayo and Ikura. I found this to be interesting and worthy of exploration, but didn't enjoyed as much as other happy members of my party. 

In an attempt to get our veggies in, we opted for the Asparagus. The Asparagus was joined by blue crab kewpie, yuzu miso, and Ikura...it was one of many enjoyable dishes that night. The only item I didn't really enjoyed was the Oyster Furai. They use large Oysters, like Blue Points, that make for a good portion size, bit also leaves them overly meaty and void of the flavors of the premium oysters. There is a good value in this dish, but it's not for me. 

We finished our meal with Sweet Anko & Camembert Toast. I was expecting a play on Honey Toast, but this was more like Japanese French Toast. Out table completely enjoyed it, as was the case with most of the items, and I'd be happy to have it again.

The atmosphere is fun, and matches the food... This is street food after all, so they try to bring the streets into the restaurant, with graffitied wall and funky pop art. The 80's rap and hip hop will also take most 40 something's down memory lane. Make a point to check them out if you haven't already.",A5A34ixb-yy6nwL42iZsnw,36,34,4,1pmI9Ilxj_s2ISlTZq9RgA

After hearing and reading numerous reviews about Paid in Full, I couldn't wait any longer, time for the wife and to get our grub on some Japanese street food!

I checked in on Yelp and was pleasantly greeted by some old school jams, Cypress Hill - Jump Around. Ordered some house dranks- Wu Tang punch: sparkling tang and Thai basil syrup 5/5. Now I gotta go to the store and get me a jug of Tang powder.

Another jam on, it's like nonstop here...Color me Badd - All for love. 

We scoped out the menu and ordered some small plates: but wait! Beastie Boys is on, No sleep till Brooklyn...ok back to the review, we ordered crispy tapioca topped with aged Parmesan and nori powder 5/5, and the udon fries animal style 5/5. Clean plate after clean plate, nothing left, utterly delicious.

Bone thugs n harmony in da house, thuggish ruggish bone. Better watch out I might bust a move!

For entree's we ordered the mushroom takoyaki topped with black truffle kewpie and scallions 5/5, the truffle oil and mushroom was amaze balls...literally, and the traditional octopus with takoyaki sauce and pickled ginger bonito 5/5. All the flavors came together well and the octopus was uber tender. 

Stereo MC - Make sure your connected. Jams I haven't heard in a minute. Loving it! Skee-lo - I Wish.

For dessert we chose the Sweet Anko and Camembert Cap'n Crunch breading and kuromitsu syrup 5/5. Such a unique dessert, you tip open the paper and grab the pipette and squeeze the syrup on your desired spots. Fantastic!

De la soul - Me myself and I. The jams don't stop till you drop! DJ quik Tonite. Arrested Development - Everyday people. Fugees - ready or not.

Excellent service and the manager Peter, was very cool. Would love to give this place 6/5 but limited to 5/5.

2766993,2018-03-27,0,_eDVVS8wwXcdllaW6nfLyg,"I wanted to love this place, but it didn't fit the bill. First off, they don't allow you to request changes to any dishes whatsoever, So if your allergic to something in a dish... too bad I guess. I've been to other restaurants like this, and it's quite a turn off. If a restaurant is going to have this rule, I think it ought be wise for them to at least have plenty of options to choose from. For instance, they have only 1 noodle/yakisoba option and it's made with pork belly. My husband asked if he can sub it for chicken or get it without the pork and they wouldn't. There is only 1 chicken option and it wasn't very appealing. The Brussel sprouts were good but after a few bites I felt sick to my stomach, one of those dishes that is a mix of sweet, tang, and spice which requires a change in flavor to tame down the taste buds. I ordered the cauliflower dish as well, which was good for a few bites but same problem, needed a break from the fried, spicy heaviness. The waitress was so nice and attentive, the reviews were high, I wanted to support a small business and it's near my house so I wanted to like this but we felt like crap by the time we got home and probably won't be back unfortunately. There are too many great Japanese food options within the area that are more reasonably priced, and will let you order what you want... you know, since you are PAYING for the food after all.",KcnOCYCtaDE_gaGQYx5o7g,0,0,3,G7yrVJktP4ABuvpmPZjwpg

-Oyster Furai
-Asparagus 
-Clams
-Pork Ragu
-Mushroom Takoyaki

Every dish was delightful, one after another. The fame of the two chefs met our expectations above and beyond and we truly enjoyed all the savory items we shared...even the Sweet Anko desert caught me off the guard, as one of my favorite sweet treats ever! I was told they change items periodically, so if you see something that stimulates your taste buds, go ahead and have at it!!

We started with the Udon fries, which are Udon noodles that are fried and covered with a sauce that tastes EXACTLY like the spread from In n Out. As an In n Out fan, this was super exciting for me. It's the perfect munchie food. 

We also got the Traditional Octopus Takoyaki. I've had takoyaki before and I thought it was just ok. But this takoyaki was sooo good! Each piece had a good amount of octopus, which I was super excited about. There's nothing I love more than tender, grilled octopus. I also really liked the shredded pickled ginger on top. 

We also ordered a dish called greens and beans that I kind of didn't like. I loved the pork belly but the natto (fermented soybean) wasn't my thing at all. I'd order something else if you've never had natto and aren't that adventurous. I definitely don't blame the chefs for that though. It was a good dish but it wasn't my taste. 

The dessert menu looked really unique and delicious but I was too full to order it. I also know that they're planning on eventually putting in some beer taps, but for now there are none.

3333658,2018-04-11,0,_eDVVS8wwXcdllaW6nfLyg,"Really tasty food.  I saw many of the dishes as comfort Japanese fare.  They have about 5 varieties of takoyaki and 3 okonomiyaki with everything from octopus to foie gras.  Paid in Full seemed to specialize in small dishes as well, with corn, Brussel sprouts, and udon fries to name a few.  Then they also had about 5 large plates that were enormous enters, for under $20.  Price-wise Paid in Full excels.  You can fill up on a few entrees to share or get about 4 tapas, and you won't hit $40 (without drinks).  The drink game was fine with a couple interesting Japanese varieties like an imported Japanese IPA and a boxed sake.  

I had a few boxed sake and really was impressed by how smooth it was and just the niftyness of the packaging.  We also had the special sausage pasta and garlic yakisoba.  The pasta was as good as any neighborhood Italian.  I was expecting more fusion, but this dish was just a quality rendition of spaghetti and sausage with some mushrooms mixed in.  The yakisoba was fantastic.  So much garlic, but not enough for the smell to uninvite.  The pork belly was melt in your mouth consistency and the mushrooms were perfect additions to the dish.  This was one of the better dishes I've had in a while, coupled with the nice take-out presentation.  The Brussel spouts were fantastic but unfortunately they took about 30 minutes.  I had assumed they would be a starter, but they ended our meal as a dessert.  Lemon and some chili, but charred to perfection.  The dish was mainly just leaves rather than full Brussels, which was very interesting and enticing.  The full meal left us with lunch and a half to bring home.  The total bill was about $65 with 2 entrees, a side, and 3 drinks.

Every dish we had was above par.  The menu has some dishes like the takoyaki variety, corn dogs, and udon fires that I've never ever seen or heard of based on my dining Vegas.  Paid in Full is a small restaurant and service is oh so slow as they are extremely under staffed, but it's definitely worth it for an interesting take on the cuisine.",JaqcCU3nxReTW2cBLHounA,1,1,4,Hz9TrTl-C4_XExRVADn3ew
3352555,2018-01-16,0,_eDVVS8wwXcdllaW6nfLyg,"Tried this place for dinner last weekend and had mixed feelings about it, as some dishes were really good, while some were just average. The food also came out quite slow. 

It's located in the same plaza as Jiffy Lube and Suzuya bakery. Since it's only open for dinner, it has plenty of parking around the time. The place is quite small with only four tables, but they do have seatings along the counter.

The dish highlights were:
1. Lamb Ribs ($12) - Delicious! The ribs were tender and they're coated with flavorful black bean sauce.
2. Sea Okonomiyaki ($14) - Tasted great, had lots of seafood in the batter, cooked quite crisp, and topped with some uni.

The rest of the dishes we ordered were just OK. They were:
1. Foie Gras Okonomiyaki ($17) - the foie gras tasted great (can't go wrong with a foie gras!). It was cooked perfectly and the portion was generous. However, the okonomiyaki itself was pretty bland and not cooked as crisp as the sea okonomiyaki. If you love Foie Gras, it is worth it for the price and the portion of foie gras you receive. Most steakhouses would charge at least $24 for the foie gras alone. Just eat the foie gras and skip the rest! lol
2. Clams with eel dumplings ($16) - I loved the clams, the mushroom, and the broth, but I did not like the dumplings at all. Granted that the dumplings were fluffy (once they touched the broth, they did turn soggy), but I just don't think they went well with the dish.
3. Escargot Takoyaki ($9) - I loved escargot, so the filling was fine, but the takoyaki was rather bland and not savory at all. The surface was also not crispy. In addition to the takoyaki sauce, it came with some salsa verde sauce, which didn't jive well with the rest of the dish elements.

I like the concept overall. Food presentation was great. Service was decent, but not fantastic (there were times our water was left completely empty for a while). The waitress was nice and friendly though. 

I appreciate their creativity, but I feel that it came in the expense of the food taste itself on some dishes. Will I come back? Yes, I'm willing try their other dishes, but I'm not exactly rushing to do so...",A5RC8s-n2FEbAR5GRUNHDA,0,0,3,6JSUoKBzRnAFgQjp3OxlGA
3373477,2017-11-06,0,_eDVVS8wwXcdllaW6nfLyg,"Their service is excellent! I think it was their boss that was very engaging with us and helped guide us through the menu. So why only 3 stars you ask?

Some of the food was great! But some was meh.

Lets start with the takoyaki. I didn't have the original one because I can make it home. We tried the smoked salmon one with the recommendation from our server. It was AMAZING! I think the takoyaki was one of my favorite plates. Not only was it different from a normal takoyaki but they got that flavor on point! The only thing missing was that crispy outside. It was kinda crispy i suppose, but I think by the time we got it, it was a little soggy already. Insides were nice and yummy though aside from that. 

So I was a bit disappointed when I didn't see the clams with the unagi dumplings on the menu but saw it in photos, they looked bomb. I just assumed they didn't serve these anymore BUT we were told it was off the menu but they have it! I got super excited. These clams were also one of the better menu items! That delicious sauce that covered the clams... mmmm... just thinking about it makes me want to go get some more! I'm assuming the unagi dumplings were just with the sauce? I didn't recognize the texture of the unagi in them. I could be wrong but it still tastes delicious.

We got the brussel sprouts too. Although I loved the crispy texture and it was well cooked, that vinegar was way too sour and just ruined the taste of them. Too sour, please skip this item. 

We also got the foie gras okonomiyaki . I got mixed feelings about this one. All of it together tasted good. But I felt like the okonomiyaki was missing something. This is probably the best one in town still to be honest aside from home made. But I think it was because it was sweet? It was probably sweet because it had to offset the foie gras's saltiness. So when you eat all of it together in a bite its great! But you just get a small piece on top and then you're eating the rest of the sweet okonomiyaki. 

I'd probably give these guys another try because I'd like to try their other items. Their bathroom btw, decorated interestingly.",XopP_70iyfC3iCPAY-sz4Q,3,0,3,RPoJG901xqU_WtKprbrRQg

3397415,2018-02-14,1,_eDVVS8wwXcdllaW6nfLyg,"Walking in, already we liked the vibe in this funky-fresh new spot. A couple of small sensory changes would make the experience even better. Dim the lights a bit; I found it to be too brightly lit and it seemed a weird juxtaposition for the theme with the brick, graffiti and old school hip hop. I was wanting the music volume up just a smidge; it's one of the neat things about the restaurant, so really own it! I was looking forward to maybe even seeing the disco ball in the dining room, but that's just an affinity towards glitter. :)

Service was fabulous the whole way through. Our server scooted 2 tables together to get our group seated promptly. She was on top of drinks, kept dishes flowing, explained anything we had questions about and had good recommendations based on our group's likes. Awesome!

On to dishes:
· Everything Bagel Edamame: Going to Trader Joe's to pick up some everything bagel seasoning right now. 5/5
· Crab Croquettes: Our server recommended as a crowd fave, and biting into the fried thing, I can see why. The panko-crisped crust is tasty. But, I found the inside too creamy, even a bit mushy, for my taste and the creaminess overtook flavor. Comes with a shishito pepper, now that was perfect, gimme a plate of those! 2.5/5
· Shrimp Tatoyaki: Arrives looking very pretty, and the flavors don't disappoint. 4/5
· Udon Fries: Read several reviews mentioning the well known ""In-N-Out Burger flavor"" and yes, it's true. This was a good dish, but I found the Udon Fries to be spongy in texture, not crisped like a ""fry-fry"". Still, it's a fun dish to eat. 4/5
· Japanese Eggplant: a satisfying dish with a smart addition of spiced crumbled cashews give the dish really great texture. 4/5
· Clams and mushrooms: 3.5/5 The table next to us recommended; they weren't wrong. The dish is packed with clams, enoki mushrooms soaking up all the brothy-goodness. It's umami & salty, in a strong broth with a hint of tangy sweet sake. It's served with an unagi gnocchi, which were my least favorite. When I read the menu, I misread an ""uni"" dumpling. The unagi made them overly sweet. Instead, I was really craving a crusty bread pairing to sop up the broth. The broth was truly the star, add some buttered crusty bread on the side & no need for dumplings = 5 stars. *Side note: I took most to-go and warmed over crispy rice the next day, left off the gnocchi. BOMB!
Beef Dish: Can't remember the name but think Japanese pot roast. Hearty beef served with carrots in a delicious sauce. I couldn't try one more thing at this point, save for dessert, but friends said it was filling and a comfy dish to eat.

·Dessert: Save room for some maple crumble and brown sugar bacon soft serve. A little ice cream, crumble and walnut sauce=perfect bite. I don't eat dessert, our table shared and all enjoyed the finale. 

They are a young restaurant, with a creative & refreshing menu and a FUN place to eat! As they are able to tweak their menu & experience, they can just take off in a huge way! 3.5 Stars, for now - I'll be back to try the Mapo tofu Frito, Brussels, Garlic Yakisoba, sea & foie okonomonaki, and octopus tatoyaki.",uPCA1BS0LxlTg68BTyEQpg,4,1,4,jzcJQ-MHH7h6DMs8yV3v1Q

The customer service here is probably a 4.5.

I say that because they were so attentive and friendly, it was great! However, one of our orders was filled with tiny bits of crab shell and after asking if it was supposed to have that, they said no, and sorry about that. I feel like maybe they could have taken it off our bill or discounted us a bit on that. 

Other than that, everyone was so friendly and helpful!

The food was interesting for sure. I don't think it's my kind of food, but it's a fusion that I think that certain people may like. My party of 3, were intrigued by the ideas of the foods, but they were definitely different. Not in a bad way, just in a different way.

3516147,2017-10-26,1,_eDVVS8wwXcdllaW6nfLyg,"I think my expectations for this place were really high. After my first visit I have to admit I was a little let down.

We ordered
-crispy tapioca 
-udon fries
-yasai
-mushroom takoyaki
-crispy brussel sprouts 
-seafood okonomiyaki 
-black sesame panna cotta

I'm not sure how I felt about the crispy tapioca. The outside layer reminded me of a hash brown but the inside reminded me of mochi. The flavor was good and super cheesy but the chewiness of the crispy tapioca wasn't really something I liked. The udon fries were the same texture as the crispy tapioca, but were flavored with in-n-out sauce. If you're planning on getting these dishes I would only pick one or the other because of the similarity of texture in these dishes. The seafood okonomiyaki was more on the mushy side, I wish it had a little more crisp to it. The uni on top was a nice compliment to the dish. I found the mushroom takoyaki to be my favorite savory dish of the night. Reminded me of a mushroom puff, delicious. The crispy brussel sprouts were a little too acidic and because of that it was hard to enjoy the dish. My friend said that this dish smelt like trash (lol, what?). Yasai was not one of my favorite dishes either. I didn't like the choice of vegetables in this pickled dish. The beets were seasoned the worst. The best part of this meal was really saved for last. The only reason why I would consider coming back is because of the black sesame panna cotta. Soooo good, loved everything about it.

Honestly I am confused about all the rave. This place was just okay to me. I didn't really like the fact that 5/7 dishes we ordered were fried. Ehh would take a lot for me to want to go back and try the other things.",JtpZw-NLL5m6BNjd0LPQVQ,2,1,3,rOivfz5bUbpIKVTKL7EVxg

-Paid In Full
Eric B & Rakim

We FINALLY made it to Paid In Full with much anticipation! As we step inside, I'm an instant fan seeing the sick graffiti and mural that cover the walls, accents of Star Wars, 80's and 90's pop culture, and a bangin' soundtrack dating back to the old school Hip Hop ""Yo MTV Raps/Freestyle"" Era.(some of the BEST.DECADES.EVER!) Add a C in front of Rap music and that's what you have playing on the radio nowadays. Wouldn't you agree???

Chefs Jason Olson and Michael Plourde are former chefs from Wynn who left the corporate world with a master plan and struck out on their own facing the daily hustle and grind to finally live up to their dreams and get PAID IN FULL...

PIF's menu  consists of Japanese street food favorites fused(Japa-Fusion?) with American classics and French bistro/European twists as well. Most restaurants that do fusion food try too hard sometimes which ends up in ""con-fusion"", but not here. The chefs' skills, creativity and passion are very evident on each plate that goes out.

PIF doesn't have a liquor license(yet), but their signature dranks are worth checking out. 
WU-TANG PUNCH 
This classic orange drink gets doctored up with bubbles and Thai Basil Syrup. Interestingly good!
JUMBO OZAKI 
Barley tea and yuzu lemonade give this drink an Arnold Palmer taste. Very refreshing!

Small plates are tasty, fun, and meant to be shared. 2-3 items are suggested per person, but food comes out as soon as the chefs plate it up, so order at your own pace, and not all at once(keep a menu with you) so that you can enjoy each plate at its most optimum point, which you should, unless of course you don't mind cold food meant to be served hot cause your priorities are to get ""that shot"" for your IG  (Instant Gratification) SMH.......

UDON FRIES ""ANIMAL STYLE ""
Spuds are replaced by udon noodles and gives a nice crunch with a chewy interior. NAILED.IT with the sauce! Seriously made me feel like I was at In-N-Out! Snap your pix, cut the chit chat, and kill it before it turns cold and soggy.

UNI SANDO
This totally reminded me of those Oscar Mayer commercials where a kid would be singing about his/her B-O-L-O-G-N-A sandwich. Rosa salami,  Karashi mustard , and UNI give this classic a refined update in these tea sandwich sized bites. I found that the mustard and salami overpowered the uni. :(

ESCARGOT TAKOYAKI (ESCARGOTYAKI???)
I haven't seen any restaurant take a traditional Takoyaki and twist it up like PIF has, so we had to get a version of the French inspired ones. Love at first bite! Tako, Kewpie mayo, and bonito flakes are replaced by garlic aioli, parsley sauce, and SNAILS! So good,  It'll have your tastebuds shouting PUTAIN DE MERDE! LOL!!!

SWEETBREAD KATSU
This was Wifey's request, and glad we ordered it! There's no sweet bread of any type here. It is the thymus gland of a calf. Quit making those EEEW! faces and don't knock it till you try it! You'd never think twice about scarfing down things like fattened goose liver, or even a sea urchins gonads would you? That's what I thought...Slightly poached, then fried like tonkatsu. Crispy on the outside, creamy on the inside, the Frisse au Lardon-ish salad compliments the katsu well. Signature dish status right there!

FILLET OF FISH SANDO
This golden arches classic has been refined and shouldn't be missed! Crisp, flaky fish (Cod?) fillets on a soft toasted bun, shrettuce,  American cheese, and yuzu tartar sauce...SAVOR.EVERY.BITE!

Super stuffed at the moment,  Yoda's voice echoed out of nowhere saying ""Order dessert you will"", and next thing you know, out comes a BLACK SESAME PANNA COTTA WITH A DARK CHERRY COMPOTE AND BLACK AND WHITE SESAME BRITTLE. PB&J lovers will see the similarities in this excellent dessert.

Great first visit, and most definitely looking forward to coming back soon! ALOHA!!!

Shaka Meter:  \uuu/  \uuu/  \uuu/  \uuu/  \uuu/  5

KNOW BEFORE YOU GO:

Sit up at the counter...best seats in the house IMHO

Check out the restrooms(especially the women's one!)

If you MUST ""do it for the 'gram"", do it quickly, enjoy the food, and connect with those around you, not your phone...that gets old.

3807330,2018-02-05,0,_eDVVS8wwXcdllaW6nfLyg,"This place is simply exceptional. I have never had Japanese food like this before. I love this place because they serve Japanese food that you usually don't see in other restaurants, like takoyaki and okonomiyaki. EVERTHING I had was very good. These are the things I tried:
Udon fries: These surprised me, because they tasted like and had a consistency like fries, but they were noodles. They were really good
Crab Croquettes: These were delicious, but they didn't really stick out. The pepper tasted pretty good too. 
Okinawan Sweet Potato: I didn't really know what to expect from this one, because I don't really like sweet potatoes, but there was a lot of plum sauce on it, which tasted really good. The potatoes were nice and soft. 
Brussels Sprouts: These were the best Brussels sprouts I've had. The sauce did kind of get rid of any of the health benefits that it had, but they were still really good. 
Asparagus: The way that this dish was served was a little awkward, but it still tasted great. I just don't know how you were supposed to eat it. 
Salmon Takoyaki: Very fluffy and light. They had chunks of salmon in them, and they were pretty good. I've had ebelskivers before, and these were pretty similar.
Garlic Yakisoba: This was a very large plate, and my group split it. It was served in a Chinese takeout box, and that was really clever. The pork belly melted in your mouth. 
We also had the toast and an ice cream sundae. They were also really good. The restaurant itself was very nice, and the staff was really nice. I loved it

UPDATE: I came back and tried some new stuff. I noticed that they changed the menu too. They took nothing off the small plates, only added some stuff. They replaced their old udon dish with a new one. 
Yasai: This is a refreshing start to a meal. The pickled vegetables we had were asparagus, celery, beets, and carrots. 
Lamb ribs: These were delicious! They had barbecue sauce and peanuts on top, and they were really tender. The only thing was that there were only four of them, so in my four person party, each person got only one rib. 
Mushroom takoyaki: These were good too. I liked them more than the smoked salmon ones, and these seemed crispier to me, which I liked. 
Kurobuta Corndogs: I hadn't had a corn dog for a while, so I liked to try one again. These were definitely upscale corndogs, with fancy sausage and good condiments. 
Phat rice noodles: These were brand new, so I wanted to try it. They kind of reminded me of a Thai dish because of the noodles. The chorizo was very tasty, and it had a unique flavor. It all blended well

I went again!! Here's what I tried:
Yuzu Beets: These were a new menu item when I came, so we tried them. I am not the biggest beet fan, but someone in my party is, and they loved it. I do like yuzu, so that was good. 
Crispy Tapioca: These were kinda weird, but they weren't bad. If I was to describe them, it would be like a giant, savory boba with a crispy outside. 
Karaage: The best fried chicken I've had, really. Most of the time, when you get those little chicken bits, they're mostly breading. But these were delicious and every piece had a good amount of chicken. 
Sea Okonomiyaki: Very good! Tons of seafood,  which I like. The bonito flakes, with they're funny dances, were something else. 
Mapo Tofu Frito Pie: the best thing we had that night. The cheese and the pork was so good. You just have to try it

I went AGAIN! This time, we just ordered a large plate for each person, and a couple small plates for appetizers. 
Shishito peppers: I liked these because they were not too spicy. The yuzu sauce complimented the spicy peppers nicely. I also like those bonito flakes. 
Clams: DANG. That broth is sooooooo good. And they aren't stingy with the clams either, so that's good. The dumplings melted in your mouth. 
Salmon special: This wasn't on the menu, but it might be in the future. The person in my party got it , and I tried some. It had a potato coating, with a puréed pumpkin under it. Very good. 
I mean, this place has food to be expected from the strip, but in a very casual setting and at prices that are  a deal compared to strip restaurants.
I have returned! Here is what I got, and I should say that I went on Sunday for brunch. There was a special brunch menu. 
Wagyu Beef Belly Ni: Very savory and warm, the belly was ultra tender and the root vegetables were soaked in the broth so long they almost tasted like meat, especially the gobo. 
Apple cinnamon taiyaki: this is a brunch menu item. I had heard of taiyaki before, and I figured this would be a good place to try it. The pancake was so fluffy and light, and the apples were perfect. The whipped cream was also surprisingly good. 
Edamame: This is a tiny little dish, with only edamame and everything bagel seasoning. But still it is the best edamame I have had.",sJ4RYCb_KmJonK-WJzjGRw,0,0,5,noLIxAvhXrAQ4zTTYjKCAQ

3885337,2017-10-05,1,_eDVVS8wwXcdllaW6nfLyg,"My boyfriend and I were going to a place next door so we decided to give this restaurant a try because I just read an article about it. It's pretty small, but I liked the atmosphere. Whenever I visit a restaurant I always take into consideration if what I'm getting is worth the price. Who wants to pay $50 for food they aren't huge fans of? They recommend the plates to be shared 2-3 per person. We weren't super hungry, but decided to try a couple of the small plates: 

Crab mandu: (2/5) I wasn't a huge fan. I kind of wish they just put the cocktail sauce on the side. When it was put on top I couldn't finish more than one. I ended up giving it to my boyfriend because it was overpowering. 

udon fries: (3/5) This dish was pretty good because it's different. I really enjoyed the texture of the fried udon. It was a little chewy but had good texture. The one thing I didn't like was that the sauce was just placed in the middle, but since the noodles were long and kind of hard that I couldn't even tell and ate a bunch of noodles without the ""dirty sauce."" When we got to the end there was way too much sauce because we couldn't mix the entire dish up. 

crab croquette: (3/5) Good flavor. You get 4 of them, which I'm not sure is super worth the price. 

mushroom takoyaki: (5/5) I love takoyaki. I loved this mushroom one. The flavor was so different than what I'm used to. I would come here just for this.

The service was nice. They were pretty attentive. When we visited they have been open for about 5 days. They let us take the menu home in case we ever want to call in an order.",ERcsc0YO5CCUbkC8EV2INg,10,2,3,zEBh63lArFfuOiDR6nzdEg

Paid in Full is in the location where Fish N Bowl was for several months.  There are hits and misses in the food.  The karaage needed some frying that would be crispy instead of soft breading.  The same for the sweetbread katsu.

Paid In Full food, that got me full: We went with the traditional takoyaki (octopus) and it was fantastic.  This is my Vegas Takoyaki champ currently. The Lamb Ribs were tender, tasty and fell off the bone. Brussels Sprouts exceeded expectations in taste and made me feel healthy af.  The Kurobata Corn dogs were good as corn dogs as can be.  The sweet anko camambert toast and balsamic blueberry sundae were great.  I'm not really a dessert guy but these are two I would order again quickly.  Creative in how the ingredients complimented each other and not too sweet.  If you love sea salt like I do, get the blueberry sundae!

Ambiance:  Tables and seats are elevated only, fyi.  The street graffiti murals on the brick walls are very cool and run parallel with the food theme.  The background music was classic rap and hip hop which really brought me back to a good place in my youth.  I can hang out all day on the music alone! hehe  Nothing like it in Vegas currently.

This is a great place to introduce someone to Japanese street food as well as veterans.  The bill can add up quickly with the tapas style dish portions.

Crab croquettes: Four small pieces, but worth it. My favorite out of the things I ordered. It was light on the batter, heavy on the filling.

Liked: escargot takoyaki (easily our favorite thing of the night), black sesame panna cotta (panna cotta with sweet black sesame brittle, really nice sweet crunch), crab croquettes (mushy, flavorful and satisfying)

Disliked: Udon (not an olives fan), Wu Tang Peach drink (tasted like melted orange popsicle) and the price.  Bill ended being $72 for 5 plates and one drink.

Paid in Full is a casual, affordable, Japanese street food joint with dishes that are executed at an expert level. 

I can't say enough good things about the service and food here. I wish we were hungrier but we had 3 dishes and there were about 15 more I wish we would have tried.

The lamb ribs are amazing; one of the best dishes I've had in awhile. Wonderful blend of spices and the perfect amount of heat. Pick up with your hands and get dirty, so so good. 

The Japanese eggplant was delicious as well. A large portion for the price! I've had Japanese eggplant a lot but never prepared like this. They were a soft crispy... bit crispy but not overly baked or grilled the way it's traditionally served. They were almost like eggplant fries. Really unique. 

Finally we had the mushroom takoyaki which was amazing and I wish I could eat it every day. The perfect amount of truffle flavoring which didn't overpower the mushrooms inside these delicious little puffs of heaven. Came with 4 so perfect to share. 

Brian served us and was knowledgeable, well spoken and friendly.

NYC 80's hip hop culture meets Star Wars geek via Japan.  Otaku American?  Age of the geek baby!

The food is inventive, taking elements of Japanese cuisine and mixing it up with Americanized flavors and ingredients.  Put it another way, the chefs are white dudes.  As such the flavors are very well matched with the American palate.

Dishes are meant to be shared.  Order in waves so everything is served at the appropriate temperature.

Straight up, takoyaki and it variants impress.  Not what you'd expect in Osaka.  The balls were not ripping hot with a slightly molten core rather cooked through, crisp on the outside, and cool enough to handle.  Very light saucing (not doused like the true Japanese version).  The primary sauce, has just the right tartness and acidity.  The traditional has a large, tender piece of octopus within, sauced lightly and topped with bonito and pickled ginger.  The escargot, outstanding.  Wine poached escargot in the middle, kicked up with a garlic aioli.  Mushroom and truffle pairs with the traditional takoyaki sauce and Japanese mayo well.  Smoked salmon with dill cream, topped with ikura, good eats.

The sweetbread katsu is a home run.  What appears to be veal thymus gland vs the pancreas sweetbread due to its smooth texture, are traditionally cooked then coated in panko and deep fried.  Light but firm with a mild organ meat flavor.  It pairs very well with the accompanying sauce that brings out the sweetness.

Sadly, other dishes sampled were just OK, some less successful.  The karaage (sake / soy marinated then deep fried) had too much breading and was overcooked probably due to being cut too small and unevenly.  The crab croquettes with old bay seasoning doesn't compliment other dishes.  The edamame hummus, strange.   The vegetal taste of the beans is apparent.  Udon fries (deep fried udon), rubbery.  

NO ALCOHOL as of this review.  Very disappointing as the food begs for something, anything, shochu, sake, even a PBR (did I just say that) to clear the palate between bites and make you salivate for the next.  

Friendly off Strip service.

It would probably be four stars if alcohol were served as it's such an integral part of an Izakaya dining experience.  Reserving a final rating until after liquor service begins and the restaurant settles in.  For now, it has just enough to make you want to come back.

Hit the studio, 'cause I'm paid in full."" 
-Paid in Full, Eric B & Rakim

In the now bustling SW part of town comes the newest dining destination. Taking over the space formerly occupied by Fish n Bowl we now have Paid in Full serving Japanese fusion in a space paying homage to old school hip hop from the name, wall art, and the music playlist. 

Set up tapas style there are small plates, large plates, takoyaki, and dessert. Beer, wine, and sake will be added in the coming weeks. Currently there is a selection of teas, sodas, and non alcoholic mixed drinks available. They have a great take on an Arnold Palmer called the Jumbo Ozaki after the Japanese golfer. Using barley tea and yuzu and it's a more refreshing take the usual  iced tea/lemonade combo. 

Offering an excellent selection of 13 small plate, 5 large plate, and 5 takoyaki options there is something for everybody.

We went with the menu recommendation of 2 - 3 plates per person we ordered 4 plates plus dessert. And while it's easy to run up a bill with this style of dining I would, depending on your group, probably recommend 3 - 4 plates per person especially if you end up ordering more of the smaller plate options. 

We started with the Udon fries ""animal style"". The udon has a great chewy texture and even though I typically don't like thousand island dressing this was a much better rendition. My only complaint here would be the puddle of sauce that ends up on the plate. When you get to the last of the noodles they were soggy.

The sweetbread katsu was well done. The sweerbreads were poached first giving them a slightly firmer texture that worked well the crispy breading. The accompanying salad was light with a prefect bit of saltiness from the bacon.

The udon ""puttanesca"" was a favorite. That familiar briny salty flavor was even better because of roasted tomatoes and the addition of squid. 

The clams were served a light flavorful sake dashi broth with mushrooms and small unagi dumplings that were similar to a small gnocchi but with a little less bite to them. 

Lastly for dessert the anko camembert toast was ordered. This was the cutest dish coming sealed in a little white paper bag with two little vials of kuromitsu syrup (similar to molasses but thinner and milder tasting) stuck in it. This ends up as something resembling a stuffed French toast crossed with grilled cheese. The packaging is ripped open at which point you squeeze the kuromitsu onto it. The toast is breaded with Cap'n Crunch and covered with powdered sugar. The Cap'n Crunch offers just enough bite to the outside and the red bean paste adds just a touch of sweetness to the camembert. 

Paid in Full is definitely a great addition to the area. The restaurant is bright and colorful. The wait staff and host were friendly and welcoming. I look forward to coming back and working my way through the menu.",-TrZfd9aC4k_7A2i0icMVg,13,11,4,QcYID3uUMZvpHnp6qVg0xA

5279886,2017-12-11,2,_eDVVS8wwXcdllaW6nfLyg,"Admitting up front that I have no idea who Eric B & Rakim are, nor a great deal of appreciation for eateries that seem to value being ""cool"" over being excellent, it was with four frequent dining pals that a table was filled at Paid in Full on Friday night, an Email sent in advance and answered by Chef Michael Plourde putting names on the wait list at 6:30pm but the no reservations policy still seeing groups wait for nearly thirty minutes in a small area next to the Bar.

Decorated in a style best described as Retro-J-Pop, everything from graffiti geishas to Star Wars and a disco ball making an appearance in the former Fish n' Bowl space on South Durango, Paid In Full originally opened its doors in late September as the brainchild of two former Wynn employees with high accolades coming from at least one highly valued voice, the Japanese Street Food concept at the very least something new in a part of town otherwise mostly same-same.

In reality as much ""fusion"" as it is Street Food, the frequently changing menu only found via Social Media featuring everything from ""Traditional Takoyaki"" to a Mapo Tofu ""Frito Pie"" over a range of some 25-30 plates ranging small to large, it was following recommendations of ""three plates per person"" that exactly one-half of the day's dishes were requested, a nicely paced roll-out of 1-2 at a time occurring over the course of nearly two hours. 

Well priced and best portioned for groups of two or four thanks to plating, the grand total with tax and tip coming out to around $40 each on this particular night, it was with waters filled frequently that dinner began by way of flash-fried Udon covered in Sauce not dissimilar to that of a Big Mac, the flavors nostalgic for those who've not eaten at McDonald's in nearly two decades while the follow-up Sweetbread Katsu was marred by smaller Nuggets than those seen in pictures which largely muted the Offal, though the sliced Snow Pea salad and Asian Barbeque Sauce were quite nice. 

Continuously giving off a Momofuku circa-2007 vibe throughout the evening, the music a bit lower but the influences undeniable, it was as Bel Biv DeVoe played that all agreed one slice of the Crispy Tapioca was enough to get a sense of the dish and move on to better, the oily mouthfeel quickly replaced by Brussels Sprouts with sweet Sauce juxtaposing Pumpkin Seeds and crispy Basil a very novel and delicious spin on a dish that seems to be offered everywhere these days. 

Taking a briny turn for the only part of the meal served as a trio, two styles of Takoyaki and an Okonomiyaki served more like a Burger Patty-sized Fishcake highlighted by the Traditional Octopus Balls as the others simply came across as mushy and muddled by too many competing flavors, it was surprisingly in the ""Large Plates"" that Paid In Full really hit full stride, the take-out box of springy Noodles dazzling with Garlic mellowed by Cabbage and Mushrooms while the clever Mapo Tofu cast aside any sense of subtlety by way of minced Pork amidst the crispy Corn Chips and plenty of Sichuan Peppers beneath melted Cheddar Cheese. 

Strangely saving a small plate of fried Chicken for last, the flavor fine but Breading lacking any crunch to help differentiate it from Flesh, it was setting aside only one of three Sundaes that dinner concluded in four Desserts, the Vanilla Soft Serve taking well to both Blueberries and Graham Crackers as well as Bacon and Maple with lightly bitter Walnut Sauce while the finely blended Panna Cotta and Red Bean Cheese Toast each walked a tightrope between sweet and savory to good effect.

***Still fairly new at only six weeks in Paid In Full is the sort of place one wants to love for having the guts to be different, but based on just one meal the food thus far seems to lack consistency not only from dish to dish but from what is featured from photos early on to what was served on this particular night.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,8,5,3,xSdTVQHJoWDi91-fANH8gA

5428982,2017-12-07,0,_eDVVS8wwXcdllaW6nfLyg,"One thing about this restaurant is that it is very ambitious. Majority of items on the menu is a fusion or different style of preparing a dish. What we ordered:

Sweet Corn - On another level...this dish is fire with the bacon cubes and miso butter

Greens & Beans - This was something I did not want to order just cause I hate natto but the person I was with was persistent in ordering it. Everything about this was my worst nightmare because of the natto but for the natto lovers, you may love this dish. Of course they didn't like natto either after I warned them....

Karaage - What I grew up on.. no way you can fuck this up...so this was a solid dish however the sauce was a little funky and something that i would not dip the chicken in....

Curry Chicken Sando - Was expecting it to be more like a curry pan however it had more of a pickle and dill flavor which threw me off....chicken was done well but the overall flavor was not what I was expecting

Smoked Salmon Takoyaki - decided to order this cause of how unique the dish sounded only to be left confused and a little disappointed...again it had that dill pickled flavor that imo doesn't work well 

Foie Gras Okonomiyaki - Not your traditional okonomiyaki but more on the sweeter side....it tasted more like sweet cornbread mix than the usual savory cabbage heavy pancake mix. That being said the foie gras does balance it out with its savory and saltiness flavor however I felt like it was missing that traditional okonomiyaki sauce. Basically it felt like a reverse okonomiyaki with the flavor profiles being swapped and in my opinion I would take the original version in a heartbeat.

 As mentioned this restaurant is very ambitious in their menu and not afraid to be different which I respect. I ate here when it first opened up and understanding that it may take time to hash out and finalize their menu my score reflected that. Paid in Full is an excellent addition to the southwest side of Vegas and brings exciting new dishes to the dining scene in the city of Las Vegas.",aK_IdNCJUdk2haKC3GuM_Q,0,0,4,KXSDg044rLATu_zxoXKV2w

Even though the flavors were good with the escargot takoyaki...the texture of the exterior of the takoyaki was too soft.  Even before I bit into it I knew the texture would leave me disappointed by the color of the takoyaki.  We also ordered the crab croquettes which look a lot like mozarella sticks.  These were crunchy and tasty but perhaps small in regards to portion/price.  We also tried the kurobuta sausage corn dogs.  The sausage is always good but I was underwhelmed by the corn dog coating.  The clams with mushroom and unagi dumplings was probably our favorite dish.  Like some other reviews, I wish it came with bread to soak up the delicious sauce.  We also tried the Japanese fried chicken and unfortunately this was very one dimensional and just seemed salty compared to other karaage in town.  We finished with the maple bacon soft serve, it was topped with some sort of perhaps toffee crumble that was on point.

5529751,2017-10-09,72,_eDVVS8wwXcdllaW6nfLyg,"I'd been eagerly waiting for Paid in Full (PIF from here on out) to open since they popped up on IG.  So much so that I may have left a face print on the storefront glass a few weeks earlier.  The ambiance of the room, colorful decor and fun upbeat soundtrack definitely encourages to stay awhile, and we couldn't wait to start.

The well-presented ""Asparagus"" definitely kicked  dinner off right, hitting taste buds from multiple directions from the cool, creamy Japanese mayo blended with blue crab to the yuzu pepper and generous topping of ikura.  ""Clams"" were superb as well with unagi dumplings (think biscuit dough, not gyoza), mushrooms and some serious sake dashi broth that was dying for some bread or rice somewhere to soak up.       

Las Vegas finally has good okonomiyaki!!!!.  Having been on the bad end of more than a few attempts by businesses at this savory Japanese pancake over the years, ranging from horrendous to subpar; that wrong has finally been made right here.  This version was fancy, topped with uni, crispy fried squid and bonito flakes that had my tongue saying ""Fuckin finally!""  The menu changes daily and I saw that they offered foie gras on okonomiyaki the following day, which I will need (Require? Demand?  Wet my pants and cry until someone gives me one?) to have at some point.

No doubt there's always room for more spots to do takoyaki with few doing it and even fewer doing it well.  The traditional octopus was great, but a tad steep at 4 for $10.  The current LV kings of octopus balls at Monzo serve 7 of them for less than $8 total.  

PIF also offers some very interesting, never before seen by my four eyes, types like escargot, rosa salami and smoked salmon with dill cream, ikura and wasabi mayo.  We tried the latter, it was OK, and would rather have had another round of traditional in hindsight.  But kudos to R&D for even creating them!  Maybe corn dog or cheeseburger are in the future? 

Consider me a fan!  I'll like it even more once they get an alcohol license.  This is a unique spot in town and I look forward to trying more.",8DEyKVyplnOcSKx39vatbg,107,92,4,wUIf8RzoaMnPG1J5ph12Sw

The okonomiyaki was also disappointing. In Japan it's usually so large the need two spatulas to cook it. The one here was about the diameter of a fried egg, and was a little runny in the middle. The liver was good. Generally feel it was a high price compared to what it was.

Crispy brussels sprouts $6 -- i actually prefer this somewhere else so this was okay. but my sister actually preferred this one more. 

Triple garlic yakisoba $18 -- had a lot of veggies so it feels like there weren't enough noodles 

Traditional octopus takoyaki $10 -- definitely enjoyed this one and would get it again

2nd visit was a much yummier visit:
From their brunch menu, the popular pork belly & potato hash $12 -- this was extremely good. LOVE IT. the potatoes are the best part of this dish. 

Marinated mussels $6 -- better than expected. Nice surprise. 

Shrimp takoyaki $9 -- don't eat this as soon as it comes out. Hot. I prefer the traditional one over shrimp, though. Next visit will be trying their escargot takoyaki. 

I will be back, for sure.",7weuSPSSqYLUFga6IYP4pg,0,0,4,wtYNjH7KmnfQee9_0b3YTA
5740473,2018-03-07,0,_eDVVS8wwXcdllaW6nfLyg,"There's a lot I like about this restaurant: the presence of an underrepresented cuisine (Japanese street food), the service (friendly), and a diverse selection of food items.

Unfortunately, I can't really say I liked the food, at least the one larger item I got (a fried seafood dish), which felt too heavy for my taste. The fried tapioca was better, and a dish I'd recommend.

I think that if you're more of a fried food lover than I am, you'll probably enjoy this restaurant. So, chalk it up as a very positive three star review.",YE54kKTuqJJPNYWIKIpOEQ,1,0,3,IxUzULVWlOCsPCKihcZvag
5767743,2018-05-11,0,_eDVVS8wwXcdllaW6nfLyg,"Pleasantly surprised by this neighborhood eatery. The menu walks a delicate line between high concept Japanese fusion tapas and pop-culture, Insta-foodie heaven. There's something so endearing about 90's hip-hop beats, captain crunch encrusted desserts, and Mad Dog 20/20 mixed drinks. Our server recommended the takoyaki, which was certainly enjoyable. However, the star of the meal for me was the triple garlic yakisoba and the sweet anko and Camembert toast. The restaurant itself is beautiful but totally laid back and approachable. The staff are very knowledgeable and super friendly. Truly, I would really love for them to expand on their brunch menu a bit, but either way, I will certainly be back soon to taste more of the menu.",DUXU1JbDjkrDRD9eA4RfMQ,0,0,4,zuOD9zkgGhvZUgO1S4nNiA

5836816,2018-05-03,0,_eDVVS8wwXcdllaW6nfLyg,"I really wanted to like this place more, especially with the rave reviews!! However, every dish we tried lacked any subtle harmony of ingredients and was more of a fusion of gratuitous salt and heavy flavors than anything truly, or even remotely, Japanese. I would say it is Japanese inspired, given the names and concepts, but at its heart this is an American restaurant. 

Some things that stood out in particular. The seafood okonomiyaki does not actually go well with seafood. The uni topping on top, yes. It was fresh and creamy and perfect. However there is a reason okonomiyaki goes with pork and not octopus/squid. There is no fat or flavoring in seafood to offset or work the other ingredients traditional to okonomiyaki.  

The white anchovy takoyaki tried really hard to blend a lot of unique flavors together, and in the end the anchovy flavor was just too strong to work with any of them. 

There was a triple garlic pasta on the menu that used dried garlic instead of fresh or minced, so that was a little disappointing as well. I like my garlic strong and was hoping the emphasis on it would bring more of its flavor out. 

The best thing that we had was actually the soft serve dessert. All of them sounded unique and the one we got I was able to enjoy a lot. 

The service is also good. The waitress was attentive and informative. The kitchen is completely open so you can see them cooking and prepping. I noticed a big bag of green onions but not the worker washing them before prepping, though that might just be where I was sitting? Didn't taste or find anything wrong with those in our dishes, at least.",SgcNTpx_ASfvyQHmLU443A,0,0,2,Lxemwfz4IAeccqQryuh5JQ

But it didn't.  These guys are serving classic pub dishes like takoyaki and okonomiyaki.  In the wrong hands these dishes can be tragically bad, and they do them total justice and then some.  As good as any I've had in Japan, in fact all the food I had here was perfectly cooked and seasoned, totally exceeded my expectations.  Limited but well chosen sake list.  This is everything a neighborhood restaurant should be.",BJt5rHl8ETUsWZmdwJnS1g,2,1,5,38QCNmzCsFrurfcwDokngA
5902830,2018-06-10,4,_eDVVS8wwXcdllaW6nfLyg,"This place is fun. And I'm not just saying that because the cool hip-hop aesthetic. Paid in Full offers a revolving menu of Japanese tapas with surprising and unique flavor combinations. They even have a cheap beer roulette! Consider me swooned. 

As for the service, it is always friendly and attentive. I always try to order any new specials the server recommends, but my staples here are the clams with unagi dumplings and mushrooms plus the crispy brussel sprouts. If it ever leaves the menu, it will be a day of mourning for me. As for takoyaki recommendations, I've had the octopus, shrimp, and mushroom and mushroom is definitely my fave.

Overall, amazing addition to the neighborhood and delicious Japanese-fusion place to enjoy. And if Suzuya is closed by the time dessert rolls around, grab the sundae with balsamic blueberry sauce and sea salt graham cracker. It's like gourmet McDonald's soft-serve and a heavenly way to close out a meal.",ZIqkcApOQh8QfiydYSiLaQ,6,7,4,rPFKnoyM6JAmS28gFAJkPQ
5908572,2018-01-13,0,_eDVVS8wwXcdllaW6nfLyg,"I really really don't like giving negative reviews to new restaurants, but this was a huge disappointment for us and hopefully this will be taken as constructive criticism. The service was great, but the food is subpar. Almost everything is deep fried; nothing refreshing to balance the meal. We tried 5 dishes on the somewhat limited menu, and all but crab croquettes missed the mark. 

The crispy brussels sprouts were oily and not at all crispy. Liked the vinegarette dressing and pumpkin seeds, but overall too salty, soggy and not a successful dish. Similarly, the karaage chicken was not as crispy as it should be, and it too was way too salty. That goes for the yakisoba as well.  Very salty, it reminded me of overcooked oily stir fried instant ramen noodles. The pork belly in the yakisoba was tasty and well cooked, but did not redeem this overpriced $18 dish. The foie gras okonomiyaki was forgettable. Hadn't had foie in a while, so this was a treat, but the rest of the plate was disappointing.  We didn't even finish this.

The recurring theme here is salty, oily street food. Sorry for the negative review, but I grew up on asian street food and this was highly disappointing. I would recommend the restaurant serve steamed rice as a side option. Some of the dishes would perhaps have been more balanced and enjoyable with rice to cut the salt and oiliness. Or take it easy on the oil and salt.",zyMB50UtmEuQf-1VUKxZxQ,0,0,2,nYZrJMIwz3eNfKOQsm7ooQ
5960210,2018-04-08,6,_eDVVS8wwXcdllaW6nfLyg,"On the radar since it opened, I finally had the opportunity to visit this brain-child from the owners of Suzuya. 

Located on an up and coming food corner at Warm Springs and Durango, I'm so happy to have tried this place with equally open-minded food lovers / friends. Narrowing down what we wanted to try was hard but we finally settled on a number of dishes for the table and eagerly awaited the onslaught.

The food pacing was on point, giving us enough time to take the obligatory photos and savor each dish without having to rush to the next, we enjoyed a majority of the creative dishes. 

The menu takes many chances, most of which we enjoyed and it's ever-evolving which gives diners the opportunity to have an entirely different experience on each visit. I cannot wait to return to try more of their offerings.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,14,13,4,vQO2AdP9e8kwnOFfmFg3wQ
5995082,2018-03-31,0,_eDVVS8wwXcdllaW6nfLyg,"This place was great as far as out of the ordinary goes. The chef has a pretty good imagination and his creations are one of a kind. The plates are small, tapas style, and a bit pricy, but overall the presentation is good. I was not crazy about their seating, as the chairs are those older metal high stools, and there were no high chairs for the baby. For a relaxing and well presented plate, I would hope for better seating arrangements. It seems that this restaurant has a bit of an identity crisis by serving fusion tapas, 90's music and decor, surfer taco shop seating, and located in a very hidden corner of a strip mall shadowed by the Sonic drive inn. I definitely recommend this place for the experience and to try something new, but keep all those other points in mind.",n3oInek8quP4GnbI_KN2mg,0,0,3,GVWWMntfGU5hvUfyBQ02zQ
