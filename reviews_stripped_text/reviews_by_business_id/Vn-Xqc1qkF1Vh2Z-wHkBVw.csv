1372735,2017-11-29,0,Vn-Xqc1qkF1Vh2Z-wHkBVw,"By far one of my favorite places to stop in and get a torta (sandwich). I always get the Cuban torta and have never been disappointed and the food is always consistent regardless of who makes it. My second go to item is the bacon cheese hot dog, which is extremely good and they use all beef hot dogs which make it that much better. 

The shop is a bit small with a few tables so it can fill up rather quickly but the staff here is very nice to deal with and have never had bad customer even as they have been busy with to go orders and customers inside. Bagels and Subs is definitely worth a stop for a great lunch!",c5tvQ7RYTYd8BQ1VMqVqNw,0,1,5,UsOcVJTuNuitKwd4ee9DWg

1898792,2015-05-30,1,Vn-Xqc1qkF1Vh2Z-wHkBVw,Yeah. It was ok. The lady was nice. I thought there was going to be more of a smoothie type option but not really. Got two breakfast sandwiches.  I mostly won't be going back anytime soon.,gjDLwBnfwxo9SVwxm4gt1A,0,0,3,vrl-Rkb30xYBB6yIOmBt2Q
1913984,2016-07-20,0,Vn-Xqc1qkF1Vh2Z-wHkBVw,Had a great pastrami sandwich. I couldn't believe how cheap it was (I even asked the girl working if she had charged me for everything to make sure). The food was all fresh and tasted great. Glad I stumbled across the place.,HwmeT0Rq9OI4ox04WlNdAg,1,0,5,tHDfavteyIYjWm9OSbCSqQ

It feels like you're sitting in your favorite aunt's new restaurant who needs help getting the place to take off.  The young lady who helped me was very friendly and accommodating when I asked for recommendations.  The Torta Loca and the chocolate and banana milkshake were delicious, but even more than that, this place had a vibe of a local favorite sandwich stop, which you had to kind of be a local to understand.  I'll definitely be back.",VBQZu1KXdzB8zW9wrsWANA,0,1,5,irW30l7eR9qa_qmu_71rgA
2146609,2014-05-20,0,Vn-Xqc1qkF1Vh2Z-wHkBVw,"Overall I really love this joint. Their subs are delicious, their bagels are delicious, their bagel sandwiches are delicious, and they are fairly priced. The owner is typically always there keeping a watchful eye and restocking their fridge. They make the food right in front of you, no secret kitchen hidden behind some wall. All fresh and all made the way you like it!",Fkkphmuug_cU0SOpEwoE9Q,2,0,5,09QtwP1st28LHGnzZArVoA
3093287,2016-10-10,0,Vn-Xqc1qkF1Vh2Z-wHkBVw,One of the only places I know I can find a really good Cuban sandwich. Just absolutely great food.

I saw Hugo's review and decided to try the place out, and it was amazing. 

I love breakfast bagels and this was one of the best I have had. The bagel was soft and the eggs were cooked with pepper, the sausage and cheese topped it off.  15 min we were in and out feeling good about the rest of the day.",vJ-pvHVyExpV_SF9Vd-i0Q,4,1,5,eAKHtHSihNmqvbTEYpYq0w
3191489,2018-03-14,0,Vn-Xqc1qkF1Vh2Z-wHkBVw,"What a hidden treasure! On the corner of Sahara and Lamb, it's a tiny place but the sandwiches are amazing! I got the grilled chicken sub, which comes with chipotle sauce and jalapeños, as well as normal sandwich toppings.  I expected to have to pick some of the jalapeños off, but nope. She made a perfect sandwich! All the flavors worked and the bread was so fresh and perfectly grilled. I ate an entire 12"" sandwich. We will definitely be back!",tGj4u-HdpWGgI9YF_dpZqQ,0,0,5,EybUb4s-IloO6vcpvjs2qQ

I had the mango smoothie and tostilocos,which was interesting but yummy. I definitely  want to go back there before I move from the east side.

I ordered a wrap which had chicken, bacon, tomatoes, cucumbers, avocado and lettuce and let me tell you everything was soooooo fresh! It was amazing i literally haven't had any fast food that has every tasted so fresh. This place is definitely worth checking out. My only complaint is the soda machine everything was out of order luckily they did have a fully stocked fridge.",3TQ5BGkGc8imRhnC06KNFQ,0,1,4,9Rk9VMAe7e4sPg64ouj1Xg

I ordered an onion bagel with cream cheese with a coffee and my husband ordered an egg, ham and cheese croissant sandwich. It all came to about $6.00. The coffee was fresh and so was the bagel. My husband really liked his sandwich and he is very picky. I liked that it was quiet and we could chill and enjoy our Sunday morning. I'd like to go back and try some of their other drinks and sandwiches.",gQDLi67PvBxEWsQYAcyMsw,1,0,5,jl3o1gEcMc37Sipqyv4BCQ

The strawberry shake tasted like milk. And he offered to remake it and though I told him no, he remade it anyways. But it still had very little taste at all. But I will give him an ""A""  for his customer service. All in all, not bad, and reasonably priced.",5G-Qua-1NywCbHWskRtiUw,2,1,4,9glq5ctY0FHAv_-Dt0VT2Q
