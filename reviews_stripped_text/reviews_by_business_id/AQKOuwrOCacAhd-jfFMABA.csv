As for ambiance...how about dust covered plastic grapes hanging from the ceiling, and a fat guy (Carmine himself) sitting at the front table talking loud.  It was like a scene from one of those restaurant renovation shows.  Don't bother.",ZdUFyF5eNyZxete-T4bmZA,0,0,2,nXuytABFpSv8pL3p1Hrs1g
128949,2013-11-26,1,AQKOuwrOCacAhd-jfFMABA,"Will NEVER go there again! The only reason we traveled half way across town to check this place out was because i got a good deal through Groupon and wanted to try the food. Bad idea! Me and my daughter went there for lunch on a Monday afternoon. We were the ONLY ones in the whole place (now I know why!).  When we walked in the place was nothing special and no one greeted us or sat us at a table.  We waited for what seemed like 5 minutes before some guy came out from the kitchen and reluctantly took our order.  We asked him about the lunch special that was clearly posted on the outside window but he had no idea what it included.  

We should've just left then, but I wanted to use the Groupon that I purchased and would probably not be on this side of town any time soon.  After he took our order, we sat ourselves down and about 5 minutes or so went by before a waitress came out to ask if we needed anything.  She brought us drinks and never came back until the food was done.  Both the appetizer and the main dish were both greasy and bland.  The food was definitely not anything to return for.  We waited and waited for refills on our drinks but the waitress never returned and we had to go get the attention of someone out of the kitchen to get our drinks refilled. 

I didn't think things could get worse, but once the bill came they did!  I showed the waitress the Groupon voucher on my phone (like I have been doing at numerous establishments for the past two years) and she had no idea what I was trying to show her.  She immediately got rude with me and asked me ""who sent that to you??"". I tried to explain how Groupon works, since she obviously lives under a rock, but she just acted like I was being ridiculous and giving her some kind of ""fake"" coupon.  When I finally made her understand that my phone was the actual voucher, she was even more rude than before.  Her exact words were ""what am i supposed to do with that?! How am i supposed to scan it??? THIS ISN'T A GROCERY STORE!!"" Wooooow! I couldn't believe my ears. How could she talk to me like that just because SHE didn't know what to do?? Is it my fault she lives in the stone ages and has no clue how to get a coupon off of my phone?!? She just kept telling me that ""they don't use that company any more"" and ""I don't think we can take that"".  She refused to even deal with me and my stupid phone coupon.  I had to pay the entire bill and was unable to use my Groupon.  

The service was horrible even before I presented the coupon and it got 10 times worse after, I would not recommend this place to anyone! I will contact Groupon tomorrow and get my money back (because THEY have great customer service!) and I WILL NOT BE STEPPING FOOT IN CARMINES EVER AGAIN!",Ih5VQu-GpZ3ldm1PEeY0UQ,1,0,1,K2rcxCKv4gn7_0xDG6rI4g

(obviously when I lived somewhere else) the fact that I had to call, only to find out that they wouldn't deliver to me.. I was livid. get it together cause ur losing business.

oh and my order was wrong. correct on the ticket but not in the box. nice.

1732829,2010-06-30,2,AQKOuwrOCacAhd-jfFMABA,"My friend and I stopped in here on a fluke; we wanted to eat somewhere we hadn't before and we usually tend to go for Italian anytime, anywhere. We came upon Carmine's and decided to go in.

It was kind of a mess from the start. The boss's daughter (who looked to be about 8 or 9 years old and was wearing a Justin Bieber t-shirt) got our drink orders. That struck both of us in an odd and uncomfortable way, you know, with child labor laws and all.

My friend ordered a water and it came with a lemon in it; he told them could he have a water without lemon in it and the girl just took it back, took the lemon out, and served it right back to him. Come on, we're not stupid, we can taste if there's been a lemon in the water.

The plain cheese pizza we ordered took a good 20 minutes to come out to us, and I'm not gonna lie, it was pretty ""meh"". The cheese was falling off in clumps. We only ordered the cheese pizza 'cause the prices were definitely outrageous. The 18"" pizza we got was $14. We definitely wanted toppings and all but each additional topping was $2...so cheese pizza it was.

Service was kind of slow, which is bad, considering there were only 3 other people in the restaurant.

I wouldn't exactly recommend this place to anyone; Carmine's Little Italy on the West side of town has a better atmosphere and better service (the prices are somewhat similar, however).",YO61spDXCql3rjQFK0Xhlw,6,1,2,lEhbc9ovhqrzfzDlI0J9lA
1881001,2012-01-08,3,AQKOuwrOCacAhd-jfFMABA,"Yikes and meh are the two words that come to mind when thinking about this place. I know that might not make much sense, allow me to elaborate. 

I'll start with meh. The taste. Very meh. The pizza was a bit bland. We only ordered a cheese and pepperoni as it was costly to get it piled with ingredients otherwise. Besides, we were trying this place out and needed to know if they can get the basics right first. It wasn't bad, but not fantastic either. Nothing I would return for. 

The dining area was average. I liked The vineyard look to it. It was a little odd how it appeared half ""date worthy "" restaurant and half sports bar if you catch my drift. Something wasn't adding up. We were almost alone. There was another patron eating a slice. Why so lonely on a weekend? Oh wait......there was one more visitor......that's where the ""yikes "" enters  this story.

ROACH!!!!!! Yes. I said it. I even screamed it while I was eating! This bug was walking up the wall right beside me just as we were finishing our food. I know, I know. Bugs are a natural part of this world and most if not all restaurants battle insect intruders constantly. However, an establishment that is kept clean shouldn't have roaches crawling up the walls next to patrons trying to enjoy an over priced bland meal! We ran out the door after that, never to return.",vgw9YgtImROsCUgveRSL7Q,0,0,1,Dz1Ee6-3-GcbJmZxRhtUpQ
1911504,2010-05-26,0,AQKOuwrOCacAhd-jfFMABA,"Okay ... So I was slightly thrilled when I found their delivery menu jammed into my door. Oh boy! Another restaurant that will bring food and beverages to my little dwelling, sparing me the annoyance of cooking. Well, I had the opportunity to try them out last night. 

... Meh. 

I gave them one star for the lovely Veronica who answered the phone, spoke perfect ENGLISH, and took my order with friendly efficiency. That was truly a delightful surprise! 

The second star is for the very FAST DELIVERY time ... Under 30 minutes, despite the fact that the driver had trouble finding me. 

The lack of any other stars reflects on the wildly overpriced lasagna ($14), which arrived barely luke warm and with no accompaniments other than 2 short, doughy, greasy bread-sticks. No salad, no soup ... nuthin'. REALLY? $14 for a single serving of bland pasta filled with meat and a little cheese and hardly any sauce?! 

What really annoyed me, was that I had to actually heat the lasagna in a 350 degrees oven for 1/2 hour to get it to a point where it was slightly hot around the edges, but still only warm in the center. Grrrr .... Turning on the oven pretty much negates any benefit of getting food delivered, so I was NOT PLEASED. I felt like I did half their work for them. It was as if they had thawed out a pan of frozen lasagna, stuck it under a heat lamp and waited for the orders to pour in. FYI guys ... Pouring 1/2 cup of hot marinara on a 5-inch slab of room temp lasagna will NOT heat it through. 

Lesson learned: When ordering from a place with ""pizza"" in their name, stick to the pizza!",k8CwFA5FbQ24kbmSR7u-eA,3,1,2,W7TLLOCel9x9Z-B21wzJ-w

The owner of Paint & Party picked the restaurant for us, and I was pleased.  We had the space that we needed to do our thing and have some privacy, and the food was pretty good.  3 of us split a large Carmine's Special Pizza, which was perfect for lunch.

After waiting patiently for over an hour, I gave them a call and was told the driver was 2 minutes away.  20 minutes later, I called them to complain.

3400188,2013-10-16,6,AQKOuwrOCacAhd-jfFMABA,"We are among the OG's who used to eat here when it was Villa Pizza. The kids and my childlike brother always loved the sweet tangy sauce. ( In later years, my brother made a discovery of empty cans of Campbell's tomato soup in their trash. Coincidentally, this was always my mother's ""secret ingredient"" in spaghetti sauce. My mother was not even one smidge Italian. She was a white girl from Idaho.)

Don't worry about what my brother was doing in their trash.

Anyway, Babygirl and I were jonesing for pizza to go with our evening of the ""Walking Dead"" (eat first, view later!), and she decided it had to be the glorious pie of her childhood memories. 

 We picked up so I can't comment on the delivery, but all went well with our order. A large cheese is about $14, which isn't too bad. The pizza did taste pretty much the same as before, which is 4 stars from her and 3 from me. The thin crust is nice and chewy and had a decent char. The chicken wings were nice and meaty but a little tough, but they do have great ranch dip- nice and garlicky. They were at a steady 3 stars until we tried the meatball sub.

 Yuck! Meatballs should be moist and tender- these went past that and deep into mushy. Tasted like more filler than meat. I think they used that recipe from the poor relative's barbeque in ""National Lampoon's Vacation"".  Gave most of it to the very surprised dog, who never gets anything. 
He ate it, but last night he was eating a rat, so I wouldn't depend on his opinion.",-qj9ouN0bzMXz1vfEslG-A,3,3,2,8qLu-Bn54JfPOpjUNwhhTg
3433986,2013-03-31,0,AQKOuwrOCacAhd-jfFMABA,"The pizza is sub-par at best. Garlic bread was okay, but they use garlic powder instead of garlic. And, for a Saturday at 7 pm, it was dead!",OOqCI5ODiiLwWh-6wNchdQ,0,0,2,t8vxAWWRwLIN4RYMndkNXQ
3525180,2014-01-20,0,AQKOuwrOCacAhd-jfFMABA,"Gotta give it a 4 since the pizza is pretty good, not the best, but the best you will find on East Sahara.  

I have never dined in, and probably never will because the place always seems a little dead and the waitress/cashier/hostess/manger person is always having a spat with the cook.  I have picked up from here many times, there is always a different person running the show are that individual has never been very personable.

They do not deliver, so dine-in and carry-out are your only options.  Definitely call ahead and time your drive to arrive at the restaurant after your pizza is ready. Get your pizza and get out! That is my advice.

The pizza has been consistently good.  You won't be disappointed with the pie.",IJL--65w5S4Pj-iSY3njJw,0,0,4,XM-FP-n34j7NV8D0U9GGuA
4259352,2010-07-03,0,AQKOuwrOCacAhd-jfFMABA,"It's back to basics for the original owners of Villa Pizza. This location was originally Villa Pizza- home of the New York style cheese pizza. Like my husband, I ate here many years ago, my college years- the calzones and pizza were the best things on the menu. My husband liked it so much that his bachelor party started here for dinner. Years later,  it was sold and renamed Amalfi Pizza, claiming the same ownership, which wasn't true. The pizza recipe had changed- too much of a spice in the pizza sauce. Fast forward a few years, a buyback, a complete makeover inside ( think italian vineyard), and back to the original owners. 

It was amazing inside, considering it was a sports bar before- it was a nice surprise. We had dinner there with my father in law and his wife (who know the owners, by the way). We had the cheese pizza (delicious), and a dinner salad. The cheese pizza was just as how Villa Pizza made it (the original new york style cheese pizza). Carmine and his son (who also manages the other restaurant locations as well) said Hello, which was nice. This family owned and operated (open 7 days a week) place has: appetizers, salads, pizza, calzones, pasta, hot & cold subs, pizza by the slice (cheese @ $2.25 ea), and catering is available.

Coupons were mailed out to those who live in the area. Special on Sunday, Monday, & Tuesday: Large Cheese Pizza for $9.95, 5 pm- 9 pm dine in only.",fiGqQ7pIGKyZ9G0RqWLMpg,2,1,4,i_8JDNQAp9lF_I5SBDy_aA

4686884,2012-07-13,1,AQKOuwrOCacAhd-jfFMABA,"Another visit, another Stromboli, dropped one topping choice, added 2, ordered an ice tea and left a reasonable tip and I dang near dropped $20 on this place. WTF was I thinking? Trying to rationalize my stupidity I'll say this is the price I pay for convenience as it is close to work and with a short lunch hour you do what you have to do. But all that money got spent and for what? Boring food. In 3 hours I will have forgotten about what I had for lunch. 

And since I'm in whine mode let's roll with it. I don't mind a place making money but $3 for iced tea is what I'd pay for a bottle at Kauffman Stadium back in Kansas City and we all know stadium pricing is ridiculous. As for the vaunted crust, the same stuff is used to make the Stromboli and it's not all that. And the pizza sauce if you like to taste tomatoes is ok, but it really needs some spices....

The bottom line: I need to go exploring other places to eat and kick myself out of food ruts like crappy strombolis. And who in the heck puts salami in a stromboli? Bleech. That's what I subbed out, give me my black olives and tomatoes, keep the pepperoni and mozzarella. At least the server working today was smiling and was running her rear end off, and the LVMPD gang unit came in which was interesting. But as I said by 3 pm if someone asked what I had for lunch today I'd have to think about it...as it really was unmemorable.",HEvyblFw4I-UsMqgPGYY_Q,1,0,2,59b51jtt6Cs5dFuDyoUo-g

There is an awesome lunch special for two slices and a drink for like $5.00. The menu had variety and they make a sandwich with pizza dough/crust in lieu of bread. I will give it another shot, but next time I will sit in a different section.",gOvUaiujBlICb8woURn-cg,1,0,3,sh_Wa8CVDsnKkMBwUF46Tw
