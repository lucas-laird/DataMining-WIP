The white pizza with our additions of pesto, ricotta and an Italian salami was so delicious. The staff was very helpful with guiding us to what we should put on our pizza. The ingredients were very fresh. The establishment was super clean. Our food came out promptly while we were just finishing paying. I would come back again and again!! The pizza was amazing.

All other restaurants around the area were too crowded so we decided to try Novecento again. Big mistake. Not only are pizzas small, but salads are smaller now, too. Place seemed dark and dirty . It used to be so much better. Won't go back. Will go to Metro for better quality food at better prices.

I've learned that you can always count on the ingredients to be some of the very best.  It's been the case in every place he's opened...and it's consistent at Novecento.  We had a great pizza (although the style is different than most and that takes a little getting used to, but just a little 'cause it's so good).  and our salad was excellent as well...again, great ingredients.
I wouldhave probably given it four and a half stars, except the staff was just kind of distant.  don't get me wrong, I hate overy friendly waitstaff...but I also don't like standing face to face with the kid who's making my pizza and being made to feel like I'm invisible while he chats with his co-workers, only to occasionally look up and say to me ""basil?""  It was the case all the way down the line, including the cashier, who half way through our transaction just wandered away for a few seconds.  Even with a 900 degree oven behind them, it wasn't the warmest atmosphere.  Again, I don't expect to be entertained, but how about a little chatter with the clinetelle...maybe a discussion of the different style of pizza...or at least an acknowledgment that we're standing there watching.
I offer this suggestion only because I want to go back, and will...and hope that next visit the atmosphere and service match the excellent food.",ZdUFyF5eNyZxete-T4bmZA,0,0,3,XUGg4wTRvaPQrxRihmeWtg

Then Marc explained  to me why its cooked this way and how to eat it.  It brought me back to Italy.  DELISH!!  So anyone who's been to Parma knows that Chef Marc is the real deal.

93606,2013-08-19,0,0InA3Ffj8MxyQV9hgsyYcQ,"D- And that is charitable.  It took 20 minutes standing in line to order 2 pies and a salad.  We understood their recommendation of limiting the number of topping so we ordered their house specialties---Bianco and Margherita pizza and their house special Antipasto.  Antipasto was a combination of pizza toppings including 1/8 inch diced ham on a bed of undressed lettuce.  It was so poor we left 80% of the salad and had no desire to take it home with us.  We thought it was our fault for ordering antipasto at a pizzeria.
Pizza was finally ready after another 20 minutes and the Bianco was ok, middle of the pie slightly underdone but edible.  The Margherita was raw and the crust was black, not from being overcooked but from being cooked in a filthy oven.  We nicely asked for a remake (actually saw 3 pies returned while we were there) and waited another 20 minutes only to find they had not even started our order. We actually saw the owner (or owners wife) chatting to guests while the dining room was littered with dirty tables and the kitchen seemed a disaster.  Then she just left---Las Vegas restaurant management at its finest.  We asked for a refund on the Margherita and followed her out the door.

The pizza was a bit funky...there was something off about the flavor and it lacked that gooey pizza feeling.  Authentic Italian or Americanized...pizza should be gooey! It was also greasy...

281775,2013-03-01,5,0InA3Ffj8MxyQV9hgsyYcQ,"Who: The woman and myself on a lunch date.
What: Margherita and Bianco (gorgonzola, onions, arugula) pizza, and Gelato
Where: About a 25 minute drive from Henderson
When: 11:20 AM 
Why: Because they made exactly what a pizza purist wants. A tasty balanced pie, at a fair price. At Settebello I'll gladly pay 12 bucks for a Margherita. But, Novecento, cuts that bill in half when you factor in not having to tip your server. I applaud the effort of Chef Marc, bringing the people's food to the people. Keep if fast and affordable. Some iteration of this concept in every local neighborhood,would be preferable to the garbage put out by Big Pizza. The young lady cashier was also a delight, pleasant and quick. So come here if you know what Neapolitan pizza is, if you can spell Margherita, if you're hungry.

Cons so minute they don't affect my enjoyment of the experience are as follows:
Pepsi products. Pepsi tastes like Mexican dirt water. Both Coke and Pepsi are going to kill you, but the reason Coke costs more is because it tastes better. I had a water cup, but if I want liquid diabetes another visit I'd prefer a Coke. The ordering system might not be completely refined yet but that will be worked out in the long run. 

To the guy that thinks a scoop of gelato is expensive at three dollars, just stick with dollar menu soft serves.",7kFAZQwmi3037lhIcVH3ig,1,0,5,N5ejfAkt2X46SAgcz5flDA

We specialize in wet doug or soft dough pizza from naples italy, i trained at Da Michele pizzeria that was in the Julia Roberts movie eat, love, ?????
Anyway we do it exactly like in Italy.
The poor guy at the mentioned pizzeria in Henderson told me everyone complained the same as you when he opened but he had to start cutting pizzas and telling everybody about the dough.
Glad you like his pizza nice guy, we are trying to do something different in nw and do it for low low prices.
Do oeople really have to get on yelp and talk negatively about a young business that is trying so hard. Really! Do you feel good about trying to cut down a lical tax paying farm to table place tbat employs the sons and daughters of your neigjbors.
See the video on YouTube Da Michele pizzeria AND YOU WILL KNOW WHAT WE ARE DOING.
And no pizzeria lets you tell them extra wet cheese and then complaints its soggy??

306461,2013-10-02,1,0InA3Ffj8MxyQV9hgsyYcQ,"It's usually a good sign when you're composing your review three bites in. Amazing pizza, and we were blown away by the fact that it's done in 90 seconds. They even had really good-quality ricotta, which is the one cow cheese I can eat (made with whey, so there's no casein).

The main issue we had, that the middle of the pizza was too weak to hold the toppings, turned out to be a problem of ignorance: apparently this style of pizza is supposed to be eaten with a fork and knife.

While the ricotta was amazing, I did think it got too rich after a couple of pieces and it would have been better overall if they used a little less. But if we lived in Vegas, I'd be happy to go back every week and experiment until it was perfect.

Oh and - we also thought the place was pretty cute, really good style for a pizzeria.",QiinwqBVgyIC1eG46MRjhA,0,0,5,QCSgSAIdKdyo4TSggWlS8Q

The only down side is a that I've see that they deliver on a couple of ads - they don't. So that's the down side for me when the restaurant is backed up with a line out the door. Other than that I think it's great to have a ""real"" pizza option!",do3gaLL0cWN5IhtcNQy3Dw,0,0,4,8DSVCnSzWuF05hWPBt66ZQ

It was delicious and you can eat a whole pizza yoursself. There are lots of toppings to choose from if you like alot of stuff on your pizza. They have beer and wine and soft drinks.

You came here to get neapolitan pizza. Enjoy it!

I disagree with reviewers who say the menu is complicated- I think it's actually really simple. I pair my arugula pizza with the house white or a Peroni on tap for a red sauce pizza. Ignore everything that's not a pizza or drink. Simple options, fast service, and terrible, loud, corny Italian easy-listening make this a classier, but super casual, lunch spot for me.

One complaint (besides the music): every time I come, I get excited to order a whole wheat crust, and every time I come, they tell me ""sorry we ran out."" Girl, I KNOW you didn't run out.

The other day, I decided that was just stupid, and I should start trying other Pizzerias until I find some good ones.  Novecento was a good choice.  I went in to order & pickup, since I had never been before.  They hand roll-out the crust in front of you, then you choose your sauce and toppings, while they make that in front of you as well.  (Kind of like Chipotle or Café Rio, except Pizza.)  

Since they use a super-hot pizza oven, the pizza bakes in about 90 seconds!  So there was hardly any wait time at all. 

The pizzas were very tasty.  I ordered a pepperoni and then I also ordered a pesto pizza.  The pepperoni was fine, but the pesto pizza was the star - really delicious!!  I would order that again for sure.  This location is in Centennial - so if you live anywhere near by, I would definitely recommend you give Novecento a try.  I bet it would be fun for kids to pick their toppings and watch their pizza in the pizza oven.  Plenty of seating and a big tv.

Only possible downside is the choice of just 2 sizes:  a very small 6"" size, like a personal pizza, and a larger 10"" pizza, which is the same size as a small at most other chains.

I had been craving the chopped salad and finally decided I was going to get it tonight for dinner. I wanted to call it in and order so that I could just run in and pick it up. I called about 6 times before going into the restaurant to try and order. No one answered the phone, and then I got hung up on twice as well. The restaurant closes at 10pm, and I called at 9pm. I figured they must have been busy and was giving them the benefit of the doubt.
When I finally got to Novecento there was only one person in line... Not sure why my calls weren't answered. I decided to try and call the restaurant while I was standing in line to see if the phone would ring. Of course it did...then all three girls that were working looked at the phone and silenced it. I tried again... Same thing! While I was standing there in line I watched them ignore my calls! What kind of business is that? It's not like anything at the restaurant even takes that long to make! Well... For their staff I guess it does because they have no care for their jobs and work as slow as possible. FINALLY one of the girls acknowledged that I was there after standing in line for 15 minutes. The staff is unfriendly.. Bottom line.
The service I received was horrible. The chopped salad doesn't have the same dressing as it used to either. Now it's plain red wine vinaigrette... Before it was a bright pink vinaigrette and so much more flavorful.

Fantastic fresh ingredients and some of the best pizza ever. A must for all pizza lovers.

After several visits I think they could benefit greatly from tightening up and revamping the ordering process.

The order flow should be patterned like normal counter service: The first person a customer encounters should be an order taker. Move the cashier from the end of the line to the beginning to take orders. Orders should be passed on as order tickets to the kitchen staff, where they can quickly prepare an order without the long ""what do you want on your pizza"" customer interview process.  Having orders in writing/in print saves time, and eliminates confusion, omissions, and forcing the customer to repeat orders over and over. 

By moving the cash register, all the pizza assembly can be moved closer to the oven which reduces the time it takes the pizza cooks to walk all the way from one end of the kitchen area to the other.

Whatever can be done to speed up the process would help the lines, because I do see people leave who don't want to wait.

Always a great meal, and enjoyed best fresh from the oven. This was an updated review, and I didn't realize my previous first review detailing all the food would be deleted. grrr.",GhKNo6inyAjpeO_HZFe3Wg,1,0,5,jHPHE88Gx3IEMCv0KJZ1GQ

For what it is, this is very good pizza, especially given how difficult it must be to find authentic ingredients in the US. For Las Vegas (I've never been impressed with the food here), it's GREAT pizza. So go, enjoy, just don't expect 100% authenticity... and don't read any further. Try the tiramisu for dessert. This is all 99.9% of you need to know. 

If you wanted to pick it apart... the bufala mozzarella isn't true bufalina mozzarella. The taste won't be nearly as strong as the real thing. Secondly, I'm not exactly sure what's up with the crust under the toppings, but perhaps the oven is too hot. The dough has a great flavor & texture in the areas where is was cooked, but under the toppings the crust on my pizza came out a bit doughy. Oh, & no, I didn't deviate from the Naples (the closest thing available on their menu to an authentic Margherita) by anything other than adding black olives, so this wasn't due to too many toppings. I recommend the spicy sauce. Otherwise, it's pretty good... the best pizza I've had in Las Vegas. Enjoy.",ASK3WfL6xHrPwl7xkZL0gA,1,0,5,lBK1Hxnnxv4vPjiZxLmXCw

Ordered a Large chopped salad with no bell peppers. Guess what? There were bell peppers. Last week I ordered a small chopped salad and it was the same exact size as the Large. Rip off!

Also ordered the Eggplant Parm-Very discouraging to see the eggplant being taken out of the refrigerator and being pre-cooked. I guess this place doesn't encourage fresh ingredients. Everything is pre-cooked. Including the red gravy. It gets warmed up on a hot plate.

Ordered a 7' and 10'. The 7' needed to be redone because after being cooked it had a huge hole in the middle. The 10' was very soggy and not crispy at all.

No gorgonzola cheese. A main ingredient, how can you be out of that?

There was 1 person in front of me and 1 person behind me. The person in front of me and myself were both not offerred any of the specials. But, the person behind me was and his bill was only $27  for 4 kids and 2 adults with 4 drinks.  I had 1 adult and 2 kids and no drinks-$37.

Went to the Parma awhile back-owned by Chef Marc as well. Ended up leaving after 55 minutes with no food. The eggplant parm at Parma is the exact same size and thing as Novecento but, cost is triple the amount.

Really, it is the same concept, you pick your crust, add your toppings and they cook the pizza in 90 seconds. I am a BIG fan of the white pizza and margarita. 

I gave it four stars beacuse it is very self-serve, but that also saves you from potential bad service. I've always been satisfied with the service.

First off the restaurant is very pleasent, clean and open. The staff is great, friendly and efficient. The pizza and toppings all are promising- delicious crust, wonderful toppings and expertly baked. But the red sauce was almost inedible- it tasted like oregano extract. Now I enjoy oregano and even grow it in my garden but it's a potent herb and a little goes a long way. This sauce was over seasoned with oregano to the point that it overwhelmed the other components of the pizza. I have had pizza allover America and Italy- even in Napoli, and trust me I know when someting is off. 

I hope this was just an off-batch and not the norm. Everything else Novecento has going for it will bring me back to give it another try (after a week or two to avoid that terrible batch of sauce) and hopefuly I can change my review and give it more stars.",bvRKei65HXKCzQCqiHTasQ,1,0,3,BeZ4OMyESb6SLyArEXgH9g

This place has the best ricotta I have ever tasted. It was perfectly creamy and light, like a ricotta-flavored cloud. I could eat it by the spoonful. 

For apps we tried the arugula salad, meatballs, and burrata. Burrata cheese is my favorite cheese, so I was very excited to try it. It was good, however, was served cold and I would have preferred it to be closer to room temperature. Burrata is an oozy, gooey cheese, so the colder it is, the less it oozes. Didn't stop me from enjoying it though! The arugula salad was very delicious; great blend of flavors, good portion, perfectly dressed. If I actually had to pick only one appetizer from the three we ordered, I'd probably order that again. The meatballs were also very good, but I wouldn't say memorable. 

For pizza we enjoyed the Roma, Smoked Salmon, and made our own with Margherita sauce, ricotta and sundried tomatoes. All were good - the Roma was more popular at the table, and I'm guessing it is because it tastes more ""traditional"" in terms of what you think of when you think pizza (i.e. tomato sauce). I enjoyed the smoked salmon pizza very much, but it definitely is more for individuals who are seeking out that type of flavor. The best pizza we had all night was our build-your-own pizza, and again - the ricotta stole the show. It was DELICIOUS. Omg I'm drooling just thinking of it. 

Pizza was cooked perfectly - they advertise 90 seconds, and that is true, however because they only put a few pizzas in the oven at once, of course it takes longer than just 2 minutes to get your pie. That's fine. It doesn't take any longer than 5 minutes. Crust had great flavor and was nice and chewy and had those yummy crust bubbles that are so fun to eat. 

Afterwards we enjoyed some gelato. I haven't eaten enough gelato in my life to know what constitutes good gelato, but the gelato tasted great to me. They will let you try a taste of any flavor before you settle on which one to actually get. Prices are reasonable for both pizza and desserts, and it is a fun place to go eat overall because of the style of the restaurant. It is Subway-like in the way that you order your pizza and choose the toppings, and it is neat to be able to watch it cooking away in their wood-burning stone oven. 

I'll definitely be back here. Tastes authentic and delicious, and its a fun place for a casual date or a family dinner. And if you only take one thing from this review, it should be: GET THE RICOTTA!!!! =)",sLPgR6Z6Xe8tg3y2cUi2RQ,0,0,5,v3DdCuOS6PgFJ6RCBmmkbw

I love Neapolitan pizza because of the freshness of the toppings. They do a pretty damn good job here in the customer service is very good. The only  thing that is weird here, is that the staff changes here constantly. I swear every couple weeks when I come in there's a brand-new stuff for people with maybe one or two people who have been here for a few months.

Take the pizza and toss in a small salad and it would make for a GRRREAT dinner for two. I went with the Chef Marc and I gotta say it was a tasty combination of flavors. Service wise most of the action takes place behind the counter, which explains the short wait times on orders. The staff actually seemed to like what they were doing, which shows in the quality of the end product. They do offer beer on draft as well as bottled, wine and of course soda (self serve). I always ask myself would I feel good about recommending a place to friends and family, and I have to say heck yeah I'd definitely recommend this place.

My all-time favorite type of pizza is wood-fired and it's hard to find that type of style here in Vegas.  No need for all the toppings as the crust, sauce and cheese should stand on its own, and they sure did here.  We ordered the Neapolitan pizza and it was just like I hoped it would be.  Crispy charred on the bottom but still soft enough to fold your slice in half, sweet tomato sauce, creamy mozzarella cheese and fresh basil.  We inhaled it!  We also ordered the burrata salad and it was amazing.  It came on a bed of arugula and chopped tomato with a balsamic / olive oil blend and a balsamic glaze.  Food is definitely fresh and flavorful. 

I have only one suggestion for the restaurant- add basil under toppings.  

It was my first time ordering via Uber Eats and I needed to add some delivery instructions since I must have missed it when placing the order.  Catherine answered the phone and was super sweet and offered the drivers number so I could personally tell him the directions.  Bill was our driver and was extremely nice and appreciated the phone call.  From placing the order to delivery was so speedy fast.  Very impressed.

The bottom tastes burnt to me and that's a real turn off. Don't get me wrong, I love pizza! I guess I was just expecting more here.

The place is basically a fast casual establishment where you order and pay up front and then grab your own drinks, utensils, etc. You can order any pizza on the menu with additional toppings, but we just went with the margherita straight up. They also serve beer too which was a surprise. There was also a check-in offer for a free chocolate chip cannoli.

2351117,2013-04-23,0,0InA3Ffj8MxyQV9hgsyYcQ,"The good: Pizza was pretty tasty and the crust was chewy and well cooked.  There was a good assortment of toppings, and the caprese salad was a healthy size with good mozzarella and tomato.  Prices were pretty inline with this type of food.  Good size to the pizzas. The lady who made our pizzas was super friendly and helpful and patient.  Toppings like soppresata and pancetta are a good addition.

The bad:  The yelp cannoli?  When the check in offer is for a free cannoli, and you ask for a cannoli, but then show them the yelp screen..they shout ""yelp cannoli"" instead to the guy getting the cannoli, which results in you getting a super tiny (3 bites..literally) cannoli.  I mean, its free and thats cool, but something about doing that just feels cheap.  Either offer a free cannoli, or don't but giving some half pint imitation just leaves a sour taste..to me at least.
Not sure where the health department grade is posted...that bothers me.  Also, people in the kitchen don't wear any hair nets or anything and some of them have real long hair that is just flowing around.  Does not seem to be the ideal set up to prevent contamination.  Parma ham did not work on the pizza when cooked, as it ended up super crunchy with the huge slices they just put on the pizza.  Cut it into smaller pieces maybe?  Also, the pizza gets very soggy pretty fast due to the runny sauce and moisture from the cheese.  Not sure how that would be avoided, but it is a little irritating when the whole piece of super flaccid after a few minutes.

Overall, pretty good, although it is definitely no Settebello.  Hopefully it will get even better with time.",8M4TrpX2jPcz4_Wd7S4qcQ,0,0,4,V0XI_2_l2609vpwM8TC6MA

Order anything and everything you wont leave unsatisfied. They also have a good selection of gelato and other items, they were ok. The kitchen is open and so is the view of their wood burning pizza oven.  

The one or two things I didn't care for was 1 the interior decor and feel of the restaurant. Pre-Yelp days I probably have walked in then out but that's me being picky. And 2 the way it seemed like the chef was talking down other pizza restaurants just because ""they didn't go to Italy for training to cook pizza"" personally I don't care about that, all I care for is excellent tasting pizza which they already have.

""Heard you were in my pizzeria.
We politely ask you not to ask for xtra wet ingredients as this will make the pizza soggy because it is a true wet dough pizza.
We trained in naples Italy not California like the above mentioned.
We like to tell our customers to watch youtube videos of Da Michele pizzeria.
Then they know what we are doing and thank god for the thousands of customers we have each week that appreciate the freshness and quality that we bring at such a low low price.
Thanks for trying us but you seem to like the americanized version better.""

First of all, it's obvious that Mr. Classy lacks basic reading comprehension because most of his message doesn't even fit with my review.  For example, he politely (lol, politely, sure) asks me not to ask for extra wet ingredients, notwithstanding the fact that all my pizza had was sauce and cheese.  Notice he doesn't say anything about my remarks regarding disgusting mozzarella and too much oil.  I'm sure that's authentic Napoli style, riiiiight.  

I stand by my review (which wasn't mean-spirited in the least!), and it's a shame that this business owner lacks the class and decency to actually take feedback from customers and do something constructive.  Instead, he decides to send a private message acting like I am the one with an issue.  Seriously?  Someone has his undies in a bunch and seems upset with the fact that SETTEBELLO is far superior.  Here's a hint: If you want your business to thrive, then you might actually focus on making peoples' experiences more positive, rather than just insulting them.

That said, EVERY time we've been there the service has been mediocre at best. There is always mass confusion between all the employees, even when we've seen the owner (or perhaps manager?) working the line or the pizza oven as well. When were were there last, he was visibly stressed and short-tempered with this employees. He seems like a nice guy so it was a shame that the customers had to observe him like this.

The left hand is definitely not talking to the right at this restaurant. The cashiers are confused as to whose orders are whose which leaves a long line of customers telling them ""That's my order!"" or ""Wait, that's mine!""  During all of this, the take-out orders continued to get mixed up with in-house orders. We saw customers finally just get frustrated and walk out.

It's like watching a train wreck. You don't want to watch but you can't look away from the carnage. 

There is definitely something missing in terms of efficiency here. I hope they figure out what it is to make the food service/cashier part run much more smoothly. It'd be a shame to see it go out of business since their food is excellent.",u7STm9Oql5bgGUM7NLBxbQ,3,1,3,kX3bohWgXCiqnAJUmE0B2A
2586547,2013-09-23,0,0InA3Ffj8MxyQV9hgsyYcQ,"Yummy.. Pizza! The is a yummy pizza place, the first time you walk in you can smell the aroma of the pizza. It makes your mouth water. It was my families first time here. We were confused as the concept.. being the first time you come in. After reading the menu boards and the different lists of instruction, we figured everything out. The line was filled with a decent amount of people, but it was incredibly long. We started out with the guy making dough, we told him it was our first time here and he told us how everything worked. It was kind of hard to hear him over the tall glass panel they had. So we either had to somewhat yell for him to hear us. I didn't like that, we should be able to hear each other!

It says on the menu to not get more than three toppings, because it messes up the pizza.. My brother didn't know better so he piled on the toppings. DO NOT DO THAT! Only put 1 or two toppings. Because the dough is already somewhat wet and once they put it into the oven it bakes up quite fast.. I saw that people complain about their pizza being soggy or watered down, it is because of the toppings or the types of toppings. I ordered ham, pineapple, and pepperoni on their basic pizza, it was watery in the middle. Probably because of the pineapple. None the less it was delicious! Next time I won't order any toppings and just have it regular. You can really taste the basil and quality cheeses. The crust also has the charred yummy taste. I enjoyed it.

We also ordered the a caesar salad, eggplant parmesan, and I received the free cannoli for a check in! The caesar comes small or large. It had a very tasty dressing and it wasn't swimming in it either. Just the right amount. My brother and my sister in law really favored the eggplant parmesan, they said they would be back just for that dish. The cannoli was free. It was very good. It did have a lot of chocolate chips, but who doesn't like chocolate? It also has a touch of cinnamon on the pastry I taste. 

The reason I'm giving this place a 3 is because of my experience. The people are very nice there, but it can be disorganized. Some people are in the assembly lines, out of the assembly lines. People are here or there, you could tell that some workers didn't know where to go or what to do. It took awhile for them to have our order ready. Even though I did like my pizza, I wish it wasn't watered down in the middle. When I go there again, I won't order a lot of toppings. There also was a lady there who touched my brothers pizza after we saw her cleaning the tables.. Because he asked why it was watered down and why the toppings should only be 3. She tried to explain what kind of dough it had and she lifted the pizza up, I thought that was kind of rude. Because we couldn't take those two pieces home with us. 

I would come back again though! Friendly staff, the pizza is delicious, and the place is nice.",OVYP73aNQaEKLf4w4_40SA,0,1,3,Xv79cSWWF5kDS_MD1hK0cg

The girl didn't acknowledge me and just starred at me like I should greet her. I wasn't sure if she understood my order or not. Once she finished she just moved on like next. 
Got my first pizza. I couldn't believe how dry it was. It was a Margherita and when I asked why it was so dry I was told because if not it would be soupy. They did offer to remake it. 
The way the pizza was cut was unbelievable. 3 small pieces and 2 huge pieces. Basically attention to detail has been lost. 
Second pizza tasted great. 
I will give credit to the young lady who was there on her day off and over heard everything. She came over and apologized and offered to have it remade 3 times.

I was worried for a while and avoided the place, loyalty to Marc runs deep in my veins as it does to all people and things culinary I love. Novecento delivers on the passion Chef Marc dedicated to bringing authentic VPN Za to Las Vegas. 

Arriving and seeing my ""civillian"" friends (thanks Terri R for a less awkward non -Yelper  moniker) who had joined me several times @ Parma including Nelson's last off the hook Feb ""Mangia"" series, we were ready. Afterwards, it has become included on family and friend recommended and HIGHLY endorsed list. 

Since having such an incredible experience at Nelson's UYE, I've had the opportunity to taste (comp training = boo) many of Marc's and my friends creations. They remind me very much of Northern Italian Za and I've been to Italy 3 dozen+ times. Za there (thank anyone/Gd/Gdess) that Marc's hand pulled VPN Za does not taste like ""get  GMO laden pie for $5!!!"" (though at times I'd prefer natural selection thin the herd of those ""foodies"") Anywhooo...

Still go with white pie and any available seafood; or simple Margarita with post oven  cracked egg & arugula (the latter my ch 3 buds call ""over easy Pizza? "") It is perfect, uncut is the way to go IMHO, but just as many are conditioned to eat crap, they want a pre-sliced pie :::le sigh:::

After so much self-imposed hesitation, I see how silly it was since nearly a decade of trusting Marc's genius. Yes, VPN Za is ""soupier"" in center, if you cannot wait for it to settle after a mere 90 seconds in the eponymous 900 degree oven, just breathe for a minute... all you ranch dippers who confuse we Italians in the house: the crispy crust dipped in the fresh from oven Za is the way they do it in Naples (Sicilian girl talking) This is where you dip the crust into the center, which will be ""soupy"" if you don't give it a few minutes to settle. The pizza is not circumcised as it is meant to be eaten from crust to center, but dipping crust into center (make sense?) It is not your ""grab and fold"" East Coast Za ""slice"" - it is a pie, in every sense of the word. A delicious genius fantabulous pie Marc has agonized over perfecting for years. As such, it is beyond the comprehension of some...again, I see it as Natural Selection in action, but might not be the best for business. Still, folks are catching on and early glitches have been worked on diligently. 


This Za will never please chain loving ranch dipping people and does not try to: they don't carry Ranch dressing (as a New Yorker, I need to know HOW that Ranch BS happened?!?!) but it is not meant to. Marc is about whole, clean, fresh food. 

However you have it: please do. Fresh everything (including gluten free dough!) And Marc puts his heart and soul in all he does. Another winner. Bravo! Marc can frequently be found perusing the local Farmers Markets for the freshest ingredients possible and pulls his own mozzarella (why oh why does that sound dirty?! ;)) A local Chef who cares deeply about his food and heritage which he honors with the food he creates. Mangia!!!

Located in the Northwest on Centennial Center Drive north of Ann Rd, so it was close to home.  You order at the counter with a menu or you can follow there steps on the menu board.  Pizzas and salads are made right in front of you  as you walk the line.  Margherita pizza as choice one or white pizza with no sauce just olive oil, plus toppings.  Additional topping's are just $1 more for each.

We went for the Margherita 10 inch with and Arugula salad. Dough ball shaped right on the pizza peel with plenty of flour for easy release.  Once pizza was prepped into the wood burning oven for a quick.  Microwave pizza is not even cooked this rapidly.  Crust came out perfect with a sight char from the hot oven.  
The sauce had a slight tang from the real tomato sauce.  The fresh basil and real chunks of mozzarella melted and blended nicely.  

The arugula salad was pretty tasty as well.  Topped with artichoke, marinated mushrooms, mediterranean olives, and shaved parmesan cheese.  Drizzled with a balsamic dressing this salad did not last long for the whole family.  

One unique feature was the silverware like forks and knifes on the table in a little jar.  The self serve plates on a separate table was another interesting touch.  Novecento also serves gelato for dessert.  If you check in on Yelp while at the location you can have a complimentary cannoli.  Yumm!

Travis (?) made the pizza, he loves his job and it shows in his suggestions and abilities. Great guy. My pizza started with a slathering of  minced garlic sauce, followed by the spicy tomato sauce. On top of that I had sausage, spicy pepperoni, smoked mozzarella in addition to traditional mozzarella. I went there with my wife and mother-in-law and we all agreed that the pizza was fantastic. They had the traditional Margherita pizza. We also shared the large arugula salad which was fresh and delicious.

Just stopped in on the off chance I could buy some dough and some sauce as we're making pizza at home tonight. I was greeted the owner/manager (?) Vinnie.

If I am paying extra, then give me what I paid for.

Everytime I ordered the baked ziti (minus one time), they say they ran out of noodles.  I don't know how they advertise it on their menu and never have it.  Pricing is decent, about $12 (before extra toppings) for a 10"" specialty pizza.  

I do wish that they update the decor, it is soooo depressing inside.  It is dark & looks unloved.

For the uninitiated: EAT THIS PIZZA HERE, DON'T TAKE IT HOME! It is a real Neapolitan pie and is cooked quickly and is sort of ""wet"" which makes for lousy translation to going home- like french fries- never quite the same.
Fewer toppings is also a better way to go- crust, sauce, everything is delicious. Salads looked fresh though we didn't sample.

The crust has been perfectly cooked each time and is definitely firmer in the middle now. I think we just got them when they were new, the first review. The crust is chewy and delicious. The flavors are fresh. My favorite is the simple margarita with fresh mozzarella. My only complaint is they still don't have a great system down for the ordering and paying. They've changed it up, but it's still a little awkward, especially if you're getting gelato after the fact and then have to go back and cut people in line waiting to pay for pizzas. 
Original review: I really wanted to like this place. It's close to home and a nice casual, walk up and order setting. Great for kids who can't sit at a served restaurant. First, it's obvious the employees are new, or at least the guy making our pizzas. It was very slow. More importantly, the pizza is just ok. The flavors (crust, sauce, toppings) are all good enough. The problem is the crust does not get crisp enough in the center. So strange, I've been to several brick oven type pizza places and the crust is always done just right. We got 3 pizzas, all 3 sagged in the middle. You couldn't hold a slice without it flopping over and it's not because the slices are huge. The center wasn't doughy or underdone, just not crisp and chewy like it should be. The rim of the crust was done just right. The crust was a deal breaker for me, there are many other places in town that get their crust done right.",rdz9QHEPoecQ7DJk49ZI-g,1,0,4,pXNICffGvoLzaVrOYZNRMg

Chef Marc's ""Parma"" restaurant is a favorite of ours and we made his Wednesday night pizza service a regular event, so we were thrilled when Novecento opened. 

  We are big fans of the standard Margarita Pizza and Novecento does them quite well. The crusts are always nicely charred with that great ""leopard spot"" that lets you know the oven did its thing. The sauce is sweet and applied as to not make the pie soggy because there is nothing worse than limp crust. The fresh basil and buffalo mozzarella complete a wonderful package. 

  I've never been big on cannolis but the ones Novecento serves will turn a non-believer like me into a cannoli convert. Light, crisp pastry tube filled with creamy whipped mascarpone cheese and a generous amount of chocolate chips that will put a smile on your face. A glass of house red wine at $3 a glass is a perfect complement to both dinner and dessert. 

  The ordering process at Novecento was a bit cumbersome when they first opened but that has been streamlined and the process goes quite quickly now. The lack of table service helps keep the prices down and makes this spot a great value. The lack of wait staff doesn't mean that Novecento is like other short-order sit down type places. The restaurant is more upscale than most all other places in its price range. The atmosphere is comfortable and makes you want to take your time and savor your meal.

Walking in here had a nice calm atmosphere. Staff were very inviting and cheerful :) 

My date and I were 1st timers here. So the guy decided to explain everything very detailed and very enthusiastic. While he was describing everything I think I might've drooled a lil haha.. 

Chef Marc is genius pizza like subway style what lol it was entertaining having them create your pizza in front of your eyes. The ingredients all looked very fresh and surroundings were very clean A+ in my book. 

Well we decided on not just one pizza but two.
1) white bianco cheese pizza, basil, grilled chicken, hot cherry peppers, ricotta (A++), and truffle oil 
2) spicy red pizza, basil, xtra cheese, and meatballs (all beef ;) ) 

Not only was the pizza fresh, but the dough they used is specifically made for their special oven cooking at 900degrees my pizza was done in 2 minutes basically awesome!!! The dough was Italian style soooo DELICIOUS. Their ricotta was so creamy and fluffy ,it was awesome, it was like the whipped cream of all cheeses! 

So all in all I loved this pizza place! Their first impression got me hooked. This will be my one and only pizza place in Vegas for me from now on :) 
Oh btw Did I mention it's in the NW and down the street from me uh-oh.. At least my gym is next door lol",rSw1VBi2A93qEsQti6eiXg,3,3,5,52gKrqBcgR9zFePGUouj5Q

The lady behind the counter was super nice and walked me through the process. I chose the margharetta pizza with mushroom. Toppings is 1.00 each. You pay and go sit down and they bring it to you. The pizza was soggy and the cheese and toppings slipped right off of it as you put it on your plate. Crust was doughy and chewy. No crunch to it all. I also ordered the chopped salad. It had minced salami in it so you could really taste it. Very dissapointed in the food here. I will not be back. Save your money and go elsewhere.,lgxCqDMnowyx1Q5fLdLPCA,3,3,1,VsJuH8ETSgRZ2uz9b5Ppkg

Now this isn't a regular pizzeria.  You walk down an assembly line and tell them which toppings you want as they assemble your pizza in front of you.  

I went for lunch and they had a great lunch special - $8.99 for a 7"" pizza, small arugula salad, and a soda.  I asked for spicy marinara, fresh mozzarella, capicola, and artichoke hearts.  

The arugula salad was delicious!!  It was tiny but packed with cherry tomatoes, olives, and artichoke hearts.  The pizza was very tasty.  My only complaint would be that the bottom wasn't crispy.  It was a little soggy.  

The customer service was excellent.  The atmosphere was decent.  There were some unfinished parts of the restaurant.  I sat under an area where the ceiling tile was missing.  I felt like something would fall out of there.  Haha.

BUT THE SERVICE JUST SEEMS TO GET WORSE AND WORSE, I become so infuriated with how much of a crappy attitude they have. Especially the older woman who doesn't speak very good English, she is just the absolute worst and it wasn't a one time ""she was having a bad day"" type of situation. It has been every time I go, and it isn't the language barrier- because I speak Spanish. Its her I don't give a shit about my job and I drag my feet around and don't know what's going on type of attitude that makes me really hate when she is preparing the pizza. 

If it wasn't for the food, I probably would never come here again. The employees are very clueless and drag their feet and make you feel like you aren't welcome. It definitely has caused me to not come as often or rave about it to my friends as much as I used to.

Sad to say, the pizza didn't live up to my expectations. I arrived hungry and tired, and I left hungry, tired, and unsatisfied about my experience. 

Before I begin the rest of my review, some people have commented on my post stating that this is a style of pizza that differs from the American style. With that being said, I get it, but frankly, I just don't like the style. 

We went for creating our own custom 10-inch pizza, wheat-based. Unfortunately, we were told that they ran out of wheat dough because of a mad rush of customers that they had before we arrived, so we just settled for regular dough, no worries. The pizza was created right in front of us and cooked and ready to eat instantaneously. Now here's the downside: Although it was hot, and the crust was crunchy, the rest of the pizza was wet. The mushrooms, sauce, and pepperoni toppings weighed down the bread and slipped onto my plate, leaving me to fork and knife each of my slices.

When it comes to service, the staff seemed like they were just ""moving through the motions"" and not paying attention to customers. Several stood around idly chit chatting; one of them spoke about how they couldn't wait to get off work. A busser came by and just took my plate of food without asking -- actually, as hungry as I was, he might've done me a huge favor by not letting me eat anymore soggy slices.

Trust me, I really wanted to like this place based on the 4 and 5 star reviews, but I just can't stomach mediocre, under cooked pizza and unexceptional service.",epkRB3J_oBEiyiwahvdmGg,13,6,1,ilmYw_0jdZDPbbtGSO5REA

To start the pizzas are a flat $7 and then $1 for each topping. 

I like things simple so I ordered the ""Red Margarita"". It had tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella, basil, olive oil and I had them add garlic. The pizza (you can tell by the picture) looked somewhat tasty. There wasn't really a wow factor. The sauce was watery and and the bottom crust was very black. I know it is supposed to have a blackened pattern on the bottom but it was solid black which made it hard to actually take in all the flavors on the pizza. My man wasn't able to finish his ""Pepperoni Pizza"" because the burnt flavor stood out too much. I managed to make it to slice number 3 of 4 to find I bit into a piece of a metal spring type thing. Obviously this made me nervous to eat anymore. I did go up to the counter and show the cashier and explain that I had bitten into it who right away apologized and showed it to Chef Marc who was on the phone and literally stopped his conversation to make sure I wasn't hurt and that I was OK. I explained that I was just fine thank goodness but I wanted them to know about what happened and if they knew what the piece of metal might be so they can make sure nobody else gets a piece and swallows it. Chef Marc said it was from whatever they use to clean the dishes. The proper thing to do here would be to refund my meal or remake it. Neither was even offered. I do understand accidents happen and that they just opened and are working out kinks. I noticed an electrician there doing wiring on a wall and boxes were scattered everywhere so they are clearly still getting the place together. Chef Marc insisted I take any flavor gelato I wanted for free to make up for what happened.  The gelato was not that great. A refund or a remade pizza would have been the appropriate thing to do.

The place was clean as far as there wasn't food on the floor or anything like that but the electrician doing the wiring and all the boxes/wires around made me feel I was intruding and they weren't ready for customers. Inside was plenty of seating. 

They offer beer and wine.

I most likely wont give this palce a 2nd try since I am turned off by the ""metal pizza"" and the way it was handled.",Fv0e9RIV9jw5TX3ctA1WbA,14,4,1,rxcnZlCFjySp1VBm0a7eyg

They make the pizza in front of you and then you can see them cooking it in the brick oven. Don't ask for extra cheese because it will make the pizza soggy. It doesn't look like they put enough cheese at first but when it's cooked it melts and is just enough. I found this out because I asked the lady that was making my pizza for extra cheese and she then asked me if it was my first time there. I said it was and she proceeded to explain why it was better not to get the extra cheese. I really appreciated this. It's a super cool and clean place and they have a lot of topping options. Service is great and the whole atmosphere makes you feel like your in Italy. The price is super reasonable as well.

The salad was good for both my friend and I. Then, we get our pizza. They were all burnt on the bottom almost like the oven hadn't been cleaned. To top off my experience I took a bite out of the cannoli I ordered and it was sour. There is nothing worse then leaving with a sour taste in your mouth. I went to hand them to a women she said I am sorry. I went back up to the counter and instead of offering me new cannoli's she said here let me give your 3.24 back sorry about that.

The atmosphere is very cozy and inviting, and you also get to see all the action from the dining room. Chef Marc and his team were in action, and his simple, straightforward approach is an easy four step process:

1) Choose your Base-$7.00
""Margherita""-Crushed San Marzano Tomatoes. Olive Oil, Basil, and Mozzarella
""Bianco""-Olive Oil, Garlic, Basil, and Mozzarella

2) Choose your Topping-$1.00 each (*no more than 3 are suggested to fully enjoy    the  flavors and authenticity of your pizza) assorted meats, cheeses, egg,and veggies are available, and also Roasted Chicken($2), Smoked Salmon, and Prosciutto di Parma($3)

3) Order a Soup,Salad, and/or dessert-Salads($4/$7) are subject to seasonal availability, Pasta Fajiole($4.50) and Gelato($3.00)

4) Pay for your order, grab a seat and your order will be brought out to you...MANGIA!


Wifey went with a Margherita base, Pepperoni, Mushrooms, and Spinach. That was AWESOME! I knew I wanted a White Pizza, but I went the ""Omakase"" route and left it in Chef Marc's hands.To the Bianco Base, he added Chili Flakes, Pancetta, Romano, and an egg... simple, and FANTABULOUS!!! Love the crispy, chewy crust and just the right amount of toppings. I'm calling this one ""Nelson's Pizza"", cause that's the way I'll have my pizza every time I visit Novecento. For dessert, we shared a Gingersnap and Banana-Pecan Gelato which was a great ending to our dinner.

So happy that we got a sneak preview of things to come, and even much more happier Novecento is in my neck of the woods. Congrats Chef Marc, and Welcome to the Neighborhood!

First off the ordering process upon entering the restaurant is confusing. 
Second, the toppings an individual coat for each topping? Understood of the items are made on house but a small 10"" pizza can get pretty expensive when adding 3 or more toppings. 
Third, salad size for a large and the cost is not comparable. 
Forth, the ambiance of the restaurant is confusing. It's like a restaurant that wants to be a sports bar that wants to be a pizzeria. I felt like it needed a make over from restaurant impossible on the food network. 
Overall I don't like to write reviews like this but it surely was disappointing when other restaurants such as pieology or blaze is offering fresh unlimited toppings for one price.",MZlOdcOZqWiduNi791A79g,0,1,1,rkrtLudrstRFY0FfOoPwIw

First thing, beware the fan blowing on the wood as you stand in line, it will surprise (goose ya) you as you work around in the line. Second, if it's a busy time be prepared to wait a little but it's ok, will be worth it.

The pizzas are personal size and cooked to order in a wood fired oven so hot and evenly cooked. They have a few types of pizza styles you can pick from or they will build your own. My favorite was the calabrese. It comes with a spicy red sauce and a pepper mix. You can even wash it down with Peroni on tap..which is perfect for pizza.

Whatever your choice, it will be good.

I questioned how long it'll take for things to turn around but one of the hardest working chefs off the strip, Chef Marc, had done it once again.  Novecento had a rushed opening and it could have either gone one way or the other, a dream come true or a nightmare.  And first impressions usually sticks and is hard to come out of but Chef Marc uses experience, love of food, and hard work to impose success in what he does.  He is one of few who appreciates actual feedback from customers and Yelp reviews, most Chefs out there are too stubborn to think otherwise.  Any faults of a rushed opening is clearly gone and if you were here the first couple weeks do come back!  

Like they say in Italian movies: Pay reward with pizza in my mouth!  Well not really, and not quite Naples but this is the type of pizza you should expect:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm9U1dKNpZg

Don't expect a Pizza Hut or Domino's now, he's trying to give you a little bit of something back from his home in Italy.  The dough is a soft dough, notice in the video how the pizza is not pre-cut before service but you eat it with knife and fork.  That's the way it should be eaten but Western influence and pressure they'll cut it for you.  I ask not to pre-cut it.  I also ask to throw a little bit more Italian bacon on mine, with a little wink like this ;)

When you walk into the pizza shop the line starts to your right, you'll find a ticket on the counter which you fill out and mark down what you want.  Most people not familiar with Parma and its deli will find unfamiliar ingredients and meat as pizza toppings.  So let me help you out some as I used to be king of Parma pizzas.  Now I might get some of these wrong so always ask your pizza maker what these ingredients are.

Pancetta - Italian bacon.  My favorite, bacon, is my favorite is bacon it is my favorite.
Soppresata - Italian salami.
Ricotta - Whey cheese.
Prosciutto de Parma - Ham and the most expensive cuts are from Italy such as the city of Parma.

You can go for a traditional pepperoni and mushroom pizza but you can also go with the old Parma pizza Wednesdays favorites such as the Margarita (tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella, and basil [think the colors of Italy]), Bianco (mozzarella, pesto, cheese, onions, topped with arugula tossed in truffle oil), Roma-Pancetta (cracked fresh pepper, Romano cheese, and sunny side up organic brown egg. Tuscano (mushrooms and onions), Calabrese (hot peppers, soprasotta, and eggplant), a New York, Sicilian, etc.  Just make it here.  

And to make it even special because I love you guys, if and when you see Chef Marc ask him if he can share a taste of the special Olive Oil he has in stock.  I love the Estate Blend ( http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/novecento-pizzeria-las-vegas?select=h1SoMQZ40Q-2l13woiTuUg#hEWNrcruUUPVSHp5BfBYCw ) I also love cooking with it now.  But I used to ask for ranch to dip my crust in but this Olive Oil substitutes it.  I might carry this around with me in my truck now along with Nuttela, reference my Chocolate and Spice review or other bakery reviews.  So if you love it as much as I do buy some!  Bring in your own container or old bottle and have him fill it up so you can take it home!",k4M43lXJuQMpQW65DTqzIQ,9,6,5,LGWmtRzpE0Qdsbl-zJOCcA

The Good: 

Prices are decent.

Pizzas are handmade, and made in front of you Subway style.

Nice, classic pizzeria decor.

Friendly staff.

Caesar salad is good, albeit the large isn't really large.

The Bad:

The smoked salmon pizza we got was....weird. It also had too much garlic, dough was a little soft, and the rest of the flavors were muted from the garlic.

The lighting is uneven. Half of it is soft white bulbs and the other half is daylight bulbs. Its a small thing, but throws the ambiance off.

We weren't given plates to eat our pizza on, or to share our salad. We had to eat on napkins.

The utensil and condiment basket only had one fork, and the olive oil dispenser was empty. Went to some other tables to grab some and the first three I checked didn't have any either.

4049927,2015-08-22,1,0InA3Ffj8MxyQV9hgsyYcQ,"The pizza is good.  They have some issues.  First of all the place promotes 90 second pizzas.  This is not the case.  It took us an hour to eat there on a Friday night.  First issue.  There is a line to place an order.  There was not enough staff.  I've been to similar pizza places that had 20 people behind the counter.  This place had about 4 employees on hand total to wait on tables, cook, take orders, bus tables, clean.  It's not enough people for a restaurant this size that promotes speed on their sign outside.  The place was not even half full.   It seemed to take 10 minutes of waiting to order.  Another 10 minutes to move down the line and assemble your pie.  Another 5 to pay and get seated.  15 more for the food to arrive.  

The main issue I see with this establishment is the layout.  The menu board is well past where you place your order and it's not at the right angle to read from line because the fluorescent lighting reflects off of the sign making it impossible to read.  So what happens is nobody decides what they want until they get to the counter.  Then you need to decide on crust size, sauce, toppings before you even can read the sign.  The toppings are in bins with no signs.  You can't even tell what half them are from line and there is no clear list on the menu board.  Also I don't usually complain about this, but the person taking the orders does not seem to speak English very well.  Her accent is so strong that I could not tell what words she was speaking.  She also seemed to not understand what we were saying and again there are issues with layout.  The employee asking you questions is behind glass.  You are standing in front of a busy restaurant with crying children and loud TVs.  It's hard to communicate in an environment like this.  There should be a wall behind where customers stand to block the sound.

So anyway the process is convoluted.    You tell them the size you want first.   Then the sauce then the toppings.  I didn't find out I could have gotten a calzone until I already had my pizza half assembled.  This is another beef I have with this.  You can only choose between 7"" and 10"" pizzas.  I don't know about you, but I want to be able to choose at least a 14 inch pie, too.  I can eat a 10"" pie and then some when I am hungry and I should not need to order two pizzas to get full.   The menu is poorly written and communicating with staff is difficult.   I didn't see the bottled soda prices on the board and they were sold out of the drink I wanted.  Sorry, but you don't sell out of any of the drinks and stay in business.  Someone is not doing their job.

So we ordered several pizzas and sat down with a number on our table.   We waited and waited.  It took no less than 15 minutes for the pizza to come to our table.  I have to wonder how a 90 second pizza can take 15 minutes to cook.  The dining area was also understaffed with no silverware, dirty tables...   The pizza itself was tasty.  The crust was sort of chewy and had good flavor and was well cooked.  They also were generous with the toppings so I give them thumbs up for that.  We had Margareta and a pesto pizza and the one that was ordered as a white pie also ended up with red sauce because of poor communication by the staff.  The toppings and drinks are too expensive because dinner for 3 ended up costing about $35 for what we got - two 7"" and one 10"" and two soft drinks.  No leftovers.  I wanted to order some appetizers or desserts but nobody asked and by the time I got through the ordering process I was literally worn out.  If you can't get customers to their table within 10 minutes of walking through the door then you need to rethink your concept.  Nobody should need to wait this long.  Maybe you need to have full table service.  Another suggestion would be a better written menu on paper that is handy for people standing in line.  It needs to have photos of things especially the non pizza items and the prices.  You have way too many things for people to decide while in line.  This makes the line move very slowly.  More staff along the pizza line would also help a great deal.

I may go back, but I'm going to look for a discount before I do again.  3 stars = A-OK.  Service brought my rank down.  I would give them 5 stars for food.  2 for service. 3 for atmosphere.",Gab1_sLsjJLAJojoFd-d-g,2,1,3,c21gI5UBGkC6ae8Ka-1-vw
4050374,2013-02-27,1,0InA3Ffj8MxyQV9hgsyYcQ,"This 5 star review is for their pizza, because they make it exactly the way I like it -- or close enough. 

Fresh dough, NO thick fatty crust, mozzarella cheese (just the right amount) and so many veggie options to go on top -- even arugula. Needless to say, I am  not a fan of cheesy, fatty, artery clogging American pizzas. Sorry if I'm offending anyone, not my intention. 

Normally, when I, hardly ever, order pizza from the chain pizza places here, I feel so full and achy after only one or two slices. But I actually could finish an entire pizza there (got the margarita pizza with mushrooms and basil). 

Cannot comment on anything else from the menu, because I have only had the pizza so far. The guys behind the counter are very nice and I love watching the first guy spreading the dough out. 

The place is very spacious and clean and I have been there twice now with no problems. Hopefully I can go back soon. I think I have found my favorite pizza place except for when we make our own at home on the grill... but nothing can top that.",akEFRm7rqlxIANKyTlaTOg,3,1,5,QWw0866clWDFn-CYw-qvVQ

In fact, there's really no need to ever leave the shopping center if you're hungry. But here's the issue, most of the restaurants are franchise or corporate owned.  So, it's obvious that I was pleased that Chef Marc's Novecento Pizzeria opened out here.  Less than a year since they opened, I finally got a chance to eat here. I am a pizza fan, but don't get the opportunity too often. So when a lunch with a bunch of Yelp friends at Novecento came up, we weren't passing on it.

We didn't partake in the $25 all you can Yelp eat. We ended up sharing a pizza and side of meatballs. Lets start with the meatballs. This was a meal in itself.  A lot of peeps rave about their homemade sauce, but for me it's all about the meatball. No fillers here. Each meatball is packed with flavor and protein.  You can actually get full from a couple of these bad boys.  As for the pizza, we shared their Margherita, which you can consider as a guiltless type pizza. Not much on it, except for pure taste of Naples. Taste, texture, and portions are more than enough. Now here's the bonus, half the pizza is only about 370 calories. This means zero guilt when I ate my half of this pie.

I'm a fan of a great tasting, authentic as it gets, pizza. Novecento definitely did not disappoint.  Novecento also offers a bunch of other pizzas and if you can't decide on which, then opt for the build-your-own.  When I'm in the mood for some good pie, I know where to go when I'm in the Centennial area.  Novecento, you rock!

When you cut a thin crust the juice from the sauce and the cheese make the crust soggy and it really ruins the experience and the taste. 
After spending many summers in Italy and enjoying pizza frequently at Leone Rosso in Sorrento walking into Marc's place brings back wonderful memories. The food, the atmosphere, the decor. It really is spot on. 
Keep your pizza simple. Best options are already on the menu for you. Don't get fancy. The more simple the better. If you want cheesy, meaty, thick, greasy crap do not come here. 
Beet salad... DELISH!!! 
Add some arugula to your pizza and be wowed!

But every once in a while a more artisan style is just what the stomach ordered.  I met a friend at Novacento a while back.  He had been before and knew what to order.  I followed his lead having never been myself.  We both ordered a 12"" with marinara and buffalo mozarella.  This is where our respective pizzas parted ways.  I went with mushroom, meatball and black olives.  I can't remember what he got because, quite frankly, mine was the only one that mattered.  I figured we would have our pizzas right away since they cook in a 900 degree oven in about 90 seconds.  It actually took a little while.  There were other customers orders ahead of us and the oven can only cook a couple at a time otherwise pizza starts burning before you can take it out.  At least I could look forward to a fresh, hot, perfectly cooked pie.  And that is exactly what I got.  I enjoyed it thoroughly.  Every slice of it.  Right there in the restaurant.  I also enjoyed a canoli that I got for free with a Yelp check-in offer.  I felt bad questioning the server when she brought out the pizza but no canoli. She said it she would bring it out later.  I didn't realize they would stuff it fresh and bring it to the table before it got soggy.

Last weekend I was home alone and we were showing our home which is up for sale.  I couldn't make something because we have to keep our house looking like no one lives here.  I didn't want to leave (because we have two dogs) and it was too hot (when is it not?) to leave them in the car while I picked up dinner somewhere.  So I started Googling and stumbled upon Novecento.  

First I will say, I'm picky about eating out.  I'm even pickier about pizza and almost never eat salads at restaurants.  We're real food lovers and eating out can be tricky, eating pizza and salad dressing with fresh, real food ingredients, from restaurants is nearly impossible.  Novecento caught my eye because of their claim to using farmer's market selections, fresh ingredients and house-made dressing.  I took the leap and ordered for delivery.

I ordered a pizza with spicy marinara, house sausage, ricotta and roasted onions and a small chopped salad.  The food was delivered within 30 minutes - the pizza was hot and the salad was fresh.  The delivery guy also gave me an awesome pizza slicer!   I ate the entire salad, which by no means was small and two pieces of my pizza and I was stuffed.  The pizza (which I was under the impression was an individual pizza) is huge - easily could be shared by two people if you order a salad to go with it.  All of it was delicious!

I took my husband to eat at Novecento last night and I fell even more in love with this awesome pizzeria.  The people that work there are awesome.  You get to watch them make your pizza.  You get a free cannoli with a Yelp check-in!  And you can get a generous glass of Italian house wine for FOUR BUCKS.  I loved it.  My husband loved it.

For $9.99 you get a one-topping pizza, small salad, and fountain drink. The pizza was nicely cooked inside a 900 degree oven and came out chewy, crispy (in the right areas) and flavorful. However, if you get a premium topping it's gonna cost you about $2.00. Which is a bit expensive to me, especially if it's just diced chicken. Whatever, the pizza was huge and only finished half. The arugula salad came large and assertive; dressed in balsamic, olives, roasted mushrooms, artichoke hearts, and shaved Parmigiano-Reggiano. My meal ended with a nice canolli with mini chocolate chips. Can I get an amen?  
 
The only mishap was the late arrival of my salad. But the girl sincerely apologized and with the speed of light, she made my salad like a champ. 

While chowing down like pigs, the music was on throwback mode. The Temptations, the Supremes, and Jackson 5 filled the restaurant. I thought it was beautiful and set the mood absolutely right.

We stumbled upon this pizzeria and were sure glad we did! We've been there twice in the past month and absolutely love it! The three pizzas we ordered were all delicious and the side Caesar salad I ordered was really good too! 

My family and I couldn't believe how quick the pizzas bake--it only takes 90 seconds to bake in their very cool pizza oven!

The restaurant is pretty big and spacious inside, and we really liked that as well. 

Also, the staff was SUPER FRIENDLY and SO NICE! Bernice (sp?) was so awesome, helpful and nice when we had questions about menu items, etc. She sure knew her stuff and was happy to help us, and she makes GREAT PIZZAS!! She is top-notch for sure! 

On a side note, I'm highly allergic to MSG and when I asked the staff if it was in what I ordered, they were very helpful in checking and making sure it wasn't in my food. I REALLY appreciated that. 

I would highly recommend Novecento Pizzeria to anyone that loves great pizza! We can't wait to go back! :)

So I went in ordered an arugula salad and a 7"" pizza with mushrooms and buffalo mozzarella. I read along the reviews and a few people had stated not to get more than three toppings because it makes the dough watery and soggy. I also received a free cannoli for checking in. I ordered another order to go for my husband. I sat down and waited for my food to be brought to my table. They must have misunderstood me because they packed everything to go. So that irritated me. I took it home and as I pulled out a slice of pizza the whole piece bent down and all the cheese and mushrooms fell off. I thought i avoided that by only getting one topping. The same thing happened to the other three thin soggy pieces. Its to bad because it tasted pretty good! Definitely not better than Grimaldi's or  Settebello's. The arugula salad was good, dressing looked like it was straight balsamic and unfortunately a few olives had pits in them. So try not to break your teeth on a salad.  Luckily i was cautious to begin with. The cannoli was average and they only offer small. Definitely no where near as good as cake boss!

As an NY pizza snob with 4 grandparents straight from Napoli; its proven very difficult to find pizza up to my standards in the western US.  In fact; the only place in the whole western US that I've been impressed by is Pizza Rock...  Until I found Novecento.  

As soon as I walked in, the traditional Italian decoration surprised me, and the fresh ingredients all lined up ready to order gave me hope that this place would be different. 

I ended up ordering the margherita pizza with the spicy diavolo sauce, fresh mozzarella, and 3 toppings.  Came to about $13, so I decided to grab a meatball and pepperoni calzone as well.  This order plus two drinks ended up being just under $30 and my girlfriend and I were full (costs us around $60 to be full at pizza rock.. Plus tip).

The pizza is great!  All fresh ingredients, cooked to perfection.  The calzone was just as good.  I came back the next day for a Stromboli and liked it even better than the calzone.  

I'll have to come back and try some more of the menu before I can truly say that I like this place as much as I do pizza rock, but I can't see anybody coming here and not being wowed.",x7tsmp5lbgWXQ72pkwEWPg,0,0,5,de2OFWgbG7heGu-puMICcQ

The pizza makers admitted they did not know what they are doing - I found it frustrating trying to explain to him the difference between what the classic pizza vs the margherita pizza ingredients were listed on their menu!  How good your pizza is depends on which of the pizza makers make it otherwise you will end up with a soggy and thick crust (limpy) pizza.  

The pizza was also very salty... the guy was v heavy handed with the salt.. better to ask for no salt and add yourself!

My recommendation to anyone who really wants to try this place - watch first who makes good pizza and make sure that is the guy who makes yours otherwise you will not be happy :(  

Overall, the employees were not trained.  They didn't seem to care about the quality and output of what they were making.

I wanted to try the smoked salmon pizza and the girl at the counter was stumped at what went on it so she went to ask others. They debated if it had sauce or not. It said it had mozzarella, aioli, etc etc that I read off the menu to them and said I just want what was on the menu. They started talking amongst themselves didn't hear me and then put red sauce on the pizza. Red sauce and smoked salmon doesnt make sense to me and I didn't want it and said that didn't seem right, but they insisted it does....even though they didn't know what was the toppings on it just earlier. They still seemed confused about the pizza so I said ""Can we just get the calabrese pizza instead?"".  They did know that one so I just rolled with it. There are less than 10 specialty pizzas or make your own creation....I would assume being a pizza maker you would know what goes on the pizzas. 

We ordered also their chopped salad, as that salad is pretty delish. I definitely love that salad and how you can get a little bit of everything in each bite. 

The pizza comes and it's definitely soggy and watery. You can see the pool of it in the picture. It was getting closer to closing and they were cleaning up a bit so I debated if I should return it or not. I tried a bit of my piece and decided it was too soggy to deal with. I walked up and showed them and apologized they were cleaning and getting ready to go home, but it just wasn't okay. The guy was nice enough about it and said it was no problem.

They refired it and it was better. It was not as good as the BFs last pizza according to him. I suspect it was fired up by that one guy who used to make the pizzas at Parma and our pizza was made by newbies.

There's a yelp check in for a free cannoli with a pizza purchase. I was distracted so I didnt redeem that, but make sure to check in if you come. 

I don't know how to feel. I WANT to like this place is the trouble. It's Chef Marc, it's VPN style pizza, it's by my house and I really like that salad. It's getting good reviews now, some of my friends like it too. It seems WHO makes your pizza makes a difference....they come when Chef is here. It's hard for me to ever come back after this. It must be really inconsistent quality.

 It makes me sad to not feel zesty pizza redemption the second time around. I don't get the hype.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,15,6,1,2XRIEdlNerrJhMf5Y3G_sQ

Ambiance: 3 - The bar is still unused. Do they even sell alcohol? There is a gelato area that no one really knows about because it's not really on the menu..or if it is on the menu, I haven't seen it. They have booth like seating in the back, and large tables all around. The centerpieces for the tables are jars with clean silverware, so you don't have to walk to the silverware area--but you still have to walk over there to get plates anyway, which makes the jar a little useless. 

Service: 2 - The staff is okay, but it seems like they're more invested in talking with each other than they are with serving or helping people. Most of them don't really smile, which is a little weird and awkward. I don't know if it was just a weird day for them.? 

Food: 2 - Bianco Pizza: Basically a salad on a pizza. But the greens on top had more flavor than the pizza itself. It was average at best, not the greatest. I just wasn't a fan of this. 

Cannoli: I can officially say that the cannoli I tasted last year was better. The shell was softer, the cream inside was a touch sweeter. This was just a hard-shelled cannoli and it was just alright. But I liked it better than the pizza. 

For it to go down in quality is a little hard, and I'm not sure if the price is worth it for me this year.",OoyQYSeYNyRVOmdO3tsxYA,6,4,2,nj8jg6oLa2PEbOufLV4_IQ

The pizza is super delicious, and it's very quicky in and out, so perfect if you're in a hurry.

Fresh mozzarella, Pesto, Gorgonzola Cheese, Roasted Onions, topped with Arugula tossed in Truffle Oil. Good pizza! All the flavor was in the Arugula of course, so it's a good thing there was plenty to go around! Next time I will probably add a meat topping to it, although it isn't necessary.

Smoked Salmon :

Capers, Red Onions, Olive Oil and Goat Cheese. Just like lox and bagels lol. Cathy ordered this one and really liked it. The salmon had a nice taste, and the goat cheese wasn't too distracting, since I normally don't like it. Pretty good stuff!

My first visit did not make me an immediate fan. I ordered a pizza with spicy tomato sauce, fresh mozz., and mushrooms. It was OK, but I did not think I would be back. I ate there, my pizza was cut (they do not cut to go pizzas), and I thought it was a little soggy in the middle. I have to admit, I was confused about what to order at my first visit. The pizza maker welcomed me from behind the counter, asked if I had been there before, and noted all pizzas were one size and he suggested the margerhita (tomato, fresh mozz with basil). That type was not my favorite so, under the gun (no one else in line but pizza maker waiting), did the mushroom. I did not get the grated parm and basil which he asked if I wanted.

I did go back about 6 weeks later. I am a huge fan now and go every couple of weeks. I ordered the Roma (fresh mozz, prosciutto, 2 brown eggs in middle, with electives of spicy tomato sauces, fresh basil and grated parm, and salt and pepper). Of the times I have ordered it, I ate that first time in house, and it was heavenly tasting. A few other times, have gotten it to go (uncut), still excellent when I got home 10-15 mins. later.

I get that other reviewers say it may be soggy towards middle of pizza. I do think it has to do with the thinness and consistency of the crust but, I think it goes well with the crustier and chewyier edges.",krdKDJfXT4EKZwWcOrW2wQ,0,0,4,Knk-ifDxn2d7Ol_80P_5qg

That being said, their food is just okay. Nothing spectacular at all.

Then, when she dropped our food off at the table, she told us that she screwed up and that we needed to go back to the register to make it right. Really? You screwed up, you walked over to tell us about it, but we still have to come back to you to help you fix your mistake? Shit, many places would've just eaten their silly mistake because it was their fault...or at least not required us to get in line again, but these guys expected us to come back and clear things up after they both screwed up and stopped by to tell us about it.

The smoked salmon pizza has smoked salmon, capers, red onions, olive oil and goat cheese.  It was like lox and bagels in pizza form. It was good.  The tanginess of the goat cheese balances the saltiness of the smoked salmon.

The Bianco pizza was good too.  It has gorgonzola, pesto, white onions, mozzarella, arugula and truffle oil.  I just think it would be better if it had pine nuts to give it texture and additional flavor.

I'd heard about the Subway-like line up where you pick and choose what you want on your pizza, but I did not hear how expensive it was. To put it in perspective, it came out to 27$ for my boyfriend and I. Granted, it would have been five dollars cheaper if we had opted out of the drinks. A foam cup is 2.50$ and although you can get as much soda as you want (the fountains are available to everyone), you really need to (as Nicolette says) 'get your moneys' worth'. 

When you get to the front they have a pad of paper with the specialty pizzas and toppings that you check off (we had to ask for pens since someone had decided it was cool to steal them all) then you tell the people how many pies you want, and what you want on it. After you are done you go down the line to the register where you hand over your paper, and get any additional items.

I had checked off olives at first, but then crossed it out....yet I was still charged a whole dollar for them. This is a major downside to this place: the price. You can get any specialty pie for around 8$, but if you so choose to veer from that with additional toppings, it will cost you a whole lot more. Yes, the pie is pretty decent in size for one person. No, it should not cost that much.

My qualms about dress code were quickly squashed. The place looked like it was still being sorted out. There's an unused bar and Kegerator next to the tables and it generally looks unfinished.

Were decided to split a margherita 10"" pizza with no additional toppings. We also claimed the Yelp check in for a free mini chocolate chip cannoli. 

Pizza came out not too crispy and not too doughy. Not sure I was a fan of the crust because it tastes like it is dusted with flour. 

Cannoli came out fine but couldn't find it on the menu to order another. 

3 stars because the ambience and find it yourself beverage station weren't what I was expecting, including the solicitors that came to our table to ask for money for a cause.

Neither a bad nor automatic fan inducing experience for me. 3 stars.",OLn8EvPsu4hNug8V5PF2jA,5,3,3,11EcfYFC-UtjvulYFGSQAQ

I'm not sure if asking if it's an ""allergy"" means they are being over cautious or if they are not very knowledgable as it is an intolerance.

Five stars for their pizza...it is incredibly tasty. It was all I ate yesterday and my tummy was very upset afterwards.  I'll spare you the gory details...but it wasn't pretty.  

Went yesterday for lunch.  The lady who made my pizza barely spoke English.  She could not figure out if they were out of the 10"" or the 7"" pizza doughs.  She had to roll one out and guess. 

The place was almost empty at noon on a Sunday. There was only one other table occupied. 

$1.00 per additional topping is ABSURD.  My $8.99 pizza turned into a $16.00 pizza.  They insist that Neapolitan pizza ""tastes better with 3 or less toppings"".  Don't tell me how to live my life!!!!",VigsAph76fP7pechJ743EA,2,2,2,47eJagsPUwVQpC2Za6EtUA

It's different, but try it out because you will not be sorry. The only negative thing I can say is that there isn't one of these places in CA where we live. 

Tip: don't pike on the toppings and use the crust to soak up the juices and sauce.",BRo60kz5HcZOBdQJLkGXpQ,0,0,5,N8UqLWUNJsi9KdijhIlfHg

My husband ordered an eggplant Parmesan Sandwhich & just before he got up to the register they said "" sorry we're out of bread""'it was too late to order a pizza as we had along line behind us. The guy in line said to us "" they never have bread, I ask every time & haven't  been able to try the eggplant! "" Then we get over to the soda machine & the Dr. Pepper is out... My pizza was delivered and the one topping I asked for was missing. We had to send the Pizza back to the counter to add the one topping. it's clear that this place is very poorly managed and probably in financial trouble which is why they are lacking items on the menu. Just take the sandwiches off the menu if you can't fulfill the item! The bar area is a hot mess too & needs to be thrown out as they just pile & throw random crap on it as a storage area for misplaced items. 

It's a shame because the pizza is actually fantastic!!!! 

 Suggestion to management. As a business professional I of course understand you can't always be present. Invest in your restaurant by purchasing cameras so you can manage your business remotely when not present. Also hire someone who is old enough to have developed a strong work ethic it's all kids in there!!!!!  Clean up all the clutter & Keep making the great pizza because you do have loyal customers....",O9rxR9_ReC1ZE2v_CjFgVw,0,0,2,eZL7PpZF5J48TphVLdwDyQ

It's definitely Napoli style pizza. The less toppings the better. The fresh mozarella is really a nice touch... thought it's not overly flavorful, and sort of ""sticks"" to itself, rather than gets stringy when you bite into it.

If you're looking for a traditional Napol style pizza, this is a great choice. But for bringing the whole family and getting ""full""... not quite the place. It's a bit expensive. For two personal size pizza's with minimal toppings is was $30. 

I'm happy we went and tried it out... but it probably won't be our first pick when we're in the mood for pizza. Just because of out preferred pizza style (NY style). 

Oooh! Here's a GREAT thing though... they have Gelato that is to die for! Pistachio! YUM! And again, the people that work there are WONDERFUL!! Might be worth the trip just for the atmosphere.",pHmD00h2N9f_zzRwoUZWtQ,0,0,3,6WTDmVr_MhlBG3TFE1uKZw
