I go here probably 2 times a week lately because it is a good option for a healthy meal. I usually get the salad with brown rice, black beans, chicken, pesto sauce and salsa. I also like the option for a wheat tortilla. Guacamole is fresh and has always been good. Great food, great healthy options, good service.",nS4mcwbdFynSchOqtDhWsA,1,1,5,eJblydKi2ZVUQx9YRgTYTA

Like many other Americanized burrito joints, Zaba's offers a lot of the same.  You choose your protein, beans, rice, salsa, fillings, they roll, you eat.  I may be the only person to hate Chipotle, so if you're a fan you may like Zaba's as well.

My experience there wasn't all bad.  The place is clean, the staff friendly and happy to let you try one of the meats before choosing it in your burrito.  I don't think this is any better or worse than Chipotle or Qdoba, it's just that all these places are average at best.  

I went with the shredded beef tacos.  The beef was a little dry and not too flavorful, but the hot salsa and pico de gallo helped. 

I had the chicken nachos as well.  The queso sauce they use is salty and while many people will like it, I did not.

I ended up getting a chicken burrito w/ the potatoes, cheese, brown rice, salsa, & lettuce. The burrito was a very good size, maybe slightly bigger than what you would find at Chipotle. Bit in & expected awesomeness, totally not the case. It didn't have the same taste as Chipotle, then again it didn't taste fresh.

On 5-23-2013 I ate here with my son once again after approximately a year. They were short staffed, the poor guy who seemed like he was a supervisor was very nice, appologetic and worked as quickly as possible, great job there. Now for the food: WHAT A RIP OFF, they put about a tablespoon worth of chicken in my burrito. I said, ""Could you spare it?' Sarcastically of course, he relented and gave me a little more. I have been in the restaurant business for many years, yes, he is entitled to a profit, however, the cost to put a generous or fair amount of chicken in the burrito is minimal. At $7 a burrito he is making a huge profit with those portions. I don't think I will go back now, I have given them enough chances. For the rest of you suckers, pay attention to what they are doing. The only reason that I gave them two stars is because they do have good tasting food. After reading some,  other reviews I wanted to add to it. In one review it was mentioned at how much he was charged for a side of sour cream, once again, they are entitled to a profit, and like myself when they first opened, I used to eat there 2 to 3 times a week and then they nickle and dime you.

This place is kind of like the Subway of Mexican food. You pick your type of food (burrito/bowl), the type of wrapping (flour or corn tortilla), the meat you want, and they'll slide you on down the line as you pick your fixings.  I decided on a chicken burrito with a flour tortilla. I particularly appreciated that beans were not mandatory on my burrito and that sour cream was not extra.

All in all, it was pretty good. I felt like they were a little skimpy on the chicken, but all of the fixings were tasty and it was a sizable enough burrito.

My main man ordered the carnitas burrito [$6.49], same choices. The total came to $17 with a small soda & brownie :) 

The burritos seem bigger than the other burrito places, but tiny me never really finishes a fat burrito in one sitting :P Zaba's seems to have larger portions & more variety on their menu. OH & that brownie we ate was bomb. I don't wana say it's as thick as the rice crispy treats they have at starbucks, but it's maybe half that size? Still a big size if you ask me [yea, that's what SHE said].. Anyway ...

It doesn't seem as busy as the other signature gourmet Mexican grills, but I like Zaba's since they have healthier choices as far as the wheat & brown rice. They serve coke products & they have the tabasco sauces [jalapeno, smoked], also cholula! yum yumm.. Since it's in the same shopping area that LVAC is in, they probably have discounts for LVAC members. They also have their liquor license so they have domestic & Mexican beers.

I always order a salad with chicken. The awesome thing about Zaba's salads are that all of them come with guacamole, free of charge.

Afterwards, you choose the kind of rice, beans, vegetables or not, potatoes, salsa, and condiments you want to put on. My first time and possibly my usual includes a burrito with a whole wheat tortilla, brown rice, black beans, fajita vegetables, sweet potatoes, pico de gallo, corn, and cheese. They stuffed my burrito to say the least, which I have no complaints about! Their chips are actually very delicious and crispy. Not a bit of staleness in their chips and it is covered with a hint of lime. The added flavor makes the chips enjoyable to eat even by itself! They are much better than store bought tortilla chips. The best part is that they have a rewards program, one perk over Chipotle that will definitely make me come back, as well as for the sweet potato!

In all, the food itself does not match the quality or taste of Chipotle.

The two restaurants are very similar in the simplicity of their menus, but Zaba's just edges out the competition with the addition of some seafood options which I have yet to sample.

I have been to this location a handful of times and I have gotten the carne asada burritos and the pork burritos. I usually only grab a complimentary water cup with my order, and after stuffing the burritos with double-protein my total always ends up being around $11. It does seem a tad bit pricey, but the ingredients are fresh enough to warrant me shelling out the scrilla. They even offer two types of potatoes as ingredients to put inside the burrito. Typically after I grab my food and water I make sure to snag a bottle of the Chipotle Tabasco. Not sure why, but for some reason I go crazy for the stuff.

4341477,2009-11-09,9,gdtZA3sVQ5Hk-3oPBArdLA,"Zaba's Mexican Grill is a small chain of  convenient Americanized Mexican fast food eateries, all located in the Las Vegas area. There are about 5 -6 of them now.

Zaba's is like Chipotle, but browner. 

No, not browner as in darker Mexicans, ones with more indian blood than Spanish blood. Not at all. Browner because instead of white floured tortillas or white rice, they offer healthier brown. 

Zaba's concept is very similar to Chipotle, even the line and service process at the counter is similar. But Zaba's offers more variety. Such as brown rice, wheat tortillas, or fish and shrimp tacos or burritos. 

They also have a more colorful decor than the tin can aluminum decor of Chipotle. This one is also larger than most Chipotles, with booths and tables and about 2 to3 times the seating capacity.

I came here to order lunch for a group I was visiting in a nearby office, a lunch and learn session. They had faxed the order in, but the manager was so anal, he couldn't fill the order unless they used their official fax order form! WTF? He faxed back the official form and said he called. Meanwhile, I had talked to him several times about the order, and he didn't tell me this. So I had to call the office, confirm the order, and told him to fill in the blanks that weren't on the order. He had difficulty with this, being a bit OCD or something.

We finally got the order put together and delivered the food. It is pretty tasty, even when it is browner.",UVxY0iyPaqY7s4BSFtt-xA,11,10,3,KySMD6bdb38vCXtIhZVGXA

A word of caution: Red Sauce is reserved for satan himself, and while the green looks like a nice and comforting alternative, it will still make your ice water.

Each one has it's pro/con's, and while I like Zaba's it is my least frequented of them all.

I generally get the 3 steak taco's with just cheese and sour cream, as I am a very plain eater.  Zabas steak is nice and spicy, with lots of flavor.
As a HUGE fan of Qdoba's Chips and Queso I had high hopes for Zaba's - but I found their queso to resemble melted plastic with peppers in it. There was nothing
appealing about it at all to me.  My boyfriend really enjoyed it, but I did not.  The chips also lacked flavor and were just average.
I can't remember what burrito my boyfriend got, but he really enjoyed it.  I'd go back, but not spend the money on the Queso.

The service was great and the people were very nice, even though we came close to closing

You line up to order your food and they make your food to order as you move down the line. You pick the ingredients you want in your burrito, taco, etc....and you pay at the end of the line. I like it here because they have grilled chicken, veggies, brown rice, and other healthy ingredients. You can also get bowls if you don't want the wraps. The portions are more than enough. I can't even finish a burrito there. The tacos are also very good. You get a choice of soft or hard shells.

Location Overview:
This location can be found on S Grand Canyon and W Flamingo. This location is just as clean and the same when I left it 3 years ago.

Customer Service:
The customer service is always on point no matter who's working here and what time of day it is. Even getting out of an intense yoga class looking a mess I still get compliments.

Quality/Quantity:
The quality of the food is great. I do genuinely feel that this place and Chipotle sit at the same level. The food is great and the quantity of food is of course way more than enough.

Side Notes:
If Chipotle just isnt your thing.... check this out. *I like the queso from here more than Chipotle's*",e6FGtUMpBp18xfZOmpbw8w,0,1,4,2H2aO6MAu0lrBZIvJuBTfw

5075922,2010-04-09,1,gdtZA3sVQ5Hk-3oPBArdLA,"Finally made a trip here last night and enjoyed my chicken and pork burrito with queso sauce, sour cream, lettuce, cheese, brown rice and black beans on a WHEAT tortilla. I was waiting to see when one of these Mexican grill joints were going to start using some other types of tortillas... there are some great flavors out there. Seeing how Zabas is the only one I have been to that offers an option besides a white tortilla. They also had brown rice as an option besides white rice which was actually a nice change. The queso sauce here is not as good as Qdoba and they charge you extra for it here (which I don't believe Qdoba does) so that is a big reason for the -1 star. They charged me $1.25 for what rang up as a SM. QUESO for the half a scoop of queso sauce I asked for on my burrito.

Overall the burrito was good... very flavorful. A burrito with queso sauce and a regular drink ran me $10. Bit pricey but at least it was good. The decor is nice and it was very clean. The location is not that great for them and I'm sure it hurts business but once you get to it its worth a try.

Then the 3rd time it didn't taste as good as the first few times so I figured maybe it was a different cook or just a bad night. So I gave it another try and it ended up tasting bland and the chicken was disgusting with those nasty chewy pieces and the rice was hard. After that I was turned off and just don't have the desire to go back for now. Maybe eventually I'll give it another try.

5390432,2014-07-10,0,gdtZA3sVQ5Hk-3oPBArdLA,"In the age old war between Zaba's and Chipotle, Zaba's always wins out for me.  So much so that while the Eastern location which is closest to me is closed down in preparation of a new location opening soon, I drove all the way to this location instead of just settling for the Chipotle down the street.   That's partially not true as I was somewhat in the area before deciding to get some take-out for lunch, but it was definitely much less convenient than going the Chipotle route and dammit I still took it.

This location seemed much nicer aesthetically than any other Zaba's I've been to.   That's not to say that they usually aren't nice because they are, but something about this one just seemed a step ahead.   It was packed for lunch but the employees were on top of their game in within a few minutes I was out the door with a couple Zaba Bowls to go.   

I did my usual, a zaba bowl with brown rice, shredded beef, corn, green salsa, and lettuce.   It's about as healthy a meal I can put together at any of these fresh-mex joints that I can still enjoy.   I found it to be a good version of the same thing I've gotten 100 times at the Eastern location.   The shredded beef was nicely spiced (I've had it on occasion lack spiciness which I believe is due to it not being stewed long enough to soak it all in) and the veggies were fresh and as tasty as veggies can be.   My rice was a little mushier than I normally like it, so that was my only minor gripe.   I also shared a bag of chips and they were spot on as usual.   

A good value became even better recently with the introduction of the Zaba's reward card with which every 10 entrees purchased you get the 11th free.   Points are doubled on Sundays.   Since I go to the other location at least 2-3 times a week and buy for 2, I average a free entree every 2-3 weeks.   WHAT HAS CHIPOTLE DONE FOR ME LATELY?

They have served with a smile and could probably guess what we would order next. But I'm pretty much done. They have a new rude manager.

Food was as good as ever but of course not much of it. Chip bags have gotten even smaller, hard to imagine. Beans and meat portions are tiny.  Hello, the whole reason people come to Zaba's and pay that kind of money is to eat a little healthier, not  to load up on only carbs! Take away the protein and you take away the incentive. We ordered chips and salsa but never got the salsa. When my daughter went back up to ask for the pico they gave her a hard time saying they charge for it. She explained that we bought a side of chips and salsa and the girl got frustrated and gave it to her with an attitude. The green salsa we asked for was for the rice bowl. We wanted to put it on ourselves. So I guess you get attitude when you ask for the pico you paid for. It would be nice if the girl at the register understood English better and wasn't so rude, she's also new there. Not only that, when it's 25 bucks for only 2 people to eat, you would think it wouldn't be a problem to get your pico with your chips. Or for the people to be cordial. Screw this place, Zaba's the chincy, charge for huge portions, serve small portions with an attitude. They can take their new manager  and their new worker and ........... Keep your food I'll eat next door.

Although, I unfortunately had to subtract 2 stars because I felt so rushed by the workers!! I barely had time to think what I really wanted on my burrito. There wasn't anyone behind me in line and only two people in the place. You would think they could be a little more patient with me, especially since it was my first time there and I wanted to customize my meals perfectly. I even asked a couple times about the workers opinions of what she liked best and she laughed and said she didn't know...

It would be nice to have some more feedback from the employees here as well as not feel rushed and like I'm taking up to much of their time for my one order.

On the upside, it's close to the LVAC gym and you can definitely make healthy options here. I like their wide variety of sides and sauces. They even have sweet potatoes! I will be back and hope to see improvements in the future. :)",IDJcc7Su1CQE93BADym3Sw,2,0,3,rSUJGocH11fj0cFDA8J99w
