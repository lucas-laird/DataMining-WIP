There were other places to purchase liquid courage at the airport and I suggest you try them prior to settling down at this place.",6jEeCpNEU9l8CT9X566Oog,1,1,2,72j5sjTJKbveSmjGlh7svw

It's a very casual atmosphere with sports on the tvs. It's only 1 of 2 bars in Terminal 1 that allow smoking. This one is located in the B gate section and the only other is located in the C gate section. Cigarette smoking is allowed for paying patrons only. I would recommend it for anyone who wants to stop and have a quick beer and smoke.",4xMTfjgrL9fGkJexKlZcbA,0,0,4,EU5Ufdz2yScFyViNA4mjQg
