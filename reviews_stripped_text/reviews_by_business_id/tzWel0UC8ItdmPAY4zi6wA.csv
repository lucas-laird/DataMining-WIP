No jambalaya but didn't tell me when I ordered.  Mashed potatoes are watery.  Chicken cold.  I still don't have my apple pie and I'm done with my food.  I listened to a man complaining to the manager it supervisor on duty.  She gave excuses and told him to call her regional that she would tell him the same thing.  Poor guest skills.  Apologize show empathy and and see what you can do to make him happy.  Most only want to be heard.

When I got my order, the side rice was only filled halfway. ?!!  They also were out of napkins. I'm surprised this place even has chicken at this point. The guy that took my order was ok but everything else in this visit was unacceptable. This is why I'm never coming to this location ever again.

The reason I gave them a one star is because they have their own way of running their store. I asked if they have the TUESDAY SPECIAL and they said they don't, so I asked why not and they basically told me they just don't. I told them that if they were on the strip of Vegas I would understand that, because most most places they wouldn't have the special but they are off the strip. 

If you want to get the TUESDAY SPECIAL go to the one between Maryland Pkwy and Tropicana Ave. That Popeyes at least understand how to run their store and how it's suppose to be by the book and the rules.   Even though that other Popeyes is very busy they have good customer service not like this new place I drove by next to 99 cent store and will never go to that one. 

This Popeyes I bet don't even care. With this type of reviews his business location will not survive. Not so good luck to you so far.  I'm gonna make sure everyone in my twitters and Facebook peps will be notified.",iCu-ywfSK_ykCJss5wfd0g,1,0,1,LHqfOrRrW-TMvr4OYAh9hg

The spicy chicken was cold and all dried out, and tasted terrible. The mild chicken was not cold or dried out, but had zero flavor...it's almost as if they did not use any seasoning at all.
