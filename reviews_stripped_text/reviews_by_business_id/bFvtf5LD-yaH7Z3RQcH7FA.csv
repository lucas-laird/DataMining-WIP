We where immediately greeted as we walked in by the employee making the pizza's which was a nice touch. We then found our way to the counter where the girl took our order, they where out of a few things and let us know what we could substitute instead to make it taste just as great so that was nice of them. They did take a little longer to make the pizzas but they only had one guy making them and he was actually the manager so he was busy cooking and training the other staff, so for that reason I understand why it took a little longer.

Overall a good dominos near my house where the staff is nice and friendly and they have tables inside so if you chose to eat inside you can as well.",c5tvQ7RYTYd8BQ1VMqVqNw,1,2,5,wqgKvyUI1Ofz0DYMD0Dddw

They took over a vacant building in the Albertsons shopping center and I love watching new things open up there as I have lived in this neighborhood for several years now and seen a lot of businesses come and go. 

The service is always fast and friendly. This particular Domino's is always super clean. Plus, it's hard not to like Domino's because if you don't want to wait, you don't have to. Just order through the phone or even better, order through their app and the Domino's Tracker will keep you updated on the status of your order so you are not waiting aimlessly in the store. They also have a tablet where you can check in to just click on your name, which streamlines the process even more. They've always got my order correct and it's piping hot and fresh. It can get a little pricey at times, but if there's a good deal going on, I will try to pop over there.",l--K3xQWVqs93iFhAoEYag,2,1,5,iDKjIECxj7H89iwS7cBhyw

Open kitchen, very clean & there were lots of employees hard at work. The guy at the counter was very nice, answered all my questions & even have us coupons for future use. 

Looking forward to ordering again",eia3TgoWykyZ_KVlnkYAjw,1,1,5,bvfOgY4PjEq053XoRYvoRQ

They are friendly., Welcoming and not once have I gone inside and see a stink face.  This location is prompt. The pizzas are always well done , tasty and never have had an issue with my order.  The bf and I ordered 3 large pizzas for today's big event( super bowl ) I literally saw 4 employees walking out with pizzas to be delivered with 3 more cars parked outside for more deliveries.  Awesome to see that this location is doing well.  You guys are doing great! My go to spot for pizza.",HydOxLMDk6yEV0PT8HVYLQ,1,1,5,28O8BLyf0j-ZNZGEjLeUJw

Swimming and sitting pool side really brings out the hunger in someone when the novelty of the sun wares down. Pizza is one of the  best ways to aid in those cravings and delivery is the only means. Dominos pizza was the choice of the majority since they were open on this Memorial Day holiday and continue to have great pizza at competitive prices.

I ordered for us all online which was such a simple means of ordering. The Dominoes tracker allows the customer to track their pizza order in somewhat really time. One can change the tracker to one of many different types, but my favorite is the island parrot that produced sounds of waves and cocktails while it tracks the progress of your pizza order. 

The pizza was superior and delicious. We ordered two thin crust and two regular crust pizzas to feed everyone. I took advantage of the deal they offered on line of $5.99 with the purchase of three or more items each is this great sale price. We ordered just pizzas and our fourth pizza with two toppings was $5.99 too. With combinations of bacon and pepperoni or feta and mozzarella these are some of the topping choice we mixed it up with. Now with the tracker telling me that pizza is here it is time for eating.",I-4KVZ9lqHhk8469X9FvhA,21,19,5,kM0n5mtP-X3CPO8FTAoXUA

Still tasted delicious with LOTS of toppings! Keep up the great work Dominos!!!",M24-ymMUJceQs8N4g7njmA,0,0,5,dFxmam0VjwzQOAaoCxV3LA
