I ordered the double meat chicken salad.. once again i'm mystified about the ""chopped"" part of the chopped salad.  please dont use some type of medieval torture device to mutilate the salad greens and ingredients. what happened to a nice layered salad the purchaser gets to mix up and destroy for themselves? 

It seems in this are that the language barrier is always a challenge, I understand people try, and this is fast food, but clear communication would make this a slightly smoother process.  Overall i cant complain too much since my order was correct.  The only thing that i think Subway should work on is their chicken and egg.. it appears the egg and egg white parts of sandwiches and wraps are pre-made and really not appetizing.. this also goes for the chicken that is pre-sliced, with ""grill marks"" and they are all the exact same size.   I know this isn't a store level thing, but step up will you Subway?",S2k4IW5l8s0pz6kIQTJBbA,2,2,2,BIRcH3ZD5n0RvRR2ny9ytQ
