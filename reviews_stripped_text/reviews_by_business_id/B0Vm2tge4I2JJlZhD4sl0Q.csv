I sat at the bar with my party. I was informed by the bartender that I shouldn't eat at the bar and was instructed to get a bar table. WTF?. ok I guess.... very rude far.

Yes, we are wow'd by the advertising of most of the large restaurants in Las Vegas, but why follow the advertising dollars? Follow the palate, and the good service!   I would have never thought of going off the strip to experience fine dining, but I have  found 35 Steaks + Martinis to be the quintessential example of a fine dining restaurant without the stuffiness of the staff & patrons.  This is my second visit to this restaurant, and General Manager, Mario Gonzales gave my friends and I a wonderful welcome to the restaurant.  His knowledge base on food and wine recommendations are off the chain. He came by and introduced himself to the table and greeted us all with a warm smile and charisma.  His waiter staff provided very good service to the table as well.  The menu was well rounded in it offerings, and for a person that is extremely picky...I caught myself being mesmerized by the food and wine paring recommendations and letting it ride.  I frequent Las Vegas and have visited several establishments, and it is not often I leave a restaurant and say to myself ...""This was worth it.."" but, I can can with certainty and conviction this restaurant offers a culinary experience above most, and I would challenge you to see for yourself.  The bottom line..the staff understands what it takes to provide a wonderful culinary experience, and you should plan on visiting 35 Steaks + Martinis to see for yourself.  Viva Mario & the entire staff!!!!!

My girlfriend and i waited at the bar as they got our booth ready (it was not set up yet). So we figured to try one their martinis. As we waited at the bar and sipped away on a quite remarkable pepper martini; one their creepy execs came up and tried hitting on us. He offered to comp our drinks. We told him no because we didn't want to feel like we owed him. He comped them anyways. Ladies stay away from Harold. Ewwww.

We got sat and noticed that the place was a ghost town. I think we were the only table in the place at the time (9pm). Our server (a nice and knowledgeable guy with spikey hair and glasses) was very helpful. The only weird thing was he had another person following  him that was neither training or working...just getting drinks. WEIRD!!!!

We ordered the tomahawk chop and a shellfish platter. IT TOOK FOREVER!!!!!!!!!!!!

the shellfish smelled like it was going bad on the spot.

We couldn't find a manager in sight. I thought we were the only people there. The server and his follower weren't there. 

steak came out underdone and too salty.

832273,2013-04-11,0,B0Vm2tge4I2JJlZhD4sl0Q,"We like to go to 35 Steaks + Martini's at the Hard Rock Hotel Casino for dinner. We can go loud, have a few drinks, dinner, and laugh a lot, or we can go quiet and romantic with a bottle of wine and a long slow dinner. So, when we decided to have a ""Celebration"" party for family and friends, it was the first place we thought of to provide everyone with a good time.

We used the vast knowledge of Manager Servando, Assistant Manager Melissa, Chef Steve, and Waiter Joe to orchestrate a dinner party for Tuesday night, (04/02/2013). Our party would take over the upper-level area of the restaurant for the 43+ locals and East Coast folks. We decided to have cocktails with an appetizer buffet from 7 to 7:30 PM and then a sit-down dinner with a choice of five entrees. Side dishes would be served family style so everyone could try the various offerings. Bottles of red and white wine were available on each table. That way, our guests could partake as they wished. 

Since the beautiful bar area with 35 Steaks + Martini's Master Mixologists was only a few feet away we allowed for an open bar during our entire evening. It should be noted that we provided a stand-by car service and insisted that our guests avail themselves of it or a room at the Hard Rock if for any reason, they were unable to drive. We didn't have a problem as our regional friends had all named ""Designated Drivers"". Our out of the area family and friends used the great local taxi system for easy access to and from the Hard Rock.

All the food that was placed on our tables was fresh, hot, and high quality. Everyone ate hot food at the same time. Are you shocked by that? The Waite Staff here are serious professionals. With Joe leading, everyone worked hard to make our event like something fit for royalty. We had staff assigned to our party yet, we noticed that other members would come and help serve and clean up when they were not taking care of the customers in the lower (public) area. The Servers here really work as a team.

The restaurant provided a guitar player who also sang while our party was going on. He was actually in the bar area for all to hear. The added entertainment was really nice.

After dinner, there were pots of coffee and tea put out and desserts for everyone. Chef Steve and his staff worked extra hard on the amazing assortment of mini delights that tempted every sweet tooth. 

Our entire dinner party of three hours was a fine success. Servando and Melissa take their work seriously. They were always watching and changing the operation to fine tune our party. I will use 35 Steaks + Martinis again for our next affair, and we will continue to go to this great restaurant at the Hard Rock for a ""night out"".",3WHmc6WQ_jk_fIp-dJDKyA,1,1,5,Dwwl2N7KF4wSsb-ufF5GRQ

the GF and I opted to use the $200 comp at 35 steak + martini's.  

Nice looking restaurant.  In the bar/lounge area they had an acoustic guitarist playing some great music we could hear at our table.

We passed on the martini's and other ""old school"" cocktails listed on the menu.  I went with a Fat tire beer ( $8 ) as the gf was still shivering from the cold so a coffee/baileys ( $8)  props for providing a large separate container of the bailey's to add at her leisure to the coffee.

We ordered :

The Wedge with extra blue cheese dressing and blue cheese crumbles ($11)
Rossini ( rib eye steak topped with foie gras and black truffle demi ) White Cheddar Gratin($59)
NY Strip topped with blue cheese ( $43 - can't recall what they charged for the added blue cheese ) 
Lobster tail ($35)
Mac n Cheese ( $8)
Salt and vinegar fries ( $8)

The highs :

Rossini - perfectly cooked, coated with what we believed was black truffle and mushroom - great taste.  And a nice chunk of foie gras !!!

Lobster tail - large tail yet tender and perfectly cooked.

Lows :

Mac and cheese - you can tell they haphazardly mixed the elbow mac with the cheese sauce and did not thoroughly bake it.  cheese sauce flavor ok but overall, substandard.

The wedge - the lettuce was partially frozen but the blue cheese crumbles were delicious.

Service was above average at the beginning of the meal but fell off around dessert since the dining room was at their peak occupancy.

We ended the meal with the ""king"" of desserts ( inspired by Elvis ) Chocolate mouse, peanut butter mousse, chocolate coating with a banana ice cream ( $10) - the mousse was amazing.  

Overall a decent meal but in a town of stellar steakhouses, the 35 is somewhat run of  the mill .

The food wasn't bad, but it didn't deliver on the promise of its great ingredients. Two sliders -- ahi poke and beef tartare -- but they both were surprisingly bland. I had a glass of pinot noir, and my husband had the free drink: a Bombay gin martini. It's sad that the free drink was the best thing we sampled, but it was.

Two gents sitting beside us were dining off the full menu, with steaks and asparagus. Their meat seemed awfully overcooked, but maybe they ordered it that way. (Suckers, if that's the case.) Our waitress was friendly and offered plenty of insider tips to our out-of-town neighbors.

We got the 3 course meal which on paper was great. We chose the Salumi platter as an app and won't order it again. The watery french onion soup smelled of rotten cheese and sweaty socks. After sampling and enduring it's smell we requested that it be immediately exiled from the table. I had the wedge which was just unassuming. Not even worth writing about actually. 

The Filet was tasty. Cooked correctly and nicely seasoned, which amplified the flavor. I could cut the Filet with a fork it was so tender. Use the chimichurri mixture to elevate the steak. The cauliflower gratin was a complete disappointment. Actually, it was an utter failure! You ever keep tasting something just to make sure you tasted correctly? I kept doing that and every time I was surprised it was that bad. The cheese sauce was watery and the whole dish lacked depth of flavor. It was the low-fat version of a basterdized  classic French dish.  I expected much more. The asparagus was perfect, but I half expected them to bring us the woody stems. 

The service was great, but the server recommended a terrible sounding artichoke app., which was brought to us when we ordered the Salumi. The cucumber and gin drink was crisp and refreshing. Also, they have a martini happy hour (bar only) where 7-10 martinis are about $7. They aren't your typical martinis, but a list of reasons why you never drink martinis with more than two ingredients.

We started with lobster escargot - combination of flavors, presentation,etc.. This appetizer was perfect. I ended up asking for more bread to pick every bit of garlic butter left..
Next octopus and fillet carpaccio- how in a world would somebody come up with ideas of stuffing octopus inside fillet and then seare them together? I guess talented chefs do. Delissios!!
 As a main dish we shared waggui ribeye, which was served with mushrooms,  mashed potatoes, creamed spinach and variety of sauses. Simply perfect!

Of course we could not finish our steak. I was contemplating if we should take leftovers home,  but could not come with the idea what I could make out of leftover steak without ruining it. Chefs Michael and Marty gave me  great suggestions! We had delissios lunch next day!
 They both  are extremely talented chefs,  and they run an exceptional establishment.

The food: all of our steaks (4)were dry as a bone.  I am not sure if they were overcooked or if it was the salt rub on them or both, but they were really dry.  I ordered rare, but the steak i got was medium at best.  I sent it back and received a new steak that was maybe medium rare, but still not right.  At this point i decide to just eat it.   I expect so much more from a steak house, and even at the $100 for two deal i would not eat here again.

The service:  Its as though we didn't exist.  It took a while before i could get the waitress' attention and send back my steak.  Also our drinks went empty for quite some time before being noticed.   the host was also snotty when we mentioned travelzoo.  *if you hate the deal then dint have it!   I would have tipped a good amount on the fully value of the voucher had the service not been so horrendous.

Overall with badly cooked steaks and horrible service there is no way i would go back.  There are simply too many good restaurants in Vegas to waste your time trying this one.

1624303,2017-05-17,3,B0Vm2tge4I2JJlZhD4sl0Q,"Everyone knows I eat at a lot of steak houses. I spent the day at rehab pool party in the hard rock hotel. After rehab me and my cousin made reservations at 35 Steakin martinis. Reservations were for dinner. I believe this is the only steakhouse located in the hard rock hotel. 

We arrived at 35 steak some martinis five minutes before our reservations my cousin would not stop flirting with the host so that took some extra time. She was very nice and accommodating. She brought us to a table and introduced us to our waiter. After we met the waiter I looked around and I saw that there was nobody else inside of the steakhouse except for staff. When I'm telling you there was nobody inside of this restaurant except for the staff I am not kidding. We were the only customers inside of the steakhouse there wasn't even a single person at the bar. I leaned over to my cousin and I told him do you think it's weird that there's nobody else but us in here. He just laughed. Anyways our waiter was extremely nice and knowledgeable. 

For the food. First our waiter brought us this freshly baked bread which was really good. It was a loaf that was in a cast iron skillet I had never seen that before when they bring bread to your table at a steakhouse. Our waiter did warn us to be careful because the cast iron was hot. Then our waiter brought us a complementary items from the chef it was a yellow tomato stuff with the cream cheese filling. I thought it was good but my cousin wasn't a fan. Me and my cousin both ended up getting the tomato bisque which was very flavorful and creamy. For our main course me and my cousin both Ordered the big filet mignon with mashed potatoes and a side of green beans. My cousin asked for his well done and it was well done I asked for my medium and it was medium. The mashed potatoes were really good as well and the green beans had a good crunched of them.  I was still full from lunch and the tomato bisque and bread was a lot so I only ate half of my filet mignon. For dessert me and my cousin both are the crème brûlée. The chef then brought us out a complimentary tasting of some sort of housemate sherbet it was really good. 

About halfway through our meal there were a couple of people that started coming in. By the time we left there was probably five or six tables that were full for steakhouse that's not really a lot. The total price ended up being about 230 bucks for the two of us you deafly can get a better bang for your buck at A chain steakhouse like Morton's or Smith and will Linsky's. I figured I would give this place a try and I wasn't disappointed. 

Overall 35's and steak some martinis was actually really good the fact that there was nobody inside of the steakhouse when we arrive did scare me but the food was very good if there is one thing that made the experience it was definitely the waitstaff they were very pleasant and accommodating. If you're in the hard rock and you want to indulge a little bit give 35 steaks a try.",s6lIsLlPcjaHDhXxTV9kKQ,3,4,4,TMZfVq2MkhgzGhEjGLTOeQ

Started off ordering a whiskey sour, was not made correctly, no cherries and bad mix.  Sat down for dinner with 5 of us.  They brought out the seafood platter appetizer with shrimp, lobster, oysters and snow crab legs.  The oysters were just OK, the remainder was basically tasteless, tasted frozen then thawed.  I ordered the bone in filet medium rare, it came out raw and flavor wasn't that good, the guy next to me ordered the filet, pink, it came out raw.  He sent it back and by the time p it came back almost everyone had finished their meal.  That was ok,as the size of his filet was about the size of a pink pong ball.  I also ordered Caesar salad which was so salty I didn't finish it.  I asked for anchovies on the side and they didn't have any.   They didn't offer tap water only bottled water and we had to ask for refills.  It was very difficult to discuss any business as the hard rock music was blaring overhead and we could not even have a conversation so after dinner we tried to find a quiet spot on property to discuss our business which was difficult to find. We ended up scheduling a meeting the next day offsite to meet so we could actually hear each other.

Steakhouses and seafood joints are my favorite to visit, and my favorite out of those, is 35 Steak and Martini.

Let me start by saying that while the pricing is your standard fine dining, the experience and the food is not.  A lot of the time when I go out to fine dining, everything is so fancy and so refined and just seems a little too ""the portions are really small and have ingredients I've never heard of, and it's expensive so it must be good.""  I want to recognize at least one thing in a dish...or at the very least have heard of it before.  Don't get me wrong, I love trying new things, but it was extremely refreshing to familiarize with a lot of the appetizers...and I wanted to try it all!!!  One day I might go in and just eat all of the appetizers and nothing else. 
The steaks are phenomenal. Always tender and juicy and cooked how I order it, and it's usually more than I can finish, even a filet!
I don't know if you saw the photos of the desserts, but OMG. The chocolate peacock cake. No, it's not made out of peacock, but the chocolate/sugar decor slightly resembled a peacock tail to me so I just keep referring to it as such lol. 
I could literally go on and on about the cozy booths, the killer bar, the amazing food, but really you just need to check it out for yourself.",YyGhWvyw6mjJFICgq7rUxg,4,2,5,I21dvXsHQ1vPqzCfSaHUtA

They were kidding when they boast about having 35+ martini  concoctions!!! Under each martini name, there's a description of what's mixed in the drink. So whatever you're craving for, I'm sure you'll find it there. 

For our 4 course prixe fix menu, I started off with a cesar salad. My boyfriend chose a wedge salad. 
Next  thing was the lobster bisque. This was alright. I've had better lobster bisque elsewhere. (Aquaknox still tops that list.) 

For our main course we ordered:
John Dory: quinoa, cherry heirloom tomatoes, sauce Persillade, potato strings.
8 oz. filet mignon: summer vegetable bouquet, potato puree, onion confit, red wine essence.

Dessert was a pretty big sized bowl of Creme brulee, almonds, crisp caramel, berries.

Nice looking restaurant. Ambiance was romantic with dimmed lights and soft, jazzy music playing. Service was a little spotty. They started great as they were very attentive to us. But towards the end....it felt like they gave up. Our take-out boxes took awhile to be brought to us, creme brulee also took awhile as well as the check. It's like they forgot about us or something....even though we sat in the center section of the restaurant. 

Not a fan of The Hard Rock Hotel simply because of the clientele.

Grey goose dry with olives: strong and yummy 

Raspberry saketini: sweet and yummy

French onion soup, 35 hour caramelized onions, brioche, gruyere gratin: fairly delicious 

Fresh tomato soup: yummy

Field greens, candied pecans, teardrop tomatoes, mustard pretzel croutons: very delicious 

Salmon: head-on white shrimp, French fingerling potatoes, fennel, spicy tomato jus: very very yummy 

Filet mignon, 10 oz center cut: OK, hubby wasn't impressed 

New York strip, 14 oz center cut: fairly delicious 

Iced shellfish platter, seasonal crab legs, giant shrimp, oysters, and main lobster with house made sauces: fresh, delicious with sauces, loved the lobster 

Sides: black truffle asparagus, sautéed mushrooms, very delicious

Last evening, while sitting at the nearly empty bar, I received exceptional service and a very well prepared meal.

The food:  The 8 oz filet was cooked to my liking perfectly and was very tender and seasoned just the right amount.  No steak sauce required!  Success!  Steamed dry asparagus was crisp and served in a plentiful amount; a quick dash of salt and pepper made this perfect.  The baked mac n cheese was a solid side dish consisting of large elbow pasta cooked perfectly and smothered in baked cheese.  The bread basket was so-so; maybe some work here but nothing to get all fired up about.  The drink selections are fairly abundant however I had a hard time selecting a beer to enjoy, but that's just me being a beer snob.

The service:  Always great service at the bar...no experience with the dining room.  The bartender who is usually there, the one with just a few too many tats to work at stuffier locations, is always happy to see me and provides great service.

The hubby & I always do ""date night"" with a nice dinner & dancing the Saturday we arrive. We'd last dined at the Hard Rock a couple of years ago prior to attending the Santana concert, when this place was known as Rare 120. We had a great experience then & figured we'd return. Unfortunately, along with the name & decor change came a serious decline in service. We arrived 5 minutes early for our 9 p.m. dinner reservation & were told we couldn't be seated due to the fact that we were early. I mentioned to the hostess that we were only 5 minutes early & asked at what time should we return. That's when she said they were behind & it would be at least 20 minutes. She seemed distracted & turned & left without offering to have us wait in the bar nor mentioning how they would be notifying us when our table was ready. We waited a few minutes more & when she returned my husband asked her if we could sit at the bar, at which point I had already decided we would wait in the bar, as there was clearly availabe seating there. Once we were sitting in the bar area, my husband asked if I'd like to eat there. I said no, that I hadn't made a reservation for the restaurant to have to sit in the bar. I also wasn't sure they'd let us order off the regular menu if we sat there. Long story short, we should have probably just stayed in the bar as the dinner service was atrocious.

35 Steaks and Martinis used to be called Rare 120, which had a happy hour on select days and I enjoyed myself a couple of times there. It was never as good as 35 Steaks + Martinis, though! hands down my favorite happy hour in Vegas thus far! They offer 8 $5 martinis, so there's guaranteed to be something for everyone in that mix, as well as several beers and wines by the glass for $5. The happy hour menu also includes 9 appetizers for $5 each.

Drinks: 
Pink Dragon (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/35-steaks-martinis-las-vegas?select=DhJBa7UcMIWmNrknuuz_tQ#K4QHZqhzm7TfR10vDJd_Vg): Belvedere Pink Grapefruit vodka, red chili, lemongrass, mint, mandarin juice, lemon juice - AMAZING & SPICAAAY! This drink almost knocked me off my bar stool and I was instantly alive again (I usually hit a low around 5pm after all those pool cocktails and sun exposure). This martini was so good that I didn't even want to drink anything else. I had 3 of those and was in very good spirits (= I stumbled out of there after telling the bartender that I loved her) after happy hour. 

Minted Man (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/35-steaks-martinis-las-vegas?select=DhJBa7UcMIWmNrknuuz_tQ#ezc-wijtpaIQ8MRh2OE82Q): Ketel One, fresh lime juice, fresh mint, simple syrup - refreshing, but I couldn't taste too many flavors in this martini since the Pink Dragon's fresh chilis had already set my mouth ablaze. Should probably start with this one next time. 

Food:
Dayboat Scallop and Ahi Poke (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/35-steaks-martinis-las-vegas?select=DhJBa7UcMIWmNrknuuz_tQ#z0-8AVQR0e-L1VL3nYWqIg): wasabi, sweet soy, crispy won ton chips - amazing silky texture with both the ahi and the scallops, the won tons were crispy but not greasy, this was a delicious and sophisticated appetizer.

Cheese Dip with Pretzel Rolls (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/35-steaks-martinis-las-vegas?select=DhJBa7UcMIWmNrknuuz_tQ#JHhdyl62MmfzT1VrewoxmA): Vermont white cheddar, gruyere, newcastle, served with warm little pretzel rolls: Who doesn't love dipping carbs into melted cheese? The dip was explosive in flavor thanks to the aged cheese varietals and the rolls were crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. Great to soak up all that booze!

Applewood Bacon Wrapped Dates (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/35-steaks-martinis-las-vegas?select=DhJBa7UcMIWmNrknuuz_tQ#YWAG7x5neSk2gtvD0uxYDQ): almond stuffed and topped with sauce bordelaise - I had such high hopes for this dish, but it just did not deliver. The bacon was chewy (instead of crispy) and the dates were overcooked giving the dish a super mushy texture. The sauce bordelaise was great, but we sent this back after trying a bite as it just wasn't prepared properly.

Sweet Chili Chicken Lettuce Wraps (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/35-steaks-martinis-las-vegas?select=DhJBa7UcMIWmNrknuuz_tQ#n3NWjBItqyeiMPMNrQrzLg): candied pecans, fresh mint, scallions, crispy noodles -  there was a great spice kick to the chicken and all the flavors and textural contrasts worked really well together. This was a winner!

Black Truffled Deviled Eggs - the truffle flavor complimented the hard boiled eggs really well, but I wish the yolk mash would have been a little creamier.

Heirloom Tomato Basil Brushetta: tomato, basil, garlic, olive oil, grilled baguette - the bread had a perfect crunch to it and the garlic and basil notes were great, but I wish there would have been more tomato topping on all of the pieces, it was spread very scarcely. I ended up pushing the mixture to one half of each baguette slice and left the rest of the bread on the plate. 

Vegas calls for gluttony, so we had to have dessert and went with the ""The King"" of Desserts (inspired by Elvis Presley) (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/35-steaks-martinis-las-vegas?select=DhJBa7UcMIWmNrknuuz_tQ#DhJBa7UcMIWmNrknuuz_tQ): caramelized bananas on a crunchy peanut crust with peanut butter ice cream and topped with chocolate covered bacon - this was simply awesome! The bananas, peanut butter, chocolate, and bacon components all worked in harmony to create a fun and hearty dessert!

Our bartender, called Sunshine, was amazing and made great drinks and stayed on top of everything the while night. She remembered me when I came back solo the next evening and delivered wonderful service again.

Food was par, two steaks had to be sent back for being under cooked. Then came back charred so we didn't even eat it.  Our server seemed irritated that we wanted our checks split. He eventually dropped split checks upon our request and didn't return to pick them up for 15mins. Once he did pick them up he was gone for probably 25-30mins. We saw him multiple times walking around after picking up our checks treating other tables much nicer than he was treating us...but maybe if we were ordering the expensive champagne by the bottle like they were he would have acknowledged us more.

The steak was around 1"" thick which makes it a bit difficult to keep the middle medium-rare, and expectedly the steak was a bit more chewy that I like a medium-rare steak to be. The sautéed mushrooms were a combination of shitake as well as others and paired very nicely with the steak. The mac'n cheese was creamy and had a nice flavor that help smooth out the steak a bit. I was drinking vodka sodas with lime (Grey Goose) and the waitress kept'em coming, so that was much appreciated!

3888329,2011-11-22,4,B0Vm2tge4I2JJlZhD4sl0Q,"Let's make the difference between strip restaurants and off-strip restaurants clear.

Strip restaurants have a captive audience who usually don't leave the casino.
Strip restaurants revenue-share with the casino in exchange for valuable foot-traffic real estate.
Because of this, they can and need to charge high prices for food and beverages. 

Off-strip restaurants do not have a captive audience. Either they attract locals, or they attract tourists who can travel away from the casinos. 
Off-strip restaurants need to work harder to attract a clientele than strip restaurants do.
Because of this, they must offer something that strip restaurants do not. 

The thing that works the best is the equation of: 
Food and beverage as-good-as strip restaurants + a meaningfully lower price = business.

That gives us some extraordinary off-strip restaurants like The Barrymore, Vintner Grill and Lotus of Siam, plus scores of restaurants in Chinatown, to mention a few.

I'm sad to say that this ""Vegas restaurant business 101"" strategy has been entirely lost on 35 Steaks.
Their prices are as high, and in some cases, higher than strip steakhouses, and the quality of meat is lower. The menu even makes it clear that some of their beef selections are ""choice"" and not ""prime""; in other words, meat any of us can buy at a good butcher shop, not the best cuts reserved mostly for high-end restaurant buyers.

I had the ""Rossini"" which is a nice piece of center rib-eye with some foie gras on top. I ordered it medium-rare bu it came out medium-well. Usually when a kitchen gets a steak wrong, it's a matter of one level; medium-rare to medium for example. Two levels off is simply shameful for a ""high-end"" steakhouse.

The Hard Rock has enough trouble attracting people away from the strip, what with their casino being about the size of a video arcade, and an oddly claustrophobic layout. 
What would possess them to open a restaurant that has little or no chance of attracting diners away from the dozens of other choices that are better and in many cases less expensive?

Ya got me. 
Which is more than I can say for 35 Steaks + Martinis.",yi_4YTVS6XL7s5atKPbmpA,3,0,2,KZQ8YTTQ91LHErUaEBc4DA
3970032,2015-06-19,4,B0Vm2tge4I2JJlZhD4sl0Q,"*** Review is for Restaurant Week 2015 menu ***

I had a show at 7 PM a few miles away and this seemed a good place for dinner with its 5 PM opening.  I was seated immediately and given a choice by the hostess as to which place I wanted to sit.  I opted for a two top table along the wall with a view of some of the pool area and some of the main part of  the restaurant.

The beginning service was a little slow.  It took awhile for the server to come to take my order and then there was a very long wait for the first course to come out--almost a half hour.  In addition, I saw other tables get an amuse-bouche but none was brought to me.  I assumed it wasn't part of the RW service.  Later, when I looked at my bill, the first item was an amuse-bouche listed at $0.00 as RW week menus generally do.

Edit:  I forgot when I wrote this to talk about the bread.  After ordering, you're brought a crock of bread topped with parmesan cheese and garlic.  It's a good sized piece of bread that's been scored for cutting.  It is not served with butter which is something they should do.  The top is flavored nicely.  The rest is bread that needs butter.

I ordered the heirloom tomato and ciliegine with greens and finished off with some tomato juice.  Not red tomato juice but the juice that comes from tomatoes when you cut them not crush them with pulp and skins.  The fresh mozzarella was very good.  This was a nice summer salad with refreshing ingredients.

My main course was the petit filet.  I ordered it blue.  The server looked at me and I explained I wanted it extra, extra rare.  He said, ""In other words, 30 seconds on each side.""  That was fine with me.  That's the way the steak was cooked.  Just a little brown on the exterior and a cool interior that was almost raw.  Perfect.  The filet was served on potato purée and had an assortment of summer squash.

There was no choice for the dessert course.  It was what they call a dreamsicle white chocolate mousse with tangerine gelée and rosemary scented streusel.  The mousse had a texture more like a light cheesecake than mousse but it was flavorful.  The tangerine gelée added a dimension of flavor to the dish and the streusel crunchies were a good texture.  It actually tasted like pieces of granola.

Except for the initial wait for my order taking and for the salad, service was good.  The couple of gentlemen that waited on my table were very friendly.  We chatted about other restaurants in Las Vegas and compared thoughts about one of them.  My iced tea was refilled without asking.  After awhile, I stopped looking at my watch because I knew I would make my show on time.  For a time, I was tapping my foot because I was uncertain about my time constraints.

The restaurant is a very pleasant place and the view of the young people at the pool was more than a pleasant diversion.  I'll have to come back and try the place with the traditional menu.  I am glad that they did something different with the Restaurant Week menu.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,8,7,3,rVJ8625ikclJyWwvoaXu0A

But I did stop in for what I thought would be a great martini.

Service was fine, I had a quiet seat at the bar.

But, this martini bar has a selection of only 4 major market gins, which is awfully lean.  I ordered a gin martini (not dry) and got gin shaken with ice, no vermouth.  At least I was asked whether I wanted the blue cheese olives or regular.  Although the olive pick didn't clear the rim of the glass.

I'm sure the signature cocktails are fine, but that martini was evidence of an overall unserious attitude towards martinis.  Which would be excusable, if the restaurant didn't use ""martini"" in its name. 

 I was a little disappointed and confused.",U8f06vx7p7ttV6MgxSLCyw,1,0,2,JEG5wW0XzrvU_3VVCOeP1w

The service was incredibly slow. We had a group of 6 and waited an hour and a half for our food. They weren't slammed or busy. Nobody apologized for the wait and we literally had to flag down a food runner at some point to ask if our food was almost ready. Needed a refill on my $14 cocktail for awhile but that never happened.

When our food finally arrived, it was lackluster at best. I got a New York strip steak. It was just plopped on a plate by itself, no garnish or anything. It was sooooo chewy and rubbery. I was working up a sweat trying to cut through it with my knife. I've had a bad steak or two in my life but when I'm paying $43 for just a steak, no sides, I expect a great cut of meat. I couldn't even finish it. No one in my party was overly impressed with the food. My foodie friend ordered scallops with forbidden rice but they served the dish with regular rice hoping she wouldn't notice. She's not an idiot. She called them out and they stammered and flailed saying they just ran out. Why wouldn't they just tell her that beforehand? She would have ordered something else. My other friend ordered a side of asparagus and they weren't cooked properly and ended up being hard and bitter.

Every single one of us felt gross after we left. The greasy sub par quality food just sat in our stomach like a brick and we ALL ended up paying for it later. (Sorry but we did!)

When I opt for fine dining, I expect to pay higher prices for the entire experience. Paying as much as we did for what we got felt like a total rip off.

This steakhouse wasn't really on my radar until I saw a deal on Groupon. I have a steakhouse obsession and decided I had to grab the deal since good steakhouses rarely offer Groupons.

We arrived at 6:00 on a Friday evening with a reservation. The restaurant was starting to fill up so I think the reservation was a good idea. This restaurant was a bit of a walk from the self parking garage which is to be expected at a casino. We also had to pass a taco place and my husband tried to ditch me for tacos instead. 

The vibe of the restaurant is definitely hip and not a stuffy steakhouse. One wall of the restaurant gives a view into an outside area with views of one of the pool areas. There was also live music playing inside the restaurant. I'd hope so at the Hard Rock. The tables for two along the glass window were spaced pretty close together. I was definitely making sure that any conversation topic discussed was something I'd want any/everyone else to hear.

As soon as we were seated someone came around with a plate of raw steaks to show us the different options. Our waiter took good care of us with drink refills and checking in regularly. He didn't have any issue with us using a Groupon. 

The Groupon was a lot of food with four courses included. I started with the Wedge Salad and my husband had the Caesar. We also had Lobster Bisque. The steaks were well seasoned and prepared as requested. The most memorable part of the meal for me was the Crème Brulee that was served with two tasty cookies on top. Our food was A-OK, but not my favorite steakhouse in town.

Even with the deal we spent almost as much as we would have spent without the deal. I'd suggest if you are visiting to just forget the deal and order from the regular menu.

I was very impressed with the level of service and the quality of the food.  The decor creates a nice mood and the wait staff is very attentive. My only complaint was that the top of my crème brulé was a bit over caramelized.  Other than that, it was a perfectly delightful meal.

In our party we had the prawn and crab cocktail which was really good.  Also the Mohawk Crab Cakes which were wrapped in a Filo dough and they were ok, they were not the best but of course not the worst.  These came with a Mango side salad which was really good.

I really wanted to try the Five Onion Soup and to my surprise they did not have it.  I guess I should say our server was surprised as well since she took the order, brought the spoon, and waited and waited....after a long wait, our server came over and said when she asked to find out why I had not gotten the soup, they told her they did not have any????

Other then that, the music was great, the atmosphere was great and overall the food was good.  I am sure we will be back and hopefully they will have the soup next time.  The description looks awesome, it's sad and odd they did not have it.
 
The staff is friendly and very attentive which was nice and added to the warm and friendly atmosphere.  They do seem to stay busy in the restaurant which tells me this place is definitely worth another visit to try more of the menu selections.

The one thing I don't understand is, our server stated that the water from the bar is NOT filtered and they charge $8 for a bottle of water.  So either you pay an outrageous price which they should not be allowed to do or you drink water that according to the server is just faucet water which is contaminated...",kzRq4H_nSf4b3F_sdymWSw,10,6,3,MN9qcSbz1UoX8CCRgiBpJA

4673420,2014-08-17,0,B0Vm2tge4I2JJlZhD4sl0Q,"Came here last night with my dad (Saturday) before the ZZ Top concert. We arrived at just before 6. We walked by earlier and it was empty so we were not too worried about getting in.  I like to always make reservations but I didn't.  When we arrived all of the main dining tables were full, but we were lucky enough to get a table in the bar. If you come, make a reservation! 

It was pretty good.  We ordered the New York strip with foie gras, the halibut and au gratin potatoes. No martinis for us. We wanted the Far Niente Red but they were out. Our waitress recommended the Archery Summit Pinot Noir instead. Fantastic choice.  

Cons: The food took a little while to come. There was not salt and pepper on the table. I understand that chefs like to season a certain way, but some of us like a little extra salt and pepper! The Halibut was over cooked and dry :/ disappointing. 

Pros: the wine recommendation was amazing (I'm searching to see where I can buy it in LA). The steak was pretty good. Asked for rare, came a little over rare but still good. The foie gras was amazing, though I've never had it before so I have nothing to compare it to. They also brought us a foie gras appetizer (I think because the food took a bit longer to come). That was also delish, and a great gesture on the restaurants part. The potatoes were pretty good, they had nutmeg in them (which I like but some people don't). 

Other than that everything was pretty good. There was a musician playing in the bar, who was fantastic... But sitting at the table right next to her trying to talk to my dad who's hard of hearing was a bit difficult. I would come back again for the wine, steak and foie gras. Our waitress was also a pretty good. Can't remember her name, but she's the one with the fantastic blond hair all styled up (Samantha maybe?).",uZdHH5e4i0zhrR3XK5KvnQ,0,0,4,dYdpip3jmlrjkUQRAvf_OA

Also, I have to mention that this was not a busy restaurant and maybe that should have been our first hint! There were only a handful of tables seated at 8 pm on a Sunday night. 

We ordered the 22 oz ribeye that was supposed to be cooked medium rare and it showed up medium (that's OK though, we don't mind that much) but it wasn't hot! I mean, I don't expect it to be sizzling hot, but it was just luke warm and it changes the flavor of the steak. We also ordered asparagus (which I loved!) and the giant baked potato that was just so ordinary, there was nothing exciting about it. Our friends ordered the Mac n cheese, I was able to try it and the flavor fell flat from that too. 

In all honesty, with so many other options for a nice dinner on the strip, this is not one that we will be back for. You definitely open your wallets for a mediocre meal. I hope they can revamp their menu and change a few things, it needs it!",-uk4wYCSmjWz8vH9XkqroA,2,0,3,97i-6A1QD7X_1jjFuixiag

4926307,2013-01-02,1,B0Vm2tge4I2JJlZhD4sl0Q,"Simply put, the food was less than mediocre and the service was absolutely APPALLING.  Our reservation was for 7:45pm.   We got there at 7:41pm.  Instead of saying something like, ""Why don't you sit at the bar while we get your table ready""..or even ""We are running a little behind, we apologize!  Sit at the bar and we'll let you know as soon as it's ready,"" the hostess says to us, ""You're early so there's no table available.  If you want to sit at the bar, you can, or we'll let you know when one opens up.""  I was confused and irritated but didn't want to let it ruin our night so we sat at the bar and waited...and waited...and waited....30 minutes later they finally seat us.  To my suprise, there were at least 5 other empty tables, which by the way, never got sat the entire time.  

The first server who took our drink orders gave us prix fix menus.  I asked if we can order off the regular menu and he said no, they were only serving the prix fix menu, which I can't believe they didn't tell us when we made the reservation.  But again, I didn't want to be a brat so we just said okay since it was New Year's Eve and we were already there and had a concert to go to and didn't want to have to go hunting for somewhere to eat. It was way more food and money than I wanted to pay, and trust me, we don't mind paying money for good food, but I didn't want to spend $125 on a 5 course dinner when all I really wanted was a steak and maybe some mac & cheese.  So the watier took our drink order and never came back.  Somoene else came later to take our food order and we asked him about the drinks we had ordered 15 minutes ago.  He said he'll check and come back.  He leaves as well and never comes back.  15 minutes later our first course comes out.  I ordered crab bisque, which was okay.  My boyfriend ordered asparagus salad, which tasted like drowned plants.  At this point, I'm looking around and trying to wave down anyone who looked like they worked there to find out where our drinks were.  Finally, the a different waiter comes back and asks what we want.  I said, can you find our server for us, we are just wondering where our drinks are. He says in the rudest tone, ""Just tell me what you want, I'll get.""  So I told him I had already ordered a glass of champagne and my boyfriend had ordered a dirty martini.  He left and came back with them within minutes.

Our main course arrived then.  I had ordered the filet oscar with lobster mac & cheese, and he had the rossini. My steak was just okay nd his was more medium than medium rare.  When I moved aside the ""oscar"" stuff on top, I could see that it had been completely over-seared so that it literally was a quarter inch BLACK on top, and there was a slightly burnt taste.  I had to cut off that part and just eat the middle.  The lobster mac & cheese was completely overcooked so that the macaroni was soft and mushy.  It was inedible.  We were pretty much done at this point and didn't want dessert - hence NOT wanting to do the stupid prix fix menu.  I asked the waiter to box up our left overs (treats for the dogs) and to skip dessert.  His response, ""fine.""  He boxed it all up and gave me my check.  As I'm looking at it, a runner brings out dessert.  I had to tell her we had already informed our waiter we didn't want our dessert.  She rolled her eyes and just turned around and left without a word.  WTF!  So I look at the bill and see that he had autogratted 25% already. I waved him down and asked why and he said ""because it's new year's eve.""  At this point, I just wanted to get out of there.  We had an awesome evening planned and I was already so irritated by his attitude and the shitty food that I was starting to feel that if I didn't just leave it was going to ruin my night, so I signed the check and left.

Needless to say, I hope this place goes out of business, as I know it inevitably will.  Both the food AND the service sucked.  I've been there when it was Rare 120 and I had thought the food was okay then, but at least we had gotten good service, and yet that place closed down quickly.  This place is not worth even half of what we spent. I  would rather have eaten at McDonalds for dinner.",LwVUO_5jjHuJRhvl6hlHVg,7,1,1,6w-C0p6gugFdqgyM-4Ww4w

5022918,2013-08-06,2,B0Vm2tge4I2JJlZhD4sl0Q,"The fiancée and my last two nights in LV were spent at the Hard Rock. 35 Steaks + Martinis was offering a free wine pour nightly between 5 and 6 for guests of the hotel and Backstage Pass members.  Not one to pass up on a free glass of wine, we decided to check it out.  As luck would have it, many other wine lovers were also there.  However, the two bartenders I saw working behind the bar were fast, friendly and efficient in getting customers their glasses of wine or whatever drink they had requested with minimal wait.  I was immediately impressed with 35 Steaks' wine freebie because the bartenders were pouring restaurant standard 6 oz. glasses of a red or white wine, and the red wine being served was an Estancia Meritage, which was a full bodied, very drinkable and enjoyable.  With our glasses of wine in hand, we decided to enjoy it with food, so we went to hostess to see about getting a table for dinner.  Since it was only a little after 6 pm on a Thursday night, there were plenty of available tables and we were seated immediately.  

We split orders of the Shrimp Cocktail ($17), which included four Black Tiger prawns and a Belvedere Citrus cocktail sauce; the Ahi Tuna Tartar ($16) with Asian pear, Korean chili vinaigrette, fried wonton chips, and micro shiso; and a 14 oz. wet aged Choice New York Strip ($43).  As unfair as it is, I hold all shrimp cocktails up against my shrimp cocktail standard of the St. Elmo Steakhouse in Indianapolis.  35 Steaks' rendition was good, but did not meet that gold standard as it was a bit pricier and did not deliver a cocktail sauce with a fraction of the sinus searing horseradish power of St. Elmo's sauce.  The ahi tuni tartar was a very satisfying dish.  The fresh, diced tuna was imbued with a nice spiciness from the vinaigrette, which contrasted with the mild sweetness and crunch from the slivers of Asian pear.  The micro shiso provided subtle earthy notes and color contrast.  It was a satisfying dish.  We normally go for dry aged, Prime steaks especially with strip steaks where the intramuscular marbling really helps to give the cut a little something extra.  However, we decided to try a Choice cut subjected to the wet aging process.  35 Steaks graciously sent out our steak sliced in half on separate plates.  Even though the NY Strip was just a Choice cut, it was cooked to a perfect medium rare, quite tender and flavorful.  Honestly, I don't think I would've been able to tell the difference it and a Prime NY Strip!  It was an enjoyable piece of meat.  

Frankly, my expectations coming into 35 Steaks + Martinis were relatively low.  In the interests of full disclosure I had a $40 food credit from the Hard Rock's Backstage Pass loyalty program, which we ended up using here.  That said, bad food and bad service will trump any discount.  35 Steaks + Martinis served up solid, satisfying food.  Given that there were only a handful of other diners in the room, we also received very personable and attentive service throughout out meal.  I'll put it out there, 35 Steaks + Martinis served up one of the biggest culinary surprises we received during our week in Las Vegas.",le3Xn9Mheb1hNxWurF7RSw,4,3,4,FMZjgB49H_hbioPDKM_Bew

Undoubtedly the Hard Rock Resort & Casino's premier dining venue, a poolside location both a gift and a curse based on view and bass, respectively, it was as a party of three that a table with good lighting beneath a photo of Amy Winehouse was shared as General Manager Mario Gonzalez orchestrated a flurry of drinks, flawless service and even some parlor tricks, the duo on the line going well-beyond what was necessary to leave a lasting impression.

Intending only to enjoy the Burger and a platter of freshly cracked King Crab Legs, but soon seeing this modest meal morph into a four-course feast featuring a Baker's Dozen menu choices - all enjoyed during prior stops - it goes to show just how indulgent each experience has been that the Bone Marrow had gone forgotten in such a short period, the labor-intensive brining and cold-smoke creating a rich spread that was good straight from the spoon, but even better when slathered on grilled Bread.

Still striking a chord with the Foie Gras, Escargot and Carpaccio while both the Burger, Wellington and its accoutrements set a high standard for Sin City, Mario's wine choices were highlighted by well-priced Chardonnays plus the sticky-sweet Dolce, a Tawny Port older than either tablemate a perfect finish alongside four desserts from which the Sticky Pig and Chocolate Cake remain as elegantly composed as they are decadent.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,10,11,5,L_oriFLoyHMN_yyWlFbhQA

We stayed at HRH and had a check-in coupon for a free bottle of wine with dinner. Not being the type of people to turn down free wine, my wife and I decided to eat here.  We both had filet (cooked perfect medium rare), split a Caesar (outstanding), the Asparagus (perfectly cooked), and split a baked potato (huge).  Wine was just OK, but if you wanted something else instead, you could take $20 off your choice instead. But since we hadn't had that one before, we tried it. 

Service was fantastic, and the myriad waiters/waitresses noticed whenever our wine/water glasses got down below half-full and fixed the problem for us.  

If I have one issue, it's that the atmosphere was more open, bright, and casual than the average steakhouse (compared to The Steak House at Circus or Andiamo downtown, as examples). Sometimes, when I'm out for a nice dinner, I enjoy a little bit more of an intimate atmosphere, and don't want to feel like I'm in a great big dining hall or wedding reception.

But I'd definitely eat here again.",kGGapvfP1SZH2ZOikdSpNA,1,2,4,yJ0OWe-JUdLtuS7zeVYuhg

That said, I yearn for the day I can hit the lottery so I can afford to eat at a good steak place in Las Vegas again.  35's prices seem reasonable compared to others but still make for a pricey night.

Back to the matter at hand, dessert.  We used our free champagne coupon and ordered the oreo cookie cake dessert and the king dessert.  The oreo cookie is awesome.  Well presented and extremely delicious.  The King dessert was a bit of a let down as it seemed small and had only a subtle hint of peanut butter.  Still it was more than edible, just overhyped on the menu.

The service was amazing, both in looks (everyone, women and men was gorgeous) and in friendliness as they recommended their favorites and attended to us quickly.

There are three other items on the menu that look awesome including a cheesecake with a berry compote and a chocolate chocolate cake.

We were greeted right away my guest let the waiter know we were starving and wanted to place our orders right away. The waiter offered suggestions and a special. I'm going to base this review on my dinner as my guest isn't really a foodie. I ordered the filet cooked medium rare along with a side of Mac and cheese. After ordering a warm bread with cheese was brought over it was very good but I feel it should have been paired with a butter or oil / herb combo. The dinner came out fast the filet was cooked perfectly and the Mac and cheese was baked with a light breadcrumb on top. We took a look at the dessert menu they had from what I remember around 10 options my guest orders the strawberry shortcake sundae it looked really good. I'm a chocolate lover I ordered the chocolate mousse cake dessert. It came out and reminded me of a Swiss roll it was circular with mousse in between cake. I loved it very decadent and rich but amazing. Great dinner and service. As I was leaving I noticed they had a live performer singing and a nice lounge.,DMBoJ0IlxjwYOE8e9jQzXw,3,2,4,RwcmwdWxEinkSxhFbmuppA

I stay at the Hardrock when I am in Vegas and was excited to try the new steak joint. This restaurant location seems to be cursed as both AJ's and the place after it didn't quite seem up to snuff. Went with a group of 9 guys on a bachelor party. There were 2 other groups there both under 10 people and maybe 4 or 5 other tables sat. In total, there were around 40 to 50 people there. This will come into play in a second. We sat down and service was fine. We ordered right away. Appetizers took 45 minutes to come out and our steaks came out 75 minutes after ordering them. I asked why it took so long and the server said it was because we were a big group. If a restaurant that seats over 100 can't service 10 customers when they are only half full, they need some major changes to the service.

Then there was the food. I got the crab cakes which I would give a 3 out 5 for the crab cakes I have had in my life but at $15 for one very small crab cake, it should have been better. I split the tomahawk chop, ordered medium rare, with a buddy and ordered the the spinach as a side. Spinach was simple steamed spinach and was average at best and again I would have expected something more for $8 but this is my fault for not asking if it was just straight steamed spinach. The steak was bar none the worst $100 steak I have ever had. It would have been the worst $20 steak I have ever had if it didn't cost $50 a head. It came out medium well which I should have expected I guess since it was on the grill for so long. I would have sent it back but I didn't have another hour to wait for a replacement. There was no flavor to the meat at all which might have been from the overcooking but it was very fatty (which rib eye should be) and somehow still devoid of flavor. Our entire group had similar feelings with some of the guys feeling it was not bad but just mediocre.
I have no problem dropping $100+ on a good dinner but that is not what this place had to offer when I was there. I hope they turn this around because I will be in the hotel again and hate having to drive somewhere to get a decent steak.",cD_Bpb5IcK9iT0qg2DwgyQ,2,0,1,ZVMFJWoBbKE3Ef-jtR5z3w

To my dismay, they changed their happy hour offerings, such as no more reasonably priced cocktails! Our server didn't provide a happy hour menu when we were seated until I asked about it. That is such a misstep in my opinion. If you're in the bar during happy hour & such a menu exists, provide it!!! Hiding it just makes me lose all respect. 

The bar bites menu (all day, every day!) is now food only. We both ordered the surf and turf spring rolls from that menu ($7), and shortly thereafter we received sad news. We were told something like, we have a new chef, and these aren't available. She crossed those off the menu along with one other item that I can't recall. Lame! We both ordered our second choices instead- mine was a crab cake slider & a ""one shrimp"" (tiger prawn) cocktail. My dining partner had 2 crab cake sliders. The curry sauce on the sliders wasn't a good fit, both of us agreed on that. 
We both had salads as well- mine was the beet & she had the wedge. We liked the salads fine though mine was lacking in flavor and the beets weren't soft, which I found strange. The soft cheese was wrapped in a nest which was a nice presentation. But for $15, I expected much more.

Like all Vegas restaurants, 35 Steak + Martinis has a classy albeit dated appearance and friendly servers. It's a nice casual dinner spot for drinks and food with friends, but you can always get better in Vegas.

I had the Prix Fixe Menu which was $55 for a 3 course meal which seemed like an amazing deal considering the price of their food. 

The meal began with their signature bread which was light and fluffy and seasoned with herbs and cheese. I actually really enjoyed the bread which was fragrant and hearty.

The first course was a generous bowl of lobster bisque which was creamy and tasted strongly of seafood. There was a slight spicy kick, but I wasn't a huge fan of the flavor actually and left most of it.

The second course was the famed steak. This was really disappointing for me because with a name like 35 Steaks + Martinis you would think their steak would be their signature dish. The steak was nicely flavored but seriously overcooked. I requested a medium rare, and it came out more like a well done. It was super tough and plain hard to swallow. 

The last dish was the creme brûlée which was pretty good, but nothing to write home about.

Overall I had a disappointing food experience here. The portions here were very generous but the quality of the food was nothing impressive or memorable. The steak too definitely was the hugest disappointment of the night.
