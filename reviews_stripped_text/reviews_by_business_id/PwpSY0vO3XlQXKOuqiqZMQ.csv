I often don't bother reviewing restaurants with poor vegan choices, but feel compelled to here because this one couldn't even get me a salad that was sufficient.

I thought I'd get pizza with no cheese. Their pizza dough has egg in it.

Ok, salad. ALL of their dressings except for one also has egg whites in them. That's odd, but whatever. So I get the chopped vegetable salad with the one dressing they can offer. The salad was mediocre and meager in portion size. So after lunch here I had to go find something to eat.",SdKbaLOpxCn9zJPszXQltg,1,0,1,toM1cwhRn0xx-DFYUVMPRw

I had the seafood boulabaisse which was ordinary, certainly not wow, was kinda similar to other ordinary Italian places that I've been too. It wasn't bad but it certainly wasn't off the wall good!

81253,2008-01-18,0,PwpSY0vO3XlQXKOuqiqZMQ,"I rarely have such mixed feelings about my experience at a restaurant. It's normally a question of whether or not I left the place with a general sense of satisfaction. I still crave the dish I ordered that day (slices of garlic cloves and slivers of parmesan tend to make quite an impression on one's taste buds even weeks after consumption), but I can't weigh my entire score on the food.

The hostess made me feel like a disgusting transient as she lurched me over to a table and told me to expect a waiter soon. The waiter and the rest of the staff were fine, but I still felt as though I was the disappointment among the clientele because I was only a party of one in a city crammed with dining couples.

The rustic ""artisan-style"" loaf fought off my hunger for a while, but the spicy Chilean red wine and pungent, hearty pasta arrived quickly. Still, I felt little love :-( 

Lady Suzanne's hourly opera show, however, brought a tear to everyone's eye and added about two stars to my score. I'd have to say that my seat was perfect for watching this performance--as well as every other show that the Venetian hosts at the Grand Canal Shoppes. Few performers can pull off a Disney Princess persona and still retain my respect. She's bad@$$.

...Yes, I consider her to be part of the dining experience. She sure saved THIS review, didn't she?

In closing, the food and the entertainment were the strong points at this establishment. Had the hostess shown me a slightly kinder shade of contempt, maybe I could have found the heart to add another star.",3kPSIxe6fvTXtM4GwKYAgA,1,0,4,0gzL1fovWtH2OXY3zoQyUg

Server was very professional, no pens or pads, got to know us and gave us detailed descriptions of all the specials and anything we asked. I ended up ordering some sort of boiled spinach salad and the filet mignon. Though pricey at around $50, I felt it was worth it. It was fired at a high temperature with a salt/pepper crust and the inside was bloody as hell, just like I ordered. Was topped with caramelized onions and had a side of yukon gold mashed potatoes which were very well-made.

351570,2008-09-28,0,PwpSY0vO3XlQXKOuqiqZMQ,"I'm not sure whether the word 'Postrio' has a meaning, or whether it is a place. And I'm not sure whether Wolfgang Puck's restaurant knows what it is supposed to be, either.


 Wolfgang Johann Puck is an Austrian celebrity chef, restaurateur, and businessman based in Los Angeles. Postrio, San Francisco, is one of his flagships, and he's replicated it here in Las Vegas. Located on St. Mark's Square in the Grand Canal Shoppes in the Venetian Resort Hotel Casino, the restaurant provides both casual and more formal dining. It offers a menu of seasonal American cuisine with Mediterranean influences, available either in an elegant dining room or a more casual setting on the patio of St. Mark's Square. Luchtime is patio dining only with a restricted menu.


 Puck is a great self publicist whose face is all over his web sites. He has enjoyed undoubted success and his restaurants have had rave reviews. But something has to give when a chef becomes a Brand (it's happening now in GB with Gordon Ramsey). In the case of Postrio, Las Vegas, both food and service have suffered. Postrio is in the top price bracket, so one does not expect ones waiter to be a non-english speaking Mexican, who clears plates whilst ones colleague is still eating. Miserly portions on plates decorated with squiggles of balsamic reduction have never impressed me, and this is what you get here.


 A very comfortable, well situated and attractive place, Postrio is nonetheless not worth the money.

Our dinner at Postrio was an almost flawless experience and unfortunately the first ""touch point"" was the single negative. The young maitre 'd was sullen and humorless (I assume she was the obligatory aspiring actress/model/weather girl) and felt that a smile was simply too much for her soon=to-be-famous face. 

Once our brush with imminenet celebrity was done the rest of the dinner was outstanding. Our waitress, and indeed everyone who hovered around, delivered to  or checked on our table was warm and friendly and totally professional. 

The experience of dining under the faux stars of the Venetian Piazza was wonderful and greatly enhanced by the string quartet playing to our right. 

But the highlight of the evening was of course the food. As I have said before I am not a foodie, but both our meals were remarkably good. I had the mushroom risotto and my girlfriend had the schnitzel and both fell squarely into the category of best meal I've ever eaten. Risotto can get a bit monotonous but this meal so so wonderfully prepared each mouthful was an intriguing blend of interesting spices. The schnitzel itself was a tad bland until you applied the sauce which complemented the meat so perfectly that it was transformed into an entirely different dish.

1083556,2010-08-12,0,PwpSY0vO3XlQXKOuqiqZMQ,"This was my first visit to a Wolfgang Puck restaurant and perhaps my expectations were a bit too high.  I know that his brand has extended far beyond a size he could reasonably oversee on his own, but I was inspired by a book on food history I read that gave me new appreciation for Puck's early culinary breakthroughs and for contributing to the gourmet pizza trend that began in the 80s.

I started my meal with the trio of house-made sausages served with three mustards and pickled vegetables.  This was a delicious dish, though really a bit too large to be served as a first course.
For my second course, I had to try one of his famous pizzas.  Since it is usually the simpler dishes that allow culinary genius to really shine, I opted for the margerita pizza and was sadly disappointed.  The pizza section of the menu was placed before the entrees, but this was misleading as the pizza was large enough to be an entree.  Now I expect large portions from chains such as the Cheesecake Factory, but here I would have expected quality over quantity and that was not the case.  The ratio of the ingredients was off with everything being dominated by a very thick layer of cheese.  The tomatoes were bland and the crust was a bit soggy under all that cheese.  When I did nibble on the bits of crust around the edge there was none of that amazing flavor you find in better pizzas or even the crusty/chewy combo to be had at places like Settebello.  Sadly, even Lavo has a better margerita pizza last time I checked.  This didn't exhibit any of the charectaristics of a high-end pizza.  My friend ate one piece and I didn't even finish mine.
For my entree, I selected the lobster roll, though after tasting it I think a better description would have been a BLT.  This sandwich was good, but not great.  The bacon dressing used on the sandwich was delicious and the Applewood smoked bacon was tasty, but between the two, overpowered the flavor of the lobster.  The grain bread and arugula was quite nice, but the tomatoes were flavorless and I found that unforgivable.  I work in the restaurant industry here in Vegas and know first hand that there are some amazing tomatoes to be had here.  Serving bland hothouse tomatoes in August is just plain lazy.  The amount of lobster actually in the lobster roll was not generous enough to be considered the main ingredient, though the chunks that were included were tender and delicious.  This was accompanied by a mound of french fries large enough to serve a family of four.  Really.  

For dessert, we shared the chocolate beignets.  The presentation was lovely, with a large quenelle of caramel macchiatto ice cream, a small dish of vanilla dipping sauce and a small pile of chocolate beignets filled with a liquid chocolate center.  This was the one course where the portion size was appropriate.  The ice cream was fabulous - the flavors well balanced, the texture was very creamy and it paired well with the beignets.  The vanilla sauce was thicker than a classic anglaise and just right for adhering to the little doughnuts.  I loved the flavor of the beignets and thought the filling was a great idea, but it wasn't executed very well.  They were quite doughy in the middle- either from being under cooked or simply by putting the liquid ganache in the center while still warm.  Either way this kept the dessert from being as good as it could have been.  

Another disappointment was the service.  Our server was OK, but I felt rushed at several points during the meal.  Yes, my friend and I were doing a lot of talking, but I don't think that keeping our table for under 2 hours for four courses is unreasonable.  Two of the courses were cleared while I was literally still chewing food from my plate. I also would have expected the server to do something about the disappointing pizza.   Either take it off our bill or offer us something else, but when less than two pieces are eaten (between two people) that should be a flag that something is wrong.  In fact at one point after our pizza was cleared, but before our main course, the busser brought the pizza out in a to-go box and put it down on our table.  I wondered just what he wanted us to do with it.  It was too large on a very small table to fit the plates for our next course, so it had to be taken away again.  No problem, neither of us wanted to take it home.

All in all it wasn't a bad meal.  Some of the food was good and I did end up really enjoying my wine, but that isn't enough.  In this competitive food town, not bad, just isn't good enough to bring me back for seconds.",7HOTOydGS7wJYaJqNoDfeg,1,0,2,MSzYw7O7o-eO62G2LxiTKw

I like Postrio because it combines a good people watching opportunity with great cocktails.  The food leaves a bit to be desired, and coming with Wolfgang Puck's name on it, one automatically thinks it will be something it is not.  

The few times I've been here I always leave saying the same thing:  ""Next time I'm just having drinks.""  The cocktails here are fantastic.  Very creative and well made drinks are enough to keep me coming back, especially the cognac and lemon juice martini, mmm mmm!

Most recently we ordered:

Margarita Pizza - Straight forward mozzarella flavor, nothing developed or complex, very underperforming pizza.

Salt n' Pepper Calamari and Shrimp -  Perfectly light and flaky coating, good flavor, delicious sweet chili dipping sauce, just a good appetizer.

Chopped salad - What was he thinking?  This salad worries me, it shouldn't  be on the menu.  There are what I take to be pickled figs in here, which do what capers often do to dishes, overpower them.  This unbalanced bowl of greens is an expensive mish mosh of salad bar rejects.

Cesar Salad - Very crisp lettuce and a light dressing were a nice way to continue through our meal.  Think Cesar Salad's less chubby cousin.

Pumpkin Tortelloni in Brown Butter Sage sauce - Overpowering sage flavor, whoa!  The pasta itself was very well made, and I had no issue with the pumpkin in the noodle, but the sauce failed to accentuate anything on the dish.  It really just screamed Sage, and not in a good way.

I don't think there is a strict definition of a Picky Eater, but as all of you know, you know it when you see it.  A Picky Eater is not the same as someone who is Gastronomically Educated and is therefore selective, I must make that quick distinction.  Anyway. 

I ended up at Postrio because I was traveling with some Picky Eaters, the kind who like hamburgers and fries, and eschew all manner of vegetal stuffs.  They wanted to go to Outback Steakhouse, which distressed me, but people like Whiny Food Snobs just about as much as they like Picky Eaters.  

Postrio is affordable Las Vegas fare, the service is quick, and with the kind of menu they are sporting, it's fairly unlikely that you're going to get food poisoning.

Two seating areas of this place, the first being I guess what they would consider outside seating, they call it their patio cafe and bar lounge, however it really is not outside because this place is in the Venetian Grande Canal Shoppes. You feel like you're outside because of the setting within this shopping (I'll call it an upscale Vegas style) mall is all about the Trompe L'oeil, (painted to be realistic) you feel like you're in a Venetian style town complete with the canal waterway, restaurants, shops and yes even a sky. Upon entering and walking through the facade of what is outside, you enter into a very minimalist modern style dining room. 

The menu is American with Asian and Mediterranean influence. But, to be perfectly honest with you... I can't remember what the heck I had for my main course, something Asian like, The dish I remember best was the incredible salad I had before my main course. Yes, it is true, the salad was the star. It seems so simple...Cappressi Salad, but it was not! I don't know how they did it... a couple maybe more, drizzles of fine olive oils, plate dotted with pesto or a sauce, basil based and of course a primo balsamic vinegar along with a dollop of the softest mozzerella and just the right garnish.

They have two dining areas for Postrio: one ""outside"" in front of the restaurant and the other inside. If you like the hustle and bustle and the energy of the canals, then outside is definitely for you. Tonight we kind of want a quieter dining atmosphere and chose to sit inside.

We were both wanting seafood and so we ordered:
* Crispy Calamari with Zucchini and Olives, Spicy Tomato Sauce and Garlic Aioli - this was pretty good. better than your everyday calamari you might get at like a TGI Fridays, but not even close to Mesa Grill or B&B's version. it was worth it though to start.
* Linguini with Clams, Garlic, Pancetta, Chili and Parsley - this was my entree. it was ever so slightly above average. the clams were washed perfectly so there wasn't any grit but they were a little on the small side. overall the dish wasn't bad.
* Seafood Ravioli, Clams, Mussels, Calamari, Shrimp, Bay Scallops, Tomatoes, Roasted Peppers - this was my gf entree... I grabbed a small quick bite. same story as above.

We had a few drinks with the meal and overall it was pretty good.  I will admit there really wasn't anything that was a WOW or substantially stood out in the meal, but everything was cooked perfectly and the food was good.

Prosciutto pizza - fresh tasting...can be a bit salty with the olives.  I liked how the prosciutto was spread out and cut into little pieces as opposed to a huge pile in the middle of the pizza.

As I have been brainwashed by the cheese platter at Batali's San Marco right across the way at the Venetian, I had never noticed this place except that Wolfgang Puck has some restaurant in the corner.  Club Grazie sent me a complimentary dinner here so I checked it out with the GF this past Wednesday evening.

We were seated inside (would have been a 10 minute wait outside.  Inside is mood lit, clean, and less distracting which is great for a date and/or you're ugly (as in my case).  It felt more formal inside too, but the outside is nice if you want to see/hear the violinists or jesters, but you may also enjoy the crowd of tourists passing by.

Here's the menu: (http://www.venetian.com/uploadedFiles/The_Venetian/Dining/Fine_Dining/PostrioDinner0410.pdf)

Very friendly and accomodating waiter, simple wine menu (I like that). Also of note, the bread and butter comes with a crushed olive/basil/olive oil dipping sauce for the Italian bread that was really good.

We started off with a few of the kumamoto oysters which were phenomenal.  It's funny how you can get some of the freshest seafoods and meats in the middle of the desert.

We then split the caesar salad which had a nice deconstructed take on an old favorite.  It has a very flavorful white anchovie slice served with whole lettuce leaves which are tossed with the caesar dressing which IMO had the perfect balance of acidity and creaminess.  Great salad and it might be the first one where I've needed a knife to eat.

For entrees, I ordered the steamed black mussels in a white wine sauce and the GF got the spinach lasagna with meat sauce.  My one let down was the bearnaise sauce that covered the bread with my mussels.  It was too sweet, sour, and creamy for my taste, the GF didn't like it either.  The mussels tasted great, but I was not blown away, it was about what I expected when ordering steamed mussels.

The GF's spinach ravioli on the other did blow me away.  I recommend this dish to anyone who likes pasta in meat sauces.  I'll upload some of the iphone pics in a bit, but the pasta was perfectly soft and the meat sauce had great flavors of the beef and sausage.

For dessert, save room for the beinet.  Fried chocolate doughnuts with chocolate and caramel inside that melts in your mouth, served with coffee ice cream and a vanilla sauce... We got them on the waiter's recommendation and they turned out to be one of the best desserts I've had in a long time.

Next time I'll try the linguine in white clam sauce and the four cheese ravioli since the pasta was so good.  The pizzas didn't look special from the other tables, so I'll stick with San Marco when I want a pizza.",L7hVyYRvjou4_CGMoLtkUw,0,0,5,LWcqBys50VHy4t1TpQyTug

location & pricing: its right in the grand canal of shoppes and was cute - we went in the evening on christmas day and there was a little show going on right next the restaurant. we were out on the ""patio"" part, and had a view the entire time. thankfully we were also seated near the bar where we could keep up with the chargers/titans game too. pricing was a bit high for the things that we ate.

atmosphere: this place was cute - people milling by, comfortable setting, and pretty romantic. yes its loud, but its vegas - it'll always be loud :)

taste: alright. this is the hard part. while the atmosphere was cute, the food was not that great. the appetizers were the saving grace of this place. the spicy tuna tartare with avacado was simply superb. we also got the margherita pizza as an appetizer too (special with chicken on it! hahaha) and it was pretty darn good as well. however come time for our entrees, you would think that ordering a pasta dish would be awesome coming from an italian restaurant IN the venetian. you would be sadly mistaken. out of two spicy spaghettinis, house made lasagna, the atlantic salmon, the salmon was by far the most flavorful, clean, and satisfying in taste. the others were way too cheesy and not enough meat.

service: it was sub-par. it wouldve been borderline good if our waiter wasn't such an asshole about the guys in the kitchen. first thing he said was ""i'll be right with you, im gonna go check on some dishes - they have been taking awhile to come out all day and be right back with you guys"". seriously? what the heck? and we had to ask him multiple times for more water. ugh. such a turnoff for a restaurant.

I was able to sample several of the dishes on my last trip to Vegas and the only disappointing part, as far as food is concerned, was the aioli that the pomme frites come with. I just wasn't into it. The shrimp cocktail was very filling, with incredibly jumbo shrimp, and a trip of dipping sauces. The pumpkin soup was fantastic, complete with pumpkin seeds. My husband ordered the fettuccine, which, despite what you may think is not in an alfredo sauce, and found it to be fantastic. I tried two of the salads (field greens and chef) and they were both very good and hearty enough to act as a lunch entree when paired with another appetizer or side. I loved the tapenade that came with the flatbread they serve to the table. 

They have a nice little wine by the glass list including a very good albarino. What I enjoyed the most was their diverse tea list. After selecting one I was most pleased to have the loose leaves steeped perfectly in a little cast iron tea pot delivered to my table. 

The one drawback here was service. During one of my lunch experiences here we waited nearly an hour for our food in a restaurant that was not very busy.

I went with the asparagus soup for appetizer which was absolutely delicious.  Others went with the grilled chicken skewers which were also delicious.   For the main course I went with the linguine with clams and pancetta which was just awesome.  Another in our party got the salmon and that was one of the best, most flavorful salmon dishes I've ever had.  Not sure what all was in the seasonings, but just delicious.   Another in the party got the Schnitzel and that was easily the biggest meal of the bunch.  We also had one pasta with their bolognese sauce which was also very very good.   All in all an excellent meal.

The waiter was very attentive to the fact two of our party had dairy allergies and checking on each item before serving.  Even not serving the peanut sauce with the chicken skewers because it contains cream.

The most recent visit we had a butter lettuce caesar salad that was delightful, a lobster club sandwich (lobster was a little hidden by the mayo and other flavors unfortunately) and the lasagna.  For dessert we had the new (it was only the first day or so they were offering it) ""Wolfgang's childhood favorite"" apple struedel (I think?) with a scoop of caramel gelato.

Postrio is in the heart of the venetian - second floor (where the canal is) and right on St. Marks Square.  You can sit ""outside"" if you want, and it certainly adds to the atmosphere.  Inside is a sleek modern dining room that doesn't detract from the charm of this place.  The music was a little too loud for my taste, but this is Las Vegas, after all.

Service was ok - slow to the point where I was looking for people, but not so slow that I was looking for a way out.  I definitely felt neglected though.

Let's talk food.  I had pizza - after all, it's what Wolfgang Puck is known for, and it didn't disappoint.  The crust was thin and perfectly cooked.  The tomato sauce was to die for - I'd love to know where they get their tomatoes because it actually tasted like tomatoes.  The toppings were delicious - mine was a collection of various meats together with mushrooms, chilis and onions.  I wish whoever was cleaning the chilis was a little more careful - one of mine had the seeds and membrane and almost blew my palate.

Since we were having such a convivial evening, we decided to order dessert.  A word of warning (and I wish the waiter had warned us prior to ordering) - the ""Pucks Pies"" take a while to bake as they are made fresh - expect a 15-ish minute wait.  I ordered the peach melba pie - really good.  I wish I could have had a warm custard option instead of the ice cream, which was nothing special.

This Wolfgang Puck establishment delivered the culinary equivalent of ""bad touch"" from mom's new boyfriend. I should have known that everything was going to go terribly wrong from the painful interaction with the server..

Me: What are the cuts of beef in the burger?
She: Angus.
Me: That is a type of cow. I am more interested in the parts of the cow that the meat comes from so that I can order my burger cooked to a temperature that is most appropriate. Can you please go check?
She: *huff*
Me: Am not trying to be a pain; I am trying to order the burger correctly so that I can properly review it.

I assumed that she was new or fussy or just plain bad at her job. I failed to take this as an omen. The other clue was that the restaurant was all but empty in the middle of the bustling St. Mark's Square. Postrio was Italian slang for ""crappy food and service.""   

The beef was flavorful and beefy. Sadly, it was over-cooked and rubbery. The burger patty had the shape and texture of a fist. Beyond that, the burger was peppered with connective tissue. 

The burger's exterior tasted like an oniony salt. It was as if it had been dusted with cheap onion soup mix.

The bun was stale and dry...really dry and stale. The bun was burned to the point of tasting like carbon. The bottom of the bun had black grill marks, which imparted a nasty bitterness directly to the tongue.

The kitchen at Postrio phoned it in and subsequently dropped the ball. After I sent my meal back, there was no offer for a refire or a make-good of any sort. Apparently, that was their best effort.

The manager, Luckas, agreed that the bun was burned and stale and that the burger was rubbery. I sent my plate back after a scant 3 bites.My son got through a third of his before he gave up due to the strong flavor of char. I was granted the ""friends and family discount."" Postrio only charged me $37 for that shameful mess. Jerks!

Front and back of house were a well-oiled machine designed to lighten wallets and deliver awful food. Postrio earned the title of worst burger in Las Vegas. On the day that I visited, the quality of the burger and service was excremental, and that was being generous.

yes, appetizer portion, but i knew i had to save room for dessert.  my ideal type of meal is usually 60% protein, 30% veggies, and 10% carbs, and this dish delivers exactly that.  executed so well, each bite was heavenly.  the sausage on the far right had pistachios, so pistachio lovers -- make note.  the fuchsia looking vegetable adjacent to the pistachio sausage is actually pickled watermelon.   it's not the typical watermelon that one would purchase at the local market.  this type of melon had the tight texture & consistency of a daikon or a radish, yet it was a watermelon.  

CHOCOLATE MELTING BEIGNETS were fabulous! ($12)
the chocolate beignets were oozing with warm chocolate filling and dusted with powdered sugar.  one proper spoonful of ice cream  was the perfect complement to the warm beignet.  the vanilla dipping sauce was just an icing to the dish -- it was great, but not necessary, but definitely did not hurt it at all.  for a dessert, everything was ""not too sweet"" either, which is always perfect in my books.

So good that even though I was stuffed after the first bit, I pushed myself to eat one half of the sandwhich and then eat the other halfs lobter only. As far as the fries are concerned, they were made just how I like them. Super thin, crispy, and covered in salt and pepper. They reminded me of a better version of McDonald's. (I know I know I shouldn't compare these two places, but I do love there fries...Sorry).

As far as dessert, we had another array of desserts. Now even though I was super stuffed, I had a little bit of room for a taste test. We had apple strudel. mini chocolate donuts filled with camel, strawberry souffle, and a smore cake. My favorite was the smore came. Graham cracker bottom, dark chocolate fudge middle, and then topped off with a torched marshmallow. Yum YUm YUM!!!",-hxUwfo3cMnLTv-CAaP69A,0,0,4,5UQSWOKlZ4qAcVfFGseoPA

Ordered an Arnold Palmer -- the glass was NEVER empty.  They refilled/replaced it when I was only half done (ice melted too much?) Excellent service!!!

The beet salad had really good beets but really salty salad.  

The bread served in paper bag ~ cute!!

Only one in our part ordered an appetizer, but they made the rest of us wait through his eating it (instead of asking us if we want to order some food for the rest of the table or asking us when we want to be served).  So, we ended up all staring at him while he ate his soup.

The mushroom pizza was good, but the lobster sandwich was not as impressive as a good old New England lobster roll and the salads apparently were just, plain (according to those who ordered it).

For a saturday night, the service was extremely fast and the waitstaff friendly.  While the food itself was not of the ""blow your mind"" variety, it definitely is a step up from your average chain restaurant.  I had the wine infused oxtail with herb papperdelle noodles, asparagus, and wild mushrooms.  Also present at dinner were a mushroom broccolini pizza and a Burata cheese ravioli.

The oxtail dish was good - hearty but not overly so and the wine sauce paired decently with the herbed pasta and the mushrooms. There was something missing to the dish though - each component by itself was tasty, but the dish in toto was only good, not outstanding.  Overall not so disappointing as to offend, but not so spectacular as to prevent some slight regrets for not ordering the ciopinno instead.  

The pizza stood much better as a whole experience, though the dough reminded me too much of pita and also too much of how delicious the crust at pizza delfina is in comparison. 

The burrata (burata?  am I even remembering what the name of this cheese is?) ravioli was the crown jewel of the meal, IMO, mainly because of the cheese itself.  Smooth and buttery without holding too much liquid or falling apart, this cheese may be my new favorite, even compared to the uncomparable bufalo (if not simply because I love saying Bufalo :D).    There was a strong garlic flavor to the accompanying red sauce.  

Both the ravioli and the papperdelle were rather al dente, perhaps overly so for freshly made pasta, but still tasty enough for me to finish.

Also terrible but I was not about to return two cocktails.

They brought bread over which tasted pretty fresh. The busser brought over our drinks, I wanted an ice tea that was unsweetened but he upsold me to a mixed tea drink. He was unclear if it was unsweetened (which it wasnt) but I drank it anyway. 

We ordered fried calamari as an appetizer. It was good, soft and not too tough nor chewy. I was surprised at the taste of the Thai sweet sauce compared to the marinara. I actually would prefer the Thai sauce now! I recommend this dish. 

I ordered the lobster ravioli and my wife ordered the cheese and bolgnese. We waited for a little bit but not as long as I thought it would take from the other yelpers.

The outdoor seating in ""St. Marks Square"" looked horrible, but the atmosphere inside the restaurant was actually very nice, with widely spaced tables. However, service was uneven--it started off pretty good, but then it seemed like our waiter disappeared during most of the meal.

After ordering drinks, the waitress (or accomplice) told us about the specials.  One appetizer caught my ear - shrimp, oysters,  clams and half a boiled lobster on ice.  I said ""Let's have one of those, then we'll order."" She asked ""Would you like it for the table?"" ""Yes,"" I replied, ""We'll share it."" So she brought two to the table. I only ordered one but it's just an appetizer, why not? So here we see two bowls of ice with a few small shrimp, a few oysters and half a baby lobster - $135 each.  Nice!

2870847,2010-05-28,1,PwpSY0vO3XlQXKOuqiqZMQ,"The first tip I would give for diners at Postrio is to not sit ""outside,"" as they call it.  The inside of the Venetian is exquisite and luxurious and fantastic, but it's not ACTUALLY going to convince you that you're outside, and sitting on the ""patio"" outside the restaurant left us feeling like we were eating in a mall.  Go sit inside, which looked beautiful and quiet.

The sangria is tasty, but not the best I've ever had.  The cherry margarita was artificial tasting, and while everyone else at our table lauded the pom-ojito, I wasn't a huge fan.  They brought out warm tuscan bread with butter and olive tapenade, which I could have made a meal of all on its own.  I could go for some now, actually...

Our food was kind of give-a-little, take-a-little.  The heirloom tomato caprese salad was easily the best I've ever had, with burrata that is gooey and creamy at room temperature, pesto oil, and a balsamic drizzle.  It was the kind of salad you eat slowly to let every bite spread out on your tongue.  I just wish it was bigger... one lump of burrata, four slices of tomato, $15.  Ouch, Wolfgang.

Two of us got the ribs, which got an ""eh"" review and came with onion rings that are a dead-ringer (HAR, get it?) for Sonic's.  Not a bad thing; I love Sonic onion rings, I just wouldn't expect to find them at Postrio.  My Mother got the chicken piccata special, which is normally dredged and sauteed, and came deep-fried, which was not mentioned on the menu.  She's not a deep-fried type of person, so little hiccup there.  Dad got the prime ribeye in a cognac mustard sauce with parmesan frites that was all so, so, so delicious, but came out rare when he ordered medium.  

Aunt got the bouillabaisse with seafood tortellini, which were cold, and apparently got hard when reheated.  She complained and was coddled by a manager, who comped her meal and brought her out dessert on the house despite her protests.  Super, super classy.

I was the ""big winner"" with shrimp pesto pizza with broccolini, sun-dried tomatoes, fresh tomatoes, and something a wee bit spicey that was perfection.  The pizzas are some of the most reasonable things on the menu, and they're huge - our server, Brandy, said 10"", but I thought mine was closer to 11"" or 12"".  It went around the table and I STILL took home a slice and a half.  So much shrimp, so much pesto, so much crust... I'm drooling a wee bit.  

My pizza and the bread easily saved the rating, here.  OH, and dessert.  My aunt's strawberry shortcake was okay, but my cousin got a chocolate cheesecake for her birthday, and ""Happy Birthday"" was written on the plate in melted chocolate.  It was beautiful and yummy.  I got chocolate beignets filled with molten chocolate, served with caramel ice cream and a vanilla bean dipping sauce.  The doughnuts themselves were a tad salty, but the whole package together was perfect.

The general consensus after dinner was that it was way too pricey for the number of missteps, but the service was impeccable, and there were indeed some very high notes.  I think I'd go back for lunch, or even just for pizza and wine.  (What, you've never had?  It's secretly the world's most perfect combination.

If I'm going to spend $30-40/plate I don't want to be seated with strangers ala McDonald's.  Postrio doesn't make you sit with strangers so they immediately got an extra star from me.

They offered us the option of sitting in St. Mark's Square or in the dining room.  My husband indicated that it was our anniversary and let the host make the choice for us.  He sat us in the dining room because it's a bit quieter in there and we could sit closer together in a booth.

I had a martini with hennessy in it (sorry, don't remember the name) and an elderflower martini.  The hennessy martini was delicious!  My husband had a beer - don't remember which one.

I ordered the pancetta wrapped meatloaf, and my husband ordered the Kobe beef.  After tasting both, we agreed that mine was better... although I really enjoyed the chimichurri sauce on his beef.

We were told that we could sit at the bar if we wanted to sit soon and being that we had gondola tickets in 80 minutes and hunger right then and there, we chose the bar.  We were told it would be the same menu.  We are seated in what would be a very nice booth anywhere else but here they refer to it as sitting at the bar becuase its not at the main restaurant.  We are given the Cafe Menu.  I ask for the Tasting Menu and the waiter goes into this whole long song and dance about how there are two different menus and two different chefs and his chef will say no.  At this table with me is a waitress at another 4 star Vegas restaurant who totally joins me in making fun of this fool who just bascially told us we cant spend $100 a person here because we are seated on the other side of a halfwall and we can only spend a total of $100 for 3 people.  This weird waiter must work for some other reason then tips.  
In the end however, the food won out.  
The ""Liquid therapy"" menu hit the right spot with a ""Flirtini"" but not so much with the Mango Martini.  The bread served in a bag with some of the creamiest butter was simply heaven.  
The dishes were served with excellent presentation.
As they were laid out on the table, quirky waiter returns with gusto asking how everything is. Um, buddy no one has tasted anything yet.
He comes back 5 minutes later to ask again while we are all midchew. 
When we could talk we reported its goodness.  My experience with 3 or 4 cheese ravioli in a cream sauce is that the cheeses are muted.  Here however, the cheeses each came alive with each bite.  The sauce and the roasted pine nuts and chopped grape tomatoes were a perfect blend.  The pesto cream sauce needs to be finished, every last drop from your plate with the good bread.  
It's too good to leave a drop!
The couscous was light as air and the chicken fettucine was also mixed to combine but not overpower the natural tastes, so I was told.  
So it could have been the waiter that marred the experience but all in all, I would say it was very good but not as amazing as its San Francisco companion.",vDzJZHf1uF63LoG0DFZn2w,0,0,4,9YKCrYvAQ_OFl4e4LUdnRA

3015097,2010-03-29,0,PwpSY0vO3XlQXKOuqiqZMQ,"Because I couldn't find Brasserie, we ended up at Postrio for lunch the other day.  I was impressed with the nice cafe atmosphere and the menu was smiple enough, so we gave it a try.

We were seated and it took a moment for us to get the server to acknowledge our presence after taking our drink order.  I'm not sure whether he was waiting for us to signal him down, but it took about seven  minutes from our drinks to taking our order.  I was a little frustrated at this, but wanted to give him a second chance and so we ordered our food and waited.

The salad came five minutes after he took our order, two Caesar's,  one without anchovy.  Their salad is baby romaine lettuce stacked on each other with grated cheese, tossed in the dressing and served with one crouton.  The flavors were good and a nice change from the tossed, chopped ones I get at Morels or Golden Steer.  that was 19 dollars.

The food took about 18 minutes after the salads to arrive.  I felt that this was quite long and was trying to flag a server down to ask if they could check for our food.  Either we looked too young to take seriously, or I caught this place on a bad day, but it is still no excuse for the lack of attention we received.  We ran out of water and drinks awhile back and no one checked up on us, so that was a bit frustrating.

When our food did arrive, it was presented well and the portions were a good size.  The large spaghetti was split between my niece and fiance in two separate bowls and looked like a hefty portion, so the 17 dollar price tag was understandable.  The pizza was large as well, about a medium pizza if you order delivery.  The lobster sandwich looked like a good size, too, but instead of a kaiser roll they use toasted grain bread.

Pepperoni, olive and tomato pizza with fresh basil: Good crust, nice taste to the dough as well.  the toppings were lovely and had a nice, salty flavor.  The olives were good and not cooked all the way through, but that was fine for me because I don't mind the texture.  Overall, the pizzas at any Wolfgang's are good.

Spaghetti with meatballs: Five dollars extra for those meatballs, just to warn you.  The pasta is made fresh there, and you can tell by the color and texture of the pasta.  It came roma tomato chunks and lots of cheese, so that was nice.  The sauce had that right amount of tanginess to it and spice.  The meatballs are very good and well flavored.  you still get the meat taste with a hint of Italian spice.  Quite a lovely meal.

Lobster sandwich: Good lobster, very sweet and succulent.  It's a cold sandwich, of course, so the mayo and other ingredients mixed with the lobster were really fresh and light.  The bread is heavy, however, so my husband took the tops off of the halves to avoid getting overfilled.  The fries and skinny fries and are your typical hotel fries.  Overall the sandwich had good flavor but we expected something more.  It almost felt as if this particular dish was missing something, but I couldn't place my finger on it.

For 160 dollars for lunch (I did tip 20% because the service went up from the meal, on) it was okay.  I am not a fan because of the initial service we received, but the food was good.  I like Puck's restaurants, but I won't go out of my way to eat here again.

If you like the cafe feel in Venetian and want something fair and fast, this is the place to go.  I know people are giving it five stars for food, but for my personal taste it wasn't exciting and lacked any ""wow"" factor that it should have for that price tag.

Let me start off by saying that if there is a restaurant that you won't even return to if it was free, then you know it was a horrible experience.  That's been the situation twice for us.

We go to Vegas at least 5 times a year and because of the fact that I'm an avid gambler, our room at the Venetian is always comped.  Along with that comp comes a food credit to Postrio, so our meals are basically free here.

The first time we went there, the hostess was so snobby...she won't say a word until you ask for her assistance.  As a matter of fact she'll just stare at your face without saying anything and won't look away until you say ""hi"" or ""for 2 please"".  Servers, almost the same attitude.  We asked for bread and butter before the meal, as anybody would expect at a semi-steakhouse, and they said ""no"" at first, followed by ""fine, but we usually don't give out bread and butter as we have to bake the bread first"".  I'm not kidding, that's what she said.  It was the same the second time we went there, if not worse.

The courses are pretty good but the service is such a turnoff that even if the meals were free I wouldn't eat here...and for me the meals are free.",_ryEVFl2gYW_N9LV-GVGzw,1,0,2,kkKBBmoGLBOg8DOFZXEPhA

Main Course:
Steamed Black Mussels in White Wine Garlic Broth, Grilled Sourdough with Béarnaise Sauce

The mussels were plump, fresh, and cooked perfectly. The white wine, garlic broth was good. It would have been perfect to sop the sourdough into the broth, but unfortunately they smothered the bread with béarnaise sauce, which I didn't care much for.

Our waitress selected the two desserts for our table as a birthday celebration for my friend. I dipped a beignet into the vanilla sauce, topped it with a spoonful of caramel macchiato ice cream, and then ate the whole thing in one bite. It was good with the liquid center. Not too rich or heavy.

They quickly sat our large group and took good care of us. The hand-cut linguini with shrimp and calamari was very good, but a little miss labeled. It was labeled mildly spicy,  but it was more then mild. It got my tongue and mouth tingling after just a couple of bites. Even though I do not like spicy foods, I ate every bite because it was so good. My stomach did pay the price a little later though. 

I was also able to steel a bite of my wife's burger, and I wish I could have stolen more. The burger was fantastic and their pizzas look good too.

3270993,2009-07-29,0,PwpSY0vO3XlQXKOuqiqZMQ,"Went here for dinner with my girlfriends when we first got to Vegas.  I've been to Spago in Caesar's before, and thought it was very similar.  I was really looking forward to their pizza since I loved the pizza both at Spago and at Wolfgang Puck Express, and while it was good here, it didn't seem as good as what I've had before...I think the crust could have been a little thinner and more crunchy.  All 3 of us were starving though so we practically inhaled the pizza anyway.

For main course, I got the burger, which was excellent and perfectly juicy...I only wish I hadn't filled up too much on their pizza since this was so much better.  The fries were perfectly fried, and crispy just the way I like it.  I was already way stuffed but I kept picking at the fries towards the end of the meal.

Probably my largest criticism here is that their wines by the glass really sucked.  I gotta admit that I'm a little picky when it comes to wines, but for a ""nice"" restaurant like this, I thought that I would at least get something that didn't make me grimace when I drank it.  I got the pinot with the pizza, which was bleah and a little vinegary to me (maybe it had been open for a while?), then got a malbec with my burger which was a little better but still meh.  I got several $10-$20 bottles at home that taste better than this stuff.

One thing I really liked though was the location.  You had that pseudo-outdoor feel with the fake sky and all, kind of reminded me of those restaurants in italy with the outdoor tables.  Of course in this case, you're in a mall, but it was nice nonetheless, and we got to people-watch as we ate dinner (always a fun thing to do in Vegas).

Boo for them though for not giving me the 1000 points for the opentable reservation when I booked it on my iphone (it was 1000 points when I looked it up on my pc earlier).  At least we had a 25% off coupon that came with our room at the Venetian, so our whole dinner wound up being pretty reasonable (for Vegas).

All in all, don't really regret going here, since we had a discount and they took reservations at the last minute, but don't know if I would actually seek out this place again given that there are so many great restaurants in Vegas.",R5i-8R4vBov0wfNBGg2MwA,0,0,3,9Cwfj_DYmpcgz2MazrImrA

I can make BETTER risotto at home.  I did not bother to complain because I knew there was no point - I just had to survive through my next entree.  My husband had Ravioli with Ricotta, Spinach & Soft Quail Egg, Grilled Quail and Thyme Glaze - it was OK with alot of holiday seasoning.

My dinner entree was Grilled Prime New York Sirloin, Yukon Gold-Horseradish Potatoes, Cognac-Mustard Sauce - $54.00.  I can honestly say the steak was seasoned perfectly and the cognac-mustard sauce was excellent.  My husband had Slow Braised Beef Short Ribs, Creamy Polenta, Olives, Shallots and Natural Juices - not bad either...but then again, how can you screw up short ribs?? Just braise it to death and you'll be OK.

Service was exceptional - don't bother filling up on free bread, try to enjoy your expensive entrees because I didn't finish half my steak and didn't want to carry a doggy bag around :(

3329843,2012-08-25,0,PwpSY0vO3XlQXKOuqiqZMQ,"My twin sister and I headed to Vegas for the weekend to celebrate our birthday.  Knowing we had limited time in the city, we did our best to plan for a dinner near our hotel (the Tropicana) and near where our show was (Planet Hollywood).  However, after much searching, we couldn't find anything that in that south part of the strip we'd risk that much money on a dinner for.

It was Saturday night over a hot and busy Vegas weekend, and it was getting pretty late before we had to decide on something.  So, we pulled out our smartphones -- one of us on OpenTable and the other on Yelp.  We agreed on Postrio and drove over.

We could not have been happier.  We were promptly seated in their ""outdoor patio"" area, and our waiter was quick with everything.  We had ordered the calamari, the herb pappardelle, and the prime rib eye.  Atypically, we skipped on any alcohol, but since we were already drinking for free the whole day out playing in the casinos, we thought we'd save some money on the alcohol (we also had a couple of bottles waiting for us in the hotel).

The pasta was just what I needed -- creamy and thick, yet delicate in flavor, and everything was fresh.  But, next time, I'm ordering the prime rib eye, because that cut of meat was probably the best I've tried in a long time.  Came with potatoes and veggies.  All of the serving sizes were substantial, we came out full.

Now, I recommend doing your research on a place you plan to go to, before you go, because if you don't know what something is on a menu when you get here, and you don't have the balls to ask, then you shouldn't be disappointed when you order it, you get it, and you're not happy with it.  That said, I knew that Wolfgang Puck had a great reputation, his restaurants don't typically find me anything but satisfied, and the reviews on Yelp seemed promising.  I didn't want to order anything I didn't think I knew, so we went with pasta and steak and were extremely satisfied.

Easily used my $20 OpenTable gift certificate, and the restaurant also did a beautiful complimentary birthday tiramisu.  Thanks, Postrio.  We'll be baaaaack!",MZxpfo6fVI7bNG6q50XZKA,2,1,5,zwxS72SGlfVPOT90LDDQDQ

We had a couple of different pizzas and a couple of different sandwiches.  All were shared and all were equally enjoyed.  How could it get much better?

Service was excellent.  Dignified but not snooty.  The water boy even ""blocked"" teh glass with anapkin when he poured to ensure not to splash on the food.  What nice touch!

I graded a bit harshly (and feel a little bit embarassed to do so), giving only four stars, because one of the white napkins set at our table had a very visible smear of tomato sauce.  Although that situation was discretely corrected within 2.68 seconds of bringing it to their attention, I would have expected the bus staff to have seen that when setting up the table.

Many thanks to Chef Wolfgang Puck and his staff!

Why can't I seem to remember much that happened to me before here, but somehow I have a strong feeling I need to be here to fulfill a promise... what? I don't know.

My senses... smell, touch, sound, sight... all coming to.  Where is this place?  This place seems so familiar to me, but I know it's not home.  Looks like a place I've seen somewhere in books, in pictures, on the internet at one point in time in my life.  I see lots of people and beautiful shops.  Many look like tourists.  I hear the voice of a tenor serenading... the soothing echoes of a language I can't seem to understand find me through this leisure crowd.  The overwhelmingly pleasant aroma of italian spices is making my stomach sing a very different song.  I need to get something to eat.  As I walk along shops of elegance and charm, I see a canal where boats carry lovers throughout this seemingly romantic place.  Ah yes... these boats... I know these boats.  They are gondolas!  Venice, Italy!  But how did I manage to get all the way here when I'm sure I was in the US last night?!?!  This is starting to scare me.  If I retrace to the last thing I remember, it would be.... Las Vegas.  I was in Las Vegas walking into a club.  Now I'm in Venice.  Everything in between... nothing.

I feel something in my pocket.  My phone is going off.  A text from my friend. 

Sonja: Are you here yet?  I'm hungry!  My break is only 45 mins!
Me: You're in Italy too?
Sonja: What are you talking about?  I thought we were doing lunch during my break?
Me: I don't know but I'm sure I'm in Venice right now because I see gondolas and I hear someone singing in Italian.
Sonja: OMG!  Quit messing around and hurry over to St. Mark's Square!  I'm here.
Me: I'm serious.
Sonja: Are you still drunk? You're not in Venice... You're at the Venetian... where I work... in Las Vegas... you drunkie!!!!!  
Me: Oh....... It all makes perfect sense now!  See you in 5 mins.

Hangover 4?  Nah.  It'd just be a blank script.  What this hungry dude needs is a good brunch to fill his blank inner canvas with flavor.  In matter of minutes, I found my friend arms crossed, tapping her toes, giving me that ""fail"" smirk right in the heart of St. Mark's Square... a beautiful open space where different restaurants are set up for outdoor dining indoors (was that an oxymoron?).  She says, ""My lunch is short now because of you... let's go Postrio since it's quicker.""

Service is amazingly friendly and welcoming.  To feed my hangover and empty belly, I order the Smoked Salmon Eggs Benedict w Crispy Seasoned Potatoes.  It's so good!  Eggs perfect with oozy yolks and the hollandaise has just the right touch to go with the toasted english muffin and savory smoked salmon.  Potatoes are so nice and crispy with a very appetizing seasoning.  I see chicken apple sausage and have to add that to the side.  Get it.  Juicy bites of sweet n savory sausage makes the perfect addition to an all American meal.  I'm stuffed.  

In my confused state of existence, I couldn't ask for a better brunch... familiar and American, in an Italian setting, below gorgeous weather, where gondolas float, love birds cuddle, tenors serenade, and hungover people grub.  Ok... person.  I think I was the only one there hungover.

What a great place to eat in vegas.  You get to listen to the live performances while enjoying a fine italian bistro/fusion style dinner.  We ate an early dinner, around 5:15pm (we had a show at 7), and there was no wait.  In fact, it was pretty much empty except for a few diners.  Here's what we had for dinner:

1) Caeser salad (split): Pricey and small, but it was good.  Wolfgang sure knows how to pick out his cheeses.  The sliced parm on the salad was fantastic.  My gf usually doesn't like cheese and even she thought it was very tasty.
2) Pepporoni pizza: Pretty decent pizza.  Not the best I've ever had, but it was good.  Crust was baked thin and crispy, sauce wasn't overwhelming, pepporoni was tasty, and the sliced tomatoes were a nice touch.
3) Chocolate Souffle: This wasn't very good.  Though it only took 15 minutes to make, this quick rise souffle was waaay overcooked.  The vanilla bean sauce was good, but the souffle tasted like a chocalate cupcake.
4) Pitcher of sangria: Probably one of the best sangria's I've ever had...it was REALLY refreshing after a day of vegas.  The amount of sangria in the pitcher is perfect for two people.  The pitcher set me back $25, but this IS vegas afterall.  Filled about 6 wineglasses so it's actually not a bad deal.
*) Almost forgot to mention that they have a very tasty bread.  Loved the chewy texture.

I had a great experience here and will definitely return.  There's just something about sitting and eating under the venetian blue sky that soothes the mind.  I'd recommend the cafe sitting over the indoor restaurant.  While it looked nice inside, it didn't feel romantic.

This is both a good thing and a bad thing since I could not hear what the staff was saying while the performances were going on, but other members of my party seemed to enjoy the experience. Due to the place being inside the shops, the ceiling is painted as the sky, so it's kind of hard to classify it as ""outside"" or ""inside"" seating, since the seating we were placed at was inside the mall's open air plaza. I think I'll avoid discussing this since I'm not sure how to describe it.

The food is particularly expensive, but once again, someone else paid for me. Taste-wise, it is slightly better than the places I've compared to from Orange County with no sourness in the food and no low-quality ingredients from what I can tell. They were nice enough to inform us of any potential food allergies we could encounter.

Case in point - The Venetian. Everyone knows about the statues and the carefully painted walls of sky, but it's also nice that they coordinate their businesses to go with the outdoor theme indoors. Other case in point - Postrio (inside The Venetian). 

My girls took me here for a pre-bachelorette festivities dinner. My first thought on in this place was ""Argh, another Italian place? Ok, just smile and pretend to like it."" My second thought was, ""Oh cool, they've got sleek, modern-looking planters and an ""outdoor"" patio in front of the ""inside"" inside restaurant.""

I kicked off the meal with a glass of Sangria, pleasant, but not much kick and I've definitely had better (my fave is Fresca in San Francisco). I ordered the Porcini Mushroom Ravioli and a side of asparagus, I hadn't eaten since breakfast and thought the ravioli wouldn't be enough. 

The ravioli skin was tender and the savory sauce marinated beautifully with it. I gave my friend a taste, and she liked it so much, she kept dipping her bread in it! 

The asparagus was presented with two types - the traditional green and also, white. Sauteed asparagus seems a hard one to master, and though the dish was better than average, I'd suggest cooking longer as the outside was a bit chewier than I liked. 

After polishing off my meal, which would have been filling enough with just the ravioli, I had a bite of my friend's Spaghettini Pasta...it was phenomenal for just noodles and marinara! I literally had one bite, as I was very full already, but that spaghetti was likely the best spaghetti I've ever had.

I was here two times for group business dinners during a recent trade show convention. The first time was a rather large group of about 80 people, while the second time was a smaller group of about 25 people. The organic baby kale salad with artichoke, spring onion, baby carrots and feta cheese was very nice. In fact the quality of the feta cheese was very unusual.

My husband treated me several years ago to a wonderful meal at this Venetian hotel/St. Mark's Square restaurant, and it was the highlight of our trip.  We have returned since to Vegas but hadn't had the occasion to visit Postrio again.  We have often talked about how wonderful that first visit was; the waitress was especially accommodating in making recommendations and the food was magnificent.

Guess what?  This time was no exception!  We chose Postrio for a small business group dinner and were so impressed.  Appetizers we chose were crab cakes, the cheese/honeycomb/quince/pink lady apple/candied pecans, etc. plate, and the sausage trio.  All were excellent.  Our server, Erin, was exceptional in describing the main courses avalable, and as it was late my husband and two others chose the salmon.  All remarked on how tender and flavorful this meal was.  I have never tasted duck, having been told that it is very greasy.  Again, Erin's description had me intrigued, so I tried their special.  Such a wonderful dish!  

Another review mentions the chocolate beignets-if you love chocolate and don't want too sweet a dessert, this is the one for you!  Another in our party requested creme brulee (though it is not on the menu) and the chef made an especially lovely one with fresh berries.

It is not too fine a point to make that one member in our party was about an hour late.  Erin also had two large parties of wedding guests while we were dining - but we were never made to feel rushed or in any way less important.  I guarantee everyone was well-served.

We are definitely comfortable sharing this gem with our friends and business acquaintances.  Afterward, a trio of musicians treated guests to a lovely concert on the stage in St. Mark's Square, just beyond Postrio's ""outdoor"" dining area (we had eaten inside the restaurant itself).

3876950,2008-08-16,1,PwpSY0vO3XlQXKOuqiqZMQ,"Postrio is one of many Wolfgang Puck restaurants in Vegas.  I read somewhere that Puck has single-handedly put Vegas on the map as a culinary destination.  Back in the day (before my time), Vegas was home to $1.99 pancake breakfasts with a slice of ham steak and two eggs any style and all-you-can-eat buffets comprised of questionable food stuffs.  Now, you will find so many top chefs have taken a gamble (no pun intended) and opened high-caliber restaurants thus further raising the bar for newcomers.  

Postrio has two separate dining areas with corresponding menus, the ""outdoor"" and indoor areas.  We chose the outdoor seating because we were accompanied by my darling two year old nephew. 

I order a small plate of heirloom melon with prosciutto, figs and a cheese filled cookie/cracker sweetened by honey.  It was delicous.  All of the flavors blended seamlessly.  The only thing that irritated me a bit was the fact that the servers brought my salad/small plate at the same time they served my entree.  Personally I prefer my salad as a first course then the entree.  But the taste of the item (delish) made up for the weird timing.

My dad and I were still pretty full from lunch so we split the margherita pizza.  Since Wolfgang Puck is synonymous with pizza, it was a must try.  Very tasty.  For dessert we all split this really yummy strawberry cream puff pie.  OMG so yummy!

I absolutely love Postrio's (and the Venetian in general) definition of 'patio dining.' Our large group of 10 was really hesitant to grab the patio because we were in town during the fall when it's quite cold outside. Well, we had the faux outdoor dining inside the Venetian so the temperature was very comfy. 

The service was okay, our server was slightly too slow in paying us attention and in our orders. They did help us celebrate my friend's birthday with a complementary dessert for her. 

Food was the tossup, really. The piece of calamari that I had was delicious, light and crisp. My friend Teri offered me some of her bouillabaisse and it was the best seafood stew I've had. Well, the downside was the reason why Teri offered me some of her food in the first place. My pumpkin tortellini, for $21, only had six measly pieces. The pasta itself was beyond al dente and was partially raw in the middle. There was not enough pumpkin stuffing inside. My friend Aries, who also ordered the same, and I looked at each other and thought that they might have split our order. There was nowhere near enough. That was the disappointing aspect of the dinner.

Our treatment versus others around us was atrocious.  After ordering and chatting up with my friend she pointed to tables around us.

A couple sat down after us and I overheard him offer them a bread basket, then he offered it to other tables that sat down.  

We bought a bottle of wine like we usually do and he was never around to refill our drinks, I got up once to do it myself and a busperson came over to do it for me.  I took care of him since Michael wasn't around.

My first trip to Las Vegas (like my second) was very short and sweet. My last family vacation before marriage, it was great fun but Vegas in June proved to be a mistake. 

Because of the sizzling temperatures we didn't leave the Venetian Hotel for 48 hours. The extreme dryness and cigarette smoke caused a few bloody noses and some yucky allergies, but we did manage to have some good family time before gratefully returning home. 

In a city with glorious high end food I maintained discipline a month before my wedding, but I did manage to scarf down the best chicken salad sandwich I've ever had at Postrio, Wolfgang Puck's cafe in St. Mark's Square. 

The moist chicken salad was combined with celery, apples, and port glazed grapes on pecan-raisin toast. Mom and I shared this sandwich and I was so sorry when my half was gone.",OfITV5ApuW7RpEvpOqJCqQ,5,4,5,cld0OTV2v6XHsnZok5k9uQ
4097550,2014-05-13,0,PwpSY0vO3XlQXKOuqiqZMQ,"Their menu was divided into Small plate, Medium plates, Large plates... 

Starter: I loved their bread with onions on it! It went perfectly with the fluffy butter spread (almost like whipped cream). It would have been better if it just came out of the oven or was heated... but still delicious nonetheless. 

We had the tuna small plate - which was kinda like sashimi with wasabi, tomatoes, olive oil and a splash of citrus condiment on it. Very smooth cut of tuna... but it was definitely no O-toro. I would have guessed it was Akami toro by the deep pinkish color of the cut. Very lean. Hardly any fats at all. I didn't care for the citrus taste. I thought it mashed weirdly with the olive oil and wasabi... but that's the risk with fusion, isn't it? Portion was also very small. 6 slices for $21. 

The next dish we had was the seafood linguine - Medium plate. It was a huge portion! Highly recommend by the server and he did not disappoint! It was delicious. Al dente pasta! Perfecto! Very generous helping of prawns and squid too. Would come back for this dish again!

I love their signature beignets... but unfortunately was too carbo loaded to eat another bite! 

Our server was very attentive and enthusiastic... granted there weren't many tables at 5pm but still kudos to great service :)",mLNFKajc56CqeZA6WkgREQ,2,1,4,T4z1gWqLp629c6zpNUEn9g

I've had the fliet, the duck and the tilapia (i think... it was like a year and a half ago. i know it was an obscene chunk of delicious fish).

4167645,2008-11-06,0,PwpSY0vO3XlQXKOuqiqZMQ,"Disclaimer: reviewing for the fine dining area.  Not the outside cafe-style seating, not the wine - just the fine dining.

Sad.

It makes me sad that a place I'd enthusiastically give 5 stars to two years ago has fallen to 3-star status in my book.

I liked this place enough that two years ago I've taken groups of 20+ people here twice, and been here numerous times since the first week of its opening (just like Aquaknox!).

It's not really so much the price - I do not feel that it is particularly more expensive than most other Vegas equivalents.  It's certainly more expensive than the other Wolfgang Puck establishments in Vegas until Cut came to the Palazzo, but it used to be well worth the money.

Slowly, but surely, the menu deteriorated as time went on.  From the first few times where I eagerly tried many different house recommendations to my most recent visit last month - numerous favorites have either gone the ways of Houdini or had its quality drastically cut.

I'll start with the seared John Dory.  John Dory isn't often served in restaurants, but this place had it seared to perfection.  It still remains in my memory as the most tender white flaky fish I ever had.  I wish I would have ordered it more the first few years, but I did not and I regret it.

Then, the Peking Duck was a great dish as well.  Low in terms of quantity, but superb in quality.  Besides, that just saves you room for more appetizer and desert.  It's almost always sold out early on into the night.  Now, I think it's replaced by a Duck Breast entree, that just isn't nearly as tasty.  Sniff.

They used to serve (domestic) Kobe Beef here, ya know?  Kobe Beef is not my cup of tea, but everyone else loved it.  That's not there anymore either - tis a shame.

But no worries, because without the Kobe Beef - they still had a house special ribeye that was very delicious.  Actually, that's gone too.

So what *is* left that's still pretty good?

Scallops.  I can't remember if it's an appetizer or entree, but per my usual ways we order it like an appetizer.  I remember one time I was so crazy about their scallops I came here and ordered 6 orders.  I think I scallop-overdosed, but it was a very memorable experience and one I do not regret doing again.

*Edit*

I forgot about the chilled seafood platter they serve.  It's excellent - yeah, that's one reason I'd go back.  Phew, almost forgot about that!

I don't think their pasta is bad, but there's plenty of better Pasta places in Vegas.  And by better - I mean, not even comparable better.

You know, based on my most recent experience I'd have given this place two stars based on how it stacks up versus all the other possible places you can eat at in Las Vegas.  But for the sake of what it used to be, and the possibility of what it can become again one day in the future - let's leave it at 3 stars.",WIrY6T0cuKnCY49M1mvspA,0,0,3,qHpI59gCxakisYcQtlzuxw

I ordered the bolognese here. Delicious! The pasta's texture was just perfect. It felt like it had substance. The spices in the sauce were subtle but tasty.

The best part of the meal was their chocolate beignets. They're not traditional beignets. The shape reminds me of a doughnut hole but the texture and taste reminds me of a molten lava cake. Creamy hot chocolate oozing inside covered by a crispy chocolate cake outside. We had two orders of that.

There are two seating options.  You can dine in their formal dining room which is more elegant and intimate or you can opt  for a more casual setting on their patio.  We opted for the patio so we could people watch and sit under the artificially painted blue skys of Italy.  

I'm a big fan of fusion food and I would label this restaurant as an American, Asian, and European fusion restaurant.  What was good here?  Everything we had.

4401073,2012-05-05,3,PwpSY0vO3XlQXKOuqiqZMQ,"I'm reviewing Postrio after eating there two separate times.  If you are staying at the Venetian or at the Palazzo, this is an excellent option for fine dining.  My husband grew up in Germany, so he shares Wolfgang Puck's love and admiration for all things schnitzel, hence a return visit.  

Most people were eating in the ""outside"" patio, where you can enjoy the beautiful faux Venice ambiance.  The lighting in this courtyard area is truly spectacular.  But, it is really loud and you are usually subject to some ""entertainment"" on the nearby stage, which has terrible sound.  So, we opted to eat inside the restaurant which was sleek and modern and quiet.  I much preferred this to the patio option, personally.

Our server was prompt and knowledgeable; accomodating without condescention.  We were served several kinds of bread, including a remarkably light and flavorful foccacia. We started our meal sharing the apple salad which was, quite possibly, the best salad I have ever eaten.  The ingredients in the salad were all top-quality and the salad had a perfect balance of textures and flavors, featuring morsels of aged blue cheese and spiced marcona almonds.  The fennel was shaved thin and the apples were mandolined; both kept crisp in ice water until immediately before plating.  I highly recommend this salad as I have never had anything quite like it anywhere else.

My husband had the schnitzel, served with a warm mustard sauce.  The pork was pounded flat and the breading was uniformly crisp and not overly heavy.  It came with a very small amount of potatoes and roasted tomatoes, that appeared almost an after thought to the huge pork cutlet dominating the plate.  The waiter told us this is always on the menu as it reminds Wolfgang Puck of his Austrian upbringing and he does the dish proud.  I ordered the Cioppino, featuring shrimp, clams and fish.  It was good, not great.  The seafood had fresh flavor and firm texture and was not overcooked.  The broth was heavily scented from fennel and tomatoes.  I don't know Cioppino as a dish very well, but I would be surprised if this is as good as it gets.  

All in all, a good option for those visiting the Las Vegas strip.  It's pricey, but certainly not the most expensive option in a very high-dollar area.

This has made a world of difference (I was never impressed with the restaurant prior to this change). This was our second time coming back since it's been re-done, and while everything is very good, a few items particularly stood out.

The Korobuta pork schnitzel with Austrian potatoes and whole grain mustard sauce that my dad ordered was fantastic (my husband and I had it last time), and is one of Puck's personal comfort foods so worth trying. The pork is pounded thinly and lightly pan fried, and rests on a bed of lemon and herb dressed fingerling potatoes. It is also served with a cooling cucumber yogurt sauce and mini sald of teardrop tomatoes. There is nothing wrong with this dish at all, and I can't imagine it being any better in Puck's home country. There was nothing wrong with my husband's dish either, which unfortunately was only a special for the evening. This was a large portion of two perfectly roasted quail served on a bed of fluffy gnocchi and freshly shucked spring peas, bathed in a rich and intensely flavored reduction. This should become a permanet fixture on the menu because it really was amazing. My entree of steamed black mussels with white wine, garlic, grilled sourdough lavishly spread with bernaise was very good, but somewhat disappointing in comparison to the version at his restaurant, Spago, in Beverly Hills. At Spago the mussels were petite and sweet, making it unique from other versions of steamed mussels, and the bernaise was prepared with a bit more skill. It's hard for me to evaluate the mussels here without thinking of the mussels there, so while the comparison was fun, I'd order something else next time.

The appetizers we had were good but I wasn't nearly as impressed with those as I was with the entrees. We had the mesquite grilled steak skewers with creamy celery salad and house made steak sauce, and the charcuterie plate with grilled bread, artisan cheese, and marinated olives. The former was good but didn't taste terribly original (the little salad was the best part) and the latter was missing a sweet element and could have used some work on the presentation. I understood from a business perspective that they were trying to make it look like a huge portion, but I prefer something that looks a little less like a deli tray when I order charcuterie. 

I forgot to write down the prices, and they aren't showing up online (I hate when restaurants hide this), but I can assure you Postrio is pricey. My advice would be to skip on the apps (or at least those that we got), get an entree, and limit your drinks if you want to experience the restaurant without breaking the bank.

I must clarify, however, that both times I ate in the cafe area, which is ""outside"" and not inside, which is where the fine dining is housed.  

To the important stuff, first the food:  I've been there with two separate parties, and we all really enjoyed the new american/mediterranean style food.  I always judge a restaurant by their french fries, so of course we started off with the pommes frites.  Perfectly seasoned, hot and crispy.  The aioli was a good accompaniment, but a tad on the rich side.  Besides, we still had loads full of starches to come.  Next we tried some of the flat bread pizzas.  Wolfgang Puck is famous for these, so you can't go to one of his places without trying these.  I love prosciutto, so the prosciutto with mission figs and blue cheese had to touch my taste buds.  I was pleasantly surprised by the crispiness of the crust despite the amount of toppings offered.  Also pleasantly surprising was how the blue cheese did not completely overwhelm the whole pizza.  My bf tried the spicy chorizo pizza, and he being a super carnivore, was very pleased.  

When I went with my mother, we split the fettuccine with english peas and arugula and the linguine with clams.   Both pastas were divine.  Although I love classic Italian pastas, al dente, if you are strict about this, then please be aware that the pastas at Postrio are freshly made and not dry.  

Portions here are very generous.  This is a welcome treat seeing as how every meal in Vegas can seem way too expensive, yet too small.  Hear that, Batali?  Now on to the bummerific:

The service is terrrible.  This is a blanket statement despite the fact that the food runners and bussers are very sweet.  Why, you ask?  The hostesses have a perpetual model scowl on their faces, I can never tell if the waiters are being sarcastic or if they really just need to be somewhere else, and the food takes foreeeeeever to come out.  I can deal with surly waiters (even if I still do tip 20%), and I can deal with a grumpy hostess, but I cannot starve while waiting for my food when there are only two other tables in the restaurant.

Ordered the chilled shrimp cocktail to start. The shrimp is still it's in its shell and won't be served in a glass. The shrimp were actually quite delicious and very meaty. The cocktail sauce was decent. Was it the best shrimp cocktail I've ever had? No. Was it better than the average shrimp cocktail. Yes. If you do decide to go to Postrio despite my review you can be assured the shrimp cocktail is not the reason why I gave Postrio two stars.

My main entree was the capellini pasta with grilled shrimp, calamari and spicy tomato sauce. You may notice that the menu actually includes mussels as well, but there were no mussels present in my serving. Also the capellini seemed overcooked and mushy. This was a huge disappointment. I can expect sub par pasta from a restaurant that doesn't specialize in Italian cuisine, but considering this is an Italian restaurant and a Wolfgang Puck restaurant no less, I was extremely disappointed.

Our waters were filled, drink and food orders were taken, then we waited for what seemed like a longer while before our food was served. There were a few salads and soups ordered which were served prior to the main courses. The Butternut Squash soup was amazing! Salads were fresh and the anchovies were also fresh. The other dishes came out and looked appetizing. Pizza's were ordered and shared among the table. The Fennel Sausage pizza was a bit on the bland side and not what was expected as far as taste goes. It pretty much was a Pepperoni Pizza with a fancy name. The Mushroom Pizza on the other hand was delicious. The Goat cheese really added flavor to it and complimented the mushrooms.

Visited Postrio for a bachelorette party dinner. The best thing I can say about the meal was that we were seated promptly. After that everything went downhill. For some reason it felt like our party was written off immediately after we sat down. We had 3 servers before the meal even came out of the kitchen and when the food did come out it was impossible to get a waiter's attention. 

I was expecting great food from a Wolf Gang Puck restaurant but was surprised to taste a rather bland pasta aka the Spaghettini Pasta w/ meatballs. The tomato sauce was not to my liking (there was no flavor) and the meatballs were red inside also, with no flavor. My fellow diners were not that impressed with their food either. The best dish at the table seemed to be the duck.  Being a foodie I was sad to find the best part of the meal was in a glass of wine.  

The restaurant is situated in the open in the middle of the Venetian Shopping Gallery. Definitely not a place to be romantic.

Of course, the ambiance is great in the Venetian.  We were sat outside next to the bar and got pretty decent service -- except my friend who sat in a corner behind a pillar got skipped over his water a couple times, but it's forgivable.

The food was good... nothing wrong with any of it.  Service was good, but not great (forgot to bring us bread, forgot orders of water) 

Four of us for lunch, ordered mixed greens, a pizza, burger, and fish.  Nothing was bad, everything was cooked right.  But it seemed a little sterile.  The food didn't ""jump""... and for the prices, they should.  The pizza was a bit underdone for this NY pizza-style lover.  It's fine for most on the west coast when black means overdone, but not for me, completely blonde on top means underdone.   Mild leopard-spots on bottom, but no ""crispy-ness.""
The fries were frozen (not fresh cut), and I highly suspect the dough for the pizza may have not been fresh made either.  Bun for the burger was also suspect.

If you're paying $19 for a burger and fries, everything better be freshly made if possible.  Another reviewer said ""best burger""... unfortunately this is pretty far from the truth.  The meat is cooked spot-on... and the overall taste of the red onion marmalade and cheddar was nice... but it was well-beyond Vegas tax.  I could have a similar burger at Island Burger & Shakes in HK for half the price and the same deliciousness.  (Just no frozen tasting fries to pay for)

I was prepared for a bit of ""Vegas tax"" and ""Puck tax"" but the food didn't quite justify the extra price for the burger.  It's a decent choice for other fare though.  Shoulda gotten up earlier to make it to Bouchon.  It's probably why there was a bigger line at Enoteca San Marco next door.",nQhxjCpGDgmkRZwhwwcOKQ,0,0,3,s4nwtCQeJum04RElE2vZbw

Price/quality ratio of food was just not good, and the food somehow reminded me of chain restaurant fare.

Often overlooking Wolfgang Puck restaurants given the Chef's general ubiquity throughout the United States it was at the recommendation of a local writer and with the assistance of Ms. Stephanie Davis of Puck's PR that a reservation was set for brunch at Postrio, and although some of the heavily praised plates from lunch and dinner were not available at brunch while dessert, originally stated as not available was, a noon meal beneath the pseudo-sky of St. Mark's Square at The Venetian proved mostly impressive - the disorganized service and surprisingly loud 'Carnivale' performers aside.

Themed as an informal indoor patio café with a menu covering a handful of WP classics as well as several Italian plates and California-style pizzas it was with complimentary Mimosas that the meal began and offering cheers to an old friend I'd not seen in some time the menu was perused with a three course order originally requested, a fourth only added at the end of the meal when it was revealed that the work of Kamel Guechida was indeed available, an offer I simply couldn't resist.

Joined by an interloping indoor pigeon who was almost as entertaining as the stilt walkers and singers to our side, it was after a long delay that the man who originally served our drinks was finally 'assigned' our table and with the lone special of steak and eggs declined it would not be long before two half-portions of pasta arrived, the wide pappardelle soft and smooth beneath bright tomatoes teaming with aromatic sausage while the al dente round noodles slicked with egg yolk and tossed simply with peas and pork was absolutely textbook, perhaps the best version of the dish served in a resort with no shortage of Italian options from which to choose.

Always amused by Puck's Pizzas, at this point a prerequisite for dining at any of his restaurants, it was with brief consideration of both the mushroom iteration that we opted for the newly added breakfast pie and although I'd have preferred the egg to be served runny after the baking process the general balance of the dish was admirable, a hefty amount of sharp cheddar and bacon most detectable on first bite with the light char notes of crust and vegetal notes lingering on the palate thereafter.

Choosing 'one of each' from the ""Batter and Breads"" section, suffice it to say that any disappointment regarding soups and sides available only at dinner were mostly forgotten and although the sticky bun was generally underwhelming both in size and in flavor while the stack of cinnamon dusted donuts was far less impressive than those served at Yardbird, the fluffy pancakes with pure maple syrup, blueberries, and candied lemon were absolutely excellent - the $13 price-tag notwithstanding.

Acknowledging that less 'batter' would have been ordered had I known desserts were ready to go it was without batting an eye that two of five delectable sounding options were selected to compliment a double espresso over ice and having last experienced Chef Guechida's work at Joel Robuchon it came as no surprise that the pastry chef's work completely stole the afternoon's spotlight with both the buttery brioche pudding loaded with chocolate beneath intense coconut ice cream and the pear-based sticky toffee cake with pecan studded ice cream the texture of silk absolutely mesmerizing, each elegantly presented and surprisingly restrained in a manner equally befitting the Grand Canal Shoppes or the MGM Grand's 3* crown jewel of the Chef's past.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,6,4,3,CllpwBkhYfLGN700777FNw

Uh YEAH, you are in a world class chef's restaurant in LAS VEGAS.  It's going to be pricey!

Having said that, I thought it was excellent all the way around.  

We went late, about 9:30pm after the Phantom show.   Plenty of seating available, we had a reservation but didn't really need one for the dining room.  Patio area was full and I do not think you can reserve that.

Service was outstanding.  Yes, the food takes a bit of time, but again, you are in a world class chefs house, not Chili's!

I had the free-range chicken which was beautifully cooked.  Everything on the plate was great from the chicken to the veggies.   And I will add, for being ""pricey"" the portion size was great, a full half chicken and a full plate of garnish and potato.  Sometimes at this type of place you expect a $30 chicken dish to be about 3 ounces of meat and a handful of carrots...not here!

Last time in LV I went to one of Puck's other spots, in Caesars I think but not for sure on the location, and it was not good.

The waiter was practically non-existent, and because we had seven people in our party, they applied an automatic gratuity of 18%, regardless of the poor service.

But pretty close.

Postrio is a restaurant within tne Wolfgang Puck empire; from LA to takeshitma st in Tokyo. I'd like to say it's one of his more formal ones but those restaurant days are happily long gone.

It's situated within the faux st marks square in the massive shopping precinct of the Venetian. There's an internal, lesser used restaurant area and a lovely open veranda area and bar,looking onto the square and the Batali/ Bastianich complex across the way.

With the outside area, you have the advantage of hearing the musicians playing Neapolitan classics ( in Venice?) and enjoying the general atmosphere under the faux blue skies. Best thing is shouting at the mimes, knowing they can't shout back.  


  We've been there twice, the first time having life changing truffles gnocchi. Sadly, on this visit, they were gone, but pleasantly replaced by similar ones filled with prime rib. Superb, but portions which would never be doled out by any Italian mama I know. Small would be a generous description. Also had the mushroom fettucine which was good.

Ended with a créme burl which was superb.  

A good culinary experience but I do believe they don't need to try experimenting with nouvelle cuisine portions, especially in Vegas.

Our waiter was around during the beginning, though almost everything else was taken care of by other servers. I can handle a slow kitchen from time to time, but it's a lot easier of a pill to swallow if your server is on top of it with drinks and bread to tide you over. 

There were 7 of us dining at Postrio last week - we started with some apps including the calamari/shrimp, house-made sausage trio and a roasted quail dish that isn't on the online menu. I only sampled the calamari and it was indeed tasty - I especially liked the sauce that came with it. Everyone seemed to like the other selections so that was a bonus.

For an entrée I was torn between the rib eye and something more Italian. I don't normally love gnocchi, but the description of the Ricotta Gnocchi sounded so great, I wanted to try it. It was very, very good. The ricotta in the gnocchi gave it a great flavor and texture that I usually don't associate with gnocchi - it was lighter, less dense. Overall really tasty.

Again, decent food but definitely sub-par service. With so many great restaurants in Vegas to choose from, I'll definitely give something else a try next time if we're dining at the Venetian.",c7_xsZYNs-_G6IceEW2WoA,0,0,2,S03gkXTGtTNF-wR1GL8lMA

The white/veggie pizza was also ok, but a little bland.  The truffle potato chips were a win, though!  Very tasty and fresh!  

The big draw for this restaurant, though, is that you are eating ""outside"" in the Ventatian's replica of St. Mark's Square.  That in itself is probably the best part of this experience.

I had potato soup with a black truffle gremolata and while there were definitely some kind of mushroom shavings in the soup, they didn't taste truffley - so hard to justify the $24 price tag without the truffle experience.

I've seen ""medium"" quail before, but it was cold inside too = not safe to eat.  They were cool when I asked them to redo the dish and brought it back in a jiffy cooked through.

We didn't regret the decision, as the entire experience was both relaxing and pleasant. Instead of sitting in the weird outside vibes area, we dined inside, where it was dark but quiet. We even had a little fireplace by us, and it was eerie to see the glow of the fake outside world through the doors.

Despite service being a bit confusing at times (our main waiter was slow, and we had two other people asking us for our orders at different periods), things came out timely and well cooked. My boyfriend and I shared the creamy potato leek soup which was definitely creamy and not too potato-like, but still good when served with the crunchy bread. 

Vegetarian fare was plain & simple - homemade pasta with a mushroom cream sauce. I'm used to this. Still a classic dish, and done great with some mini onions and a myriad of different mushrooms. It was definitely not salted enough so I asked my server, who was a bit taken aback, for a bit of salt. My boyfriend went nuts over the meatloaf & onion rings dish! I was happy about his excitement! :)

The dessert menu rocked!! I don't even know where to begin. I was so confused - definitely a huge hardship for the night. I chose the lemon pudding cake with blueberry compote & blueberry gelato, which was maybe my only mistake - a little too lemony/sweet, overpowering. I wish I had gotten the sweet potato pie!

-my husband ordered the HONG KONG STYLE HALIBUT.. which I thought was ok, but he loved it... it was a little too tart for me. He said you have to have each component of the meal to balance out. I personally would never order it.. but he would totally order over and over again.

5806992,2007-06-20,0,PwpSY0vO3XlQXKOuqiqZMQ,"Las Vegas food critic John Curtas (KNPR) picked Postrio as restaurant of the year for 2004, and named one of Postrio's dishes the best entre of 2005.  A member of the Wolfgang Puck stable, Postrio says it serves contemporary American cuisine, such as steaks, seafood, and those most quintessential of American foods: Italian pastas and pizzas.  Dinner is available in the informal cafe or the more formal dining room; lunch is available only in the cafe.  I opted for lunch.

The menu varies according to location (dining room or cafe) and meal (lunch or dinner).  The lunch menu offers such choices as pork wienerschnitzel, Hungarian goulash, and a lobster club sandwich, as well as pizza and pasta.

Lunch is served in the ""outdoor"" cafe portion of the restaurant.  It's open to the shopping area and trompe l'oeil sky.  The background noise level is generally not bad, but it gets a bit much when nearby performers start singing.

I ordered pork wienerschnitzel, Austrian potato salad, and whole grain mustard sauce.  It was a thin but obscenely large piece of pork - about 7"" by 10"" - crisp and not greasy.  A lemon provided needed acidity, and the mustard sauce was mild but had good flavor.  All in all, a good combination.  On the other hand, the potato salad was bland.  I was pleased with my lunch, but it wasn't anything spectacular.  Perhaps I'll need to give it another try at dinner time.",qDi5XvihmkuTWLhaw3f3Fw,0,0,3,nUi0dK2WYRB9E-0S_t4GbQ
5838041,2012-01-09,1,PwpSY0vO3XlQXKOuqiqZMQ,"I didn't know what to expect from Postrio, but was very pleased with my first meal here.  My party of four was seated in a booth in the main dining room after my party of four arrived five minutes before our 7:00 p.m. reservation and announced our presence.  After a few slices of good bread and butter, We began with a Jumbo Shrimp Cocktail and Spicy Tuna Tartare.  The Shrimp Cocktail was really unusual looking.  Six long and mostly straight shrimps lay on the plate, heads and all.  We cut off the heads, and then found that the cold shrimp meat was just as tasty dipped in a horseradish-based Cocktail Sauce as the more common curved variety.  These specimens were neither rubbery nor tough, and six of them was a generous serving.  The Tuna Tartare, with avocado, pickled ginger, cucumber, and crisp wontons, was just mildly spicy, moist, refreshingly cool, and delicious.

Next was one of the best Margarita Pizzas I have ever eaten.  It was orange topped with six red tomato slices evenly spread  around the circumference, with Mozzarella Cheese nicely melted over each slice of tomato, fresh basil haphazardly resting in place, on a crust that was supple but perfectly baked.  The outer rim looked hard but wasn't.  Slices were juicy, finished with San Marzano Tomato Sauce.  Our appetizer pizza was dispatched quite quickly; it could have served as a nice entree.  Later, when walking out of the restaurant, I saw two more Margarita Pizzas that looked just like ours, so there appears to me consistency in food preparation.

Home Style Chicken Soup was chock-full of cut vegetables and hunks of tender white chicken meat, and tasted great.  Caesar Salad was all good, with a spicy and creamy Caesar dressing, except a single anchovy was rather flat and pretty tasteless.  Clam Chowder with a few Parmesan crackers floating on top was a little rough: somewhat smokey and spicy in flavor, with undressed chunks of clams inside as if just plucked out of their shells.

Pancetta Wrapped Meatloaf with Mushroom Gravy, resting on a bed of Yukon Gold Potato Puree, with three buttermilk-battered Onion Rings on top, was really dense but very tasty--great comfort food!  A side of buttered Buttered Brussels Sprouts was okay, while multi-hued Cauliflower was visually appealing and nicely cooked--not too hard and not too soft.  The heads were orange, green, white, and black.  

 A Banoffee--Banana & Toffee Cream Pie--made with House-Made Toffee and Banana Cream in a Sugar Dough Shell with a thick crust, was a unique, cool and refreshing dessert.  Banana lovers will really like this dish, that includes a small pitcher of Toffee Syrup to pour over the large slice of pie as much as one desires.  Iced Tea was good and tasty, and a non-alcoholic Mint Iced Tea was even more refreshing.  

Service was excellent except that I had to request one Iced Tea refill, and two serving spoons for the sides.  Diane was accommodated by a requested substitution of very good Roasted Potatoes for Austrian Potatoes, and Buerre Blanc for a Mustard-based sauce.  In fact, I was leaning toward an award of five stars until the day after we dined there, when I was contacted by Open Table via email that the restaurant had reported my party as a ""no show.""  It was aggravating to have to prove that we were there after spending about $300 on dinner for four, but it was easy to do since our server had presented me with his card.  But the restaurant should perform better checking off of honored reservations than this, so 1/2 a star was lost for this irritating mistake.  But, overall, this was still a very enjoyable dining experience, and I plan to return soon to sample other intriguing offerings.

I opted for three appetizers, a spinach salad with apple shavings, pomegranates, candied walnuts, fennel and blue cheese, which was perfectly balanced so all the unique flavors and textures both stood out and complimented each other.

When I tasted the margherita with it's perfect bites of basil and savory mozzerella I thought, ""Damn, I'm so stupid to come to an Italian restaurant and not order pizza"".  The crusts were buttery, slightly sweet, and had an even golden color all around - I would liken it to a fancy version of CPK's.  I also tried the chorizo (might as well be thick pepperoni) and basil shrimp (delish!).  

I was feeling a little stupid for not getting something super Italian and carb-y but I relented when I saw my dish come out.

While I was not thrown out of this world by any of the food or service, it was a solidly decent meal.  It was our last meal in town, we were tired and ready to jump on the plane home and wanted something a bit more 'comforting'.  Postrio was able to provide this without fail. 

Our meal began with two tropical unsweetened iced teas (their standard iced tea) and an order of fritto misto of calamari, shrimp and summer veggies drizzled with balsamic vinegar and arugula.  It was cooked just right and the balsamic vinegar added a nice flavor (although to be honest, it took me a couple bites to figure out what the 'black' liquid was all over the food).

The husband ordered lasagna, which i personally wasn't all that impressed with - it seemed soggy and watery, although the sausage they used was homemade and tasted great.  He loved it.  I ordered an angus cheeseburger.  I asked for it to be cooked 'medium' and it came out medium well, which was okay since that is  what I usually order, but it definitely wasn't cooked as I had requested.  The fries were good and the pickle tasted homemade and I enjoyed every last crunchy bite of it.

Dessert was delicious as well and we had no problem polishing it off.  It was a blueberry gelato served over a blueberry crumble.  It was very good, but nothing phenomenal.

If you're looking for a culinary adventure, the cafe may not be the best stop, but it's great for a slightly upscale casual meal (with an upscale pricetag to go with it).

Calamari: Gluten free whaaaaat? But yes, it is! Not super crispy, but definitely nice flavor though slightly bland. Sweet and sour sauce instead of traditional cocktail/marinara. Not bad.

Caesar salad: Very fresh and crispy. For the price of $13 though? It really was a slab of romaine lettuce with dressing...

Roasted chicken with BBQ sauce pizza: Bf did not like this at all. Sauce was lacking and chicken was dry. Pizza crust was dense, yet tried to be a thin crust...not crispy. Honestly, the flavor just tasted off to me.

Kurobuta pork schnitzel: Um, it was a dry pork cutlet mashed thin and fried. The whole grain mustard sauce was good, but $27 for a pork cutlet is just not acceptable. Do not get this! Looks plain and tastes like it too! My friend did not even bother to finish it and ate her bf's food instead.

Free range chicken: Half a chicken over very smooth, slightly buttery potato puree. Veggies (brussel sprouts) were pretty good. the chicken was well seasoned and the natural au jus was flavorful as well, however some of the chicken was still dry. It is difficult to make moist chicken breast though, so I can't complain too much.

-garlic aoli french fries ($7): MMM this was the highlight of our meal. If you like soft or like yard house fries, you will definitely like this! They give you mustard and ketchup but you can really just eat it with no condiments. 

I would have given them a 3 stars, but the service was superb! The bartender checked up on us frequently and entertained us with questions and experiences about his trip to Europe. And when we packed the stuff to go, he gave us a cute little box for the pizza and an extra container of ketchup. 

Overall, i think this is a cute restaurant to go to for cheap food in Vegas! For under $30, you can feed two people for dinner! But then again, we had fat tuesday alcohol in our stomach and we're petite LOL",5re8RQ-2-Mkz7LC4ftYfHw,7,6,4,J_KBR1n0Jie9aSwPGIsGWA

That all changed this past weekend when I was in Vegas with my wife to celebrate her birthday, our 6 month wedding anniversary, and Valentine's Day. We had made reservations to another place inside the Venetian but since we didn't leave a credit card #, the reservation was cancelled. So we made a reservation at Wolfgang's Postrio which seemed like the only place that had space that evening.

My wife ordered the Seared Sea Scallops and I ordered the Prime Filet Mignon. Both dishes were amazing! The scallops were huge and so tender. But the star of the evening was the Prime Filet Mignon. Holy crap. I've had some great cuts of beef in my lifetime, but this was definitely tops. It was very flavorful and the meat just melted in my mouth. Before this experience, my favorite cut has been at Ruth's Chris Steak House. 

I heard there's a Postrio up in SF too, so now I'm going to have to plan more trips up to SF or Vegas.",lLUbi4Pp23ttt0hWjKrRIw,1,0,5,wFvzddE3SkdyuJ6SX7G5CQ
