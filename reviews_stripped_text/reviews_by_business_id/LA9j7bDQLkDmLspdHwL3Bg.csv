The lengua is great. I have had no complaints at this location. Their red hot sauce is on point with flavor all the time. We've been to MANY Roberto's in Las Vegas and they all fail compared to this place. Very friendly people who are rude if you don't speak Spanish.,eIuITpqIeMcLgMxo3KPZng,0,0,5,wt3wJC-LbviyGv7xCY-4sg

958037,2016-05-19,0,LA9j7bDQLkDmLspdHwL3Bg,"My husband and I were looking for a place to eat. We decided to stop by Roberto's and try it out. For $27 we got one shrimp and one fish burrito and combo # 17 which is Diablo skimp with beans, rice, lettuce and tomato on the plate with a side of two tortilla. The tortillas were home made and simply delicious. They have a hot sauce, cucumbers and carrot and jalape√±os bar. Even though the food was almost $30 it was worth every penny and to be honest we barely finished our food.  
Apart from all of the above, the bathroom was out of soap, so bring your own soup .",J6CKd3sTxFH1z_2dOP2spg,0,0,5,I3yzH4KDOx9l5sSz17OXsw

Decided to stop in and get me a carne asada breakfast burrito and guess what??? These fools are deep cleaning the grill so they're turning many of us away!!! It's 6:45 am on a Saturday and you decide to do this now? 

This is utterly ridiculous!!! Why wouldn't you do that at 3 or 4 am when there may not be as many customers? People like me think breakfast important and I couldn't get any cuz your staff decided at a peak time to deep clean the grill?

Get it together Roberto's. This is probably the 3rc time this has happened to me. Y'all really need to change that cleaning schedule!",KEerqlFNhzl1I-yVK6mHVA,0,0,1,D-eDohIkGgR4zkvh2RHflg
1372733,2018-01-11,0,LA9j7bDQLkDmLspdHwL3Bg,"While not the closest Roberto's to my house I still like coming to this location because the staff is nice and the place is kept clean. Along with that the sausage for the breakfast burrito are links vs patties which I find to be better so I love getting my breakfast burritos from this spot. 

This location has a small congestion parking lot since a lot people cut through it to get to Wal Mart or the gas station and there is a bus stop right in front of it so it gets a little crazy at times. But overall a great place to get some Mexican food.",c5tvQ7RYTYd8BQ1VMqVqNw,0,0,4,-CXu1gU7om3etqlnbdYniQ

3672108,2016-08-30,0,LA9j7bDQLkDmLspdHwL3Bg,Friend recommended recommended recommended to try the carnita fries. After I ordered it I was blew away by the size. I had to share it. So much goodness but my stomach didn't agree but still ate. I also tried a couple of things like fish tacos and I think the beef tongue tamales.,sydGUOlXHo4ZnntcbixY4g,0,2,5,o8rC7NMv957zC57IUa6tHw
4681423,2015-06-07,0,LA9j7bDQLkDmLspdHwL3Bg,"Me and the bf's to go place for a late night hunger. Lol out of all roberto's location we tried, this is the one we like because they are generous in giving meat and everything else (specifically speaking for carne asada fries and carne asada burrito) 

Staff: They're ok. Friendly but not too approachable. Doesnt smile lol but its ok for me(maybe they're tired or sleepy) coz we always go there like around 10pm literally only for a late night craving/hunger so understood if they dont want or not able to smile... 

Place: no complaints... We dont eat at their dining room coz we always take our food to go.

Food: big portion for the price. Sometimes they forget to put beans on my burrito tho!!!! Lol

All in all, 4 stars!",W5iGpA5vgaWRyt4nY4cYBQ,0,0,4,T9gUgvZgIoM7SU5IJCQKEQ

Throw back to Oakland, CA mexican food trucks!!

Low prices...excellent food!

The place wasn't very clean (floors, tables, etc.) At 2:30am.....when I arrived there was a full table of 4 giggling women, a couple and one guy.

After I ordered...I swear...the club rush followed me in...the line was almost out the door...which means the 4 guys running the restaurant were getting slammed and hadn't had an opportunity to clean up during a break.

So, I'll look past it especially at that time of morning with drunk folks dropping food etc.

Excellent food!!

I had the $4.45 cheese quesdilla w rice and beans.",QOg1dKpQklyjWzel1LeNgQ,1,1,5,_39UUM7awYmMk5wfHvMYXg

So far, this is the only Roberto's that I really enjoy eating at because of its cleanliness. The staff is really friendly and pretty quick at preparing your food :) 

Some of my favorite things to order is the carne asada enchilada or the burrito! Mmm! It makes me hungry just thinking about it! Also, to the left of the cash register there is a sauce bar where your fave hot sauces are located along with to-go cups and various veggies.

However, there are some things on the Roberto's menu that are just too small or too untasteful to be sold! So, be careful when ordering! Otherwise, enjoy a nice enchilada at this fun & clean location :)",OoyQYSeYNyRVOmdO3tsxYA,1,3,4,08pAgvaSNp52DVQwFtwIQQ

Their food is good until you're a few bites in and realize they don't use seasoning on anything.
