It's our first visit, they were gracious in explaining the various entrees, and explaining how fresh everything is. 

Our cashier JOSE was so friendly,  he followed up with us several times.   Asked how we were enjoying our meal and explained how he makes the chips fresh every mourning at 7 am.   He had such joy and passion in his voice about the quality of his work.   It's refreshing to see employees really enjoy the work they do .

The establishment is clean and inviting.

We will be back!",rLBfefw-aSoXVjQAAS3IyQ,0,0,5,xM2mIwtp7P9z0E3SzN5thA

Although the last time I had a coworker pickup my order of Chile roast beef salad,  and there was no salad in it wth. It was kinda like a  burrito bowl instead and I was charged for the salad bowl. My Co worker even ask if this was a salad since it did not look right. They confirmed that it was a salad.  So I don't know who made my salad last time. But salads have green leaves in it lol.",SWBIqGS1OMCW92202_EhOQ,0,0,4,YU3_gj6tUahcdV79qcTd_w
1241426,2017-06-27,3,Za7NNCyOPnwem4xATpKSbg,"Cafe Rio also does such a great job creating fresh tortillas and great tasting meats for their burritos. My go to burrito is their sweet pork, enchilada style. The sweet pork is flavorful with a lot of sauce they gives it the right amount of tang. Make sure you do yourself a favor and get all your burritos enchilada style; their burritos are already good on their own, but the extra sauce and cheese makes it that much better. 

This new location is great. It gives another quick food option in the area. Especially good for the dental students and staff at UNLV and at UMC.",FQbVI3UyKlL-HfQGcRF8aA,3,3,3,upZsQ_RGc9viabVc38Snxw
1388014,2018-01-06,0,Za7NNCyOPnwem4xATpKSbg,"I normally like this chain and come here semi frequently. This is the first time I was at this location and I was very disappointed. First with a gluten allergy I wanted the enchiladas with corn tortillas but they we're out of the corn tortillas.

Prior to my ordering the server brought out some fresh rice to the steam table. When she took out the old tray from the steam table she put it on top of the fresh flour tortillas not realizing that she got it all wet from the bottom of the pan that came out of the steam table thereby contaminating the tortillas. I mentioned something but they didn't care or didn't notice and just left it there for the next person.",4CR7rQLHuXZpfLzDvqlaIA,1,0,2,gvnxrPHyYaiiyPch-QZ5Xw
1406482,2018-03-23,0,Za7NNCyOPnwem4xATpKSbg,I don't know if it's all locations but the West Sahara location has an issue with their phones. It's been an issue for months. I tried calling the number that is listed and it first went to an automatic Cafe Rio message then went silent...then I tried to call again at least five times and it went to a Sprint error message. I proceeded to order online but the soonest the order could even be recognized by the system was 45 minutes later. If I could have just talked to someone that would have saved us so much time. Such a waste of time. We've always loved Cafe Rio but this system is a total pain. Sorry but you're losing customers because of this.,5HbriBX7NH-b0RmbWF0X2Q,0,0,2,0gvLzE4wQFy5tiCWuHy5KQ
1510206,2018-01-11,0,Za7NNCyOPnwem4xATpKSbg,I loved the Cafe Rio in Henderson so I was taken back that this locations quality and taste was so different from my experience at the other location. The restaurant is very clean looking but in my opinion the workers don't move very quickly.  I haven't witnessed the best food safety practices either and that's probably why I ended up with a stomach illness from eating here with someone else. We both ended up very sick and it had to be from either the lettuce or the sour cream. I won't go back.,LtD8mYSgijVsOcQU6Ojr9A,0,0,1,LYme9G-lH2C_Y32XKJFyhQ

I frequent cafe rio often and have it delivered to my job once a week & I've never had a problem with any other location before. They left out pico & lettuce & I was just left with a big glob of tortilla and black beans.

2340629,2018-02-13,0,Za7NNCyOPnwem4xATpKSbg,"A few friends and I put in an order online. I am allergic to cilantro so we called this location ahead of time to see what does and doesn't include cilantro. My friend made it very clear that I have a cilantro allergy and we were told that it was a ""side"" item and is only included if we asked for it. We specifically asked about both the rice and the pico (which are both made with cilantro), and were assured that neither included it. We went ahead and placed our order and under my order I put in all caps NO CILANTRO just in case. 

One of my friends left right away and drove 20 minutes to pick up the food and not only did they not have the Mexican Coke that they had on the website to order, guess what was smothered all over my food! Lots of pico with lots of cilantro! And the rice actually does not come without cilantro (like at Chipotle, where you can choose to have rice with or without the lime cilantro), like we were promised.

My friend called back and mentioned the first phone call about the cilantro content in the food, and asked what could be done about it. No offer of a refund, partial or otherwise, and they re-did the order. Friend makes the 20 minute drive back to the location and brings back my food. Mixed into the lettuce is MORE CILANTRO. 

Not only could they not follow directions (twice), the food was not fresh, no Mexican Coke even though it was available to order on the site (Note: the Mexican Coke was priced $2.29, and the 20 oz fountain cups we got in place of them were supposedly the same price), the nachos and quesadilla were super soggy, the guac was black, and my friend had to remind them to give him his change.

It's in a tight plaza, so plan ahead on parking. It might be wiser to park farther away and walk.

There seemed to be about 4 people waiting at the end for to go orders crowded around the register.  I'll also add that I was not impressed with the cardboard sign stating ""sorry, out of knives.""

3741085,2018-03-30,0,Za7NNCyOPnwem4xATpKSbg,"This place is ok... been here a few times because all the other coworkers agreed to come here.
Food is pretty ok. The sweet pork is the best meat available. Downside is the tacos and burritos made with this or any meat have way too much liquid coming out, causing a mess and unwanted soggyness. But ingredients are fresh! The guacamole portion is way too small... which then takes me into the service. Ordering here is a little confusing and counter productive from the few times I been here and from what other people have said. It's a very slow moving line and they move your plate along so fast when you need to change or add they have to bring it back interrupting the other order they are working on.

I usually order two tacos al a cart and the meat the put in your taco is equivalent to 1 tablespoon. While I walk through watching the employees put my food together I see they do not care about missing other veggies as they grab or drop them when compiling a dish. The kids who work here are extremely rude and impatient. Yesterday I ordered my food at 11:15 and was promised my food would be ready by 12:15. I arrived at 12 to ask what the status was and my food was still not ready. I did receive my receipt however I did not get my food until 12:45!!!!!

4795787,2017-08-13,0,Za7NNCyOPnwem4xATpKSbg,I used the online ordering which I absolutely love. I ordered my regular chicken salad with a side of queso and chips. I walked in and picked my food up without problem. When I got home and sat down to eat I realized I had a bag of chip crumbs. I had about 10 whole chips and the rest of the bag was filled with inch size pieces. This made enjoying my queso very difficult. Moving on the the salad. The salad itself was flavorful but the tortilla it sat on was no where near being cooked. I don't know if they make their own tortillas or not but mine was extremely doughy and tasted like oil.

The menu is pretty clear and up front. Pictures are the best! We noticed that they have someone making the tortilla fresh. That definitely deserves a star. The guy who helped us was nice and helpful. He recommended the habanero sauce on the enchiladas. It was delicious! Not as spicy as I thought it would be but the flavor is great. I got the shredded chicken and cheese. It wasn't too dry and the sauce just made it better. You have a choice of pinto or black beans and sour cream is extra. We also ordered a side of chips, guacamole and salsa. The salsa was more spicier then the habanero sauce lol but it was good. Chips are served warm. Wasn't too big of a fan of their horchata. Tasted like just regular milk with some cinnamon. So creamy and it didn't satisfy my taste buds. Good selection on side sauces. I'm pretty excited to try the tacos next time. This place is like a chipotle but on another level.
