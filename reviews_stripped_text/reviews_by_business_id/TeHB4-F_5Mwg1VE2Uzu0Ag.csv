Dave Gordon called me and emailed within the next few days to apologize about my experience.  I had explained to him about the post and that this actually occurred almost a year ago. He said regardless it was still an experience I had and he wanted to make it right and he did! I really appreciate that. I really respect a manager who truly cares about his customers. I would definitely return do to the fact that they care about their customer satisfaction. He asked me to give him a call the next time I go back so he can make sure our next experience is an amazing one. I will definitely take him up on that!",fEslPNyGxI8disaH5C2sQQ,0,0,4,U8AHPdOv5ainQ0ZE37IrXw

I figured since this place was stashed in Excalibur that it would be just as tacky and gross as the hotel. But my expectations were pleasantly contradicted.  We had the chicken parmesan, spaghetti with meat sauce and salad. We devoured every bit of it.  Along with excellent serve, this meal was perfection

Not really notable either. I would say that the atmosphere here is the draw. They do have a great happy hour and it is conveniently located in our hotel. They need to work on their service, however. Our group of 11 was told to check back in 30 minutes to be seated; which we did. When we returned we were made to feel as though it was a strain to ""fit"" us in. We were ignored, waited another 15 minutes to be seated although the table was ready. When we were, our waiter hardly ever came to check on us. I'm not sure if he felt overwhelmed by our group or what, he looked over at us frequently but never actually came to refill drinks. I had to go find the hostess to send someone over. We always tip %20 and probably would have more if we had been better taken care of. 

In short, the food is generic and somewhat over priced. $5 wines are pretty awesome, the atmosphere is nice but the service stinks.",78cP_qjdRoR-fO_Dw3-AfA,0,0,3,Ti1yyfvtjg3fhq-34c1YfA
161578,2015-03-31,1,TeHB4-F_5Mwg1VE2Uzu0Ag,"POOP ALERT!!  BEWARE!!! So my hubby and were having our house fumigated for termites so we thought, ""Let's go to Vegas for a short vacation.""  We were having a great time at the Mandalay and shopping at the outlet.  On Fri March 27 2015 we decided to have a late dinner at Bucca since were familiar with the great food at the location at Universal City.  There was a wait at the location at Excalibur as there is at the one we normally go to.  We didn't mind.  The service was great.  We had the green salad and garlic bread, delicious.  Then came the lasagna.  It was good but then something happened.  We both felt bloated very quickly.  We had a lot left over so we decided to take it with us. Both my husband and I had a horrible night with stomach cramps and nausea.  In the middle of the night I ran to the bathroom to vomit but didn't make it to the toilet and ended hurling in one of the sinks. I tried to hold it back with my hands but my body rejected the obvious bacteria that permeated all of the layers of the lasagna.  Moments later my husband started vomiting also.  So all night we took turns vomiting violently.  There was a beautiful couple across from us that were also having lasagna.  I just hope they weren't on their honey moon. Day three,  my wonderful husband and I are back home and still recuperating, our backs and rib cages sore from the force of the vomiting.  I'd also like to mention that my husband and I don't drink alcohol. So the vomiting can't be attributed to being intoxicated. I'm writing this review because a child or elderly person could suffer serious results from food poisoning.  We will never go to a Bucca di Beppo again.  Too bad because we often celebrated birthdays and other social events at the Universal location.  We just aren't willing to take the chance and besides, Italian food doesn't sound that appealing any more.",1NdBl4Gje5smMVi7QnOPVA,3,2,1,xO34-jbqoEN72MoISmTqTQ

As with all Buca's their meals are meant to be shared even the small portions, so that's nice. Their spaghetti and meat balls are not my favorite but I was told by others in my group that for them it was, so I guess it a taste thing. Their salads are good and crispy not soggy and bland like in other restaurants. Had their Prosciutto Stuffed Chicken... delicious, the sauce was on point and the chicken tender and juicy, and the prosciutto (bacon) was crispy but not hard. Also tried the Chicken Saltimbocca... the sauce was different with a tangy kick from the lemon and matched the way the chicken was cooked but it was not my favorite, a little to tangy and lemony for my taste. Their drinks are reasonably priced and they have a good selection of wine. Our waiter was nice and attentive, he definitely earned his tip. Lost one star because you could smell the smoke from the casino and that may have been why I didn't enjoy the food like at a regular Buca.",ilJqVA6jPlodDd69IbgA8g,0,0,4,sPRahYG_r30FaUff2kPkZA

The olive oil also seemed very bland and cheap.  This place is family style.

Also, the portion was really good for 1 person.  My wife and I both agree on this.  Afterwards, we were both still hungry.  So, for the price, I don't think it was good.  For that price for Baked Ziti, I was expecting a large amount of pasta.  I've been served bigger portion sizes in the $10 range and this was like $20+ or something.

So i decided to give Bucca another shot here in Fullerton, California. Here's what i liked and disliked.

Liked:
* The service was 10x more better here, with more customer interaction and little jokes here and there.
* The environment was a little more Family Oriented which I really like. 
* So much more friendlier staff that aren't looking like they hate their jobs. 
* Way better pasta, the one I got in Vegas was a bit bland. 
* The food proportion are HUGE, which i like, if I'm paying 22$ for a ""Small"" it better be good.

Disliked: 
* Everything came out really slow like, I was waiting a bit just to get a water refill.
* Some of these foods need a little more flavor, for example , I order the mozzarella garlic bread, it was good when i bit into it, but when i dipped it in my pasta sauce it was 100x more better, things like bread need a bit of sauce on the side to enhance the flavor.

Over all it was a hell of a lot better experience I had in Nevada, Hopefully this review helps and lets this business learn from its mistakes and strives to make this restaurant a better place for all if its customers, Remember Bucca ""Customer Is The Number 1 Priority!""",JwJb0LV6TKPvJvJNktQ6Tw,0,0,4,HcAtwXTE7leuWGScSYdQWw
700320,2014-12-04,0,TeHB4-F_5Mwg1VE2Uzu0Ag,"I love Italian food. It's one of my favorites! I've never gone here before, and I've heard that they have big portions and the food is really good. My friend and I were in the area the other day because we had a show to watch. She wanted pasta, and Olive Garden was too far. We went to Buca di Beppo, and the prices were expensive! It did say that the small portions would serve 2 or more people, so we shared a dish. We had chicken cannolini- a stuffed dish with chicken and cheese and spinach. 

They did come with bread and butter. Our bread was cold. It would have tasted much better if our bread was piping hot. Since I was starving, I stuffed myself with bread. When our stuffed pasta came out, there was only 4 pieces. I was kind of shocked because they said portions are large. I had 2 pieces and my friend had 2 as well. I was still hungry after eating. I don't eat much either. It was $24, which was definitely not worth it. Some of the other dishes might have bigger portions, but when you purchase meat, you get way less food?

My husband and I chose Buca because Italian is my favorite cuisine, we loved the food when we visited on our last trip and I enjoy the family-style serving of the dishes. (I also love the Excalibur!) The set-up was absolutely great!! We had 35-40 people attend our destination wedding and were given the Wine Room. It is a private area right off the main entrance from the casino, through double glass doors. We had the room reserved for our party for three hours and, months prior to our event, we sent a schedule of how we would like the evening to flow to the event coordinator. The dishes came out right on time, were exactly what we ordered from the catering menu and with more than enough to feed an army! Our adult beverages were never empty, in fact, we had a fresh one waiting for us before we even finished the previous one. Every request was promptly fulfilled by a smiling face. EVERYTHING was absolutely flawless! The servers were so attentive and personable to everyone in our party. Our guests raved about the experience, service, food and employees. I would absolutely, 100% recommend this Buca di Beppo location to anyone hosting an event in Las Vegas! The food is just wonderful and the hospitality is unmatched!

Ordered the lasagna and veal marsala. Don't be misled by the portion sizes. They claim a small can feed 2 people...well it doesn't even come close. I probably could have eaten two of their small lasagnas by myself. As for the small veal marsala, it comes on one normal sized plate with mushrooms and sauce smothered on top. Without any noodles, I can't even imagine how they would expect this dish to serve two people. 

The bread is quite fresh and tasty. My lasagna was slightly overcooked. I like my noodles to be slightly firm with some bite to it, like any good pasta. Instead my lasagna noodles were flabby and dissolved in my mouth. However, like I said, it was only slightly overcooked.

If you are in a smaller group and you all don't agree on a dish and you get a something only you will eat you will most likely spend between $20-$35 per dish now if you are if a larger group that's great!

Please be aware that the entrees are served family style, I can eat a lot, when I ordered for me and my companion the 'small' size entree's were PLENTY of food to eat.

We tried the 'Small' size calamari for the appetizer, it was very good and perfectly crunchy, for our main entree we had the 'Small' size chicken carbonara.  The food was very good and flavorful, for two of us we didn't finish it and had to take our leftovers with us.

The drinks were good, we had a glass of wine and draft beer with the meal, they do have Happy hour specials here as well.

The only complaint I had was with the 'Small' size of garlic bread we had on the side, the bread was too hard and not very buttery and could barely taste the garlic.  The portion size for the 'small' was huge though, so if you do order the garlic bread, the 'small' size is 16 mid size pieces which was over the top in my opinion for two people.

Overall, the food was good, nice ambiance, and our server was very helpful.  My recommendation for dinner for two, 1 small appetizer and entree should do the trick.  I will definitely try this place again.",GCzwuzrjXaLN0xg-K0K18g,1,0,3,hjU4PWBt-jxV29A8MifKlQ

We called the restaurant and they merely said ""we'll look into it"" and never called us back as they promised. The school nurses got involved, which brought the health district involved. They realized we have contracted norovirus. How can they take this so lightly?! I'm surprised they haven't called back many of the students who called them to report the food poisoning, begging them to take a free gift card or something.

2408615,2012-08-16,0,TeHB4-F_5Mwg1VE2Uzu0Ag,"For the price and portion.. I was expecting better.
Yes, it's family style.. They went on and on about it, the portion was decent, but I wouldn't say it was that big. I've seen a fair amount of places with portions that big for less than that price. Granted I'm from Wisconsin and I went there on an empty stomach, I was going all out. So yeah, Buca calls it family style, I call it one hungry Wisconsinite portion with 1/3 to take home. 
Anyway, noodles are quite inexpensive so the dish better taste pretty damn good to be worth the price, and to me.. It was lacking. That extra money is basically going to the atmosphere and experience. ( which my friend said that the Buca on Flamingo is much cozier)
My friend and I ordered 2 appetizers ( with a coupon through Buca's website) We had the antipasto salad, and  mozzarella garlic bread. I enjoyed the salad, and the bread was decent, but it took at least 20-25 minutes for it to come out. The waiter wasn't the greatest either, and he looked busy, but I really felt like we were put on the back burner compared to his other tables. People that were seated after us were receiving their appetizers before we did, one family even had their pizza come out while we STIll waited for our appetizers! 
I ordered the ravioli al pomodoro, and trust me, it wasn't worth 25 dollars. To me it tasted quite basic, and the sauce tasted like it came out of a Ragu jar. I have to say that my friend enjoyed the sauce, but it looked watered down and tasted pretty basic.
My friend ordered the penne arrabbiata, that was okay, I liked it more than what I ordered, but still nothing to write home about.
When the bill came out, the waiter had forgotten that we had mentioned earlier that we had a coupon, we had showed it to him earlier but he needed to see it again for the code, but because it was through my friends phone, it only allowed him to open it once and it couldn't be used again. Our waiter said, ""sorry"" but there was nothing he could do. I think he really didn't care, and was sick of dealing with us, he wanted us out of there ASAP. He had mentioned earlier that today was his last night before his vacation so... Hmm. I understand that the coupon issue wasn't the waiters fault, but I've worked at restaurants before where you try your best to please the customer, he made no attempt to offer up the manager or try to help. It wasn't like we were lying since we showed the coupon to him earlier.
I know it's a chain, and I really noticed it in the food, perhaps I'm picky, but I prefer a smaller, non-chain, authentic Italian restaurant, where you might get a slightly smaller portion size, but the food is cooked with thought and doesn't taste like it came out of a bag, jar, or can.
Needless to say.. Not going back there again.",q_CXp9zoD7dCBiXxVQqEvw,0,0,2,muSK5VGHqc7wn4vfdxayig

We were pretty loud (mostly me), but our waiter was super awesome in working with us and recommending stuff. He was super nice and took great care of us. 

Service was a little slow, which is understandable with a group of our size. 

Here's what I shared with three other people:

Artichoke Florentine Dip- super yummy with crunchy little bread slices, plenty for 4
Baked Ziti (Large)- loved the ricotta, PLENTY for 4, enough for 5 regular people without monster-appetites 

Turns out to be pretty affordable if you come in a group and you don't mind all eating the same thing.

I also had a few drinks, so don't judge me. Be happy I can offer so much review! 

Also, the drink menu isn't online (except for the wine, which doesn't help me), so the names are what I can remember, which isn't correlated with the fact that I had about 4 drinks...

Cheap Red (just ask for their cheap red), 9 oz.- good about for 2-3 people to share
Blended (something) Margarita- pretty delicious
Red Sangria- sweet and yummy! Comes with an orange slice and cherry

I have added a star to my previous review. As soon as I emailed corporate about my experience in detail, I was contacted immediately by the divisional Vice President who apologized sincerely and directly dealt with management and staff at the location. A more favorable outcome was offered and in return I wanted to update my review. The situation was now handled correctly by management which I sincerely appreciate since I have many years in the service industry as well. It's basic customer service.

10/30/2017:
Visited tonight for my girlfriends birthday dinner and brought friends and her mom that I flew in from L.A just for dinner. Thought this location had the best reviews of all the locations in the valley.

Absolutely terrible management. Our group was originally large so we confirmed the Popes Room. Upon arrival the group number shrunk but we were still told we would have the room. The host told us otherwise and she checked with the manager. She never told us we did not have the room but we were led to a regular table. Bad communication and bad management! 

Our waiter took a good 5-10 minutes to first visit the table and tell us he would be with us shortly. Another 10 goes by and he stopped to take drink orders which took another 10 just for waters and soda. Another 5 for the sangria. He rarely stopped by except to finally drop off food.

He dropped off the check and told us he would get boxes for the leftovers and never returned. I pulled the manager over and told him all of the disappointments. He gave us a ""discount"" maybe taking a little tax off.

DO NOT VISIT THIS LOCATION. WE ALL COMMENTED HOW SHITTY THE MANAGEMENT AND SERVICE WAS AND TIPPED AS SUCH.

Disappointing experience and even more disappointing birthday dinner.",kDJB55VTl7pxtqaosPdpyw,1,1,2,d0CMwfQB-A7ajxqlO44wjQ

I'd recommend coming for lunch specials if you are eating by yourself. Those prices vary from 13$-18$ depending on the entree. I got the spicy chicken rigatoni. 13.49$. Wasn't too spicy but if you can't handle spicy then i would just either make it not spicy or pick another entree. Rigatoni was cooked nicely but the serving size of the chicken was under my expectations. Chicken was also soft too, as it seems like the chicken was cooked with the sauce on a simmer. I personally like chicken when it's pan fried to give it a crispier texture but it wasn't bad. 
TL;DR: Would recommend but wouldn't go out of my way to eat here. Come for lunch specials if you're solo.

 We arrived at the restaurant after 3pm for a late lunch. Although the restaurant was almost completely empty, when we asked for a table, we were told to sit on the bench outside and that we would have to wait a few minutes. We saw the hostess constantly running around looking like she was very busy and talking on the phone. Keep in mind that the restaurant was empty, so I am not sure what she was running around doing. We asked for our table again, but we were once again told to wait. After almost 15 minutes of waiting, we decided to leave. During this time, two other couples were also told to wait, and they also left. To add insult to the injury, she had a horrible attitude - she was quite rude and dismissive, acting like we were doing something horrible by making her get up and do her job. Definitely the worst service I have experienced in a long time (if not the worst service I have EVER experienced).

Honestly, the entire thing is a mystery to me, as I have always loved this restaurant, but I guess they need major re-training of their staff. If I could give it zero stars, I would, but I can't, so I'm giving it - grudgingly - 1 star.",BfDlTQHYOhN4yR9_egMyEA,0,0,1,wYgfuM8tz6G9Uy79G3VOnw

The pizza was thin crust and the pepperoni was quite tasty but the tomato sauce was a bit insipid.

Drinks are on permanent happy hour so we could get a Light Beer for just $3 a glass.

Our waiter got a bigger table and pretty much ignored us. He never brought us bread, he didn't even bring out our food. When the food did come out, the waiter almost dropped both of them until another waitress helped him and then slammed the plate down on top of my phone and wallet, with no apology, and walked away. We still hadn't gotten the refill and water we asked for at this point. Our original waiter decided to make an appearance and my boyfriend asked him to finally bring us our bread that we should have gotten 45 minutes earlier. We asked for the check and he forgot to apply the $10 discount for the coupon I had given him. Then when he came back to box up our leftovers, he dropped the entire plate on the table, shattering my wine glass and pasta flew all over the place. He was very apologetic, and then brought out our check again. After horrible service and shattering a wine glass and having pasta spill all over, he didn't even comp us the $2 side of Alfredo sauce my boyfriend asked for. Absolutely ridiculous.

UPDATE:

After reading this review, I was contacted by the manager and received THE BEST customer service ever. Craig was extremely apologetic and just an overall sweetheart. He offered to send us something in the mail for our next visit to Buca and we accepted. The next time we're in Vegas, we will be giving this Buca another shot, just because of how awesome Craig was.

The decor of the restaurant is a throwback to 1950s Italian-American kitsch with red and white checkered vinyl tablecloths on the table, Christmas lights on tacky fake marble statues, memorabilia of the popes everywhere and a photo of Mario Lanza hanging over the urinal. The food is definitely not delicate, featuring heavy breading and dried pasta that stuck together while boiling. I had the veal saltimbocca that was tasty but you couldn't distinguish that you were acting eating veal and Italian ham the breading was so heavy. My side dish of fettuccine Alfredo tasted more like over cooked box pasta with hot cream.

We asked for our table again, but we were once again told to wait. After almost 15 minutes of waiting, we decided to leave.

The table reserved was nice, and apart from the noise. So it was nice being able to hear everyone, and enjoy conversations without having to yell. Their birthday celebrations are cute, and different in a way. They sing, and bring out a big candle, along with a dessert for the birthday girl/boy. It was nice.

Only downfall was that when we were seated servers would walk past our table, watch us sit there, and not offer any drinks or service. After 10 minutes of waiting one of the girls in the party got up, and asked the host who our server was, and how we've been waiting for someone to take our drink order.

After a very long drive from San Diego, our big family decided to stop by Buca for a family style dinner. Their dishes are definitely meant to be shared so it is best to come here when you have a bunch of people tagging along with you. For their antipasti, the mozzarella garlic bread and fried calamari is a must! Make sure you ask for extra marinara sauce because you would want to dip your calamari in that tomato goodness. For the insalate, you will never go wrong with the Caesar salad. That bowl of greens is very refreshing! For pizza, order the spicy arrabbiata although I think it is a bit weak for my liking. If you name something ""spicy-whatever"" make sure that it is spicy enough. The large linguine fruitti di mare made up for the not-so-stellar spicy arrabiatta. Always a favorite, their fruitti di mare is a must for seafood lovers.

I would have given this restaurant a 4 but gave them a 3 instead because of the spicy arrabbiata. And even though the fruitti di mare was very good, at least 6 of the mussels were closed. I think that was poor preparation. Such a shame...",uUWnXMI9FAtMA3oUb3WYsg,2,0,3,uDFt-7-adjRbjtKpfp0L8Q

Lasagna is usually a winner at Italian restaurants, but this was disappointing. The sauce lacked depth and overall, it didn't have the indulgence usually part of the baked pasta experience. The garlic bread was also just mediocre.

We had a party of 6 and we ordered a large lasagna, a small shrimp florentine, small basket of garlic bread, a beer, and 3 soft drinks. My bill came out to be 100 bucks. The lasagna wasn't great. It lacked meat and it was overly salty. I wasn't impressed at all. And a large isn't so large. You would think that the large would be fairly a large portion when it says it feeds 4 or more people. Trust me, when you have a group of men, it will probably feeds 2-3 people. The lasagna was $40 dollars for a cheese lasagna with no meat. It says meat sauce, but it was just salty cheesy tomato sauce with not a single meat piece. Skip the lasagna, not worth it. The shrimp florentine was good and the garlic bread was delicious. Everything here is al a carte so the bread was $10! And the shrimp florentine was $30 for a small size. What kind of irks me here was that they charge for refills too. So when everyone got refills on their root beer and diet coke they charge $1.75 or something for each refill. So, it was 20 bucks roughly for 3 sodas and a Heineken. Wtf. Let me tell you guys, in Vegas there is not a single establishment that charges for refills on drinks. I feel like this place is a money eater and sends out overly salty food. When the waiter came to ask, would you like a refill on your drink, my party made the assumption that refills were free. I'm surprised they didn't charge me for my tap water and the cups and utensils I used. Jeez. My head was hurting from the massive intake on salt after that. I don't mind dropping a 100 bucks for food, if it was good. A bit disappointed with them.

I would recommend getting everything, but the penne basilica because they gave way more pasta than chicken or broccoli (there was only 2-3 pieces). The garlic bread is worth getting because they put a generous amount of garlic on their bread and you get a whole basket! The downside is that it does not come with your meal and you have to pay $9.99. The atmosphere is pretty lively and they play lots of oldy kinda music.

Their portions are HUGE and are meant for sharing between 2-4 people. The flavor of the food however, was mediocre.. I'd even say subpar. I was expecting the mozzarella caprese to be made with balsamic vinegar, but instead it was only drizzled with olive oil, so it tasted very plain. Also beware, if adding sun-dried tomatoes to your ""build your own"" entree, because there was an ABUNDANCE of them in our spaghetti.. I kept having to either spit them out of every bite I took, or fish them out on my plate. It was definitely overkill.

Of course the portions are served family style which feeds 3 or more people (so order accordingly! It's very easy to over order!). Our group ordered the stuffed chicken and the fettuccine supremo. This way more than enough for light eaters in a group of four. The stuffed chicken is AMAZING which I would suggest to any person who decides to come here. It has a great crunchy outer breading and inside the chicken is super tender and full of flavor in addition to the ham and the creamed filling. Super delish! The fettuccine supremo was also good. What you would expect of a typical pasta. The sauce was thick and creamy and filled with helpings of bell peppers and sausage.

They also offer happy hour which is $2 domestic, $3 imports, $5 glass of wine and specialty drinks at the bar only. Their house wine is ok. They offer a sample tasting of it, but honestly, it's a little boring and dry to me. I opted for their moscato instead which was light and sweet. Service was also ok.

Once seated our orders were taken quickly, my drink was delivered quickly and the waiter explained how big the portions were and took the time to give recommendations for us.

I am blown away. Yes it was busy,  but our server was SUPER attentive, he came by 7 times, checking on my drink, if the food was good, but not in a rushing or pushy way, he was just passing by and would check on us.

The food was fantastic! We had meatballs (the pasta was the only thing lacking, it was WAY over cooked, and watery in the bottom of the bowl) But the meatballs were AMAZING and then we also got chicken stuffed with cheese and prosciutto, we got potatoes as a side.

It is a large round table in a round sectioned off area with Pope and other Catholic pictures and memorabilia. There is a big lazy Susan in the middle with, guess what, a bust of a Pope! Its a fun place to sit.

We ordered the pizza which is thin crust and delicious as well as the apple salad, one of our favorites. We had a fettuccine Alfredo, a spaghetti and meatballs, macaroni and cheese & a spicy shrimp ziti. As we were guests, I did not participate in the ordering. My wife and our host did the ordering and they nailed it.

The service was great and they were constantly there with our drinks and removing dirty and unused dishes.

My husband, 2 kids and I came into this restaurant Monday about 2 pm to grab a little bite to eat. 
We didn't want much since we had tournament of the kings tickets for that night and I heard they serve a lot of food. 
I mean what's a better place to share a plate than Buca di Beppo right? Isn't that what their restaurant based on. 

We came and the restaurant had maybe 4 customers in there, we still had to wait 10 minutes for a table that was ok not really a problem. We were seated and the waiter came looked at my kids and his mood changed completely he was so rude!! My kids were seated nicely no peep out of them so that wasn't the problem he must have just not liked kids, anyway so we order our food and drinks he had an issue with our order because my husband and I wanted to split a lunch size plate and my kids split the spaghetti and meatballs (my son is 1 how much is he really going to eat) after that he was horrible! I mean I would have paid a split plate fee to avoid his horrible service. He brought out the bread and didn't offer oil and vinegar but he brought it and was very attentive to the table that was ordering a couple plates. The hostess had to serve our table because he wanted nothing to do with us (I'm thinking because of the tip size with a lower bill) I'm actually a really good tipper being a former server so I wouldn't tip based on the bill anyway. 

He never checked on us again. 

My daughter ordered the Pisa punch with the light up cup and she had to yell EXCUSE ME!!! To get the guys attention when she asked for a refill he said we had to pay for a refill I told him that was okay go ahead and get her more he took her cup and brought her another but charged me for 2 cups with punch not just the refill  that's fine but since I paid for the cup can I have it lol!

The salad was okay, the pizza was very salty and flat, the chicken was average, there was not much garlic taste to the mashed potatoes and the water was chlorinated with not even a lemon wedge to mask the taste.

Their ""family-style"" philosophy forces you into sharing entrees rather than ordering your own meal. You see, the small portions are supposed to be shared. So I guess people who are dining alone are not welcome.

First, you have to set expectations before eating here and writing a review - it is a family style restaurant that caters to large groups.   This is not a James Beard Award Winning restaurant, but it is a fun place for groups to grab a meal together.

I called in to make a reservation for 8 people at 7:00 p.m. and Miss Hostess was the nicest person I've encountered in a long time!  Easy Peasy!  When we got to the restaurant, we were greeted by three lovely hostesses.  We were told to wait 5 minutes for them to set up our table (HUH?  The restaurant was half empty!).  After being seated, we were quickly greeted and served by lovely Miss Server Shennae!

For starters, we got the Apple Gorgonzola Salad (Small for 4).  The salad was your typical green salad but was loaded with gorgonzola cheese, thinly sliced Granny Apples, walnuts and cranberries.  It was light, fresh, and tasty!   Grade:  B

For the main dish, we got the Frutti di Mare Pasta (Small for 4).  The pasta was topped with mussels, clams, shrimp, and calamari.   The pasa noodles were tossed with a rich and spicy marinara sauce.  I loved the taste of this dish.  I didn't like the texture of the noodles.  It tasted like either the noodles were over cooked or were a cheap brand of noodles.  The texture was mushy and did not have a chew to it like most noodles should have.    Grade:  B-

The kiddos at the table ordered from the kid's menu ($5!).  Each had a personalized sized cheese pizza or spaghetti and meatballs.  Both selections were VERY generous and large!  The pizzas were 9"" across.  The spaghetti and meatballs was served in a medium sized pasta bowl and looked like it was enough for 2 adults.   (It looked so tasty, I wanted to eat the leftovers of the kids, but I refrained!).   Grade:  A!

Best part of the meal was the energy and smiles of Miss Server Shennae!  She was patient and really made it an enjoyable evening!  You can tell she loves her job!  Thanks a bunch, Shennae!

Food Grade:  B
Service Grade:  A!
Worth the Money Grade:  B-  (sorry, the bad pasta noodles and prices did this)

Well, the server ended up being pretty nice, though. He took our order in a timely manner, and he refilled our drinks when needed.

It was loaded with pepperoni just like I love. It could have been a little more done but that is my fault for not asking. The pasta tasted as it was supposed to but it was luke warm. I could have sent it back but it took so long to get it I didn't want to wait. My wife had a craving for garlic bread so we just ordered it without checking the price. It came as chunks of break with very little butter or garlic flavor. We thought ""oh well"" until we got the check and it was $11 for a basket. That was very disappointing.

My parents and I came here a late Mother's Day lunch and ordered a small chicken carbonara, small calamari as well as the garlic pepper broccoli. Our waiter had great sales talk about items on the menu, however, at some point, he started to feel a little pushy. When we weren't even done with our dishes, he came up and asked if we wanted a box for our carbonara of if we wanted it taken away already, when there were still some calamari left on the plate, he took it away without asking...and my parents and I were left staring at each other in uncomfortable silence as he walked away. 

Other than that, the food was awesome. Carbonara filled us up to the brim, we didn't have room for dessert although that tiramisu sample our waiter showed us looked prettttyyyyy tasty. I also highly appreciate the photo service with complimentary postcards per table - with optional bigger photos for about $5 if I remember well.

He played with the screen for a bit and acted like he checked me in, apparently lying right to my face: I got an e-mail from OpenTable two hours later indicating that I never showed for my reservation. Not only does this mean I did not earn any points for dining at Buca di Beppo, but it also puts a red mark on my OpenTable account for allegedly not making it to a reservation.

I've raised the matter with OpenTable, but know that right out of the gate that the employees at this location would are more interested in being dishonest about something that probably costs them a 50 cent commission than actually serving up a halfway-decent dining experience. No wonder they're broke and give out coupons like they're going out of style.",rhtps55mnfi2TP6bxn0tIA,0,0,3,BbJclWtsyu7hfvkv2W7QUA
4655489,2016-03-13,7,TeHB4-F_5Mwg1VE2Uzu0Ag,"At the southwest corner of Las Vegas Boulevard and Tropicana Avenue stands a colossal castle called the Excalibur. Inside the castle there is an Italian restaurant that serves portions of food fit for a king. 

   It was Christmas Day when I toured the Christmas decorated hotels and public areas of the Strip from Mandalay Bay to Fashion Show. As I was walking through the Excalibur, I spotted Buca di Beppo Italian Restaurant. The red colors caught my eye. I decided to look at the menu. The hostess let fall that if you are dining alone that you can have the lunch special all day long. A few hours later, I would return to the Castle to enjoy food portions that would make me feel like a king. 

   This Buca di Beppo is one of several in a chain of Italian restaurants that are owned by Planet Hollywood. Currently there are around 95 of them. Buca di Beppo has risen to fame with their outrageous portions of delicious Italian food that are called a la carte or family style. These portions are meant to be shared. But what if you love Italian food and are on a solo dining adventure? Buca di Beppo serves individual size entrees that are the lunch special. In the case of the solo diner, the lunch special could be ordered at 5 pm or 9 pm. 

   Obviously a restaurant serving king sized portions of tasty Italian food is sure to attract a lot of diners. The upshot is there was a short wait. Time went fast while waiting on a bench overlooking the menazene level of the castle. Ironically Buca di Beppo means Joe's basement in Italian. A few minutes later, they called my name. 

    Buca di Beppo does a nice job with the decor. Despite the fact that this is a chain, , it felt like I was dining in a family-owned Italian restaurant. 

   I walked in here decided on ordering eggplant parmigiano with spaghetti (lunch price $12.99) and a Pepsi ($3.29). As expected the portion was humongous. Who needs a buffet with portions this big. The left side of the plate held eggplant parmigiano topped with marinara sauce, Roma tomatoes, fresh basil, and mozzarella cheese. The right side held spaghetti with marinara sauce. I exchanged over $17 with Buca di Beppo for a meal that was both quantity and quality. After finishing all this food, I walked out of the castle feeling like the king.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,13,10,4,2i71l-pv2Khg7xwjY1gb_w

It's a very loud place and I felt was too busy for me to even pay attention to one thing. There was too much going on that day. There was wedding parties, big families, birthdays, and so on. 
I was on a date and felt that it was way too loud and crazy for a nice ""getting to know each other"" type of date. So, I'd avoid this place if that's what you're going for. 

The ambiance was everywhere. Reminded me of an Italian version of TGIF. Yanno, random things on the wall and every waiter and waitress running around everywhere. Also, singing the happy birthday song to every table.

As for the food.... the waitress suggested we should order carefully as the food are all family style large portions. There's 2 girls on a date with one another, we weren't going to eat that much. I'm not a fan that they were all large portions though. I wanted to try other things on the menu, but I wasn't going to order it if they're all family portions. SO, we ordered the lasagna and some garlic bread. 

It was a HUGE portion! There was a lot of garlic bread too! The food tasted a little bland for my liking. I felt the sauce wasn't giving me anything. I had to put a lot of parmesan on it to taste anything. The garlic bread wasn't too bad though. I liked it. At the end, we both didn't even finish our food. We took it to go. All in all, the experience was only well worth it because the waitress was very kind and always checked on us. Food wise, eh. So-so.",GLFFf8XbOoRJuxZxGfUd8g,6,4,2,9rJKToMcZ62vVSCWw0VsmQ

We called a month and advance and asked if they would put their cream lemon cake on hold for us because that would be our wedding cake. we told them the quantity how many we needed and asked for them to put a note on our reservation. First off, when we called to put on this request the woman on the phone was extremely rude and told us ""we have big parties all the time we'll have enough cake"".

Now that's fast forward to the wedding day. We get there and have a party of 20 people. Our bill was over $1000 and we only had one server. Overall the service throughout the dinner was poor and slow and the waiter was extremely rude. When you would request something he would say ""I don't have time for that right now I'll get it when I do"". To me that's unacceptable and poor management, if you see you have a party of 20 people assigned more waiters. Then now let's get to the cake. We ordered the cake, the same amount we told The lady on the phone a month ago, and we were told they didn't even have half the amount of pieces that we wanted. We spoke to the manager and he told us that there was no note on our reservation and that pretty much there's nothing he can do. We expressed to him that this is a huge disappointment because this is a wedding cake and he just shrugged his shoulders like he didn't care. No compensation for the poor planning on their end or the upset on our end. After about 15 minutes of us deciding what we should do, he came back and said he ""found cakes in the back but they have been in the freezer"". If you've ever had this cake you'd know it tastes best at room temperature. I'm glad he ended up finding it but considering it wasn't at serving quality and not as good as it would have been if they had been set aside like we asked them to, we were still disappointed. And then we were still charged for the cake!!! 


Overall horrible management and organization. When you mess up on a wedding parties order, at least have some empathy with the party. The wedding cake is a big deal and now all we will remember is horrible service we had when we think back on this day and reception.

He lied and said there were three kinds of garlic bread, but did not explain why he got us a cheesy one when we told him we did not want cheese. I then pointed out what he said to the table next to us. He could not explain lying to us. He acted and looked very unprofessional. Don't trust a man with a giant hole in his ear and knuckle tattoos.

The ""small"" portion was huge as it's family style but I made my best effort to finish what I could because it was amazing. 
My pesto sauce was fresh, flavorful and just delicious. My son ravaged his rigatoni and my daughter and husband devoured a pizza with the thickest layer of fresh cheese you have ever seen.

I will be craving their food until we get a chance to return again.

We ordered a small family style baked ziti, a small family style stuffed chicken,and a small family style bread. Our server was really nice and attentive, but I wish he would of brought the food out to us as well. There was a different young man who brought us our food. This young man made it a point to  ""wish us luck"" for ordering such a large amount of food. It was embarrassing and put a damper on the meal. My husband and I really enjoy the food here, but we feel that management should encourage their staff not to patronize customers, but to encourage customers to enjoy their selections. It's common to indulge when on vacation, and I doubt the Buca corporation would be happy hear that employees are discouraging vacationers for indulging on their wonderful entrees.

5441081,2013-09-09,0,TeHB4-F_5Mwg1VE2Uzu0Ag,"Great looking place with big prices, big portions and mediocre food. The meat dishes (that are in the range of $21 - $40 a plate) don't come with a side. If you want a side, then that's an extra $7-$9. Even something such as the Italian broccoli is $9. Here's a tip for anyone who goes here, the small portions are huge and the large portions are even huger. Order the small portions and share your food with others. Order a meat dish and then order a pasta dish, ask for extra plates and just create your own meat with a side of pasta dish.

For appetizers, we ordered the calamari ($13). They were so tiny. Tiny little itty bitty rings and teeny tiny little clusters of tentacles. I've had bigger and better calamari, and for far less. Then for our entrees, we ordered the Linguini Frutti Di Mare (a seafood linguini in wine sauce) and the Prosciutto Stuffed Chicken. My husband and I shared them amongst each other. The seafood on the Linguini was good and abundant, however the pasta was terrible. For $23 a plate, I expected the Linguini to be fresh (there is a huge and obvious difference) It wasn't, it was obviously a dried pasta that was overcooked, whereas it had a slimy consistency. I've had fresh pastas at Italian restaurants in Chicago, Philly, and New York that weren't even close to these outrageous prices. One that comes to mind is La Luce in Chicago (one of my favorites). They serve fresh homemade pasta, and the prices range from $14-$17 for huge portions. 

As for the chicken, it was ok. The chicken was cooked perfectly and was wonderfully juicy. However, the breading on top was a little burnt, creating a bitter flavor. That was really disappointing. Again, for $23 I expected more. 

The service was great though. That is until we paid for our dinner. After that our waiter could have cared less. He shoved a large portion of linguini into a tiny plastic container, then wrapped it in a plastic bag with my husbands leftovers. When I went to grab the bag, the bag broke, fell on the ground and my linguini spilled everywhere within the bag. Our waiter just walked by a few times without saying a word. He didn't even offer to help get us a second container and bag. We finally stopped him to ask for them. He fetched one for us, and still completely dismissed what had happened. The sad part is, it was only us and another small party, so being too busy to help wasn't really an issue. He just flat out didn't care. It was so obvious and really awkward. 

All in all, the experience was not that great. My wallet is very sad and so is my palate. Bucca should either serve better food or lower their prices.",ErtKNkBDDXXynapuaZ4x7A,0,0,2,WwuubhYBMbgvlRGLUdcejg

Watching the kitchen, the expeditor grabbed a pair of tongs, took a piece of chicken dumped off the capers and put on a new plate which is when I got up to look closer and saw him do this with the rest of the chicken.

We didn't try the food (so please don't use this review as a basis for that), but we did stop in for one of the ""giant brownie sundaes"".

With the massive ""family style"" portions these guys serve, 3 is just too small of a party, unless you order carefully (and I'm not sure that's actually possible). We ordered a pepperoni pizza, which was a giant lake of grease and just wasn't very good, a salad that would have fed 5-6 people and was marginal at best, and something else that was forgettable. Tab was huge, service was glacial, the entire experience lousy. Definitely won't be back.",bzapbb28xMO0NE9oRK27gg,5,1,1,JiLMOhaqVnX4rLvSGabV8A

The bread was good but came with packaged butter. The tiramisu was the biggest let down. It tasted like boxed freezer cake and left a bad taste in my mouth. The service was ok, we got the bread with our dinner but not prior so not something to munch on while your waiting for your food. I would again say it's not bad but not great.For the price of the food and the quality you can find in Vegas I would not recommend this restaurant nor will I be returning.",VO6vlq9gayNEXyNYJsnWOg,0,0,2,WszKo8wy683SJxa4WHRGPg

The guys at Buca let me use ALL deals, which lead me to a GREAT bill. Happy Birthday to me! hehe! Food was amazing as usual, since I love Buca in general. Also, our watier was a cool guy. 

This location has a cute setting. Also, it doesn't get too crowded. I guess I'm just so used to having Buca so crowded at the SF location,  also the most busiest & closest Buca to me.

I  would def recommend the Vegas location to go to. :)",Ve6Yq7F9Chf8N0JuJ7cQ2g,2,1,5,K-sVAiTr6q-0dVwDZtwUtg

Everything comes in a large portion to share.
I came for lunch and I had to share that because it seemed like a dinner portion. Prices are pretty good and affordable (check it happy hour and lunch time menu) 
They even ask if you'd like your picture taken. And if you agree they present the pictures to you in a fancy frame (to entice you to buy) but if you decline to buy they give you two free small pictures!

The Good.- all the pasta is made in-house! The pasta is delicious, the sauces are full flavor and The portions are huge! With a large serving at least 6 people can eat and be fully satisfied! 

The Great.- if you are having a birthday, this is the spot to celebrate it! They bring you a huge candle, everyone comes and sings to you. They make you feel special! Like your family would! 

The Best.- kudos to the staff, everyone is very friendly and They keep checking on you. They even give you a free picture, and of course they try to sell you an additional one, but it's a great deal! And guess what! Its a business, that's what business do.

Overall.- portions are huge, staff is very friendly, food is good. Come hungry, make sure that you do not order too much food and you will leave happy!",fdUhgq8RKk5Zyniyc3O2Vg,0,0,4,BxwlXqC4pBQaTr92RXvQ7g

Our server was fairly snappy about their portion sizes when we both ordered separate entrees.  She over-emphasized it was for sharing.  Yes... we know.. you said it multiple times.   Our plan was to eat some of our entree and have it as lunch and leftovers during our road trip.

The portions were ginormous, and we were warned, we planned for 2 day lunch leftovers but it was good for 3 days.

I ordered the spaghetti and meatballs, it was delicious.  Giant meatballs made properly Italian (half pork/half beef).   Despite the small annoyances, I enjoyed the food.",h1Vsz24g7TLA9ZfIDiFjbw,0,0,3,pqWbS3eDbcZgP0RQdWJjyg
