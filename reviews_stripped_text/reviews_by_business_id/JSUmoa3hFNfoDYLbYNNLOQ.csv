I had the menudo and a carne asada taco and they were both very good.

Good prices. 5 star for food, proces, and staff, just had to take a star away on overall, for one thing. Cleansiness. Floors and men's restroom could be cleaner. Plese mgmt, keep your place super clean, then you have yourself a 5 star restaurant.",g-HFMffU6L2nH4bwv04FIw,3,1,4,HzN7Jr7kbqFSjgYcwTG90g

2703051,2017-05-20,0,JSUmoa3hFNfoDYLbYNNLOQ,"So my boyfriend stopped this cute place today and honestly almost didn't try it. I wanted crunchy tacos but on their menu it only shows street style it wasn't till I asked that's when we decided to stay. I ordered the combo play with 3 tacos which came with rice, beans and my choice of tacos. I got ground beef, grilled chicken and carne Asada my boyfriend got the Cuban Torta served with French fries. 

Okay so the service was amazing and the place was clean and setup so cute with tables and each table had a flower set and there was outside seating! 

The food my tacos were really good and the beans and rice were amazing, my boyfriend enjoyed his Cuban torts but said it was a normal one for home but it did taste rather delicious to me! 

Overall the atmosphere was so good and the salad was also amazing really enjoyed everything definitely returning back",IABgxeTKlCOFazhEPz6sQw,1,0,5,fNYkAj-Ak_8VQqVWu74mnA

I've never been to Mexico but the Machaca Eggs scream Authentic.  It was served w/in 5 minutes piping hot.  Whenever I'm at North Las Vegas Airport at lunchtime, I'm coming here.

3125332,2018-01-13,0,JSUmoa3hFNfoDYLbYNNLOQ,"I ordered the beef & chicken enchiladas. They had an odd taste! Nothing like I expected. The taste was quite bitter & sour & no it was not the sour creme. Also ordered caldo de Res which was delicious along with 2 tacos (carne asada, pastor). Not to mention, i ordered a cheese enchilada on the side of the caldo de res & that was forgotten... also- I ordered beans & rice which were also tasty.. but when I received the beans they were completely all spilt from the containers into the bag. So I hardly even had any. For the amount spent, I was not satisfied. Will not order from this place again.

Ordered on the 12th of January at 4:00 pm",qKQiB37HBoSCbviaqsiTrA,2,1,2,L1siXhafplcneVVR684XKg

I ordered a club sandwich and since there was no description on the menu I asked If It was turkey and the lady told me yes, I also asked for no tomato. The sandwich  came after 15
minutes of waiting and had tomato. My husband sent it back because I was in the restroom at the time. 5 minutes later the sandwich  came and it was not turkey but ham. Ham and bacon on the same sandwich ? Really ?! NEVER AGAIN. I can't believe I wasted my lunch hour at this place !",bCbLNyvbjgvqLn-9rxca0Q,0,0,1,o2aePvC9f0S4j5Hv3p3X7w

3742651,2018-02-25,0,JSUmoa3hFNfoDYLbYNNLOQ,"One cashier, one cook, on a Sunday at a busy Mexican food place is not a good mix. Our order took 45 minutes to get to us, there were only two orders before ours. Keep in mind this is a step above a Robertos, it is by no means a full fledge mexican restuarant; so the cook time  shouldn't be that long. My taco order ended up being wrong, instead of waiting an additional 20 minutes, I just ate it. As far as the food portion, I had the smallest burrito I have ever had in my life; no joke, so much for a California burrito. The meat was basic and the beans were bland. We won't be returning. If your time is valuable to you, then I suggest you don't either. 

The two star is for thier prices, salsa and cleanliness.",OJJSJyh_YUQWxUYAuPtUGw,1,1,2,qAU7Rc_wFTMKlTLLTBxJrg

Camarones a la diabla - 8/10 - sauce is amazing and extremely spicy, shrimp are small though

Chile relleno- 9/10- HUGE chile! 

Enchiladas red and green- 10/10- perfection, not over sauced 

Carnitas tostada- 10/10 huge and delicious 

carnitas tacos- 8/10 just simple tacos but with any of their sauces, they're off the charts",gUu0uaiU7UEUVIgCdnqPVQ,1,1,5,KhLZs1-fdJGzaXLceaCYug

Normally I eat half and have the other the next day. This was so good I finished it off right away. Their portions are always decent size and a great value.

5565014,2018-04-22,1,JSUmoa3hFNfoDYLbYNNLOQ,"I just ordered $52 worth of food through Postmates. Two menudos, 2 seafood tostadas, and an enchilada plate. 
Blows my ever-loving mind how or why these people would not pack spoons, forks, napkins, lemon, salt, hot sauce, oregano, onion, NOTHING. I can't even begin to express the ultimate frustration of having no utensils and even more so, having ZERO fixings for my menudo. If you understand the concept of menudo, you know it is not MENUDO without lemon, onion, oregano, and hot sauce or some form of chilè. Cevichè with no hot sauce or lemon and salt???? Then, I open my daughters enchilada plate and I must've counted a whole 7-8 grains of rice. To make matters worse, I called them immediately to complain. Low and behold, I get a machine that says they're unavailable. I figured maybe it was just this one call they missed but nope, I called them as many times as there were grains of rice for the enchilada, 7-8, and no one ever answered. How is a place of business ""open"" but takes no calls? Had they heard my complaint, they would've had the opportunity to rectify the situation (or at least I would've hoped) and they would've spared this negative review. The food was OK-tasting. Just make sure if you're ever ordering for delivery, that you call and remind them to include whatever fixings go with your dish and also remind them of the bare essentials because apparently these people think we live in the medieval times and eat with our hands, then wipe them on our clothes. 2 thumbs down, plus my two big toes down.",HX6oMKSkmBkmTb3zfVsWWw,0,0,1,8k4IfjBRxubso-SApAD5ag

The beans are cold every single time, not sure what the problem is there but the rest of the food is a good temperature.
