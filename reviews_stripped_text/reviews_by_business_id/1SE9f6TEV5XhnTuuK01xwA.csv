Then, I saw the cashier went to the kitchen and was fighting for the receipts and just pinpointing this and that and those. Technically, no wonder why our order took so long because they are unorganized. Now, speaking of garlic parmesan chicken, I was surprised that literally they just pour the cheese on top of the chicken? Arggg!! I could have done that back at my place. The last complain was the fries, it was huge but totally blah!! OMG!  It really ruined my day for some reason, it spiraled the whole entire day because of this experience.

955077,2017-06-27,0,1SE9f6TEV5XhnTuuK01xwA,"So, if you've seen my other reviews, you'll know that I dine out often, but only because I've been too busy to cook. However, for the past month or so, I've been laying off fast food/restaurants and instead have been preparing fresh food at home (anything I eat out, I can usually replicate quite well at home). But, this past Wednesday, I decided I didn't want to cook and my youngest daughter, then suggested Wing Stop. We've gone to Wing Stop multiple times in the past, as this is my oldest daughter's favorite place to dine because she loves, loves, loves Buffalo wings.

We arrived around 5pm on Wednesday, June 21st. It wasn't crowded, just a few tables occupied. We were greeted by friendly employees and then we had our order taken. So, I ordered the ten piece wing meal, (all Garlic Parmesan) the 5 piece chicken tenders meal,  plus an additional 4 (for $2.99 per two). And then, my oldest daughter ordered the 8 piece wing meal (mild sauce).

We all received our food fairly quickly. It arrived hot!!! Presentation was great! And, equally important-the food tasted very good! The Louisiana Rub strips had powerful flavor, as did my Garlic Parmesan wings. And what I noted this visit, is that the Parmesan on my wings was plentiful. I was definitely impressed because I have ordered the same wings on multiple occasions and I sometimes have had to request more Parmesan. Not this time, though! My wings were fully covered and so so juicy, tender too! And also, my daughter, the Buffalo wing lover, had not one complaint about her wings, but then again, she never does. 

Overall, wonderful experience, excellent customer service, clean establishment, spotless restrooms,  good music. Of course I'd recommend and of course my family and I will be back. After all, my daughter would have it no other way.",wWjM6sgMiwjsCE8SjlM9ZQ,0,0,4,gYrVdwN1_dYlPYzK2lG2tQ

It's run by 18 year old which is weird cuz they sell beer. they charge you for the dipping sauce. after us getting 24 wings in 35 minutes. and yes I counted and not only that I realized shity to order Bud light in general however we did with these wings only because it goes well with wings outta their poor beer selection. Come on its Vegas.  so I just got my order and they f***** up. I supposed to get half boneless and half bone in and we got all Bonin. so I mentioned something about it and they took away half of our wings to discover that they can't resell them I'm sure. anyhow this is my first time here and we'll definitely be my last and will definitely be my last.  this very well may be the worst experience I've ever had Vegas.

Well first things first I am a Chef and know how long some wings should take, well they took forever about 40min to come out and it wasn't even busy. That alone made me curious to if my wings are sitting or going to be extremely over cooked. Well I got home ready to eat and took a bite of my first wing, it was beyond over cooked. So over cooked I couldn't even eat it it was like trying to eat a rock. There are no wing stops close to my house so I had to go to this location but I will never go back again. Hopefully all locations are not like this one.

1297508,2013-04-06,1,1SE9f6TEV5XhnTuuK01xwA,"Okay...ladies and gentleman, when I was a child in high school I would go almost three or four times a week to that place with a Buffalo which has these ""wild wings."" I've grown up, I've matured and I'm now a loyal Wing Stop-er. In all honesty, I've been taken back by how much I have started to love this joint. I haven't been to any other one, so this is my review of this fairly new location conveniently near the UNLV campus, easy access coming from school. The place has a good size, I came here and watched a UNLV basketball game and the environment was just right. There's a bar for drinks and of course the wings.

As soon as you walk on in, you are greeted with cheer. It doesn't feel like that greeting where they employees are forced to ask you how you're doing as part of their job description. I'm sure it's somewhere in there, but the times I've been there I've never felt like the welcome was never genuine. That is my humble opinion. This isn' necessarily a sit down and order restaurant, but you go on in and order at the front counter. The choices are endless, they have bone in wings, boneless wings and chicken tenders. Combos come with a side, usually a generous portion of fries or if you prefer fried mushrooms or pickles. It's all there. 

So you order at the counter and find your seat with a number, you wait for a fair amount of time and you are greeted by name with your food. The sauces I've had are lemon pepper, parmesan garlic, original hot, hickory smoked BBQ and mild. None of them have been a disappointment. The first time I came here, I'll say I wasn't the biggest fan of the boneless wings. There was little too much breading, but it didn't ruin my virgin experience. I say get the bone-in wings because the wings are big, they are bigger than that other place everyone's on the nuts of. Your meal COMES WITH ranch, and not small, dainty container but a generous portion of ranch as your dipping sauce. 

I'm in love with wing stop. It is my new abode for wings. I prefer this over any other wing joint I've had in a while, because I feel like I'm welcomed and of course they give you the bang for your buck. Eat here, enjoy some beer and don't forget to thank them so graciously as you leave. Because you'll be coming back.",cDrNm3ybIQF24wm-lr672g,4,1,4,e7E_ZqVbr5AOgPGFD4APEQ

    I ended up getting their 8 wing combo which came out to be little over $10, which is not bad.  Got two flavors:  Louisiana rub and garlic parm.  Order took a lil while, which I expected ( a lil over/under 10 mins albeit the place was pretty much empty but I kept thinking they make it fresh ).  Anyways my order arrived and immediately I noticed the order did not looked right.  I know Louisiana rub and what I got was NOT Louisiana rub.  So I proceeded to tell the server to get it corrected, he agreed said he'd never seen Louisiana rub like that ( the rub was non existant, pretty much they gave me oily wings with pepper and some salt ).  He went to the kitchen, spoke to the cook came back a few mins later and to my surprise told me okay here you go.  I was like the same ones?  He then said yup the cook says that's how it looks.
    So I ended up unsatisfied.  Even my friend tried them,  said that does not taste like Louisiana rub.  In all a bad experience, the server tried, but the cook made it for a bad outing.

The Wing Stop chain has decided to branch out and try a SPORTS version of their original place...

I understand we went there on the second day but we decided not to overwhelm anyone so we sat up at the bar.

Yes everyone was pleasant. But there is a fine line to having 5 (yes five) people waiting on you and good customer service. Every time I turned to my hubby and started to say something to him someone new was asking me a question.

It felt like they were getting ready to tell me I did not have enough FLAIR on.

Anyway...
The chicken:
I ordered the three piece boneless plain. Sounds boring but I like spice and hubby does not. 
They hand batter here. It's more like a country buttermilk recipe without the black pepper part. There boneless at this location are large chicken strips. I tasted them (see my pics) and they were good.

The sauces:
The garlic parm sauce was disgusting. It taste like mayo, paste, shake parm and who knows what mixed into a chunky glue. 
My hand went up immediately and one of the five helper guys flew to my rescue. I explained it taste spoiled and I asked for Teriyaki. It kinda tasted ok. Just a really thick syrup like sweet soy sauce.
I ordered the regular hot sauce. It was ok. It had just the right amount of kick but not too much vinegar. It seemed a little watery but at least it was not thick.

The fries:
Standard fresh cut fries. I don't remember salt or pepper being on them. I'm not a salt fan so I would remember.

Carrots and celery:
For the 99 cents you pay for them I actually got about ten pieces of each which seems odd lol.

Sooo...I understand the sports bar concept and idea you are going for but you picked a horrible parking lot. (It's in Best Buys parking lot). I understand all the employees need to be trained but like 20+ all during the day (we went at lunch there were two tables filled)? 

PS the guys...I don't know which one...rang our order under Carry Out...thus the machine gave us no spot to place a tip when we used our card. Odd.

We won't be back. Don't really care about all that FLAIR. And the food is nothing to write home about.",zgV0ZroIF956gw4cul8MHA,2,0,2,sSnmCxsxVGX8vS5elIeUzg

They have a bunch of bottles too ass well ass wine by the ""glass"". No liquor though.

Almost forgot to mention the coolest feature Wing Stop has to offer...They have one of those soda machines that has over a hundred unique soda flavors. Example, they have vanilla Sprite, peach Sprite, cherry Mello Yello, cherry vanilla Dr Pepp to name a few,

Update:
My brother-in-laws wing finally came out and, although also taking a while, they were way bigger & better cooked. He got the Louisiana rub. Great flavor and good bite.

And on all 3 orders of the 24piece wings we were able to get different sauces for each set of orders. They made the ordering process easy and it didn't take too long for the food to come out  despite it was a busy sports night during the  basketball playoffs and we were a large group.

Its basically like a sports bar similar to Buffalo Wild Wings.  This Wingstop has much larger space for seating, has a wider variety of food selections including burgers, appetizers etc.  The manager is also a really cool fun guy who has always been nice to my friends and I.  We used to know this guy when he was working at a different Wingstop in the Vegas area.  I don't know if it was luck, but my wings were larger than I think I have ever had from a Wingstop before and they are always good size anyways.  Tried the new Mango Habanero and those were delicious along with Cajun.  They also have the best ranch of any place period.  The place was in a busy area, kept very clean inside, and they have those new soda machines with like 1,000 flavor options so that was nice too.

2090203,2017-07-12,0,1SE9f6TEV5XhnTuuK01xwA,"I am big on Wingstop. Love eating them wherever I go. Granted, as with any franchise, you're bound to have some good and some bad. Well, this one is down there with the bad. It's the first Wingstop I've been to that is a Sports themed franchise. It appears to double as a Cowboys fans meeting place to watch their teams games, given the Cowboys jerseys they have hung around the place.

At any rate, back to this review... Went to this location last Friday evening, around 10pm. Granted, this place closes at midnight, but it appeared that the staff here were more worried about getting their weekend started, than actually being courteous to patrons. The line was several people long, and only one cashier taking orders, while some of the other workers were chit-chatting on the side, and texting on their phones, all the while the line kept growing bigger.

I noticed this place has some type of loaded fries that other Wingstops dont offer, with some hot/spicy toppings. I am not into spicy food, so I just ordered my standard 10 wings bone-in combo. 

They give you a number which you take to a seat and you wait on them to bring you your food. What we didn't like about this location, and I am sure it's a health violation, is that they had a Wringer Mop Bucket, with dirty water in it, and a mop in it, WITHIN the seating area, next to a table. That's kind of nasty, to be eating around a bucket with dirty water within 10 feet of you. Not only that, but the table that it was near, had a small bucket of dirty water that the employees were using to clean up tables with. Pretty disgusting, and again, very sure that's some type of violation to have janitorial supplies out and about in the dining area while there are patrons in the place, and well before it is closing time. 

When we got our food, we had to ask for extra lemon pepper seasoning, because they 'forgot' to season our lemon pepper wings -- Like really tho? Yep! On top of that they forgot some of the extra dips we ordered, so we asked and they brought us extras.

Overall, for this being the closest Wingstop to the Strip, you would THINK they'd have their stuff together, especially on a weekend evening, but sadly, they don't. I wish the management of this specific Wingstop actually read some of these reviews. As paying patrons, I think it's only fair that patrons expect at the very least sanitary (up to code) dining conditions when dining in. 

Definitely don't plan on returning to this location.",Si6CDh3AIT5hrsqYFebLLw,0,0,2,Yv4zfGBKnT1izNphMI7tjg

The employees taking orders aren't friendly and seem like they're being bothered having to work. The wings I ordered were not freshly prepared. They were luke-warm and dry. Clearly they were pre-made and sitting out for a while. Maybe they're trying to save time or be efficient by doing that but it's not working. Also, their sweet tea is also barely sweetened. The only good thing about this place is that they have a lot of TV's to watch sporting events. 
I normally go to the Spring Mountain location where the wings are prepared to order and service is friendly.

Most people come here for the wings like myself, which I believe are hands down the best in town!! These wings are made to order, not like at Buffalo Wild Wings where they cook them ahead of time and place them in warming ovens - the sauce selection is not large compared to BWW but that is okay, since I like hot wings, I always get the original hot, extra wet!! The original hot is just hot enough for me but no too mild! They do have Cajan and Atomic Hot which is above Original Hot. If you are not into hot, they do have milder flavors including lemon pepper and hawaiian.

How is the place like BWW you ask? They have an expanded menu that includes wraps, sandwiches and burgers! Plus a bar that have several beers on tap!

One of my favorite foods is chicken wings and I am very confident that this place has the best wings in town!!  Give this place a shot, you will not be disappointed! 


I am not sure what Elizabeth or others are thinking but their reviews are WAY off base. Elizabeth seems to be basing her review on people asking her question, this place only opened up a few day before she posted her review - get over it, they want to make sure you are being taken care of plus they are new employees. My rating is based on 1) The quality of the food 2) The customer service 3) Atmosphere 4) Overall experience.

This is the closest location to my house and it's still about 15 minutes away (all streets) but damnit, I love this place.  I ordered about 25 wings (4 different flavors) and two sides of fries online on a Wednesday night and the site said 20 minutes.  Honestly, I didn't believe it.  But I drove over there and it was actually being bagged as I walked in the door.

Awesome. Just awesome.  Easy parking, super-friendly staff, very clean location and it looked like they had some great dine-in specials with beer.

Online they had a special for 60 cents per boneless wing, minimum 5, which is pretty good in my opinion.  I don't know if this is a consistent thing or not.

The french fries had much less sugar than I was used to, which certainly made me sad but they were still good with their delicious ranch sauce.

Their Louisiana rub packs quite a punch!  I think it's by far the hottest - Atomic is a joke compared to it.  Their Teriyaki is also still on point, and their BBQ was good to try once but I'm just not a huge fan of BBQ on chicken wings (I got some because I was sharing with friends who had never had Wing Stop).

The wings *were* slightly over-fried, though, which dried out the wing a bit. They were also slightly over-sauced, so those watching their sugar intake may want to ask for 'light sauce'? Sauces are quality - on par with Buffalo Wild Wings - albeit a smaller sauce palette to choose from.

Carrots & Celery (0.99) are a fairly generous portion, and come out cold, fresh and carefully cut - about 12 big sticks. One Blue Cheese cup (0.89) is enough for two orders of Carrots & Celery. Makes you feel better about mowing down a dozen Mango Habanero wings. 

On a related note: Have you ever noticed how crappy the carrots & celery are at Buffalo Wild Wings? Everytime at BWW, no matter where in the country, the carrots are cracked and old, and the celery is brown and dirty. Seriously Grade C vegetable purveying - so weird!

Back to Wingstop: They've got free WiFi that's faster-than-you-think. I worked for an hour on my laptop at the bar and had front-row view of 3 different DirecTV screens. They've got the full $160/month DirecTV package going on here so that's awesome. There are a lot of TVs in this store. This would be the perfect secret SuperBowl party spot. (don't tell anyone!)

 Its beyond me. All the staff have a great attitude but on my first wing I thru it up. I bit into the wing chew chew it sprayed everyplace I was like omg this chicken is not done I was trying to spit it into a napkin but I threw up...it was sad.

But the cheese sticks were great! He told me he was not going to have it any other way so he went into the kitchen and made more chicken & fries. After 20 mins he was back at the table...Once at the table I took a sniff and pulled it apart and it was NOT done. He explained that he never had this issue before. And he was really sorry. He said he just could not explain why his chicken and fries looked done yet was not done. I was like thank you for trying but I'm going home.

I get to Wingstop at exactly 11:13 pm hoping for my food that I had order 3 hours ahead of time. I give Arcoiris my name and I let her know that I'm there to pick up an order. She then says ""we don't have anything under your name"" I  tell her I placed it over the app. She then knew what I was talking about and told me that order was scheduled to be picked up at 11:15 to which I said ""fine I'll wait a minute then"" it was then when Arcoiris realized she had fucked up and never placed my order.

Really greasy if you get breaded wings since they make the breading extra thick.  I guess it's to fool you into thinking that you got more food.

Had the mango habenro flavor which were a sauced wing that I enjoyed because of the perfect balance of sweet and spicy.  My mouth was burning for a while afterwards. I'm not complaining because I like the extra kick.  Once again the boneless chunks were very crunchy with breading and all white meat chicken breast. I also had the garlic parmesan which were tasty but once again salty at times. I had to use the ranch for dipping on both flavors to balance out the saltiness and the heat from the habenro.

I've never eaten at a Wingstop before, but I'm all about some good wings with beer! 

The sign said open for business, so I stopped in to check it out. The aroma of the wings hits you as you enter in and because the place is so new [5 days old], the place has am immaculate look to it with the tables almost full of patrons who are eating or waiting for their order.

The cashier immediately says, ""Hi, welcome to Wingstop"" with enthusiasm. With a smile to match her energy, I did feel welcomed.

I let her know that I was just checking things out and without pushing products on me, she let me know that she was there to answer any questions if I had any.

The menu board was simple, not to complicated, and had quite a few flavor selections all menu items bundled with drinks and fries of different varieties.

I perused the menu and found something I would enjoy.

I ordered the 10 piece wings and had 2 choices of flavors. I chose garlic parmesan and BBQ wings.

I did not know that they came with a drink and side of fries. WOW! All for 11.99! Good deal! 

I placed my order and began walking around observing the dinging area. Lot's of seating, clean tables, and the patrons seem to be enjoying their meals.

I chatted it up with the cashiers and then eventually the manager asking if it was okay to take pictures for Yelp. He smiled and let me know that it was totally fine.

After receiving my order, which wasn't a very long wait at all, I headed home.

I couldn't wait to take a bite of the food and here's my assessment:

The wings, they were cooked just right, juicy and not drowning in butter garlic sauce or BBQ, plus I was given ranch dressing [You do get to choose your dipping sauces], The fries were soft, I prefer mine extra crispy but, that's my fault, I should've said something.

They Coke products but I did find a green tea that I enjoyed as it wasn't too sweet and so refreshing on such a hot day here in Las Vegas.

The customer service, the wait time for my food, and to biting into my wings seemed flawless and worth the wait.

I'm happy this place is now just down the street and is  another offering in the downtown Las Vegas area adding to the diversity of food to choose from if you're like me who resides in the area.

I'll be coming back again when I have them wing cravings! If you're in the Charleston/Maryland are, come stop in for a some good wings to enjoy!

You order off a board and and they bring the food out to ya, doesn't have a full bar but features a couple beers on tap/bottles and has a strong sports bar feel to it. Not sure why but this location seems to have ton of employees working (really just standing around) so service is pretty quick.

You can pick from regular or boneless wings along with a couple different sauces/dry rubs. If wings aren't you're things they have some other stuff on the menu also, along with fried pickles, kinda random but worth checking out lol.

I can't say much on the regular wings, not a fan of bone, but the boneless ones aren't bad. I kinda noticed that the breading was a little thicker than bdubs but still good. The wings are served wet, plenty of sauce/rub and are pretty big. Flavor range on their sauces is pretty standard, hot, medium, teriyaki, bbq, garlic parm, nothing unique Unfortunately for what the place is, its not cheap, about $10-12 bucks for a 8 piece combo with their soggy-ass fries and a drink. Overpriced for what you get and they still charge you a buck for ranch, smh... After lunch they have a daily ""happy hour"" specials that change each day, but they are pretty meh...

Go back to my house watch the fireworks on the strip and end out 2017 and begin 2018 full and happy. Did that happen? Yeah but it had some slip ups getting there. I ordered the family pack for 28.49 (bone in) about a week prior to the time I needed it. Considering it was a holiday, pick up was easy and the wait wasn't long at all. She called out our order named off everything in the list, it all looked great we drove home and set up to eat. The first bite of the wings were absolutely atrocious. The chicken wings look like they were genetically altered (like the skin was tough to eat, the wings were gross looking sort of like someone just cut them off a bird and dipped them in Hawaiian sauce) . It was so hard to eat I only go through two out of twelve before I just had to give up. Called them back and told them the situation. After being on hold for 10 minutes the supervisor (who im sure was very busy) got on the phone told us to bring the bad wings back to get some new fresh ones. She said 20 minutes they should be ready.
 
20 minutes later I grabbed the bad wings to go exchange them for the new wings. I assumed when she said 20 minutes that the wings would be ready, not 20 minutes come up here wait another 10-15 minutes and then receive the food. On an awesome note not only did she replace the wings but she gave us extra fries at no charge. She was super nice and helpful and it wasn't a big issue replacing the wings. The bad part is that by the time I got finished with the whole process I lost my appetite completely. The wings were better by far but I was so disgusted by the appearance of them, the previous experience of eating tough wings, and the sauce being more gelatinous then saucy I just gave up hope on eating good food into the new year. Oh well. I won't go back. I'm turned off by the food, thankfully the service was up to par and that goes a very long way in my book.",Pjk0cNsCF8i7ssrzuc0G5g,1,1,3,8O7wRm6uYv4FMX9Sb_9rsQ

The inside is smaller than what is looks from the outside, but still pretty spacious with bar and dinning area. I ordered the boneless with buffalo and Parmesan garlic and side of Cajun fries. The buffalo was pretty standard, but from other Wing Stops I've had in the past this Parmesan garlic was just okay. The seasoning on the fries was rather strong and almost not good. As much as I want to like the food here I can't exactly say it was good and I'd come back again and again. Although I did have some left overs which tasted better the next day?! Kind of funny I thought. I will give them a few months to work out the kinks and hopefully the food comes out better. I for sure will order the wings since wings are always better than boneless anyway. On the plus side service is good as other Yelpers mentioned.",loOoIBFpGbkx8WaIpQndiA,1,0,3,H0ABALoPf7kUCKtsnxksFg

Wingstop is definitely preferred over B Dubs and Hooters in my book but this location has some issues! We ordered lunch for an office of 8, using the delivery service. Little did we know delivery is through nightmare of Uber eats! The entire order was supposed to arrive at 12:15. Two orders arrived about 12:20 with little to no labels. A follow up call was placed about 12:30 that only 2 orders were delivered, no details of what 2! The employee appeared shocked and said they would follow up with the Uber driver. After several fails to get the latest update due to a busy line or placed on hold finally after 1 o'clock  they state they're remaking the food - with no detail of what's missing!! An estimate of arrival was asked and the employee? shouts out how long then replies 8 minutes 15 minutes later remainder of order arrived again with little to no labels. Either the remainder of the order was not given to the ""delivery"" driver or the driver brought it back! Either way there is a ton of room for improvement with the delivery service. I suggest a better channel of communication for starters, considering your outsourcing. Also don't lie and say your remaking it when you don't know what was delivered!

Located near UNLV and in the same parking lot as Seafood City, Wing Stop is one of those places where they're known for just their wings and sports bar type feel.  We had lunch here because we wanted something quick, didn't want to drive too far from Seafood City, and needed some protein. There's protein in it chicken, right?  We ended up sharing 12 pieces of their boneless Garlic Parmesan chicken.  Taste wise was okay and this got me realizing that I should have opted for their plain boneless chicken.  Service wasn't bad, but the food did take a little longer than expected.  As for the restaurant, it's spacious with enough TV's playing ESPN.  My biggest issue, that was an immediate turn off for me, was the smell of mop water upon walking in.

Nothing really great or different about their food that would stick out compared to other places, but I still like it. Very close to my house and is located in the same parking lot as Seafood City Supermarket. 

Pros:
1. Customer Service has been great every time I've been there.
2. Clean tables 
3. Drink station has always been filled  whenever I've gotten a drink.
4. Food came out in a timely matter.

Cons:
1. Several times that I've been to this location, their ladies room has been dirty and not stocked with toilet paper. 


I always get the traditional wings with the fries. The fries are really good. Wings at time seem to be small and hardly no meat on them. I'm not a big fan of how they season/flavor their wings. It's like they cooked them and then just threw on the flavor at the end. I like wings cooked in their flavor. Also, their wings are super greasy, especially the Parmesan ones. 

Not a big fan of sports, but this place has lots of TVs with sports playing all the time for all the fans out there. They also have a bar, which I've never used. Actually never got any beer at a wing place!! Overall a pretty good place!",GWs9J6lIUqrySTxl6uXO0A,2,1,4,6iZtj7xLXdab0No6NUbYlg
4085535,2015-04-11,2,1SE9f6TEV5XhnTuuK01xwA,"This place isn't great. Gotten wings to go twice and reached this conclusion.

The establishment itself is nice enough. Seems big. It touts itself as being a place to watch sports, but it doesn't seem to have enough TVs or space to really do that. The cashiers have always been nice enough. The place is nice enough.

The wings. For a place called wingstop, they really don't have that many flavors for wings. It's about 8. And even with that, it was hard to pick as it wasn't a great 8. And if you are not a fan of dry rub like I am, I guess you are out of luck. Your choices drop down to about 4. 

The flavors left a lot to be desires. Garlic Parmesan, you would think would be a nice cheese garlic rub...but it's really just slathered in sauce and sprinkled with Parmesan cheese. It just seemed weird. I could buy a container of Parmesan cheese and sprinkle them on wet wings. Original hot barely has spice and the wings were dry. Hickory Smoked BBQ was slathered in BBQ, but then it was too much. BBQ was bland and again wings were dry. Hawaiian though was decent, had a nice pineapple flavor with being overpowering. Side note: Spicy Chipotle sauce is not worth it as a dipping sauce. Feels more like a cheese dip than anything else. 

The wings are just sub-par, There is a debate between bone-in and boneless but this is the place where boneless is definitely the way to go. You get more meat and the meat is juicier. Usually boneless wings are bigger anyway, but most places, the bone in wings are juicier and taste better. This place just doesn't have that.

Fries were also very dry and apparently has sugar sprinkled over the fries. Pretty much everything is dry. Might need to spritz some water of everything, it could use the moisture.

I would suggest B Dubs if you wanted wings and to skip this place.",y1b_9KmwNUWG1AS3CazFLA,2,1,2,i03kAy4H6sQl3Qn2r-FWMQ

The wings, however, were soaked in grease, and very salty.  There was a little pool of oil at the bottom of my basket.  Funny thing was that my wings were dry, as if it was never coated in the oily mess.  Also my side of fried corn wasn't the greatest thing.  It was overcooked, and again oily and salty.",7ZSjntRADa_sV8vbTk_j5g,0,0,2,hYgRDjyQ7T3iycDQAEG_FQ

I have tried most of them so far and really enjoy the Louisiana Rub and the Garlic Parmesan flavors.    

It is also a nice place to grab a quick bite to eat.  You can be in and out pretty quickly when you need to be.  If you like sports, there always seems to be something on the TVs.  It has a sporty vibe, but it isn't shoved down your throat either.  It is a fun place to eat.

Dry bone-in wings. I have tried 4 sauces here and none of them have hit me as being something I would return for. Their sauces are not hot enough for me.

4262376,2013-10-03,2,1SE9f6TEV5XhnTuuK01xwA,"I've been a Wingstop fan for quite some time now.  My friends and I would got to the Green Valley Ranch location about once a week until it was closed down.  Then we started going to the Tropicana location (although not as frequently due to the location).  We recently found about this particular location on Maryland and wanted to give it a try.

The manager, DJ, transferred from the Tropicana location.  He remembers our names (even though we only go a couple times a month these days) and is always welcoming and friendly.

This location is a bit different than most Wingstop locations.  There is a bar area.  There is more seating than normal.  The walls are lined with TVs showing sports.  I like all these things.  At the other Wingstop locations I would feel cramped and would want to leave soon after finishing my meal.

The wings I got on this trip were exceptionally large.  I've never had a problem with wing size at Wingstop and these were even bigger than usual.  I typically get the hot sauce which has a decent amount of kick.  The wings are never undercooked or overcooked and are quite tender and juicy.

I love the ranch sauce.  It's thin without being watery.  Hard to explain, but it's perfect for going with the hot wings.

They have TWO of the coke machines with the touchscreens.  I love those touchscreens, but people can be slow figuring them out.  With two of them there I hardly saw a line waiting for them.

The only negative about Wingstop is the price.  A small soda, dozen wings, and a ranch cost me over $12.",Hv_q_ZnSIoZwdcoH0CyV2Q,6,2,5,rlewaaIzJ3n7dqLJa87yvQ
4262633,2014-01-27,0,1SE9f6TEV5XhnTuuK01xwA,"I realize Wing Stop is a chain, and those familiar with the brand are highly unlikely to take customer reviews via Yelp into consideration before placing an order here. However, I feel responsible for informing anyone who happens to glance this business that this is location has the one of the absolute worst customer services I've ever experienced. We ordered take-out here a couple weeks ago only to come pick up and the food and be told that the associate ""forgot to place the order. OOPS!"" No compensation offered for time lost or the inconvenience, not a cup of water while my boyfriend was forced to wait, which also left me waiting at my job to be picked up an additional thirty minutes. Giving it a second try this evening we experienced the same epically shitty service as before. We tried ordering the same ""special"" we were offered a couple weeks ago to be told ""oh you want the special? We don't have that."" Really? No suggestions to other specials you DO have that we're more than willing to purchase? 
With that being said, the Wing Stop off Nellis and Stewart has amazing service by associates who seem very happy to do what they're getting paid to do, might I add, no matter what time of day you're ordering.

The wings were flavored well and had a good amount of meat. Fries were good, but to me, they could have been cooked longer so they would be crispy. Almost every time I got fries here, they seemed soggy, not greasy, just didn't stand straight. I like fries that I can actually pick up with my fingers and dip them in my ketchup.

Food usually takes awhile to come out, even if there are only one or two people ahead of you waiting on their food. 

It's a give or take as to whether you'll find a clean table. Many times I'd come in here and there were still dirty baskets on the table or they hadn't been cleaned off. Nothing more frustrating than having to remind the staff what they need to do. And what makes it even worse is that those times, there weren't many people there. Lots of empty tables, just dirty. 

This location offers a bar, so you can order your beer or other alcoholic beverage, eat your wings and watch sports on one of many TVs. You do have to be 21 years old to sit at the bar. However, I saw several times when people sat there and they didn't check ID's. Maybe they were regulars.

I decided to go last night, but I order takeout just so I don't have to deal with waiting long amounts of time. I should have checked the bag because of course the order was wrong and they forgot my salad. But I live 20 min away so I lost out on my money. I'm so tired of this Location.

The customer service was awesome, positive, happy to be there, etc. They look like they have fun working there's food with each other. I order the 12 piece combo and large veggies (but it has an option for fries). Later, I kinda regretted not getting the fries. I was talking to a staff member, Manny, in general conversation and joking. I went about my business. Later, the same staff, Manny, bought a basket of fries to my table. How sweet!!! And no, I didn't ask or told him about regretting not getting the fries. I guess he must've heard me talking to my BF. The only concern I have is the bathroom was a little dirty. I only went to wash my hands, but I could see they're missing toilet seat covers, papers on the ground, and both toilets not flushed (which I know it's not their fault). But they should check the bathroom more. Also, the dining area had dirty tables, but I get it, they were consistently busy. Maybe they should manage staff time better or get more good staff. Last thing, it was freezing in there! During the day, I could see that being a benefit though.

Not crispy and under seasoned. Took 20 min for the food to come which is average for a fried chicken place. Overall I would come back here for the fried chicken but that's about it. Parking isn't too bad but it does get busy as its in a plaza with seafood city. Prices were average for this type of place,VKr0ll3NOeXyshHMc3tihg,0,0,2,tD9xvsDQgjqInT2PD90x2w

After saying no we were all here first, he started taking those of us who came in first. When I tried to give him feedback for at least having the other ladies say ""we'll be right with you,"" he says ""I just got out here."" In a very defensive way. Yea, I know, I watched you walk out here!! I then say ""yes, I know. This isn't directed at you but overall feedback for this location is communication with the customer.""

We place the order by telephone, order was 12 chicken strips, fries, beans, two blue cheeses, and an order of cheese sauce.

Called to complain, placed on hold, even spoke up and said I didn't want to be on hold because I had an order problem. On hold anyways. Hung up, called back and again said I had an order problem, the manager, Shawn, Swan or something said that the only thing he would do is give me free sauce the next time I came in... What? No I'm not satisfied by getting free sauce that I have already paid for on my next visit. A bigger attempt at a discount or comp would have been the only way I was going to be satisfied.

We ordered one of there specials, which the cashier was very helpful. ordered 6 garlic parm, 6 medium bone in. 6 boneless hawaiian and 6 boneless teriyaki. not a big fan of their boneless. just too much breading. we got our order quit quickly, but one of wingd were wrong. instead of garlic parm, they gave us lemon pepper. big difference!  went back up, told them and said they will bring it to me. the re-fire came no less than 2 mins? really fast. i figure they re-fried the wings, re-tossed and sent it to our table. that is exactly what they did. wings came back oily and tasting like lemon. went to ask if they re-tossed or made fresh wings. they said they made fresh wings. hmmm fresh wings in 2 mins?? i dont think so. told them that it taste alot like lemon, but they insisted they were fresh. so they said, if im willing to wait 18 mins, they would make a fresh batch. why didnt they do that in the first place. with no manager or lead line cook, they will do anythking they want. GOOD THING NO ONE SITTING OUR TABLE IS ALLERGIC TO ANYTHING. man that would be some bad news. FYI we turned in a purse to an employee. hopefully the rightful owner returned for their purse, and everything is in there.

On top of that, when we were in the middle of our order she had answered the phone....... 

After we received our food, the sauce tasted really oily and not good at all. I had gotten the mild. The chicken was hard and very breaded. The fries were soggy and not good at all.
