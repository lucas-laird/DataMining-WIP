I grew up with this place & have always loved the chili cheese dogs ;) Anyone from the West Coast & Southwest know what I'm talking about. You either love or hate this place. & I for one love it!! They always have great deals too. Like 5 for $5 chili dogs! 

Oh & by the way, you can thank me for inventing the chili cheese fries back in the early 80's, long before they ever had them ;) Except I invented them with the American cheese, not Cheddar :P",JUeGFCsprKVUYok4oLsdEA,3,5,5,ewZgURMWwODylrSthtbQsw

1634359,2013-08-16,4,peZSKlIlXBaCeEa-Bb6ndw,I love this place. Growing up in Southern California I would eat this often and still do. The 5 chili dogs or corn dogs for $5 is a steal. If you have them add cheese then they steal from you so take my tip and bring your own kraft singles from home people! .40 cents per dog adds up! The pretzel bun is good too. They have daily specials on the taste-freez goodies.,eytpwJXgg5nWU6jrlQ6qAA,4,3,4,h_D427qRuGO9ixkIni4V_g

United States on for the Mother's Day special on 5-14-2017
 Due to that I was there my children wanted to take advantage of the first student ID discount 20% off .  Wanted to order the  $15 crowd pleaser. The sign for the student ID exceptions are discount coupons daily specials or combos cannot be excepted. Due to the crowd pleaser did not state it was a combo I'm not using a coupon or is not part of the daily special I did not see a problemwhy I couldn't take a vantage of the student ID 20% off .  Due to there was no manager or supervisor the cashier call them owner of the store Said that what he said his mane was.  Cashier passed over the phone for me to speak to the owner Said . When I got on the line I introduce myself then Said started to yell at me explaining why or why not or what he say he was going to do. I was trying to talk to explain what I was trying do.   To explain myself.  I was unable to explain myself he kept yelling. I ended the conversation and I walked out of the store did not buy anything and will not buy anything from the store ever again.",sIDN9HfJxdcOYCIWNe1nUA,0,0,1,jLHd23wiQsOYJps3JhBLkQ

2208517,2012-01-18,1,peZSKlIlXBaCeEa-Bb6ndw,"I know, I know, five stars seems a little steep for fast food place like this, but it really deserves it. You figure we rate a business based on how good it is thinking of what the best it can be is. This place always has hot, great tasting food, served with a smile and it's always fast. Super clean inside, always consistent. It's pretty much the same few employees and they start to recognize you after a while. Mmmmm just talking about them in this review makes me want to go get some chili cheese fries!",5RLxzxLIY3ZXUUksr_dtXA,1,1,5,5Q1ofv_Q0jNwyeVj2R9H-w

Bring the alka - seltzer. As I live and breathe.
For God's sake .  You might not want to eat
here before a hookup. This is an ""I'm effin
hungry, I want it fast and cheap "" kinda
place. The kind of place where you go by
yourself and eat it like a dog... if you thought
I was kidding about the alka seltzer - I wasn't.",Z4-fGDigomv6Yr6TZ93s1w,0,0,3,aiZPRt4jvuIv6kqF0KnfDw

""Used to"", don't know what they changed, but I couldn't get through a whole one! Maybe it was the chili, but these are now crap! The fries were old tasting, the only reason I gave them 2 stars was the corn dog was decent. Sad when a lesser fast food joints quality goes down, surprised they're still in business!

The operator Said and his staff maintain the cleanest and most welcoming fast food outlet I've ever been to.  Probably because of that, the chili and hot dogs tasted better than at any other Wienerschnitzel I've ever been to.  Highly recommended when you have the munchies.",kkTOV5bnE9hHb5V_zd9b9g,4,6,5,7LBKYrX9m0qLgCTct0YqnA

I've spoken with the owner/manager (not sure which) and told him that a hot dog bun should be steamed or grilled or something....not taken from the packaging. He assured me he would speak to his employees.  Well, had a quick lunch at this location....it was extremely busy (drive thru window).  After about a 15 minute wait in line, I ordered and got my food to go.  Found a spot to stop and eat quickly....only to have a room temperature hot dog bun.  As much as I enjoy a kraut dog every once in a while....I need to find some other quick spot to grab lunch on the go.",SIEXigX-Kzc9Er2GgKBJbg,0,0,2,w7fzxjjB8pz_bd9iBmhJSA
