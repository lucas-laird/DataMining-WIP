461754,2009-09-13,0,5fpXjlC71y_mKORnPdX5zA,"I saw they opened a new Roberto's in a new strip mall near me on the southwest corner or Boulder Hwy and Russel Rd. Not sure of the exact address.

I have seen Roberto's elsewhere in the valley so I decided to give them a try. I've tried this place twice now and both times the food has been barely edible.

First time I visited I got the beef taco platter. First thing I disliked is they use shredded beef instead of ground beef. The beef was very tough and stringy. It took forever to chew and eventually swallow. It's like they took the cheapest beef cut available and boiled the hell out of it. The juices coming from it were watery and bland. The refried beans were loose and runny. The only decent part of the meal was the Spanish rice which was OK.

Yesterday I decided to give them a second try figuring maybe I just ordered the wrong thing last time. This time I decided to order chicken instead of the beef. I got the taco and enchilada platter.

I cut into the enchilada and forked out a big chunk of chicken which looked OK, so I popped it in my mouth and it was like trying to chew a wad of wet newspaper. I have no idea how they cooked this chicken to get it to this texture and complete lack of taste. I never had tough stringy white meat chicken before. I was literally picking the chicken fibers out of my teeth for a half hour afterward.

I gave it my best shot- 2 times just out of fairness, but I won't be eating here again. This was just bad!

I see other Roberto's get great reviews and I hear they are franchise operations with different owners and menus sometimes, so maybe this restaurant isn't like the others- let's hope.",u7Vf-xXa_yBw5XmevnTh4Q,2,0,1,OxzMbP0iR-lqSUl4FtEKyw

Wife gets either tacos or rolled tacos and I get either bean and cheese burrito or chicken burrito. The bean burritos are large and very tasty. The chicken burrito is a little bland until you spice it up but you get a ton of shredded chicken. The only place where a single burrito fills me up. We also get an order fries to share and are pleased with the large serving for very little money.

A couple times when we walked in there was a strong smell of a pine-sol type of cleaner which would kind of spoil the taste of the food if you ate there, but it's nice to know they clean the place.

Always a good idea to check your order before you leave. Once they left an item off the order, so I had to make a second purchase and wait for that order. it happens.",OjTzg-3qGUKtd9c2q9tnhQ,0,0,4,bRlDbaupOIsCyF6-ETjjBw

Several months ago, when I first started coming here, I was shocked to find a young child running around the KITCHEN barefoot. Um, health code violation. I stayed and ate despite this and I wasn't thrilled with the tacos. Not because they were bad or anything. The chicken just had too much pepper for my liking. But I have continued my Wednesday stops since then. And more often than not I am pleased with what I get.

But tonight I am more upset than I ever have been at any Roberto's. I ordered my standard two chicken tacos and one order of three rolled tacos with guacamole and cheese. The cashier, clearly the new girl, looked at me like I had guacamole coming out of my nose. I repeated what I wanted and she could not find the button on the register. She finally pushed a button and asked again what meat I wanted. I told her beef. The price rang up less than what I had expected. Less than normal, that is. I knew something was amiss but said nothing. Thats on me. I should have checked the recipt sooner. It showed chips with cheese. And also beef with no price next to it. Cool. I'm getting nachos with beef, right? Not quite. I got, quite literally, chips with cheese. Not even melted cheese. Not a single piece of beef. And my standard tacos were way sub par. They were cold. Colder even than the chips that wouldn't even melt the cheese. And the taco shells were not crispy anymore. They were soggy and chewy. Clearly these tacos are premade and only finished with lettuce and cheese right before they wrap and bag them. It makes me wonder why I waited nearly 10 minutes for my food when it wasn't even warm.

5066961,2013-12-04,1,5fpXjlC71y_mKORnPdX5zA,I always come to this Roberto's because it's so close to my house but every time they either mess up my order or they do something to mess it up. For instance a while ago I ordered a breakfast burrito no pico add beans. I even asked the guy if my burrito had beans and he said no pico add beans. When I got home it had pico and no beans. Another time I was craving Carne  asada fries and everywhere I've ordered them they have been really good. When I got home my fries look like they threw everything on cold and steamed it in  microwave. It sounds like I'm complaining but I'm not picky it just looked really gross and wasn't that tasty either.The other night my boyfriend got a carnitas burrito with rice and no guac ( by the way the guac is not freshly made its out if a bag with no flavor ) and I had a bite. It was super good carnitas was crispy and juicy and delicious. Of course the one time it's good I don't order for myself. So Today I went again and ordered a California burrito since they did a good job on the burrito from the other night. The potatoes were mush and had the consistency of mashed potatoes . If I wanted mashed potato I would eat mashed potato. When I order the cal burrito at the Roberto's on cactus and Bermuda the food is always good and the fries are crispy in the cal burrito. This place is either hit or miss most of the time it's a miss. I suggest driving to a different Roberto's because this one is not the place to come to.,r0j4IpUbcdC1-HfoMYae4w,1,1,2,-j4oF0nwKdChiu9zl_QmVQ

I ordered a carnitas burrito which was great. But when I payed at the drive thru, my order was 6.22, I didn't get any coins back so I thought the guy at the window just rounded up the change so he didn't have to count out the 88 cents, he actually rounded down and kept the 88 cents, as his tip?, I guess??  Before I realized what he'd done I was gonna give him 2 bucks for his trouble but not after I counted the bills. I won't be back to this location. I'm thinking it's pretty rude to assume a tip. It's basically stealing from a customer who would have otherwise been happy to express his appreciation for the service.",agUG2U3w_hcGmEETlgFUnQ,0,0,2,-BssMg2uaBxgAXVVTAALxw

The only issue I have with this place is there are homeless people coming up to your car asking for money... The funny thing is if the cashier spots it she will yell through the intercom ""leave my customers alone"" overall quick and convenient Mexican food.",OygAGE7jdqmMKjpx-sh9Wg,0,0,3,t9RmHOqdElbvRv3JWURvbw
5629474,2017-11-02,0,5fpXjlC71y_mKORnPdX5zA,Roberto's used to be really good food at a reasonable price but over the last year the quality of food has dropped and they've also added a 50 Cent charge for using a debit card and as of November 1st they raised all their prices by about a dollar to a dollar fifty per item making them by far more expensive than any other fast food place we lower quality food and another $0.50 making it even more costly if you don't pay in cash I'm really disappointed and sad to say I will not be going back.,bvKIzcCbShPsDU0BJlPkLw,0,0,2,Z2hQKiPqcxXBJuSrmPlaiA

Roberto, I wish your fries were as good as your rolled tacos. It was way too goopy and heavy with guac and beans and a little layer of fries. 
But on the flip side I'm not complaining about the loads of carne asada that was piled up on the top.. 

It was close but nothing beats the real thing...",E_Ts8j758tpiAZknHR7k4g,0,0,3,E-NqzgsILSCPF-GKxtefnw
