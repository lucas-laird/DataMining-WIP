I on the other hand had the BEST chicken Parmesan sandwich. My BF and I came here last week and I couldn't decide on anything on the menu until I saw the chicken Parmesan sandwich. Took it back to our room and when I took the 1st bite it was over. This was my very first, ever chicken parm sandwich. I tried to recreate it at home last night and it wasn't as good. I'd definitely recommend the chicken Parmesan sandwich.",rS5P-N1At5y7g5EIjnvu7Q,0,0,5,HMzbLmiwc9VSrrIbjg3hbw

My night at the Stratosphere I needed a snack before bed and I bought a large bottle of water, the hummus and pita, and a side of fries. It was about $10 which was great and it tastes good. 
The next day I went in and a Philly cheesecake, side of fries, and order of coconut shrimp with two gatores cost me over $40. The Gatorades were $5 each, which is a lot. And it only came with 6 shrimp. 

It's part if the hotel so I guess it makes sense to be overpriced but it just reminds me of cheap food you'd get at a water park or something.",ff7GisYFVfgk74gX7ZabCg,0,0,3,vTo1EsQxcW3VDlxwWjAe6g

They have a limited menu and when I asked for the Italian combination  I was told it's not available at the time because they don't have the sauce. It's over priced for the amount of food your giving. Spent Forty dollars on a Philly Cheese sandwich, a Gyro, a small fries, and cheese sticks.",XHLBXWbuYkl_dL3jZW_iSQ,1,0,2,r9c9IDnUZT7cQYsj97pfjA

I also ordered a basic breakfast that was cold as well.. For 28$ it was a scam of a place. Maybe some real utensils to eat with and plates instead of plastic and paper would help.",5btdyVhIDXcNw4ssh0dWEw,0,0,1,xyquAH578krKiThq2VhjSw

The Philly Cheese was fake meat - a patty broken up while frozen. 

What's worse is that the alleged Philly Cheese steak tasted like greasy oily salt. 

When I first came upon it I was a little ticked because of how small it was for the price. It was roughly  $13 for 100% crap. In the end it was pushed aside because it was inedible - regardless of how hungry we were. The $13 excessive price tag did not include what I assume would've been extremely greasy inedible fries. The grilled cheese was also so greasy the six-year-old would need it. There is no hope for this place it should just close.",pJP3wahfq3WE7E9VmD3-yw,4,0,1,HJpsY5UfUqsfMNbi0ZZnpA
4088994,2017-08-31,0,UQ_6a5c1k_7FI_SEaWYbQg,Paid 40 dollars for food that was SO small ! The service was over all okay the employees were nice but both my husband and my Philly steaks just wasn't worth 12 bucks each. Should have been charged 6-8 dollars at most. Rather go to Mexican spot next door,9DUhwxI-4hWb789SwPxP4g,2,0,1,vZMjXwAUJi_ul6XhU0B1wg

4440876,2018-02-19,0,UQ_6a5c1k_7FI_SEaWYbQg,"Disgusting and totally disqualified. Worse food I have had. Not to mention the prices. 5 pieces of ""fried ravioli"" of which has some sort of white paste inside accompanied by cucumber sauce? I was light headed and dizzy needing food and stumbled into this place only to find myself nauseated stumbling out. Don't waste your time or money UNLESS you already suck at cooking and this would be better than yours anyways. Chef Ramsey and Bar Rescue please save them!!!",_2FkDc-MGpX8Syf8No7TqQ,0,0,1,XD3uht3SMb6_s1E4aJumxw
