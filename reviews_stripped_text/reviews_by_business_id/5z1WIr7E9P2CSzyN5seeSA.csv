However, the service is marginal.  Our waiter, Ryan was less than attentive, making judgements on how many of the items ordered were necessary for the table.  Really?  The visit in July was also clouded by the less than stellar wait staff.  This is a special experience that would be better received if the staff were more in-line with the quality of the expected dining experience.

I am so glad I went!!  This is not one of those overly stocked buffets with a million choices that make no sense but what is there is amazing!  I must have had 2 bottles of champagne on my own, so right there the price is justified (to me at least!) but then I had almost 2 full lobsters, alaskan crab claws, belgian waffles, prime rib and all of it was quality!  Well one of my lobster halves was stringy and not good but the rest was perfect.  The waiters were so happy and jovial, the service was amazing, anything we asked for we got asap, the rest of the staff were very accommodating and when they would run out of lobsters or anything else, I didn't have to wait more than 2 minutes for them to refill, and that includes champagne refills, they were not stingy there!!  I highly recommend this buffet but don't go if you don't eat shellfish or drink champagne, because then it will be a waste of your money!  

A few tips, make a reservation, if you don't, they stick you in the side restaurant so you have to walk through 2 restaurants and back to get your food and they say the dress is business casual but it's really more casual than that, we saw lots of people in sneakers and otherwise dressed down.",9yuOMbrURP4we2CIZVuGdA,2,0,5,87-p75bFyBH8T1zAP7V9ww

128424,2014-01-27,0,5z1WIr7E9P2CSzyN5seeSA,"Too much hype, not enough substance.

This place aims high but misses. 

The not so sterling brunch buffet does provide a variety of offerings not common to run-of-the-mill buffets. This Sunday morning, the hot selection, among other things, included lobster tails, duck breasts and lamb chops. The cold selection was highlighted by plated salmon lox as well as domestic caviar and its accouterments. The above were sandwiched between champagne service at the table and bite-sized sweets and fruit selections for desert.

Shamefully most of the hot protein was well overcooked or had been sitting on the line for too long. The lobster tail was rubbery, the duck was inedible and the lamb... well just not good.

At the table while our hard working server tried to keep pace, she fell well short. Two rounds of dishes were not bused, coffee could not be ordered alongside desert and the final bill had to be sought from the passing manager. 

We had high hopes for this visit based on previous reports but I guess there is only so much quality that can be delivered on a buffet line. There is no excuse however for poor service. At more than $80 per parson (not including gratuity) excellent service is the least that must be provided. If this brunch returns post-construction, hopefully it will be better staffed and managed.",SqKsjIh6EtBf2XQl9P4fnw,0,0,2,FtZlOFGsmsAnj7wH9zMFvA

I am pregnant, thus did not take part in the overflowing champagne. I ordered orange juice which did not get refilled till I asked for it. Our server was busy pouring champagne around us that i had to drink my husbands water when i started chocking on my omelet.

The charcuterie table was lackluster, the potatoes and chorizo hash was greasy as well as everything else. The dessert table was unimpressive as far as Vegas standards are concerned.

165038,2011-04-25,2,5z1WIr7E9P2CSzyN5seeSA,"I decided to come here after all the great reviews, however after eating at their Easter brunch at $85 per person, I have to say, I've had better. 

I'm not sure why this place gets such good reviews. I suspect they are mostly from those that like to get wasted on champagne, or have never gone to the Wynn, Bellagio, or Wicked Spoon buffets. 

Here's why:

Ambiance: It's in the Bally's casino which is a bit older, think the difference between gambling at the Bally's casino vs. the Wynn or Bellagio - yes, the restaurant is old and the ambiance is awful. It's like a Sizzlers. Why pay $85 for lackluster ambiance?

Cold Food: They have caviar which I liked, however their sushi quality was less than acceptable. I could get fresher looking pieces at a good kaiten (conveyor belt) sushi place. For example, the seaweed on their rolls and sushi were mushy from probably being made and sitting there too long. Note their caviar is probably not the best quality out there as some guy was scooping it out of a big white plastic container the whole time. You would think this place would have the class to use a glass container, or pre-portion them out in the back and have them neatly placed.

Hot food: Lamb was good and they had the basic prime rib which you can find at other places. All the other hot food was just okay or below my expectations. Yes, they do have lobster tails, but they were over cooked and hard which means you can only really eat one or 2 unless you like rubbery seafood.

Service: Fair to Average depending on the person. For the price of this buffet you would think it would be 5 star stellar and professional service. 

There is all you can drink champagne included in the price, but I only had one glass. You can go to other buffets and get a champagne add on for way less than $85 total, so don't bother coming here just to get drunk on champagne. It's not worth it.

In summary, save your money as it's not even worth trying once in your life. Go to the Wicked Spoon buffet or the Wynn. Even Ballagio's is better than this one for less.

The only thing that this place has that the others don't are (1) overcooked lobster tail (2) endless champagne included in the price (3) caviar. Save your money and go buy caviar at the store and you will come out ahead and thankful.",mp9EUxBzhHyWcips0mDn9Q,2,1,2,pD2rmfK2zHZ8DwOEYhA2tw

The selection of food was limited at best, unless you want to gorge yourself on lobster tails.  Food temperature was tepid.  The service is better than the food.  I would say that the most that I would be willing to pay should  be $50 per person instead of the $95 plus tax.  If you do not have reservations, you can eat at the bar, or wait for a table. Sterling Brunch is way overrated.  Should be called instead the Copper or Nickel Brunch.",_lyOtraPgyaoZVTRlqT0gw,1,0,1,YS4smVI51Pk8n0tJ-Vgq-w

In the end, regardless of the high price tag, it boils down to one thing.  You can only expect so much from a buffet.  At a buffet, food will be sitting around so it can't be at it's best.  

My husband and I did not enjoy the Champagne and ended up drinking orange juice or water.  


FRESH SMOKED NOVA SALMON
- it wasn't the best quality of smoked salmon.  Can get better at Whole Foods.

AMERICAN STURGEON CAVIAR
- had to ask someone where the caviar was since it was dispensed by two Asian woman guarding not only the caviar but the sushi. The caviar had a slightly salty and fishy taste which was good but did not pop in my mouth.  Instead, the texture was a bit mushy.

SHRIMP COCKTAIL
- fine

CRAB CLAWS
- not the freshest

GRILLED MARINATED VEGETABLES
- fine

FRUIT
- my husband had tons of it and fruit was very tasty

CRANBERRY CRUSTED RACK OF LAMB
- okay and tasted a little gamey

GRILLED FILET MIGNON, POTATO CROQUETTES
- I am not a big meat eater but the filet mignon was tasty and the sauce was good.  Loved the potato croquettes.

DESSERTS
- tried an assortment of desserts and they looked a lot better than they taste.  Not worth the calories.

In all fairness it is a buffet; hence 3 stars and not 2, and one of the better ones.  With that said, will we go back?  Let's just say, even if Bally's changed their price to $35.00, the quality of food was not up to par, so my husband and I will not be returning.",zbo7l5Aig14xgOQBteD3nQ,3,1,3,iMg7ZHnEzqR7J8Fh0hrQxQ

318178,2015-04-06,0,5z1WIr7E9P2CSzyN5seeSA,"I have to say the only reason they got a 3, was because of the caviar and the price. Tip: If you look under 18 or 21, and you don't drink the champagne, the cost is only $30. (Even though they say that children's price is $50) 
      The caviar was good, obviously not top quality, but good enough to be worth the price.
      However, the lobsters, oysters, and filet mignon were definitely not up to par. The lobsters, after seeing many good reviews online, I expected them to be tender and juicy. They were tender, but it was overcooked and was kind of tough. The oysters were the worst: not fresh AT ALL. It was also not shucked completely and was hard to get off the shell. They had no taste to them also. The filet mignon, looked beautiful, and would of tasted amazing if not for it was completely cold by the time I brought it to my table (even though it was sitting on a stone plate). One more thing, the smoked salmon was completely dry, probably because it had been out for long. Even the capers were hard and tasted like lemon seeds. 
      The service also, was okay only. Even though they were very attentive with refilling the champagne, they definitely was biased. Our server had always poured the last bits of the champagne and also were much nicer to certain people. 
       This place is definitely good if you're a fan of caviar and desserts, but for lobsters and mostly everything else they promote, it is either cold, tough, or not fresh. I don't think the food quality and service quality was worth $90.",r5EJxJuEtAI-GdGENSTndw,3,1,3,Bzk4rP9C-NQPAP3FMAAvMA

368389,2015-05-28,4,5z1WIr7E9P2CSzyN5seeSA,"Sunday brunch at the Sterling was ok, but not great... I had a few quips about our experience dining here. We had a reservation at 10:45am and the restaurant was about half full. We were seated closer to the back of the restaurant. 

After we were seated, we had a bit of champagne and then our server asked if we would have liked juice or coffee. (If you know me, you know I love a strong cup of coffee in the morning.) It pains me to tell you that the coffee offered at the Sterling is some of the grossest coffee I've had in my entire life. It was basically black water with a hint of coffee taste. I took one sip and never looked back. Disgusting.

One of the things my husband said he'd read about was how great their pop-overs were. We headed over to the buffet, but when we returned to our table, there were no pop-overs. Our server (usually I'm good with names, but unfortunately cannot remember hers) even sat other parties down near us - and she brought THEM pop-overs, but WE still never got them.

The buffet had a nice selection of seafood: jumbo cocktail shrimp, raw oysters, stone crab, Alaskan king crab legs... Even though our plates were full of shellfish, our server brought us a plate for shells but no claw crackers or tiny forks to maneuver them with. When we finally asked for them, it was delivered to the wrong table.

Our water glasses were empty more often than not and we had to request it to be refilled. Seriously?

There were times that our plates weren't taken away because the servers didn't come by often enough to clear the table. This is a buffet - get with it!!! They also didn't give you new utensils if they took them away with your dirty plates. That was mighty annoying.

Dessert was mediocre. Some of the chocolate tarts tasted stale.

Bathroom is across the way in Bally's. I would have preferred to not walk through that ashtray of a casino to use the ladies' room. Plus it feels like you're going back in time to 1990.

And who the heck said the attire here is ""classy""??? The description should really say, ""classy, but not really."" My husband wore a polo with slacks, and I wore a dress... While other guests rolled up into the joint in t-shirts, hoodies, sneakers, bejeweled tank tops, and sports bras. Are you for real??!?? Not classy folks!

I ate all the king crab legs that my little belly would allow. That was the only decent thing (IMO) at the Sterling. Other notables include the lobster tails and caviar. If you're not a seafood fan, I would say pass. The non-seafood options were your basic eggs, bacon, sausage, pastries, ... Asparagus, lamb, fruit/yogurt, and sushi.",04hS_dGfUZd_5iJYRdPHLw,4,0,3,2VF5tasYR0EgHECmd0nuXg

Second most advertised thing for the buffet is lobster tails - well they were so dry that nor butter or lemon could bring them to life.

The lobster was really good and they did an excellent job of keeping it replenished.  However, what was equal or maybe even better was the cracked snow crab claws.  Cold, freshing, sweet, juicy AND all pre-cracked they were so addictive.  King crab legs were perhaps little dry on the ends but they aren't really best served hot in a buffet setting.  Was too addicted to the seafood to try out the sushi (it does seem a bit  out of place), omelets or breakfast items.  Had one piece of bacon and it was very well prepared but how badly can you screw up bacon anyways.

Prime rib looked good but the lamb was the meat winner.  It was nice they had racks of lamb all ready at different levels, rare, medium and well.  Nice touch with the heirloom tomatoes with buffalo mozzarella  as well.  The prawns were very large and tasty but with things like lobster and crab available, the prawns unfortunately lost out.  In any other regular buffet, these prawns would have stole the show.

Desserts were stellar but there's enough good posts about them I don't need to add more only that you have to pace yourself and leave some room for dessert.  If you can, get an earlier reservation as they don't kick you out until you want to leave.  The couple next to us started at 10:30 and didn't leave until 2:00.

Tried to make reservation, said they were booked, encouraged to just show up. Enough open tables that we were seated  quickly. Got fresh popovers which was nice treat. Lots of items now must be requested from ""kitchen"". Service very slow and clumsy. Huge lobster tails lacked sweet flavor, crab legs weren't bad, seabass came is serving dish. Too large of portion which encouraged sharing. Tuna Tar Tar was finally received after long wait from kitchen. Very tasty but again big portion. If I wanted to order from kitchen or share I would have went to restaurant. Instead I went to high price buffet to be disappointed. I suggest ordering items from kitchen off of tiniest print menu. Makes you think they hope you don't order... Get a few items, just to try. They're large enough for table to share. Champagne refills were slow and wait staff oblivious to removing plates. Desserts were small snippets of sweet French pastries. At least that's what menu said. Waitress knocked coffee cup over while asking me to sign bill.

The remodel of the Steakhouse is better and much more bright.  Did look much less dated.  

The new format of the brunch with some items being made to order in the back is nice in that it those items are still hot.  But you really have to work at getting them.  We asked when we sat down for a list of special order items and staff was resistant to giving to us.  They also never checked back to see how we liked the items or if we wanted additional items.  Caution - if you order cavier expect less than two bites per order.  

The buffet line food was good.  Lobster little over cooked.  Sushi selection very poor.  Filet was cooked a nice medium.  Lamb was way over cooked.

We are professionals when it comes to brunch and this place did not disappoint. First, we were early for our reservation and they were so accommodating; while we waited we were are offered Champagne or a Bloody Mary which was a excellent way to start.

The atmosphere is so old school; dark furniture, green and white striped wallpaper, black and white Hollywood pictures.....very cool.  Our waiter, Javier, was above and beyond fantastic.  Never missed a step.....champagne was always flowing and never a dirty plate on the table.  Plus super friendly!

NOW....the food. Lobster, filet mignon, rack of lamb, prime rib, sushi bar and on and on.  Food was out of this world....nothing was a disappointment.  This is not the biggest buffet (at least compared to Vegas standards) but it is a choice buffet.  The lobster, filet and the Perrier Jouet alone compensates for the $85.00 price tag.

At first you may think it's not a big deal as the restaurant is average size and the buffet area is small, but seriously did you just read what I just wrote, quality not quantity of the offerings.

868852,2010-08-23,1,5z1WIr7E9P2CSzyN5seeSA,"I know my rating is definitely going against the majority of reviews, but I feel like the buffet was definitely overpriced and just a so-so experience overall.  The description of 2 stars is ""Meh. I've experienced better."" which is exactly what I felt about my brunch there.

I feel like the interior could do with a remodel, or could use a little sprucing up.  The decor reminded me of something you'd see in Reno; very old fashioned wallpaper, a bit dark, just felt kind of tired.  

The buffet itself actually doesn't have that many options.  I read that someone said they had uni and fatty tuna aka toro?  Nope.  There was some sad pieces of maguro and sake (tuna and salmon), nothing you couldn't get at your local Todai.  There were some nice cold seafood items (crab, shrimp salad, etc.), fruits, veggies, and of course your typical steam try things such as eggs benedict, sausage, prime rib, etc.

The biggest draw has to be the lobster tails and king crab legs (and bottomless champagne).  The lobster tails were okay when they came out hot, but if you don't get it right away, they end up sitting there and turning rubbery and overheated.  Lobster is something I absolutely love, so I can't complain too much but really, it kind of loses it's appeal if you see 30 lobster tails (most likely straight from Costco's frozen aisle) dumped into a metallic steam tray thing.  

The champagne and desserts were nice, but it honestly just felt way too expensive for $85 per person.  Maybe it's because living in the Bay Area, I can get a great tasting menu or pre fixe dinner for $85, where the quality, atmosphere and environment would definitely leave me more satisfied than what I had at the Sterling Buffet.  If someone were to ask me, I would definitely tell them to save their money and skip this brunch.

Service was great. Our champagne flutes were always full. When I was at the meat cutting station asking for some lamb, the guy was like ""how many pieces do you want"". I don't recall ever being asked how much I want at any other buffet. They usually just give you some pathetically small serving and send you on your unmerry way. So I asked the dude for FIVE lamb chops, just to see his reaction.  Unfazed, he delivered and it was delicious.

Late enough in the morning so that we can sleep off the fine dining and frolicking from the night before, and not so late that the nap we'll need afterward cramps our style. 

When you go, because you will, dress appropriately to impress at mid-day. The brunch takes place in Bally's Steakhouse and covets the upscale vibe. The lighting is low in a comforting way, they understand where you were last night, and why you are wearing your shades. And the booths are big and roomy. 

Come thirsty - the refills on all beverages are fast and generous. We always joke about bringing sharpies and just writing our names on the bottles of Perrier Jouet champagne that we'll empty - and then share an uncomfortable pause because we weren't really joking. 

Come hungry, because when that brief moment of silence is broken you'll be on your next trip to the buffet, and here is where I should admit that I do not generally like buffets, so let's call this a ""display"" of all things quest worthy for foodies: fresh, beautiful berries that taste like summer even in February.

eat 5 whole lobsters. wholesale cost approx $5 per lobster assuming they're using the frozen precooked canadian ones

eat 6 ounces of american paddle fish caviar. food cost approx $20/oz

eat 1 dozen oysters; food cost approx $12/dozen

if you're not drunk and puking on the way to the bathroom, at this point come back and try the lobster ravioli, lobster-boursin cheese omelet, eat 4 chops off a colorado lamb rack, then finish with the champagne jello and jumbo chocolate dipped strawberries.

965110,2017-02-01,1,5z1WIr7E9P2CSzyN5seeSA,Went here with my family for brunch the day after my wedding. Everyone was thoroughly impressed. It is the best buffet we went to in our lives. This place is where the party keeps on going with the free flowing champagne. Our waitress was extremely accommodating and very nice. We asked for chocolate ice cream and she said that they were out of it. A few minutes later she came back with it. She ran all the way to another restaurant to get us a scoop of chocolate ice cream.

They immediately greeted me by Mr. V* and welcomed my date and I into the lobby area. They offered Bloody Marys while we waited for a few short minutes. We were then greeted again by the manager and escorted to our table. The server then advised us of the features of the buffet. 

There was endless champagne and food was great! I wanted to eat everything! The dessert bar was full of goodies that were accented with a Valentine's day touch.

When my date and I left, the hostess again called me by Mr. V* and advised us to wait for one moment. She then walked over to a bouquet of fresh roses and hand picked the most perfect, beautiful, white rose and handed it to my date and sincerely thanked us for coming.

It is unfortunate that some reviews have placed the Sterling Brunch in a negative light, but I will chalk that up to inexperienced diners or people who expect to use their server as a footrest if they are going to spend $85 for a meal.
First the Champagne, Perrier Jouet is a solid Champagne house with a rich history and is widely distributed.  It can be found in grocery stores at about $50 sitting right next to Veuve Cliquot Yellow Label which will be comparably priced.  By comparably I mean exactly the same.  Have a few glasses of champagne and eat just a small amount of food and your meal is well worth the price.
The Food: 
 I always start my brunch with two lobster tails.  If there is any issue with quality (texture, taste, etc. and something I have never experienced) simply ask for a fresh tail to be made and it will happen.  
Rack of Lamb:  Do you like the more rare cut toward the center?  I do!  Ask for a center cut and you will receive it.
Sushi:  I enjoy sushi somewhat regularly and I am happy with the selection.
King Crab:  Delicious and plentiful.
Desserts:  On my last trip I was dining solo at the bar and when I told the bartender I'm not much of a sweets person she went and made me a dessert plate of assorted confections.  I started by tasting one thinking I should be polite since she put in the effort and ended up eating almost all of it.  Which brings me to....
Service:  White glove Tuxedo Service even if you show up hungover in shorts and a t shirt.  The only way to finish your glass of champagne is to chug the whole thing.  Otherwise you have a team constantly monitoring and making sure your glass is full.
For over 10 years the staff at the Sterling Brunch has taken care of my family, friends, and myself.

Our champagne glasses were frequently empty, table settings weren't cleared and replaced and the servers were hard to flag down. Since we have been going for years and know the servers well, we know the service levels they are capable of providing. Instead, they were busing tables and making kitchen runs for items not available at the buffet service.

The restaurant isn't a buffet, it's a steak house that only serves brunch on Sundays. We went in and sat down, greeted by champagne and ""fresh squeezed orange juice."" The server described it as such but I later saw him pouring from a carton that said, ""fresh squeezed orange juice"" into the serving pitchers.

The food is actually pretty limited and there aren't as many choices as wicked spoon or other Vegas buffets. The area itself is pretty small because it's not built for a buffet. There were oysters, snow crabs, a sushi station, a carving table (prime rib and lamb), two buffet self serve stations, and a small dessert bar. 

The seafood was solid and fresh. The prime rib was also good but nothing extraordinary. So why pay $90 for this buffet? Lobster and caviar. The lobster tails are thick and juicy, so if you're a fan you'll get your money's worth.

The caviar was also good but the most of the guys weren't fans. I recommend trying this at least once but if you want a wide variety then other Vegas buffets would be a better choice. If you really want seafood this place is perfect.",HF_S5O8SN2dGC-f2OPJ1aQ,2,0,4,2G1ApX9x6D19YgWh-pgD-w

The buffet is a lot smaller than before even with the items that are ordered from the kitchen. The filet, sea bass, lamb chops & lobster was lukewarm at best. The lobster didn't have any flavor & were tough (same as it was 4 years ago). The popovers probably would have been good had they at least been warm. The French toast was the hottest item from the stations & it was really good. I will give them 4 stars for the presentation but not the food or service. The wait was long to get plates cleared & he kept forgetting items from the kitchen or brought the wrong ones. The caviar is good & you definitely need to order a double amount since it comes from the kitchen (and in case you get a slow server like we did). I recommend the lobster Benedict from the kitchen. The king crab legs were very good albeit I had to use my napkin to hold onto them to crack them since the waiter kept forgetting to bring me the crackers. The rest was just ok.

- no sign of caviar, looked carefully could not find it. Did they take it off the menu?
- Would have liked the prawns, and lobster to be warmer. I did have the 1.30 booking, maybe that might have something to do with it but prawns were literally cold. Lobster barely warm more on the cold side.
-oysters were very small and not as fresh.
- beef in the pan was not warm either
- nobody explained to us as first timers the dessert was in the front bar. Only realised later. Maybe it is obvious but we didnt know.

1242300,2010-10-27,0,5z1WIr7E9P2CSzyN5seeSA,"Overhyped and not worth the price. For a $85 price tag you are supposed to be paying for gourmet food and champagne. Unfortunately a lot of the items on the menu ran out early. The caviar was long gone before I even start my meal. (Next time please don't give me a menu so I won't know what I can't have) I only sampled two oysters and one duck spring roll. Food running out 2 hours before the buffet is over is not acceptable. For the price they are charging, it is amazing how they can't afford to refill. I certainly hope it was just a fluke because of the busy Labor Day weekend. At least the champagne seem to be well stocked. 

Food is good but it is still just buffet quality. Lobster tail was sitting in the heated tray for too long and became tough and chewy. Prime rib, filet mignon and the lamb chop were nice but not much better than those you can find at Bellagio or Wynn. Desserts were eye candy to look at but the taste was very disappointing. The quality of chocolate used in the dessert was pretty average. Definitely not gourmet at all. Most of the cakes were too sugary. The desserts were no where as nice as Bellagio's. 

The champagne was good. Really good. They even served it at the lounge while you were waiting for your table. Reservation didn't seem to do anything at all. We still have to wait quite some time for the table. At least there were champagne.",41HLwXnR0Lm3NUp01cIOQg,5,1,3,Km4JucbbsX6x52sumSOjaA

The ambiance is wonderful; the service is top notch, and the food was delicious. The only reason I can not rate them 5 stars is because the lobster was a tad bit dry. They also had a hard time maintaining melted butter. Everything else was cooked deliciously. I feasted on caviar, delectable lamb chops, king crab, lobster tails, delicious smoked trout and cold smoked salmon, and the champagne was always flowing. There were many items I did not get to try because I was so full. I am looking forward to tasting all the items I missed during our next dining experience here.

Just remember though, that you get what you pay for (as in you pay roughly 85 dollar premium for excellent food). But its worth it, so save up and come here for brunch if your ever in Vegas.

The food here was amazing. I am a Seafood lover so I personally enjoyed the seafood offered here. From smoked salmon, Lobster tail, to Lobster bisque, it was amazing. PRAWNS, not shrimp....actual prawns are offered at this amazing brunch. Other seafood favorites I enjoyed were the oysters and cooked scallops. The caviar though I didn't enjoy all that much. They offered only one variety and it was black caviar and it was SALTY. A tad disappointed as ""top of the Mark"" sunday brunch in San Francisco offers a few different kinds of Caviar. The cooked food was also good but I can't go too much into detail as I was filled from 2 full plates of seafood. The Filet Mignon and Prime rib were delicious. Desserts were also absolutely phenomenal! 

As for the service, I thought it was alright. My dad noticed that each server took care of 5-6 tables each. The server wasn't THAT attentive in my opinion. Every time I wanted more OJ or champagne, I would have to ask for some more. I also felt like it took a while for the guy to come and clear the table of dirty plates. Very nice guy but could have been more attentive to clearing plates and refilling beverages.

Overall, I give Sterlings Sunday Brunch a 4.5-5 stars. The food quality was excellent and service was just alright. However, as we left the ladies ALSO received a rose (well my mom grabbed her own as the greeter guy was MIA and wasn't there when we were leaving, it THAT was a little disappointing).

We discovered the sterling from one of my customers about 10 years ago , and have dined there a least once a year since.

I believe this is one reason the Sterling Sunday brunch has been so popular, in addition to French champagne, broiled lobster tails, king crab legs, oysters, huge cocktail shrimp, lobster bisque, very tasty sushi. These are choices I go for first.  And there are many other items like the carving station, fish, sides and top notch deserts. We dined there last Sat. and had a great  time.   We will miss the Bally's steakhouse old Las Vegas charm and we can get that for you service. Example.  A few yeas ago my wife had been looking forward to the crème brulee but it was dropped from the menu so she mentioned  it to the waiter, he went to the kitchen and talk to the chef to see what he could do. The chef opened the the dinner desert  case and brought out this huge crème brulee . I have many stories I could tell about the service at the old sterling.   Now the new sterling, the food is the same quality as before.  The service was as what you would expect in a fine steakhouse. Plates cleared , glasses did not go dry.

In the past, the buffet was crammed into the center bar, but now they have expanded the serving line.   It's much more spacious.   It's still dark inside the restaurant, but not as bad as before.  

Food is very high quality.   There's endless Perrier-Jouet champagne and fresh-squeezed OJ to combine for delicious mimosas.   The server will bring you freshly baked cheese popovers which go fantastically well with the lobster bisque.   Might not want to inhale the whole gigantic puff though!

You can have made-to-order lobster & ham omelettes.   Or you can chose from lobster, filet, or prosciutto eggs Benedict.   Of course, there are lobster tails, prime rib, Alaskan crab legs, and caviar.    Be sure to save some space for dessert!   

This is actually one of the best buffets in Las Vegas.   Minus one star because we had an obnoxious server.   He thought he was being funny and humorous, but quite the opposite.

Reservations were made three months in advance for our group of four which is kind of unheard of for a buffet; but when you're only open one day a week and identify as the best buffet in Las Vegas, it is bound to peak your interest right?

With that being said, I would give Sterling a firm B- overall. I was surprised that Sterling did not have a location of their own and instead occupies Bally's BLT Steak on Sunday mornings nor was I really expecting a smaller, dimly lit ambiance as your standard buffet aesthetic. But the service was  undeniably impeccable, Roxanne was the most attentive & personable waitress I have ever had at a buffet. She was always there at every sip of Perrier and was kind enough to offer her advice about her favorite buffet items. Foodwise though, I would have to say that Sterling did not completely dazzle me; while the food was pretty well-cooked, the menu was exponentially smaller than I expected at $99 a seat. Rather than describing it as a buffet, I felt like it was more like a pre-set plated brunch made for 50 people at a time. I also felt like I was constantly waiting for food to be reset rather than immediately picking items for my plate. In the end though, I was still content with my experience; perhaps my expectations were just set too high. Worth-wise, I would suggest Bacchanal or Wicked Spoon at half the rate.

If you are curious to try though, I would definitely do Sterling at least once because the lobster ravioli and their mouth watering popovers were very unforgettable.",-fVKgpmSu0tDnf_xBPqU4A,6,1,3,z6s4SMzoh55zvffK_mcuEA

Unfortunately, they were dry and tasteless, which i should had anticipated knowing that they were Australian lobster tails rather than the much sweeter maine lobster. Had they been Maine lobster it would had been worth the almost $100 price tag as the rest of the buffet was at best 3 1/2 stars. Didn't see the caviar as they were either out of it or hiding it due to cost. Due to price and value it overall only gets 3 stars. However, if you like all you can drink champagne, which i loved in my younger years, it gets all 5 stars along with a 5 star hangover.

1443157,2010-03-22,4,5z1WIr7E9P2CSzyN5seeSA,"I've anticipated coming here for over a year. Overall, I think it was a worth while visit but it's definitely not a place I would visit regularly. It seemed many of the other guests were celebrating special occasions which make sense because this buffet does stand out. I have too many thoughts about my experience, both good and bad, so I thought I just lay it out. 

Positives 
+ Champagne served while you're waiting to be seated 
+ High-end menu selection not found in other buffets - unlimited lobster, caviar. Not one of those where you're rationed. Lobsters are full size, not the langostino variety. 
+ High quality food - large shrimp cocktail, jumbo king crab legs, fresh raw oyster, ripe fresh fruit 
+ Service - high touch attentive service - beverages refilled immediately. Napkins refolded every time I left the table and replaced when dirty. 

Negatives 
- Broiled lobster was over done and thus tough 
- Kind crab leg wasn't halved so you have to crack the legs. Not easy given the pointy spines and buttery sauce coating the legs . Had 1 leg and gave up. Maybe that was the objective. 
- $85 + tax and tip. Not for the faint of heart 
- Dessert selection was OK 
- Ambiance - stuffy dark old school steak house ambiance. Would have preferred for light, airy venue given this is Sunday brunch 
- Only offered on Sundays. Not the best day given we've already gorged ourselves the whole weekend and who wants to get stuffed right before they jump on a plane or car. With the LV - LA traffic, pretty much guarantees you'll be sitting in the middle of it by the time you're done.",rUnA4AJnSZWLRVsvWmoypg,5,4,4,QezWWMocKa94zfgw8ejiRA
1464521,2017-12-07,7,5z1WIr7E9P2CSzyN5seeSA,"I gave Bacchanal Buffet 3 stars and Wicked Spoon 2 stars, but The Sterling Brunch despite its doubled price is well worth 4 stars. There were hit and misses in terms of food but the service and unlimited pours of Perrier Jouët Grand Brut champagne made this my favorite buffet on the strip. 

Pros

Perrier Jouët Grand Brut Champagne:  As part of their buffet, you can indulge in their unlimited serving of Perrier Jouët champagne which is one of the reasons why I would return. If you haven't sipped this champagne, it's crisp but dry with fruity undertones and a mild citrus finish. Every 5-10 minutes, you could hear bottles popping because they were pouring these bottle as if it was water. Despite it being a pricier buffet option compared to the rest, money is well spent here if you like unlimited pours of good champagne. 

Service: Another reason why I would return is for their spectacular service. My server was Javier and he had the most attentive and warming personality. I went here for an early breakfast at 10am and he's the type of gentlemen that you'd want to encounter to start your day. And there's no better way to show your appreciation by tipping your servers well, Javier was informative being my first time and made sure my glasses was always full so I made sure he received a generous cash tip for his service. The other servers including the chefs behind the counter were also attentive with a friendly and likable charm. Even the hostesses were super polite and welcoming here unlike the other hostesses on the strip that come off cranky. 

Food: I always prefer quality over quantity but that's rare at buffets but at Sterling's Brunch you can find better quality meats and seafood made with care. Even though there is a limited amount of selections, the overall taste more enjoyable. Some of my favorites include the following:
-The filet mignon which did appear dry was actually tender and full of its natural juices. 
-The popovers which you may think is a waste because it's purely carbs was light and buttery and they bring fresh ones to your table as you are seated. I actually ripped a piece of the popover and served it along side with their salmon lox and caviar for a mini do it yourself sandwich bite. 
-The lobster egg benedict which you have to order from your servers was beautifully crafted together had tastier chunks of lobster on a soft and buttery biscuit with the egg oozing out as you cut it into half. I do recommend sharing with your table first before you order more since the biscuit is filling. 
-Banana Bread pudding is something I would normally skip at a buffet because of how filling it is but the caramel sauce and bread pudding was amazing. 
-The passionfruit crepe which they brought out to me by surprise along with a lovely Happy Birthday song was freshly made. The passionfruit sauce had a nice tart flavor.  
-The dessert bar is small but there is a good selection of sweets to choose from. Also liked how they were smaller or bite sized so you could sample more. 

Cons

Lobster: To be fair, I had lobster dishes at Joël Robuchon the night before so I had higher expectation of lobster in terms of taste. The lobster here also appear to be pacific lobsters so the taste isn't as buttery, but overall the lobsters were overcooked thus leading to a rubbery taste. Even though the lobster was a disappointment, their snow crab legs was delicious. 

Hours of Operation: My boyfriend extended our trip just so I could attend the Sterling Brunch which is ONLY offered on Sundays from 9:30am-2:30pm. I could never make reservations since I'm out of Vegas by Sunday. I highly recommend making reservations as soon as you can since it is open one day of the week. My boyfriend attempted to make reservations 3 months ahead and wasn't able to get a table but we snatched up a cancellation last minute.",-pzlhxN6-DtuvpX4blnTxw,11,10,4,ygn9HYxcH-Sas7vouZXVgg
1471570,2014-12-29,12,5z1WIr7E9P2CSzyN5seeSA,"Had an excruciatingly difficult time finding this place; just know there is no sign that says Sterling Brunch, but rather, it is inside a restaurant called BLT Steakhouse. I thought people were starting to mess with us when we asked where this place was and they kept saying in the back of the casino to the right.

Seriously, this is the best buffet you'll find on the strip, and I've probably been to a good lot of them. Yes, it is steep in price (probably will spend about $105+ pp), but you won't find nearly the freshest oysters, stone crabs, and lobster tails anywhere else. I probably ate a whole lineage of lobsters on my visit- they were all so nice and juicy (I think my friend had one rubbery tail but we'll let that slide). There is a wide selection of other items available for brunch like caviar, sushi, prime rib, etc. LOVED IT ALL. You can also order eggs benedict with either steak, prosciutto, or lobster. The hollandaise sauce is amazing! All of this while you are treated to unlimited champagne. I stuffed myself so much that I didn't quite make it to dessert but again, the display was beautiful. I'm sure they tasted great.

We had Sunday Brunch at Bally's in April and it was good. If you go, do 2 things:
1) Make a reservation
2) Ask to be seated in the area where Jason is the waiter. Our waiter was not the best, not even close. Jason will take care of you.

The brunch does have fresh caviar, sushi, King crab legs and lobster. You have to ask for the Caviar and Sushi. They won't bring it out to you automatically. Try the champagne and get lots of it. It's french champagne and it's the GOOD stuff. We must have drank at least 2 bottles of champagne while we there. We came out stuffed and buzzed, exactly like we wanted to.

My tally was 2x Lobster Tails, 2x (American) Caviar, 2x Lamb, 1x Mashed Potato, 1x Prime Rib, 3x Small FM Skillet, 1x Lobster Ravioli, 2x Lobster Bisque, some King Crab, some Shrimp with cocktail sauce. 

Thinking about it it actually was a bit more than I thought it was. :) Anyway the total was 95$++ so 102$ incl tax plus 15$ tip. Service was nice all around. It was fun to go once and have the experience at least once but I think for that price tag I'd do 2x Bacchanal. 

I don't think it's too expensive though because the items were all well done and high quality. I'd have rated it five stars but the tiny and sparse dessert section was a bit disappointing so it's 4/5. One thing that was a bit off is that they don't enforce a hint of a dress code. If you have waiters in elegant uniforms and pride yourself in serving the best brunch in town then don't let people in muscle shirts (rocker type) come in and ask folks to at least wear a T-shirt/Polo or whatever to look civilized for such a venue.",S0AfO9cVeqkIkFxye61muQ,4,2,4,v06FyJREiI_HZmKxRJmzZg

He even brought up YouTube videos on how properly to eat at this buffet. Yes folks there are tutorials on it. As mentioned in the previous Yelp reviews this brunch is gourmet and features lobster tails, king crab legs, lamb chops, prime rib, sushi, caviar. The mashed potatoes were the best I ever tasted. Our waiter told us they make it with blue cheese.  Another must have is the lobster bisque. Just delicious. The cheese soufflé our waiter brought us courtesy of the chef was wonderful. It had a fruit type sauce over the top of it. The desserts were all elegantly displayed. The fruit torts were excellent but unfortunately didn't have much room for dessert after all the delicious offerings.

1836366,2014-06-30,0,5z1WIr7E9P2CSzyN5seeSA,"My boyfriend and I are aficionados of Sunday bottomless champagne brunches. Being New Yorkers, we feel they are a pleasure and a reward after a sometimes stressful workweek. Since we knew we'd be in Vegas on a Sunday, I did research online and decided upon Bally's. Even though I saw where some reviewers didn't think the brunch wasn't as up to snuff as it had been, we thought we'd give it a go. The minute we stepped up to the reservation desk, we were greeted by a friendly young woman. Then, immediately, the manager appeared and gentlemanly escorted us to our table. Anthony, our server, could not have been more jovial and attentive. We were instantaneously brought champagne. I am used to starting off with a Bloody Mary (being the lush I am), but Anthony informed me that they were not included with the brunch. Nevertheless, I wanted one, and it was one of the finest I've ever had. On to the food: I have never been a big fan of lobster, but it's edible, so I started off with a lobster tail. To me, it was a little on the tough side. However, the prime rib more than compensated for it; indeed, it was the most delicious I've had. The lamb chop was nonpareil, and coupled with the mint jelly, was delightful. We both liked the creamed spinach, and the truffle mashed potatoes were out of this world. You do have to ask for the caviar; one reviewer mentioned you get a miniscule portion, which is not untrue. However, I'm sure if it were dispensed freely on the buffet, there would be those who would be gluttons and put the restaurant out of business. So it's a necessary evil. 
No, it's not a lavish spread, but the selection is more than adequate, and the service impeccable. Moreover, there's not that annoying having to wait in line, and our fellow diners were civilized (meaning not loud). This is more expensive than the other Vegas brunches, but, like they say, you get what you pay for.",xGqfCU5DWFoWo6-MVba1fg,0,1,5,NzHciLVXI0HM6PFJLrJ-zQ
1848456,2017-08-02,6,5z1WIr7E9P2CSzyN5seeSA,"After going twice, I have to say my fiancé and I are definitely fans. My fiancé comes from a family of chefs, so when I say his taste buds are picky... they are as picky as they come. First time we went to Sterling Brunch was back in the beginning for April to celebrate my 30th birthday. Sterling Brunch is definitely one of those places we consider a celebratory dining indulgence; @ $99/person, it's one of those places we only considered coming to for a special occasion. 

Our first experience, we were not prepared at all on how to ""tackle"" the world famous brunch on the strip. We of course made reservations; which are HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. You can walk in if you get there before opening at 930am in hopes to sit at the bar, but this place take reservations as far as 3-6months out. So we knew to make reservations. We were seated right away,  but we were so excited to eat and try everything, after 45mins I was ready to tap out, having only eaten 2 lobsters tails (along with the other bunch options but I was hoping to have eaten more Lobster Tails). 

This second time around, July 30, we were ready to take this brunch on! Secret move we made this time was I grabbed our desserts first, because the Lobster tail is replaced like clockwork, but those humungous chocolate covered strawberries go super quick and are not refilled as quickly as they go. So tip to the wise - grab your dessert delectables first. This time around we were able to stay at the brunch from 930am - 12pm-ish. We took our sweet time, didn't fill our plate every time, eat slow, and really enjoyed every bite we took along with every glass of champagne I downed. 

So details on the food/drink experience: 
First off, you can't go wrong with bottomless champagne or mimosas. And I love the fact that at every table, they pop open a new bottle of champagne, so it really makes it special for celebratory occasions, or even just to make the brunch experience itself special, (second time around we were celebrating our engagement). I even had to cut our server off on refiling my glass of champagne because they will just continue to refill and refill and refill. 

Now the food. O H M Y G O S H!!! Lobster tails are huge and flavorful and cooked to perfection. Shrimps are jumbo peeled with only tail on, Crab legs are steamed with a slight crack to help crack them open. They have a craving station serving prime rib, ham, and rack of lambs. Also served on individual trays are stuffed chicken, filet mignon, and lobster ravioli among other dishes. There is of course an omelette station, along with asparagus, fresh sushi, salads, fresh fruits/yogurt, and silver dollar pancakes and mini Belgium waffles.

Now, ask if i've tried everything.. my answer is no. I cannot tell you how the pancakes were, or if my eggs were cooked to perfection, but what I can tell you is about all the different meats served and all the seafood, included the smoked salmon, fresh sushi, lobster bisque, raw oysters, and of course the reason we come, the lobster tail. Oh, and we are not huge bread eaters when we are out dining... but this place.. TRY THE BREAD PLEASE!! Heaven in my mouth is only way to describe it. Moist soft heaven. 

At basically $100/person, I don't see myself waisting time on food I can munch on anywhere else. Again, the second time around we took our time to really eat what we want and really enjoy ourselves, enjoy the moment and enjoy our food. When people ask us, ""is it really worth it?"" for us it is, and after going twice, I can really vouch for this Vegas Experience and really say if you can afford it... DO IT. We are fans and the experience we've had on both special occasions has been nothing but a delightful experience. 

Our service both times were for the most part spot on, hardly no hiccups, nothing to change our feelings of this place and the experience we get when coming. Although people will look at us crazy that we spend that much per person to eat, we definitely have plans to come back for another big special occasion. I've yet to try the bloody-mary bar, which the bartenders brew up made to order speciality bloody-marys. 

I mean for us, this special has not let us down, so it definitely earned all 5 stars, establishment is fine dining so of course the ambiance is eloquent and very professional and clean and it's definitely worth the try! 

The pictures I took really speak for themselves on the quality of food, and where is definitely more of a Quality over Quantity type place.",nRdfX_I0CaOq7lJunJMPpA,31,12,5,qtcdwF3oCbcjAAS7PF2aGA
1849612,2016-09-13,0,5z1WIr7E9P2CSzyN5seeSA,"This was an amazing experience to say the least. Reading the past reviews on here dating back five years ago, from reading there review and from experiencing first time I can definitely say that it has changed.

First of all expect to eat premium quality seafood:
Giant size Lobster tail cooked, king crab legs, jumbo shrimp, fresh oysters, salmon, and seafood dishes is just the beginning.

The lamb that is cured with chimichurri and cooked to perfection, filet mignon in little cast iron was delicious. Pop over breads warm and fresh. Caviar however you want to eat it. Bottomless champagne, orange juice, and coffee.  They make delicious omelette with lobster fillers, egg benedicts with delicious hollandaise sauce.  Those were just some of the highlights I indulged
in.

We got there at 9:15am and where promptly to sit 9:30am. Yes it's early, but we knew that it was going to be early so we made sure we were ready to eat a brunch that early. After eating three lobster tails, that itself basically paid the meal. I was still hungry, and I tried it all.

The dessert to me was just right, I came for the seafood and the dessert was just a plus.

It was not easy getting in to eat at this place its popularity has grown extensively, but if you are looking for a exclusive early seafood brunch experience with top notch service, then this is a must stop once in a lifetime experience while you are in Vegas.

I would definitely recommend this place! Come hungry and ready to eat!",AJpo0-XaEsISOF2-Kw4Syg,4,2,4,-UYTmD6xBH9nGrSff1DKvg

Then we went to the buffet. It was too short, and everything just seemed bland. The meat was cold, the lobsters rubbery and the sushi seemed old. I was heartbroken. For 100$ a person, you'd think you would get a plethora of fresh seafood and all the trimmings. Sadly, it's not. It's just a status symbol. The bottomless champagne was okay, but couldn't save it.

I got there on time and checked in with the hostess, and she let us know we could wait in the tiny lounge until our table was ready.  It took 45 minutes to get seated, so that was a huge minus.  Once seated, our server was super busy running around, so I really respect his hustle.  He had a lot of tables to work, but still managed to find time to bring us our popovers and espressos.  At the end of our meal, we asked if there was any ice cream in the back, and he managed to round up some mango sorbet.

Now to the meat of the review: the meats.  The best thing about this buffet are all the meat options: lamb, prime rib, bacon slab, crab, lobster, and caviar.  The lamb and prime rib were great, but I really wanted to enjoy the things that differentiate this buffet: the lobster and caviar.  Caviar was good, and the lobster wasn't as terrible as the other reviews said (but wasn't great either).  Oysters weren't good, but it's not oyster season, so I can't completely blame them. The crab legs were horrible.  They were probably frozen.  When you finally got through cracking the rubbery shells, the meat just spilled so much water out when you bit into them.  Overall, for the price you paid, you could've gone to one of the other just as nice buffets (Bellagio, Wicked Spoon, Bachaanal) for almost half the price.

I've always wanted to come to this buffet because I've heard nothing but amazing reviews. My sister and I finally decided to take the plunge and eat here. The buffet is located at the BLT Steahouse inside of the Ballys Hotel. They only do it for Sunday brunch so make reservations early as they do book up fast. The price was about $100 after taxes and all that. It's a really good buffet but I don't think it's worth the price. 

The inside of the restaurant looks like a steakhouse and has that steakhouse feeling. I really like the decor. The buffet option is very limited but everything was really high quality. At the buffet they have oysters, lobster tail (yum!), crab legs, filet mignon, shrimp, lobster ravioli, some veggies and cheese and some brunch items. You can order eggs Benedict from the servers which I highly recommend. There is a choice of a lobster Benedict and a steak Benedict. Get both! It also comes with bottomless champagne. I looked at what kind of champagne they used and googled the price. It's an expensive bottle and it tasted really good! 

The oysters were not the biggest I've had, but were still good. The lobster tails were delicious. Perfectly cooked and really big. And you can have as much as you want! The filet mignon was amazing!!! Perfectly cooked and nicely seasoned. It better be good because it's in a steakhouse! The Benedict's were amazing! They were both very flavorful and is perfect for sharing. The dessert  options are plentiful as well. I'm not a huge dessert person so I didn't really get much, but my sister said it was all good. 

I would recommend coming here at least once in your life. If you love lobster this is the perfect place. It is on the pricey side but it is definitely an experience worth doing once.

Love the menu, it has every grand thing on it!  The caviar is only the black tiny one, sitting in bowls between sushi and berries.  The sushi is the weakest thing among all items, not professionally rolled and have very little choices.  The oysters are the second weak thing, simply not meaty enough.  All the cooked items are excellent, especially the rack of lamb and the prime ribs.  Even the steak or sea bass in the iron skillets are not overcooked, all tender and flavorful!

I made my 12p reservation about a month in advance, then reconfirmed it the morning of brunch (Sunday, 12/23).  When I called, the representative had some difficulty finding it, but eventually did, saying that it was made on the ""old system.""

When we arrived at 11:46am,  it was a madhouse- people everywhere!  We waited in line for the hostess to check in. She seemed flustered and had a thick accent.  She too, seemed to have some difficulty finding the reservation, but said that she had it and that it would be about a 25-30 min wait.  Given the number of people milling about, I wasn't surprised, but a tiny bit annoyed (what's the point of making a reservation, then?). Moreover, the system they used was archaic. They wrote down your name onto a slip of paper, and tried to keep the slips in some semblance of order, but still separating who was using a Groupon from those who were paying full price, so Groupon holders were seated after full-price patrons.  There was a walk-up bar where you could get a free (included) bloody mary, but I didn't want to spoil my appetite. 

After about 40 min, I went to check on our seating status. I noticed our slip on the hostess stand, and she said that there were 3 people ahead of us- noting that the people whose slips were sitting on the stand were next.  I said okay. 4 other parties were seated, and I went back to the stand, noticing that our slip was no longer there. I asked what had happened to it, and she said that the seater must have taken it. I waited, and the seater returned, with no slips in hand. I asked again, what was going on, because our slip that was on the stand and due to be next, was no longer there. The hostess found it- now in the MIDDLE of the pile of slips in her hand- no longer on the stand. I angrily asked what had happened, because 10 min ago, it was on the stand. She initially argued, but saw that I was angry and not to be deterred, so told the seater to go ahead and give us a table. 

After that, I was a bit upset and flustered, but determined not to let it ruin my meal.  The waiter was very charming and never let our Champagne glass get lower than 1/2 full. Fresh squeezed OJ was also served, but in those tiny juice glasses, so we had to ask for refills fairly often. I also got a Sprite.

Now, off to the food.  I sampled almost everything: 3 lobster tails, 2 lamb chops, the salmon/shrimp/crab pastry, red snapper, fillet mignon, made to order lobster omelette,  bacon, mini-quiche, mini-Belgium waffle. My husband also sampled the turkey, potatoes, and prime rib.  I found everything to be pretty tasty, although the lobster could have used some seasoning. I was too full to attempt the steamed shrimp, raw oysters, or caviar. I most enjoyed the omelette and the waffle, and of course the lobster.

For dessert, I had a made to order crepe with bananas, grand marnier, and whipped cream. That was simply delicious!  

All in all, it was a good experience (minus the debacle at the front of the house), so I have no major complaints, but it wasn't all that I'd expected. The selection is definitely better at the Wynn, the M, or Wicked Spoon (for half the cost), and if you are looking for the ambiance PLUS the delicious food experience (at a slightly lower price point, Groupon notwithstanding), I'd suggest the Jazz Brunch at the Country Club at Wynn.  I'm glad I visited the Sterling Brunch, but I won't be a repeat customer.",lQGJcwX105k17081f6pulg,5,0,3,FhYOGrvDJWSJsyt7yC-Rug

2140434,2017-08-27,0,5z1WIr7E9P2CSzyN5seeSA,"Had a great time at the Sterling brunch, located in the BLT steakhouse at Bally's. This brunch is only available on Sundays, and usually requires a reservation. I think this buffet is the most expensive one there is on the Strip, and for good reason. There is unlimited lobster, caviar, Perrier-Jouet champagne, filet mignon, crab legs, and much more.

I have to say that it is way smaller than most buffets that I'm used to, but the quality makes up for the size. Everything is very filling, and I still wasn't able to try a lot of the food there. 

My favorite things were the prime rib, rack of lamb, lobster bisque, caviar and lobster. The filet mignon was super tender and perfectly cooked, but not very flavorful. They had plenty of sauces including a chimichurri sauce, so I was happy with the combo. There was also an omelet bar that had the option to add lobster too! 

Other things I didn't try were sushi, roasted halibut, biscuits and gravy, salad, and most of the desserts. I tried a few tarts and a chocolate lollipop that were just ok, so I didn't really eat much else since I was too stuffed. I really didn't like the oysters, so I'd stay away from those next time. Overall, you'll like this brunch if you're really into the expensive items and not sweating the price. Otherwise, I'd personally prefer more variety for cheaper.",dY6GK465j-kLlrXalgdsNA,7,1,4,meG7d7226p6Ag3Mc5smcxg

1. No signs. No apology when asked why no signs. Walked past it several times.

3. No greeting after being seated. No explanation of the procedure just a waiter pouring champagne. Didn't speak to me or take a drink order for OJ or coffee.
4. Limited food assortment. Maybe 40 feet long. 
5.  Sushi was grocery store quality. 
6. Lobster tails looked good but didn't taste very good.  I only had one even though it's the reason I came there. Lobster omelet was very good but not worth the price.

So we went on a little trip to Vegas. I tried making reservations a week or 2 before and of course since they are only open 1 day a week (Sunday) they book out way in advance. They told me the bar is first come first serve so I decided to take my chances so we walked right up and they had 3 spots available at the bar. Yes it is pricey but you can easily get your $95 worth of food and drinks. If you drink they offer a endless Perrier-Jouët Champagne & mimosas and for the food endless lobster & lamb.

2235584,2011-09-11,2,5z1WIr7E9P2CSzyN5seeSA,"I was there at the Sterling's Sunday Brunch in mid August 2011.  Thought I try out the most expensive buffet in Vegas.  I was quite dissappointed.  First of all, I am a Veteran at the Vegas buffets.  I go to Vegas at least twice a year for the past 15 years and have eaten at every single buffet there is, including, but not limited to, Bellagio, Wynn, Rio, Flamingo, Paris, Planet Hollywood, Caesar's, Mandalay Bay, Mirage, Imperial Palace, Circus Circus, MGM Grand, Treasure Island, Monte Carlo, Harrah's, Stratosphere, M Hotel, Aria, Cosmopolitan, etc...  Therefore, my expectation of the Sterling's Sunday Brunch was extremely high.

When I first walked in, I was very dissappointed with the small spread.  The decor was lacking as well.  Where is the ice sculpture as shown in their website?!?  Their website showed a large spread of food, including crab legs, bread, and an ice sculpture.  The buffet wasn't anything like in the website.

The most dissappointing part was the food.  There were no big Alaskan crab legs at the buffet.  The crab legs at the buffet table were hot, small, and rubbery.  You have to ask for the large ones.  You also have to ask for the caviar.  I found it lame that they would hide the food. 

As for the sushi selection, it was lame.  Again, do I have to ask for the sashimi?  They had cheap items like California roll, etc.

As for the lobster, I had 2 and they were both overly cooked and rubbery.

As for the raw oysters, they only had about 10 at the buffet table and they were constantly running out.

The rack of lamb was tender but wasn't anything special.  The flavor was bland.

There were no giant shrimp coctails at the buffet table.  Maybe, like the crab legs, caviar, and everything else, you have to ask for them.  The service was poor as well.  When I asked for the food, the waiter kept telling me to go to the buffet table.  I had to ask the guy that cut the prime rib for the crab legs and had to ask the lady at the small sushi station for the caviar.

For the price of $85 per person, you can definitely get better food somewhere else like at the Bellagio, Wynn Buffett, Paris, and Planet Hollywood (dinner only since their lunch buffet is not as impressive).  I also liked the buffet at The Cosmopolitan.  ""M"" Hotel has a good buffet as well for the price.",9aMnVxGsX-nTufDWCNvnrA,5,1,1,numbkH-d9uKvIbaSw9RkBA

2291702,2017-06-11,1,5z1WIr7E9P2CSzyN5seeSA,"Remember rule #1: don't talk about the fight club and NEVER (as my wife discovered) call Sterling a buffet. It's a brunch (as quoted by Bally staffers)! With that established on with the show.

With a heavy heart after my experience here I can't score this one any higher than I have as overall there were faux pas all over the place and especially for this being so iconic you'd think my 2 star rating would be ironic, but yeah no irony here folks.

The first pain point was apparently the misrepresentation of price. Now let me start by saying I did the research and expected $90 ($85 if you're a total reward member) and was even told that upon confirming my reservation on the phone the night before, but to the shock of my wife and I it was an extra $10. Now granted we did go on Mother's Day, but the pricing was nowhere clearly displayed and tickle me pink if that just doesn't like a shady practice. The experience was far below that price tag and it was my birthday gift on top of it and I left in tears. I mean it was my birthday so I could cry if I wanted to (you would cry too if it happened to you). Old school song reference I'm sure most won't get, BUT moving on!

The food itself was honestly hit or miss. The stations themselves were small in stature, but did have its highlights in all fairness. In an effort to feel bourgeois I sampled the American Sturgeon Caviar and I'll just leave that one to society's elite. To me it came off with a very salty after taste, but from googling it apparently that's how this particular one is supposed to be and if that's the case count me out! The famed lobster tails to me were another excitement fallen flat. They are housed in a larger serving dish and honestly had a mass produced feeling to me. They tasted far from fresh and some were rubbery yet others were charmin soft, MASSIVE let down! On a bright note, I LOVED the filet mignon. I had helping after helping of this and became my go-to of the day. The meat was pull away tender and had a hint of garlic butter smothered into each bite which was tres magnifique! Another highlight (which proves how bad my experience is) was their Greek yogurt parfait. I even said to my wife, spent all that money and liked a parfait of all things. The yogurt itself did not have that tartness that Greek yogurt seems to have which was refreshing and the granola partnered with the berries at least brought my smile back to the meal.

As you can see there many pictures taken and food not mentioned in my review, but to sum it up 1000 words would not be enough. Was it nice to experience? Yes to eliminate it from the Vegas bucket list. Will I make a return visit? Well Mr. Sterling would need to do quite a bit before that happens and I don't see that in the cards!",o0TZ2hroc7DK6CM73ll-1g,2,0,2,30DLWEnuPJ_HfoTETs8Clg

2323854,2012-03-02,0,5z1WIr7E9P2CSzyN5seeSA,"If you ever come up big at the craps table, and feelin like you could afford a $100 meal, just stick with the nice steak houses or sushi spots.  You don't need to waste it on Sterlings.  At what's raved as the best buffet on the strip, its probably more like best wasted money on the strip.  For $60 at the Wynn buffet and the rest on black may offer you a higher return.

I mean its hard to justify a $95 bill.  btw, its $95 regular, but if you have a Total Rewards Card, you get a discount starting at $85 so GET IT if you choose to come here.  But then there are 4 things that you can appreciate by dining here.  

1.  The service.  The gentlemen tell great stories and provide excellent service.  They'll even talk about the different celebrities that have made there way into the restaurant and who is approachable and who just prefers to be left alone.  They can even get your food for you if you wish.  
2.  The place has that old style baller status feel.  If you've gone to the old timer steakhouses with the stripe walls and brown booths, you'll know what I'm talking about.  It's like you could picture the 1920s mafia and gangsters just smoking their cigars chilling.
3.  The caviar.  Sturgeon Caviar at a buffet?  Unheard of.  But get as much as you can (the lady limit me at my 3rd approach) and just smear that goodness on everything you see on our plate.
4.  The champagne.  Pierrer Jouet or Moet is not  your typical Korbel or cheapo champagne.  And the best part is....they'll constantly fill it up if you're the thirsty type.


That's it.  Those four things are the only things I enjoyed and perhaps tried my best to make good of that money spent.  Other than that, everything else sucked.  -Crab claws - not fresh, small, hard to open, barely any
-Oyster - tiny, but edible
-Crab cake - too filling and nothing special
-Lobster Tail - yes, the first 2 were good, but then you get sick of it and it's just a pain to try and eat more.
-Prime rib - ironically as a steakhouse, this piece of sad dried up London Broil looking thing even looked depressing.  I had a small bite, and regretted it.
-Lamb Rack - If only you could just eat the rare part and discard the rest because everything else around that was over salted and too fatty.
-Tiger jumbo shrimp - too much isn't good for you.
-Sushi - what was I thinking.

So there are a ton of bad stuff, but if you focus on the good, maybe you can see it being worth it.  But for the variety and somewhat upscale buffet, I'm glad I tried it.",K0zrsXqu55JPwT4dnvNUDg,1,0,3,9FK6PVRzzgopc2dcQZ-9gw

Champagne is available while you wait and, with reservations, the wait isn't long. Soon enough you'll be escorted into the dining room. From that point on, your champagne glass won't dip below a sip or two without the ace crack staff refilling it (what else to do in Vega$ but get loaded on a Sunday morning?!?).

2420461,2018-03-05,1,5z1WIr7E9P2CSzyN5seeSA,"I'm sad to say I was actually thoroughly disappointed with the quality of the food here.

I book a reservation for 4 of my friends 2 months in advanced as we were extremely excited to try this place. The hype was real man! The buffet is location inside the BLT steakhouse and all the staff and servers are pleasantly nice constantly checking in to refill our champagne (perrier jouet) and take our plates and empty our shell bowl.

The huge downfall though is the food quality. Sadly for $135 a person (tax and 18% tip we included) it just didn't feel like we were getting our moneys worth. The gratuity is definitely deserved of course, but the price of the buffet 95 each just didn't feel like it. 

The lobster was very bland tasting and what really made me feel a little sad was the texture: it was overcooked and had a rubbery tough and dry texture. The steak was also a little too tough and flavorless as well, and the crab legs were mediocre. I actually went a week prior to M resort buffet and probably would have to say the taste of their crab legs were better sadly since the sterling brunch's crab had a little fishiness to it.

The lamb was not bad and cooked nicely (medium rare), while the chicken and salmon were also dry and a little bland just like the lobster. One thing I did enjoy though was the lobster omelet, the flavor was nice and the omelet was fluffy with goat cheese and cooked veggies. It probably tasted best since it was made to order. 

I honestly wouldn't think I would pay more than 40 bucks for this buffet and I tried to get my value in champagne (my plan B) since we didn't really enjoy much of the food. I guess my biggest disappointment was the lobster though as previously mentioned. I was just really excited at the idea of an unlimited lobster meal, but I couldn't eat more than just 1 or 2 tails shared since it just didn't taste that good at all..

I probably wouldn't ever come back here again but I suppose it's cool to try if you've never been? I really wish I could have said I liked this place but I just can't come to terms with how terrible the food was for what you're paying.",oJV6f25IK_UeghoFmalPvA,9,1,3,l_3yZIdE7eKUR_j6ASp7ZA

It was so bad that when I stuck my fork in it,  the lobster broke up into pieces like it was powder.  Now think about it, overcooked lobster should be super rubbery not soft and broken up.   This was not overcooked.  The lobster had probably gone bad before  they cooked it which is severely bad food handling for it to crumble like powder when I tried to eat it.  Management you should look into this.  I was there today 11/27 with a reservation at 9:30 and it was a pretty shifty experience when I paid $250 ($50 tip since it isn't the fault of my waiters).

Ambiance is also old school classy, but could use some updating (but remember, you're really only here for 3 things). ;) I'm also a big steak person, but was not impressed by the filet at all. It was nice that they had hot king crab legs as most places serve cold. If you're looking for a buffet with inventive/trendy food, huge variety, and contemporary decor, this is not your place. BUT... if you're looking to stuff yourself silly on champagne, caviar, and lobster...you've just died & gone to heaven! LOBSTER CAVEAT: some ppl have critiqued the lobster as being rubbery, but I did not find this to be the case. It might not be the absolute best lobster you've ever had in your life (after all, it IS a buffet and it's not like it's live Maine lobster), but it was pretty darned good! The only downside to AYCE Maine lobster (as if there could be) is that by lobster #4 or 5, it starts to lose it's luster...I know, call me crazy. I guess the curse of having too much of a good thing!

I specifically left $0 tip on the bill to make a statement and they have the nerve to charge me a tip?!?! I will definitely make sure everyone knows my disgust with this place.

I was looking forward to this place. Vegas local and have been to just about every high end buffet there is and this was on my to do list and boy was I disappointed

Service
Was just horrible, our waiter spent a lot of time talking to two girls the entire time we were there. They got great service, our party, not so much. It was very frustrating to have to ask for things multiple times as was the case, I really expected much more from this place.

Food
The selection is small. I do prefer quality over quantity but this place disappointed on both counts. The rack of lamb was excellent and the mint jelly was probably the best I ever had but the rest just sucked. The lobster tails were soggy as were the crab legs. The French toast bread putting just sucked and the shrimp were awful. Overall was not good.

Value
I don't mind paying good money for a good meal but this was just horrific, Caesars, Bellagio, and Wynn Brunch are so much better and cheaper.

People seem to like this place, maybe I just got a bad server combined with a bad sampling of food but definitely not going to give it a second tru to find out.",_91FxFZYTaUGVIEnQhB5cw,12,2,1,lpsm1bN8fUiLAyV7eE1xLQ

2595912,2014-10-12,0,5z1WIr7E9P2CSzyN5seeSA,"A bit overpriced ($90 / $85 with the Total Rewards card); and not a good return on that money.  We were here on 09/28/14 Sunday with a 12pm reservation.

First of all, if you still decide to go, make your reservations for the earlier times (9:30am to 12pm), as they do tend to run out of the better things after 12pm.  You can sign up for the free Total Reward card at the Bally's hotel, where the buffet is at; located at the same BLT Steak restaurant; which turns into the steakhouse in the evenings.

The Pros:
AYCE lobster, lamb chops, caviar, champagne, & king crab legs, and they give you a Popover at the beginning of the meal (but they ran out of them at around 1:30pm)

The Cons:
The lobster was a bit tough; and after around 1pm, instead of a whole lobster tail, they started putting out a half tail.  When we arrived at 12pm, we heard they had run out of oysters already.  The filet Mignon was just a small piece of meat in a small pan, not very tasty, actually kind of bland.  The nigiri sushi didn't look fresh; Genki sushi tasted better.  Lobster bisque (which you have to order from the waiter) was bland.  The service was also lacking; as our waiter catered to a certain table of 6, and pretty much ignored us.

Overall; it's a quantity over quality.  We came for the AYCE lobster , filet Mignon, and crab, and the pictures here did look great.  But it was a disappointment.  For your money, find another buffet.  :(",REkqzfacqtEHoCOzWDEKGw,5,1,2,RPmxHAqevDFUBd4nJ1ePFQ

Looking back, I wish I hadn't reviewed this fantabulous place earlier, because it would have been perfect for a Century slot a special place that has retained its glory since before I moved here. 

Before joining Yelp, I had never heard of Groupons, but was thrilled to learn that basically a ""2 for 1"" offer was available; so I purchased it.  My last visit earlier summer '12 had wowed my guests from Hawaii as we celebrated a friend making Full Bird Col in the AF. Over the years I've gone with family, dates, friends...and only in June was I slightly disappointed by a few items. Recently, reading reviews from fellow Yelpers about hours of waiting, stale food, lack of service, I was concerned. Could there have been such a radical downfall in such a short period of time? I cannot compare SB to other buffets for two reasons: I've only been to Yelp's Bacchanal event and a soft opening of Red Rock's; I avoid them because of phobias
(sneeze guards; gluttony; and generally poor manners to reach less than worthy food.) 

When I called to make my reservation, I was relieved to hear that because of the onslaught of Groupon users, the initial December cut-off was pushed to early January. We arrived just ahead of our noon reservations to no wait, a smiling hostess and an immediate offer of Perrier Jouet champagne. We were guided to a table in the main dining room and met our very charming server, Javier. 

I'd breathed a quick sigh of relief as this was the SB I was so familiar with and upon inspecting and choosing our first dishes, this was reinforced.  Even as a pescetarian (except for holiday charcuterie) I've always found that the lobster, crab, caviar, cheeses, sushi and sashimi, soups, other fish dishes, delightful desserts, endless superior PJ bubbly/Bloody Mary's always made the full price worth entry. On this occasion, again I agreed wholeheartedly. 

* Please note: this was for a January '13 meal, my understanding is SB could be no more :( Hope that is not the case *",eZfHm0qI8A_HfvXScwIYsg,12,9,5,muNtI9ld6VW4r4Qf1Ke1Nw

As many have pointed out, it is all buffet style, so the freshness and wow factor just wasnt there for me.

My favorite brunch of all time was the brunch at The Steakhouse in Circus Circus...so perhaps I had an unfair bias going in. What I really liked about the CC brunch was that everything was made to order, like filet, eggs benedict, etc. Something just seems to get lost when it gets made in batches and sits in a heating table. I really wish they would re-open that brunch :(

The Lobster was just very mediocre, the filets were overdone, the eggs benedict was not too bad, but still a little dry from sitting in the heating table. The crab legs were very good, but wish they would take the extra step and either cut them open for you or provide the scissors because the shells were a little soft and hard to open with just a cracker.

The desserts were just ok to me, nothing special.

I think the saving grace was that the champagne was flowing (although not as fast as I would have liked) and it is a $40-50 champagne...that is the only reason I would say that the $85 price tag isnt completely out of line.

Overall, the food quality was average and not worth the $$$, but if you like a lot of good champagne and dont mind average quality food, it is worth it.",reSiLbRNq_kCVD5RGI780Q,1,0,3,eTxIVP1YIrl9421dVa6J0g

He was like, ""Dude, they have caviar and lobster tails."" 
""Word?"" 
""Yeah.""

The Sterling Brunch is located at BLT Steak in the Bally's hotel, so don't go looking for a restaurant called ""Sterling Brunch"" like I did.  Also, make a reservation because it gets completely booked and is only available on Sundays (I believe).  Anyways, who doesn't like champagne and caviar?  The best part is that it is UNLIMITED.  The caviar isn't of the highest quality, but what do you really expect if it's unlimited?  I used it as a condiment more than anything.  Also, our server was topping us off throughout our meal.  My glass was never empty.  They also just launched their Bloody Mary bar (unlimited)!  It was kind of a pain though because there wasn't always a bartender available.  I'll let it slide since it was their first time, but appreciated that they had an array of toppings like pepperoni, salami, bacon, carrots, and etc.  They offered premium seafood options like beautifully prepared lobster tails, stone crab, king crab, and poached jumbo prawns.  YAAAAAS!  They offer eggs benedict to order.  Top that bish off with some more caviar.

My only complaint is that their options (buffet-wise) is somewhat limited compared to other buffets available in Vegas.  Dessert was alright, but the $95 price tag for everything else was well worth it.  Get down with your bad and boujee self.",gJTknzE8KYeqGwYLif42CQ,13,7,4,Ws_OC9cVoxSzupiBAPCcaA

I also tried two omelets which rate high as the best omelets I've ever eaten and I don't even like an omelette. The three big issues for me are value (not for what you get but for what you really need), service (not as sharp as I'd have thought and our waiter seemed less than engaged surprisingly) and ambiance (that old Vegas style restaurant with no natural light of any kind and honestly it's still just a buffet). 

My personal opinion is that once you surpass a certain price point buffets really are silly. Our meals with tax costs us $97 per person!! Plus tip. All that spent and I still have to serve myself from the buffet. How does this make sense? Unless you are so greedy that you will honestly eat a couple lobster tails, five filet mignonette, etc how is there value here?

I went to Morels and had a memorable meal with amazing service and alcohol and I spent the same as we did on a buffet where you serve yourself. Maybe I'm a snob but for $200 plus tip I'd rather have one amazing plate instead of piling my plate high with filet mignon. If you can afford $97 for brunch per person I'm assuming you've eaten pretty well and a lobster tail is not going to impress you (I can get that at Red Lobster).

I hated the ambiance. I like old Vegas and respect it as a local, raised in Vegas. But no light and just a depressing decor is not what I want for a relaxing brunch.

At $85 a person I was expecting EVERYTHING to be damn delicious, especially since their food selection wasn't massive. I don't mind if there are fewer choices but PLEASE, make it good! This just wasn't the case. 

Problems: 

-The eggs benedict was not served right. The tray they kept it in was very warm and probably continued to cook the eggs until basically it tasted and had the consistency of hard boiled eggs. Eggs benedict is nothing without the runny yolk. 
-The lobster bisque was not good; it didn't have a strong lobster taste at all. If the ""lobster bisque"" name card wasn't there, I wouldn't have known what the heck it was. It's also served in a tall cylinder and they don't provide a place to put the lid. The soup handle was also steaming hot and burned my hand! :( 
-I've had comparable or better lamb with less fat on it. 
-After I took a bite out of my steak, I asked my bf where the filet mignon was. He said, ""you're eating it"". Need I say more?
-Maybe this is my problem but what's the big deal about the caviar? It tastes like tiny salty balls. I didn't experience any other flavors. I guess I just don't know how to eat it... If you're like me and not really used to caver, I'm pretty sure you won't be falling out of your seat with that ""OMG this is delicious"" feeling either. 
-The orange juice was served in the smallest cups I've never used while dining out so obviously one gulp and it was done. Our server was not as fast on refilling as some other yelpers experienced. We had to remind him a couple of times. 

Highlights: 

-Obviously the unlimited lobster had to be one of them. They were served as halves with hot butter. I'm not normally head over heels about lobster but the ones here were very flavorful and soft. Definitely the best ones I've had! However, my bf wished the meat was a little more firm. He's the lobster lover and this brunch was more for him. Sorry hun! 
-Very fresh oysters and crab! Not for one moment did I question if I'd get sick like I do at Rio's seafood buffet. :P 
-The desserts were as beautiful as they were delicious! SOO many times it happens that buffets have very pretty desserts so you load up a big plate, only to be extremely disappointed! At Sterling, almost every dessert I tried was great. I mistakenly picked up the lemon meringue tart (not a fan) but it was delicious! Fluffy, airy meringue and there was a sweet lemon flavor that didn't overpower the tart at all. You could taste the attention that went into it and all the layers of the tart. 

The only dessert  that I didn't like was the chocolate dipped strawberry covered in pistachios. The nuts weren't as crunchy as fresh ones would be, way more chewy than expected. The chocolate could have been better quality too.

Would I come back? For this price, I think I'd rather go to a fancy restaurant than to a fancy buffet.",WWP06D5BncW30kSOkOC6WA,3,1,3,58Cm3XxuwmSCoKGQJXitNA

They quickly converted the table to a round 5 top and added a chair for our daughter. 

Service was attentive and plentiful. It was never overbearing, but always available when we needed something and they were quick to refill champagne glasses.

The buffet was perfectly proportioned with cold items, salads, soup, fruit, and the hot items. Every dish felt perfectly picked and aligned to create a wonderful menu. The boiled shrimp and raw oysters were accompanied by ingredients to mix your own cocktail sauce. The caviar is served as a plentiful portion with blinis, garnishes, and creme fraiche. My fiance had commented earlier that was all prime ribbed out, but said that his slice was the best he had had in Vegas. The lamb chops were cooked to perfection and very tasty. Pan fried soft shell crab was unexpected, but welcome. The lobster was actually the first well-cooked lobster I have had. It actually made me like lobster.

I haven't been to a Sunday Champagne Brunch for many many years and after a few quick research, Sterling Brunch in Bally's seems to stand out from among many other choices, so there I went with an empty stomach waiting to be filled!

The brunch is stagged in a steakhouse and seating was overflowed to the Italian restaurant next door due to its popularity.  Personally I think Bally's ought to host the brunch in the theatre (as was like Caesars in the past) so customers don't have to pick up the food from the steakhouse and walk around with a plate full of food from the steakhouse and into the Italian restaurant.  Fortunately we were seated inside the steakhouse and avoided the hassle and embrassement from other patrons waiting at the lobby drooling over our plates of food.

Service was indeed excellent.  The server was not at all stingy in topping out our glass with champagne and promptly removing any empty plates.

Lots of upscale cold and hot food selection (including stone crab claws, raw oysters, smoke salmon, lobsters, caviar, sushi, etc...) However, they do ""hide"" the caviar behind the sushi counter so you have to ask the server for it as with the sushi.  

I tried to taste a little bit of everything but still I was too stuffed at the end to try out all the desserts!

It's pricey but I'd still recommend it.

They give you bottomless champagne (a pretty decent one imo) I forgot the name of. You can order some things directly, all included in the price, such as lobster eggs bennedict or a regular one. The buffet itself has about 25 items, mainly seafood (lobster tails, king crab, oyster) and meats (filet mignon - medium rare amazingness it was truly $$$$ worthy, AMAZINGLY soft and tender bacon, lamb and prime rib which i did not try) As this place is located inside BLT Steak, a well known expensive steakhouse I would expect the taste to be out of this world and it truly was.

The reason I dock a star is because 90$ I think is still too steep when you have 55$ at Caesar's which is a close second when it comes to quality but obviously no lobster tails, filet mignons, etc) but their variety is literally 3-4x. Sterling dessert though is also comparable to a pretty amazing college dining hall dessert experience. So while it is pretty great in terms of the small bites, Caesar's is just so much better and much more variety. For example there is no ice cream or gelato here, and even a dining hall would have that...Anyhow I still would recommend for you to try it once just to see what the fuss is about, but in the future probably stick to Caesars.",WIFb-G9x9Z7uTF7hi-qQJw,10,3,4,WMSWkvOZVtqs9dcG6NI2xw

I didn't have that ""gee, I totally missed that section"" regret. It's not a large buffet actually but I actually did over hear people saying they didn't notice certain sections. 
The food was wonderful, they had selections like caviar and lobster which you don't find at buffets like Bellagio or Wynn. To be honest though it wasn't the food that blew me away, it was the service and the constant flow of champagne that won me over :-) To be honest I didn't expect to get ""buzzed"" so early in the morning but those servers are like ninjas when it came to keeping my glass topped! At the end of the gluttonous extravaganza I walked out feeling full, giddy and very loved when the host went out of his way to make sure I walked out with a lovely rose :-) I will return...but next time I will keep a eye on my glass and not let myself get too giddy that early on a sunday ;-)",Bj_MarPEKBe2xN12YimekQ,5,5,4,ts9gSpYIvWQeBTx686eHmA
2885526,2015-04-15,3,5z1WIr7E9P2CSzyN5seeSA,"I heard this was the best brunch in town, so made reservations. The day I went, I went to Bally's and thought I showed up to the wrong hotel because there is no signs for it, even the people at the front of the hotel acted confused about its existence. I believed this too because, let's be honest, Bally's is an incredible ugly hotel from the outside. It was plausible such a fine buffet would not be located in such a crap looking hotel. I finally figured out it's at the BLT Steakhouse inside there.

It's a very expensive buffet, but I'm a big eater, so I got my money's worth. The all you can eat lobster tails made it worth the admission alone. These were not little slipper lobster tails, but actual proper lobster tails. Pro tip, take the lobster meat and put it inside the bisque.

They actually have a caviar service there with what appears to be proper sturgeon caviar along with the accoutrements (blini, creme fraiche, chopped up egg whites/yolks, etc). But the real fun part is seeing what caviar will work with other than the traditional way, which is seldom an option in life. Caviar on top of lobster? Caviar on top of prime rib? Caviar on top of some macaroons? Why not!

The jumbo shrimp served were unusually good quality for a buffet, not the normal mushy shrimp you find at lesser buffets. 

An impressive antipasto section. Lots of ways to customize food with various sauces.

For the beef and lamb lovers, they have you covered too with very high quality cuts.

Their sushi selection I would say is a disappointment. It seemed rather sloppily presented and not that interesting. But there is a million all you can eat sushi joints these days, so really I wasn't there for the sushi anyway.

Likewise, the dessert selection was only okay. There could have been more selection and interest there. There wasn't even ice cream or gelato. So if you're big on dessert for your buffet, you might be put out.

But if you want to eat a lot of top notch proteins, you will be a happy glutton.",u_RB8njILJomIeEZ1QJXvQ,9,2,4,RTVfEIEiP-blE6k6sGP5Ng

I had of course, the lobster tails ( wont say how many i had, but lets leave it at ALOT) fillet Mignon, the lamb chops, the eggs Benedict, well everything was amazing. They also had an omelet station with their specialty lobster and cognac omelet. Anyways, i was in heaven. I'm super picky when it comes to buffet and this is the best one ever.

But those were the only things that remained from the old beloved Sterling Brunch that I've been coming to and raving about for the past 7 years!  I've brought my mom and her friends, all are TR Diamond and 7Stars members, everytime we go to Vegas (which is way too often!).  They have enjoyed it so much, they've been bring their friends and family.  This time I brought a colleague and friend and the experience was hugely embarassing!  Just about all the seafood was oversalted (from lobster bisque to crab legs) and all the meats were way over cooked.  The lobster tails were 1/3 the size they used to be, and overcooked, dry and salty.  The crab ""legs"" were more like left over scraps from the spread of the old Sterling.  The ""chilean"" sea bass was dry and salty.  The Filet mignon was so overdone it's inedible.  The lamb chops were completely brown and tough.  There was no sushi.  No duck.  Desserts selections were also pathetic.  No crepe station.  No ice cream. No creme brule.  Overall there were only 1/2 the selections of food and at 1/4 of the quality.

2980038,2016-10-10,1,5z1WIr7E9P2CSzyN5seeSA,"A hidden gem, that I hope stays low-key. $95/person, 11AM-2:30PM, no time-limit. 

We called in at 11AM to find out that they were fully reserved for the day, however, the lady told us that the bar was first come, first serve seating and that you could just dine there. We packed up all our stuff and rushed over; luckily there were plenty of spaces available. Located inside the BLT Steak restaurant in the Bally's hotel which is tucked in the corner next to the SEA Thai restaurant.

Now, to explain why it's so damn expensive. 
1. Unlimited caviar, 2. Unlimited lobster tails, 3. Bottomless Champagne (Perrier Jouet, they are not skimping!) 

And that's just the beginning. The quality of all the food was impeccable. The lobster tails were huge and tender, and they managed to keep them constantly coming. Proteins, they had lamb chops, prime rib, filet mignon, bacon, prepared perfectly. For seafood, they featured jumbo shrimp cocktail, oysters, Alaska king crab legs, sushi, super fresh. I've only had caviar one time before, so I made sure to put it on everything I ate. 

For desserts, mini dessert pastries, chocolate-covered strawberries, and a bread pudding french toast. All delicious, great finish to the meal. 

We sat at the bar and service was amazing the entire time. Dishes were cleared out in a timely fashion, our champagne glasses were never empty. The best part about sitting at the bar, I got to watch Sunday football! 

TIPS: Make reservations in advance, although the restaurant was never full the entire time we were there or you can test your luck with the bar seating.

They have a pretty hard set end time of 2:30pm, so I'd suggest arriving earlier so you don't feel rushed. We were way too stuffed afterward, and we didn't even get to try popovers, eggs benedict. omelets or lobster bisque. Looks like their menu changes from time to time so excited to see what else they have in store. Will definitely be back again!",r5GARC8nZaJQYzsmx9MVEA,14,4,5,mdmTJngwepP7R6vAOC6tUQ

3011928,2018-05-29,2,5z1WIr7E9P2CSzyN5seeSA,"So I've been stalking the reviews for this brunch for a couple months now. I don't think your normal Vegas buffet goer here's much about this place due to the exclusivity and price point of this buffet. First off, it's only open on Sundays for brunch / lunch. You should probably book a reservation in advance, but there are opportunities to wait in line and see if you can get seated. It's located inside the BLT steak house inside of Bally's so it has normal dining room seating and bar seating. Your best bet, if you don't have a reservation, is to wait in line then sprint to the bar area ha. The couple next to us said they had to adjust their Vegas trip date so they didn't have a reservation and so they got there 2 hours early. WOW, that's some dedication.

Service, similar to a steakhouse, you are going to get pretty good service. Our server was good, and kept the champagne flowing. Pierre Jouet. I am not much of a champagne drinker, but sounds like most people love it.

A more in depth listing of foods I tried on this visit:

Above average
Lobster - hugeeeeeee juicy lobsters, very good, I only ate 2 though

King Crab legs - probably the best thing at the buffet. They were decent size, but damn I am too lazy to crack them. If they were cracked, I would have eaten another pound probably

Lobster ravioli - a nice sauce and lobster oozing ravioli

Potato dishes - they have two, both are very cream and delicious

Lobster bique - also very rich and creamy, wish they could do a spin on it with a lot of lobster chunks in there, that's ok though, you can add your own!!

Popvers - i think it's like a gruyere brioche. Really good, but don't fill up on this. If this were like a menu item at a breakfast place I would eat this as my meal.

Average

Sushi, salad, and desserts. Nothing to write home about. I would probably steer clear of these fillers. 

Since I am the number one value reviewer in the game, it's hard to wrap your head around a $100+ buffet. If you are so so eater, if you don't love seafood, I wouldn't come here. If you dine at steakhouses or seafood places regularly and want to eat til you throw up, I would come here!",BeWDEj2Lj9L31HtFfZGn1w,7,4,4,AdtcK2Y6lesXLJhYPXDhMg

3021432,2009-01-05,12,5z1WIr7E9P2CSzyN5seeSA,"Holy Jesus, Mary, and Joseph:  This is the single greatest buffet... ever.  Of course the value of the $85/person price tag is going to be tied to how much you eat and whether your reeeeeallly like seafood, but if you're like me...

BTW:  I decided to write this review anecdotally, so forgive my indulgence.  Let's start with the fact that the world's greatest buffet is at Ballys.

BALLYS?:
Yes, I know it's at Bally's which makes this whole experience a bit out of place.  No matter - when we approached the restaurant, things got quieter and the atmosphere began to change, starting with the patron's apparel.  Around the restaurant, people were suddenly wearing golfing outfits, collared shirts, and pleated well-pressed pants.  It reminded me of the oasis that is the Steakhouse at Circus Circus. 

When we walked in, we were immediately served champagne.  This usually rings hollow to most foodies being that the champagne is usually two-buck-chuck... but this was Perrier Jouet!  Hell - my wife and I drank this after I'd proposed to her.

As we were seated, we were offered beverages other than our delicious champagne.  Coffee & Orange Juice please.  A glass & a cup appeared and lo-and-behold. the OJ was FRESH SQUEEZED and the coffee was smooooooooth - not at all sour or bitter.  Things were lookin' awesome. 

THE BUFFET:
I know what you're thinking.  And you're right.  I hate buffets.  I've been to the Bellagio Buffet, the Le Village Buffet, the Wynn Buffet, the Rio Seafood Buffet, blah blah blah.  I've got news for you.  They're all marginal-to-moderately good.  (although the Rio's gone into the toilet over the past few years)  The other three are okay and have their strengths.  They have reasonable quality and you're not going to get sick at any of them but you're not going to come away with an OMG-thatwassogood reaction. 

This was completely different:  None of the aforementioned buffets even comes close to the Sterling Brunch - it's simply in a class of it's own.  The buffet literally glows under the warm incandescent lamps above.  Here's a list of the things that I sampled from this embarrassment of riches that laid before me. 

- Hot gourmet-prepared Lobsters 
- Caviar with toast, blini, crème fraîche, onions, egg crumbles, & chives 
- Steamed Alaskan King Crab legs 
- Prime Rib with Au Jus & 3 different types of horseradish 
- Rack of Lamb with Mint Jelly 
- Extremely fresh fruit on ice including watermelon, strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, and various melon slices 
- Huge shrimp... I mean really large prawns... with cocktail sauce 
- Shucked oysters on ice 
- Omelets ready-to-order with sausage, mushrooms, green onions, and a variety of other ingredients 
- Sushi of all sorts (Didn't eat any of this) 
- Lox & Bagels (Didn't eat any of this either) 
...and a lot more that I didn't look at.  Here's the menu if you want to see it:
http://www.harrahs.com/images/Property/blv/dining/BLV_SterlingBrunch_Menu.pdf

Normally, at a buffet - the shrimp are some of the first things you 'hit'.  In this case, they were the absolute LAST things we tried.  No joke.  I mean, heck - we figured, you can get shrimp anywhere. 

Understand, it was really hard not to just 'pig out'.  What with all the champagne being poured and fresh coffee being decanted, and the bottomless glass of fresh squeezed, sweet orange juice that I was being spoiled with, I really couldn't tell you what I was doing other than stuffing my face and pretending I was a Roman Emperor.  One thing I can recommend is for everyone to be selective about what you get.  It'll be there later when you want to try it - they don't run out. 

In all seriousness, any one of these buffet items would have been worthy of a delicious paid for meal in-of-itself.  I told my wife that I could sit and gorge myself on the lobster alone it was sooooo sweet, soft, hot, and did I mention they had an endless supply of melted butter to go with the endless supply of lobster? 

But no, the thing that I spent the most time with was the caviar.  I love caviar.  

(I had so much to write about my first experience at the Sterling Brunch that it exceeded the 5000 char limit of Yelp.  I ended up writing a blog post about this, the environment, the desserts, and a little more about the caviar, so if you're interested in reading more:

CONCLUSION:
I think it's safe to say that this will forever be on my list of places to go in Vegas from here on out.  It's only available on Sundays, but I think it will be well worth it to ""stick around"" on Sundays to go to the brunch before heading to the airport.

We have been coming to The Sterling Brunch for at least 13 years now, but I am sad to say this last visit will be our last visit.
In the early days this was a luxurious experience, great food, waiters and staff that made you feel special, a beautiful intimate dining room, I felt like I had a very special brunch secret.
Flash forward to 2018, There was a line at the hostess stand ( no more elegant maitre d) we were told to wait in the lounge, no offer of champagne was made. When we were seated the waiter brought us in his words ""some lousy popovers"" I thought I must have misunderstood but I heard him tell several other tables the same thing, and why would I have overheard this, because the tables are so close together. On the way out you use to be given a beautiful rose, the roses are still there but now it is help yourself, wow, that really made me feel special.
Yes the food is still good and abundant, but I can get good food almost anywhere, what made the Sterling Brunch special is gone, as I told my coworker "" it is now very pedestrian"", and if I wanted that I can get it for a lot less than $110.00 per person.

Sterling Brunch has amazing service.  The moment we came to check in, the host brought out Perrier Jouet champagne while we waited for the rest of our party to arrive.

The service is impeccable.  You don't even notice them picking up your plates when they're complete.  You won't be able to keep count how many glasses of champagne because they keep toppen it off.  Maybe even look into booking a room or have a DD ready if you plan to drink properly.

Onto the food - defniitely stay away from the greens and the carb's until you've loaded up on seafood and meats.   I enjoyed the belgiam waffles with fresh rasberry sauce but that wasn't until plate 5 or 6.....

For the seafood and meats -- I wish they could serve more rare choices of meats but it was still delish.  The lobster was cooked well but thought it could use a little seasoning.  Still - lobster tails AYCE is INSANITY.  There is a plethora of raw oysters, shrimp cocktail, king crab legs,  snow crab claws, sushi/sashimi, and CAVIAR.

The coffee was Starbucks which is not my favorite. 
 Service was not good.  The waiter seated us left and seated others we had to wait and wait to get water, champagne  and even longer for coffee. Its all Las Vegas Hype.   I would never go back again.  We had a better meal at he Gordon Ramsey restaurant at Paris.

The unlimited champagne was great, and I totally feel that I got what I paid for.  They serve lobster tail, king crab legs, lamb, oyster, pre-cracked stone crab claws (which is my favorite there), and caviar.  I didn't see the caviar on any food station, but our server just brought it to our table when I asked him.  They also have a pretty decent selection of dessert with fresh made-to-order crepe.  Their only kind of ice cream - vanilla ice cream - is so yummy, and they make it in house with real fresh vanilla bean according to the server at the dessert station.  

However, I am really not into their signature dish - lobster tail.  They were over cooked and too dry.  The lamb was nothing special, and it was also over-cooked for me.  I didn't even get close to their sushi station because the sushi there didn't look fresh at all.  I guess in the end, it is still a buffet even though the final bill ended up to be $110 per person.  One time experience here is probably good enough for me.",qgmxeYW89HUtXtlIRuhwcg,2,1,3,YTNdhkO-lQQJPsGnk_gJxQ

Hoping for a positive experience since we had such a negative one the previous day at Gordon Ramsay Steak.  Anyways, this brunch takes the cake.  I honestly didn't feel like there was anything missing except maybe the décor.  I had lobster, king crab (yes, king crab, not the usual snow crab at most brunches), lamb chops, fresh water eel, lobster ravioli, and plenty of champagne.

Don't get me wrong, all food has quality such as lobster tails, king crab, cocktail prawn, prime rib, filet mignon, etc. but unfortunately none of them taste good, and we definitely feel like the chef there wasted all the good quality food. Lobster it was either over cooked or under cooked, and the meat is mushy, king crab is over cooked, prime rib is tasteless, filet is over cooked, mean well done filet mignon.... on the other hand, any food item that not require prep is better such as oyster and cocktail prawn.

3132704,2016-12-09,0,5z1WIr7E9P2CSzyN5seeSA,"This is without question the finest Sunday Brunch experience we've ever had.  Let's get started...

The good:  The exceptional service starts the moment you check in.  If there is any wait involved you'll be offered a glass of Perrier-Jouet champagne to start your day with.  Normally the wait to be seated is just a few minutes, but if any longer your glass will be re-filled.

If you're fortunate you'll be greeted by Warren, the Sterling Brunch manager.  A true customer service professional.  He checked in with us throughout our meal to assure that everything was great.  

Our server for this experience was Sergio, who provided the perfect balance of attentiveness without being intrusive.  This brunch is to be enjoyed at a leisurely pace and Sergio never made us feel rushed.  He was very quick to fulfill the promise of unlimited champagne and made very appropriate suggestions on what food items to make sure and try.

The food is at a much higher level of quality than that of any other brunch we've ever had.  The carving station offers prime rib, lamb and a couple of other items.  If you can make room for one of the signature omelettes of lobster, boursin cheese and cognac you'll be glad you did.

The seafood options of lobster, crab, prawns and shrimp were great.

Filet mignon was tender and flavorful.

Now for the bad:  Nothing...only that this brunch is only offered on Sundays.  

As I've said this is an experience, not just a meal.  It's a great way to have a very memorable time in Las Vegas.",KTLDdve_wO4f9eLFYckKBg,2,1,5,j-tFAS9bngvO6Exgd3aaJw

Went there for my big 40, hubby must have clued someone in that it was my birthday beacuse every staff member said Happy birthday to me.  We were seated almost right next to the actual buffet, we were a little higher up so we could see it really well.  

The good champagne and high end water were free flowing and each time we got up our napkins were reset to their original folded design.  Of course there was the usual lobster and caviar you always hear about, and both were great!  There's also huge peeled shrimp, mini filets that were cooked perfectly (still pink in the middle!)  rack of lamb, cooked to order omlettes, sushi, lobster fritatta, escargot, gnocchi, smoked salmon, not to mention delicious salads and fresh fruit, such as strawberries and raspberries.  The best part is that they didn't put out tons at a time to sit out on the steam tables for hours, rather they constantly restocked smaller portions.  No eggs benedict sitting on a tray for hours on end here!  Even the waffles were put out in small portions with the chef making new ones every few minutes.  Nothing tasted old or stale here!

The dessert area is by the entrance, away from the other foods which was kind of nice.  Here a cook made Bananas Foster to order, but there were so many other good desserts here I skipped that.  A few different kinds of cheesecake, huge chocolate covered strawberries, fruit tartlets, and white chocolate mousse were my choices.

To anyone going here my advice is pace yourself and take a walk through the casino to the restroom at least once so you can catch your second wind and fill up on more of the delightful food and champagne here.  We spent 2 1/2 hours here before waddling out,  we didn't need to eat again until late that night, and then only a hotdog.",0iWJVnKL2lFwCn9LNPN7Cw,2,0,5,YD1Kc6-FqrpdaJkG7LuqKw

I don't know if the menu is out there anywhere, but this is basically what they offered. Sure, it's great having crab legs, claws and lobster tails, but they were all overcooked. And the truffle mashed potatoes were gluey, but had great truffle aroma and flavor. The caviar was good, but there's only so much caviar a person can eat. The rack of lamb may have been my favorite from the carving station. It was cooked a nice rare. The dessert display was gorgeous and I enjoyed the few things I ate from it.

So in the end, is it worth it? For me, yes. But I drank over a bottle of Perrier Jouet by myself, had a couple servings of caviar, their famous lobster omelette, all the shellfish they offered and almost tried everything at the buffet. For the roommate, probably not. He doesn't really drink that much nor did he eat a lot of caviar or shellfish. He'd rather have more variety since this buffet is on the smaller side.

I've read great things about how good this buffet used to be. I wish I had visited Sterling back then. Maybe not that much has changed, but unless you're big on champagne and caviar, the food itself isn't that much to rave about. I think you can get the same offerings at other buffets in Vegas.",lLfcbYGTeVxQN5Ig0ompJg,33,13,3,moHWVYdy37y87uvdnNqNNw

Oyster - small and not fresh.
Lobster Tail - some good, some bad. I ate 8 though.
same as Filet Mignon some cooked perfect but some over cooked.
Dessert - Delicious. Almost everything. Crepe was simple and tasty.

3170425,2017-11-12,0,5z1WIr7E9P2CSzyN5seeSA,"I was really looking forward to this. We booked 3 months out. I understand usually at buffets the quality of food is usually not as good but kind of figured at $99 a person and with the type of food they serve that it would be different. I was wrong. I was mostly looking forward to the unlimited lobster and oysters. I was really disappointed with the lobster because it was very mushy in some areas and rubbery in others. I would have liked it to have a butter and garlic flavor as I usually expect with my lobsters but the flavor was kind of bland. The oysters were my favorite. They were blue point. I would have preferred if they were separated from the shell already so I didn't have to pick at them but they weren't. They also werent as plump and sweet as other blue points I have had. The filet mignon was cooked perfectly and I could tell the quality of the meat was good, even though a little more flavor would have been nice. I was kind of looking for A1 sauce. The King crab was ok. Some were juicy and moist, some werent. The dessert bar was very nice but they could label them at least. The unlimited champagne was very nice. We made mimosas with them. 

Pretty much overall, the quality of everything did not match other regular places I have eaten. It was pleasant and a good one time experience. Do I recommend it? Yes, the experience is great. The staff, servers, and atmosphere are great. The food is so so. I have had better lobsters, oyster, and filet mignon elsewhere. There was a lot of other good stuff that other people had mentioned that are probably good but I did not try as I was saving room for mainly lobster, oysters, and filet mignon. At least I can say that I have been here, it was fun. But for $99 plus tip, I could have ordered 5+ dozens of oysters and a bunch of lobsters elsewhere and it would have tasted better!

The Sterling Brunch at Bally's is not a step up from the others. It is an elevator to the penthouse up from the others. When you begin your experience with a never empty glass of Perrier-Jouet champagne, things are going well. The room is dark, comfortable, inviting. The servers are top notch and attend to your every need instantaneously. There is no hustle to reach the buffet. The buffet room, though small by comparison, has everything you need and food is constantly refreshed. And people are polite. There are no more than one or two people in front of you at any one time so you are literally seconds from selecting your food. Personally, I found everything to be wonderfully prepared and flavorful. My plate(s) included, shrimp, lobster tails, crab legs, rack of lamb, fillet mignon, caviar, blini and all the trimmings. There's a carving station that, among other wonderful things included a whole side of Nueske bacon that is hand sliced to your desires. Don't see that ever! Gotta tell you that I went back numerous times and I was smiling all the way. Yup it's pricey. But worth every penny. Make a reservation. Seriously, make a reservation.

The room itself is a very well appointed although very dark lovely space! The tables are close together but not so close as you and your neighbor are eating with the same fork! The tables are well set with everything you would need for a pleasant meal!
My server was pleasant and quite polite, but not extremely engaging, but she was quite busy! Her service was however exemplary, my Champagne Flute never reached the level of fully empty, nor did my water!
Now onto the food, I had Three plates of food, and a dessert, and for the most part everything was delicious!
The shrimp are plump and not over cooked and quite large! The grilled asparagus was perfect, the Filet Mignon was cooked more medium to well but yet still juicy, tender and delicious! The Lobster Tails were not perfect but they were damn delicious and quite large!
I also had Prime Rib, yum, Alaskan King Crab Legs, yum, Lamb Chop, Outstanding, and Jonas Crab Claws which were horrible! They were small and way over cooked, dry meat, yet waterlogged and tasteless!

Omg the service was impeccable, the food was terrific, they even had a dessert chef come to the table and make certain things to order. Plus the decor then was old world vegas, with nice wrap around booths and low lighting. Truly an authentic experience and worth the price of admission. Now, sadly when you go to the buffet lines guys are standing around with hairnets on their beards and talking about strip clubs when your getting your overcooked lobster tail lol. They kept the champagne but that is the only sad reminder to a time only a couple years ago when Ballys  actually had something special here on the strip.

I'm so so so disappointed in this place. My friends and I have been dying to try this place for several years every time we went to Vegas, but there was always a reason why we couldn't... maybe we should have listened to that reason. Seriously, I spent $85+ dollars for this place - next time take your money & do the AYCE buffets for 24 hours for $50 or just go to Wynn/Bellagio buffet. I haven't been to either buffet, but I've heard of only good things about them. 

Food: 
I wouldn't have been so mad to pay that hefty price tag for this buffet, but half of the food here were not Grade A quality food. I seriously only made my money back because I had the Sturgeon caviar refilled at least 10 times... They had variety of food, which included some seafood like crab claws and lobster. The lobster meat was so dry and the steak was mediocre. Desserts were very abundant and nicely displayed, but I would never pay that much for desserts. Overall, the food was just meh.

Service:
The waiter was really nice who always came by and refilled our expensive water from the glass bottle! We also got a cup of champagne with our meal. Although I loved your caviar, I will not be returning nor recommending this place to anyone else.

At $85 a person, I had hoped to be disapointed so that I wouldn't have to ever consider paying that much for a buffet again. Unfortunately, I am now going to have to save my money so I can come here on every Vegas trip.

This is probably the smallest buffet in Vegas, but had everything I love to eat.  The lobster tails were my favorite part.  I loved that they were full lobster tails.  I didn't have to deal with the rest of the lobster.  The tails were 5-7 ounces and were nothing like the miniature half tails that you get at the Rio seafood buffet. I more than covered the price of the buffet alone in lobster tails.

Filet mignon was great. King Crab legs were awesome! Prime rib, veal, mashed potatoes were all good.  My wife loved the fruit in jello with grand marnier. The chocolate covered strawberries were super.

I got to try caviar for the first time.  It will also be my last.  Good for you if you like caviar, but my wife and I both hated it.

I hate the taste of alcohol, but I figured that fancy, expensive champagne must taste good.  It tasted just as gross to me as a bottle of champagne from the 99 cent store.

My wife and I stayed here for close to 2 hours, when we normally stay around an hour at any other buffet.

Sure, the price is almost twice the price of the 24hr buffet pass, but I really couldn't eat anymore the next day and a half anyway.

The service is also really great here. While we were there, one of the servers, or maybe a manager, walked over to Paris to get some macaroons for the kids at one of the tables near us.

The only dilema we had was how much to tip. On one hand, it is a buffet, but on the other it is a fine dining experience.  We went with the fine dining experience tip, since we would be returning.",2XLKT9MCbx27B1WSJIhQAQ,1,1,5,BcATJPKW4LxdQ3ovH8zGZA

service was excellent, they gave you that fine dining atmosphere, but it was a buffet, so you don't feel out of place in your t-shirt and flip flops.  we made reservations and i requested to be as close to the buffet as possible.  champagne was excellent and the waiter was on point as my glass never dipped below half full.

the food itself was superb.  i'm a seafood hound so i was in heaven with cracked and opened snow crab claws, king crab legs, and mobs of whole lobster.  now i will say that the lobster is a tad overdone as lobster meat tends not to hold up well in a chafing dish.  but it was still excellent.  the caviar, that the sushi maker guards with her life, was also excellent.  but the best thing i ate had to be the pink peppercorn encrusted lamb chops.  i'm not normally a lamb fan, so i tried this at the very end when i was already full, and it blew me away.  i was so disappointed i hadn't tried it earlier when i still had real estate available in my stomach. 

they also had excellent made to order omelets and pasta which my vegetarian (yeah, totally not getting her money's worth eh?) wife enjoyed.  other offerings included fresh pastries, prime rib, bacon, & sausage, jumbo shrimp, oysters, and many other items that i did not get a chance to try as i gorged myself on shell fish.  maybe next time...",vekGsN7QGHo7gelmVSbOig,4,2,5,D0MPSfzf_7roCHLeS_axoQ

3307918,2015-09-29,7,5z1WIr7E9P2CSzyN5seeSA,"tl;dr:  Too pricy even for ayce lobster tail, lamb chops, caviar, and champagne unless you can REALLY put it away.  Timing is everything it seems when it comes to the selections...

Sterling Brunch is a high end buffet where you hope that quality doesn't have to take a backseat to quantity, but after filling our bellies I don't believe any of us thought that any individual item was the best they ever had...

It's $85 a head with a player's card from Bally's which is free to obtain so make sure you get one, then it's just tax and tip which brings you up to around $105 all in. At this price, I'm sure you could find a place that you like for any of the individual items offered at this AYCE buffet, but Sterling Brunch caters to those of us who are looking for a deal with the high end stuff;  where you can have your fill of champagne, lobster tails, and caviar;  where you can have your cake and eat it;  where for once quality might trump quantity.  A one stop shop for bottomless Pierre Jouet which is constantly being refilled in our flutted glasses.  This is probably the single biggest reason to try the buffet although it's normally a deal-breaker for me since I can't drink very much.  I didn't even get to try the caviar since I gorged myself on three plates of protein and was also eyeing the dessert too, so that was on me.  The biggest decision seems to be what to stuff in your mouth before your brain tells your stomach you've reached your limit.  So my problem mostly is that I took a fool's bet that I could get my money's worth from SB but in the end the house always comes out ahead...

Bottom line about the lobster tails is that they didn't live up to my tremendous expectations as there were large inconsistencies in texture from one to the next.  I wound up having three over the course of brunch and only the first one I had was ""acceptable"", the other two were ""mushy.""  I couldn't explain how that could be since I had two from the same batch and one from another batch.  My son who also helped himself to multiple lobster tails seemed more content although he used a better strategy of going for whatever was being brought out at the moment he was getting his food...

The Lobster Ravioli pasta was thick and slightly chewy.  The sauce was thick as well.  Overall the dish was really rich and filling, for all of it's looks a pretty heavy-handed dish.  I thought it has a very similar taste profile to the Lobster Bisque although the textures were totally different obviously...

Although I was too sated to even try the caviar, my wife said:  ""it's ok, it's just caviar...""   I took this to mean that it's probably not the best way to enjoy caviar at an ayce buffet, serving it in an individual ceramic although I noticed that they did offer it with traditional blini and garnishes...

I normally enjoy a salty, savory outside cut but I probably should have opted for a thicker, medium-rare inside cut of the prime rib.  They had already cut away the ribs so those were not an option.  In retrospect, I should have at least tried a thick slice of meat if only to try the cap which looked good...

The minuscule Filet Mignon was cutesy but not tender enough.  The Lamb Chop was marginally better and I feel as if I should have had another...

I was disappointed with all of the ""cold"" seafood:  the Poached Jumbo Shrimp and the Snow Crab Claws were insipid,  the Bluepoint Oysters were probably shucked a long time before I got to them and weren't the freshest, and the Alaskan King Crab Legs were too much work to open as they were scored but not cracked.  Skip...

The popovers were really amazing and airy but I couldn't enjoy them because I was afraid of filling up on bread.  The same with the desserts;  everything looked so good all I actually tried was a bite here and there and some of the fruit...

Although I came out stuffed, I didn't feel all that satisfied as if I had a terrific meal.  I probably had a more satisfying feeling after coming out of Bacchanal or Wicked Spoon but a lot of it probably has to do with feeling like I got a better value for my $$$$...",LP59kBNEHmASJZWynra29g,17,10,3,xLB-C1cBkcc0EkQMfpjE2A

3332852,2018-03-14,1,5z1WIr7E9P2CSzyN5seeSA,"Open only on Sundays, I was very excited to get a seating at Sterling Brunch.  Of course I went straight for the high value items like lobster, crab legs, oysters, and caviar; I tried everything though so I got a full feeling of what the restaurant had to offer.  

To begin, the lobster didn't taste fresh, though it was very meaty.  This applies to the crab legs and oysters as well - large but very mediocre quality.  The caviar was a nice touch and was salty and a hit at our table.  Popovers as always are tasty, but at a buffet, they're just fillers.  Filet was well overcooked, lamb was hard, prime rib was nice and tender, while the salmon was fantastic.  Salmon was the clear standout from the meal as far as entrees.  The banana foster french toast was quite good and rich and sugary, but kind of out of place, being one of the only brunch dishes besides eggs and sausage.  The dessert station was very week and wasn't replenished as much as I had hoped, with many times being out of lollipops and strawberries.  

Champagne is great quality.  They'll keep you filled throughout your brunch.  Add in some juice flavors as well to make it a mimosa or even go crazy and try a bloody mary.  However, when the brunch ends on Sunday, at I believe 3pm, it really ends.  They literally take plates off the table, turn off lights and shoo people out of the restaurant.  That service is poor and they need to make less of a scene when it comes to closing out the meal.

Service from the beginning wasn't that great.  We waited 10 minutes although we had a reservation.  And then they didn't even offer us drinks while waiting.  Popovers weren't that warm, and constantly we had to flag down waiters for utensils and water refills.

Sterling brunch is cool for a one time event, but at $100+ it's not worth it.  Food wasn't of the highest quality and service is as you'd expect at Bally's  Glad I tried it out, but not a must in Vegas, especially with plenty of other high end buffets on the strip worth more bang for your buck.",JaqcCU3nxReTW2cBLHounA,3,0,3,vF5JdpYUFdOzKfULWIteNA

3420598,2014-06-10,0,5z1WIr7E9P2CSzyN5seeSA,"In Vegas there is no shortage of fine dining experiences available and I have enjoyed many 4 & 5 star steakhouses in NY, CA & Vegas. I am thrilled to report that the Sterling Brunch at Bally's is amongst my favorite dining experiences in Las Vegas and an excellent value IF you enjoy a leisurely meal and sample all that this buffet has to offer. If you want 100's of menu items then you may be disappointed. There are other worthy buffets that offer good food and variety to satisfy most any palate. If you're satisfied with fewer, very high quality items with exceptional service then I strongly recommend this brunch.

The quality/taste of the food prepared here is in the same league as any 4 star steak house. What is provided is a beautiful feast of traditional steak house favorites. Items I enjoyed include: aged well-crusted/seasoned filet mignon with herbed steak butter; sea bass finished in a light basil pesto type sauce; king crab legs & drawn butter; split maine lobster tail removed from the shell upon request; rack of lamb, fresh oysters on the half shell with mignonette sauce; prime rib served with a rich thick au jus that is reduced to a near glaze; crab claws, roasted applewood bacon slab cut to order; assorted sushi (small selection) and sake; truffle mashed potatoes; excellent creamed spinach; jumbo shrimp cocktail; individual antipasti plates; crab cakes; omelet (including an excessively rich lobster boursin cheese offering) and that's just what's on the actual buffet line. Is this a massive selection? No, not at all compared to most Vegas buffets but I would personally much prefer this smaller selection of classic steak house items done right and seasoned to perfection over the often mass produced inconsistent and underseasoned choices at many buffets and brunches in town. 

Some complain about the lack of salad bar. There is no salad bar but there are additional offerings from the kitchen that are brought out to order by the attentive servers (all finely clad in tuxedos by the way). Options included: some of the best lobster bisque ever with creme fraische and microgreens, caesar or chopped salad, caviar, tuna tartar, prosciutto eggs benedict, and belgian waffles with macerated berries. In addition the wait staff is constantly topping you off with unlimited Perrier Jouet champagne (avg price $50/bottle in stores), juice, coffee, and even simple syrup for our iced tea ""so you don't have to wait for the sugar to dissolve"", said one of our kind servers. 

The micro desserts were a feast for the eyes and mouth, though I will say I'm saddened they no longer offered the praline crepes and cherries jubilee I had read about. The desserts are comparable to other great buffets but the attention to detail was phenomenal. Miniature carmelized pineapple upside down cakes with edible gold leaf; baby martini glasses layered with custard and mango coulis topped with whipped cream, powder sugar dusted raspberries, and a long chocolate curl like a swizzle stick painted blue. Cake pops that are not cake but in fact layers of chocolate encasing rich chocolate mousse. Huge chocolate covered strawberries, some covered in oreo cookie crumbs or roasted almonds. Mini cream puffs wearing a wide brimmed ""hat"" of carmelized sugar. Napoleons, glazed fruit tartlets, dark chocolate tartlets topped with delicate butterfly wings of white chocolate. The tiny treats were as tasty as they were beautiful. Plus seasonal ripe berries to compliment the champagne and carmelized banana bread pudding french toast. 

Service is friendly, highly attentive, and if they see you coming from the buffet line with a full plate they rush to take it from you and escort you back to your table. Reservations mean no wasting precious vacation time waiting in amusement park-like lines. Considering the avg cost of a moderate to high end steakhouse a la carte menu the $85 price for all the food, champagne, and sake described above is a steal. Just be sure you bring your total rewards players card to get the $85 price. Vegetarians and those with small appetites or a preference for simple food will not fare well here. A steak house aficionado with a love for surf and turf will not only delight in this dining experience but boast that it was a great value for their money. To maximize your dollar sit and stay a while and drink up! My 3 king crab legs, 2 lobster tails, filet mignon, 2 bowls of lobster bisque (to which I added another cut up lobster tail!), 6 glasses of champagne, caviar appetizer, tiramisu and chocolate strawberries alone would FAR exceed $85 at even a moderate priced steak house chain and I ate more than this.

They've got a whole separate dessert selection that I didn't have much room for. 

Starting from the left side, there's a maki station that you pick a small plate of your choice that typically consist of 2 maki rolls. There's also popular caviar (based on Yelp reviews) so don't miss them! Walking along, there's the salad (ahem, for those who want to eat some salad as you eat- I'd totally skip it), berries, and some breakfast selection. 
Towards the center are best stuff you should focus on. Lobster tails, crab legs, prime beef. To the right of it are potatos, steak, asparagus, and cold seafood station with oysters, stone crabs, and shrimp cocktails. There're condiments for those, hot butter, cocktail sauce, lemon, and etc. 

I immediately focused on the center, as stated above, and didn't get to eat much else. I was TOO FULL to eat so much. Did I eat $100 worth of stuff, I'm not sure, but I did manage 3 lobster tails! :) I, of course, left like my stomach was ready to pop out, drunk from those champagne, didn't feel like walking nor take a nap; I simply didn't know what I wanted to do because I was miserably full.

Many have commented on the menu, yes it appears more limited but EVERYTHING is special and most items very delicately prepared. The only complaint I had was the Alaskan king crabs are not split, just scored, and those suckers hurt trying to manipulate the briny sweet meat out of them.

The king crab legs were huge and flavorful along with the fanny bay oysters which were tiny and very fresh and tasty. In hindsight i could have ate and drank my $85 worth of food with these 4 items alone!

Sterling Brunch is located at BLT Steak in Ballys. Since we had reservations, we did not wait at all for a table. Our waiters were Tony and Cesar and they provided the best customer service ever! They were both personable and engaged in conversation with our whole section. They were also very attentive. My champagne glass was always full and never went below half of the glass. They were amazing and definitely made my experience at Sterling so great!

Food was delicious as well! The selection is not as big as other buffets, but the main draw to Sterling is the quality dishes. All I ate was lobster, king crab, and filet mignon anyways, which were all so good! The desserts were delicious too! They also serve hot popovers, which I tried not to eat, but I couldn't help it!

3589236,2007-07-27,0,5z1WIr7E9P2CSzyN5seeSA,"Best and most expensive buffet I've ever been to.  Around $70.
Been here many times over the years.  I agree with VA F. that it is too bad the price went up AND the quality went down a bit.  The unlimited high quality alcohol is probably the real justification for the price.
Make a reservation - the wait can be long.  However, they've opened up 2 adjacent restaurants for seating room, so it is no so bad anymore.  You just have to walk a ways to the food.
So, the best part about this buffet is the great champagne and sake.  Very high quality.  You need to keep drinking to make sure it is worth the price (like cheng K, who finished 3 bottles! amazing.)  I can only manage 1 bottle and several sake shots.
One time I had some pasta with real truffled sauce - it was heavenly.
Unlimited caviar - though I don't think I like it too much.  The lobsters they have are the cheaper 1/2 pounders - presplit so all the favors are leeched out.",nLzTX0cRlTNj87qLTm6j7A,0,0,4,SreXWw7-fEWZkrj4EcCiAg

I've read lots good reviews about it and had very high expectation. It took us awhile to realize that Sterling is not a restaurant. It's located inside Bally's steakhouse. I personally prefer to enjoy my Sunday brunch in a bright and open spaced restaurant (so I can enjoy the sunshine). Since Sterling is located inside a traditional steakhouse, I bet you can just imagine how this place is even with all the lights on full blast. Let's talk about food now. Crab claws and legs were very fresh and crab meat was sweet and succulent. Lamb chop was really good! It was tendered and perfectly cooked with their special mint sauce. Caviar that you can get from sushi bar was okay quality. It did meet my expectation since this is AYCE. However, I was very disappointed with the over cooked lobster tail!! I just felt like they could do so much better since this is a Sunday brunch with $90 per person!!! There was nothing really wowed me from dessert bar.

If you are planning on visiting, make reservations! It is only available for Sunday brunch so it may take a little planning. Sterling brunch is located at the BLT Steak in Bally's. 

When we got there we were escorted to the waiting area and offered champagne. PLUS! 
We didn't wait long and were seated within 10 minutes of our reservation time. 

You can order items that are made to order from the kitchen. We ordered the Lobster Benedict and the Prosciutto Benedict. The Lobster Benedict was fantastic! You can taste the chunks of lobster they used. The Prosciutto was my favorite of the two, however. The salty flavors from the meat complimented the Benedict sauce. 

Oysters: Decent but not great. I don't find buffet oysters that thrilling.
Lobster: Fantastic! Although some were overcooked, most were perfect. Dipped in buttery goodness, i could not stop eating this. 
Rack of Lamb: Tender, flavorful, delicious.
Prime Rib: Standard buffet prime rib. 
Sushi: Standard and nothing really stood out.
Caviar: Delicious! We put it on everything and even ate it on its own!
Bread: Fluffy, crunchy, delicious!
Mash Potatoes: Seriously one of the best mashed potatoes I have even put in my mouth!
Lobster Ravioli: Wonderful, we kept getting more of it!
Chorizo Potatoes: Good but not life changing. 
Dessert: A modest selection. We had the chocolate covered strawberries and a few pastries. Nothing game changing. 

You definitely get what you pay for. Quality food that is fresh. Since they only have them on Sunday, they can focus a lot more on the quality. Champagne bottles being popped constantly (love that sound). They also had a bloody mary bar! 

Although it did not have the same amount of variety as a Bacchanal, it made up for it in quality and the selections. Highly recommend for an occasion!! We will be back.",nNawiARs-1qPZOXg3uP3WQ,14,3,5,z0gtAVuJSIMN6XYuVnkDhQ

3670490,2017-12-11,1,5z1WIr7E9P2CSzyN5seeSA,"To be quite honest, this buffet was just okay to me and didn't really seem to be worth the $105 per person price. Online reservations are only available for 3 months in advance, but my bf was able to make a reservation a couple days prior through his Amex concierge service. We were both pretty excited to come here especially after watching the video on Buzzfeed and reading the great reviews this place has. We were checked in and seated right at the time of our reservation and champagne was poured into our glasses -- it was free flowing bottomless champagne which was nice but I was pretty hungover from the previous day so I didn't really care for it. 

This buffet serves premium items such as unlimited lobster tails, Alaskan king crab legs, jumbo cocktail shrimps, caviar, blue point oysters, filet mignon, lamb chops, prime rib, etc. The first thing I went for were the lobster tails and king crab legs. I was super excited for the lobster tails but it ended up being a disappointment because the meat was super mushy and rubbery and jut did not taste good at all. The king crab legs were good though so I would recommend eating more of that than the lobster tails. The lobster bisque soup was alright -- not too salty like most places. The filet mignon and prime rib were both good as well. The biscuits & gravy and truffle mashed potatoes were both pretty good. They also had a omelette station that everyone lined up for and you can choose the toppings you want in it. I had mine made with lobster and cognac and the chef added some herb cheese to the center as well. The sushi looked old and nasty like the ones at those $15 Chinese buffets back home so I didn't touch that.

They have a separate dessert bar with a pretty looking display of desserts that were not bad, but they don't have ice cream. They also have a Bloody Mary bar as well. 

Overall, it was a good experience to be able to go to this ""premium"" buffet on the strip, but I don't think I would be returning. There isn't as much of a selection of food compared to the other buffets on the strip & the premium items such as the lobster tails were not that great. I would recommend going just for the experience -- the service here is extremely good as well, but other than that, I don't think I would ever want to pay $105 for this brunch again.

I can say this is definitely the best brunch buffet spot right now in Las Vegas (this overtakes the now defunct jasmine brunch in the Bellagio... I'm still mourning at its lost). This brunch is in its own class!

+ top quality food items that tops other brunches
+ lobster tail!
+ unlimited champagne
+ good ambience and service

- pricey so not for everyone

Location: 
is inside the Ballys resort and hotel. Parking is shared with Paris hotel and it connects both. The sterling brunch is located in the BLT steakhouse. This place had a recent renovation and he restaurant definitely is classy looking, much more then the casino itself. 

Food:
This is the highlight. This place has all high end food items and no other buffet compares in terms of quality, as it should for a price point of 90 per person (85 per person if you sign up for a free total rewards card). Drinks are included in his brunch, including brut champagne! Does not include bloody Mary's. 

My favorite food items include the sea bass, filet mug in, Alaskan king crab, jumbo shrimp cocktail, the rack of lamb with chimichurri sauce and lobster tail. Yes gigantic pacific lobster tail is part of this buffet! Other items include made to order omelettes with lobster, caviar, sushi, cold items, charcuterie, prime rib and so much more. The overall selection is less the places like Bacchanal and wicked spoon, however his can be a good thing because they have a lot of blister dishes, while this brunch can concentrate making its more limited menu fantastic.

You also get a fresh batch of their freshly baked popovers which are some of the best popovers I've had (beats Jordan pond in Maine), however be careful because they can fill you up. They tasted great dipped with the lobster bisque. 

Dessert great selection of mini pastries such as chocolate mousse, chocolate covered strawberries, macaroons, cake pops, and tarts. Their brioche bread pudding French toast with bananas foster is perhaps he best French toast I've ever had that I qualify it as a dessert. There are multiple layers to the bread that are crispy on the edges and the insides soak up the sweet syrup. Perfection!

-Assorted Cheese
-House champagne for mimosas

3742220,2016-12-29,8,5z1WIr7E9P2CSzyN5seeSA,"This is a long over due review for my visit in August but I doubt anything has changed and things only get worse in the winter time when nothing is in season.

Stay away! I was so intrigued by this buffet because it featured unlimited lobster and oysters! I'm a seafood junkie. Unfortunately, the seafood here is just absolutely gross. Everything is previously frozen, don't expect anything fresh. You are in the middle of a desert.

First, of all, if you ever had cold water lobsters from MAINE, you would not ever want to eat warm water lobsters, especially the FROZEN kind. Maine lobster meat is meaty and sweet (go to Luke's Lobster. There is a location in Vegas) while warm water lobster has a crunchy/chewy or mushy/rubbery texture depending on how it's defrosted. Well the kind of lobster served at Sterling Brunch is the crunchy/chewy warm water kind, no meaty texture at all. The only taste left in the meat is just a fishy taste complete with somewhat of a crunch when you bite into it. If you ever had meaty shrimp vs crunchy shrimp, then you know what I'm talking about.

As for the oysters, omg, they were so gross! First of all they were blue points, the cheapest, most common, oysters you can get (shipped from the Atlantic on the east coast!) . Second of all, they were not freshly shucked. They must have been shucked long before then refrigerated. By the time they were put out, the juices of the oysters have dried up and the meat was stuck to the shells. They literally tasted like old salty chewing gum crud with a layer of jello slime left by the dried up juices. I've had frozen oysters that tasted better. I don't know wtf they did to the oysters to make them all dried up and gummy like that. This is a travesty to serve oysters like this!!

Oh yeah there's caviar? Umm...more like old fishy tapioca balls. Stay away. 

Sushi was rice heavy and also dried up.

The other seafood were crab claws, crab legs and shrimp--pretty average stuff you can get at MANY other buffets and restaurants for 1/3 of the buffet price in Vegas, no need to come here. The crab claws are NOT stone crab claws nor rock crab claws but jonah crab claws, the cheapest kind. They do not taste as sweet as rock or stone crab claws. Plus being previously frozen, they even tasted more bitter and the meat, soggy and watery than if they were fresh.

The fillet mignon was not cooked very well, burnt!! Who the hell cooks fillet mignon well done???

The dessert/pastry bar was the only thing that tasted good and the chocolate used was good quality. Selection was limited however (bartender said the dessert area used to be 3 times as big and they used to have custom crepe stations). The only thing that I really liked was the chocolate covered strawberries but everyone else wanted them too and they didn't refill them fast enough. The fresh berries in general were really good, but why the hell would you spent $95 to eat berries. You can buy 7 pounds worth of ORGANIC blue and raspberries from whole foods for the same price. The fresh asparagus spears were grilled very well, too but again don't spend $95 just to eat fresh produce (literally the ONLY non-frozen stuff at this buffet).

The only saving grace to my meal was the bartender (tall black gentleman, didn't get his name). I sat at the bar and he kept the endless champagne flowing, topping my glass even before it was half empty.

$125 after tax and tip (they don't do the total rewards discount anymore)! If you are a big champagne person then this buffet might be worth it. Please for the love of God, DO. NOT. come here for the seafood. I love seafood and the seafood here made me want to throw up because of how not fresh it is. Please don't pay $100+ to eat old seafood.

If you want excellent FRESH seafood and steaks, I would recommend Joe's Seafood in Caesar's Palace. You'll end up paying the same but you won't leave hating yourself from trying to stuff your stomach with crappy food to get your money's worth.",_sWha3z3xUK_BXqjl9DPaA,20,5,2,ThEO1VPppiSI7pkvb89MzA

3761033,2011-01-18,2,5z1WIr7E9P2CSzyN5seeSA,"4.5 stars.

Was in LV during CES weekend.  Thought this place would be packed so made a reservation for 9:30AM.  Surprisingly, the place never got full.  Would say 1/4 of the tables were still empty when we left around noon.  Took our time stuffing our faces and washing things down w/ champagne!

A credit card was required when I made my reservation.  Was informed that a penalty would be charged to the card if cancellations were not made before 3:00PM on Sat or if no show.  Didn't ask how much the penalty would be.  Thought this was kinda weird as I've never experienced this w/ any other restaurants.  I mean... it's not like they'd refuse walk-ins..... Anyways, took it as the hotel reception's problem, (money hungry cuz the recession!?), nothing to do with the restaurant.

The PRO's:
-SERVICE!  Waiter made me an emperor!!  Never had to ask for refills on water, oj, nor champagne.  Our waiter would pull out our chairs for us every time we made it back to our table, w/ dirty plates gone of course.
-LAMB CHOPS!  My fav red meat in this meal.  Medium - med. rare.  Mint jellies on the side. Perfecto~
-KING CRAB LEGS!  I'd take steaming hot legs over cold ones anytime!  No fuss with the butter cooling/clumping up halfway.  Props to our waiter for actually cracking each and every leg, wrapped in towel, with the handle of the table knife!
-LOBSTER TAILS!  Like others said, only grab it when its fresh!  Overcooked rubbery chewiness is a no no!
-CHOCOLATE DIPPED STRAWBERRIES!  HUGE!  I mean MONSTROUS strawberries + chocolate.  Nuff said!?

The SOSO's:
-CAVIER.  Only have sevruga cavier.  The small black roes.  Cheaper and most abundant type out there.  Although they were fresh.
-FRUITS.  Think they could have up-ed a notch here.  There's definitely more variety than other buffets, but quality just wasn't there.  Sliced dragon fruits, tasteless papaya, and canned lychee in addition to the usual buffet bunch didn't quite make these fruits ""exotic"" either; which is what the waiter proclaimed them to be.  Having figs were a plus imo though.

The CON's:
-PRIME RIB.  No ""lips"" on any of the 3 roasts that they had!  That's like having fried chicken w/o skin!! Other reviewers' pix had some better ones.  Bad batch of roasts i guess.  Choice grade at best.
-NO CRACKERS.  I like to enjoy my cheese w/ crackers.  Not used to eating brie straight up.  Our waiter did grab some crackers from next door.  Nabisco crackers... Thanks but no thanks.

Overall, the service and champagne masked all the disliking I had towards this place.  Would come back only to share the experience with people who hasn't been here.  Otherwise, rather drop my $85/pop at a non-buffet restaurant.",geoAeX-EWLRG0IXKA6P8HQ,2,1,4,DyLkINOdeZ7-o3CxEeybrA

The large lobster tails were not overcooked but were sweet and tender. The caviar was good quality, not fishy or overly salty. The champagne was perrier jouet, not cheap crap. They also served fantastically fluffy popovers. All in all, it's a gluttonous, indulgent must-try buffet at least once. 

My one and only complaint was the lighting -- I know it's located in a steakhouse, and thus dimly lit and full of dark decor and mood lighting, but it was super dark in the dining area... to the point that we asked for a different table so we could see our food better!! 

Reservations are a must - they are sometimes booked weeks out.",--mQ4S5h1tXzvE9VDYVwdQ,8,3,5,yjXug0br2b1wXm_iwdHCPQ

Pros- Awesome food (though like with any buffet setting some things can be dry, if thats the case just get another one)
Amazing service
Open bar if you don't like the champagne, this was a surprise to me and made the meal all the better. 
Real Sushi not the normal buffett kind if you know what I mean
Omelette bar was high end as was everything about the place.

Cons-
My belly can only consume so much food

I can honestly say I never thought I would enjoy this so much nor ever go back again. Now I can't wait til next month when I can afford to go again just an awesome time.",bW2fmK-FnGDvAVQo-PH1Nw,7,1,5,S8rvlCkoYycGx24kOW27Mw

Just kidding. I came here for breakfast en route to Utah. While the food is most fresh in the early mornings, I really don't reccomend eating here beore 11am. Unless you regularly eat seafood for breakfast, Sterling is best enjoyed as lunch.

Sterling is the best hidden buffet in Vegas. You won't find this buffet on the Buffets of Buffets packages deal. You won't find this advertised at Ballys. You will however, find this restaurant on Yelp (which is how I found out Sterling).  You will see other reviews about this place mentioning ""Old Vegas."" The decor is reminiscent of Old Vegas. Carved wooden banisters, dim lighting, the uniforms of the staff- all Old Vegas. This is a restaurant that I would imagine Robert Deniro, Joe Pesci, and Ray Liotta eatting at to discuss 'business.'

The food selection is the best I have ever had for a buffet (lobster tails, rack of lamb, filet mignon, caviar, sashimi, king crab, oyster shooters, snow crab). Okay, the selection is there, but how about the quailty of the food? The lobster tails (approximately 10-12 oz in size) were cooked slightly more well than I would have personaly preferred, but  seasoned well. The filet was tender, moist, and seasoned well. There as a lack of charring on the outside, but I was not anticipating that for the quantity they had produced. Like all King Crab served outside of Alaska, Sterling's King Crab is brined, previously cooked, and previously frozen. The caviar is not of the highest quality, but it makes an excellent condiment and I used it like salt. This is gluttony on an exponential level.

For 120.00 tab, did I eat my money's worth? YES, HELL YES. Would I come here again? Yeah, but only for a really special occassion or if I win big at the tables.",LK6I0Qlat3_SGk8kLRUsOg,4,1,4,rlbVHu9WgCgmHKf5hLmXoQ
3798617,2017-04-05,2,5z1WIr7E9P2CSzyN5seeSA,"Sterling Brunch is the most amazing brunch buffet that I have ever been to! The selection is not as large as other buffets but you're still looking at 25-35 savory options and at least 20 dessert options. The options that they do have are AMAZING! I had a 10:30am reservation was seated within 5 minutes. 

The restaurant is very dimly lit, probably for ambiance. I would prefer a little more lighting considering that it was relatively early for a large meal. Our waiter was Javier. He didn't make us feel rushed and constantly refilled our glasses and removed the dishes. The buffet foods were put out in small batches and were constantly refilled so I have no complaints about the freshness or availability of the food. 

My favorite items at Sterling Brunch were the mashed potatoes, lobster, and lamb chop. Definitely my favorite mashed potatoes ever! The lobster tails were very large and were cooked perfectly. Javier told us that we came on a good weekend for the lobster tails. I think it just depends on the season and we were very lucky that they were huge! The lamb chops were seasoned with garlic and were so tender and juicy.  The desserts were delicious and very cute. I sampled the majority of them, all very good.

Don't forget to ask your waiter about the off menu items like the eggs benedicts and ice cream! I will definitely come back here the next time that I'm in Vegas! Although other buffets, like Bacchanal, are cheaper and have more food options, I don't think any other Vegas buffets' quality is remotely comparable with Sterling Brunch. 5 stars.

With no rhyme or reason for this ""Food Tour"" we had a list of restaurants that we wanted to explore and the Sterling Brunch was probably on the list the longest. Anyways, on to the review...

I am not usually a fan of buffets in any regard, but in this case this is THE BEST BRUNCH BUFFET IN VEGAS and THE BEST BUFFET I HAVE EVER HAD IN LIFE.

We were greeted with Perrier Jouët Champagne. So delicious and refreshing that I did not ruin it with orange juice. After getting seated, I immediately went straight for the Caviar. I think it was an American Sturgeon Caviar that was being served, if I saw the label correctly, and it was delicious with all the fix-ins (Warm Blinis, toasted french bread, onions, and cilantro). 

The only reason why I gave this brunch 4 stars instead of 5 stars was because some of the dishes, especially the Filet Mignon and the Lobster, were a bit overcooked. Why offer beautiful ingredients and ruin them by overcooking them? But don't let that steer you away because regardless of being a tad overcooked it was still amazingly delicious and my champagne glass was never less than 1/2 a glass full. That kept me a happy camper. Also, a little complaint to our waiter that the Filet was a tad overcooked, 15 mins later he comes out with medium rare Filets that were delicious, we tipped him graciously. The lamb was also delicious but you have to make sure to let the carver now that you want it rare or you may end up with another piece of overcooked meat. They also had oysters and an omelet making station. The omelet I skipped but the oysters were to die for.  

There was also a sushi section that was highly disappointing. I asked the Sushi Chef for some albacore, she had none, I asked her for some salmon, she had none. I'm not sure if it was just out of laziness on her part or if they were just plain out. But its ok... I moved on to the next section because I honestly didn't go to this brunch for sushi anyways. Like I said unlimited Lobster tails and Filet Mignon was the main reason I came and regardless of it being overcooked it was like heaven knowing you could eat as many lobster tails as you wanted. The desserts were also amazing. We almost had to pass on the desserts because we were so full. But we forced ourselves out of our Cardiac Chairs and stuffed ourselves with some freshly made crepes, macaroons, cakes, and other assorted pastries. The desserts were all amazing and a good way to end the meal.

We then stumbled out of the brunch buffet drunk and stuffed. And then, smiled to each other and said.... ""THAT WAS BOMB!""",pUmTc6CSKsQMbHgk4ZWvIQ,3,1,4,ntfDRwVlUb3nmWdMdPjq0Q

3835127,2017-11-13,3,5z1WIr7E9P2CSzyN5seeSA,"For me, I did not think this was a worth it buffet brunch. True, there was champagne. True, there was unlimited Lobster tails, crab legs, sushi, etc. However, I felt like there are just much better options in Vegas. We tried 3 buffets, one each day, and this was probably the most disappointing.

Let's start with the good. The service was impeccable. The server were talkative and playful and they really grab your attention and have fun with the patrons. They are entertaining and that's why this place gained a star. Our server was just awesome. The ambiance and the dining was nice which is standard for a steakhouse. They are inside a steakhouse BTW.

Now the bad. The place opened at 9:30 am. They check people in through their reservations and tell you to wait at their waiting corner. When the time comes, they call you to escort you to your table. We checked in at 9 with our reservation, so we did it early. We waited till 9:30. We waited in the waiting corner. We watched everyone who checked in too get seated. As time went on, we realized that everyone was seated including people who came later than us. It felt weird. I had to go back to the front and ask if we had been forgotten.  The hostess then proceeded to print our ticket and had us escorted to the table. This part made me feel like we weren't properly checked in. It started our day on the wrong foot. With that the experience for brunch kind of dwindled as the food didn't really save them.

The sushi was dry compared to other sushi buffets. The steak was dry as if it was under the heat lamp for so long. The Mahi Mahi was tough. The desserts were on par with other buffets. No ice cream though.

For $105 per person, I expected more. It was a bit saddening after trying other buffets before this one. However, if you value the lobster tail and the champagne highly, then go for it. Just be warned that you might be a bit disappointed in the quality of the food. 

Just for the record, I had 5 lobster tails, 5 glasses of champagne, 22 pieces of sushi, and other things.",xBLNxu1PQWCggsPpxMkhwA,14,0,2,7BYyORFyqvSwlkSSQWy_Cg

The broiled lobster tails were good, and BIG.  But I wish they were boiled or steamed as they are much better that way.

The caviar was .. well, it's caviar.

The crab claws were big and full.

The tables are set up very nicely, everything is really nice and a bit on the fancy side.

3852604,2015-11-27,15,5z1WIr7E9P2CSzyN5seeSA,"Finally tried the acclaimed Sunday Sterling Brunch at BLT Ballys and I am sad to say that I was let down. Was it hyped up too much for me? Were my expectations too great? I don't know.

What I do know/think is that for $100 a person, I do not think that it was worth it. At all. For that price tag, I was expecting better quality in both food and service but was let down in both regards. 

After checking in for our reservation on time (and being a Diamond member), we still waited nearly 15 minutes for a table and watched 2 other parties that came after us get seated. Maybe there is another explanation for this but still a sour way to start brunch. 

The brunch does come with free flowing Perrier Jouet champagne and my glass was never empty, I will attest to that! Cheers! However, it took me several attempts to get my orange juice refilled. :(

After finally being seated and drinks ordered, I explored the supposed star of the show: food! The buffet section was very.. minimal and underwhelming. I was surprised and caught off guard by the small selection that was offered. But at that point, I thought 'Hey, maybe the quality will blow you away and the selection won't even matter.'

How I wish that were true. The flavors were underwhelming. Items such as the filet were cooked unevenly, lacked taste and was cold by the time it reached my table. The sushi/nigiri selection looked like it had seen better days, falling apart on the plates and unappealing. Other items included lobster tails, crab legs, oyster shooters, omelets, french toast, waffles, charcuterie, etc. You get the idea. The dessert station (which was a section of the bar counter)

I just can't believe that at the hefty price tag, I didn't leave amazed and wowed. Rather, much was left to be desired. I'm hoping it was a fluke. But I'll never know.",90ZtCUwxXjUBvrdBgyWYyg,26,12,2,-8xdoXj1gveatucNhn36Kw

I have no problem spending money on good food and drinks, but I was hard pressed to spend $85 on brunch that had the word ""buffet"" in it. When Julie K had posted a talk thread informing us of the Groupon Reserve, 2 for $99, I jumped on it figuring there wouldn't be better time to try it. Made a reservation for 10:30, arrived on time, and was seated an hour later. An hour. I guess they figure my time isn't valuable, I could've slept in longer!

I skipped the carving station as I'm not a huge meat eater so I can't comment on that. The entire warming station was set up like a catering type deal, all the food is in a metal flip top with fire under neath so all the food had that hardened layer on top. Not appetizing at all. Went over to the sushi station, ordered hamachi and tako, when I got to the table, I noticed how hard the fish was, I wasn't brave enough to try it. The caviar was scooped from a bucket type thing, I gave it a try but spit it out. It was so warm. I tried the oysters which were stacked on a plate sitting on ice, again when I returned to the table I noticed how smelly they were. So I was too nervous to try them. All the while we were barely checked on my our server, we had maybe 3 refills of PJ (that's basically the best part of the meal so far) we ended up eating mostly crab legs and a few crab claws. The desserts were comparable to Costco, we tried the creme brûlée, ehh.

Sterling Brunch has, among the usual mundane brunch items, sturgeon caviar, lobster tails, Chilean sea bass, quality prime rib, and unlimited champagne. Honestly, even with all that, is it $55 better than the Bellagio Buffet's weekend champagne brunch at $30? Probably not.

Sure, you can go up to the caviar server 25 times and eat enough sturgeon caviar to put a dent in the world's sturgeon population, but then you have broken down a brunch experience into an economic ROI (return on investment) exercise and taken all the joy out of an entertainment endeavor.

So Sterling Brunch is good, and even somewhat unique, but it's not $85 good and it's not $55 better than Bellagio Buffet's weekend champagne brunch, which is the gold standard, in my opinion.

3952081,2017-04-07,2,5z1WIr7E9P2CSzyN5seeSA,"Oh Sterling Brunch, I wanted to love you, but you sorely disappointed me. 

My husband and brother-in-law came here on a Sunday afternoon. We showed up 10 mins early to our 1:00PM reservation that I booked over the phone. (I recommend calling bc sometimes OpenTable doesn't have an accurate count of the reservations available.) The hostess seated us at our table right at 1:00PM, which is a plus. The place is located in Bally's. 

Now let's talk about the important parts of the experience. 

FOOD 

The buffet had limited options. We tried the following: 

1. Lobster Tail: They're big, juicy and easy to eat. Out of the entire meal, this was by far my favorite item to enjoy at Sterling's. I didn't dip it in butter. I recommend topping it w/ caviar instead Yumm! 
2. Lobster Bisque: The bisque is creamy, but don't let it sit out too long or it'll get gross. Eat the soup right away or you'll be disappointed with it. 
3. Raw Oysters in a half shell: Not fresh at all and it had a weird taste to it. Could've been the season or we came too late and the good oysters were gone. (This place closes at 2:30 pm) 
4. Lamb: Tender and flavorful, especially when you add the mint julep jelly on top. 
5. Prime Rib: The outside is too salty (saltier than other steakhouses I've tried). The meat was tender. 
6. King Crab Legs: These things were huge and PRICKLY! It was so hard to crack these to get to the meat. Maybe I'm not a King Crab Leg type of gal. 
7. Cocktail Shrimp: Meh. It's good, but nothing special. 
8. Truffle Mashed Potatoes: DELICIOUS! It tasted amazing with the lamb and prime rib. 
9. Caviar: Tasty, not too salty and it went well with the lobster tail and bread. 
10. Filet Mignon with a butter sauce on top: The meat was perfectly cooked. :-) 
11. Desserts:  The portions were great for tasting. We tried them all. My favorite is the peanut butter one. Sorry I can't give you more insight on the desserts! 
12. Bottomless mimosas: The champagne is very dry so I recommend if you like a more sweeter champagne then you should get mimosas. You can get unlimited OJ and other refreshments as well. (They don't offer Coke; only Pepsi.) 

They also served sushi... that was questionable and looked dry. They were rice packed rolls with limited sushi grade fish inside. You're better off saving your stomach for the better tasting items like the lobster tail and bisque. 

PRICE 

For two people, it came out to $200 with a $40 tip = $240. I feel like I would've been happier with this price had I known what to foods to eat or stay away from. When you come here, make sure you drink PLENTY OF WATER so you can drink as much champagne w/o getting too intoxicated. Go for the Lobster tail, caviar, shrimp, lamb and prime rib FIRST. However, the food doesn't taste good when it's cold. 

I recommend grabbing two/three things at one time, then bring it back to the table to enjoy while it's warm. Then go up for another round. Don't grab everything at once! 

SERVICE 

This is the primary reason why I didn't enjoy Sterling. Our server had a very sarcastic and dry sense of humor. I'm not sure why he thought it was okay to keep telling me ""no"" when I asked for anything while still bringing me what I asked for... It's absurd. He didn't even smile to hint that he was joking each time he did it! He had a mean, aggravated look on his face. If he only did it a few times, then okay. 

BUT EVERY SINGLE TIME!!! 

I have a dry sense of humor. Sarcasm could be my middle name. BUT, there is a time and a place. 

This server seriously needed to be taught emotional intelligence. He didn't understand that the entire table was over his antics and ""humorous"" rudeness. If I ever come back here again, I will make sure to not get this server. 

When you're paying this much for a meal, you assume to have a good time. Not feel uncomfortable. 

Overall, I give this place 3-stars. The food is 4 stars, service is 2 stars and price is 3 stars. 

Happy Dining,

They are not sure if the Sterling Brunch will be continued.  Things seem to be in limbo right now.  About a month ago, I made a reservation on Open Table when I learned of the uncertain future.

I arrived a bit early but there was no problem.  I was seated quickly after the hostess checked by Total Rewards card.  There is a small reduction in price with the TR card.  She handed me off to a maître d' who escorted me to my table.  There I was introduced to my server, John, with whom I shared some laughs and comments and from whom I received superb service.

I wasn't there for the unlimited champagne which John was about to pour when I stopped him.  Instead, I asked him for some tomato juice.  He was back in a flash with a good sized glass of tomato juice.  I then made my first trip into the side room where the brunch is set up in chafing dishes on tables.  I found the one with the lobsters and got one.  I added to this a nice petit filet mignon and a lamb chop cut from a rack of lamb that was nicely rare.  The lobster tails (all four of them) were very good and quite good considering they had been grilled and were sitting in a chafing dish.  I was surprised by how tasty the filet was and how medium rare it was again given that it had been broiled and was in a chafing dish.

The second foray was for two more lobster tails and some caviar.  Now you know why I came to the Sterling Brunch.  It was the lobster but there was a good selection of brunch items besides the lobster.

My third trip was for another lobster tail.  I also got some jumbo peeled shrimp, a small amount of lox, and a half yellow tomato stuffed with crab salad.  My last two trips were for dessert to round out the experience.  The last dessert was a made to order fresh fruit crèpe with whipped cream, some more fruit and some chocolate sauce.

A few things about the buffet.  The butter for the lobster and crab is melted and kept in a teapot like container.  As needed, the worker fills the small jars with butter.  The butter should be a lot warmer than it is.  It should be stored in a heated compartment and we could get our own.  It's nice to pick up a glass and go but when it's below standard, that's not the best answer.

There was so much more that I could have tried.  I skipped all the sashimi, the salads for the most part, and some the breakfast foods.  After eating four lobster tails, there wouldn't be a lot of room for those frills.

One thing that marked the brunch was the outstanding service and attitude of the servers and bussers.  Everyone was efficient, polite, had a nice smile, and were very friendly.  If you got a made to order omelette, you didn't wait.  You got your other things and it's brought to your table.  That's just how they do things.

The steakhouse is a classic Las Vegas one.  Lots of wood, booths, and a couple of small tables like the one I was at.  I noted the amount of champagne that was being poured and I heard John tell another customer that they averaged over a bottle per person.

1 star = for the environment.  If you want to go to brunch in an old school Vegas atmosphere, I suggest you go to Sterling Brunch at Bally.  It has that feel good environment like you were living here in the olden days.

2 stars = Bottomless lobster tails; and big ones too!  If you love Lobster tails, then I highly recommend you come here.  It is seafood galore here, and there is quality you can definitely taste.  The brunch not only has lobster tails, but it has crab legs, king crab legs, huge shrimp, fresh oysters (and really fresh to taste), and yummy caviar served at the sushi station.  I like to cut up the lobster tail and put it in my lobster bisque; mmm so good!  

3 stars= Bottomless mimosas are a huge plus with real champagne, from Champagne, France!  

4 stars = Wait staff here, and the chefs behind the brunch bar are super nice and friendly.

5 stars = Breakfast.  Can't have brunch w/ out the breakfast.  They have belgian waffles, eggs benedict, eggs cooked the way you like, and other options that I'm sure will please anyone's taste buds!

Not to mention, they have a crepe station and will even add rum!  Dessert station is a little rusty with little selection, but from what little they have, tastes good!

This is a brunch you have to try if you come to Vegas.  Put it on your bucket list; you won't regret it!",ksYpOznbD-22wYpTiacHwA,8,4,5,U8aUxuTI8wRrSuLpwv5Svg

Sterling Brunch is gotta be one of my favorite buffets in all North America.  (Taiwan has some awesome ones but Yelp is not there yet)

Sterling Brunch is located in Bally's Las Vegas and is only available on Sundays from 9:00am - 2:00pm (Typically by reservations only but you may get lucky)  

They got the typical buffet fare ranging from various seafood, poultry, steaks, desserts.  Here's the list:

Seafood:  clam, mussels, salmon (sashimi/cooked), oysters, lobsters, fatty tuna, Uni, king crabs, and  Cavier!  (So the sashimi is flown in from Japan weekly, Lobster are baked half of a 1-2 lbs lobsters, and Cavier is all you can indulge!!!  with those little blintz to go with it! YUM!)

Poultry and Steaks (meat):  rosemary roasted chicken, prime rib, rack of lamb, filet mignon, beef wellington, Beef Oscar (fancy!)

Dessert:  lots of melt in your mouth heavenly desserts that you simply cannot miss out on any of it...

Extras:  Lobster omelet, Gazpacho soup, fresh fruits, other seafood prepared cooked such as seafood Bouillabaisse, etc...

Had my favorite server ""Eduardo""!  Awesome guy who worked at the Sterling Brunch for 30 years.... really nice guy who actually prepared us a seafood extravaganza on ice while we get our food!  Tipped Eduardo really good afterwards as he was like the best server we ever had!  (by the way you actually get 2 servers one helps you with everything else the other one make sure your drinks are always topped off perfectly!  Simply awesome!)

Of course.. with a meal like that.. it took us 3 hours to finish but of course that was enjoyed slowly....  Man.. lots of lost lobsters in my stomach and stuff.....Just way too much good stuff...........

Oh oh... get this.. while at Sterling I got this guy who was in front of me wanting Cavier... so when he got some from the nice little Japanese lady who was serving the fresh raw seafood he kept asking for more....The lady wasn't angry or anything but instead, took his plate, opened up a brand new like 120oz of cavier and literally slapped on top of the plate.... In a very nice way!!!  Everyone was floored when they saw that and the big man was a ""VERY"" happy customer....Seriously.. that Japanese lady was so nice she gave me a bunch of UNI after that as well!  LOL!  Shout out to Eduardo and Little Japanese lady...

Finally... forgot to mention... you want water... it's all Evian only.... FREE!  Then champagne is also complimentary.. which they served only Pierre Jouet!!!  WOW!!! I'm in heaven yelpers!!!  (That was also the reason why we were there for 3 hours.. had about 5 bottles of PJ for about $50 per bottle.....)

The cost is about $85 without Tax and tip.... but I'm telling you... BEST MEAL I'VE HAD EVER!!!!!!

Sterling Brunch.... I can't wait till the day we meet again..................",sys6XtOZVLDzwn3qistBKw,47,27,5,CS7nF-oSboidepsjvKE56A
4034840,2014-07-10,1,5z1WIr7E9P2CSzyN5seeSA,"When my wife and I visited Las Vegas last February, we were disappointed to learn that Bally's Steakhouse -- home to the epic Sterling Brunch -- was closed for renovations.  When we returned to the casino in July, we were curious about the changes that were made to the recently reopened restaurant.  ""How can you improve on excellence?"", we wondered aloud.  Well, Bally's nailed it.  The former Bally's Steakhouse has been rebranded as BLT Steakhouse and the upgrade shows.  The new configuration of the dining room is perfect for a brunch due to the addition of a dedicated serving area.  The finishes are clean, modern, and comfortable and add an openness to the space that was previously lacking. 

I didn't think they could improve on the food, but they did.  Delicious Nueske's Slab bacon was added to the carving station as well as a scrumptious chocolate-peanut butter mousse added to the dessert station.  The omelet bar was still turning out awesome eggs and the cold shellfish station was still a winner.  Of course, the Perrier Jouet champagne flowed freely and the service was impeccable, thanks to our server Diane.  Thanks, Bally's!  We'll certainly return to try dinner at the steakhouse!",ee_3Z8_pZJ3h4aBHdq3cpQ,4,0,5,oHo6pIzWN3pvb5dUElqWmg
4036470,2010-07-15,0,5z1WIr7E9P2CSzyN5seeSA,"this one def. lives up to its name and price. I went here sunday's regularly when i lived in vegas, and I now make sure to drop by the last day in town when visiting. The setting is a bit claustrophobic; however, the service is always grand/friendly and the buffet is classy. I personally fancy the small room b/c it omits the need for the awkward walk of shame back to the seat @ most buffets, but I have had some awkward, back-to-back chair-knocking issues here in the past.

Of note: try the cognac omelets, if they're on special, at the chef station. Whatever's on special, they never go wrong here. The lobster bisque here is good enough. 

Also, keep it light and stick to soft-shell crabs, etc., instead of filet mignon, etc.... unless you're obese or whatnot. Trust me, you'll fill up very fast, though it's easy to forget you're at a buffet. 

Last but not least, save room for dessert!!! They have amazing white chocolate ganaches, white choc.-covered strawberries and fruit tarts. I tend to eat equal parts dinner n dessert, lol. My fav. part of this meal is sipping on way too much champagne and catching up w/ pals above consuming a pound or 10 of dessert.",TwC9BUdIZ6KoqoQeL0RyKw,0,0,4,FYdbnF4UaoGwTPJu2YqF6g

4067908,2018-02-01,7,5z1WIr7E9P2CSzyN5seeSA,"For the last few years that I've been coming to Las Vegas, if I wind up staying on a Sunday, I will make sure to make a reservation at Sterling Brunch. During my recent January 2018 trip, I  ate there on Sunday January 28.

I arrived about 15 minutes early and checked in with my TotalRewards card. The lady in front asked me where I was staying and I mentioned that I wasn't staying at a Caesar's property. She told me that I could wait inside on the side or come back in ~15 minutes. I decided to wait inside. Unlike what happened ~2 years ago when I (and other patrons) arrived early, we weren't offered champagne while we waited. While I waited inside, there were people without reservations waiting to sit at the bar.

A few minutes after my reservation time of 9:30am, a guy called my name and led me to my seat.  The person who led me to my seat welcomed me back to Sterling Brunch (I guess they keep records) and mentioned his name along with the name of my server.

From there I was left alone for a few minutes as my server didn't show up to introduce himself or to fill my champagne flute or my juice glass or ask me if I wanted to order something from their menu. After waiting about 3 minutes, I decided to get up and get my food. For my 1st plate, I decided to go with a rack of lamb, 2 lobster tails, some crab, some caviar, and a piece of filet mignon. When I got back to my table, my champagne flute was still not filled nor was any water/juice provided to me. I forgot to mention that the restaurant was not very crowded at the time since my reservation was for 9:30am (opening time) and they were still seating customers.

While I ate, a server filled my champagne flute and someone passed by my table and asked me if I wanted orange juice. I answered yes. I asked him if I could have the Lobster Benedict and he mentioned that he would have one made for me. After I finished my first plate, I decided to go for my second plate which comprised of rack of lamb, filet mignon, lobster tail, two types of bacon (the type of bacon you can find in the frozen section of a grocery store and another type of bacon that must be carved/cut), caviar, shrimps, oyster, and crab claws. When I got to my table with my plate, there was my Lobster Benedict. The Lobster Benedict was very good.

While I was eating the items from my 2nd plate (~1 hour after I arrived), the service improved dramatically. I was having my champagne flute refilled regularly and it didn't sit empty for more than 1 minute (whereas during the 1st hour, there were times when my champagne flute sat empty for at least 5 minutes).

I had a few items from their dessert table. While I was having dessert, the server tried to fill my champagne glass and I motioned that I no longer wanted my champagne flute refilled. I asked him for something caffeinated and he asked if I wanted an expresso to which I answered yes. The expresso was very good so I asked for another one.

I asked for a soft drink at the end along with my bill and the server asked me if I wanted my soft drink to go and I said that if it was to go that would be great, otherwise I didn't have an issue finishing it at the table. He mentioned that he would put it in a plastic cup to go.

The bill was $113.66 ($105+$8.66 tax). The previous 3 times that I was at Sterling Brunch, I tipped above 20%. During the 1st hour of my meal, I felt like tipping under 10% since I was virtually ignored for the 1st hour but because the service improved dramatically during the 2nd hour, I increased the amount of my tip to above 10% but far below my usual tip. I was going to say something at the end to the server who took my money regarding my tip amount being what it was because I wasn't overly impressed with the service but I didn't so he probably thought that I didn't know what the percentage the tip ""should"" be or that I was a cheap tipper.

I'm not sure who my server was for the 1st hour since different people were refilling my champagne flute & juice glass when they got around to it but Sergio was the name of the server on my receipt and he was very attentive/helpful during the 2nd hour since I asked him for his name before I left. He wasn't serving me during my 1st hour at Sterling Brunch.

The service that I received today wasn't on par with what I've received in the past (the person who showed me to my table mentioned the name of my server but the server didn't introduce himself at the beginning and during the 1st hour, I didn't know who my server was since I saw many servers passing by my table while my champagne flute and juice glass were empty, my champagne flute and juice glass at times were empty for over 5 minutes, I wasn't asked if I wanted to order something from the menu, I wasn't given a popover bread, didn't pick up my finished plates when I went to get another plate, was not given a bowl for my shells, etc.)

Giving them 3 stars this time instead of what I gave them in the past (4 & 5 stars).",b39IckHDyVLVSGYhy6Sszg,13,7,3,PkHrXXJAjZfJnsDUbk_aiA
4082581,2012-12-11,4,5z1WIr7E9P2CSzyN5seeSA,"What a screwing this trip was!  I wanted to take my wife to a first class brunch, so we (I) decided that even at $85., it would be worth it to go to the Sterling Brunch.  Boy was I wrong!!  It started with our arrival at 11:20 AM for our 11:30 reservation (I had made reservations in October, 2012).  There was a big long line.  I went to the hostess, and was told get in line.....it doesn't matter if you have reservations.  I wanted to leave, but couldn't recall if I'd guaranteed my reservation with a credit card, so I stayed in line.  At noon, we were taken to our seats, and waited on, but not well.  We got our champagne from Eduardo who kept us in champagne all day, but no one directed us to the buffet, or anywhere else for that matter.  Once at the buffet, the food was generally just OK.  The cold shrimp were good, but the broiled lobster tail was as chewy as a rubber ball.....a charred rubber ball.  And just a bit tastier.  The deserts were awesome, but not awesome enough to save this trip to brunch at Bally's.  We're never going back to Sterling.  It was a $49.99 experience at best.

p.s. I'd never heard of a Groupon until yesterday, and I still didn't know what a Groupon is really, but apparently everyone had one in the big long line.......except us.  We got treated like a Grouponer, except with the check......that was full strength.  I don't care to play the coupon game, in part because of silly BS lines, rules, exceptions, etc.  

p.p.s.  Had to self park.  Valet full.  BS for an expensive trip to what is supposed to be a classy brunch.",X29qamD7GDb3cukb6GPl6Q,3,0,1,0vSfB_vWN0D5oJ1wz9vENQ
4129525,2011-01-01,11,5z1WIr7E9P2CSzyN5seeSA,"I'm a fan, indeed. Especially of the fancy schmancy Perrier-Jouet champagne that kept on going and going. So, for those not in the know, this is a Sunday morning only brunch buffet at Ballys, and it comes with quite the pricetag: $85 per person (about $110/person after tax, tip and such). ...and it's by reservation, so you've gotta plan ahead.

And it is pretty fancy schmancy in there. Not in the modern, Wynn/Encore sorta way, but in the 1955 sorta way.. with waiters in white dinner coats and green striped wallpaper. The food selection is supposed to be amazing, and I concur (mostly), it wasn't bad.

Despite what my profile may say about lobster, the lobster here was actually my favorite thing. ...or maybe it was just the butter I doused it in. Either way, it was one tasty dish. I also tried caviar for the first time, and it wasn't bad, but nothin' to write home about. 

There were crab claws, but not crab legs. There's filet mignon that you can get from the tray, but I recommend asking your waiter for them to cook some to order for you. Other than that, I had some delicious lamb chops, a delish pretzel roll and some pretty decent dessert. 

The real highlight is the service. Even though the buffet is self-serve, our waiter was ON it. I never had an empty champagne glass, and he gladly got our filet mignons to order. 

The ultimate test though... would I go again? Nope. It was worth an experience, but I'm pretty sure I'm just as satisfied (and probably because I'm not a huge lobster fan) with the Spice Market or Wynn buffets.",1vXJWH7L0IMEz5-8aU3SOA,23,14,4,O_pApMnjzpVO1JHLZpqrYw

It was not a holiday. It was not overly crowded or under staffed. There is no excuse. It just sucked and here's why:

1. We Had to wait 20 minutes with a reservation for two people. Just 2. No offer of refreshment while we waited. 

2. Lobster was terrible. All of it was over cooked and rubbery. Even the drawn butter was bad. I had to ask for a spoon the times (never from our waiter... He wasn't too be found anywhere) only to discover the Lobster bisque was the worst ever... And it was also the sauce for the lobster ravioli... Which contained no lobster that we could find. The bisque or the ravioli. 

3. After 15 minutes, my husband went and got our two bloody Mary's from the bar directly. Our waiter had forgotten we asked for them and never noticed we had gotten them ourselves. They sucked. All pepper and very little tomato juice or vodka. 

4. Orange juice was not freshed squeezed. For $99 per person... Seriously. I'm pretty sure it's Tropicana. I was expected to mix my own Mimosas. Sigh.

5. The desserts were lackluster at best. How does one screw up chocolate cake? It wasn't sweet. At all. 

6. Sarcastic waiter that only showed up on rare occasion. Lovely. Just lovely. The only time he showed up promptly was when he dropped the bill off at the table.

7. The champagne was good and flowed freely. But I could have bought a half case of it and a good meal for what we spent. And the self mixing of my Mimosas is annoying at best.

""Huh, did he just say SCIZO?""  - YES I DID.
Did I just pay $75 for a freaking buffet? - YES I DID.
Did I get a recommendation from other Yelpers prior - YES I DID.

Anyway, back to the story: The Sterling Brunch is one of those hidden gems in Vegas that not a lot of people know about.  It occurs only once per week on Sunday and it is cleverly hidden inside the Steak House so those buffet trotting families will remain none-the-wiser.  Most of the customers proudly displayed their ""Britishness"" by thoroughly challenging every normal word while still speaking English-proper.

As soon as you walk in you feel like you are in a classy place.  The Maître d' is dressed in an all black tux with a matching bow-tie.  We came in shorts and T-shirts and it was admittedly overwhelming at first.  That is, until you noticed that EVERYONE else was casual as well.  (OK so now you see why it is SCIZO?).

Of course, everyone here just wants to know about the food.  Honestly, for a buffet its pretty good.  But, I either LOVED or HATED whichever dish I got.  The Encrusted Chillean Sea Bass, Caviar, Perrier Jouet champagne, Crab claws, and desserts were primo in my books.  However, I found the lamb shanks, top sirloin strips, and Alaskan King Crab legs to be sub par for a buffet of this type.  The sushi was much better at Makino on Decatur so don't even bother.  Was it worth it?  YES - the champagne and caviar alone justified the expense.  Oh, and if you haven't tried ""Nagasaki"" saki you might want to give it a try as it was very drinkable.  However, I remain amused that some marketing guy would name the drink after a city that we bombed - how intelligent.

SERVICE: AAA, but you still had to get your own food (remember - it is a buffet).  I did, however, have a slight peave that they ended the buffet at 2:30 promptly and asked us to leave by 4:00 pm.  A few of my buddies and I were just looking to hang around and make good conversation but everyone working just wanted to end their shifts.  Completely understandable and possibly even our fault - but it did ruin the evening nonetheless.  So be forewarned - get there early.

VERDICT: If you have an ADD personality, love caviar and champagne, and can put up with a few nuances it is DEFINITELY an experience worth trying.  

If you've ever spent a week on the gorge-fest of a boat Celebrity Cruise Lines you'll be sorely disappointed at the Sterling Buffet.

If you think $75 is a lot of money for lunch then go to the Wynn buffet... you'll spend half as much and still think it was expensive.",3-onpMy1GXPYZ-ruhvT5UQ,0,2,4,JWF0jskWO0YSUlFMUnDtBg

I told myself that I would eat three lobster tails, but I just had to try everything and got full fast.  The sea bass was a great surprise. It was cooked perfectly and the sauce was wonderful.  My husband doesn't like seafood and was very happy with the other choices, though thought my hollandaise ( on the eggs benedict)  is much better :).  The croissant french toast was to die for.I'm not sure how I feel about the tipping stations, as the buffet was very expensive in itself.  My tip would be to get the lobster, filet and sides and plate them as if you were at a restaurant.  I think I would have enjoyed it more than eating each out of the little dishes.

Lobster tails are perfectly cooked and seasoned and just need a dab of drawn butter for an orgasmic experience.

I couldn't get a reservation for my hubby and me, but we were lucky that we got seated at the bar without having to wait at all. The service was pretty good. Both bartenders working there were very nice and attentive. 

The food section was really small and somewhat disappointing. The lobsters were hit and miss -- for the first round, I got two lobsters along with caviar, crab legs and lobster bisque, both lobsters were cooked to just right. Though they needed a bit of seasoning, they were pretty tasty. But the third one that I got later was way overcooked and rubbery. Everything else that I tried was also somewhat over cooked, except for the lobster ravioli, it was delicious.

For drinks, I got champaign and orange juice, thinking to make some mimosa. Unfortunately, the OJ that they served wasn't good, which kind of spoiled it.

To be honest, I am glad we did this brunch but I probably won't come back. It's kind of like a bucket list thing where you can tell people that you've done it but you probably wouldn't waste time or money on it again.

The service was a little slow. My diet coke was never re-filled and when I asked my server (I will not name her publicly), she said ""sure, it'll just be a while though."" What does that mean? ""A while"" turned into never. It's a buffet and they had bussers clearing tables so how was she that busy that she couldn't grab a diet coke?

Anyway, food was okay- lobsters were good but not great, prime rib was well-done even though I asked for a medium/medium-rare piece, the filet mignon was chewy, and the desserts were lacking and the display looked dirty and messy.

The best part about this entire buffet was the king crab legs- my husband cracked one for me (I don't like to get crab juice all over myself so I usually opt out of crab legs) and it was so meaty and so fresh! It was absolutely delicious and worth every penny. I dare say that the crab legs were better than the lobster tails!

Reasons for star reduction:
1) oysters looked disgusting. yes it was nice that it was offered and i would have been eat ting them up. but these look like they'd make you sick and they didn't look fresh at all
2) lobster wasn't coming out fast enough. there was always a 10-15 minute wait to get to the lobster! which wastes your precious eating time
3) the dining room is separated. they use two restaurants to house the sterling brunch. the steakhouse and another restaurant. we got sat in the other one, i think it was Italian. so we had to walk pretty far to get to the food. i was quite disappointed with this
4) had to wait 15 minutes with a reservation when the waiting list without one was 15-20 minutes. whats the point of the reservation? and we still got a crappy seat

Why its at least 4 stars
1) the lobster, when you actually got it it was fab.
2) champagne was unlimited and Delicious. a bit slow on the refills but still nice to have. and when he did refill he only gave me half a glass even when i asked for a full glass. i thought that was rude.
3) they had chocolate cover strawberries as dessert- MY FAV!
4) lamb was good and not super gamey 
5) shrimp cocktail
6) caviar by request 

overall. i feel like they didn't refill the foods fast enough. there was always a wait for something and the setup of the food made it so that the line for the lobster [at the end] block all the other foods [crab legs prime rib]

super excited to go and thoroughly disappointed. even the desserts weren't refilled that quick.

not worth $85 bucks

The brunch is at the BLT Steak house inside the Ballys Casino on Sundays. It isn't a huge area so the buffett isn't too crowded.

Waking up still drunk from the essential heavy drinking and dancing, I also woke up to the drunk munchies which lead me to Sterling Brunch. 85 washingtons, and all worth it.

Service:

I love how they offer champagne @ the entrance. With some champagne re-fueling my party tank, we were seated immediately with napkins placed on our laps & all.

Service was spectacular of course. The waiters were a lot more personable here. Very cool of them to joke around with us, or maybe knew we were intoxicated.. Glad they brought their sense of humor with them to brunch... either ways, brunch here was fun and elegant. There are also chefs manning each cutting table, and a lot of staff discretely running in and out of the kitchen refreshing the very popular seafood and egg dishes, respectively.

Foooooood:

This is why it cost 85 dollars a pop. 

The quality of the food is seriously top notch. No joke about it. Fresh Oysters, Quality cut meats, Lobster, and many MANY more! The buffet is not extraordinarily huge, but the finite selection offered is seriously the top tier of foods available in vegas. The eggs benedict, baked or broiled lobster, shrimp cocktail and filet mignon seems to be the most popular. But don't forget the HUGE dessert bar.

Game time: Arrived at Ballys for 11:30 AM reservations.  Waited at standing-only cocktail table to be seated, almost took til 12 PM.  We sat down at our table (set for 2, we had 4 in the party) in the ""VIP"" section and were ignored for 20+ minutes.  Tons of staff walked by but the servers kept telling us our waiter was in the back and would be out very shortly.  In that time, a server brought the table settings for the other 2 people.  The other servers saw our frustration (or my impatience rather) and finally filled up our water and champagne glasses, and offered orange juice - the table ordered 3 juices and a busser brought them out.  Bloody Marys are also included (Eric had one).

We sat so we could give our server the groupons, but he never came so finally the other server who gave us drinks told us to go eat.  I went to the cold section first.  The buffet is rather small compared to other buffets on the strip though it costs retail 3-4 times more.  We had just been to the M and thought $40 was high and their selection is quite large.  Here, there is a teeny sushi counter and you have to ask for each piece, which is uncomfortable.  I got 2 spicy tuna roll pieces and 2 pieces of tako nigiri.  Then I asked for caviar (it is not offered verbally to you there), got my blini and condiments, and moved on.  I got smoked salmon and some oysters (pretty large) and some goat cheese and toasts.  That was my first round.  When I got to the table, the server who brought table settings admitted he was our server and apologized for the wait, claiming he brought the orange juice that the busser brought before he showed up...hmmm.  Eric asked for a bread basket and off he went.

The food was good - they had pretzel rolls in the basket.  I mostly had goat cheese+smoked salmon+caviar+condiments with the bread and blini and toasts to start.  The oysters I had were really good with a squeeze of lemon.  Then I went for hot food - my friends had seen duck but when I went there they were out - the chef said they had to go find duck at the Paris and bring it back?  I got the very last lamb chop at the cutting board (keep in mind they are open til 3?) then got a beef sope to share with Eric (sope tough, beef delicious and spicy).  The lamb chop I got was sooo delicious and actually cooked (I had a raw one at Caesars Bacchanal - see pic I posted on that page)!  The breakfasty stuff did not appeal to me so I went back for more of the caviar, smoked salmon, and sushi.  Then, for dessert I had a bananas foster crepe (yummy) and the whipped cream was vanilla scented and tasty.

I then got up to go to the bathroom outside of the restaurant.  When I came back, my friends acquired me some duck that magically appeared (very tasty) and Eric R. said he saw the sushi chef with a plate of sashimi hidden behind the counter that she was only sharing with certain guests.  He had to ask for it since it was not on display - this is a bit sketchy to me.  He ended up with 2 pieces each of tuna, salmon, and yellowtail which was cut very generously, and he shared a little with me.  I wish they had offered that all along!  The whole set up of the sushi/caviar area seemed restricted and made me feel a bit awkward asking for each thing, but it was really 1/4th of the savory items available.

In the end, this was definitely a once in a lifetime experience - definitely pricey for the small buffet even with the groupon - I suppose people feel it is worth it to pay for the Perrier-Jouet champagne.  It was neat to come here (and see Eric happy with lobster tails and my friends happy with king crab legs and snow crab claws, etc.) but the options are limited.  The service also was a bit frustrating since it seemed everyone got waited on but us at the beginning, and from reservations to being seated to getting some service took probably around 45 minutes.  We did tip on the retail amount.  Women get a long stemmed rose on the way out of the restaurant, and men get a handshake.  No one rushed us from the table to finish though, so that was good.  

Post-game: Walked the strip for over 4 hours after the meal, showing our friends 7 more properties since one had never been to Vegas.",T5KBc5QbwZ-Oj9ApE4vZJA,8,2,3,kLfSVE6eIS2mH9wJTbSB3Q

4588053,2014-09-18,12,5z1WIr7E9P2CSzyN5seeSA,"So brunch buffets are as synonymous with Las Vegas as Lebron is to basketball, and there is a whole lot of winning going on at the Sterling Brunch in the Bally's Hotel and Casino. Tucked in the back of the ground floor of Bally's in the BLT Steak restaurant rests one of the newest, and I will say it, finest brunch buffets in Las Vegas.

Now it isn't called the ""Sterling"" Brunch for no reason, it costs, it costs big time.

Most of us are not willing to pay $90 per person for brunch, but because of the high quality of seafood, meats and champagne that they serve, I must admit, the price tag is justified. I usually avoid buffets in general as quantity is NOT what gets me hard, it's the quality, and the Sterling Brunch has both.

When you are seated you are immediately served two Gruyere popovers. For those of you who are new to popovers, as I was, they are an American version of English Yorkshire pudding. They are baked custard in muffin tins, but the inside is not dense, it is very light and moist. It was pretty insane. It was as if the crispy shell was basted for hours with liquefied cheese as the flavor of the Gruyere was wonderfully powerful. Slather some sea-salted butter on the inside and you are ready to party.

As a start for brunch, or any meal for that matter, it doesn't get better than this.

Next up was the buffet. On my first round I focused solely on seafood, the options were far and wide in this category alone. Baked lobster tail, King crab legs, crab claws, jumbo shrimp, oysters, and crab cakes.

Um, yes.

Out of all of them I recommend the baked lobster tail and the King crab legs the most, the quality of them were excellent and the flavors were good and rich. Skip the crab cake. It will take up too much valuable real estate; not to mention it kinda blows.

Now the offering of caviar is one of the major reasons this brunch stands out. That, and the unlimited Perrier-Jouet Grand Brut champagne (a $50/bottle value). Though the caviar is American Amia (bowfin roe from Louisiana), which, though quiet common and inexpensive, is still a buffet rarity and presented with blinis, crème fraiche, capers and finely diced red onion so you feel, well, spoiled. Regardless.

Egg me, baby.

The caviar is just one of the many items offered on their menu outside of the buffet options. We ordered the Caesar salad, tuna tartar, the lobster eggs Benedict and the lobster bisque; the bisque was a bit more like a bouillabaisse but still yummy.

Now, they also offer filet mignon, truffled mashed potatoes and creamed spinach as well as lamb chops so one can get their steakhouse on.

I sampled them as a dessert substitute because, well, I've always been more of a salt guy than a sugar dude. But alas my stomach could hold no more, but if one were so inclined, and has a larger stomach muscle than my own, feel free to polish off those dishes as well because they are good times.

Adeye took the trip down Dessert Ave.  It's one of the prettiest avenues I have seen and she seemed very pleased.

Sterling Brunch. You have raised the brunch bar so high we could barely get our legs and bellies over it. Congratulations for redefining the Vegas buffet for those of us who care about quality.",QNfNB6InG2TY48uD7hbIgg,17,9,4,nH1UUJ32TySeduqkqP5WPg

My favorite points about this brunch:  1)  high quality and delicious food (I despise having a plethora of choices just to find out that the food sucks - uh Wicked Spoon); 2) great quality champagne; 3) smooth, discreet and professional service; 4) the intimate and unhurried ambiance of the place, despite the fact that it is a buffet.

For the quality of the food, drinks and service, I think the price of this buffet is a value!

It was completely booked the day we went, but luckily the 2 of us were able to get seated at the bar where the full menu is available. We started with unlimited Perrier-Jouët Champagne (Bloody Mary's were also offered). Then onto the buffet portion...
 ? Jumbo sized shrimp cocktail
 ? Oysters
 ? Crab legs
 ? Lobster tails (must get!)
 ? Prime rib
 ? Filet mignon with herb butter 
 ? Lamb chops (a tad overcooked)
 ? Thick cut slab bacon
 ? Truffle mashed potatoes (perfect accompaniment to the proteins)
 ? And.... CAVIAR. American Sturgeon Caviar to be exact (which I put on everything and totally made this so worth it!)

There were a few more options I didn't get to try since I didn't want to fill up on that, but it did sound delicious for next time: popovers, lobster bisque, lobster benedict, omelettes, etc. The dessert selection was pretty good too.

We have tasted fresh seafood before, having been on road trips across the country. The most fresh tasting seafood was the restaurant across the Atlanta Georgia aquarium at 80$ for two included lobsters, crabs, oysters, and clams. 

Needless to said we did not enjoy our brunch. Crabs were too salty and dry, oysters were tasteless and Lobsters were mushy. The lobsters ruined our appetite. We barely finish one lobster.

Ambience: poor. flickering fluorescent light in one of the area
Seafood: meh. all the other hotel buffets are so much better/fresher. friend got sick after
Hot food: meh again. 
Dessert: small selection and C quality compared to all the other buffets (Wynn, Belagio, etc)

i have no clue why anyone would go here when there's Wynn all those yummy buffets at half the price. The people who gave this place 4 or 5 stars seriously are not foodie's and must NOT have had the good buffets in vegas (or even just a nice brunch at Bouchon at Venetian!)

Upon arrival, there was no line, but the hostess seemed as if we were being rude by showing up an hour early for our reservation.  They said that they could seat us in the side overflow section immediately, and since I didn't know any difference, we agreed.  

The Food:  The food met most of my expectations.  Luxurious ingredients with no limit.  My lobster tail was overcooked, but my friend said his second tail, which he picked up right when they replenished the serving tray was perfect.  They had a made to order omelette and crepe station.   The sushi station was nice, but the fish was just ok.  My favorite items were the shrimp in the shrimp scampi (the pasta was over cooked, but the shrimp were plump and cooked perfectly), the lamb chops on the carving station, and the cavier which I decadently ate with everything.  The cold station was a bit of a disappointment (the stone crab claws were not good), but the desserts looked beautiful. 

The Service:  There were 2 waiters in our section, and i don't think more than 5-7 tables that were filled (about half the room), but for some reason they seems overwhelmed.  We didn't get any attention for a long time.  I had read that they constantly refill your drinks, and that the service was impeccable, but we were sitting there for a good 5-10 minutes with empty glasses trying to catch the eye of a waiter.  I'm not sure if it was because we were in the overflow room.  I noticed other tables had baskets of bread/pastries, but we were never offered any.  And I heard from another diner that there was a vodka bar somewhere but we were never offered any.  Having paid what we did, I expected the servers to be much more attentive, so all in all, that was a disappointment.  

Overall:  The price is high for a buffet. Even though the food items were all luxury items, I felt like the preparation could have been better.  I would have rather spent the money to go to a nicer sit down restaurant.  The all you can drink is good, but would have been better if the servers were more on top of it.

We heard about the Sterling Brunch from that cheezy Food Network show.  You know, the one where that dopey guy and that irritating woman who looks like a soccer mom on crystal meth travel around the US eating their way into insanity.  We saw the show and became brainwashed like the rest of America.  We're ashamed, and we admit it.

Fortunately for us though, Sterling Brunch turned out to be a sweet find.  Soccer mom and dopey dude really found a gem here which is not an easy thing to do in Vegas, the land of endless buffets, fine food, and excess.

What makes this buffet so different?  My friend, if you have to ask then you are not worthy.  We'll let others on this forum describe the food and just say that the quality is top-notch.

The setting is in a space usually occupied by the steakhouse at Bally's.  Dark hardwood surrounds you and waiters in tuxedos tend to you with offerings of mimosas (using good quality champagne) and cloth napkins.  The best part of this brunch is that the irritating hillbilly tourist families are usually turned away by the price ($65 per person).  That's right folks!  You won't have some bratty snot covered 2 year old running up and down the aisles chasing her flea-infested brother.  Nope, the people here are actually somewhat presentable.

Make sure to secure reservations in advance as walk-ins were turned away when we went.  Also, the Sterling Brunch only happens on Sundays, so you'll be mightily disappointed if you show up at their door on say a Tuesday morning looking for fine grub.

4812179,2017-07-17,0,5z1WIr7E9P2CSzyN5seeSA,"My girlfriend and I jokingly made reservations two months ago after watching the Buzzfeed episode about it. When the weekend of our reservation came up, we decided to just say ""fuck it"" and go. My girlfriend ended up driving 9 hours round trip that day for a two hour brunch. Was it worth it? Probably not with the driving, but we had a great time celebrating our 6 month anniversary. Anyways, the food:

First on the champagne, I guess I'm not as big a fan of champagne as I thought. My girlfriend loved it though and I guess from what everyone else says, it is pretty quality. Orange juice was good. Onto the food: I tried a little of almost everything. There isn't a huge selection as many other reviews have noted, but when the offerings are all some of the most expensive things one can eat, there isn't much to complain about. For the seafood offerings, it wasn't the best time of the year to be eating oysters and lobster, but everything still tasted pretty good. The shrimp were too fishy smelling imo and the oysters weren't great, but the lobster and crab were. The lobster can be sort of hit or miss in terms of how well it's cooked (rubbery or overcooked), but overall A+ for me. They offer a pretty wide selection of meats as well; my favorites were the prime rib and lamb. While they do have filet mignon, it's only cooked medium (I guess this is just because most people want it medium??) which in my book is a crime. It was still good, but it could have been so much better if it was medium rare! The lamb with mint jelly and prime rib and horseradish were both very good though. My girlfriend loved the salmon and chicken dishes as well. Some other assorted things we got were the pumpkin ravioli, fresh fruit, caviar and desserts. Ravioli was good (a little rich), fruit was delicious and desserts weren't that amazing in taste, but did look very pretty! It was our first time trying caviar and we both liked it a lot haha. 

Finally on service, we didn't interact much with our waittress, but she was very cheerful and nice when she came by. Lots of good vibes! We were always topped off on champagne and never waited long for anything.

Literally it will take you only 5 seconds walking from the first dish to the last dish they display on the counter. 

Don't get me wrong, they do serve fancy dishes, such as lobsters, crab claws, prime rib but the quality does not match the price tag. The lobsters that we had during first two rounds were not fully cooked, we told our server when he picked up our dishes (he could also see that the lobster meat was transparent - not cooked). He apologized and brought us couple lobster pieces, without us asking (Very kind of him, I wish I remember his name!) but this time, the lobster was overcooked and rubbery. 

We also tried the raw oyster on half shelves, they didn't do a good job opening them because small pieces of shell were all over the oysters. Plus, they were prepared at an earlier time so the oysters were dry as they had been sitting in the fridge for awhile. I knew because I saw the guy behind the counter took them out from the fridge to refill the plate. What a disappointment.  

Crab claws were good but they were impossible to fail.

We do enjoy the champagne, we have always been a PJ fans. That's the only good part of our dining experience. 

Oh, almost forgot to mention. A staff walked around the restaurant to give out red roses to female customer at the end of the buffet hour, out of the few roses she has left in her hand, she chose to give me one that's already dead. My husband and I had a good laugh out of it. We left it on the table, next to the matching look strawberries (that were freezer-burned).

I really wish I wasn't so hungover so I could have enjoyed it to the fullest but none the less the buffet was still delicious! 

We started with the seafood which was what really drew us here.. The oysters were fresh, the shrimp were plump, the crab claws were good and easy to open! The smoked salmon was delicious.. However the lobster was a tad overcooked but nothing a little budda budda couldn't  solve.. I wish they sliced open the king crab legs for you since they are so hard to crack open..Some pieces were a little on the salty side but still good. I liked adding big chunks of lobster into the lobster bisque.. And If you go to the mini sushi bar ask the chef for some caviar, my dining partner, fellow Yelper (Chingoo L) really enjoyed the caviar even though it was quite fishy.. Well what else would you expect from fish eggs...? Haha 

The stand out dish for me was the lamb... Omg it was delicious!!! Not gamey at all and it had a little sweet crust to it! soooo soooo good!!!! 

I feel like the dessert section was not that impressive.. It looked better in the pictures... When we were standing in line for creme brûlée the chef made it fresh for the man in front of us and when we got to the front she just pointed at one that had been chilling there... & there's nothing worse than creme brûlée that has a soft top... HMPH 

As for service our server was very nice sometimes it took a little too long for our drinks to get to the table but he constantly kept our champagne flutes filled to brim ;))) 

I think the best part of this brunch was the drinks! They have a Bloody Mary bar up front that is made with either Grey Goose or Belvedere... The champagne is Perrier Jouët from France, the orange juice is freshly squeezed with a nice pulp, their expresso is strong, they have Zipang sake shots at the sushi bar and they even serve ""Artesian water"" in cool bottles HAHA and all these drinks are included with your meal... TOO BAD I WAS SO HUNGOVER THOUGH... By the end of the meal I had 6 glasses of different beverages on our table  ... Lol 

I don't think I could ever pay the full price of $90/person.. And I guess they don't do local's discounts anymore.. So I'm so happy we got a Groupon deal for $98 for two people ~!!! I would probably get that deal again if it ever came up..

The king crab legs are humongous, larger than Bellagio and way larger than the small snow crab legs at Bacchanal. They serve grilled lobster that is lightly seasoned which is perfect. The lobsters are huge too so they definitely didn't skimp there. The rack of lamb is tender and juicy, cooked to around medium. The prime rib and filet were well cooked and seasoned. They have other stuff too but this is the stuff you want to be getting at these buffets.

Their dessert selection is not as diverse as Bellagio or Bacchanal but it's quite good and I love that they have a bowl of fresh berries as well. 

All in all, the price tag is worth it if you come ready to eat.",uixrruAoaeZbxRcEEK8kUw,2,2,5,I5EeE0PDLCBCNGhKQJ2FLQ

the fact that they have lobster and caviar with all the fixins says enough.

i imagined a grand room with a massive buffet... but no. this place is small and cozy.  the buffet is efficient and to the point.  no chow mein pasta paella international filler crap like all the other buffets.  just straight up good stuff.  

but when i went, the prime rib wasnt all that much better than the wynn. the duck was just good. and the sushi was medioce at best.

not one single thing was bad or below average.

if you can eat.  this is the place for you.  

if you're like me.. cant eat too much heavy food or pass out after A beer  (1 beer is like a roofie to me)  this place is not for you.

but you have to try it at least once right?

They have lobsters that are halved and decently sized (and they aren't the flat lobster either). Usual with prime rib, lamb (was very good though), and I forget what other meats. The oysters and caviar are probably what I stacked up on the most. The oysters were delicious! I also liked the crab claws, all meat without the work.

Don't get me started on desserts... who's not a dessert fan? They were beautiful and delicious.

The main differences is that I had the lobster Benedict with hollandaise in 2016. This review is based on my visit December 17, 2017. This time I had a filet Benedict with bernaise (magnificent). One other thing I had that was different is a lobster, cognac and boursin omlette. You really have to try this!
The rest of the meal was very similar to 2016. I had intended to try different things but what I had the first time was just so good! This meal consisted of; succulent king crab legs and lobster tails (I had 2), the best oysters on the half shell of my trip, black cavier with blinis and creme fraiche and red onions, excellent medium rare prime rib and rack of lamb and sushi. To drink, I started with a perfect bloody Mary and then bottomless glasses of Perrier Jouet. With the sushi I had sake. The good news - everything above is included in the price.

Our server, Scott, made sure our champagne glasses were never empty and our plates were always cleared (there were plenty of empty plates with piles of crab legs and lobster shells).  The selection is definitely the top of the line, there were huge shrimps and delicious caviar.  The herb crusted lamb chops were definitely the best I've ever had.

4991137,2011-11-15,1,5z1WIr7E9P2CSzyN5seeSA,"Unfortunately my experience at the Sterling Brunch was not stellar. 

Reservation/arrival: booking the reservation over the phone was pretty straightforward..until the agent TOLD me that she was going to put me on hold, half way through the booking? Thanks for asking! Checking in at the restaurant was pretty swift, we were seated within a few minutes. 3 stars here for what I would expect at a 3 star restaurant.

Food: the food selection is just like all the other reviews: caviar, lobster, lamb, prime rib... Etc. (ran out of oysters when I was there at 11 am). However, the food taste was mediocre at best. There wasn't anything where I felt was a must have. I would avoid the sushi, they were not freshly made and didn't look too fresh either. 4 stars here, best food selection in town, NOT prepared by gourmet chefs.

Service: I am very particular with service, but here's what I felt: I felt like our server Jason needed some elegance training courses. When we arrived, he immediately introduced himself and asked if we wanted champagne (yes!!). The ladies got their food and came back, I then got food and came back, but none of our drinks were here! When he finally returned, he did this back and forth act where he would reach across the table and pour some in each cup while waiting for the bubbles to settle. This caused the champagne to spill each time (due to lack of coordination) and simply looked bad. The back and forth thing went on for the rest of the meal. It took another 10 minutes to clear the extra set of plate settings that were on the table when we arrived. A bit into dining, I asked for a mimosa. He simply took my half DRANK orange juice and poured it into my half DRANK champagne... right in front of me. If restaurant management ever reads this.. Please!! Bring the customer a new glass! We also got the snow crab legs with a plate full of other food at some time, the legs were impossible to open by hand. We finished all the other food on the plate and finally had to ASK Jason for a crab leg cracker. 

When I attempted to get lamb at the chef station, the chef was busy chatting with another staff member 10 feet from the station. When he finally turned his attention to me, he asked me what I wanted and then started chatting with another staff member! He finally remembered to serve me and then apologized ""for getting distracted"". This also happened to my girlfriend when she tried to get some lamb.  Later on, my girlfriend also saw the manager and some staff arguing by the cold selection about melting ice? So unprofessional! 2 stars for the service, only because 1 star is saved for a mega disaster experience.

Overall, it did not meet my $85 expectations. Food selection was great, food quality was ok, service seriously sucked.",2JDWKHpR0g4QA4MHmFDprg,2,3,3,1ZODL-D6y33BfOzSJbvKWw

Occasion:  Sunday Champagne brunch with daddy and little brother
Party of:  Three
Location:  Inside the Sterling Steakhouse.  Antiquated decor. Cute little servers running around in their tuxes.  Clean and well-set up food stations.
Ordered:  All you can eat/drink
Total incl gratuity: ~$320

After so much hype from my dad, it was finally time for me make my way to the highly acclaimed Sterling Sunday Brunch at Bally's.  The pricetag is a little high but it includes all you can eat and drink champagne.  I can't drink that much so I only finished off one glass of champagne. Disappointing...I know!   However, I can definitely pack down the food!  Seven lobster tails later, I was still stuffing myself with soup, waffles, prime rib, etc. :) 

The selection of fine foods is impressive.  They serve lobster tails, and I mean lobster tails.  Not that dinky crawfish or mini-lobster they serve at some other buffets.  I'm talking roasted, chunky, delicious lobster tails.  What's also brilliant?  They serve lobster bisque!  You grab a lobster tail, shred up a few bites, and toss it into the bisque.  Makes for a wonderfully delicious little starter.  The amount of food they serve here is not vast however they focus on quality.  It's well thought out and of course, well organized.  The interior room is where they house their salads, fruits, cheeses, and  iced seafood station, which included chilled oysters, shrimps, smoked salmon, mussels, stone crab claws, and sturgeon caviar.  I seriously couldn't get enough of the caviar.  It was delicious.  Not overly salty like some I've had previously.  I must have eaten my $85 worth alone in caviar! :)

In the main room, you can find a row of breakfast foods. Crisp strips of bacon, eggs benedict, freshly prepared Belgian waffles, ham, sausage, and an omelet station.  I steered clear of the breakfast foods in fear of filling up my tummy too quickly.  Opposite the breakfast line-up were more heartier items like steamed crabs legs, yukon gold mashed potatoes, steamed carrots and haricot verts, and different chicken and beef choices.  Of course what buffet would be complete without the carving stations of prime rib, turkey, and lamb?

The mentionable list: the crab claws, lobster tails, oysters, waffle, caviar, the bacon, and selection of fresh raspberries and blueberries.  Sweet by themselves or great to throw into your champagne. Their food deserves about four stars and service right on par with four stars as well.  Service is not overly intrusive, but I have to be honest, I was expecting a little more from the type of place.  There were a couple times our glasses were left empty until we waved someone down.

They were directing racial slurs and staring at us, the guy even came over at one point and got in my face because I piled a plate full of lobster and oysters and he took issue with it?

The problem lies in the fact that we talked to the servers and management about this and they did nothing. They didn't move us or them, despite my requests and simply indicated that we could get security involved. I didn't want to cause any additional headaches so we simply just left. Our bill wasn't comped either and I understand this is a unique situation, but the response by management is absolutely horrendous and should not be tolerated.

Tried out Sterling Brunch during my bday weekend and we were blown away!  First off, the popovers...they're amaze!  The include a little recipe card for you to take home, but I think they left out their secret ingredient: crack!  Our server was so gracious and kept repelenishing our popovers.

But beyond the crack popovers, the buffet was excellent!!!  Don't expect a long line of endless food, or multiple stations.  It's pretty much just one straight shot of quality, not quantity!  The lobster tails were HUGE, and self serve, so if you wanted eight on your plate, go for it, I'd give you a dirty look but don't mind me.  Crab claws, awesome!  Filet mignon, cooked perfectly and so delicious!  Prime rib, probably the best I've ever had at any Vegas buffet!  Even their bacon was thick and perfectly cooked.  Usually I'd avoid eating (cheap) breakfast food during brunch but, really?  Who can resist a piece of bacon?

They also have a menu of quite a few items, ranging from their lobster bisque, specialty benes, and other small plates.  It takes awhile for the food to come out but just be patient, pace yourself, savor the food in front of you, and your dining companions.

The service again was top notch!  I forgot our server's name, but he was very attentive, and hospitable.

The dining area isn't the largest, or the most elegant, it's actually kind of stale and generic if you ask me.  But, the food is what matters!

The price, yeah it's not for the cheap or the faint of heart.  Runs at $95 per, but, it's worth every dollar.

The service was excellent again, our server was still in training but he did mention where the caviar was this time so that's good that they are doing that now. 

They prepared the lobster different this time, it was the entire tail steamed I think, and I felt it was better my bf thought it was just as good. 

A few of the other dishes that we enjoyed which may or may not change was the lobster papparadelle, giant cocktail shrimp, trout, peppered salmon and lox, salmon en croute, sushi wasn't bad and they had standard selection, sake was excellent...the brand is Nagasaki (clever). Raw oysters I didnt care for to much this time and they didnt have raw clams, the caviar was still ok but I am still not a caviar expert. 

Desserts were top notch, I loved the giant chocolate covered strawberries, they had a bunch of random little cakes and truffles as well as a crepe station. It's worth it to save a little room in your tummy for a sampling, and coffee is included. We actually saw another table order bloody marys which were also included so your not limited to mimosas if you dont care for that, and honestly for that price ($85/pp) they should give you whatever you want to drink.

I was a bit peeved we went gambling after and I did good on the roulette table and got a 10% off coupon for a few of their restaurants and this brunch was one of them (who doesn't like a discount)....I think you need to cash in a certain amount (over $200 maybe) because the bf didnt do as good and did not get the coupon.

Based on all the reviews, we came up with our game plan - drink lots of champagne, eat lots of lobster, and starve ourselves the night before so we could eat as much as we could.

So we arrived 10 minutes before our RESERVATION. Meaning, we called weeks in ADVANCE to secure our table, and even though we arrived early, we still thought a RESERVATION would let us be seated in a timely manner. When we arrived, the hostess told us we would have to WAIT AN HOUR. Are you kidding me?? I asked her what the point was in making a reservation, and all she told me was that if I didn't have one, we wouldn't be eating (and was SO RUDE while saying that). They offered us bloody mary's while we waited, so I guess that was a nice touch, but still AN HOUR WAIT?? Clearly we were going to start off our meal annoyed. 

While waiting an hour, we quickly realized that everyone with a groupon was being seated in one section (we dubbed it the cafeteria because that's what it looked like) and patrons paying full price we being seated in the actual nicer restaurant portion.  ALSO, when we arrived, the restaurant portion was EMPTY. So they were saving it for other people, while people who had paid in advance with our groupon had to wait an hour?? I know we have a groupon, but it's not my fault I got a deal... it's Bally's who offered it, so if they were going to treat us like second class, they shouldn't have offered it at all.
 
So onto the food - it was delicious. The caviar was just what we wanted, we ate our weight in lobster, and the severs never let our champagne glasses get empty.  This is the ONLY reason they are getting two stars. The rest of the food was fine. It wasn't outstanding, the quality wasn't top notch, it didn't have an amazing selection (quite small comparatively). I would NEVER EVER come back here and pay full price. The food was worth the groupon price, but I'd rather go to Wynn or Bellagio brunch buffet, pay the same price as my groupon and have amazing service then come back here.

Personally, I also wouldn't recommend this to anyone either. Go to a classy hotel, and you'll get a classy brunch. Lesson Learned.",6gb0T4_MngSXukRUbIMEfQ,7,0,2,3knR3vj9rQKylL0SQl5czw

This brunch is BALLIN'!!! To start off you have to make reservations in advance and they only open Sunday for brunch. Be warned: it's $85 per person. That's right, that wasn't a typo. However, with that hefty price tag comes some very extravagant perks as you'll see. When you first arrive if you're table is not yet ready, enjoy some complimentary champagne/bloody mary's while you wait. When you do get seated you're transported back to old school Vegas. The walls are lined with old photos of Elvis, Rat Pack, etc.  The waiters are fully suited up and look like they can be your butler for the next couple of hours. Great, nostalgic ambiance for some.

Oh, I could write epic poetry about the popovers.

Please understand when I say I and my group brunch often and brunch hard (they have a website and book in production for goodnesssakes!). We went on January 2nd and we're seated in Diane (God I hope I remember her name right). She met everyone one of out piccadillos and quirks with ease. She was our culinary guide and our jovial pourer (we generally have 4-6 different liquids going at once... per person)

It comes down to one simple moment.

I asked her for her favorite menu item and she mentioned the lamb chop. When she stopped by, she asked how it was. I was mid chew of my first bite and had to admit it was chewy hut very flavorful. She said that wasn't good enough. She took the plate away and got me a new cut. She gave me the brunch tip that I should always request a center cut (who knew?).

That was the single greatest bite of a foodie dream morning. Without great service of Diane, it wouldn't have happened.

In other bits.... there wasn't a bad bite of gourmet goodness. Request eggs benedict.... they are worth it. Made individually like eggs benedict were meant to be made. Stinky cheses. Fat lobster tails. And those popovers.... mmmmmm.

Sunday brunch only.  Reservations required (it always sells out).

The brunch is only on Sunday's, so make sure you make a reservation. Our server was friendly, courteous, constantly around to serve us with whatever we needed (esp. taking away our used plates and filling our champagne glasses).  He was really a wonderful server. 
The buffet itself offered more than enough of selections to please anyone. The seafood was exceptional! From the crab legs, lobster and shrimp. Hubby feasted on the sushi and filet mignon, among a lot of other foods. It's a bit pricey ($90), but it's something you should try if in Vegas. Plus the endless glasses of champagne made the brunch perfect!
My only complaint, if I had to have one, would be that our seating was at 1:30pm, and didn't realize that they closed down the food at 2:30pm. Luckily we were finished, but I would've liked to have known that, incase I wanted more. The desserts stayed out though, and we were never rushed out of there at all.

5123025,2016-10-04,15,5z1WIr7E9P2CSzyN5seeSA,"Not sure why the Sterling Brunch didn't get a whole new page once they changed over from Bally's Steakhouse to BLT as previous ratings are now irrelevant with an entirely new restaurant doing Vegas' best Brunch...but in comparing the old to the new, here's what I noticed:

LOBSTER: Bigger and more tender here than before. Had some rubbery tails in the past, especially towards the end of the Bally's Steakhouse reign.
KING CRAB: Same, great quality as before
FILET MIGNON: Better at the old Bally's...now they have individual filet trays rather than slicing it off a larger cut of meat to your color preference. If you want rare or medium rare, you are out of luck, everything I tried was medium well. The herb butter on top was nice though.
RACK OF LAMB: Thick and meaty as they were before, excellent quality but lacked a little seasoning...had to make use of the green jelly and German mustard.
SERVICE: Waiters were excellent as always, glasses of champagne never half full. However, this one lady behind the buffet was putting this bread pudding french toast from one pan into another with both pans out next to each other and I asked her which pan had the freshly made ones as I wanted to grab one...and she looked at me blankly without an answer...so I asked again, ""Which ones were the ones made 45 minutes ago and which ones were the ones made 5 minutes ago as I'd want a fresh one""...again she looked at me like I had horns and gave me a weird look. She wasn't a foreigner who couldn't speak English and I'm paying $235 for 2 people to eat breakfast, she just wanted to act miserable. Ok, thanks.
LOBSTER BISQUE: Wasn't anywhere to be found...noooo! I like my lobster bisque. Actually no soup to be found anywhere.
POPOVERS: Awesome, made absolutely perfect. A new addition...watch you don't fill up.
SUSHI: They used to have cuts of sashimi without having to take any rice, now it's nigiri on rice...I can have that anywhere for 1/5 the cost...avoided it. The free sake was nice though, wasn't too strong and had a nice flavor.
DESSERTS: They looked great in color, but they just didn't taste great...I was actually shocked that the apricot panna cotta had a NON-DAIRY whipped topping on top...that's a low grade stations buffet move. In the past they had the best home made vanilla bean ice cream I ever had in my life and I used to put it on top of freshly made crepes. Now it's just pink cake pops and blue macaroons trying to look lovely. I would put the dessert section of 10 other buffets well ahead of this one with Bachannal leading the pack. A bit of a bummer at $95 a person plus tax and tip to be disappointed at the finish line. Now I know to have more lobster.

In conclusion, you're eating rack of lamb, filet mignon, king crab and lobster, all done pretty well. Throw in unlimited Perrier-Jouet and unlimited top shelf cocktails and this one is still the one to beat. Fix that dessert situation and serve your french toast with a smile for a 5 star bump.",r52bugu98l77gdqTnIJ2oQ,20,14,4,XePW5nM1Wfon4KQILBpw2Q

As soon as you are seated the waiters come by to fill up your glass with Perrier jouet champagne and I would be impressed if you you were able to drink more than half your glass without the waiters coming by to refill it. Honestly, their attention to the champagne is impressive. Also, keep in mind that you can also get coffee, tea, juice, etc. at no addition cost. You just have to ask for it.

The buffet itself is not huge compared to many of the other famed  buffets in town. This is definitely a quality over quantity situation. Everything is excellent. The prime rib, bread pudding French toast, and fingerling potatoes with chorizo were the real standouts for me. *Pro tip- make a small sandwich out of the popovers they leave at the table and the prime rib. Seriously,  you'll thank me later* The only slight disappointment were the oysters. They were dry and not very flavorful. 

Don't forget to try the made to order eggs bennys. You have to order them from the waiter. I think they usually have three different kinds.

I must have had an entire bottle of Perrier Jouet Champagne Brut which costs $32 at BevMo. That coupled with the lobster, cheese, and Cognac omelets could make the meal worth $60, but not $85. 

We had a party of 6, but we did not all arrive at the same time. They ended up seating 2 people right next to the brunch line and the rest of us in another room about a city block from the food. Making reservations is a MUST for this place. You MUST request to be sat near the brunch line. Otherwise, you'll be walking off all that Brut and Lobster you've just stuffed your face with. We ended up getting moved over to the prime location next to the food so it wasn't that much of a pain.

The mini Belgian waffles were very good. The fruit was very fresh. The caviar was well.... it was caviar. 

The good thing about this place is that you don't have to eat another meal for a solid 8 hours. 

The wait staff was very friendly. He was able to split the bill 5 different ways, which was nice. 

One other thing about this brunch is that it's not an enormous amount of food that you find elsewhere. The restaurant itself is not that large so being in the brunch line itself, feels very cramped. 

I say go for it if you have an extra $85 to spend and your significant other doesn't mind lobster farts. Just make sure to line your purse with ziplock bags so you can bring home extra crab legs to your family and friends. ;)",SwzQbaCkctV3Q2Ru0a6CSw,5,5,3,ovxLshZ0r8wxVE64yf6qjg

5279551,2015-05-28,11,5z1WIr7E9P2CSzyN5seeSA,"Heavily clad in silver when it opened its doors to high rollers in 1981, Bally's Sterling Brunch has undergone a few changes in the last thirty-four years, but still considered a piece of classic Las Vegas on the 'you've got to do it once' list for locals and tourists alike a visit on the Sunday preceding Memorial Day showed the place to be still going strong even despite a doubling in price across the three decades past.

Undeniably a pricey experience, currently tallying $90 but justified by its boutique nature with all-you-can drink Champagne plus a spread including Grilled Lobsters, American Caviar, and King Crab Legs that far outshine the meager offerings at overwrought spots elsewhere, arrival at the doors of BLT Steak during service is likely to be met by a short line but with reservations the wait is minimal, my 9:30am arrival seeing me seated within five minutes by a GM who showed great skill in memorizing the names of diners at several tables where he checked in frequently.

Doing my best to snap a few photos before the buffet was in full swing before returning to my table to find a young waitress that was soon to be overstretched in serving more than a dozen tables, it was with champagne and coffee glass filled that the details of the dining room were described and soon given an enormous cheesy pop-over plus whipped butter by a tall male back-server the experience was underway, the airy bread exceedingly wispy beneath a soft golden shell with cheesy top-notes so pronounced that it almost led me to request another - until I recalled what treasures were to come.

Acknowledging my limitations as relates to alcohol, and as such imbibing in only two-and-a-half glasses of Perrier Jouet along with at least three-fold as many refills of coffee during the course of my 175 minute stay, it was with a deliberate pace and path that I worked my way through the buffet's offerings, a first plate featuring the restaurant's heralded omelet prepped to order with 2oz of caviar, a trio of blinis, and a nicely grilled lobster tail plus freshly drawn butter at its side.

Generally underwhelmed by buffet seafood, but immediately impressed by both the lobster as well as the caviar, a second trip saw snappy shrimp set beside another tail, more roe, plus two types of crab and although the cold pre-cracked claws were a little more grainy than I'd have hoped the King Crab was as sweet and succulent as most found in fine dining establishments spanning the strip, a follow-up of benedicts from the kitchen taking far too long to prepare and meagerly decorated with protein when compared to what customers can just as easily gather themselves.

Taken by the delicacy of noodles surrounding lobster ravioli topped in a sauce quite similar to the bisque, but richer when thickened by hot cast iron, and more than a little surprised at just how supple the slab bacon was when sliced to order, it was here that sweets would first be sampled and although the miniature waffles topped with whipped cream and macerated fruit plus a drizzle of maple syrup were a nice balance of crisp, pliable, and yeasty the laminated pastry given a custard bath before being baked into French Toast was an absolute show-stopper, easily amongst the best in the city and far superior to many that cost $17-20 at several 24-hour cafes.

Spending some time admiring decorations fashioned from reappropriated utensils, the restaurant now nearing half-full with several inebriated patrons pushing the noise level to a dull roar, it was unfortunate that neither the flimsy bacon nor run-of-the-mill sausage were any better than that available at a neighborhood diner while the tiny slice of filet mignon was almost inedibly cooked past well-the tender lamb chops as well as stuffed chicken proving far better seasoned and prepared on my final plate of savories before rounding out the experience in to a quartet of plates featuring small desserts, fruits, cheeses, and nuts.

At this point losing track of the server who seemed to be covering half the room, it was to the GM that I appealed for another cup of coffee and tasting through each of the sweets presented from the bar up front only two items really stood out - the hazelnut tart for its ability to reinvent Nutella into an ever-so-light mousse and the Cheesecake whose sour thickness was absolutely the opposite, a far better bite found in a small bowl of grilled peaches and candied bacon atop fresh pulled burrata that sat unannounced on the cold bar next to an equally fresh berry and yogurt parfait.

Without a doubt an experience, the quality of the cuisine and beverages easily justifying the cost for fans of shellfish and those capable of drinking their fair share of bubbly brut, Sterling Buffet lived up to its 'bucket list' billing as one of those places that everyone should try once, the impetus to return a matter of tastes and budget, particularly in a city where far more vast spreads can be found at a mere fraction of the cost.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,26,18,3,42qcu2nTxNt3LiaQMarhVA

The NEW Sterling Brunch, despite negative reviews, is equally as fabulous! In addition the room has been renovated to a beautiful, modern, upscale, ready to ""compete with its adversaries"" restaurant! 
So upon being seated I was greeted within SECONDS by my fabulous, perfectly attentive server, Javier and offered a glass of the endless Perrier Jouet! YES PLEASE!!! He returned with sparkling water and Figi as requested by myself, and offered us oj if we'd prefer mimosas!!! LOVE IT!
Caviar, Ahi, lobster bisque & eggs Benedict were offered to us on a special order from the kitchen basis! And I surrrrrrrrre did!! 5 orders of caviar later...I was in culinary heaven! The food is fabulous! Ask to be seated with Javier, he is the icing on the cake!

Service was unbelievably good as well. Our champagne glasses were never empty, and I'll admit that I was guzzling that Perrier-Jouët so it was impressive that they could keep up. Our server, Tony, was a class act. He added a lot to our dining experience with the short conversations we had each time he stopped by throughout the meal.

$85 per person sounds pricy, and it is. But what really made this price worth it for us was the fact that we didn't experience the normal hustle-and-bustle of other Las Vegas buffets. Many times you will stand in line for 30 minutes or an hour, then there are crowds of people at the buffet (and sometimes children...hate that), and the whole experience is somewhat hectic and rushed. At the Sterling Brunch we made a reservation, walked right in, and enjoyed a rather quiet, leisurely meal that lasted over 2 hours. I'm so happy we decided to go. It was an unforgettable experience.",GzCYPFBMk_j4LzmJpnVzQA,14,1,5,encT5HcooPyq42SDmztQyQ
5401472,2015-10-26,3,5z1WIr7E9P2CSzyN5seeSA,"I contemplated not writing a review because I really do not have anything good to say about this restaurant. Yet, it is so ridiculously expensive that I thought it was important to go over my experience and opinion of this restaurant. If you are into lobster and fancy items that are different seafood combinations and a lot of meat, you may like this place although my friends who like that said they were not impressed.
Did I just go on a bad day? I am in complete disbelief right now. How is this restaurant one of the best places for brunch in Las Vegas? The Quality of what we attempted to eat today is disappointing. Was this restaurant way better before and that was the time when food critics applauded it? I am just wondering because, quite frankly, being someone who has eaten at the very best places in Las Vegas, this is nowhere near the best brunch in Las Vegas. What it is is way too expensive.
For two people, the bill came out to $195!!! This is for simply ordering brunch for two people without anything else added. The brunch includes all you can drink champagne. It is not a cheap or expensive champagne but I didn't go there for the champagne. The buffet is mainly composed of seafood and meat in the form of Filet Mignon and beef tenderloin. There is also caviar and I was anything but impressed with the quality of the caviar. Our brunch time was 9:45 in the morning. If you are into eating heavy dinner items in the morning, then this may be the place for you. My friend, who is totally OK with dinner food in the morning, and loves seafood and eats it like it is going out of style, was disappointed. She explained that the oysters were not fresh and the lobster that she had looked and tasted like it was leftovers. She ate one oyster and said it tasted terrible and she refused to eat anymore as she was afraid that she would get sick.
As for me, brunch stands for breakfast and lunch, not dinner. I get it: this restaurant wants to wow with fancy items which is great and you can have a separate table for that. If the restaurant was not this expensive, I don't think I would be as critical as I am at this point. Breakfast items that you would find at other high-end expensive brunches were completely absent or just pathetic at this place. I ordered an egg white omelette and I had very limited choices of what I could put in it. The guy who was cooking it for me ended up putting a load of butter before cooking the omelette and then proceeded to add way more of this liquid butter while the omelette was in the actual skillet cooking because it was sticking to the skillet. To make a long story short, the omelette was swimming in a disgusting soup of butter and had practically no taste. There were some baked potatoes and they were too salty. The bacon and sausage as well as asparagus were decent. As for fruit, what a joke! There were a few small bowls of fresh berries and that was it. No other fresh fruit to be seen. There were no wonderful different breads or toast to choose from. Poppers were brought to the table and I thought that they were disappointing and I have had way better. There was no choice of toast or bread anywhere to choose from. What there was was a beautiful dessert table that is perfect for dinner! There were small baby sized waffles and I tried them. They were dry and even the maple syrup did not help. The frittata was just terrible. The kitchen could make lobster eggs Benedict for you but I do not like eggs Benedict so unfortunately that was a bummer for me.
Overall, this was, in my opinion, a late lunch/dinner buffet and from what I understand, my friends were less than impressed with the seafood or meat quality which they said was pretty much average and not one thing was outstanding. What was really sad is that the food was so average or bad, that each one of us only ate about half to three quarters of a whole plate and left two whole plates of completely untouched food as one bite made it clear that that was an item not worth continuing to eat. We paid a hell of a lot of money for that! I guess we all thought that for the expensive price tag per person, the food should be pretty good. Boy were we wrong.
I would not pay more than $30 a person for what I was able to eat and the quality of what was served. I will not be going back and would never ever recommend this restaurant to any of my friends. There are many way better places in Las Vegas for brunch. How sad that after we paid our bill at this restaurant, because we did not want to give them a hard time as it is not the waiter's fault that we were anything but impressed, we all went over to The Creperie at the Paris Hotel and had delicious crepes for 1/9th of the price and those were worth a lot more!
For the exorbitant price, this restaurant only gets one star. Just a gross disappointment if you like brunches that are extravagant with high quality food and a lot of variety for breakfast and lunch.",leY7FqJ3NKPzpM5awAQ2-Q,14,1,1,rnieYnf55ux8svadCfyfvg
5408205,2016-05-30,25,5z1WIr7E9P2CSzyN5seeSA,"Wow! How have I lived in Vegas for twenty years without ever hearing about this???!!! My buddy said he wanted to take me for my birthday. All I knew was there was bottomless champagne and I was in. But man was I in for a day that was truly epic!

So let's start off talking bubbles.... Now I'm a pretty big fan of brunch with bottomless drinks. But let's face it, quite often it's pretty cheap champagne as can be expected if it's going to be adulterated with orange juice. Not here! Perrier Jouet! Oh and we drank more than our meal price with this amazing nectar of the gods. Our server, Sergio, was amazing and made sure our glasses were filled at all times. 

After being seated, Sergio explained that everything was at the buffet except the Benedicts which were made to order. We ordered both the lobster and the prosciutto. Both were excellent. Then we made our way to the buffet. Holy seafood galore! Big beautiful lobster tails, oysters on the half shell, Alaskan King Crab, caviar and tons more! They also had a great omelette station and an amazing carving station that showcased a beautiful prime rib and lamb. I didn't take advantage of this however because I was truly mesmerized by all of the seafood offerings. I couldn't resist the hand carved slab of bacon though!

After stuffing ourselves with lobster and crab, Sergio asked if we tried the bread pudding French toast. We somehow missed seeing it. Sergio insisted we try it and actually went to get it for us. He came back with two plates. One had the French toast with carmelized bananas and the other had a freshly made crepe topped with a divine passion fruit sauce. 

No matter how full you are there is always room for dessert right? So we made our way to the dessert station where we loaded up on chocolate dipped strawberries, tarts and other amazing delights. Oh and of course we finished off the meal with more champagne!

Upon leaving we noticed people eating at the bar. We inquired if the people sitting at the bar were able to partake in the buffet and told they were. There were TV's there so that is a great option when there is a good game on.

I saw some reviews complaining about the price. I don't see how anyone can complain with both the quality and service. Not something I could afford to do on a regular basis but this will definitely be on my rotation for special occasions.",BbwldZQM1i89cAvV7fce3A,53,45,5,tRhGciSV1ZzNNJ38TGya1w

Don't let the price intimidate you because think about how much you would spend if you bought caviar; or 2 lobster tails; or stone crab claws; and real champagne?!  We did when we went there this past Sunday and we are convinced for the quality this is the best deal in Vegas.  We have hit the other popular buffets over the years:  Caesars; M; Green Valley; Main Street; Wynn, Paris; Spice Market...to name a few..and no one compares.  They have made-to-order eggs benedict as well- lobster or steak benedicts.  My husband got a lobster omelet...which was very good.  The lobster tails were big and good.  Caviar was very good.  We used the popovers they gave us to eat with the caviar.  We focused on the seafood (can you tell???) but they also had prime rib; rack of lamb; slab of bacon; and ham.  They had filet mignon.  Desserts were good, different from what you normally see at a buffet.  Oh and the champagne- they keep it flowing and your glasses filled always.

5458413,2018-06-19,2,5z1WIr7E9P2CSzyN5seeSA,"Good god was it hard to get into place. First of all, if you want to make a reservation you have to do it over a month in advance. If not, you need to show up early (before opening) to get seated without too much of a wait. 

We took one of my girlfriends for her birthday. Since we couldn't make a reservation on time we had to show up early. We were there 15 minutes before opening and there was already a line. But lucky for us, we were still part of the first group seated at the bar.

This place really is a hidden gem. 

Staff was so fun! Lively, joking around, very friendly; it really added to the brunch atmosphere. Made it a great experience.

And then the food, gods the food. It's not the best lobster or steak you'll ever have, but it is still great and sooooo worth the price. 

We all, almost quite literally, ate ourselves to death. 

So worth it. I can't believe I had never heard of this place till recently, even though I have lived here for over 20 years. Will be back!",b4t9cwSUG4FRamK4G8FTSg,1,0,5,k8Gq2WIHXRD667uKhJVuzA
5534302,2016-02-11,5,5z1WIr7E9P2CSzyN5seeSA,"I eagerly decided to write my 50th review of Bally's Sterling Brunch, unfortunately, this visit wasn't like previous ones.  After having made a reservation about 3 weeks ago, we arrived a bit before our time and were promptly seated at noon. Since it was just the two of us, we were seated at a small two person table off to the side. No problem.

I mainly come to the brunch for the seafood treats and the Perrier-Jouet (always yummy).  I was surprised to learn that the Stone Crab claws had been substituted with Jonah Crab claws (which are a cheaper version of the Stone)  Ok, I thought, I will gladly try them out.  They were basically tasteless and small;one tasted like ammonia and rotten fish. Strike one.  If you are going to charge $95 (yes, the price went up) please use fresh, high quality seafood without using cheaper substitutes, diners deserve that. 

The second strike involved the Alaskan King crab of which I'm a major aficionado.  The size was average.  But, and this is among the worst aspects, when I went to ""crack"" them, they bent, which means when defrosted they were left to soak in their own water for a long period of time instead of being properly drained. They were Chinese buffet soggy, if you know what I mean.  Inappropriate for a $95 brunch. 

On a positive note, the Neuske bacon was a major hit.  Very thickly sliced portion of smoked pork heaven.  Really fantastic!

Our server was Lupita who was friendly and provided some nice recommendations, but was slow on the draw when refilling our champagne flutes.

I will have to really think twice about returning to this brunch.  It's definitely not like it used to be.  Sadly.",jx7w1ztxqpRrA7pBoOfu6w,24,5,3,t8XGBc-znyZxfxWz3Dv4-A
5548983,2018-02-11,0,5z1WIr7E9P2CSzyN5seeSA,"After reading all high marks this place gets and pictures posted, I thought that I would finally take the opportunity to dine here while I'm here alone.  I was able to make a reservation the night before on Open Table.  This buffet costs $105 per person.  It does include unlimited champagne, mimosas, bloody Mary's and the regular sodas, coffees & OJ.
The restaurant is on the casino floor right next to Buca Di Beppo all the way in the back.  Already out of the gate, I experience an issue.  I walk up to the hostess and stand right in front of her for about 10-15 seconds before she even acknowledges me.  At most high end restaurants, the hostess will greet you with a smile before you even approach their post.  Not here.  After waiting about 5 minutes for my table to be ready, I finally get seated and just watch the server walk past me with no acknowledgement.  So I decided to just go hit the buffet.  After coming back from the buffet, the server still does not come around to take my drink order until another 5 minutes has passed.  Throughout my brunch, the server did not refill my drinks and I had to ask him.  He paid more attention to everyone else around me.  I know I was dining alone, but it would have been nice to have been asked if I wanted a refill.  Towards the end of my meal, I asked for wet naps and the check.  He actually forgot the wet naps and disappeared for another 10 minutes before he brought my check.
So that's my gripe about the service.  As for the food, I say that you are wasting your money here.  I would have been ok paying $25 for the quality of food they served here.  I know they have lobster tail, prime rib, lamb chops, king crab, stone crabs, blue point oysters and filet mignon to name a few, but the taste was not good at all.  I would highly recommend spending the $50 at Bacchanal in Caesars Palace over this place.  The buffet here is about 1/4 the size of Bacchanal's.  First off, the lobster was not dry or anything, it just had a weird taste to it.  I can't really explain what it is, but I was not a big fan of it.  The melted butter did not go well with it IMO.  I did have to squeeze lemon on top just to make it edible.  The prime rib was very dry.  The carver gave me the end where it was well done.  This is actually my fault.  I should have paid attention and asked for the medium cut instead.  The lamb chop was too gamey.  I just took one bite and I could already taste the gaminess and had to spit it out.  The filet mignon was very dry and lack flavor.  The shrimp cocktail was ok.  They were very big and plump though.  The rock crab was a joke.  There was no taste and just full of water when I bit into it.  Normally you can taste the brininess of the crab, but not here.  The blue point oysters for some reason didn't taste fresh to me.  I had some oysters yesterday at Bacchanal's and those were fresher than these.  Their dessert was very minimal at best.  Nothing there to really wow you.  I don't know if they had an off day or not, but I am not willing to risk spending another $105 to find out.  Even the table next to said that the buffet was not spectacular.  That's really saying something when you spend over $100 for a buffet.  I'm really surprised since this is a Steakhouse, you would think that their food or at least their meats would taste a lot better.  
I don't like to write bad reviews, but I feel that it's my duty to let everyone here know not to waste your $105 on this place.  You will regret it afterwards.  Go to Bacchanal instead.",WpCqwLoXyRL8Yx0NbPzxDw,1,1,2,5xNb34cpLM28LLlnIDqqTg

This spot is only opened on Sundays and ends at 2:30pm. Reservations are usually sold out. Luckily we went and found empty seats at the bar! My husband loved watching Sunday football while grubbing on lobster tails. 

For $95 you definitely get your money's worth here. You gotta strategize and not get too full off buffet fluff. Lobster tails are FAT, king crab legs are MEATY, prime rib DELISH, shrimp cocktails were HUGE and the bloody Mary's and champagne was non-stop. I liked the popover bread too, crusty exterior and chewy buttery interior. 

Cons: the crab leg crackers don't work well on Alaskan king crab. Wish they had the crab stick (pointy end) that other buffets have. I hate to peel the crab leg piece by piece it took forever because the spiny thorns and by the time you finished the crab meat got cold. Boo. Also skip the lobster bisque it wasn't very good. 

Overall I think if you compare this to Bacchanal Buffet you will expect too much. Bacchanal has 3x more variety there BUT you have to wait in those hour+ lines and they don't have lobster. So you pick what suits your style!",-PbPi3wYwpLHs6bM7pwFrA,6,2,5,BPpVaxAX45IkqvklWQTSJA

While yes, the price is steep, if you take into account service and the food quality overall, I think it's quite worth it. In addition, the fact that this place is only open once a week (Sundays from 9AM to 2PM) reassures me that they still deliver quality here since it's not a typical buffet where the food is running 24/7.

Do your research.....when you come here, don't expect every single thing to be out of this world..let's not forget this is a buffet after all. I skipped the sushi altogether (looked unpleasant) but opted for the lobster tails, roasted crab legs, lamb, filet, caviar, & dessert station.

The lobster tails are outstanding and our server was attentive in cutting them out for us each and every single time and bringing us butter. He suggested to sprinkle the caviar on top and then finish them off with the butter sauce -this was an absolute treat!

The roasted crab legs were delicious in my opinion..they were tender and juicy and warm! I hate those dinky cold thin crab legs they serve at all the other casino buffets. These were definitely la creme de la creme!

The caviar (although I've had better) was up to par, and the champagne was very decent authentic French champagne - Perrier-Jouët.

The dessert station was also excellent! Fresh made to order crepes with options of fresh berries and gelato or chocolate & bananas...

My other favorite part was the home made chocolate truffles & peanut butter lollipops as well as the variety of flavors in chocolate dipped strawberries!

Would I come back again? Yes. There are areas where they could improve - sushi and the orange juice...A $85 per person brunch should absolutely offer fresh squeezed orange juice!",ibvH1Y7Rh_tstiWgH0OFTA,3,1,4,xmaUp3VWfu6eVCYEPssWIA
5650529,2010-10-24,35,5z1WIr7E9P2CSzyN5seeSA,"Sifting through all the reviews and food show hype, Bally's Sterling Brunch was pegged as probably the best Sunday brunch around.  Located in the casino at the site of their steak house, the Sterling Brunch exudes a classy old-school style of dining.  Their selection of items can only be described as no-frills with many of the classic brunch staples that have withstood the test of time and found almost everywhere.

But this is where the similarity with many other brunches ends.  The caliber of items for an AYCE place is superior.  Who offers unlimited lobster tail, filet mignon, and caviar, with bottomless Perrier-Jouet champagne? 

They have the standard omelette station, crepe station, waffles, etc.  

I don't want to go into an exhaustive listing so I will just point out some of the noteworthy things.

Australian rock lobster tail - you can pile it on, not just take one please
filet mignon - tender
casino clams
caviar - not sure which but not cheap kind, mildly salty and not too fishy
prime rib
rack of lamb - cooked perfect
seafood jambalaya
garlic truffle mashed potatoes
salmon egg benedict
seafood in puff pastry
couscous with tilapia
dessert bar - choc dipped strawberries, various cream desserts in glasses, choc brownie with peanut butter on a stick

Stay away from:
sushi - not so fresh and a bit fishy
crab claws - mushy

They have bacon and sausage but no eggs.  Omelette bar though. No crab legs.

If you like to have a variety of different foods and novel offerings, this brunch may not be for you. There is no chocolate fountain either.

Service is impeccable.  One server per two tables.  Constant attention to your needs.

Nice change of pace to other Vegas buffets that tend to be a bit mediocre in quality.  

PS - I have to share a conversation at the dessert bar with a girl, I'll call her Bimbo, and her friend.  As she looks at the long stem choc covered strawberries, she remarks - OMG how do they do that!?  

The dessert bar guy   - Oh they dip it one chocolate and then drizzle the other one over, creating the stripes.

Bimbo - No, I meant the stems, how do they make them so long?

I then looked at the dessert guy and he was in shock. I was more than thrilled to help out.

Me - Oh, they don't create it.  They just cut the strawberry with stem longer cuz it grows on a plant!

Bimbo - Wow. Who knew? (giggles)

What I would have liked to have replied - If you were a zebra, you would be the first to be eaten by the lions, but you're not. So please, do us all a favor and don't have any children unless they discover stupidity skips generations.",4q1GOTm23q-qG3o5Kpz81Q,9,6,5,mSQp5ZBsn-YUICRPxhEpIA

The lobster tails are plump and juicy, just like how I like my tails ;) Prime rib and rack of lamb is good as well (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5z1WIr7E9P2CSzyN5seeSA?select=p5r69Lsa4VPYQn341ztnKQ#S_AC7AJUdil9jHRKqiHZfg) but I'm going to fast forward to the second best thing which is the banana foster crepes! They have a chef make it for you on the spot (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5z1WIr7E9P2CSzyN5seeSA?select=p5r69Lsa4VPYQn341ztnKQ#WpbsZIpG6cRbw98uh4Uujg) and you can get it topped with gelato, I chose pistachio and oh my goodness, I would've ate these all night if I could but instead I only had a modest 4...on top of the 15 or so lobster tails I had. Cholesterol for the win buddy! Price came out to about $115 each person for our party of 11, steep, but still a bargain considering how much we ate and the quality of it all. Definitely a must try and certain hidden gem of Las Vegas.",TmfhtQFHQDqoxhNP_liyzA,5,3,5,1kMwEX-qxjfop3Jo5-B-Jw
5699572,2017-09-22,0,5z1WIr7E9P2CSzyN5seeSA,"Saying this up front, best buffet experience I've had in Vegas and I have had a lot. 

This is a $105 brunch buffet at Bally's that requires a reservation well in advanced, but for good reason. Located at BLT steakhouse, this buffet is only available for Sunday brunch, so if you want to end your Vegas trip with a bang this is the way to go. 

So what do you get for $105? You get a server who is very knowledgeable in food and Vegas in general, who will serve unlimited champagne that can be turned into mimosasa and a decent bloody mary bar where you can add a lot of different flavors and garnishes into your bloody mary. Also typical buffet trap, the popover bread was incredible!! The bread had a perfectly crispy outside and a fluffy delicious inside, perfect to put the black caviar they have at the sauce station. I normally would say avoid the bread at a buffet but omg ya'll need to try it. 

Now for the actual buffet food. The choices was very limited compare to other places, but everything there was quality Some of the highlights there were the king crab legs, whole lobster tail, prime rib, and raw oysters. The crab legs were juicy, meaty and fresh, but the best thing was that they actually gave you crab crackers and crab forks so it made it so much easier than using a regular fork like at other buffets. My favorite there was the whole lobster tail the amount of meat and value you get is the best bang for your buck. I think I ate 4 of them and would eat more if it could fit. Problem is the meat gets sort of tough when it cools down so remember to get the fresh one. Last thing, I would try to avoid the filet mignon and the rack of lamb, it might have been just that day, but those cuts were a bit dry to my liking. However, I didn't mind because I feel like those meats are generally dry at other buffets. 

In general, this is going to be a staple of my Vegas trip from now on. Definitely recommend.",IPNUr_ksnOnkDnlN39eBkQ,4,2,5,E3CbBzqrHMryokz3t8Fnrw
5721351,2015-07-22,4,5z1WIr7E9P2CSzyN5seeSA,"Now that I've eaten at this buffet, I don't think I can go to any other. This is a very specialized buffet in that it's all high end/high quality food and not a ton of choices/fillers as other buffets tend to be overwhelming. It is only on Sunday, requires a reservation, and is $75 per person and well worth it. 

What you get is endless champagne, excellent service, and amazing food. My favorite was the Lobster (I had 2), Chilean Sea Bass, Prime Rib, Alaskan King Crab, and Lamb Chops. I love to eat and just had to stuff myself (needless to say didn't need to eat for the rest of the day). Just take your time eating and there is absolutely no rush.

The menu sounded SO awesome, that I decided to pay the $85/person for brunch, even though I wasn't that hungry.  But, the food did not match the menu description at all.

The filet mignon was overcooked and dry.  The prime rib was better at Rio seafood buffet, the sea bass was dry and tasteless, and the crab legs were salty.  Ok, the cavier was good.  And, they had kiwis at the fruit bar.  Oh, and can't forget about the free champagne (which gave me a headache).

5778773,2011-03-07,3,5z1WIr7E9P2CSzyN5seeSA,"My best suggestion is to stop reading the yelp reviews and not go into Sterling brunch with super high expectations. But if you want to keep reading anyway, here's my review...
I called the number online, which ended up being harrahs' restaurant res. The guy had never even heard of the Sterling brunch (typical harrahs). I had to ask to be transferred to the steakhouse and the hostess i dealt with was great. I didn't have to out down a credit card tol hold the res like others had mentioned. 
Arrived for our res at noon and there were only a couple of parties waiting before us. Reviews had mentioned that they give you champagne while you wait, but I only saw a couple discarded glasses, no one waiting had any. It was a really dark and dreary bar area with elevator music playing. Thankfully we were seated after about 15 min. 
The steakhouse was really old school - lots of dark wood, heavy chairs on rollers, dark heavy fabrics. Probably not somewhere I'd go for dinner w all the other more fun steakhouses. Our waiter Mario was great, very attentive. It was a little hard to understand his thick accent, but he was nice and topped off our champagne at every opportunity. Doesnt matter to me but fyi - they don't seem to serve Evian water anymore. Its looks to be just regular tap.  
On to the food - they must have the same menu every Sunday because I basically had what everyone else has mentioned. But they seem to have been a victim of cost cutting. There was no sushi, which is fine since every person mentioned that it sucked anyway. Caviar was available only upon request thru the waiter - a small serving with crostini, creme fraiche, chopped egg, onion and capers. Delicious! We got tiny little blinis w our 2nd order, but not the first. Awesome topped w creme fraiche and lobster. Yum!
Lobster tails were in halves, and didn't look nearly as appetizing as the pics I'd seen on here. I get what they mean about the lobster getting rubbery as it sits there, but it was still really good. Filets were cooked perfectly, there were also braised boneless short ribs which weren't anything special. 
Chilean sea bass was so rich, be sure to get some of the jumbo scallops and risotto in the middle. The meat ravioli and lamb stew seemed out of place, and were just mediocre. Didn't try the prime rib because it looked dry. Lamb chops were cooked perfectly and juicy but they weren't slicing them to order - I could tell by the color on the outside that it had been sliced and sat out for a bit. But still delicious w mint jelly. 
King crab legs were warm. Which is a nice change but that also seemed to have sat in the chafing dish a bit too long. The legs were huge, but some were really dried out. The legs were broken off at the joints but were not precut. We were given 1 of those nut cracker types for the table. The can opener looking crackers would've been a better choice since theirs just squished the legs w out actually cracking open anything. The waitors also don't seem to crack the legs for you as I read in another review. See what I mean about yelp giving you preconcieved notions/out of date info?
The ice bar had the usual fare - raw oysters (didn't try them), snow crab claws (watery from being pre frozen) and colossal shrimp cocktail. Shrimp was huge and yummy, cocktail sauce could've used more horseradish. 
I skipped the breakfast stuff as it looked like nothing special - mini waffles, omelette station, bacon, sausage, eggs benedict and fritatta.
On to desserts... I think a lot of the pics on here are out of date - they don't have that tall 4 shelf display, its been cut down to 2 shelves. And dessert was honestly the worst part of the meal. That's the first time I've ever said that about a buffet. There were no cakes, pies, or even creme brulee. I don't know what anything was because there was no signage and the chef said ""I don't know, I usually work the hot side."" It was just a huge disappointment to end the meal that way. I'll try to remember what they had - the worst tapioca pudding I've ever had (pearls were hard), stale mini cream puffs w overly sweet filling, blah lemon tart, fudge, brownie topped w raspberries, weird berries and clear jelly thing, and the one good thing as a chocolate mousse. That was seriously all they had to offer. For a Vegas buffet that's pretty pathetic and for the price of this buffet, that's a joke. 
Maybe its my high expectations that affected my experience, but I'm really disappointed w Sterling buffet overall. It may have been awesome before, but unfortunately doesn't seem to be anymore. I'd suggest going to another brunch and just dealing w cheaper champagne, or better yet just buy a couple bottles of Perrier jouet. Its pretty bad when you're as drunk as we were and you still don't think the food is amazing.",dsaj_eA71FvpUh49zzKcGA,3,0,2,OgxIlwaLj9BOUNhbfdnWZQ

The food itself is prepared wonderfully and everything tasted decadent and fit for a queen. I particularly loved the popovers that they bring to your table. Also amazing was the service. We had Tony serving our section and he always made sure our champagne glasses were filled! He also had our entire section roaring with laughter and constantly cheersing one another.

Endless caviar (just ask at the sushi bar)
Lobster cooked perfectly 
Service was impeccable without a hint of snootiness.

Though as with any buffet, some pieces are better than others.  For example, my first lobster tail was a near perfectly delicious.  The second was a bit mushy (i.e. not very fresh).  Also, the stone crab claws I had were watery and tasteless.

Tip, if you go, try to get an earlier reservation.  The brunch ends at 2:30.  We saw people with 1pm reservations who were still waiting at 1:30 because customers are slow to give up their tables.  Also, sign up for a Total Rewards card at any of the associated hotels for a discount.  

Lastly, I was surprised at how limited the selection was.  My expectations were way off in that I thought it was a place that offered many variations of lobster.  Definitely, that was not the case.  Just one type of lobster tail, eggs benedict (made to order!) and ravioli.  The latter contained almost no lobster.  Keep in mind, the restaurant is not a full time buffet.

I have been waiting to go but too expensive by far; $90 a person. Not too many people have heard of it but it is the claimed premier brunch in town for many years running. Groupon had a two for one so I went ahead and did it for this holiday weekend. We went last night. My verdict is; not worth it. There is lobster, cavier, crab legs and claws, rack of lamb, sushi, oysters and other dishes. The lobster was pretty decent, not rubbery. I guess if you love cavier it would be worth it. The deserts left much to be desired as well. Like they thought you would be so full you wouldn't want it anyway. We had a reservation but still waited 45 minutes because we ""had a Groupon"" which means we didn't ""rate"". The Maitre d actually told me their 4 and 5 star guests get top priority!  Maybe we were supposed to tip the manager but at $90 I wasn't so inclined and thought those days were over. Guess not, lol. Anyway, that is my review. Good, but Planet Hollywood and The M casino are right up there for way less money. The Rio has lobster, so I will see how they are.

Our group felt that Sterling is loosing it;s touch.  In that, they are going for quantity instead of quality.  Crab was salty and soggy.  Lobster wasn't any better.    Only good thing was the champagne.  They still use a good quality champagne with their brunch.  Oh, yes.  Service was excellent as always.  Staff at the Sterling are top rated.

I think, Sterling can be so much better.  They should consider reducing selection lists and increase the quality of remaining food.  Just a slight improvement of lobster and crab will improve the overall impression of the restaurant drastically.

Hopefully, by the time my next visit arrives, their quality have improved.  Or at least, prove to me that the quality of the dish served on Super Bowl Sunday was a fluke and they aren't that bad.",9spOHzbNneeJ4WUumAa6oA,1,0,3,KWzeBPiwCqizCP1uiNEgEw

That was a hook, line, and sinker!  After opening a few of the chaffing dishes and seeing those lobster tails and king crab legs... we were in!

I would have done a full 5 stars, but I wasn't a fan of their sushi selection.  It didn't taste fresh to me.  And their dessert bar wasn't the best I've had.  I didn't get a chance to eat their crepes, but yes, they were freshly made by a waiting chef.

The items on the buffet you've probably seen at other brunch offerings, but what sets this apart is the quality. The lobster tails are of substantial size. Other places, if they offer them, are smaller and sadly they end up overcooked. Prime rib, slab bacon, rack of lamb, shrimp, sushi, filet mignon, bread pudding, caviar and many other items are all replenished in small batches quite frequently so they won't get overcooked or sit it very long.

Endless mimosas and a Bloody Mary bar add to the experience. A great selection of desserts rounds out everything.

But... But... But.. It's very spendy.. To the tune of $90 a person (80 with a TR card) however is well worth it if you like to eat posh. What I mean is if you don't eat caviar, lobster, king crab or drink the bubbly for breakfast then you will be wasting your money and shouldn't bother coming here. However, you get what you pay for here; the champagne served alone was worth the entry fee. 

Unlike the feed lines at the other casino buffets, this place does require reservations. I suggest that you do it at least week in advance as this place is always busy.

The Food:
The buffet line was superb! Lobster tail, filet mignon, prime rib, lamb and king crab: a feast fit for a king!
The table menu boded items like lobster benedict, french toast, tuna tartare and caviar. We were unsure what to get from the kitchen so the server grabbed a sample of offerings for our first round of the aforementioned delicacies. 

Everything that I ate was top notch with excellent service to match! We were tended to with excellent service, never had a champagne glass empty or a dirty dish in sight. 

This was definitely a memorable dining experience that should be near the top of everyone's to-eat list in Vegas.

Unlimited lobster tails? Crab legs? 
Caviar? 
Filet Mignon? 
Colossal shrimp? 
Popover bread? 
Champagne? Mimosas? 

For around $95 plus tip and tax bucks per person, this place was definitely worth a visit. This classy brunch buffet is tucked away in Bally's and yes, the service was totally awesome. Our waiter was friendly, accommodating and personable. Our glasses were never left unfilled - and yeah, I'm talking about the alcohol :)  

Oh and when you walk in, don't expect your traditional Wicked Spoon-style buffet with countless food choices as Sterling Brunch has a limited menu.

Highlights -
Lobster Tails - Super delicious. Like bomb.com good. The tails were so massive, flavorful and juicy. Don't forget to grab the butter :)
Popover bread - Trust me. It's really, really good. Super warm, fluffy and just overall amazing.

Lowlights -
Crab - Meh 
Filet Mignon - Not too flavorful and some pieces were a bit too dry
Ice cream - No one told us about it, which was a bummer

Pro-Tips - 
- Dip the lobster tail in the lobster bisque 
- Get some OJ for those champagne glasses
- Reservation not available online? Call in. 

Overall, this place was definitely a great place to check out. Unfortunately, once was definitely enough for me. For the price tag, I would rather go to Bacchanal Buffet for a cheaper meal with more options. However - if you're a huge lobster fanatic - check out Sterling Brunch.

My fella and I came here this Sunday to partake in some delectable lobster tails, king crab, sashimi and lamb. Some of the most recent reviews noted that some of the items ran out later in the day so I made sure to make an early reservation. We arrived at 10:30 and were taken to our table immediately. Our server came up to us immediately to fill our water and champagne glasses. He also gave us a rundown of the layout of the buffet and offered his suggestions. We immediately made our way to the buffet to start our foodie adventure. 

I started with the lobster tails, king crab, lamb, sashimi, caviar and eggs benedict. My fella did the same and we returned to our table. The food was definitely better than any buffet food I've ever had. I was beyond excited for all the choices available to us. Desserts were excellent as well. This is definitely not a meal we will be doing again any time soon, but it is something I recommend everyone do at least once. 

It is clear that they prepared well for the onslaught of people who came because of the Groupon that was offered. I even overheard conversations among staff about how much more champagne they had been going through since the Groupon became available. They definitely prepared well. They were well-stocked on all food and drink items and definitely well-staffed. We never wanted for anything and our server was extremely attentive and accommodating.

Luckily we came here early on a Saturday around noon and the place was empty! our party of 6 was seated right away without a reservation. i feel like the high price tag def deters a lot of tourists away but worked for us that we didnt have to wait in any line haha. Note that the Sterling Brunch is held at the BLT Steakhouse space and there's no specific sign to indicate brunch so just be aware of that haha

On to the food & champagne...I loved that it was unlimited champagne and it was the good stuff. i think i drank enough champagne to recoup the $85 price tag haha. Also included are non-alcoholic drinks like sodas or coffee - pretty cool that you could get cappuccino too. For the food, you cannot beat lobster tail! although i thought the lobster itself was a bit too salty, once its dipped in butter that saltiness goes away haha. Also liked the prime rib, filet mignon, tuna tartar, crab claws & legs, truffle mashed potatoes, and lobster bisque. pretty cool that you can order some items hot/fresh from the kitchen in addition to all the food that is laid out for the buffet. also they will cook your meat made to order. my friend wanted a rare piece of filet mignon so the chef cooked him one - very cool. 

im sure that our large party was kind of overwhelming and rowdy for the classiness of the Sterling Brunch haha but the service did not suffer from that haha. the service was amazing all afternoon! my champagne glass was not empty once and all our plates were consistently cleared out for us. our server was really friendly and knowledgeable and i even learned a little bit about the champagne making process haha.

overall this is definitely a splurge in vegas but i think its worth the experience and worth the great time. cannot beat that free champagne! haha",HO35wso-psqx0GF--QSwGA,5,2,4,oAwU-L7T_uWs1qoiaX70uQ

Service - Jimmy - kept the champagne flowing! All the staff was attentive and polite.  
Food - besides the 2 shortcomings mentioned above all the food was 5 star.  Usually when you go to a Buffett you have a few bites and are ready for the next selection. At this Buffett every selection is good enough to eat a whole servings worth. 
Beverage  - champs on champs on champs! You can go to the bar and keep drinking champagne even if you are finished eating at your table.  Score! 
Atmosphere - it's in the existing BLT restaurant yet has a cool, exclusive vibe.  At $100 a man you know everyone's coming for a good time.",NMx2Zxf2aLukc5SoDK5ypQ,2,3,4,AzLpWoWfsaHYcqUXWG2XrQ

It was not horrible, but for the price it was terrible.  Plenty of lobster tails - dry, plenty of crab claws - watery and completely flavorless, plenty of coffee - horrible quality, sushi - Chinese buffet quality.

What a disappointment.  The best thing was the puff bread they served at the table and the bread pudding was OK.

Bloody Mary sucked you know what!

Service was very iffy and I had to flag down our guy two or three times before I could get my water!!

I rather spend twice as much and get quality or half as much as get the same elsewhere without the lobster.

What a shame, what a sham.",MQb4_RgMz2nvEM_P8p1NrA,7,2,1,HOqZAHv7tud9ZSvg8IZeXA

The quality of the food is quite Vegas buffet average.  However they do offer mediocre American caviar (still caviar) and lobster tails that are a bit dry and chewy (still lobster tails). The crab legs and their lamb chops were quite good, the best items in the buffet in my opinion. 

Their saving grace is the endless supply of Perrier -Jouet champagne that makes everything more fun and tastier.",doK5Bf6OLlu2GdjL7x1_HQ,6,4,3,JkA0QyeVbWiinCxbbxHqfA

It was great and the most expensive brunch that I've ever had $95 per person to be exact. We were looking for a restaurant that said Sterlings in the Bally's until we stopped and asked some security guard who corrected us and let us know that it was actually BLT steak house ! When we got there we found out our reservations were actually a month out but the hostess was so very nice and accommodated us even though we made the mistake of coming a month early. The restaurant itself was very fancy, but the lighting was darker than I expected. Maybe the restaurant is more for a date setting? Well once we were seated we were greeted by our waiter who was in a suit and looked like a butler. I thought it was super cute and he was very attentive to us the entire time. He kept pouring the perrier jouet wine into our glasses Everytime our mimosas were getting low which was nice. The food was excellent ranging from top of the line seafoods like king crab legs, lobster, snow crab, oysters and they also had filet mignon, prime rib, lobster bisque, and the desserts were separated into their own area which was very nice. At the end of the meal as we walked out the hostess gave me some flowers to take home which was great.",P0rGN5mDue55uIiAzkrRlw,2,1,5,4g-kK9z5257vcPN8LgXOGw
