242765,2017-02-27,0,8fFTJBh0RB2EKG53ibiBKw,"My wife and I dined here yesterday morning, 2/26, on the last day of a long weekend in Vegas.  We were looking for something off-strip, so we could avoid large crowds, ostentatious buffets and inflated pricing.  I selected Zenaida's on the strength of their Yelp rating, and we were absolutely not disappointed.

Right after we ordered, we were treated to a small plate of house-made chips and ""enchilada aioli"", compliments of the chef.  Not sure what was in the dip, but it was delicious!

We opted to start with the cinnamon bun, which was an absolute delight.  Warm, sweet and sticky, and piled high with a mound of whipped cream.

My wife enjoyed the Sterling breakfast: two eggs made to order, delicious breakfast potatoes and the thickest, juiciest slab of bacon I'd ever seen.  This was precisely the simple breakfast fare we were after, but done with such a high quality that it easily could have been featured in any of the high-end restaurants on The Strip.

I ordered the Eggs Benedict, which was also fantastic.  Eggs done perfectly (I prefer mine scrambled), the same thick-cut bacon, and a well-balanced Hollandaise sauce made for a delicious treat.  This, too, came with breakfast potatoes, which were crispy and MOLTEN LAVA HOT (seriously, be careful here).

After the meal, the chef sent out a plate of bu√±uelos-esque fried pita chips and whipped cream.  We practically needed to be rolled out of the restaurant.

Prices were extremely modest by Vegas standards, with the full meal for two running just over $30.

The staff at the cafe was friendly and genuinely eager to please.  Service before and during our meal was attentive, with ample refills to my coffee.  There was a slight slump in service when the time came to handle the check, but I am more than willing to let that slide in the face of the excellent experience we had otherwise.

We don't travel to Las Vegas frequently, but I am sure we'll be back here the next time we come around.  In the meantime, please do yourselves a favor and check this place out!",cRX8v3AOcOqE--6bLFK3bg,1,1,5,RCNCLTcNaQXbVFmErVyYUA

1412239,2017-11-12,2,8fFTJBh0RB2EKG53ibiBKw,"Chloe wanted pancakes and we were across town, a side we rarely travel to. We searched ""pancakes"" near our ""current location"" and Zenaida's Cafe popped up. 5 stars and about 150 reviews?!  Hmmmmmm...our curiosity was sparked! 

We pulled up. It looked like a little ""homemade"" Italian restaurant from out front. 

We walked in, and I was utterly confused.  The decor definitely throws you off.  There's this colorful tile that really doesn't do much for the space, and an awkward lounge spot right near the front door with fake fruit in a bowl and everything. Hmmmmm....

The tables are not very inviting...the overall look of the restaurant is not really enticing. If it didn't have 5-Stars, we would have walked out before we even sat down.  There must be something about the food or Yelp has really done us wrong! 

We were seated in a 2-top off to the side of the room.  The waiter came by to take our drink orders.  I requested a decaf coffee and he quickly responded ""it's instant!"" I scrunched up my nose and politely declined.  ""We will just take a water then..."" This place is not off to a good start.  I didn't know restaurants would ever serve instant coffee in this day & age haha! 

We couldn't quite decide what to get. For me, the menu is really limited.  A lot of bacon / pork / beef options but I don't eat any of those things.  I settled for the basic breakfast with 2 eggs, turkey sausage, breakfast potatoes and English muffin (even though I can't eat gluten). They don't have gluten-free options.  Chloe ordered the waffle. 

As we waited for our meal, the waitress brought over a pail of homemade chips with garlic aioli. THEY WERE SO GOOD.  Thin, not overly crispy, and seasoned to perfection.  The aioli was good, but it wasn't needed. The chips were amazing as a stand-alone. 

Our food was served quickly.  My eggs were perfect.  I was actually really impressed with how perfectly ""over medium"" they were.  Turkey sausage was just OK.  You can't really rate an English muffin. They are always good haha! 

Chloe's waffle, on the other hand, was INCREDIBLE.  The waffle itself was fluffy, thick and served to the perfect texture. It was covered with homemade whipped cream that I think was sprinkled with cinnamon.  There were fresh cut strawberries covering the top of the waffle.  It was soooooooo good.  She didn't use any of the syrup provided. The whipped cream was just the perfect sweetness to compliment the waffle. On the side, Chloe opted for the thick-cut bacon. She said it was amazing. 

After our meal, they brought out some homemade cookies complements of the chef. The cookies were topped with their homemade whipped cream. The cookies were warm and delicious.  We took 2 to go, shared one at the table.  Wow. 

The service was decent. The chef came out to touch tables before we were served, but had he come out after we ate, I would have thanked him for such a perfect meal.  With all of the chain restaurants and stuck-up chefs on the strip that just leave their name on the marquee while rarely making an appearance, I appreciated the fact that this chef came out to greet his guests and ask how everything is tasting. 

I'm not sure if/when we can go back because it's clear across town, but this place deserves the 5 star rating it has.  Don't be thrown off by the decor.  It's really not an issue if the food is THAT delicious!",Te7_l78PIzdfiu9ki3Jrbg,6,5,5,bGVtHmzSnVtJPd4X71DJXw

Zenaida's was a great pick because they have dishes for meat eaters and some vegetarian choices, as well. I'm talking well thought out items, not the usual afterthought dishes that you get from most establishments. 

I was torn between the scrambled tofu dish with rice and the breaded/fried eggplant lettuce cups. I ended up ordering a dish off the weekly specials list, the Vegan Stack. Grilled onions and shredded potatoes were layered with two jerk-rubbed, grilled tofu steaks. Chopped tomatoes and red onion topped the stack for a good mix of raw and cooked veggies. Everything was well seasoned and full of flavor. The jerk spice made that dish. 

During our meal, the chef stepped out to greet and thank us for joining them for breakfast. Along with the service from our sweet server, I'd say they provided us with an excellent overall dining experience. 

After our meal, we were presented with two warm chocolate chip cookies, adorned with whipped cream and caramel drizzle, compliments of the chef. I cannot think of a sweeter gesture than this. The cookies were just the way I like them, soft and chewy; simple and comforting, all at once. The care and attention we received felt like we were dining at a family member's home.

We were given complimentary homemade potato chips with aioli (really aioli, not just commercial mayonnaise mixed with stuff) upon arrival/after ordering and they were pretty good. We ordered shrimp and grits, biscuits and gravy, and chicken and waffles. The grits were sooo cheesy (just the way we like 'em) and the gravy was delicious and made the dish rich. Biscuits were fluffy and although the gravy had a different taste than what we were accustomed to (a little sweet with some seasoning I didn't recognize), the spicy sausage really made the dish come together and balanced out the sweetness of the gravy. The waffle was fluffy and moist, not hard and dry like a lot of other places! The chicken was lightly battered and had great flavor, too. Also loved the caramel sauce on top of the chicken and waffles.

After our meals were finished, they brought out complementary fresh baked cookies-- honestly as a pregnant woman this sealed the deal for me to return! They were still warm from the oven, soft, and gooey. 

Thank you, we will be back!!!!",4slxBUw4gqvUpMynoUN6dg,4,0,5,kgcLBmpcD5D51u8O5EK1Xg

Not that I needed any changes made to my order, but I'm sure he'd be willing to accommodate to any modifications. His eggs benedict was one of the best I've ever had for breakfast, and I think I'll be skipping lunch and possibly dinner too because of how filling the meal was. The eggs were perfectly poached the way I liked (meaning that when I popped the center with my fork, the yolk gushed out in all its glorious-gooey creaminess), and even though I prefer thin bacon, the thicker and meatier bacon that came with the eggs was very flavorful.  The side of breakfast potatoes were just as tasty, lightly salted, and slightly crisp.  I wish I didn't have to wait a several more hours for my stomach to digest before I can dig into the homemade cinnamon roll that I also ordered to-go... Look for Zenaida's Cafe right next to the State Farm insurance office.  The outside of the cafe doesn't really stand out among the other businesses in the shopping plaza where it's located, but the food inside sure does!  Support the small chef-owned eateries and give Zenaida's cafe a try!

Sooo, a few weeks later... I went back to grab just a small lunch of chicken wings and a side of fries, but my 'quickie' lunch turned into a mini feast of 2 generous portions of freshly cooked fries (I didn't know plain fries came with my order of wings, but the garlic rosemary fries were too tempting to pass up), 7 pieces of succulent, Southern style wings with hot sauce and homemade bbq sauce on the side, and an unexpected complimentary cookies n cream (thank-you-Chef-for-ruining-my-diet) dessert which I gladly made extra room for in my already full stomach!

Ambiance: Super casual! It feels like walking into grandmas house for breakfast. The decor is all types of mixed and super comfy/inviting. 

Service: It was good. We spoke to 3 different people during our visit. First was the young lady who came to take our drink orders. She wasn't very friendly and seemed annoyed/ in a hurry. My mom asked a question about the menu and she was pretty short with her. Looked like she was in a big hurry but there were only 4 other parties at the restaurant with us. Our server was a nice guy! He was professional and took care of us, also had a little sense of humor which brightened up the mood! Last, the chef personally came out and asked how our food was which was a huge plus, he was so sweet and you can tell he genuinely cares about what he does and puts a lot of love into it.

Food: Everything was delicious! We started off with the avocado toast, the toast was crunchy on the outside soft and fluffy on the inside, the flavor, presentation and composition were incredibly amazing making this one of my favorite dishes! For my entree I ordered the Eggs Benedict with potatoes and everything was amazing! The tick cut bacon was my favorite part but it's definitely a classic dish I recommend. My mom ordered the tofu scramble and she loved it, it was a good size to share! For dessert we ordered the cinnamon roll and wow! It was soft, warm, and creamy with fresh fruit and a delicious icing on top. Last we're the freshly baked cookies. The ooey gooey delicious baked and delivered from heaven chocolate chip cookies. Y'all I'm not kidding these were the best, with a caramel drizzle and whipped cream. I'm telling you, you'll love it!

I ordered Tremaine's Biscuits & Gravy. I have found a great love for freshly baked buttery biscuits in flavorful country gravy in recent months. And unfortunately, I found today's dish to be lacking in flavor. The biscuits were dry and the country gravy tasted like it was missing something. I added a little salt in hopes that it would bring the flavors to life; however, that did not work out as I was hoping. The dish came with four sausages - which were very flavorful and easily my favorite part of the dish. In my opinion, it was short of average and not worth the $10 price tag.

I had very high hopes for Zenaida's after reading all the amazing Yelp reviews and I ended up a little disappointed. I would definitely be willing to give Zenaida's Cafe a second chance - but maybe next time a different dish...",Ih85YhFRDzOnB09yS__94g,4,3,3,Wg9tKCDtLLIZZbHGfTRNvg

In town visiting family, searched for a breakfast place and hit the jackpot with Zenaida's. 

Nice, strong coffee. Great start. 

When I couldn't decide between two dishes, Eric did a nice job helping me to choose.
Awesome food! We both totally enjoyed both meals.

Hubby ordered the Collins Breakfast Burger. So yummy!. He described it as one of the best breakfasts he has had in a long time. Delicious homemade burger. Everything about the burger was just so good. Carmelized onions, medium burger, over easy eggs all done right.

I went with the Sausage Monte Cristo. While I'd argue it wasn't really a Monte Cristo as it wasn't deep fried, it was delicious. The spicy house chicken sausage had a kick to it and the ham was so tasty. Served on a toasted baguette, this was a really nice breakfast sandwich. 

Overall, a great experience and highly recommend to all my Vegas friends.",ueUE6F8FEbF1hiBDQBMimQ,4,1,5,_cUcMCkj_PapCU4tIOt4CQ

I had the egg benedict, it was very tasty with very thick bacon. I couldn't eat all the bacon. Hubby and son had the breakfast burrito and cinnamon roll. They said the burrito was very good and could see why this place gets 5 stars. The cinnamon roll is very sweeet with frosting, whipped cream and strawberries on top.

Eggs and sausages perfectly done. Diced potatoes seasoned and served hot. They were so good. One of our diners ordered the avocado toast for us to share and it really was  an unusual, and interesting dish. We loved it. No complaints here.
The owner/chef Sterling, came over to our table and spoke with us. A very friendly man who seems to love his job. The tall toke said he knew what he was doing. Sterling's daughter Carmen, was hostess and server. Not only cute as a button but a sweet bubbly personality.. and very efficient.

3088846,2017-08-12,0,8fFTJBh0RB2EKG53ibiBKw,"You know when you're afraid to try new places because it may not be as good as you thought it would be? Zenaida's is the complete opposite. It's the kind of place that makes you want to kick yourself for not going there sooner. 

The location and signage makes it a little hard to see and find. I first saw it when we went to Taco y Taco. We decided to stop by today for breakfast and the restaurant was decently busy. Jazz music was playing in the background. We ordered the avocado toast to start, my boyfriend had the biscuits and gravy and I had the tofu scrambled. Along with our avocado toast the waitress brought out a basket of chips with aioli. The chips seemed homemade, they were thin, salty, and as long as a full potato. 

This was my first experience having avocado toast and it was unreal. The garlic of the toast blended perfectly with the creamy avocado and the tomatoes were juicy. It was a perfect starter and I officially know what the hype is with avocado toast.  

Now my boyfriend gets biscuits and gravy pretty much everywhere that offers it. This biscuits and gravy blew his mind. He is convinced it's the best he's ever had. The gravy wasn't white and coagulated, it was full of sausage chunks. The biscuits were dense and split in two so there was a great balance of gravy to biscuits. To top it off they add hot links! This reminds me of how every breakfast in Alaska comes with reindeer sausage. I could have just eaten the hot links as a breakfast. 

By the time I got to my tofu scramble I was pretty full already. The scramble was presented on a long plate in a log formation, similar to how fried rice is served. It was full of huge chunks of broccoli, cauliflower, rice, and mushrooms. If you don't really like tofu, go ahead and get this scramble because it's very well hidden and it's basically like a breakfast vegetable fried rice. My favorite part was the furikake and nori tucked inside. 

The meal ended with a warm chocolate chip cookie for both of us. My boyfriend was seriously smiling the entire time we were there. We can't wait to come back and try everything from the zucchini fries to the monte cristo to the chicken wings.

Delightful!

I ordered up all of the favorites on the menu.

To start we got the cinnamon roll, which was hot and goey! It really had a different taste and texture then your standard run of the meal cinabun type concoction. Super yummy.

Next was the garlic fries. They give you a massive portion of these spuds! Nice and crisp and packed with flavor.

After that was the chicken and waffles, chicken tasted fresh and crisp with a certain coconut hint of flavor. Interesting indeed. Waffle was a nice crispy base for the Carmel drizzle.

Finally was the benny with the home fries.. pretty standard holendaise and was not that eventful.

The service seemed a bit overwhelmed after the morning brunch crowd rolled in. Plus the chief sends out free goodies to tables. We didn't get one but we had already ordered 4 items so we was stuffed.

3446999,2017-04-22,0,8fFTJBh0RB2EKG53ibiBKw,"This is a follow up review to my earlier post, and all I can say is they just keep getting better and better. I'm on their mailing list and each week they send out that week's ""Additions"" which are basically the specials for the week (Wednesday through Sunday).  My taste buds and I are always amazed at the new offerings each week, and more often than not that's what I get.  

This week's additions included a pork loin stack that was incredible. It had blackened pork loin medallions on top of a potato and onion hash and topped with eggs over easy and a tomato-spiked Hollandaise sauce. They finished the meal with a complimentary warm cookie topped fresh whipped cream. 

This is an excellent spot to meet your friends and family for weekend brunch. If you get there before the rest of your party you can enjoy a cup of coffee in their lounge area while checking out the small photo gallery. They serve a Primo Columbian coffee and the servers always keep your cup full. 

They are very adept at handling large groups as well. I arrived one morning just after a party of 14 had been seated, and despite my fears that I was in for a long wait for my meal, I was served just as promptly as always. If you have a large group they will take reservations. 

If you have a sweet tooth be sure to try the cinnamon rolls. Be warned, however, they are huge so you'll probably want to share. The breakfast burger and the eggs Benedict are also excellent choices. The chef makes each order of Hollandaise sauce when you order your meal, so if there is something on the additions menu that includes Hollandaise sauce, go for it!",wmE7kY21MnhX2_wQdeKz7A,0,0,5,butBcdCDK9mvVCirvEOQ5g

The food here is good and the service was excellent. The servers were very attentive and the Chef even gave us a complimentary dessert. It was a pumpkin bread dessert that we ate up real fast. We ordered the Shrimp and Grits, thick cut bacon, and the Monte Cristo

Shrimp and Grits: This dish was good. The grits weren't overcooked or over seasoned and had a lot of cheese in them. There was also a good amount of shrimp on the plate and came with over easy eggs.  This dish had way too much sauce on the plate, which kind of took over the buttery and cheesy flavor of the grits. Less sauce and this would be almost perfect. 

Monte Cristo: This was a really good breakfast sandwich. The eggs were nice and runny and the bread was not soggy. The potatoes were nice and soft on the inside and crispy on the outside.

Bacon: I wish I would've ordered more of this. Nothing better than extra thick cut bacon.",UJ1EVvkv2GN7aNBj8xm8qQ,0,1,4,JiJWOXwPK45OmiD1GbrkHg

Brought wife here on Sunday morning just after they opened and she had a bit of time trying to find it from the outside.  It is in a shopping center on Trop & Pecos but with minimal and  I mean very little advertising so you know it has to be good if mostly only locals talk about it.

A very small place on the inside with about seats for 40-50 people compared to your major breakfast places that try to herd em in like cattle.  I got the tofu scramble as I am vegetarian and wife got the chicken & waffles with a side of eggs which are about as good as you will anywhere else.  And when I got up to pay,  our server told us to hang out a bit as there was something special coming which was the previously mentioned apple cobbler sampler as a dessert.  Excellent surprise.  What truly truly makes this place special is the attention to detail including what is on the menu and what they are out of or alternative choices.  Service is higher than top notch and if you time it so they are not too busy,  You will enjoy it every time,

For starters we ordered avocado toast to shared. This is my first time having legit avocado toast and I am happy I had it here. It comes in 5 pieces and there is a small salad on top of the toast. The avocado toast was delicious! The toast, avocado, tomatoes and onion all perfectly blended together to make this one dish.

My sister order the waffle and turkey sausage. The waffle had whip creme and strawberries. It was a yummy and fluffy waffle. The whip cream and strawberries made it even better, I did not even need to use syrup. The turkey sausage cake in 4 pieces. They were a good size and was pretty thick. 

I ordered the chicken breast sandwich. The sandwich was big and it came with fries. It was a pesto chicken sandwich with tomatoes. The chicken pieces were huge which I liked. I was only able to finish half of it. 

They also gave us a complimentary dessert! It was 2 fresh baked cookies. It was soft and it put a smile on my face after the first bite. I love cookies and especially since it was fresh it made me even happier. I would pay for this cookie, so I can take it home to eat. It was a surprising and perfect dessert to end the meal.

They also have jazz playing. Not ""let's-play-a-Michael-Jackson-song-and-add-a-saxophone-to-it"" smooth jazz, no this is straight ahead jazz. I enjoy that on a lazy Sunday.

We received an order of fresh potato chips and sauce. Compliments of the chef.

My wife had the biscuits and gravy. The hot links were just spicy enough. Interesting that they use a brown gravy instead of the usual. 
I ordered the eggs Benedict. After I ordered, the staff informed me that they had run out of the slab bacon, so I had to settle for the regular ham. It was okay. The hollandaise had a bit more lemon than I usually like but it was not off-putting. I was a little upset. If I have my taste buds ready for something, I do not appreciate substitutions well. I'm whiney? Sure! Do I pay for my food? Yes! So, I guess I can act like a disappointed middle schooler if I want. Usually, after careful thought and reflection, I can appreciate what I had, but in this case, I really was intrigued by this ""slab bacon"" and was quite disappointed by getting something less. I get it. It's popular. I can understand limit of product. I thought we were there early enough. Maybe because it was the day after the time change...who knows. It certainly did not take away from the quality of the meal nor the staff. Both were impeccable.

After our meal, the chef sent out moist chocolate chip cookies with yummy cream sauce. Very good.

So, the verdict was, we liked it well enough to try it again and I would definitely recommend giving this place a try. I'm sure you will dig it.",KQqDOlCMgVbdfLWUpFjQeg,3,1,4,9umMvufBcbXbu0_pCuRbxg

4186734,2016-11-03,2,8fFTJBh0RB2EKG53ibiBKw,"My husband was looking for a nice place for breakfast on a Sunday morning, and was wanting something different. He found it!

We were greeted as soon as we walked through the door. After looking at a few photos on yelp, we thought that there was a regular menu of items to choose from. We like to split a meal, and maybe get a side of something as well. We soon realized that we were given a Brunch Menu. (update 1/11/17 ***I have been informed by another Yelper that they are no longer serving Brunch) This is not what we had been anticipating, but the price was so amazing at $13.95/ person. And on the menu was Eggs Benedict, so I was sold. 

There were 3 courses for the brunch. I chose the Yogurt Parfait, Eggs Benedict and an Apple Cobbler. My husband chose a traditional Fresh Smoked Salmon Platter, Eggs Benedict and Cheesecake (this one was to go).

We each got a coffee and water. Our waitress brought a plate of large cut lemons for our waters, and brought us fresh brewed coffees. They do not bring around a pot to refill the coffees, but rather bring a fresh mug. The coffee was strong, but good. 

My yogurt parfait had blueberries and raspberries along with a half of a strawberry as garnish. The yogurt, granola and fruit were all wonderful. I could have eaten another, but this one was huge! It was just so good. The smoked salmon platter had red onion, capers, egg, tomatoes, Dijon and salmon of course. It came with soda crackers, or what reminded me of them. We were also given freshly made potato chips that were seasoned wonderfully. They were thin and crisp, and were paired with a tasty aioli. 

Chef Sterling came out to our table and talked with us a bit. He asked if we were enjoying our meal so far. It was great to learn that he had been the executive chef at the Wynn, and that he had recently opened this awesome restaurant. He asked if he could go ahead and start our Eggs Benedict, and then proceeded to prepare them. After they were brought to our table, he came out to let us know that he uses hand carved, slab cut bacon in his benedict. OH MY GOSH!!! I ALWAYS get bacon instead of Canadian bacon, but hand carved...slab...cut..Wow. I didn't even know this existed. I took a photo of our bacon from the side. You need to look at it, it is so thick. Yum! He makes his hollandaise sauce for each order as well. It was light and flavorful. His potatoes were tender and very slightly crispy as if they were flash fried. The seasoning was perfect. We could not eat all of our breakfast, so we asked for to-go boxes. But then we had an apple cobbler because, why not?! 

AMAZING. It truly was. The apples were sweet and wonderful, nice and hot with a side of vanilla ice cream. I did not ask if the ice cream was homemade, but it sure tasted like it could have been. I would not doubt it. It was creamy, and perfect with the hot cobbler. 

Chef Sterling's attention to detail is impeccable. This was the best dining experience that we have had in a very long time, and it was just supposed to be a simple breakfast. What a treat. We are definitely coming back to try out more of Chef's goodies. You must come here. You will not be disappointed. He does not advertise, and mentioned Yelp! He asked if we had heard of it (umm...maybe! :D ) So come on Yelpers, check this place out! We wish Chef Sterling all of the best.",bnk8hI3N5tprKm_lMK4I-w,12,6,5,k_6liCiUQtq6TEWckAXICA

It seems that I'm on a never-ending quest to find that quaint little local breakfast/brunch place that is simultaneously no frills and spectacular. Also, said place must not be overrun. A hidden gem, if you will.

There are a million breakfast and brunch options in this town and most of them are doing a fine job. Few are going above and beyond. Zenaida's is one of the few.

I don't go out for breakfast all that often, despite most of my bookmarks being for breakfast places. I love breakfast. I'm just not too keen on the that side of noon. So, when I am going out to breakfast it becomes a big decision as to where to go. I had had Zenaida's bookmarked for a while, and only put it on my to try list because it was close by with 5 stars on Yelp. 

When we arrived we received a warm greeting. We were instructed to sit anywhere we liked. Within a few minutes the server took our drink order and while she was gone to get them, a 2nd server stopped to make sure she had been over and drinks were on the way. It made me feel like they had a lot of team mentality to ensure the customer was always taken care of.

We weren't super hungry so we decided to share a cinnamon roll & the chicken in waffles. After we ordered they brought is house made chips with a bloody Mary aoli. Honestly, I can't think of any other breakfast places with give you something like this at breakfast. Plus, it was really delicious. I don't even like aoli, but I was all over this. The chips we're fantastic.

 My husband is a bit of a cinnamon roll connesieur, and this one did not disappoint! Not only was this cinnamon roll fresh and delicious, but it had a beautiful presentation that I just wasn't expecting from a little whole in the wall breakfast place. Every time I go to Zenaida's, this will be a must. Fresh baked & served warm.

The chicken & waffles, which aren't normally my thing, we're also great. I like my chicken crispy and this was crispy with a hint of sweetness. The waffle tasted great, but I would have preferred that to be crispy as well, and it was more on the cakey side.

As a special treat, we were given warm gooey chocolate chip cookies from the chef at no charge. A completely unexpected, but extremely appreciated surprise. They were amazing.

While we ate, I was listening to the next table over talking about Zenaida's food. It appeared to be a family of 1/2 locals and 1/2 visiting from parts unknown. The locals were raving about the food and said their Mac n Cheese ""the most decadent thing you'll ever eat"".

I don't know why I dragged my feet checking this place out, but I've been fantasizing about that cinnamon roll, and I can't wait to go back.

Zenaida's is clean, the food is great, and the service is outstanding.",4guhHcnzrximsz-DeEvskg,1,1,4,Vw3xnVR03ERVE9_UTYPN2g

They have their regular menu + a today's special menu. We ordered the tri tip on a baguette, nacho style fries, quinoa vegan burger, and cookies and cream for dessert. The tri tip sandwich and quinoa burger was amazing. Even the salad you can tell all the veggies and ingredients were carefully picked out. There were no bruises on any of the greens, I was so surprised! The chef came up to us and made sure we were enjoying the food.

Ok waited long enough, we walked out. Have to admit that is was gutsy on the owners part to chase us down at our car and beg us to give them another try. We did. Again food was awesome, spot on. We had the avocado toast, which was great. I had eggs benedict, very yummy. Hubby had the corned beef, homemade. The minus star is for the growing pains. I hate bad food, but bad service is no fun either. The owners were great. Someone else was not happy and went out yelling.

The staff is so friendly and welcoming. You really do feel like you're part of a cool family that knows how to cook really well. The atmosphere is kind of kitschy and funky. And the little extras that they give you, like the homemade potato chips with aioli at the beginning to the meal and the cookies with cream at the end, really makes it special. 

It's really kid friendly as well. My girlfriend brings her baby and the staff always googles over her and brings her little animal crackers or fruit to enjoy.

I almost didn't want to write this review because others would find out about it. But, I also want them to stay in business.",zJevHgy0bvSl-I_kA1ajxQ,0,0,5,1lyPVVTLOS-PZ8yqt3wuBw

5448222,2017-11-27,0,8fFTJBh0RB2EKG53ibiBKw,"We had shrimp and grits and turkey breakfast sandwich. 
The only thing I have to say about this place is the food was a little too greasy. However, the complimentary apple and berry cobbler definitely made up for it, and the fact that the chef came out to greet every table separately made all the difference to me. 
On the other hand, I would have enjoyed the shrimp and grits way better if it had less gravy. The amount of shrimp in it was very generous though ! 
Homemade chips with their homemade aioli sauce really nice touch !!
Family feel with great genuine little touches made this place better in our book!

They also brought us free chips with a delicious homemade dipping sauce. At the end of our meal the cook came out and thanked us for coming in, which was super nice.

waffles. Seriously, c'mon, are you guys this good at everything? I didn't try the chicken, but the waffles were amazing! Truly worth it just for the waffles alone. But don't forget the Avocado Toast. I had the Mac and Cheese with gator style sausage. I was disappointed, that there wasn't more! I was stuffed about 2/3 the way through it but I just couldn't stop eating that creamy, slightly spicy, bowl of nirvana! I haven't even told you about the cookies the chef sent out when we were done! Real whipped cream, soft, gooey cookies. Still warm! If I lived in Vegas, I'd be here daily, hands down the best place to go and just minutes from the strip! The guys in the kitchen are Gastric Gods!

I had the breakfast burrito and it came out in a green tortilla and was STUFFED with eggs.  They put a sausage link in the middle (not chopped just one long link) and a little cheese but it was so eggy I couldn't eat it.  I'd prefer they cut the meat up, use less eggs and put the potatoes inside.  My husband ordered the Montecristo sandwich and it was excellent.  I would try them again but order something different.

We got a warm greeting and seated immediately.  Just about everything on the menu looked awesome.  I decided on pancakes and my husband had biscuits and gravy.   But first one of the servers brought out homemade potato chips with a red pepper aioli. That was really yummy!!  The pancakes were really yummy and hallelujah somebody that knows how to cook pancakes!  I am so tired of getting half cooked pancakes!  My husband liked his biscuits and gravy.   The gravy wasn't what he expected since is was a brown gravy instead of light.   But it was really tasty. Oh I forgot to mention SUPER fast service!  Then at the end, our server brought us two little bites of pumpkin bread pudding complements of the chef.  It was really yummy as well. I just love little touches like that.

You would never really know this place was here unless you stumbled upon this parking lot. We, however, found this lovely place on Yelp. Thank you, yelp. It truly is a remarkable place! Home-good feeling, wonderful aromas, a home-town setting. 

Christmas music, happy employees, regular customers. A place you just want to be!

We started off with the cinnamon roll and boy was it out of this world! Sweet cream icing, whipped cream, some sort of drizzle, and berries on top with cinnamon. The smell is something memorable. SO delicious! I've never thought to eat a cinnamon roll with fruits but boy was it yummy! It was pretty big, yet we still ate it all. Our main courses arrived. Jaw dropping! The presentation was perfect and the food even better. Monte Cristo all the wayyy. The sandwiches cut perfectly in the middle. Eggs also very well cooked. Potatoes were how potatoes should be - crispy on the outside, soft on the inside. And everything was just so amazing.

Dessert of two warm chocolate chip cookies with whipped cream was thoughtfully made by chef, who also came by and made sure everything was going well. And it was just an all around amazing experience. Babe and I are excited to come back to try some other things on the menu.

Ordered the pork loin stack and eggs Benedict. Both were great. The pork loin had heat but it was a nice heat. Also....the eggs on the Benedict had that perfect pop when you break the yolk. The potatoes had a good crisp crunch. 

We both cleaned our plates. 

Staff were all friendly, including the chef who came out to meet us.

The only down side was the decaf was instant.  But it wasn't enough to downgrade and didn't take away from the meal significantly. We just couldn't drink regular that morning as one of us works a graveyard shift and would be going to bed soon. 

The chef sent out a surprise gratis dessert of apple berry cobbler. It had a great taste and texture. There were bits of sugar crunch like you find on a creme brulee. Yum!
