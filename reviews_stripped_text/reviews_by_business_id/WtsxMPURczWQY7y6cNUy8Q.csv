It was a GODSEND to find a place like this only a few blocks away. It has the store part plus the cafe where I can get vegan food, drinks, and even DESSERTS! (great for that time of the month) Every time I went in they were so nice, although the lady running the cafe part seemed a little rushed but I never blame the staff for that. I like that I was left alone while I shopped. I usually get that over eager sales person or the one that stands over you. No one said a word that I took a water bottle in & out of my purse the whole time, or gave me weird looks, they just let me shop. When I got to the counter they were SO nice to me. The guy behind the counter even realized 1 of the items didn't have a price and tried to convince his manager to just give it to me for free (he tried!). 

For the person who said they didn't believe the A rating and saw a part of a cockroach on the floor, suck it up! I'm sorry, but LA has a very strict health rating more so than anywhere else. I used to live there, and when I moved here I could not BELIEVE all the roaches! They are huge, they are everywhere, you cannot get rid of them. The high end casinos no doubt spend millions on the best poison that gets reapplied everyday (if not sooner) to every nook and cranny in order to keep their guests from seeing them. It doesn't mean there is a dirty kitchen because you noticed 10% of a cockroach in the corner by the trash can! (I've heard similar stories about NY)

And for the girl (and her friend) who said the cafe staff was sooo rude and slow you couldn't believe it, I would take all her reviews with a grain of salt. I looked at her reviews and about 90% of food places she gives low ratings saying the food was bland or the staff was rude to her (if not both). I'm sorry, but if every time you walk into an establishment people are rude to you, take a step back and look at YOUR attitude.",OQSya1DStf-2a3o9dcHXug,1,0,5,33hHMVEaxpxkMZS6TKDDxw

The employees really know their herbs and products. I've discovered amazing products that I can't get anywhere else in Las Vegas including Chi Tea Green Tea It's a great tasting, extremely potent green tea extract that can be added to just about anything. I'll put it in my water  (especially when I'm feeling run down) to give me a quick antioxidant and immune boost, I also first discovered Braggs, Sprouting jars, Chi Tea Detox and they stock top quality Royal Jelly. The Rainbows End cafe is amazing. I'm a fan of the Carrot and Avocado Soup, Cashew nut spring wrap and legendary Green Goddess sandwich.

OK, so I admit I'm into being health conscious - which led me to choose this place for lunch. Who knew that healthy food now gives those foods fried/drenched in butter/piled high with scrumptious beef a run for their money.

I wanted a Grilled Cheese Roasted Veggie Panini (Oven grilled eggplant, zucchini, yellow squash, roasted red peppers and onions with vegan mozzarella on grilled ciabatta) but hesitated when they said they no longer used eggplant - portobello mushrooms were in their place. Boy am I glad I didn't change my mind. 

I chose a table facing the fountain - quite a pleasant sight and sound, making the few minute wait for the food pass more quickly.

The chiabatta had a touch of a crunch, but just the right softness. The cheese was melted to perfection - how come I can never get that ""balance"" at home??? Stayed soft and runny until the last bite without being too ""gooey"". The mushroom gave the feel of eating meat and the sauce had just a bit of a tiny bite to it. The sandwich was topped with extremely fresh alfalfa sprouts with a small slice of jalapeño pepper on top of each half. The veggies enriched the flavor of everything and gave the sandwich greater depth. While there were many other tantalizing tidbits on the menu, this sandwich hit my ""eat"" spot so thoroughly that I know I'll order nothing else when I return - which won't be long from now.",3IJBR4zpeHtYxzRFuBMCxw,0,0,5,XgdgeibN6zjZMZ1zSIDEXQ

1096038,2012-11-27,2,WtsxMPURczWQY7y6cNUy8Q,"Can you name one thing sets Rainbow's End apart from some other health establishments in town?

Community.

Rainbow's End has much of the same supplements, organic coconut oil, and Celtic salt that can be found in other local stores. What cannot be so easily found at other stores is the (authentic) connection to the Vegas community present at this place. 

In addition to a range of vegan and vegetarian dishes, this small store carries a plethora of goods from local vendors. If that is important to you (like it is to me), go in and check it out.  Look past the ingredient list and ask the helpful employees where the products come from.  Look at the honey. Look at the soaps. Look at the kale chips.  The community focus is evident on their shelves. 

I've attended classes about the history or tea and the science of juicing there as well.   These were not throwaway classes, but were highly informative explorations of each topic. They offer a number of other classes that I may never check out (tai chi, tango, vegan cooking, etc.). I appreciate knowing that they are available.   

This is a great place.",2k8OVAPxlXHsA5X6EIoQpQ,12,3,4,Q0cKEFAfGF2ThqDkSb92_w

They have everything you need here and have been adding more and more stock in their cold cases. I think someone said recently they have fauxs and nice creams added in the cases!

I love eating lunch here. The food simple, fresh, and yummy.

I really love the incense they sell, I don't burn it I just like having it sit around in a vase and the smell permeates around the room without burning. When the smell stops lingering gently spray the sticks with clean cool purified water, a gentle mist will bring them back to life.

While I'm a spoiled girl having Stay Healthy a few blocks away from my house, I like having RE close also because they sell special products others do not order into Vegas.
For example my friends were buying vegan chocolate fair trade Easter bunnies for their kids baskets. I thought that is great customer service.

1798057,2014-08-29,3,WtsxMPURczWQY7y6cNUy8Q,"Simply Divine. Period.

First, I must offer Full disclosure and admit that I am by nature a human T-REX, yes like the dinosaur lol. If it breathed at one point in it's life, I probably ate it....sometimes it may still be breathing, but I digress on that.  *cough* ahem.. 

Anyway, 
It all started out when I was leaving the gym in the area. I was making my way via foot to the Sahara Monorail Station.  I noticed what looked like a neighborhood health food store sitting near the corner of Almond Tree Lane and Sahara Blvd, curiously I decided to step in. I was greeted to the aromatic presence of herbs, incense, and all manner of things considered 'healthy' and life-sustaining.  The inner t-rex in me was already bored and was growling for me to leave this herbivore paradise.  But, I decided that I would instead be a little adventurous and let a healthier head prevail this time. I approach the counter at the front of the store.

I received a pleasant and attentive greeting by Melodie and Sara who were working at the register. I told them that this was my first time here and i'm hungry! Melodie chuckled and then placed me in the extremely capable hands of her young assistant, Sara. Sara and I then proceeded to the back of the store to find the Cafe.  It was here that Sara gave me a thorough and patient overview of every single item on the menu that I had questions about.  I told her that I am trying to change my carnivore loving ways, but I still have these...well....needs.  She never snubbed me once for being 'meat-eater' and she then highly recommended to me the, ""Green Goddess Sandwich"".  Just reading the ingredients of this all vegetable sandwich made my stomach growl with anger.  No meat?! Are u for real with this? I thought to myself.  But, being the gentleman that I try to be, I just smiled and took her recommendation and she even let me add some 'vegetarian bacon' on top!  I also ordered the 12 Bean Chili and a side of non-dairy potato salad.   

Meanwhile, waiting for my order, Melodie then appeared to give me a mini tour of the fully fleshed art gallery located inside the cafe area to pass some time while the food was being readied. I found some of the artwork on the walls to be so inspiring that I began to visualise some of these pieces on my wall!  Shortly threafter, my meal arrives.  And, almost instantly I knew that I had clearly underestimated this place. 

That sandwich was sooo big and stuffed that it literally was falling apart when I picked it up!  The Green Goddess sandwich and the special sauce that accompanys this sandwich was magnificent.  And, coming from a guy who has eaten almost an entire cow in one sitting, this is really saying something.  

With that said, I absolutely, positively MUST give kudos to Sherry, the cook. 
The pita bread, the intricate layers of vegetables, the very texture of the sandwich itself was so good that my journey to the proverbial 'light-side', where alledgedly all the vegetarians, live and breathe was almost complete lol.  That was a mean, green sandwich!  And, yes with that, Rainbow End Natural Foods has earned yet another loyal and regular customer.  

I'm giving it a full 5 Stars for their ability to make meals that not only make a carnivore not miss 'meat!', but also managed to nearly 'convert' the same said carnivore with just the magic of one meal! 

See you there next week!",n8EU0_mKr2TX8iz9a7yHxg,5,0,5,9X5Da6QJhf4wDD-VinKJBw

Shout out to the tea aisle: loose leaf varieties are available, as well as a novel iced-tea-travel-brewer bottle that I will probably go back to purchase. Bottom unscrews to add your tea leaves into the strainer, screw back on and fill with water, brew-drink-reuse. It doesn't get much easier than that.

The cosmetics and beauty product section has several tester bottles to try, which is a little unusual for a smaller place. Everything here appears to be carefully vetted before being featured, The Cream in particular is worth the raves (and the price, and the location behind the counter, as well as my first-born). Candles are also great here, particularly the fresh cotton scent.

But the deli counter in the back is what really drew me in: the GREEN GODDESS pita sandwich is $8 and packed with shredded carrots and beets, tomatoes, red onions, and sprouts, accented with veganaise and a side-packet of Goddess dressing.

Not a large produce section- but you can count on what they do have is local and fresh.

Extracts, teas, vitamins, books, raw foods, desserts, clothes, toiletries, energy bars. ALL are hard to find anywhere else- albeit a bit pricier than whole foods or sunflower market, but then again you are supporting the independent business here! Support and spread the Love ;)

The store is a bit dim and the cashier doesn't seem very happy. While I realize they're probably trying to be Eco-friendly - the dim lighting doesn't help with selling product. Nor do they have any special sales or discounts. Visual appeal as a business trying to sell products is important in my opinion.

I am not a vegan or vegetarian but I do like to eat more of a plant based diet with some clean protein thrown into the mix. As far as the store goes, there are a lot of supplements for vegans/vegetarians/meat-eaters alike. There's a small selection of food products including refrigerated food products. I noticed they had ezekiel bread which I eat but it's definitely not as cheap as say Sunflower Market sells it for. Even though I had read reviews of the food, I came here thinking I was NOT going to order any food from their small cafe but once I saw someone walking away with their to-go order of the Green Goddess sandwich, I figured why the hell not?!

Less than ten minutes later, the nice waitress was calling my name with my food. Yay! I ended up leaving with a weird combo of my sandwich, nutritional yeast and a Raw Revolution bar...which by the way, they do not have a big selection of bars :( Oh well, shouldn't be eating those anyways.

The sandwich looked pretty good and was served with purple corn tortilla chips, a salsa and some other freaking amazing sauce that I have no idea what it was...but it was amazing!!!! The sandwich itself was amazing too. Sprouts, tomatoes, purple onions, veganaise, daiya?, shredded beets and carrots. Every bite was heaven. The plan was to eat half for lunch today and the other half for tomorrows lunch...um, yeah, it will probably be gone before then.

I can't wait to go back and try the other stuff on the menu including some of the desserts.

For any raw foodists, there are raw meals on the menu and even some already prepared raw ""pastas"" in the refrigerated section that looks pretty good.

It was delicious! Each bite had different layers of taste due to the amount of veggies in the sandwich.  

The 1st layer was fresh and light due to the cucumbers, cheese and sprouts. The 2nd layer was a little creamy because of the tomatoes, avocado and eggless vegenaise. The 3rd layer was the best, crunchy carrots and sweet taste of beets!

2395723,2008-07-08,7,WtsxMPURczWQY7y6cNUy8Q,"Ahh, the Follow Your Heart of Las Vegas. A good week before I left LA for my weekend Vegas getaway, I knew that I would be eating at least one of my meals at Rainbow's End. With few vegetarian and next to NO vegan options in this whole God-forsaken desert city, Rainbow's End is a legitimate Find, with a capital 'F.'

...But I'm not sure I believe in the cafe's 'A' health rating all that much. Even as I was ordering my food at the counter, my 6th sense-crazy-Krissy-dirty-restaurant alarm bells went off. But as I was desperate to have some legitimately vegetarian food, I hushed them in the same way I hush a toddler I babysit who loves to scream for her 'juicy' when it's three hours past her bedtime.

The food itself was pretty good -- I had the Green Goddess pita sandwich and J had the Awesome BLT. Was it as good as LA's Follow Your Heart? Not quite. Was it very similar to something I could make at home? Absolutely. But was I in the position to negotiate? Hell no! So I ate that sucker up and practically licked my plate clean. Luckily, our waiter was extremely warm and friendly, and so he didn't call me out on my Hoover vacuum cleaner impression.

All was well until - post meal - I decided to go to the bathroom. As soon as I walked in, the bells started ringing again, only this time I wasn't feeling crazed and ravenous with hunger, so I was more open to scoping out the place for dirty details. My eyes lit upon the trash can, with something dark and ugly taking up residence near the trash can's edge on the cracked linoleum floor.

No... It couldn't be...! But it was. A dead cockroach. Actually, it was a dead half-a-roach, because the only parts left were two upside down legs and half a shell. But I know my roach parts. And even more upsetting was that it looked like it had been a BIG MFer, and that its remnants had been there for a long time, overlooked and uncleaned. Ewwwwwww...

The optimist in me is still doling out 4 stars, because I want so badly for this place to survive and multiply -- Vegas needs veggie options desperately. Needless to say, if this place were in LA, I would NOT be giving out 4 stars, based on the bathroom bug.

I really hope someone from Rainbow's End reads this, because as much as I want them to thrive, I also want for them to be better restaurateurs and keep up on their cleaning and exterminating.",lOFBy0gVGOV0VapjoNZdlQ,6,4,4,_ZImNiuYw0RvwkqOvNiong

With only one server, you're forced to wait patiently as you sit back and listen to the sitar music.  Once your food arrives, it's well worth the wait.

Last week I purchased some Jason cocoa butter hand and body lotion along with some vegan chocolate peanut butter cups and some other vegan chocolate items.  When I got home I ate one of the pieces of vegan chocolate peanut butter cups that I purchased and it was not melted and was delicious.  The next day I popped out of the shower and went to put on my new lotion.  A little back story about this lotion is that I purchase it around every 3 weeks or so at a different store.  This is the first time I've ever purchased this lotion at rainbows end.  When I opened the lotion it was liquid and runny and pouring out of the bottle and not at all like the same consistency I am accustomed to with this exact same brand and scent of lotion.  I decided to put it on anyway and after a few minutes I realized I had to get back in the shower because it had gone rancid and it was no longer any good and the smell was just awful.  Next I called the store and told them about the lotion and asked if I would be allowed to exchange it for a new one from them.  The woman on the phone went on to give me a 20-minute lecture about how things go bad in the car even in five minutes and it's probably because I left it in a hot car.  Now remember I purchase chocolate with the same product and I opened the chocolate and nothing was melted. This same woman went on to tell me that even if I'm buying lotion I should bring  a cooler full of ice to the health food store  so it doesn't go bad.  So today a week after I purchased it, I went back to the store and the same woman who I spoke to on the phone told me they would not be returning my money or exchanging the product for a new one.  She advised me that I should call the company Jason to have it replaced or refunded.  What I am sharing with you is that I did not know about a no refund and no exchange policy when I purchased something from this company and I am warning anyone who does purchase something from here that this was the case for me.  The customer service here leaves something to be desired.  Not only was I blamed for the product not being good but I was completely denied any type of refund or exchange.

She informed us of are options & we put together a ""faux"" chicken wrap with a dressing on the side. She told us if was a gluten free dressing, once we got are meal it was not in fact gluten free nor was everything on are wrap that we ordered.

4430113,2014-06-20,0,WtsxMPURczWQY7y6cNUy8Q,"So this is what Whole Foods, Trader's Joe, and Strouts use to look like in the olden days.  My friend wanted to meet there for lunch, so when I walked in, I was a tad confused about the concept, I was expecting a restaurant.  The 'cafe' is to the side the store and the kitchen is in the back.  I get that this is a 'cafe' inside of a natural food store so perhaps 'restaurant' personnel/ charm or temperament and skills are not necessarily available.  No problem!!

Not a vegan or vegetarian myself, I settled for the mushroom burger, which was freaking amazing.  We ordered from the back, per the instructions on the menu card on the table, and the food was delivered to us.  The portabella mushroom was cooked to perfection and the organic potato salad, one of the side choices, was pretty awesome as well.  I was expecting bland, tasteless food but I was pleasantly surprised. I would definitely go back for another try of something else.  

The 'cafe' was quaint and décor was old town Vegas.  It's nice to get a glimpse of what Vegas was like back in the days, you see it with the patrons that walk in, the location, and the overall feel.  For the most part, staff was polite, nice and welcoming... just don't forget, you're not in a restaurant.",dPMW-BVUPFT5r3MgDK3l2Q,7,3,4,yz4nojJou11zJ9ceQKiwtg

After a long while since I missed out on Honey T.'s UYE ages ago and had this bookmarked ever since, I had this random hour between a meeting and going back to work.  I went to the ordering counter - and was told I must must must order the green goddess for my first go.

I decided to have it as it is and with the chips and fresh salsa.  I took it back to work and ate it there - fresh pita, onions, cucumbers, tomatoes, carrots, beets, avocado, vegan-aise and soy cheese I believe plus sprouts....some dressing on the side, and the blue corn chips and delicious salsa.

I am not a fan of condiments usually so next time I will just get the avocado-beet sandwich - I did not enjoy the vegan-aise.  However, the cheese was fine and all of the veggies were impeccably fresh.  I really can't go wrong with anything that has beets AND avocado AND tomato!  I always say my fave fruits are tomatoes and avocados.  I just love beets too, and it was so tasty.  The market itself was pretty bare so that was not too impressive.  I would probably come back for the avocado beet  sandwich next.  Lunch was $8.",T5KBc5QbwZ-Oj9ApE4vZJA,6,2,3,AoYU6qA13cGkDZA0JyxDJg

4669067,2013-09-06,2,WtsxMPURczWQY7y6cNUy8Q,"I WAS going to give this place a 4 star review...until an unfortunate incident recently.  

I shop at this store from time to time - they have a small selection of natural/organic snack foods and I love that they have a little deli as well (which I haven't had the chance to try).  Trader Joe's and Sprouts have a better selection, but this place is close to my place and I like to support local business.

I'm perusing the aisles after the gym one afternoon, texting on my phone, and generally, minding my own business.  I picked up just 2 or 3 things - some kale, some sort of delicious gluten-free snack, etc - and I headed to the check out line.  As I'm checking out, an older employee says to me:

Old, rude man: ""Did you put something in your purse?""  
Me: *Looks around, confused* ""Umm, I'm sorry, what?""
Old, rude man: ""I think I saw you put something from the shelf into your purse.""  
Me: *Kind of laughs, offended, but more awkward* No.  Definitely not.
Old, rude man with no social skills: ""Can I take a look?""
Me: *in disbelief* ""Yeah - go right ahead.""  *opens purse, shuffles through it for him to see*
Old, rude man:  ""Oh.  Ok.""

End scene.

Look, I get that you're protecting your store - so, if you think you saw me steal something, kudos to you for asking.  However, when you realize that I did NOT, in fact, steal anything, and that you just accused a paying customer or shoplifting, that would be the appropriate time to apologize to said customer...but as I stood there waiting, mouth agape, I realized there would be no apology forthcoming.

Now, I wasn't embarrassed, because well, I'm me....but most people would be mortified.  The fact that he didn't apologize or even acknowledge that he mistakenly accused me of theft is extremely off-putting.  The checker girl didn't say anything either.  It was all a bit odd.  It was so odd in fact, that when I got to my car, I double checked my purse just to make sure nothing had accidentally fallen in!!  (Nothing had.)

Typically I don't really seek out or buy health type foods. But recently I heard that consuming locally produced honey can help reduce allergy symptoms but where to find local honey?!? Turns out this place carries it along with pretty much anything else that the health consumer could desire. I won't get specific since I just don't have much knowledge in this genre but what I can say is that the staff is friendly, the store is clean and well stocked and it even smells really good!...sort of an herb/incense type of aroma. Although, I might not end up doing a ton of shopping here, I'll definitely come back if my honey experiment works and probably also bring my mother and other health conscious friends when they visit. The only reason I gave it a 4 is because it's a bit pricy but from what I know, the prices here seem just about right for these health niche types of products.

My friend's raw vegan tacos weren't as good as what she makes at home, but the avocado veggie burger was a hit with her boyfriend.  One complaint is that blue corn chips come with the sandwich, or you can pay an extra 50 or 75 cents for kettle potato chips?  Kind of a rip-off; don't they both come in big bags and we get a tiny pinch on our plates?  The sodas are cheap, and the cafe seating is comfortable.
