Anyways, I've been here maybe 3 times: 

Once I didn't make it past the line cause 1 I don't like waiting and two I don't like rude people. 

The second time, oh the second time... we waited, we sat, and we go this Fran Dressier sounding waitress, it was like a game show whenever we ordered something she told us it was WRONG! 
She even made a GawdDamn Buzzer noise... 
So of course we all ended up ordering the same thing.... or not..
Cause we all got a bit ticked the eff off and we all left - Hooters were next door and oh yeah the restuarant too..and how can you order wrong at hooters? 

Anyways the last time and final time I actually made it in and actually ordered something and actually ate there, I had a broke friend drooling all over my prime rib so the experience was not that great either..

I say I don't like this place so much that you should take it off your list of places to go eat... ever... in your entire life... that bad.. 

I'd rather chew on a towel in my hotel room cause at least they will come give you new towels 10 mins after you call room service. 

As a matter of fact stay away from that hotel all together. It's beat like an old rug and probably already loaded with dynamite to be demolished but some hooter chick stumbled in -  with a bunch of chicken wings...
I say nay to El Hooters Hotel.

NO NO and NO",Iz73FGDkz_Y3RF6E3JDgTQ,3,2,1,S6kdALDYDbvYU1b2yswmqg

Costing around $5, I expected something magical. And we waited for this magical milkshake for about 10 minutes, before I asked the boy who I'd ordered and paid for the milk shake from about it again. He goes, ""OH!"" and runs in the back and produces said milkshake 20 seconds later. He'd just forgotten immediately after I ordered it, and stood there behind the counter, gazing at us, smiling. Oh, and it was really small. Just a little plastic cup with mooshy chocolate ice cream in it. You know ... it was a lot like a small Frosty.

BUT ... the Dam Breakfast (WHY DON'T WEB SITES PUT PRICES ON THEIR MENUS I'LL KILL 'EM) is so good and so much food. It comes with three eggs, awesome seasoned taters, bacon* or sausage or pork, and biscuits 'n gravy, pancakes, or toast.

I tried the eggs Benedict once there, which was so-so. The sauce just didn't have any taste at all -- it didn't serve its purpose. I did notice that the portions are insanely huge. The steak salad? My friend had to climb over it to talk to me.

I have no problem eating here, especially for their breakfast. I just know better than to expect star service.

*The bacon is unlike any I've ever had before. It's like it's candied. It's so bleeping good.",9zoQR_pQ5SgIixQFyhBDhQ,3,2,3,4cvk9pP2HAWrUz7ETQzIOQ

Took us forever just to get our nachos and when we got our pizza, we just lost our appetite. Our waiter took like 15 mins. just to refill our sodas. Their pizza isn't all that great. Nacho servings are enormous though. If you ever wander at hooters casino, just wait for a table at hooters resturant.",x00GbHWf3R20AJJfiHC5zQ,2,0,1,NPwHyw4dTiY3d_xaxCudhw
5802898,2012-09-17,1,t7pWS0oxwjoZpT-fwQQCiA,"I came here the night before my wedding, it was a treat from my maid of honor. We were a party of 6, not that big or unmanageable and not part of the drunk belligerent crowd either. When we came here we realized very quickly that the service was atrocious. 5 of us ordered water to drink, one person a diet coke and the waiter couldn't even get that right. When our food came out my fiancee (now husband) had gotten wings (as anyone does at a hooters like establishment). When our food came out everything was wrong. My father's burger was wrong, my maid of honor and my pulled pork nachos were wrong, and the worst part was when my husband bit into his wings the freaking thing was bloody. It was like they took the chicken, plucked it's feathers, wiped it's a$$ and made it roll in crumbs. It was so bloody it was practically squawking. When I brought this to the waiters attention he said ""so? What do you want me to do about it?"" at this point I tell the pipsqueak to get me a manager. The manager comes and is like ""So you got raw chicken, big deal"" and I explain we are set to be married the next day and ask him if he ever heard of salmonella. The manager, yes the manager called me a little bitch as I started to make a scene. He refused to comp our meal and we spent the whole night worried about whether we were going to be at the hospital with salmonella poisoning. Don't go here, ever. this was back in 2007 but still it doesn't look like it has improved by any stretch of the imagination.

In summation the chicken was so undercooked that a skilled veterinarian could have saved it.",44yVOcsvnwBnJDkz_0Aufg,1,0,1,yflNmkXKBVZKiEVALjrFTA
