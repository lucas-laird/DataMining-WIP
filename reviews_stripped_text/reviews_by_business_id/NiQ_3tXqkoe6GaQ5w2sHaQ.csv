Some of my favorite menu items are:
- I love the Kid's Meal, especially the enticing Grilled Cheese!  
- Breakfast Toaster (Huge plus that breakfast is served all day)
- Oreo Sonic Blasts (Kind of reminds me of McDonald's McFlurry)
- Strawberry Limeade
- Coneys, Hotdogs, Corndogs
- Tator tots!

Wasn't able to place my order there because there was a credit card stuck in the machine the wrong way. I get back into my car drive to the other side in another stall and press the button to place my order. Finally someone picked up and took my order. There I sit for more than 20 minutes waiting for my food. I watch the drive-through lane get completely helped and all of the people on the patio have their food. So I press the button and ask the person on the other end of the line when I'm going to get my order, they reply oh very shortly. I ask do you think it will be less than five minutes? They didn't answer because they had already disconnected. About five minutes later my food arrives. I asked the employee what took so long and they blamed it on all the other orders they had to fill. They did say they were sorry but offered nothing to compensate me for waiting almost my entire lunch hour for my food.

However, I will say I will not come here for happy hour any longer. Although drinks are half price they want to charge you an arm and a leg for ""extras"". Since when is cherry flavor an up charge? and since when is adding real cherries to your drink an up charge and you have to ask for it? If I order a cherry soda it needs to have at least one real cherry in it. I shouldn't have to ask. When I asked about the up charge for these items on happy hour the manager states ""there has always been a charge for this, but they aren't supposed to charge it in the morning"" REALLY??? Either you charge or you don't... not whenever you feel like it. Then after I provided multiple receipts showing the same exact items purchased days before at happy hour with no up charges the manager states ""well if its that big of a deal to you ill take it off""... ARE YOU SERIOUS??? If its that BIG of a deal? WOW... then I saw the survey on my receipt inside the window. However when I got my drinks a reprinted receipt with no survey was attached. I had to go back and request the survey receipt. When I asked the manager if he specifically didn't give me my survey because of this situation he didn't answer. Just walked inside and got me the correct receipt.Â

These are cold straight out the bag in the parking lot. Have you ever eaten cold tater tots? They leave a film in your mouth and sadness in your heart.

Sometimes there is no one in the dirve-thru line and it is slow. Sometimes there are a ton of people in the drive-thru and it is slow. Sometimes I've come through super quick. Again, the consistent factor is missing.

There are a lot of options and a lot of ways to customize your meal. Their drinks are always great, especially slushies and their Cherry Coke, which I love because they do not skimp on the Cherry flavoring.

4993026,2017-10-08,1,NiQ_3tXqkoe6GaQ5w2sHaQ,This place deserves 1 star! & here's is why ... I've been to this same location 3 different times because it's close to my place and my moms who I like to visit every other week the first time I came here I ordered ocean water which is a blue coconut flavored soda with nerds .. I got to my moms .. the soda omg it was flat & half way melted I was so upset I called the store & complained the manger said to come in whenever & grab one & of course I'm super busy I don't really have time to go back they honestly should of just gave me a refund !! Second time I went there I was gonna give this place another shot ... I ordered a Reece cup blast with extra Reece cups large size which I paid Extra it said so on my receipt so I get to my moms again & what do you know once I dig my spoon inside the ice cream is melted they put way too much whip cream then the ice cream & it was a medium size & no extra Reece cups like I asked three times .. how do you mess up a shake ? Really my order is not ever complicated I order 1 thing !! & of course I call back again & talk to manger he offered me my money back .... still i was upset I was really looking forward to my Reece cup blast !  I haven't been there in a couple months so I decide to give this place another chance I know stupid choice on my part again !! This time I order a number 4 bacon cheeseburger & fries with a shake Reece cup blast I made sure everything was on point with my order making sure they repeat it more then two times which they should do either way repeating someone's order so this doesn't happen !! Anyway I drove to moms like usual starving I grab the Togo bag get out of the car & my bag completely breaks open & all my stuff falls on the driveway !! Like are you serious right now ?!?! It's like I have karma at that place !! Don't they know any better to double bag something that's heavy ?!?  Come on .. sorry this all needs to be said stay away from this location this was my last time here !! I will drive my happy ass 15 mins away to the sonic on Pecos thank you very much .,Lk7-qP05xPYi449sFUjXTA,1,0,1,GF2Op2hLmQjECg5Aksk-LA

The wait on the other hand seems to be a lot longer than most other drive through / sonics. Even if you're ordering the easiest, smallest order, the wait is oftentimes 5+ minutes, without any other customers being there. I don't get it. So come if you have more time to spare than just a quick drive through, in and out experience.",uU2B1vrqkpWJI30xoooabw,0,0,2,BpW3CGo-k5sYqigSBgUu0Q
5127669,2013-12-24,0,NiQ_3tXqkoe6GaQ5w2sHaQ,Great burger and tater tots. I know I can always get a consistently good burger at Sonic. I like how the edges are a bit crisp. Service was good as we sat outside and let the girl on the roller skates come to us. Good shakes and a spicy chicken sandwich. I love the novelty of Sonic but it's not just a gimmick it's plain and simple good burgers.,-AGXyI_K8StzQ7CGehQ2tQ,0,0,4,4PH0eNI9JfCPaK4XL4Kfng

Ok, so that's a reason to closed business? Never heard of such a thing? I understand parking lots need to be cleaned, well who ever is in charge needs to know, Vegas is a 24 hour town and there is companies that clean parking lots after business hours. -Never Again, this location!!",svDxd_2iA7XfeB8wWTa_GA,0,0,1,sqkVheR88EOL1WOwIB2UpA

This Sonic advertises a 2am close time and right as I pulled in the drive-thru they flipped the lights off and have disappeared. All I wanted was a darn drink. How difficult is that? I've now been sitting at the drive-thru window for about 10 min, still no sign of the cowardly employees who flipped off the lights and have vanished into thin air.
SO DISAPPOINTED!!!",M2i3_7egBn_QKuwtk3co4g,0,0,1,2o1aBEDREhTJM7VAzpjFjw

He made my boyfriend and I laugh,  and he even gave us tickets to a car event coming to Las Vegas.  This guy deserves a raise! 

Also,  the popcorn chicken small is sooooooo tiny. Had like 4 pieces in it! Like 4$ Do not recommend.",1xHHUpP2aUdy2vfwbDlXoA,0,0,5,JFxAamGcTSoj8pvL0a14nw

5912038,2017-08-20,1,NiQ_3tXqkoe6GaQ5w2sHaQ,"I usually like going to Sonic when I get that sort of craving. Whether it's a hot dog, to tater tots, to the late night milk shakes. This time I wanted the mozzarella sticks. They didn't taste fresh and I could tell that it was like an old batch or some sort. I've had them before where they melt in your mouth, are extremely hot, and tasty... but this time... no way. I'm most likely gonna stay away from it from now on.

It'd be one star except I'll be back for their happy hour which is every day from 2-5pm. No one can beat their 50% off drinks.",wxQCLMnuVYbdtmQCc2ryZg,1,0,2,-3hkGgOMiANkWGAUysh0fw

This location just sucks.

Wrong food- forgotten food- always have to repeat order multiple times- have to always check for sauces and ask for he third time.

Not just once or twice, but every single time.


It's just a pathetic representation of sonic.",oDzGIJ78utjfAoWFybZgOA,0,0,2,eMS0hGbmqeNFO4Csoc3BOQ
