1187,2011-07-13,1,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"Carnevino is definitely a meat-lovers joy - but maybe a little over-priced for what you get.

My boyfriend is a carnivore and steak-addict, to the point where his friends recommended he come here.

We started with the Beef Tasting Menu, and while the crudo was well done, my issue was so many places seem to do a raw Kobe appetizer. Something a little more creative (with same meat!) would have been lovely. I will say I really loved the beef-cheek ravioli - I stole my boyfriends because I felt my portion needed to have more in it. Personally, the wet and dry aged beef were good and ""beefy and meaty,"" but my preferences run towards melty and buttery type of steak. I preferred the dry aged to the wet...the wet aged just seemed a little bland in comparison. 

We veered off course a bit - my boyfriend wanted MORE meat and we ordered the dry-aged bone in Rib-Eye for 2. I didn't eat much as my boyfriend devoured it, but the meat was flavorful for sure...just not my style. Ending with the tasting menu desert, which I can't remember because it was so generic. I think creativity could have been a lot better.

Service was good and they helped us find wines to pair with our dinner well. Our server was so excited we wanted more steak - but maybe he just wanted the bigger tip resulting from the massive bill? The worst part of the meal was being seated in an area that looked out onto the casino/hotel walkway. I prefer people not staring at me or my meals when I eat. 

Lastly, the price. While the cuts of meat were good, I just don't feel the costs justified what was done in the meal. The creativity was lacking and maybe it's because it's such a meat-BASED restaurant...but I feel like it could have been more creative. 

If you liked dry-aged steak and big, bold Italian reds, this is the place for your. But I prefer my steak to melt like butter in my mouth and this isn't the place for it. I will tell you my boyfriend enjoyed it far more than I did. Otherwise, maybe try another, more diverse restaurant in the Palazzo/Venetian Restaurant row.",1cd1TjQEynOjhBT-3Qnsjg,4,1,3,0T4wp2BcFUJXPtMPhXLBOQ

The ambience was excellent (for the main side which we were on) Caprese was delcious, our tasting portion of the sausage orchiette was perfectly al dente, my osso bucco was very good and my girlfriends filet mignon was fantastic (even for medium-well). I think that since this is a Celebrity Chef restaurant inside of one of the top 3 hotels on the vegas strip, the prices could have been higher! Honestly! Yes it is all al a carte, but the sides are only $9 when they could be $12 like other steakhouses. The petite filet was about $10 less than it is at other steakhouses, i think its one of the best bargain celebrity upscale restaurants in vegas.",TuAuPTDZEldXkOt0a-n4Xg,0,0,5,RnPUQLgBK5ZsgPmA39FdDw
10003,2009-04-26,0,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"This was my second visit to Carnevino. My first, right after they opened, was my best dinner experience in 2008. I have to say that this last trip left a little to be desired. Some of the dishes, especially the pasta were amazing. The orchiette pasta with sausage and broccoli rabe and the black ink pasta with crab meat and jalape√±o were fantastic. The prosciutto wrapped cheese puffs, which melted in your mouth the last time I visited were served luke warm and was very disappointing. The steak of course was very flavorful ~ and one serving for two was more than enough for four of us to share. 

The biggest disappointment and the reason why they are only getting three start for this trip was the service. It took us about 1/2 an hour to get a bottle of wine... and the service for the remainder of the meal was mediocre.

I would try Carnevino again, but I would try it for lunch, sit at the bar, and only order cocktails and pasta....",uDgy4OGBVKef-_DLYceolQ,0,0,3,-_RzTknPAYSuPvuWVd9F1w

We both had filet which was cooked to perfection order the medium if you like it medium rare. Service was very attentive and they were knowledgeable about the food. One downfall was the music. Strange hodge podge of 90s pop and rock. Decor was nice-rustic elegant but nothing crazy. Not sure how the Boulud Brasserie at the Venetian compares but if you're looking for classic steak this is probably one of your top choices.,0c7H0fkvezEaxlHag3KfJQ,2,1,4,ppApO8xmb53JOiLhn7OugA
20546,2014-06-19,0,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"I almost never leave reviews, but feel compelled to do so here in order to communicate just how impressed I was with the professionalism of the Carnevino staff yesterday evening.  My wife and I had tried to dine at another Strip restaurant, but left after the hostess treated us rudely and with an extreme lack of class.  Even though we arrived at Carnevino at 11:05 p.m., well after the final dinner seating, the manager on duty graciously allowed us to sit in the main dining room, where one other group was still dining.  We have eaten at many other Batali restaurants, both here and in New York, and the food is almost always stellar.  This meal was no exception.  We started off with two sides -- mushrooms and fregola/corn -- as appetizers.  Both were healthy portions (close to family style in size), and both were well executed.  For mains, we shared the (1) spago pasta with lamb ragu and (2) tagliatelle with vegetable ragu.  As to the latter, the ragu typically accompanies the gnocchi, but the chef agreed to accommodate my request to sub in tagliatelle.  At the ""other restaurant"" (which shall remain nameless), we had been instructed to order quickly because it was late and the kitchen wanted to close (even though the dining room was still full of people ordering food).  At Carnevino, by contrast, they attended to us as if we were VIPs, despite the late hour.  All in all, the food was great once again.  But on this night, it was the superb service that salvaged what otherwise would have been a horrible night.",Ulgm73gU9ypdgkdDPQoVzA,0,0,5,wxljLpr9Vd41IiI-NBJlTw
21226,2010-11-21,0,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"I came here recently for a business dinner. The service is phenomenal. Knowledgable about everything on the menu, including the individual farms all the produce came from. When served, it was perfectly choreographed so everyone at the table received their food at the same time.

Ok on to the food. I started with the caprese salad which was the best I've ever had. The mozzarella just melted in my mouth. The starter bread was fantastic, crusty on the outside but soft and warm on the inside. It came with a soft butter and I thought whipped olive oil, which turned out to be lardo (lard or back fat) - which tastes good but this non meat eater had to put it down. The roast chicken was good, not outstanding but good. Mashed potatoes were ok but the mushrooms were delish. Others at my table got the filet mignon with shaved truffles an they all said it was the best steak they've ever had. 

Dessert was a trio of sorbet, again good but nothing special. 

Overall the experience was fantastic and decor was romantic. The food was good but a bit inconsistent. I would go again just for the service and to try the pasta, which I was admiring on another table. It's a bit expensive for what you get.",zj2xftUYPhMCJcNrPO3frg,1,0,4,GKCbql3yNcAu1hudKUd21w

I have had those. But try one dry aged for 9 months. Yes 9 months. Unbelievable.  Not to mention the truffle pasta and even the kale salad was something special.

33994,2013-11-15,0,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"Carnevino is the best Steakhouse in Vegas, probably in the world!! Lol. Seriously though this is the only restaurant in the world dry aging their steaks anywhere from 2-11 months, besides the one in Hong Kong. It is literally something you can't get anywhere else in America. And it's worth every penny!!  I live in Hawaii and have dined here the last two times I visited Vegas and will probably keep going back. First off I would like to address (or rant,sorry) a few things about this place and to help you figure out if Carnevino is the place for you!!  
  First, Just like any other steakhouse in Vegas Carnevino is not cheap.  I won't say how much I spent here but you can go to their website and see the prices and see if  it's in your price range. This literally takes a few minutes to help you know what you are getting yourself into. I will point out that the prices listed for pastas are for smaller portions and that appetizers can usually be shared between 2-3 people. Steaks have a high price point because of the exclusivity of the steak of course and also because a lot of product is lost during the dry aging process, but this is necessary to get that great dry aginess(?). Which brings me to my next point. 
  Please know what dry aged steak is!! I am no expert on this and I know you don't want me to cut and paste a Wikipedia article on here, so I'll assume you'll be able to look it up if you don't know what it is. This also literally takes a few minutes. Dry aged steaks are not for everyone. It is completely different from steaks you will get at a store or even a steakhouse chain such as Morton's or Ruth's Chris, not that these aren't good steakhouses just that they don't dry age their steaks. When I see reviews saying that it taste like cheap supermarket steak or that they can cook a steak better I just shake my head. If you can cook a steak better why go to a steakhouse?! How do you cook something that you cannot possibly find at a supermarket!? From my experience Carnevino's steak is like no other. 
  Third, if tenderness is what you're looking for I suggest finding a place with a Wagyu selection such as Cut or Craftsteak. To me personally, steaks aren't worth paying a huge price for unless they are dry aged. At Craftsteak I payed around $200 a person for the American Wagyu tasting menu which was in my opinion just regular tasting steaks.   Everything else Tom Colicchio sent out though was amazing. On a side note, if you YouTube Craftsteak it will show you how they butter poach their steaks and if you cook one and compare it it tastes exactly the same. I have not had the pleasure of dining at Cut but I hear great things. They do offer wet aged steaks which are typical steaks, dry aged steaks, American Wagyu, and even Japanese Wagyu steaks.  Might have to go here on my next visit. On another side note, did you know Wagyu steak is intended more for texture rather than a beefy steak taste.  The Japanese intend for Wagyu to melt in your mouth, just as a great piece of Toro does, not so much for a huge beef flavor. 
  These are just a few things to keep in mind when deciding if you are down to try Carnevino. Ask your server about the riserva, they should have it, order it, enjoy knowing that this is something enjoyed only two places in the world, and then thank me!! Hahha 
  P.S. Service was excellent when I ate here. The server brought out white truffles for us to ooh and ahh at. Don't know how busy it gets but I'm sure they will try to make your dinner special. But if you're high maintenance, complain, or tip bad do everyone a favor and just always stay home!!! Hahhahahha server humor!!",RW4Bbzn8vK_haIu3_VMDsQ,1,0,5,Ysp5cNSXBRH_IK6e8o0Gnw

38706,2009-06-11,1,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"A lot of mixed reviews on this one. Some 3s, Some 5s. I'll go with the middle option. Here's why:

Starting with the food: the complimentary parmesan balls that a few other yelpers have mentioned are delicious, and a nice small start to what ended up being a really great meal. Appetizers shared by the table included the Insalata Romana and a daily special which consisted of a baked bread topped with burrata and ramps. The special was quite tasty -- the ramps provided a very subtle complement to the burrata. The salad, on the other hand, comes with anchovies that overpowered everything else about the salad.

A friend and I split the Florentine Porterhouse which was delicious - very nice crusting on the outside and cooked to a excellent-looking medium rare on the inside. Really didn't think it could get any better until the friend, who had been previously and gotten the same cut, ordered the additional gorgonzola mascarpone (one of around six sauce options). Amazing. This definitely elevated the porterhouse a few steps and I now consider it the best steak I've ever had. The grilled spinach with hot peppers provided a nice spicy vegetable side which had just the right amount of kick without leaving you with an aftertaste that might otherwise interfere with the steak.

So why, with all that, am I giving Mario's steakhouse a four star review? A  few annoyances: first, the service was just average with a few missteps along the way; the biggest problem came when the steak florentine presentation came out. We had ordered medium rare and the steak was indeed medium rare. However, the line chef had written Medium on the ticket and our waiter announced what the chef had written. We caught this and let them know we definitely wanted the medium rare. They went and double checked, but in between they had to roll the whole presentation tray back in, pretty humorous but a bit odd. Next, the   atmosphere seemed off. From what I glanced quickly on my way out, they may have another (possibly main) dining room in the other half of the restaurant, but our party was placed in the other side of the split which was open-air to the casino. Now I love my hometown, and the Palazzo has a very good smoke filtration system, so it's not that bad, but I can't for the life of me figure out any reason you'd want the noises and scenery of the casino right there. It really seems like an odd and definitely annoying choice.

So because of all that, and the fact that they couldn't seem to do a $18 salad right. Four stars.",C1_AvND8ApbjfZlKbtbbEA,1,0,4,i-Fts3KpnmQWXpLL2kn_Fg

64842,2011-10-09,0,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"Ate here for the first time this past weekend with friends. Absolutely phenomenal experience. If you know food and love a great steak you will not be disappointed. The staff is amazing, very friendly and on point. Be sure to have a cocktail at the bar. Cooper was the bartender and he started the night perfect. The restaurant is very elegant and a perfect place to treat yourself, your spouse and your friends. The food was amazing from the bread with two options of spreads to the desserts. We started the meal with the octopus which is a definite must have, another is the ravioli stuffed with duck and covered in brown butter and truffles. These raviolis are off the chart. I am a huge foodie and this maybe one of the most amazing things I have tried. We had the ribeye for dinner which is carved table side. It is a monstrous piece of dry aged over-prime beef with exceptional seasoning. Be sure to order 1 temp over your normal taste and remember it is huge. We had the potatoes with pancetta and an egg, for a side. Some fantastic, but pricey, wine pairings. Their wine selection is second to none.  Desserts are fantastic. Overall this place is simply one of the finest restaurants I have ate at. I will definitely visit anytime I am in Vegas. There was 4 in our party and we spent $600 with food and wine.

78660,2016-05-26,0,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"We booked our reservation two months in advanced for May 22 @ 8:15pm. The d√©cor and atmosphere was good to begin with even though they seated us in the bar area. About half way through the meal a party of two couples came into the bar area waiting for their table. They got drinks and hovered over our table. They were loud and kept banging into our table. After getting hit twice we asked the sever if they could ask the other guests to move away from our table and give us a little space. We were told that they could not. We asked for the manager and he told us the same, that there was nothing that he could/would do. He explained that he did not want to disturb their experience, even though it was negatively impacting our experience. After spending $152.00 on one steak and a total bill of over $400.00 no one would expect management to be so chicken shit and snotty. This is rated as the #1 steak house in the country, and I have to say the management practice and service was the worse I have ever seen and been a part of. The food was good (not the best) but you pay for the atmosphere and experience of the restaurant. I would give this restaurant a zero if I could based on dealing with the management. This was a special night for my wife and it is a shame that the poor management ruined the experience. Reservations are for the dining room, walk ups are for the bar area....maybe someone should explain this to management so they can insure that everyone has a good experience. Someone should research the date and time and fire the manager that was working that night.....Very very very very poor reflection on the establishment.",BRdK2Zzqz9q48YXjCqkMZg,0,0,1,Gb4gxfhhTCA8Ji3Kdn3n_w

This is a restaurant known for its steak in my party had the huge bone in ribeye. And steak was good and tender.

The thing to remember about this restaurant that it's known for their steaks but it's not a traditional steakhouse per se. 

This is an Italian steakhouse so basically everything has an Italian twist to it and the food is going to taste a little bit different. Not to say that's necessarily a bad thing but if you're like my husband, a steak and baked potato kind a guy, and really's classic sides then maybe this isn't the place for you. 

We had what I thought wad broccoli and I think it was something else and it was okay, it had some bacon or something like that in it. We ordered the mashed potatoes which had again some sort of bacon or pancetta in it and it does come with an egg on top of it. This didn't appeal to anyone in my party so I simply requested that the egg not be put on top. We did get complementary bread which was okay and it came with butter and lard, yes you heard me...lard. 

I will be honest, I'm up to try anything so I tried it and honestly I just didn't understand it. I can't even begin to understand why anybody would want to eat it Lol.

Our friend ordered a rib eye with a steak sauce,  mashed potato side with a poached egg on top; My husband and I shared a new York steak, dry aged beef tortellini and short rib ravioli. Our friend enjoyed the rib eye a lot. We also like the new York steak very much. We like that it is very tasty, soft, flavorful, and the beef is hormone free and antibiotic free!!! Awesome! The ravioli tasted very great as well. The pasta wasade in house. We were told that the bucatini and spaghetti were dry pasta, others are made in house, that's why we went for ravioli and tortellini. The tortellini tasted great as well but it was very small like an appetizer. 

At the end, we ended our meal with dessert. We had tiramisu and the gelato (strawberry, pistachio and chocolate). Again they were awesome. I like the tiramisu tasting very fresh and the ingredients were of good quality. It is way better than regular ones from american restaurants. The gelato were made in house as well (they said all desserts are made in house daily and fresh). The gelato is priced $12 and it is comprised of 3 scoops with your selected flavor. We like that the gelato is soft, smooth and tasted clean with real ingredients, no artificial flavor, coloring or thickening agent. It is really awesome.

Very pretty in presentation and we were excited to try them. Unfortunately, the same could not be said for my filet. I sliced into the steak expecting to see my medium rare selection and instead it was quite rare.  When I was able to get our waiters attention, he was very nice about it and offered to have it cooked to my desired preference.  When the steak came back, it was a bit dry and overall very disappointing. Additionally, based on the refiring time, my family was already done with their meal when I started.

The wife doesn't eat much red meat so she opted for pasta with seafood.  It was awesome!  The pasta was freshly made and you can really tell the difference.

Their bottle wine list is extremely expensive with a huge range of bottle prices, but they also have a great selection of wines by the glass and waiters who are more than capable of suggesting a glass to complement your dinner. The beef cheek ravioli isn't on the menu, but was phenomenal! We finished our meal off with the chocolate peanut butter torte and coconut cheesecake to share...so delicious!

Our waiter was knowledgeable of the menu, made an excellent wine pairing suggestion, and overall provided good service. We did wait for his attention before we placed our order, but never lacked for bread or beverage refills. 

Our shared appetizer (prosciutto), entrees (we both had fillet without extra toppings or sauces), and sides (spinach and potatoes) were heavenly. The fillets were cooked exactly as ordered, tender, and flavorful. 

We skipped dessert in favor of a digestive (Grappa), which the waiter split between us, without our needing to ask for a second glass.

The Grilled Octopus was excellent, but unfortunately that was the only item we truly enjoyed. The ""day aged"" Bone-in Ribeye for 2 was undercooked, with the fat not even rendered during cooking, lacking flavor and undersized at $76 per person. Although the Caprese Salad had an appealing appearance, it was difficult to eat, since the cherry tomatoes had been lightly stewed and were served on-the- vine (also without much flavor). 

We were also surprised when the table next to ours interrupted our dinner to retrieve their cell phone charger that was plugged in next to our table. Needless to say, we would not recommend Carnevino to anyone.",BPm_UQF6U7I--g1ofnHcTw,2,1,1,7CkUNtT03cGyeDX6afQREA

107553,2014-09-08,0,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"I didn't have reservations, so I scoured the Palazzo's site for a dinner house, and stumbled on CarneVino. It's Mario Batali's place, aside from B & B, so I figured hurray! Maybe it will be like Pizzeria Mozza. NOPE. It was more like Osteria Mozza, but meatier, and sticker shock. Now, we're staying at the Palazzo and had Joel Robuchon reservations, so prize isn't an issue. When you're expecting it. I'll pay $10 for ice cream when I know it's $10 ice cream. 

Mr. V was also not in a terrific mood - mostly due to not being able to hear the waiter well with his heavy accent and low voice, so when he didn't understand the way that the per person for two prices were laid out, his cage was rattled - so the meal wasn't as pleasant as I had wished. 

I ordered a house glass of white wine because CarneVino is a place where bottles are ordered, and Mr. V doesn't drink wine. I ordered the prosciutto with melon slices, which was absolutely wonderful. The prosciutto was so delicately sliced and just the right amount of salty. The melon slices were soft and juicy, not overly sweet/ripe, and made a nice after bite when I was done with the prosciutto. I didn't role them much, just enjoyed the pink slices with my fingers and glass of wine.

Now, having been to Batali's two Mozzas in LA, I've had his egg ravioli, his ragus, his octopus, his cheeses, and I'm not going to eat a porterhouse steak by myself. All their steak offerings were just too large for me. So I went with his seafood stew, which was very similar to cioppino. If anything, that's what it was without being called that. It was spicier than I'd anticipated, so it actually upset my stomach. That's not the stew's fault, but my own for not eating much throughout the day that wasn't done through a straw. The head-on shrimp (two in two days!) was the best part of it though. No matter the upsetness of my belly, I was not letting that guy leave my table uneaten. It was good overall, but would've liked less spicy. Or been told it would be spicy. 

Mr. V ordered the 20oz pork loin, bone-in. Now, pork is strange in the way that you want it fully cooked, but not...well done, so to speak. So there's a delicate balance between juicy and tough with the white meats. Mr. V immediately said ""chef's preference"", but the waiter hung back and said that maybe it was a little pink. Pink on pork is not really that appetizing, so Mr. V said medium, and the waiter bowed his head and left. Well, bad idea. Because the pork was tough - and this was AFTER Mr. V had given his okay to however it should be cooked! I was actually astonished, and almost wanted to send it back FOR him. But the charred edges with caramelized butter were so, so good. He ate the entire thing, so it wasn't so bad. But definitely not what I would've expected, especially AFTER the waiter had advised against Mr. V's wishes. 

The restaurant was okay - and as usual, I'd like to give places more than one chance because every place/couple have a bad night. Mr. V was not happy though, and I can definitely understand why.",vlKVmCHhTY5J-I8e2hB7qg,3,0,3,jCRKEA_tW14bssAI4tzUGw
115118,2012-03-17,0,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"Now this is an exercise in restaurant grandeur, and Mario Batali and his wait staff here do not disappoint.  Walking by the restaurant in the Palazzo, you do not get the sense of impressiveness; it just looks like a little restaurant tucked away near the entrance of the casino.  However once the maitre'd starts walking you to your table in the main dining room....the experience begins.  I was belittled by the tall ceilings, soaring arches, artwork and the feeling of old Italia.  Even better is that the restaurant goes on forever, and you'll know what I'm talking about when you go to the restroom (private dining room after private dining room flanked by rustic wooden cabinets filled with bottles and bottles of wine as far as the eye can see.  Yeah, this is how they do it here, and it is no joke.  

Let me state that I researched all the top Vegas restaurants before deciding to eat here, and so glad we did.  At Carnevino you're going to get the best of the best quality ingredients, and classic dishes prepared expertly.  I had the pre-theatre menu, going with the Tagliata di manzo (arugula salad topped with slices of Parmigianino and beef Carpaccio), the filet mignon (medium rare), and the gelati.  We also added in two pasta dishes we wanted to try, beef cheek ravioli and black truffle linguini .... and both were so amazing; pasta perfectly tender and flavors beyond comprehensible.  I would highly recommend trying the pasta -- portions are small so you could easily split one or two.  It just doesn't get any better than the filet at Carnevino.  Expertly prepared, it is as good as it gets.  The great part about the pre-theatre menu is that you get the same steak on the full menu for a fraction of the price.  The wine list is also beyond.  Had the Las Rocas Tempranillo to start, and then went with a full-bodied Italian for the steak.  

Now for the service... In a word, top notch.  Our waiter was the most articulate and knowledgeable of ingredients, food, preparation I can remember.  He actually got us excited about the history of food...now that is a good waiter. 

In sum...Carnevino is an experience...so come planning to spend a lot of time having your meal.  My one regret is that we were on our way to a show so couldn't linger for longer. I've been to several of Batali's restaurants...Del Posto, Babbo, Lupa, and Carnevino is my favorite so far.  Don't miss this place.",Tj58A0_D-WsD-UirmpYSEQ,2,1,5,_zo50Hh8GEQyHBv723jLkQ

Our debit card had been suspended due to a shopping trip I had taken earlier to La Perla (oops) so S was on the phone trying to tell Bank of America that we were in fact in Las Vegas while I waited for him at the restaurant's entrance (they wouldn't seat us until we were both there). This wasn't a big deal because they offered prosciutto wrapped bread sticks which were delicious. When seated S remarked that there were only 4-tops in the restaurant which was fabulous for a party of two - you could stretch out while feeling cozy at the same time. The restaurant's atmosphere echo's its steakhouse vibe and I was surprised at how gigantic the restaurant really is. We were seated in the front room and only realized on a trip to the restroom that the place goes back quite far. Upon sitting down, we were brought our immense menus and if I thought NOBU's menu was confusing I was in for quite a time with this one. This menu isn't confusing so much as immense. It's physically quite large and our waiter explained that typical of Italian dining you order an antipasti, a pasta and then a meat course. We dove right it. To start, I had the Big Eye Tuna Crudo and S had the Dry Aged Beef Carpaccio on Arugula and both were delicious. For our pasta course, I ordered the Ricotta and Egg Raviolo while S had the ""Spago"" with lamb ragu. My plate was insane. One lone raviolo sat in a pool of brown butter and when you cut into it the egg underneath ran out and the cheese mixed with it and made just utter fabulous-ness all around. Finally, the meat. Up to this point we were impressed but given that this was a steak house, we were holding back all judgment until our final course. I ordered the Lamb Chops ""Scottadita"" with a cumin scented yogurt sauce and S had the Bone In New York Strip. We were blown away. S said that his steak was amazing - with a nice char on the outside while the inside was perfectly pink. My lamb chops were delicious and had that gamey flavor that comes with good lamb. What struck us the most was that while this was a high end dining establishment, there was also a certain amount of casualness that made it comfortable. In this beautiful and dim dining room they were blasting the Rolling Stones. The sommelier was really approachable and  became like a good friend when he realized our interest in wine which was a nice touch as he recommended some great ones (which I sadly can't remember now). The wine list is incredible so if you like Italian wines, go crazy. Essentially, CarneVino felt like Mario Batalli was in the kitchen cooking your dinner. No detail was overlooked and everything was incredible. I wish he'd open a restaurant in the Bay Area because that man knows Italian food.",aEZ8CSdSUfh2jRUh_Y7BCw,0,0,4,201ondwrXe9V2obdSCW4bw

1) We were celebrating a birthday, and one friend could not make it. He did surprise us by getting us a bottle of wine with an accompanying note. I really appreciated that the restaurant accommodated this; however, the person who brought the wine and read the note did so while one of our party was in the restroom, and it just happened to be the birthday boy. No excuse for not waiting until our entire party was there to bring that over.

2) The pacing was not consistent. After we were seated and with drinks, we ordered appetizers. They brought out the bread (use the lardo); shortly after that, the appetizers. Then the pasta course. Maybe 10-15 minutes between each. Then about a half hour wait for our entrees (brought by runners) and then a half hour at least until we got the check. After they brought the pasta course, our server was no where to be seen for about an hour, and no one asked it we wanted another round of drinks, bottle of wine, etc. before or during our entrees.

Don't get me wrong, this is a phenomenal restaurant and the food is fantastic, but at a place like this with the prices we paid I expect near perfection, and this time there were a few glitches that prevented me from rating this 5 stars.

143349,2009-11-23,0,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"Mario Batali has in my opinion the best steak place in LV. Plan on spending $200 for steak a couple of sides and desert and coffee..which is exactly what our tab came to... you'll pay much more if you get wine.  The service here is excellent. the timing is right on.. Yes they may push the appetizers since it does take 25 or 30 minutes (which they warn you)  to cook the steaks... but don't do the appetizers if you are a real steak lover. I went here with my wife for the steak, steak only. Carnivores rejoice! When I go to steak restaurants I don't want to fill up on bread and appetizers or salads... I just want steak. There Chiabatta bread though I must say was one of the best I've tasted... yeah well okay I had to wait 30 minutes so I had to eat something....But it was worth the wait.. Well Mario, buddy, you brought out the most delicious succulent ""Fred Flintstone"" like steak with this huge bone on it that they carve in front of you.

145462,2010-01-21,0,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"After dining out at many of Batali's restaurants with my BF (B&B last time in Vegas, Babbo, Lupa, Mozza, and San Marco the night before), I was hoping that Carnevino would be top notch as well.  

A quick glance at the menu revealed the main event: a bone-in ribeye for 2.  What we didn't notice, was the details on the pricing.  Instead of the eye-popping $130 that surprised us on the check, the menu lists it as a reasonable $65 then in a lighter font, (per person).  

We ordered that a few drinks and pancetta bruxells sprouts.  The ribeye came out, and it turned out to be mostly bone, and less eye.  It was carved and we each got about 4 2-bite pieces.  While not as good as Hyde Park (nor as good as the Babbo version), it was quite tasty with good char and still quite rare inside.  The bruxells sprouts were good, but had way too much mustard which overwhelmed the sprouts and pancetta.  

We were still hungry and tried to carve whatever meat remained from the bone, then asked for the check.   That's when we got the full pricing on the ribeye and were like WTF!  Our waiter (who was nice), fetched the manager.  She explained that the pricing was quite clear on the menu, that its a 30 oz ribeye (more like 8oz when you don't consider the bone, unlike most bone-in ribeyes that have a moderate ratio of meat:bone) and they are very proud of their product and their pricing, and I said its still deceptive pricing to list the number as $65 while all the 1-person steaks are listed below similarly, and that even Babbo doesn't charge that much for their ribeye, further, the edible portion was tiny and might be worth the $65 but certainly not $130 EVER.  She grudgingly offered to take off our $25 in drinks.  

After we left, and today, I have some new data points that are useful.  Babbo's ribeye for two is indeed $70 and comes with roasted potatoes (and is significantly larger and better than this one was). Today, looking at the yelp info on Carnevino, I come across a picture of the menu that shows the old menu, and in that picture the price is indeed $135 for the ribeye, but it is actually listed  on the menu as such.  Presumably, they changed it to deceive and sucker in more people.  

As such, I think I may just have to dispute the charge with Amex, and furthermore, if that is the way they do business, I am going to give a very hard look at ever going back to a Batali establishment.",P0Y8s69QlWPKAdpe743kQw,0,0,2,Hwjwj_TPUOhDensux6lejg

149335,2011-03-19,0,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"Overall the place deserves every bit of a 5 star rating. Unlike other reviews that concentrate on the greatness of the meat, I would like to concentrate on how amazing the italian oriented plates were. We started with the insalata caprese which had an amazing balance between the candied tomatoes, burrata, and basil. We continued with black fettucine with crab, jalapenos, and shallots and a bucatini all amatriciana. Both dishes were out of this world! I thought that pasta is one of the most straightforward dishes, however it can get exceptional with a little bit of creativity. Mario Batali as a true italian knows the tradition of the italian cuisine but also it's modern interpretation as well. Finally, we had a fillet mignon and osso bucco with saffron orzo and gremolata. The osso bucco was exceptional! I felt like it was home made by my mother (i happen to be greek, greece as well as italy have the so called mediterranean cuisine)! The fillet mignon was perfectly cooked but to be perfectly honest i felt that something was missing (seasoning perhaps). It tasted great, dont get me wrong but on a such high end restaurant i was expecting it to be mind blowing. Finally we had a panacota dessert which was AMAZING. Great textured panacota accompanied with a great pear sorbet. True italian flavor and congratulations to Mario Batali for such a high end cuisine. 
Now the three drawbacks in my opinion that could possibly make me take a star of my rating. First of all, the prices of the wine list are RIDICULOUS. You can get many of these wines with 1/3 of the value that the restaurant was charging. Secondly, the lady that was on the reception was rude which is totally contradictory with such a high standard restaurant. Third, i feel that some of the dishes are a little bit overpriced. Mostly the steaks, that is something quite standard and not really italian or creative or whatever. 
Overall, i would recommend this restaurant to everybody that likes good food and wants to have a real italian flavor in the area of las vegas. Since there are people here that are rating pizza places and sports bars with 5 stars i ll stick with my 5 star rating in order to show my satisfaction of a truly nice dining experience.",1mede_tNNAs6yUfDglDCRg,0,0,5,AvtTcNLP9NL8DcB7dZKc9w

164591,2014-05-16,7,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"Ate here last night, 14/5/2014. I'm not sure how this place has as many 5-star reviews that it has. I can't help but wonder where these reviewers are accustomed to eating.  It worries me. 

Atmosphere:  its nice. 

Design: odd. We waited in the bar area for our group to arrive. Once accounted for we were escorted to our table...across the casino floor to a large room. Why?  How? We weren't part of the restaurant; we were literally in a room across from it. Talk about disjointed.  

Food:  be advised this place has their own doneness meter for steak. Medium in your head (and elsewhere), is NOT the same here. Your server actually converts your request one level down. For example, medium is converted to mid-rare; well converts to med-well. Makes no sense why this is done & no explanation was given.  

I ordered the Filet med-well which converted to medium. Based upon the servers description of pinkness...my steak was overcooked. It arrived standing upright, like a funnel. The outside was crispy & a bit tough. They don't age their filets like their other cuts (or like any other steakhouse).  Our server specifically said filets were not dry aged because they didn't age right that way; they are wet aged. I don't know the difference in aging but again, the outside was tough, the inside really pink & bloody.  My coworker had the New York Strip & he wasn't impressed either (and his was aged properly). We each had a lobster tail. It arrived without the shell, which is fine, but it was so over cooked you wouldn't know it. It was charred, tough, not tender, not flavorful. No butter warmer to be had. Disappointing. 

Sides: tuscan fries, mashed potatoes, asparagus. Fries were baby potatoes cut lengthwise. Asparagus was overcooked, shriveled, and black. Potatoes were served with a fried runny egg on top the server mixed into the mash. No one ate the mashers. It was disgusting. 

Appetizers:  grilled octopus. Hard, rubbery, no flavor. Insalata caprese, beef cheek ravioli, beef tartare. Gross, all 3 of them. 

Deserts: i had the chocolate caramel torte. FINALLY something edible. 

I've eaten at many steakhouses across the U.S. & Vegas.  One of my defense firms took us here for dinner. I won't go back on their dime...or my own. The menu wasn't great, nor were side selections. Portions were smaller than expected, even for a la carte. 

In Vegas, I prefer Hanks at Green Valley Ranch.  Everything is better there. And you're sat in the actual restaurant, not in a room across from it.",9BuTUHt6Zlm-UCjaGD6aJQ,3,2,2,iYcrbrA72UYVsnUjFdosGw
166104,2010-01-12,2,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"We came for the pre-theatre set dinner ($49 each).  My boyfriend wanted to order off the a la carte menu but for whatever reason the 'rule' is that if someone orders the pre-theatre set menu that all parties must order off the set menu too - ditto for ordering a la carte.  
We had...
Apps
- beef carpaccio w/lardo topped bread- melt in your mouth beef and the bread was great for that crunchy compliment to it
- fried calamari over marinara sauce & peppers - the calamari was well cooked so it wasn't chewy.  The sauce goes get pretty spicy as you continue to eat. Overall it wasn't anything that I haven't had elsewhere - a pretty typical fried calamari app.

We ordered another proscuitto appetizer as well.  The proscuitto was delicious, probably one of the best proscuitto servings I've had. It was served with seasonal fruit that turned out to be a very small portion of pear. The sweetness of the pear went well with the proscuitto.

Main:
- chicken alla cacciatora - delicious, though some parts wasn't cooked through
- filet mignon - super tender, though the plating lacked quite a bit. It was literally just the filet on a large white plate, which was disappointing and surprising. It is that hard to at least put some greens on the plate?
 
Dessert
- date steamed cake - it got a bit too sweet once you get half way through, I didn't finish it. 
- sorbetti - chef's selection: apple, pear & pomegranate.",qt1b6zXExL-uoJGRRouQYw,2,2,3,4okuvDR-8B2PUA5ZDPPnZw

3 of us went there last night for a light dinner... here we go!

1 specialty cocktail $14, 1 Old Fashion $18 (really?)

Big Eye Tuna Crudo - great fish, but the sauce was all high notes with no balance... fail.

Beef Cheek Ravioli w/ 25 yr. old balsamic ($31) smallish portion, good taste, but the consistency of the filling was like baby food... fail.

We wanted to order the ""80 day"" (doubt it) dry aged strip steak ($70) but the waiter suggested the bone-in rib eye steak for one (he didn't mention that it was $25 more.  The steak was smallish and carved table side by a disinterested woman with her hand behind her back... never smiled or said hello. I've had much better steaks everywhere for half the price... fail.

The smallish side of Italian Broccoli w/ Pork was totally forgettable... fail.

I drink my coffee black w/ no sugar... I had to send it back as the beans had been burned more than Starbucks... fail.

My brother ordered a double espresso on ice with half and half... they brought heavy cream, then claimed not to have half and half... he had to ask for milk to make his own... fail.

My wife enjoyed her cappuccino.

We also had a small fruit plate... meh.

The bill? $235 plus tip.

My wife and I got home 2 hours later and were starved... we will not be back.

This is the second Mario restaurant we have gone to... the other one being his pizza joint in L.A. which was horrible.... no more Mario for us... maybe he should spend less time on TV and more time training his staff.",oIXYObVqeyc-ECd4lJAZWQ,4,0,2,ilfe-2Vep6mI6B8XZ6qMHQ

The Mario Batali cookbooks on display at the bar caught my eye, and being a big fan I dragged my parents into see what the stuff I'd tried to cook was actually supposed to taste like. From the name of the restaurant I deduced that not ordering meat was probably a bad idea. After the ""lardo"" spread (delicious) and the beef tartare (so-so) I had the ossobuco while my parents inexplicably ordered pasta. My food really was great- good heavy Italian food. The veal was falling off the bone and the risotto was al dente. As far as a beef, veal, and lamb, you probably can't go wrong at this place.

For mains, a number of us shared with a partner or in a group of three. I was very fortunate to share a fiorentina steak with my friend. I will say it was meat overload but it was a great cut of meat and the drizzled olive oil was a great addition. I've had a fiorentina steak before in florence (its place of origin), and I have to say that this one lived up to the billing. The other groups at our table also enjoyed their meals but there was a ton of meat left over. Beware that the shared entrees have a lot of food. In particular the lamb dish was a lot larger than expected and could easily be shared among 3 people. But everything was delicious.

coming to an ""italian steakhouse"" it was difficult to decide on pasta or steak. so my friend and i ordered two smaller portions of the pastas as appetizers which were just big enough for a few bites each, and i found it to be a perfect amount.  we had the black fettuccine which she loved, and the pappardelle which i loved, the pasta being a perfect al dente.  despite other reviews, i didn't find the black fettuccine fishy, nor did it have anything 'hard' in it so if you experienced that, you definitely should have turned it back.

i had the 8 oz filet done medium which i found to be perfectly done.  slightly charred on the outside (i hate it when it's overcharred and i have to basically scrape it off and eat only the inside of the steak) and warm pink in the middle and it did not bleed when i cut into it.  (i hate having blood run on my plate when eating steaks!)  the meat was tender, and i didn't have any sauces because you shouldn't need sauce on a really good piece of meat!  

i will probably go back.  it's pricey, but it's vegas and it's a celebrity chef restaurant.  kinda comes with the territory!",9l5JWRM3NGc5GlGtRt0UxQ,1,1,3,dzFAViEnZ2fQgLMlhEOS0Q

We didn't make reservations, it was a last minute decision to dine here, I love Mario Batali - the food had to be delicious!  We were seat in less than 15 minutes in the private library .  Our waitress was fabulous, I don't recall her name, but she brought us a second round of the complimentary Parmesan/Pecorino/Gorgonzola cheese balls, upon my request of course. 

Lardo with warm focaccia rosemary bread. Lardo is pork lard mixed with rosemary, it has a smooth silky consistency that I enjoyed very much with the focaccia.   

We skipped appetizers and went straight to the Rib Eye for dinner The meat was grilled  to perfection - medium just how I like it, but I must say it  was a very intimidating cut of meat, it was enormous!  Perfect for two.  The meat was carved right next to us, it was top with salt, Fleur de sel maybe? and topped with extra virgin oil olive, which I loved very much.  

The sides we order were Asparagus wrapped in prosciutto breaded and fried, potato wedges topped with herbs and Parmesan cheese, and mash potatoes with bacon chucks and chives topped with a raw egg.  By far the best mash potatoes I've ever had, the egg gave the potatoes extra creaminess and flavor, it just dissolved in my mouth.  

For dessert we had rhubarb tart topped with strawberry gelato and chocolate cheese cake.  I took a taste of both, it was good, but I couldn't enjoy it much, I totally overfed myself.  

After we got the bill, our waitress ended our dinner with an Italian nougat  not sure what it was called, but it was delicious, it had the perfect sweetness.",iIhDrDVp_tZnSn3XMNLQ2Q,0,0,5,f8SOcGjRw6dj0UM8FHkulw

My wife's pasta was undercooked but otherwise had good flavor, the ANOLINI was just bland and the portion just to small as an entre, the Broccoli was over cooked to the point that you could not cut it with the knife provided, and was tasteless.

We had a $700+ dinner for 4 that was inedible in every way. And on top of the lousy food the service was even worse. Now that's a real accomplishment. 

We sat down, ordered some cocktails and two stunning wines. The cocktails took about 20 minutes to be delivered without explanation or apology in a half empty restaurant. On top of that our friends knew Mario Batali personally from New York which was known by the waiter. Do you think we might have some personal service knowing that fact? Certainly not!! 

The food was ghastly!! The salads were drenched with dressing. The side dishes were exhausted from sitting in warming ovens. The fingerling potatoes were stale, dried out and tasted like cardboard. The Veal Picatta was dry, limp, oily and has not a hint of lemon. My charred rare Bone-in New York steak was charred as I ordered but lifeless and devoid of flavor. 

After dinner we ordered another round of cocktails that we had to re-order 20 minutes later. 

We had researched for the best steakhouse in LV extensively and this was the most highly rated by more reviewers. It was a huge mistake!

Definitely, not worth the the cost.  Dishes are creative, and look appetizing, but the execution is flawed.

Our last experience was definitely our worst.  We were greeted and asked about any food allergies, which my wife has a gluten allergy.  This was very nice to hear.  We sat down and our waiter asked who has the gluten allergy and assured us that they strive to provide meals for everyone with any food allergies.  Awesome.  We order drinks, appetizers, and dinner.  So far so good.  The assistant manager stopped by and introduced himself.  Thanked us for coming and reassured my wife that the kitchen staff was well acquainted with the various dishes that they make that are gluten free.  Again awesome.

Our meals arrive, and this is where things go bad.  My wife ordered the Tuscan seafood stew.  To our surprise to large pieces of bread where placed in her stew.  (Mind you three people recognized her allergies, including a manager).  I immediately spoke up and our server was very apologetic and took it away to have another made.  This is where it gets worse.  He sets the bowl down and I can see bread crumbs still in the stew.  Unfortunately, for my wife, her allergy is not a dietary fad, it is severe stomach ache and couple times a hospital visit.  He assured us it was remade and not simply just removed the bread ( this is with bread crumbs still visible).  

We sent her meal back again and she would not eat after that.  When the bill came her meal was still on it and we had to complain to the manager, who was apologetic of the situation, but was a bit reluctant to remove the cost of her meal.

Our friend's pasta came out with a hair in it so she sent it back.  We waited a while to get a fresh plate out.  In the meantime, we asked several times for new silverware and no one could seem to be bothered to bring us new silverware so we got up and got it ourselves from their cabinet.

The highlight of the dinner was the fillet mignon which was aged to perfection, delicately seasoned and cooked to perfect temperature. This was served alone on a simple clean white plate. No sauce, but none was necessary.  The steak is clearly the standout at this restaurant, and it is in the top two steaks I've ever eaten.  

The other standout of this restaurant is a bit more unfortunate --  and it has nothing to do with the food, it has to do with the ambience.  The music selection is discordant and unsettling. During our meal we were subjected to an entire nirvana unplugged new york album, followed by another entire album from ""The Black Keys"" .  I like a few songs from both of these albums, but don't really want to listen to all of the ""B"" tracks, and probably none of it during an elegant dinner. 

With appropriate music this place would earn a 5 star rating.  The wait staff said the selection was on purpose as a theme from executive chef Mario Batali.  

Mario, if you read your reviews: please let someone else pick the music!",xf-WNELch3paRHjpr3kfvA,0,0,4,c-2sCpMaKCl4WEqgRNy7aA

347211,2014-12-31,1,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"(Our group's reservation was made a comfortable two days before our visit) 
The evening was already soured when our hostess rudely broke her centimeter-thick temper. Our group of five asked to be seated in the main restaurant, and not the small, triangle room completely separated and across the hotel hallway. The hostess then told us that they only have two tables in the entire restaurant that can accommodate 5 people. We were then seated in ""the wine cellar"" beneath the hotel escalators. First encounter with a restaurant should not be a poor mannered hostess. Ambience was off putting as music choice was loud and inappropriate for an Italian steakhouse that only offers very few bottles of red wine under $200. 

However-

Our waiter and sommelier were very kind and very knowledgable of the menu and wine list. Major props to them- when asked about wine pairings for a crab and white truffle sformato, they were able to offer great, educated choices (we ended up pairing the dish with a heavy Chardonnay which, though wildly overpriced, worked well). Other notes on the food:

(Everything was overpriced- so I won't mention it in every description)

Porterhouse Steak (MR): not sure what happened here, the cut more resembled venison as it tasted unusually gamy. 

Filet Mignon (MR): my order- very tasty, great portion, well cooked, and cut like butter. 


Beet Carpaccio: lots of flavors, fun presentation, very light, very small portion. 

Pastas: we ordered two pastas which were both relatively underwhelming, though very fresh- mostly poor meal pairing on our part I suppose?

Desserts: light and tasty, no flavor complaints.

In general- everything was very harsh on the palate, which made building our meal in three-course form, as the restaurant suggested, difficult. There were some pleasant notes in the evening, but overall we were underwhelmed and unimpressed.",hTllhFLL_M6QwLbg2aD03w,5,1,2,6Ec8Pbqhi7OxCCuB2Ck8FQ

360810,2008-08-26,0,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"Unlike some of the reviewers, I found the ambience of the restaurant enjoyable and relaxing.  I think that perhaps the disparity between reviewers loving or hating the ambience comes down to which side of the restaurant you are seated in.   The retaurant is split in two, bookends to an escalator to the skywalk to the Wynn resort.  There appears to be a pathway behind the escalators to go between the sides.   The people who sit in the main area where the bar and entrance are located in is nice and relaxing whereas the other side of the restaurant seems more likely to get the casino noise.  The music in the restaurant is a little too loud as well.

The service we had was excellent.  I'd give a 5 star if a review was based on service alone.  

The food is where my star rating fell dramatically.   We started with fried calamari which was excellent.  Next course was two pastas - black fettucine (made with squid ink) with dungeness crab and a pasta with lamb ragu.  The black fettucine  was ok but a bit tastless although the pasta with lamb ragu was quite good.  

For entrees, the osso bucco was good but the veal saltimbocca was ridulously salty and inedible.    It was the equivilent of opening a salt shaker and pouring it into your mouth.    Veal Saltimbocca is one of my favorites italian dishes and I couldn't wait to taste Mario Batali's version.   This was a huge disappointment.

The wine list, which I was looking forward to ordering from, had hundreds of wines.  It's an extensive list however the prices were too high.  We decided to forego the wine and go for cocktails instead.

405846,2012-11-17,0,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"They say good things don't last. Well my friends, sadly it's true. Carne Vino has sunk. Food is good (but not as good as it was in the past) and the service stinks. 

I can't tell you how disappointed I was on my last trip to Carne Vino in Vegas. This, from my favorite restaurant in Vegas for many, many years. 

A year ago my husband and I moved to London and have endured a hard year of very few good steaks and at prices that don't allow for many outings. So, on our trip to the US this year we were dying for red meat and had to make a trip to Carne Vino. Oh yes! That glorious gigantic Fred Flinstone sized rib-eye and NY. Mouthwatering goodness. Oh yessssss. And I LOVE the amazing pastas that are also served here. Combine the two and oh baby!! Bring it!!!!!

Knowing how busy the place gets, we made our reservation well in advance. Here is a summary of how they proceeded to let me down: 

(Mishap #1, + 60 min): However, upon arriving we had to wait well over an hour to be seated even with a reservation. We waited patiently knowing food bliss was awaiting us.

(Mishap #2, + 30 min): After being seated, we had to wait another 30 minutes before anyone came to take our drink order. This is shocking since the tables around us were empty. I have no idea what the waiter was busy doing, but it was clearly not his job.

(Mishap #3, + 30 min): And then another 30 min for someone to come to talk to us about the menu. The waiter was a real piece of work. He was really out of it, not paying attention to what we were asking and so different from the service we'd had in the past. 

(Disappointment): After finally getting something to drink and ordering, we all anxiously awaited our starters. The feeling that the night was not going to end well started to sink in when the starters arrived and were not as good as I remembered the dozen times I've been in the past. I shook this off and waited for the pastas which I knew would be heaven.

(Mishap #4): Instead of our pasta course arriving next , we got our main meat course. We flagged down our waiter (who was no where to be found for 10-15 min) and asked him what happened and he admitted he made a mistake and didn't put the starter course in for us. I'm not sure how he managed to mess up since we seemed to be his only table.

(Mishap #5) Shortly after this, half the pasta courses made it to the table along with the manger who proceeded to argue with us over excuses for their mess up instead of just admitting the mistake. I have NEVER seen a manager behave so childishly in a restaurant. And you'd think you'd get a some nice service at a place were you're spending +$250 per person for 8 people. The waiter scored big time with a fat service included tip although he did not deserve a dime of it. 

Bottom line is: I don't think this review really tells you how bad the service was. The service was horrible and the manager should be fired. But, I admit I still thought the food was good - although sadly not as good as we'd had in the past. 

We've had a few friends also go there since and they have also said they had horrible service and sub-par food. I don't know if I feel better knowing it was just not a fluke night. I really used to love this place.

I write this review broken hearted. I hope Mario reads this and goes and kicks the butt out of the management and staff with his orange croc shoes to get them to live up to the glory that this place once represented!",eiyWzIIJhbuoF7fYWb0zeQ,10,0,2,iY3BTBJCmqaQG4Ncl5D47w

415755,2011-10-10,0,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"The service here is subpar.

The ambiance is on par with Applebee's with nicer linens.

The price for any cut of meat is on par with any other steakhouse but the subpar service / ambiance make it overvalued.

In regards to service, I promptly showed up for m dinner reservation but was told to wait at the bar for 30 minutes while my table was cleared. I noticed that the table we were seated at was empty when I walked in. I understand waiting at the bar if I were late and if my table were busy. I do not want to be forced to visit the bar to spend more money.

The waiter was amateur in every aspect. He pushed drinks when we just sat down with drinks ordered from the bar. He broke from taking out order to attend to another table. He insisted on upselling any item we ordered from each category on the menu. He forgot parts of our order.

With 4 guys, we ordered 1 round of cocktails, 1 bottle of wine, 2 appetizers, 3"" of meat (2"" of rib eye @ $72 an inch, 1"" of private reserve porterhouse @ $108 an inch), 3 sides, 1 round of nightcaps, 2 desserts. Except for the nightcaps and desserts, we ordered everything else based on the fact that we knew how much we would eat and ordering any more would be wasteful. There's no reason to ask to add truffles for $75.

As per the ambiance, I would relate Carnevino to an Applebee's chain restaurant. I listened to track after track of Green Day and Sublime. As the night wore on, the music definitely got louder like were in some time of nightclub.

I was going to give rate this establishment 2 stars but compiling this list justifies a 1 star rating. I think it bets heavy on the draw the Batali name brings but falls flat with everything else. I should have known better when I was able to make a reservation for 4 @ 7:15 PM on a Saturday on OpenTable and noticed there were availabilities for every other time slot as well. Compare this to Delmonico's across the hallway which only had reservation seating at 5:00 PM and 9:30 PM.

439626,2012-10-12,0,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"Mario Batali's, Carnevino started out with lots of excitement on our part, but sadly it was an overpriced flop., you have the distinction of being my first YELP review, I have never been moved enough to bother writing a review. Sadly, the overpriced, lackluster fare at Carnevino made our trip to Vegas a bit of a sour experience and will remain with us for some time.

Located in The Palazzo, Carnevino semi-failed from the get-go. While it maintains the top-notch customer service and decadent, chic decor expected of a high-end Vegas establishment, the ambience was marred by the raucous sound of Beastie Boys blaring from the stereo system. I'm not necessarily opposed to them, but didn't jive well with the up-scale venue.  This is probably a great way not have people linger after their dinners so that they can turn their table over. What a disgrace, you come to what you believe is a fine dinning establishment and get treated like high school kids at 7-Eleven during lunch hour where they play loud music outside the store to keep the kids from hanging out. Truly gives new meaning to used cars sales even for Vegas!!

In keeping with the slimy used cars salesman approach, the menu was sneaky too. So, watch out! Case in point, the prices listed for the pastas range from $17-$31; however, these are for appetizer portions only. An additional $15 needs to be tacked on for the entree size, making them the most ridiculously priced pasta plates I have ever seen anywhere in the world including New York, LA, San Fran, Rome, Paris....you get the picture. Pasta is  to be Al dente but not crunchy Al dente!!!! Chef Batali you need to spend some time in restaurants you lend your name to!!

The Pi√®ce de r√©sistance, keeping the used cars salesman  was the steak for two, it  is listed as $72, but it's $72 PER PERSON, making it a whopping $144.  A steak legitimately worth that much wouldn't be for eating, as it should be plated in precious metals and embedded with Swarovski crystals. 

What a sham, but we ordered it anyway, and let me tell you it should be in the Swarovski crystals, because it certainly looked better than it tasted. No seasoning or flavor to it all, maybe some Sea salt at least would have helped, but nothing seemed to have been added as seasoning.

The appetizers were actually pretty good, and I'd recommend getting the SPAGHETTI AI FRUTTI DI MARE, other than the crunchy pasta (and I do mean crunchy not Al  Dente), the seafood and sauce were cooked very well save for one prawn that would have been great in a Ceviche or Sushi dish.
 For an establishment that boasts ""the highest-quality, excellently prepared steaks"" I was seriously expecting more than used cars salesman tactics and at best OK food. The prices and the venue promise top class fine dining establishment but it fails to deliver on all aspects of is required to establish this. The servers are at best a an upgrade on Outback Steakhouse and only because of how they dress,  when clearing items from table (you don't reach across, and lady's first). I know it seems petty but when you are selling top notch by what you are charging then that what will be expected. Not so at this establishment, and if this were Europe this restaurant would not last a year, because there restaurants don't survive merely on the owners name and clearly this one has no more to offer than that. 

.Needless to say, save yourself the aggravation and frustration and just stand outside and take a picture because the picture will certainly have better memories that the experience at Carnevino because just like the restaurant it's all about the glitz but substance. Avoid at all costs and if you are ther eon a conference get your party to spend their time more wisely somewhere where it more about the substance than the look of the establishment.

What a shame Mr. Batali, you have abused the peoples good will and taken advantage of the position the public has put you in, remember it doesn't last forever. There is absolutely no excuse for the price versus quality of service and food as well as the ambiance that is provided in the room by both the servers and the music selections. This type of sham is inexcusable in today's day and age, rest assured that my family and I will never again enter an establishment that you are associated with in any way. This has also taught be a valuable lesson that we should all take the time to not only review the bad but also the good, which I will be doing moving forward.

I totally would agree with that for the other Batoli restaurant, B&B, but Carnevino really is outstanding. Everything in Vegas is overpriced, but this one doesn't seem out of place, like Mix Las Vegas. For what you're getting, it seems solid. Carnevino has since replaced Craftsteak at MGM as our favorite steak place in Vegas (although you can, perhaps surprisingly, get a great filet at Mon Ami Gabi).

What we like about Carnevino is the great Florentine steakhouse approach. It's a great grill, and feels comfortable, not over the top like many places in Vegas. The caprese here is the best I've had outside of Italy or homemade (which doesn't sound like it should be hard; but there are a lot of BAD capreses out there). Black fettuccine and the bucatini allamatriciana (one of my favorites) are solid starters on your way to the main course. The meat portions are big, and typically, my wife and I split the 12 oz filet, but the ""Fiorentina"" experience is also memorable. Don't forget the  black truffle vinaigrette.

Also, slight warning for you coffee people. They don't do house-brewed. Your closest bet will be an Americano, so if you don't know what that is, don't expect the Folgers.",Zd9vLSif9Ejhbu5flxiflg,0,0,5,Dw1OpOixm6xA-pqXjcz5uA

I am not much of a steak person but since it is one of the most brag dish, I and my girlfriend tried it and of course the two waiters were explaining several times the price is $76each as we share the rib eye bone in steak as our main dish.

I specifically ask for medium well just pink in the center but it was served bloody  (my preference should have been heard not how they wanted it cooked!)After it was cut and was taken back to the kitchen of course it became well done!The steak was no longer moist and palatable and we ended up not finishing most if it!

We tried the pasta special with truffles which I can't barely taste it, and half a bowl for $55 and the grilled octopus  (I would say this was prepared and cooked right! ).

For the side, we had brussel sprouts and mashed potatoes with egg  (they added bacon tidbits that is the only thing that made it good)!But not out of this world.

Then we completed our dish with tiramisu again a mistake was made so we got two desserts because they gave us the chocolate and peanut butter torte first which we did not order  (servers said it is now a compliment from the chef since it is already in our table).We got a cappuccino and a green tea.

I paired my steak with Pinot Noir and  I must say it was good wine but for glass it was way out of price.

I was hoping to get a well compensated worth of dining experience with respect to what I paid for but it failed my expectations .I must say the service was great except for not getting my order right with the steak and the dessert .

The mashed potatoes come with a poached egg in the center which is mixed at the table.  Not a big hit and we asked for an order without the egg.

this beef is simply the best that i've ever had.  there are apparently only three restaurants in the world that stock this beef and carnevino is one of them.  our waiter, like all LV waiters very strongly pushed a few dishes, but we were glad he did.  we had the beef cheek pasta and the bolognese dish, both were sumptuous with the perfect amount of bite in the pasta.  

let's talk about the beef.  don't be daunted by the choices on the menu.  we wanted ribeye, but not the ribeye for two, which was definitely bigger than my head with my arm attached.  our waiter told us about a ribeye for ONE which we absolutely wanted.  

how do i describe it?  we ordered it medium rare, and it looked red, but not bloody.  it truly was perfectly cooked.  the fat on the meat was so flavorful.  the texture was amazing.  i routinely buy grassfed, pasture raised organic beef and it does not even come close to this.  if you have a chance, PLEASE go to carne vino. you will not be disappointed.

He was 4 star on one (the steak) and less than one star on the 'relaxing'  request. The room was lovely, mostly empty when we arrived, and they tried to seat us at a 4 top in the doorway between the 2 dining rooms, that would have one of our party partly blocking the flow of waiters and patrons moving between the rooms. We requested to be reseated and the second table was acceptable. Then the trouble began, the MUSIC was better suited to the Hard Rock Cafe and the volume of a major outdoor concert!!!  On  4 occasions we requested that the music be turned down, and it never was. Our waiter told us the manager refused to do that. I requested the manager come to the table to talk to us. That did not happen either.

The highlight of the evening (besides the hostess) was a hand made ravioli with some sort of duck sauce.  Just a great dish.  Not heavy at all and bursting with flavor.

They cut the steak for you and serve you, i can only imagine how much blood there was before it reached my plate.

The pasta dishes, intended as appetizers, are egregiously small. Insulting actually. $48 for two very small plates of pasta. This isn't a Ponzi scheme...it's a Pasta scheme. 

Side dishes are respectable, but nothing outstanding. Options for steak sauce are weak sauce 

Carnevino's definition of steak doneness is rarer than normally accepted. In other words, if you usually order medium-well, you would have to order well-done at Carnevino. This is an obvious attempt on the part of Mario Batali to prevent, in his eyes, savages who order their cuts well-done and in the process ruin the steak. It's pretentious and paternalistic. I had to order my steak well-done...and guess what, it came out well done, not medium-well as promised. I would have sent it back had the wait for the food not been so long.

There was an extensive wait for our food. Our server apologized twice and thanked us for our patience once our dinner arrived. After declining desert, we were presented with a complimentary desert. This was a nice gesture, but allow me to offer come constructive criticism. If you're going to present a complimentary desert, management should let the patron choose which one they want...instead of testing them to see whether they order desert.

532819,2012-01-04,0,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"This restaurant lives up to it's name of Carnevino. Meat and wine, that says it all. Mario Batali and Joe Bastianich have put together a very unique dining experience. Not because of it's blending of fine Italian cuisine along side of Steak; but due to it's blending of everything that make dining enjoyable. Carnevino is located in the Palazzo Casino and Hotel at 3325 Las Vegas Blvd. S. You would never know that you were dining in a casino due to the location of the restaurant. Carnevino is located at the side of the casino so there is no foot traffic passing by your dining area. The restaurant is also divided in two parts which are facing each other. One area is where the kitchen is located, and the other is by itself with only the other patrons and your wait staff. Each area can see to the other but are not connected which in itself is quit unique.

The first time I went I was a bit taken aback by what I thought were high prices. I can say though that once you taste the food presented you understand the prices and wonder how they charge so little. My wife and I had the Bone in Rib Eye for two. I have to say that this is by far the best piece of meat I have ever had the pleasure to eat. It was so tender and easy to eat. It did not melt in my mouth. If meat melts in your mouth you do not get the joy of the meat resting in your mouth as you chew. I say bravo to the chefs who created this bit of heaven on earth to enjoy. The salad prior to the steak was wonderful as well. The sides were equally pleasing.

We also had the most wonderful dessert. I would tell you about it, but it does not seem to be currently on the menu, and I think you would cry knowing what you are no longer able to get. I know I am crying that it is no longer there.

I must say that I am equally pleased with the wine selection. What would you expect at a place called CarneVINO. The Somalia was very knowledgeable and took the time to make sure every customer was pleased and taken care of with their wine or cocktail selections.

I also must complement our wait staff. We had two in attendance and they waited on us only until just before we received our check. My wife and I were both made to feel as if we were the only patrons in the establishment. Thank you so very much Carnevino.",I8_iXLcpYHAb_xi2vShgOg,1,0,5,4MWT64BJ7g3drcKAwtlV8w

Service:  The service was excellent.  We had a great waiter who was prompt, thorough and thoughtful.

Food:  We started with the truffle pasta ($50).  My wife liked it better than me, but I just thought it was ok.  I have had this at other places where it is mouth-watering, but this seemed a little dry.  Perhaps they should have also used truffle oil/butter instead of just shaving truffles on top of the dry pasta.

We shared the bone-in ribeye for two- $140.  While they were caving it at the table I noticed that it seemed very fatty - more fatty than most rib eyes.  It was tasted ok, but certainly not worth the money.  It was very rich and decedent.  When we were done there were several large chunks of fat still on our plate.  Normally, I like a well marbleized steak, but this took it to the extreme...plus the cost was too high given what was uneatable.  

Abiance - its not the most secluded place in Vegas seeing as it is stick in the middle of a mall.  Our table had some privacy but you could definitely hear the mall traffic.

It gets 4 stars for its steak, which was very good, but about average for what I consider a restaurant of this caliber.  It was fun to watch them carve it table side, and it was very appetizing, but the steak in my opinion was what I would get at any good steakhouse.  

My favorite part of the meal was the pasta that I got as part of the BBL tasting menu.  The beef cheek ravioli was amazing, and I can definitely say the most outstanding dish of the meal.  Even the other pasta, the pappardelle with mushrooms, was in my opinion better than the steak.  For an Italian steakhouse, they at least got the Italian part right.  

Yes the fresh bread was very good, and very hot, and the butter that came with it was good, however, the Lardo was way to heavy on the rosemary, you couldn't taste anything else with it. 

The wine was my 2nd favorite part of the meal, it was superb.  I did the wine pairing with the tasting menu, and it was just wow, and each wine was so different from the others.  I really liked how the server or sommelier would explain each one and the nuances about it while serving it.  If your afraid of ordering wine, just have a sommelier brought over and tell them what you like and your price range and they'll make suggestions based on that.  This was one meal that was brought up a notch due to the wine.

I was wondering if I should write a review because I work in the restaurant industry and don't like writing negative reviews but I couldn't help it! 

In short:

Very overpriced, ($1200 for 5 people. And we didn't even splurge on great wine)

Wines very overpriced! 

Food nothing special, with small exceptions, but it should have been great across the board given the prices!

Our server was great! 

However, I can't say the same of the sommelier. He was not very helpful, with zero personality, an he didn't seem to care. I am a sommelier myself but wanted his input because I wasn't familiar with majority of Italian wines on the menu and wanted to find a good one. I took his recommendation and ordered a wine that appeared to be flat or little off. I kindly asked for the sommelier. I wanted him to taste it and tell me if this is the way is supposed to taste. I hate sending wine back, but it really wasn't pleasant and it was a $170 bottle. Someone else came, it might have been the manager. He tasted the wine and said unfortunately this is the way it's supposed to taste and basically told me that this is what I get for this price ($170) as if I ordered a cheap wine!!!! O well, it's true, it was on the ""cheaper"" side on their wine list. 

So I had to keep the wine! Any respectable restaurant would have taken it back!  This is what I do in my restaurant and I believe this a restaurant norm. Or at least this is the norm in the good fine dining restaurants! 

I will never return, and would never recommend this restaurant to anyone. But I don't think they would care. They get plenty of tourist traffic and probably don't care for returning customers.",1WNCvBmjVckLNwCzihFSog,3,1,1,XR5q4Rc3DKyrVxByTkNMYg

Here are my thoughts: 

Venue - Very nice and designed well. The high ceilings made this place standout in addition to the layout of the restaurant. Great for group and a date type of setting. 

Beverages - Generous pours is all I say. The wine menu selection was great.  

Appetizer - We skipped out on this and focused on the side dishes. However I've had the jalapeno crab black ink pasta and it was great. 

Main Entree -   The dry aged rib-eye was fantastic. It's amazing how aging the steak makes a big difference in the taste quality. They leave the bone-in as it helps with the flavor of the steak. Best steak I've ever had.

Service - They definitely do not let the ball drop. From checking in, being seated, ordering and continuous service through out the night was outstanding. I never had an empty glass of water. 

Nice benefits - Table side carving of the rib-eye added a nice touch and they cook the steak perfectly.

562542,2012-08-16,0,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"I had the best steak I've ever had in my entire life at Carnevino.  I would say it's probably better than the notoriously expensive kobe beef that I've had in Japan, that's how good it was.

It was the steak that made the night, I must admit, it was so amazing that I don't remember much of everything else.  Oh, I guess the foie gras and barolo that's LOADED with shaved truffle sure helped made my night, but it was the steak that totally blew my mind.  Did I mention that the steak was awesomely fantastic?

Ok, the steak.  The reason why we went there was because my husband found out that Carnevino has some 9 months old died aged steak available.  If you do not already know, dry aging of beef in itself is already a rare practice, as the dry aging process actually shrink the meat by quite a bit.  And if the steak house do dry aging, 1 or 2 months is the maximum time that they would do it.  We were advised by the waiter that the restaurant would have lost about 50% of the meat by dry aging it for 9 months.  Anyhow, you can google that stuff yourself.  You order by picking the cut of meat (ribeye or striploin) and how thick you want it.  We ordered 2 inch of the ribeye which is about 30 oz bone-in.  The steak alone was about $230 (ouch) but boy was it good.  The taste is intense with melt in your mouth goodness.  It's actually very filling as well given how most of the moisture is gone and it's just lots of protein. 

Aside from the steak, everything else was good but nothing mind blowing. The restaurant decor is not as gorgeous as I would like it to be either, but I sure will return for the steak.",U3yUqN9bwqolWapCFkB5eQ,1,1,5,HszzJvX2WF7NBUSlkY2LZg

We were sat immediately in a large dining room with large wood tables covered in white table cloths.  When we were first sat, we were the only diners in the restaurant.  By the end of our meal, three other couples had been sat.  Thus, the ambiance and noise level were relaxed (so long as you didn't mind the hard rock music playing in the background).  

We enjoyed well-seasoned and light calamari, a steak sandwich with Tuscan fries, and a thinly-sliced pastrami sandwich with pickled vegetables.  Our server helped me pick a glass of Pinot Noir to accompany my sandwich, and her recommendation paired excellently.  

The food was delicious and the service was friendly, professional, and prompt.  Our bill was $105 including tip, so it was an expensive lunch, but well worth it.  I believe most Yelpers commented on dinner service.  Carnevino is worth a try for lunch if you want a more relaxed atmosphere and more choices for food selections.  Even at lunch, you can order their dry-aged ribeye, which is sliced tableside, and weighs in at approximately 35-40 ounces of meat for two persons and costs about $140, according to our server.",cEDwvf1Fdt3g4yejBOqwvA,0,0,4,Et8QZPTUKgUh7lB8H0wpmQ

The pasta was poor: the meat was super rare and not great - they recooked some of it and it was just poor: the only thing that was good was the octopus. They have a wine menu with hundreds of bottles of wine from $150 to thousands. I checked my wine app and the $150 bottle got great reviews - guess what - they didn't have it, but I called it, to my colleague sitting next to me before I ordered it. They'll not have it.....the wine Waiter of course was pushing me to $300 bottles at a minimum.
My guess is they don't get much repeat business and just fleece people in a way that is expedient for them. Our bill was over $300 per head and we had several people who left hungry.

-Three requests for the same drink.
-A glass of wine that took 25 minutes to ""prepare"".
-I believe that you are required to ask three time to get a glass of water.
-35 minute wait for gelato...really?

When noting to our lead waiter that the service was substandard, especially considering we paid $130 per person, we were shocked when the Manager smiled, told our party that we were inaccurate in describing our ""experience"", told the party that we are going to pay for everything, including a mandatory $250 tip and that there was nothing we can do. To add insult to injury, when the Manager came back to the table with the bill, she brought two security gards that ""were going to oversee the table until the bill was paid"". I have never been treated so poorly in my entire life and I would not recommend ever stepping foot in this establishment. 

There are too many good options in Las Vegas to even run the risk of being treated like this. Do yourself and your guests a favor and enjoy a dining experience where the restaurant treats their patrons with some courtesy.

When the steak came it was completely full of fat and simply was not a good cut. the filet mignon side was two bites literally and one bite  was half gristle. When the waiter came out to ask how everything was and we were visibly disappointed they were immediately defensive and argumentative about the steak and how it should be. They would not listen to us at all. Furthermore, they asked us if we would like to have another fillet. We said no. They ended up bringing another fillet out to us anyway. When they brought 
It. I said we said no to that offer and that we didn't want it and that it was a waste that they did what we did not ask for.   We had said no thank you. I told the general waiter that it was a waste and that there were people starving in this country and we had said no. He then said that it would not be a waste that they would put it under the hot box and serve it to someone else. I said WHAT????? I am appalled. Anyway I asked for them to remove the drinks from my bill ot the steak  and They said no. It was apparent that they didn't want to do anything for us. They were very cocky. They ended up being very pissed off and removed one drink. My meal was $286 and I felt bad for not tipping the waiter, but they did nothing and were argumentative. The meal was so-so.

The filet and steak tartar just blew me away. This year, I went to Carnevino after having a meal at Cut (I had the Waygu beef so I know it's not a fair comparison). The waiters at Carnevino were less friendly this time-younger and seemed less experienced. They were a little snobby, which is really unfortunate. The meal was great but it did not blow me away like the first time. We accidentally received wedges  instead of greens (which they kindly gave us for free because of the mix up). I remember the dry texture of the wedges and for some reason that's what I taste when I think of Carnevino, and that makes me sad.

For starters, we ordered ZACH'S CHOPPED SALAD and CANNELLONI.  The salad was decent but the cannelloni was bland, cold, and a complete waste of calories.  For the main course, we ordered the rib eye for 2 which tasted like it had been deep fried in old oil and was certainly not worth the $150.  In addition, we had the potatoes and broccoli.  Both were cold but the potatoes were likely prepared in the morning and warmed in the microwave a few times prior to our service.  The broccoli consisted of only the inedible broccoli leaves.  We had a few stems and a hint of a floret.  
We refused to give up so persisted through dessert.  We ordered the Lemon Curd Semifreddo.  Obviously, nobody at the restaurant has any idea what Semifreddo is as we received a ball of lemon curd ice cream which was completely inedible.
You would minimally expect an Italian restaurant to serve a decent espresso.  It tasted like coffee grounds and couldn't even be gagged down.
To add insult to injury, the ambience consisted of extremely loud, expletive filled gangster hip hop music!  We could barely hear each other speak and heard several others complain while we were waiting for our table (which was only available 20 minutes after our reservation).  The staff just laughed it off and behaved as if everyone was just being overly sensitive
The wine list was impressive but ridiculously expensive and the patrons are not trusted to test the wines themselves.  The restaurant sommelier tested our wine before it was brought to our table!  I have never seen anything like it and hope to never again.

BONE INE RIBEYE FOR 2- BEST! Ordered it medium and came a little less than medium. The meat was fantastic all the way thru. Best part was the bone and you can eat it like a rib!
Filet mignon- delish
Lamb chops- incredible!

If every server could be like him dining out would be so pleasurable all the time. To start - a carpaccio ""salad"" if you will. Thins slices over arugula dressed with an amazing balsamic and some parmigiana reggiano. It was a special that evening and it was special. We had the orecchiette with sweet sausage and broccoli rabe and the potato gnocchi bolognese second. Both were delicious. Pasta done to perfection, sausage and bolognese both so flavorful and simple. Next I had the 12 oz filet. She had the 20 oz bone-in chop. Meat was cooked to perfection, perfect seasoning, and plating was beautiful. Portion was equal to the price we both felt. For sides = mascarpone mashed potato and roasted butternut squash. The mashed potatoes are served with a poached egg on top that you break and then mix in. It's out-of-this-world delicious. I was just sad that there wasn't a larger dish of them. Wine was amazing - the list is crazy extensive and our new Southern friend navigated it with us very well.

Now, about that steak's temperature. I'm a medium rare person. Most places seem to miss medium rare and hit medium instead. The kitchen, to my astonishment, recommended medium. I doubted them, but went with their advice. The steak was a deep ruby red with a warm center, and a nice crust, just as they described it (see attached terrible photo). They nailed it. I'm sorry I doubted them! So, when you order a steak ask them for the kitchen's recommendation and what that means. It's a little different from what you might expect.

Located within the bowels of Palazzo, we were happy to find that this is open until midnight, allowing us to get a (hopefully!) great bite to eat before continuing the night.

Their late night menu has a stripped down list of items to choose from - some quick hits like burgers, steak and eggs, and a selection of apps, salads and entrees.

We started with the fried calamari, lightly crispy and very tender.

I had the steak and eggs - a nice cut of steak (medium-rare), eggs and a whole bunch of fingerling potatoes.  I was full and happy for it.

My buddy had the burger with fries.  I've never seen him so happy to eat a burger.

They have a wide variety of Italian beers (most of which I'd never seen before, even in fancy craft brew bars) and cocktails, like the Honeyed Ginger Ale (Wild Turkey ""American Honey"" bourbon liqueur, ginger beer, fresh ginger) - so gingery it hurt.  But in a good way.

We were seated in the main dining room at 9:50, 20 min late but no problem.  Our table had a very strong breeze, ice cold, directly on us and the girls were freezing.  We asked to be moved and the next table had the same issue.  In fact, all the tables available had the same issue.  We were informed that all the dining rooms were linked by the same HVAC system and if it were to be moderated in the main rom, then the other rooms would get too warm.  Has anyone heard of balancing a system.  The wait staff gave the girls chef coats to warm them up as it was unbearable in a strapless dress while trying to eat.  Lets move to the music.  It was BLASTING loud and it was bad.  Some speed metal totally inappropriate for a nice restaurant.  Our group goes to rock concerts all the time, and we like music, this was some obscure metal band and it was thunderingly loud.  Even the staff hated it.  We were told that it was ""Mario's own play list"".   Finally, lets turn to the food. Me and my buddy split the bone in ribeye, usually my favorite.  This piece of meat wasn't just well marbled like it should have been, but it was gristly.  Tough strands of solid gristle ran through the meat.    All the sides got cold in 5 min due to the cold win blowing on the table.The whole experience was a disaster.

I've tried a couple and I've to give props to Carnevino for being a uniquely Italian Steakhouse. What this means is that you get a lot of other great Italian dishes besides just steak.

I've tried Batali's other venture, B&B which was an all Italian restaurant which was pretty spectacular. Carnevino is able to deliver part of that refine italian cuisine and yet let you end of with that hearty unpretentious piece of meat you enjoy.

We had an excellent server who was funny and knew his Menu very well. Definitely made our experience with at Carnevino even better.

The wine list read like a yellow page...it was so comprehensive we didn't know where to begin. So if you like Italian, Steak and Wine then you've come to the right place.

As this is a delayed review I can't remember all the names of the dishes very well. I can say for sure that the Grilled Octopus is a must try, Beef Cheek Ravioli (not on Menu) was good, Truffle Pasta (seasonal) was so so..I find the truffle lacking flavor although their homemade pasta was superb.

One would think it's the best of both worlds, but somehow both sides come up short.  If I want Italian, I go someplace authentic.  If I want a steak, I go somewhere that specializes in it.  Our dinner was good, but not great and definitely didn't equal up to the bill.

We started with the calamari and the gnocchi bolognese.  The calamari was tender and light and the peppers were nice, but the marinara sauce seemed to thick for the dish.  The gnocchi was good, but the bolognese didn't seem to have a lot of flavor.  

We weren't to original both getting the filet, which was was very tender, but nothing more than I would expect from a steakhouse.  I would suggest adding one of the sauces to make the dining experience more unique.  We ordered the mixed mushroom with spring onion as our side.  We were pleasantly surprised when it was severed with Fresno peppers added, as that was not listed on the menu.  The couple we were with ordered the spinach which also had Fresno peppers, so I'm guessing that they had a bunch of peppers that they needed to get rid of.  They were not as thrilled and didn't like the heat it added.  We were told that the sides were large enough to share, but I'm pretty sure that is only if you each order a side.  I would recommend everyone order their own side and then share to try different items.

My brother (the hard-core foodie) knew that the best steak, the reservo, is not on the menu. It had been hanging since late June (almost nine months), and our server Jim did a fabulous job of explaining the taste profile. He also suggested pairing it with a more traditional cut, both to provide a contrast and to cut the gamey taste of the older meat. For my two cents, the old stuff is great and has an element of ham in its taste...but that's just me. The appetizers and sides were fine but utterly uneventful, though the steak tartar was a touch better than that. Our first round of cocktails was solid but nothing special, but after the first round the bartender, Cooper, came to check up on us. He offered to make me something off-menu if I gave him a taste profile. He came back with an A+ concoction of amaro, orange bitters, orange vodka, ginger, and lemon. Highly recommended!

My only complaint would be about pacing. For $200/person, I expect pacing for a 2-hour meal. As the appetizers were coming, I expressed this concern to Jim, and a 2-hour meal did, in fact, occur.

Unfortunately, my visit came in a time where I had to give up red meat, pork, and rice for lent. Sad, I know. Why would I torture myself by going to a steakhouse for dinner? Because of the pasta they were serving. The Pasta at B&B didn't meet my dietary restrictions so off to Carnevino I go.

Dining alone has always felt weird for me, Vegas is all about friends and family so dining alone in this big city was very alien to me but sitting at the bar for dinner and talking to the staff made it easier for me.

As much as I wanted to eat a ribeye steak, I can't. So I ended up ordering a spaghetti frutti di mare and cannoli for dessert. 

They started off by offering an amuse bouche of Parmesan cheese ball, fried cheese ball, salty and savory. Great way to start the meal off. Then a complementary rosemary ciabatta bread with 2 spreads, butter and lardo spread. The ciabatta was baked perfectly, amazing outer crust, tasty and salty, with a super soft inner bread. My goodness, I could eat that bread all day everyday. One of the best variation of ciabatta i've ever ever tasted.

The spaghetti frutti di mare was delicious. The base sauce was nicely balanced, slightly acidic, and had some heat to it. The seafood had 2 big prawns which was the size of langoustine, half a lobster, clams, and alot of calamari which were all cooked perfectly. The prawns and lobster were soft and succulent, the calamari were fork tender, and the clams were great. A real perfect dish. At $31, the seafood were generous.

The cannoli were gigantic. It's meant to be shared. 2 big pieces of cannoli, and 2 ice cream with sprinkles of pistachios. Perfect dessert to finish the meal.

During the meal, I asked if they had the famous ""6 month dry aged beef"", the server told me ""no we don't but we do have a 10 month old dry aged beef"". In my mind, 10 months!?!?! that must be one hell of a beef. For that, I want to eat that beef after April 20, 2014 which is the last day of lent.",t_jRD8drPcr1AFfco4sOxw,1,0,4,-3csVuU22qLJ4jZelg-InQ

I ordered 1 1/2 inch of the 8 month aged Strip cooked med-rare and my wife ordered the Sea Bass. We also had a side of mashed potatoes. The steak was cooked perfectly but seriously lacked flavor except for the small portions that had a little salt salt sprinkled on it and it wasn't as tender as I thought it would be. You do taste the aged flavor. 

My wife's seabass on the other hand was FANTASTIC. The portion size was super small but it packed a ton of flavor and was very soft and flaky. Neither of us were too crazy about the mashed potatoes either.

The good: The ambience was nice. 

The bad:
1) Supposedly the ""best ribeye in Vegas"". I am not sure how this came to be. The ribeye I shared apparently had been visited by a flavor vampire that sucked all of the taste out of the meat. 

2) We asked for medium and were told they cook a touch rare - that's ok thanks for the heads up. So we asked to make it more toward a traditional medium. Instead we get rare - borderline cold.

3) Dessert - a chocolate/peanut butter combination that was void of flavor. 

4) Wine - I am a wine snob. I know there are markups. But I am not kidding when I saw some 250-500% markups. For a comparisons I drank a bottle of a 2004 Burgundy premier Cru at Joel Robuchon for 195.00. At Carnevino I found a comparable 2012 for 395.00. 

5) They attempt to cover up the lack of flavor with their meats by pouring olive oil on the meat. 

The ugly:

1) An expensive tasteless meal with an overpriced wine selection. 

The disgusting:

1) My lady and I shared the ribeye and we each came down with a wicked case of food poising. There is zero doubt that Carnevino was the culprit as we had identical symptoms and they occurred nearly simultaneously.

845191,2012-02-20,0,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"Excellent!  One of the two best steaks I have ever had was the ""Reserva"" bone-in rib eye here that was dry aged for 8-9 MONTHS!!!  The flavor of the meat was so complex, earthy, and vibrant.  It was like bleu cheese and truffle had been infused into the meat itself.  The only other steak to even come close was true grade A-5 wagyu beef imported from Kobe, Japan.  The kobe steak was superior in terms of texture and tenderness, but the Carnevino Reserva is the clear winner in terms of flavor.  

The steak tartare was also very fresh and tasty.  The ""standard"" 100 day aged rib eye was also exceptional.  The veal cheek ravioli was nothing special.  The shitake mushroom with balsamic vinegar side was below average and did not suit our tastes.

The service was also very friendly, personal, and attentive.  We wanted a combination of the Reserva and the tasting menu.  Our waiter spent a great deal of time trying to understand everything we wanted to try and helped us customize our order perfectly.

It's pricey and as a value proposition, maybe more like a 4.5 star place, but the Reserva is something you must try before you die.",cqGNPY-Do-Zv4CcYpHJ3mQ,0,0,5,m2V2rs518I4eZb4b4-3Q2g

We waited for an hour after our appetizers for our steaks to arrive.   We were told multiple times that their beef was the best in the world.  I have eaten beef in several places around the world and this place doesn't hold a candle to many more comfortable and welcoming places.  Our ribeye was horrible. The waiter was having a hard time cutting it but he did it with great flare. When I took the first bite I thought it must have been a mistake so took one more and I was done. The waiter took the steak away and apologized. I told him I wouldn't care for anything else since everyone else would be done before me. When he brings out the bill he charged me for the freaking steak!!  I was incredulous. He told me it wasn't his call......  I told him to get a manager and he of course took it off the bill but the automatic 20% gratuity (6 people?) Of course wasn't touched.

Our waited was really strange first of all...we ordered wine and then we find out that they don't have it, then we ordered the tuna as an appetizer and, again, they don't have it. So at this point we're a little annoyed. A friend orders the salmon and asks how does the chef prefer to cook it? The waiter gave an attitude and says ""well no one ever asks that question"". So we were kinda shocked the way he said it. I mean, a good restaurant should be able to offer fish rare-well done. Anyways, the filet mignon was just ok, the short ribs were good but more on the fatty side, the lamb chops were also on the fatty side and the salmon was pretty good. Service was good just our waiter wasn't very good. Yes the restaurant is loud but we actually enjoyed the music.

876629,2013-06-06,0,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"No idea how anyone could rate this place poorly. To each his own, I suppose. My wife and I consider ourselves to be fairly critical foodies, and this was honestly one of the most amazing meals we have ever eaten.

First of all -- our servers Shepherd and Ian were helpful, friendly, attentive, and gave amazing recommendations. We were very well taken care of from start to finish.

Appetizer:  Grilled octopus. My wife was excited about this - me, not so much. What can I say? I was amazed. NOT chewy, but instead flavorful, tender, and expertly prepared. Tasted like slow-cooked barbecue. The secret? Boil the octopus in corks to make it tender!

Mid-Course:  Beef cheek ravioli. Off menu, as recommended by Shepherd. OUT OF THIS WORLD. Do not miss out on this amazing dish. Rich, melt-in your mouth, foodgasm.

Entree:  Aged ribeye for two. Fabulous steak, prepared perfectly, and served table-side. We could not stop eating it!

Sides:  Who needed sides? But we could not resist the creamy mashed potatoes with mascarpone cheese and a poached egg and the spicy ""creamed"" style corn. Both fabulous and perfect compliments to the steak.

Dessert: Not sure how we made room for this, but the fruit crisp was delicious, and even was served with a ""Happy Birthday"" to my wife.

Even the music was pleasing to our ears. I asked who picked this fine selection of blues/Southern Rock, and was told that Mario B. picks them himself!

I know there are TONS of options for an amazing meal in Las Vegas. This place may not be for everyone. It's NOT a traditional steak house by any means. Is it worth the price tag? ABSOLUTELY. Do not miss out on Carnevino!",TE3ptVUA5fmmnkXEbh9lQA,3,2,5,DbfBZS0zAl6ybqt14dSuQQ

902742,2015-09-03,3,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"We had dinner at Carnevino at the Palazzo Hotel.  While the food was very good, we had the worst restaurant experience of our lives here on September 1, 2015.  It was my husband's 70th birthday party, and I had beautiful glass decorations on the table.  After dinner we packed them carefully, and asked if they could be left there while we attended a show at the Palazzo Theater.  We were assured it would be fine, and to pick our bags up at the hostess stand when the show was over.  We picked up the bags, and five of the glass decorations were missing.  After calling the restaurant, hotel security, and 5 other people, Richard, the manager of the restaurant, told us in no uncertain terms that he would do absolutly nothing to compensate us.  He offered no resolution to make it right, not even a drink!  He said he yelled at his staff for accepting the bags (which we should not be told), and was rude to my husband on the phone.  He further said the hostess stand was the Palazzo property and their responsibility, the Palazzo said it was the restaurant's responsibility.  Neither was willing to help. The way we feel, is if you offer to hold the bags you are responsible for them, otherwise say no.  There was no empathy or kindness.  These were not valuable, but sentimental.  It is the principle of 
good customer service and basic manners that was lacking.  We are local to Las Vegas and frequent both Carnevino and the Palazzo.  For all the money I spent there last night, they certainly managed to ruin the evening.",3i_ghGBa0g7GzJmkTDgBTw,6,1,1,x_ODByq-imOe_sepLAbolQ

912676,2012-03-19,0,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"Unfortunately this was so disappointing.  I was expecting an amazing steakhouse experience based on other reviews I had read and the caliber of restaurants in the Palazzo/Venetian complex.  I thought when we first entered the restaurant and were greeted by our waiter we were in for a real treat.  I love the steakhouse experience and was excited to try this one.  It just didn't live up to my expectations.  The music was too loud and maybe inappropriate for a steak house.... Loud Rock music?? I don't know, maybe it just wasn't to my taste.  The service staff was courteous and knowledgeable and started off on the right foot, but turned out to be just too slow.  And the food wasn't good, the wine was good, the sides were good, the bread was good, but the star of the show..... not so much.  I mean it's a steak house, you go for the amazing sides and the meat but especially the meat and this just didn't live up.  

We had an early reservation at 5PM because we were attending a show and we opted for the prefix theater menu thinking only to save a little time to make our 7 o'clock show.  We let the waiter know we were going to want the fast track and he confirmed with us it would be no problem, they serve pre-theater guests all the time.  We were sorry we had to rush our meal, but we figured an hour and 45 minutes should be enough time.  It wasn't.

When ordering our meat we were told this restaurant doesn't follow the normal cooking standard for beef.  For example if you want your meat medium rare you should order it medium. We confirmed our understanding with the waiter of the cooking temps and ordered our meal. And from here on it went down hill. When our meat FINALLY came they were all over cooked and bland.   I mean, no flavor in the beef at all.  I make better steak than this.  We asked the waiter over and let him know they were all wrong and he offered to send them back for us (as he should).... but at this point, we were out of time.  So we asked for butter, salt and pepper (ridiculous to have to season your own meat at the table of a steakhouse!) and ate.

We asked for the manager to come over so we could let him know we were disappointed and when he finally showed up he did what he could and was courteous about the whole thing.  Unfortunately you just can't make up for bland food and slow service.  

I just can't recommend this restaurant.  I wish I could but if you're looking for a great steak house experience, this isn't the place.",sE1QQlWjgtCwF-oOv-_VQg,0,0,1,QkQd0QMcg62Fv0CiRZizqg

We were able to sit at the bar a few minutes before our reservation and the bartender told us about the beef cheek ravioli and the rib eye for one. Both of these items are not in the menu but well worth it. The rib eye for one was enough for me and my wife to share. The server brings it out and cuts up the rib eye and describes all the parts.

942411,2010-04-27,0,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"Came here with a friend during lunch time, while visiting Vegas. Upon entering, the place looks huge and the giant bull statue by the entrance really gives this place some presence. The architecture and decor is similar to that of an Italian banquet hall, a room with high ceilings and doors to match. This was in the late afternoon and around that time I went the sun floods the room just right giving you a great lighting of the entire area. To be honest the feel, look and atmosphere seemed like I was actually in Italy. OK on to the food.

This place has a set menu for lunch and a set menu for dinner and both are different from each other. The lunch menu didn't look very tasty at all and it didn't offer any steaks listed from the dinner menu and we both had our stomachs set for steak. My friend and I asked if we could order something from the dinner menu, but the waiter was a bit reluctant but would ask the chef if we could. Luckily, we arrived at a time when business was very very slow, where my friend and I are the only one there for lunch. The waiter came back and said the chef would cook it if we don't mind waiting 35-45 mins. to bring the frozen dry-aged bone in ribeye to room temperature for cooking. We were more than happy to wait for their signature steak, which can only be ordered by 2 people (lucky us).

Along with the bone in ribeye we also ordered a plate of fried calamari. We were also asked by the waiter if we wanted to add a sauce for our steak, something to compliment it with. However, our waiter said you shouldn't bother, the steak is seasoned perfectly and tastes better w/o any of Carnevino's sauces. Rather friendly advice if you ask me and so we saved ourselves $5 from a sauce.

The calamari was cooked perfectly, although it was rather small in terms of size, moderate in terms of portion and reasonably high in term of price. OK as for the ribeye. OMG! That was perhaps the best bone in ribeye I have ever tasted. It's huge, which explains why it is meant for 2 people. They cut that slab of meat off of the bone right next to you and serves it on your plate. They also leave the bone with any left over meat for you to gnaw at it like the Flintstones. Between my friend and myself I'm usually the eater, however, this time around I had to make my friend eat the rest of the meat. The waiter was correct about the ribeye being seasoned perfectly. The salt and pepper used to season the ribeye was more than enough and it left a very nice, slightly crunchy crust to the outside of the meat. No matter what the beef of this place is worth the money. Didn't have any wine though. Didn't feel I needed to add any more to the bill. Besides the steak was more than enough. I must have had an off-day in terms of eating. I really wanted to gnaw at the bits of meat on the bone.

955252,2009-10-08,0,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"Love Love Love Mario Batali's Enoteca Italian restaurant in the shoppes area of Venetian.  Thought I'd try this restaurant at the Palazzo.

Nice decor certainly fitting a steakhouse.  Prices are pretty standard to high compared to most premium steakhouses.  Wine by the bottle is psycho, glasses start at @ $18 each.

Starters: prosciutto sliced soooo thin you could see through it.  Served with 3 tiny pieces of melon smaller than my little finger.  Nice presentation though and enough proscuitto ($29.00).  One of the specials was lobster raviloi but they were sold out and substituted for braised short rib ravioli.  Excellent flavor - served in a butter herb sauce.  3 ravs also around $29.00.

Entrees: Osso bucco perfectly cooked, topped with a little bit of gremelata, and a small portion of risotto.  Could have made a meal on the risotto, it was very al dente, a little lemony and did not look like it was arborio rice either but it was good.  I think my osso bucco is better however.

Another entree was the simple 8oz petite filet cooked medium rare.  It was a very odd looking piece of meat.  When it came sitting in the middle of a huge white plate it didn't even look real.  It had no aroma or evidence of being cooked as in just off the grill.  It was dull.  Cutting into it, there was absolutely no juice.  Weird.  But, still delicious and tender.  Can't explain that. Hmmmm, $45.00 for the filet, $39.00 for the osso bucco.  

Didn't really get the connection off the menu to Mario Batali's great Italian works.  But if you go, bring your credit card or lots of money.  Small portions, big prices, but still good.

956501,2016-01-01,3,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"I came here with a few friends last night.  The wait staff doesn't care about client satisfaction at all and are a bunch of crooks when it comes to gratuity.  Read on to find out the details, but BEWARE if you are planning on going to eat here.

The dinner started off nice, with the chef sending some complimentary cheese donut holes.  When we were ordering our meals, the waiter recommended a special $80 8 month aged steak, which we ordered on his recommendation.  In addition to this, we ordered some sides, apps and a 2-person ($150) aged ribeye steak (these were all actually pretty good).  

Here's where the night started to go sour: Since the waiter cuts the steaks table side, he saw there was something wrong with the special 8 month aged steak, and told us that there were ""imperfections in the steak"".  We asked what we should do and he said, eat around those dark spots or it will taste like iodine.  About 1/3 of the steak was covered with brown spots, so we discarded nearly half the steak.  One of my friends asked whether we would get a discount on the dish since it wasn't perfect, and the waiter said ""that is the risk you take when you order this steak.""  SERIOUSLY?  If I ordered a bottle of wine and it had turned into vinegar, would I have to pay for that too?  Needless to say, even the portion of that steak we were able to eat tasted terrible, and we mentioned it to the next person who came to check on us (the busser?) and all he said was ""Oh, ok."" and left.  It tasted like we were eating chemicals, it was really terrible.

Now the really bad part - when we get our bill, we asked for it to be split into 3.  It came out to $160 per person, and there was no break out of what was what on the broken out bills.  There was a line on the check that had a ""suggested tip is $90"", and there was a blank line that said ""additional tip"".  After looking at all the paperwork, it didn't appear as though the tip had been included, so we went ahead and each added $30 to our total, essentially $200 per person for a steak and a few sides.  WOW.  We left and went on our way to gamble, etc.

The next day (today) I felt like something wasn't quite right about the bill.  I called Carnevino around 11am and spoke to the hostess and told her the story and asked her if the gratuity is automatically added to the bill.  She said yes.  I told her that I'm not going to pay a $60 tip on a $130 meal (especially a bad one).  She told me that she'd inform a manager and that they'd call me right back.  I called again at 1pm and at 3pm, and still the same story, the manager would call me back right away.

The practice of automagically adding tip to a bill is malicious and unethical.  At the very least, the waitor should have told us that the tip was already included.   I understand for a group of 6 or more, it is common practice to include it, but it is typically itemized, etc.  We were a group of 3, and we weren't told a single thing.  Greedy waiter hoping to get double tipped.

Needless to say, I'm still waiting for a call back from a manger.  I've informed my credit card company that I'm disputing the charges and related to them this story.  At any rate: BUYER BEWARE.  These guys (or at least the ones I dealt with) are crooks.",cpqKGSFDQsoATWRuQwT3ng,7,1,1,1X-W7JQZin8Epzv8ImGSaA

We were offered the Reserva (extra aged steaks)  but opted for the  dry aged rib eye instead.  It was truly mind blowing.  If U're a steak lovers like myself, U must try this.   The mashed potato was the best I've had.  My hubby thinks the mashed potato at Craftsteaks was better but he did love the rib eye at this place.

Their bread was delicious and comes with lardo spread.  It tasted just like breakfast sausage.  The bread alone is great and doesn't require the spread in my opinion.

Arugula salad: yummm pickled onions and cheese.

Black fettucine: the fettucine was black which is strange when you look at it, but it was delicious.  It had a nice kick to it thanks to the jalapenos.  There was crab in it, but just a pinch. 

Bone-In new york strip: I don't know what they glaze their meat with, but it creates this crust over the meat and its simply delicious

Main lobster tail: standard to any other restaurant

Roasted shitakes with aceto balsamico: I love balsamic vinegar and each and every mushroom is infused with it.

Mascarpone & guanciale mashed potatoes: this was different, but different good.  They crack a egg table side and mix it in with the potatoes.

1009964,2015-02-14,0,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"A few caveats before my comments; I was there at lunch and invited to order certain items off the dinner menu should I desire. I know bolognese as a cook and an enthusiast. My experience was excellent except for the bolognese. 

I was suspicious to eat at a restaurant where the owners are celebs and not-resident, so my expectations were cynical. But as a bolognese fanatic I wanted to experience the Batali-Bastianich version, as I thought this was/is their collective wheelhouse. I was quite disappointed to find it to be a bright, red sauce with meat ""pebbles' instead of the rusty-colored, velvety sauce accomplished with hours of patience. The excellent server, while helping me choose a perfect glass of wine, countered my expectation that this dish would be rich by helpfully offering that there was a ""little bit of cream"" but that it wasn't rich. I didn't pick up on the hint but should have(!) as many recipes call for a decent addition of milk, and a reduction, (one of many reductions) as opposed to cream, which sounds like a 'quick' bolognese; definitely what I was served. The pasta was a penne rigata and I was told it was fresh, house-made and I believe it, because it was dense and chewy; I would have opted for a tagliatelle which in my world is the most expected. I left most of the pasta behind. 

My server (Nicole) was extremely helpful and introduced me to a wine I loved and would not have found on my own. The chopped salad was really, really good. (again, I ordered it to 'cut' the richness but found it to be the star of my meal) Loved the lardo 'butter' and the rolls were worth the carbs. 

I enjoyed the decor and for those who want to enjoy the casino, it's right on the edge of the action. The bar looked like they planned to have people standing in it (this is so often missed!) and I would give this place another chance since it is, after all, meant to be a steakhouse, and I didn't go that route.

Some were amazing and this included the calamari that was cooked to perfection with just the right crispy batter.  In fact, since there were several dishes to sample during the first course, I was surprised when I went back to it after it had cooled and the calamari coating was still delicious.  I also loved a special pasta they had with fresh corn, the flavors were fabulous.  However there were a few dishes I was disappointed in, like the Roman salad that was rather bland, with very little dressing or flavor.
My biggest disappointment was a result of something the server did.  I was having a difficult time deciding on my main course and was torn between the mixed grill and one of the steaks.  I knew I wanted to try the aged beef they are known for, but decided on the mixed grill after the server listed its components as containing a 4oz skirt steak.  I love skirt steak and could then also try their bison sausage and giant shrimp.  When the dish was set down in front of me, I immediately asked about the steak as I could tell it was not skirt (generally a flat cut of beef).  The server was fetched and explained that no, it was actually hanger steak, but said he called it skirt because it is from the same part of the cow.  Funny because hanger steak is one of the few cuts I don't care for.  It is considered a good steak by many, it is just not my preference.  And it really isn't the same thing at all.  So after only one bite, my $62 mixed grill was a disappointment.  The shrimp was delicious, but the sweetbreads and bison sausage were just fare.  I had also ordered a $5 side of horseradish sabayon and was surprised it had so little flavor.  The sabayon texture was great, but I think there was a strong possibility they forgot the horseradish because all I tasted was the egg and salt.
The desserts were also a mix - the sorbet had great texture and a special they had with cannolis was delicious, however their ricotta and berry trifle was a little bland with very few berries.

The server then topped it with balsamic vinegar.  The ravioli pasta itself was a little bit chewy on the corner edges, but soft in the center. The first thing you taste are the high notes in the balsamic vinegar that the server put on the ravioli.  The butter really rounded out the flavor.  The filling inside the ravioli was kind of like a beef cheek paste.  it was very moist, not at all dry or soggy.  The ravioli was a little chewy on the outside but tender inside.  The consistency of the filling as smooth and velvety. The color of the filling was a brownish color, and the actual ravioli looked glossy from the butter.

Carnevino's aged steak stood out from their competition because of their 9 month+  Reserved grade.

Sharing is the way to go because the flavor is so rich (price too, haha).  And we normally order a pasta dish and I'd recommend the squid ink or truffle if available.

Always wondering what a Mario Batali restaurant experience would be like, I earned the opportunity to visit Carnevino this past Thursday with a very well known international, ""enthusiast,"" and his wife.

I've been to Maestros and Strip Steak, both which were excellent, but this was in a completely different realm. 

I can't begin to tell you what we had, but there was virtually everything imaginable in front of us. The 9month aged bone-in rib eye, mashed potatoes, the amazing bread, steak tartar and consistent, ""compliments of the chef,"" dishes kept pouring out.

The service was excellent along with the entire management staff and of course, the food.

I ordered the New York bone-in which was incredible. I also tasted some of the bone-in rib eye and the aged bone-in rib eye. Absolutely perfect.

I don't want to go into more detail because I would be spoiling the possibility for someone to experience what we did, so I will leave it at that.

Four hours later when we were finished and having digestif , the chef came out to chat with us. I'm sure it was due to the fact of who we were with.",4FBFspAoDegIkYuNAJYDuA,0,0,5,HTgECJpsr53AVqxr7XODUQ
1149399,2010-08-27,2,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"I am so damn broke.  Damn you Mario Batali & Joseph Bastianich.

We stayed at the Palazzo so we figured... we might as well choose a restaurant within the property and finally decided on Carnevino.  The restaurant itself is pretty big and we were brought all the way to the back, which was nice since it wasn't as loud as the main dining room and the high ceiling definitely makes it a nicer place to dine at.

After looking through the menu, the server somehow convinced us to go the ""family-style"" way, which is priced at a minimum of $100 per person but he would have the chefs prepare the top dishes in each course to share: 5 appetizers, 4 pastas, and 5 different cuts of meat.  He also guaranteed that we would not go hungry even though it was 9 guys.  

It ended up as one of the most expensive meals but pretty legit.  They started out by bringing rosemary infused bread that everybody gets with 2 kinds of spread: housemade butter and flavored pork back fat.  Yes, pork back fat, aka lard.  Don't be scared cause it was amazing haha.

 For appetizers, they brought out:

1. Insalata Caprese - amazing caprese salad with thick slices of heirloom tomatoes and a mozarella & cream combo called burrata.
2. Grilled Octopus - freaking amazing.  I never had octopus that tender and the limoncello reduction over it was genius.  
3. Fried Calamari - common item... but damn when it is done this well, I don't want it anywhere else. 
4. Hanger Steak Carpaccio - special of the night and pretty much a pile of arugula with a delicious steak carpaccio underneath and over it.
5. Affettati Misti - selection of house cured meats with a variety of grilled peppers.  The pork belly seriously just melts in your mouth.
6. Grilled Foie Gras - umm..... yes yes yes.  I think they drizzled a balsamic reduction over it too.  Crap.. I'm seriously drooling right now.

As for the pastas, each dish are all appetizer servings but if you want, you can add $15 more to make it into entree size.  All the pasta dishes are much more about the ingredients.  They brought out:

1. Potato Gnocchi Bolognese - just.. really really solid gnocchi with a really good bolognese.  Wish there was more bolognese though.
2. Puttanesca - olives, capers, and anchovies with penne.  Simple but so good.
3. Beef Cheek Ravioli - beef cheek = one of the most tender cut of meat ever and they even drizzle aged real balsamic over it.  Yea.  Heaven.
4. Black Truffle Pasta - when this came out, I was just... at a loss for words since it had real shaved slices of black truffle all over it rather than the typical truffle oil you see at many places.  The spaghetti itself with made with extra yolk too so the texture was amazing.  Favorite out of all.

For the meats, they bring it all out and they carve it off the bone right in front of you:

1. Veal chop - tender, perfectly done.  The bone-in probably gave it extra flavor.
2. Dry-aged Bone-in Ribeye - I love the seasoning and the crust.  Italian seasoned steaks is just good eating.  I still think Gallagher's dry-age beef is better though!
3. Lamb Chops - ok this was the best lamb I've had.  I'm not a big fan of lamb because of the gaminess, BUT somehow it's all good and it is absolutely amazing.  
4. Pork Chop - done medium well, and the way it is brined gives what seems like a really boring piece of pork good flavors.
5. Maine Lobster Tail - they only brought out one so it was kinda hard to share among all of us but... it was buttery goodness!  hahah.

They also brought out two sides: mashed potatoes with marscapone & guanciale (type of unsalted bacon) with raw egg yolk mixed in, and sauteed mushrooms & onions.  Both were perfect as side dishes.

At first we were afraid that we weren't gonna get full since the appetizer and pastas' portions were not big at all but after everything, we couldn't finish all the protein and it ended up being the perfect late night snack after XS :P

If you come with a big group, definitely think about getting the ""family-style"" since you'll get to truly taste what Carnevino is all about.  Just expected to drop... quite a bit of money especially if you order wine and after the 20% gratuity charge.",LyrAjv8V6HWkceuTB4Xtkw,4,2,4,9cykx5-k4UiEAid_3LhF4g
1150284,2011-05-10,0,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"This place is not for Stuck-up restaurant snobs, or people who don't want to spend money.  Don't come here and order a pasta dish and complain about price.  This place is a steak restaurant.  Get the steak, and understand that you're paying a premium for quality food and service.  

I truly Enjoy a great steak, and Carnevino prepared one of the greatest steaks I've ever eaten.

I was out with my buddy, celebrating my upcoming wedding. We started off with a great wine recommendation by the sommelier. The Wine paired well with our starter and main dishes.  Although some may find the wine to be expensive, we were charged only $87 for a bottle of wine that retails for $60 in the stores.  Either we got lucky, or overall their prices on wine are reasonable.  

The steak (The Strip) was cooked to perfection; a nicely crisped outside, and an incredible medium-rare cook on mine, while my buddy got a medium cook on his fillet.  I noticed the Rib Steak at the table next to mine, and it looked phenomenal.  Almost like a Flinstones bone, but tasty :D 

The bread came with lardo. The Taste of the lardo on the bread really made the meal pop.  If you haven't had lardo, do yourself a favour and put the lardo on your bun here.  Lardo is a cured and rendered pork fat.  I can't say enough about how it complimented the entire meal.

Some people may have found the music choice at the venue a bit odd. We listened to a series of 90's grunge songs. The music seemed out of place at first, but I really appreciated the atmosphere it commanded.",iOLQ90K7FBgJoZ0wMefh9A,2,1,5,N8-7FdFC8BPCzBUyulq7pQ
1150684,2010-05-23,0,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"THE most amazing experience of my life (so far) was at Carnevino. It consisted of a multi-course meal and wine pairings for each dish that we were served.

Where to start? I think I'll begin with the food...

- Bread, butter and lardo: Yes, I know... sounds incredibly unhealthy (as I'm sure it was) but it was undeniably DELICIOUS, in particular the ""lardo"", which consists of lard (pork, I believe) and herbs. It was the perfect spread for the warm ciabatta bread we were served. While eating this, I ordered a glass of Aragone Toscana wine, and my fiance ordered the Tritono Malbec.

- Beef Carpaccio: PERFECT cut of ""melt-in-your-mouth"" meat, with crostini on the side. I was so happy with it that it nearly brought tears to my eyes.

- Black Fettuccini: Pasta made with squid ink topped with a sauce made with crab, shallots and jalapenos. I have just one thing to say about this- TO DIE FOR.

- Osso Buco a la Milanese served with saffron orzo and gremolata: THE best osso buco I have ever had! The meat literally fell of the bone and it was seasoned perfectly!

- Dry Aged bone in ribeye steak: So... this is kind of pricey, but it is the most amazing steak I have ever had. It has a very unusual but outstandingly delicious taste. It is a pretty big serving, so I'd say it is worth every penny.

- Sides: Mascarpone and Guanciale mashed potatoes (mashed potatoes+mascarpone+ ""super"" egg= WHO KNEW?!?!?!) and fried polenta cakes. Both sides were fantastic!

We had a different type of wine paired with each of these dishes, recommended by our server. I highly suggest doing this when you are there. It will really add to your experience.

Desserts: 
- Hazelnut Semifreddo with fudge sauce
- caramel date fritter (with pistachios) with vanilla gelato
- Gelato trio (vanilla, espresso and mint stracciatella)
- fresh berry tart

ALL desserts were amazing!

We finished off with a digestif- my fiance had montenegro and I had Argiolas Mirto Tremontis.

The service, the ambiance.... spectacular. It will be hard to find a restaurant that even remotely compares to this place where I live in California. 

Until I am able to return to Carnevino, I will be daydreaming about it on a very regular basis. It was THAT good. Notice the repeated use of superlatives in my review? Trust me..... it's because Carnevino really is THAT good.",YCQvJY812RXJ_L1zYFJ5rA,1,0,5,uILDpBxPIjYnCeqSXqP6AQ

This place is pretty expensive so I hope that you are going after a strong dice roll at the tables! We started with  the grilled octopus and the Jamon plate... both were fantastic! We had a aperitif and then a glass of wine suggested by john the bartender. He also suggested a pasta before the steak, on one occasion we had the gnocchi and the other the raviolo which i thought the raviolo was much better.  We then had a masterpiece of steak slightly charred from a blazing oven, the dry aged bone in rib eye!  Absolutely mouth watering tender  with that amazing char broiled flavor!   One of the best Ive ever had , even though I was a little drunk by then! The next time we tried the filet and the new york strip .... both were good, but not the same as the rib eye. needless to say you will pay for the rib eye, but i would strongly suggest that if you were going to go there.

On a recent long weekend we decided to hit up Carnevino on Saturday night. So much on the menu looked tempting but we both ended up opting for the 8 oz. Filet Mignon. To compliment our steaks we chose two sauces, myself choosing the Porcini Bernaise which was THE perfect accompaniment to my tender and scrumptious steak. The steak was juicy and cooked perfectly! The sauce was not a thick consistency, I would liken it to a thicker au jus. For our sides we chose the Tuscan fries- made with fingerling potatoes roasted with parmesan and herbs and parmesan/potato cakes (I can't remember their name!)- mashed potatoes mixed with parmesan cheese and deep fried into a small yummy cake. So good!

After dinner we were full! BUT my friend wanted to see if they had an Olive Oil gelato she had had in Batali's NY restaurant. To her dismay they didn't. However, we asked our server (rather our server's assistant) and he took the extra step and put our request into the chef. To our surprise the chef accomodated our request! A few minutes later our server brought out our Olive Oil gelato. What yummy goodness! Smooth and sweet vanilla gelato, light and fruity olive oil and crushed sea salt. An unusual combination but so delicious! A must try! 

Our dinner overall was a great dining experience. The service was professional, friendly, attentive and courteous. The food was brought out timely, hot and delicious!

First tip - if you have the waiter who uses 2 initials as his name immediately ask the manager to be reseated. He was arrogent, rude, and visually rolled his eyes when what we were ordering apparently wasn't up to his standards. One member of our party, not a big meat eater, ordered the fish of the day and he sniffed ""maybe we should change our name to PesceVino"". Huh?

First complaint - we were a group of six and I ordered wine before the last two arrived. They appeared and then the wine came, one person didn't want wine, and instead of asking what she DID want he just walked away. After 15 minutes she finally went to the bar, ordered a drink and had it delivered to our table. (This isn't the good part yet.) When our waiter finally reappeared he looked at her drink and said ""you should have asked me, I'm here to serve you"" - well he wasn't there!! That's pretty much the sum total of the entire experience, every remark was ""whatever you want"" but then he wasn't around to actually do anything for us.

Avoid the pastas - they're tiny tiny tiny portions (not even adequate for a pasta course between courses) and Stouffers does better. They just really looked sad on the plates and tasted worse.

Steak was OK, but so non-memorable that I can't even tell you what cut I had.

We didn't mind though, because it was his first time there and the menu was just too appealing to limit ourselves to a prix fixe menu. 

Everything was out of this world amazing.  We started at the bar for a couple of cocktails before our reservation, and was not disappointed by the service and craftsmanship of the bartender.  He made my husband the perfect slightly dirty martini and myself a spot-on old fashioned.  

Once we sat, our server was incredibly energetic and attentive and suggested many great things for us to consider since it was my husband's first time.  We ended up starting with a half dozen oysters which were fresh and yummy.  We transitioned to a delicious salad - to which we asked to have the pancetta on the side, and they did not oblige (I don't eat pork).  But the moment they realized it had come out wrong, they had a corrected half order out before I could even blink an eye. 

We indulged in the ribeye for 2 and it was one of the best friggin pieces of meat I've had in a while.  I'm usually a New York type of gal - but this ribeye was so flavorful and juicy and did not disappoint.  We are usually inclined to order a potato and veggies with our steaks, but this time we ordered a pasta to accompany it and it was a really great pairing.  We also indulged in 2 desserts (I can't remember what they were...blame it on the cocktails and wine).  

Overall, this place is amazing across the board from service to food.  One thing that I will add is that we made a reservation and they first tried to seat us across the hall in their overflow room.  We pushed back on that, as the overflow room lacks charm and energy that is supposed to accompany a pricey Vegas Dinner.",42fKdiHSAtOjOrgOoKZPjA,0,0,4,FveoP-Rrdwqy41P4Ozu04Q

1230993,2009-07-30,0,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"Sensational dinner. Best birthday, ever. 

My fiance took me here for my birthday and being such a big Food Network fan, I couldn't wait to try a Mario Batali restaurant. We weren't disappointed. 

Our hostess invited us to sit at the bar as our table was promptly cleaned (we arrived a bit early) and we enjoyed the complimentary garlic, Parmesan bread sticks over a glass of wine and a wonderful Belgian beer. Our drinks were hand carried as we were escorted to our table, a little close to the horrid din of the casino, but that's unavoidable due to the location of the restaurant. 

Since we wanted to go all out, we order appetizers and salads, along with entrees and dessert. We really went for the real dining experience this place is intended to be, six or seven courses. The complimentary ciabbata was delicious, but I wasn't a fan of the bacon butter, fortunately there was an herb butter as well, which we completely polished off. We were also given a complimentary appetizer that I can only describe as a ciabatta ""popper"" which we found buttery and delicious. Our arugula and caprice salads were fresh and wonderful, also generous portions. Unfortunately, the shrimp pasta that we shared was extremely plain, the pasta was perfect quality and the shrimp very-well cooked, but it lacked an overall flavor. 

Now for the main course, we ordered the Rib-eye for two, a behemoth of meat, hand carved table-side and served with virgin olive oil and a choice of shared side. We had the potatoes and broccoli, very good. 

The rib-eye needs some explanation. For those of you who complained about the saltiness of the meat, you obviously aren't familiar with the process of dry aging meat, which involves the heavy salting and seasoning of a piece of meat, then hung at a certain temperature to extract all bacteria and infuse flavor at the same time. This leaves the meat with a salty, seasoned crust and a perfectly tender center. We got our steak medium-rare, which is exactly how to order a steak. It was incredible. The meat was the most tender I ever ate and far surpassed the quality at Mesa Grill (sorry Bobby Flay!). The salty crust does have a complexity beyond what some people have described in some Yelps below, but I assure you, it's a wonderfully prepared steak. Don't listen to the guy who recommended Outback Steakhouse instead... he obviously doesn't know anything about good food. 

Although stuffed, we still ordered dessert and shared carrot cake and flourless chocolate cake, both divine. The waiter also gave us a free dessert that I couldn't accurately describe. An amuse bouche style ""cookie"" of sorts that had a buttery flavor and warm, nutty crust, heavily spiced with nutmeg, cinnamon and all-spice, among many other flavors I couldn't isolate in the single bite that was provided. I wish it was on the menu, I could have eaten a whole plate. 

After that, our waiter handed us a $400 bill. While I'm not going here every week, I do recommend it for that special occasion, because it is very expensive, but sensational.

As soon as we sat down some prosecco was served.
We split some pasta dishes for appetizers and each one was just perfectly made. 

We then split the Flinstone's sized steak and it was more than enough for four of us.  Really.   This was the most enjoyable piece of meat I can remember.  Different pieces of it had different amounts of fat, marbling, texture.  It was wonderful.  It was expensive - but not if you divide by 4.

The wine list is obviously mostly Italian and mostly high-end.  The sommelier was great and she was well-versed in all the spirits as well.
They have a great cart with digestifs including a large grappa and amaro selection.  

The deserts were great.  The most memorable was a ""cheesecake"" which was thinner,  with some grapefruit sauce that was perfectly balanced and made this  a light fantastic desert.

The food was memorable.

1299596,2009-05-11,0,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"This is a Mario Batali restaurant in Vegas' Palazzo Hotel and Casino - it's right across the skybridge from the Wynn. We came here for my sister's birthday dinner and left stuffed.

Probably one of the more expensive places I've ever eaten at coming in at little over $100/person for a table of 7. I guess two bottles of $125 wine didn't help the matter =P Their somelier was really friendly, though. She did this whole presentation for priming the glasses for our wine by pouring a little into each GINORMOUS sized wine glass and rolling it around to clear it of polish, detergents, etc and to prep the glass with the smell of the wine. Did it help? I'll have to try primed/non-primed glasses at home to compare =P I didn't really notice that much of a difference, but I'm not a huge wine snob...

The restaurant's setting is decent - a sorta steakhouse feel right inside the Palazzo - but close enough to casion floor that you can still hear the sounds of slots. One look at the wine list and you sorta remember where you're at - wines from $100 - $5,000. Holy crap... haha.

Anyways, on our server's suggestion, we shared 2 appetizers with the table and each ordered our own entrees and some sides.

Complements of the Chef:
Fried Parmesean Balls - Just like it sounded... delicious =P On a side note, one of our Asian servers came up and pronounced the whole thing in fluent Italian. That was trippy... (*psst* Did he just speak Italian???)

Appetizers: 
Fresh Mozeralla over Toasted Bread - Pretty tasty stuff... but I was surprised when they brought out a huge slab of mozeralla and one tiny piece of bread. When the server described the plate, we thought each person would get a piece of bread... instead it was ONE regular sized piece of bread - we had to ask the server to cut it into seven for us =P
Grilled Octopus - Excellent - wonderful smokey flavor with a hint of spice to three clearly different parts of the octopus - tentacle, body, and a bit of ""carpaccio"" style octopus over a bed of greens and hot peppers. 

I ended up sharing the Ribeye with my brother-in-law. This must be ordered by 2 people and is $65/person. The presentation of the thing was pretty awesome. They come out with a huge plate with a ginormous slab of meat and bone, and after showing you, they trim the meat off and place the bone in front of you to tempt you... then they go and slice the meat into smaller portions so it's easier on you to cut and eat. I thought it was done really well - perfectly medium rare, tender, and a nice dry rub on the outside. I can't say it was THE BEST piece of meat I've ever had... especially at that price... but it was good.

My sister had their spaghetti ai fruti di mare and it looked amazing. HUGE prawns (head on), an entire lobster, crab... the works over spaghetti. Wish I had a bite =P

Sides:
Their sides come a la carte - so be careful! At $9 a pop, they add up, but the few we tried were pretty good.

Risotto Cake - Sorta like a crab cake, but stuffed with risotto. I enjoyed it... you get two large cakes.
Spinach with garlic and hot peppers - pretty tasty, but nothing super special.

We wanted the strawberry panna cotta for desert, but they ran out =(

In any case, it was a good dinner, but a little expensive. The wine was superb. The waiters were very helpful, if not a little overbearing... but I guess they try extra hard there. I'd go back to try some of their pastas... after winning big at the tables =P",TH_9hdtJX67bGgOcGrJ1Fw,0,0,3,ofomjR9CxLkE5EydkFaUbQ

1325090,2012-10-17,0,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"Their 9 month dry age steak is pure heaven. That steak alone makes Carnevino my favorite steak house above all others.

They only serve this gift from the gods a few months out of the year, and its not on the menu, I think the oldest on the menu is 3 months... pssht... 3 months, I have leftovers in my fridge older than that... 9 months is the money maker, I did ask if they had anything older... like 9 years, the waiter looked at me and said, ""no"". 

Anywhoo, back on track... So, just simply ask for their ""reserve"" steaks. I can't remember exactly, but i think this is only available Nov - Feb (or around that, give or take a month or 2). I went once in July and they only had about 5 months... /sigh /sadpanda

I would say all their other steaks are still good, and for me around the same quality as Mastro's, Alexanders, Morton's, Ruth Chris, STK, Delmonico, etc. but that 9 month dry aged is magical, so much flavor that I can't come to vegas and not go to this happiest place on earth. 

The best way to do this is to go in a group and order a few steaks, no all the dry aged unless you're just ballers (if you are btw, let's be friends) and share it family style, the steaks are pretty big, and of course pretty expensive (around $250 for the 9 months... yikes... company expensed dinner time... cha ching!). 

I haven't found anywhere else that dry ages steak as long as this place does, without you having to go to the hospital after, and although pricey, its worth every penny, the taste is unmatched.",9MRXO2Ulo4SS6sPgVc_86Q,1,0,5,oNf57MGXsh9EbvUzyAjLVw

Table for 9 guys.  We checked in for our 6:30 reservation, eyeing the bachelorette party table in the center of the main dining room.  We were ushered in unfortunately away from the girls, into the large back room.  We were greeted by a small army of wait staff, with a strange soundtrack of 70's porno music.

We took most of our waiter's recommendations for food.  Our sommelier was helpful in finding a couple bottles at the price point we wanted.  The wait staff was perfectly attentive making sure our wine glasses were filled and that our empty dishes were taken.

So the food.. The little cheese ball were a nice start, salty enough to get your mouth watering.  I topped my bread with the pork fat rosemary concoction.  My heart skipped a beat.  Wine was poured.  We had a bold Spanish red and a lighter Italian red for contrast.  The starters arrived.  The carpaccio salad was definitely the winner for the first round.  Honorable mentions go to the prosciutto and figs, caprese salad.  

Round 2, pastas.  The frutti de mare was deceptively plain-looking but tasted great.  I love it when food does that.  The squid-ink fettucine alfredo with crab was nice.  De-constructed with black noodles and the white crab/cheese was a nice look and tasted divine.  

Our wait staff army rolled out the tanks for round 3: the steaks.  Three or four cutting boards on wheels arrived and the army went to work cutting and plating our steaks.  Wow that was kind of impressive..  Jojo and I shared the porterhouse.  Nice of them to evenly distribute the NY and T-bone sections between both plates.  The thick cuts of steak were aged perfectly.   Though fairly rare in the middle, they weren't at all bloody and the flavor was very rich.

Ambiance - ambiance absolutely sucks. It's very obvious that they're not putting any money into upgrading the restaurant despite the high prices. The interior just looks old and outdated, music and lighting both sucked. Service was a little slow and mediocre. 

Just FYI, their appetizer prices are all range from $20-30, which can be considered entree prices in other restaurants. The prosciutto appetizer was mediocre, not even one of the best prosciutto that I've tried. Pastas overall were very tasty, but portion sizes are pretty small. 
Vegetable side dishes were very yummy. 

I've eaten at many steakhouses and I can honestly say their steaks are done very well. We ordered the dry aged porterhouse, rib eye, and lamb chops. All three were equally delicious and cooked amazingly, to a medium rare that ended up being slightly more on the rare side. The price is around $150 for a 2 person steak. 

We had a party of 7, and ended up paying around $100 a person at least, not including tax and tip. 

I would only recommend this place this place if you're prepared to blow a lot of money. Otherwise there are plenty of other places to get good steak, at much more reasonable prices.",z66b8mc8oErx2TCM8EQXsQ,0,0,3,-bZaGSB3BLEOjeUWyvfhVg

On second thought: we found it insulting.

We were in town for a weekend with couple friends, wanted elegant Italian, and got a strong recommendation from a local (cab driver).

Wine list, for which this place is famous, is absurdly pricey. Almost nothing under $100. (We got the ""last bottle""of a very average Tuscan blend, $65.)

Our wives split a thick-cut pork chop ($46). Forty-six dollars for one, unadorned chop served without sides or sauce. (Sauces for all meats run an extra $7. Yes - you pay extra for sauce.

The chop was unpalatably dry and reeked of cloves. 

I had a passable Osso Buco ($41) served on a paltry bed of flavorless risotto. 

My buddy had a seafood pasta, best entree of the three.

I'm going to keep this review short and simple:

Beef cheek ravioli:  This alone is enough reason to come here.  It's an off-menu item that should definitely be on the menu!  The pasta is cooked so perfectly as well while the beef cheek stuffing is so rich and flavorful.

Ribeye for Two:  We chose to have the ribeye cooked medium rare and it was cooked to perfection!  And with regards to seasoning and higher quality cuts of meat, less is definitely more.  They cut and serve the ribeye tableside while only finishing it off with a little bit of sea salt and olive oil to bring out the beef's natural flavors.

We shared a lot of food family style. Arugula and chopped salad were both excellent. The arugula salad has some type of pickled onions in it, making it super tasty. We had the grilled octopus, which was cooked absolutely perfectly, steak tartare and tuna carpaccio. All the apps were spot on. 

We shared 4 pastas for 8 of us and they were all good. The spaghetti frutti di Mare was fantastic. All the others, I felt, were too similar and not adequate enough in portion. I feel like a little bit more of them would have been more suitable. 

Then, we shared entrees. We had the lamb, which I didn't try but looked good, the porterhouse (amazing!), the salmon (which I found a little boring), the BBL New York (out of this world taste - so super herbaceous and so intense), Brussels sprouts (love the simple preparation). 

In terms of service... Hmmm. I'm torn. Our front service seemed absolutely ambivalent about his work there. He did a good job, but kinda seemed ""over it.""  The back waiter, on the other hand, was super nice. We were in one of the side rooms, which was a little disappointing because you want to be in the middle of the action. We had 4 bottles of wine for the table and both were a great pairing with the food. 

One last note: in the middle of the waiter's initial menu spiel, I accidentally spilled my $15 glass of wine that I got from the bar.  The waiter didn't refill it. It's subtle, and it isn't that we were in any way lacking for food or wine, but when you're spending $170/person to eat (which is what our bill came out to), I would expect that service point to be paid attention to.",0KueQxXgax9GlbZ0UNaGlg,2,4,4,3Ak34ra-htoLzp8im4eKRA

Steak was fantastic.  Grilled octopus was probably the best dish I've had all year.  But...

The service was really bad.  Epicly bad.  We were a party of 10, and the restaurant wasn't terribly crowded.  Odd stuff happened, like we couldn't place a drink order for way too long, some ordered drinks were never delivered, others took 30 minutes, dessert took forever, and just generally slow/poor/unattentive service.  All that would add up to ~3-4 stars in my book because the food was so good and I don't really care much about service.  But...

We decided to ask to lower the service tip from the stated mandate of 20% to 15% and walked through the generally poor service.  I'd say our tone was dissatisfied but respectful (15% is still a decent tip..).  Seemed like a reasonable ask.  The server hemmed and hawed for a while and wouldn't let us talk to their supervisor who was required for any adjustment, and kept leaving and coming back.  This took 15 minutes.  Then they called in security for some reason that's still beyond me.  Since we wanted to leave, I tried stating in plain English what we were saying:  ""Your service was bad (really bad).  If you need us to pay 20%, so be it.  We'll leave amazingly dissatisfied and never come back.  If you could adjust the bill slightly to 15% and listen to some of our issues, it would go a long way towards feeling like we were treated fairly.""  My tone at this point was frustrated but not aggressive.  The server didn't respond, but security immediately THREATENED TO TAKE ME TO JAIL!  JAIL!

Also, I was saddened that such minor and stupid mistakes can really screw a place up. I wish these so-called money-making chefs such as Mario Batali would keep a closer eye on their establishments. I want to like all his food, restaurants, regardless of the city it's located in or the type of cuisine he has chosen.

This is what I had:
1. Carne Cruda alla Piemontese - chopped to order steak tartar with raw mushrooms
- Is there any other way to make steak tartar besides doing it to order? 
- The steak was fresh and delicate. The only criticism I have on this is; I wish it had a tad bit of acidity. 
2. Shrimp ""alla Diavola"" - in the style of Calabria
- This was the biggest shrimp I have ever seen. 
- It was one big ass shrimp on a spicy and very delicious tomato sauce. 
- Had I known it was going to be one big ass shrimp, I would not have ordered it. As big shrimp tend to be tough and flavorless. The smaller ones are sweeter and juicier. 
- Plus it was fishy. 
3. Dry age Bone in Rib eye (for 2)
- This is what I came here for. 
- It arrived Flintstone-style and was cut table side, just the way I like it. 
- Perfectly cooked
- Smelled of what I imagine heaven smells like.
- Juicy, tender and melts in your mouth like butter
- Only complaint: I wish they did a better job cutting this beautiful piece of meat. The rib eye gods would not be happy.   It was slightly sloppy and did not have a very appetizing presentation once it was put on my plate. 
4. Sides:
- Mascarpone and guanciale mash potatoes: pretty good. Probably will forget about this after this blog is done. 
- Shelling beans with pancetta: not good, except for the large chunks of pancetta, which I could have had anywhere.",2pRaTqfRN11VIb4PZ1Djrg,0,0,3,EwT-ZynK-WvLBvgYs8fUqA

This was my first experience trying Dry Aged meat, and I did so on recommendation of the server.  I ordered the Dry Aged New York Strip because my friend didn't want to share the Bone In Ribeye with me.  It was flavorful enough not to require sauce, but wasn't anything special to me.  It's supposedly dry aged for three months or something, but that's definitely not necessary.

For the sides, we ordered the mashed potatoes, which featured a poached egg!  That's the first time I've had mashed potatoes prepared in that way, but it was so delicious! Definitely a must have.

The service was a little weird.  We ordered two glasses of wine, but enjoyed the wine so much we wanted the bottle.  Our server forgot about this and didn't come back to refill our glasses for most of the meal, so we ended up having to basically chug the rest of the wine.  Also, he crumbed our table with a spoon.  Is that normal?  Another thing was that we ordered flat water, which the busser confirmed when first refilling our glasses.  However, the second time he came around, he gave us sparkling water.

The gnocchi was good, though this is only my 2nd time having gnocchi so I don't know what's considered good or bad.

1489313,2014-04-06,2,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"Attention Meat Eaters!

First, logistics: FULL MENU AT THE BAR unlike many of the competing steakhouses in town. This makes it inexcusable for you to miss this place. No reservations--just plop down at the bar and go to town.

It saddens me to think that a meat lover would visit Vegas and not get an opportunity to try the riserva because they read some ridiculous reviews on Yelp. I was almost one of those people. I was even afraid after realizing how easy it was to get reservations here compared to other places which were full. But I listened to my gut and it didn't fail me. And since you don't need reservations at the bar, if you are in town more than a couple of days, just swing by every night to see if the riserva is available.

Cut and CraftSteak are frequently mentioned as having the best steak in town. I've never been so I won't even doubt that the overall experience and service is better. However, when in the land of excess, do something you cannot do elsewhere. I can eat imported Japanese wagyu where I live or buy 3-5 week dry aged or prime beef, give it a lovely smokiness with oak or hickory and make it taste as good as many steakhouses. But can you eat 280 day dry aged beef (the age on my visit) anywhere in this country??? No!

Some do not like the taste of dry aged meat. If you are one of those people, then your money is probably better spent at some other restaurant. BUT, if you are one of those that like the nuttiness and funkiness then come here. I repeat: you cannot get this kind of meat anywhere else in this country. I repeat: you can get basically the same cut of meat from almost any other restaurant at home. Most of these guys get their meat from Allen Brothers, Lobel, Pat Lafrieda or DeBragga. As an aside, the Miyazaki filet from DeBragga online is the 2nd best steak I've ever had. The riserva was #1.

Their regular steaks I believe are aged 60-90 days, twice the standard time. I do want to come back to see if this is noticeably different from a shorter time. Usually the funkiness really starts developing after  4-5 weeks.

I was here a couple of weeks ago on a Monday. I sat at the bar like I usually do. I was alone. This removes a lot of the problems with service that invariably occur. I got there around 7:30 pm. I asked if they had they had the riserva and I lucked out. Vegas baby!

Bartender also recommended the grilled octopus. I grew up eating octopus but in my later years didn't really enjoy it as much. Having said that, get this! Delicious. These are big chunks, meaty, tasty, not chewy at all, lovely texture and in some type of sweet balsamic reduction ... or something like that. Anyway, so good. Went well with my Negroni and vieux carre.

As for the steak? Freaking amazing. Got 1 inch worth which was maybe 12 oz of actual meat. This was more than enough. The meat is so heavy (not gristly fatty but an ""oily"" fatty) that you can't eat that much. Two could easily share the riserva ribeye but of course as a man, I ate it alone. Amazing. Best steak ever. Yes, it could have used a tiny bit more salt but the meat was the star. Not as funky and cheesy as I thought it would be but still more than your average steak. Very tender. Got mine medium rare and it was fantastic.

For those complaining about prices, this is the strip. Everything is overpriced. You want overpriced? Go to some of the other places and pay $34 per OUNCE of Japanese wagyu when you can get it back home for $20/ounce or buy it for $12.50. It's the same stuff you can get from DeBragga. But $108/inch cut of 280 day dry aged beef? Totally worth it.",Vz6dw0K_VJMmERTycQX1EQ,3,3,5,7rNDoCRn6G9oxTYWGKVWtw
1492366,2011-03-10,2,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"Chef Mario Batali should cringe that his name is associated with this restaurant. For Carnevino did not even deliver on the basics on our recent visit. 

First of all- this place has a high bar given all the talk about it and the prices that it charges. It was highly recommended to us so we decided to take our group there on our last night in Las Vegas. 

From the moment that we entered- the place was not up to a ""fine dining"" restaurant . . . .and trust me- I eat out alot. 

Our waiter had an attitude from the moment he walked over- wanting to know ""who was in charge"" and tossing menus and wine lists at us. We appointed a ""person in charge"" just because it seemed without it- nothing was going to move forward. 

Everything we asked for seemed to be an issue for this waiter. We wanted several appetizers to share for the table. He wanted to know exactly how many of each versus just figuring it out as a good waiter would. 

Two of us asked to split a steak and to have it sliced- he acted like it was huge imposition but we saw it being done at other tables in the place. 

Our wine sat unpoured on the back table until one from our group got up to pour the table some wine. Pouring our own wine? Really? At a fine dining restaurant? Unheard of. 

At this point- I called the manager over- but she was not very helpful other than getting our water glasses filled. I expected to her to minimally check back with us before we left to see if things had gotten any better.  But she didn't.  She didn't care either.

Our salads came up and were so bitter and salty that they were inedible so we sent them back. The pasta dish we ordered was no better than ""Chef Boyardee"". So far- service and the food were untenable for a fine dining restaurant. 

The best thing of the night? The steaks- but it takes a lot to mess those up. They were done perfectly and were quite tasty. But at $54 a steak- I would expect nothing less. 

This service debacle went on for 2.5 hours and at the end when we received our $1100 bill you can bet that the obligatory 20% tip for our server -who was terrible- was put right on there. Hard to believe.

There was no other compensation from the restaurant for the bad service other than they didn't charge us for the salads we didn't eat.

1496732,2011-10-01,0,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"The first meal of my recent trip to Vegas.  Located in a corner of the Palazzo, Carnevino is one of the restaurants owned by Mario Batali.  Overall, I enjoyed my meal and several items were memorable enough to consider a return visit on future trips.

After ordering my Italian beer, the waiter provided me with some fresh rosemary bread.  With the bread came a small dish of unsalted butter and pork back fat butter.  Wow, the pork back fat butter was so good, but you know it was so bad for you.  Hey, what happens in Vegas right?

I started the meal with the duck cannelloni.  I just can't pass up braised duck and this was a great start to my meal.  Be aware the pasta dishes are served as appetizer portions unless you tell the waiter you want this as an entree.  There were so many interesting pasta dishes on the menu that I really wish I could have sampled them all.

For my entree, I had the New York strip with an added Madagascar shrimp and side of mashed potatoes.  The steak was prepared to my expectation and had a good flavor.  The Madagascar shrimp came one to a plate, but it was huge.  I think the item that stood out the most from my main meal were the mashed potatoes.  They were served mixed with cheese and an Italian bacon.  The waiter suggested I add a egg on top, so I did.  It could have been breakfast potatoes with eggs & bacon.  Definitely worth a try.

Perusing the menu beforehand, KM and I were interested in the Beef Tasting Menu, but the very first thing the waiter told us when we sat down was that the tasting menu was only available if all five of us wanted it.  Since three folks didn't, KM and I were out of luck.  Our group ended up sharing a couple appetizers, sides, bottles of wine, and KM and I shared the bone in ribeye for two.

Our dishes included:
-- Bread with Lardo: This came to the table right away.  I wasn't particularly enamored with the lardo.  It has an interesting flavor but I would've preferred some olive oil.
-- Carne Cruda (steak tartare): Excellent preparation of steak tartare.  Exactly as it should be done.
-- Italian Brocolli with Smoked Pork: Pork makes everything better but even with the pork this dish just wasn't very exciting.
-- Mashed potatoes with Poached Egg: Very good, rich, and creamy.  I'll have to try to make this at home.

1516123,2014-10-23,0,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"The Caprese salad was delicious, my wife's beet carpaccio salad was delicious also. Everything was going really well until the waiter suggested shaved white truffles with our meal for an extra $100. We have dined in Florence, Italy during truffle season so we were very excited for the truffles, since we have such a strong positive memory of how those truffles tasted. 
We could not have been more disappointed. Might as well have taken a C-note and just lit it on fire. Waiter recommended truffles with the Raviolo, we could not smell or taste any truffles whatsoever. Not sure if this was because of the brown butter or not but we literally could not tell there were any truffles at all in our dish. And with just ricotta and egg inside, we should have smelled/tasted them. There was more flavor/aroma in the truffle vinaigrette on my wife's salad than there was in the ""fresh white truffles"" that were freshly shaved on our food.

Then came the steak, ribeye for two which was absolutely delicious and cooked perfectly. The texture and flavor of the meat was incredible. We had some fresh truffles shaved over our steak and at least we could smell them at that point, but not much flavor to be had from them.  We were very happy with the steak itself but not the truffle addition which did nothing at all for the steak what a waste.

We did get a bottle of wine which was overpriced but it was very good so mixed feelings there. Waiter was helpful in the beginning but as night went on was considerably less attentive and we felt his suggestion of truffles was a mistake, especially on the Raviolo. 

So do yourself a favor and skip the underwhelming white truffles, save yourself a hundred dollars and you will have a better experience. We have dined in Vegas a ton and have always had great truffle experiences, we were very disappointed about these, it really tainted the meal and the experience for us. I mean, chefs are supposed to be tasting the food, why would you sell your customers flavorless truffles at $20/gram with a 5 gram minimum? 

So bottom line, waitstaff were pretentious dicks, truffles are a huge scam.
Other than that we had a delightful experience and the food was above average quality. Prices are high but somewhat worth it since the food is very delicious.",xdCWXqq-db_KZ-5ZfehVuQ,0,0,3,Y-zwH6SVXIv4hU8kCDmnZQ

But again, not bland at all. If you like italian, youd be fond of everything else. In my humble opinion, it is not our preferance; The spinach is very garlic-ee' and has a strong ""Veggie"" ""greens"" taste. The potatoes had a great ""parmessan like"" crumb crust on them, very tasty- just the type of potatoes used wouldnt be my first choice, but taste wise they are okay. Very pricey for lunch, maybe for dinner it would have been more reasonable. We loved the sparkling water of choice- DELICIOUS! and we even got an extra bottle free- two thumbs up and extra points for that because we were super thirsty!!! lol

1534225,2018-04-25,0,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"My family went to this restaurant to celebrate my father's eightieth birthday because he is a big fan of good beef.  We were prepared to pay top dollars for a good meal.  The whole dining experience was so annoying that I felt horrible being responsible for selecting this place for the occasion.

We called the restaurant to ask if they can arrange for a birthday cake.  There were some food allergies and the person answering said it would be easier to bring our own.  We specifically asked if there is a cake cutting fee and were told there wasn't one.  When we showed up with the cake, the waiter informed us there would be a cake cutting fee.  We explained about the phone call and he reluctantly stored the cake for us after giving us a hard time.

We arrived early in the evening because the guest of honor was from the east coast. The back dining room was empty at the time except for our table of 10.  The restaurant was playing some rock and roll music obnoxiously loud.  We asked the waiter to turn the music down or switch it to something more pleasant. We were told that they could not adjust the volume of the music and that when more guests arrive, it would get noisy anyways.  When everyone has to yell over one another on an open dining room, of course it gets loud.  And guess what, having loud rock and roll as a baseline would not help the ambience.  

Next comes the bread.  This restaurant is SOOO selective of their supplier they do not even know if there was dairy in the bread!

We were encouraged to share the meat.  Supposedly the portions were big enough for two.  I can definitely say that no one was stuffed when we ordered a bunch of appetizers, 4 steaks, lamb chops, two pasta dishes, plus 5 or 6 side dishes for 7 adults and 3 kids.  The waiter assured us there was sufficient food for everyone when he took our order. I don't know what kind of diners would prefer have too little food on a celebratory occasion.  Maybe we looked too skinny or too stingy, but I expect waiters in classy restaurants to give good advice about their food.

The pasta portions were so small that my 8 year old ate the thing in a few bites.  My brother in law was too polite to complain, but what was not enough for the kid would not fill an adult.  My 12 year-old niece ordered a steak plain because she has allergies.  The wait staff ended up giving the plain steak to the wrong person.  We also ordered some sides done without sauce and those also ended up on the wrong side of the table.  

The other problem was that the food was SLOW.  We would have ordered seconds, except waiting another 45 minutes in an increasingly noisy room would just add the the annoyance.

It was supposed to be a joyous occasion.  No one in our party had a good time at Carnevino.   Safe to say that we won't be going back.",vkG4n3qzfRQ-xqH0pk_aDw,1,0,1,OPCY4CZeYEGUYEGNqM9n-A
1539434,2015-12-23,0,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"We started with a seared scallop antipasti, which was amazing. The scallops were impeccably fresh and cooked to perfection. We followed with a white truffle pasta and Garganelli with porcini trifoliate. The truffle pasta was simply prepared, which allowed the truffles to shine through. We ended with La Fiorentina--the porterhouse for two (see photo)--with porcini bernaise sauce. It might be the best steak I've ever eaten. Perfectly seasoned and cooked just right. It was tender, juicy, and intensely flavorful.

So why am I subtracting one point? Mainly because of the wine service. The list is extensive but stratospheric in price. There are very few bottles priced under $100. The markup is steep. To cite but one example, the Antinori ""Tignanello"" 2011 is listed at $260 but I can get it at K&L Wines here in LA for $85, which equals a 3x retail markup. Anticipating this problem, I took a bottle from my cellar, only to be faced with a very steep $50 corkage fee. Turning from price to service, they took my bottle away to open it somewhere out of sight (why?). They brought it back and placed it at the farthest away point on the table so that we couldn't reach the bottle without getting up, hence leaving the pouring in the wait staff's hands. 

This is a pet peeve of mine. As Christopher Hitchens put it, this ""breathtaking act of rudeness ... conveys a none-too-subtle and mercenary message: Hurry up and order another bottle.""

I brought it. It's my bottle. I should decide when and how quickly it gets poured.",g5y90qu7pZusdEZEn1NFYg,0,0,4,5_Z6WwS0M_uUmUyTXxoEbg

Went there for dinner with my mother a week or so ago while in Las Vegas for a convention.  She had been there before and enjoyed it.  Not this time.  Something has gone wrong in the back of the house.

We orered the pasta with truffles to share as a starter.  The dish had no flavor of truffles whatsoever.  It used a dried truffle which might as well have been colored pieces of construction paper for all the flavor they held.  

For an entree, I had tuna tartare with Meyer lemon.  Again, total lack of flavor.  I cook with Meyer lemons quite a bit and this dish had not even a scent of this fruit.  The tuna was nicely presented, but again, lacking in flavor.  

Service was friendly but very slow.  For the number of servers around with nothing to do, it should have been much better.  The restaurant was not busy.

It seems this restaurant has either changed who does the cooking or is trying to maximize profit so much that they have forgone flavor.  For the prices they charge, the quality of the meal should be MUCH BETTER.

I've been here 3 times and my favorites are:

Carpaccio with arugula appetizer
Porterhouse for 2
Bucatini pasta
The wine pour with giant lead crystal glasses

The carpaccio was perfect in taste, texture and size.  My girlfriend had a shrimp bigger than her hand! My favorite pasta is the Bucatini All'amatriciana, which I've had before at Lupa in NYC - my other favorite restaurant.  At Carnevino the pasta is priced as an appetizer size so you can get your fill without over doing it.  

We ordered not the most expensive bottle of wine, but still the server poured our wine in the coolest way I've experienced:  He presented very large lead crystal glasses that he said were custom made in Czechoslovakia. He then proceeded to pour a small amount in one glass, swirl it around, then pour the same wine into the remaining glasses.  Because of the lead crystal, all the glasses glowed with a red hue!  The smell of the glasses was amazing.  Finally, he poured a serving into each glass.  Even though we selected a cheaper bottle of wine, the service was a nice touch and the wine tasted (and smelled) amazing.  

Now for the best part - the porterhouse for 2 arrives on a cart and is carved table side.  The portions easily would feed 4 people if that was all they ate.  We were a table of 3 and still took leftover steak home.  The quality of the meat was perfect (I eat a lot of steak) and the preparation was as simple as salt, pepper and olive oil.

It's dark with cavernous ceilings dropping shadows that mock the dim lighting, cloaking rich mahogany in an effortless nod at a rustically simple and rich elegance. 
The wine list boasts a huge variety of conquests spanning nations and vineyards, and despite the extraordinary mark up let's face it, if you're eating here...in Vegas...you may as well sell out. You'll win it back later anyway, right? 
It's the infamous ribeye-for-two you are here, a gargantuan cut of meat that is brought before you in its fresh and blood-red marbled glory, like some pagan god of carnivores to taunt and tease your eager eyes. After you order it medium rare (and no other way) the beast is brought back out to be slaughtered and cleaved and hacked apart, crisp edges roasted black and that deeply savory, fat-melting, perfectly salted flavor of a damn good steak unrolls into the air around you. Plate after plate of beef is set before your party and its bounty yields surprisingly more than you expected. Plunge your fork into the crusted end bits, that is surrounded by an almost charred, crackling sear courageously protecting a soft, shy pink center. When that slight taste of roasted meat and salt, of blood and hot, crackling, buttery fat has covered your mouth give into the temptation to grab one of the huge bones laid out before you. You'll start off shaving off slices of meat closest to the bone but in that heady euphoria of cut and eat you'll end up roasted bone in hand, gnawing at the monster, the way you secretly always knew it was going to end up. Go ahead and toast your friend sitting across from you with the bone, you don't have to say anything, you both know exactly what you're toasting to.
It's not just the steak that is good here, the lamb chops are just as amazing, with a heady and smoky flavor, incredibly tender and larger than the petite, runty chops you find at your supermarket. The potatoes are surprisingly delicious, a welcome respite with a crispy skin that when bitten, easily yields to unleash heavy scents of rosemary and garlic.

We came here with a group of 7. The GM came out and personally greeted us at the hostess stand when he heard our party had arrived. They had a beautiful table set up all the way in the back of the restaurant (through the wine cellar room, which I thought would have been a cool place to sit as well). With very high ceilings and paintings on the wall, the back room felt like we were in someone's old world castle. It was quiet, romantic and I loved the ambiance. Needless to say, service was absolutely impeccable. 

Some of us started with bellinis. The chef also sent out some complimentary apertifs. Our food order was massive:

Appetizers:
-Caprese salad
-Stracciatela (proscuitto and mozz)
-Grilled octopus served over octopus sashimi (my FAVORITE, the grilled octopus really was perfectly prepared and so tender)
-Steamed clams (the broth was soooo amazing)
-Lobster with the tail served sashimi style

Pasta:
-Garganelle bolognese (Because I was craving some sort of spicy pasta I requested the bolognese sauce to be made spicy and the chef added a very nice amount of heat)
-Orrechiette 
-Beef agnolotti

Entrees:
-Dry aged bone-in ribeye (for 2 people) this thing was massive, I will upload a pic. We took the gigantic bone home for my Mom's teacup malteses. So spoiled.
-Filet mignon
-Lamb chops
-Bison (available on their special menu)
*Note that the meat prepared at Carnevino is prepared a little less than requested. For example, if you request medium rare, it will come out closer to rare.

Sides:
-Spinach
-Mashed potatoes
-Butternut squash
-Cauliflower gratin
-Porcini mushrooms

Before we sat at our table we had a nice glass of prosecco at the bar with a very affable bartender - it looked like we were in for a great night...until we got seated with a server who was part used car salesman part annoying high school substitute teacher.  This guy proceeded to go through and lecture us on the menu for literally 10 minutes...we can read guy and we get it you want us to order the most expensive steak you offer.  This server (I use this term very loosely because we didn't get his name) proceeded to tell us that we shouldn't consider the filet or the fish dishes (really, Batali puts items on his menu that aren't good?) and that the sides aren't like Ruth Chris ""you can't just order them"" - what does that even mean?  So after mentioning that they keep many of the items in Italian to encourage ""a dialogue"" we knew that this was one strange place.  
The night before my vegetarian friend suggested I get the buccatini without the pork and she recommended I get the small size, which is literally enough for one person but I should have been tipped off when they said they'll try and push the big size.  OK I'm a vegetarian and even though I'm going to a place called Meat & Wine I'm allowed to be there and eat what I like.  So after asking for the buccatini sans pork he looked and me and said he wouldn't do it...""if we start taking things out of our dishes it'll just get strange and I don't want to put a plate of strange in front of you.""  I'll be the judge of strange buddy and don't bs me because my friend ordered it last night.  HE WOULDN'T TAKE MY ORDER AND SAID ""I'LL COME BACK TO YOU!""  What happened to the ""dialogue"" he promised earlier?  Needless to say he hassled everyone of my friends about our orders saying zingers like ""that's just 5 bites and won't be enough"" ""you have to get all of your orders in now because it'll just get awkward if you want more food later.""  After we ordered we all decided to leave because we were made to feel so uncomfortable - these servers must be working on commission. 
I spoke to the matre'd on the way out who to his credit was very apologetic and flabbergasted the waiter wouldn't adhere to my vegetarian request.  He offered to seat us in another section - we just wanted to get out of this boiler room so he paid for our drinks.

In addition to getting food poisoning at 5 am, the server we had was incredibly rude and impatient. It seemed like every question we had about the menu annoyed him. Benefit of the doubt, maybe he was just having a bad day, maybe he had already put in his two weeks and didn't give a crap anymore, but regardless it reflects poorly on the restaurant. 

My mother's first language isn't English, but her English isn't bad by any means. The menu said ""salmon skin"" and she asked the waiter ""what do you mean salmon skin?"" and the waiter was like ""SKIN. LIKE THE SKIN ON YOUR ARM."" and she was like ""skin?"" and he was like ""SKIIIIIN!!! IT'S SKIN!!! *rubs furiously on his arm*"". Obviously she knows what skin is but all she was asking was if it was JUST the skin (because you know how fancy restaurants like to be creative and use unique ingredients), to which he finally explained that it was both the salmon + skin. I was appalled by 1) how he was speaking to my mother, 2) the lack of patience and understanding from the get-go since the whole situation literally lasted less than 10 seconds (sorrrrryyyy the hostess seated us in your waiting area and we took up soooo much of your time). Given that the menu itself labels the dish only as ""salmon skin,"" even I - as a native English speaker - would have made the same mistake of assuming it's just the skin.

For the food, we got the chicken, arugula salad, salmon skin AKA salmon + skin lol, and the garganelli pasta. The pasta was undercooked but everything else tasted like you'd expect, nothing mind-blowing.

CarneVino makes eating steak a stuffy experience, without backing it up with amazing food. You're required to eat the meal the way the Chef wants, without regard for your own personal preferences.  Unacceptable.  I appreciate Chef suggestions, but in the end it's my meal.

Paulo made the arrangements for us and our friends visiting from the east coast, and we felt very special by the pampered treatment, beginning with beautiful glasses of prosecco to complimentary tidbits.  We tried a wide assortment of dishes, and some of my favorites were the grilled octopus that was so flavorful and tender.  The scallops were gorgeous, and the moscato poached pears were devine!  Subtle sweetness combined with a delicate prosciutto - very nice!

For our next course we opted for a few pastas.  I love that the menu is seasonal, and the pumpkin tortelli was done so elegantly.  Of course we had to order some of their famous beef, which was succulent, tender, and oh-so-tasty.  Carved table side, it's a wonderful part of the overall experience.  I had dreams of the guanciale mashed potatoes, and so there was no way I was going to miss those with the quail egg cracked open table side and gently stirred in, they are luscious!

We mentioned the issue but no comment was made by our waiter when he came to the table again eventually to ask if everything was all right. The entrees were delicious. The roasted beets amazing.

Our waiter was attentive and helpful with the menu.  The music was VERY loud (and I enjoy a restaurant with music and a lively vibe) but we literally had to yell at one another- but what made it worse was the music itself - it was heavy metal with copius amounts of screeching and truly made eating there unnerving. When we asked if they could change the music or turn it down the manager said the playlist is dictated from Mario himself and if he changed it or turned it down he could be fired.  Clearly Mario has an interesting bend to his music but forcing it onto his patrons in a way that just makes you want to get up and run rather than stay and enjoy the food seems like a poor choice.

While I am not a big fan of Las Vegas restaurants, Mario Batali's Carnevino definitely excels at putting out great meat dishes.  We had several of their meat offerings including the bone-in New York Strip and the veal chop and both were very good.

The bone-in New York Strip was a thick cut and it had a great crispy outside sear, which was flavorful.  The meat was very tender.  It was undercooked at rare, but it still had a good flavor (and was of course moist).

The veal chop was better.  It was also very thick, but it was cooked more appropriately.  Veal chops should be between medium rare and medium and this one was.  The meat was moist and tender while the outside crust was distinct and flavorful.  Veal can often be a tad bland, but this one had a good flavor.  This was probably the best veal chop I have ever had.

The lamb chops were just okay.  Unlike the other meats, the lamb chops were not that thick.  They were a tad overcooked and while they did have a decent flavor and were tender, they were just not as juicy as they should have been.  Also, the outside crust was not as good as the veal or the New York Strip.

We had two other dishes that were also very good.  One was their grilled octopus.  I've heard Batali's grilled octopus at Osteria Mozza is very good.  This one was exceptional.  The octopus was very soft (which can be difficult with octopus) and it had a great flavor.  There were some good pickled vegetables on the side and maybe something else like prosciutto to give it a nice savory flavor.

I have not enjoyed many of Batali's pastas, but I did like his lobster anolini.  The lobster filled ravioli was very good--moist with a great lobster flavor.  The cream sauce was mixed with tarragon and it was flavorful and fragrant without being overly buttery or rich.

Most of the other items were in the just okay range.  The arugula salad featured a triple cream, but the triple cream was surprisingly dry and a little hard.  The bruschetta was okay (as was the big eye tuna crudo).

We had the pappardelle with porcini mushrooms and while the pasta sheets were good, the pasta went cold quickly.  It was also a little bland.  I was expecting the braised pork agnolotti to have a more impactful filling, but it was not as moist or savory as I was hoping for.  The garnish of chanterelles was good though.  There was a little bit of butternut squash on the plate, but it did not provide the sweet flavor I was expecting.

Most of the sides were just okay (like the spinach and the roasted beets), but the mashed potatoes with mascarpone and a poached egg were rich, creamy and quite good.

I had the flourless chocolate cake for dessert and it was okay.  I am not the biggest fan of flourless chocolate cake because it can be too dry.  While it was a little bit dry, it had a good (but maybe not great) chocolate flavor.

Service was good.  The staff was attentive and the food came out at a good pace.

Prices were high (which is common in Las Vegas), but when you share several of their dishes (family style), you might be able to save a little bit of money.

Carnevino has very high ceilings and a loud atmosphere.  The place has the look of other expensive steakhouses--kind of masculine looking with lots of dark browns.

The meat at Carnevino is very good and it is up there with some of the best a la carte steakhouses I've tried.  I am not the biggest fan of these steakhouses, but Carnevino is one of the better ones and they even have a few other good things (like the lobster ravioli) to balance out the meal.

Speaking of celebrity chefs, why does the food they prepare taste always better on TV? I digress.

USDA ""Prime"" beef is the top level of the USDA grading scale, followed by ""Choice"" and then ""Select"".  But within these categories are 2 or 3 sub-categories. Carnevino places their own inspector on the line at the beef-processing plant. He hand-selects the very best ""Prime"" at the exact moment that it is being graded - so when you eat a steak here you are getting the prime of the prime.

The sides and starters are idyllic, and the service impeccable. For the main event, we had the 5-course beef tasting. The 90-120 day dry aging process of their steaks is over-the-top. Chopped steak tartare, baby artichokes and parmigiano, veal pasta with ricotta, melt-in-your-mouth Beef Cheek, and the not-soon-to-be-forgotten: Bone-In Rib Eye Steak.

Lard on bread is a favorite of mine so I enjoyed that decently well. That is a problem. The best steakhouses make sure that you never say their food is just 'decent'. 

Additionally the service was a bit off that evening, as it was uncertain as to which waiter was working our table at times, meaning that every minute, another waiter would come to the table and ask if anything was required, and wasn't the food -ever-so-good---way too aggressive in the service particularly for a restaurant where you should be left to eat and savor the meal. 

The servers also talked about the food's background a little bit too much- i would prefer it being left to the diner to enjoy their food and if they have questions about the prep or ingredients, they can ask. As it was I felt like the server was halfway clubbing me over the head with how GREAT their food was, emphasis on the great was obvious every time they asked.

We were seated in near the wall, right underneath a speaker, which was very loud.  When we asked the hostess if they could turn the music down, she immediately brought over the manager who apologized for the music but explained that the volume couldn't be lowered but that he would gladly move us to another room.  The next room, the wine room, was much smaller, quieter and more intimate.  The wait staff was extremely knowledgeable about all the dishes and could explain everything without having to refer to the menu.  

We started out with a shared pasta plate of Garganelli Bolognese.  The pasta is similar to a penne, and the Bolognese sauce was divine.  I'm Italian and grew up eating all kinds of pasta with homemade ""gravy"" and this was the 2nd best dish of pasta I had ever had in my entire life.  The best was a few years ago in a hole in the wall place in Venice.  If this wasn't a steak restaurant, I would have had an entire dish of that pasta.

We ordered the rib eye for 2, cooked medium rare, with a side of Mascarpone & Guanciale Mashed Potatoes.  The steak, dry-aged in house for 90 days, was cooked perfectly and they sliced it tableside off the bone.  Before serving, they sprinkled some sea salt and drizzled each dish with a limited edition virgin olive oil.  I wish we weren't 3,000 miles away because my dog would have LOVED to have that bone.  It was at least a foot long.  The potatoes came with a poached egg on top (I missed that part of the description or I probably wouldn't have ordered them) and the server broke the egg and mixed it in.  I was horrified, but it was fantastic!  The egg and the mascarpone gave the potatoes a heavenly richness that I've never tasted before.  Guanciale is a pork jowl bacon and it really brought the potatoes to a higher level.   

This is a high-end steakhouse, but WELL worth the price.  I wish there were one here in NYC.",EDcd_-t8bhyyey27z47Wxw,0,0,5,TbMc5dW08zPYZ2XWHkw0kg

1751603,2010-09-08,0,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"Went there for a celebration dinner over the Labor Day weekend and glad we did!

Mario Batali is an amazing chef, I try to keep track of all the shows he does on TV, even get inspiration for my own cooking from him (never copy). We sort of stumbled on the restaurant while walking around Palazzo and Venetian and immediately I wanted to go, after changing into the best clothes we brought with us, of course! 

So, we went in with a feeling of honor and excitement and very high expectations. And, boy, were they met! Their service was amazing, at first we thought 4 or 5 people were waiting just exclusively on us, but than asked and turns out they all work as a team and keep an eye on all the tables and don't let a dirty plate or an empty glass go without notice, everything is cleaned up and refilled momentarily!!!

Now the food. Oh the food! I decided not to worry about my waistline and talked my companion out of any guilty feelings he may have had! We ordered  Insalata Caprese to share, and a bottle of Sicilian wine (their wine list is just unfair, it takes up 2.5 pages on huge menu sheets!). 

While we waited for the main courses, someone brought freshly whipped butter and a lardo with rosemary spread with warm chiabata rolls Then came duck liver pasta and gnocchi with gorgonzola and nut sprinkled  beets and baby broccoli with pork (only sure about half of the dishes, the ones I ordered). It all looked and smelled delicious! Like a childhood memory I've never had! 

We also ordered desert, which I did not have room for, but tried a bit anyway, looked fabulous! 

Not something we would do every day, the bill came to about $100 per person, but it is so worth it!",GSmWLuRCn47Q1iy7xRc45A,0,0,5,15UeeWx66WkhaWd_Uo-JPQ

1768059,2015-11-30,0,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"Overall, we had a terrible experience here.  My husband and his colleagues were in Vegas recently for a conference and I tagged along.  We had a group of approx 10 of us for lunch, the restaurant being about 30% full at the time we sat down.  First, they gave us 1 lunch menu, and 6 dinner menus, so we spent the first 15-20 min sharing menus, and then trying to flag a waitress down to try to get more menus.  Once we flagged a waitress down, we were told that they had run out of menus, so would not be able to give us more....when the restaurant was only 30% full?  

Anyway, in general, the service was really slow.  Multiple times we were trying to flag down a waitress, whether to order, or to try to ask for something.  When we asked for a few more minutes to decide on our order (due to the lack of menus), the waitress didn't come back for over 20 minutes.  Fiinally we were able to order our food.  The food was only OK - not great. Food wasn't bad tasting, but definitely not impressed, and the timing of delivery was awful.  Two of us had ordered side dishes to go with our meal, and the side dishes did not even arrive to our table until after all of us had finished our meals.  

Then we asked for separate checks, and we were told that it would take over 30 minutes for this to happen.  So we waited - and it literally took over 30 minutes to get our bills taken care of.  Overall our lunch took over 2 hours.  We attempted to speak to the manager regarding our displeasure with the overall service, and the manager did not ever apologize, and just made excuses, including which ""we had a lot of customers and we were very busy when you arrived.""  The restaurant was never more than 30-35% full the whole time we were there, so that is just inexcusable.

1848763,2009-08-24,0,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"A group of friends and I went to Las Vegas this weekend for a bachelor party and we had dinner at Carnevino.  We had never been and we were looking forward to some great steaks.  The place is pretty impressive overall and nice looking.  Our initial waiter was very nice and helpful but after that things didn't go so well.  It took a very long time for our waiter to come back and actually take our order.  After he did, we got our appetizers but none were placed in front of the correct people.  One of my friends actually had three appetizers placed in front of him before he had to tell them what he had ordered.  You could tell that the people bringing out the food had no idea.

When the main meal came out, one of my friend's steaks was never ordered or delivered.  The manager came out and apologized but it wasn't ideal when everyone else was eating.  A side course that was ordered was forgotten as well.  We ordered some side sauces for the steak and when those were brought out we asked which sauces they were but they had no idea so had to go back into the kitchen.  Then I was told by two people that it was the correct sauce that I ordered but I could tell it wasn't and another server came out and told me that it was indeed the incorrect one.

I called for the manager David and explained the situation and he was apologetic and gave us a free round of shots and didn't make us pay for the steak that was delivered late.  It was a nice gesture but too late at that point.

For an expensive steak place in Vegas you would think that we would be receiving the best service but that was not the case at all so I highly recommend finding one of the million other restaurants in Vegas to go to.",lxOcZ1VZ58nSCFgcunecjw,0,0,1,GOMTeKNGuO4k2bszCQhMzg

1858339,2010-07-21,0,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"IMPORTANT:  This review is for lovers of wine and restaurant professionals!

Let me say 1st....  I'm giving this place one star because its not in touch with reality.  And I say this as a restaurant manager and sommelier.

As for Service...5 Star all the way, my server was awesome...congenial, intuitive...just plain awesome.  But this review is not about service.  Don't fear, you're gonna love the servers.

But here's the deal - In this economy where you often hear how Vegas is struggling with tourism, you'd think someone might catch on and create a restaurant program that would attract repeat business.  And this is not the case.

We came into town with 2 great restaurants on our mind, but both were closed the only day we were there.  I heard about this place from our concierge and figured it was worth a shot.

The menu is outrageously priced...even for what you get.

The menu, as was amply stated by the staff, is designed where the appetizers are very small so as to sample many.  However, the apps are all pretty much 20 to 30 dollars a plate...for about 4 ounces of pasta in sauce...wtf.

The steaks are hefty in price, but well worth it...kind of.

However, if you are dining here for wine, BE FOREWARNED....IT IS MOLTO EXPENSIVE!!!

As a som, I often peruse the list for the best possible value for the price.  That said, as a Som, I often know the wholesale price for an item. And this place is way overpriced....ENORMOUSLY OVERPRICED.  A bottle that I purchased in my hometown of N.O., LA for 75 is 175 on the menu here.  The wholesale price is almost the same, but their cost percentage on MOST wines by the bottle is around 10 to 15%, not the average 33% you'd expect...not even from some Iron Chef.

Not only that, but the restaurant is completely taken over by the air freshener the casino pumps in to mask the smoke smell, so even as we tried to savor our Gaja Promis, I could most often smell the cheap smell of the casino from the open air dining room setting.

Let's say that its time for restaurateurs in Vegas to start modeling their business model on capturing repeat business while offering great bang for the buck.

I'm posting a 1 star to bring this average down because it is sorely needed.

If you're on a bachelor party and want to just empty your pockets without thinking about what you're actually getting for the price...this is a 5 star place.

If you want a quality experience where even OUR benjamins go far, roll that bad boy up and use it light a cigar elsewhere, cause you're gonna get screwed.",SD_aLZ7arpzZWvjI1N2jSA,3,1,1,AqGLFP9uDuOOOb0nPUz0Zg

I started with the gnocchi, lite, perfectly cooked, my wife the caprese, large cherry tomatoes on the vine with house made mozzarella and basil pesto, excellent. Entree was the dry aged bone in ribeye. Aged 90 days (don't know who else does that, typically 28-32 days). Asked for medium rare at 130 degrees, came out perfectly. Carved table side, this is around 50 ozs precooked. Absolutely one of the best pieces of beef we've ever eaten. Side was mascarpone, guanciale mashed which is topped with a poached egg! Excellent but unnecessary. Service was top notch, professional, attentive but not intrusive. My only complaint is the wine list is almost too extensive. It's massive and in my opinion, unnecessarily complicated. Some have complained about the music but we found it fine, a non issue.

We enjoyed:
- Ian (our Server's assistant) he was AWESOME and favorite part of Carnevino
- Peanut Butter/Chocolate dessert that was like a huge candybar ... yum!
- Ian because he was so awesome he is worth mentioning twice
- Zachs Chopped Salad which was very good and a great start to our meal

We were indifferent to:
- Our entrees of a steak dish and scallops. Eh pretty boring.
- Beef Agnolotti with onion ragu

We hated:
- The layout is awkward and tables are far too close, luckily there are loud speakers playing music right. By. Your. Head. So you really can't hear anyone elses conversations (or your own)
- Bread, butter, lardo - not as exciting as we thought based on reviews from others

We shared a salad and a pasta starter, then each got our own entrees. It was the perfect amount of food. The salad being a bit larger and more than enough to share. The pasta was smaller with only 4 or 5 bites per person, but enough for us on that particular night.

- my veal cutlets were pounded nice and thing, but not anywhere as tender as I would have expected

- was told everything here was cooked a little more rare, which was misleading as my fiancee ordered her filet medium and it came out way overcooked, while my friends' ribeye was ordered med rare and it came out as just that

I say good, because they are attentive, however they are all about an upsale. If you work in the industry this is a cookie cutter restaurant in the sense that they do everything other restaurants shy away from.  I.e. Trying to concentrate on the sale rather than the service. You should feel out the guests before trying to upsale 6 unnecessary overpriced sides.  The wind was marked up 2.8 times retail value so it's probably a solid 3 times over their cost.  I understand that this is near the standard, but come on I just left the Ritz Carlton with half that markup.  I believe that the mindset is on larger parties at this location is that it's probably going to be expenses on a company so why not.

Service- great service, waiter is attentive and very friendly and helpful
Menu- I felt it was a little limited, even for just a ""steak house"" but they options they did have were superb.
Steak- Order the porterhouse for 2, to compare with ones i've had in NYC.  Steaks are dry aged for 3 months, and you can tell.  It was super tender and the flavor was good, but the extended dry adds another level of flavor, almost a sweetness, that I could do without. I personally prefer just the taste of the beef.  If you've ever had chinese dried sausage, it has that kind of sweetness at the end. It also wasn't as juicy as I am accustomed to for a porterhouse, but it was a very good piece of meat.

Check out the Lobster, you can have it broiled w/butter, or sashimi style, we chose the sashimi, HEAVEN!!!

DO pasta, naturally, it's Batali afterall.  There are 1/2 orders available so you can sample a little bit of everything.  I LOVE that.  We tried the fettucine dyed with REAL black squid ink, yum, nice pop in flavor, but the Stracotto was AWESOME, duck liver ravioli, can't go wrong with that. 

The filet was pretty darn good, and at $39 for an 8oz steak, not bad, for Vegas.

1913307,2014-04-02,5,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"I am really baffled by all the hate for Carnevino in the reviews. I first came here about 5 years ago when I cam to vacation in Las Vegas and have been back probably 10-15 times since I moved to Las Vegas. I always go when people are in from out of town and want a good steak place so I have been with about 20-30 different people. Never have any of us gotten a bad item, had bad service, or not loved it. I am a unapologetic fine dining snob and until Gordon Ramsay Steak opened this was my favorite steak restaurant in Vegas- and for the steak itself it is probably slightly better than GRK (GRK has better non steak dishes and desserts). I can't wait for someone else to visit so I can try the new beef tasting menu. 

The restaurant comes from Mario Batali (orange crocs) and Joe Bastianich (the mean judge on amster chef). If you have been to any of their other restaurants Carnevino is similar in many regards- formal fine dining atmosphere, similar slowly paced service, the waitstaff likes to talk etc. This isn't for everyone- some people just want to order their food and have it delivered in less than 10 minutes without a lecture on Italian after dinner drinks (Grappa by the way is an acquired taste- I almost gagged the first time I had it but now I love it). If you do go to Carnevino give yourself at least two hours and have a backup liver waiting for transplant. 

The Steaks
Usually I would start with appetizers but let's be honest- you are here for a giant slab of meat. 

 Here are the steaks I have had ranked in order

1. Bone in ribeye for two. This is carved tableside. If you like Ruths Chris serve your steak at 1500 degrees sizzling deal you might not like this as it is served more room temperature- and if it is warm at all the heat quickly goes away from the thinly sliced meat. It is very tasty though- the seasoning is very light so its all beef taste.
2. NY Strip- not usually one of my favorite cuts but I have gotten it a few times for variety and it is better here than elsewhere I have had it.
3. Bone in Filet- superior to the boneless IMO- has the very soft texture and less beefy taste you expect from a filet. 

Now, not always, but most of the time, they have a special steak that is aged longer- if this is available for the love of all that is holy get it. Pay whatever they ask- 100$ a pound, 200$ a pound, your first born- whatever it takes. These steaks taste like nothing you have ever had or likely will have again in the future. They have an almost blue cheese like flavor that is incredible. I have had plenty of expensive food that I would say was not worth it- this is not one of those. 

Non steak Items- I have ordered a few of these - pork chop, Osso Buco, and they are great- if you are a local and can come here frequently I highly encourage you to try them. If you are in from out of town though, you probably just want to get a steak or you will return him and find yourself lying awake in bed, filled with regrets.

Appetizers- there are quite a few beef appetizers. You can go two ways with this- some people will find beef on beef on beef to be too much- we call them French. So if you are worried about your blood test results get something else, if you love America here are some suggested Apps (not all of these are beef but are meat)


1. Carne Cruda- raw beef good. 

2.Prosciutto di Parma and Affettati Misti- picking between these two is slightly harder than Sophie's Choice

3. Beef Cappallacci -this has some really strong goat cheese which is amazing but may knock your socks off. 

4. Anolini- lobster pasta- whats not to love",s-591-mtIyP7F1Lffw98jw,8,5,5,GWGjvq1LoOZav6z-iS-VZQ
1919637,2015-07-26,1,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"This is supposed to be an Italian steakhouse restaurant. The rosemary bread (stale) was served with a dish of lard and a dish of butter, neither ever served in Italy (where is the olive oil?). The chopped salad was full of cabbage - also never found in Italy (maybe in Germany like the lard). The salad had no dressing and none of the italian cheese or meat that was suppposed to be in it. The ricotta and egg raviolo had a raw egg yolk in it which when cut into ran all over the plate (the egg yolk should be thickened like eggs benedict). It was gross. The filet mignon was so tough that I had to squash the filet against the plate using the red handled steak knife they supplied to cut through it. It was cooked properly medium rare. There was no salt and pepper on the table.  We asked for some and they brought out a small dish with large crystals of salt (imported from London they said).  They said to pick some up and grind it between your thumb and forefinger to break down the large salt crystals. I don't like grinding my salt myself and it is not very sanitary. My wife ordered the veal. It was served floating in a dish of brown water.  She was looking for a place to pour off all the liquid so she could eat the veal but there was no way to do this. We ordered sparkling water.  They said it is trucked in from Montana and filtered 7 different ways. The water tasted like plain water - San Pelligrino water would have been much better. This restaurant is trying to be trendy and failing. I ordered a grappa for after dinner. They served it in a very small wine type glass, only around 1/4 of a shot. At least my wife's grand marnier after dinner drink was 1 shot is size. I do not recommend this restaurant and it is not Italian.",62p2KSGTCuZAeTvqyS-hFg,1,0,1,nnMnf18brjVDzLHdzWYbGQ

For me the burger or the mortadella sandwich were great options. The service at the bar is always attentive despite the bartender being the only one there to help. 

The wife and I really like to hang out in the Palazzo casino as it's bright and has high ceilings so you don't feel like your really in a casino. Also the adjoining shops are great to visit.

1942853,2011-02-15,4,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"Really a 3.5 Star At Most, Overall

Came here with some friends/couples for a Valentines Dinner. I did research the reviews on this place and was a bit discouraged to find that it had 3.5 Stars with over 240 reviews. I do understand that there are other high caliber steak houses in town that must be taken in consideration when critiquing a place like this. Well, I need to find out myself!

The Lowdown on Food:

Cheese croquettes: complimentary bite sized balls with a lightly fried breaded crust and a mild salty/cheesy filling. Not bad, others thought it was good and salty for the most part.

Ciabatta Square bread with ""Lardo"" spread (Pork Fat) and Unsalted Butter. Bread was ok. The lardo spread was pretty good just the thought brought so much guilt! The plain butter was fine and surprisingly tasty.

Fried Calamari: small delicately breaded squid on a thin layer of marinara and pickled hot peppers. Not chewy and had a oceany flavor to it. Not much bang for the buck ($19)

Roasted Cauliflower with Pine Nuts, capers and peperonata: it was definitely roasted and nothing extraordinary. I think they forgot to add in the capers too.. Didn't see any and didn't taste any?

* I'm only giving them the benefit of the doubt because of the 2 following orders I'm about to mention:

1. Dry Aged Bone-In Ribeye: Served for 2, Approximately 32 ounces and cost a Whopping $130! ""BBL is often beyond regular USDA prime standards for marbling and flavor"". Claimed to be all natural, hand selected, aged in house and rubbed with only sea salt, black pepper and fresh rosemary.

- I'm giving this place the 4 Star Advantage because the Steak was Irresistible!! I got it cooked medium well, slight pink through the middle of the thin slices (Cut Tableside) and a little char on the crust. Came with a Massive Bone (like a foot and quarter long and around 2 inches in diameter!) and Server says ""The Best Part of the Steak, go ahead and nibble on it!"" I also had their ""First Batch Extra Virgin Olive Oil"" drizzled around one side of my plate to wipe my meat slices as I pleased. Plus, I ordered a side of Bearnaise sauce for dipping. The steak was Very Tender and their custom Dull ""Carnevino Stamped Steak Knife"" sliced through it with ease. The simplicity of the few seasonings were light and sensitively used but exactly how a piece of Real Quality Meat should be Treated/Seasoned!! No Ifs, Ands or Buts, Top 3 Steaks I've had in my life!! It didn't need anything to support the flavors but I did try dipping a few pieces in the Bearnaise and it was Absurd how much better it tasted!!  My friend next to me ordered the Bearnaise with Crab mixed in it. I took a scoop with a chunk of creamy crab, it had nice delicate flavors and it transformed the steak into something positively different.. All in All, this came with  with a Heavy Weight  price and probably not worth it too most.. BUT It really was Iron Chef/Mario Batali Worthy!!!

2. Signature Mashed Potato with Poached egg and bacon: oh so smooth, soft textured mash with strips of lightly crisped bacon and an egg on top begging for its yolk to be broken and spread through the little iron dish it was served in. Sinfully Delicious!! Only complaint, it was too small!!

* Service: One of the worse service I had ever experienced! Many mistakes and amateur decisions such as forgetting to ask everybody what beverage they wanted, Extremely Long Wait with no Updates, Had to be reminded to serve another soda, hostess and staff member was lacking knowledge of menu items.... 

For the Price they should of Fed us and Wiped our A&%!!!!! On the other hand, the place was quite Nice, had a somewhat Royal Feel to it and I really liked the Chinese Style ""Lazy Susan"" embedded in their huge round table (convenient  to share the appetizers, sides and such). Lastly, The Bone in Ribeye was One of the Best I've had and the Signature Mashed potato with egg was Drop Dead Delicious!!",mY3mROf28N-vY1fpR-FFUw,7,4,4,NUArRDalkqFJ-xyyTAZyKQ
1943705,2012-10-05,0,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"Admittedly, I'm a steak snob so when I go and plunk down a couple of hundred bucks plus for a dinner we expect it to be something special. However this isn't about the price, it's about a place that boasts ""the best Italian on the strip"" and is supposed to be about the meat and wine.
I've eaten steak at a few places including Craftsteak, Delmonico, Del Frisco's, The Homestead, as well as the chains like Flemming's, Morton's, and Ruth's Chris... so yes, I'm a steak guy.
Now I know any steakhouse can have an off moment, I've sent steaks back probably at one time or another at every place except Craftsteak where I ate two Iowa corn fed bone in strip steaks, but I've only eaten there once. Okay, you get the picture.

So CarneVino: let me first say that the staff was excellent, the hostesses were genial and professional, our waiter Brayden was extremely nice and professional as well, and the rest of the dining room staff was attentive without being overbearing.

The decor was very warm and inviting, and did have an up-scale steak house feel. The somewhat blaring 80s music was a little 

The food was a disappointment. At this level of dining I expect excellence. I first ordered a bone in ribeye for one. The menu listed it as a bone in ribeye for two and charged $70 per person as a single entree it was $95, I ordered it medium rare with Italian broccoli as a side. When the steak came I noticed that although as big as the plate, the steak was pretty thin. It reminded me of a breakfast steak one might expect at a diner. I cut into it and of course it was medium well. I changed my order and decided to go with the bone in strip steak which was on the menu as a regular single serving item and grazed on the very tough, but tasty Italian broccoli. When the steak arrived, it was lightly seared, probably in a pan, but the temperature was right when I cut into it. The meat was a little on the tough side and was definitely under seasoned. The wife went with pesto gnocchi, which was fine, but nothing spectacular. The wine we wanted was unavailable and the sommelier recommended a suitable substitute.
Overall, it was an average experience, and not up to par with even commercial establishments like Flemming's or Ruth's Chris. Mario has some work to do in order to make CarneVino the steak destination it should be.",IUGK-E2AJdcTC24FIv1SjA,2,1,2,6oY9XK1TmQwtTNhlgfHIPA

Three out of four of us ordered it and they were FANTASTIC. yolk broke into the sauce and the pasta was nice and thin. Perfection. Honestly this was rich enough i wouldn't have needed the seafood spaghetti I ordered, even though it was tasty and very generous with the seafood. Other entrees at the table included the game hen which she liked a lot, too. Service was almost perfect, took the waiter too long to ask if we wanted the check given how likely it was we needed to leave and make a show (which we did). But more importantly the waitstaff has obviously been very well trained.

One example, we asked for our salad to be split, and they brought the salad on one plate.  I asked again to have the salad split onto two plates, and the waiter looks at the other waiter and shrugs his shoulders up and down and says, ""Ok, why not!""

There's nothing worse than when you're paying a premium price for dinner, and the food is average and the service is bad.

The restaurant doesn't even try to create some sort of universal vibe - there's one large room as far as I saw that remains relatively noisy.  In the background they played Michael Jackson (RIP) and a few other 80s artists the whole time.  But they dressed old school Italian steakhouse feel.  The whole place was just confusing, I would definitely not choose this place for a date and questionable for large special occasion as well.

Cost: 2. More expensive than some comparable peers in Vegas (see my review for CUT, which is just around the corner).  Steaks are probably worth the price, but pastas and other appetizers seemed a bit on the pricey side, even for Vegas.

Food Quality: 4. More of a seafood guy, but I still loved the filet here, just not quite as good as some others I had.  That said, I've been told by other steakhouses that THIS is the best steak in Vegas, and noted it was ranked nationally.  I suppose I miss something getting the filet vs the ribeye.  Great wine selection.  Sides and side dressings for steaks we ordered were immemorable.  Gnocchi pasta was o k but wouldn't order again.. Black Fettuccine Seafood pasta was great, but overpriced for portion size as another reviewer mentioned.

Service: 4. A little over the top, really pushing hard for tips etc but all in all quality service that explained the menu well.  Able to accommodate us on a Monday without a reservation.

When to return: To honor Michael Jackson.  Steak craving.  Balling at the Palazzo.  When they've banned you from other Vegas restaurants nearby.",ogkSx3LzAZrY7ZwFz5JV3A,0,0,3,KvDcwaDbouUBxhL3Csy1CA

1991228,2015-03-12,5,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"Vegas is a city of decadence, and if you're staying at the Venetian, Carnevino is a pretty good place to splash down your cash. It's fancy and expensive, with a lovely upscale ambiance and top notch service. The carne and vino are excellent.

I went for dinner with my family during a weekend stay at the Venetian. There were six of us, and we sat at a comfortable tucked-away table that felt like a luxury poolside cabana looking into the rest of the opulent dining room. Service was on point. Our waiter Corey was friendly and attentive, and he took really good care of us. The sommelier was also helpful. We asked her to recommend a wine and ended up getting a magnum of Barolo. It was a wonderful wine, perfect for our meal, and it came in the largest decanter I've ever seen, which the thin sommelier hefted around like a champ.

The food was delicious, actually much better than I expected given the Yelp reviews. I thought Carnevino was on par with other Batali restaurants, and I love me some Batali. Our meal kicked off with complimentary cheese bread, soft warm puffs packed with flavor, along with some crusty rosemary ciabatta rolls served with butter and lardo. We then shared a neat spread of appetizers. The best of these was the grilled octopus with pickled vegetables and limoncello. This was some of the best octopus I've ever had, tender and meaty, firm without any toughness. There was some nice heat to it too--I think there were some Fresno chiles in those pickled vegetables. The prosciutto di Parma ""riserva"" was great to share, a large platter of silky prosciutto ribbons, served with sliced apple. We added gnocchi fritto, these fried bready pillows, to eat with the prosciutto, and they were lovely. We also shared two pastas, which became appetizer-sized when split six ways. The beef cheek ravioli was tremendously good. Delicate triangles of pasta came stuffed with a rich, hearty filling of beef cheek, all served in a butter sauce drizzled with 20-year balsamic vinegar. This dish is a Carnevino and Batali signature (I'm pretty sure I've seen and coveted it...Iron Chef??), but it is technically off menu. Your server is sure to mention it, but if not, it's worth an inquiry. The orecchiette with sweet sausage and broccoli rabe was also fantastic, the thick, toothsome ears of pasta in a satisfying tomato sauce.

For the meat of our meal, we ordered both of the large format steaks--the dry aged bone-in ribeye and La Fiorentina, or classic Florentine porterhouse. This was a real feast, with both steaks carved up and served on enormous plates. Both were cooked a beautiful rare medium rare, red velvet with a seared, seasoned crust. They tasted different from each other but not in a way I could describe well, even at the time--they were both juicy and perfectly cooked, and I couldn't state a preference for one over the other. Just bring everyone you know and get both. We also ordered a couple sides--the charred brussels sprouts and the mascarpone and guanciale mashed potatoes. These were tiny sides, definitely sized for individuals, but we each all got a few bites of each. They were great. The sprouts were nice and roasty, with a pleasant brightness from the lemon zest in the gremolata. The mashed potatoes were rich and creamy, laced with face bacon and a poached egg.

We were pretty stuffed by the time dessert came around, but we rallied and split a couple between the six of us. The chocolate peanut butter torte was a dense, gorgeous slice of indulgence, served with peanut brittle and salted caramel sauce. The gelato and sorbet was a great way to end the meal--we got lemon curd gelato and tangerine and blood orange sorbets, all citrusy, light, and not too sweet. About what I want after a whole lot of steak.

This was an expensive meal (most of it was comped, courtesy of the Venetian's love of Asian gamblers), but probably worth a splurge if you're looking to eat and drink well while on vacation. It's hard to beat good steak and wine, even harder to beat good steak, wine, octopus, pasta, etc. I'd love to come back to Carnevino, and will keep it in mind next time I'm looking to go big in Vegas.",WWnhqRnWWjutMqh-2SzEuQ,8,5,5,-Oy3A6dVi2aPM9Wt2-r07Q

My husband and I have this theory that compared to NY and SF Vegas does not have the freshest vegetables or most creative food, but can do very well with simple recipes involving expensive ingredients, and especially meat. This place totally verified the theory -the foods we ordered, like the fillet mignon, calamari and truffle ravioli were simply cooked, yet over the top ingredients-wise and delicious. The wine was heavenly too. We went for lunch, when the place was almost empty -not sure if that was why, but we received phenomenal service.

Then we had a steak tare tare. hmmmm. Who knew that raw beef could be flavored so well that the raw factor wasn't even a factor? Then the main course!

Tuscan Fries and Potato & Parmigiano Zeppole with my 8oz Filet Mignon. The zeppole just melted in my mouth. The steak was the perfect medium and tender as all hell.

The service was brilliant and definitely up to par to the level of food. You could tell that these were professionals. They understood their food, understood their cilents and understood when and where to go. And that they love their job.

2052052,2012-03-22,0,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"My wife and I dined at Carnevino on our honeymoon, about 2 days after our Vegas wedding. It was her gift to me, knowing I was always looking for the ""best steak I could ever find"".

When the steak came out we were ecstatic. The thing was beautiful before (a true tomahawk behemoth, featuring red, black and brown tones on the outside), and after carving (perfectly stacked and distributed by our server. Then topped with a bit of sea salt). It had all the fat, slight char, and concentrated beef flavor that I look for, but on a grand scale. Further, the excess bone, once carved off, was full of that great, succulent, aged ribeye bone meat. We were encouraged to pick the bone up and have our way with it (or ""enjoy"", as the ever-proper waitstaff would put it). The server even came over and took our picture while we attacked this thing like a couple of rabid dogs! Needless to say, those pics will be in our wedding album for generations to come. 

I live in Chicago, a true beef capital, and have eaten at steakhouses all over this city looking for the best. Never have I had an experience separate itself from the pack like that glorious ribeye for two at Carnevino. We will be back. 

One beef (no pun) though- barely not enough to dock a star - $28 for 2 Campari and Sodas. That's just unheard of. On the other hand, they charge just $10 for an Amaro Nonino. Get your prices right.  We were happy to pay the $142+ for just the steak for 2, but would have gotten our appertifs elsewhere if we knew we'd be getting screwed like that on such a simple, inexpensive drink.  


Overall though, I will dream about this steak until the day I return. That's really all you need to know about what you're going to get. Just use caution on your drink orders. Your bill's already going to be huge. Service was great too.",NbRA23rDgK1mMrBATMpU7Q,0,0,5,rNveizTqywWokoUVarb0Eg

Tease:   Iron Chef, Mario Batali's Italian Steakhouse is known to be one of the best there is.

Why I went:  Because it just may be the best!

When:  11/17/12

Food:  We pretty much scrapped appetizers realizing that we wanted to be ""all in"" on the main course!  My wife and I were joined by 2 friends, and opted for a nice Nebbiolo wine for the table (Brandini).  It was reasonably priced at $30/bottle.  Very reasonable considering some of the other prices on the wine list!  Despite being directed to pricier bottles, my wife stuck to her guns, and kept the Nebbiolo.  I'm sure the sommelier had great ideas, but we just wanted to keep our drink costs reasonable.  For sides, we got the beef cheek raviolis (...simply melt in your mouth delicious!  They were perfectly cooked with a nice rich sauce.), broccoli, cauliflower, and market beans.  We needed some vegetables to balance out the meats to come!  The vegetables were all prepared simply and were tasty.  Having has some steak recently, my wife opted for the lobster, and she was thoroughly impressed.  It was prepared spot on, and presented well.  However, the star of the show is the steak!  Our friends got the rib-eye to share.  At $72, it's pricey...but SO worth it.  They were kind enough to share a bit with me, and it was spectacular!  I forget the exact size, but it was huge!  I got the house dry aged NY steak.  I had it prepared black & blue based on a discussion with our waiter.  He directed me well!  The steak was just superb!  Honestly, THE BEST NY CUT I'VE EVER HAD!  After all the wonderful mains and sides, we had no room for dessert.  The dessert was the steak!

Service:   Excellent!  Our waiter, Gary C. simply rocked.  He explained everything in full detail and was happy to answer any questions.  All the bussers, hosts, and all were simply great.  The sommelier was also nice and knowledgeable, but we felt a little too much of a push for pricier bottles despite telling him that our price range was.  Not rude at all, but just a wee bit pushy.  However, that wasn't remotely a distraction from the wonderful overall services we had. 

Hints/Final thoughts:  Carnevino is arguably the best steakhouse in America.  I have been on 3 occasions, and every time it delivers flawlessly.  It is costly, but so worth every penny.",EBveE4oDk6AYWNUEs937mg,2,1,5,WSfjJpKvABulAdZciS4RuQ

DO not be embarrassed!!!! I cannot wait to return to this palace of ultimate indulgence. There's a reason Mario's famous and we're not. The food is good. Italian steak? Seriously, mind boggling - beyond my wildest dreams. I adore steak. Abe & Louie's is my favorite place in the city followed closely by Grill 23, Benjamin's NYC, Joseph's Bridgeport, CT, Sammy's Roumanian NYC.

Situated in the Palazzo Hotel and Casino, the atmospheric attempt at Old Italy is gaudy and flawed but balanced by the servers in white jackets with proper demeanor. The attentiveness of service is almost astonishing - if you lift your head, a server appears at your side - unobtrusive but very observant. 

The wine list essentially starts at $100 bottle. We ordered sapphires and tonics - perfect mixture:  gin, topped off with tonic. A bottle of Carema ""Etichetta Nera,"" Ferrando 2007 breathed while we decided what to order ($150). Aired, a deliciously dry vino, perfect to accompany red meat. 

The special cut was a BBL special, bone in rib eye, dry aged for twelve months, for two. This is apparently proprietary beef, trademarked as such. $90 a head. We chose the menu bone in rib eye for two; BBL beef dry aged for nine months at $65/pp. My buddy didn't want to order a starter, but the server wisely suggested that since the steak was going to take about 40 minutes to prepare, it was probably best that we order an appetizer. 

Grilled octopus with micro greens, a limoncello drizzle and ""pickled"" vegetables, grilled hot peppers, beets and an olive oil balsamic reduction,  outstanding. Meaty octopus tendons, juicy, thick and succulent. The perfect accompaniment to fresh baked foccacia loaf served with house whipped creamed butter and a ramekin of lardo. Toasted hot and buttery foccacia - crispy outer shell, pepper coatrd and fluffy inside. 

See picture of whole steak. Note the size of steak in comparison to the server's hand on the plate: G-inormous. Wheeled over on a cart, placed on a butcher block and carved select slice by select slice and arranged on your plate for consumption, perfect. See arrangement picture, grilled perfectly medium rare. Crusted in a tasty black pepper, sea salt and rosemary rub. Remaining bone sliced in two and let on separate place for our enjoyment. The meat is really a cut above. I've enjoyed a couple steaks here and there. This was different. Succulent, melt in your mouth goodness. Primest of the prime. 

Side of mashed potatoes with poached egg, spinach and ham. Unique but exquisite. 

The bill was also prime but you get what you pay for. Enjoy.",_NTm9Xv0gDfafBQxR3uUyQ,3,2,5,Fx_RALeT1QpN2eJ10Nn9kw

2117115,2015-03-19,0,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"Disappointing experience. I went with my mom for her birthday. I was expecting a spectacular life-changing meal. CarneVino did not deliver.

Firstly the table that was given to us was a four top that was obstructed by one of the columns in the restaurant so that you couldn't pull out your chair the entire way. Bad start. Also, as a person with mobility issues sometimes I need to arrange the chairs and table so I can access them. Our host had helped us move the table out so that I could sit down and our waiter immediately came and moved it back and was quite cross with the host for moving the table.

The breadbasket was okay but nothing spectacular. I didn't care for the lard that was served with it. 

I'm a pretty small person and can't eat more than a 10 ounce steak at best. Unfortunately this puts me at a disadvantage to some of the more specialty steaks on their menu. I was also going with someone whose choice of doneness varies from mine, so sharing was not an option.

We both ordered the filet mignon; I ordered mine medium rare and mom ordered hers medium well. Having read the reviews before hand and their unique take on doneness we specifically indicated that I wanted my red in the middle and that she wanted her's pink. Our waiter indicated that in order to do medium well, the chef required it to be butterflied. My mom was hesitant but I recommended that if the chef required it to be done medium well and that's how she should do it. What a mistake. My filet was good it did have a nice crust on it and it was a medium rare. My moms was certainly well done. No pink at all. Our waiter checked on us before we had started eating and at that time everything was fine. We could not catch his attention until my mom was 90% done her steak. We complained about the doneness of it and he said we should've complained earlier because now there was nothing he could do about it. He did not offer to redo the steak and he did not offer to compensate us in anyway for the experience.

Our sides did not improve the experience greatly. We ordered the caprese salad, the Bucatini amatriciana and the fregola. The caprese were cherry tomatoes which I don't care for and did not say in the description. The fregola was very cheese forward and salty. The bucatini was good, pasta al dente and a nice sauce with a spicy kick.

I had the panna cotta rhubarb compote for dessert. The bitterness of the rhubarb was a nice contrast to the sweetness of the panna Cotta. 

Maybe I erred in not ordering their special aged steak, but the rest of the experience was so poor that I'm not going back to find out.",TY7QgNKJEhvo1zCULlT9Rg,2,0,2,21EBBHA92D3Mmwdq_n16eQ

I had two major problems with this establishment, however:
1. Pricing
2. Balance

2140455,2016-05-02,17,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"Mario, my Mario... If I could write you a song, it would surely be a love song, one where hearts (as well as bellies) would swell as I waxed poetic about the concerto that is Carnevino. 

The scene: Carnevino is Mario Batali's  Italian steakhouse located inside of the Palazzo. Although it is located off of the casino floor, once you get about halfway into the restaurant, you no longer feel like you're in a casino; it is a traditional dim and cavernous space. Try to get a table closer to the back if possible, so you're not distracted. The only knock against atmosphere was that the background musical selections were a bit odd- from country to disco, and their bathrooms were closed (?), so I had to go through the casino to use the facilities.

The service: professional, friendly, knowledgable, and attentive. You'll have several people seeing to your table, and from the sommelier to the busboys, they all were high caliber, yet managing not to be too stuffy. The sommelier recommended a lovely wine, and was able to speak at length about various vineyards and vintages, comparing them, and even peppering in his personal knowledge about the owners.

And now.. The food: Yes, the true star of the show, the climax of the song, the reason why you visit Carnevino. Almost* everything was Rich, decadent, and delicious. 

Our appetizer was the only dish that fell a little short for me, and it was more about texture than taste. The caprese was presented with cherry tomatoes rather than tomato slices. The texture just was not my cup of tea, and it was a bit unwieldy, if pretty. The tomato stalks got in the way, it was difficult to get the mozzarella and pesto to combine with the tiny tomatoes. The cheese and pesto were lovely and tasty, but as a dish, it just went a bit ""off pitch.""

Never fear, though! Mario redeemed himself with every other aspect of the meal! Our second course, the Dungeness crab crespelle was simply divine. A crepe stuffed with crab and asparagus, with a cream sauce managed to be simultaneously light and rich. The sweetness of the crab- oh my! The asparagus just bordered on being too strong, but managed to shy away for overpowering the dish. The portion was small, too small for an entree, but just right to share as a second course.

And the meat... Oh, the meat... 
We shared the BBL ribeye, which is supposedly a level between prime and Kobe. It was fantastic. 
Carved table side, and sprinkled with a final dash of salt and a swirl of olive oil, it had amazing flavor, was tender, and the meat on the bone had us almost break into song.

Be forewarned, Carnevino cooks its steaks a little on the rarer side. Our lovely server was kind enough to let us know before we ordered. So, if you usually prefer your steak medium rare, as I do, then order it cooked medium, so it will be a red, warm center. The table next to us must have ordered rare, and it barely looked seared- that poor cow looked like it was about to jump up and walk out of the restaurant, it was that raw!

You cannot leave without dessert, and the tirimisu was phenomenal. Seriously. I don't know exactly what was different, but the taste pretty much gave me an out of body experience. It was one of the richest desserts I've ever had, but in the best way possible.

As expected, Carnevino is not for the light of pocket. I didn't get to see the bill, but prices are on the menu, so you can do the math. The important thing is that it was totally worth it- and totally worth me warming up my vocal chords to serenade Chef Mario Batali.",lQGJcwX105k17081f6pulg,19,19,5,tBFhtLZKnPP8dGYckktW9w
2140715,2011-01-26,1,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"I went here on Christmas Eve with my mom, and I just have to say it was one of the best meals I had ever had.

The location is a little bit awkward and unconventional, since it's split into two with the two areas being right near the slots and escalators. I didn't mind much, because it's not awfully noisy or terrible.

Our waiter was amazing. He was very professional, very quick, and he carved our steak with such elegance that I was actually, ACTUALLY awe-struck.

We got the Dry Aged Bone in Ribeye (for two) with sauteed brussel sprouts and a seasonal side of butternut squash. The butternut squash was delightful; I had no complaints about that one. But, the sauteed brussel spouts were really delicious. They were cooked just right, and had a light crispy crunch to them, while at the same time, not being too greasy. 

Onto the good part. I have to say, if you go to Carnevino, you NEED to get the Dry Aged Bone in Ribeye. Yeah, so it's $65 per person, but I would have to say it's totally worth it. They brought this ginormous thing of meat out on this wooden board over this dainty little cart. Our waiter carved it right in front of us, and served it to us, arranging it nicely on our plates with wonderful presentation as if we weren't already impressed. When they were done, they left the giant bone on a plate for us and advised that the meat next to the bone is amazing. That we should try it. Well, of course!

Although there was too much steak, and as much as I wanted to finish everything, I stuffed myself until I physically could just not fit any more meat into my stomach. I did end up trying the meat off the bone. It was divine. Not only was the texture different, but the taste was different from the rest!

We also asked our waiter for a wine suggestion. He poured us a nice glass of Cabernet, which went amazingly with the beef.

I'm confident about this place enough to say that it was probably the best meal I have ever, ever had. And I've had many meals in my lifetime.",L-2fUdw72MXSgQyhGYsaMg,0,0,5,VXLxn5iuYn8sUv_qXjrWaw

We opened with the divine Jamon di Iberico (I'm using the Italian spelling of di, by the way, given the restaurant - don't knock it.)

A bottle of 1982 Barolo and a 1998 were uncorked and aired, and quaffed with glee.  The copper penny element of the Barolo was unusual, but remarkable when paired with the Riserva.

The steaks were prepared rare as we requested, and the Sommelier was exceedingly helpful.

The food was striking and memorable, and the dry aged Riserva (aged 8 months) was unlike any meat I've had yet.  Is it perfection?  No.  But give me another Riserva steak, and I'll happy to let them try again!",kcLuh-ck_Zj07TsodaaNUA,4,1,5,hTINbFghGYLhpeF-bVivJQ

We first started off with fried calamari and potato gnocchi bolognese to share. The calamari was good (not out of this world) and the gnocchis were a bit on the hard side. Not what I expected. I am sure they were homemade, however they needed to be cooked just a tad bit more. 

For my meal, I had the filet mignon and our table shared a number of different sides. As far as the filet is concerned, I asked for it to be medium rare and it was just plain old rare. So rare that I couldn't really eat it. I should have sent it back to be cooked a bit longer (my fault), however I didn't want to be ""that"" girl at the table. 

As far as the sides are concerned, the butternut squash dish was delicious. The spinach was a bit on the salty side. The mushrooms were a bit overcooked, they were just a little bit too crispy. 

The dessert however was very good. We had the lemon cheesecake, assorted cookies, butter cream crepes and something else that I can't remember. My favorite would have to be the assorted cookies.

While the in-house dry ageing process is pretty cool, the whole experience was just A-Ok. Service was pretty good, ambiance was pretty good. Loved how the managers checked on us through out the evening. But the food was just, there. I enjoyed watching our steaks being carved tabled side. A co-worker of mine told me to request a server named MJ, but unfortunately he was working a private party. However, he still stopped by to introduce himself. Fist bumps to you, MJ.
Here's what we ordered.

Grilled octopus: Super tender and zesty. Wish there was just an extra piece or two for the $25 price tag.

Sweetbreads: pass

Foie Gras: Pretty basic. Foie sells itself

BI Ribeye for 2: aged 90 days, medium. (However, our server informed us that their medium is actually a medium rare at other restaurants. Doesn't make sense; call it medium rare then). So, in my opinion, it was a perfect medium rare. 

Riserva BI New York: Aged 120 days. $78 per inch for this bad boy. As described, it tasted funky, tender and rich.  Think of it as a steak infused with bleu cheese. 

Sides:
Mashed potatoes.: nicely whipped, poached egg on top. Doesn't beat Robuchon's mashers, though.
Roasted Beets: Blah
Tuscan fries: Beware, these are pretty much roasted fingerling potatoes. Knew that going in, but they were just blah.

Dessert:
Sorbet/Gelati Trio: Blah
Banana Fosters Panna Cotta: Here we go. Yum. Wanted to lick the plate clean

Add on a bottle of Prosecco and Amarone, our price tag for 2 was $611 excluding tip. We splurged, we consumed but we didn't walk out feeling excited about the experience. I mean, now that Echo and Rig has graced us with their presence in Tivoli Village, you can go there and spend $500 less and have a stellar dining experience.",QiVO1CAXajUamfYhjimaew,0,1,3,2VUZQx7wZi9QRjcJuWjlLw

2192416,2012-07-27,5,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"Before planning my trip to Vegas I had actually looked pretty thoroughly for somewhere that did an all beef tasting menu, because I figured if anywhere would have one it would be the land of steakhouses and extravagance. My searches yielded no results, and so I made several other dinner plans for this extended weekend trip. I wound up canceling all of those dinner plans because my friends just weren't interested in dining at ex-Michelin starred restaurants, and fortunately wound up stumbling into the beef tasting menu that I had been searching for, here at Carnevino. Sometimes in Vegas you actually do get lucky...although like everything else in this city our last dinner wasn't all it seemed from the surface.

Italian and steakhouse might not generally be two genres you expect to sensibly coexist, but I recall one of the better steaks I've ever had coming from a little Italian place in Fort Worth called Nonna Tata (http://www.yelp.com/biz/nonna-tata-fort-worth#hrid:rGS0dYxxgDOEN_H6QeMAig), so when I found out this place was owned by the celebrity chef Mario Batali I had rather high expectations. Overall I thought all of the food was good, and the service was excellent, but I honestly found some of it just a bit uninspired, and maybe that's because the menu hasn't changed at all since Gregg M and Carol W were here more than a year ago, except for a different dessert, which was easily the most forgettable course. Also, considering the prices here ($120 for the tasting) and relatively small portion size per course I would have expected a much higher quality grade of beef to be used.

The first course was a Wagyu beef crudo with coriander, saffron, and fennel piled generously in the middle, and was the only course to feature what most people would consider elite farmed beef. The fact that this was about 1 ounce of actual meat, uncooked, per person certainly left me desiring a bit more. Given that, the flavor of the raw beef was outstanding, and the fennel added a delicious pop, although if the saffron was there I didn't notice it.

Up next was actually a delicious pasta course, beef cheek ravioli with Aceto's 20 year aged balsamic vinegar drizzled over it, along with a bit of shaved parmesan. This really highlighted the Italian side of the cookery at Carnevino more than any other dish, and both the pasta and meat were done perfectly. The rich flavor from the mature balsamic was an outstanding addition.

For our third course we were given the first of a contrasting pair of sliced steaks, this one being wet aged Piemontese beef, served over spinach and garlic and topped with a fried quail egg. For me, this was the superior of the two offerings, due to the moistness of the steak and the additional textural enhancement of the quail egg. Meat and yolk together are really sublime, and this was just a bit more pleasurable to eat.

The second steak in the duo was dry aged ""BBL"" beef, drizzled with Bernaise sauce and served with a lobster and potato hash. Firstly, let me address this BBL beef moniker, because I believe it's quite important. This is something they've essentially made up, and claimed that it's better than USDA Prime beef, in addition to being hormone and antiobiotic free. Google BBL beef and all you get are references back to Carnevino...shady. There is nobody verifying the quality of these steaks other than Mario and Joe (Bastianich) supposedly, and you know they're not actually in the kitchen here. How did it taste? It was good, sure, but for this price I want some sort of credibility besides your own word (which again, they aren't in the kitchen doing the work). The lobster and potato hash however was fantastic, and I could easily eat a larger portion of this as an entr√©e.

As I mentioned earlier, dessert was a relatively simple and mostly boring goat's milk panna cotta, with ""market"" berries. I'm guessing the market in Las Vegas never really changes, since no real produce comes from here. This time around it was strawberries, raspberries, and blueberries, and I'm guessing if you come back 3 years from now and in December it will still be the same damn berries.

The final verdict? Good food with totally unjustified prices. I think the most reasonable thing we got was the $300 bottle of Quintessa to pair with the steaks. Someone needs to come in and shake this place up a bit, as it currently seems like a shell of a great restaurant looking for some spirit to fill in the rest.",hpw7UrWf51aaWKbaGGJ2hA,7,5,3,vkTV_5Fxk65KvkzcGeulkA

My fiancee and I were amazed at just how attentive and just how perfectly the staff worked together to take care of not only us but each table.

Our dining experience started off with Tagliata di Manzo arugula, parmigiano drizzled with ages balsamic and the grilled Octopus pickled vegetables and limoncello. The bar was set high with these first offerings and only got better and better with the progression of each course.

We moved on to our pasta course. We had 
Ricotta and Egg Raviolo with brown butter. I have to say that each bite was blissful and decadent. It's one of those dishes you will think about long after its gone. We also had the beef cheek raviolis with aged balsamic. The plate was all to quickly bare and I just wanted more!!

Now we come to the meat which is the realm of one of the most talented chefs I know Adam Perry Lang. 

                                  ( BBL Beef

Our all natural BBL beef is hand selected and aged in our meat chamber by our man Adam Perry Lang. BBL beef is often beyond regular USDA prime standards for marbling and flavor and is hormone and antibiotic free. We rub all of our beef with sea salt, black pepper and fresh rosemary to get a delicious and slightly charred crust.)

My fianc√©e chose the filet I had the 
Bone-In New York Strip 16 oz dry aged bbl beef. 
To co-star with our steaks we ordered the Porcini Bearnaise, Mascarpone & Guanciale Mashed Potatoes, Tuscan fries and ""Creamed"" Corn with pickled peppers. 

To begin with the steaks are masterfully carved for you table side then sprinkled with finishing salt and drizzled with olive oil. To say my steak was good would be not only one of the greatest understatements of my life but it would be sacrilege. It was prefectly cooked and it melted in my mouth. The co-stars or sides just seem to enhance what we were consuming. My favorite were the Mashed potatoes maybe because of the yolk or because of the bacon either way everything was incredible.

Our dining journey ended with Caramel Panna Cotta caramelized bananas, raspberries as well as 
Plum, peach and mango sorbeti.

2214638,2015-11-16,1,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"Beautiful restaurant adjacent to the Palazzo.  The staff was excellent- very accommodating without being overbearing.  We were served very good bread after being seated.  The wine list prices are double take inducing.  As it turned out, the mark up on the excellent bottle of Amarone that we ordered was under 100%, so Batali and the boys made a decision to showcase kick ass wines without being as rapacious as you might think.  Wines by the glass would be a very reasonable alternative approach.  We started with the prosciutto, which was excellent- it literally melted in your mouth.  If you order this, ask for the teeny little rolls that they serve.  You wrap a slice of prosciutto around a little roll and eat the combination.  We also had the duck egg with pastrami, which was OK.  We each ordered the special dry aged steak, which was aged a lot longer than their usual protocol.  The dry aging lends the meat a deep, funky undertone that is an additional flavor usually missing from meat. That said, I'm not sure how much it really adds.  We had some excellent mushrooms as a side dish.  Truffle shavings couldn't rescue potatoes au gratin from mediocrity.

The only real negative to this place is the prices. This is a really expensive steak house- significantly more expensive than what I am used to in Manhattan, so there will be a lot of sticker shock.  I'm not sure how the prices here compare to other Las Vegas steak houses, so this may be the price of admission in this town for great steak and wine.  If you don't have a YOLO attitude, skip this place, because it's a excellent restaurant, but not a great value.

But I CAN remember that the service was great, my porterhouse was massive and flavorful, and the dessert was average...but the best thing about this restaurant is what comes before your entree, the bread.
The rosemary bread is fresh, fluffy, warm, golden and crispy brown, and tasty, but that's not why the bread is the best part of the meal. The best part of the bread is what goes on TOP of the bread, not butter, not oil, not vinegar, but lard. Carne Vino has housemade lardo, lard, herbs, and spices mashed together into the finest paste known to man and gods alike.

2236466,2013-06-11,0,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"Our room deal included a $100 food credit at select restaurants, really more like a coupon since we had to use it all at once at one establishment. Lucky for a friend and I we were the only ones to arrive in time for dinner to use it (the rest of the weekend was preplanned) and decided to ""splurge"" at Carnevino. We really just wanted to try the food at a Mario Batali restaurant and this was the only one on the list for the food credit. Though the tables were all reserved on a Friday evening it was no problem getting a seat at the bar where we were able to order from the dinner menu though it's a bit weird to be eating at a ""fine dining"" establishment that looks out over the casino.

We managed to order the right amount of food so that the total bill including tax came out to $100.53 - complete optimization of our food credit. Of course we paid tip in cash. Since we weren't interested in steak we went a little crazy on the lobster.....

VENETIAN SPRITZ ($12) - Aperol liqueur, Prosecco, orange slice, olive
comes in a giant goblet and is very refreshing

LOBSTER SALAD ($32) - brioche, lemon & spring vegetables
pretty good though overpriced as expected

SPAGHETTI AI FRUTTI DI MARE ($31) - slightly spicy with clams, giant shrimp, lobster, and calamari
didn't think the seafood was as good as in the lobster salad, some of it felt mealy, pasta was perfect though we could have used more, half the dish was the seafood, i mean really, pasta isn't that expensive just throw in some more!

ROASTED BEETS WITH PISTACHIOS AND GORGONZOLA ($9)
not a very interesting preparation since the pistachios were left whole so therefore you couldn't eat it together with the beets, perhaps they could have chopped the pistachios so it stud on the beets, also not very much gorgonzola, could barely see it let alone taste it

FRIED EGGPLANT WITH TOMATO & RICOTTA ($9)
a very simple and elegant preparation of eggplant though again there was hardly any cheese involved

For drinks I chose the blood orange martini (yum), and the BF got a Peroni beer (pretty good).  Our waiter listed the specials and immediately I was set on the foie gras with freshly shaved white truffles (two off my obsession list).  Glazed and perfectly tasty.  Even at $50 a pop, I was tempted to get another!  I resisted and awaited my entree of lamb with a side of butternut squash and the seafood pasta.  My BF got the veal.  The lamb was surprisingly a large portion (3 double chops).  The pasta was not very good unfortunately... It did come with a good amount of seafood, which was overcooked and the pasta was a little too al dente for my taste.  My BF said the veal was OK.  The butternut squash side was not what I was expecting, but was good.  The bill came out to around $300 with tax and tip (we tipped about 25% - service was good and it's not his fault the food was bad!).  The foie gras was worth the trip, but maybe next time we will go to B&B or have the BF stick to the steak, which I hear is pretty good.   All in all, I was pretty disappointed, but then again, we did go to a steak house and did not get the steak.

2239096,2011-10-23,1,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"I'm surprised that Carnevino doesn't have better reviews. I was very impressed the time that I went here with the quality of the steaks. I have to say that based on the quality alone, this is probably one of the best steaks that I have had in Las Vegas, and surprisingly I didn't have the bone-in rib eye, like I usually do. The price of the restaurant may be a reason for the low ratings, but if solely on the quality of the food, this should be a 5 star rating. The aged steaks are beyond great and probably the reason i am a big fan. They have a huge bone-in rib eye for 2 (that my friends had) and the meat was super tender and cooked to perfection. I had the double filet mignon that in my opinion was the best filet mignon that I have ever had - excellent quality of meat, aged and cooked to perfection, a perfect medium rare.

What is also great about this place is not only the great steaks, but since they are an italian steakhouse, they also have some really great pastas. We shared the spaghetti frutti di mare which had numerous and generous pieces of seafood. Overall very good pasta with many other selections available too. Also, the appetizers that we got were delicious. A must try is the grilled octopus! We also tried the bruscetta which was also very good.

The one thing that I was disappointed with here was that we did have some leftovers (mainly the huge bone-in rib eye for 2) and we attempted to take them home. However, for some unknown reason, we were given the wrong bag when we left. We discovered the error and I think that they accidentally threw our leftovers out when the table was cleared but they would not say they did that, so we left with no leftovers at all - and I know the steak would have tasted great the next day. The manager did take our drinks off our bill, which was a nice gesture, but we were still perplexed as to what happened. 

Overall, a must visit steakhouse for those of you coming to Las Vegas and wanting a higher end steakhouse.",6QFyYvYgN1XcVfxMMMWxGw,0,0,4,YpxLe9wPgyeLUyYt2u5i3g

2248317,2010-04-18,0,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"We hit up Carnevino for a very late lunch the day we got into Vegas, and were very happy that a friend had recommended this lovely Batali location.  Despite the fact that it's situated in The Palazzo, at the far end of the strip, it was well worth the death hike.  I can only speak for the Taverna (open noon to who knows when) - sadly, we could not afford dinner here.  :)

We got the infamous hamburger and a pastrami sandwich, splitting each.  The burger came with some with crispy pancetta and bleu cheese, and I believe some grilled onions.  My husband swears it's the best burger he's ever eaten ($19).  The pastrami ($18) was house-cured and very good - the sandwich's mustard overpowered it somewhat, but the meat itself was excellent.  The burger came with boring, from-a-plastic-bag chips, but never fear - we got a side of the Tuscan ""fries"" - really fingerling potatoes cut in half and roasted, then coated with garlic and parmesan.

Handily enough, if you order an entree before 5pm, you can also get two beers, bellinis, or bloody marys for $11 - we got the bellinis, and they were extremely tasty.  Smelled like a peach orchard.  :)  They also served us fresh focaccia that was was warm and basted with salt water and truly wonderful.

The decor was full of rich wood, marble flooring, and friendly, warm lighting.  It was like being in a very cozy, 5 star dining room (go figure).  We also watched wine being VERY properly decanted (two decanters and prepared glasses) at the table next to us.  I would love to try some of their steaks for dinner - I'm sure the experience would have been divine.  Batali and his friend created a wonderful space that has something to offer every visitor, regardless of their income.  Stop by for a snack, if nothing else!

Bottles were, well astronomic. But as I stated we expected that, what we did not expect was exceedingly average food.

The other thing was that we were rushed, could not relax at all, no down time and it was not like people were standing inline to get seated. Be carefull.

Note after thinking about this for a few days, I lowered my star rating from 2 to 1.

2262526,2012-11-05,1,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"We were a group of five;  two men, three women at a conference, and, chef, if you're reading this, I need some information...

We were hungry and really looking forward to a great meal by Mr. Batali, and we were not disappointed.  Sure, I could go on and on about the meat (we shared the Porterhouse for two and the Prime Rib for two among the five of us), which was fantastic, and I could do the same for the sides (beets, potatoes, and spinach) which were also to die for.  

In fact, I could do a paragraph alone on the potatoes, and so I will..  Suffice it to say, they were mashed and brought to the table with some mascarpone cheese and a poached egg.  The server let us know that it is usually mixed together at the table, and we let him.  I have never seen an egg yolk blended into mashed potatoes, but there it was.  Chef, if you're reading this, here's the information I need,  I want to be able to do this at home, by myself.  I simply can't be limited to my visits to Las Vegas.  It sounds simple enough, but I need the specific proportions.

I would be remiss if I didn't mention the appetizer.  It was a caprese salad, and, again, the attention to detail was impeccable.  Also, they brought bread, butter and lardo.  This is the first time I've had lardo, and it is far from what I thought it would be, and something that will now be a sought after commodity.   

Now, here's the important part, we ate family style.  We shared everything, and everybody was happy.  Also, if you're blessed to be one of the males, this is also a great thing, as the women in our group filled up way before the males did, and so it was our duty to continue to do our very best to finish the meal.  Somebody had to.

We also got a lot of time to examine the wine list, and it is a long list in about 12 font that covers three pages.  But, alas, at a certain point you need to (or at least I need to) consider my wallet.  My wife's not with me on this occasion and my guilt is already growing.  As most of the bottles were in a price range, with three digits, that I did not want to be in, and so the sommelier was able to help our group find a bottle of wine to enjoy with our beef.  It was near $60, and worth every penny.

Now you need to know that this beef was simply incredible.  Do you want the beef to melt in your mouth?  This is it.  Do you want it marbled properly, seasoned enough to taste but not overpower?  You'll be happy.  Right now I've begun to salivate again thinking about the meat and its been two days since I had the dinner.  Yeah, it's that good.  The only thing that I would have preferred was the meat sampler with the wine pairing, but I just couldn't stomach the cost.  It would have been about $200 per person, but it included a wine with each different cut of meet.  At this point, I can only imagine how good it would be.

Besides the people at my table, Tom Petty was with us.  No, he wasn't dining in the place, he was on the stereo, and he, and the Heartbreakers, made me feel more at home.  Great food, music, service, and company.  You really can't ask for more than that.

We also divided the check five ways, and the waiter took care of us.  This was also appreciated by all of us.  Some out there may not think this is a nice request, but, so you know, the waiter did not act surprised, and he handled it nicely.

So, in my book, there is a reason to return, but I'll just have to save my dinner dollars for another trip to Las Vegas, and I'll definitely have to be with my wife.  I want to enjoy the dinner guilt free.  You?  You should save your money and go enjoy this place.  It doesn't get better, but try to take the most important person in your life with you...

2279382,2011-10-29,0,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"After my last conversation with the junior manager at the restaurant, I promised I would write an accurate review: here it is. With so many great steakhouses in Vegas, skip this one and go anywhere else. I found my experience there to be a ""used car lot"" of steak houses. They sold items I didnt want -hard. For instance I ordered the filet, but the waiter said ""for only 20 dollars more each, you can have the Fiorentina."" I didnt want it, I had to fight to have what i wanted for dinner, and he wouldnt take no for an answer. That was the story of the entire meal: trying to upsell us on every aspect of the meal, including the Chamomile Grappa. I looked around, and this was the story at ever table, with every waiter. Maybe they work on commission? 

To add insult to injury, due to an error on their part, restaurant agreed to comp 2 drinks -as they took over 20 minutes to get our table. In my haste to make a show, I didnt ask for an itemized receipt and trusted the waiter. After the fact, requested the receipt and the drinks had magically reappeared, despite the staff's promises. Like I said - a used car lot. 2 stars because the food was very good. The staff and service leaves everything to be desired. There is nothing here that is better than any other steak house, and there is a lot that is worst than most steak houses in terms of service. Meal was $360 for 2 including fraudulently added drinks.

I also have worked as a waitress in my life so I am usually very forgiving and understanding when it comes to service... but this was just pathetic. There were three of us being taken to dinner by a work colleague. Our check was over $600 without tip which would be fine if the service and food were on point- but to pay that much to sit and wait until YOU HAVE TO GET A MANAGER JUST TO TAKE YOUR DRINK ORDER is freaking outrageous. Thats something I would expect at IHOP, not a Mario Batali restaurant.

You would think that after we spoke to the manager the service would have improved, however aside from the sommelier no one was attentive on any level and again we waited an extraordinary amount of time to get our food order taken.

 The sides were good, but nothing I couldn't get somewhere else with better service. We both split a bone in steak ... it was $80 a person to split a steak. They carve these steaks table side which is pretty neat. Maybe they think that bit of flare will make up the fact that you just paid $160 for a steak it took you 45 minutes to order (they were wrong) The steaks were nothing special- much prefer Maestros Ocean club for this caliber of steak house. I have also been to many less expensive steakhouses in vegas that have better steak and much better service.
 
We also got the caprese salad which was good,  orecchiette was good, corn and mashed potatoes were also good, but when we were done again the plates sat and sat on the table until we had to ask someone to come clear them away. The service was so poor that it became the repeat topic of dinner conversation, and really put a damper on an otherwise lovely evening. 

When the check came I was embarrassed for the person paying who had tried to take us all for a nice evening. His plan had gone awry but still had the very large bill to pay  that I just happened to get a glimpse of. 

This place needs to get itself together. I mean really - if you are asking people to pay $150 per person you need to take care of them. Going out to dinner anywhere is as much about the experience as it is the food, and there are so many other places here in vegas to go that have both amazing service and fantastic food that there is no reason for me to return to Carnevino or tell any of my friends to visit. In fact I will be doing just the opposite. In the end there was absolutely nothing memorable except for the terrible service and a very bloated (even by fancy steakhouse standards) bill.

On to the pasta which was the corn ravioli which was passable.  The big problem was the meat.  The rib eye for one which is carved table side and is $90, was so fatty as to be almost inedible.

But why this place offers no one else can duplicate -  they serve their mouthwatering over the top steaks with great Italian food! I had tagliatelle con tartufo spinach with mine.

Carnevino set the perfect scene for our Christmas Day 2009 family dinner inside The Palazzo.  We had a 8:30 reservation and were seated within minutes of checking in with the maitre d'.

Upon entering the restaurant, we were welcomed with friendly faces and greetings from the staff and charmed by the restaurant's decor --- modern, but incorporated the masculine touches of a traditional steakhouse. The extensive presentation of dark woods everywhere was softened with dim ambient lighting and vanilla drape curtains flanking all the windows. The only real quirk I have is that the restaurant is open into the casino which kind of kills the upscale vibe in the dining room.

Started off with the house bread (your basic run-of-the-mill sourdough fare) that came with pork-fat spread and of course, butter.

Insalata Caprese ($18): We ordered this as an appetizer to split between us four ways...wanting to balance out our diet with some greens. F*cking TINY. Even if it weren't shared between four people. Four small pieces of heirloom tomatoes with basil and seemingly really not much else accompanying it on the plate. Tasty, but really? $18?? Skip this.

Big Eye Tuna 'Crudo' ($21): Some cuts of tuna sashimi glazed with a light pesto & honey saffron. I enjoyed it. Not spectacular though. I'd pass this up as well.

Sauteed mixed mushrooms with Cipollini onions ($9): Nice little side order that gave our main courses a little variety in flavor.

Spaghetti ai fruitti di mare ($26): My sister ordered this. Your typical Italian spaghetti dish soaked in a seafood broth, with a bunch of steamed crustaceans piled on top. They really didn't skimp with the shellfish. Tons of clams, shrimp, scallops, and even a huge lobster claw. I tasted some of it...not my thing. These seafood pasta dishes are generally too bland for my tastes.

'La Fiorentina' / Florentine Porterhouse: ($140): We split this ""porterhouse for 2"" between my father, mother and myself. Granted, the slab of meat was quite massive when they brought it out, but by the time it was cut table-side, and plated, we realized there wasn't really that much steak at all (that big bone had to have been half the mass), and the meat was already getting cold. The flavors were good...nice texture, slightly charred, juicy...however some parts were slightly overcooked beyond our request for its ""medium"" preparation.

The service is outstanding.  Our server was super friendly, was very on-key with making sure our dining experience was going smoothly and even hooked up a tasty appetizer treat at the start of our meal and presented to us a complimentary dessert plate at the close of our meal, even though we told him we couldn't possibly shove anymore food down our throats.

All in all, Carnevino wasn't bad.  But given its very steep menu pricing, I would not suggest this restaurant if you're looking for a steak dinner without feeling robbed.

Couple of other notes: The 'La Fiorentina' porterhouse is for two people at $70 PER PERSON for a total of $140. The menu is really tricky in that it doesn't have $140, but lists it $70. So if you're not reading the menu carefully like we did, it can come off as a bit misleading.

First, don't skip the bar... not for the decor, but for the home made cheese straws that are baked each day.  They are friggin great.  The meal began with some shared appetizers; baby arugula salad, home made salumi plate with proscuitto made by Mario's father, and calamari.  All were delicious.  My boss and I split the bone-in ribeye for two which was carved tableside.  This steak was dry aged 6 weeks and cooked to perfection (slightly under medium rare, but not rare).  My only complaint was the lack of values on the wine list.  Seriously Mario, you place hundreds of Italian wines on the menu, and only a handful are under $100 a bottle?  These obscure libations are more respectable when guests can afford more than one bottle.  I ordered a L'Adventure from Paso Robles for $80 which drank well.",mCtbnY3HVLUmb91ADNPczQ,0,0,5,jRKY1pjCKCRl0NJ5Nmq_5Q

Enjoyed the rosemary bread with lardo. Ate too much of it and skipped the appetizers. I recommend having a Fernet Branca to ease the stomach at this point.

On to the main - double rib eye, Chicago style. Pleased to say that after a not so pleasant intro to the restaurant, the wait staff was spot on. He brings out the small cow, lets us appreciate it, and carves it before us. Piles it onto our plates, and remnants of the bone into the centre of the table.

I've eaten at a lot of steakhouses, while in terms of location, decor etc Carnevino is not my favourite. In terms of the actual steak - Pretty hard to beat. It was that good. Melted in your mouth.

At end of meal, waiter then comped us some Nonino Amaro - which he wanted us to try (we had been talking Italian bitters earlier on). Amazing.",0CndvHiC0IZ0jKZ_9tSVPA,3,4,4,rrY61AW3QzJk_Ape5h5PPg
2332119,2013-10-03,0,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"Carnevino is a good steakhouse.

The one thing I did notice that the waiters did a good job at was the art of ""upselling"" which wasn't necessarily coercion or strong armed but a somewhat continual, not necessarily aggressive, but reminders of the fixe menue higher priced items and the ""per person"" (so, to some if you see $80 for a steak but don't read the ""per person"" you might actually be better off with the $60 steak on your own than sharing one for $160).  So, the service was friendly, and attentive, but I just thought, knowing the restaurant business, the staff are trained to route patrons to raise the AOV (average order value) per customer, and the efforts seemed apparent, 'tho not in an offensive way, more in an obvious subtle way of them just doing their job.

For that reason, I'd say the food is excellent and deserves * * * * for sure, it's right up there with CUT, Delmonico's, Prime, SW, and the rest of the high end steakhouses in Las Vegas.

But, I think in terms of the pricing and value, I'd take the rating down a notch.  If Yelp allowed 1/2 stars, I'd make this a 3.5 - - and granted my rating system is where:

 ""* * *"" (three star) is GOOD, solid and nice, even recommend or come back to
 ""* * * *"" (four star) is GREAT, that I'd highly recommend to others
""* * * * *"" (five star)  is a knock your socks off totally AWESOME, 
* *"" (two star)  is merely Okay, but still not bad and I'd go back to again.
""*"" (one star) is given where something outright offended me, usually based on service and a lack of effort.  

So, Carnevino is good, bordering on great.

The venue is nice at the Palazzo.  I generally love the area of The Venetian, Palazzo, Encore and Wynn.  The restaurant itself has a good vibe to it, not too loud or crowded feeling.

I had the Porterhouse to share.  The fillet portion was pretty small, and the New York side was good.  I sort of felt or speculated for the $160 for 2, I could have actually eaten the entire steak myself for 1, and we may have been better off ordering separately the NY and the Filet Mignon for either a lower cost or a bigger portion (maybe not dry aged to the bone as the marketing hype machine says, but I'm sure tasty nonetheless).",Vkj42md-5O3VoOD9pBg6Sw,1,0,3,IaJxxa4NNIavYzoo0WCTmg

A glass of wine went well with our entr√©e, the thousand pound 90 day aged ribeye steak. Thank God they insisted the thing was for two people. The cheesy mashed potatoes with the poached egg on top was a unnecessary accompaniment. 

There was no room for dessert, too bad they had Tiramisu (inside joke). It was an excellent meal.

The bread is served with not only butter, but also cured lardo. Cheese fritters, almost like gougeres, are served before the meal.  And we were delighted to find that they had several different vintages of our favorite wine - Solaia, from the Antinori vineyard we visited on our honeymoon - on the list.

We decided to go with something we had not seen anywhere else before - the beef tasting menu. Four courses of beef - what could be wrong with that? Nothing, as it turns out.

First course - wagyu beef (think Kobe) served raw in a crudo with olive oil, vinegar, coriander, and saffron, topped with fennel. This was elegant and complex - the bright hits of saffron and the warm nuttiness from the coriander lent an exotic feel to a traditionally Italian dish

Second course (a favorite from the whole trip) - beef cheek ravioli. Savory and satisfying slow cooked meat inside perfect pasta (this IS a Batali restaurant, after all), finished with a balsamic aged so long it has become thick and sweet - perfection.

Third course - a wet aged beef served with a breaded quail egg and deliciously garlicky spinach. I love beef paired with egg, so I was very happy here.

Fourth course - dry aged beef with Bearnaise. I didn't particularly care for the potatoes that accompanied this course, but the beef was excellent. Because of the tasting, we had the chance to compare wet and dry aged beef directly which was very interesting. We felt that there was more of a textural difference than a flavor difference.

On to the desserts - I had the the vanilla semifreddo that was listed on the menu; served with pistachio rum sauce and extremely fresh strawberries.  My husband told the server that he preferred chocolate, and the pastry chef made a flourless chocolate cake with raspberries for him.

The first two courses were far better than the two main courses, so I would recommend Carnevino for Italian inspired dishes (like the crudo) and fabulous pasta.",20eY1PQ--P5GZKG1u_JIQQ,0,0,5,lNE2aOW_P3ey5W0ogXH41Q
2444549,2010-10-13,0,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"I've been to Carne Vino several times now. I don't know why, well, yes, I do, it's for the bread sticks. They're to die for. If you want to have a drink and don't mind paying more than almost anywhere else on Earth, then by all means stop in and enjoy. I rationalize that it's just the price of having those crack-like bread sticks.

That's really where my love for this place ends though. Just a word about price. Here's an example of how insane the prices are. I went in for lunch last week (and bread sticks) and the house special was $40 for  two drinks and a tuna sandwich. If you just wanted the tuna sandwich it was $19, and I believe the burger was $20. I'll admit that I've had $120 burgers in Europe, so it's not the most expensive, but for what you get (I sat for 30 minutes in an empty bar and the bartender never returned to take my order) it's just not worth it.

First time in, we all had steaks. The quality of the meat was definitely far behind other steakhouses like the Palm over at Caesar's, SW Steakhouse, Delmonico's, Del Frisco's and the others we've tried here. Overly fatty and tough. It's always possible that you just go on a bad night, so I never write a place off because of one so-so experience.

So, we went again and my wife and I had the carpaccio (it was okay, just nothing to write home about) and I don't even remember the entrees. I just remember that both of us kept marveling throughout the meal at the prices vs. the quality, particularly in light of what you get for lower prices at the other restaurants in Vegas, even in the same hotel (Palazzo has equal and better food at Woo (now closed), Cut (amazingly good) and Table 10 to name just a few.

Save yourself some money and visit one of those other places where you'll get better food for less money, or for about the same money (at Cut) just better food and service.",MOcQx-Mh70Ry3aMV8jccew,0,0,2,VRN8181B01cly6VxGHiXNg

-----------ORIGINAL------------
I've eaten here twice, about 18 months apart. Both times, I noted that the ribeye was one of the best steaks I've ever enjoyed.

A couple days ago, I took my dad and my roommate here for dinner. They seated us despite sandals, caps, and general raggedness, as we'd spent the whole day moving to a new condo. Service was impeccable and friendly. Most notably, the timing of the servers' trips to the table was flawless. My dad and I shared a ribeye for two with black pepper horseradish sauce, while my roommate had an 8oz filet mignon with the same sauce. We all shared sides of Romana beans and Tuscan fries. Everything was amazing.

My roommate and I got beers, of which they have a nice selection of imports, but my dad stuck with water, having to drive back to LA right after dinner.

All dishes were excellent. They did, however, play an entire Rolling Stones album during the meal. That was fairly annoying.
-------------------------------------

Ah yes. I have now eaten here three times, another shortly after the recount above. I took both of my parents and my roommate back only a couple months later, and had another fantastic meal. Even fewer little details to complain about this time.

My mom is allergic to cow's milk, so sometimes it's a challenge for a restaurant to avoid all dishes with butter or milk used in any stage of the prep - especially butter. But this place handled it marvelously, customizing everything for her with no issues. And the server immediately understood what her request was, which is a rare mark of quality in our experience.

Yet again, this meal was tremendous. We did order red wine this time around, which, in my opinion, is just-about imperative at a nice steakhouse. Unfortunately, they didn't have my favorite Spanish red in stock, but the sommelier reccomended a very nice and affordable bottle that we all enjoyed.

I'm rambling. This steakhouse kicks serious butt. Every side is classic, rustic, and delicious. Never too salty, sweet, cheesy, or anything strong enough to take away from the relatively subtle flavors of aged steaks. The wine and beer selections are top-notch. Service is immaculate. And the steaks...you'd contemplate killing your best friend to get one of their steaks on your plate.

But man...the music. It's consistently annoying. It's probably just me and there are probably a lot of people who either don't notice or enjoy it, so I'm not making much of a point about it. But I am docking a star.

Highly recommended!",3w-Mto6hHy5XxXO163bHTg,2,0,4,YD-VTZ_DioJ2rBVm5UrLYg

We had our annual guys trip to vegas and we always try to visit a different steak house every time we visit.  This year was Carnevino.  We were surprised in order to order a ribeye or porterhouse, TWO people had to order it.  We found it a bit odd but we had no problems with it.   We found it even more odd the waiter suggested we have the steaks family style (they cut up the meat and put it on a plate for people to share).   Anyways, a bunch us order different cuts of meat.  NY Strip, Filet Mignon and the folks that wanted porterhouse or ribeye's paired up.   So when the steaks finally arrived, I got my NY strip and the folks that got the Ribeye or Porterhouse had to share ONE steak for two people!?!!?  WTF?  The size of the steak was a serving for one at any other steakhouse (Cut, Delmonico's,  BOA).   We felt basically we were paying $130 for ONE ribeye.   The meat was definitely tasty but not outstanding where they can charge double the price.   Let's just say we'll never come back to Carnevino when we hit Vegas again.

The items we tried was the beef tartar...which I loved with the toasted bread.  Another must dish is the fruiti de mari....either it be an antipasta or a full meal.  The sauce was amazing...it came with amazing huge lobster tail in half and shrimp, calimari, and clams...it was so delicious..the sauce was most memorable.  It was like eating lobster bisque with pasta..it wasen't just your regular tomato sauce from a jar...it has a seafoodish flavor to it to pair well with the shellfish it came with.  

We also shared the 8oz. filet mignon which was served perfectly medium and also came with table service where they sliced the meat into pieces for us and presented it beautifully.  

We also had the arugala salad which was probably the worst thing we got from this place...it was so acidic, you had to eat lots of cheese to balance the acidity it had on it....we complained to the waiter but all he could do was notify the chef about it....what a sucker.  not there greatest decision there from a waiters point of view.....they could have taken it off the receipt for use...especially since it was the cheapest thing we ordered....and it was quite acidic and discusting. 

We had no room for desert and ate everything else.  Glad we didn't waste any food.  Great 3 meals out of 4 .

Oh yeah...after the waiter cuts your meat and ask to add rock salt to your meat...don't do it!!!  just ask for it on the side and taste the meat first before you he does that.  just a safety measure for HTN and salty tongue ppl.  :P",n9DJHwgYflQ_ms8gBU37Wg,2,0,4,E3q9WEUxzOgLBA4NkIk6uw

We followed it with the pappardelle, gnocchi (omg! So good!), agnolini, and garganelli. For our main course we had the ribeye and New York strip with the potatoes, spinach, mushrooms, and cauliflower (also great!). The steaks were beautifully presented and cut table side, but overall they were cooked too rare for our taste. Even after discussing our preferences with the waiter.

For our wine selection we had the 2010 Barbaresco Montestefano. It was a fair choice for the foods we had with it, but paired phenomenally with the brie.

The restaurant has a nice atmosphere.  A huge window towards the back to overlook the strip.  In the middle of the room is a large wine table.  

For appetizers we ordered:
**CARNE CRUDA ALLA PIEMONTESE
chopped to order Steak Tartare with raw mushrooms.
--My friend LOVES this dish,  for me, it was ok.  I don't eat raw beef that often unless I'm in Canada, but this was ok.  Not too memorable for me.
**GRILLED OCTOPUS
pickled vegetables and limoncello
--This dish was my favorite.  The minute you bite into it there's a shot of flavor that goes into your mouth.  
**FRIED CALAMARI
marinara and pickled hot peppers
--You can never go wrong with fried calamari

For the Entrees we ordered:
**BLACK FETTUCINE
crab, jalapenos, and shallots
--I've never seen black fettucine and I tried a bit from my friend's plate.  It was very flavorful.  I definitely want to go back and try a full plate
**TORTELLONI
lobster and tarragon
--This was a delicious dish as well.  This and the black fettucine itself would be a reason for me to come back
**DRY AGED BONE IN RIBEYE (Medium Rare)
--This thing is huge.  They first show you as a whole, and then cut it table side.  They put the bone on the side and explain that it's the meat is very sweet on the bone
**FILET MIGNON
--You're typical filet mignon

For our sides we ordered:
**ROASTED BEETS WITH PISTACHIOS AND GORGONZOLA
**SAUTEED BRUSSELS SPROUTS WITH PANCETTA
**ROASTED SHIITAKES WITH ACETO BALSAMICO
**ITALIAN BROCCOLI WITH HOUSE SMOKED PORK 

All the sides were delicious and complimented what we ordered.  

Dessert:  
**SORBETTI:  QUINCE, BLOOD ORANGE, PEAR
--I loved all 3 flavors.  Quince tasted a little like apple sauce, blood orange and pear was just refreshing after a heavy meal

So overall the food was great, service.....well that could've used some improvement.  We had to wave down the server a few times, which didn't make me happy.  When he first approached our table to take our order, one of my friends asked him a question and he excused himself and didn't come back for a while.  Later on, when we asked for our bill (after waving him down again) my friends brought it to his attention that they had made it clear it was my birthday when they made the reservations.  We also noticed that one of my friends didn't get the 'VANILLA BEAN AFFOGATO' he ordered.  Instead it appeared the waiter ordered an americano.  The waiter tried to rectify the situation by bringing out a DARK CHOCOLATE CAKE w/ vanilla huckleberries + a candle.  The dessert was delicious, but sort of ruined my refreshing dessert I had ordered previously.  

As my friend Duke says, bad service I can tolerate, but I can't tolerate bad food.   So Carnevino, you're lucky your food is oh so good lol.  I will be returning to try the black fettucine + tortellini.",0CRdDT9v9kNDDQ69AIqwZA,3,2,3,901HapWiNpsLB12UHkEdyA

1.  Be prepared for the hard sell!  The servers are knowledgeable and friendly but they've definitely been trained to get you to rack it up.  They'd try to shave truffles and pair a lobster tail with your glass of water if they could.  If you want to keep your bill in this solar system (barely), be prepared to stand your ground.
2.  You'll notice that there's almost no bottles of wine on the big list that are sub $100.  Look at the wine by the glass menu and you and most of those bottles are available for $40-$90.
3.  On your way out get matches!  I love collecting restaurant matches and these are just about the best one's i've ever gotten.  It's a huge, stylish case of matches, I can't even call it a box.

Starting with the positives, our server Corey was fantastic. He gave great food recommendations, and answered all the questions I had on the menu. The petite East Coast oysters were so tasty, and the grilled octopus as Corey recommended was phenomenal. 

We ordered the dry age ribeye with grilled shrimp and had potatoes for sides. The table side service was a really nice touch. The food was decent but I expected more than decent when the steak is 75 per person without add-ons. 

The potatoes were tasty but it was dry, so we tried to find someone to get sauces. It took us a while but we finally found a female server and asked her if we could get sauces, she replied ""Yes you can, just ask your server."" and just turned her head immediately and walked back to her station on the other side of the room.

It tasted like butter, foie gras, and aged cheese all in one bite.  This steak was so good.  However it was so rich.  I would suggest sharing this steak among 2-3 people and ordering other cuts of steak.  But, since I am a steak-freak, I ate it all by myself and loved it.  I will go back in April or August to eat this again.

I also tried the 90 day dry-aged New York Steak.  This cut was more meaty and was nice.  I like more marbling on my steak, but for those who prefer more meat, then this is the cut for you.

However, there was a large group & service was really suffering. The table next to us waited forever for their check & were notably angry, since they were rushing to catch a show afterwards.

The herb bread was okay, but could have been fresher. They gave us a cheese puff amuse bouche, which was nice and warm.

We split a large bone in rib eye ($152 for 2 people), which was plenty of meat. It was really flavorful even with the simple presentation. Table side carving & just a pinch of Maldon salt, a little drizzle of olive oil. We got it medium rare, which was a bit chewy. Medium might have been better for this cut. Keep in mind DH prefers his beef rare 'n' bloody, but that's not the best for rib eye. ""It was a great steak, but it wasn't that much better than a $50 steak. But I'd be willing to go back to try the Riserva."" says DH.

The citrus cauliflower side ($12) was surprisingly good. Nice, rich flavor.

We also got a glass of red wine, Brunello di Montalcino, for $27. They forgot to bring it out with our steak & we had to remind them. Grrrrrrrr.

DH finished his meal with an affogato ($6) which was well executed.

Overall, it was a good meal, but pricey. Service was very spotty for a nice restaurant. Unless they have the Riserva, really not that different from a nice steak house anywhere else.",CXl9uMlh4PTold4MxVku2g,6,2,4,IyPtaPP_SxZ0X6XFkMzcMQ

We were a party of six, big winners from a night of Vegas Sports Gambling, and we just wanted to sit down for a nice meal. It was a disaster from the start, and we should have just walked out... Our table did have a couple of people with food allergies that we made known to our waiter, who didn't seem to care much, and it showed when he brought out our Very Pricey food! He didn't try to remedy the situation, and when we finally spoke with the manager, he didn't do much to take care of things, and the food, was just okay.... Way Overpriced!!

2535714,2010-12-25,0,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"Ate at Carnevino on a Wednesday night (December 15th) with four other adults. The meal and experience were excellent with the following exceptions. The prices were a bit high and the portion sizes smaller than at other high-end Italian restaurants and steak houses. Think of the place as a good-quality European restaurant and you won't be disappointed. If you expect the prices and serving sizes of a typical Las Vegas restaurant, you may be disappointed.

Having said that, we all agreed it was an exceptional and very enjoyable dinner (and one in our party is a formally trained Chef.) We were not rushed; the food, drinks, desserts, wine and drinks were top notch as was the service. They have a sommelier who was very helpful without being ""snooty.""

One warning - the excellent bread rolls are served both with containers of butter and a pork fat spread (? a traditional Italian item.) The fat spread is a bit greasy and certainly an acquired taste.

All of the pasta dishes we tried were excellent, especially the Spago with lamp ragu. All of the pastas are priced as appetizer sized portions (for $15 - $30.) Don't expect large servings but all were excellent. We ordered several and shared bites. For 15.00, any of the pastas can be ordered as an entr√©e. I had the Puttanesca pasta (a favorite of mine.) It had clearly been under the heat lamp, so the surface was a bit dried and I had to stir it a bit. It was also under cooked and I almost sent it back. Our resident chef said it was in acceptable limits, so I didn't.

Two in our party split the New York Strip steak. At $54.00, it seemed overpriced, but it was extremely good - better than many other steak houses I go to (e.g. Ruth's Chris, Eddie V's, etc.) We all shared two desserts - the apple fritters and maple panna cotta. Both were excellent, as they should be at ~$16 per serving.

One final warning - all coffee is espresso based - so don't expect free refills. My request for ""decaf"" coffee was served as a decaf Caf√© Americano. They have no pots of brewed coffee. An extra cup would have cost me an extra Caf√© Americano.

All in all, we had an excellent dinner. The serving sizes were adequate and expensive, but all in all worth it for a special occasion.",0z_xo6QA3FTnHub0t3G9kA,0,0,4,ZwevK68d-A1cu8gb4W4Zew

The steak came with nothing....no sides of any sort.  So then I spent $36 on mediocre cauliflower & salad.  We had to remind our waiter 3 times for our drinks.  They ended up coming out right before I dinner.  The food we just BAD.the service was extremely poor.  He was a nice guy, but seemed to have too many tables & was completely unforgettable.

My husband and I were here celebrating an anniversary, and had a fabulous time. The decor is open and airy, and not stuffy. There was rock music playing lightly in the background, and gave off a fun vibe. This is a Steakhouse, that also serves all the homemade pasta dishes that Mario is famous for, but the meat is the star of the show here. My husband and I got the rib eye for two, and I don't think I will ever have a  better prepared steak than here. They carve it table-side, and present it artfully on your plate.  The rib eye comes with this huge Flintstone size bone attached,  and they encourage you to gnaw on the giant bone.  I couldn't help but do it, since they suggested it.  Kind of a fun thing to do at a fancy restaurant. The second the wait staff saw me doing this, they brought over a perfectly steamed cloth with a lemon and a sprig of rosemary for me to wash my face.  Nice touch! The steak was crispy on the outside, and perfectly cooked on the inside. Salty, yummy, and incredibly decadent. We also ordered appetizers, and sides that were all delicious, but for this carnivore, the steak could have been the appetizer, main course, and dessert, all in one.

I've been at least 5 times now, every year for my birthday, and once for Thanksgiving. The finest meats, the dreamiest wine list, the best ambiance in LV - I LOVE going to Las Vegas, but really crave those restaurants, bars and hotels that don't Scream the city to me - Carnevino and The Palazzo is just that - an oasis. 

The Ribeye for 2 - perfection, the pork chop, wonderful - this time we had the Bison, it was great, and splurges with some white truffle on our pasta starter. I'm a food writer and chef and a HUGE SNOB when it comes to fine dining. I dream of Carnevino, and truthfully, cannot imagine going every time, when I hit Vegas. 

We went to Bouchon this time, in the Venetian - I've been to the Bouchon in Napa, in Beverly Hills and now Vegas - wonderful and I'm a huge fan of Mr. Keller's. But I dream of Carnevino.... I'm obsessed.

It was a 2 top very close to the tables on either side of us.  It was uncomfortable and didn't help the mood.  I understand that we were 2 people and they weren't going to waste a bigger table on us but a little more room between tables would have went a long way.  We started with a caesar salad, ricotta and egg raviolo, beef cheek ravioli and gnocchi genovese.  I was excited for the pastas but they weren't amazing.  I know this is a steakhouse but it is Mario Batali.  For our main course we split the bone in rib eye for two and had mascarpone & guanciale mashed potatoes and brussel sprouts as our sides.  The main course and sides were outstanding.  They made up for the pasta.  Lesson learned.  For dessert we got the chocolate and peanut butter torte and a white chocolate mousse with berries.  The torte was rich and the mousse was light.  It was a perfect ending.  Service was spotty.  I expect excellent service at this price point.  Our server didn't know anything about specials I had seen on instagram earlier in the day and thought it was funny I knew more then him.  I don't think the drink I ordered was what I got.  But that could be a bartender issue.  Food was brought out when we weren't done with what we already had and there wasn't room on our tiny table.

Long story short, I'm a Batali fan because of Lupa (see my review). Walked by Carnevino took look at the menu and started chatting it up with Chris and Nancy. They convinced me to stay a bit longer in Vegas and take the first dinner seating.

""I don't want to see a menu; bring it on.""

Courses:
Amuse bouche - fried cheese balls. A bit salty, but who doesn't love fried cheese? (Carpene Maltovi Prosecco - I LOVE YOU)
1 - Lobster sashimi style with fried claw, fried lobster mousse, etc. The lobster was EXCELLENT. I've never had lobster prepared that way, and I'm a fan. (Bastianich Tocai Plus - I LOVE YOU - Best wine of the evening)
2 - Black (squid ink dyed) fettuccini - Fantastic preparation. Perfectly al dente and had balanced flavors. I could have eaten a huge bowl of it, but more courses were on their way. (Remoissenet Meursault)
3 - Fish - AHH!! I can't find it on their online menu so I can't give you all the details, HOWEVER it was very well prepared had a nice sear on the outside, soft and flaky inside. The sauce was a touch too sweet. 
4 - Ribeye served tableside. Not a huge steak fan (I know... I'm at a steakhouse!) but I enjoyed it. Sides of riced potatoes (oversalted) and mushrooms came out as well.
5 - Dessert - first was a sorbetto and then fried chocolate balls. What's not to love?

2621026,2008-04-03,1,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"MARIO!!!!!!

We went here because it had Mario's name on it and was recommended as a better option to (Emeril's) Delmonico's by the super foodie general manager at B&B Ristorante - Lori.  She evangelized the incredible care and selection the meats choices when through to arrive at the table.  I also thought what does this 90lb wet little woman know about eating slabs of meat?!  But I did not want to eat at Del's again and this place was close.  And I have not put something of Mario's in my mouth that I did not think was a cut above.

We start at the bar.  It is a nice area in an average location just off the slot machines.  Sit at the bar and not at a table or you will have the oh so pleasant, ""CHING, CHING, CHING, WHEEL of FORTUNE ringing you your head forever.

The bartender was very friendly and helpful - Steve.  We started with about 5 liters of Lurisia sparkling water - my all time favorite bottled water.  We wanted some tiny (alcoholic) bubbles so opted for the Processco.  Steve recommended we go for the magnum size as it was a better value - and BOY did it look cool.

We thought the wait might be an hour, so we went right into the apps.  Steak Tartare (or Cannibal Mount as it is called in Joy of Cooking - yikes!) was very well made; I would have like a piece of toast to host and scoop it up.

And the second thing we ordered....queue the angels music...AAHHHHHAAAAHHHHH...HOLY FFFFFFF! We had this absolutely insanely incredible lobster crudo (Italian sushi-style raw fish).  It was like sweet, soft, creamy butter with a light lobstery goodness.  It was one of the best things I have ever put in my mouth!  I will probably remember it the rest of my life.  And I am not a big lobster fan - usually overcooked and sauced and priced for me in comparison to what else I can get for the money.

Next we head to our table.

Service was great. We had about 5 people waiting on us at one time or another.  The atmosphere was a bit ""old boys club"" my hot little friend said.  There were a bunch of suits in there, but it was kind of what I was expecting from a Vegas meat house.

We started with three small servings of different pastas for the 5 of us.  They were all pretty good.  I still can not explain why I bother to ever buy anything with Dungeness crab in it in a restaurant. I am nutz.  I love the crab and usually just buy it up the street and cook them up and feast.  Restaurants ALWAYS try and make the crab something special by ADDING flavors - sauces, etc.  There is no need. It is already the best crab in the US!  I once again got a crab and black pasta dish and was disappointed.  DUH.  The other two - a SPAGO - with lamb ragu and burnt butter & ricotta raviolis were a bit salty - they know it and are working on it.

To the meats of CARNEVINO!  The steaks were incredible!  My colleagues order a table side carved ribeye for two and the girls shared a fillet, so I had to order - dare I say - a 20oz veal chop! I was not paying for it and do not have any hangup about eating.  It was incredible!  Melt in my mouth sweet baby love!  Their steaks were perfectly cooked and incredible.  This place definitely knows its meat.

The two Soms that helped us were very knowledgeable and asked great questions to help aid & lead my less wine knowledgeable friends around the list.  And there was the wine list - HOLY F.  I have not seen a more overpriced and unapproachable list!  Everything started at $150 and really was not interesting until $250 and went to average $500, up to $4200 LOL!

My recommendation - stick to the great by the glass and you can afford to enjoy the dinner.  Or order the mag of Processco and call it good.",nsnFc5dcAVliG3X1yS5Mdw,3,1,3,xAZUhQqOlClCwB9TzKM0rQ

My gf and I had the aged rib-eye for two. The steak, taste-wise was one of the better steaks Ive ever had. And yes, I love steakhouses and have been to many, so I have experience to compare. We asked for medium-rare plus, it came out medium-rare minus. I thought it was a good touch that they carved it for you tableside, however, I did notice they left a lot of meat on the bone, and I would have liked those tasty morsels. I have a feeling they do that to make stock.

My gf really enjoys the cheese puff thing they brought out ""compliments of the chef."" By far, my favorite dish was the gnocci and bolognese. Outstanding.

My biggest disappointment was the server. While very pleasant, and for the most part attentive, he led us slightly astray. We like to take our time with fine dining and space out our courses. He strongly recommended (to the point it would have been awkward to decline) that it was the chefs desire to put in our whole order and he would inform them we wanted to go slower. Well, wouldnt you know it, as soon as one plate was cleared, the next course arrived. Im sure they are pushed to do that so they can get the tables rotated as quickly as possible for more turn around, however, our reservation was at 9 pm and the restaurant was starting to empty by the time we were done. There was no reason to rush us through when there was no one for our table afterwards. It was really annoying.

I would go back again just for the bolognese, but I would like to try just a regular NY cut instead of the fancy rib-eye for two that wasnt worth the extra money to me. The problem I have is that there are so many great restaurants in Vegas that the small things that went wrong make it hard for me to justify going back when there are other places to try. My gf loved the place, so if she insists we go back I wouldnt be upset, but she is like me and likes trying new places.

If youre a foodie, it is definitely worth a trip to try it. As I said, I wouldnt argue against going back, and if I try all the places I want to try, I would do it on my own as I liked it better than most of the other high-end steakhouses Ive been to.

Nestled between three (no four, no six) of my most favorite things (craps, blackjack, the schlots, and the strip bitches)is Carnevino, tucked under the back escalators of The Palazzo . 

With high ceilings, huge windows, and an intimate, darker settling, Mario Batali has cooked up some of the best food I've have ever had. EVER! I repeat EVER! Carnevino is a must have on my list every time I visit my home away from home, the city of sin. 

With delicious starters, like petite fried cheeseballs delicately wrapped in a napkin with amazingly fresh butter, your palate begins to sing while reading the menu. The fresh mozzarella with heirloom tomato salad was incredible. The cheese had flavor I haven't had since Italy. The olive oil by itself was flavorful, delicate, rich, but didn't overpower anything. The basil was perfect and aromatic beyond belief.

And then came the pasta. Parpardelle with porcini mushrooms with a fresh reggiano grated on top that was to die for. Perfectly al dente, with amazing texture and flavor, I ate until I thought I would throw up, literally. 

His steak, the larger fillet mignon was done to perfection, black and blue. Beautiful and pink in the inside, charred on the outside, plated, alone on a large white plate. Nothing, just the steak of perfection, seated, alone. You can choose a variety of sauces to come with the meat, he, choosing after my favorites, opted for the black truffle sauce. We expected a flavored truffle oil, but no, a full gravy sized dish came, laden with amazing petite pieces of black truffle, all nestled at the bottom. When he looked left, I dug into the sauce with my spoon, and it was true. They were pieces of truffle, no essence, not shavings, but pieces. I was in heaven. I could die now, or maybe after I make 50K at craps first. 

We were too full, and couldn't eat anymore, but our server, who I have had many times, recommended the pumpkin doughnuts. Anyone who knows me can answer the question, ""If Danielle had 24 hours to live, what would she eat?"" and answer with confidence, ""Doughnuts"". Is that your final answer? Well, maybe doughnuts and truffles, but separately of course.

The tiny doughtnut hole sized bites were fried pieces of perfection. Crispy, covered with sugar and cinnamon, with a thick, rich pumpkin interior. It was like the best pumpkin pie you've ever had, on crack, mixed with a doughnut. Amazing! It took twenty minutes to get up from the table after that.

But craps was calling me, and you know what I'm like when I gamble. I only stop to pee, drink, smoke, and eat, at Carnevino of course.",lOMM7HTHhabi1qofd-w7zw,10,8,5,Rqe4ik8gAmBYYg5BxpFs8Q
2658047,2012-10-08,0,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"Carnevino is a place that's trying to be over the top, a spectacle in Vegas. It largely delivers - we enjoyed our special occasion dinner - but sometimes it misses... expensively.

The space is large, with tall ceilings, dimly lit.  You are greeted by a pretty bar area flanked by a huge bull statue.  Holy Batali, those are some enormi sferi!

Drinks are Vegas-pricey, but extraordinarily professionally prepared by the likes of Josh.  ""Proper"" is a word to describe the bar and its drinks.

We were seated this evening in a semi private mini-room, just big enough for our table of eight to be secluded but happy.  We could see the large space, the main dining room, and could hear the interesting mix of music piped into that room.  Like some others have mentioned I thought the music alternately memorable and sometimes out-of-place. Occasionally the music was too loud and too forward, and other times a perfect hip accompaniment to a fine dinner.  Overall, the physical presence and visual/aural experience of Carnevino is impressive:  trendy, cool and comfortable.

The wine list is extensive and expensive.  While there are some sub-$100 bottles you should expect to pay well north of that if you are any kind of a wine fancier.  Italian wines are featured, of course, and we swished a solid Amarone this evening.  You'll enjoy sipping from the oversized crystal wine glasses from Czechoslovakia.  They are truly a treat even for your ""cheap"" $100 Super Tuscan.

Appetizers included a small-ish portion of average bucatini in red sauce.  Octopus was nicely grilled, and the Madagascar jumbo shrimp was the largest I have ever seen and quite tasty.  You get exactly one per order, and you can feed several off this monstrous crustacean.

The steak is a spectacle but, for the price, falls short somewhat.  Bone in ribeye is Fred Flintstone-big with a rib as big as a brontosaurus.  Yelpers warned us that this is priced per person, so we were not surprised by the $75ish per person charge.  What did surprise us is that after the initial presentation of the bull meat the staff then carves the meat from the bone into a half dozen or so pieces of meat for the diner.  Interesting.  Not good or bad.  Just interesting.  

Maybe its me...  I don't want to offend the chef, but I tend to agree with other Yelpers who have commented on doneness of the steak.  Fellow diners tonite also agreed that the meat itself is on the underdone side of what you've ordered, and Mario's boys don't do a ""plus"", like ""medium rare-plus"", similar to other steak joints.  In my opinion if you like your steak medium rare you might consider ordering it medium at Batali's joint.  Since they cut the meat into smaller pieces table side it makes it awkward to increase doneness.  I hope that makes sense.

Seasoning of the steak here is minimal.  One really nice touch that I would love to see more often at restaurants is coarse sea salt.  At Carnevino it is available upon request, and it alone elevated our steaks from good to very good.

Side dishes were also-rans.  Corn with lime and chilies, ok.  Eggplant with tomato and ricotta, good.  Nothing stood out.

I enjoyed some delightful espresso flavored ice cream for dessert.  The pane cotta was standard and delish.

Our server, Gary from Long Island, was a gracious and efficient host.  His support team did an outstanding job of keeping our water glasses full and our needs met.

In retrospect, I frankly expected more bang for the buck at Carnevino.  As a huge Mario fan and Food Network junkie the bar was set high.  Still, at the same time, Carnevino largely delivers on the promise of a Vegas-sized gastronomical experience.  The room itself is a home run and over the top, as is the service, but the food is an under achiever in value at these astronomically high Vegas prices.

2667070,2010-06-25,1,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"I recently found my old travel journals and decided to start transferring some information to the web, and this is my starting point. 

I was in Vegas for the Bar & Nightclub Expo in March with some of my colleagues and other friends. Brutally honest, most of us were pretty toasted before the plane even left the runway at DFW. We were doing a good job of appearing much less drunk than we were, but after arriving, unpacking and meeting up for a beer, we decided to head over the Palazzo and meet up for dinner at Carnevino. As I recall, this was one of my demands. I have been a longtime admirer of Mario Batali but had never had the chance to dine at one of his restaurants.

There were about 11 or 12 of us if memory serves me correctly, and we had been imbibing for most of the day so I think it's safe to say we were salivating, licking our chops. Our decision was pretty easy: bring us a bunch of steaks, all your best apps, one of each side and keep the wine flowing. Wishes were granted. We had porterhouses that were fork-tender, prepared about as close to perfect medium rare as you could ask for. The meat melted in the mouth....

Beyond that everything gets pretty blurry, except I distinctly remember the greens. I'm not sure if they were spinach, collards, turnip greens or what. I can say this much, however: they were delicious. I love greens. Absolutely love 'em. Even cheap, store-brand spinach in a bag. These were like greens from the gardens of Mount Olympus. They had an amazing flavor, the kind of flavor that might make your forearms bulge like Popeye. 

I'll definitely be back here again, but next time I'll wait until after the meal to start drinking rum like a pirate in the 1600's.",G9oZsOundyx2qsS_eto6Bw,0,0,5,iHcalJLfubED9ZiXxYB0dw

I finally had a chance to come back to vegas and was dying for the Riserva.  They had the nearly 1 year aged NY Strip which was super flavorful and amazingly good.  The aroma and beef flavor was intense!  

I went back the next two days and finally on the 2nd day they had the Ribeye Riserva available!  Bells and little cupids starting flying around my head.  As you can see in my pictures the 8 1/2 month aged ribeye was masterfully carved out by my table.  Every part of the ribeye was great such as the eye and the cap itself which is usually the most marbleized part and my favorite.  Out of the 3 types I had (NY Strip, porterhouse and Ribeye) the ribeye is definitely the best out of the three is probably why it's almost never available!  

The steak was cooked perfectly the three times I went as a medium rare and topped off with some sea salt.  The last time I came here 1.5 years ago it was overcooked 2 out of 4 times.

I usually eat it with some ketchup & mustard mixed to help cut through the flavor a bit every few bites.  Overall the service and food was incredible.  I can't wait to go again for my 4th time and final day in vegas.  Highly recommended everyone try this at least once in their life!",oznT6CCm8c0jr_VuKv_Wmg,1,1,5,pI9THKwRNUEdOZmdJD4fIg

The BF and I went here for dinner one night and decided on the meat tasting menu.  I'll let the BF do a blow by blow and I'll just talk about my favorites:  The Waygu beef crudo was just succulent.  The waygu was sliced so thin and the little salad on top with fennel and coriander really enhanced the entire bite.  Even the wine served with this dish was a perfect pairing.  

Second favorite - its a toss up between the beef cheek ravioli and the wet aged piemontese beef.  The beef cheek stands out in my mind because of the balasmic they served with it.  It was slightly sweet and set off the savoryness of the beef cheek.  The wet aged beef - it was fork tender, melt in your mouth, give me more goodness.  The flavor was absolutely what you want a good piece of meet to taste like.  The wine served with this - Produttori del Barbaresco, Barbaresco 2006 Piemonte was also just a wonderful accompainment to the dish.

2675458,2009-11-03,0,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"I really wanted to love this place.  They have a prime location, beautiful room, cool staff... but it's just alright.  To me, it's a place that tries too hard and then falls short of the expectations for it's price point.  

The menu tries very hard to be a traditional Italian restaurant, but by name, it's a steakhouse.  Reading the menu, I felt almost dumb because I didn't know what a risretto (or some of the other things) was.  With the bread service, they bring you a nice butter and LARD.  Yes, LARD.  Not only did I not want to spread that on my bread, despite it's very benign presentation, I did not even want to look at it.  There's just a psychological thing about LARD that I just could not get over.  

Before I talk about the steaks, I want to compliment the work behind the bar.  I had a very unique and tasty Manhattan.  Excellent flavor, a real highlight of the visit.

On to the main course...  They do steaks.  They promote that the cut and age their own steaks.  They offer a unique rub for their steaks.  That all sounds very neat.  What did that give me?  A steak that matches up to the offering that you'd get at an Outback Steakhouse.  Not bad, but also not a $45 8 oz filet.  That unique rub?  Maybe they forgot to put it on?  I sure didn't taste anything distinctive.  Perhaps my palate isn't sophisticated enough, I'd take my own homemade olive oil, garlic and parsley rub and get more Italian flavor than what theirs added (cup of EVOO, 3 bulbs of fresh chopped garlic, 1/4 cup of fresh chopped parsley, salt and pepper if you want to try). The steak was pricey, but fine, cooked to the right temperature, tender.  What was a total miss was the Porcini Bernaise.  For starters, I wouldn't call the sauce completely broken, but it was a little broken when it got out to me.  The part that must have been broken was the part that had all of the flavor because this sauce had none.  You want to charge a $5 premium for a sauce on top of a $45 steak that compares to an Outback offering, then the sauce had better be some wicked good stuff and in this case, the sauce wasn't even good.  

Where I do have to give them some credit for culinary inventiveness is on the starch.  I had the mashed potatoes.  They come with some crispy pancetta and a poached egg... really nice stuff.

So 3 stars because the quality did not measure up to the price and the concept of the restaurant just tries to hard.",5oQZbpVli6LetUh29pjYgA,0,0,3,M75sQ4e4itKWHZJhKu5WrQ
2681870,2009-10-02,0,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"I have to admit - I'm a Food Network Junkie, but I've never been a big Mario Batali fan. Sorry Mario, I really don't know what I was thinking. Since Carnevino, I've been converted and have another level of appreciation and respect for this Iron Chef and his food. Thank you, Mario. I didn't know I could love Italian food. You've converted me. 

Our server, JT, was amazing. He knew how to assist us and give us recommendations, without being pushy or overbearing. By the end of our meal, we had exchanged stories about our children and talked a lot about food and wine. This guy knows his food and wine and you can genuinely see that he really enjoys what he does. Kudos to JT. We'll be returning on a future visit and we hope he'll still be there. 

He explained that the pasta dishes were small appetizer portions. In my opinion - they got this part right. I remember eating in Rome where pasta dishes are one of several small dinner courses. Personally, I don't like eating huge bowls of pasta for fear that the pasta will quickly find it's way to my derriere, so in my book, smaller pasta portions works just fine with me . I started off with the Potato Gnocchi Bolognese while hubby ordered the chicken liver ravioli with a drizzle of aged balsamic vinegar. Who knew such simple dishes could be so complex. We savored the wonderful flavors of our small plates and moved on to our entrees of osso bucco and sweetbreads. While I can't comment on the sweetbreads, the osso bucco was amazingly tender and flavorful. I left the marrow for hubby to enjoy while devouring his sweetbreads, which he claimed were excellent and expertly cooked. 

Even though we were quite full, JT mentioned the fresh peach doughnuts that were in season. Hubby's face lit up like a little kid when JT described the decadent dish. The pillowy soft doughnuts had a fresh peach filling and were served with a scoop of vanilla bean gelato. Eaten together, the doughnuts, fruit filling and gelato, created a harmonious symphony of textures and flavors in our mouths - warm and crispy, sweet and tart, and creamy and smooth. I usually order chocolate desserts, but this time, I'm glad we listened to JT. 

Upon bidding farewell to JT, he mentioned that the next time we return, we have to try the steak. Unfortunately, we had eaten at Morel's Steakhouse the night before and also had Wagyu strip steak at Alex's two days before that, so we really didn't want to eat another steak on our vacation. Hubby and I will definitely be back to Carnevino and next time we'll order whatever JT wants us to order.",DQP76A3a5bLRISK1r42z9A,1,1,5,_1V2IR_LNFHioXtJrgB07w

Before I continue, I ordered one of their pasta dish. Yes, I know. Who comes to a steak restaurant and orders pasta?? But to each their own....I was simply craving for pasta that night. Either way, it did not disappoint. Order the Linguini Fini (crab, jalapeno and cipollini...aka onions with a jalapeno pesto sauce.) Sauce was light but flavorful. And let me tell you: portion control was great. The dish was small enough to still get you full without feeling like gross and bloated walking out the restaurant.

Boyfriend and I also ordered a kale salad to share as our appetizer. If you're a fan of kale, you must get this!!!!! Very refreshing.

For his entr√©e, he ordered something that was not on the menu. He knows the chef really well and they prepared it special for him. Zucchinis with tomato sauce and cheese. Sounds simple but man was that good!? If I'm ever in the mood for something healthy, that is what I will go for.

I really enjoyed my 100 day dry aged ribeye, and the other items I ordered.

I think this place gets unfairly knocked for the following reasons:

It's an Italian Steakhouse.  They don't do 14 sauces or Emeril Laggase style spice rubs.  They take amazing beef, season it with some restraint and cook it beautifully.  Some people will not like beef as the star, they like more going on with their steaks and that's fine but that's not what Carnevino does. I see Carnevino's steaks as the margherita pizza of steaks, simple, beautiful, and tasty.

Secondly It's pricey, so if anything is not to someones personal liking they are more upset due to the price.

The last reason I think people knock this and other good steakhouses is because they offer some boring vegetable side dishes. Some people like fresh, simple veg with their steak.  If that's not you don't order the broccoli. Order some cheesy or creamy side if you want rich and savory on top of rich and savory.

Service was top notch, friendly, and informative, not stuffy or intimidating.

If you have some extra coin, give it a try.  I had an amazing meal there.

I hope this review turns some people away from going to Carnevino  because it's not good for people to spend their money on something they don't care for and it's not good for Carnevino to get bad reviews from people who come to eat there wanting something that they don't offer.",XqdJteJasKn70IXZDkX7PA,1,0,5,GR4n_hlgb44he7mMsLo8yw

We had a reservation for the dining room but asked to be seated in the bar, overlooking the casino (it seemed a bit more interesting to me than the dining room).  This turned out to be a huge mistake.  We had to wait, wait, wait for service.  We were eventually split between two servers, who were extremely apologetic but also extremely stretched to the limit with work that they could not accomplish successfully in such a small space.  This is a huge managerial error, and when I turned in my comment card and spoke to a supposed ""manager"" on the way out, she seemed pretty unconcerned.  She was eager to move me along and was fast to blame the problems on the servers.  Not very professional.  Good managers survey the situation and make adjustments when things are clearly not working well.  Shocking for a restaurant of this caliber.

The steaks were STUNNING.  I have been to several big steakhouses in Vegas:  SW, Cut, Nine, Circus Circus, Craftsteak.  My favorite for quality of the meat is Cut, but it is a close call with Carnevino.  The sides were delicious, and one of our servers was very skilled at navigating us to the best sides for our meal.  

We were not offered dessert.

Not sure if I will be back.  Depends on whether I am staying at the Palazzo and whether it is not crowded.  The management of Carnevino needs to remember that every diner and every meal should be treated as if it is special and important.

U2 was coming through on the speakers, giving the whole place a chill vibe. The waiters are also top notch. They also have an amazing wine list, full of Italian varietals to explore.

We each started with a first course, then split a pasta course and split an entree. We even split dessert. It was more than enough food for the 2 of us. I started with the Iberico ham plate. The ham was so buttery and delicious, it melted on my tongue. It also came with these wonderful pillows made of dough. It was a pricey appetizer, but worth every penny! My husband had a giant shrimp ala diavola. It was huge! 

You have to have pasta here. We split the bucatini all'amatriciana, upgraded to the entree size. It was a simple pasta with red sauce. I loved it! The simple ingredients really let the pasta shine through. 

For our entree we split the osso bucco. It is one of my favorite dishes. I have had osso bucco all over the country, and they really got it right at Carnevino. Not only did the veal have great flavor and was so tender it fell off of the bone, but the bone itself had a huge amount of marrow. So good! We split some vanilla, pistachio and chocolate gelato for desert. 

Overall a wonderful meal. We each had a cocktail and a glass of wine with dinner and I believe our overall  bill with tip was around $220.

I was reviewing the participating  restaurants in the Las Vegas Restaurant Week event.  More than a hundred restaurants participate, and almost all of them offer a discounted prix fixe menu for this one week event.  I took a look at Carnevino's Restaurant Week menu, which was $80 for three courses.  I then took a look at the regular menu, and noticed that it had a pre-theater prix fixe, which was almost identical to the Restaurant Week menu, but was only $65 ($57 if you show theater tickets).

Shame on you, Mario, for ripping off your customers this way.  Every year during Restaurant Week I look forward to trying some new places at a bit of a discount.  It's a great event.  But I certainly didn't expect any restaurant to jack up their prices for this event.  I know Mario Batali is famous for using the phrase ""Ka-Ching!"" and that's fine.  Restaurateurs should make a profit - no problem.  But don't screw with my affection for Restaurant Week.",ZmKGF8ZZUo16g2ISrz4ahw,2,0,2,4vTouYz-MjJZt9HuftfLQA

Simple, basic comfort food, or daring, bold, imaginative and sophisticated, what I bring up to my nose and put in my mouth must be orgasmic, the stuff of dreams and fantasies, haunting me till my next visit, causing unexpected and sometimes embarrassing unplanned drooling and mindless reverie;

Service needs to be caring and professional, a combination of doing the job, and making me feel welcome, not an imposition. Around when you need them, but not hovering or intrusive. Being easy on the eyes and a ready smile don't hurt, though the first one is not as important as the second...

The setting, small and intimate, or grand and imposing, needs to be well done, appropriate, complementary to the food and mood. 

Ultimately it's the combination of all of the above, a whole greater than the sum of the parts.

For me, a weekend getaway to Vegas is not complete without a FAT steak.  I love dry aged steaks and if I am going to pay a premium,  I want it to at least beat the basic chains like Fleming's and Ruth Chris.  The steak was good but it did NOT exceed this basic benchmark unfortunately.  It was just -""OK. "" 

The decor and service were outstanding.  But lets talk food.

I ordered the bone in rib eye for $144 (don't get confused as it says $72 on the menu without clearly stating its per person).  

Lots of fat on this steak.  And the taste - good but again, not as savory as the basic chain steak houses like Ruth Chris.  

The sides - brussel sprouts and fried octopus, don't even remember, it was nothing to write about.  

Bottom line:  group yelp rating gets it about right  at 3-3.5 stars.  Its too expensive for just - ""OK.""   Overall, a bit disappointed for my weekend-getaway-Vegas-steak experience.",BfWm-stpIQ2ztIrm66emBQ,0,0,3,qMT432GzvAlek4Sx8SKYPQ

I've been to Carnevino once before a few years ago to try the hidden menu steak ""the Riserva"" (240 day dry aged rib eye).  I thought it was just okay and wouldn't order it again.  I've eaten at Michael's, Gordon Ramsey Steak, Craft Steak, T-Bones, etc., and I'm not really impressed with this restaurant as a steak house.  For the price point, you're better off getting a better steak somewhere else.  

Anyway, I returned with a group of friends for Restaurant Week.  We looked at the menu and compared the prices and it was quickly apparent that the RW menu was just priced in an ala carte fashion, so we just ordered off the main menu.  

For appetizers, we ordered the grilled octopus (not as good as Milo's), the carne cruda (severely lacking seasoning, needed capers or salt), a crudo (this was excellent).  

For sides, we ordered the corn and the beets.  Both of these dishes were overcooked and mushy and they were complete failures.  Unsurprisingly, the sides were insipid much like the carne crudo.  

For entrees, we ordered a NY Steak (properly cooked, inconsistent seasoning since they sprinkle kosher salt on it table side and then cover it with olive oil instead of seasoning it and pressing the salt and pepper into the meat prior to cooking it), the Veal Saltibocca (excellent), Veal Scaloppine (meh), and the Red Snapper (excellent).  As I've had the Veal Saltibocca at Spaghetti Western and it was just as good, it's hard to justify the price point that Carnevino demands for its mediocre food and wobbly tables.  

Do yourself a favor and just pass on this Restaurant.  Instead, go to Lavo, Yardbird, or Chicas.  Those places are much better.",7cgp0EXG11v-y4F6sDU1hg,3,0,2,Erzhwba2Tw3xViG_4wNLsQ

!!??!!  WTF?  We were dressed up nicely and told to go stand someplace else?  There is no waiting area so we had to linger around within sight of the front desk.  I can understand being delayed if there is a slow turn over, but to come to a place that is 10% full and not given a time when would be seated was pretty bad.

20 minutes later we were seated.

The ambiance is more Disney than steakhouse.  The over sized table was novel at first but wore off fast as it was difficult to sit at.  Small side portions for large prices.  It's Vegas so things are expensive,  but this just didn't deserve it.

Stopped by here to see what tine they closed on lo and behold they have late hours... it was about 1130pm and almost all places in Venetian/Palazzo had closed (high end places).

So went up to the bar and ordered the following:

Negroni...My go to aperitif... and they make a very good one.
If you like Negronis def order one here.

Fresh ciabatta bread... the lardo butter aka back fat is amazing

Dozen oysters... at first I thought they forgot the mignonette and cocktail,sauce with horseradish.... but I remembered these came prepared.

I have to say they are some of the best tasting and refreshing oysters.  So good we ordered 42!! 3 1/2 dozen.

The grilled octopus was probably also the best octopus dish I have had in Vegas... and I have had a lot ... so good my buddy ordered it twice when he finally joined me.

Next... snapper crudo was good... not as amazing as the other two items but worthwhile mention.

Service was amazing from m the bartender and his bar back.

Overall this is def worth a trip if your in Vegas..


Ooohh and the off menu beef cheek ravioli is also a must try.....amazing dish that you must ask for...

2965516,2012-09-10,0,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"Hypothetically, let's say you were on a carb free diet and I offer you one noodle off my  pasta entree. What's the harm in that -just one noodle?? PLENTY OF HARM, if we were dining at Carnevino. 

And so begins the tao of Spago - my favorite pasta dish of all time. Which is ironic, since Carnevino is praised for its......carne. 

While it may be one of the pricier restaurants in the Venetian/Palazzo compound, Carnevino lacks the sex and sparkle some of its neighboring hot spots like Lavo or even Bouchon have. Regardless, I had never been to a Mario Batali restaurant, and decided to take a chance.

If Carnevino wasn't inside a Vegas Casino, one would be rather pleased with its general ambience. Not overly swanky, but not kitschy either - the dim steak house makes a great choice for a large group dinner or as in my case, dining solo. 

Sitting at the bar, I was given their Taverna menu - a shortened version of their regular offerings specifically for lunch or late night - but truthfully - there are no cost savings if you attempt to order off it.

Since I was dining during dinner, I opted to order off the regular menu filled with several salads, appetizers, their high end aged steaks and handmade pastas. With about 10 pasta options, I found myself in a quandary - but went with the simplified Spago -  a bucatini type pasta with lamb ragu. Pretty basic......NOT.

Minutes later, a 12 FOOT -  hand rolled noodle (not plural) ""tangled"" in a braised lamb and tomato stew stood before my big brown eyes. Alas, my ""Lady and The Tramp"" moment was here! The noodle was of the upmost quality with just enough ""dente"" - a perfect chew.  I could not get over how delectable this pasta was. Meanwhile, the lamb sauce was perfection with sizable shreds of tender lamb in a hearty tomato sauce. While this was no steak dish, even the appetizer portion had the ""chops"" to be a more than filling meal.

I rounded out my meal with the grilled brocclini side (sans the ham) which proved to be the perfect accompaniment to a decadent dish seasoned with enough garlic to scare off even the skeeziest of creeps on the Vegas strip.

The service at Carnevino was perfection down to the charistmatic waiter and his timing of my meal. I can't imagine returning to Vegas and not returning for my Spago entree.

Bottom Line: If I were a Food Network Chef, you can count on me featuring Spago at Carnevino as ""The Best Thing I Ever Ate: The Pasta Episode. GO GET TANGLED IN IT TODAY!",iT9FXdaiMRlpRlMV3lSnZQ,2,2,5,Jy0SCbusMYcX3mUzFG3ncQ

In fact, Delmonico makes a much better bone-in ribeye. Juicier and richer in flavor, where the marbled fat properly melts into the flesh. Per our server's suggestion, we got the 2-person ribeye done medium as they flash sear their ribeyes at high heat. It wasn't warm at all, and the fat was still white. I stopped eating because I couldn't get into it.

Sadly, I roast better brussels sprouts at home; these didn't have any texture, just mush. The mushrooms were great though. We also had the octopus, which was enjoyable to eat.

That was pretty much the end of any promise of good service.  Our server clearly looked overworked and while he was nimble on his feet, it took a while before we got our drinks and forever before the order was taken.  A smile of course was too much to ask for.  Or regular refills of water.  Of course that gave us plenty I time to marvel at the wine list and wonder who on earth orders the $18,000 bottle of some wine from 1961 .  I ordered the caprese salad and the osso buco.  Naturally the expectations were high given the celebrity chefs whose names are connected to this restaurant.  The salad was ok but honestly I have had better burrata cheese at much less fancy restaurants.  But it was the ossobuco that really took my breath away.  And not in a good way. It was supposed to be on a bed of saffron flavored orzo which was essentially saffron flavored fairly dry orzo.  The meat itself was a very nicely done piece of pork but completely devoid of any kind of sauce.  It almost seemed like someone had forgotten to ladle the sauce on the dish.  Now I'm not Italian, nor am I some gourmand foodie but nearly every time I have had OB it has been a braised dish where the meat was cooked for a long time resulting in a pretty flavorful sauce.  That was certainly not the case here.  So I found myself taking regular sips of water to help swallow a fairly dry bite of food.  A very disappointing experience from a $40 dish I have to say.  2 of my colleagues ordered the gnocchi and got anemic amount of food for $25.  I mean we are taking no more than 3-4 spoons of cheerios sized gnocchi.  Sure if I had wanted a mountain of food I should've gone to Buca DeBeppo but come one! A entree sized like an appetizer is unacceptable. I guess I should take comfort in the fact that at least I got enough food to not have to hit The 24 hour  Curry Pot after this meal.  2 of my colleagues who ordered the fillet were however very satisfied with their dish. 

Net net: a very disappointed rip off of a meal from a celebrity chef branded restaurant.  I have never really been a fan of Mario Batalli's TV show and this restaurant more or less means that I'll stay clear of his establishments in the future.

For 3 people this was more than enough food.  We almost couldn't finish it all with a side of roasted beets which was also very yum.  Be prepared to spend some $$$ as the ribeye for 2 was $72/person and the lamb chops alone was $63.

The waiter were so knowledgeable about everything being placed on the table, in or around us. It almost became to much, when explaining specials, their presentation, and suggestions they were very long winded. I guess I felt like when deep in conversation with close friends, give us some space. But really, I'd rather have a wait staff over doing it than under doing it, so I can't complain too much.

The restaurant is huge with really expensive looking art and furniture. Dark toned brown leathers it felt grand. Deep red paint covered most of the walls and creme linens lined the tables. I felt comfortable with the table set up and comfy chairs. It was exactly how I imagined dinner with Tony Soprano would be like. This Italian steakhouse made sparks fly for me. 

For entrees I got the beef carpaccio and the fried calamari. Everyone enjoyed those tasty dishes.

I'm a big steak fan and i make it a point to make reservations at one of the nice steakhouses whenever i'm on vacation.   

Aged meat is what this place is a all about!  All of their steaks are aged 90 days (which is the most i've every seen as most places do ~21-30days...with a select few doing 60 days).

We started with the Jamon Iberico de bellota...I can finally cross this legendary pork dish off my list!   The meat was a bit waxy and really fatty...it was basically like prosciutto on steriods.  It was really good and definitely worth a try.

Me and my friend split a Reserva steak (it's not on the menu but you can ask the waiter if they have any).   The Reserva steak is their super aged beef...ours was a 8 MONTH aged ribeye.   They sell the steak by the inch (thickness).  We ordered the minimum which was 1"" since we were not really hungry.   The steak came out much bigger then expected.  It was bone in but i'd say it's probably in the range of ~16oz of actual meat.

Ok, this is one weird steak.  It doesn't smell like steak and it doesn't taste like steak.   It actually tastes like the jamon iberico we just had!   You can see a lot of marbling even after being cooked (it was cooked rare).  I'd say this is probably a A4 grade if you go by Japanese grading standards.  

The steak tastes like cured ham,  it has a weird funk to it like aged cheese...imagine some weird combination of cured ham and aged cheese.  It was a bit waxy just like the jamon iberico and it had a fatty coating to it.   Overall i'd say this is not bad...and an interesting steak to try but it's not better then your regular aged steak.    I tried some of my friends new york steak and i have to say it's probably in my top 3 at the moment.  It was seasoned and cooked just right with a nice charred crust.

From the moment we walked to the host stand I was skeptical. The hostesses were paying more attention to what they were planning to do that evening than getting us a table. Once seated, we noticed that the air conditioning was blowing like a gale wind. When asked if we could move tables, our waitress said it would be like that for every table but that she would get the manager and see if he could turn down the air. While we waited for the hurricane winds to subside we ordered a couple martinis and one of our guests ordered a glass of chardonnay. The waitress then informed her that they did not have chardonnay by the glass but that they had bottles from $110 and up. Once explained that she did not need a bottle since she was the only one out of our group having chardonnay, the waitress asked if she would like to try any of their other whites by the glass. After trying about 10 different wines, none of which were anything comparable to chardonnay, she went with the least offensive. After the chardonnay charade, we all noticed that it El Vino's winds were still a blowing. We asked to see a manager and once graced with his presence (15 minutes later) told him the situation. He apologized but explained that the casino controlled the air. So why were we told that they were turning the air down? By now we were just ready to order some food and hoped it would save the evening. 

Dinner Breakdown: 

My mom: 
SPAGHETTI AI FRUTTI DI MARE - Pasta tasted very good but did not stay hot long. The size of the pasta was very small and should have been listed as an Antipasti. 

My Girlfriend: 
FILET MIGNON 8oz - She like the taste of filet very much and said it was cooked perfectly. 

My father and I: 
LA FIORENTINA(classic Florentine porterhouse) - The steak was a very good size, definitely was not worth $140. Looked hot when it arrived but after the waiter was done carving the meat, the heat had succumbed to El Vino. The meat was cold, chewy, and for the most part flavorless. 

Needless to say, we did not have coffee or dessert. I have done two of Mario Batali's restaurants and will not be visiting another. Check out my B&B review coming soon. I will be posting it as soon as I get over the exhaustion of this review.

I can make better steaks myself at home from Costco. Carnevino is a total waste of time and money! $200 per plate for cheap, garbage steak. Half fat. Half Gristle. 

Marination and aging is on point. But  steak quality was horrible. I got the impression the steak was from another customer and sat under a hot lamp. It came out way too fast. Another Yelp reviewer confrmed the waiter told him them put the send backs under a hot lamp.

$25 for a glass of sub-par Malbec worth $4 per glass. $25 for a tiny cup of peppers. I should not have given the waiter a tip but he was nice and attentative.

But I do not appreciate being ripped off. Carinevino is a total JOKE. Go elsewhere. Please. Heed this review people. This isn't just a one off. The 5 star reviews are from tourists who aren't used to 5 star steakhosue dining or they eat when there was a better chef.

I promise you will have a better steak elsewhere. Even at Sizzler! 

Carnevino's steak is just an overpriced marketing gimmick. 

Please people. Do not, I repeat, no not waste your Las Vegas steakhouse experience at this overhyped self promoted 5 star scam!",gFuwuhN5RIVr38Zu4_TQig,1,0,1,MGxckvPBwNsc72PDrD1cTQ

Food: we had a party of 9.  Ribeye (each order is for 2 people at 65 per person, NY strip, Filet mignon ($40), lambchops)  For sides we got the SPINACH WITH GARLIC & HOT PEPPERS, SAUTEED MIXED MUSHROOMS WITH CIPOLLINI ONIONS, MASCARPONE & GUANCIALE MASHED POTATOES (sorry for the caps, i copy/pasted from the website, forgot what the sides were called and what was included).  Each side is for a portion for 2 ppl to share, so we got 2 orders of each of the previous sides.  Each of the sides were recommended by the waiter.  Personally i liked the mushroom with cipollini onions the best, the onions were absolutely amazing.  As for the entrees, noone was dissapointed.  I heard ""best lamb chops ever"".  The rib eye had insane marbling, and was cooked to perfection.  The CV steak sauce that we got with the steaks tasted like a vinegrette based with rosemary and other herbs infused.  Ive had better steak sauce before.  Also the ribeye comes with a massive bone, which they give to you.  On it has meat as well, the meat was very good, with a beef jerky like flavor but obviously much more delicious.

Price: for the party of 9, and 6 sides with a bottle of wine, 1 appetizer (cured meats), no dessert.  Comes out to be about 100/person.  almost a thousand total.  kind of pricey, but noone complained about it being overpriced, meaning they all thought they got their moneys worth.

Service: excellent. period.

Overall: great food, sides could use improving, but the entrees more than makes up for it.  The quality of the ribeye is probably the best Ive ever had.  If the sides were up to par, it would easily get 5 stars.",r1sLj85JPwZ_KM2eviuLVg,0,1,4,nbj8KJ8whxE_-B0tA7ybQQ
3056809,2012-03-02,0,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"Visited Carnevino with two business associates last night. I had very high expectations going in, given that this is a Mario Batali establishment, and quite frankly for the price, I was disappointed. The restaurant was beautiful, but the music was waaaaay too loud! The entire night, I had Led Zeppelin, U2 and some other weird junk blasting in my ears. I love classic rock, but I found this very out of character with the restaurant. Not sure Mario would have approved that music choice. The Waiter and Wait Staff were excellent. Very attentive without being overbearing. Allowed us to move along at our own pace. We never felt rushed. The Wine List was extensive, and exhaustive to read. Their focus is obviously on imported wines, primarily Italian, which fits with the theme of the Restaurant. Great selection, Vegas prices, what can I say?! The food was a mixed bag. Bread (buns?) came with a salted butter, and some gelatinous pork fat spread. It was no pork rillette, for sure. It tasted like flavored lard. As for antipasto, I had the Insalata Caprese. It was nothing like the pictures you see on the web site here. Obviously getting fresh tomatoes in Vegas in February must be a challenge, but this had 4 slices of like re-hydrated sun dried tomatoes with a pesto sauce with some very mild white cheese. Where is the buffalo mozzarella? Where are the Heirloom tomatoes. Very disappointing. One of may associates had the Caesar Salad and didn't finish it. We also tried the beef cheek ravioli's. Very good, especially with the aged Balsamic as a kicker. Now for the main attraction, the meats. These wee 3 of the finest cuts of meat I have ever seen. I had the 16 oz Bone In New York. Wow!!!!! Cooked to perfection, beautifully seasoned, and tasted incredible. Another associate had the 8 oz Filet. Again, a superb piece of meat. I think he licked the plate!!! However, the main attraction were the lamb chops. Three of the biggest (they are double cut), juiciest and most perfectly cooked chops I have ever seen. The flavor was beyond words. The chops were a work of art! So large though that my associate could not finish it all. We also had the Fries as a side dish. Pass on those. Soft, soggy and drenched in oil. Yuck! 

I would recommend Carnvino for the meats. They are spectacular. As for everything else, they were very mediocre to poor. As a restaurant owner, I was a little disturbed by the quality and consistency of the experience given the steep price tag you pay.",Y3eIMsZTq8ZW74R0HdiDXQ,1,0,3,XSBK_6qNzQ7UPJqaYA5X2w
3059532,2012-02-03,1,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"We went there for dinner last night. at the suggestion of our son who ate there last week.  He told us to order the ribeye for two, but to pass on everything else.   Our son said to have dessert and coffee elsewhere.  The  food was good but not extraordinary.   The lardo tasted gross.   This ""nice Jewish girl"" actually tasted it!  

The kicker to our experience there was the din that they called ""music"".  We were sitting at a table abutting a wall and the speakers (MANY OF THEM) are mounted on the wall.  We asked them if they could make the music lower.   NO!   That's the way Mario wants it, they responded.   Could they change the selection?   NO!   That's the way Mario wants it since he provides the restaurant with an Ipod with his selections on it and they have no leeway to deviate from his playlists.  They offered to change our table to an interior one, away from the wall, so we had our table changed, but that didn't help.    They were totally inflexible vis-a-vis the music.

Only because of their arrogance and smugness have I given this restaurant only one star, grudgingly.  I do not intend to return.   Even at Vegas standards, it is very overpriced for what you get.",zGgSGRE8jMpXiYMIlpXZlw,1,0,1,cgFLQtNEp3pjUUNIwH6JwQ
3061591,2016-04-11,0,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"Came to Carnevino during a recent stay at the Palazzo for a guys trip. It was an early Friday evening for a ""light"" dinner before going out. 

On the positive side, great service, quickly seated with reservation, attractive old school looking dining rooms, informative wait staff, extensive wine/cocktail menu. Generally the food was average to above average but nothing fantastic especially given the price. The steaks were obviously the highlight.

Apps: grilled octopus was the best (so tender and flavorful). The duck egg was completely overpriced and overrated. The gnocchi was good too but super small portion size

Steaks: we got the Porterhouse for 2 and Ribeye for 2. Medium Rare. We were told they were dry-aged for 90-120 days. We preferred the porterhouse over the ribeye. Good not great. Not to die for

Sides: mushrooms were awesome and the crowd favorite. The highly recommended mash with pouched egg and bacon looked better than it taste. The asparagus was meh at best.

Desserts: tiramisu was the best of the bunch

Cocktail: the negroni was bad ass. Circle ice added a sophisticated touch.

Highlights were the octopus, porterhouse, mushrooms and tiramisu .. and the negroni",P_BsIX1h93u8lgiDXf-9CA,2,1,3,j5hsrJSkiTngCp--nMREvQ

3072710,2013-09-15,0,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"Mick Jagger once said ""anything worth doing is worth overdoing"". So while in Vegas, I decided to send my taste buds on a ride and Carnevino was the vessel by which to do that with. 

We were seated in a back area surrounded by walls filled with numerous wine bottles. The waiter went over their specials and suggested some good wine to start us off with. With our wine, he brings us these amazing cheese zeppole's to start our dining adventure.

For the antipasti, we went with the Arugula salad. The arugula was peppery and contained Coach Farm triple cream, trumpet royale mushrooms, and pickled onions. The dressing was just tart enough to awaken the taste buds and I knew the rest of the meal was going to be fantastic after how this tasted.

For my main course, I opted for the 16oz. bone-in NY Strip. Cooked medium rare, this chunk of heavenly delight was dry-aged to perfection and had a nice rub consisting of sea salt, black pepper and fresh rosemary. The slightly charred crust of the steak and the juiciness of the steak gives Carnevino a place in my all-time favorite restaurants. I added a gorgonzola marscapone sauce to accompany the meat but I did not think the meat needed it. I had maybe a couple of bites with it but the meat was so delicious I felt I was doing it a disservice.

While the steak was an experience in and of itself, Carnevino's sides were also delicious. We had the Italian broccoli with house smoked pork. The broccoli was a little more tart than regular broccoli but the waiter warned us about that. We added the marscapone & guanciale mashed potatoes and also indulged in a side of fregula, pecorino romano & corn. Taste bud overload was not done because a side of fried eggplant with tomato & ricotta finished things off. All were delicious, but the fregula and eggplant stood out from the crowd.

For dessert, we had the Tiramisu. Containing cocoa nibs and homemade marscapone, it was the perfect finale to an amazing meal. I am not naive enough to say Carnevino is the best in town. No. Instead, I will say that if you are looking for an amazing steak, great ambience, friendly service and an experience one can only get in Vegas, then this is one of the better places.",7tHJXSicuspXflt3eMOhCg,0,0,4,KMTQez1p7XO4cCblG09FCg

I've made much better steaks at home and had much better at other restaurants. Their medium was also more like medium rare, so I'd suggest that you order your steak medium well if you want it to be medium. The broccolini and mash potatoes were mediocre at best and their banana bread pudding dessert which was recommended by our waiter was not tasty at all.

As soon as we check in everyone was so attentive to our needs including checking on us throughout our dining experience.  Our waiter also took the time to explain the food, the cut of each part of the bone rib eye and part of their aging process.

On to the food.  We ordered arugula salad, Beef cheek ravioli (I believe this was a special for that night), Dry Aged Bone-In Rib Eye with mash potato and spinach side.  We enjoyed every dish we ordered.  The only dish that we thought was average was the spinach side dish.  The arugula salad was a great mix of arugula, pickled onions, very creamy goat cheese and mushroom - the mix was very refreshing and went well together.  The beef cheek ravioli was also superb.  It had great taste like a very good pate.  We ordered a medium cooked rib eye and it was just cooked perfectly.  Red in the middle and not bloody - red and warm middle vs. of red and cold middle.

We had started a Sunday cocktail/appetizer crawl at The Wynn then came upon CV and stopped in for our first time.  The interior looks like a dining hall inside of a large Tuscan castle which was appropriate.  Unfortunately, CV serves the dinner menu at lunch on Sunday.  This restaurant houses Batali's primo wine collection and the prices will make any wine lover shake their head.  Odd that the staff chose to play Prince hits collection in this theme restaurant.  
I ordered a glass of Bastianich's Rose which was surprisingly good on a hot August afternoon.  Knowing that I was going into my favorite Italian chef's steakhouse, I had a craving for carpaccio.  Unfortunately, only tagliata di manzo is offered with a cut selection, marbled FLANK steak, that I did not find enjoyable due to the gamie taste.  I should have ordered the tartare.  I also ordered the fingerling potatoes which were not very flavorful.

3109492,2009-07-09,1,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"It says a lot when you feel full-on guilt for not being able to finish the rest of your ribeye. Granted the fresh black truffle pasta was slightly on the heavy side but hardly lacked on the flavor of freshly shaved truffles right onto your hot plate of butter drenched pasta. I wasn't too fond of the side dishes. Not saying that they weren't good... just nothing special. The sauces were perfectly complementary with our ribeye - but I liked the bearnaise just a tad bit more.

The insalata was on the salty side for me so after a few bites, mr. bunnie was the one to finish it off. Another highlight of Carnevino was their house-made lardons - pure pork fat. I was a little turned off by it just knowing what it was. If you think about it, it's pretty much like smearing lard onto rosemary scented focaccia bread. Ehhh...not that into it. I ended up trying it and, well, it was okay. Very rich and very good - just not one of my favs. Mr Bunnie, on the other hand, would probably smear it on everything he ate or possibly even smear it on himself if he could. I shudder at that thought. ""Honey... what's that smell?""

The tableside carved ribeye for two was fantastic. Rich and velvety, slightly charred and yet still full of flavor and tender, practically melts in your mouth - Mario Batali's crew sure knows how to make a steak girl happy. A definite good contender for my love of Mastro's bone-in ribeye. Can't say I like one better than the other - they're just different. When meat, like Carnevino, is carved tableside, it rests too much to where it creates even a bigger dip in tempature vs. at Mastro's, which comes on a extremely hot sizzling plate. Hmm... just different. I wouldn't change a thing on either.

Next but not least were the desserts. Since I was so full from the meal, I opted to try their sorbettos - green apple, grapefruit, and cara cara orange. Refreshing and so true to the flavor (except for the apple...I'm not sure what it tasted like.) The grapefruit and cara cara orange sorbetto's were like biting into the actual fresh fruit. It was the perfect finish to a great meal. So, if you find yourself in Vegas and wanting to spend some good money on a great meal, Carnevino gets our thumbs up!

My husband and I started with the Fried Calamari and it was spectacular.  I mean its one of those dishes that I have ordered at Chinese restaurants, Italian restaurants, and even a few beach bayside restaurants, and I feel like its never been done better than this.  The calamari was served over a marinara sauce and my favorite little addition was the fact that there were banana peppers mixed in with the calamari itself which added this little punch of sour.

We then had the Dry Aged Bone In Ribeye for two.  The way this thing was cooked was so amazing.  The outside was crispy and charred to perfection but the inside was perfectly medium rare like we asked.  Perfect cooking technique paired with the quality of the cut of meat itself made for one good piece of meat.

For our side dishes we had the mascarpone and guanciale mashed potatoes and the charred Brussels sprouts with smoked ham.  Both were really good, but if you asked me to pick the potatoes were definitely my favorite.",JkuKSbDKOtuBAal5mW_kOA,3,1,5,yMolkL84JADQ60Z2Cd1IPw

But on our way over there from our hotel (Encore...meh) we saw a lunch ""special"" at Carnevino. $30 for a burger, salad or homemade chips, and 2 drinks (a choice of bloody mary,  Bellini's or Peroni beer, mix and match at will). Yeah, it's a little on the pricey side, but this is Vegas so it's to be expected. 

First off, the hostess couldn't be nicer. And our server (along with his helper) were also super nice. Even though we all went with the burger special, not once did I feel like they were blowing us off because we didn't order the insane steaks or entrees. Absolutely incredible service. Completely different experience than the one we had a Switch in the Encore. But I'm straying off course. 

The burger was a mix of 3 different meats, wish I could remember which ones, topped with pancetta and gorgonzola cheese. These burgers were cooked to absolute perfection!!! Nice and medium, exactly how I asked for it. The flavors just make my tastebuds uber happy happy. My side of homemade chips were also excellent. I haven't had a potato chip in years and I couldn't stop eating these. I even stole a few from the better half when she turned away. For my drinks I ordered a bellnio and a Peroni. The bellini was kinda fru-fru (peach and champagne I think) and refreshing but the Peroni was just what I needed to beat the Vegas heat.

The beets with Gorgonzola (one piece of Gorgonzola is hardly enough) was so much better than the steak.

I told her as soon as I don't need a jacket ill order one. She did nothing about it.

My wife said bring it and ill order more if needed. But she just had an attitude.
Place also had the oddest selection of music.

I live near a good steak house that has a huge dry aging room and lots of (most in the US) Kobe and other good types of beef, so I was not impressed with their specialty beef selections, they seemed just average for me, but if you are from an area with out some of the good steak houses I have, you will probably enjoy the experience. 

I have to say they have some terrific sides and I would love to revisit just to dabble in some more of their fancy side dishes.  As my GF has mentioned in another review the black fettuccine was amazing and extremely different. I how ever did enjoy the lobster tortellinis most. Everything was about on point, just a word to the wise their normal steaks are not dry aged, only the few steaks such as their ribeyes are.  I was disappointed not getting a dry aged filet, but oh well I always have Alexanders back home to return to for that. 

The best part of the night was Anthony, our waiter, he was very good with his explanations and help with the menu as well as wine paring and prepping our glasses. 

I see a few reviews complaining about the time it takes to have a meal here... aaahhh duhhhh you are at a steak house, any good steak house or any good dinner is going to be 2+ hours... when we go out to our local favorite it will usually be a almost 4 hour night, what's wrong with enjoying your food and alcohol? Don't rush one of the joys of life people, jesus....

The staff was unwilling to spilt a check and at one point the waiter Michael yelled at myself and another guest making a scene in the restaurant. The manager was zero help as well, unwilling to split the check for the table. He blamed the inability to do so on the computer system and the 19 year old hostess who took the reservation. After a great deal of back and forth he agreed to split the check for the party. Additionally he made the point that it would take at least an hour to spilt the check and it would require his waiter to be ""off the floor"" for at least an hour while he spilt the bill. You mean the same waiter that was paid an automatic 20% gratuity? Absolutely unacceptable behavior.  At this point, it took 1.5 hours to process the $1800 tab for the table which seemed like punishment for asking to spilt the check. The next day I Received a Fraud alert from my credit card company after charges were made on my card. Turns out charges of $3243 x 2, $1481, $2151, $1075, and $648 were made to my card, all manually entered at this restaurant! I am into total shock at these thieves and now having to take action with my credit card company and the authorities. I immediately called the restaurant the next day and after 3 phones called reached the manager Richard Douglas who I spoke with at the table the day prior. He tried to reassure me these are just authorizations but I don't believe it and its clear this is criminal activity here. This restaurant and its staff are criminals and should be punished for their actions. I wish I could give the NEGATIVE stars instead of 1 out of 5.

Normally I am not a re-reviewer (tee hee) but our last meal and drinks here in the tavern prompted me. Came in on a Monday at lunch time and had drinks and burgers in the Taverna area. Scott, our bartender was great. We ordered two of the $19.00 burgers and as I cringed a little over the burger price, I sipped on my Blood Orange Martini to take the edge off. Once the burger arrived I realized I would have paid $25.00 for that burger. Hands down the best burger I have EVER had in my entire life. The beef was fabulous and topped with a generous thick slice of pancetta and white cheddar? Oh my taste buds were singing an aria to Mario. My boyfriend orders the house made chips as his side, while I opted for the arugula salad. We both agreed the arugula salad was a better choice as its bitterness and tartness balanced out the sheer delicious richness of the burger. Oh and the truffle aioli? I can honestly say I have found a mushroom I will eat. Scott topped off my martini once too! Thanks buddy! They have a special before 5, any two bloody mary's, Bellini's, or beers for $11.00 bucks.

Again, we ended up in the bar and shared a tasty bottle of chianti.  I was surprised, honestly, at how few chiantis were on the menu.  There were tons of super tuscans and other varieties, but maybe only 5 chiantis.  Weird.  

Anyhow, on to the food:
-We were given warm rosemary focaccia bread with a salty butter mousse as well as a 'lardo' mousse.  The lardo is made from curing strips of pig fat with rosemary and is quite rich; it is a nice addition to the hearty bread, but definitely in moderation!
-Started with the Affettati Misti (meat plate, basically) and the  House Cured Pastrami.  The meat plate was decent, but nothing to write home about.  I wouldn't order it again.  However, the pastrami blew me away!  It was thick, peppery, and so good!  It came with a small salad of frisee with a wonderful duck egg on the top.  The flavors came together so well.  Yum!
-With the pastas, they are served as 'appetizer' style, so they're perfect for sharing.  However, you can order any one as a diner portion for 15 bucks more.  We shared the Bucatini Amatriciana, which is still the best one I've tasted outside of Rome, and the surprisingly amazing Ravioli di Stracotto (duck livers with aged balsamic vinegar).

We ordered the arugula salad, tagliatelle with porcini, and the house made pastrami sandwich. The arugula salad was in a bath of white vinegar and nearly inedible. The tagliatelle was salty enough to choke a cow and cows lick pure salt! But worse, far worse, worst of all, was the pastrami sandwich; two massive slabs of dry, crumbly bread, more arugula, and the thinnest of thin slices of pastrami. I didn't see any pastrami so I opened the sandwich removed a slice to taste the pastrami. I still don't know what it tastes like! The horseradish mustard overpowered everything. I combined the two halves of the sandwich into one and it STILL had less pastrami than a sandwich you'd find in a vending machine at a train station yet just as appetizing!

We started with their chopped salad which was really good for the first few bites. The dressing got a little overwhelming after awhile. There were a lot of spicy peppers in there so if you don't like spicy then you don't wanna order this salad. Then we had the dry aged ribeye for two which was cooked the perfect medium rare we requested. Flavor was good topped with a little bit of salt and olive oil. We got the Yukon potato side which had a unique mashed potato feel to it. It was an interesting little dish but way too salty. We had a bottle of Malbec that paired nicely with our dinner. And for dessert we had the apple budino, an americano and green tea. Just FYI...skip dessert. The apple budino is nothing like the butterscotch budino at Pizzeria Mozza. Should've just gone with a port wine or something. 

The service started off really good but towards the end I guess our server got swamped with new tables which wasn't a good thing for us. We waited quite some time to get our check. We had to hurry up and pay and get our gambling on. The hosts were very pleasant when we walked in and when we left the restaurant. 

Ambiance was great and the decor was sophisticated. I would come back to try different dishes even though my first experience here was just mediocre. If this mediocrity happens again...I'm gonna stick with my Kona crusted steak at Capital Grille down the street.

3246176,2013-03-06,0,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"A couple random thoughts regarding Carnevino.

It's a nice restaurant and on it's own it's a great restaurants, however I've been to better. I had the bone in ribeye and it was good. However I prefer boneless steaks and I accidentally ordered the bone in so that might shroud my opinion of this place. 

However lets step back a minute. I ordered a steak, though I wasn't in the mood for a steak. I was however in the mood for some type of Italian/pasta dish and considering this is an Italian restaurant, I was in good hands. The prices of the pasta dishes however seemed too low so I asked whether these were entree size dishes or appetizers and it turns out the latter - disappointment. Why not offer an entree size dish? I suppose in hindsight I could have ordered two of the little dishes. 

Back to the steak. I ordered the steak medium, which I clarified was to be just to the right of red, just turning pink. What I got was the other end of pink, on its way to gray. I didn't return the steak since I was in a large group and didn't want to slow down the pace of the meal. 

The sides looked good. I tasted the Cauliflower Au gratin and the Mashed Potatoes. Both sides looked tastier than they actually tasted. The mashed potatoes even had a poached egg on top which you could burst the yolk to mix in the potatoes. However this was more for presentation as I didn't really taste the richness I had expected. Either that or the potatoes lacked any rich/creamy element that the yolk brought up to ground level. 

The service was on the better side. I would give the service 4/5 stars. Loss of star for empty glasses and slow delivery of bread and check - a bunch of small things like that. 

I wouldn't go back. Though this would be the best steakhouse in many midsize cities, there are too many other options in Vegas.",4u4mT3Hucpw2YUzIxBJOvA,2,0,2,sy6wAB7hb2LIr9Wm8r8Mfw

I've also tried the riserva rib eye.  FYI - the riserva is a special line of their beef aged 180-240 days and ordered by the inch ($$$$).  The riserva steaks have a higher concentration of flavor and are more tender due to the aging process.  

You'll hear that riserva steak has a rich ""blue cheese-like"" after taste and I definitely would agree with that description of uniqueness to the flavor.

We hacked our way through what was supposed to be a wonderful steak experience and really made a mess of the cut while wearing out our hands and patience simultaneously. Steaks were prepared correct but lacked flavor. At 85 for a steak I expect a wow factor, not Costco grade. 

Side of cauliflower with what seemed to be a B√©chamel sauce of sorts was OK but I've ,had similar at friends weekday dinner parties. Once again.  Not special.  Service was OK but not special either ( recurring theme here) 

Cut, the widely acclaimed Wolfgang Puck steakhouse,  was booked so we chose Carnevino the Batali steakhouse... Never again.....dull knives at a high end steakhouse.... Unbelievable....3 stars are due to the wine....... Without its a two star...",qmhwPmkoWzjXspconrTCZQ,2,0,3,ljWA-UzStGduVa4JQkgavg

Atmosphere - posh
Food - excellent

Our party of ten had their sights set on some serious meat and most of us decided on either the dry aged bone in ribeye or the La Fiorentina (Florentine porterhouse).

Because our group was fairly large, the waiter suggested doing a family style dinner and allowing the chef to bring out his recommendations. He asked for our per person budget and said the chef would tailor the dinner to our party. 

So much food was served that I lost track of what exactly we had, but based on our tab, below is what I think we ate. All I remember was that the food was truly amazing! 

The porterhouse is the THE steak that everyone must try. So flavorful, so buttery, so good. 

Our menu...

- grilled octopus
- fried calamari
- cheese balls in a napkin
- affettati (chef's selection of house cured meats)

- beef cheek ravioli
- cannoloni
- gnocchi
- truffle

- ribeye
- porterhouse
- lamb chops
- black rossini

- mash potatoes
- spinach
- mushroom

- Fernet Branca -- The waiter recommended this menthol smelling, bitter tasting, alcohol infused after dinner drink. It had a medicinal quality to it and was suppose to be good for our digestion, even curing or at least preventing a possible a hangover.

We did bring two magnum bottles of our own wine. And, whoa, the corkage fee was an astounding $75 per bottle.

Well...a steak house serving their finest foods omakase style.  I loved it. This is one of the best steakhouses that I've ever been to. The service and presentation were superb. Everything from the appetizers to the pastas to the steaks was just fantastic. 

The astronomical price (even for Vegas) is the only thing holding it back from a fifth star.",rl64kysIAlSg7zwCvGzjzw,3,1,4,yNqRTxQtMs3g9m7thauzOQ

FYI many restaurants are doing meal specials, most likely due to the tightening of American pocketbooks.  Anyways dinner consisted of and Appetizer or Salad, and choice of protein (I got the filet).  I opted for the beef carpaccio which was good.  Second course is the Filet and honestly it wasn't anything I couldn't have made at home myself.  Sides of mushroom and broccoli were ok.  Dessert was ok also.  

The second time I ate there we ate in the bar because after 10pm till close they offer 20% off the full menu if you eat in the bar.  What the heck right?  So a co-worker and I opt for the full on 70$ per person dry aged BBL porterhouse cooked rare.  The beef was super rare when it was brought out and carved tableside.  They dressed it with extra virgin olive oil prior to serving based on the ""Chef's recommendation"".  It was ok.. I mean 70 dollars.. per person.. for steak?  That's tough to swallow but I wanted to experience it.  

Most interesting thing:  Choice of butter for your bread or seasoned LARD.  Yes!

Not that great:  The seasoned ciabatta they use for bread.  It's seasoning masks the flavor of anything you put on it.  I'll take a nice crusty baggette anyday.

Star Power:  Scott Ian from Antrax was standing not 10 feet from us in the bar.

Service was excellent as is with most LV steak joints and in this town there is a lot of competition.

3303944,2012-10-25,1,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"Ugh the disappointment is overwhelming.

I loooove Mario Batali because i don't really trust skinny chefs... which is not a problem for that fine gentleman, but I don't know what they hell happened at Carnevino.

Take a look at the other Yelp reviews on this page, A restaurant of this caliber, which caters to these discerning diners, and charges as much as this place does, should have nothing less than 4 stars. But I guess I am not the only person to see the lackluster performance of the place.

Now by all means, the food is not bad. The bone-in rib eye is massive, the taste is decent but it came out quite dry with a questionable texture. I like the fact that it was cut tableside, but we ordered it medium-rare but it came out medium-well if anything.  Sides such as the corn with lime and chilies is ok, while the eggplant with tomato and ricotta cheese was good but far from impressive. I would speculate that these dishes could have been made by an amateur chef, not what I'd expect from Mario Batali.

One of major issues with the place was simply the price. The average diner cannot get out of here under $100, add even more if go with wine pairing. Now, I don't have an issue with paying if the food is worth it, but I am not sure if thats the case here. The fact is that there are alot of high-end steakhouses on and around the strip that compete for your business. For the money you are going to spend here, you are better off at Wolfgang's Cut (also in the Palazzo) SW at the Wynn, and even save some cash and check out Capital Grille across the street.",ALw8EN21lby0vWtfD6JfIw,1,0,2,Rk5bKKFnnIs6H2MEFLdWEA

I should never be refilling my wine myself when buying a bottle.  The servers didn't seem to communicate well.  Dont get me wrong the service was ok, but didn't fare much better than a night at the olive garden.  The food was....eh.  The stories are correct they will even tell you when you order a steak to order it cooked one temp higher because they under cook.  Seriously, you serve steak round the clock, you should know how to cook a steak by now.  I had to order it medium to get medium rare, completely unacceptable.  It did come out as I wanted which was medium rare, however it was charred on the outside.  The cooks need a trip to Old Homestead at Borgata or NY to see how a steak is suppose to be cooked.  It's suppose to seal the flavor not change it to burnt.  The italian fare was again very so so.  Again din;t get me wrong, if the cost was half of what it is, then I wouldn't be bothered.

3306520,2011-08-23,1,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"I came here after hearing raves about this place from personally notable steak-eating friends from LA.  I'm not sure why other people would come here and not get any of the Beef Tasting Menu- it's sort of like going to the fresh seafood place on the pier and ordering the pre-frozen stuff. I arrived to vegas early friday for what is to be the beginning of a jam packed party weekend.  I 'open tabled' our reservation of 2 for friday evening and decided to get a black label and tonic instead of a red so I don't fall asleep trying to hang at XS.

Steak:
We ordered the 26oz Bone-in-ribeye for 2 ($72 each, $144).  It's the one in the picture that looks like something Fred Flintstone would be chomping on while yelling Yabba Dabba Doo in between bites.  I'd give the steak broil quality/technique (9.5/10), Tenderness consistency (9/10), Overall taste (9.3/10).  The steak is cut for you (cutting the steak properly is almost as important as the broil), however you may need to cut it smaller.  In comparison to Mastros, I would say this comes in a close second...on a good Carnevino day it may even surpass Mastros. I'm not sure why some reviewers are complaining about lack of taste on the raw portion of the steak... do they expect the chefs to inject marinade into the meat?! That's how steak is folks..Yes they give you the large bone with little pieces of meat hanging on it so you can feel like a king sitting next to his recently killed prey.

Bread/Sides:
We were given traditional Italian Rosemary bread with a unique butter blend and also a separate lard-based paste.  I used each by themself then together- using them together was my final choice to finish.  So many of the previous reviewers complained about the bread and the butter/lard...what they don't understand is this is an Italian restaurant and so the bread/butter selection will not be the same as an American steakhouse- get cultured folks.  In addition to the steaks, we got the spinach cream side... for some reason I was expecting the side that Lawry's gives, but this one is basically raw spinach cloves tossed with italian spices and some buttery garnish all seared for probably 30 seconds.  This is definitely not a place to come to if you are sad about losing $20 on the slot machines as the prices are slightly above the majority of premium steakhouses I've been to.",tQyZ71zqHmMoQBhHGh8-Ug,3,1,4,Cvz5kk7cigkTdWFsJNmP4A
3312644,2016-02-28,0,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"Amazing. 

I'm a foodie, my foodie friends met up for a party of 10 at Carnevino. Our reservation was upheld, we sat immediately. The design of the place is intriguing. There are multiple rooms and hallways which is a nice departure from ordinary. 

PRICE: 
Don't panic when looking at the 150.00 ribeye steak. This steak feeds more then two people. Trust your wait staff when they advise you to order family style. Our group of 10 ate like kings, we tried several sides and with 20% tip we ended up with 150.00 per person which isn't too awful considering the quality of food and spot on service. 

FOOD:
Trust your chef. We started with some fried cheese balls and bread with the infamous pork fat spread which was tasty but rich so go easy tiger. 
The steak--you can't go to an Italian steakhouse and not order beef. The ribeye is dry aged longer then any other eatery in town the salt/pepper/Rosemary rub is simple and delightfully delicate after cooking and tasting. Our table of 10 ordered four steaks and we had a full steak leftover. These slabs are huge. Table-side steak carving is a treat. You are spoiled by exceptional service from beginning to end of this dinner experience. 
We tried the mashed potatoes with the mascarpone and poached egg, the roasted Brussels sprouts, mushrooms, artichokes, pumpkin pasta, and the infamous off menu beef cheek ravioli and 25 year balsamic. 
We tasted the tangerine sorbet and the pear gelato for desserts-astounding flavor profiles for each plate. 

SERVICE:
Our waters and cocktails never ran dry. Seemed like we had 8 servers working out table through the night. The hot hand towels with lemon and herbs is a sweet finishing touch.

I went alone and ended up at about $110 after tax. That huge bill included a $70 dry aged New York strip, a side of Brussels sprouts and a break me gently cocktail. 2/3 of these purchases were purely fantastic. The strip at medium rare was stupendous - top 3 steak I've ever had. Cooked to perfection surely. The fatty portions even had a hint of foie gras, melt in your mouth, feeling which was fantastic. The cocktail was another plus for the meal. Not overly strong, but it seemed like a scotch old fashioned taste wise, but smoother. The Brussels sprouts were disappointing, or better yet not as good as I was expecting considering the waiter hyped them up as the best veggie side when i asked for a recommendation. They wee more saut√©ed than my preferred roasted and the ham, although solid, was kind of just thrown into the dish. I felt these were more of an appetizer than a side. 

Big Beal but big flavor to match. Fantastic steak and great drinks. Honestly, considering it's a steakhouse, what more can you ask for.

-Dry Aged Bone-In Ribeye for 2 $144: WOW for this dish- they bring over a huge piece of bone-in ribeye and carve it at your table, which is a cool bonus presentation. We ordered it medium rare, and it came out perfect even though our server warned us it might be on the rare side. The ribeye tasted good on it's own, but adding a sauce to dip our meat in would have been a good idea. There was a lot of beef to go around, but I'm not sure it if was worth $144.. maybe $100 or $125 max.
-Bison Carpaccio (Garlic, Radish Greens, Basil $19): YUM- the bison is sliced super thin and the meat melts in your mouth. A must order in my opinion.
-Side of Roasted Beets (w/ Pistachios and Gorgonzola $9): Solid- the beets were nice and tender but the overall dish didn't work super well together.
-Strawberry Shortcake (w/ Honey Macerated Strawberries $13): Pretty good, but the shortcake pieces were small and I didn't think it was worth $13.
-Vanilla Bean Affogato: Solid affogato.

Again, although I enjoyed most of my dishes here, I just wasn't wowed. For the price point and portion sizes, I won't be back- there are just so many other amazing restaurants to eat at in Vegas! If you really love steak, I would recommend coming to try the bone-in ribeye and bison carpaccio, as long as you're prepared for the damage it will do to your wallet.",76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg,2,1,3,-55WjQCSle_-Vd1WjRCioQ

The food was great.  This place was good but we expected more for the price we paid!   

My husband and I ordered rib eye for 2 ($152) and that didn't include anything but one big piece of ribeye.  Meat was delicious but prices seemed high EVEN for Vegas. 

We ordered two sides that we shared one was a mashed potatoes with egg and it was delicious and the other side was corn that our waiter recommended and it was also delicious.

Lots of kids all ages.  Not very romantic but had pretty dark lighting.  Lots of different serves that filled water glasses and brought by bread.  Our waiter was a bit off and made of feel uncomfortable. 

The wine list was +300% marked up.  We love wine and are very familiar with prices and vintages. The bottle we ordered retailed for $55 but the restaurant price was $170.

Being a big fan of Batali's shows on Food Network, I was really excited about getting a chance to eat at Carnevino.  Unfortunately, this was the biggest culinary disappointment I've experienced in a long time.  First of all, I know it's Vegas but this place is horribly overpriced for what you get.  If I'm ordering $40+ pasta entrees, they better be some of the most rich, incredible pasta I've ever had.  (I had the black fettuccine with crab). Instead, it tasted like something I could whip up myself on a monday night using about $2 worth of ingredients.  Actually scratch that, it didn't taste like something I would whip up because I wouldn't have made it so bland.  Another member of our group nearly sent his pasta back because it was too salty, overwhelming any other flavor present.  Their 'family style' portions ($40+) were what I would expect a half portion to be ... the half portions ($17 - $24) were appetizer-sized and cannot be considered a meal.  I am a 170 pound male, not a large person.  If this is what Mario Batalli considers to be full size portions I seriously wonder how he can stay so overweight :)

We ordered several $9 sides with our meals and all of them were just ordinary.  Nothing stood out.  Very average.  No flavor.  There was only one entree that someone else ordered that looked impressive to me and that was the veal chop ... big, 2"" thick and practically hanging off the plate with the bone in.  Unfortunately not many people in our party ordered meat dishes which is the general theme of the restaurant, so I guess the moral is if you do decide to go here stay away from the pasta and go with the meat.  

The wine list as noted by others below is very extensive but offers few if any reasonably priced options.

All in all it was a two-course meal that took 3 hours.  TWO COURSES took 3 HOURS.  I don't know what was taking so long in the kitchen but we were dying by the end.  And still hungry after dropping $100+ per person.  I gave the review 2 stars instead of 1 because the waitstaff were very professional and I at least FELT like I was dining at a 5-star restaurant, even if the food didn't reflect that.

I left Carnevino craving some Macaroni Grill badly.  That should speak volumes.  If you want to drop some big bucks on a nice Italian meal in Vegas, look elsewhere.",4j8RwoqmttRElCCGAHAI5g,6,4,2,PFCS8IBYDOU4qzbzU56CBQ

We asked the server who was the only nice person about salad size and was good but cost for 6 lettuce cut in a square and an anchovy and toasted bread on top. Was told good for two but not for one.  Got the side of mash with the egg and bacon which was the best. My wife's steak was cooked good and mine was cooked four times!!! Never right. I had to watch her eat then when mine was right she watched me.  I paid 290 dollars our bill which I should have walked and missed 15 mins of the show!!!

3405065,2010-02-11,0,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"Not too impressed with the bone-in ribeye for a joint that specializes in steak. I think that the trend these days for upscale steak joints is for the restaurant staff to cut the steak for you tableside and serve the bone on seperate plate, a-la Peter Lugers.

The steak lacked flavor and could have been more tender. It seems a little ridiculous that if you would like one of their sauces it is an additional $5 on top of the $65 you pay for the a la cart steak.

I did enjoy my Osso Buco with Saffron orzo which was a reasonable $35 I believe. My group also shared a steamed lobster appetizer that was accompanied by some fried stuffed squash blossoms that was pretty yummy, albeit for the price of $60.

I didn't care for the bread with the lardo, I preferred the butter. The little complimentary fried cheese bread balls tasted like extremely salty cheez-its.

The side spinach was boring and overpriced at $9 and the waiter recommended eggy mashy potato thing was not memorable, literally. I don't even remember what it taste like or looked like.

We ordered 2 bottles of Joe Bastianich vino at $80/bottle. I have to say they were very good. Probably marked up 400%

I'm glad I tried this spot because I'm a huge fan of Mario and Joe's mother Lidia but I won't be coming back here anytime soon.",dyUwFl7ZvEylbw3doXVL_Q,0,0,2,TKiiZ9BgfOWKnJOHyV3rAA

Got a table by the bar as we had no reservations, but tables were half open. Understand that reservations are a must, but do not talk to guests as if you were saving their life for getting bar tables to sit at. 
When seated our waiter was pleasant and knowledgeable of the menu. When our salads were served, another waiter brought out a cheese grater. He skipped over 2 of us, as he felt he had to keep looking at the Oklahoma Ohio State football game which we had interfered with and walked away. 
Group of 6 drunk fools standing in the bar by our table making it difficult for the  waiter to serve food. One of them put his drink down on our table to check his phone. If we weren't with our wives celebrating an occasion, I would have dumped it on his head. Rude to say the least. 
The appetizer (calamari) was nothing special.It was bland and a small portion. Soups? Don't have any.  The pasta I had was Horrible! I have had better pasta and sauce out of a can. Couldn't finish the small portion. The wives thought the food was ok. 
I will say the bread was very delicious. Too bad I had to fill up in bread to eliminate my hunger. 
Final thought: No need to spend  $$$$ at this place. Find another $$$$ place for the money. 1 Star is generous, and if I could go lower i would. VERY DISAPPOINTING!",5ts0G0fMvrr5KTowWtl6PA,4,0,1,Z_MJ0R1HILPURU26pvPbLA

The service was phenomenal from our very helpful waiter to the sweet sommelier who recognized a girl who knows what she wants when he sees one. 

Food wise, we sampled a lot. This included our standout favorite, grilled octopus, light citrusy scallops and a salad to start. For our entrees, we shared a variety if steaks. They sure do undercook things here by a lot so mention your preferences more than twice. They thankfully refired the bloody as hell New York that I asked to be well done. I don't dig red cow- just brown cow for me. Our sides of asparagus and the mashed potatoes were to die for though. Love. Never had an egg in the potatoes before though.

3441354,2008-09-22,7,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"I've been to Carnevino twice and have been very disappointed both times.  I'm a big fan of Mario Batali and had high expectations.  I've been to Osteria Mozza in LA and absolutely loved it. But my two dinners at Carnevino have been hugely disappointing.

Food-wise, the steaks at Carnevino are just okay.  Both times I've been there, I've ordered steak prepared the way the chef prefers - usually rare or medium rare.  Both times I've found the steak to be too tough, too chewy or too fatty.  The taste is good but I've had steaks at some of the best steakhouses in the world and this place is 3rd tier -- not second tier, 3rd tier.  Mortons and The Palm, even the Old Homestead are better.  Don't go here for steak.  

And I hate to say it, but don't go here for the pasta either.  I've been disappointed both times with the pasta which is just ho-hum.  Compared to our nearly orgasmic experience at Osteria Mozza, this wasn't even in the same ballpark.  I hate to admit it but we had a much better meal at Rao's the night before (even though their meatballs are too dense).

We went to Carnevino to celebrate my bachelor party -- there were 10 of us -- and I can honestly say that the poor and insulting service ruined our dinner.  Thanks being huge a-holes Carnevino!  Let me explain.

The sommelier  (Kirk) was a complete and utter douchebag to my friends. One of my friends asked if they carried a certain wine and Kirk's response was, ""Good God no.""  It wasn't like we requested Night Train but this a-hole Kirk acted aghast, the needle skipped off the record, EF Hutton-style.  ""Good God no... too buttery."" That's a really pompous answer and made my friends feel like crap.  Thanks Kirk, you pretentious wine Nazi.  I hope your acrid douchebaggery gets you far in life.  A better answer would have been, ""Sorry sir, we don't carry that wine.""  You're lucky you didn't get your twitty glasses knocked off your face.

Secondly, the waiter (don't remember his name but he was a tall dude and also wore hipster 50s style glasses) suggested that we order a bunch of appetizers and pastas for the table.  We said sure, but I told him that some of the people don't eat shellfish so stay away from seafood.  What did we get?  Calamari (shellfish), crab salad (shellfish), and another seafood dish.  Moreover, we got 5 sets of 3 -- 15 appetizers for 10 people (with pasta and main dishes to come.)  It felt like the guy was trying to take advantage of us.  It was too much food.

Also, we received an extra dessert that nobody ordered.  We pointed it out to the waiter and instead of just leaving it (which is typically what is done in a fine restaurant, considering that we're running up a bill of over $2,000) he took the dessert away.  I mean, how much of a dick can you be?  We spend over $2,000 there and you're going to take a cruddy little dessert off the table?  I think that really says it all.

On the spectrum of ""fine restaurants"" this gets 1 star; on the spectrum of all restaurants, maybe 2.5-3 stars. None of us will ever eat there again and I'll do my best to spread the word about how crappy the service and food is at this place.  I will continue to patronize Mario Batali's restaurants because I can only presume he doesn't know how bad this place really is but if you have good taste and know what it is to get good service, you'll give the middle finger to Carnevino.",9HyAuq4Vfv7JRsQrGj2etA,8,4,1,Kg9g5tQJ4UwhbhV4h9cdOA

They were cleaning a few tables off so we sat at the bar and ordered drinks(blood orange cosmos) which were SO FREAKING GOOD!! They called us for our table and told us we had to close our tab at the bar first. We did that and they sat us in the overflow room right across from the main building. If your being frugal this is NOT the place, I repeat NOT the place. Very expensive, but they have deals for people sharing a steak. Best thing to do if you wanna save a bit of money here, is to go with someone and agree to which type of steak you both will be sharing. Don't worry it's a large steak so it will be enough. They have the steak deal but everything is ala carte. We both picked a side (asparagus and mash potato) and the sides are each enough for two people, so that got us a full meal. But back to the steak, OMGEEEE! DELICIOUS. It was so juicy and tender on the inside,slight crisp on the outside and so well flavored, and there's nothing like a medium cooked steak, mmm. The potato was probably some of the best I ever had.

3470114,2013-10-28,0,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"Quick note-my star ratings are always based on the food, period. You can  literally go and look at the pricing on any menu in the world and decide if you want to pay $72 for a ribeye.  The exact price is available to all of us. Yelp is to help us understand what we are getting for that $72. Service should be noted in the review but not the star rating in my opinion.  Too variable even at the same restaurants. So I note it, but don't rate on it. 

Short review-Carnevino is a giant fail at the first part of their name, the beef. Not only isn't it close to what a high end restaurant should be serving, my own home cooking is much, much better than the beef my two friends and I received.  The rest of the food we got was very good to great, especially the pasta, but I will note that even for those dishes there are much better options on the strip.  Certainly cheaper ones, though again that didn't factor in to the one star rating.

Longish review- Carnevino started off quite well.  Their house bread was very good, they serve it with butter or pork fat and my friend loved the pork fat option.  Amuse Bouche was a cheese ball, not very good. Dry.  We got lobster tail and scallops as appetizers, both very good, definitely expertly cooked.  The pasta was excellent, ravioli with egg, ricotta and brown butter was great and the anolini with lobster and tarragon I'd eat again in a heartbeat. Understand that although they claim these are served ""family style"" there isn't much there in each plate. 1 large ravioli. 7 small anolini. 

We also ordered the gnocchi, but only just before the entrees were set to come out. The waiter actually looked annoyed by my request, then recovered and said ok.  My friend asked me if I had received his permission?  The gnocchi itself was probably below average, but I'd eat it again. 

The entrees were the disaster here. I got short ribs, my friends got the filet and a NY Strip respectively. All were at that quality level where you are in the supermarket and you talk yourself into a subpar cut because it's on sale... Then later you are kicking yourself. One of my friends works at a meat lab, he knows his stuff. He asked the waiter what BBL Beef is. The waiter explained at length, and when he walked off my friend explained that he should've just said ""sub-prime"". 

My short rib was both dry and incorrectly braised because it still had pockets of stringy fat on it.  They make you pay $5 for sauce, which I used liberally because it was very tasty, but more to moisten the short rib.  Tom Colicchio isn't losing any sleep about Battali stealing his short rib crown. Bleah. 

If this were the only restaurant in your hometown, I'd say take a fat wallet and go for the pasta. Since this is in Las Vegas, I'd say go to any number of better options. Craftsteak. Delmonicos. Stripsteak. I could go on and on.  No need to risk it here, and no need to pay so dang much either.",hHVkahiev66fTMb-bKmfaw,8,0,1,FKY8AMi9qDhIdIzv6hbPzA

3496521,2011-03-25,0,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"Honestly, two stars is generous.

From the moment we sat down, it was painfully obvious that our waiter had one thing on his mind: to convince us to spend as much money as possible. Before we even said a word about the appetizers, he was telling us we should order two, because they are small. Same for the pasta. Same for the side dishes. (They ARE small, by the way. We paid $19 for one single lonely raviolo, but if you are getting a steak and some sides, you just don't need individual appetizers and plates of pasta.) He told us we needed to try the $120/person tasting menu, because it REALLY showcased what Mario Batali is known for, and then proceeded to name-drop ""Mario Batali"" about half a dozen more times before leaving our table. Oh, and then there was the older couple at a table nearby who were obviously spending more money than we were, and when they tried to get the waiter's attention, he stopped in the middle of explaining something to us and scurried over to their table without saying a word to excuse himself. The minute we ordered diet coke instead of wine, any pretenses of good service were all out the window. What? I just don't like wine.

But what about the food? Okay, well, I've had better. Specifically, I've had better steaks and sides at CUT, also at Palazzo. (It's a bit more expensive but worth every single penny.) The filet mignon I had at CV was just all right. It was also way overcooked; I ordered medium rare and it came out more like medium well, despite the waiter's insistence that ""their"" medium rare was a bit rarer than usual. So much for that!

Skip this place. It is crappy. If you are going to spend $200+ at a meal, it needs to be a lot better than this.",rUW7_B9pBNdDR3Y2bBz9TQ,1,0,2,yRB9Hdwx4n5OhNL_bBmlBA

3517298,2010-12-29,0,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"The first time I went to Carnevino (last year) it was one of the best meals I've ever had. This time around the experience fell short.

To start we ordered the fried calamari and the big eye tuna crudo. The calamari was excellent and the hot peppers in the dish added a good amount of heat without dominating the flavor. The tuna came with approximately eight small slices and were arranged in order of leanest to fattiest. All were delicious, especially the fatty ones. Just don't expect large chunks of fish to come out if you order this dish.

Next up was the black fettucine. Served as a small portion, this is meant to be the equivalent of an appetizer. It sounded good when our waiter recommended it, because it came with crab, jalape√±os, and shallots. But the dish just didn't deliver. There wasn't much crab to speak of and the taste and overly-firm texture of the pasta was a turn off.

For our entrees, both couples ordered the dry aged bone-in ribeye for two. At $65 per person, it wasn't cheap but if was more than enough meat for all of us. They wheel it out on a cart and slice it tableside. The dish is finished with a touch of sea salt and olive oil. Our ribeye was a slightly bloody medium rare as we ordered and absolutely delicious. They also leave the bone on the table which was one of the best parts of the meal. I wasn't going to be shy about trying it either. I picked it up and gnawed on it for a while, cleaning off all the meat I could. And, I have to say that the meat from the bone was the most flavorful and memorable bites of the night. As good as that steak was however, I prefer the ribeye at CUT to this one. Not only is it cheaper (per person), but the smaller and thinner cut of beef allowed for more seasoning and more of the crust on each bite.

Our sides were the sauteed mixed mushrooms with spring onions, brussels sprouts with pancetta, and a butternut squash dish with pine nuts and capers. All were amazing and the brussels sprouts were some of the best I've ever had.

So, while I still think Carnevino is an excellent restaurant, I would recommend it for the appetizers and sides (you can't go wrong with any of the ones we tried) but the pastas can be hit or miss. Their filet mignon, which I had my previous visit, is amazing and still ranks as the best filet I've ever had. I'm still tempted to go back and try their porterhouse for two or their riserva steak -- aged for over a year.

The operative words that come to mind when I hear the name Mario Batali. Sadly, the overpriced, lackluster fare at Carnevino only made me the latter! But, as a disclaimer, it has been quite a while since my visit here, so hopefully they've made some improvements since then. 

Located in The Palazzo, Carnevino semi-failed from the get-go. While it maintains the top-notch customer service and decadent, chic decor expected of a high-end Vegas establishment, the ambience was marred by the raucous sound of Beastie Boys blarring from the stereo system. I'm not neccessarily opposed to them, but the likes of ""Intergalatic"" and ""Sabatoge"" didn't jive well with the up-scale environment.  

The menu was sneaky too. So, watch out! Case in point, the prices listed for the pastas range from $17-$31; however, these are for appetizer portions only. An additional $15 needs to be tacked on for the entree size. Also, the steak for two is listed as $72, but it's $72 PER PERSON, making it a whopping $144.  A steak legitimately worth that much wouldn't be for eating, as it should be plated in precious metals and embedded with Swarvoski crystals.

We ended up ordering the Bison Carpaccio & Fried Calamari appetizers, 16-oz bone-in New York strip, Grilled Sweetbreads, & Pork Milanese. Pretty much all the main courses failed, and for an establishment that boasts ""the highest-quality, excellently prepared steaks"" I was seriously expecting more than the the chewy, bland New York strip that was served. The appetizers were actually pretty good, and I'd recommend getting the Bison Capaccio. But other than that, the highlights of the meal were the complimentary cheese puffs & the bread w/butter & peppered lard. 

Needless to say, this was a sad way to start out our trip in Vegas. Luckily, our night of debauchery at XS later on that night made up for it. Two stars!",5eLI-Lbjjy0lC2hABS32Sg,10,8,2,Xc4q5xw5c2m6GQtxMIHQTA

They do try to steer you towards the more expensive entrees (the meats), which is kinda off-putting, and saying that the pasta is not eaten as a main (basically telling you how you should order) - if I want to order a starter and pasta only, I will, thanks! It's one thing if you're informing the guest on portion sizes or whatever, but phrase it that way vs telling people what to order. 

The bread, butter and tallow they give you at the start is delicious - maybe my favorite thing! The mashed potatoes with egg yolk and bacon is very impressive looking but not sure it added anything to the already creamy potatoes.

3557393,2012-12-18,9,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"What a joke. I must preface my review by saying that I'm not accustomed to eating at restaurants like this, where prices are so high you need to mortgage your house just to have dinner. But I was vacationing in Vegas with a large group of friends and this is where they wanted to eat. So I gave it a shot!

One quick glance at the menu and I knew I was going to break the bank. I took a moment to map out my game plan and decided on ordering the ravioli plus a side item so my wallet wouldn't take too much of a beating. My wife, also alarmed by the prices decided to order the gnocchi and a side item (quick recap, with a little wine we're way over $100 at this point. ouch)

My first red flag should have been when the waiter pointed out that the ""ravioli"" was actually a ""raviol-o"" - as in singular - as in just one piece of ravioli - as in what the hell? I scratched my head. $25 for 1 ravioli?? The price must be wrong or it must be a huge, delicious, giant, thick piece of ravioli. I asked the waiter to describe it and with his hands he made a rather large circle. So I assumed it would be a decent sized dish. OK I'll order it.

HA! 45 minutes later (yes 45 minutes) I was served the tiniest, thinnest, smallest ravioli you have ever seen. It was roughly the the size and thickness of a ritz cracker. 1 cracker. for $25!! Then came my ""side item"", also rather small. I wish I had a stopwatch at the dinner table - it took me about 45 seconds to eat everything. Roughly 3 spoonfuls and I was done!

My friends (all of whom have large bank accounts) ordered many dishes. I was shocked at how small everything was. A a spoonful here, a tiny dollop there, and somehow these ""dishes"" were worthy of $50 price tags. I just sat there in disbelief. I sat there watching other people eat because I had already blown my $100 on my single ravioli and my wifes pasta. 

In the end our bill came out to roughly $200 - for two people who basically ate nothing and drank a little wine. It was so bad it ended up ruining the rest of my night. I was not a happy camper and while everyone else went back to gambling I grabbed a slice of pizza at the hotel (delicious, i should have eaten there) and went to my room to watch tv. 

Look - I understand that there are lots of people out there with money to burn who like to live that way - they're willing to spend $50 on a tiny scoop of pasta because the restaurant is ""exclusive"" and has a big fancy chef's name attached to it - but give me a break! My ""raviolo"" didn't even taste good! It had almost no flavor and my side dish tasted microwaved. My wife said her gnocchi was fine but she had tasted better pasta at small chain restaurants back home. 

My wife summed it up best when she turned to me at the table and whispered: this is the most pretentious place I have ever been to in my life.

We knew going in that it was a steakhouse, but we had just eaten steak the night before. Wanting to try Mario Batali's restaurant, we opted for a salad and a sampling of the pastas with a side of the scrumptious potatoes. 

We tried three pastas: Short Rib Beef Ravioli - little pillows of heaven stuffed with tender, succulent short ribs. A definite must try! Bucatini all' Amatriciana - a twist on old fashion spaghetti with a hint of pancetta or guanciale, not sure which. Tagliatelle - a delicate balance of pasta, light sauce, and delectable mushrooms. ...and lastly, the potatoes! Mascarpone & Guanciale Mashed Potatoes - I can almost taste them melting in my mouth. The perfect blend of potatoes, cheese, guanciale and the egg yolk - a first for me. 

Oh, and how can I forget the Tiramisu?! Homemade mascarpone - thick and rich, well balanced, chilled to the perfect temperature. Some of the best I have ever enjoyed. My husband tried the Coconut Cream Bomboloni, which seemed like airy doughnut holes atop a mouthwatering German chocolate like cake frosting. Delish!

We started the night off with a few drinks. (The wine menu here is absolutely incredible.) After the first drink we immediately ordered a split plate of the beef cheek ravioli. The flavor on this mixed with the 20 year balsamic vinegar is really astonishing. It's an off menu item so you need to ask for it if you want to try it.

We were then handed menus which we immediately sat down as we were looking forward to hearing the off menu riserva steaks that were available. But to our dismay there were no riservas available. So we settled for the porterhouse for two cooked to medium rare. Keep in mind they cook to a true medium rare here so chances are it's a bit more pink than you are used to. The flavor and presentation were spot on and cooked to perfection.

Five stars even though they did not have the riserva steaks this time but I can't really fault them as I know those steaks are very difficult to keep as they are aged for so long it doesn't take much to spoil one.",jTrABQ5qwpfw7IZEu_zPAA,0,0,5,rXtpElhBhozNPvRYhxKqTg

They have a dry aged bone in ribeye or porterhouse for two. They will carve and slice it table-side while explaining which pieces of meat they are cutting and some flavor profiles.  I thought that the presentation and service was amazing.

I know this restaurant is known for its meat, but their octopus dish is probably the most tender and unique spin with the pickled veggies and limoncello. Definitely start with their grilled octopus if you're a seafood fan and about to gorge yourself on red meat. The rosemary bread was good and the pork lard (yes lard) was pretty brave to put on a table given the fact lard = pig fat, but it tasted good with that delicious bread. (Don't get full of bread!)

Note that their medium is a true medium, which means pretty raw for me. We got it medium-well and I thought it was served perfectly. Some meat will be more thoroughly cooked than others, so two people sharing can have the best of both medium and medium-well in our case. The marscapone mashed potato with egg was better than the spinach and garlic side. We actually didn't finish either because we were concentrating on the meat! No sauces needed - the meat is so flavorful on its own.

Wine by the glass is pretty pricey. Wine by the bottle - oh my $$$. Lastly, dessert was underwhelming. I thought the bombolino donuts with the two sauces were good, but it wasn't out of this world good!

We spent 3 wholes days there, just to eat one meal, because thats all you do for a bachelor party of course. The dinner started at 8pm, and didn't finish until a bit past midnight. Four hours is a long amount of time to eat one meal, but when you're served over 18 dishes, and grill 4 60 ounce steaks, it can take some time to prepare.

We were treated to basically our own room, and personal service from what seemed like their entire staff. I don't even remember what we received, but basically we got a tasting of over half the menu in one seating. In one meal i had my first taste of sweet breads, beef tartar, beef carpaccio, and lardo. Each were delicious in their own right. Sweet breads were described to me as the best chicken nugget i'll ever have, even tho they're not sweet, not bread, and actually made of cow.

After the appetizers 5 orders of pasta came to the table. The best out of all of them was the Ravioli Di Stracotto (duck livers), and i normally don't like liver, but this was damn good. 

Finally the main course arrived, and we were in awe and in shock of the size of steak that we were ill-prepared to feast upon.

Out of the three I would recommend the eggplant and a distance second the potato (which comes with cheese an egg on top of it) - only because it made the potato very heavy and filling.   The caulifower was aweful...under cooked with little or no flavor.

And now for steak....it was beautiful to look at...it came to the table with two waiters - one of whom preceded to sprinkle some sea salt and olive oil on the steak and carve it up into evenly sliced portions.   We order it medium well and that was achieved,  however after that the flavor and taste were okay..maybe we should have ordered one of the many sauces which came ala carte but was not recommended by our waiter.   Speaking of waiters, we only saw ours three times, once to take our order, once to ask us if we wanted desert and next to give us the bill...the most attention given to us was by a young lady with a water pitcher who would diligently fill our glass of water if she noticed it was not topped off...bless her heart.  On the subject of water, since neither my buddy or myself drink alcohol and are watching our sugar in take we ordered water...what we got was ""tap water""....really for the amount of money we paid ($220 +) they could not give us some filtered agua...

In summary...find another steakhouse that will give you a better value for your money...but if you do decide to go...order the chicken. 

Would recommend Mario Batali (who I am a big fan of) do an ""...under cover Boss"" to do some QA/QC on this beautiful location.",VX0_RBlv4scUeKV_vNYfZQ,0,0,3,QsmwgfbOR_jpSI-7qIjpjQ

3715762,2015-07-10,3,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"Let's start with the name.  Carne = meat and Vino = wine.  Yes please.   

Needed to find a special restaurant for a birthday we were celebrating in Las Vegas.  As a fan of Mario Batali's restuarants in LA, I didn't hesitate to book a reservation at Carnevino, especially since we were already staying in the hotel.  In Las Vegas, its always easier to book experiences within the bounds of your resort.  Easy to do at Venetian/Palazzo.  

Our dinner was absolutely amazing, and I'm referring to the whole experience, not just the food.  The restaurant is elegant and the service was on point.  We had a team of servers doting on us all night.  The food though, was heavenly.  Their steaks are truly extraordinary; dry-aged on site, then rubbed with sea salt, black pepper and fresh rosemary to achieve tenderness and signature flavor.  The menu also offers all kinds of beautiful homemade pastas, salads, and side dishes all inspired from Italian street food.  But trust me, this is no street food joint.  The menu is rich and sophisticated, with prices to match.  

The meal is served family style.  I was one of a party of four.  We ordered two salads, two steaks (as recommended by our waiter), two sides- mashed potatoes and spinach.   This was entirely too much food.  The steaks were HUGE. 

The ""charred dry-aged rib-eye for two"" easily feeds four!  The ""dry aged bone-in NY strip for two"" could have easily served four as well.  We would have been fine with just one steak between the four of us.  

**Beware! They do a hell of an up-sell here.  The waiter had suggested we order two appetizers and two pastas, in addition to what we ordered!  Here we are, four LA girls, and this guy's pushing food for eight hungry men returning from sea.  Really?  (insert irritated face here).** 

Having recently eaten at Bestia in LA (another fabulous Italian carnivore den) and mistakenly followed the waiters suggestion, I knew that was too much food!  What's the deal with these types of restaurants and the food up-sell?  Its annoying.  Even cutting his suggestion considerably was too much food!  I considered knocking off a star for this, but overall, this place is definitely first class, so 5 stars it is!  

Oh, I should mention that the cocktails and wine were fantastic too!  We had a fabulous time at Carnevino.  This was definitley a dinner I will always remember fondly.

I came in prepared to have dry lettuce and wine as my meal (lol) but left SO satisfied that I needed to come home and write this review. Our server was Cory (hope I spelled that right) and he was amazing. While everyone else enjoyed meat and dairy based appetizers, he surprised me with a delicious salad so I wouldn't feel left out. He suggested having pasta because their pasta is not made with eggs, and whatever the cooks made for me was not even on the menu but it should be because it was incredible.

3729119,2012-03-12,0,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"This place is crazy expensive, but they serve only the highest quality ingredients here and prepare it with the utmost care. My boyfriend had told me about Carnevino and his exact words were, ""the best beef you will ever eat."" The last time my boyfriend was in Las Vegas, he had come with a bunch of friends for a bachelor party and the best man made a dinner reservation there.

When my boyfriend and I came to Las Vegas for one of his basketball league games, he insisted that he had to take me here. There`s one thing on the menu that`s meant for two people. It`s the Dry Aged Bone-In Rib Eye that comes with your choice of two sides. Don`t let the price scare you. Yes, it`s $144, but it`s worth every penny, especially if you`re already willing to spend a ton of money in Las Vegas.

The beef has been dry aged for two months, which means that the flavor of the meat intensifies the longer it sits, resulting in the most delicious, flavorful, and succulent piece of meat. The sides we got were Roasted Shitakes Aceto Balsamico, and Mascarpone & Guanciale Mashed Potatoes. When the beef and sides come out, everything is presented table side. The beef is carved for you and the server puts virgin olive oil and sprinkles some sea salt on top. After he carves your meat, he sets the bone so you can nibble off the little bits of meat still on the bone. You`ll look like Fred Flinstone gnawing on that huge bone. The sides are both served in small skillets so they stay hot as you are enjoying your meat. The mushrooms were alright, but the mashed potatoes were excellent. Creamy mashed potatoes with mascarpone cheese and chives mixed in topped with a raw egg. Your server will break the yolk and mix it into the hot mashed potatoes. So rich and absolutely delicious.

The meat definitely stands on its own. It doesn`t need anything accompanying it. When you take the first bite, it is unbelievably juicy and tender. The olive oil gives it a richness and the salt just brings out the flavor of its natural juices. Amazing.

Definitely the best beef meal I have ever had.",Pcz-qJb0s037hU5g78Rrrw,1,0,4,kZfNU0xw8hhpcu-RyN97lg

I have no problem paying top dollar for high end food... believe me the restaurants up and down the strip have taken plenty from me for great food! Just wasn't quite seeing value for money here.

Our waiter recommended a grilled octopus appetizer. We're not generally seafood eaters, but thought it would be fun to try something new. It was outstanding, and I highly recommend it. 

We skipped the pasta course and went straight for the 90 day dry aged New York steaks. They were well prepared and gid tasting. I think they may have oversold the aging process. It was certainly a delicious steak, but I feel I've had equally delicious cuts at Ruth's Chris or similar restaurants. The prices here were slightly higher in my view than those types of locales, so I feel like it's more of a premium for the Mario Batali name. Just under $300 for a shared appetizer, two steaks, a shared side, and a glass of wine each. 

Still very good. Mashed potato side was very tasty. I would recommend it,  just be prepared for the cost.",xaiNxJsL5bjjFeeNP_btgA,1,0,4,jkdKtBgUSqnZdZLTr3GR_g
3753521,2017-06-08,1,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"Idk why everybody is downing this place. Its awesome. The reviews don't  reflect the true value of this place. Anyone who spends anytime actually listening to Mario Batali speak or reads his books would know that he is a crazy food nerd which can come off as pretentious if you take it out of context. Thus, his food reflects his nerdy-ness in the best possible way.

We let carnevino be the second stop on our guided Vegas celebrity chef food tour. We ordered two main dishes from here: the octopus and beef cheek ravioli. The octopus was absolutely delicious! It was so tender and flavorful. It's served with Fresno Chile and some pickled veg in the center, also, micro greens on top. There is a salsa Verde drizzled around the plate. All these items really accentuate the flavors of the tender octopus. The beef cheek ravioli was so good. Tender pasta, savory filling, tossed in a Brown butter sauce and shaved Parm over the top. So good! Then they drizzle the ravioli with 25 year aged balsamic tableside. OMG. It was so good. 

One of the best parts of the meal was the really good rosemary bread which they serve with your choice of pork fat or unsalted butter. The bread was warm and delicious alone and just slightly improved by the spreads. 

We ordered the tiramisu to go and that was so good. The best tiramisu I've ever had. Period. 

So, the food is great, ambiance is classic Battali, service was good, all in all a wonderful stop on the tour. Loved it. Would come back ten thousand times for the octopus. 

Note: In Batali style, there are ridiculously expensive dishes on the menu which are probably well worth the $$$$, such as a $76 per PERSON, rib eye steak. I am not the kind of person that would ever pay that kind of price for a steak at a restaurant. I'd rather cook the steak myself to my seasoning and my doneness. I love to cook and so does my husband. That just tells you a little about me so you can recognize my review for it's intentions.",tRIHlMbHe4Hsg-ubVLg8Ow,2,1,5,cS1vZDpBDtdUNOuJ6pqJhw

what i ate:
- bread was ciabatta rolls. came out with rosemary lardo and sweet butter. the ciabatta rolls were yummy and oily. i loved the rosemary lardo, but i was the only one at the table who liked it. tasted like yummy rosemary flavored fat! whats not to like?!
- rib eye for two: omg, perfection! just enough fat to make it tasty, tender and juicy. cooked to perfection. they carved the huge fred flinstone sized steak table side and drizzled our plates with some extra virgin olive oil. the lady at the other table straight up picked up the huge rib bone and actually gnawed on it. shes kind of my hero.
- porcini bearnaise sauce: yummy yummy. rich and deep mushroom flavor. pretty awesome and oh so fatty. 
- bison: PERFECTION. i really loved the bison!!! didnt taste gamey at all! soooooooo tender and perfectly made
- parpadelle: delicious! fresh pasta! wonderful flavors of mushroom
- sauteed brussel sprouts w/pancetta (side): not a fan of brussel sprouts in general so this wasnt the best for me 
- italian broccoli w/house smoked pork (side): good
- spinach w/garlic and hot peppers (side): loved this. the hot peppers gave this a nice kick
- cesare's 'tuscan fries' (side): basically potato wedges with garlic and parm.
- white truffle pasta dish. im sorry, i didnt order it so i wasnt sure what it was called, but it was one of the specials for the day. this was so disappointing. you ate and tried so hard to love it, but there was nothing to love. you think white truffles and you expect to get your socks knocked off, but nothing happened after a bite. it wasnt that the dish was bad, it was nice and buttery and rich, but it wasnt OUTSTANDING. totally not worth the $50 that came with it so we sent it back. 
- cheese plate: not on the menu! but we asked, and our server said they could whip something up. came out with a blue cheese, double cream goat cheese, parm, pecorino, pear slices, and i asked our server to give us some almonds and some crostini.

pros:
- the MEAT! all the meat was cooked to perfection. i cant speak for anything else, but if its a steakhouse, i highly suggest sticking to the meat! if you cant wrangle someone else to share the rib eye with you, go for the bison!
- service: fairly attentive and outrageously polite and sooooooo accommodating! they let us move when we didnt like the first table we were placed. they were so polite when we complained about the white truffle dish and replaced it quickly. there was always quick and attentive refills of all our water and wine glasses. i asked if they had a cheese plate and they said no, but our server said they would whip something up for us. when i asked for almonds to come out with our cheese plate, he was more than happy to bring us some. 

cons:
- the sides were ... unimpressive. they were tasty, but at $9 a pop, i was expecting a bit more. maybe we picked the wrong sides. 
- white truffle pasta dish. my review of it is above.
- empty! on our way to the bathroom i was so surprised to see how EMPTY the restaurant was. i guess with all the high end dining available in vegas, its difficult to compete. 

would i come again? ... maybe. but, i think id prefer trying another place out on my next vegas trip.",JwF4WNVp2mY_HMeroVUOEw,0,0,4,LA8FymUoyt2lWiA0YA04DQ

Unfortunately, my husband and I received neither. We are visiting Vegas for the week for our 33rd wedding anniversary. We had the concierge make dinner reservations for us at Carnevino to have an anniversary dinner. 
We were excited after seeing all the rave reviews. 
When we arrived for our 7:15 reservation we were greeted by a very unwelcoming hostess. My husband told her we had 7:15 reservations. We were told to step to the side. So we did. She then continued to help walk up customers. After waiting we were told to follow a gentleman who seated us. He was very kind and pleasant. 
After being seated the assistant to the waiter  greeted us. He was also very kind. Then our waiter came. He was adequate. We told him this was our first time at Carnevino. He explained the wine choices.  We decided on 2 glasses of Pinot. He explains the the menu etc. He then leaves us and says he will come back for our order. 
He returned later after helping all the other people who came after us to take our order. 
We had a late lunch and decided to only have the main meal. So my husband ordered the ravioli special and I ordered the New York strip cooked medium. I asked for this steak after I saw the gentleman at the table next to us receive his. I wanted it cooked exactly like his. We also had mashed potatoes, carrots and mushrooms as sides. 
Our meal came out quickly. The steak was plopped in front of me and then several minutes later our sides showed up. 
My steak was cooked medium rare not medium. The carrots were not cooked.  
My steak was not sliced for me. 
While waiting for our meal to be served I was able to look around the room. It was busy. I could see what the standard was suppose to be. 
Everyone gets a roll served to them shortly after being seated. We did not. Everything had their food brought out on a rolling cart with a cutting board for the meat. Once at the table the meat is sliced and the carver asks if it is to your satisfaction, then they slice and serve it to you. My meat was plopped in front of me. I had to ask if this was the proper way. I received an apology and they brought the cart out to slice my steak. I think if you are paying 50-150+ dollars for a steak they need to do it right all the way. 
I did not eat my steak, or my carrots. My husband said his ravioli was delicious. 
We shared our experience with manager and he thanked us for the feedback, which means thanks-. We payed our bill and left.

Cocktails and scotch were good - much better than average on the strip.   

The osso buco was rather bland.   I have almost nothing to say about the dish, except that it seemed like a cheaper,  more boring version of the dish I am used to. 

But the ribeye was absolutely unbelievable.   Some of the best quality beef I've ever had, expertly prepared- a good salty crusty maillard on the outside and rare on the inside.

For example, Del Posto has just garnered a coveted 4 stars from the New York Times, an honor which has not been bestowed on an Italian restaurant in more than two decades.  The problem is once you leave the city and head for the outer reaches of the empire.  In Las Vegas, the showing is not nearly as impressive.  Enoteca San Marco was decidedly good, so I have no idea why it was transformed into another Otto.  More discouraging,  B and B Ristorante is only fair and Carnevino is one of the more lackluster steakhouses I have come across.  At higher prices than in New York, this is just unacceptable.

Dinner began with an amuse bouche of gougere that was comprised of three different cheeses.  Strikingly simple, the presentation was helped considerably being ensconced in a cloth napkin.  This was a promising start.

I then had the spago with lamb ragu ($17) as well as the bone-in NY strip steak ($54) with a supplemental porcini bearnaise sauce ($5).  As I did not order a side with my steak, these two separate courses were brought out together.  The spago was passable but certainly disappointing when compared to what might be found at Batali's other restaurants.  The portion size was fine, but the ragu really failed to resonate in any way.  The dish fell flat and, as such, did not merit the price.  The steak fared little better.  I ordered it medium rare which was really only a guideline.  Most of the steak was prepared medium, though near the bone there was a portion that was rare.  With the bone, there can be unevenness in the cooking, so I was okay with that.  I would just like to have had my steak a little less cooked overall.  My server proudly informed me that the steak itself was dry-aged for twice as long as any other steakhouse on the strip ages their steaks.  True, but I wasn't sure if this added much.  The sauce was regrettable though.  I thought it might be served with the steak.  Instead, it was served in a gravy boat on the side.  It looked fairly well rested to the point where it was starting to congeal.  And there were no fresh porcini mushrooms to be found anywhere -- a clear disappointment.  

To drink, the selection of wines by the glass was a bit narrow.  I opted for a robust Italian red at $19 per glass that was less than memorable.  In fact, I wondered to myself if even the bottle costed that much.    

Service was a little scattered with a handful of people handling my table of one through the course of the evening.  My main server was fairly young and very enthusiastic.  While I appreciated his earnest zeal, his presentation was a little over the top at times.  Going so far as to shake my hand at the conclusion of the meal, may have been a bit much.  He believes in the restaurant, so I won't fault him too much.

Overall, I thought every item cost several dollars more than it should, and the quality of the food was inconsistent with what I expect from a Batali restaurant.  It may survive based on the celebrity chef affiliation, but steak connoisseurs will likely be eating elsewhere.

3858716,2010-09-24,0,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"Okay, I am a huge of Mario Batali. He just seems like a fun guy to hang around... So, when the opportunity arose for a chance to go to one of his restaurants, I jumped at it!

Before going, I reserved a table online from the restaurant's website. As far as wait time, I can not comment. When it came to seating, we were not seated a minute before our time... this kind of peeved me a little bit, but not enought to ding the entire experience. They did, however, seat us on time... I was just getting excited and wanted to be seated early. 

On to the food: We ordered off the pre-theater menu. It was $49 each for a three-course meal. The menu offered 2 or 3 items to choose from for each course. Pre-ordering, the chef does bring out little nibblets... that night it was some cheese ball. Very tasty, it was. 

I had ordered the Insalata Romana, Filet Mignon, and vanilla bean gelato. The filet does not come with a side, everything is a la cart... so I ordered a side of Mascarpone & Guanciale Mashed Potatoes. 

The salad was actually stacked kind of like an iceberg wedge, but with slivers of radichio inbetween every couple layers of romaine lettuce. On top, was a large crouton with an anchovy laying on top. The dressing was well balanced, not too salty or oily from the anchovy, nor was the garlic too over-powering. 

The filet (I ordered medium-rare) was cooked perfectly. Cool center, red throughout, and browned exterior with a single set of score lines on top and bottom. It was seasoned nicely and felt well balanced with the salt to meat ratio.

The Mascarpone & Guanciale Mashed Potatoes created a very hearty dish. It came out in a little skillet and was very hot (temp). Let this guy cool down for a bit before attacking it. It did have an egg on top that the waiter mixed into the dish before handing the fork over to me. The dish was very rich and creamy from the mascarpone. The guanciale (italian bacon) was tasty and provided little bacon morsels to find and I ate. It was fun finding those little bits... remember folks, bacon is a major food group!

The gelato felt more crisp than the street vendors. I wouldn't say that it was as creamy as you can get elsewhere, but the flavor was particularly crisp. I enjoyed it.

I know it has floated down the board that you can get lardo for a spread on your ciabatta. Yes, you can. I tried it and was pleasantly surprised at the texture. It was like eating a spoonful of mayonaise and slowly drags down your tongue. It was seasoned with parmesan and rosemary and therefore tasted great. Don't be scared to try it folks!!

I know this is a really long review, but I'm almost done! The finale is the wine selection. For those that followed the TV show ""Master Chef"", Chef Joe (one of the judges) is Mario's partner for this restaurant. He has his own private label of wine called Bastianich (sp??). Try the Bianco Vespa, it was a truly wonderful white-wine blend.

This time I was dinning by myself so I couldn't partake of their uber large portions all by myself.  This time I got their mint rubbed lamb chops and boy was it great!  The double chop looks incredibly intimidating in its size but they grill it with the fat cap on so after cutting most of those away it looks and is more manageable.  Loved the flavor, the char, the tenderness and the flavor (which actually lacked the expected lamb-ness and tasted more like veal).  

The lamb was perfect pairing for my Barolo at first until I took a bite of the English pea dish which was good but had too much lemon zest on it.  I wish the bartender who took my order would have caught that bad pairing and warned me.  Wasted a good glass of Barolo.

3871299,2011-08-06,1,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"Carnevino is a luxurious attempt to sell diners on buying pure hedonism.  All considerations of moderation in portion size, salubrity, and price are discarded.  As such, the experience of dining here promises to be great fun, so long as the restaurant delivers on its bold promises.

Unfortunately, for me, it fell a bit short.

Bread is served with a choice of butter or, scandalously, a lardo spread.  The latter suggestively hints at the hedonism to come -- it's the chef's way of asking you to go ahead and indulge before the real fun begins.  It's a nice touch.

Then there's a black fettuccine with crab.  The salt level rendered it nearly inedible, although the pasta itself was very well made.    

Steak was a porterhouse for two.  It's carved table-side which makes for a nice show.  The meat is finally seasoned and liberally dressed with good olive oil.

This, I must say, is a huge slab of meat.  Just the bone is of Flinstones proportions, and it's returned to the table for some undignified gnawing.

Flavor-wise, I don't think this porterhouse is going to blow anyone away.  The filet side of the steak is quite bland, in spite of the heavily seasoned exterior.  The rest is quite nice, but it's really an extraordinary amount of food and, therefore, one endures the sameness that comes with eating lots of meat in one sitting.  

The ribeye, which I've had here before, is much better.  But that hardly excuses Carnevino.  I never give a restaurant a pass for the diner ""ordering the wrong thing.""  Surely if I only ever ordered foie gras, the very worst restaurants would pass muster more often.  

One-third of the steak was, effectively, flavorless.  As I typically expect a tenderloin to be somewhat less flavorful, I expect the chef to make a better use of the ingredient.

So my overall feeling is that Carnevino makes lofty promises but fails to elevate the basic experience of a steakhouse.  At this price point, I'm hard-pressed to recommend it.  If you do go, stick with the ribeye.",3e-BITbm264Cq4pS_kF8rw,1,0,3,6kcalETnfxthseQH7szeHw

Some of his places are awesome, but he risks becoming sort of a celebrity chef joke.  Carnevino is supposed to be an Italian style steakhouse, so maybe it was our fault that our meal was average because we didn't order any beef.  All signs pointed toward an excellent meal when they started us with a basket of excellent bread - always a good indicator.  We continued to be encouraged through the app course with the gnocchi bolognese.  But when the entrees came out, it got a little off track.  My pork cutlet with brown butter was bland - it could've used some salt and maybe some herbs (sage?).  One of my dining companions noted that her parpadelle looked (and tasted) almost exactly like the gnocchi that started with.  My buddy's saltimboca was excellent though.  The ultimate indicator is that we skipped dessert - our expectations appropriately lowered.

The service is good. The waiter was incredibly gracious and as accommodating as he could be. That's where the two stars come from. But there just isn't that much food for me here & what I did get was not that great!

I paid $105 before gratuity, and this is what I ate
- some weird pickled vegetable amuse bouche (I was told they were not sure if the bread was vegan because they get it from an outside vendor- ummmmmm, find out)
- an arugula salad that was lettuce, horseradish, onion & lemon vineagerette (however you spell it). 
- roasted squash side, which was dry
- very small & plain pasta marinara 
- 2 cocktails- they were out of my first choice. They OK, not great (was excited about having the rum cocktail they were out of)

Dinner for two over Labor Day weekend.

one cocktail
one side dish

we also got two insalata and an additional main dish (seafood pasta) that are not on the Pre Fixe.

...and this came to 225 dollars before the tip.

The food is fantastic in a staid kind of way, and I loved every bite. The only minus I can think of is that the waiter's descriptions of the specials were so rapid and long that I couldn't remember the last thing he said. But he was helpful when I asked specific questions.

Like somebody said here, eat in the main room, not across the hallway. Ceilings are about 20 feet hight, curtains filter the evening light nicely.

Food:

Tagliatelle with Porcini Trifolati: Sauce was decent, pasta was overcooked. In a restaurant that's owned by these 2? Weird.

Grilled Sweetbreads: Saved this place from getting 1 star. This dish was awesome. If you find yourself here and you like sweetbreads I'd highly recommend them. 

16 oz New York Strip:  Four people at our table ordered it medium rare and they all came cooked a different way. Truly surprising and really unacceptable.

We started with some cheese puffs and then we were each given a nice roll.  With the roll came to spreads, lardo and butter.  The lardo was superb!  Fatty, salty, and just the right accompaniment to a tasty roll.

Seven appetizers were next up served family style.  The items were grilled octopus with pickled vegetables and limoncello; carne cruda--their made to order chopped steak tartare; pastrami slices with two fried eggs and some greens; stracciatella; two wood platters of cured meats--one with mortadella, salumi, coppa, lomo, and nduja and one with prosciutto; and a dish of peppers, some stuffed with cheese.  With the appetizers, we got some sliced, toasted bread and some more lardo.  There were also more rolls brought to each person.

Next up we had two pastas--beef cheek ravioli topped with sliced white truffles and gnocchi with fresh cut figs.  

Next was the reason we were there--meat, in particular, their Riserva, a dry aged meat done in a way no other restaurant is.  Our two inch slice of Riserva was aged 254 days.  We also got a veal chop and a ribeye that was 100 day aged.  After showing all three meats on the table, they were cut table side and then placed back on the table.  With these meats, we had five vegetable dishes--mashed potatoes with an egg that was mixed into the potatoes at the table to make them creamier and tastier; Brussels sprouts, eggplant parmigiana, saut√©ed spinach, and thick cut garlic fries.

The meal ended with four desserts.  We had some cheesecake, panna cotta, a chocolate, peanut butter torte, and semifreddo.

The star of the evening was the Riserva.  The flavor is hard to describe.  There's a small bleu cheese flavor but the flavor comes from the oils from the fat that are in the meat.  We were warned to eat some of the ribeye first and then move on to the Riserva.  The difference was remarkable.  The appetizers and sides were good.  The vegetables should have been hotter.  Perhaps they were waiting too long while the meat was cut.

Service was outstanding.  Our waiter, Shepard, was on top of everything and he had a great personality that made dinner a little more special.

All in all, a special evening with some friends enjoying some good meat.  A return visit sometime is a must.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,11,9,5,ah_3_Sn2PMXQ8bfGysvXjw
3971854,2014-03-01,0,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"Bottom line: The food was not very good and for the high prices it should have been delicious. ($41 for salmon without sides / $63 for lamb.). My advice order a steak. It will at least be good (reported the fourth guest at out table who had the filet.)

Some staffers were awesome, not our table staff who were not accommodating and seemed put out by requests.

I had the salmon which was undercooked in the middle by a lot. I like sushi, but not combined with cooked salmon. A guest at our table had the lamb which was extremely fatty. We were warned by the waiter in a thick accent which was hard to understand because the music was so loud (I like loud music, but this was so loud I couldn't hear the person next to me at a near shout) When we asked them to turn it down, the look from the support staff at the table was poisonous.

I asked for a large glass of water instead of the small table glass. The table ""assistant"", for lack of better terminology, informed me there were not larger glasses. I asked her then to please not let my glass sit empty. It did. She came over many times to fill the sparkling water ordered by another at our table but let mine go unfilled until I asked. It had been a long day at an expo without much water and it would have been a kindness to have a larger or filled glass. I should have ordered fancy water and maybe I'd have had better service.

Ultimately I had to apologize to my boss for picking the place because he was not happy with the selections, quality, or service. It was a disappointing experience. Because of it, I didn't visit the sister restaurant for burgers the next day (which I was looking forward to trying.)",x5sY4OsuR9l93hQ3xR4pIA,3,0,2,CG1eMtcoA6AqD0CqgcrfDQ

Mario Batali, sir, you are an amazing amazing man. 

Went for a friend's birthday. Upon looking at the menu, I was struck that the food only took up one page while the wine list took up about 10. My kind of place. We were talked into ordering the $72 a person cut of dry aged rib eye. Also we ordered the lamb ragu, plate of jamon iberico (¬°Viva Espa√±a!), cauliflower au gratin and potatoes. 

Our meal started with the amazing rosemary scented rolls served with butter and bag fat. Mmmm bag fat. The lamb ragu consisted of handmade pasta and was delightful. 

Now for the steak. OH MY WORD. MAMMA MIA! Apparently, it's been voted best steak in the nation. I was skeptical but man oh man was it amazing. Tender, melt in your mouth awesomeness. The sides were pretty good but it was definitely all about the dry aged bone in rib eye. 

It was hard to believe we even had room for dessert but we split the tiramisu. Yum yum. 

When looking at the menu, I felt the prices were steep for pasta and steak but it was definitely worth every penny. The staff were awesome especially our server Helen.",lg5f5JPxo6AjHz-EvW1hVQ,0,1,5,7SfrZJZLvJM-OvQGN5mtsw

We really wanted some steak and stopped by Cut(?) first however their wait was 45 minutes. We called the concierge to see what our other options were for steak with a shorter wait time and she recommended Carnevino. So off we went.

The restaurant itself is located away from restaurant row and through the casino in the Palazzo. It had a nice ambiance, dim lighting and quite intimate with racks of their great wine selection on the walls. We grabbed a couple drinks while waiting to be seated and I got a Moscow mule which was ok.

Once seated we ordered the Fried Calamari which was pretty good. They brought out bread with two sides of butter and pork fat which they recommended mixing together before spreading it on the bread and oh my GOD it was delish. I mean pork fat and butter? C'mon. They also gave us complimentary mini bread rolls with cheese inside and it pretty much tasted like a crispy cheese ball which is amazing.

A colleague and I ordered the Dry Aged Bone-In Ribeye which has the option on menu to split between two for $72 each. We were unsure until our waiter told us this particular dish was in the running for the best steak in the country. So we pretty much were validated in our reasoning for getting it lol. Another colleague got the New York Strip. We also got the Charred Brussels Sprouts and the Saut√©ed Mushrooms. 

The waiters (yes, more than one) came and rolled out a table with the Bone-in Ribeye and holy mother of god was this thing huge. I mean I'm all of 5'1 and it could've knocked me out. They cut the entire dish in front of us and served it neatly sliced on our plates and then placed the bone in the middle of the table. Ok time for the big taste...simply put it was the best steak I've ever had in my life. I mean perfectly seasoned and moist and melt in your mouth goodness. After getting over the massive bone just chillin on the table I savored every bite. The Brussels sprouts were pretty good but I thought the mushrooms were very good. 

In addition I have to say what really gave my review the full five stars was the exceptional service. Working in a field that pretty much values service I mean they were very at tentative. They took the time to explain everything to us, make sure we were comfortable, and checked on us regularly - even making sure to fold our napkins of we went to the bathroom. 

I had a really great experience here. Good food, good company, good service. I left full and satisfied and honestly I would recommend this place if you are looking for a really great steak that you definitely don't mind splurging on.",JAwFF3v0X8BbaZlxe3uNfg,3,1,5,X8VOd6dzNlAp5mqnrN61EQ

The steak we got was full of fat and unimpressive for 150 dollars and the gnocchi we got was one of the worst dishes I have ever had, it tasted like grass. Someone needs to fix this dish or take it off the menu. The burrata was delicious and the by far the best dish we received. But everything else ranged from mediocre to horrible.

3987409,2012-11-05,0,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"I'm giving Carnevino four stars but I really really loved the food and service.  I picked this restaurant over all other steakhouses in Vegas because I wanted to try the Riserva steak, aged 6+ months in Carnevino's own facility in Vegas.  And the Riserva did not disappoint.  It was really interesting to say the least and distinct from your regular dry aged steak.  The meat was so intensely beefy!  It tasted so strong that I would probably not get it as a steak for myself in the future but would share it with others because it's such an experience to try it. 

I also tried the lobster appetizer, the BBL ribeye, the signature mashed potatoes, and beans and everything was excellent.  The olive oil they drizzle on the steak is so fragrant and rich and really compliments the meat which is top quality and so well prepared.  Because the meat is carved table side by the waiter, it gets cold pretty soon after you start eating it but don't worry, it'll still taste fantastic.   

One thing I was not happy about was our seating.  We were seated in the little library section across the way from the main dining room.  The room was small with 10 tables or so, with a view of the prep area and left me with a feeling I was eating on the side of the casino.  Even though we had a reservation, got there with plenty of extra time, and saw empty tables visible in the main dining room, we were told that nothing was available in the main dining room.  I expect better atmosphere than eating on the side of the casino for a great restaurant.  This is why I am taking away 1 star.   The staff were very attentive and did everything to make it a memorable experience however.  Our waiter and sommelier were both very friendly and knowledgeable.

Here is the thing.  I don't say this lightly.  Husband and I generally agreed.  One of the top 5 meals we have eaten in our entire lives and we ate our way through Washington, DC the first 6 years we were together.

Husband has a bucket list of things he wants to do in Vegas.  We have been working through that list.  As a native, I don't really have such a list.  Except for this place.  I saw it on the food network and I have been fantasizing about it ever since.  Husband asked me where I wanted to eat for our 13th wedding anniversary and I immediately thought of this place.

I love a good piece of meat.  Husband, not that interested, but he surprised me.  He offered to get the dry aged bone-in ribeye with me.  At $144 for two people, this is a commitment to a meal.  A commitment that I want to make again and again.

Besides my wine, we started the meal sharing the fried calamari.  Spicy, but good.  The second course was the gnoochi.  Little puffs of heaven.  Husband let me have the last fig.  Oh, the figs.  (Little aside, please don't go there and think you will have pasta while your friends eat meat.  The pasta dishes are app size, not meant for a meal.)

We moved on to our dry aged bone-in ribeye.  Please note that medium well will still get you pink meat and a little chewy in some places.  This was the best meat of my life.  I was having food ""happy place"" in my mouth.  If I had less dignity, I would have picked up the bone and gone after it like a caveman.  It made me sad to leave the bone there, but we were staying the night in a hotel room without a fridge, so I knew I had to walk away from it.

After all of the food, I knew dessert was out of the question.  But as any quality Italian place, I wanted that cup of cappuccino to finish off my meal.  It was as I anticipated, excellent.

I dined with a party of five business associates.  We were shown to our seats and assured that the waiter would be over shortly, but we waited about 30 minutes for him to come over and take our drink orders.  We saw him taking other tables food orders, but I would think priority would be to put drinks in front of the guests.  Who knows.  Regardless once he finally came over with the wine, the experience was excellent.  We put our fate in his hands and let him pick the appetizers, main coarse and sides and don't think any of us could have done a better job on our own.

He brought us out the bone-in strip and porterhouse, then cut it up for individual portions for the table.  The taste was amazing as was his selections for our sides.

A challenge even for all you sluts out there *gobble gobble* We were very fortunate to have the porterhouse edition. WTF seriously? Super rich, intense flavor with a hint of blue cheese note, truffle, and as Rod U. put it best, ""umame.""  However, the filet side of the T-bone was just too much though. I was only able to have a piece.  Most steaks here are aged for 30-60 days, but the Riserva could be aged anywhere from 6-11month!! You'll never taste anything like it.  Chances are it won't be available, but demand it anyways! 

Dry Aged Steaks: As time process two things changed in the meat. Moisture evaporates from the muscle which creates a greater concentration of the beefy flavor.  Secondly, the enzymes break down muscle tissue, and as the result you're left with a more tender beef.  Keep in mind this aging process require lots of space and also time consuming. Not to mention there are significant weight reduction in the beef, therefor not many steak house are offering this approach.  

*tip* If you're lucky to get this off-menu item,  request it not to be sliced up. This way you don't have to rush to eat it as the beef's oily texture turns kind of waxy rather quickly. If you're sharing have them distribute the meat evenly among your friends.  

Not into all that jazziness??  Dry Aged Ribeyes are exquisite in their own rights.  All steaks are rubbed with sea salt, black pepper, and fresh rosemary prior to cooking for a nice thin char. However, the Riserva are cooked with neighboring broilers to prevent from crusting.  Steaks are then cut table side and before serving dressed with a little olive oil and a dash of maldon salt.  

Whatever you choose to get keep in mind that this going to be a heavy meal, so pick your sides and apps accordingly.  In fact skip appetizers and the bread offering with the salted butter and bacon butter all together.  Just go straight for the goods with some sides like the Mascarpone and Guanciale Mashed Potatoes.

1. Beet salad. I love beet salad, and I order it frequently. I think their's was the best beet salad that I ever had. It's simply perfection.

No to be mean, but I've had better short ribs on Delta Airlines. Maybe I just caught them on an off night, but I don't think we'll be going back to give them a second chance.

4064728,2014-04-02,1,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"Probably the most disappointing $500 meal we (a group of 6) have ever had.

1). There were FIVE girls at the hostess station when we approached, and it somehow still took them a while to find our reservation.  They asked my friend whose name it was under to spell out her last name at least 2 or 3 times. Whatever. 

2).  The steaks, which are supposed to be their star offering (CARNEvino) were a let down.  First, they were OVERCOOKED, which is even more atrocious given that the waiter, when we ordered, emphasized that their temperatures are a grade or two cooler than normal.  Both guys who ordered steaks ordered them medium rare, which, according to the waiter, is like a rare at other places. FALSE. Both steaks were on the well side of medium.  Although dry aged, the steaks did didn't have enough flavor to stand on their own, and they weren't seasoned at all.  If you're going to charge $50-$85 per person for a piece of beef, it better be top quality and perfectly cooked. This was neither.  I've had $35 steak in a strip mall in Fresno that was much better (see, Cracked Pepper Bistro). 

3).  The pasta - another disappointment.  Four of us got pasta.  Another girl and I both had the pasta with lamb ragu, one had the frutti di mare, and one got a lobster ravioli.  The lamb ragu was good, but a touch too salty, and definitely NOT $35 quality.  I could probably make something similar at home.  The lobster ravioli- it was so bad that my friend had the rest of us taste it just to experience how bad it was.  It had like 0.01 ounce of stringy, fishy lobster in it and was somehow bland and over-salted at the same time.  The manager was nice enough to take it off our bill.  My friend who had the frutti de mare seemed to love his entree.  Sadly, he was the only one.  

4).  We had a late dinner reservation - 10pm.  Obviously they were not busy.  Somehow the meal still took 3 HOURS.  How? Why? 

Probably the only better-than-meh part of this meal of the steak tar tar that my friend got as an appetizer.  It was delicious.  It was the quality of food one would expect to get while paying these prices. 

In summary, either Mario Batali has never set foot in this restaurant, or he doesn't deserve to be an Iron Chef.",HeJi6YB9z1Q5C9y5puV5yw,6,1,1,Hrddz-Loxk1noSYumocRLQ

I made the reservation, gave my cc over the phone about a week in advance for dinner on a Tuesday night for 4. 
We showed up for our table and they said it would be a bit because they don't have room.  In fact, there were multiple other parties, awaiting for their 8pm reservations and here we stand, waiting past 8:30. 
This is unacceptable.  We made reservations, for 4, more than 6 days in advance and flew to Las Vegas for a special dinner and here we stand.  Hungry, 30 minutes past our confirmed time and the staff did not care.  They weren't even phased by the situation, as if were a normal occurrence.

Dinner with Hubby and my Mom.  I had such HIGH expectations of this place, as I am a long time fan of Babbo, and all things Mario Batali, but I was extremely disappointed.

Like I said before, it was dark and it really gave me a headache.  I can't even remember what starters we had, grilled octopus and something else, nothing spectacular.  I decided against having steak, and got the lamb chops with cumin yogurt.  Hubby had the same, and my Mom opted for chicken cacciatora (which I initially giggled at).  We ordered the butternut squash, cauliflower, and broccoli rabe to split as sides.  Our chops came, and OMG were they HUGE.  I mean, Fred Flinstone huge.  It was aesthetically repulsive, and equally GROSS.  One cut revealed that just about HALF of each of the 3 double chops were pure FAT.  I mean, I can't even say it was just me, because my husband had the same and his were probably worse than mine.  I cut the first one and didn't really mind it yet, and just carved out a few bits of actual meat, and moved onto the next chop, and just couldn't do it.  I could NOT put that garbage in my mouth.  The sides were also bland, broccoli rabe, as you know is bitter, needed a little acid, but was probably the best side of the bunch we tried.  My mom enjoyed her chicken (it was a human-sized portion), and had no complaints other than the bland sides.

I enjoy larger portions from time to time, but this place was too much.  If you would like to eat like a high end caveman, Carnevino is for you.  Craft and Jean Georges Steakhouse remain my LV steakhouse favorites.

The best thing about this place was the wine list and the service.

The dressing did have anchovies but it was delicate, cheesy, light, lemony and wonderful. It came with a fennel/parmesan crostini.  I loved the fennel. I got the dressing on the side.   It was a perfect salad.  For dinner I ordered a bone in aged rib eye for one.  The salad dressing is so good I may put it on my steak. Several years ago I read a review on us beef and this restaurant came up ha having some of the best aged beef in the country.   So no matter what the yelp reviews say, speaking on behalf of the ribeye, simply marvelous.  At $90 it is not for the faint of heart.  And then there was the marscapone mashed potatoes.

4092797,2009-08-24,2,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"Had the riserva beef last night -- butchered in December 08'...that's almost 9 months folks...and it was terrific.  But while the food is divine, the thing that we love the most about Carnevino is their service.  Marco is tremendous on the floor.  Victor is singularly the best Sommelier in town.  He's so smart and knows so much about wine that it takes a place like Carnevino to keep him at the top of his game - and it's clear he's having fun.  

I think Italian wines are far more complicated to understand due to the multitude of local grapes that the Italians are so fond of using.  The prices are daunting, but that doesn't guarantee a good wine -- ever.    Victor knows all the hidden gems.  And because he knows Mario's (in this case Chef Shirley's) food so well, he makes those ""one note wonder"" somms around town look like fools.   His wine pairings are thoughtful, inspiring, and spot-on.  

We had enough food last night for 4or more -- surprise -- between what we ordered and what the chef sent out, seriously, it was borderline silly.  For a somm, it was a pairing nightmare.  But he paired a lovely white with honey and rosemary nuances that worked with the foie, the pastas, the fish, the charcuterie, the spicy shrimp...When we moved to beef (and oh how we moved to beef...!!) his Il Falcone packed loads of southern charm -- but finesse that surpassed any wine I've ever had from Puglia -- and from a lot of points north, as well  -- was fantastic.  Orgasmic really.  

By the time the five desserts came out, one with birthday candle, we really were too full to do more than pray for a wheelbarrow to get us out safely.  But somehow we soldiered through...to discover they even have lovely dessert beverages - we had a mint infused bourbon that paired with that chocolate w/ candle, the chocolate-mint ice cream, as well as the...somehow after this everything is blank...food coma must have set in at this point...

It was a flawless evening -- to all of the Carnevino team, thank you for making a chef's birthday dinner one for the memory books.",-Fy91nyOFqPv9M_MaZ4W2g,3,3,5,mt6pdqJ3IevuotcKtoU6Qg

Had the bone-in 90 day dry aged ribeye and filet.  Ribeye was as advertised.  Super flavorful.  Really do not need any of their many special sauces as it really takes away the meaty flavor of the steak. I guess you can try the red wine reduction sauce as it goes well but half of the steak should be by itself and half with sauces.  Best part of the steak? meat in the fat cap.  You can ask the server where that is.  

Pretty much where it all ends since the appetizers and sides are subpar.  Fried calamari was not crispy.  Grill octopus was great but only 3 pieces at a party of 4 table (not well thought out since paying a lot for the app and the meal).  Best side was the cauliflower. The chef custom made kids menu style pasta had to be sent back twice and later cancelled since it was way to al dente for kids to eat.

We were so looking forward to this event.  

We checked into the hotel the day of the event and picked up our tickets.  Arrived at the event early and about 10 minutes before the event we were told by Mr Paulo Duran (manager of B & B Ristorante) the Mario had a family emergency 2 days prior and would not be at the event.  Nor would Michael Symon or Paul Kahan be there.  Mr Duran said an email was sent out two days prior which we did not get.

So to make this short, we received for our $380 each, no Mario or two other chefs, beef check raviolis, beef brisket and shank.  What a huge disappointment!!! Only to be followed by the article of what really happened, Mario's sexual allegations hit the streets yesterday.

4138030,2010-03-15,0,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"I've been here on three separate occasions and every time I come here, it seems to get better and better. The way I seem to think of this place is that its simply prepared food but done right. Its probably not the most accurate description but by this I mean that its not too many different flavors or seasoning added to food yet its simple ingredients such as salt and pepper used to draw out the natural flavors of the steaks and other meals. 
The wine list is pretty decent and the sommelier seems pretty knowledgeable. The last time we were here the sommelier recommended a bottle of French Cru for us, something us loyal Napa Valley wine drinkers would rarely do. We liked it a lot though so we'd have to say he made a good choice. Good overall service here as well. We've never had to wait too long for anything and always feel pretty well taken care of here. 
One of my absolute favorite dishes I've had here and had anywhere in recent memory is the steak carpaccio. To be honest, I'm not exactly sure what it is, perhaps some type of raw meat so maybe its better I don't know. But all I know is it was really good! I'd definitely recommend it. 
I almost always order filet mignon at steakhouses and Carnevino is no exception. I get medium, no blood, probably more overcooked than a true meat eater prefers but I think the steak is perfect here. Not over seasoned, just done right. A definite must is their mashed potatoes for the side dish. I'm not sure of the name of it but its the potato dish where they add an egg to it at your table. It's probably raised my cholesterol level but it's worth it! 
The only weak point I've noticed about this restaurant is the desserts. However, I'm usually pretty full by the dessert anyway so it doesn't bother me too much but it is a bit of a let down. I specifically remember the panna cotta and some sort of date cake and both were merely okay and paled in comparison to the rest of the meal. The desserts are a little too bland for me.

Carnevino ended up being one of the more expensive meals which I understand Vegas, together with good food and good wine comes with a price but in this case the price did not match the experience! 

This was our third time at Carnevino and though I was looking forward to this the most , it ended up being the worst of my three times here

We began with drinks, my husband had a beer and I went with the Sommelier recommendation and ended up with a truly fabulous wine! The decor wasbeautiful , the service attentive though devoid of any personalization  and the music, through perhaps odd to many given the formal setting, was great - Soundgarden!

Food however was not so spectacular ! The Oysters we began with were good but were surpassed by those at Table 10, Morels, Bouchon and even Public House.  My husband had a four course tasting menu beginning with the Steak Tartare , followed by a pasta, aged steak and finally Tiramisu . He enjoyed it but noted that it heavily rubbed distracting from the meat and certainly not the winner on this trip! 

I has the lobster; a joke!! Smal, over cooked and rubbery - served on its own, no butter, no taste ! Charge me more and make it good : this was not good! 

Sides were not as good as previous visits ; the spinach which we had enjoyed in the past was left as it was slightly salty! The potatoes on the other hand bland .

The tiramisu was like many others in Vegas: deconstructed to put in a glass with gelato taking the place of the traditional coffee soaked lady fingers! Personally I like standard tiramisu; the hit of cocoa being better than these cocoa nibs! If ended up being left! 

The biggest problem for me was the service - it was smooth, well executed but almost robotic! A little personality can turn a good meal into a great meal .

I had a Manhattan which was perfectly sweet up front with a manly kickback. 
Table bread is a rosemary ciabatta served with seasoned lard which I have never had before and I almost sucked down the entire little pot of it. 
Bison carpaccio was goddamn astounding, albeit a bit too small for two to share, but could be fine for just one. 
Of course the filet side of the porterhouse is a lot softer than the strip side, it's good to eat the strip side first and finish with the filet. 
They leave the bone at the table for you if you're so inclined to scrape down that really soft, red goodness... 
OH, and the potatoes? With ricotta and the poached egg? I could have drank it like a milkshake.

We had to share:
- Fruiti di Mare Spaghetti ($31) - your basic sea food red sauce pasta. nice inclusions were the lobster bites.
- PAPPARDELLE with 'porcini trifolati' ($22 for the ""appetizer portion"", $37 for the dinner portion) - this was good but i've had just as good for less than the appetizer price.

Here's the doosie:
-Bone in Ribeye for 2 - WATCH OUT FOR THE PRICE - they list it as $72 but it is really $72 x 2 = $144 for ONE large ribeye steak
- Porterhouse for 2 - again same tricky pricing wording - they list as $80 but it is really $80 x 2 = $160 for ONE large porterhouse.

I'll be honest, I've had ribeye and porterhouse steaks and they tasted as good but NO steak should cost $160 unless it is encased in gold. Seriously, this was ridiculous

I don't even want to bother telling you about the sides and dessert we ordered because in the end, the outrageousness of the steak prices boggles my mind.

Afterwards we were served with our entrees - most of us had steaks(wonderfully flavored and perfectly cooked). I also tried sweetbreads for the first time - quite good!

The waiter said that the chefs who created the menu recommend that you share a course of pasta and split the rib eye or porterhouse and sides. The price is a bit confusing. $85 per person. Recommend 2 people to eat it. I think they should have listed the price as $170 and put under there that it's enough for 2 people to eat. When I'm hungry, that's. it the best time for me to do mental math. Also Carnevino charges you for steak sauce at $5 a pop. 

I was informed that they do like to cook their meat on the rare side. I ordered my filet mignon butterflied and well done. And when I got it it was light pink inside which was perfect and exactly what I wanted. The flavors cold be better. They cook their meat in a 1500 degree oven so the food comes out really fast. They ny strip, porterhouse, and the rib eye are dry marinated For 90 days. The filet mignon was wet marinated for 30 days. 

The staff here are very attentive. I noticed that when my friends would go to the bathroom, they would quickly come and retold her napkin and replace it on the table. They are quick. 

When you order the ribeye or porterhouse, they will bring it to your table with a carving table and cut it right at your table probably Bc your are paying $170 for a slab of meat. The sides are $13-15 each. I would not come back here. I didn't think the filet tasted special in any way although I will say that it was cooked exactly how I wanted it to.

The space and energy was all wrong. It felt claustrophobic - like sitting in someone's hallway as all the servers walked back and forth, and the lights were right above us. I feel bad for the servers who are assigned this area. It's as if they were trying to fill up space. Bo also agreed so I requested seating in the front dining room where we immediately felt much more positive ambience. From there, we were able to enjoy our evening over a great bottle of wine, ossobucco and veal chop, plus dessert.

The low lights: the grilled shrimp? So over cooked - way to dry to eat and believe it or not the foie on crostini... Simply because it wasn't a crostini at all, just a cold piece of Italian bread, not crunchy, still soft.
You couldn't cut through it. 
And again everything else was just ok, . Nothing to write home about.

We booked a party of 19 people for a birthday party. We had a good time. My favorite is the dry aged rib eye for 2! It's delicious! Service was great! Ambiance is nice. Great place for a romantic dinner date!

One thing to note about this place is their ""medium"" cooked steak is more like medium-rare. And don't send it back to be cooked again because the steak just comes back well-done.",gfm6b8-Dd6CIKRKnGBvf8A,0,0,5,w_2LQNn2iMHrcpm4c9Zecg

I had the arugula salad which was served with two large wedges of goat cheese -- it was sooo good and I enjoyed my salad much more than those at the table who had the chopped salad or romaine salad.  The steaks served for two provided way too much meat for the two couples who ordered them but everyone agreed that they were well prepared.  The wine list is HUGE and the martinis were tasty.

Service was excellent--in fact, one of few places where I've been quite happy with the service.

Of course, going on 5:30, even on a holiday, meant the place was not at full capacity. 

Really, the only complaint I have is that I feel like it's a tad overpriced for an overpriced restaurant. The steak comes with just the steak--nothing else. Same with everything else.

The empty restaurant should've been the first clue- but then again, who the hell eats a big ass steak for lunch? WE DO! Apparently (-_-)

After the rude-ass hostess out in front sat us down, we were curious to try out this highly touted ""BBL"" beef, so we all ordered the 16 oz bone-in new yeezy. Disappointing for $61 duckets. Good size, good cut, looked good but I expected a little more as far as flavoring. I ordered medium rare but that shit was literally still mooing when I got it.  After taking a few bites I noticed that subtle dry aged beef flavor - hard to describe, it sorta had that rotten cheese kinda taste towards the end. I'm not that hardcore of a steak connoisseur to know if it was supposed to taste like that or if that's a good thing or not, but all I know is that I didn't particularly favor it.

We also ordered the Italian Broccoli with smoked pork at the recommendation of our server- that was actually pretty good. I'm not sure if I'd shell out the kind of duckets to come back here again. For that kinda money I'd much rather go to a sure win like R. Chris or Mortons. (-_-)",0JJrchH24gp_6Mobc-pFgQ,3,1,3,M4yWo1RcvAJwLqwqWjf5Jg

4339275,2009-12-28,0,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"We were here for Christmas Eve.  I wish I remembered the name of our waiter, as I really enjoyed him, but unfortunately I forget his name.  We each did the prix fix meal at $49 a person that included a salad, 8 oz filet mignon, and dessert.  We then added in two pasta dishes and their version of steak frites.  We had a $108 bottle of wine and I had a cocktail.  Grand total = $300.  Not too bad as it was a lot of food and very tasty.  

Aside from the steaks and salad, we tried the black fettucini which was awesome - odd combo (black pasta, jalapeno's, crab, caramelized shallots) and a special lobster ravioli.  The lobster ravioli's were good but not my favorite - I just would not try them again and out of everything we had that night I liked them the least.  The steak frites were amazing.  I know, I know.... just potatoes but really garlicky and salty.... mmmm.  Dessert was caramel gelato for me - which was not too sweet and a nice way to end the meal.  The boyfriend had the apple sorbet.

I think some of the complaints about this restaurant taking too long are from people that don't go to ""nice"" restaurants very often.  Anytime you go to a fancier restaurant, expect your dinner to last about 2 hours.

Only thing we decided we weren't that enthusiastic about was the fact this place was so close to the casino floor.  Didn't really like eating my meal with the sound of slot machines in the background or watching over the casino floor.",Wu0bfCVa_SsMuhbemAuaIA,0,0,5,h233doyh36sI-8WHTann1Q

4343114,2010-01-01,0,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"Warning: If you want to be able to eat here and live with yourself, you'll have to dumb yourself down a bit and pretend you don't understand the word ""lardo"" when you read it on the menu. Are you ready? Good.

That said . . . Helloooooo, beef carpaccio with ""warm lardo crostini."" LOVED that this was one of the pre-theater menu antipasti offerings. So delicious. 

I have to admit, I was less slightly less charmed by my main course -- the pappardelle with porcini, served with a fresh grating of parmesano-reggiano (chef's suggestion) -- than I was with the first. It's hard to follow a tender meat-and-lardo pairing with truffles and pasta, no matter how perfectly al dente that pasta may be. 

It is even more difficult -- if not impossible -- to then be delighted by a simple gelato/sorbet. The texture doesn't follow, the flavor doesn't quite match; nothing is really right about the arrangement.

So I left with mixed feelings about Carnevino. On the one hand, my departing taste was that of bland, ""espresso""-flavored gelato (flavor not really recommended). On the other hand, it's nearly a week later, and I still drool every time I think about the carpaccio or the delightful tuscan fries my husband had with his filet.

4350734,2015-09-22,1,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"My wife and I visited Vegas for a short weekend which meant we had to be selective about where to eat. We heard about Carnevino and given the celebrity chefs involved and decent reviews we decided to give it a shot. 

Upon arrival we were promptly seated. The menus are ridiculously oversized, nearly 2 feet tall, and 3 of the 4 pages are bottled wine. The menu is so large it's awkward to hold. More on the menu later. Our young waiter was eager to help but slightly arrogant and trained to push you toward the more expensive options. He left us to review the menu. 

Their specials are listed on a smaller menu which consists of a multi meat tasting, I think it was 5 varieties, and a dessert. No sides or salads included. Of the 5 courses one had pasta. Given that both celebrity chefs are Italian we definitely wanted to try some pasta. The tasting is $150 per person while the matching wine pairing is $80 per person. Add a couple sides and you are over $500 for a couple, which is fine, but the food and service better be top notch for there to be any value. 

After considering the tasting we decided against it mainly because we wanted more variety and thought selecting exactly what we wanted provided a better value. From the antipasta section we choose the grilled octopus and the beat salad. 

We really struggled with choosing entrees and here is were the menu really became a hindrance and frustration. Remember the menu is sized for a giant at nearly 2ft tall so holding it and talking with others at your table is a challenge. The entrees are broken down into pasta, veal, lamb, fish and red meat. The meat section which is what they are known for is in the middle and has 5 or 6 options. The signature steaks are the dry aged bone in ribeye and the porterhouse. The waiter made sure to point out the dry aged ribeye and explained the steaks are ""hand carved"" table side. Sounds simple enough. The trouble began when the pricing for both of these meats were listed as, $76 for the ribeye and $170 for the porterhouse, except thats the price for each person. Since we really wanted to try the pasta this left us with a dilemma. We asked the waiter for assistance and he explained they could serve the ribeye for one for $95 but that the porterhouse was only served for 2. We asked for more time to decide. I love steak like anyone but $95 for a ribeye, even dry aged, seemed pricey. I asked the waiter how many oz. but he did not know and the menu does not specify sizes anywhere. Ultimately we choose the ribeye for one and the beef cheek ravioli which the waiter highly recommended. 

The bread arrived along with the butter and pork fat. The butter was excellent but I didn't care for the overly salty flavor of the fat. The appetizers arrived quickly and we really enjoyed both the octopus and the beats. If I'm being picky the octopus was slightly over cooked but we ate every piece.

While waiting for the entrees to arrive we asked the waiter for wine recommendations with our entrees. He immediately recommended a glass of Italian red wine without much hesitation. We are not wine experts and neither of us were familiar with the grape variety. We asked for a taste and he kindly brought a sample. The wine was not full bodied as he described although it was peppery and spicy. My wife liked it and ordered a glass while I asked for something with more body, more tannins, like a cab. He brought a glass of a cab which worked out much better. Given the importance of wine, 3 pages full on the menu, I was not impressed with the waiters knowledge. 

The entrees took about the amount of time you would expect. The steak was rolled to the table on a cart for carving. One disappointment was they never once asked if the steak was cooked to our liking. We ordered the ribeye medium but received medium rare, red throughout. I don't mind a rare steak, I order a filet rare but I prefer a ribeye cooked medium to allow the fat to loosen up more. Since they already carved it and placed it on the table we choose to let it go rather than complain and delay the meal. If you've ever eaten at an Eddie V's the ribeye will remind you of their Tomahawk bone in ribeye. The steak was good and had a unique flavor perhaps due to the dry age but I was not blown away. The value just wasn't there. If you are going to set my expectations with a lofty price then you better bring your A game. My wife enjoyed the beef cheek ravioli but I thought it was awful. The pasta was good but the beef cheek filling had the texture of baby food and the flavor wasn't much better. I'm a texture guy so your mileage may vary. 

Long story short, high price, poor/average experience means no value. I recommend you look elsewhere in Vegas. I debated between 2 or 3 stars but after thinking through our meal again I left it at a 2. Harsh but fair given the expectations they set.",GKjc3V-tqUKxN0UTyChLIQ,3,1,2,1g2uVE2r1OkvTT6ZdkhnKQ

First off, the meal was so expensive.  We were dining with a group who all love good food and don't mind paying a lot for really amazing meals, but this wasn't worth half of what we paid.  

The service was so bad and they sat our group of 6 at a giant round table that was so large you could only speak to the people directly to your left or right, not conducive to good conversation.  Our server was pretentious and frankly had the personality of a rock. 

My husband and I started with Proscuitto with seasonal fruit as an Antipasti, we shared the Gnocchi Bolognese as a pasta course, we had the roasted beets as a side, and I had an 8 ounce filet mignon ($50) and he ordered the 20 ounce bone-in veal chop ($85).  

The proscuitto was delicious, melt in your mouth, just salty enough, it was really wonderful.  The pasta was disappointing.  At our table we had several different pasta dishes, and every single one of them was a let down.  Gnocchi was a little too chewy and the bolognese sauce was just... meh.  Nothing special.

My steak was very good, it was really tender, but I have had (much) better steaks at other steakhouses, paying less, and often the steaks elsewhere are accompanied with something (sides, garnish, something!).  My husband's veal also was good, it was tender and had nice flavor.  Again, for me, it's more about the price.  That veal chop was not worth $85.

We got the roasted beets as a side, and I enjoyed them, but I love beets.  Other side dishes at the table went untouched.

The other dishes ordered at the table included a veal scaloppine and lamb chops, and the general concensus was that the food was unmemorable and nothing special at all. 

I think that if we had paid less for our meals or if we had really exceptional service, we likely would have left Carnevino feeling better about the experience.  But when you combine mediocre food, terrible service, a poor table setting, and a sky-high bill, the overall opinion was that this was a bad dining experience.

Yesterday, we went to Carnevino in the Palazzo.  The food this time was beyond spectacular, and the service was among the best I've received in a high end restaurant.

I've found the Foodtv guy likes to give freebies to diners before they order as if they are ""gifts"" from the chef.  You know what? They ARE gifts!  Very tasty ones at that.  I didn't care that the deep fried regianno cheesy poof was bait to get me to order more food pre-order.  It was amazing in flavor! Many thanks!

The waiter clued me into a mistake I had made in ordering.  He fixed the problem and gave me more variety without impacting the bill. Nice guy.

The waiter's suggestions were perfect.  The carpaccio app was meaty with a strong salty vinegrette dressing for the bed of arugula. The strip was perfect.  The best steak I've ever had.  I didn't pick it up and scrape the bone with my teeth, but my knife worked overtime on carving the bone clean.

4370730,2009-03-23,1,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"First, it's odd to have two dining areas separated by an open hallway in the casino.  We got our reservations the same day, so I can understand our table being in the ghetto section of the restaurant.  The staff was friendly, but not that knowlegable of the food. Nobody in my group knew where osso buco was on the veal and neither did the waiter.  The busboy told us the answer.  Their menu is confusing in respect that half of the steaks are meant to be served for 2 people.  I couldn't get a porterhouse for myself unless I'm willing to spend $140.  I thought the steak was $70, but it was $70 per person.  My mistake for not reading the fine print. The aged beef wasn't all that great. Way too much salt on the exterior had me eating the beef and leaving the exterior on the plate.  The Osso Buco was a bit dry, but never having it before leaves no way to compare it.  The marrow was almost overlooked until we saw the small fork and figured it out.  The marrow was the best part.  It might be the case we didn't eat it correctly. Maybe the marrow was supposed to be spooned out and blended with the meat?  I don't know. We tried some appetizers and pasta appetizers. Nothing stood out like the pork tenderloin at Mesa Grill.

4382438,2016-03-13,1,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"We dined here this weekend with friends visiting from out of town. They were staying at The Venetian so we wanted to pick something convenient for them. The Venetian has a lot of options so we had a hard time choosing. Carnevino was our pick because it's slightly upscale giving a Vegas dining experience and they offer a nice mix of meat and Italian dishes. 

The hostess was friendly and accommodating. We were led to a small dining area across the hall and seated. There were only about 10 tables and a beautiful wall of wines. The room was very cozy. 

Our waiter was very informative. He obviously takes great pride in the food and wine selection here. He gave us plenty of details about the best dishes on the menu before we ordered. He even told us details about the egg on one of the dishes. Apparently the special chicken is fed a special diet which makes for a very yellow yolk. I admit that I was holding back the laughter when he said this. I recently finished up Portlandia on Netflix and the details about the chicken were uncanny to a scene in that show.

Soon after being seated we were served small rolls with cheese filling. It was very delicious and rich. Later rosemary bread was brought out with two types of butter. This bread was well seasoned and flaky. We also had cocktails that were nicely prepared and the presentation was impressive. The table shared a Caprese while we looked over the menu. The mozzarella was obviously made in house and had amazing flavor and texture. The creamy homemade pesto on the plate was very good as well. I love a good pesto.

I had the Agnolini (lobster ravioli). The pasta was very tender and flavorful. I enjoyed the flavor. The waiter warned that this would be a small portion which was fine because I wasn't overly hungry. I'm not sure this dish was worth the cost though. I typically choose meat when dining out and I wish had gone with my usual meat dish.

My husband had the Saltimbocca which he is still talking about. I sampled it and agreed that it was delicious. Our friends had the Gnocchi and the off menu Beef Cheek dish. The Beef Cheek dish was also raved about.

For dessert I had the Zuccotto which is not an overly sweet dessert. I liked the presentation and other flavors on the plate, but it would not rank as one of the best desserts I've ever had. My cappuccino was delicious and a highlight. My husband had the Lime Cheesecake and thought it was okay.

If you are looking for a nice Vegas dining experience with good food this spot will be just that. I do recommend overlooking the pasta section and ordering meats. Clearly, the meat dishes are the stand out menu items.",3nIuSCZk5f_2WWYMLN7h3w,3,3,4,on0kKrGpO29j8QexgLXzRw

Knowing that the three of us would be heading over to a club for some drunk-man's hokey-pokey within a few hours, we took the server's advice and split the two-person bone-in rib-eye, three ways.  Of course you can't have dinner without an appetizer.  

Our taste-buds tingled at the sound of the featured bruschetta: soft and creamy mozarella nestled on a bed of kale, with some playful specs of pancetta hiding in between the wrinkly leaves.

The mozzarella was so creamy - tangled between the grooves of our forks, then twirled with a little piece of kale, picking up some pancetta bits, eventually finding its way onto a rough patch of bruschetta. LOVELY. 

Mid conversation, our server appeared table-side with a wooden chopping block on wheels!  He prepared us - ""Excuse me,"" he says kindly. ""If I may shuffle some things around here...""  THEN the monstrosity of a rib-eye appeared from underneath the little table!  For that type of entrance, they should have blared the trumpets and sounded the cymbals.  The server gently carved the steak, artfully plated it, and so delicately sprinkled some salt and drizzled some olive oil over the medium-rare slices of meat.  MAGICAL.  At some point, we found ourselves slightly confused by the humongous rib that lay so peacefully across a little plate - what to do?  Nothing else to do but to pick it up and savor the flavors of the bone that oozed into the meat.  Don't question it.  DO IT. 

Green beans came in a little cast-iron tray -  they too were delightful.  Golden raisins and lemon zest all joined the party.  Such a subtle, yet fun combination of flavors bouncing around in the mouth.

4393723,2010-11-08,0,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"I had the pleasure of dining at Carnevino a couple of weeks ago.  They have an extensive menu to choose from including a Beef Tasting Menu but I was there to try the Riserva Steak which luckily they were serving when I went. 

I started with the Foie Gras with shaved truffles.  It was one of the daily specials.  Pricey but oh so good.  For my main course I ordered the Riserva Porterhouse.  Price is by the inch and I ordered 1 1/2 inches.  I don't remember the exact size but it was a decent amount of meat and I would guess it was at least 12 oz.  They carve it for you table side.  For a side dish, I ordered the Italian Broccoli with Smoked Pork.  The steak was good.  It definitely has a funky flavor but not in a bad way.  I don't quite get the Blue Cheese references but it was good none the less.  Given the price I probably wouldn't order it again but it was worth trying at least once.  The Italian Broccoli was good but I thought it that was a bit on the cold side.  For dessert, I had the dark chocolate cake.  It was good but nothing remarkable.

Service was excellent.  The server was quite knowledgeable about the entire menu.  I had to wait about 5 minutes initially to get seated but I also changed my reservation to an earlier time so I let that slide.

Bread guy brought bread and was explaining about the two kinds of butter and left mid-sentence, voice trailing off like a rock down a well.

After 2 server blow-offs they brought my first course. They told me what it was and I whipped out my blackberry and said ""How do you spell that?"" I think from that point forward, they thought I was a food critic because they started tripping all over themselves. It was actually kind of comical. 

I had the beef tasting menu. Highly recommend it. Wagyu beef crudo was good. Beef tasted a little plain and not sure what the coriander, saffron and fennel did to accompany it. Beef cheek ravioli was excellent. Almost as if the beef cheeks were puree'd. Smoky flavor with great pasta ravioli and a cheesy sauce. The ""12 year old"" aceto balsamico was an especially nice touch.
Piemontese beef was excellent. I wish it had two quail eggs instead of one so I could have some with each bite (like the garlic spinach).
Dry aged BBL beef was really good. Looking at the beef, it looked too rare but the juices really explode in your mouth and the bernaise sauce complimented it well. The potato lobster souffle (I guess it was a souffle or a hash b/c when the waitress brought she said it was a ""potato lobster uh...uh"" and I finished her sentence with ""souffle?"") I could do without. One bite and done. 

 The vanilla semifreddo with pistacchio rum strawberries for dessert was just fine. 

All in all I'd say if you're in the mood for beef, this is a very good place (if you can look past the extremely uneven service). They really take their beef seriously. I'm not sure if this makes sense but this is not a steakhouse. It is an italian infused beefhouse. 

And if they think you're a food critic, they take the service seriously. Otherwise, maybe not so much.

As the Palazzo's premiere restaurant that they use to ""comp"" their high-rollers, the service is stellar, and the food is what you'd expect from a high-end steakhouse in a luxury resort hotel.

One of the best values on the Las Vegas Strip is CarneVino's 3-course, 2-cocktail ""Martini Lunch,"" priced at $65 all-in. The tender and taut ""Grilled Octopus with Limoncello"" appetizer can be part of this multi-course meal and is fantastic -- the salty and sweet sauce is sparingly used, giving way to the flavor of the octopus and the accompanying pickled chilies.

For my second course, I've had the 6 ounce Filet Mignon for lunch, seasoned with nothing but salt, and cooked perfectly rare. Despite being CarneVino's sole wet-aged cut, the grill-browned flavor of the beef is wholly acceptable, especially as part of a relatively inexpensive multi-course lunch meal.

The small ""extras"" are perhaps what makes a dining experience at CarneVino special. For example, in-between courses, a warm, damp towel is offered over a fresh slice of lemon and a few sprigs of thyme. The bread comes with ""Lardo"" (whipped fat from cured pork), which is a staple at Batali's restaurants I first memorably experienced at NYC's Del Posto -- and, of course, soon to no longer be available anywhere as initially conceived.

If one can get past assuming guilt for the serious crimes that Mr. Batali is accused of (note that he is accused as of right now, denies committing any criminal acts, and has not been convicted), I recommend CarneVino before it shutters.

4409936,2011-09-29,10,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"We chose Carnevino for our fancy dinner out during a recent bachelorette party. We were happy to find that they were able to accommodate our large group (8 girls) for dinner, but were a little paranoid when they told us they'd charge us $50 for each person that didn't show up. They were also really persistent about checking up on us in the days leading up to the dinner - maybe they have a lot of experience with flakes in Vegas?

Anyway, we were immediately really impressed by the space. It's dim and romantic and very upscale. They put us in a semi-private little nook which I liked because we were still able to see out into the main dining area but still got some privacy. 

I have to say the service here was excellent, though I wasn't so impressed with the food. Our waiter was really helpful in determining how much we should order and making recommendations, though I did get the impression that he was trying to upsell us. If we ordered as much as he suggested we would have been too stuffed to walk after our meal! However, he took it in stride when we ordered only some of what he recommended. 

The meal started with some tiny little complementary cheese croquettes, which were a small bite and very savory and tasty, as well as a bread basket with choice of butter or lardo to spread on top, which I thought was a nice touch. 

To start, we had the grilled octopus and two of their salads. I enjoyed the arugula salad with a triple cream cheese but the other starters were not so memorable. We also went with the ribeye, which was yummy but to be honest nothing special compared to other steakhouses I've been too, both expensive and more affordable. We also weren't super impressed with the pastas we had - a black fettucine with crab, a gnocchi and orrechiette with sausage and broccoli. They were all fine but definitely not memorable (I just had to look up the menu on the website to recall what we ordered!) To be honest, the highlight of the meal was the side of mashed potatoes we ordered, which comes with a poached egg and some sort of bacon type meat. It was so indulgent and rich! But I was a bit disappointed that the mashed potatoes were the highlight of this extravagant meal. 

Though I was totally impressed with the ambiance and service, the food unfortunately didn't measure up for me. With so many wonderful restaurants in Las Vegas, I don't think there's time to waste on mediocre expensive meals!",yh8_9Ix1wp9dekvyOZbilQ,17,17,3,9sMdH5hzYAbgjchfipb5sA

4417629,2014-01-30,0,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"Visited this establishment with my uncle, who frequents Delmonico, but wanted to give this a try.

We arrived about 10 minutes early and were told there was one couple to be seated ahead of  us, but we could have a seat at the bar. There was no seating at the bar, so we ended up standing at the end of it in front of the cocktail station. Maybe that was bad bar etiquette on my part, but still. Considering we were standing right in front of the bartender, we were never even offered a drink or a better place to wait.

I don't have much to say about the food. I ordered the salmon, medium. It was cooked to perfection, but really lacked flavor, and the brussel sprouts were burned and oily. I've had much better at Gordon Ramsey's Pub and Grill at a much lower price. 

After we received our entrees, our waiter was not to be seen again. He did not even return to check on the meal. He only came back to up-sell us on dessert, which also was unimpressive. We ordered the pistachio gelato, which was nothing to write home about. 

Honestly, the best part of my meal was the dry ros√© I had at the beginning and the blood orange tea I had at the end of it. The tea was wonderful, and the young girl that brought it to us (see also was very attentive about our water the entire night), gave us the best service out of everyone.

4419326,2017-02-25,0,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"While we were on a lip smacking foodie tour, the guide recommended we change our existing dinner reservations to Carnevino.  He contacted the restaurant, confirmed our reservations and off we went at dinnertime.  We arrived to find that there had apparently been a  miscommunication and  that we had no dinner reservations. The earliest they could work us in was after 9 PM.   We began to walk away and the hostess caught us as we were leaving and informed our party of 4 that they would try to squeeze us in to an already full house.    They were gracious and apologetic.

They had us wait in the bar area and told us that per the manager, the first round of drinks was on the house. I thought that was a very generous gesture and two in our party ordered Long Island Iced Teas.  My husband and I stayed with our initial waters.   About 20 min later, we informed the waiter that we would just stay in the bar area  and dine (we were starving at this point). but at the same time,  the manager came over to say that they had found a table for us. Granted, it was in a corner and under a very loud speaker (more on the music later.), but it was a table.   Our main waiter, Lee, was excellent and extremely knowledgeable of the menu selections .  We ordered the octopus appetizer which is the closest thing to heaven I have ever tasted. It was grilled perfectly and was accompanied by Fresno chilies and pickled radishes  just from memory but there was more.  I had a  ravioli dish (Mario, if you ever read this, please consider switching out the arugula for capers. The arugula completely overpowered the delicate handmade pasta and accompanying filling).  The other three in our party had filet mignon and they were  perfectly cooked to order. The mashed potatoes accompanied by a poached egg mixed in at the table, was surprisingly underseasoned.  It was simply missing the appropriate amount of salt. (They will bring you your own cute little dish of sea salt if you request.). Our table mates ordered the fingerling potatoes which were a bit underwhelming.   If I had to do it again, I would've went with another side.  We finished out the night with the peanut butter and chocolate torte which was divine.  The waiter came back over to inform us that the manager had comped our dessert as well.  Service was impeccable and as someone who was in the food industry for over a decade, I noticed all of those tiny but important  attentions to detail. Something as simple as every waiter stepping aside as a customer is walking to and from their table is certainly noted. I even stopped and inquired as to whether or not this was part of their training. The employee was adamant that they would be fired if they did not adhere to this rule.  

My main issue with  this restaurant was the choice of music and the volume. It was rowdy and raucous and extremely out of place.  I don't require Beethoven; however,  it was extremely offputting to our overall fine dining experience.  (Again, Mario or Joe, if you're listening.....). 

Again, this was almost a five-star dining experience. Don't go unless you're expecting to spend a minimum of $100 per person and that's being conservative.   This is worth the splurge in my humble opinion.   Every item is a'la carte unless you order from a pre-fixe  menu.

I had 7:30 reservations for two. Arrived two minutes late, but was promptly seated. Good start. Its a beautiful restaurant and I like how they store the wine in the Cabinets all around you.

Our server, JB , came over to introduce himself and the menu. Here is where things start to go South. I mentioned that I had been looking at the menu online in anticipation of what was to be an amazing dinning experience. He still tells us to look it over and proceed to visit every table around us for the next 31 minutes.  He finally comes back, and takes our dinner order and drink order. 15 minutes later the drink arrives. So lets recap: 31 mins to place dinner order when I said I already knew what I wanted, and 46 minutes to get a drink.  

The Salads were the best part of the whole experience. Zach's chopped Salad was very good, if a little heavy on the hominy. The standard 'Caesar'( although they don't call it that) is also very good. 

45 minutes after I get my 1st drink The food arrives, total time in seat ~1.5 hours. 

The steak looked amazing , it was the $150 aged, bone-in Ribeye for two. JB said it was what they are known for. The tableside preparation was nice and it really is a big hunk of meat, but at the very end they ""season"" it by putting two crystals of sea salt on the massive amount of steak and then drown it in olive oil.   

(Side Note: I said Hello and Happy V-Day to another server who was helping JB cut and serve the steak. he rolled his eyes and let out a sigh, to which JB replied "" only a couple more hours man"".... I'm right freaking next to you dude, I have ears! WTF?)

But Back to the steak. It was tasteless, it had no flavor, other than olive oil. The texture was great but there was just nothing to get excited over. I should have just sent it back and ordered something else.   

Instead, I asked for two different sauces, a Gorgonzola and something else. Both just sucked.  The gorgonzola was like a semi-solid cheese paste.

We had also ordered a maine lobster tail, trying to make our own surf-and-turf  for the special occasion.  Of course, JB forgot to enter it into the system so it never arrived. 

I had had just about enough of this Joke of Service being rendered to us and I asked to talk to the General Manager, JB heard something else because the floor supervisor or assistant manager or something came over, I told him I was in the QSR industry and how much the service and food were lacking , he didn't care. The only thing he listened to was when I said I am not trying to get out of paying the bill, then he said okay, picked up my card and rang it. 

I never , ever ask to see management. I guess in my mind I was thinking that if I let him know now, how awful the service and product was, he would take control of the situation, try and rectify it in some way , any way... Yes a discount or removal of stuff from my ticket would have been nice and probably the right thing to do. He did absolutely nothing. So Congrats Dude! I am now an ANTI-Brand Ambassador for Carnevino and I will be sure to tell everyone that I can.

Finally wrapping up dinner, I usually drink more during special occasions and like to finish it off with espresso after a nice dessert, I did neither, I just wanted out of there. I had my $150 dollar steak wrapped up and they brought the claim ticket out, after talking to the manager-whatever I tore up my ticket and left it on the table. 

Now that my review is almost over I feel better letting the world know what to expect from this place. I would really like to be contacted by someone @Palazzo or CV , but in the Corporate, Dollar 1st Attitude that predominates the strip now I seriously doubt that will happen. 

And Hotel/Casinos wonder why they have a hard time bringing locals to the Strip?

First of all, one of our party ordered a glass of wine, and as the server poured the wine, he appeared to be spilling wine all over the table, and being indifferent his poor pouring ability. Once the splashing was noticed, he realized what was happening, and it turns out that the wine glass had a hole the size of a quarter in the glass. A perfect circle cut out of the side of the glass. Very strange. He replaced the glass and served a new glass of wine, and it became a comical event. Then things took a turn for the worse.

We ordered a filet, orecchiette, a ravioli dish, and mushrooms. We ordered the grilled octopus, as an appetizer, on the servers recommendation. And we also debated on whether to order the brussel sprouts or the broccoli, and again the server recommended the brussel sprouts, so went on his recommendation and went that route.

Then the dinner came, and we were given the broccoli, not the brussel sprouts, and no grilled octopus. When we asked about the octopus, the server replied 'Oh, i forgot to put it in.'.... ?!?!?! Then we asked about the brussel sprouts, and he told us we ordered the broccoli, which had definitely not ordered. At this point, things were not looking good for Carnevino, it seemed to be a comedy of errors. The server then came and told us he put in the grilled octopus and he would comp it, which was unnecessary, but appreciated.

Finally, we ate our food..... and all was forgiven. The orecchiette was great, a little small in portion, especially while splitting it between two people, but it had great flavor. The steak was well cooked and had excellent taste. I did not taste the ravioli, but I heard no complaints either. While we were eating they brought out the grilled octopus and it was completely worth the wait. It tasted amazing. I was with three people who had never had octopus, and were reluctant to try it, but I badgered them to give it a taste, and they all three equally loved it.

Despite the serving snafu's the actual meal was very pleasing. And the server did atone for any mistakes he may have made throughout the meal. I don't know if I would return here, due to all the eating options at the Palazzo/Venetian, but I would recommend others to give it a try and taste the octopus at the very least.",KQ_xluOMPL9VolI1OIfQ0A,0,0,3,dTTIIpTs-aWSQPOaGRg8CQ

A note on price:  Things definitely are more expensive in Las Vegas.  While it is annoying, I try not to let it affect too much of my review, since paying more in LV comes with the territory.  That being said, the cost was slightly more than it needed to be even with a mark up and hence I've rounded down my review.  This place was the most expensive steak I ever had.

This is definitely a nice restaurant -- this is the type of place you come for an occassion.  Jackets aren't required, but you want to look nice as this is a white table cloth type of place.

The food here was good.  I ordered the 12 oz filet which came out cooked to my specifications (medium).  Often I've found places to err on the side of going too rare for my tastes, but this place cooked their steak right.  The meat was the size of a baseball -- a delicious baseball.

The side dishes were good -- we had one of the potato dishes and a broccoli side.  Both were good, but the portion sizes were TOO SMALL.  The server said that a side dish would feed two people, but that was not the case at all.  Basically, one side dish per person here and each one runs around $12.

I had a mint infused manhattan as a beverage and it was great.  A nice take on a classic beverage as the mint gave it a nice refreshing flavor.

Service was nice and friendly, though they were a little skimpy on the bread.  I basically had to keep asking for my bread.  What can I say?  I love bread.

During our recent Labor Day trip we chose to eat at Carnevino.  There were so many restaurants on our list but this was recommended by a friend so we decided to give it a try and I'm glad we did!

True, this place is a bit on the pricey side but you get what you pay for. From the moment you walk in, you feel different. Classy. Elegant. Important.  Our waiter was well spoken, offered nice recommendations, and humorous. I give their service 5 stars.

My favorite part of the meal was the mashed potatoes and I'm ALWAYS about the meat, or so I thought.  They break a poached egg into the mashed potatoes upon serving. It was absolutely divine!

I ordered the filet mignon cooked medium and that's exactly what I got.  I usually get a sauce on top but it doesn't always satisfy so I opted for no sauce and LOVED it.  The flavor of the meat really came through and the steak was juicy in every bite.

The sides are ordered √† la carte, much like other steakhouses.  They are priced reasonably at $9 each.

The dessert really surprised me.  It certainly wasn't a contender upon reading the menu, even though I love ricotta.  Our waiter highly recommended it and described it with such passion that I could almost taste it. We had to try it!  It is not what you expect in a ""tart"" so you should try for yourself.

The meat was perfect (med rare) and I had sides of Fries (couldn't resist) and Broccoli sauteed. For me, I do not put salt on anything, so I did find it alittle salty for me, but not overt.

Our pasta course was the beef cheek ravioli and the gnocchi with peas and prosciutto--both were light, well balanced dishes--super flavorful!

For our main course we shared the dry-aged ribeye for two--no question best steak we've ever had! We had the potatoes and they were very delicious!

One even said that upon arrival, there would be something special done for them upon arrival. After my parent's meal there, my mom mentioned that nothing AT ALL was done in commemoration of their special evening. My parents ordered a gelato for dessert, and NO MENTION or commemoration of their anniversary at all. If I had known that their staff were dishonest, I would have purchased them a gift card at one of the top notch restauarants at neighboring Wynn hotel, where I was promised something much more special for their anniversary celebration. Definitely would not dine here again given their lack of honesty. I even spoke to the General Manager, who only offered a verbal apology and said I hoped I would dine with them again.

4474487,2015-10-14,0,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"I was dinning alone and was disappointed that the steaks were both too large and too expensive.   I'm very familiar with premium steakhouses and the rise in beef costs but the they were offering a 16oz NY Strip for $70.   Why not a 10oz or even a 12oz?

I was talking to the couple next to me and they made the same observation.  They had trouble finishing the one steak they split.

I ordered the pork chop Milanese style and it lacked the dark, crusty fried outside I prefer.  The meat was good and it was not overcooked but it was under flavored.   Instead of a chopped arugala or green salad it had a braised fennel topping with very sparse grape tomato halves.   Again, for me these was a miss in that I prefer flavorful greens and more tomatoes.  I like this dish because you don't need to order a salad usually, the topping, along with shaved Parm  usually fills the bill,  but this topping disappointed.

The butter served with the bread was great but the bread itself reminded me of the bread they serve in Italy....good but lacking in salt....bland in other words.

The house Fruilino by Bastinich is very good.

The bar area is lively.....walk all the way to the back....the beauty of the restaurant is hidden in the back.

Also, a word to the tall bartender....if someone asks you for an ice water, serve it with ice.  This is America and we like ice in our ice water.  And don't frown if a single person isn't ordering sides.  Your menu is too geared to large parties.",35KhmbouS8gY-eIADqoEgg,1,0,3,XMGr_Rtzaatgbvjo6pv83w
4476425,2014-05-15,1,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"Carnevino is one of the early restaurants I've bookmarked on Yelp (2011!), and I've finally kicked this one off my food bucket list. 

First a disclaimer - my friend has a sister who used to work with the the staff here, so we had amazing service. With that said, onto the food...

The appetizers - We got to try the Grilled Octopus, Carne Cruda Alla Piemontese (steak tartar), and the Lonza.

1. Grilled Octopus - I've never tried octopus this tender. Always have I thought that octopus is always chewy and tough, but the way Carnevino cooked it was amazing. The light citrusy sauce and the sprouts complemented the octopus well - easily one of my favorite things of the night.

2. Carne Cruda Alla Piemontese (steak tartar) - Solid steak tartar. Comes with mushrooms on top and what I believe are thinly sliced oyster(?) mushrooms on the side. Very good, comes with delicious crostinis. 

3. Lonza - Interesting fava beans and ricotta salad. It was a great balancer to other heavier things, although I wouldn't really put this on the top of my list to order. 

Onto the pasta. 

1. Beef cheek ravioli - This is a secret dish that I believe is from Mario's other restaurant, B&B. We got it with truffle on top. This was heavily talked up, but not exactly my cup of tea. When it comes to pasta, I prefer red sauce over white, meaning this dish was way too rich for me. Delicious nonetheless, but not my favorite.

2. Gnocchi - Surprisingly good. I never usually like gnocchi so this is quite possibly the best gnocchi I've had. Comes with English peas, prosciutto, ricotta salata. It's not over the top rich and it's really chewy. 

3. Orecchiette - Sweet sausage and broccoli rabe, come in red sauce. This was the best pasta of the night. SO addicting and chewy. Get it.

Now the main course - MEAT.

1. Lamb chops - Split between 6 people, we got one rack each. The lamb was so tender and did not have that gamy flavor lamb usually has. V

2. Porterhouse for 2 - Definitely the star of the show. You come here to get this. The filet side of the porterhouse was soo tender and juicy. Especially the part attached to the bone. One of the best steaks I've ever had. 

3. Bone in Ribeye - This was better than the strip part of the porterhouse, but worse than the filet. All around, it felt like the better bang for the buck than the porterhouse.

Of course they wouldn't let us leave without dessert...we had two things but the strawberry shortcake was money.",Wez_YoTdzSxsBWPvx-leaA,3,1,5,vi9CuBwpxXPWdzqVATFJxg

4484314,2010-04-21,6,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"I've eaten at Carnevino a couple of times in the lounge area where I've ordered from the less expensive bar menu, and have been thoroughly impressed (they have a better fancy burger than Bradley Ogden, if you ask me) so my husband and I decided to eat in the dining room for our first anniversary on Sunday. The understated decor is reminiscent of a simple yet sophisticated Italian country villa, and the general aura is relaxed and welcoming. 

Every person on the wait staff was friendly and knowledgeable and the managers were gracious and accommodating. Because it was our anniversary we each received a complimentary glass of Bastianich's own Brut upon arrival (normally $14 a pop), but more notably, because we are locals, we received 15 % off our entire bill. I believe Batali is the only chef thus far to offer such a discount on a regular basis, and he should be commended for it. 

For an appetizer we ordered the pappardelle with 'porcini trifolati,' or cooked porcini mushrooms($22). Porcini mushrooms are my favorite mushroom. They are generally large and have a sponge-like underside rather than gills, giving them a kind of chewy yet slippery texture. When I saw porcini I got incredibly excited because the only place I have seen fresh porcini mushrooms in the states is at the Ferry Building farmer's market in San Francisco. While living in Italy they could be found everywhere in the Fall, even at road stands, and I frequently ordered this exact dish whenever I could. Needless to say I was truly disappointed when the dish came out full of shitakes and other varieties of mushrooms, with nothing like the porcinis I know and love. If the menu had just said 'pappardelle with mushrooms' I would have been completely satisfied, as the pasta was beautifully home-made and tossed in a light yet buttery sauce. Sadly, this misrepresentation showed up more than once on the menu. Our spinach side was supposed to have cherry peppers to give a kick, yet didn't, and our 'spring peas with pancetta' turned out to be snow peas. 

The steak was the real showstopper of the meal. I try to be frugal when dining out, but as a self-proclaimed foodie I am also willing to pay big money for something novel and ridiculously good. That something today was the 240 day dry-aged steak that cost $100 an inch. Dry-aging of beef is basically the controlled rotting of the exterior of the meat in a cold environment that results in the formation of a skin, or pellicle, that is then removed prior to cooking. It is an expensive process and therefore results in better, but less frugal, cuts of meat. Most well-marbled high grade meat is dry-aged for some amount of time as it dramatically enhances and concentrates the flavor, but this time can range from a few weeks to about the 240 days given the riserva steak here (we were told the slaughter date for our beef was circa early August, 2009). A second manager prepared it for us tableside by skillfully slicing it on a wooden board and drizzling it with the chef's recommendation of a little olive oil and a sprinkle of salt. We ordered the horseradish black pepper zabaglione as an accompanying sauce, but despite its ethereal qualities, it was utterly unnecessary and almost felt like a sin to use on this particular piece of meat. The inherent flavors of the steak were not powerful enough to stand up to it, and only by eating the steak alone could you truly appreciate the process and time required to create such a masterpiece. The wait staff described the flavor as earthy, but for me it was as if the aroma you get when you first walk into a fabulous cheese store (such as Murray's in the West Village) found its way into the meat and then ultimately into your mouth in a subtle yet obvious way. Combine that with the intensely flavored juices of the best quality steak you can buy and the result is unlike anything you've had before. As I continued to analyze the complexity of flavors twinkling in my mouth I looked over at my husband and saw teardrops welling in his eyes. When he noticed I was looking at him he said, ""I'll cry over meat, I don't give a f*#!."" I was hoping he was tearing up over how happy he felt to be married to me, but no, it was the steak he was feeling such a fondness for. I really wasn't hurt at all because I felt the same, and in all fairness, you can't have a steak like that everyday for the rest of your life. 

As far as Strip restaurants go, I would be more inclined to come back here rather than try some of the other celebrity chef restaurants I haven't yet been to. Usually you don't get what you pay for, but I felt the prices charged here were deserved. To boot, the service and ambiance were top notch without being stuffy. If you are looking for a special occasion place, Carnevino is now on my list of top ten Strip restaurants.

It's an expensive place, which in itself is not bad, but the value for the money is just not there.  For what we spent, I expected so much more. Whether it's the entrees, the wines by the glass, or the limited selection of bottled (only) beers (I like beer with my meat), Carnevino disappointed us all (party of 8, many different dishes) on every level. From poor service, to small entree portions and $9 sides (most entrees are side-less, which for a $30 to $50 entree just does not compute), to over-seasoned food, this clearly was not the right choice for us.

And clearly this decision was among the best we've made in a town full of...well..let's just say ""not so great ones."" The waiter instructed us to order it medium, if we normally were medium-rare guys, as they under-cook their steaks and he was right. I've actually never ordered a steak above medium-rare- but this one came out just to my liking. Now- what made this steak perfection was simple- perfect amount of salt, pepper, rosemary to season, which allowed it to be nicely charred and then they drizzle it with great olive oil at the table. WOW is the right word to describe it- as I not only helped finish the steak with my two buddies- but I got the bone and tore it apart (there are pictures to prove that I sat there and ate every piece of steak off the bone like some sort of dog). Ok- my apologies for the novel on just the steak- but I had to share the love I've developed for Vegas via this ribeye. 
Other amazing highlights- the bread with the two spreads. The only negative I have about the pork fat spread is just the name- a rebranding of such is in need to soften what sounds like ""heart attack in a bowl!"" Maybe call it something like- ""pork infused butter!""
It's quite amazing, especially when you mix it with the normal butter at the table. 
For the sides we got a truffle pasta (honestly I don't remember this dish much, as I was in heavenly bliss with my steak while it occupied space on our table), which tasted pretty damn great. We also got the mash potatoes, which I did sample at the end and they were quite epic. We ended dinner with a chocolate and peanut butter torte for my buddy's birthday and that also was fantastic!

After dinner, we sat around for a while chatting and were asked to move so they could clean the table. This was after ordering a $1400 meal (including two nice bottles of wine). This was a bit odd...

Three reasons: 1) they are both in high end hotels, 2) their tasting menus with wine pairings are exactly the same price, and 3) because they both carry the Batali name. 

We did the beef tasting menu paired with wine. As excited as I was to eat my way through this menu, nothing really stood out. I didn't think the quality of beef was necessarily the best I've ever had and there was a certain creative element lacking from both the presentation and ingredients. Underwhelming but don't get me wrong, the food was good. Just not rock-your-socks-off good.

We bought a $300 bottle of wine for two, ordered a variety of sides, and new york's at $70 per. Wine was fine but the stakes SUCKED.  I mean really sucked.  I haven't had anything this bad since.....  ever.  I can't come up with a comparison of horrible.  Extremely tough.  Grizzly throughout.  Crust you couldn't cut.  No distinctive taste.  Hint: Offer patrons serrated knives if you are going to serve rubber turf.  

Sides were mediocre at best.  Nothing special.  Almost seemed fresh frozen.  Probably because were so pissed.  Our dinner was the sides... so you're not going to be happy.  

In sum, I wasted a really great bottle of wine on cafeteria food on nice dishes delivered by really nice people in a really pretty room.  

followup: I talked with the manager afterwards and he offered some deserts.  No thanks.  Head chef implied it was because we wanted our own personal steaks rather than have them served cafeteria (family) style.  The restaurant wants you to eat family style which is when you cut everyone's steaks up into small pieces and expect the table to fork them out like a share.  You get some of mine and I get some of yours...  Okay....  That might be fine for some but offer a disclaimer that ""super steaks we promote may not be as described unless you let the servers cut them into thin slices so you don't notice the lower quality"".   

They took the steaks off the tab but I want my night back.  Should have gone to Morton's or Ruth's Chris for true quality and same price.

This was our favorite. Atmosphere is romantic clean high ceilings dark wood steakhouse atmosphere . Our biggest complaint was that they played hard rock and heavy metal music loud the entire evening. When we inquired we were told Mario and Joe inand demand it this way. While I can respect their choice I thought it could've been dialed in to be more suitable. We had many dishes. All of the appetizers were fabulous well-balanced well comprised lots of detail paid to different flavors. I found it difficult to limit your self to just one or two many were unique though I guess I could come back another time. But many favorites Salads have the same result. We ordered a pasta dish it's crispy prosciutto Rich sanmarzano tomatoes over pasta was fabulous. We ordered steak for two. tender flavorful steak prepared exceptionally well and sliced up table-side just perfectly aged and prepared. We ordered Veal Melanaise which was a pork chop pounded extremely thin lightly crusted cooked perfectly cherry tomatoes and fennel that was lightly and wonderfully pickled with fresh parsley. Ordered a veal saltinbocca that was also pounded extremely thin lately crusted over red wine duction and trickery. While veal was exceptionally prepared and composed it was put over a cabbage like red wine dark rich overbearing miss placed side. This I don't agree with. I believe it would been better suited with something light that had an orange or lemon zest tied to it. In Some greens. Pickled onions shallots/crispy . Some type baked pear or apple. ; along with a reduction sauce or compote. 
For dessert we ordered home made mini donuts with a lemon creme fresh filling. Berries fresh whipped cream. Berries compote and sliced peaches. The whipped cream along with the entire dish worked wonderfully. My criticism is that the donut was too thick and a bit dense the filling was watery and a bit plain. Maybe to accompany the beautiful bright berries compote. But you could not cut the donut or just take bite without the filling to run out.

First--you must ask if J.T. is working the bar. He is so much fun and really knows his drinks and mixology. Actually, the entire staff is beyond amazing and this is one of my new FAV spots. 
If you love sipping on a great bourbon, tequila or vodka and don't mind spending $$ on a great drink, you have to ask the bartenders what their favorites are! 
I met so many great people at the bar that had actually come back from the previous night just to see J.T. and have him make them cocktails and recommend what they should have for dinner.
Grilled Octopus - YUMMY (4 people has it while I was there)
I had the orecchiette pasta, it was really great and the portion size was perfect.
I love that you can order side dishes, salads, dinner and desert at the bar or in the main dining room, which is beautiful!

I really disagree with the price-point that Carnevino has set so only 4/5 stars. But for now, the food is so good that I'm sort of willing to overlook the high mark-up on the food and drinks.

Food comes out hot and beautiful! Table-side carving and service, very attentive service. The wine selection here is INSANE! So much to choose from, everything from medium-end to very high end. I don't drink or know wine well enough so I had the market cocktail which was a seasonl berry mix cocktail. It was strong and delicious, very refreshing.

We ordered a lot of stuff, see pics! 

Here is what I remember us ordering:

1. The famous bone-in ribeye which was sooo juicy and tender. The filet cut was my favorite part :) 

2.  Veal chops which was also juicy and tender. This wasn't the group's favorite but was still pretty good so that's saying somethin'!

3. Porterhouse which was tender and perfectly cooked. I don't even like fat but this time, I did.

4. Spinach side, broccoli side, and mashed potatoes and egg side all which were good with the steaks.

5. Gelato and apple fritter for desserts - both were delicate and delicious. 

An extra note on the service: The servers really know their stuff! I learned a lot about a cow in one sitting! I was very impressed with how well they carved the meat while explaining the wonderful world of steak(s).",nlowCDWvJBurOGGMXzjqHA,2,2,4,j-jUkRZx8EGoc2a7uM47eg
4560105,2010-04-18,0,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"I realize that Vegas and overpriced go hand in hand, particularly when wining and dining on the Strip, but among my dining experiences in this city I'd rank this in the lower percentile when justifying the hit my bank account takes.  It boiled down to service and overall value.

We were lured in by Mario Batali's name being on the door.  We were greeted and seated promptly in a low-lit dining room of dark, rich wood and wine lining the back wall.  The entire albums of Keane and U2 played during the course of our meal, which I found not to fit with the intended ambience, but oh well.

While our server was friendly and seemed knowledgeable, beginning with ordering our wine I felt like he would suggest nothing but the most expensive things on the menu.  For example, after passing on a $21 glass of chardonnay and inquiring about another good white wine, I was referred to the $18 option.  

And so it continued with our entrees--apparently we would be missing the holy grail not to have ordered every single course, including the $65 ribeye--so when my dining companion and I honed in on pasta (we had eaten on the plane and weren't starving), our server seemed put off, even moreso when we chose the appetizer size.  I even got the ""Are you sure?  You're only going to get this much [gesturing to the bread plate].""  At that point, yes--I was very sure.

That aside our meal was pretty enjoyable.  We started by sharing the cured meats plate and Zach's chopped salad, which was full of flavor with beans, parmesean and just the right amount of dressing.  For the entree my dining companion had black fettucine with crab and jalapeno, and I had the potato gnocchi, which was OK but could've had a little more flavor.  May I add it arrived on a plate larger than the bread plate.

Overall, I feel like the experience didn't live up to the name.  Sorry, Mario.",wWAJ5WEAs7kL7e20RT79kQ,0,0,2,hgKmNvbayPinO6YxgpN56A

The dry aged steak... I do wish we had read the review about this exact same issue. It was tough, terrible flavor, and thankfully only one of the four of us ordered it.

I was starving already and what felt like an eternity was probably a half hour before our waiter took our order. But I must say that the food came fairly quickly after the order was placed. 

We came with a party of 10. I shared the rib-eye, in addition to two sides, with my husband and a girlfriend.  The rib-eye was well worth the money and should be tried at least once. I would actually eat it a second time.  For the sides, we order the shitake mushooms and asparagus - both were good. 

Other people on our table ordered the filet mignon, the porterhouse, and the truffle pasta - none of which were as good as the rib-eye. I tried my friends' dishes as well, but there wasn't much worth remembering about the filet mignon or the porterhouse. I don't remember the name of the pasta dish, but as soon as the waiter mentioned ""truffle"", the two girls that ordered it were sold on it. Unfortunately, truffle is not always good on everything.  The pasta was drenched in truffle oil - definitely too rich for my palate. 

By the end of the meal, we were beyond stuffed and didn't have room for desserts. However, we were celebrating the birthday of three of the guys and the restaurant was nice enough to give us some cookies.. or not. Though the gesture was nice, other restaurants like Elephant Bar gives better desserts than cookies to birthday folks. I didn't taste the cookies because the appearance didn't look appealing already, but those that did said it was stale. Perhaps they like to age their cookies too???",6lS5Maw27gTm4X9uV6bdIA,0,0,4,ce4dROnoSJ8T5UD3-cGMqQ

4576768,2012-02-22,0,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"Fantastic! 

Visited this establishment last week while in Vegas for Valentines Day.

First off, Giulio (sp) our server, was amazing. Top Notch. Most likely the best server I have had at a restaurant period. His recommendations steered us to a fantastic dining experience, he offered us a few things off the menu including an appetizer that was superb, and a special gelato flavor for dessert that was unbelievable. 

Seating was delayed about 10 minutes past our reservation, but it was Valentine's day night, and I will excuse it, realistically, it happens. 

We had the chopped Salad and a tri-tip ravioli as our appetizers, I sampled both and they were both very good. The salad has a nice kick from the peppers to it, and the ravioli was served with a 25 year aged balsamic that topped it beautifully. 

Main course was the 90 day dry-aged rib-eye, which is carved table side. Giulio did recommend that we order it medium instead of medium-rare as we asked, stating that the medium here is closed to a traditional medium-rare. I was very glad we did as it was cooked perfectly. The meat just melted and while the rib-eye is pricey (72$ each) there was a very large portion served, and the quality of the meat spoke for the price. 

I try to visit one high-end steakhouse with each trip to Vegas, and so far Carnevino takes the cake. Definitely make a reservation, and ask for Giulio as he was amazing.",kkz3iUYNaFN4Rl53litsOA,1,1,5,1X85v_y6ZsVFpSwl8zeEmg

Waiter came by for drink orders and to explain the menu. We wanted the aged rib eye for two but one problem, I like it med rare and my gf likes it.....well......ruined! I mean well done. The thing is both people have to order it the same. Price was $72 for each person. Ordering it separately $95!! What?! No steak is worth that much!!

 I settled for the NY Strip, so did my gf. We also ordered Beef Cheek Ravioli as an appetizer as suggested by our waiter. Very GOOD choice, strong beef flavor and the meat just melts in your mouth! We also ordered 1 Jumbo Mediterranean Shrimp, VERY GOOD! Geez it looked and tasted like lobster it was sooo huge! I swear it must have been one pound, okay maybe not. Maybe 1/2 a pound. The only other side was some sort of Garlic Mash Potatoes which had a poached egg in it, and the waiter mixed it in before he left. I must say those were the BEST mashed potatoes I've had. I thought it was gross to have that basically raw egg in their but damn it was good! 

Oh yeah at the beginning we were brought bread. Rosemary something, with butter and lard. I preferred the butter.

The reason for 4 stars and not 5 is for the price of a rib eye for 1 person. To me it should be offered for one at a more reasonable price. The NY strip just didn't cut it for me. It was alright, not as flavorful to me and a bit overpriced. My gf on the other hand loved it, but then again she likes her steaks WELL DONE! Ugh!

For dinner I had the veal and my boyfriend had the dry aged NY strip steak bone in and brussel sprouts that were very dry. Our bill came to $250 for 2 with out gratuity and for that price I was definitely disappointed.",c2WZFb2MiYCTJUNJ0tU51g,1,0,3,M7fTN24swT8B9XnNGQjRXQ

The highlight of the meal was ravioli stuffed with beef cheeks, a special of the day and I believe a Battali specialty.  They were great, and the balsamic drizzled on it made the dish.

For an entree shared a porterhouse for two.  Luckily, the waiter and other Yelpers warned how they cook on the rare side and people are not exaggerating.  I hate over cooked steak but we ordered it medium and ended up with rare or rare +, which was perfect but anything less would not have been.  The strength of the steak was the aging, and you could definitely taste the age flavor (and that is a good thing).  Also had fried eggplant as a side, and that was great.

For dessert, had a very good pistachio cannoli.  It was actually two large cannolis and I would have been happy with one.  

The steak and ravioli earned that fifth star in a competitive steak field.",tkAjiVsQEhcVjc-0CKzcNg,1,1,5,EeNKtAOfj60ThL4JqTg6_Q

The first time I came, I had the NY Strip and it was, without a doubt, the best steakhouse beef I've ever had. The second time I had the filet at the bar and it was also delicious. This time, a buddy and I made our own surf and turf, as he got the NY Strip and I got the seafood pasta and we shared. The steak was not as good as the first two times. Oh, it was still good, it just wasn't GREAT like the first couple. The seafood pasta was nice, but a couple of bits of the lobster were tough and I was hoping for more spice. I will give them major props for the octopus appetizer, which was hands down the best octopus I've ever had. Incredibly tender and with rich flavor from a superb limoncello marinade. Batali has a way with the eight-tentacled creature, because the second-best octopus I've ever had was at the B&B over in the Venetian. Another person at the table got the three double-cut lamb chops and it was enormous almost to the point of being ridiculous. I mean, this was not Mary's little lamb--this was a monster. As some others have mentioned, the sauces here are entirely extraneous and unnecessary. For the vast majority of dishes, the regular preparation is plenty of seasoning. The sides were hit and miss. The hit was the spinach with garlic and hot pepper, which was a cool take on steakhouse spinach, being something other than creamed. The mascarpone mashed potatoes, though, were the sorriest excuse for mashed potatoes ever placed in front of me at a steakhouse. I'd say they tasted like instant, except that would be an insult to instant. I really hope it was just an off night for the potato chef. 

Service and pacing were on point, as you would expect from these owners in this location.

Couple of other notes: When we ordered the NY Strip medium-rare, we were told, ""Our medium-rare is more like rare."" Huh? Isn't this thing supposed to be somewhat standardized? I mean, if it's ""more like rare"", then call it rare and stop confusing people who went to Double Helix and had two pear winetinis before dinner.
Also, this restaurant is huge. (I guess it would have to be, just to store the lamb chops.) But I mean really, I believe there are Palazzo guestroom bathrooms that are closer to the tables than the one in the restaurant.

""Deep, rich, complex and flavorful"" don't even begin to describe this one-of-a-kind beef. Absolutely unbelievable. Now I understand all the hype about Carnevino dry aging meat in their warehouse on Dean Martin for up to 120 days. Impossible to duplicate at home and worth every penny. It is a masterful combination of art and science. Bravo!

Other than the steak, the burrata caprese was excellent and the affettati misti were very good, albeit somewhat skimpy. The orecchiette with broccoli rabe were also very good. Perfectly cooked homemade orecchiette combined with sausage bits and broccoli rabe is always a big favorite of ours and Carnevino's did not disappoint.

Tiramisu was ok and gelato was top notch. Wine list is very impressive but typically weighted with very expensive selections. BYOB might be a good choice and better value for most diners. Nevertheless, the sommelier was adept at suggesting excellent values for us. So top marks for her. She was pleasant, knowledgeable, thorough and very helpful. (unfortunately I did not get her name)

Where things took a disappointing turn is with the wait service. Possibly he was just having a bad night, but our main waiter simply did not emanate the kind of pleasant, classy, ""can-do"" hospitality one would expect at this level. He seemed out of place in a high-end restaurant like this. His demeanor simply was not on par with the quality of the food and surroundings. A pet peeve of mine is constantly being told ""no"" by the wait staff when dining in a fine establishment. Our waiter must have told us ""no"" a dozen times. His overall attitude was that he seemed irritated by having to serve us. My dinner guests even stated ""why is this waiter so negative?"" Too bad. His negative energy tarnished an otherwise fabulous evening.

If you dislike your job, then do something else. Life is too short. But don't take it out on guests who pay top dollar and expect a premium experience. Just my opinion.

The primary reason and was definitely why our husbands recommended it.  When making the reservation we were told that we should call the morning of to reserve a piece so we did.  Then we were told to remind the person who seats us that we want the Reserva and we did and we were told that they have it.  As the waiter came to help us he said they didn't have it.  Confused as to how they ran out within 3 minutes of us asking for it but whatever.  So we ordered the following:
Oysters (6 pieces) - These were delicious.  I could have had all 6 by myself because they were tiny but that's exactly how I like my oysters.  
Octopus (4 pieces) - These were cooked perfectly which is tricky when it comes to cooking a full grown octopus.  The pieces were cut from the largest part of the tentacles.  They were tender and perfectly seasoned. 
Chopped salad - Difficult to ruin.  This was a fine salad.  Other than the house pickled pepper, nothing different.
Rib Eye - The waiter made suggestions on how it should be cooked.  I like my steak medium rare and it was done exactly that way.  One specific person is assigned to table service to cut your steak for you.  Very nicely done. 
Beef Cheek Ravioli - Half of us liked it, half of us didn't.  I thought it tasted delicious and could have had it for a meal.  Others thought it tasted ""livery"". Either way the aged balsamic vinegar was a really nice touch. 
Green beans with pork belly - pretty standard and nice and crispy, not soggy. 
Mashed potato - very creamy.  Loved the poached egg on top.  Perfect!
Cocktails - My drink is generally a blood and sand.  Waiters don't always know what that is but this guy knew to ask what kind of scotch I wanted.  Was so happy to know that he knew what I was talking about!  Perfectly garnished and perfectly mixed. 
We were seated in a hallway type area which doubles as a wine cellar.  It was a nice setting and quiet setting but a bit chilly.  

With Vegas being Vegas we were harassed by a few men from a bachelor party.  The staff noticed this and the manager and waiter intervened several times without our request.  They even offered to walk us back to our car.  This was very much appreciated.  The staff is very attentive.  Had they given us the steak we wanted, they would have gotten 5 stars!

Service:  Was good but nothing out of the ordianary.  Waiter came right away and made some good recommendations.  Water was promptly refilled. Our table (as well as the one next to ours) was unbalanced.  So one of the servers had to get down on his knees and make some adjustments.  Kind of awkward.

4706061,2010-01-22,0,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"Meat is murder... yummy delicious murder.  

Cliff notes version for NY eaters that have certain expectations for a Batali restaurant, you won't be disappointed if you're ready to pay the ""Vegas tax.""

I went during a weekday night during Vegas low season... and this is a Vegas restaurant so I expected it to lean toward a bit more expensive than normal.  And we didn't wait for a table... just strolled in and the seated us immediately.  (We originally wanted to go to Bouchon but it was closed for a private event)

You'll notice how a lot of people complain about cost.  I'm sure fellow New Yorkers will find the prices comparable to some of the better steakhouses in the city.  Probably about 10% more than if it was in the city than in Vegas... which is understandable if they want to maintain the quality.  

And the food itself?  Excellent.  The pastas were all, in the words of my gf... ""very well executed.""  And they definitely were... the fish was good and my osco buco... best I've ever had.  So far, nobody was able to beat my gf's homemade.  Until now.  She admitted defeat it was that good.  Portions?  Not HUGE but boy... the meal was FILLING.  Portions may not be typical west coast huge... but they weren't small.  I'd say they're just about right for us fat Americans out east.  Even the rosemary bread at the beginning of the meal (served with both lardo!) was nomnomnom.  I had a taste of the trout special, as well as a taste of the two other pastas we ordered.  We also had two sides, sweet potatoes and ""Tuscan"" fries (basically roasted & fried potato slices).  Everything was cooked just right, al dente pastas, moist fish and meat.    Though they made a small mistake with a few crab shell pieces in my gf's pasta, (not the chef's fault but more prep's fault) they treated us to dessert.  And the dessert was also great though we were so stuffed, the four of us couldn't really eat more than a few bites.
  
Batali and Bastanich hire good chefs and staff.  Service was quite good. Pretty attentive, helpful when called upon though the runners were a bit clueless.  They called our trout dish ""salmon"" causing confusion.  And later, the misstep by the prep staff with leaving crab shells with the meat.  Treating us to dessert was a nice gesture.

If the restaurant ran to perfection, I would have gone with 5 stars with the Vegas expensiveness held in account.  If they opened this restaurant in NYC with those prices, I wouldn't go over 4, even with perfect execution.  There is value to be had in the menu, you just have to find it.

We didn't have any wine, but yes, the list was pricey.  I had a beer and that selection was nicely paired with the fare offered.

That being said... veal is still yummy in my tummy.  That's why they get 4, otherwise, it would have been 3 because of the borderline QPR.",nQhxjCpGDgmkRZwhwwcOKQ,0,0,4,YD1AV1Cz8oRdUj2_sgE8kA

I was excited to taste a 90 day aged bone-in ribeye. My disappointment was the fact that my steak was cooked to perfection (medium rare) but it certainly was not as tender as I anticipated for a $144 steak. I also ordered their calamari which was mediocre at best. I ordered their grilled octopus and I must say it's probably one of the better grilled octopus dishes I've had and I'm a big fan of the octopus at Estiatoro Milos in the Cosmopolitan. The starch I ordered was their mascarpone guanciale mashed potatoes and it was the bomb! I would definitely come back just for the grilled octopus and the mashed potatoes.

I felt a little cheated and very unsatisfied by Carnevino.  Would you believe I left what is being called the ""best steak in Las Vegas"" wanting a steak?  Yep, that's exactly how I felt.

I enjoyed almost everything about the place EXCEPT the steak.  

Service was good.  Our waiter was attentive, recommended items etc.  The Sommelier seemed unprepared and really made no recommendations, even though I asked, other than confirming my choice of wines.

The Gnocchi, we shared an order as an appetizer was delicious.  Light, creamy, fluffy. 

The Lardo, served with the fresh rosemary bread was delicious.

Sides were yummy - fried Eggplant was the highlight and the roasted Beets were a real treat too.

The sauces were lousy.  The Truffle vinaigrette, which was recommended by our waiter, was overly oily.  The Horseradish zabaione had no distinguishable flavor other than pepper.

The steak, oh the streak.  $160 for 2.  We had the Porterhouse, described by the waiter as the be all end all of streaks.  In truth I found it tough and flavorless.  Not at all what we expected for $80 per person.  The fillet side was more tender but still lacked flavor.  Perhaps that's why they offer a choice of so many sauces to be paired with the steak and we just ordered the wrongs ones.  The sirloin side was tough (we ordered Medium, which came like Medium Rare, which we were told by the waiter would be the case.) But dry the streak seemed, just that.  I would have been happier simply ordering the Fillet of the menu.

And if I was sharing it with another person (or two more people) this would have been great.

The gelato is really disappointing. It might as well be Breyer's ice cream. I base this on a great deal of experience with gelato from many parts of Italy as well as my favorite restaurant, which Carnevino should call on - Mozza in LA. Those guys have gelato nailed.

Carnevino serves a great prosecco (although they charge way too much for it based on the extensive prosecco experience I have), but the bartenders were always top-notch and super-friendly. 

This place is definitely worth a try, but I would suggest dining at B&B in the same hotel to compare (although I didn't have the gelato there).",JENs7gmDXUkXplFSXLXR0Q,1,0,4,ZbDd2_1Lo1cAl-s8uMsUKw

We sat in the corner at the bar as those were the only two seats available.

Clearly, they needed more staff to support the dinner crowd. I had to ask for two waters first (we were parched from a lot of walking as you do while in Vegas) and then we gave our drink orders. The cocktails were hand crafted, beautiful and delicious, just expensive. 
We decided to share the baby beets and pistachio salad ($25) and the grilled octopus appetizer (also $25). Both were beautifully plated and delicious. We then shared the Spaghetti ai Frutti di Mare entree ($31), which was also delicious, just a smaller portion than expected. Their pasta is made daily in house and served al dente, so super fresh and delicious.
I wouldn't consider this place ideal for a romantic date due to the noise level and size (it's adjacent to the Palazzo casino), but if you're looking for fine dining and drinks at a big name restaurant in Vegas, I would recommend this one, just try to go at an off time for a better experience.

4750048,2014-01-12,9,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"Yo player, Carnevino is the trill deal. I broke a ""vegan for a month"" challenge to eat at this place and let me tell you, I did not regret doing it one bit after my experience.

My friend and I are like a nice steakhouse team, always looking for the best place that we can find. Lucky for us, Las Vegas provides many options.

So we go on this spur of the moment trip to Vegas and have already decided that we are going to go to either Craftsteak or Carnevino. What did we do to decide? The same thing everyone else does- look on yelp. When I saw the reviews for Carnevino and how everyone seemed to complain about sub-par service and quality of steak & sides, I wanted to go here about as bad as someone wants to go to an STD clinic to find a date. Forreal, yall m'f*ckas write some compelling ish on this site. 

Anyways, I tried to make a reservation at Craftsteak and they were booked. So were GR Steak and Delmonico. What were we to do? The only thing we could do...make a reservation at Carnevino and accept the punishment our patience and taste buds were about to endure. Boy were we wrong...

The hostess on the phone was bubbly as can be, made us an immediate reservation and convinced us that this was the best possible choice. I'm easily swayed, so my attitude about this place changed almost immediately.

We get there and are seated immediately by another (maybe the same) friendly hostess. Ambiance was on point. White table cloth, dim lit, comfortable seats, bookcases, and even a Persian rug! Our server JT was not, and I repeat WAS NOT Justin Timberlake. Disappointing I know, but if you translated his serving skills into  singing skills, he would have been better than Justin Timberlake, word is bond.

The ciabatta bread was soooooo damn tight! it came with butter, and pig fat blended with spices. Sounds gross, tastes okay; I wouldn't kill a man for it. Unfortunately, this is what kept Carnevino from getting the 5th star. I think they could do better.

We ordered the Ribeye for 2, mashed potatoes and mushrooms. These dishes... I would kill a man for.

The mashed potatoes had an effin' poached egg in 'em that one of the homeboys working there broke and mixed in for us! Dude, upon first bite I seriously said out loud ""that is what mashed potatoes should taste like. Someone call Merriam-Webster, and tell them that Carnevino just redefined what mashed potatoes are.""

Mushrooms were dope, had a balsamic glaze or something, but not much to elaborate on.

Most expensive steak houses all taste the same or close to the same with only minor differences between them. The steak at Carnevino was unique and in a class of it's own. There was a perfect crust on the meat, and if you told me that it was only seasoned with salt and pepper, I wouldn't believe you. It was cooked PERFECTLY and was served hot. It was so tender, flavorful and overall perfect that if you told me Jesus himself cooked it, I would totally believe you.

We received a couple of compliments from the chef, some cheese balls and shortbread cookies, both of which deserve honorable mention.

In conclusion, If you want amazing service, amazing food, amazing ambiance, but most importantly an amazing experience all at a decent price, go to Carnevino. If you don't want any of those other things, go to Cut and I'm sure you'll be satisfied.",7-T3TwRXXgT0y0YZZtDTEA,6,6,4,G7oGxkJoJz879YH-XvKgaA

Some friend bread with cheese is presented along with some very nice hot bread with a variety of butters.  Bread has a rosemary type garlic topping very good.  Unfortunately this is where the majority of the meal goes down hill.  

Multiple appetizers ordered Shirmp Ala Diablo $19.00 1 giant shrimp with a piece of italian bread in a spicy marinara sauce.  Specia Beef Cheek ravioli with a cream sauce topped with a drizzle of balsalmic vinegar was different.  An Angoltti was then presented with cream & mushroom..  other end of table had very nice Big Eye sushi tuna cut very thin told fresh.  House salads were ample not lacking in flavor. 

Entrees. 3 Veal Chops 2 cooked perfection 1 so fatty it was sent back and taken off the bill $85.00 each for a veal chop good but certainly not $85.00 worth and thats ala carte.   How can you serve a fatty $85.00 chop though? ....  Rib Eye steak again massively overpriced ok but nothing special.  Two veal dishes with musrooms were ICE COLD and had to be sent back.. Came back hot next time but so quickly can't imagine they weren't just nuked.  Pasta with assorted shellfish was fresh if not bland and a bone in Fitlet migon was probably best thing on table.  A non bone in filet and $40.00 lobster tail again COLD you really have to be kidding here. 

Side dishes were in short aside from the garlic mashed potatoes a complete and utter disappointiment from the fried eggplant, to spinach with hot peppers BAD.

Nice zeppoles and whipped cream for the birthday boy for desert.   Service was on but they simply coulnd't handle how busy they were.  

Goes to show you, put branding on anything and you can sell Ice to Eskimos.  2K with tax and tip when all was said and done, it I have to be honest this was truly an untter and complete disappointment.  Probably worth 2 Stars but with these price points, a veal chop going back, two veal dishes ice cold, a lobster tail and filet cold for all the Zagat ratings, all the clippings and my fellow yelpsters I DO NOT UNDERSTAND all the high rankings.. This is a DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY place that will never see us again.",ic3Lw9nuyESd5wFRH7TFpw,13,1,1,begazG4nNEf-1h877zZ3VQ

4764307,2017-10-13,3,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"Wonderfull experience. Our party of three shared the bone-in ribeye, and it was amazing. Our waiter explained their steaks exceed the USDA Prime standard, and are dry aged for 90 days. The aging process allows moisture to evaporate, and this creates a greater concentration of flavor and taste. Secondly, the beef's enzymes break down connective tissues, and this naturally tenderizes the meat. I wonder if the steak would be even better on the 91st day.

The steak was rolled out on a craving cart, and the rib was proudly displayed. Fred Flintstone would be envious. The color was beautiful, and it smelled fabulous. The attendant skillfully carved it up. First he cut away the bone, trimmed the fatty end pieces, and then sliced the meaty eye. It was sprinkled with a pinch of sea salt, and then plated. The steak was cooked perfectly to medium rare doneness (warm pink center). The steak was flavorful and tender. The meat next to the bone and the charred end pieces were especially flavorful. This steak was epic, and sure to be talked about for years.

Our waiter was fantastic. He steered us to some excellent recommendations (pun intended). We enjoyed Grilled Octopus, Zach's Chopped Salad, Grilled Asparagus, Charred Corn, and Spinach. For dessert we tried the Chocolate and Peanut Butter Torte, and the Salted Caramel Cheesecake. I recommend all.

The restaurant is very classy with one particular distraction. I was seated in such a way that I was facing the full size bull statue. It was very accurate if you know what I mean.",loHW3nLm8Ex5BbCu7QOVaA,8,4,5,ffKx4pdP94BdwQAFVb9Crg
4775088,2010-10-14,0,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"Food:
We started with the caprese salad. It was amazing. They served fresh, local heirloom tomatoes with creamy burrata cheese. 4 large slices and one generous portion of cheese.
Then we had 2 pastas. One was the crab and jalapeno black fettucine. The sweetness of the crab blended perfectly with the spicy jalapeno. The fettucine was also cooked perfectly al dente. The other was the duck liver ravioli (4 big pieces in small order). The best part was aged balsamic vinegar that they drizzled over the ravioli that balanced the heaviness of the liver. The best pastas we have ever had in our lives (even in Italy)
We ordered the ribeye that was shared by 2 ($65 each person). They serve it tableside, cutting the bone off first and then slicing different parts of the ribeye and portioning it out so that each person has the same amount of different cuts of the ribeye. It was perfectly cooked and the flavor was amazing. They did drizzle some olive oil on the ribeye, which I didn't think was necessary. I would have preferred some more vinegar on the side since the ribeye was so rich and fatty.

Service:
I was really high maintenance and they were excellent. First, I'm not a fan of rosemary and they had served rosemary rolls. I asked if there were other types, and they checked in on it for me. The manager came by and asked what was wrong and explained my options (which was not much - just crostini that was pre-cooked and not warm). I said that was fine and my waiter came by later to also check in on my satisfaction with the crostini.
Then, I had ordered a glass of wine with the ribeye. My waiter opened a new bottle for me and poured a tasting. I unexpectedly thought it was too light for the ribeye and said ""I guess it'll be ok"". The waiter took notice of my response and offered a glass of another wine instead. He then poured a sample of a heavier wine which matched much better with the ribeye. After I approved of the new wine, he poured me a glass of this new wine.

All in all, this was an excellent restaurant. I wish it was cheaper, but the food was worth the cost. 

One note: the prix-fixe pre-theater menus are only available at certain times (for example, being seated before 6:30). Although we were actually dining before a show, our reservation was at 7 (for a show at 9:30) so the prix fixe dinner was not available. We're actually glad it wasn't because we wouldn't have had a chance to try the excellent dishes we ended up ordering.",5ukgwfTcOSK5uY89raFD-Q,0,0,5,zFyLY26u79y2ZxderJ-HmQ
4777865,2016-01-14,4,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"This is classy af, pricey, special occasion dining. We all thought it was a good choice. Although the portion sizes were pretty miniscule, even for fine dining, the attentive service and elegant atmosphere made up for it in my opinion. I like the way that family style/sharing is highly encouraged too. 

The wine list is the longest I've ever seen! You can order by the glass as well. Just for fun, the most expensive bottle is $120K, so I'm coming back for it when I win Powerball tonight. 

We decided to order a variety of dishes, including the calamari, scallops, mascarpone and guanciale mashed potatoes, gnocchi with gorgonzola, arugula and figs, anolini with lobster and tarragon, spaghetti al frute di mare, short rib ravioli, and caprese salad.

Standouts for me included the calamari (lightly fried, with bell peppers, a unique version as compared to your usual deep-fried finger food), the mashed potatoes (incredible, and served with a poached egg on top), the ravioli, and the caprese salad (a unique, deconstructed version with fresh-pulled, delicious mozzarella and roasted tomatoes on the vine). I also really liked the spaghetti, which was full of huge, delicious, shrimp. The portions were very small for the prices, but we tried a little of everything, the dishes were well-executed, and that's fine dining for you!

The service here was top-notch. At times, we had fleets of servers coming to our table and they anticipated our needs and requests throughout the whole dinner.

One more thing that made it a fun dinner was that we were seated directly behind the huge bull statue near the entrance, and the bull was completely, generously, and graphically anatomically correct, which we thought was hilarious (especially after several glasses of wine). I couldn't look to the right side of my table without a peripheral view of balls in my face. Makes for some good photo ops.",QJW33YrUGp-wVMI8M5mObg,1,1,4,a7L7k-mwG7B7KFfEbTu1cA

Bison Carpaccio - was good, but only 6 or 8 SUPER thin splices for $18.  Barely felt like you ate anything.  It was good quality though.  Worth trying if you've never had it before, but you won't feel like you've eaten anything.
Black fettucine - I don't know wtf is up with this dish.  It just wasn't good.  It had a seafood taste, but there was no seafood in it.  Maybe it was black because of squid ink?  i have no clue, but I wouldn't order this again.
Dry-Aged Bone In Rib-Eye - It's a really really fatty piece of meat, not what I was expecting.  We order it medium-rare but it was pretty much rare, so the fat hadn't really softened enough to melt into the meat.  While the consistency was good and juicy, the meat seemed to have lots of tendons, which totally took away from the experience.  Maybe cooking it more would have softened them up a bit.

Finally, our waiter was kind of a dick.  Someone in our party ordered an extra rib-eye by accident because the menu says for 2, so he said for 2 after he ordered, but the watier thought he meant 2.  It was okay because we split among 8 ppl anyways, but the waiter didn't even acknowledge the mistake or try to help us out.",t76Rs-fgL1uD422d77PL1g,0,0,2,3x85jNF2AHzxmY6-wI0A8Q

Our server, Mike, was really nice and helpful. There was a guy helping him too...Jordan I think, also really nice. Not pushy or overbearing just good, friendly service. 

The black fettuccine with the crab meat and shallots is a good appetizer. The portions are small (two of us shared) but it's ok not to eat too much pasta people... especially when you're going to stuff steak in your pie hole too. My fillet was delicious and we got some sauces to share. I recommend the Gorgonzola marscapone, it's thick like cream cheese but delicious if you put it on your steak while it's still hot. The side of mushrooms was perfect size for two people. We also shared dessert...the honey panna cotta with pear sorbetto which was a nice lighter choice after all of that other food.

Carnevino Restaurant
Richard Douglas/General Manager

Dear Mr. Douglas,

My fiance and I decided to try Carnevino because one, I love Mario Batali and two, we enjoy trying new places.  It was also his 39th birthday and I decided to take him somewhere fancy.  I wanted to express my sentiments in writing so that you may get a full understanding of our dining experience.

First off, the bar service was awesome.  I had one Greyhound and I was tipsy.  Thankfully, the bartender gave me a great drink for a great price of $15.  If you want a better variety of patrons, you may consider dropping some of your drink prices.  Las Vegas being a tourist town, it's hard to enjoy a drink if you are paying through the nose.  Not to mention, it's not like he used Grey Goose, Russo-Baltique, Belvedere or Oval.  He used Kettle One. Sorry, that's not a $15 drink.

We were excited to try the food since I reviewed the menu prior to making the reservation.  I already knew that we would not be eating steak even though Carnevino is a ""Steak House"" type restaurant simply because I refuse to pay $72 per person just for rib-eye, when I can get a great steak at Maggiano's for a much reasonable price.  Plus, my guy and I are not big meat eaters.  Before I get to the food aspect of my letter, I wanted to talk about your staff.  We had two waiters:  Marco and Danielle.  We loved Danielle.  She was the type of person you could have sitting at your table like she was an old friend.  Her energy and knowledge of food preparation and description of items was awesome.  I felt like we belonged there and she made us feel very welcomed.  Then, there was Marco.  Marco reminded me of those European waiters who has been serving people in fine restaurants for probably over 15 years.  He personally made me feel like I was not good enough to eat at your restaurant.  It's a feeling I have experienced before and it certainly is very disappointing especially when I knew that our dinner would be pricey.  I expected better service and frankly, my fiance felt the same way.  If it weren't for Danielle, we would have left upon being seated.

As a starter we ordered the fried calamari which was amazing.  I also loved the bread and topping options.  I am a little bit of a risk taker, more so than my fiance and I decided on trying the Roasted Quail.  We enjoyed our vegetable selection of Italian broccoli with roast pork,  fried eggplant and the best mashed potatoes we have ever had.  Now comes the fun part: the bird.  The quail smelled like wet dog and I tried it, just once.  I was polite and asked Danielle to remove it from my table because it actually made me nauseaous.  I am sure that it was cooked the way it should be but the reality is, not everyone has the same palate.  Chef's take the kind of thing personally so I assured the manager and everyone else that it was nothing the chef did.  I simply did not want it.  If it was New York pigeon, I would have guessed that instead.  The manager was kind enough to bring me something else even though I was fine with paying for my quail.  We weren't looking for a free meal. 

I like it when wait-staff come to your table to check on you but Marco coming to our table a total of 9 times in 10 minutes was not needed.  It was as though he was checking to make sure that we had not left without paying.  Maybe the fact that my fiance and I are heavily tattooed, one might think that we must not have much money.  Afterall, it's not like tattoos are expensive, right?  I must not be employed to be able to wear a BCBG dress, have 70% of my body tattooed and manage to pay a $125 bill without blinking. My mistake.

We won't be returning.  Though we enjoyed the side options of the menu, the food overall was not what we expected.  The atmosphere was nice though you really need to consider a different option for music.  Not everyone likes the Rolling Stones, especially on repeat.  And have a chat with Marco about his demeanor.  Though I am sure because of his many years of experience as a waiter, he must assume that this equates the same for how you treat people.  I could stoop down to his level and say something like, ""Afterall, he is only just a waiter"" but then again, I am above that.  I respect people and respect what people do for a living.  Maybe one day, he will have a waiter quite like himself and remember that he serves the public, much like a janitor. 

Sincerely,

Ilene Huffman

P.S.  I find it amusing that some of your staff members have to wear a suit to pour water.  That's a bit much, don't you think?",hilL60vuuh06sMxs6Ckkog,3,0,2,wuuAXMqZIq1CsbRr5uNZ5w

The sides of spinach, mashed potatoes, and the asparagus were good but the butter that they serve with the bread is amazing!  Light, clean, and delicious.

Also got to try a piece of a buddy's lamb chop and that was spectacular.  Moist, juicy, tender lamb that had absolutely no gaminess whatsoever.  If i didn't know better i would have thought that i was eating an amazing cut of pork.

4820518,2017-08-11,0,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"Great super tasty sides, but absolutely terrible steak. And when you go to a Carnevino, you go for the steak not for the sides, hence the poor 1 star rating. In comparison, my Costco prime steaks are much tastier and tender than the supposed ""BBL"" steaks at Carnevino. I ordered the dry aged NY Strip, and to begin with the steak was not flavorful at all, and was also very tough, and twice came out under-cooked. I asked for medium rare, and what I got was walking/black & blue. Unacceptable! 

Dry aged to me means tender, and should not have required me to saw through my steak with a knife. The key effect of dry aging is the concentration and saturation of the natural flavour, as well as the tenderization of the meat texture. There was zero ""natural flavour""  and even less tenderization. Will I ever go back....NO! There are plenty of much better prime steak houses in Vegas. 

One suggestion, both Mario Batali and Joe Bastianich should spend a lot more time at this restaurant in order to ensure that the food is being cooked to the quality that they say one should expect Carnevino. I asked the manager how often Mario is in town, he said about 3-4 times per month. Mario, if this is true, then you need to spend a lot more time at this establishment.

4833336,2017-01-05,0,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"My boyfriend and I came here on Dec. 22. I ordered their special of beef cheek ravioli and he ordered a dry aged steak. I also ordered a caprese salad. They gave us some cheese balls (I don't know how else to describe it) and bread with butter and lard. They were both very yummy! The bread had rosemary in it so that was a nice touch. 

I'm not sure how I felt about the caprese. Don't get me wrong, all the ingredients were very fresh and flavorful but the way it was presented was odd. It was not a real salad in my opinion, just deconstructed ingredients to me. Pesto, cheese, and tomatoes. Perhaps I'm uncultured but 3 ingredients placed on a plate is not worth $25 to me. 

My bf's steak was interesting. The cut and ratio of pink was perfect. But I have to say, dry aged is not for everyone (and that's not anybody's fault!). I loved the crust on it but I found the meat itself to be a bit lacking. Almost bland. Also, there was a large amount of gristle on it as well. My boyfriend did like it better than me so different strokes I guess. The beef cheek ravioli was AMAZING. I have nothing bad to say about it. It was filling, reasonably priced and delicious.

The tomato mozzarella salad was awesome and a friend and I split the rib-eye for two which was $165 for about 32oz of meat including bone.  I have had better steak almost that size at Alfred's in SF for $65 so it was hard to justify the value here.  The sides we ordered with the steak were just ok and we were pretty stuffed.

We split Tartar (ok), Ravioli (great), Rib eye (ok), Short Rib (good) and a ""pay by the inch steak"" (which was one of the more impressive steaks I have ever had).  

Now to the bad.  We ordered three bottles of wine.  A white ($120), a barbaresco ($160) and 2005 brunello ($170) that the Somm recommended to go with the steak and short rib.   The white was fine, the barberesco was great, but the brunello was flat.  My girlfriend, who happens to be a certified Somm, asked the manager to taste the wine to see if he thought it was flat.  He responded by saying, "" you get what you pay for.""  

The second issue was with the pay by the inch steak.  It was wonderful and my mouth is watering a little bit just thinking about it.  Problem is, I didn't get to finish it.  The bus boy decided to clear the plates on his schedule.  I lost an inch and a half and some short rib on my plate.  He also cleared the center plate that had two slices of the steak left.  Terrible.  Didn't even ask the table if he should clear.

Carnevino will not get repeat traffic from me.  There are way too many great steakhouses in Vegas to ever eat there again.  For those who had read this far, try Sage at Aria.  Wonderful.  

Finally, shared our experience with friends back in LA.  They had similar stories.  Good food, bad experience.

4901547,2011-08-02,3,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"I was here with a large group for a dinner on Friday night.  We sat down and looked at the menus.  I was kinda thrown off of the price, however.  I did expect the quality and taste to match that of how much I was paying, so I grouped with a friend of mine and ordered the $80 porterhouse for 2, medium.

While waiting for the porterhouse, the bread and butter came out.  The standard butter was fine, but there was also a lardo spread that was offered as well.  I'm a fan of trying new things, but I really wasn't impressed by the lardo.  It smelled like an armpit, to be honest.  I was content with my boring butter.

The porterhouse came out, and I could understand why it was $80, due to how big the thing was.  After having a couple of bites, I found the cut to be pretty decent.  It was good for a porterhouse, but it was NOT worth paying $80 for 2, much less having to split the bill at $40 per person.

The service was probably the best part of the entire experience, but it wasn't as great as expected.  Our server was fairly knowledgeable of the dishes and the wine pairings, but really wasn't there a whole lot.  And for reference, the dinner service was at its end of the night anyway.

Overall, I thought the food was okay, but it really is overpriced and seemingly overrated at this point.  In this case, I had to pay to understand why.",bdZLmvZg7ibzD0YbLfru6A,1,0,2,69HOH1322Rjn0eD1Pv98Cg

We had friends from out of town and it was on their bucket list to try the dry aged T-bone steak. Well, we were a party of 4 and this place is on the upscale side. We pretty much had a little of everything including the dry aged T-bone. Honestly, the steak was delicious. Would I spend a pretty penny for it...probably not. Actually, the highlight for me was the tiramisu! For all the tiramisu fans, this is a must try. It was pretty legit! 

It was a fantastic dining experience, yet I felt it was overpriced for what we were getting. This dinner is more of a splurge. I would probably not make a repeat visit  and just check it off my list of Mario Batali restaurants I've dined at lol.",DaEuyn1GgLeZ3Jn-bcZnvA,0,0,4,Yyp23liQjkBuNx6_dnP74w

But it does get a bit busy here and without a reservation, we just hung out at the bar for a couple of hours enjoying some of their fine scotches. And they do have a lot to offer.

But drinking an excessive amount of scotch even before dinner started was a big mistake on my part, as I could not fully enjoy my steak for the evening. But for the limited times I did remember my dinner, I would say that the steak was nice and juicy. And they do live up to their prime grade and the fact that they actually cut the pieces in front of you definitely helped out a lot since cutting the pieces by myself would prove to be very difficult given that I was still inebriated from my drinks earlier.

The porter house for two is great for two people. But honestly, I think I can devour it myself. At $160, I was actually glad there was my cousin to help out.

But it didn't end there. We added some sides, dessert, and obviously some more drinks and we were stuffed.

4919270,2010-01-06,0,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"I read some of the reviews here and am quite surprised by some.... Since this is anonymous, I'll just lay it out there... I think most people who go to Vegas are from middle America (not that is bad, but its not sophisticated), have not had very much fine food, and just automatically think if an entree is $40 it must be good. 
This place is a typical in-casino high-priced food trap restaurant. They use a lame fancy-sounding name (""carnevino"" is like writing ""meatwine"") for the restaurant, and then charge high prices for entrees with simple but lesser heard Italian names, which most patrons have never had before in a really good place.
We had a small corporate dinner here tonight. Had the ny strip, next to me was the veal saltimbocca, and the lamb to my other neighbor, also ordered a number of sides, started with the ""insalata romana""  - ""their take on a Caesar salad"" as the waiter explained (which is not at all correct, that is a typical italian salad). The salad was good - for $16 it should have been. The $54 strip was horrid. Tough, overly salty, not cooked evenly. I avoided complaining - its just not worth hassling over it with morons who will tell you things like ""a strip is generally a little tougher sir"" etc - so why bother. It's Vegas. I know my meat - my family was ranchers, i am from Texas, and eaten at more expensive steak places than the waiter has heard of... whatever, not worth the conversation. The veal: not so good. Veal saltimbocca should not be overly dry, cooked almost like a pancake with the veal pieces sticking together. The lamb chops were whatever, blah. Could buy some at a grocery store and throw on the grill and they would be the same. Of course, most people have never grilled lamb chops, so they people probably think its good. Sides were all blase and greasy. They had some sauteed carrots which were almost burnt.

Maybe it was an off night, who knows.

As a positive, the head waiter was quite attentive, as was his staff of two. And everyone was very polite. ...As they should be for the mandatory 20% gratuity. 

If you want to play it safe, and need good beef in the fakest city in America, try Envy at the Renaissance near the Convention Center. Its over priced also, but it *is* really good. Also, there is a Captial Grill right off the strip which always does a good job. Those guys live off their food quality and reputation - not the fact they are a casino owned restaurant made to look like a good one, next to a bunch of loud slot machines.

(Just an update: I logged in to Yelp and glanced at old review, and realized I forgot to update this from years ago.  Both myself, and my friend who sat next to me got food poisoning that entire weekend - a day after eating here. I believe it was the tartar my jackass friend ordered and we both tried.

1.  Service - From the cocktail staff to the servers, everyone here is top notch. They know their menu and style very well.

2.  Meat - Not bad, it is elegantly produced and masterfully presented. We had the Bone in Rib Eye 3 months aged, and also 8 months aged.  These are servings for two.  They recommend it cooked medium rare. It was okay, I prefer a bit more of a tender texture and this was the right color and warmth, just a bit chewy.

3. Appetizers - Had the Orecchiette Pasta and the Calamari.  While a very small dish, it was fine since we had heaping plates of beef coming our way.  The Calamari was light and tasty.  the Pasta was very nice, however, the serving very, very small.

4.  Back to the meat - I have to say, for the price we paid, and the fact that this is a suggestion by the staff, I would say that this was not the best meat I have ever had.

5.  Vino - Nice huge selection and plenty of choices for the knowledgeable and plenty of raised eyebrows for the uninitiated!  We asked and got great suggestions for a reasonable price.

6.  Parties - This place is huge, and huge and even more huge. It goes on and on. Great for really large parties, however, it may not be private.

I do plan to come back and experience this again. I would still ask for the Rib eye and have it this time just ""pink"" rather than medium rare.

Came here for my birthday dinner while we were in Vegas and boy were we in for a treat! It's in the Palazzo Hotel, pretty easy to find.  We were seated across the way in a pretty private dining area.  The curtains were open at first and it was a bit awkward when people would walk by and stare so we decided to ask the waiter to close them.  We got the bone in 90 day aged rib eye for 2, beef cheek ravioli, spinach, and mashed potatoes.  

90 day aged rib eye for 2- So my all time favorite is Ruth's Chris Steakhouse's Rib eye because its packed with flavor and cooked perfectly.  Our waiter informed us that their steaks are cooked a little raw so their medium rare is rare, medium is medium rare.. etc.  I'm a person who believes anything above medium ruins the steak but I know I know we all have our preferences.  Anyways, they bring the steak to the table and carve the entire piece for you.  Everything is PACKED with flavor because of the amazingly marbled cut.  I was trying to convince myself that Ruth's Chris was still the best rib eye I have ever had but sadly I think I have a new BEST.  It's sad because they only have this in Vegas ! All in all, don't come here without trying the rib eye.

Beef Cheek Ravioli- AMAZING, this was their specialty pasta for the day.  For those of you that do not know what beef taste like.. the flavor is packed because its a fatty area and very soft texture. Just plain buttery goodness!  

The sides- Honestly I was took focused on my steak to even think about it. But I do remember not being a fan of the mashed potatoes, they were just too watery.

My wife and I have frequented this place since it opened bring many friends over the years. Our last visit was bad. I took the time to email the GM being very fair in asking him to look into what happened. After waiting for 2 days not knowing if he received my request his response fell short just like the service did from his staff and assistant manager. 
We will NEVER go back and suggest the same to you.
FYI - we once had a similar experience at Truluck's in San Diego - an upscale steak and seafood restaurant - when I brought it to the attention of the GM - Todd Perry - he quickly took the bull by the horns and corrected the issues and won me over to be his biggest fan. That took professionalism and hard work - both that I don't see at Carnevino.
Here we go...
Below is my email to General manager of CarneVino Carlon Kira followed by his weak response:

Mr. Kira

Would you mind looking into something for me please?

We are big fans of your restaurant. We live in San Diego and we come to Las Vegas a lot. For many years. We've been eating in your restaurant.

We had a reservation under Eileen Pelky yesterday for 830pm. Party of four.

We got there at 8 PM. I told the hostess that I knew that we were early that we would be in the bar.  She asked me not to go far because she said reservations were running on time.

At 9 o'clock and went back to that same hostess. I said I thought you told me that reservations are running on time? She just stared at me. Along with two others that were just leaning against the counter.

Next thing I know another hostess came into the bar and got our party and seated us.

Waiter was very nice. We asked to talk to a manager.  Manager Sean came over. He explained that there were some sort of mixup at the hostess stand. He asked if he could bring a couple of appetizers. I told him we knew what we wanted and preferred to proceed with what we ordered.

We eventually ordered. Restaurant was not very busy. Please check that. The salad took a while to come out. But it did.

The problem started when the appetizers took what seemed like forever to come out. I went looking for a manager or somebody. Couldn't find anybody. Finally someone from the waitstaff sent over a manager named Christina.

I explained to Christina that it seems like way too long to get the next course everybody was hungry. Our waitstaff was nowhere to be found.

Expected her to come back and explain to me what's going on.  She never said she was sorry. Instead, she sent the waiter. And he was a little hot and upset.  Me, trying to defuse the situation. Said that reasonable people can disagree but we felt it just took way too long to get that next course.

Why didn't Christina come back and speak with me instead of creating a confrontation with the waiter. Very uncomfortable for the table. I mean very.

I asked one of the waitstaff to ask Christina to come back and speak with me. I politely asked her why she didn't come back to me and why did she send the waiter that turned out to be upset and create a confrontation?

She had no viable excuse.

Towards the end of the meal I was trying to find Sean the regional manager as he seemed reasonable.  I was told he went home for the night.

We never saw our waiter again. Christina presented our check.

My friend, at the very least, this was good representation of how most of your fine employees present their service.

Would you mind looking into this? Please look at our reservation timeline. Verify what I said.

We think a lot of your restaurant but I must say that it was a tough evening and our friends were left with a very bad taste in their mouth.

My cell is XXX XXX-XXXX. We are guests of The Palazzo checking out tomorrow.

By the way, Angel the bus person was amazing!!!! Gracious and great to be around.

Thank you,

His response:

Greetings Mr. XXXXX and thank you for your email.  My apologies for not getting back to you sooner, but I wanted to do a thorough investigation of what happened on your evening.

There was some definite miscommunication on our part at the hostess stand when you arrived, our hostess was under the impression that you wanted to have a drink at the bar and you would check back in when you wanted to get seated.  I don't know if she was just flustered or she forgot, but a definite mistake on our part.

I also spoke with Kristina & Bryan about the delay in food and Kristina went to the kitchen to investigate what the delay was and asked Bryan to make sure you were okay.  Bryan also stated that he was not upset at any point, but concerned with the situation.  I understand if that was the perception, but I assure you that was not the intent.

---- I will not go back. Nor will I recommend the many groups I know to go back either.",AERnTnf3K7Yx4xIvEJrvtQ,1,0,2,uJ_1toWWiQgApyfZAQXK-g
4958294,2015-05-06,1,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"It's been nearly 2.5 years since my first review of Carnevino, so I thought it was high time for an update.  I would give this place 6 stars if I could.  It boggles my mind that it has a 3.5 star rating, it is a unique steak experience that does everything right.

I prefer to sit in the wine room, or cave.  The ceiling is lower, it has a nice cozy feel to it.  On this trip, there were 5 of us dining.   Carnevino's wine list is not enormous, but it's daunting enough that I like to speak with the somm before we start eating.  I've never, and I mean NEVER, been given a bad wine here.  The somms listen and always give you exactly what you want.  I tend to stick to Italian bottles here.  

To start, we went with the beef cheek ravioli.  This stuff is not on the menu, but they can always make it.  It's fantastic, we ordered 2 servings of it.  The pasta is handmade, the sauce is delicate and the filling is tender and extremely flavorful.  I order this stuff every time.  Additionally, we had the steak tartare, which I'd not had in a few years at Carnevino.  Again, it was a slam dunk.  This place knows its beef.  The seasoning was spot on, it literally couldn't have been more precise.  The mouth feel was smooth, not off putting at all.  The beef is clearly of fantastic quality.  Topped with raw mushroom, it was a hit with all at the table.

To eat, we went with some shared entrees:  the porterhouse for 2 (dry aged 4 months), the ribeye for 2, ragu pasta, and the linguini fini (served with crab, jalapeno, and cipollini).  On the side we went with the seasonal broccoli and the potatoes, which are a must.  Don't think I've eaten here and not ordered the mashed potatoes.

The beef is carved tableside and drizzled with olive oil and sea salt.  It's not heavily seasoned, but the olive oil and salt add enough to the beef so that you know they're there without overpowering it.  Both were a perfect medium rare.  My favorite was the strip side of the porterhouse.  The dry aging comes through, it's such an intense beef flavor.  Of the pastas, the linguini fini was one of the best pastas I've ever had.  It was spicy, but not too spicy.  They take you just to the brink of pain in your mouth without going over that edge.  It's incredible, it was exactly the right amount of heat.  

I always enjoy after dinner drinks at Carnevino, they have a large selection of coffees, ports, and scotches.  This place gets better each time I come back.  It's why I ate here several times when I was a local, and come in each time I have visited since.  Can't recommend this place enough.  If beef and red wine for dinner is your thing, you can't go wrong here.",JXHrhT72U6sZJQSkFfNzjw,2,2,5,5CprIdzXkbWGGKNpl8MWSw

We started with two pasta dishes, as appetizers, the first a penne pasta with homemade Italian sausage and marinara sauce....delicious.  Pasta, al dente and huge chunks of fresh made sauage with great seasoning in a rich tomato sauce. Then the black  squid ink linguine with fresh crab in a white wine/herb sauce....melt in your mouth delicious!!  Next came the fresh tuna tartar.....it was so good, I ordered a second portion!!   Fresh, cool to the palate with a touch of wasabi and balsamic dressing...outrageous.  And then....the ribeye steak....cut it with a fork, cooked perfectly medium rare, the rub was outstanding and the taste....great.

4968889,2011-05-06,1,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"Pasta:
Whoever said there was no flavor might be lacking some taste buds because the flavor was all there. I wanted to slurp the whole bowl into my mouth at once. You can't go wrong with any of the pasta's because they're fresh made, and it's apparent! They claim the pasta is Batalli's forte. It's too bad it is so ridiculously expensive and portions are tiny. I only tried it because we had a vegetarian at the table (oops, my bad for choosing a steakhouse on our last night!).

Meat:
My. God. Rib. Eye. SO GOOD! This is the first time I have been impressed by meat in Vegas. Especially because I've made my rounds to steakhouses like Craft, I had my doubts given this place had a half star less. No.. it is so delicious, you must come here for the meat.

Sides:
So the mashed potatoes with egg didn't blow me away, but it was still good. I was actually a little nauseated by the complimentary focaccia with ""emulsified"" (read: mushy) lard. We opted for the italian broccoli with pork belly (tastes like bacon!), and they can make this vegetarian if desired (don't know who in their right mind would want to do that). Sides aren't that big but they're unnecessary because the meat is enough to really tide you over.

Service:

My girl got a pasta something around 5oz or so and she paid like $20 for it which was utterly ridiculous. Adding $15 would have given her a dinner portion.... 

I ordered the Ribeye aged 90-days. To be honest it wasn't as good as I'd hoped. It lacked a bit of flavor and all I could taste was the rubbery meat which was un-Ribeye like. 

Maybe I'll go here ONE more time. It could have just been a fluke but I refuse to believe this was the Carnevino experience....",nJzPqTvckM4G5LkR1eCxRw,1,0,3,M92XEaMmS7qEDTWA_VnOMw
4975477,2015-11-06,0,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"Carnevino Italian Steakhouse at The Palazzo is located just off the casino floor towards the bridge walkway to The Venetian! As with all major Las Vegas hotels, there are ample parking in the hotel parking lot, either by valet or self-park.

The Palazzo being a 5-star in my book, this restaurant does not disappoint! As with most restaurants in the upscale 4-5 star rated hotels, this restaurant is beautifully designed! This is a very elegant, very classy, upscale restaurant, which rates amongst the best Italian steak houses I have ever experienced! A true dining experience!  The dishes are priced on the higher end ($$$$), but  this is not your typical steakhouse! Our bartender/server Adam, explained the aging process of the beef in such detail! Thank you Adam, for taking the time to educate us! Carnevino features the highest quality of meats, complimented by a wide array of side dishes!

For starters, I ordered the Dungeness crab carbonara with guanciale and scallion! This is one of the best carbonaras I have ever experienced! It was not overwhelmingly rich like some carbonara, but satisfying to your taste buds! The dish was neither small nor large, just enough to prepare you for your main entree!

For my main entree, I was undecided between the Lamb Chops Scottadita or the Braised short rib al Barolo with celery root purre'. I wanted both (hehe), but knew that would just be too much! I decided to go with the Braised Short Ribs! It was so tender and juicy that I did not even need my knife to cut through it! You could just use your fork and it would melt!l and fall apart!

To compliment the Braised Short Ribs, I ordered the Saut√©ed mixed mushrooms with spring onions on the side! The mushrooms were soft, sweet and buttery! Yummy!

For dessert, I ordered the Pumpkin spice tiramisu with a caramel date sauce and bourbon cream (On the menu it is called Passito di Pantelleria, Donnafugata ""Ben Rye"" 2013. I have had Tiramisu before, but never a pumpkin spice tiramisu! This was really good! A change up from your classic tiramisu.

For an after dinner drink, I ordered a Belgium Gulden Draak Ale to go with dessert. It was a nice change up since I had several glasses of Cabernet Sauvignon during dinner.

Since this is an Italian Steakhouse, if you are not a ""carnivore"", this restaurant does offer alternatives from a nice selection of fish and poultry ....... to name a few

Service was exceptional, a 5-star experience! Thank you again, Adam! I will surely be back here next time I am in Las Vegas!",ACevyfccyNxXntWld8hvmg,3,0,5,cnitxBpv0vJWAK2Om0hYKg
4989567,2017-08-06,0,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"Carnevino was the restaurant we chose for our big date night out while on vacation in Vegas. It ended up being the perfect choice for the night we had envisioned. The meal was absolutely delicious and worth the $200 price tag for two. 

We ordered the prosciutto di parma which was hands down the best proscuitto we have ever had anywhere outside of Italy. It also didn't hurt that it was served with melon slices and warm parmesan popovers which the waiter offered to covered with even more fresh parmesan. Yum!

My fiance enjoyed the dry aged New York strip steak, which ended up being a ribeye because of how big this particular cut was. It was served with a drizzle of olive oil and melted in your mouth. 

I ordered an off the menu pasta with truffle shavings, butter and summer squash and it was one of the most delicious fresh pasta dishes I have ever had. I was so pleasantly surprised because I figured I wouldn't have as great a meal because I didn't want to go for steak -- at a steak restaurant. But it turned out to be an excellent choice.

The only two things we ordered that didn't wow me were the Italian broccoli with garlic and pork and the ciabatta with pork lard. I need to stress these were definitely good, but our other dishes were better and I am glad I didn't fill up on the side or the bread because I just enjoyed the entrees so much and wanted room for dessert, which was epic.

We enjoyed the bomboloni (warm beignet-like dessert, covered in brown sugar and fresh peaches and blackberries). An excellent way to end a perfect meal.

The pasta dishes were definitely homemade and the steaks were wonderful, cooked well and melted in your mouth. Yes, this was an expensive dinner, but we all felt it was well worth it.

5013802,2013-10-28,0,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"Setting / Ambiance was excellent. High ceilings, great decor, perfect lighting. Impressive.

Service: Overall except, instead of the ""how is everything"" drop-by, ask specifically whether the steaks are cooked to your liking, etc.

Apps / bread: fantastic. Except, the server indicated the portions are good for sharing. Hmm...not really. 

Wine: Wow, sensory overload but you can find something you like based on region and price point. 

Side dishes: Just okay. Actually, not good. The brussel sprouts were overcooked, dry and charred. The mashed potatoes were good (the drop a poached egg on it). Fries were dry and overcooked also.

Main meal:  Interesting disclaimer by the server: ""We cook our steaks one degree rarer than normal. If you like your steaks medium, we suggest ordering medium well.""  I simply can't understand the logic here. I thought steak temps were universal?  Obviously, not here. Anyway, we do as the server suggest. Except when the 16 oz NY Strip arrives, it is rare to medium rare.  We wanted medium and asked for medium-rare.  Between 3 guys, we ordered the bone-in veal chop ($85) and the dry aged bone-in ribeye ($144).  The veal chop was stupendous. The most expensive item on the menu - the bone-in ribeye was borderline awful. We ordered it medium (because we wanted it medium rare) and it came out borderline rare.  Everyone at the table tried it and agreed that each bite took too much effort.  It's taken me less time to finish a 12oz sirloin at Outback than to finish of 3 bites of this steak.  I simply do not understand how you can spend so much on a steak and be disappointed.  But it happened.  

There you go...over-rated and expensive.  I don't mind spending that much for a meal...but it has to be worth it.  Recommendation to my fellow Yelpers....go elsewhere.",FbZ0aJU5saPyHYDHI-nXKg,0,0,3,-8QOUM86hoSh7mPeF-l_eA
5022919,2016-07-20,3,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"No guys' trip to Vegas would be complete without a good steak dinner.  After falling short on my previous dinner pick, my friends kept the faith and let me make the call for dinner on our last night in town.  My choice was Carnevino.  We didn't have reservations, but we decided to see if we could be seated.  Mind you, it was a Sunday night around 8 pm, so we thought our chances were good.  While it may not always be the case, it wasn't a problem on this night and we were seated immediately.  We looked over the menu, but with it being our last night celebration, we quickly agreed to do the Beef Tasting Menu, which really was the only way to go to fully experience everything Carnevino had to offer.   If you decide to have wine with this tasting menu, you really should do it with the selected pairings.  Yes, it was a very pricey meal.  However, it all becomes a bit more affordable when your team beats the spread.

Our 6-course meal started off with Carne Cruda, a chopped to order steak tartare.  Next came Dry-Aged New York Carpaccio followed by the pasta course, Tagliatelle Bolognese, and then Veal Tongue in Brodo.  For our main course, we received the BBL Dry-Aged Bone-In Ribeye, which was sliced off the bone and prepared tableside.  We ended our meal with a Honey Panna Cotta.  I'd had Carnevino's tasting menu with my wife on my one previous visit.  That was an excellent experience, but this one surpassed that by a wide margin.  Each of our courses was flavorful, tender, and beautifully presented.  The wine pairings were a perfect marriage of food and wine that gave me a chance to taste styles of wines and varietals that I either hadn't tried before or hadn't tried paired with certain foods before.  The difference-maker?  The bone-in ribeye.  It was an impressive cut of meat made even more special with its uber-long dry aging process (I think our waiter said over 90 days!) and the tableside preparation, which was the highlight of an already top-notch service experience.

Like its steaks, Carnevino really has only gotten better with age.  It isn't for everyone or for every occasion.  For me, it really was an outstanding experience and a perfect capstone to a vacation with great friends.  I highly recommend.",le3Xn9Mheb1hNxWurF7RSw,3,4,5,CnzHB4zzTBJiSh4MLW5LXA
5024945,2016-05-08,1,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"Carnevio is one of the few places I have a love-hate relationship with. I've been to Canevino several times, primarily for their riserva steak aged to 240 days. I've also been to B&B (Vegas), Lupa (NYC) Babbo (NYC) and Del Posto (NYC). Those experiences have always been positive. Unlike those, Canevino's staff, primarily the host's station has a poor attitude problem. I've had a 7:00PM reservation for 2. I arrived at 7PM and was told that they're ""running behind"" and that my table will be ready in 15-20 minutes. Keeping busy for 15-20 minutes in the Venetian is an easy undertaking. I came back at 7:20PM and was told to wait a bit. I waited until 7:30PM and was told again that they need 15 minutes or so. Keep in mind that A) Carnevio has been open since 2008 and is owned by Mario Batali and Joe Bastianich. Not having a table ready AND not being comped with a drink or alike is inexcusable for a $$$ establishment. Then there's B) This has been the third or fourth time this has occurred to me over the past couple of years. I am a fan of Mario Batali's fair, but unfortunately won't be a patron there any more.

I can understand overbooking. I can accept a delay. I cannot accept the arrogance and ""ef you"" attitude that I've been made to feel these recent times. On a positive note, I went to Wolfgang Puck's CUT, where I had a foodgasmic experience.",P3adlfsGSEpijivP_TgiUg,8,1,1,EqPYN6xk584HYTR3lH0wtA

5037560,2011-04-11,0,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"My husband and I dined at CarneVino last night as part of a Vegas weekend that was a belated celebration of my 40th birthday. This was our second time dining at CarneVino and while the food was fantastic again on our second visit, the service wasn't and I doubt we'll go back. I expect exceptional service when I'm dining at a restaurant created / owned by Mario Batali that prides itself on sourcing only the best ingredients and wines. I also expect exceptional service when my meal (for two of us) is going to cost at least $300, if not more. 

This being said, we experienced exceptional service to start with - I had a million questions for our primary waiter regarding various items on the menu and spent a fair amount of time getting his recommendations - which didn't disappoint. The lobster appetizer is great but not as great as the one that was served not long after the restaurant opened, It would also be helpful for the menu to list that the sashimi portion of the lobster appetizer is served on top of a sauce of cream, horseradish, lemon juice and chives - I loved the sauce but my husband did not and had we known about the sauce, we would have asked for the dish without it. The beef cheek ravioli with a butter sauce and 25 year aged balsamic vinegar is to die for - if I could eat that every day, I would. My husband had the bone in NY Strip which had fabulous flavor although I think he felt that navigating around the bone was a lot of work. I had the striped bass (I know, it's a steak restaurant but I needed something not as heavy) with a spring vegetable puree, artichoke hearts and pea tendrils - it was also gorgeous. We picked two sides - the mascarpone and guanciale mashed potatoes which are sinful and wonderfully satisfying - they come with a poached egg that is broken and stirred in - delicious! The second side was the roasted beets with gorgonzola, also delicious. 

Back to the service - once we received our entrees the service staff vanished. Not very far into our entrees we both wanted to order another drink but no one came to check on us. Finally with more than half of our entrees consumed we were asked if we would like another drink and we ordered. The drinks only arrived some time after we had finished our entrees. We let the drink servers (who were completely new to our table) know that we wouldn't be needing the drinks. Our primary waiter showed back up a little while later and gave us a halfhearted apology and that was that. No apology from the manager, no discount to our check, nothing. And mind you, we weren't looking for a discount but on principle there should have been some sort of apologetic gesture. Had there been any kind of gesture we would have increased our gratuity significantly - having worked in the service industry and event industry for many years I have a very hard time ever leaving less than 20%, even when I haven't been blown away (more fool me, perhaps). 

On exiting the restaurant we walked by a woman who I guessed to be the manager. I stopped and asked if she was, and she confirmed that she was. I relayed our experience and she did give us what we felt was a very genuine apology, although it will be interesting to see if she spends the time to track us down via OpenTable to send us an email to ask us to give CarneVino another chance. 

The bottom line, I think, is that team service is not always an effective way to serve your dining customers - unless your team is staffed appropriately and magnificent at working together to serve multiple tables. I would guess that our primary waiter thought that the rest of his team was taking care of us and had no idea that they weren't. And when a restaurant is busy and the primary waiter has a number of tables of varying sizes, I would guess there is virtually no way to ensure that all of the diners are getting exceptional service throughout their meal. 

For our money we're looking for exceptional food AND service, so we'll probably go elsewhere the next time we're in Vegas.",z5O9EFydCgkdodGeSOndfw,0,0,2,JNB9z0JhdfyfInl-ABuz8A

We also had the dry-aged ribeye steak for two. The server clarified that the steak price - at the time of our dining 2 for $76 - was $76 per person, so it was a $152 steak. I think that's a bit misleading on the menu, but okay, I get it. We ordered it anyway and while it was a good steak, I don't think it was a $152 steak. We had the grilled asparagus which was perfectly executed and I would definitely recommend. 

Although the wine list was extensive - even including Slovenian wines which we rarely see in the states (and had just come back from Slovenia a week prior), the least expensive wine on the list was $75. Depending on your tastes and how much you want to drink, it might make more sense to order from the selection of wines by the glass. If I were to go again, I think I'd make a meal out of appetizers and pasta and skip the entrees.

The atmosphere is pure steak house with the Sommelier station right in the middle of the dinning room where we were seated (more on that later).  Our server was knowledgeable and friendly. He had many suggestions based on our feedback. 

The wine list is extensive and we ordered a nice Cab. For mains we each had the same-Filet Mignon (no bone) which was very good. The highlight for me was the mashed potatoes with egg. I could have consumed 2 or 3 of them. It was just a perfect combination and piping hot. I'm hungry now just writing about it!

For dessert I ordered the chocolate and peanut butter torte. It was fine but not great. My double espresso was outstanding.

One thing bothered me a bit most of the evening. I watched the Sommelier and his assistants (they were right in front of our table) spend a lot of time preparing many wines for the tables around us. They seemed to almost overdue it. They would pour a very small amount in each glass and coat the entire glass with it then pour it out. They would often light a match under the bottle (to look for sediment?). It almost seemed contrived to the point it did annoy me. Hey-in Vegas I guess you're supposed to put on a show.

I didn't want to be ""that guy"" but the overhead music was Pearl Jam, a group which i don't personally care for and even if i did, it doesn't really fit as steakhouse music.  It was explained to us (More on this later) that Mario Batali prefers to rock out when he cooks so we are experiencing a meal as we would in his kitchen.  They switched it up to a favorite band of our bachelor group for a song or two and the music was better from there on out.  When i think steak and a good meal, it doesnt involve Eddie Vedder wailing and whining.  

If this is your Schtick, then you had better execute the hell out of it and the food had better be flawless..  

I am not a big eater so the Strip was more than enough for me. I was fine with the doneness but for $61 the steak had zero flavor and as far as i could tell wasn't even salted or peppered. As other Yelpers have noted, the knives were dull so i had to murder my steak to try to enjoy it. It was impossible to remove from the bone. 
As for sides, the asparagus was okay. It was asparagus.  The spinach had a nice spice and flavor to it and the egg and marscapone mashed potatoes was pretty unappetizing as for me the flavors just didn't work.
Ordered a bottle of wine (got charged for two) and i was offered to look at the bottle. Our server then whisked away and poured it into 5 glasses across the room (we only had 3 wine drinkers). It was just awkward. 
The food was nothing remarkable and for the price of about $200-250/head easy, was pretty forgettable. Our table stayed dirty for 20 mins after our plates were cleared while we waited to settle the bill.  

I get the laid back, fun vibe they are trying so hard to create but it doesn't fit the decor at all. It is no excuse for pretty basic service errors and average food.

I have been meaning to try Carne Vino since I'm a huge fan of Osteria Mozza & Pizzeria Mozza. I came with a big appetite and great foodie friends.

I must say that the filet and strip were much better cuts compared to the ribeye. This is coming from someone who LOVES ribeyes, bone-in none the less!!! Definitely not worth the price. 

Some noteworthy side dishes include:

Beef cheek ravioli, Insalata Caprese & seasoned black truffle pasta.

To start off, the bread and butter were simply delicious. I ordered the cannelleno pasta (w/duck and cheese) - it was super good! B ordered the steak and eggs - he swears it's one of the best steak & eggs he's ever eaten. The steak and eggs were cooked perfectly, and the accompaniments (potatoes and arugula) went well. B's parentals got the ribs (just okay), beef carpachio (good) and the pastrami sandwich (yum). The end of the meal neared and they brought out gelato (vanilla, chocolate, espresso) and sorbet (blood orange, pear, peach) on the house! Apparently the whole computer/register system was down, so they were trying to bide some time for it to get fixed - a nice touch to a potential bad situation. The blood orange sorbet and chocolate gelato were superb. An excellent meal, indeed!",ujNqx9pVg61xiCFcG35RAg,2,1,4,xHoctSunMjvNwJt2SONbMg

It, along with its sister eatery B&B Ristorante are the only two truly authentic Italian eateries in Vegas.  So authentic, you can put away your passport and save the seven dime RT airfrre.

It's hard to resist the steaks, but needing something lighter, the pastas are outstanding.  The Bucatini all'Amatriciana, with its chunks of porky guanciale, pork fat and sweet, ripe tomato sauce lovingly enveloping toothsome bucatini, residual sauce begging to be mopped up by some bread, the only preparation to come close to what I enjoyed in Rome.  The best part, pay a few buck less, get a bit more here than at B&B for the same dish.

More contemporary?  The ricotta and duck egg raviolo, sublime.  A single raviolo dressed in brown butter, cut it open, the yolk spills out and coats everything.  Beautiful chew of the pasta, hint of cheesy tartness and loads of yolky, creamy goodness.

The artichoke agnolotti, stunning.  Delicate pouches of tender artichoke and creamy, salty ricotta.  Deep fried slivers of artichoke add just the right amount of texture and bitterness.

For starters, the fried calamari remains the best I've ever had.  Uber tender, flavor of the sea, the lightest crisp batter and a pickled hot pepper marina that will have you begging for more.  Do try the affettati misti, a selection of house cured salumi.  Batali is well known for his cured goodies.  The grilled octopus, thick and tender, perfectly charred with pickled veg that goes brilliantly with a sauce of sweet, citrusy limoncello.  The ultimate sweet sour concoction.  

I have talked about the steaks in previous reviews including a description of the riservas.  Know what you're about to sink your teeth into:
 
(1)  all are USDA Prime, natural, hormone free
(2)  if designated 'dry aged', average is 90 days
(3)  all are rubbed with ROSEMARY which imparts a great aroma and boosts perceived sweetness.  

The dry aged bone in ribeye is outstanding.  Well trimmed, cooked perfectly rare as ordered, not as juicy as a lesser aged counterpart, but still tender, the residual fat has a pronounced aged funk, the flesh itself, complex beef flavor finishing with nutty, bleu cheese notes.  Umami punches you in the face.  If dry aged complexity isn't your thing, try the Florentine porterhouse.  Although thinner and not as beefy as that in Tuscany, plenty good.  Cooked to temp.

Prefer mild beef flavor, the veal chop is excellent.  Humanely raised (natural, pasture rearing), this veal has a mild beef flavor.  The porcini rub adds flavor and fills the umami void.  Finally, do not pass on the sweetbreads.  Sunchoke and crispy artichokes, mild offal flavor, oh so satisfying.

Very good Italian centric wine list.  Many wines by the glass.  High resort markup.  Do be sure to sample the many Amaro.

Stop in for a few negroni with an antipasti or for an entire meal, Carnevino continues to impress.",oeAhRa8yFa9jtrhaHnOyxQ,23,25,5,grvMJIv-Vuy0SL4vbsVN1w

When everyone in our party arrived, we followed someone to our table. There were 8 of us, so we got this semi-private booth, which we liked. The ambience was dim and semi-quiet, although I felt like our group was being the complete opposite. We couldn't suppress our laughter. Opps, sorry. 

They gave us complimentary piece of bread with 2 spreads, regular butter and one made out of pork fat. I started with their INSALATA CAPRESE ($21 - candied tomatoes, burrata, and basil), but I wish they put a slice of fresh tomatoes instead. The burrata on the other hand was perfect!

My entree was an appetizer portion size of a vegetarian version of their PAPPARDELLE ($22, but for main course add $37), which took me about 10 bites to eat. I was glad to have some mushroom pieces with each bite. Great dish, but the top the dish seemed a little dry, possibly from sitting under the warmer a little too long.

And you can't forget about their wine. They have a TON of wine selections. We ordered 2 red wines, the LA MOZZA ""ARAGONE"" 2006 and the Primitivo, Primaterra 2009. They really know their stuff here.

We were the second table seated last Wednesday. Seated in the giant main area at a table right by the bar. The place has no warmth, its am impressive room but way to big for me and lacking any sustainable character.  As usual with Vegas hostess seats us with no menu.  Waiter comes with menus, many menus, three to be exact. one big one, one with specials, one with other specials.  Asks the typical tap or bottled water question and no drink order. Ok, no big deal.   Comes back after 15 minutes or so, really? place is not busy yet, its maybe 5:15.  takes our order.  Bread comes, its a ciabatta, two spreads, one a rendered pork fat and one butter.  Bread is average, fat is always good.   We start with the Gnocchi,  Strike one.  Bland sauce, bland presentation. You sure your Italian Mario?   Next we split the arugula salad, not bad but nothing to write home about either.  Main courses are Saltimbocca for me and a filet for my wife with a add on of a $44 dollar lobster tail.   Strike two on the Saltimbocca, i love this dish normally everywhere. Overdone, bland, very salty, presentation three medallions  on a plate that is it. Wish i took a picture. The chefs must have phoned it in that night. The filet, below average. Not a good cut of meat , which surprised me as this was touted as a great steakhouse.   That was strike three.   We did get a mashed potato side, which was more of a puree. Decent. Tough to mess up potatoes, lots of butter, and an egg. But somehow this mess was the only bright start because the others were so lacking in shine. 

Waiter seemed bored to be there, check came to well over $200 bucks, I still tipped the 20% as it is the holidays and well maybe the main staff was in italy on mario's estate learning all the good things the restaurant has to offer that others have written about.

Our server, Michael, was professional and knowledgeable and the pacing was perfect. The sommelier on the other hand was just ""ok"". For $50 corkage, I guess I expected a little more service in addition to the accoutrements. She poured at the right time, she did give us the correct glassware, decanted and everything but she really didn't say much. I was expecting for her to at least give us a menu recommendation that will compliment the wine and highlight the food the restaurant has to offer.

THE SETTING. It was grand and luxurious. Yes, there was ""rock"" music playing. Not my preference but it wasn't that loud so it didn't really bother me. I just thought the music didn't quite match the atmosphere.

THE WINE. Carnevino has an impressive wine list but wildly expensive so we brought our own bottle. (We brought one of our favorites, 97 Mondavi To Kalon, which of course was not on their list.)

THE FOOD. Everything was delicious and perfectly prepared. Starting with an amuse of ""cheese puff"" from the chef. Then the rosemary ciabatta bread served with the savory ""lardo"" spread.  We started with orders of Beef Carpaccio, Raviolo Di Stracotto (Duck liver & balsamic vinegar) and Arugula salad w/Coach Farm triple goat cheese, trumpet royale mushrooms, & onion pickles. For our main course, we had Veal Sweetbread Primavera, Black Fettuccine with crab, jalapenos & shallots, ""fall off the bone"" Osso Buco Alla Milanese, saffron orzo & gremolata and 8 oz Aged Filet Mignon with Porcini Bearnaise. I thought the Osso Buco could use a tad more flavor but it was good, nonetheless. Then we ordered sides of Sauteed Spinach w/garlic & hot peppers, & Creamy Mashed Potatoes w/poached egg. The poached egg in the mashed potato made it even creamier. It was perhaps the best mashed potato I've ever had.

Last but not the least, the dessert. Most of us were too full but managed to share Mascarpone Panna Cotta w/Blueberry Sauce and Espresso Gelati, Rhubard Gelati & Blueberry Sorbet.

He said it was one of the best steaks he has eaten ever.  We shared the mashed potatoes side dish.  Ohhhhh, so good.

5181434,2016-06-19,0,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"Hello and welcome to Carnevino. We decided to once again take part in Restaurant week her in Vegas. A great charity and a great chance for us budget minded folks to venture past said budget. We made reservations and arrived a few minutes early and were seated immediately.
We were handed regular menus as well as restaurant week menus. Plus a drink menu. Josie ordered a red wine and I ordered an Italian beer. Both served in wine glasses. Water was delivered right away and we were attended by a server right away. We ordered our first course, Calamari and Tagliata di Manzo which is a salad with Arugula and Parmesan. Salad also had this Parmesan cracker with fennel seeds. I really liked the cracker. Fried cheese with fennel. Calamari was not fried as we had thought it would be more of a pan sear with a spicy marinara and cherry peppers. Both were quite good and had amazing pallet pleasing flavor. Second course, Striped Bass with mint peas pesto and lemon. Josie had the New York strip steak. Also as a side we had Italian Broccoli with garlic and smoked pork. Sea bass was tender and and flaky with a great crispy skin. Portion was perfect, and I really enjoyed the mint pea pesto. On to the New York steak. They offered to cut it table side so we of course said yes (when In Carnevino). It has been rare lately when we go out and learn a new technique different from the average way things are done. The steak was ordered medium which came as what most would say mid-rare. Which how we wanted it. They carve steak on the bias which is impressive. Then here is where it gets interesting. They asked if we wanted the olive oil and sea salt added on top of steak. we of course said yes. The steak does not aepar to be cooked with any overt seasoning so when you add the sea salt and olive oil it gives it the most umame flavor I have ever tasted. Sea salt (MALDON SEA SALT) from Britain. Flake salt that has been around for many many years and a chefs favorite from what I read. We bought some at Whole Foods and used it on Tri Tip and it was incredible. On to the final course. I got the Bonet which is flan like desert with apricot and cherries. Josie got a custard in a small glass jar with a bread and fruit. overall a great meal with a new experience. Great staff always checking on us and being very informative with how things were prepared or included in meal. 
The decor is non-descript with a big Bull in the middle of the room. I would have liked it if Casino was not visible from restaurant but hey Vegas right. The Background music not what I expected for a more upscale restaurant. 

Thank you for dining at Carnevino. I will return again and try other things. They waiter said in most cases the steaks are large enough to share as to not break the bank and add more affordable sides and apps for a great dining experience. Our waiter was Kurt and he was fantastic. All the staff was great. Take my advise go check this place out. Take some friends go in on the steak and sides and starters.

But, ordered a decent bottle, we overpaid, as we know we would, and it needed to breathe more, but how can you order your bottle of wine at noon to eat your dinner at 8.  Oh Well.   My steak was OK.  I have had phenomenal steak in Chicago (Gibsons), and really, that is the measurement.  This didn't come close.  This really reminded me of a steak maybe slightly better than say Outback?

We started out by being greeted by a lovely hostess. The decor is fun, casual and interesting. The acoustics were not great. The acid rock music was playing really loud and I could barely hear my husband speak. The waiter did not make a good impression. He was on auto pilot, running through a prepared diatribe of his favorite dishes and not answering my specific questions regarding the preparation of a few dishes. I speak Italian fluently and lived there for five years. I travel back to Italy often. The waiter was condescending when I asked questions, which really upset me. The waiter began ""schooling"" me on the pasta dishes, explaining what a primo piatto is (first plate). He told us that the pasta came in a portion the size of a bread dish and that this is the size of a first plate in Italy - NOT TRUE! He said it was a very small portion, but really flavorful. I have eaten at the finest restaurants in the world and have never seen a waiter try to upsell patrons in this manner. I have never paid $31 for an appetizer portion of pasta. I ordered the seafood pasta, but was not impressed. The pasta was undercooked (not al dente) and quasi crunchy. We had the filet mignon and the meat was delicious! They offer sauces at an extra cost. I ordered the porcini bernaise, which arrived cold and void of any porcini. We also ordered the caponata, which is one of my favorite sides. We received something with chopped eggplant and a ton of vinegar. This dish did not resemble caponata in any way.  Whatever it was,  it should have been sold as an appetizer, not a side dish.

5231717,2010-05-28,2,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"Italian + Steak. What a heavenly combination. From start to finish my business dinner here was pretty fan-freaking-tastic. Impeccable service and some amazing food. Having dined at most of the big name steak places over at Palazzo-Venetian (Cut-Delmonico-Carnevino), I'm going to try to offer some tips to help you select your next insanely expensive steak dinner !

Pork back fat. Yup, that was the waiter's description when he set down a creamy paste called ""lardo"" and I said ""excuse me?!"" As disgusting as a paste called lardo described as ""pork back fat"" sounds.. wow it's fabulous. I felt guilty eating more than like a teaspoon of it, but that's ok. Only issue here was the ciabatta served with the back fat was only barely warmed over. 

Wine list. What a treasure trove of Italian wines they have. For those not on a budget this wine list is killer. Their beer list is also ridiculously good might I add, but most beers were $15+! There were only 5 wines south of $100 and the markup is among the worst I've seen in Las Vegas. Our $110 wine we drank retails for $17 . Over 500% markup?! Sick for even Las Vegas if you ask me. 

For an appetizer we only tried the beef carpaccio. Amazing and among the best I've had in my life. We got 2 orders for 7 of us and we were fighting for the last scraps. Highly recommended ! 

Before I get into the steak, I want to pay hommage to the mashed potatoes with a poached egg mixed in. Some of the best mashed potatoes I've had in my life. That good ! Now onto the..

STEAK: I personally tried half of the ""ribeye for 2"". At $130 it's insanely expensive. Add $15 if you want them to pour some aceto balsalmico on it (ridiculous surcharge). The presentation was beautiful and the steak was among the best in Vegas. One of my dining companions is a steak freak and declared the steak here the best of his life. The seasoning, char, and preparation were all perfect.  As a comparison to other places -
*Delmonico's ribeye isn't as tasty, but a WAY better value. You get nearly the same amount of meat on a ""1 person"" steak at Delmonico as you do on a ""2 person"" steak at Carnevino. At Delmonico the steak retails for ~$60. It's freaking $130 here. Yes, Carnevino's is better, but is it $70 better? I would say no for those that have big appetities ! 
*Tasting platter at Cut retails for ~$130. Honestly I'd take this over the steak at Carnevino most days. It's more exciting (having Japanese wagyu, american wagyu, AND prime on it) and I really do think the wagyu beef is worth the premium. 
*So basically comes down to how price sensitive you are, whether you want one steak done really well with a beautiful char, or are you looking to try wagyu. As a wagyu freak I do slightly prefer Cut but I know some people aren't believers in the magic of wagyu! 

Overall a solid steakhouse and the addition of Italian fare to the typical steakhouse meal is fabulous. Service was impeccable . I hope to return many times in the future.",kmE8w5Y785eZmodsx0V6Ag,8,5,4,FFKwQtl20YbdOGZeE7lT3A
5235620,2014-12-26,0,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"Let me start by saying that I don't typically write bad reviews, so the fact I'm doing so should speak volumes. I'm a Vegas local who frequents the upscale steakhouses in town. CarneVino was far and away the worst of the many I've been to. This bothers me more than usual only because the Palazzo is my favorite property in Vegas.

I ordered the $144 ribeye and it was incredibly tough. I could barely cut through the meat and obviously had an even harder time chewing. When we brought this to the attention of the server he told us he'd let the chef know. You'd think that if you're dishing out that kind of money on a cut of meat SOMETHING would be done. The resolution was the server saying ""Sorry the meat was a little tough for you, hope we'll be able to see you again."" Nothing was done or even offered for that matter. I know everyone has an off night, but the fact that nothing was done about my $144 steak makes me not want to give them the benefit of the doubt.

Furthermore, for a restaurant of this magnitude you'd expect the service to be outstanding. I will say that the man who refilled the water and carved our steak, Carl, was fantastic. However, our main server straight down to the hostess was rude and rarely came by the table to check on us.

There are far better places in Vegas to spend your money on a nice meal - including in the Palazzo and Venetian (CUT by Wolfgang Puck is in the same hotel and far better). Save your money and skip this place.",yMNgkWt2Z2-GhyU9_I5j1w,0,0,2,Jt3gaXi8AD9iNTz05TbSZQ
5241980,2017-04-24,0,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"Personally, I would recommend trying the other steakhouses around Las Vegas before coming here. It is worth a visit if you're close due to their stellar aged steaks (if you like aged meat) and other delicious menu items. They have good food! 

BUT..


There is a whole slew of things that go into making an establishment crave worthy.  The food is the main selling point, and if Carnevino relied solely on the merits of its culinary crafts, they would be a 5 star store. Unfortunately for them, the world does not revolve around how well you can cook a steak or prepare a meal, rather it teeters on the points of atmosphere, service, price, value and experience.  Carnevino excels in their food, but fails quite miserably in the other parts. 

It is expensive. While our steak was very good, I don't think it was worth the $75+ price tag. The alcohol is OBNOXIOUSLY overpriced by atleast 20%. If you plan on drinking here make sure you bring extra cash! Very very expensive alcohol. 

The atmosphere was way off for fine dining. I ate my steak while Black Sabbath was on in the background. It was loud music. Ozzy Osbourne is great musician, but he didn't make music to pair with a 16oz dry aged New York Strip. Needless to say, it didn't go well with my steak and actually detracted from my dining experience.  On top of that, they allow loud and drunk customers. Yes I know we are in Vegas but come on...give me and my $250 meal some respect.  

Then you have service.  The waiters were attentive but were definetly trained in up selling.  Some of it was subtle, which is natural and totally fine, but our waiter pushed additional alcohol purchases and dessert very hard. Annoyingly hard. 

I will not return here, as the price doesn't match value for many reasons. The very high quality of food cannot make up for Carnevino's skewed experience, obnoxious atmosphere and pushy service.",vnydJW_gxfl94KFzuOLSNQ,1,0,3,DW8tWxGfVNaB6Quydeb4mw
5253124,2012-09-08,0,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"BEYOND AMAZING!!! I'm sorry, but if you remember your server's name at any restaurant, it was a absolutely terrific night.  My server was Brayden and he was an absolutely terrific server.  He didn't rush me when I was debating on what to get for wine - and trust me, I took about 45 minutes to decide, even with the help of the master sommelier, Michael.  The wine list was incredibly beautiful to look at, though my wallet and bank account cried at the prices.  But I found a beautiful Henry Fessy Beaujolais for $60 - which was incredibly delectable!

I tried Carnevino in Las Vegas for my birthday week for the first time ever, and I am soooo glad I did.  The place is absolutely amazing!  The service was just right!  Brayden recommended the Octopus that my guest so happened to be eyeing.  I was so scared to try it, but my guest also wanted to try it and I am so glad I did.  The octopus had this lovely asian, spicy/sweet sauce on it with tender octopus that I didn't even think it was octopus!   It was seriously delicious and is definitely worth to try it out.  So don't be afraid to try it.  Trust me, it's absolutely WORTH TRYING!!

My guest and I tried their ribeye for 2 people (each person is 72$) and is definitely worth the money.  They bring out this awesome fred flintstone chunk of meat to your tableside, cut it right there by your table into perfect symmetrical slices for 2 people, and then drizzle it with olive oil and sea salt - which by the way was so simple, but sooooooooooooooooooo incredibly DELICIOUS!!!! the ribeye was made to P.E.R.F.E.C.T.I.O.N. of Med. Rare, and my lovely choice of Beaujolais went magnificently well with the steak.  The bone is left for you to munch on, which of course was also a plus.  Each person gets about 10 oz (or more) of ribeye.  It honestly felt like a lot, and I couldn't even finish mine, so it has got to be 10 oz+, because I can only eat around 8 oz of steak.

For dessert, we had the goat cheese panna cotta and something peanut butter dessert.  Honestly, when you've stuffed a good amount of meat into yourself and you're still aiming for dessert, go for the goat cheese panna cotta.  It was absolutely delicious, as if it wasn't made from goat cheese and incredibly light and refreshing... a perfect dessert for a perfect end of am incredibly delicious, magnificent birthday week night.  Really... B.E.S.T BIRTHDAY EVUUUR, and it was all thanks to Carnevino and Brayden!! THAAANK YOU!!!

I don't usually write on the internet really embarassing things, but the lamb was so good that I kept making those Rachael Ray YUMMO faces.  And I always make fun of people on the Food Network who do that!  But when you have a huge plate of perfectly cooked lamb at your command, there's nothing you can do but make a face and go Mmmmm.  Even the calamari was done right, a dish so easily screwed up at most restaurants.

The drinks we ordered were well-mixed and my only complaint is that 70%+ of the wine list was insanely expensive for a $45ish entree place.  I mean, really.  Expensive.

We took the waiters suggestion and ate family style. Incredible antipasti... A selection of unctuous cheeses with a beautifully floral honey, figs, and fruit, warm bread, beef carpaccio with balsamic drizzled arugula, artisanal salumi, and to die for octopus, the most flavorful and tender I've ever enjoyed. (The server said its due to brining with the addition of corks to the mix!)
The 100 day aged beef lives up to every single day... Like a completely different animal, so flavorful and delectably tender, carved table side in incredibly generous proportion.

The staff went out of their way to make this occasion special for us, each server who helped us wished us a happy anniversary and the fruit tart we had for desert had happy anniversary written across the top of the plate.

Not food related:

Initially, sommelier suggested three out of stock wines, which we thought was strange and a bit embarrassing for him.  Second, the music was so loud we could barely carry on a conversation with one another.  Additionally, while playing AC/DC during dinner was probably a cute and edgy idea to Mario and corporate, we found it strange and disjointed especially when looking at the demographics of the patrons. We observed several walk offs because of the music.  One of our waiters said it was a common occurrence and only happens more frequently as the night goes on and they switch to hardcore rap (seriously).

The most annoying part of the experience was the incessant walk-by note taking of the hostess staff.  Apparently they were keeping close tabs on where diners were in the meal process.

Food related:

We started with the calamari, which was flavored nicely, but was a bit soggy by the time it arrived.  Amuse bouche was cheese fritters, but these were also cold.
 
Split a ""2 inch"" reserve rib eye with a friend, which was close to what I expected, but not sure it was worth $108 per inch.  In total the steak was about 22-24 ounces.  95% of the steak was great and had that perfect super dry aged steak flavor, but the meat that was close to the bone was acrid.  My wife had the filet, which was just OK.  Had the porcini and blue cheese sauces, both were gloppy and bland.

The most disappointing part centered around the side dishes.  The mashed potato with mascarpone and egg yolk were just flat out bland.  Boiled newspaper would have had more flavor.  The house special of Brussels sprouts had so much lemon in them that they were like eating sour patch candy.  For three people not to finish two small side dishes speaks volumes.",YdkPFgH-dNFycw4VtpJzKQ,0,0,2,sOn2DIRqTd5gG1pH_1PI6g

Food:  Not really a steakhouse guy.  I have a nice grill and a excellent butcher who can get me all the cuts I can think of.....until now.  Appetizers, wow, highly recommend the grilled octopus, it was so tender, I had a hard time believing it was octopus.  Duck egg, wonderfully prepared, got the full richness of the yolk and the bacon was excellent.  Antipasti, excellent.

Now for the main, we got the rundown of the specials, but one thing that really stood out was the nations longest dry aged steaks.  9 months plus.  Never heard of such a thing, 90 day, that's pretty typical for me, but 9 months had my full attention.  Pricing is done by the inch, so 2""s of the ribeye were ordered.  Tender and flavorful doesn't do it justice.  It melted in your mouth like a perfectly cooked piece of foie gras, with a flavor of beef with a mild bleu cheese.  Just stunning.  The butter poached lobster was good, but the steak stole the show.  

Cocktails:  Not much of a wine drinker, but love a properly made cocktail.  They do it right with the ice and the proper proportions.  Aberdeen Road, that is my new jam, found this drink on my third cocktail and I must of had 6 more of the suckers.  I would call it a successful variation of a old fashioned.

Service:  Wait staff is attentive.  It got busy at one point and I had to flag a manager for my drink, but it was busy, everyone was hustling and the manager made it happen, not their fault.  Michael J (he has a name you'll never forget) was our waiter, such an excellent concierge for our dining experience, I am going to ask for him whenever I'm making a reservation at Carne Vino in the future.

Now standing as one of Las Vegas' top Steakhouses for nearly a decade, the ten year anniversary that few survive to see coming in January and the restaurant still doing big numbers even on an otherwise inconsequential Monday in October, it was just 45-minutes prior to a big rush at seven o'clock that the group of first timers arrived from a delayed flight out of Chicago, the trio of hostesses collecting the reservation and quickly escorting the group to a large table in the center of the main dining room.

One of Sin City's most lively restaurants, the overhead music turned down on this particular occasion but still assisting the bustling atmosphere by way of Pink Floyd, The Rolling Stones, Tom Petty and Amy Winehouse, it was after quick confirmation of allergies and intolerances that three Mocktails were ordered, each seasonal concoction praised by those who partook while Iced Tea or Water was the Beverages of choice for the others.

In many ways an interesting choice for a birthday meal as two of the five diners were Pescetarian, though any who have dined at Carnevino likely know that the restaurant's Appetizers, Pastas and Salads are also worth the price of admission, it was after mere moments that the meal got underway with two of the restaurant's signatures offered to every guest, the Gougeres unfortunately a bit cool to touch and without the creamy center usually experienced while the Rosemary Foaccia and duo of Butter and Lardo once again tempted throughout the meal, even though staff twice took away the empty small plates mistakenly assuming that diners had their fill.

Offering two additional Cicchetti as an amuse, two receiving Vegetarian-friendly bites while the rest enjoyed imported Prosciutto wrapped around fried Dough and Toast topped in aged-Beef Tartare, it was shortly after this that course one of the meal arrived, Batali's charred Octopus every bit as good as usual with a good Char on tender flesh while the Crudo was unfortunately fairly flavorless, far better bites found in the Cheese-stuffed Squash Blossoms atop coarse Tomatoes and the crispy Potato wedges served with a requested side of the Restaurant's funky Gorgonzola Mascarpone ""Steak Sauce.""

Always doing an impeccable job with meal pacing, an impressive feat for a high-volume Restaurant that focuses so heavily on tableside presentations and lengthy prep-times for some of the heavier cuts, it was shortly after appetizers were finished that the team once again presented tableside with three Pescetarian-friendly Pastas plus Mario's legendary Beef Cheek Ravioli, the Egg Raviolos divided tableside with deep yellow Yolk pouring forth soon to be sopped up with Bread while the Spaghetti Nero was mildly spiced with a good bite and plenty of Crab, the Agnolotti unfortunately very one dimensional as the Butter and Corn overwhelmed any semblance of Mushrooms or Watercress.

Happy to see others thus far impressed by the meal, the best certainly yet to come, it was after another brief respite that carts were wheeled tableside, a $150 Bone-In Ribeye and $110 9-Month Dry-Aged Riserva sliced tableside and presented with all the bold favors fans have come to expect while two portions of tender Red Snapper were served atop spicy Romesco along with four seasonal sides.

Quite literally cleaning the Bones and nearly every bite of the sides in addition to both plates of Fish, the Squash Agrodolce, citrusy Corn and Mascarpone Mashed Potatoes both with and without Guanciale all highly recommended, it was after a brief visit from Pastry Chef Ashley Costa that the meal reached its end, three seasonal riffs on old favorites highlighted by both the Banana Pudding served in a Sfogliatella cup and the Bombolini atop a bed of Autumnal Conserva while the off-menu Special of Pumpkin Bread Pudding was steamy, soft and well-spiced with Salty Caramel and a ball of slowly melting Gelato on top.

****Not quite as landmark a meal as previous visits, the Bread issue frustrating but forgivable while two plates that should have been better are difficult to ignore from a restaurant that is almost invariably on-point from beginning to end, Carnevino nonetheless remains a top-tier Steakhouse more than capable of feeding a wide-range of guests from Vegetarian and Gluten-Free straight through to the ""Meat and Potatoes"" sort.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,18,13,4,FyOoPggxTXrGlRlq4-ZjAw

My entr√©e was made up of two sides: Scallops A La Piastra and Italian Broccoli. The scallops had good presentation, but were cold. The broccoli was something just thrown into the dish, hanging out the side, etc. 

The service, plating, and food are not worth $$$$.",6qTJVWJ9RmVuoHi1CNcb_g,4,4,2,XIC99lV5gZJg4XH7qpZOTQ
5310492,2012-03-22,0,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"The one constant and must order at any Batali restaurant is the burrata. I started off with the insalata caprese and the burrata didn't disappoint. Quality is similar to that found at Mozza Osteria. I chose this restaurant because it was recommended by a friend for their dry aged steaks. So, I went with the La Florentina, I believe it was a porterhouse meant to be split with 2. I asked it to be cooked Medium well, mainly because from my experience at all steakhouses with bone-in steaks, they always seem to cook a level or 2 below what you ask for. Sure enough, it came out medium rare to medium which was perfect. I especially liked that they cut up the steak for you and give you the bone to gnawl at whatevers remaining or you can do it the more civilized way and just slice away the remaining meat attached to the bone. For my plate I also got 5 grams of black truffle to be added on top of my porterhouse, but it turned out to be a waste of $40, as it didn't seem to blend well with the steak. The porterhouse was good but maybe I was just expecting more so it didn't really blow me away. The sides there were mediocre at best. I believe we ordered the sauteed mushrooms with spring onions, spinach and tuscan fries. Out of the bunch, the spinach was best, but even that didn't really excite anyone. I will say if you like cabernet savignon, the stratton lummis 2008, was great with the porterhouse. You're probably buying the bottle at 20 a glass, but hey you're in Vegas, why not spend a little extra and live a little.",h1rg3nzy0W5B-ewTIn4waw,0,0,4,g18ivOMWmGKQYBpb1xHppA
5316853,2012-09-25,1,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"Thanks a lot Mario Batali and Joe Bastianich for my complimentary steakhouse blinders!  I haven't been able to stop raving about the entire dinner to my friends, family, peers, and frankly anyone who I can make green with envy.  We've been to a few other well established steakhouses on the Las Vegas strip, but you know when you've decided to go all out for a nice, fancy meal, you may or may not be like me and search ""number one _______ restaurant in Vegas"" just to see what the consensus is out there.  Such was the case for our most recent adventure in Sin City and Carnevino outranked the rest on many sites so we gave it a try.  

The kind service was what we noticed first and no, we don't mean from our waiter (yet).  We were set to fly in on 9/11/12 around 16:00 and what was supposed to be a quick 48 minute flight turned into our 21:00 dinner reservation being canceled last minute and us RUNNING to catch a Cirque show we already had tickets to at 22:30 because we didn't arrive until 20:30 to our hotel.  Turns out we decided to fly on the one day Las Vegas and its surrounding areas had flash flood warnings and torrential down pour crazy enough to practically rain out the Bellagio fountain show.  We kept pushing back our reservations for dinner first from 19:00 to 20:00, then to 21:00 with a possibility of 21:30.  Either way, the hostesses were super sweet and courteous about the entire debacle and helped us feel like our safety was actually important to them too!  We ended up making another reservation a few days later and luckily were able to make it then. 

We were greeted warmly and were promptly seated in a well lit area (a part of me cries when it's so dim in a restaurant that you can't see your own hand in front of you let alone the food they expect you to blindly put in your mouth as a result).  Our waiter Chris (I'm going to play the race card and say that he was Asian because he deserves some great recognition for his dedication and integrity - RAN out to find us on the Palazzo gaming floor to correct a discrepancy on our check - and frankly with a name like Chris, how else can we describe the guy?!) shows up and we have a great conversation about the menu and he gives us some time to decide after offering up a few of his own suggestions.  I cannot stress enough that it was a CONVERSATION about the menu and not some long drawn out, pretentious lecture about the food which is not fun to say the least. 

Obligatory bread service? Yes.  

Obligatory butter on the side? Yes. 

.........oh I forgot to mention the heavenly lardo that is served with it.  It almost hurts to talk about it and not be able to access it until our next adventure to Vegas...literally hurts.  Pardon me while I zone out for a moment reminiscing about the sexiness that is the lardo spread on a freshly baked piece of bread....

We decide on:

Insalata Romana with a sweet garlic dressing = nice and light with lots of radicchio (a little more bitter than I'm used to)

Spaghetti ai Frutti di Mare = check with your server about the size of the plate - it was enough for two to share, MAYBE three as an appetizer.  How can you go to a Batali affiliated restaurant and NOT have any pasta right?  This dish was slightly spicy with clams, giant shrimp, lobster, and calamari....oh and I forgot it was cleared away with a piece of my soul. *Sigh*

Dry aged bone-in Ribeye for 2 = at $144, it was well worth the interrogation we gave Chris about how it was cooked.  We had read reviews that at Carnevino they generally under cook their meat and as a 'medium rare' type of girl myself and my boyfriend a 'medium' aficionado himself, after a patient round of ""it's your birthday babe, it's your choice"" and ""no, no I'm okay with whatever"" we settled on medium and it was absolutely perfect for the both of us.  I'd almost recommend that to anyone and everyone since having one of these cuts of meat as 'well done' is just plain WRONG.  To clarify - this gorgeous cut of meat (and I don't mean my boyfriend for once) required no sauce of any kind in my humble opinion.  

Mascarpone Guanciale mashed potatoes = served with a raw egg yolk on top and stirred in with the hot potatoes at the table it will make you seriously consider if you ever need to try any other kind of mashed potatoes ever again.  In fact, I've pretty much convinced myself that all other mashed potatoes are merely impersonators and they only reason we can't have mascarpone guanciale mashed potatoes EVERY day is because of the cholesterol intake from the egg yolk.  Please don't take this away from me...

""Creamed"" corn with lime and picked chilies = described as a seasonal item, it wasn't so much the typical creamed corn that one might be used to - hence the quotation marks made sense.  Still delicious. 

Running out of space to type...all I can say is you deserve to go at least once in your lifetime.  Now, be a little spontaneous, pick up the phone and GO!!",Q81bRUpSpiASqzBD9-T94A,1,1,5,hrVNAZPGNDzfOxfhcE-1nQ

The flavorful dry-aged beef (that requires special treatment in aging process) carved right in front of you, sprinkled with sea salt and drizzled with olive oil...definitely no steak sauce required.

Sides were good asparagus and spinach but the truffled mashed potatoes didn't really deliver on the truffle taste. They made a big deal about telling us it was REAL truffles not truffle oil but these truffles must have been old because they delivered ZERO truffle taste.

5357323,2016-02-26,0,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"Which celebrity chef Mario Batali, we had high expectations. Front of the house was good. Even our server was good. Menu is extensive. The wine list was one of the biggest I have ever seen. However there were no reasonable bottles available. The solemnly a came to check on us to help in purchasing wine but didn't have much to say after I stated that all bottles were very expensive.
On the menu a mix of Italian and dry aged steaks. I must admit I'm not a huge fan of very long dry aged steaks but I decided to have the strip steak anyway. At close to $80 it wasn't what I expected. We were brought out a small a moose Boosh. We stated we were celebrating our anniversary. But they only brought us two small fritters. The table next to us with three people got an entire bowl of the same. To me this is not equal treatment of patrons. 
The better provided with the bread was interesting one made of bacon fat little too rich for my taste but inventive. We had ravioli made with short ribs. It wasn't great. Again I was expecting significantly more from Mario Batali. Not to say I was looking for complicated dishes but flavor that is out of this world with simple ingredients.
My husband had Sultan BOKA veal and what a large disappointment. It is his favorite dish and ordered at almost any restaurant that serves it. Again we had high expectations. The veal was chilly and the sauce flavorless. Could not taste any sage in the dish.
Suffice it to say I was not impressed and will not ever return. For a bill of $300 for the two of us with four glasses of wine each around $26 and an $80 steak it wasn't worth the money.",kddFMjZTWulkLsHCKo3lzw,1,0,2,xnyiNH5eDIdNX_S11kOJFw

Maybe overwhelming. My husband selected the magnum of wine, since there was 5 people but they were out of that so, two bottles it was. 

As for food. The oysters were on the smaller size. The octopus was perfect. Some of the best I have ever had. The past was very good. The Pappardelle was my favorite. We then went on to the meat. And boy, was there a lot of meat. We got the the dry age bone in ribeye, Porterhouse and the lamb chops. The steak was one of the best cooked meat I have ever had. I loved the char on the outside, and a perfect warm, red center. The lamb was good. On the fatty side, which was a bit of a disappointment. The sides we had were Eggplant and mashed potatoes. They were good. Not the best but good.

5376316,2011-06-03,1,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"We've been eyeing up this restaurant for months. My husbands birthday was the perfect excuse to partake in colossal proportions. I had  reservations, but once we got there we knew it wasn't necessary, the place was empty except for one other table. The hostess was friendly and assisted us quickly. The tables filled as the night progressed but having the waiters undivided attention was worth getting there early (6:30pm). I was unsure of the wine I wanted, so he patiently went through the list and brought multiple tastings of wine until I found the one I liked (Arizona Stronghold TAZI). Our waiter, Micheal, was top notch, he was patient and wasn't put off from all our questions, and even made suggestions. My husband got their specialty farmers market drink which was like an orange mojito. We were presented with 2 bite size fried cheese balls, compliments of the chef, they were good, reminded us of the gold fish snack crackers (LOL). We also were given tasty dinner rolls with butter or lardo spreads (we both preferred the butter).
For our meals we decided on the INSALATA CAPRESE,....WOW, how can such simple ingredients taste so good? The tomatoes were candied, the mozzarella was fresh, soft and gooey, everything went perfectly together, I could eat that dish everyday.
Next we got POTATO GNOCCHI BOLOGNESE and BUCATINI ALL' AMATRICIANA, both were delicious. The gnocchi was so tender and the sauce was perfect. The bucatini dish has a little spice to it, the pasta had nice tooth to it, really thick, the pork that was in the sauce totally put the taste into another dimension...simply amazing.
Being a steakhouse we had to get beef, we agreed on the DRY AGED BONE IN RIBEYE for 2 with a side of MASCARPONE & GUANCIALE MASHED POTATOES and a GIANT MADAGASCAR SHRIMP. Paired with an Italian red Brandini. The monstrous piece of meat was presented to us, then the waiter carefully cut it into beautiful slices, the bone is left at the table and we were encouraged to have at it (my kind of place), my husband and I had to arm wrestle for the bone:) The steak was so tender, cooked perfectly, seasoning was simple and didn't overpower the meat. The wine complimented the steak perfectly. The mashed potatoes were yummy, very heavy though, so we tried no to eat too much of those. The shrimp was giant as advertised, cooked perfect, taste was delicious, a shrimp that eats like a lobster but better. 
By this point I thought my stomach would explode, but we decided to end the meal with a trio of gelato...vanilla, mint, and espresso; vanilla was the best, the mint made my stomach feel better and actually made me feel like i could eat more, the espresso helped wake me up from my food coma. I was wrong to think we were done, our waiter brought 2 complimentary raisin cookies, I had to eat it, reminded me of biscotti.
The food is pricey but I think it was worth every penny and would go back in an instant, you can even eat at the bar if you wish to just pop in for a taste.",DoRCeCcJbrsM2BiAKj3trA,3,1,5,edF_zWsw3W0St2JtMmS5lQ

If you're looking for great food at its best, this is your restaurant. We came because of restaurant week, but we chose to order off the menu because we were so impressed with the multiple choices. We chose the grilled octopus and the Insalata Caprese to start. Both were fantastic and some of the best I've had. For the entr√©e, we ordered the dry aged ribeye for two. It was unbelievably good. The flavor was fantastic. I did order the Barolo reduction sauce, which is a red wine reduction sauce, and it complimented the ribeye very well. The ribeye cost a total of roughly $160 for two people with five dollars for the sauce. For sides, we ordered the corn and we ordered the asparagus. My friend was impressed with the corn, and I was impressed with the asparagus. 
For dessert, we ordered the Sfogliatelli and the coconut Pana cotta, and both were delicious. They were both reasonably priced at $12 at $11 respectively.
For the wine, we ordered a higher end Barolo red wine which was $28 a glass, and we ordered four glasses in total.
The bill, minus two glasses of the red wine, which we got before dinner at the bar, was roughly $339. No, not cheap.
The service is excellent and very friendly. They are very attentive. The ambiance was very nice and open, and I found it very relaxed.

Service was wonderful - we were seated as soon as they could put our large table together. (we seemed to be the first ones arriving for dinner - which may have helped). Our waiter was very knowledgeable and explained the entire menu, as well as options for ordering for a large party. He was also very friendly and joked with our goofy group. 

We all ordered the famous Ribeye and thoroughly enjoyed it. The meat was tender and the flavor was good for just plain steak. NOTE: If you're not that hungry, share the steak between 3 people - it's A LOT of meat. 

Appetizers and pasta dishes were also quite delicious. 

The only drawback - it was all very overpriced, and even though it was all very good - I've had better. That's Vegas for ya! Plan on spending a lot, or go somewhere else. No need to be bitter about the bill as the prices are on the menu.

5420104,2016-10-19,7,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"The bottom line: this place is a 0 on a binary scale.

At first glance I was thrilled - what could be better than meat and wine? My excitement quickly turned to suspicion upon entry, when I was welcomed with the worst combination of smells: old furniture + poor ventilation. Regardless, I took my seat, hopeful for something tantalizing, only to be disappointed by the outrageous pricing at this less-than-sub-par establishment. The two main steaks were $150+ each and the least exorbitant wines were $100+. (Most were 2x to 10x this range.) This pricing might be expected if you were literally anywhere other than the outdated casino lobby of the Palazzo, surrounded by poorly dressed business people and geriatrics ripping cigs while playing slots. But, alas, one finds themselves here, sad and underwhelmed on a typical Tuesday in Las Vegas. 

We ordered some cocktails (none of which exceeded the most mild of expectations), and the octopus with the agnolotti and gnocchi. Sadly, the appetizers would only prove impressive to the least expectant of Red Lobster patrons. The penne pasta was way over cooked and the gnocchi was terribly presented. To top it off, the octopus, while prepared comparatively well, was so insecurely masked by other, competing flavors that you could barely savor the most outstanding dish of the evening. Needless to say, the bar was set low. 

When our steaks finally arrived - more than 60 oz in total - they looked good! But, looks can be deceiving. After being promised that their medium ran rare, we received two over-cooked pieces of meat. The result was an outstanding example of Las Vegas culinary disaster: a famous restaurant or chef turns to the city of sin in the hopes of profitable scalability; favor/quality/experience/character are completely neglected, and the result is a trap for business diners whose expense accounts sadly absorb the inadequacies of it all. To sum it up, our steaks sucked. The sides, while effortful, could not make up for such a poor main performance. 

The only saving grace would have been the dessert menu. But, we were sadly disappointed when the plate of Costco-grade cheese arrived. This, accompanied by tiramisu that had clearly been refrigerated for far longer than advised.

My only follow-up question: Mario, why would you lend your legacy to such a promising enterprise (by way of location and name) that so severely underperforms in the most basic of categories (experience, taste, value)?

PS: The cheese balls, compliments of the chief, must have been meant to be back-handed. If you find yourself on the receiving end of a similar gesture, kindly decline.",5v3mjpAo2pBLctHbYvdmnw,8,2,2,aLzqpbae76Mot9uOHJMgxA

5460270,2010-06-29,0,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"Carnevino...hmmm.  Let me start by stating that most of the food was exceptional.  With the exception of the 12 oz filet that we ordered that came out mooing when we ordered it medium-rare, everything we ordered was perfect.  I don't mean pink...I mean our steak was seared on the outside and completely red, raw and cold on the inside.  Why didn't we send it back, you might ask?  For starters, we didn't exactly have the time, as we were going to see a show that evening.  However, the real reason is that our server was less than accommodating.  He didn't do anything wrong, per se, but he didn't do his job well either.  

We concluded that he was disappointed that we were a party of 6 (dining at 5 pm, so there was plenty of time to turn the tables that evening, which he was aware of) and didn't want to each order a starter, entree, sides, dessert, etc.  We had just arrived in town a couple of hours prior and had a snack, plus we were planning on meeting up for snacks/dessert later that evening after the show.  However, we weren't trying to split a salad 6 ways, either.  We ordered a $100.00 bottle of wine, all the specials they were offering that day, a 12 oz steak to share, a bunch of sides, etc and still spent about $100 pp that evening.  Not exactly shabby, in my opinion.  However, it didn't seem to be good enough for him, even though the restaurant was entirely empty and we were the only table he was serving.  It just made no sense, especially knowing that we were celebrating two guests' birthdays...one would have thought he would have bent over backwards to ensure our visit was a pleasurable one.  Fortunately, the company was terrific and we didn't much mind; but we didn't go back there for dessert and drinks later that evening, etiher.  

So, would I go back to Carnevino?  The jury is still out.  The food really was terrific, but I'd just be sure to not have him as our server again.  Botero in the Encore the following evening, however, was AMAZING, all the way around.  Steak is something that is very easy to come by in Vegas, as is ambiance.  Potentially jeapordizing an evening with anything less than a stellar experience is not something I generally do - but their bacon butter just may make me change my mind!",P255JAS2WcjyfD-wbU-seg,0,0,3,ISkMJZg_FGqbopd33q--hQ

FOOD: 3 stars... My wife ordered the filet and I had the ""mixed grill"" as our main entrees. The filet was tender ... nothing to write home about. The mixed grill came with 5 different proteins...shrimp, buffalo sausage, hangar steak, guinea fowl, and some type of pork ... Most of it had a lot of flavor except the shrimp was a complete waste. 

We ordered the mashed potatoes and mushrooms. The mushrooms were EXCELLENT. The potatoes were boring. 

My wife had a blood orange martini... she just kept telling me it was yummy. 

SERVICE: 2 stars... the waiter was nice, accommodating and attentive... however their staff SPILLED A HOT SIDE DISH OF SPINACH ON MY BACK. Unbelievable. On top of that... all I got was a simple apology... nothing comped. It was pretty pathetic. I didn't want to make a scene since I was there with 12 other people. But it was pretty ridiculous how that even happened. Ruined my entire dining experience. 

AMBIANCE: 2 stars.... it's located inside the Palazzo and so it's a large restaurant. Too bad that they threw us in the back where it's tightly packed (appears they accommodate a lot of large parties) and loud. The tight squeeze  probably contributed to the waiter dropping the plate of spinach all over my back. 

A buddy of mine had the Rib eye for 2. The presentation of them cutting at the table made it look amazing...  but I was told that it wasn't worth the $70/person they charge for it.

Sure, I could save Carnevino for special occasions, but honestly, it's too good for that.  Eating here is special enough and any excuse whatsoever is sufficient.  Finished season 3 of ""Suits"" in one day?  Did 4 minutes and 9 seconds straight on the treadmill??  Managed to put my pants on all by myself one leg at a time????  Carne-fucking-vino!!!!!!!!

While there are many stupendous starters to choose from, like their grilled octopus, Prosciutto di Parma 'Riserva', or steak tartare for back to back beefiness, it's the Ricotta and Egg Raviolo that screams out to me on every visit.  At $21, it may very well be the priciest single ravioli in the city, but take one bite and try to deny that it is freakin incredible.  Sop up the leftover brown butter and yolk for additional amazingness!!  I hate myself when I order it and love myself after I finish it.  

The stars aligned on my most recent visit when the server informed us that their 9 month aged riserva beef was available, so we pounced on a 1 inch thick cut for $115.  All those rumors of the flavors were true, the hints of blue cheese and gorgonzola, the muscle-y fibrous chew and distinct beef flavor were like nothing I'd ever had before.  Kiss the tip of the fork in some of the aged balsamic before sticking it in and you've got foodgasm galore.  

This was an exceptional tasting experience that any beef connoisseur should seek out as this is the only steakhouse in the US that ages beef this long.  They actually advised us to finish our ribeye (of course we got one of those too) first, but we simply couldn't wait that long and enjoyed the differences between the two immensely.   

Best way to lessen the hit on the wallet would probably be racking up the Opentable points.  We knocked off $200 between that and a gift card.

It was a while ago so I don't recall many details (probably because we also all got the wine pairings and got out of our minds). I'll say 2 things. First is that you should get the fixed menu but maybe not get the wine pairing because it's a lot of alcohol--just get a bottle for the table. Second thing is that I love how they served the last course which was basically a huge cut of steak with bone-in-place that is served on one big plate and you get whatever you want, family-style (see pictures I uploaded). The best part is biting the meat directly off the huge bone. Carnevino is a great/underrated steakhouse in Vegas that I think you can easily get a table at (but make reservations just in case).",82dCHyU-ANOgdhxUgZsUeg,1,1,4,Exj6WMfrOojgyGaw6CS0FQ
5549936,2011-03-16,0,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"Oh Mario Batali, just when you made me hate you with your awful Enoteca restaurant at the Venetian, you make me love you again and want to give you a huge hug with Carnevino.  

This was one of the best meals I have ever had, so special that it gives me a warm feeling inside just thinking about this meal.  Corny to say but it is absolutely true.

Let me preface by saying that I rarely, if almost never, order ribeye cuts of steak.  The rich marbling gives me a tummy ache and I find that most restaurants serve it a little tough.  But Mario Batali's ribeye for two completely changed my opinion on ribeye, and since this meal I have only ordered this cut of meat at restaurants.

My entire experience at this restaurant was positive, so much that I felt like I was eating at an old friend's house.  From the moment we walked in, we were taken care of from one of the best servers I have ever had.  He was intimately familiar with the local farmers market scene, and especially the Molto Mario Farmer's market, where he is a volunteer.  He was able to talk about the specific elements of dishes and drinks that were obtained from specific merchants from that market.  Since I frequent this market, I knew exactly which products contributed to each dish.  It was pretty cool to witness the whole farm to table concept in action, especially in a town like Las Vegas.

This is one of the few dining experiences that have been super expensive, but I have not felt like I was ripped off.  Yes, the price of the dinner was high enough to give someone a heart attack, but it was totally worth it.  I've now been to most of the high end steakhouses in town, and none have been able to justify their prices as much as Carnevino.  It truly is an original gem and I plan on going back frequently.

5551323,2016-03-30,4,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"Okay hater the gloves are off.  I see criticisms of two variety. First, it was too expensive for small steaks and small pasta dishes. News flash people, it's a fine dining Italian steakhouse it's going to be expensive. if you walk through the casino half drunk and stumble in and are surprised that it's going to dent your wallet then go to the buffet...If you can afford it.  Other reviews say they were coerced into getting the pre fix meal. Really? REALLY? Stop.

-Pastas. Honestly all are incredible. Ive tried the Orecchiette, the egg ravioli, the tagliatelle, etc. I've also tried their speciality pastas but the name I've forgotten. But the pasta is crazy delicious, it's pretty much no contest. And on the issue of the pasta, they have an aged balsamic vinegar they drizzle on their pastas. This stuff you could eat by the spoonful. I imagine a bottle of this stuff is a few hundred dollars. I'd drink it by the bottle.

-Meats. I've only ever had the dry aged ribeye but I don't need anything else and neither do you. Aged for 6 months or more, this stuff is mind blowingly good. They carve it in front of you which is fun and it's meat for 2 hence why it's $152. But honestly it's just about the best meat you can get in Vegas period. 

Honestly there is just no reason to review this place poorly. Saying it's too expensive is not a legitimate excuse. It's one thing if the portions and small and the flavors arent there and another when you can literally taste the quality of the food. This is the latter. I recognize that this place is probably a place by snobs for snobs (joe from masterchef you are the boss) but that's why I like it.  If you are the type of person that has regrets after you drop a few hundred on a meal then yes you will leave with a bad taste in your mouth. 

Simply put if you can afford it go. It's worth it. Haters gonna hate and you just gotta shake it off.",TZhIAnp1m3RzWevju1mp1g,5,5,5,mj8RqeGZSi-nlLUqE1rpnQ

A reservation is key and probably a must have on a Friday or Saturday evening. The ambiance is dark and romantic for that perfect evening with someone you care to have a great meal with. I did not go with a loved one however, just an awesome group of business partners looking to have one of the best meals in Las Vegas.

5575712,2012-08-20,0,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"One word: Riserva.

My hubby decided to take me here for my birthday. Very pricey place for meat, but worth it just to try once in your life.

The steaks here are dry aged, some at 3 months and the rare ones at 6 months (the RISERVA.). I love cheese, and I heard the Riserva is for those that love that ""funky"", ""aged"" taste. More specifically, blue cheese. Yummmm!

The riserva I had was the Rib-Eye. It was $108 for a 1-inch steak, and the price goes up by how thick you want your slab. Therefore, 1/2 inch more was $50 (i.e. 1 1/2 inch steak was $158). I say it's worth it, if you want to try that real AGED flavor.

My hubby had the regular ribeye, and his was about $98. I would have got the Riserva for that.

***Btw, keep in mind that the Riserva is not always in stock daily. You do have to call in advance to make sure they have it. There are 3 types of Riserva: Ribeye, Porterhouse, and New York. The Porterhouse I hear tends to be more dry, and most people usually go for the RIbeye and New York.

The service for the restaurant was great. I loved how they carved your steak for you after they present it. 

Another tip: Most waiters here will tell you that they tend to undercook their meats. So if you like medium rare, they said you should order the Medium. This can be true for their regular dry aged steaks, but for the Riserva....no way! I like my steaks medium rare, and when I got my Riserva it was more like Medium well in some parts. That was the only thing that disappointed me about the experience of this rare steak. Since it's aged longer, it would be more ""cooked"" or ""drier"". Therefore, you must order what you normally like for the Riserva and not more cooked!

I received this, in the form of perfectly cooked beef cheek ravioli, and a precisely seared fillet mignon. The vegetable sides were delicious. I could eat an entire plate of the broccoli by itself.

The reason this is not a four star review is due to the experience. Do not get me wrong, the restaurant is beautifully decorated and lit, with great mood lighting. The wait staff were very polite and efficient. The problem was the bloody music.

When I am trying to have a relaxing dinner with some business friends and clients, I should not have to shout at the person across from me over the eclectic sounds of Pink Floyd's The Wall album. When we asked a manager if the music could be turned down, he brusquely informed that was not possible.

As much as I love the Las Vegas foodie scene I don't get the opportunity to eat at many of the famed steakhouses. I also never got to eat at any one of Mario Batali's restaurants so this was a chance to check-off another restaurant in my ever-growing restaurant bucket list. 

CONCEPT: This restaurant is their interpretation of a steakhouse in the classical Italian style. Mario Batali is a well-known chef most known for his stints in Iron Chef America and The Chew.

VENUE: The restaurant is located on the Palazzo casino floor closest to the exit. It looks like there's two separate parts of the restaurant divided into two sides: one side is the bar area while the other side is the restaurant proper. The restaurant space is quite big with lots of chairs that can seat groups of 2 and 4 but we noticed that as the time passed (had a 6pm reservation) the tables kept on filling. It is slightly roomy between tables, which should allow space for the staff to cut your steak.

SERVICE: Excellent service with an eye for attention to detail. 

I knew I was having ribeye so I went with my gut and had a Malbec, Tritono 2013 Mendoza as my glass. Malbecs are my varietal of choice for heavier meats - full-bodied and just enhanced the meat characteristics.

As appetizer we tried the paso doble (2 person portion) of their interpretation of the Feast of Seven Fishes. If we ordered for everyone this would've been too much food as appetizer but it was perfect for light bites when everything was split. The seafood used was not too heavy and a mix of fish and shellfish. 

The free bread is tied with the best bread I've tried (rivaling TFL). Their cheese bombolini is like a crisp pao de queijo and their rosemary focaccia spread with lardo (pig back fat) melts in your mouth so perfectly. Definitely more complex than just herbal butter. 

The must-get item is their Dry Aged Bone-in Ribeye ($152 = $76/person for 2 person serving). A *very* high (above USDA Prime) grade beef dry-aged for 90 days. It is rubbed with sea salt, rosemary and black pepper. It is cut tableside and sprinkled and brushed with more sea salt and olive oil. This was a lot of meat for four people, even if 1/3 of the meat is just pure fat. The marbling results in this soft and flavorful piece that goes down very easily with a Malbec. Supposedly they are one of the top 6 dry-aging steakhouse restaurants in the US. Aside from the pieces with more fat another good part is the charred area near the bone.

SIDES
- Mascarpone & Guanciale Mashed Potatoes ($12). Mashed potatoes with mascarpone, guanciale (cured pork jowl) and poached quail egg. Gives an Italian spin to loaded mashed potatoes. Creamy and rich, it is one of the best mashed potatoes I've had. 
- Sauteed Mixed Mushrooms (with spring onions, $12). Gotta balance out that meat with some greens!
- Spinach (with garlic and hot peppers, $8). Even more greens. Not very spicy. Hope you're not taking anti-clotting meds...

By the third piece I was only hoping for a piece I could swallow.  After complaining to the manager he wanted to give us free dessert.  I don't eat dessert.  I went there for the steak alone.   I told him we would give them another chance, after all everyone can have an off day.  After a long story about how they feed their cattle and prepare their steaks we received no resolve, no discount towards another meal...nothing.  The manager was arrogant enough to claim they could never have prepared a steak as we (5 of us) had claimed.  We have all eaten at the Palm, DelFresco, Morton's and others.

Across the board at the table we all felt the meat was a little too rare. 

That said, the steak was fantastic (the, uh, outer portions) -- I avoided the very center of the cuts. Just know when coming here that you want to order ""medium-well"" to ""well-done"" to get the medium-rare that you'd get elsewhere.

The person that I shared the steak with said that Joe's (Forum Shops @ Caesars) was still his favorite steak place in Vegas. I've never been, so I can't say -- I liked this place just fine.

Normally I would go to Jean-Georges Prime Steakhouse at the Bellagio, Jean Georges at the Aria or Bazaar Meats by Jose Andres, but I stayed at the Palazzo this first half of this CES trip. It's impossible to go across the strip during CES, almost 180,000 attendees all try to get to restaurants and parties. Complete madness here, so I have my team stayed in the same resort for dinner.

Booked a large group here for my CES event, 18 of us, so I got to order just about everything on the menu. 

Chef Mario Batali & Joe Bastianich's swanky Palazzo Hotel kitchen known for dry-aged steaks & fine wines. They are 1 of the best Italian steakhouses in Las Vegas, if not the country. 

Besides flavorful cuts of steak, modern Italian dishes, Carnevino offers great  cocktails, impressive wine list, and also delicious  dessert.

Appetizers: 

- Grilled Octopus - pickled vegetables and limoncello
 
- Carne Cruda Alla Piemontese - chopped to order steak tartare with raw mushrooms

- Fried Calamari - marinara and cherry peppers
 
Pasta:

- Tagliatelle Bolognese

- Pappardelle beef short rib ragu

- Spaghetti ai Frutti di Mare - slightly spicy with clams, shrimp, lobster and calamari.

Entr√©e: they source natural and antibiotic free meats. They rub all of their beef with sea salt, black pepper and fresh rosemary to get a delicious and slightly charred crust.

- Scaloppine caper berries and preserved lemon, this veal was so good.

- La Fiorentina - classic Florentine porterhouse, perception.

- Rib Eye is always a perfect cut here. 

- Lamb Chops 'Scottadita' 3 Double Chops - perfectly cooked. 

- Pork  ""Osso Buco' - saffron orzo and gremolata

- Tuscan Seafood Stew herbs, tomato and shellfish brodo was quite good. 

They also offer a Theater Dinner: $65 ($57 with show tickets) Available before 6:30PM and after 9:30PM.

They have the Beef Tasting of $150, but you have to order for the entire table. 

Dessert: Sweet tooth friends, save room for Gelati too ok. 

- Pear Budino - whiskey butterscotch & poached pears

- Bomboloni - fresh bananas & huckleberry reduction

- Chocolate Bacon Cake - caramel buttercream & candied bacon


And don't forget to take the picture with that bodacious  bull too! 1 of my new favorite steakhouses on Vegas strip!",JADdo9NEeO5Az9aOYbyvZA,11,9,5,yqt9oILj3vd56HtmuyTp5A

One statement...we got sick eating here. 

We ordered 3 of their ""top"" choices for steaks including their ""signature 9 month dry aged"" steak, and ended up getting sick. 

While that is enough to earn one star, how they handled the issue is even worse. When I approached the restaurant to inform them that their food caused my entire party to get sick, they appeared to show genuine concern and said they would report the incident and have someone contact me. ONE MONTH LATER, I finally get in touch with their LIABILITIES department who informs me that they do not see anything was done wrong so nothing will be done. 

Upon retrospect, they do this to MAKE YOU GO AWAY. So...to all Yelpers...take their advice and STAY AWAY.

Ambiance:
More old world Italian than steak house feel - we preferred the smaller side room, decorated like a library - quieter for conversation. Though, its open door and proximity to the hall was weird and made it feel less private.

Service:
Our server was SUPER friendly, professional, attentive, and knowledgeable about all the menu items and food in general. If he were older I would have guessed he was one of those career waiters.

Food: 
Everything is pretty heavy handed with salt and sugar, so be warned. I'm good with it, but some people might find it a bit much. Their wine list is about the size of the table.
- Bread - Average ciabatta. Gotta love Batali for serving lardo as a standard spread, though the way it was seasoned had an off finish that was kind of yucky.
- 3-cheese fried cicchetti -  Complimentary, but too salty, not cheesy enough.
- Grilled octopus - smokey, acidic, delicious the best thing we had.
- Spago w/ lamb ragu - the small portion is perfect for a one person app. I don't do lamb, but took this on a recommendation, it was not bad -  but by no means Batali's good pasta, go to NYC for that.
- Sweetbreads - Very good - I love it when they are not battered. they were juicy, a bit smokey. The polenta cake (or something like one) and grilled corn were SO good. 
- Semifreddo - Very smooth and I like the pistachio brown butter, but super sweet. Nice with the chocolate crumbs underneath. Good, not great.

Overpriced? Yes, by about 20%. Dining here is just another expectations thing - at the end of the day, B&B are the restauranteurs, not the chefs.

Best restaurant and experience I've had in Vegas ever! The service was phenomenal and so accommodating.  It was so amazing and I am a foodie! Everything is Italian coursed so you get to try a lot of things. Also the drinks were fabulous! We all started with a blood orange cosmo. It was so fresh and delicious!

We got the octopus to start. It was the best octopus I have ever had! You could use a fork to cut it and that is saying something. It was the most well cooked octopus I have ever had. The sauce was acidic with notes of salt and sweetness. Perfect balance. 

Then we had the bucatini all'amatriciana, I previously had this had his restaurant Otto and it was delicious! The pasta was cooked to a perfect al dente and you have pieces of onion and guanciale running through it. My favorite part was the slight heat in the background from fresco chili peppers.

Last but not least we had the dry-aged bone in rib eye and split it between 3 of us. The presentation was fabulous! It was table side and she cut it to perfection. To top it off, they drizzled extra virgin olive oil over it. Also you can eat off the bone and they encourage it lol! The sides we chose were the mascarpone mashed potatoes and the saut√©ed spinach. These were the best potatoes I've had. They are laced with mascarpone and come in a little cast iron skillet. To top it off, there is a poached egg that is mixed with it, AMAZING! The saut√©ed spinach has a hint of chili and garlic in it.

We were too full for dessert, but each had a glass of fresh limoncello. It was refreshing, but strong! That will put hair on your chest lol.

The steak was presented Tomahawk style and then sliced evenly between my friend and I.  The steak was prepared perfectly and tasted great.  The waiter encouraged me to finish the rest from the bone by hand.  I did and it was awseome.  The Poached Egg and Mashed Potatoes were suprisingly very good.   You take a fork to open the egg that is set atop of the mashed potatoes and mix it into the potatoes. 

My wife had the New York Steak.  It was not as tender as the Ribeye, but was were very flavorful.  

The only flaw and it's a minor one; the life sized cow at the entrance inside.  The rear of the cow buts (No pun intended) onto the first table.  So at least one guest will have a cow's rear end right besides them during dinner.

The one thing that really stood out to me was the pork fat spread that they give you with bread.  It blew my mind and my taste buds away.  When the waiter introduced it to us as pork fat I kind of cringed, but once it went in my mouth, I wanted more!!  (that's what she said)

Since Batali is known for his Italian food, we had to get some kind of pasta.  The BF and I ordered the gnocchi bolognese to start, and it was good.  For $16 I wouldn't get it again, but it was tasty.  Our friends shared the ricotta and egg raviolo because they had heard a lot about it, and they thought it was just ""interesting.""  I took that as a, ""Won't get it again.""

They have a guy come out with a huge cutting board and knife, and he slices it for you.  Trust me, it is necessary.  This thing was the size of my thorax.  It was very simply seasoned, but it was quality beef so there was enough flavor there to satisfy me.  I know that they want you to really savor the natural flavors of the beef, but it would have been a solid 4 stars with a teeny tiny bit more flavor.

My friends LOVED their lamb.  They are both hardcore lamb eaters, and they said that this was the best lamb they have EVER eaten.  If you like lamb at all, I would definitely suggest ordering that.  We also tried the potato and parmesan zeppole side order, and I thought those were really good.  I've never had anything like it, so I enjoyed them a lot.

I'll probably come back again to try more stuff when I'm ballin', but that won't be for at least a couple of years.  Damn you grad. school!",mCd7pk8FqvlUD4Tkh8wiKw,1,1,3,OPd_TTkagGj_bKCvCDRoPA

I asked to add chicken. The salad was $16. He stated that it would be $25 to add chicken. So I ordered it with Chicken. The salad was decent but it was drenched so heavily with dressing. ( I didnt mention it and politely continued with my meal).  

The sticking point was when the check came: I was charged $16 for the salad and an additional $25 for a small piece of chicken. Upon the sticker shock, I pointed out that the server didn't say an additional $25.  $41 for a luncheon salad? I don't think so  During my next business trips, I'll go elsewhere on the strip for a fraction of the cost.",k8lcHQcepSU46MRE9cOVYQ,3,0,3,yPiNSNZZft3wjnn-W0LtaQ
5723921,2013-12-06,0,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"I saw this place featured on Rachel Ray's vacation and could not wait to try it!  Carne Vino translates simply into meat and wine. 

FOOD
Order the 'La Fiorentina' (~$70/person). They carve the meat right beside your table and even have their own personalized steak knives with their name Carne Vino on it. Impressive. 

We also added a 'Black Truffle Vinaigrette"" ($5) sauce to go with the meat. It was good, but didn't add that much more flavor to the meat. SKIP.

Each slice of juicy meat literally melts in your mouth and I really wanted another order. But seeing that my mom and I had already spent $140 on just the meat..we decided to just move onto dessert...

We chose the 'Peach and Blackberry Tart' ($12), which had a hazelnut crust. The presentation was wonderful, but the peach and blackberry didn't seem to go together that well. A little more tart that I expected. SKIP.

TIP
It is located inside Palazzo in Las Vegas. Make a reservation.

5725930,2017-02-04,0,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"The service was excellent and the food was spectacular. We made reservations the day before and the had room for an early dinner. Keep in mind that they open for dinner at 5pm. If you have tickets to see a show (which we did for a 7pm show) let the server know and they try to accommodate. Luckily we were there on a weekday just after new year's and it wasn't too crowded. 
First,  the food... they had the riserva rib eye (the reason why I chose the restaurant in the 1st place) and we decided to get an order of the Riserva and their regular rib eye to compare. There was only 3 of us and we don't really eat a ton of food so instead of the Ribeye for two, I asked if we can order ""for one"". It's not on the menu but they do have it. It was very good and kind of different that they cut the meat for you at the table. It's a fair price for the quality of food that you get and a very generous portion. The Riserva = EXCELLENT!!! I love ribeyes in general and this was by far one of the best ones I've ever had in my life. I love how the servers explain everything as they serve the meat into a pretty presentation but also explain which part of the Ribeye they're cutting, how it tastes, etc... the octopus appetizers are really really good - definitely worth a try. I loved the roasted beets and mashed potatoes but didn't see anything special with the mushrooms. The wine list was like an encyclopedia and I didn't want to read through it all, so I asked my server for a recommendation,  which turned out to be excellent as well.
The service... I don't know about other servers but my server was one of the BEST servers I've ever had.  He not only knew exactly what the food was like, how it was prepared and which wines went well with the food but was very friendly, accommodating and fun without being around the table too much (you know when the server is there every 2 minutes and you don't  even have time to taste the food before they come around asking how's the food). He was there enough that I didn't have to call for him but not so much that I couldn't enjoy the food and my company. When I talked with the floor manager before I left, he seemed to get that complement all the time.
All in all, yes, it was a pricey meal, but really you'd have to pay at least that much for any top rated meat place with wine. I would highly recommend you go and experience it at least once - the riserva really is worth it, but be sure to call ahead and see if they have it, as they don't always have it that day.",gIUbjvWGOzAn3Lc5M1qmiw,0,0,5,05l4XxpMi-sZj3ZJUEddPA

Everything is ala carte meaning you order all your appz, sides, entrees, salads and so on separately. We first tried the BIG EYE TUNA 'CRUDO'-raw tuna sashimi with radish and cucumber...BOMB I love tuna. The cuts were from leanest to fattiest portions. The fatty tuna melted in your mouth.  The ponzo sauce and the micro greens were perfecto. 
    Then we had our sides: SPAGHETTI AI FRUTTI DI MARE-slightly spicy with clams, giant shrimp, lobster, crab, and calamari=so good seafood fresh flavor came thru here and pasta was aldente. TORTELLONI lobster and tarragon= Oh my this was excellent. I dint love lobster that much but the mixture in this pasta was great. 
   Now for the MEATS!!! We tried 3 different types of meat all medium. We first tried the Dry Aged Bone-in Rib Eye... HOLY !*@* this cut was so good. No sauce or anything and it was so juicy and tasty as if it was drenched in some forbidden jucie from the gods.... Yeah its liek that!!! The person that cut the meat was even wearing a full suit and looked like a manager rather then a waiter. DAMN so fancy shamancy!! Next we tried the ""La Florentina"" which is  a Florentine porterhouse. GETDAFUKOUTAHERE!!! That right there was my overall favorite and the best cut of meat I have ever had in my life. It was so tender I only had to take a few gentle slices and it was cut. The flavor was so good I literally took another piece while my first bite was in my mouth. Hahahah What a savage bastard I am, me eat my meats (grunts)!!! We also ordered the mixed grill which was an assortment of pork belly, Madagascar grill shrimp, and bison sausage. The pork belly was awesome it literally melted in your mouth and had this tangy/bbq sauce on it which was yumm-o. The Madagascar shrimp was the size of my hand it was huge it wasn't great but it was good. The sausage was probably the least liked. It had a very gamey taste that none of us liked BUT we still finished it. Our sides were creamed spinach, mushrooms, and mascarpone mashed potatoes. This place was so good we just sat there in amazement for 2 hrs. We were so stuffed we didn't even order any desert. Service also deserves the full 5 stars.

5761691,2012-01-30,0,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"I had dinner here on a Friday night with my wife.  8:30pm seating.
All I can say considering some of the other good reviews is that we must have hit it a bad night, time and server.  We were seated on time.  Place was jumping full.  Music was pumping.  Restaurant or club?  Our bus boy tried to entertain us while our waiter was nowhere to be found.  About 15 minutes later, we'd had a few refills of our water and ordered and received a bottle of wine from the Som. when our waiter finally showed up.  He turned out to be particularly annoying like he'd taken a happy pill. 
A good laugh was had when the guy who brought our bread and butter described the butter and second dish of salted lard.  We looked at him questioning the lard and he stated he'd never tasted it thinking it was disgusting and questioned why they served it.  His honesty was great and pretty much set the tone for the night.  I tasted it and it's not good.  Lard?!?!
Funny thing, as we were finishing our appetizer of pretty good fried calamari but, not yet finished, I saw our bus boy walk by with our entrees.  He found somebody to set our table for the entrees and ask if we were finished with the calamari.  The timing and obviousness of all this was unfortunate.  Anyway, the two filets we had were good but not great.  I know this is Vegas but at $50 an 8oz filet they better be really good. 
The rest was uneventful and we left convinced we'll not be back.  Sorry Mario.  Kick it up a notch.",18oxjOTgXtUK0O068vOQDA,0,0,2,zvBTn96__Bts3SNqshnz5g
5764977,2016-11-08,0,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"Ate here with a group of 9 recently for my sister and her husband's 40th birthdays.  First shock - there was not a single bottle of red wine on the menu for under $100.  I'm all for expensive red wine on a special occasion, but when ordering for 9 people, it becomes a bit expensive to spend $300 and $400 on bottles of wine for the table.  And, there are a very select wines available for ordering by the glass, which again, have an insane markup.  Second shock- the price of the food vs. quality.  And yes, we did look at the prices beforehand so knew what to expect, but compared to the quality, the price is not worth it.  Several at our table ordered steaks and they came out lukewarm and lacked any seasoning.  For steaks carrying price tags of $50, $70, and $170, I expected so much more.  I ordered pasta and it arrived lukewarm, and was not worth the $20 to $30 price tag per item.  Third shock - the service.  When you are paying as much as your are for the food and booze at this place, one would expect exceptional service but alas no.  We were ignored for most of the evening and had to ask our server for water and wine refills.

The slow braised octopus with Limoncello and hot peppers is one of the best tasting octopus plates I've ever had. In the top two next to a fresh catch in Greece.

Even though not listed on the menu, they offer a bone-in rib eye for one. It arrived seasoned and cooked perfectly. The perfect weapon of a steak knife, effortlessly cut through the dry aged steak - allowing for surgical precision to get all the meat off the bone.

i did get sick of the steak after a little while, but maybe it was because we ordered so much food.

DO - Tell them how you like your steak
they tend to cook their steaks a little on the rare side, so when ordering, you should always tell them exactly how you want it based on color.

DON'T - Let them choose a wine for you
they are going to try to sell you whatever over priced bottle they can find. you are better off picking one yourself... if you don't like the taste, be sure to send it back.",xWCDD4AVIVjDfLZp5Qc5yQ,3,0,4,lmQ4Dy9mXdjI-7PcJ56heA
5781136,2011-12-29,0,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"I would say my experience here was an outlier.  My party gave the waiter carte blanc about the meal we wanted to eat tonight.  With a little bit of a lot of alcohol I am sure we were taken advantage of. Our meal topped out with tip above a grand.  Please be sure to not buy what ever remainder of truffle they may want to sell you by the gram.  The shaving over whatever you shave it on after you drank as much as we did won't make any difference to your already blunted senses.  I think we paid for the 10grams of truffle $150. We probably used 2-3 grams on our food and did even bother to take the rest home.  

The waiter brought out several things on or off the menu per our preferences.  We told him before hand that we like meat and pasta.  We also told him, them, whom ever was taking care of us, that if they saw the glass less than 3/4 full that they need to be johnny on the spot with the refills.  They were a bit slow on that but its not like we noticed.

I am not exactly sure what we ordered but I will describe them and if you find that it is something you want to try then you might be able to describe it.

We ordered the prociutto, carne cruda, and bison carpaccio for starters.  I was not a fan of the prociutto which I thought was cut to thin to handle. The cruda was terrific.  

We also ordered the ravioli and the wet aged beef with the quail egg.  My personal opinion is that the beef with quail egg was the best part of the meal.  The ravioli was soft and filling.  We also ordered the beef that came out with a giant rib that sits on the table.  When we walked into the restaurant a gentleman was actually eating from this rib that resembled a dinosaur rib that was stolen from some natural history museum.  

At this point we were into a second bottle of wine.  What was interesting which I thought was a nice touch is that they opened the wine and poured it into a decantur.  All other restaurants I have been too did not do this and this was different and kind of cool.  

Of note, try the lardo.  It is the fat off a pigs back. If anyone has read the book ""Heat"" which is written by a food journalist who worked out of Mario Batoli's kitchen in New York knows what I am talking about.  The journalist describes lardo quite well.  My friends thought this to be a bit heavy and thought it was lard.  It is not.  It does kind of have a tang to it but its good and worth trying.

You certainly don' have to spend a fortune to eat here.  We overendulged ourselves and made the most of it.  I liked it and the staff was eager to please but its probably because we kept ordering stuff.

5794968,2012-03-27,0,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"For the price, very disappointing. In short:
1. We had 9PM reservations on a Friday night. It wasn't overly crowded. The server handed us a giant menu/wine list and provided an overview of how it was set up. We ordered a cocktail and started to look over the menu. We were asked 3 times in less than 10 minutes if we were ready to order. ""Ready yet?"" ""Ready yet?""  -- It's annoying to be so rushed when the place is not that busy and the menu is quite large. Who wants to drop $400 for a 2-top and feel like you are getting pushed out the door from the minute you get there? 
2. Beef is touted as their specialty. I found it disappointing that the only options were a porterhouse for two ($160), ribeye for two ($140), a strip at $61 or a fillet. So, if you are not sharing with someone, your only options are a strip or a fillet. (And, when paying top $$$ for what is supposed to be great beef, do you really want to order a fillet????) By elimination, I ordered the strip. It was okay. It wasn't great, it wasn't poor by any means, but just average. Maybe because I am from Chicago and we are so lucky in the Midwest to have the best beef in the country, I expect more from expensive steakhouses than just ""okay"". I appreciate beef raised well, aged well and prepared well (the animals and the labor) and charging a bunch doesn't make a great piece of meat.
3. Other food: We ordered the pastrami appetizer, which was delicious. However, on the thinly sliced pastrami and greens was a very large duck egg. This struck me as odd because it was such a large portion of the entire dish (the pastrami looked like an accompaniment), and it was not mentioned on the menu or by our server. We like eggs, but if you didn't, I could imagine that you would be really unhappy... We had one side dish, the fregola/fava bean/peas, and it was delicious.  My husband had the bread and lardo and thought both were great. 
4. We worked with the sommelier  to choose a bottle of wine. Neither my husband nor I know Italian wines very well, but we had a great conversation with the sommelier  about what we do know and like and he pointed us in the perfect direction. Down to earth, very knowledgeable and easy conversationalist - in my opinion, a great sommelier. 
5. Lastly, after dinner, we stopped at the bar for an Amaro (which I love). The bar tender not only knew her Amaro, but helped me navigate a couple I had not tried, gave me an amaro-based cocktail she personally created and multiple tastes (for no charge). Like the sommelier, she was knowledgeable, personable and we had a lovely time with her. 
Summary: Good steak places are expensive. I get that. When a steak place has these charges, I expect the best and don't want to be rushed around like I'm at a buffet. $200/person should get you a better option of cuts and an attentive, non-rushed experience. That is not too much to ask for, even in Vegas. If what you really want is a good steak, go someplace else. If you want to say you ate at a Mario Batali restaurant, pay close attention to prices and order carefully.",8IQd8sdAxiKWnG9tO0YCRA,0,0,2,PYbjONGCryghT4uM2kMzYQ

5837937,2011-06-13,0,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"I dined at Mario Batali's and Joe Bastianich's Carnevino recently at The Palazzo with my wife and son, and the dry-aged bone-in ribeye was the very best steak I have ever tasted--and I have sampled quite a few on my quest to find the finest steak in Las Vegas.  In fact, I supped at Santa Fe Station's Charcoal Room and Del Frisco's Double Eagle Steakhouse within two weeks of my venture to Carnevino, and at N9NE inside Palms and Union within Aria at City Center not long afterward.  All four dining establishments served excellent, well-prepared steaks--but not on a par with what Carnevino produced.  The same is true of earlier ventures to Emeril Lagasse's Delmonico Steakhouse in the neighboring Venetian and Golden Steer on Sahara Avenue near the Stratosphere.  Thus far, Stripsteak at Mandalay Bay comes the closest.  When chewing on the tender morsels of medium-rare meat, Carnevino's dry-aged ribeye yielded deep, rich, pleasing, and penetrating bursts of flavor that is difficult to describe in words, and the pasta that preceded it (Potato Gnocchi Bolognese and Pappardelle Noodles with a delicate Mushroom Sauce) was very clean-tasting and refined.  I hope to return for lunch there soon just to savor the pasta again.  One can only eat steak so often before the body's cholesterol level will jump skyward!  But the well-aged ribeye at Carnevino will definitely be experienced again after a respectable break.  It is something to savor more than once, and to treasure each time. 

Complimentary doughy cheese puff balls were an appreciated amuse-bouche from the chef.  But I still prefer butter on my warm bread to offered lardo.  Bearnaise Sauce was excellent; Gorgonzola Mascarpone less so only because its strong flavor tended to dominate rather than harmonize with the meat.  Warm Apple Fritters served with refreshing Vanilla Bean and Chocolate Gelato topped off a great meal.  I am glad that we took the advice of our server to place only a single order for two of dry-aged bone-in ribeye, which yielded about 40 ounces of meat.  This amount of prime beef proved to be more than adequate to feed three hungry diners-especially with two pastas and two vegetable sides to share.  Ambiance was that of a clubby, white-table-clothed steakhouse in a spacious setting that featured a labyrinth of rooms; and service was friendly, helpful, and attentive.

We had the ravioli with brown sage butter and the beef agnolotti. The ravioli was superb - seriously, I have never had anything like that before. It's an appetizer so it was just one large ravioli, but it was beautifully plated and was the perfect balance of salty sweet. Very unusual, and very delicious.

The beef agnolotti was also excellent. The filling was rich and tender, the pasta was well cooked, and the sauce was simple and delicious.

First off, I'm a big fan of Osteria Mozza (another Mario Batali joint).  Came here for a bachelor party and was hoping this place would live up to Mozza.  I got the Black Fettuccine and Grilled Halibut.  I also took a couple slices of the bone-in rib eye that was $72/person (serves 2).  

I really enjoyed the Black Fettuccine.  The flavor of the crab was just perfect, not overwhelming or underwhelming.  If I remember correctly, this was an appetizer.  

Grilled Halibut was ok...nothing special.  Didn't wow me at all.  Maybe this was put on the menu for non beef eaters.  

Slices of the rib-eye were disappointing compared to the bone-in rib-eye at Osteria Mozza.  The texture and flavors were better at Mozza.  Maybe if I never went to Osteria Mozza, I would be impressed.  

I will definitely give this place a try again.  I had a slice of filet mignon too but it was too small of sample to give it a definitive judgement.  I liked the slice of filet mignon (non bone-in) that I had.",APADRUvjy2nYd2171oaJTw,0,0,3,wYahGeXnTrY5dyRWVqXb1Q

5892629,2016-07-01,0,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"Summary: While the food is just OK, the service and ambiance leaves MUCH to be desired.  I feel like saying, ""This place is overrated,"" but I realize if you look at the star distribution here on yelp, it's quite telling that this place is a FAR cry from what they pretend to be (a great restaurant).  As such, there is no reasonable relationship between the mediocre food, the horrible service, and the extremely high prices.  Not going back - there are too many good places for us to waste our time here ever again.

Details:

Server came once or twice to take our order, and a team of other people brought the food, water, bread, etc.  A great system - except for the fact that when we were finished eating our main courses, dirty dishes were left in front of us for about 40 minutes:  our server would walk by, serve other tables, and not take them (or notify someone else to take them).

The bread - soft when it was hot (immediately after serving); after about 5 minutes, as it cooled, it became the consistency of a hard sponge - inedible.

Two sides came with the bread:  butter & pig-fat.  The butter was good (like any normal butter would be), but the pig fat tasted like... nothing.  We have eaten a lot of pig fat in all different forms, and are familiar with the taste.  This one did not taste like pig fat (I'm not doubting it was, but it must have been highly processed one way or another).

Dessert - We ordered the tiramisu.  One layer tasted, as my wife put it, ""like cheesecake frosting.""  To me, it tasted like a combination of yogurt/sugar/cream cheese/frosting.  It was a thick layer and neither of us could stomach the overbearing sweetness/thickness of it.   They told us afterwards that it was some ""cheesecake"" layer.  The only decent part of the tiramisu were the layers of breading - the other parts (cream, cheesecake-stuff, etc.), we scraped off and left behind.  Pathetic for being so expensive.

Ambiance - The STRANGEST and most INAPPROPRIATE ""music"" for this setting.  We heard a strange mixure of hip-hop, trance, etc.  The music kept changing, and at times it felt like we were in a bad neighborhood.  Curious, I remarked to one of employees that the music was strange.  His explanation was that the owner of the restaurant's goal was for ""you to feel like you were a guest in his own livingroom,"" and thus he played music he liked.  Our impression?:  FAIL.

Salt and Pepper - No salt and pepper shakers.  Had to request salt, which was brought in a little bowl with no spoon, for us to pinch out of.  No big deal.  But the pepper?  Pretty funny, I thought:  when I asked for pepper, a pepper-grinder was produced, and he said, ""where do you want me to grind the pepper?""  I told him I just needed it for general use.  Thus, he left and came back with a tiny little bowl where he had ground pepper into.  (This is not a complaint, just relaying facts - we are aware there are many restaurants that feel offended or threatened by a customer asking for some additional seasoning(s)).

Grilled Octopus - not bad.  But not incredible.  We are spoiled from the ""real deal"" in Mexico, but this was better than the ""rubbery"" ones I've had in the U.S. before.  In any case, the taste was delicious, although the texture was ""tough"" for my taste (but if you are used to rubbery octopuses, then it'll be ""soft"" for your taste, right?).  I was just disappointed with the serving size:  a few chunks (if you are imaging what an octopus looks like, the serving looks nothing like that - instead picture half a hot dog and a few tater-tots of serving size).

Pasta with mushrooms - was excellent!  

Steak - excellent! We really liked how it was presented - cut at the table into slices for us.

Beets - delicious, but super, super oily.  The left-overs (which we got to-go) were sitting in a huge puddle of oil the next morning.

Mashed potatoes - very good!

Service, overall - the ""water boy"" was actually excellent - and he is the one that really deserved a good tip.  He really picked up the slack from our server.  He was attentive, and brought us things we needed, as well as asking us if we needed anything else.  Our main server, as I mentioned above, was only at our table a few times, and pretty much ignored us.  This place pretends to be high-end and sophisticated, but the service absolutely does not reflect that fascade.  For example, crumbs from our bread were never brushed off the table for the entire dinner.

Overall Experience - the overall experience was not very good.  This place can't be considered ""romantic,"" or ""hip,"" or a ""caf√©,"" - the music ruins the environment.  There is also a huge (metal?) bull in the middle of the restaurant - which to me looked like a desperate attempt to give this place any character - without the bull the room is a plain, rectangular, room with the d√©cor which might belong to Marie Callender's living room.",WFcDOsTSZwOHE77H_bL1fA,0,0,3,uILsRVqtDBuru32NGRZY3w

Between 3 of us, we shared an order of ""La Florentina"" (which serves 2), a side of broccoli and a pasta side.  The pasta, the Bucantini all amatriciana, was delicious.  The waiter mentioned that this pasta is Mario Batalli's favorite pasta, and I would highly recommend this.  The Broccoli was delicious as well.  

When the steak is ready to be served, the waiter will push a cart and take the steak out of the oven they use to keep warm as they transport it from kitchen to your table.  Carved fresh at your table, your mouth will start salivating at the sight.  

The food was amazing and the service was impeccable.  However, my only gripe about this place is the price.  But that's not going to stop me from coming here again.

p.s. One more thing: they have this thing called ""La Reserva"", These are special cuts that make it past the normal 90 day aging process (yeah, like 90 days is NORMAL).

Pork chops were ordered and wow..I was told hat is was the absolute best that they've ever had.  My seafood stew of sorts was good.  

The ugly: the staff here too pretentious to their detriment.

The lunch service was absolutely horrible, but the dinner service was INCREDIBLE... so they get a ""push"" on that one.

Ordered:

Egg & ricotta ravoli - This is a dish stolen from Osteria Mozza (another of Batali's restaurants in LA), and the Carnevino version was exactly the same, GREAT. 

Veal Saltimbocca - This was just ok.

Burger - was expecting a lot more from Batali!

Oh also of note - at lunch they squish you into little bar tables that don't have room for all of your food, and the menu is VERY limited. 

Also neither was cheap... I think my burger at lunch time was 19 bucks!

Verdict: I'd go back here for dinner but it wouldn't be my first choice. Definitely would not go back for lunch.",AtlQMOcdGwM90Tq5CcYEpA,0,0,3,TEsXDcEQ9yOKuYRBsUlleA
5964765,2013-01-27,0,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"We had a reservation for 10 people.... it was 20 minutes before we were served water. 45 minutes before we had a cocktail...1 hour before they took an order which in it self was a process! They insisted we do family style...we agreed being easy. They tried to sell us seven different styles of meat.  We had to insist on other dishes to please everyone at the table. The appetizers came out and each person started out with one or two clams, by the time it came around to me I had One. The gnocchi came out and again everyone had three by the time it came around my husband and I had one. We ordered a second round of gnocchi and again we had one gnocchi.  The steak was so rare, it looked as if if was right off of the animal.  Not everyone cares for their steak raw, they could have asked us if anyone needed their steak cooked more.  Meanwhile, it was so loud we could hardly speak to the person next to you let alone the person across from you. My husband kept being knocked into by the waiters, as it was tight for the waiters to get through the tables. All in all the service was horrific. We spent generously with only two bottles of wine our bill was $2100 with a %20 tip included. The lamb chops were divine! That was all I had one Lamb chop.  My husband felt the meat had Aged far too long, and the taste was ""tainted""  Not one person at the table had a nice comment on the meat that was served. The waiters were rude and over worked.  I kept looking or borrowing a fork.  The service was just terrible.   What a bummer for a big dinner party.  Money was no object for us.  We were incredibly disappointed in this restaurant. Our miserable experience took a total of three hours.",-gXGwfSNV-t_IFvuI4XGQg,3,0,1,fizAOCiptqIub9DkN-pxnw
5965539,2015-01-06,0,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"Carnevino is a great steakhouse at a great property in Las Vegas. I was suggested this place by a good friend and it lived up to the hype. All courses were excellent, from the calamari to their in-house made peanut butter in the peanut butter torte everything was spot on!

I had the New York strip which was bone-in and prepared just right. The meat near the bone was very flavorful and the waiter encouraged me to pick it up and eat off the bone caveman style!

My girl ordered the filet which I had to try on principal. The cut was also flavorful and melted in your mouth.

For sides, we had the mashed potatoes which comes with a fried-egg folded in to the dish, the eggplant and brussel sprouts. All of which added a great and flavorful compliment to the meat.

Finally, the dessert was an unexpected cap to a great meal so I highly suggest trying to peanut butter torte.

Our server was Julio and his helper was Michelle (I believe); both very knowledgable and added to a great experience.

Also, one must remember this is an Italian steakhouse so they also serve many pasta dishes and other meats like veal and lamb. That said, the cuts of beef may seem limited compared to other places.

Overall, I put Carnevino on the same level with any other steakhouse in Vegas.

Thanks,

I had the cowboy cut Ribeye for one ($95). My wife and one of our daughters had the filet ($55 each) and my other daughter had the butterfly pork chop ($45). The sides were excellent. Salads fantastic. Wow, and the yukon gold garlic mashed potatoes with marscapone and an egg on top was unbelievable!

5973650,2011-11-07,0,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"I had a horrible experience while dining at Carnevino last week. I was there with a party of eight people and our evening began without issue. However, things quickly went downhill after our appetizers came out. About fifteen minutes after our appetizers were cleared, a team of staff made a big show of bringing us new silverware for our main course. We expected that the main courses would be out shortly.  Everyone at the table was being patient, as we waited ten, then fifteen, then twenty minutes without any food. At this point, it had been over thirty minutes since our appetizers were cleared and frustration began to mount. Our server was nowhere to be found during this time, which exacerbated the situation, as we were left to wonder what was going on. Finally, the server came out, and I asked him what the problem was. He laughed and said that the food would be just a couple of minutes, then disappeared again. Ten minutes after this, still without food, is when I got really upset. Whatever the reason for the delay was, I would have preferred that our server had been honest with us about the situation, as opposed to laughing it off and lying about when the meal would be arriving. I left the table and went to the front desk to ask for a manager. I let the manager know our dissatisfaction. He apologized for the delay and offered us a complimentary pasta course while we waited. I accepted and went back to the table.  It was at this time that another manager came to the table to speak with me. This manager, Richard Douglass, immediately approached the situation in a confrontational manner, as if he was the wronged party somehow. At this point, I was very upset about how the evening had gone and I asked Mr. Douglass what was going on. He offered a series of insincere and condescending apologies, almost mocking me as our conversation continued. Mr. Douglass was treating the situation as if I was some petulant child that wasn't getting my way, as opposed to a diner that wanted nothing more than my very expensive meal to arrive in an appropriate timeframe. Mr. Douglas continued with his pompous attitude, without any appreciation of my concerns, instead pointing out that he did offer us complimentary pasta. I told him that he didn't get it, we didn't want pasta that we didn't order in the first place, we wanted our main course. He said, ""fine, if you don't want the pasta then we won't bring it out."" Our conversation continued and I asked him why it had been close to an hour since our appetizers were cleared and we were still without our main course. He said that it had only been thirty minutes. I told him no, it had been almost sixty minutes. He said, ""sir, it has been half an hour. If you are going to argue with me about this, then this conversation is over."" As upset as I was, I could tell that Mr. Douglass simply did not care and this conversation wasn't going anywhere so I said, ""fine, the conversation is over."" Amazingly, after all of this, it still took another ten minutes for our food to arrive. It so happened that the food was quite ordinary, but even if it was amazing, my meal had been ruined at this point. The bill came, and the best part was that because we were a party of eight, an automatic twenty percent gratuity was added to the bill. So the server got twenty percent of a close to $900 bill for basically abandoning ship once the problems started. On the way out of the restaurant, I again exchanged words with Mr. Douglass, explaining to him that I would be writing a letter to the corporate manager about the situation.

I was in Las Vegas all week for a business convention, and the next morning I went to breakfast with some business associates. I brought up my experience from the previous evening, and one of the other men that I was with said he was at Carnevino two nights earlier and had the same exact problem. The food was very slow coming out, and he got into a similar argument with Richard Douglass about the situation. I hope that the Batali group receives enough negative feedback about Mr. Douglass and that something is done about the situation because the way that he treated our party that evening was nothing short of disgusting. Whether you are paying $20 for a meal or $1,000, the customer should be treated with some respect, not as though the restaurant is the one doing the customer the favor.",lPS6Wc_iTuFA5Wdvrhtrfw,3,0,1,FSOxe0r2nkHt1AV1vGFKew

The truffle pasta was just ok. Nothing outstanding about it and so a disappointment considering the price.  The salad was very good. Oh skip the mashed potatoes. Not good. In fact maybe skip everything else and just order two steaks and meat it up.",p_J_rWlY5wFckif4UMcuTg,0,0,4,O5Hd2K6BXkYREQ1eBdSPqg

5981260,2017-04-01,0,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"I'm shocked to see lower reviews here. Our dinner experience last night was second to none. We had numerous staff attending to us. Their knowledge of the menu and recommendations were ON POINT. The mozzarella on the Caprese salad was unbelievably fresh. We had the seafood pasta which had huge, fresh prawns, calamari, muscles.....the tomato sauce was so fresh as well. Not too acidic. The beef cheek ravioli was flavor packed and light. The grilled octopus was prepared perfectly. Not chewy at all with a wonderful balsamic reduction and micro greens. Of course, the steak was the coup de gras. I'm a Texas girl so I pride myself on knowing a great steak. The reviews on here that state the steak was ""nothing special"" perplex me. As they were carving the steak at our table, the staff explained the different flavor profiles of each cut. I was in heaven. And, to take it one step further, there was a poached egg sitting atop the marscyepone mashed potatoes. Decadent. Chef Nicole Brisson and her staff did not disappoint.",YM438SwX858ctwpaD6IHtw,0,0,5,vfMbdFdAS-Orv18zjGLbDA

He was helpful, polite and prompt. Another nice gentleman brought out a sample appetizer ""compliments of the chef"". The wine list is impressive though I was in a beer mood. Carnevino didn't disappoint. I had an Italian beer that Jared recommended. Then a Estrella Inedit, so smooth and good (Jared recommended). I had the filet. It was great. I'm a freak who likes her filet well done so the center was too rare for me but the outside was delicious.  The only bad thing were the hostesses.",zMPNsWn_M4ocUbkHs98F9A,0,0,5,R8_lCxgWHlnQ51m7n60mAw
5987737,2015-04-28,1,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"This is actually one of the more difficult reviews I've had to piece together.

Had booked a table for 7 of us a month or so in advance of a guy's trip out to Vegas.  Knew we wanted a big bold steak night and had obviously heard good things.  The steak did not disappoint.  In fact, it was the single best piece of beef I've ever had.

Obviously, this place is incredibly expensive.  I knew this going in and had zero problems.  200 dollars later (for myself), and my problems were still minimal, but present.

We ordered multiple plates of food to pass, and in addition to trying a few bites of beef cheek pasta (underwhelming) and the pork chop (slightly overcooked, but deliciously porky), I ordered the sweetbreads and the dry aged Strip.  Sweetbreads were very well cooked for the 4-5 bites that existed for the ~40 dollar price, but the accompaniments of artichoke and lemon combined to overwhelm with their astringency.  The Strip steak was magical.  The unbelievable funk that permeated the meat put me into a carnivorous coma.  Amazing, and worth the price tag.

Ordered a young bottle of Cabernet, decanted per request.  Service was numerable and polite.  Room itself is rather....bland? Certainly not the most beautiful place to eat, but try and forget whilst focusing on your steak.  If you're not planning on ordering the steak, make reservations somewhere else.  But if you're in the mood to ravage like a carnivore with a bottle of red, this is your place.",SzANwTg5VIfUQW2t5ru6SA,1,2,4,nuRemS8ftffCNTxijNoqYA
5993561,2012-01-30,0,7fxebHYUwIF6CakxSr70iQ,"We came here for lunch on a Saturday.  I was craving a hamburger, so when I saw a hamburger on the menu, I was thrilled. 

The burger comes with house cured pancetta and sweet gorgonzola and I added the garlic fries.  My burger was so good, it was cooked to my desired temperature and it was so juicy.  The garlic fries were ok.  I was expecting just that; fries!  But they are (possibly) baked fingerling potatoes with fries, parsley, and parm cheese- still I am not complaining, but I guess I was just in the mood for french fries and some added garlic sounded even better.

My boyfriend had the house-made pastrami.  Ohh hell's yeah! Very tasty but i liked my burger better.  My burger was fatty and delicious.  I was full the whole entire day.  So lady's, if you have a small stomach like mine and are planing on having dinner later on  have two bites because you will not be able to move after this massive beast-of-a-burger.  

Service is great and the place I guess can be a bit expensive to some.  If you are looking for a cheap Italian place, then skip this one because you will complain after you pay, no matter if the food was beyond excellet.",1mI_WcnyKUfTX10XNey_AA,0,0,4,JwYXO0iVzUmmsUJEJyOE2g
