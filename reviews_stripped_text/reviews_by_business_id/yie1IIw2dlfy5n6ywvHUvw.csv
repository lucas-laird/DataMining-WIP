126501,2010-06-23,1,yie1IIw2dlfy5n6ywvHUvw,"This one is the closest to my house but they are all the same.  Before the new management took over the company and started sprouting shops all across the western US, Capriottis was THE best sandwich shop in Vegas. I am ashamed to say that while going to UNLV, I never once visited the Capriottis next to the campus. Had I know what was 'so great about some small sandwich shop', my college years would have been much happier.  

Anyways, the sandwiches are amazing. My favorites are the Capastrami and the famous Bobbie. If your looking for THE best hot sandwich in the world, get the Capastrami. Its loaded with pastrami and cheese, and topped with coleslaw and russian dressing ... RIDICULOUS!

 As far as cold sandwiches are concerned, nothing compares to the Bobbie. Its filled with pulled turkey meat (white and dark), stuffing, and cranberry sauce. Order the small and you'll be surprised by the nine inch sandwich they give you. Looking for a food coma? order the 20"" large. The guys and gals working are always fun, yelling ""beer money guys!"" everytime patrons leave them a tip. 

There is so much more to this little sandwich shop that I can't even begin to scratch the surface. The bread is amazing, the sandwich selections are vast and mouth-watering, the atmosphere is great, and the prices are great. Like I said, BEST in LAS VEGAS!!!!",oTkDjvlKgTWW0zCDSdTjrw,1,0,5,fO5b5JjO32sj_Zgt9QCWNQ

The music was on pretty loud while my wife and I were eating, and I got a phone call so I stepped out really quick. I was eating, and got another call, and stepped out again. I never complained about the music. Honestly not much of a complainer.... I received 2 phone calls, and stepped out two times. No big deal, in my opinion.

AND THEN:

The lady working the register said ""excuse me, when you come in and out, our door chime goes off and it makes me come up here. Can you stop coming in and out?""

So you know what: I am your customer. I tipped you $4.00 for a SANDWICH!!!! Your music is so loud I had to step outside a couple of times. Sorry I cramped your style, Capriotti's. I'm sure there is another sandwich restaurant in town that values my business.

899887,2015-10-23,0,yie1IIw2dlfy5n6ywvHUvw,"Let me begin my review by saying that normally, I would be giving Capriotti's a five star rating. My family and I have always received a warm and friendly staff response in addition to delicious subs and Italian salad. Today my husband placed an order for the wonderful Italian salad that we frequently ordered. This was also the first time we saw the new menu posted. Let me say that the salad we always ordered was more than enough for the two of us for dinner. It was large, packed with cheese and salami and garbanzo beans, in addition to onions and veggies, and large wedges of lettuce. On the new menu, the closest replacement was the Large Chopped Salad which we ordered. When my husband received the order he remarked to the manager that he did not think his wife would be very happy with the new salad. Wow! Was that an understatement! The new large chopped salad was easily half the size of our original favorite. The lettuce was chopped very finely into small pieces. The cheese and salami, what little there was of each, were chopped into tiny, tiny pieces. There were no garbanzo beans nor anything else in the salad aside from the blue cheese crumbles we requested that again, were finely chopped and lacking in quantity and quality. It tasted blah and was barely enough for one person. What a disappointment, to say the least. Although more and different salads were added to the new menu, if this is the quality they contain, I guarantee they will be a big flop. Let's hope there are no changes in the sub menu that we so enjoy or there will be nothing worth ordering. I hope this message reaches those responsible for the new menu and they realize that downsizing the quantity and quality of their offerings at the same price as before will only hurt their loyal business. I, for one, will not order a salad there again. This will cut in half the business we normally do at this establishment. What a shame.",c1yDlCGN7t-prFwgvKnGjg,1,0,1,wfooIYByWjdSgBcdXGg7EQ

The second time we tried calling, we called well before close, but they said they didn't have a delivery driver. Do they mean EVER? Is there only ONE person who can drive a car with sandwiches? What happens if their cook calls out--do they just shut the store down for the day?

This is chunks of real turkey which you will never find at any other sandwich shop. This makes me sad that I haven't eating meat. So yesterday I tried the VEGGIE CHEESESTEAK! It tastes just like the real thing. It's some soy meat stuff but it's pretty good. Kinda chewy.

Full disclosure: I have never, ever dined in at this location, nor any other Capriotti's. I rarely order at the counter either. I've found the easiest way to avoid waiting is to call in my order about 10 minutes before I get there.

My standard orders are, in no particular order: the Cheesesteak, the Chicken Cheesesteak, the Bobbie, the Capastrami, the Slaw-Be-Jo and their turkey sandwich with everything. Toppings and bread are always fresh, although the amount/ratio of toppings seems to vary from visit to visit. Love the Utz chips. Wish this location sold the large size bags of the Jalapeno ones again, though!

Friendly Tip: When you get a receipt that has the random survey code (not all receipts will have this), fill out the survey. It takes, like, 5 minutes and you get $3 off your next order.

They are greedy and charge too much,, they should lower their prices across the board and of course they make their most money off of their drinks. In fact, they charge restaurant prices so do no think it is cheap. Their Philly Cheese Steak  is the best but I was kind of disappointed in their pastrami.  If you want those in a 12"", WITHOUT any drinks or chips, you are going to pay $10! 

/I would have given it a 1 star honestly but I felt like thier food is not bad, again it is better than Subway, at least they do not heat it in a microwave. In LA and NYC you can find good deli and they charge something reasonable like $8. The portions will be the same but the quality will be better. There are way better places you can co in LV for a good sandwich, just hit up one of the casinos. You do not have to gamble. I wanted to give this place a shot because it is next to my house but I am not coming. Also, sometimes it is very hard ot place an order and pick it up, your phone does not go through, they have problems with htsi. Overall B quality on food but F on prices. I have not tried all of their things because for $10, I can go to the supermarket and get a couple of pieces of steaks. I wanted to write a long review so people are aware of the issues. Do not say I did not warn you. If you are not being served and you are picking up the food, why should I pay you those prices and you expect a tip? Here is a tip, do not be a fool, stay in school.

I talked to the general manager and he defended his side of the story instead of believing me that the sandwich was missing the ingredients. He said ""I highly doubt it could happen twice"" - Well, it did and I'm calling to tell you that it did. He offered for me to come back and have it made it again. Im already home and not going back.

Not only that, it's necessary to order double toppings because they are so cheap they will literally sprinkle on 3 shards of lettuce and call it finished. There is one guy there that can competently make a sandwich correctly, but I think they fired him because he put too many toppings on the sandwich god forbid.

5390844,2012-11-29,1,yie1IIw2dlfy5n6ywvHUvw,"Editors note:  you will more than likely learn nothing from the following review:

I've been a fan of Capriottis ever since college when I'd often walk over to their location on Maryland right next to UNLV for lunch.  Immediately I was smitten with all of the specialty subs like the Slaw Be Jo (Roast Beef with Cole Slaw), the Bobbie (Thanksgiving on a sub), and the Capastrami (Pastrami and Cole Slaw).  Eventually I branched out to become a fan of their cheesesteaks, the grilled italian, and their normal roasted turkey sandwich (I personally enjoy their turkey subs more than any other chain).

Lately this is my location of choice as it's conveniently on the way to a friend's house that I spend a lot of time watching football or playing videogames or doing things I should have stopped doing when I was 21 or younger.  

So for a while I mixed things up every time I went.  One week I'd get the Capastrami (almost always excellent), the next I might get the Bobbie (kinda burnt myself out on these a few years back, but every once in a while I go back), etc.  Lately my vice is the cheesesteak with hot peppers.  My dad is from Philly and I've been back to Philly and had genuine Philly cheesesteaks with his family there, and I gotta say this is not nearly as good as some of the ones I had there, naturally.  I do think that it holds its own, but I'm not one of those who is obsessed with finding a perfect version of regional favorites.  Sure I'd love a more authentic tasting cheesesteak, but I'm not going to knock a place like Capriottis who can get me to what I consider close enough for $8.  

So yeah, the quality at this location is pretty standard to other locations I've had.  I've never really had a bad sandwich from here.  The roast beef at most locations, including this one has seemed a little dry/tough to me.  It still tastes really good, but I prefer a softer/moister version.  Service is always fine and take-out orders are usually ready quickly which is a bonus.

One knock against several locations, and not just this one, is I've noticed there seems to be a lack of desire to deliver.  I can't really blame them because I usually am the lazy jackass on the other end of the line who doesn't want to leave the house to pick them up, so it's like a tug of war of laziness that results.   The only difference is several of these locations actually advertise delivery and then seem to always have an excuse or not want to do it unless it's an extremely large order.  To be fair, I haven't tried to arrange delivery from this one in a while, so maybe they've changed, I usually just go with takeout now.  Yeah, they won the lazy tug of war.  :(",v3YOx9T4jRSw8XP9Rd9H4g,1,1,4,0KMoP09QdlFobaFTsP4bzA

However for the past several months this location specifically has been getting skimpier and skimpier on their meat. 

I'm a simple turkey sandwich on wheat girl and when I first started ordering these a few years ago there was so much turkey on them it continually fell off. That's not a problem for me! However the last few months I have noticed there is less and less meat and the topper today was when I got my sandwich and about 30% of my bread wasn't even covered.

My husband bought me a meatball sub from this location, i got home from work late and went to eat it and choked on the insane amount of pepper in the meatballs. I mean my throat was burning. The next day we went in to talk with a manger and what a joke this was. 
This kid comes out not with a hello, or a smile or an introduction, I get what do you want?
Really? 
I explain about the horrendous amount of pepper in the meatballs, and right away he says ""we dont put peppers in our meatballs"" 
So i tell him I said pepper, like black pepper not peppers. Maybe if you would listen to me you would understand. 
He then interrupts again and says "" well i can't remake your sub without the old one, nor can I give you a refund without the receipt"" 
I told him i wasn't looking for a refund which I wasnt, I wanted him to check his food because there was an issue. 
But he could careless, he is just so full of himself because of his title of ""manager"" 
Maybe one day when he grows up he will learn how to be one.
I have learned my lesson, granted i should have known it would be like this since every time I have gone in I have never seen the same face twice, so lack of proper training, and lack of employees who care in general leads to issues every time",TmniT8S5d1rPL_6w7U7-Sg,3,0,1,3GjwLrr2KIJQtzmYBg3W0g

Came upon civilization and took our chances on Capriotti's.  It's a smallish place your order, take  seat and come up when we call your name place. 

No welcome, if fact she barely looked up.  He ordered the small (9"" cheese steak) and I ordered the black and bleu salad.  Being mostly gluten free for 10 months I try to stay that was, especially when I am traveling.  One of the ingredients in my salad was fried onions.... they were coated in flour and fried.  No problems, I just scooted them out of the dish.

It appears when a tip is added to the bill the girl at the register yells, ""Beer Money"".  Not appropriate, and I doubt she is legally old enough to drink it.

Let's just get down to business.  The place was trashed.  Trash on the floor, garbage can overflowing and I did not see one single table wiped down as we ate and other came and left.
