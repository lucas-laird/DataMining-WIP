We came for a late lunch on Labor Day weekend, so it was still a little crowded even around 1pm, a 10-minute wait.  But we got a nice table by the fountains and strip club, so it was pleasing for both parties. :)

The food seemed a little 'meh', to put it best.  It was very run-of-the-mill island bar fare.  Basically their take on ""Hawaiian"" burgers is to put bacon or avocados on everything, with a slice of pineapple on the side.  Last time I checked, that really doesn't have very much to do with the beautiful islands of Hawai'i at all.  Neither does the Buffalo Burger, which we ordered.

The burger came out medium rare, which was nice.  Although, my girlfriend did later complain about some stomach pains, which made it a tough day.

The prices here are going to be resort prices - you can get better just by walking around in Vegas, and I suggest you do, unless you're absolutely set on eating at the Miracle Mile Shops.",MgcNSSImk3Qib_ENLK1pKg,0,0,2,AFsaHXx1J-PxgbXbr7-NSw

We were drawn to the restaurant by the promise of a good breakfast deal which is what we got. The food was cheap and just general diner breakfast food nothing very special but nothing objectionable. The worst part was the service. Service was super slow and took very long to come take our order or get refills on our drinks. Keep in mind this was at like 10 AM and the restaurant was near empty.

I knew it was gonna suck when they didnt ask me how I wanted my meat cooked. Our waiter was pretty freaking lame too. I would only come back for an order of chilli fries and a beer.

 Id recomend Burger Bar at Mandalay bay ten fold over this place. If your in the mall Id go but dont order a burger get a chicken breast sandwich, salad, or something else. How a place called cheeseburger land have such terrible burger meat?

311036,2014-07-11,0,db04aHdl79B5OUo_tknYZw,"My family decided to come here for breakfast after hearing about their $6 breakfast special which is a huge deal after facing all the expensive tourist prices in Vegas. The special came with hash browns, eggs(of your choice), toast(you pick the bread), your choice of ham, bacon, or sausage, coffee, and a slice of pineapple(for the Hawaiian themed restaurant). The plates looked very presentable, the staff were friendly, and the coffee was good.....but the food not so much. I got scrambled eggs that tasted like straight up butter and was very undercooked. I gave my piece of ham to my mom since I'm not a meat person in the morning. The hash browns weren't the best but it was tolerable and the toast was well...toast. I ended up eating everything on my plate because I was hungry, but that ended up being a poor choice. About 30 minutes after eating I got the worst stomachache of my life. It was horrible and I could barely walk without complaining about how nauseous I felt. Eventually I sucked up the pain, but it didn't go away until about 6 hours later when I decided I could stomach a granola bar. I told my family I would not be going back there again only to be called ""picky"" and ""stubborn"" because apparently they all loved their breakfast special. 
So 2 days later we return for breakfast. They all order the special and I get a plate of pancakes for $7 which ended up being a bit pricey because a coffee was $2.50 extra. My plate came with 3 giant pancakes, a little container with syrup and a little container with butter. While it was no iHop pancake, it was still very good and I even had to give one to my cousin because the pancakes were so big.

We were seated on their patio which was really nice. It had a view of the Roman fountain. my wife ordered a pina colada that took nearly ten minutes to arrive. No alcohol could be tasted and I bet it was from a mix. 

We ordered fries because of the long wait for the main food. Of course those weren't compensated because of the long wait. The fries were actually pretty good. 

The burgers however were horrible. Their ""signature"" cheese burger had no seasoning to the beef leaving it bland and dry. It was served with a pineapple slice on the side (if you want fries, they are extra). The juice from the pineapple soaked into the bun. I hate pineapple so it made it really bad. The bun was hard on the outside and soft in the middle. The cheddar cheese on the burger was so cooked on the burger it had begun to char. 

My wife had the burger that comes with bleu cheese. It also was bland and very dry. 

My daughter had mac and cheese and it was normal box mac and cheese. The guy that brought the food out put the plate in front of my five year old. It was very hot to the touch and I asked him to leave the mac and cheese bowl and take the plate. My son had the chicken strips and those were good.

We had the slider cheeseburgers, guacamole burger (which has the most miniscule amount of guacamole on it), cheeseburger, taco salad, fries, and sweet potato fries. I'm fairly certain the sweet potato fries are freezer section generic variety. Horrible. The regular fries were the only redeeming part of the meal and without them I'm would have starved. 

When you go to a restaurant that specializes in burgers you would expect them to be one of two things: charbroiled or cooked on the griddle. Either way you get color, texture, and flavor. The beef patties this establishment serves are grey in color and absolutely flavorless. I actually don't know how you make burger patties look like that. 

Considering the fact that the restaurant was not busy (if it was, that's sad), our service was SLOW, our server was polite-- and I don't mean that in a good way, and our food took forever to come out.

Now, let's start with the calamari. The calamari was just a plate of fried little chicken nuggets, or at least I thought and it was too late when my mom told me it was squid. But it was actually really good with lots of very unique flavours. Next we got the sweet potato fries. They were really good and perfectly cooked with the right amount of salt and tenderness. Finally we had the nachos. It was a huge plate of it, it was topped with lettuce, quacamole, chicken, jalapeños, and a bit of cheese. It was not what I expected, what I expected was a big plate of nachos with the type of cheese you would get at a baseball game. The only thing bad was that we asked for beef not chicken. You can't go wrong with beef nachos. But they did. After all it was a very good place to eat and dine at, this deserves a 4 star for all the hard work the chef put in to this meal. Thank you...

The reasons this happened: we had two waiters, one that could listen, but was too busy to help all the tables he was assigned, and the second that did not listen and took away my plate as I was finishing my fries. The fry was in my hand and she grabbed it without even looking at me or the food. Really??
Next, when I went to the front for assistance, the assistant managers pointed to the young and inexperienced hostesses and said ""talk to them"", then continued their conversation. I spoke with the hostesses, they let the bartender know he forgot my drink, retrieved a cup, and I went back to the table.

You can pretty much order anything and you will be happy.  Some burgers have pineapple, some come with an egg sunnyside up, you can ask for an onion ring inside your burger and of course avocado ALL around.  The bacon is perfectly crispy and the fries are also scrumptious.

The service does take a while (or maybe it just seems like longer because of the Vegas morning-after munchies), but the service is always friendly.

I'm sure some fast-food place would have been good too, but because we were starving, the burger tasted soooooo good! It took a while to get to the table, but once it did, it was gone in 3 minutes. Maybe 2.5 minutes. 

Random stuff in this joint, like the Indian stuff, camels, elephants in a Hawaiian cheeseburger place... but it was cool. It was fun to look at all the stuff there. 

Service was okay, not the best, but not the worst I've had. Also it wasn't packed and really loud, so I enjoyed that moment of slow-paced Vegas eating. 

Overall it was good, but if I wasn't so lazy, I'd go drive out to the In & Out down the ways.... no offense cheeseburger land.",Z_2n7NdU1zZhf1k2_hDvUQ,1,1,3,EQHNIYltGCwviwZf-hWgTg

I was window (reluctantly but trying to save $!) shopping at Miracle Mile the night before and saw their banner ad somewhere around there urging you to have a cheeseburger for breakfast.  They were also reviewed in one of the in-room vegas mags (sept '08) saying that it was one of the best places to go for a good burger on the strip that was convenient and not too pricey.  

It was about 1/2 full around 1pm (our ""brunch"") and seemed very clean to me but what do I know, I wasn't watching employees wash their hands and that's what I saw that they were cited for last month (mentioned in someone's earlier review on here).  They are coming under review again soon to make sure that errors have been corrected so I am assuming that they want to stay open and are making sure to follow procedures.  I actually checked out the health dept citations and A LOT of restaurants on the strip were cited, some even temporarily closed so I figure if it's open it's most likely at least safe, esp since they have the follow up re-inspection soon after.

My boyfriend got the guacamole burger and after much back and forth and having the patient and polite waitress coming by 5 times as I kept changing my mind and needing another minute (so many choices for a place with such a simple name!) I got a big salad with mixed greens, tomato, cucumber, mushrooms, croutons and a big piece of surprisingly delicious grilled mahi for a burger place.  We also got a big basket of their thick cut delicious seasoned fries to share - def more than enough for 2 hungry people to share.  

The total, before tax, before tip came to $28 and we just had water to drink...I think the burger was $9-10, the fries were $4.25, the salad itself was about $10 so I guess adding the grilled fish was an extra $4.  I had a bite of the bf's cheeseburger and it was perfectly juicy and delicious and I wanted my own and regretted ordering that damn salad! (was trying to be semi-healthy b/c I was having the sinful but yummy fries!). Black and blue burger (cheeseburger with bluecheese) looked good to me and I'd try that if I ever went back.  A little pricey for just a burger but it is a sit-down restaurant so def not too bad.  

Now you want to talk crazy prices - try $9 for a ben and jerry's regular size scoop of frozen yogurt in a waffle cup that we shared later when we were watching the rain show there.",hs2vGZCZ4UdQW8uoHMQ4ww,1,1,3,Xu3_3A-1k-wxRgJcTIierA

This place has a huge sign that gets straight to the point. All you see is ""Cheeseburger"" screaming at your face. Most of my buddies love cheeseburgers so it wasn't a hard to get all of us to go in. 

The restaurant has a really islandy type of feel. The color scheme, layout and whole theme was a bit cheesy (no pun intended) with even the male servers wearing grass skirts, lol. Our server was a gentleman who said he had just started back up with the company after being gone for a couple years. He was very pleasant, engaging and funny. He made a ton of suggestions to us and was extremely helpful with the menu.

Every single one of my buddies enjoyed their meal. I had a pig sandwich, along with my other buds who had hot dogs and cheeseburgers. The steak fries were very tasty. They all expressed their satisfaction with the food and the level of service we were provided. 

The only gripe I had with my experience there was the water. The water was straight up gross. I don't know if it's Vegas tap water or what, but it was just disgusting. The rest of the party felt the same way, so we all ended up ordering soda or something else.

We visited the Miracle Mile shops while her Aunt struck it big at some slots.  She decided to treat us for a meal and Cheeseburger Las Vegas, aka Cheeseburger At the Oasis was the recommendation.

Seating was prompt and the ambiance was cool - pseudo Hawaii/surfer/L&L/Ultra-Hawaiian look...which for me...is blehh..  The waiter came and took our order about 15-20 minutes after we sat.. (this wasn't so bad..)

I was debating on whether or not I should try the original burger ""Cheeseburger with an Attitude"" or the ""Ahlili Burger"".  I ended up with the Ahlili burger just for the fried egg and bacon.  I also had the notion to be adventurous and perhaps try a DIY Golden Bowl (http://www.yelp.com/biz/golden-bowl-charbroiled-teriyaki-6-long-beach) style burger:  Their cheeseburger with Avocado and covered in Teriyaki sauce.

BUT NO.

We arrived at 9:00pm, so the night was still young (and this was a Thursday).  Explain WHY the waiter had NO gusto in his service and not happy at all to serve us.  I WANTED to try the DIY burger, but when he came to me his respose :""{sigh}..what did you want...{frown/look/awkwardness}"".   My response dropped from a full fledged custom burger to ""the alili burger"".  He doesn't acknowledge me and walks off to the other member in our party.

Being Vegas, I would have thought that I could have a ""Vegas Burger Experience"" - ie meat cooked the way I want it, toppings the way I want it, dressing and sides the way I want it, but I guess this wasn't burger king:  I couldn't have it the way I wanted it.

We sat and waited...and waited...and waited.  Drinks came out, their iced tea tasted like water...something was wrong with the mix I suppose.  We brought it to their attention, but instead of fixing it or trying to see what was wrong, our waiter simply said ""This is how it is"".

Lovely.

We waited...and waited...and waited.  He never showed up until our food came out (1 hour later....really.   The woman's family were still in conversation.  They mentioned the long wait, but I was really hungry and did notice).  

The food was awesome.  I can't deny it.  The burger, even though it was cooked on the medium well side, it was good.  I preferred a bit more pink, but i wasn't given that option.  The cheeseburger was done well.  I could careless for their coleslaw actually...i didn't taste any dressing on it, and it seemed as if they wanted the pineapple taste to come through into it...but I didn't get that flavor on my palate.  

Overall:  The food, although EXTREMELY long on a Thursday night, was worth the wait, IMO.  I would have appreciated better customer service, because lets face it:  It is apart of the dining experience.  This is the main reason as to why I did not give it a 3 or four stars.  Simply put, as the 2 stars state ""Meh.  I've experienced better"".  

Had the waiter been more friendly and explained the menu, I would have opted for the Cheeseburger Challenge, as my burger was small.  (And I could have gotten a tshirt!).


Im confused though.  The guy seemed like a total douche...but offered us free cups as we left for the Cheeseburger: Reno location.  Im guessing they had closed down or something and gave the cup for free.  The woman used her charm and asked for another cup, which he smiled and hesitantly said yes to.  

Had his simple smile then reflected during his service, we could have had 3 stars.

My moco loco came and at first glance it does not look desirable or appetizing. It's a bed of rice, with a burger patty on top of it with three fried eggs on top of the patty, brown gravy poured all over. I took a bit and it was amazing! I really enjoyed the dish!

I ordered the Cheeseburger Island Style which included grilled pineapple and Hawaiian Teriyaki sauce, neither of which had much flavor or added anything to the burger. I don't usually order cheese on my burger, but I went ahead with it, and I don't think it was a good quality cheese because it also did not have a distinct (or any, really) flavor. The bun was soggy and fell apart when I tried to eat it. My daughter ordered the Cheeseburger Babies (sliders, basically), and she seemed to like them, but when I asked her after the meal how they were, she said they were ""nothing special."" You have to order the sides separately, and we split an order of onion rings. They were a soggy crisp (I know, kind of an oxymoron), and had a strange flavor to them--I can't quite put my finger (or taste bud) on it. We ended up not finishing them, even between the two of us.

Service was just all right. I ordered a water and a Coke to drink, and only ever received the water. My daughter never got a refill on her lemonade. The people we were with also ordered the Babies, and they did not get the top buns for their burgers. They had to ask for them and the buns were brought out separately a few minutes later on a small plate. Kind of weird--buns are a pretty basic expectation with a burger.

The total for two burger entrees, a side of onion rings, and one soda was around $31.00. Not too bad for on the strip dining, but I think we would have been more satisfied with a less expensive burger and some delicious fried pickles from another chain burger restaurant.

We had a budget in mind and we set off to Vegas (from LB, CA) to find a place that would be perfect for us. After walking around and calling many, many places, we were starting to get discouraged. And then we met TIM!!!! 

From the very first hello, Tim (manager at Cheeseburger) was very warm, friendly and inviting. He truly had the ""aloha"" spirit. He was easy to talk to, easier to work with, and he had no problem working with our budget. We were SO relieved - our savior, Tim!

There were many emails exchanged back and forth with Tim, and another manager at Cheeseburger, April. April was also very nice and easy to work with. All worked out and at the end of the night, we walked away paying what we hoped to pay for a small reception. 

Here's a few of the highlights of having a larger get-together at Cheeseburger LV:

+ first, the restaurant doesn't have a separate room for private parties, so the fact that they accommodated 130+ people for us was amazing. They even set up a black ""screen"" to allow us more privacy, which was really sweet. Thank you Cheeseburger, for that. 

+ the food was great, and they had it set up nicely in a ""buffet"" style so that our guests could easily serve themselves. 

+ we had a few servers assigned to our party which was great for the guests we had that wanted a little extra attention. they handled our party with grace and efficiency. Thank you to the servers that helped us! 

+ the bar was right next to us which made it easy for our guests to grab cocktails (or shots, ugh) should they choose to. they also have a wide variety of beers which was awesome!!!

All in all, it was an amazing time. The managers and staff went above and beyond to ensure a great time for everyone and that itself makes me extremely grateful to have found this place. You can't beat this!",-4W8KYGqdUMo7oJmLFgWNQ,0,0,5,VZ6997I5owbieR2qRK7v-A

I'll start out with the service like I usually do. The host was real friendly. We conversed about Vegas, shops and the actual restaurant. He recommended a few items for us to try, making us even more hungry. Our waiter was equally friendly and courteous. Always stopping by at convenient times to check if we needed any kind of service. 

The food was superb. I ordered a burger named ""It's all good"". I would say yes it was all good. The burger contained a line-up of amazing tasty delicacies. Swiss Cheese, Mushrooms(my favorite vegetable), Guacamole and Bacon. Absolutely delicious. A minor inconvenience is that fries do not come along side your burger. It's not a big deal. Seasoned steak fries is what they serve and those were delicious as well. Gave our waiter a nice tip because me and my girlfriend were highly satisfied with this place.

Planet Hollywood and Miracle Mile aren't exactly known for good inexpensive food, so we just decided to give this place a shot. We had to wait a few minutes to get seated (for lunch), which wasn't a big deal, but then we waited... and waited... and waited some more. It was probably close to 15 minutes before anyone stopped by our table to say hi or take drink orders. But, that gave us plenty of time to look over the menu. When our waitress finally showed up we quickly gave her our food and drink orders fearing that she wouldn't return for another half hour.

As for the food... meh. Cheeseburger Las Vegas is kind of like a cross between Islands Fine Burgers and The Cheesecake Factory. And, like the Cheesecake Factory they have a thick menu with laminated pages that are spiral bound. All their food is the typical high caloric, fat-laden, heart attack-inducing stuff you would expect to find in a place like this. With that being said, I still wanted to get my grub on. There was no time to worry about a quadruple bi-pass.

The food:
Kalua pig sandwich -- surprisingly good! The hoagie roll was lightly toasted, the pulled pork was finely shredded, tender and flavorful, and there was some cole slaw in the sandwich that added a nice crunch.

Hawaiian chicken sandwich -- decent but largely forgettable sandwich with pineapple and teriyaki sauce.

Chicken tenders -- 4 large (and thinly pounded) pieces of chicken sitting on top of a large pile of seasoned steak fries. Not bad as far as chicken tenders go. The fries were nice and crispy but could have used more seasoning.

Overall, it was a mediocre experience and I knew it would be going in. I was surprised by how much I liked the pork sandwich, but other than that, the food was nothing memorable. I doubt I'll be back. 2.5 stars",C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w,3,2,2,KdfL8xF0CRO4bUJ4Rhb9eA

They have great prices I was surprised for being in the strip that it didn't cost more. If you like food challenges then ask your server about the ""Cheeseburger Challenge"" price currently at $29.99 and have at it!

I had it with sweet potato fries and they were just OK. Crinkle cut, not a fan... I still ate them, just not all of them.

As I walk by you with a couple drinks in me on a Sunday night in Vegas I think to myself ""a place with that name surely can't be too bad""...Due to my lack of planning I grab a table for two over looking the Belliago knock off water show while next to that watching people flock for tickets to a show catering to pets..I should have know to walk away but I have a few cocktails in me and I'm looking at the only place who can seat me right away.

As I scroll through the menu I think this doesn't seem to bad so I order a BBQ cheese burger with bacon and my fiancée orders the chili cheese dog because who can mess that up, crap, THEY CAN..

My burger tasted like it was pre made a year ago and mixed with rubber, the chili dog was the saltiest thing I have ever had and the cheese that was on the two items was NOT cheese.

I beg those of you who have the time to check this place out online to NEVER go and to walk across the walk way to strippers because at least there you get a show.

She was extremely helpful and provided us our group dinner options. We arranged the Burgers & Beer package without the beer so that our guests can pick up their own drinks. Between the first discussion and our event date, Jessica and James helped us coordinate details, pick the menu and answered our questions. They also helped us show a picture collage on their video screen.

On the day of the event, Jessica showed us the room we had reserved and showed us our dessert that had been delivered. When our guests arrived later that night, the room looked great and the cocktail servers were ready to go. The service was outstanding, the food and drinks were very timely and very good. We never felt pressured to wrap up early. Tim was the manager on duty during our event and was outstanding.

As someone that used to vacation in Vegas before moving here, I love seeing other people enjoy 'my' town the way I used to. 

We each had sliders, regular for me and turkey for her. We also split sweet potato fries, and each had a yummy boozy drink. My sliders came with thousand island dressing on the side, but no pickles. The sweet potato fries were really tasty, cooked perfectly. Cheeseburger gives you 4 sliders which was a little much for us, after we finished (each leaving a full slider on our plates) we agreed that we should have just split an order.

We wandered in here for lunch out of convenience since we were staying in the Elara Hotel.

I ordered a Mushroom and Swiss Cheeseburger and was very disappointed.  I was so hungry that I managed to eat half of it and took the rest back to the room for later.  It wasn't until I ate my leftovers that I realized that it was a mediocre burger you can get from a Carl's Jr drive thru.  The meat patty looked and tasted like cardboard.

After leaving the line at the V Theater next door, we decided to get something to eat. I made eye contact with both the hostess and the waitress who were standing near the front talking as we were approaching so they knew we were going to come there to eat. So what do they do? They both turn around so their backs are to us and walk into the restaurant. I thought that was rude, but we still waited a few minutes until they looked at us again, continued to talk for a few minutes with their backs to us, then the waitress walked off and the hostess continued to stand in the restaurant with her back to us. By this point we were incredibly annoyed after also receiving no service at the V Theater. I noticed another woman sitting at a computer around the corner from the hostess' desk, so I told her we were there for 2. She tells me ""Oh you have to wait for her,"" and points to the hostess who has turned her back to us TWICE. I was furious by this point! I've worked in customer service for several years and one thing you don't do is tell a customer to wait for an employee who has been ignoring them!

We went in and the hostess greeted us at the entrance.  We asked if we could just sit at the bar.  All good.  The Olympics and Basketball were on the TV.  Waiter was not at the bar.  Sat for a few moments and then he showed up.  We were the only ones at the bar, so I am sure he went off to do side work or something. Not a biggie.  He was super friendly.  Told us about the drink specials and took our order.   Asked if we wanted food, no thanks. 
Being from Reno, the drinks in Vegas are Crazy expensive.  I mean, we pay $5 for a Jack n Coke and $3 for a domestic beer...bottle or draft.  In Vegas it's $15 and $8!  This place had a great happy hour menu, so we were excited.  
I ordered a ""Trouble"" frozen specialty drink and my man a big beer.  The frozen drink was basically a Pina Colada with extra (dark) rum and banana liquor added on top of the basic rum and coconut.  It was tasty. Not sure if it really was that tasty or if I was just so excited to get a drink on Vegas for $5.50!  Haha.   Waiter was pleasant.  Talkative but not too much that he was annoying, nice kid.

First off, the place itself is pretty decent looking inside.  It is a bit campy, but hell... it is Vegas and 3/4 of the stuff is.  I have not been to Maui... but didn't think burgers were a big part of their diet there... and this is a Haiwian themed burger joint.  Oh well... screw the confusion... on to the food.

One big point deduction here is that they specialize in burgers, yet you can't pick how you would like your burger cooked.  Are you f'n kidding me?!  I'll say that again... if you like your burger medium rare... tough shit... we make them medium well and that is all.  WTF people... this isn't fast food... this is a $8-$10 burger by itself!  /rant

So...besides being cooked too much for my taste, the burger was actually decent.  Colby cheese, perfectly cooked bacon and a nice bun.  The meat was generic but not bad.  The only tropical theme here was the pineapple slice that came in the basket though... again with the island confusion I have.

On the plus side, there were many on tap choices for beer.  Good points for that.  In addition, the onion rings and fries were both very good.  I will add I am not a fan of steak fries, but theirs were actually nice and I enjoyed them.  Order a basket for the table though, they give you a bunch.  The rings were great. Nice and big, gourmet crumb style.  Cooked perfect too.

Service was good and our waiter did a fine job.  But, for being dead in there, the food took a long time to come out (maybe because they decide to burn all the burgers instead of medium rare?!).  Overall, it is a bit costly for the burgers, but not a terrible choice if you don't mind medium well burgers.",5sd33XzAaQdAURimI670WA,0,0,2,bWPOkhUNZqA-B3ZiLqPIGw

We were doing a little shopping and needed a bite and knew we'd be paying inflated prices due to the locale, but it wasn't worth the $32 we spent for 2 burgers and no booze.

The service was very friendly, I'll give them that. They were very nice, though our waitress did disappear for an extended period of time and never came back to check on us until we were ready for the bill, but other than that, they were helpful and friendly.

The burgers were unremarkable for a place called Cheeseburger. I got the Guacamole Burger, which the menu made sound like something special and really, it was just a  plain burger with a small ice cream scoop of guac on it.  I don't know what I was expecting, but I guess just something a little more impressive. The flavor was ok -- it definitely wasn't a bad burger, it just wasn't like, *awesome*. Nothing to oo and ahh about.

It's a little annoying to pay $10 for a burger and have to pay $5 for fries separately.  For $10, you should get a little a small side of fries, in my opinion, but again, I knew it was a tourist spot so they can charge whatever they want.

My boyfriend got a regular cheeseburger and was equally unimpressed.  It wasn't bad, it just wasn't amazing.

I'd eaten there once before several years ago when it was still the Aladdin and thought the same.  Maybe if I was full of yard-long booze I might think it was better, and it's possible I might eat here again if it's where someone wanted to go.

4655200,2016-04-30,5,db04aHdl79B5OUo_tknYZw,"Cheeseburger is a Hawaiian burger restaurant located in the Hollywood themed Miracle Mile Shops at the Planet Hollywood resort. Cheeseburger is where Aloha meets Hollywood. 

  My family and myself have been going to Cheeseburger for years going back to when Miracle Mile was the Aladdin Shops and Planet Hollywood was the New Aladdin. It was my dad that discovered this popular Hawaiian burger restaurant in the back of the mall by the fountain show and V Theater. In Hawaii, he had dined at their Maui Cheeseburger In Paradise location. He remembered their cheeseburger as exceptional. Just like countless restaurants throughout the world, Cheeseburger in Paradise opened on the Las Vegas Strip as Cheeseburger at the Oasis abbreviated Cheeseburger. Up to the time of this review, it is the only Cheeseburger restaurant on the mainland. 

   During the recent staycation in late March, I ate here three times. Twice with my dad for breakfast then once solo for lunch. Before joining Yelp, we had been here a handful of times throughout the years. 

   Cheeseburger announces ""Aloha"" with their signs advertising $5.99 breakfast and lunch specials. With  many restaurants on the Las Vegas Strip jumping on the bandwagon of ripping off tourists and locals, Cheeseburger is a refreshing ""Aloha."" And it is a tasty ""Aloha"" because the food was quality and not some shabby dish with gas station coffee to get you in.

  On the three 2016 staycation visits their service and atmosphere was upbeat. When we walked off the Miracle Mile into Hawaii, the hostess greeted us with ""Aloha "" and proceeded to walk us to our table. On the first visit we sat at a booth inside that overlooked some interesting Hawaiian pictures, memorabilia, and TVs. There are 26 TVs. The Cheeseburger website boasts that they have the NFL Ticket where guests can watch all the NFL games while enjoying a delicious cheeseburger. On the following two visits we would be away from the action on the TV and facing the action on the Miracle Mile at a patio table outside that is really inside of the Miracle Mile Shops underneath a changing blue sky near the fountain show. This is a prime spot for people watching. And a better spot for food watching.

    The $5.99 breakfast special includes two eggs fried or scrambled; ham, bacon, or sausage; hash browns; choice of toast; a slice of pineapple; cup of coffee; and mini umbrella. I'd switch things around. One breakfast it was scrambled eggs and bacon then the second fried eggs and ham. Everything on the plate was good food. I believe that there wasn't a crumb left over. Complimenting the breakfast was delicious coffee. Their breakfast special proves that Cheeseburger is more than cheeseburgers. 

   On the last day of the staycation I tried the $5.99 cheeseburger special. The $5.99 cheeseburger special that added up to around $8 with bottomless soda was a tasty deal. There was zero catch to the special. If I had ordered bacon then the price would of increased. It wasn't just a cheeseburger; the toppings included lettuce, onions, tomato, and my choice of cheese plus French fries and a slice of pineapple. The cheeseburger was just how I prefer it to be: thick and juicy overflowing with fresh tomatoes, lettuce, and onions. If their $5.99 cheeseburger special is this good, I am confident that their five napkin burgers are still the outstanding burgers I remember. 

    When you are in the vicinity of the Miracle Mile Shops with an appetite and are up for a good deal, I recommend stopping by Cheeseburger for the $5.99 specials. Additionally if your up for a unique cheeseburger from a Hawaiian cheeseburger restaurant, I recommend Cheeseburger. After all these years I never left Cheeseburger with a bad taste.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,11,10,4,mrWxx7ZBqH3GT-V6kOCf8Q

My wife and I arrived on the early side of the dinner hour 5:30 pm ish) and the restaurant was virtually empty. There is seating on the outside of the restaurant as well as inside. We like to people watch so we asked for an outside table. Despite the fact that there 4 open tables located in the more desirable location in the front of the restaurant, the hostess opts to seat us all the way around the side, which is adjacent to the ticket office for one of the major PH shows, right at the time when hundreds of people were queuing up to buy tickets. This despite the fact that the tables located in the more desirable area were never filled! AMAZING!!

Ok, what you really care about: The menu was diverse and unique. The prices very reasonable given a Strip location. They have a great selection of beers.

The feel of the restaurant reminds me a lot of Islands, another burger joint that I'm very familiar with in San Diego.  The burgers were day-and-night better, though.  The staff was friendly, and the drinks (I tried a Pina Colada) were stiff.  But what gets so many stars from me was the sheer deliciousness of the burger.

We visited your Las Vegas location inside the Planet Hollywood on Friday 3/29/13, check #xxxx. This is the third time we have been there, (other visits were much better). This location did a good job with 3 hostesses bringing people in, but once seated it was all downhill from there. It took almost 10 minutes for our server to acknowledge us, and the whole visit for a ""quick breakfast"" was over 1 hour and 20 minutes (our instincts told us to leave after the initial poor service, and we did witness a table do just that behind us). The staff was horribly inefficient, I have never seen a restaurant where the wait staff did not have ""sections"". Our server, (and the others) were taking care of tables throughout the restaurant. There were more than enough servers, it was that they were being pulled in multiple directions. Restaurant 101, rotate customers into servers sections not the other way around. When it came time to pay the check our server dropped it off and disappeared. Again after about 10 minutes we walked over to the bar staff to see if they could run our payment they said ""no and she'll find our server"". She continued cutting up pineapple and never even tried to find her. We finally flagged her down and she took the payment but then proceeded to go help another table rather than getting us closed out.

This was not the best, but it was one of the good one's. It is also one of the best burgers on the strip. I honestly, did not expect to like it since it was fairly dead in there the night we went in.

There was nothing that would make this place stand out, other than the decorations. Had me wondering if this burger joint was part of Islands (see photos). We ordered a turkey burger/fries, hot wings for appetizers.

Hot wings is normal, so glad it was not hot 'tiny' wings. The wings were actually a good size.  The turkey burger had an after taste to me.  My husband and I split it and It was okay for him. I didnt care for it too much. I ordered a drink that was salty.

Was it worth the rainy walk? Yeah it was pretty good! Like most American burger places, the work on height and volume, in my opinion. Our burgers can somewhat deconstructed with the 2 half buns on each plate and ingredients on top. When I put my burger together, I had to do an Adam Richman (from Man Vs Food and now Man meets food) move - squish the burger buns together. He taught me well because most of the ingredients fit in my mouth in each bite!!!  Thanks Adam!!! 

I had the bbq cheeseburger minus the cheese; I have a cheese allergy. The burger was described as being drenched in bbq sauce, I didn't find this was the case so I added some tomato sauce and mayo. The bacon was perfect and if I could move after devouring the burger, I may have wanted more bacon. The meat patty tasted fresh and moist. 

N had a burger with pineapple and bacon, I think it was called something Island. He enjoyed his too. Both burger came with a generous (waaaay too many!) serve of crispy deep fried fries as well.

The burger was just as good as I remembered.  Messy as all hell, but good.  A little disappointed that they refused to make it medium (medium well was the closest I could get), and the fact that 3 burgers and 3 drinks ran me $60.  Service was okay, maybe a little on the slow side.  

Bottom line:  I'd eat here again, but it's definitely not as memorable as the one in Lahaina.   5 stars for the burger, 3 for everything else, so I'm rounding up to 4.",kGGapvfP1SZH2ZOikdSpNA,1,0,4,qDnoSXAVR-hFXCBtDhMSqw

After going in circles around planet Hollywood trying to find the exit to the parking garage to get out...lol I worked up somewhat of an appetite for something hearty so, after walking by this place for the 10th time, I decided to check them out.

It's a Hawaiian themed restaurant, with of course a ""Hawaiian"" touches to just about every dish. I really wasn't feeling anything Hawaiian like though, I figured I would find something that would satisfy my basic, American cravings.

I decided upon a boring mushroom and Swiss cheeseburger on a whole wheat bun. My friend ordered some sort of burger with a fried egg on it that actually looked quite delish.

Our food arrived in these plastic basket bowls that I really was not to fond of and (to me) made it more difficult to eat though, to my surprise, my actual burger was extremely tasty and even the bun as well, was soft chewy and flavorful.

The service was decent, friendly and sincere. They offer to take your picture to be posted at the restaurant or of course for you to purchase. The food seems to be above average yet they are a little pricey. 

All in all, I would say they are definitely worth checking out.",g5JvNSSkz6q04uvDcqSU_g,5,5,4,mjiznwXrCwfNpDG-uoVCvg

We've been to Cheeseburger in Paradise on Maui, and that one is definitely cooler, at least regarding the atmosphere.  The food is good but not grand.  A bit overpriced (the $9 burgers don't come with fries).  As for me, I only eat fish, so I got the mahi mahi sandwich/burger option.  It actually came with a macadamia nut cole slaw, but I didn't notice any mac nuts in there.  The tropical drink I ordered off the menu was tasty (and I could still taste some booze in it), but I didn't get buzzed off it.

The veggie burger was average at best, putting it on par with the drab ambiance of the restaurant. The fries were good, though. So that was a bonus. Oh, and the food was SLOW to come out, leaving us sitting on the faux-patio for what seemed like ages. Great people watching though. 

Service was good. Our waiter made a number of poorly crafted jokes, which provided some semblance of entertainment... although the awkward laughter was more a product of how uncomfortable it was than anything else.

The mojito my wife ordered didn't have the mint and limes muddled or mixed into the drink at all so it tasted like simple syrup. Ok, maybe it's not the bartenders specialty and we can fix it by muddling in the limes and mint ourselves. No big deal. We decide to order three appetizers to share as a meal. Pork and Cabbage Wontons came out lukewarm and the texture of the pork was very mushy. Ahi Tuna, overcooked and too much sauce on top. Makes me think that it's not sushi grade quality and to be fair, we neglected to ask before  ordering. Chili Cheese fries, they got this one right. They were good.

The service, or lack there of, was a main reason for the 2 star rating. Once our food was brought out we didn't see our waiter until our check came. I normally wouldn't mind this except my water glass was empty for most of my meal. 

One plus to the meal was where we sat. We sat on the patio section and it gave us a great view of everything around us!
