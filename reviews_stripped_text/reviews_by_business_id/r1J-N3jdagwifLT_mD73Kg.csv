When I went into Corduroy to inquire about a space the staff seemed excited and eager to help! I spoke with the GM, Chris, and he offered me this amazing area with a retro vibe for a really reasonable rate. When we arrived for the reservation chris was extremely hospitable and personable. We ended up chatting for a bit and he had the area ready for us 15 minutes prior to our reserved time. Our bartender/ server Crowley was awesome. He checked on us frequently enough that no ones drink was ever empty as he tended an extremely busy bar prime time on a Saturday night. The craft cocktails are really great, and we love that they offer Moscow mules on tap! I will most definitely hold future parties and gatherings here. Thank you so much so such an epic time!!!!",3pGEMurcMRIVMM38iY_wxA,0,0,5,hpXvFvo_iPuFCdD8RbTc5A

He then told me that the staff was instructed to pour 1.5 oz of whatever they were asked for. So, if you order Chivas, it's 1.5 oz.. and if you order Bailey's, which is half the strength, its the same pour.

If you are lucky enough you can land a spot in the large window that opens to Fremont, sitting there is the worlds best ""people watching"" place. Seriously, the best. 

The atmosphere alone should bring you in the door. The cute big orange doors.

Yea there is the cool selfie room built with small secret windows so voyeurs outside the room can watch all the action. Very cute.

The jute box has all the rock you can handle. The ""your neighbors 70's basement vibe"" is a touch dive, a touch relaxing. Walk around and check out all the fun rooms.

Homemade Moscow Mules, yummy craft beers and the classic PBR are all on tap waiting for you. HH prices for wells, mules and beers are hot and ready at 4pm.

Check out the ""Call Your Mother"" phone that really works. Is your mom down with a drunk dial? Sounds a bit dangerous. I'm not that brave but use at your own risk. Or sober up a bit by ordering a Hot Pocket, then call her afterwards.

I always have a good time at Corduroy. This is a place I'll bring all my out of town visiting friends who want an ""off the strip"" and unique experience in Vegas.

Chris is your very friendly and passionate mixologist! If you've been downtown a lot, you'll probably already know him from other past Downtown bars - it was great to see him.

It's got the life, personality and quality to fill the big shoes of its awesome location. It's been open for barely a few weeks yet has crawled its way to the top of my list of favorite bars in, not just downtown, but Las Vegas itself. 

What stood out to me immediately, aside from the awesome light up water wall behind the bar, was the genuine service from the bartenders. And not just one but everyone of them so far. It may be that they have yet to be weathered down by the uncompromising and often irritating flow of people that commonly occupy downtown bars -but as it stands, these guys lead the way in service. 

Not to mention the quality of their drinks are consistently well crafted. They have a tiki bar day with flavorful mojitos and rum drinks, a great selection of drafts including some solid IPA's (my favorite) and a cocktail list with a lot to cross off. 

The ambience and interior features are also a major point in setting this place apart from the rest in the area. The initial bar area has a crazy light-up water fixture and a sweet back wall built with retro stereos  that give the place some pizazz. I'm sure live music could be accommodated well here. Upon moving further back, there are very classy little private tables with bead-type curtains that make you feel like you're at a Gatsby party. Towards the farthest back is more private areas, with a classic pacman/galaga machine (which I have the 3rd hi-score for Galaga, FYI) tables, and an area which I HOPE they begin filling with a DJ of some kind. 

Best for last: the corduroy light room. I take every new person here and tell them nothing until we're already 15 minutes into a photo shoot. So much personality in this downtown hot spot. 5 stars easily earned.",s00s3sKWVElGqyRJ8QRcGw,4,1,5,m84bAKv9aKDYZ42SYbX5XQ

Corduroy seems to be a relatively new spot in the Fremont East district of Downtown Las Vegas. We may have been attracted by the colorful animated well behind the bar, but we stayed to check out of some of their craft beers on tap.

Mind you, they didn't have anything utterly groundbreaking, and a few of their taps had the mass-produced ""popular"" beers (not to mention the array of stuff for cocktails and shots which surely were also popular), but they do have some draft crafts if those are what you're into.

My friend and I just so happen to be in that crowd, so we enjoyed a couple of brews which happened to be $7 each for something in the range of 12 oz pours. My choice of Stoutello by Knee Deep Brewing Company was a nice milk stout, but instead of the promised chocolate hazelnut, I picked a light peanut flavor. I enjoyed the beer, but the marketing was misguided.

My friend picked up the Evergreen Haze by Novo Brazil. It so happens that I've had it before, and there's definitely a tropical/citrus thing going on in this American, non-hazy IPA. I enjoyed it roughly as much as the first time.

We both totally rocked out to the music. Not classic rock stuff, but the bands which we grew up on, like blink-182, Taking Back Sunday, The Killers, and Panic at the Disco (well, he may have a differing opinion there). I'm not sure if that music is on regular rotation or if it was just the preference of the DJ for Friday night / Saturday morning, but we had a blast while sitting at the windowsill and sipping on beers.

1.) I love the beautiful bar area with the purple bubble things.
2.) The DJ was playing great music.
3.) They have a photo booth. 

The photo booth would have to be my favorite things about this bar. There was a guard at the door of the photo booth just making sure no one stayed in there to long and to ensure no-one cut line. The sad thing about the photo booth is that I never received my photos in my email. After taking your photos you have the option to add your email and phone number for the photos to be send; however, I never received ours.",dIHHaoF-yyIvBFEOyEQ8Pw,1,1,4,ghKOnlz6u9qee5yNAQTQ8g

The atmosphere is very relaxed and they play great music. The bar has a traditional selection of drinks as well as some house concoctions. 

There is outdoor seating in the front, bar seating, and a little room with upholstered seating in the back that looks straight out of the 1970s.

My suggestion: ask for the Eloise - it is so good and it's Vito's own creation. The doormen here are also super friendly and not unapproachable like many in Vegas.

5076497,2017-09-09,0,r1J-N3jdagwifLT_mD73Kg,"Corduroy is another DTLV project bar that once again... is amazing. They're located at Fremont East in between Beauty Bar & The Griffin. My pictures don't do this place justice but they're good for a reference to my review. 

It has a gorgeous backbar with a color changing lava lamp-like wall. Permanent DJ booth to keep the tunes spinning. Retro decor throughout.

If you want a little privacy for you and your party, there's secluded rooms. 

There's an overflow bar in the back with additional seating. Near the overflow bar you'll find a #Selfie room that you can kick up your own jams in for 5 mins and take some pictures or a breather for yourself.  

The bathrooms are spacey and clean with old retro powder soap that gives you a nostalgic feel.

In the very back of the building is a closed off smoking room with seating and an antiquey cigarette vending machine.

Drinks are decently priced and there's food options available like pot pies and hot pockets.

This place is great & there is no cover charge, YET. But I'm sure that's to change once it's popping. ):   Maybe by Corduroy only being open certain days of the week they'll be able to eliminate the possible future need for a cover charge.

All in all, go check them out. It's a great spot with bartenders who take pride in making their signature cocktails and serving them with a smile.",0T9VyYK1SC0nLWsFc9-jPQ,3,2,5,fOa0pbHtnINI3tiZ8aJzrQ

There's room to dance and a back area for sitting. I wanted to see the selfie room I read about on yelp but didn't get the change. Boo.

5278383,2017-08-09,5,r1J-N3jdagwifLT_mD73Kg,"I read online that Corduroy was billing itself as a rock bar, so of course I had to scope this new bar out. Located next to the Griffin, Corduroy has a prime location. There was a line to get inside, but security got everyone in before you could say Timbuktu. There wasn't a cover around 10:30PM on a Saturday night, which is always appreciated.

The backdrop of the bar is really unique. It's like a giant colorful lava lamp screen. In fact, there were quite a few unique gems to be discovered here. There were doors that opened up into little gathering rooms. As far as rock music was concerned, there was none to be had. The music was mostly 80s pop music. Disappointing, but this bar is still pretty cool.

EDIT 2: Yelp did something weird and turned my initial review (which was an accidental duplicate listing) into an ""updated review"". I don't know how to delete the first review so that it's just one review instead of two. :/

 We introduced ourself to the bartender, Stephanie. She was GREAT!!! From that point on she called us by name and made sure we had drinks as needed ,even though there were a lot of people  for her to serve. 
 Later on we moved to the window to ""people watch"" since everyone was in their costumes.
The window is a great part of the bar. 
 If you are in the area, you should visit this bar...

Both are so fresh and amazing! They also squeeze their own ginger and fresh juice. The bartender and owner are such nice people and provide a chill atmosphere. If you're looking to get away from the edm music and go off the strip then you should come by! The mules on draft are $10 what a steal!,rRiARVNI-_8Z6s0uLfFvtQ,1,0,5,vohHQGMAYWikAwvrRRZxmA

5466927,2018-03-31,2,r1J-N3jdagwifLT_mD73Kg,"I loved this place.
It is located downtown on Fremont. I remember when this place dealt in check cashing, and now they deal in drinks and music from the 80/90s. The interior is fun with a bubble/lava back drop of the bar, and a wall full of speakers. If you venture down the hall you will a few other rooms for sitting, and past that a lounge area with neon painted walls... very psychiadelic. 
Now onto the drinks. I have the ""sex on the beach""/punch bag. It was tasty, but I was more sold on the packaging because the drink was served in a bag that you punch a hole through with a straw. It is exactly like the capri sun drinks that is in every kid's lunch. I hope at least. It was a pricey $12-14. I bought into the nostalgia and I am perfectly fine with that.
I plan to go back for boozy bingo on Thursday nights. Fun times for this lady.",15EfkL69gvmLmrvYGODDqw,4,3,4,bakGJr27jzjTiWLDhZxxsQ

After eating dinner across the street at eureka, and having a bad experience at the restaurant next do to it, we began bar hopping. Our game plan was to go to the container park, but when I saw the marquee for habanero pickle backs, we darted across the street in front of a slow moving fire truck. After getting past the door man, who was only checking id's, promptly bellied up to the bar and asked if the pickle backs were a lie. I was looked at like I was crazy, and to my surprise I was promptly served the real deal. From that point it was on, next thing I knew the rest of the group was drinking homemade ginger beer Moscow mules, and I was able to get one of the pickles (to share) straight outta the habanero pickle juice dispenser. The bartender had some trendy name, but spot on attitude and personality that I so look for in someone serving my drinks. A bad even rolled through the bar, played 3 great songs and left.
