169387,2012-09-10,0,REM8BezFuK4MQ6j2k1I7-Q,"The restaurant was very dirty and smelled intensely of bleach & cleaner (ironic).  The hostess/waitress tried to seat us at a table that was not clean, and had food on the floor underneath it. I pointed out the mess - and she seated us at another not so clean table. A few moments later she seated another couple at the same dirty table, without any effort at cleaning up the mess I had just pointed out to her. My friend and I spent a few minutes contemplating the menu, but the strong smell of bleach/cleaner was so overwhelming we both lost our appetites and decided to leave. Restaurants should smell like food, not cleaner - yet the place was filthy. Many tables had not had their dishes removed; there was food all over the floor; the table was sticky; my friend had to brush bits of food off her chair before she could sit down; the menus were sticky and were marked all over with a marker (?); the waitress could care less.

I tried to find a company website, but I don't think the owners of this business care about customer service.  Except for the pawn shop, every other business in this strip mall is closed - it feels like a place that has given up. Very sad. I try to support local, but at least with a chain there is a corporate office you can contact with concerns (dirty restaurant = dirty food = people get sick) and even the too big to fail chains respond to issues.

1042649,2016-03-07,1,REM8BezFuK4MQ6j2k1I7-Q,"It's a shame that all the SERVERS ARE ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE at Griddlecakes on Jones because the food is wonderful. This restaurant is only a minute or two away from my house, and my boyfriend and I really enjoy going out for breakfast. We have been to Griddlecakes about 6 times, and every time we say we will never go back because the SERVERS ARE ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE, but we always ended up going back because the food is so good. Today broke the camels back. We will NEVER return due to the inattentive servers. Today, we were sat by a host/server helper and she gave us our drinks. Then we sat at our table for 15 minutes before we walked out because nobody ever came to take our order. There were 3 servers and a server helper and only 6 tables in the entire restaurant... NOT busy at all. We left, very unhappy and hungry and will never return. HIRE NEW SERVERS! A week and a half ago I came in for breakfast alone. I was greeted quickly and received my delicious food quickly. My server NEVER returned to my table after taking my order (another server brought my food). I like to take my time while eating so I sat and ate for at least 35-45 minutes and NOBODY EVER CHECKED ON ME. Nobody ever asked if I needed any extra condiments or if my food was good or anything at all. My server brought me my check after I finished my food and that was the first
I had seen of her since she took my order. HORRIBLE SERVER!! This server has long brown/red straight hair (she's the prettiest one there). The time before this, my boyfriend and I ate our delicious food and went to pay. He paid and then when we walked out, he realized that there was NO WAY our breakfast for 2 should cost $45. This time our server was the pregnant girl. She added our ticket up wrong and overcharged us by almost $20. At first, I thought she just made an honest mistake because she is the only nice and decent server there. Then I checked the menu prices and realized that EVERY TIME we had the pregnant server, she was overcharging us and we never noticed. I guess she takes the extra money that she is illegally overcharging for tips? DISHONEST! I hope the manager reads this post and realizes that she is stealing money from their restaurant. The other server, blonde, that always wears her hair in a bun is EXTREMELY UNFRIENDLY! She is the one who I see there the most, and seems to have been there the longest, or knows how things work at that restaurant the most. She always bosses around the pregnant girl. She would always provide decent service but is not nice, at all. Someone with such a horrible personality should NOT be a server. Never a ""Hi, how are you?"" or anything, always only ""are you ready to order?"" I hate that I will never be going back because the fresh squeezed orange juice and food is fantastic but I have never seen SO MANY HORRIBLE SERVERS IN ONE RESTAURANT. Hire new servers.

Service was very friendly and the place looked really clean. Now when it came to the food, my Red velvet cakes were disgusting, and I'm not exaggerating. I put more syrup to see if it would drown the sour flavor and I drank coffee after each bite but it didn't get better, I ordered 2 and I honestly could not finish 1. I'm not a picky eater either. I took my second pancake home to see if maybe someone at home would think different but nope, my sister spit it out and my cousin ended up throwing it away.

I went there on a Saturday morning, and it was not too busy. There was no wait time, and open seating available. When I sat down I saw the menu and the food selection was extremely appealing, especially all the types of pancakes. Making my decision on what to choose was difficult. I decided to go with the Country Combo, and was pleasantly surprised by what I was given. The portion size was extremely generous. The home fries were great, and the gravy biscuit topped with a sausage biscuit had me wanting seconds. Overall, the meal was very satisfying.

1454478,2016-04-25,0,REM8BezFuK4MQ6j2k1I7-Q,"This place is just down the street from my home. I've been here with my daughter a few times and brunch with a friends and have experienced very good service. Each time the place was busy and still the food and  service was on point. 
The last five times I've been there I went with my husband. Two out of the five times we were there we had good service. The other three times we had issues due to a waitress. 

There is one particular waitress, dont know her name. The only way I can describe her is the girl with the piercing in the middle if her Clavicle bone. Let's call her Clavi.

Clavi wasn't outwardly rude but she was definitely being weird and kinda fake nice. My experience with her while there with my daughter and my friends in the past have always been warm and friendly. But something changed when I started going there with my husband. 

1st visit with my husband our order never made it to the kitchen. I had to get up and ask the guy ,who I believed was either Mgt or the owner about our order. It had been over 35 mins and Clavi never came back to our table to check on us or to see if we needed more coffee etc. My husband and I usually discuss weeks events during brunch and didnt realize we were waiting that long. When we did, we realized that two small groups of people came in after we placed our orders and they got their food. Mgt apologized and we got our food about 5 mins later. 

2nd and 3rd time we were there we had a different waitress and the service was great. Busy days...and we got our food within a reasonable time.

The 4th time Clavi was our waitress and we waited and saw a large group put in there order after us and got their food which doesn't make sense. We didn't order anything special and we had to wait about 25 mins to get our food. I had to wave to her her attention that time. 

5th time I was there with my husband and daughter and we ended up being served by Clavi and she was weirdly loud with us while taking our order. Weird and annoying! Also it happen again, no food but this time it was over 20 mins....others were seated and eating. Also Clavi addressed every table in our area but ours asking if they needed anything.  I decided I'm going to ask about our food so that we are not sitting there for over 20 mins again. This time no mgt in site but Clavi made her way over to the register to address me and pointed out that our food was there...yeah it was there sitting and waiting for someone to bring it to us. She just chose not to do it In a timely manner apparently. 
When she brought the food she seemed annoyed and talked to us with a louder tone asked if we needed anything else then left and came back once and refilled my daughters water. Ignored my empty water cup or my husband's coffee cup. Never bothered to grab my cup or my husband's cup also never bothered to bring us out check..we sat their took our time and couldn't get anyone's attention to get more water. At this time they were not that busy. 

I was never rude to this woman or anyone at the restaurant not even when we had to ask for our food. Don't know what her issue was until my husband pointed out that she seem to have an issue with us. We are an interracial couple and he says he'd seen that look before. (FYI my husband is white. I am not) I'm not used to being treated that way so I thought I'd write this so that maybe Mgt can address this and other customers do not get treated this way.
I don't know what her deal is but we do like the food and the other staff members seem to be genuinely nice. We might be back but will make a point to not sit in her section.",dEB3Q2_L3q_bPrslU2koIw,1,0,3,tN8U38D4UgB_voEXGwyrGA

But!, my issue came when we quickly realized their roof has TONS of leaks (it was raining)! There were buckets everywhere, tables out of commission for being dripped on & even we were a centimeter away from a steady drip. I was legit worried that the roof was going to just cave in.

They do give generous portions, but the food is extremely bland.  No seasoning was done to the eggs, but the eggs  were cooked properly.

I think making the door a little bit more noticeable would be helpful. It was just a white door with no sign. I honestly thought the front door could've been the back door! 

This place has a home style feel to it. The decor made me feel like I was at grandmas place having breakfast. Very welcoming and warm.

Portions are big. Although I did make sure I didn't get anything that was too big. I looked around at people's food and boy were the portions huge. 

I got red velvet hot cakes which were pretty delish. 1 hot cake can feed 2! I also got a biscuit with gravy. Everytime I order biscuits and gravy there has always been some sort of meat in it, most of the time sausage but theres do not come with sausage. BUT it was my fault to assume this one would. The biscuit was a good size with ton of gravy. 

I really don't like how the kitchen where the cooking is done is very visible. I don't know what it is but I just do not like watching my food being made. That's just a pet peeve of mines.

My pancakes were another part of the story. Very undercooked and extremely doughy. Hard to tell if the lemon blueberry was a good flavor because you were eating half raw pancakes. Pancakes are my guilty pleasure and for that reason it's highly unlikely I will ever return.

4147082,2012-04-09,0,REM8BezFuK4MQ6j2k1I7-Q,"When it comes to Mollie's I am perplexed.  It is like a most other country cafes in that is is homey with big portions at a not so big price.  Part of what confuses me is with use of the letter ""K"" in the name.  What is the purpose of that?  Whimmsey?  Whatever.  At least it is not named after a Karen.  That would make for an awkward set of initials.  Anyhow, second point of confusion, the decor.  There was a patchwork of table, chairs, and booths.  All looked as though they came from several other restaurants.  The chair I was in looked familiar.  My thought was L&L Hawaiin BBQ.  The table was reminiscent of Aloha Kitchen.  Some chairs looked like bamboo and had arm rests.  Other chairs did not.  Did the owners go to some surplus sale and buy what they could?  I don't know.

More important than the atmosphere is the food.  I got a lot of food for $9.99.  A Philly Skillet consisting of home fries topped with chopped beef steak, onion, bell pepper, three scrambled eggs and cheddar cheese.  On the side was two biscuits with gravy.  I was full when I left.  Satisfied though?  Eh.  The potatoes were oviously boiled before they were placed on the griddle.  Home fries are supposed to be browned and somewhat crunchy.  Not soggy.  The steak had a great flavor.  No complaints there.  The menu stated mushrooms were included in this dish.  There were no mushrooms.  Additionally, bell peppers were not mentioned yet had a supporting role.  This was acceptable but I really do like mushrooms.  So Mollie's gets docked points there.  As for the biscuits and gravy.  I've had better.  Heck, I've made better.  The biscuits were small and lacked the fluff I like in a good biscuit.  The gravy had no sausage as a good country gravy should.  It was more of a warm paste seasoned heavily with black pepper.  I hate to say it because I like to support little one-off places like this, but I prefer to go to Denny's for breakfast.

Buttermilk Biscuits
French Toast
Short Stack of Chocolate Chip Buttermilk Pancakes

Locally owned and operated, with two locations stretching the Valley from Southeast to Northwest, it was to Griddlecakes North Jones location that I pointed the GPS on Saturday morning after a late Friday night out, and arriving just prior to 9:30am to a packed house it was to charming youthful service that I was greeted, a small two top on the fringe of the kitchen my seat for the next hour of traditional American breakfast fare.

Clearly a popular choice of locals, the space brimming with folks aged seven months to seventy plus years, water was delivered simultaneously with a menu upon seating and deferring on coffee that smelled just a touch overroasted it a brief perusal of the menu that saw three items ordered, the restaurant's free WiFi keeping me occupied during a twenty minute wait in which I was checked on frequently with water topped off twice.

Not a place to reinvent the wheel, though a few novelties are offered, it was entirely with personal favorites that I decided to test the Griddlecakes' kitchen and after eschewing the warmed pseudo-syrup in favor of good stuff brought from home my first bites of the restaurant's French Toast spoke to a classic presentation really no different than that which can be made at home, the bread a store-bought eggy sort with just enough cinnamon and vanilla in the batter to tickle the palate with the center was still just a touch doughy, a longer soak perhaps overlooked by a line-cook facing the weekend morning crush.

Moving next to a short stack of pancakes, billed as 'large,' by my young server and topped with a $1.99 surcharge of chocolate chips, suffice it to say that pancakes double the size of those offered at Griddlecakes are offered at no-less than a dozen spots in Las Vegas and although preparation was 'good enough' given the $5.99 tab these too were nothing special, the meal's lone standout a pair of buttermilk biscuits that were undoubtedly house-made given their oblong flattened shape and all the better for it with ample notes of buttermilk still notable after a lacquer of butter and honey, both.

A competent breakfast kitchen serving up American standards at a fair price, Griddlecakes is a good locals spot for those in the Northwest, and presumably the Southeast, but certainly not a destination - similar fare found at a similar price at not only several other mom n' pop places, but also in the cafes of several major casino cafes 24-hours a day.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,6,5,2,GHcTmtLW1m26DDuJ-7Grvw

This reminds me of the mom and pop shops we used to have back home and it definently was an awesome experience. I will def have to come back and bring the whole family. The staff here is pretty awesome, they are attentive and come around before my coffee was even close to being done. The pancakes were pretty amazing in my opinion (very fresh) but beyond else it provided me with a taste of home. Great food, great staff, great people ! what else can you ask for !",2O5A-LnYjLonj6JyWSzarA,0,0,5,0vPnqRiiCwr2Nxt5QSK0hQ
5906431,2016-06-12,0,REM8BezFuK4MQ6j2k1I7-Q,This place has changed to Stacks and Yolks so we decided to give it another try. What a change!!! Food was great. Service was great. Food was a little slow coming out because there was a car show but worth the wait. Definitely worth another look if you've been to previous restaurant.,vgjLo3iUrG4Y-JG5Of_6lw,0,0,5,wlAo_X6DFSfJHeml0hPLeA

My eggs and bacon came up and they sat there instead of being served while they're hot she chose to add up some tickets and wait for my pancakes. The eggs were very good, they were scrambled just right good flavor pity they were now room temperature, I would have enjoyed them more hot. The pancakes were dense doughy like and I could taste some of the lemon, not the blueberry, they had a spoonful of blueberry preserve on them. No matter how much syrup they were still kinda hard to eat because of the density. Overall not super friendly environment.

The waitress and other staff discussed how the owner only hires young girls only, that's not something that the public needs to know. This was a one time visit for me, despite the great eggs everything else is sort of off",864uMSFGP4_muuDV6hJsbQ,1,0,2,eOIjsuGNHmXTMqcmAUCkPQ

I ordered the Grilled chicken & eggs, Chicken came out pink inside, eggs were cold and muffin was coming out after. I asked the waitress to take back the undercooked chicken and she looked at me crazy, and then I asked if she could at least leave the eggs so they didn't get cold, she thought that wasn't normal either. She finally brought me back a plate to take the eggs off and took back the exact same piece of chicken to cook it after I had already sliced it. Health code states that you must re-cook a fresh piece of food and discard the one that she took back from the customer. So this was already a violation of health code, but I really don't think they care. Oh and yes the waitress never said her name and just said can I take your order, she could not keep up with the tables. Coffee cup remained empty for over 10 minutes and nobody bothered to see if we needed more of anything. She then got me an iced tea and never gave me a straw with it, when I finally asked for one she gave me one with an end that was already open. This place is a joke and I will never go there again and waste my money. It's very obvious there isn't some sort of standard of anything!

They have not closed the name changed to Stacks n Yolks!",kOqcNFcpDl3h8vFNJ7FwWA,0,0,1,fjj5YgUEfp_ZQZsmX5sjZQ
