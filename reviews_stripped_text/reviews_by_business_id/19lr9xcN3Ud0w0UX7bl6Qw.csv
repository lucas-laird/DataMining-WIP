I finish getting both me and my daughters sandwiches, I look at the total price of our sandwiches and it came out to 14 dollars?!?! My sandwich was only 4 dollars and the kids meal was 4 dollars!!! They charged me for separate Juice box, chips, extra 2 dollars for chicken! I thought they would be nice enough for replace the other item for the ones I was charged for?

You can't say that for many Subway's and with them rolling out there new breakfast menu it helps a lot, check out the english muffin breakfast sandwiches, they are great!  As for everything else it's a Subway, there is not much more you can say, the staff is friendly and the store itself is usually pretty clean, just about what you would expect from any Subway.",aT_AzbpcsbodNNtFzPqRVg,3,0,4,pDKQAlu3_MgAahxOesRacw

The food however was very disappointing. When I got home the bread was hard & very dry. The cheese wasn't melted, over all the three sandwiches tasted stale. They were scraping the bottom of the containers of the toppings. They should refill sooner & use fresh ingredients.",rne6VsHHYQXANubhDWWm5A,1,0,1,X1pZ8xeHG07puVzUMBDTOg

1598732,2018-01-14,0,19lr9xcN3Ud0w0UX7bl6Qw,"Omg. First time in here and never going back. The family and I wanted to grab some sandwiches for lunch but had we known the service would be pretty darn awful, we would've gone elsewhere! 
First and foremost I noticed that the Caucasian girl who was making sandwiches completely ignored the fact that we were in line and started refilling the napkins! I mean, who does that when there is a line! Or at least tell us that someone will be right with us. The other girl, who looked Asian, was also doing something else and after a few minutes, finally asked if we had been helped. Obviously not since we were just standing there. So, she finally takes our order but I have never seen anyone move that slow before - from the cutting of the bread to the placing of the meat and cheese... and then we asked for another sandwich and again took forever just to cut the bread and place the meat. I've seen Port of Subs workers go faster and they cut their meats individually per order! I ask for light mayo and mustard for the 1st sandwich which every sandwich place I've gone to has meant ""not too much"" but apparently to her it meant ""lite"" so the sandwich was just doused with mayo and mustard! It was a lot! I was livid. I do want to point out how it was a bit odd that the Caucasian girl didn't help us but then right after the Asian girl started helping us, she helped the next person who was also Caucasian... hmmmm...  I don't know, kinda odd... anyway, this place had awful service and the sandwiches were not good. There goes $20 down the drain. And the pastrami gave me a bad stomachache. Go elsewhere if you want sandwiches. Definitely gonna opt to drive a lil further down for Port of Subs next time.",YSDJnpPocWMT2aX34K3sFQ,1,0,1,FZKaphkSnpkkLhCwAtc2ag

We witness him yell at this customer multiple times because he couldn't hear him. After that we were next he seemed angry for no reason and when we asked him to substitute something he threw what he had picked up in his hand angrily back to the food area!! The two cashiers were nice but he was just being rude to all his customers! It is never acceptable to yell at customers that way specially since the customer he was dealing with was an older gentlemen who just had a softer voice.,FtOPfNC2VKFmVSmc_446Bg,0,0,1,vPY0dVaqZR_IM1f9QwzIoA

So we walk in and look at the tuna. The crusty ice cream scoop made me want to puke. In the tuna was cheese and bits of olives and meats ewwwww. 
The employee at work all she said was I just placed it in their a moment ago. Really that's sad that she would be so nasty how on earth can anyone put something so nasty inside something that people would eat.

Anyway... I had awesome customer service and since the gentlemen taking my sandwich order had a shirt that said ""meltastic""... I thought I would try one of their new melty subs. It seems as if they always have something new going on --- I like that. The sandwich was good, but was kinda irritated that the chicken was super cold even though I ordered the sandwich toasted.

The store was clean and employees were decent enough. I'll come back to this one, especially if it's at 3:00 AM.",2VABkVdFhHGMo7wAqfofGA,5,3,4,qJPWWdbKwRnQm7ZqEEo8MQ

The employee that made my sandwich was so distracted that he had to keep asking me to repeat myself. 

While paying he forgot my change and my cookie. Started walking away and trying to convince another employee to lie and help the ""last customer of the night"" when the window clearly illuminates 24 HOURS!

Not the brightest crayon in the box...

Overall it was loud and unsettling, especially since they were ignoring the customers. Won't return to this subway late anymore.",wxkXoO2zlb2C2mYEwgL5cg,0,0,1,wB5jdrFg8PUZdGEQ3SQ7kg

Then my sons ordered a meatball sub and the guy kept insisting on it being toasted even after we humbly declined. Finally they got the order right after after 10 minutes of explanation.

After using the infamous cough for attention, she finally heard us and apologized which was all I wanted to hear. Would've gave in to 4 stars until I found out they were out of ham, spinach, and bell peppers (some of my preferred ingredients). For a 24/7 location, I've never seen a Subway so cleaned out. Could it be that the employee was to lazy to prep the missing ingredients, or management didn't do their job on calculating the amount to order? Either way, for the inconvenience I was STILL charged extra for Avocado.",A1yK1QyPaahfwp38zqn2Bg,7,5,2,NE1xQfTL7QwzOaJhmQXThA

This is a great location the staff are super friendly I come here at least twice a week if not more because they are so great. They remember me and my sandwich every time I walk in and I am always greeted with a hi welcome to subway on the way in the door. Anyone who says the customer service in here is lacking is probably walking in like a dick because I have never seen a single one of these employees be rude or even testy with a customer.

4764560,2015-12-06,1,19lr9xcN3Ud0w0UX7bl6Qw,"I travel about 15 minutes, passing 5+ Subways, just to get to this location. I love eating here and I do rather often. I enjoy almost everything about this particular location.

For starters, like I mentioned in my tip, this place is the cleanest Subway I've ever been to. The veggies are always fresh looking. The veggie containers are always full. The meats are well separated and equally proportioned. The cookies are always organized and stocked. The chips are always stocked and front faced. The floors, tables and glass are usually spotless. I really appreciate a nice and clean restaurant and they do a great job at keeping me happy.

Now, I, like anyone else, enjoy good a sandwich. I will go out of my way, obviously, to get a well made and good tasting sandwich. My only requirement is that it's made exactly like I like it.

For the most part, my sandwiches are always made correctly. When I say correctly, I mean, if I ask for light lettuce, I don't want a whole pile of it, or if I ask for extra pickles, I don't want 2 or 3 extra.

Sam, my favorite sandwich artist here, has really good customer service skills. He know damn well he doesn't care about what happened to Jared, but every-time I comment on it, he always responds lol. He gives me a full conversation each and every time lol. He's super cool. I wish the lady's would pick up on his good vibes.

They accidentally switched my sandwich with another customer's sandwich. I called right back up to the store and Sam put my name down for a free sandwich. I wasnt even mad. I just like that fact that when I called back and described myself as the ""chubby girl"", he dismissed it and said the lady that ordered the steak. I thought to myself, he's a nice guy, because I would have said, ""oh yeah, I know, ""the fat one"".""

I also left my debit card there when I went to get my free sandwich. I wouldn't have known anything about it but one of the ladies called and told me. I was so thankful. I know some companies, with employees with no integrity, would have had a field day with my card.

One of the only complaints is, the ladies always talk over my sandwiches. I tell them exactly how I like it, there's no need to really talk over them. I just don't like the idea of them getting excited and spitting on my food. A lot of people spit when they talk. Maybe it's a good idea to get mouth covers for sandwich artist.

I will definitely go back. They should give me Frequent Sub Eater Card. I would really recommend this place then.",trO6aQpnXxRXqIyKQ_ryrQ,1,1,4,EwkINXX1Keiqh7UWpZATBw
4849270,2017-02-21,0,19lr9xcN3Ud0w0UX7bl6Qw,The man who is very clearly the owner/manager was sitting at a corner table while I ate my food. He was quiet other than when an employee asked a question (rather rudely) and he responded by rudely yelling in her direction. There were two men ordering sandwiches at this time. When I was ordering my sandwich the employee was too busy chatting with her fellow employee joking around to pay attention to what I was ordering.

I ordered a 6-inch sandwich with a meal, which comes with a drink and 2 cookies. He made the wrong sandwich in front of me, which I was willing to overlook because I was so hungry. Then I realized that the meal he gave me came with only 1 cookie, and the soda was flat. He also charged me for a footlong with the cookie and drink a la carte (no meal deal, more expensive).

I brought all of this to his attention, but he was just clueless about everything. I had to explain to him what the menu said about the 2 cookies and drink, and he couldn't figure out how to get me a refund.
