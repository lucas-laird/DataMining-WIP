28220,2014-08-10,0,eduRavkml8awmPachSZXuw,"I was disappointed after dining here for a Sunday happy hour. The bar area was crowded and loud so my party decided to try to sit at a table on the patio. The outside table had not been wiped down thoroughly and there were a few flies swarming around so we decided to wait for a table to open up in the bar/lounge area so that we could order from the happy hour menu. 

We ordered the calamari, which was probably the best item we tried but was not that impressive compared to many others in the area. We also ordered the cheeseburger sliders which were too pink, and the fiery shrimp and crab crunch rolls which were just ok but nothing special. 

Our food was delivered before we received plates, so we had to get up and ask the bartender to provide some for us.  And our server, who was rushing around did not return to ask how our food turned out or if we would like to order anything else. 

I don't plan on returning here.",D6Svy1ujwTRwjYRBWWOyow,3,0,2,Nql5D7RRDV15JoZeBC6bUQ
80815,2016-06-16,0,eduRavkml8awmPachSZXuw,"Kona Grill is a tough place for me to review. It's in a great location and is upscale, comfortable, and has excellent service. The outdoor seating is well laid out and has misters that make it very tolerable on a warm day. 

But.... the food is vastly overpriced and the portions are smaller that I would expect. I went there a few weekends ago with a large group and we ordered a mix of dishes. I had a Cuban sandwich and a CA roll.  The sandwich was meh, just ok. The wife had pork tenderloin and did not like it. The CA roll was good, but anyone should be able to get that roll right. 

For the price, I was a little disappointed. If you are looking for a place to hang with friends, this would be a good choice.  For me, I was looking for a great meal and Kona did not quite deliver.",NjYwlzI5liKbe6RZWyo96A,2,1,3,J7_Ks7sCCvH0PQYT4K6uww

I came to Las Vegas for my grandsons graduation.  After graduation a group of family and friend (16 of us) went to the Kona Grill for lunch Grandson's graduation , family and friends (16 of us)  I had the Big Kahuna cheese burger and it was the best burgerI I have ever had.  My son had the Kona chopped salad . We continued to go there often. I moved to Las Vegas last winter and was anxious for the re-opening.  Yesterday was my son's birthday and I wanted to take to lunch.  He ordered the Kona chopped salad and it was one-half the size--I ordered the burger  it had NO flavor--the onions were not carmelized they were grilled

90863,2016-07-11,0,eduRavkml8awmPachSZXuw,Had the worst experience today at Kona Grill.  My wife and I went in for lunch.  There was no one to greet us at the door so we went and sat at the bar.  The bartender came over and dropped off menus and left.  We sat there for a while and he continued to serve everyone around us but never asked what we would like to drink.  I finally got his attention and he came over.  He said he did not like to bother people when they were on the phone.  I told him I was on hold on a business call and it was ok we could give him our drink order.  He then told me he would not be serving us alcohol at the bar and we could go find a table and be served.  I told him we were there for lunch and did not want alcohol. He proceeded to take the menus and told us again to go find a table he would not be serving us alcohol at the bar.  We got up and I asked to speak to manager.  I believe he did not want to serve my wife and I because my wife took a call from her mother and was speaking Spanish while on the call that lasted about 2 minutes.  Just did not want to service Hispanics today I guess.,b4SaahWSxa1rV4LY1dUHJw,0,0,1,JbazH5lvjaBNDoi9vFLBxA

And for non-sushi fans, Kona Grill has an extensive menu of ""favorites"" including meatloaf, pizza, burgers.  I had a bite of a friend's pepperoni pizza and it was really good with a nice, thin crust.

Only bummer is that the place got rid of its amazing banana pudding.  It was one of my favorite desserts anywhere so I was upset to see it removed from the menu.",yB7V5yP1tmz2Q3AWlUdyeA,0,0,4,w-g5UjGpFyMzakJURP-9Jg

The place was once cozy and dark, classy and relatively quiet. Now... there are big screen tvs on every wall, most of the booths are gone, and the atmosphere is one of a cheap sports bar. LOUD is an understatement. I ordered Brandy and ginger with a lemon twist, what I received was brandy and water with a rind from a completely rotten lime wedge... yuck.  So they don't even do the bar scene well. I ordered the macadamia nut encrusted roasted pork tenderloin in a mushroom sauce... what I received was probably days old, pan seared DRIED out pork something... no macadamia nuts... no mushroom sauce, 4 tiny slices of shriveled mushroom on the plate covered with fried onions and a mountain of potatoes with completely limp bok choy. Terrible meal. The only reason I gave the place 1 star is the waitress was very sweet, very apologetic about the drink, and I didn't have it in me to tell her just how awful the meal was after she was so nice.",v2ES0OZIcVgGjYqA0g1AEQ,0,0,1,zFxjUNjpG5l3Ev6LwMn9zA

While not the cheapest place, you certainly won't break the bank here either.  The service has always been good, and the food is consistently delicious.

My favorite dish is the pork tenderloin.  Never overcooked and the white cheddar mashed potatoes are scrumptious!  Tried the lemon grass crusted halibut this past visit and loved it.  Great texture and flavors.

You either have to sit at the bar or outside on the patio for the HH prices. Luckily, it was a nice sunny day so we sat outside. 

The bf and I were craving sushi (although not the BEST place to come for sushi) -- their sushi was suffice. Ordered some salmon nigiri and spicy tuna roll. Also got the tuna nachos which was seared sliced ahi on fried wonton chips.. not what I expected but nonetheless delicious. Also, got a couple martinis and beers to wash it all down.

Service was overall mediocre.. Took us a while to even get a menu.

180984,2013-06-15,0,eduRavkml8awmPachSZXuw,"We went for a friend's birthday party, with a large group of 9 people.  Of course, this makes service difficult, so I'm willing to cut the server some slack.  He didn't do a bad job..He gets 1 star for that.

Another 2 stars for the amazing appetizer! I would return just to have that sweet and spicy shrimp again.  3 starts in total so far...

I wouldn't get another entree there, though.  It's overpriced.      While the steak was cooked perfectly medium and juicy, there were no seasonings on it.  That was in direct contrast with the ""seasonal veggies"" which was just broccoli with 2 tiny pieces of what I think was eggplant...it didn't matter, because all I could taste was sesame seed.  I actually spit it back out. I've never done that before. I've also never left a large amount of food on my plate without requesting a to go box.  Waiter asked if I wanted one...I said no, told him I didn't like it because it was a bland steak and just not good.  He took the plate...no apology and no offer to make it right.  3/4 of that meal was thrown out and I still had to pay full price...$31! Plus the appetizer..my bill for just me...over $50.  1 star lost for the bad food and another lost for the lack of attention to my feedback about the quality of my meal.  Down to 1 star again.

The manager was rude. We called her over to discuss issues we had with our food...I wasn't the only one with substandard food at our table.  They served one party member old french fries and another item clearly sat under the heat lamps while the rest of our meals were finished. None of us felt she handled herself well under the circumstances.  That's 1 star lost...but that's 0 stars...and we can't give 0 starts on Yelp.

So I'll give another 1 star for the ambiance and another for the location...but take away another because the ladies room was gross.  That's 1 star.

I really want to give them more than 1 star, so let's give that amazing shrimp a 3rd star...it really was THAT good.

All in all, I may go back for happy hour sometime and have the shrimp and give this place another chance, but I'm not in a hurry.  I really wanted to like this place, but it was disappointing.",TnhTyk1qfJ8jL2bHpeTrhQ,1,0,2,3DXVuKLjLIeMVs-jcVJeeg

207920,2013-12-30,0,eduRavkml8awmPachSZXuw,"Honestly we probably would not have come here because of the horrible atmosphere that is created by all the creeps renting fancy cars so they can park in front of kona and make women feel uncomfortable by the way they watch them. ( much like a dog watching a treat)....but it looked empty so it must have been too cold for them and we thought it was happy hour so we said why not?( we were hungry)... We sat down waited, waited, waited, (first sign we should have left) only had the happy hour menu so we figured it was happy hour ( there are no times posted on the menu and if no one is going to give you a different one then you would probably just assume).... Anyways started ordering food and he said oh it's not happy hour yet, (its about 9:35)okay we can see past that so we ordered chicken satay (way over priced for four tiny skewers) and the ahi tuna.... The tuna came out quick it was okay, but by the time the satay came out it was already into happy hour (AND the place was EMPTY)... So my friend started eating it, one bite in... RAW CHICKEN!... The waiter just cut off what we were saying and said ""I'll get it fixed"" no apology, no manager, no nothing... We didn't even want it then but because we didn't see him again until that came out another 30min later and we were hungry so we ate it (and it was totally burned on the outside, but again extremely hungry)... We are in the industry and we understand things happen but WOW... Time to pay we figure he was just being silent about the situation and it wouldn't be on the bill, but it was... So, we got no apology, no manager, potential food poisoning and/or salmonella, horrible service, and sub par food, all of which we paid for...there are so many great restaurants in Vegas and this is bottom of the barrel.

The the Asian/Hawaiian theme, the food is on par with many of the places I've been to, without the stuffiness of a white table cloth place. 

This is only for Happy Hour, so I can't really say very much for the al la cart portion of the menu. Great deals on the drinks and food. What I usually get is the sake bombs for 6.50 and some maki rolls for 3 bucks. For a dollar more, the beef sliders and tacos is pretty good for that price! The only thing I probably wouldn't get again is the calamari, just a bit too soggy and bland for my taste. 

The vibe is pretty good, with a mixture of professionals and blue collar working stiffs like me. 

The service is good, but like many busy places, it can get a little slow during prime time, i.e. 7-9pm.  But how can you complain when the value of the food and drink prices are this good?

I like to have the option to do it myself, how often I want , without having someone on top of me, doing it.  I ordered a Margherita, and it came in a short thick men's glass, instead of a Margarita glass.  I am a woman, and it was too masculine for me, and ruined my Margherita experience.  My drink was watered down, and tasted like lime-aide.  Also, the music was too loud, and it was hard to have a conversation, and we went home with headaches.

It's a shame. This place used to be really good and had drool-worthy burgers among other things. Not any more. They've redone their menu; maybe it's a new chef or different management. I didn't bother asking. 

They say hunger is the best condiment, but it didn't help my food at all. It neither tasted bad nor good. Very unsatisfying.",3JtFcbX-IPwhsdOWOiKjTw,0,0,2,74vTnajzfB4kjnYdbxM6hA

The host staff was not very helpful. There is clearly all new staff there including management. They should really work on who they hire because I continuously saw a lady manager being rude to her employees and even some tables. I sure wouldn't want to work for her it made us extremely uncomfortable. Besides that we finally found a table and enjoyed happy hour.

The food was pretty good (I had the chopped salad with macadamia nut crusted chicken), but not great.  We also ordered a sushi roll to share as an appetizer, and that was good.  The three others in my party all said their entrees were ""good,"" too... but no one was raving about any of it.  Our desserts were GIANT and tasted good.

The really bad part of our experience, was definitely our flaky waiter.  As I said, we ordered our sushi as an appetizer... and he even asked if we wanted it before our entrees and we said yes... but after waiting a long time (probably about 20 minutes), our roll came at the same time as our entrees.

Then after we ate our entrees, we sat and sat and sat and sat, waiting for the dessert menu.  After about 20 minutes of not seeing our waiter at all (not even at tables around us), we finally asked a busser if he could find our waiter.  We watched the busser look for him all around the kitchen and the dining room.  I'm not sure where our waiter was hiding, but it took another five minutes just to find him.  When he finally did show up, he gave us our bill without even bringing the dessert menu.

He took the bill back and finally brought us a dessert menu, and we asked him what he recommended.  He said ""let's be honest... I'm gonna tell you everything on the menu is good.""  Umm... ok.

So I don't really want to judge the restaurant on this really bad waiter... because I am sure not EVERY waiter there is that awful... but with so many other great places to eat in town, we definitely won't be going back any time soon.",9JSCHAgXnzQnna1a3crJOA,0,0,2,DFvUtjRCJn62HZY46PqZeQ

Came back and said we had to sit outside or at the sushi bar. We decided outside even though it was cold. We were directed outside and had to find our own seat after about ten minutes someone finally came up to us and asked to take our drinks then cut us off and asked if we were 21. We aren't so she told us we couldn't sit there and she would show us to the sushi bar the only place we could sit? Then we were walked over there where all the spots were full of dirty dishes and unpicked up tips so we just left. Terrible service and they were offensive.

We sat on the patio. The hostess didn't really help, she didn't even say Hello! I had to go back up to the front to get a menu. 

Once we sat down it took a little longer than we expected to have someone come over. But once he did our drinks came out fast. We asked about specials and the young man was knowledgeable about them but didn't do a good job of ""Selling"" them! We finally settled on two steak sandwiches... Very bland, very fatty piece of meat, little dry and wasn't cook to the temp I had asked for! The bread was good, and the garlic aioli was good but all the rest of it I could pass in life and not care!! 

*Our server did keep our drinks filled ( that gets a star)!

Dessert: hmmm... Yeah another little disappointment! Red velvet cake was dry. But key lime was decent!

I'm not a huge salmon fan, but for some reason I ordered the miso glazed salmon salad for lunch. I really need to be in the mood to order salmon and today I was. Kona Grill did not disappoint. The salmon was cooked perfectly and melted in my mouth. The dressing on the salad is amazing! I would love to get that recipe!  The portion of salmon was huge, something I would expect for dinner. I loved it!

My companion ordered the tacos, a combination of the macadamia nut chicken and the shrimp. She really loved the macadamia nut chicken tacos, but said the shrimp was a bit bland. She said the fried Rice that came with the dish was OK, but not great.

We started the meal by ordering an appetizer calamari.  It had a light dusting of chili on it that was nice and came with a side of aioli.  The calamari was tender and very fresh. The batter however, needed more seasoning. We added a lot of lemon and salt. Once we did that it was delicious.

Something I don't normally comment on are the drinks. We both ordered iced tea. It was probably the best restaurant Ice-T I've ever had. I also want to complement the staff. They were very attentive from the moment we walked in until they said goodbye when we left. If it weren't for the seasoning issue, I would give Kona Grill five stars.

Ms. Whodotoo had the macadamia crusted chicken.  She liked it.  I'll give them a star for that.

The waiter managed to add an extra $5.50 to our bill for a beer we didn't have.  He corrected the error when it was called to his attention.  Given that there were four items on our bill (two dinners and two beverages), I suppose the waiter can be forgiven for his confusion.

They didn't point us in the right direction or (god forbid) show us where it was in the oddly situated restaurant, so we wandered past the host stand and sat at the sushi bar. 

After we sat down we asked the sushi chef if happy hour was only at the sushi bar, and he said no, that it was also at the main bar and on the patio. The hostess could have told us this, or at least given us menus. We ended up ordering off the tiny happy hour menu that was already on the bar.

Our server took FOREVER to take our order, and even longer to bring our drinks. They looked semi-busy so I can overlook this, but I was missing a share plate and chopsticks for half the meal, which I had to ask for twice. 

Apparently a lot of people ordered sushi, but there was no food runner, so at one point there were TWELVE plates of sushi up in the window and no one to take them to the tables. During this time at least seven people walked by and did nothing about it.

It's a Friday night and we were in and out in under an hour not by choice. I wanted the pina colada and our server quickly responded with we don't have a blender and its crap if get the mojito...ok...they have a brisket burger special which my husband ordered only for our server Destiny( really a pleasant girl who really is a good server) to come back and tell us they don't have any brisket...it's a Friday at 650 and you are out of a special...poor planning on the managers part. So we get our sushi and the regular burger which was all fantastic. We aren't even half way through the entree when Destiny asks us if we are having dessert. Can we finish our entrees and see how we feel? We decided against dessert rather quickly and within two minutes of us saying we weren't going to have anything else she had dropped the check. My husband was in the middle of his burger. Nothing worse then feeling super rushed on date night. We paid in cash and she quickly picked up the bill just has my husband finished his burger. We most likely would return for the food cause it is really good but probably stick to the bar area. I love dessert and probably would have had some but feeling rushed put a damper on things so we went to the Cheesecake Factory next door for some nice cheesecake.,Ec7k5Nxp1rohv1f1nMU_ig,0,0,3,yaQFT-TzGkGO_Wn0pJDG1w

I've eaten here on multiple occasions,  and each time, the food, service, and cleanliness is worse than the previous. Because of the nice ambiance and reasonably priced happy hour, I attempt to justify returning again, but without fail, this restaurant continues to disappoint. Not only is the floor covered in food and trash, the placemats are LITERALLY STUCK to the tables. I only noticed this after the table was haphazardly wiped down by one of their disgruntled employees, and I went to flip my placemat that was crusted with food debris. Big mistake. After prying it loose from the table, I find that I was apparently looking at the ""clean"" side. This has occurred not only once, but three times total. 

Needless to say that at this point, I will no longer return. If this is the way the front of the house is maintained, I can only imagine the numerous health code violations in the back of the house. Extremely disappointing for a venue with ample potential.

My party ordered the asparagus salad and a house salad with salmon. Both salads were not satisfactory. The lettuce was very wilted and disgusting. One salad was also soaked in dressing that made it unpleasant.  As usual, the drinks were a hit or miss. But the citrus punch was a winner today. Three stars only for the cute waiter, Amir!

We sat at the bar and were mostly ignored, and had to flag down attention when we wanted something. Bartenders were gossiping about another customer and quite loudly. Was bit surprised how open it was. They seem kind of stuck up too. I thought it was a bit unprofessional and immature. Think they need better customer service there.

So, to complete my review. Delicious food. Not so great staff.

Update: I have raised this review to 4 stars from 3. We went back to give it another go.  It was a slow night there.

1314369,2010-12-22,0,eduRavkml8awmPachSZXuw,"I came home to Las Vegas to spend time with family for the holidays. My mom and stepdad decided to take me here for dinner while I'm here. The two of them kept raving about how it's ""sooooo gooood"" and that there is ""nothing bad here at all!"" Naturally, I kept a clear mind and tasted everything they ordered to add to my Yelp review.

We came on a Tuesday evening around 8:30pm. It was aesthetically pleasing at night time. Dim lights, gentle colors, very nice decor, sophisticated. I'd say it's a pretty nice date place. The front area to the left was the bar which was separated from the normal dining area by glass. The noise level wasn't too distracting and you could just hear the music. But it wasn't obnoxious or anything like that. They played a lot of music that I used to listen in in the early '00s. 

We ordered the Crab Special sushi roll as an appetizer. It wasn't very impressive. Maybe I've just had my fair share of sushi places, or maybe it was a bad night. But it was a so-so roll for me and I probably wouldn't choose to get it again. Then again, it was a simple crab roll, so maybe it's just me. As for entrees, my stepdad ordered a caesar salad with the macadamia nut chicken added in. He had upgraded to an entree size, and I must say that it was pretty big. They added in these cheese cracker like things that added a nice touch to the salad. My mom ordered the Pan-Asian Noodle dish because they had gotten it before and fell in love. It was a warm udon noodle with seasoned beef. I only tasted the noodle and it was really, really full of flavor. The presentation made the dish seem small, but don't let that deceive you! There's quite a bit there to fill you up. I had the Macadamia Nut Chicken entree. It had two large pieces of crispy chicken covered in their shoyu-cream sauce. The combination was delicious! Not too creamy and not too bland. The chicken was also very tender. There was also a side of string beans which were a little too salty for my liking. It was cooked with a lot of butter and garlic. Luckily, there was a side of garlic mashed potatoes to balance the flavor. The pineapple-papaya marmalade was really refreshing as well. If I had to score the dish itself on a scale of 1 to 10, I'd give it a 7. The serving size was also very generous, I ended up taking half of it home even after offering my parents some. 

Although I missed her name, the waitress that served us was very kind. She made sure to check on us often and answered any questions that we had. She also provided more info on other dishes and gave recommendations. So based on her, I'd say the place had pretty good customer service. 

So with two sushi rolls and three entrees, we spent a total of about $70. Not too bad. I wouldn't go all the time, but every once in a while would be nice.

Next time I should try to go with a few friend to check out the happy hour. The people there seemed to be having a lot of fun!",G23Zv3XN_L9WrzpLQM9tMw,1,0,4,Tc_WonIV5d7zttpGonbxwQ

Kona has a good quality standard, that rates with many other mid-range chains.  I do really appreciate the indoor/outdoor bar layout.  That's a good design and works well for quite a few places here in town.  

Negative points for Boca Park's parking situation.  Sorry to pass those along to Kona, but I would do so for any of the establishments in that strip.  Nothing like parking at REI and walking across a blazing parking lot to have a beer and appetizers.

The sushi bar was vacant except for a lonely women in LBD.  My date didn't want me to flirt, so we sat inside the dark dining room.  Service was fine, no complaints, no problems, everything on the order correct. 

I was buffeted out and wanted some good food.  My cheeseburger was perfect.  A large thick patty on a toasted bun with fully melted cheddar cheese.  They didn't put lettuce on the burger, which is just fine with me.  I rated this the best burger I ate this year.  My date had shrimp penne pasta which was plentiful and tasty. Pasta al dente, not mush.  The other diner had the pork steak and it was perfectly done. Very thick and flavorful cut of pork steak.

I'm surprised by the negative reviews here.  This is Kona Grill, with a laid back Hawaiian ambience.  This is now my favorite Las Vegas eatery.  I recommend this to anyone who enjoys Hawaiian influenced food style without the leis and hula skirts.

They seem to recognize that their patio vibe and generous happy hour selections, along with the see and be seen drive by location in Boca Park are a winning combo.  Lately, I see all new faces within the staff, and the last couple of visits I've noticed some fairly heavy hip hop music being played in the bar/patio area. I hope this isn't the telltale sign of the demise (or last ditch effort to pull out of a slump) of the bar. The reggae or house music that used to be the regular is what set the tone for a great time (think beach vibe on a beautiful Sunday, and trendy lounge on any summer week night after 9pm). The ""older"" Summerlin singles were even able to tolerate it, and those guys are in there spitting some major game on the regular. Rumor is, the restaurant is closing soon for a remodel to make a second story patio. As long as it isn't constant rap and hip hop playing through the speakers, I look forward to some fresh changes at Kona!

1447247,2016-07-31,1,eduRavkml8awmPachSZXuw,My husband and I LOVED kona before the remodel. The first time we went after the remodel we had no idea there was a while new staff and management. It was pretty hot outside and the happy hour seating was packed and in the past before the remodel and old management the manager would let us sit inside with our kids and still give us the happy hour prices. We asked to sit inside and the waitress told us we had to go outside for happy hour and wait for a table and didn't offer us any drinks or anything. The manager came and told us to go outside because they don't allow happy hour menu inside and had no exceptions. We went back in forth for a while him telling us how he asked a family before us to go outside and wait for a table as well. Bottom line the new management sucks or at least the new manager.,M3EHVWDyECdNwOoy-Zsiaw,2,0,1,8ZWFkzO7N9yXs1Q1EXzhUA
1467622,2016-04-17,0,eduRavkml8awmPachSZXuw,"Came here on a Saturday evening for a friend's birthday.  A reservation was made ahead of time for a party of 6 and a baby. Most of our party was already seated, but my other half and I arrived a little later than expected. I walked in to the restaurant, and was not greeted at all by the hostess, who seemed to be having a conversation with someone sitting next to the host/hostess stand. Anyways, we got to the table where the rest of our party was seated. What I didn't understand is that 6 adults were assigned to sit in a booth that seems to only comfortably sit 4 people. I would have appreciated a much more comfortable seating arrangement especially because we had put in a reservation. 

Staff- Our waitress was kind and took care of us. She brought us refills before we were finished with our drink. Our waitress was probably one of the only things that I could walk away feeling satisfied with. 

The food- I ordered the Lemon-Garlic Shrimp Penne, which turned out to be much spicier that I anticipated. In the description on the menu, the entree consisted of Parmesan, Baby Arugula, Roasted Tomatoes, Lemon Cream and Garlic Bread. In my opinion, a little note of the spice should be added Just in case anyone has a problem with spicy food. I toughed out the kick of the spice, however, another person in my party needed to return her entree because she cannot eat anything spicy. It was tasty, just a tad too spicy for my liking. Yes I could have returned my plate to ask for the dish to be less spicy, but i chose not to since it was busy and I was hungry.",HIRK4KpH3H3Vl-qg2OrBNA,1,0,2,AkV05rWUHSlPR3gpd5mPoQ

1543832,2012-04-15,0,eduRavkml8awmPachSZXuw,"Hubby & I stopped by for a late lunch yesterday and had a very mixed bag of quality.  

Ordered two nigiri, the smoked salmon was excellent but the albacore was so vinegared up that it even disgusted me.. and I love vinegar.

Informed our server, Justen, and he said he would inform them of this problem.  Then, entrees arrived.. hubby's Grilled Ribeye Sandwich worked for him, but my Seared Scallops & Bacon with Citrus Aioli was beyond boring.  While I didn't expect much flavor from the scallops, there was absolutely none from the aioli, and barely any even from the bacon.  It was ridiculously tiny, four small scallops that were butterflied and then topped.. less food than any one nigiri.  I added a bit of lime juice from the plate decor, and that helped a teensy bit.. but not enough.

In the meantime, our server has disappeared on us.. we haven't seen diddly since our entrees arrived and I mentioned the vinegar overdose.  Neither of us had any soda left in our glasses, but nothing we could do about it.  

We finally flagged Justen down and requested our check, at which point he offered us soda refills.  Really?  There was no attempt to offer a replacement on the failed nigiri, there was no service while we were dining.. hope he enjoyed the tiny tip, as I deducted the nigiri from that portion of the tab.

Will we return?  Nope.  One good nigiri and one decent sandwich doesn't make up for boring food and pathetic service.",wOpzh1RYcz-SLu55NEaaBg,0,0,1,OvZfI_LQlncxImIP0bsL-A

After a long wait, our waitress informed us she'd been ""cut"" for the night. Our replacement waiter was nice but obviously overwhelmed. Our drink was watered down, and our waiter showed no interest in rectifying the situation. Food for each member of our party arrived at different times, and my salad and flatbread arrived at the same time (a pet peeve, and a sign nobody's minding the store). The sushi was passable, but my Margherita pizza was blasphemous and awful. Empty plates sat on our table for 20-30 minutes and even after asking other servers to ask our server about the check, it took another 10 minutes to get it. The agonizingly slow service was clearly the result of poor management, as servers were over-tasked. A series of small annoyances (soy dishes, but no soy sauce; having to ask multiple times for silverware; long periods of inattentiveness) added up to a disappointing experience on what was supposed to be a special occasion. Poorly-trained staff, inept management, lack of attention to details and customer service, mediocre food and inflated prices are not something I will endure again.",yMfwIZwtsCst2wRl8VNplg,0,0,1,8sHkDQ8eY74--6ZuTL9tXQ

1568367,2012-08-21,4,eduRavkml8awmPachSZXuw,"This was our third stop during our Sunday bar hopping schedule. Typically, I read up on the places near by as we munch an appetizer and savor a tasty beverage. On this occasion we skipped that formality as the previous bartender said that Kona had great food and cheap happy hour prices.

When we arrived, we quickly found two seats at the outdoor bar. I will have to give them a nod for places to people watch. Across from us was a Wilem Dafoe look alike in a black wife beater. He kept muttering to himself (I secretly suspect that he was arguing with himself). A couple of seats down from him was a dude that was rockin the full beach dude hair...party on bra

Ok back to Kona, happy hour drinks were ok, and they were cheap ($5), but the ultra lounge bartenders seemed busier than necessary. We finally settle on a sushi roll for our obligatory app.

Now sushi is one of those dishes that takes a great deal of finesse and precision. You are basically buying about A cup of rice and some uncooked tasties for wrap and filling. Our roll was a happy hour special, so $5 for what would normally cost $10.

What we got was a sad mangled roll. The pieces were so poorly cut, from the side it looked like a cell phone add showing how many bars you can get in this area. The taste was ok, if a bit bland, and the serving temp was decidedly too warm for sushi.

Ok, bottom line here folks, stop buy Kona for happy hour drinks, watch the carnival of lost souls huddled around the bar, and skip the food.",GTcKUjRulTRN_XxehMgSZQ,3,1,2,CcF4sbEDU0deeojHCB5kaw

Just recently we went to Kona for happy hour and although the bar area was crowded (they only offer the happy hour menu on their patio, in the bar area, and at the sushi bar) we were able to find stools right at the main bar. There was actually very ample counterspace (something you may or may not get in certain restaurants when ordering food at the bar) and service was very good.

We ordered items off the happy hour menu:
-chardonnay
-spicy tuna roll
-bbq chicken flatbread
-chicken lettuce cups
-steak wrap

My favorites were the flatbread and lettuce cups, although everything tasted very good. The best part was the bill...$28! You really can't beat that.",haSh72Q0MsQZUpWPeVgp0Q,3,1,5,qQp5skDqwVas1tf8WUftgA

I wait about maybe 10 more minutes until this lady comes out, I didn't even know she worked there because she was wearing regular clothes. I told her my concern and she gave me an attitude about how she just dropped off the food a second ago. That's still about 40 min for three plates.

For some reason you can't get happy hour if you are seated at a normal table. And if you are under 21 the ONLY place you can sit is at the sushi bar.

I'm 20 years old, I shouldn't be made to feel like I'm a child and need to be separated from other adults. I find this extremely ridiculous. Also it's nearly impossible to receive service. I sat for 10 minutes before a waiter even took my drink order. Our waiter wasn't even polite in the slightest.

1662051,2013-01-10,0,eduRavkml8awmPachSZXuw,"We arrived and were promptly seated. We were greeted by our server but she never introduced herself throughout the entire experience. She seemed pleasant enough and warmly asked us what we would like to drink. She left and got our drinks and then returned with a root beer and a sierra mist with no ice for my fiance. My fiance let her know it was out of syrup and she apologized and quickly grabbed another. Note: We are both servers in town so we extraordinarily understanding of service type things because we do it for a living. We put in a order for two of the flat breads and our server disappeared and returned soon after with our share plates. Seems great, right? I thought so, up to that point. She came back and took our order, a burger medium well for my fiance with an extra side of mushrooms and onion straws so she could add them herself and a order of sweet potato fries. As for me I ordered three sushi rolls: a Caterpillar Roll, a Wave Roll, and a Soft Shell Crab Roll. We received our two flat breads relatively fast and were excited to try the new one we'd never had before. We already loved the Margarita one and were looking forward to trying the veggie one. My fiance mentioned to me that we needed salt and napkins. I looked around and saw our server talking to the booths next to us for quite a while each time. Again, understandable. We are servers also and understand some tables are more demanding or maybe they are just friendly. We waited for about 5 minutes until finally I caught her as she was walking by our table and asked for the salt and napkins. If I had not stopped her she would've been gone and I know this because I caught her at the end of the booth almost past us without her checking on us. She finally returned with our napkins and salt around 10 minutes later. I salted my flat bread and dug in. As usual it was tasty and my fiance really enjoyed the steak one that she got minus the bleu cheese. I started to run low on my bottled root beer and again I looked for our server and she was either nowhere to be found or she was talking to another table for like 3 plus minutes. This wouldn't bother me but she never once in our entire dinner did the same with us. We were treated as second thoughts and this was reinforced by our entire experience. My root beer finally ran out and I was starting to get annoyed. I set it to the end of the table next to the glass with just ice and watched her talk to yet another table for about 4 minutes. Finally she walked by and noticed my drink and asked us if we wanted refills. I ordered two root beers this time around because my pet peeve is to not have a drink while I am eating and I predicted I wouldn't easily get another root beer if I ordered just one. She brought these out and we went about eating our starters. We decided to behave ourselves because we had lots of great food coming and didn't want to fill up on the flat breads and that's when my fiance first noticed her burger sitting in the window. We could see because our booth was pointed straight to the kitchen. I took out my clock and marked the time, 7:24pm. The food and burger didn't actually get delivered to us until 7:32. Her burger just sat up there dying in the window. When our food was finally delivered they dropped the burger, fries, and the extra side of sauce that comes with the sweet fries and the server explained it was great. As for my food they plopped down the plates in front of me without ever identifying which rolls were which and then left. My fiance asked for some ketchup and mayo and the server returned with it rather quickly. My fiance was blown away by the size of the burger and despite being in the window for such a long time she said it was tasty. She did notice that the grilled onions that are supposed to come on the burger were not there but made peace with it. Our server did check back on us a few minutes after we began eating and asked us how everything was. This was the only time she came and checked on us until we were almost finished. Note: My fiance didn't know the grilled onions were missing until after this check back. We both enjoyed our food and watched what was going on around us as service industry people do. We both commented on how every single other table she had got loads of attention except us. Maybe she looked at us and thought, young, two top or maybe something else. In some way or form we were marked as being not worth while. We finished up and literally stacked our plates and silverware together so she would get the hint that we were finished and in her industry. She grabbed the stuff and came back a few minutes later. We got a dessert to go and our check. We liked the food and will return again in the future but we will never have this server again. I have referred to her as our server because until we got our bill and saw she had no name she told us. Our server's name was Hayley.

You seat yourself for happy hour in certain areas, so we made our way to the top and found 1 open table in the back. The waitress noticed us fairly quickly and took drink orders. After ordering a few appetizers and rolls, we didn't see our waitress for at least 30 minutes. It probably took over 20 minutes for our drinks to come out and over 45 minutes for the food. The least our waitress could have done was check on us, and let us know our food was on the way.

One of our rolls (the voodoo roll) was so disgusting. Normally my friends and I aren't ones to complain and send food back, but this one was unbearable.

We were hesitant on ordering a replacement roll as we knew it would take a long time to come out. We ordered it anyway, and of course it took at least 20-25 minutes to get our 1 roll. 

Then, another 20 to get the check. 

Now that I'm thinking about it, restaurants normally do a ""last call"" when happy hour is coming to an end, and that was not given to us either.

It would be one thing if our waitress was stacked with tables and was apologetic for the wait, but she was so nonchalant, and didn't even smile.

I could not come up with a complaint about any of the menu items I tried, which is about as nice of a compliment as I can give a restaurant. While everything passed the taste test, nothing I ate knocked my socks off and made me want to come back ASAP.

Aside from the food, the staff were friendly, the restaurant looked beautiful and our wine was half off due to happy hour. I was impressed with nearly everything about this restaurant and had a nice time dining here.

So why the 3 star review? Everything seemed to cost $5 more than I would have liked to pay. Yes the food is good, but not THAT good. $10 for 5 above average pot stickers is not something I can see myself paying on a regular basis.

All in all, this restaurant has pretty tasty food and provides a nice environment for a fun night out. If you are dining on a budget, you should probably seek another establishment.",NC7BnFILf671F7-VeZ_q5w,0,0,3,fz_jnWjNYMw14ZaZ9k7PNQ

HH eats menu has several sushi rolls half-off and a list of others priced at $6/each- opted for the BAMA ROLL (crab mix, cream cheese, jalapeño, tuna, avocado, soy paper, spicy motoyaki sauce), which I enjoyed and the VOODOO ROLL (spicy crawfish mix, avocado, habanero tuna mix, smelt roe), which was both falling apart and had unbalanced flavors. 
Would come back with a group to try more of the HH menu, but the sushi options here seem to be hit or miss based on this and vague prior visits- nothing in particular stands out. The macadamia nut chicken is a tasty dish if you're in the mood for a non-seafood entrée.

Interior is a little swanky, seating available at the sushi bar, alcohol bar, or patio, as well as regular indoor seating. Service is friendly and dishes have nice presentation. Not sure I'd return outside of HH times though.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,8,2,3,SWgJT1C7_5hnWfG-4fHNGg

The vibe is totally different and sometimes depressing when dining inside.  Its a little dark and kind of generic in terms of interior design.

The food is pretty solid because they the chef knows that tasty dipping sauce is the key to any tapas-style plate.  Their sauces for all their plates are tasty and flavorful.

My mom had a $15 off coupon to Kona Grill so we decided to go for my first time.  (She is from Michigan and they have one near her home.)  

We got there at 6pm.  Easily downed 3 martinis and some apps.   I've never had sushi (GASP!) so this popped by sushi-cherry.  Yum!

We had a crab surprise, California roll, chicken & shrimp lettuce wraps.

Our waiter, Geoffrey, was fantastic.  He made a Last Call for happy hour drinks.  I have never had that at a bar.  How nice!

We enjoyed it so much, we came back a couple days later for happy hour.  We sat at the bar and had crab surprise and pot stickers.  SO GOOD!

We enjoyed the people and the ambiance.  But I think if they didn't have happy hour, this place would be dead.  The restrooms are located back in the restaurant and there was like no one there both nights we went (Wednesday before Thanksgiving and Friday after Thanksgiving).

I ordered a white wine sangria $6 and it was refreshing and with just the right amount of sweetness. They also have sake bombs with a whole bottle of Kirin and hot sake for $7 that my boyfriend had. 

We ordered: 

Flatbread pizza: it was good. Lots of cheese and pepperoni! 
Calamari: slightly rubbery and tough. But the spicy mayo complimented it well.
Spinach and artichoke dip: literally leafs of spinach and chunks of artichoke. I didn't really that at all. 
Spicy chicken and shrimp lettuce wraps: my favorite!! The chicken and shrimp were very savory and was perfectly spicy when you add that sauce. 

Overall I would come back! My total was only $45 dollars. Can't beat that.",w15NByGsVedQLmpydJ7gPg,2,2,4,yAnA8ijqT2lrnadPZ2f_vw

The sushi rolls are great, the happy hour appetizer list is generous on both food and drink.  We really enjoy the saki sangrias!  Our last visit was a little disappointing with service as we arrived closer to the end of their business day.  As we always do, we made sure to ask if it was okay to sit at the sushi bar since it appeared they were winding down and getting ready to close.  They assured us they were not closing and that we could sit there, however throughout our meal they pretty much closed up show, put all the chairs up around us at the bar and we generally felt rushed.  We won't be returning for meals at the end of their business day again, however earlier in the day visits are definitely worth the trip!",hNjvSiHLX4SoCmR-d-N8ew,1,0,4,tot35G8jQSObbrCzx0BCoQ

Happy hours gets pretty busy, and is only available in the bar and the patio area. Patio area is great when weather outside is nice - but on hot summer nice, it isn't very ideal. So, if you do go during bad weather, be sure to get there when it starts so you can get seats, as there isn't much seating inside. 

Food:
Calamari was decent. There was too much batter and not at all oily. Comes with a spicy sauce which was good, but I still prefer the sauce offered at Olive Garden. 

BBQ Chicken pizza, I wouldn't get again. Sauce was weird and the chicken was dry. They also cut it very oddly... haha. 

Potstickers have good taste but are fried and I prefer mine steamed. 

Tuna wonton crisps are good. Tuna always seems fresh. Comes with a wasbai sauce that I'm not too fond of, but still good.

Of course, it is super crowded at the patio/bar area (the only places where HH is offered), so be prepared to stake out a table for a little while. Once we were seated, our server, Hunter, was awesome! We had a pretty big group, including a few kids, and he was so patient and friendly with us. The food, although a few items took awhile, was really good. The best thing, however, is that the manager continually came to check on us. He said that he'd never seen us before and wanted to make sure we had a great experience- and we did! He so sweetly comped us an extra pepperoni pizza for the kids as well. Wow!

 However, my favorite area is the second floor which has televisions as well but the setting is more intimate and you get to look out over some scenery. Plus the bar is right next to you, so your server is always able to top you off.

We got there a couple minutes before happy hour. My friend ordered a drink but I opted to wait the couple minutes for happy hour to start. When I told the server this, I felt some attitude. I brushed it off and orders my drink once happy hour started. 

We were there for a couple of hours. The server would only come over to the table when we started to look for her. When she would come over to the table and we would ask for more water she would take over ten minutes to bring it to us. Not to mention the sour look she had on her face the entire time. 

I come to Kona often. Most of the time I go it is busy so the service takes longer. The other day when I was there there was a sufficient amount of staff there for all the customers, so I see no excuse for the slow service. I was very disappointed with the service, and felt ignored and unwanted there.

The experience started off not great.  The server took half of the tables appetizer order and just walked off. When he delivered their order, he finally  took the other half of the tables appetizer order...so, half the table was eating  and the other half sat waiting for their food to arrive. 

When it came to our main course items, he delivered the wrong items to several people, noticed  his error and then proceeded to snatch the plates, walk back to the kitchen and turn around, came back to the table and served the correct dinner to the correct people. ..it was really bizarre. 

The food was just ok. The table thought the food was lacking in flavor. My husband had sushi and it tasted ""fishy"" instead of fresh and clean tasting of the sea. To be fair, the server noticed that I didn't eat much of my Phad Thai and offered another selection or a refund as i didn't like it.

We came for happy hour after reading some positive yelp reviews. The sushi, while cheap, was meh. We ordered the special crab crunch roll, regular special crab roll, Atlantic roll, philly roll, spicy ahi roll, and gyoza. All the rolls pretty much looked and tasted the same. They were a bit on the small side and lacked the depth of flavor that I normally expect from sushi. Maybe the ""regular menu"" sushi items are a bit better (someone ordered a nigiri platter and it looked delicious) but as far as happy hour goes I wasn't blown away. Again, though, for about $4 a plate, not terrible. I also ordered the Happy Hour Margarita, which was good and strong. 

Our waiter was prompt and we didn't have to wait long for his attention even though we sat at the sushi bar away from his other tables. For dessert we had the brownie a la mode thing, which sounded CRAZY expensive at $7.50, but the brownie was huuuuuge and decadent and the perfect texture. We split it between the three of us and it was more than enough.

It's not a very high end restaurant like the ones you find on the Strip but it's still a good eat and has a cool, trendy atmosphere. I went with a co-worker we were seated in the main dinning area. You can sit at the bar, near the bar on tall tables with stools or outside on the patio. The lighting was good, not too dark but not bright either. They had some techno/trendy music playing so that was cool. 

We ordered Edamame to start, good and not a lot of salt unlike some restaurants. We ordered some drinks and the bartender made them quickly and they were a little strong (always good haha). We also got the Spicy Aioli (Kona Calamari) which was a little over battered but still tasty to us. I ordered the Pan-Seared Ahi and it was just amazing. If you like sushi or lightly cooked seafood then get this dish! It was sweet because its made with sweet chili sauce; it also comes loaded with white rice (on the bottom) and baby bok choy. My co-worker ordered Miso-Sake Marinated Sea Bass and I thought it tasted great, they did also. Its really rich in buttery flavoring so if you don't really like butter don't order this dish. The Sea Bass just falls apart when you touch it and I actually wished I ordered that after trying it.

 The staff was cool and knew their stuff about the menu so that helped a lot. After some drinks the total bill was about $70 before tip.

At 6$ each your your fill, which is rare considering most happy hours leave you hungry and dissatisfied until you end up paying the price of a regular entree to get full. Kona is the complete opposite though, these 2 appetizers were enough to feed me and 1 other, and I can eat! If you really wanna test your stomach though and pass out, some other hh menu items to consider are their flat breads, and the ahi crisp (my favorite) but the ahi crisps are little bit smaller.

We are regulars that go to KG at least a couple of times per week and it never disappoints. The reason I am taking to Yelp with a two star review is that since TWO weeks the frozen margarita machine is not working. It might sound a bit petty but this is one of our main reasons to come to KG. A frozen margarita with some angry edamame and sashimi is just heaven. We've been there about four times in the last two weeks and even talked to the manager about it. Today I called again and it's still not working. I mean seriously?  How hard can it be? I would offer to go to Target across the street and buy you a blender if that's what it takes. So long story short, we love the place, the food and the people but we just won't go there anymore until the margarita machine works again...sorry!

Even the cabbage under the chicken had a dressing that was really delicious! Oh, forgot to mention the wine list which had more by-the-glass selections than usual and some really delicious selections too. I went out of the box and tried the Bison Burger which was also juicy and delicious. My Server, Alisha, was great too and always available when I needed her. I didn't have to wait too long to see her cause she was always checking in with me. All in all, this is by far the best experience I have had at a restaurant in a very long time.

There are some specialty rolls (Volcano, Bama, & Sunshine Rolls) and entrees (Macadamian Nut Chicken & Miso Sea Bass) that I have really enjoyed at Kona...But far too often the food is flat. 


The service is real nice and friendly, but often staffed for inefficiency rather than customer service.

The thing that gets me the most is that everyone raves about their Happy Hour...but literally none of the food or drinks make me want to come back.  Not a fan of the tacos/HH sushi rolls/mini burgers...the funny thing is there are multiple places in Boca Park that doo all these items better!  The Happy Hour drinks are cheap...and taste like they are cheap!

The restaurant is usually dead apart from the weekends because everyone is out on the patio trying up their pretentiousness status...I would rate Kona with 1 Star if I rating the crowd and atmosphere attracted to their patio.",A5A34ixb-yy6nwL42iZsnw,5,1,3,YtZ7TyBeO48HZPWjr5iCTA

There are other parties sitting at the other tables on the patio and inside is very busy. Understanding that it was busy we didn't say anything when 10 minutes rolled by and not 1 server came to our table with menus, water, nothing. 20 minutes later I had to go ask for a manager. Erika came to our table apologized gave us menus and and took our order. My lemonade came and tasted like water and so did my sisters so I knew it wasn't just me. Now a new sever came over and stated she will be helping us and she heard front the manager we had been waiting for a while and the manager was going to comp a dessert for the wait. 
 Fast forward, my fries were cold, cheeseburger off the happy hour meal was good and hot, husband enjoyed his crab crunch and everyone else was happy with their food. 

The spicy shrimp tempura was not enjoyable and was not what I expected. I was thinking they would be fried deeper with dipping sauce on the side. 

Ok so now the server comes around again and asked if we needed anything else, we say no she says she will get the bill and it took her 10 minutes to come back. 

There was no comp on the meal, no 10% off for our inconvenience, nothing! And what happen to them offering dessert from the manager? I have been to Kona many times and always had an enjoyable experience but I will not be back.",hmB20m99bpvaJjKs7545fA,1,0,1,bss8mI6FW-QDh0xSPhUlOQ

The chicken and broccoli stir fly was gorgeously flavorful, with cilantro and ginger, but the portion size was sadly too small. So was my mom's sushi plate.

The sushi rolls are unamazing, but definitely edible and there are other good noshing options on the menu, such as kalamari, potstickers, etc. The margaritas are stiff, beers are the standard $3-4 on special. 

The real draw of this place is the people watching, especially on a Friday evening when its packed. Kona is the preferred watering hole for the hot cougars of Summerlin, and the men that love them.

All the amazing food aside (seriously all of it is amazing: the sushi rolls, the lettuce wraps, the dessert...), my favorite part of this place is that Happy Hour is all day on Sundays. What better way than wind down (or as I like to say ""wine down""...get it?) the weekend or cure a hangover than with amazing food and alcohol at amazing prices? Rewind to before life got a little blurry yesterday and I remember how amazing the frozen raspberry margarita was. Then fast-forward to after my fourth one - they just kept getting better and better LOL. Before you think that this is what I do on weekends - it was actually an early birthday celebration for my girlfriend :) And Kona is honestly an amazing place to have an amazing time with great people, amazing food, and an overall amazing atmosphere (say ""amazing"" one. more. time). Our waitress was beyond nice and accommodating, there are misters outside since it's so hot, and for those of you who smoke, smoking IS allowed since it's outside seating.

If you've never been make sure to remember that it's first come, first serve so once you arrive feel free to grab a table :) I will obviously be back - this is kind of a tradition for my friends and I - and next time I'll upload photos.

There were five of us and our bill came to $130, so about $25 a person. That may seem a bit high BUT I know that between just my girlfriend and I, we ordered an entree and 10 drinks LOL. So no - it's not bad at all!",zgFpxIm2_I86lhtHOdmjsQ,2,1,5,KhR0puEJU2UOp2JFx3lz8Q

There are almost three distinct parts of this restaurant: a good amount of indoor seating, a bar that extends outside, with a decent amount of seating, and a small outdoor eating area.  Indoors is fairly quiet, the bar is typically noisy at dinner time, and the outdoor dining area falls between the two.

Indoors is somewhat dark and comfortable.  There's ample seating and other than one time, we've always been able to walk in and get a table without a wait.  If you're going for a special day like Mother's Day, it's best to make a reservation.  The bar and dining outside are first come, first served.  Oh, for those transitional weather days when it gets chilly in the evening, there are heaters outside.  During the warmer times of the day, the seating is covered.

The menu is big enough that you'll find something (or a lot of things!) to enjoy.  There's also a fairly robust sushi bar with seating, or you can have any sushi creation brought to your table.  A respectable assortment of sushi rolls are listed on the menu.  There's also a great assortment of salads, soups, chicken, seafood, beef and vegetable dishes prepared the American continental way, or with a Hawaiian or Asian flare.

Go and enjoy, swim through the menu, and see what you like.  And it's located in Boca Park, so you'll have some before or after dinner options for shopping or strolling there or just next door at Tivoli Village.",djb61X-vkg5PF16qM_wI5Q,0,0,3,6NoEqaZceekfD_zdtOYHWw

I came here for a late business lunch on a Friday afternoon.  It was a lovely restaurant.  The crowd had thinned out a little bit and hadn't yet started with the ""happy hour"" crowd, so it was overall a pleasant experience.

The food was fine.  It was tasty and plentiful.  I had shrimp pad Thai, which I always enjoy no matter where I am.  It had a touch of spice to it, but nothing to shy away from.  They were generous with the shrimp - which I REALLY appreciate.  I felt like I was getting good bang for my buck.  

One of my co-workers had the chicken pad Thai, which he enjoyed a lot, the other had the miso sea bass -- which he says is one of his favorite dishes at any restaurant.  

However, at the end of the day, Kona Grill is a chain.  It feels and tastes like a chain.  Everything is very generic.  The food was good, but not great.  It didn't feel daring or creative in any way.  Granted, I had pad Thai; maybe if I'd tried something else, I might have thought different, but a lot of the dishes looked like they'd be too heavy for midday.

For my main entree, i ordered the Lemon- Garlic Shrimp Pasta. My waiters recommendation. It was phenomenal. Very strong garlic flavor however. I don't mind. Garlic is awesome! My wife got the Macadamia nut chicken. I had a couple bites and i was jealous. Amazing flavor!! Shes very picky and didn't have one complaint.

2828062,2014-05-19,14,eduRavkml8awmPachSZXuw,"Happy Hour all day Sunday?! Well, don't mind if I do!!

HH is only valid at the bar and also at the patio. It is pretty spacious. The place was pretty busy and we were still able to find a seat outside. It was a nice, cool day so being outside wasn't torturous. 

Started off with White Sake Sangria ($6.50) which was the best sake infused sangria I have ever had. I've had a few sake sangrias before where the sake overpowered the drink but this one was the perfect blend. Also got a Margarita on the rocks ($4.75).

For foods:
Cheeseburger Sliders ($6)- I thought were pretty tasteful. Got it as medium which was cooked perfect. One thing that was different was they put cucumbers instead of pickles which I loved because I loath pickles! Good amount for the price.

Avocado Egg Rolls-(half off about $5)- I am a avocado lover so this was heaven in my mouth. It came with a honey cilantro dipping sauce. yum!

Shrimp & Chicken Wraps- ($6)- Lots of flavors in your mouth. i really liked it. The portion was just right. The right amount of lettuce and comes with a cucumber salad which was pretty delish.

Philly Roll (half off about $3)- Sushi wasn't too good. The ratio of rice was pretty off. Not enough fish in it. If you want to eat sushi, I suggest to go somewhere else for it.

Service was good. Natalie came by and checked on us at the right times. Food came out in a reasonable time. Our table was a little sticky but other than that I will probably be back again.",pxzs-Dy2hXTis-PuNCV37Q,16,12,4,csMdULr3yXNcOo05p1_Hxg

Their sake bombs are great! Put that along with half price sushi and you get a fantastic happy hour! 

They also have great prices on their appetizers! In terms of price, it is similar to any other happy hour in town, but the environment is what makes this place a must try during the happy hour or reverse happy hour!",eM09Q7l7akt2w-rLOQ19fQ,1,0,4,JTDhWEkJX8wLUhpayYsR9Q

The bar - YES, but the restaurant..not so much.  We ordered the calamari and it was horrible!!! The calamari had no meat! It seemed like they scraped off the bottom of the fryer and served it.  I thought it had to get better, but then we ordered our entree.  We ordered the Hawaiian Ribeye and I don't even think it was ribeye! I think a porterhouse or something, but definitely not a ribeye.  We also ordered a couple rolls of sushi which weren't bad, but my whole dining experience was already ruined.  My mom ordered their asian salad and she said it was too sweet.  The whole experience was horrible.  Our server forgot to give us soy sauce for our sushit and we waited quite a bit to get it. 

Towards the end of the meal I'm thinking I just wasted $100 on garbage!

I'm going to take the survey tomorrow and hopefully it will change something. I really liked Kona Grill and I would like to return, but based on my last visit - I doubt it.

It may just be a hit or miss kind of thing and I hope that others don't have the same dining experience so don't go to this place expecting the worst.  I still have some hope for this establishment.",6S1QxWAT9AHLdNT00iYYiQ,3,1,1,Cm-RMrdQLP2Fb4fd6stqAg

I just wish the hostess could've greeted us with a nicer attitude instead of a nonchalant one. Other than that I was glad she gave us a booth because coincidentally seated in the booth behind is was my bf's college friend. 

Once seated, our waitress who had her blonde hair braided to the side asked us for our drink orders. She was very nice, attentive, and perky. After getting our drinks our waitress gave us a few min then took our dinner orders. I had the truffle lobster mac n cheese and bf had medium steak. 

The food was amazing! My mac n cheese was one of the best I've ever had. Bf loved his meal, and that's a big compliment because he knows a lot about food. However, the pineapple on his steak was a bit sour. Other than that we really enjoyed our meal. 
A few things I really like about the place is their decor. The contemporary interior made for a comfortable dinning experience.The aquarium was nice. The TVs add a nice touch to the place too. The booths are very comfortable. Kudos to the owners :)

A few other things they could improve on is their service. Our server obviously did not know how to open and serve a bottle of wine correctly. I work as a hostess at a restaurant in the strip and their hostess could use a lecture about good service.

For drinks, the moscow Titos mule for $8 is super refreshing or kirin sake bomb.  However, sometimes the food can be inconsistent in sushi food taste and servers service, wish they would be more consistent. Had an off experience with the freshness of their tuna and had to send back because I wasnt comfortable eating fresh tuna that was brownish in color . Tuna that is fresh should be pink to red in color. Our server claimed that ""that's our tuna"" with out offering it to be remade or a substitute to order. He kinda just ignored us the rest of the meal. Its nothing personal,  but he seemed to take it personally and this service deserves 1 star rating. Another instance, I've gone and our server wasn't aware what came in one of their sushi rolls that was apparently new on the menu because it wasnt printed on their normal menu. I have dined at Kona for over to 10 years. 


However. Our food runner was excellent, super professional and promptly brought us more avocado sauce in minutes delivered on a dish and napkin, very 5 star service. Wish their wait staff and sushi chefs would match.",iy_5Xnu9KrXDSF4T5v-7qQ,3,2,4,YINJwpdmtY4bv0ij_Sq4WA

The long bar serves indoor and outdoor seating and seats like 30-40 sitting and 50 or more when packed. Outdoor is awesome so is indoor seating options. 

The sushi bar extends from the kitchen into the main dining area. It's a great spot to hang out at and chat up the Sushi chefs while  impressing your date with your raw fish knowledge. 

The staff are knowledgeable,  local and very friendly. The prices are on the higher side, but it's worth it.

I can't believe that after living in Vegas for so many years I've never tried this place! Just one of those places you always drive by and just never stop! I could kick myself for never trying it until now! Recently the weather here in Vegas has been amazing so I called my girlfriend up to go out and have some drinks but we wanted a spot that had a nice patio and seating to enjoy some sun and good cocktails! When we arrived we were greeted kindly by the hostess that informed us that happy hour is seat yourself so we picked our own table! Once we found the table we wanted we were almost immediately greeted by our friendly waitress! She made some suggestions since I was new which was a plus! I am a margarita on the rocks kind of guy and she suggested after I do that one to do one of the flavored ones! It was just as good! The crunchy roll and flatbreads on the happy hour menu were quite good as well! No complaints and service is amazing!! I will be returning for many more happy hours!,qPVtjjp8sNQ32p9860SR9Q,2,2,4,FaV8zza2kSv_bh0unZabxQ
3167271,2016-08-30,0,eduRavkml8awmPachSZXuw,"I really loved the atmosphere of Kona Grill. We stopped in on a Saturday afternoon while running errands on a surprisingly cool Vegas afternoon. The patio is first come first serve seating which was nice for us because we could pick wherever we wanted to sit. However, that meant that the wait staff were terribly overburdened and not as attentive as I think they may be in the indoor seating. The waiter was amazing and as helpful as he could be with the number of other tables that he had to serve. We ordered the dragon roll on happy hour special and it was one of the better dragon rolls I've had in Vegas so far. But not one of the best ever. 
Additionally, we ordered the burger on special - Mauna Kea Burger - and it was phenomenally cooked. We devoured it in an instant. It comes with crispy thin fries which were very well seasoned but the portion of the fries was a little small. 
I would absolutely recommend Kona Grill. It's close to us so I think this will definitely be one of our happy hour spots on a weeknight when it's cool in the Fall.",3AGb5FfiqvRQQKAZ8ADLXA,0,0,4,M-SIGVIrbXLrhH_XTRqj2Q

Johan had the satay chicken was delightful, juicy char grilled chicken, served on an Asian slaw with teriyaki and satay sauces.
Next I had Kona club with fries which was nice, johan had Cuban sandwich with sweet potato fries, his had been sitting under heat lamp for a while so when delivered was not the hottest or freshest.

Okay but that's accomodating!  Cuz some people do work late and instead of trying to rush over from work at 6pm to make the end of the 7pm happy hour, they can rest a bit, have dinner.  Then come by at 10pm for second happy hour.

What's super cool is for a couple appetizers and two drinks each, we spent a little around $40.  In context, at the clubs along the strip, one drink can cost $20.  Here's a place with a good happy hour menu, times, location, and atmosphere.  The patio seating has mist sprays and comfy furniture if you sit along the outer parameters.  There appears to be a stone firepit too, except a lit fire isn't needed yet.  It's nice sitting outside!

Hey though their lettuce wraps were good.  Spicy and daring, and I liked the kick!  Funny thing is the lettuce wraps were an unintended order.  My bff Elaine was already there waiting for me.  When I talk texted something to her I began with ""let us""...  My text message did not make sense at all to her when she read ""lettuce"", but she didn't question me even if the entire sentence didn't make sense.  She ordered lettuce wraps!  And now ima lettuce wrap fan :D

The menu here features dishes with pacific rim influences and an excellent sushi bar. The food is above average for a chain restaurant and service has always been on point. 

What brings me in to Kona is their happy hour. Every night til closing, KF offers a wide array of sushi rolls, appetizers, flatbreads pizzas, and of course drinks and great prices. The sliders, and BBQ chicken flatbread are my personal favorites.  The sake bombs come with a large bottle of Kirin beer and a bottle of warm sake. Easily 3-4 drinks and a steal at $8. Happy Hour is only available on the massive patio and a few select tables inside by the bar. Though there are heaters, make sure you dress appropriately if you plan on dining on the patio.

If you don't come for HH, then Kona Grill is pretty average.  The food quality isn't the best or most authentic.  But ordering off the HH menu is the way to go.  $8 sake bomb with a 20oz beer and a small sake, or higher class sake for $8 is great for drinks.  Add a few sushi rolls or lettuce wraps and you're good to go.  They have plenty of TVs and nice staff who are happy to serve you.  HH runs 5-7pm and 9-close so it's great for the usual or late night crowd.  I would recommend Kona for a nice HH meal with an eclectic offering that isn't simply sushi but also offers sliders, calamari, and other typical HH meals.

One of them suggested Kona Grill and what a suggestion it was. Although I did get a thorough look through the menu, I didn't have much choice as to what I was going to order as my co-worker kept raving about the Macadamia Crusted Chicken Breast. It was a flavorful delight and so moist and tender no knife was necessary. The mashed potatoes and vegetables were just as good and bursting with flavor. I added a house salad to my meal which was served with an outstanding vinegrette dressing and crumbled bleu cheese. The server was very friendly and attentive. Our drinks were never empty and she kept pretty good tabs on us, making sure that everything was satisfactory. I am definitely going to have to make a return trip to try the sushi. Three of us added salads to our meal which brought the total to just under ninety bucks. That may be a little on the high side for a non-alcoholic lunch, but it was a high class lunch in an elegant setting and worth every penny. It didn't put off a great ""family"" vibe and would not be some place I would expect a family to dine, especially if the kids are younger. Save the money and get the kids a happy meal.

I think the food is great. I think the happy hour menu is fabulous. On a nice fall day where the weather is a perfect 70 degrees all day, the outdoor dining was comfortable.  On this particular day, it wasn't busy.  However, I think the customer service could use a little help. For a day that wasn't busy, the service was slow, even when it appeared there was enough wait staff. Although the wait staff seemed like good and nice people, I think the customer service could use some improvement. I know what it is. It's a restaurant that has a HI restaurant name, that started in AZ but probably not run and owned by anyone that is from HI, but visited HI.

Came here with my Yelp check-in ready to go because you get a free sushi roll or appetizer ( with a purchase of an entree) 
I ordered the Voodoo sushi ( for free with check-in) it was okay. Needed more sauce, I could barely taste it but hey, it was free so I won't complain too much.
For my entree I ordered the  Cajun Salmon pasta. Wow... BLAND!! No seasoning on the pasta what-so-ever. The salmon was pretty good but the pasta was boring. Not worth my money. 
Everyone else in my group ordered the macadamia crusted chicken and they all enjoyed that. 
My boyfriend ordered the fondue as an appetizer which was pretty good!

We came here twice. The first time for their main restaurant which is decent, but you HAVE to try their happy-hour. I know that it's all day happy hour on Sundays too! I normally order the BBQ Chicken pizza ($6), fried calamari, lettuce wrap w/ chicken & shrimp, and a few of the rolls. I know some of their other locations offer the Atlantic roll (salmon roll) & spicy shrimp rolls. Everything is under $8 so you can get a healthy portion of food for cheap. It's best to go in a group so that you can get a real taste of their happy-hour menu. We didn't get any drinks so I can't comment about that menu. Just make sure to sit at the bar or outside seating for happy-hour prices.

A must try: Japaleno Yellowtail Sashimi. This is a little pricier, but if you have never tried any version of this, Kona is a great place to start. They have the perfect ponzu sauce to go with the yellowtail. The jalapenos cuts all of the fishy-taste [which usually isn't present since their sushi is fresh].  I never ate sashimi before until I tried this very dish.

What we ordered: 
Sushi-Crab Crunch Roll, California Roll
Avocado Roll
Bulgogi Tacos
Blue Moon

Well I will say the presentation of the food was nice. The sushi will not be a choice I make again. Very very bland, as if it was picked up from the grocery store across the parking lot and placed on a plate, I'm sorry chefs. The avocado rolls were tasty and actually paired nice the the bulgogi tacos. The tacos were very very sweet that I was thankful of the avocado rolls to balance it out.

3727975,2014-04-07,3,eduRavkml8awmPachSZXuw,"I rated this as ""spendy"" because the things I like tend to be a little pricier but there are plenty of more affordable option.

One of my favorite things is the sashimi combo.  It's about $30.

The best thing on the menu for meat-eaters is the pork chop... not something I would usually order in a restaurant but here... it's a yes.

I love onion rings but they don't love me but if you eat at Kona Grill you are likely to see a large stack of onion rings go by.  I've tasted one and it was yummy.   On the appetizer menu of things I can eat I particularly like the avocado egg rolls.

The bar seems kind of like a pick-up joint but I enjoy the restaurant quite a bit and service is always good and a booth is almost always available.",HK-TlD0yVA_tpTXZxfzu2w,2,3,3,R18iwzsIwRoMndLJbe9Mmw

Bad experience today, went after work to have a drink or two, and an order of sushi, I was looking for a place to have our Christmas party for our salon, with spouses a total of 103 people,
There is no excuse why I had to wait for ONE order of sushi, one, for 35 minutes 
The bartender was apologetic and try to tell a few employees to get my order, some one even came in to check the order receipt, to no success, 3 to 4 orders came after I pit my in, the male  bartender was too busy-giving the three gentlemen next to me free shots and free food to notice, while
The female bartender was trying to gat my order to me, at the end after she took the sushi order off my bill, the order came,
Did not touch it, I tipped the bartender 22% for my two drinks and left, talked to the ""manager"" 
I don't want FREE food after 35 minutes I wand decent service

The food (shrimp and salad, ahi, and one burger) was excellent, and when Super-Fussy sent her food back (twice) it came out without hassle and without being spat on.  Nothing was wrong with it--just she wanted things replaced or warmed up.  It happens when we dine with her.  We consider it part of her charm.  Luckily she tips accordingly.

Luckily, my party was blessed with my presence because I ate at Kona Grill several times before since I used to have a cousin that worked at Kona Grill. I have eaten most of the items from the menu so I was their food expert there. I did recommend the calamari, lettuce wraps, miso sake sea bass, basil pesto linguini, and macadamia nut chicken. 

The future hubby and I ordered the calamari and miso sake sea bass, which used to be my favorite. When we got our order, I was highly disappointed. It wasn't what I remember ever having. The calamari did not taste fresh, the miso-sake sea bass was tough, and the rice tasted old/stale. Fortunately, it seemed that everyone else other than myself and fiancé were happy with their food so I didn't express my dissatisfaction.

The Better Half and I were regulars here for many years but got tired of the same old menu and stopped coming last year.  I met a friend here for lunch this past Friday and was glad to see new menu items.

Since it was Friday, we decided to sit at a table at the bar.  Friday afternoons are happening at Kona Grill, so it was great for people watching.

They have a special ""Pairing Menu"" where you can order any 2 items for $8.50.....what a deal!  The Sandwiches on the menu are 1/2 Sandwiches, so keep that in mind.  I went for the Portobello Mushroom Sandwich and the Avocado Chicken Wrap.  To wash it down I ordered a Stella Artois.

The food came out fast and our waitress was very attentive.  My Wrap & Sandwich didn't come with Fries, which was a good thing....I'm trying to cut back on Fries.  The flavor of the Portobello Mushroom Sandwich was amazing!  Full of flavor....and the Bread was delicious.  The proportion of veggies in the sandwich was good too....no single flavor overwhelmed the Sandwich.  The Wrap was just as good.  The Avocado and Chicken were distributed evenly in the Wrap......I hate it when stuff in a Wrap is bunched together so you only taste a single flavor.  That wasn't the case here.....very good.  As a big eater, I was left wanting more though.....but it was probably good for my diet, ha!

My friend and I put away several beers before we called it a day.  Overall, I was pleased with the food, service, and menu selection.

My fiancé strayed from his norm of Salmon which Kona does expertly and tried the Chopped Salad w/Macadamia Nut Chicken pieces in it. He didn't care for it, but I am sure it was great.

The ambiance at Kona is awesome! Great atmosphere for a date or the family. The decor is very pleasant.

The reason this is not a 5 star review, because I have to tell you we LOVE this place, is because the service, rather our server was awful. She would have bludgeoned us both if looks and attitude could kill. We ordered, she seemed very displeased that we did not want wine, copped an attitude and walked away. Just like that. When she brought the food it was the same. I asked her for two to-go boxes as we were finishing up and she snapped ""I have to box them for you!"" The entire dining experience was uncomfortable due to her downright hostility. I don't know if she hates her job or if she is just having a bad day. I really hope it is the latter which is why I won't post her name. (I like to believe that in the service industry you don't really get to behave that way for very long.)

It was expectedly a little busy downstairs and I hate when the water from the fans totally soak you (I saw this recently in another lady's review of this location too) so we thought we'd try upstairs. MUCH better! It was warmer but there was a lovely breeze from the fans and the water coming from them wasn't as bad. It also wasn't as busy upstairs which was good, although that might have been because the sound wasn't on the TVs for the game. This didn't overly bother us bc we could still see what was going on, but may not be for everyone. The screens were also bigger upstairs so there was a great view of the game from pretty much every seat.
We got a Mai Tai and a Mule from the HH menu and loved them. Quite strong but very tasty. We also ordered some calamari and the avocado rolls. The portion size was great, especially for HH and the calamari was thinly breadcrumbed and generally good with the tastiest sauce to accompany. The avocado rolls were different and also very good. A little greasy if anything, but we enjoyed them.

3877208,2017-01-31,0,eduRavkml8awmPachSZXuw,"Kona Grill is a modern Asian fusion restaurant crossed with the franchise feel of a Cheesecake Factory. The menu is divided between the typical starters, salads, sandwiches, and entrees, and the sushi menu on the flip side. Personally, with the variety of sushi choices in Vegas, I would never order off the sushi menu, but the prices are actually quite reasonable. 

For starters, the smoked gouda fondue is something nice and fun to share. For the entrees, they feature several island-inspired dishes with favorites marked by a triangle. I decided to try the macadamia nut chicken since I'm a fan of crusted chicken dishes. While I enjoyed the chicken itself, I was disappointed by the lack of any macadamia nut flavor. I would say the majority of the crust was made of panko. I did enjoy the accompanying mashed potatoes, broccoli, shoyu cream, and pineapple-papaya marmalade. Although, I do wish the chicken was topped more with the marmalade than the cream. If you're in the mood for seafood, the miso-sak sea bass was really good. The sea bass had big flakes and you get a pretty large portion. 

While the food was on the average side for me, I will say the service was excellent and Kona Grill is a great choice if you're looking to dine with a large group. With the reasonable prices, I may have to come back to check out their happy hour, which apparently is all day on Sundays.

When I bought my house in Summerlin, I drew a triangle between Kona Grill, downtown, and Steiner's, and I had to find a house in that triangle as I was working downtown and enjoyed frequenting Kona Grill and Steiner's.

That was 5 years ago, though.  Unfortunately Steiner's died down, and Kona cut back their hours.  I believe they used to be open until 2am on weeknights, and now they're closed by 11pm.  Kona does have a regular and late night happy hour, and there's plenty to pick from, so thumbs up for that.  Just don't trust their web site for the happy hour times... call first.

Their flat bread pizzas are some of the best the fiance says he has ever had and this is from a guy who hates anything approaching thin crust status on a pizza.  All their sushi rolls are definitely above the usual happy hour par and their sashimi style sushi is actually really good too.  The only thing I've ever had there and not cared for was the calamari.  If you want a fair priced happy hour drink they have some good options including their martinis and cosmos.  I personally love their selection of skinny drinks.

The deals are decent and the drinks are worth the price. You can get a nice Margarita for $4. They changed a few of the recipes which turned out nice. The new pizzas are pretty decent and are more of a thin crust which I personally prefer. Its best to eat on the patio. Even on a hot day they have nice misters and fans that really keep you cool. The only problem is the outside of the patio has little bushes that attract bee's. So if you're sitting next to gates on the outside of the patio, beware. 
I'm not a huge sushi lover so if I do have a hankering for it, I personally prefer to go somewhere that is known for having really good sushi, this place isn't but the other stuff they do have is pretty legit.

When I notified the server, she was not apologetic for the incident; all she said was ""I'll let them know."" Then, left the raw burger at the table. After becoming impatient and waiting for our check longer than we should have, we saw our waiter dancing and doing nothing at the waitress stand opposed to serving her waiting guests. I have never felt compelled to write a Yelp review ever, but this was just unacceptable.",39b2jxcz2ThipcAOycxMBQ,2,0,1,VeFMyM4RDAFku6FpEdgptg

Every time I try a new dish it becomes my new favorite dish.  The sauces are tasty so ask for extra bread to sop it up.  I like the Pan Asian Noodle and the Chicken Pesto Linguini.

4011773,2012-05-03,6,eduRavkml8awmPachSZXuw,"People, back home Kona Grill was at least a weekly stop since it was located inside a mall (Scottsdale Fashion Square).  So I was eager to go back and find some of my favorite menu items.  

Met some friends for Happy Hour then had dinner.  Started with our all time favorite Sake Bombers.  Our friends had never had one so we were obliged to show 'em how its done.  

The buzz kill was the table next to us full of a bunch bored out of their mind people.  They kept staring at us like we were crazy.  Sorry, but no excuses for having fun-especially when I get a night out with friends-which doesn't happen very often. 

Anyway, we ordered up a Crab Special Roll, California Roll and the Avocado Egg Rolls-all my favs-you can't go wrong, that's just how I ""roll"".  We sat indoors and an outdoor patio was available as well.  Happy hour prices are great, appetizers are half off.

Great friendly service and our waitress even recommended a great waiter named Chris and he was awesome too.  

My only disappointment was that they were not serving the Mahi tacos for dinner! Say what?  That's like the only reason I came here-boo-hoo.  They must have changed that because it never use to be the case. Being a total creature of habit, I mourned my tacos and then was forced to try something else.  The pasta with shrimp was fabulous, so I was not disappointed.  

It was quiet in the dining room not too many people on a Wednesday night. The Happy Hour is worth it with all appetizers being half off and the music was solid, I must have said, ""They're playing my song!"" like 10 times.  So I totally enjoyed the vibe and you could still hear the music where we were sitting for dinner.  I'll come back.",uEvusDwoSymbJJ0auR3muQ,6,4,4,HR5UuxNQvIfT6vv_PV8YLg

Too bad because I really enjoyed the lobster mac and cheese which wasn't part of happy hour but how would I know right?  We asked to see the happy hour menu but Chris points some of the items out all over the place on the regular menu and said he'd come back with a happy hour menu but never did. 

Two more pair join us at the bar, we were the first, and they get a server and way better server than us.  We sat at the bar with our shitty spicy tuna roll, and awesome tasting (but not on the happy hour) lobster mac and cheese, while the other party had about 8 plates, tons of drinks, filled water cups.  All I really wanted was to get a couple happy hour cocktail and try more happy hour items.  Water was never refilled and we only saw him twice, three with the check.  The first time was to take the order, second to drop the food, and finally to pay.

He took a couple of our items off the check but who gives a shit about that when good food, or absent food, is ruined by bad service.  I tipped the cost of the discounted items.",k4M43lXJuQMpQW65DTqzIQ,5,2,1,xwiMXoI1uPC9hnRBwI961g
4014482,2013-08-13,1,eduRavkml8awmPachSZXuw,"About a 3 1/2 stars.

Honestly, I've only been to Kona Grill for their Happy Hour.  Yes.  I'm such a cheapie!  I've not been overly interested in their regular menu because I dunno, for ok looking Pacific Rim cuisine it just looks OK to me.  Just seems a tad overpriced.  But I do understand it's Summerlin so the markup needs to be present!

Seems lots of folks like Kona Grill for Happy Hour!  I think it runs M-F from 3 PM to 7 PM, and also most nights from 10 PM to close.  Keep in mind though the weather, Happy Hour is only available at the bar or the outside patio!  If it's too hot or too cold you're in for a not so happy hour.  Also, bar and outside patio seating is on a first come, first serve basis...don't expect a host or hostess to seat you!  Don't wait, find an open table and sit your fat @$$ down!  It can get super busy.

Happy Hour at Kona Grill has a nice menu selection of food and drinks.  It will definitely keep you snackin' and and conversatin'!  Just go with a few friends and you will be kept occupied for a few hours.  Eat and be merry!  Work on your game!  Trust me...some of you 'mackers' need some practice on your form.  Really, ""Come here often?"" is a pickup line?  Oi.  I may not be the best lookin' guy out there but dammit if I'm anything, I'm overconfident (thanks wifey for putting up with me).  Go out there and project you deserve a hot gal on your arm!  Girl with fake boobs and botox lips says ""NO"", just move on!  There's like a dozen of em' at the bar.  Can't score if you don't play the game!  Start shootin'!

Anyway, back to Happy Hour.  There's a lot to try from their menu.  Some of our faves are:

-Sweet & Spicy Shrimp
-Chicken Satay
-Kona Calamari
-Chicken & Shrimp Lettuce Wraps
-Cheeseburger Sliders
-BBQ Chicken Flatbread (kinda like a pizza)
-Crab Crunch Roll
-Atlantic Roll

Of course on Happy Hour, all this food is 1/2 price!  Stock up and feed your friends!  Most things will average to between $4-$6 each item.  Save some money!

The drinks are decent prices during Kona Grill's Happy Hour too.  You can get a Sam Adams for $4, margaritas and cosmos for $5 each, wine selection of the day for $5, or a Bud Light draft for $3.50.  There's a few other specials as well.  Not only can you get fed, but get drunk on the cheap as well!

Reason why my rating might seem a bit low?  Damn, sometimes the quality of the food at Happy Hour isn't the greatest.  It just ends up tasting OK.  Of course for the price you pay you won't get your taste buds knocked off, but I've been to better Happy Hour shindigs.  Hello...Yard House, anyone??  Sometimes the food at Kona Grill can be hit or miss.  Plus, I knocked off a 1/2 star because who the HELL wants to sit out in the patio area when it's like 105 degrees and you're sweating like a baboon?  The fact that the water misters weren't working properly that day ticked me off as well.  Kinda ruins the experience just a little bit.

Service was OK, slow but I can understand somewhat because just about every table in the patio area was full.  And orders were steadily going into the kitchen at a nice rate.  At least our server was nice, and tried their best to keep our water filled since it really was hot outside.  

Will I be back?  Sure, but there are so many other places to get your Happy Hour on at!  Kona Grill won't be the top of my list every time but it is a contender.  I hear right down the way at The Cheesecake Factory they have a Happy Hour of their own as well.  I'm pretty sure so does the Gordon Biersch right next door!  So choices, they are a plenty.",QCtHk02W_Asu2LFfdmGQDA,3,2,3,FvZ0g3iXFaII-zYcgqdttQ

Today we just hit up happy hour.  Lots of half price choices for food: about 7 sushi rolls, AMAZING calamari, tasty potstickers, crispy avocado egg rolls, satays, tacos, sliders, and so on.  Also, 3 pizzas for $6 each.   Drinks include beer, sake bombers, wine, flavored cosmos, and margaritas ranging from $4-$7.50.

Happy hour is always packed here.  Luckily, Kona has a lovely outdoor patio to enjoy their offerings.

Lunch and dinner is also a winner here.  I LOVE the asian salad with macadamia nut chicken.  Chopped napa cabbage, onions, toasted almonds, sesame seeds, and ramen noodles all tossed in a sesame vinaigrette.  Light, crunchy, and refreshing. 

I've been pleased with the pad thai many times, along with the macadamia nut chicken entree served with white cheddar mashed potatoes and topped with a creamy, dreamy shoyu sauce.  Delectable.

It's a nice place, with great food, but it's the local meat market place for singles. Whether you're a guy or girl you're going to get hit on if you're in the bar area, which is a great ego boost if you need one, but I'd really recommend this place for singles or those looking to hook up by midnight.

They renovated the entire place in a chic gray color scheme and added on a second story.  On our most recent trip here the server was extremely friendly and attentive.  If you do eat here be sure to check in on Yelp and get a free appetizer or sushi roll! 

We Ordered:
-Spinach and Artichoke Dip ($11.25 free with the Yelp check-in though!) - I wasn't too impressed with this, the dip itself was a bit on the watery side.  I didn't even take the left overs home which is saying a lot because I always take home left over food if I can!
-Classic Caesar ($5.75 for side size) - This also underwhelmed me too, the salad was underdressed and the dressing itself was a little bland.
-Chicken Chili ($4 add on to entrée) - The best dish from everything we ordered!  The corn bread was tasty and the chili was warm and filling.  I'm surprised with how much they gave us too for it being an add on side soup.  The mini cornbread muffins were delicious too the jalapenos in it gave it a nice kick.
-Pulled Pork Sliders ($12.50) - This dish was good but just your basic pulled pork slider, what surprised me the most were the sweet potato fries usually I don't like them they were pretty good here the sauce that comes with the fries was to die for too. 
-Basil Pesto Linguine ($16.75) - I only had a bite of this but from what I tasted it was okay, a little on the bland side.  The garlic bread that came with it was disappointing too.

They've got a great outside patio, if you get here early enough to get a seat. They have some good food too but they love to over stuff all their sushi with crab coleslaw.

Patio seating is great, and yes even in the Vegas heat! They have a covered patio with misters that actually do what they are suppose to and keep you cool! During busy happy hour times (Friday nights) it does get a little tough to find a seat so I recommend going early to save spots for you and your guests. 

Servers are always nice, especially one I have encountered a few times named Eddie. They usually check on your frequently without being overbearing. 

Now for the food and drink! I shall review happy hour first! 
Sake bombs are a must and a steal at $7 for a large Kirin and large sake.
The margaritas are pretty delicious and strong too! 

Food recommendations:

DEFINITELY my fave : ahi wonton crisps: fresh ahi seared and sliced on crispy wonton crisps drizzled with a wasabe dressing! YUM!
-spicy tuna; cant go wrong with that
-pot stickers come with a very yummy dipping sauce and are pan seared
- barbeque chicken pizza is very generously portioned and can feed about 3 people ; a steal at only $6 
- I would recommend just about everything on the happy hour menu! 

Menu food: macadamia nut crusted chicken is also a favorite, served with a good sized portion of mashed potatoes and steamed veggies. Also the oriental chicken salad with the crispy ramen noodles is accompanied with a great sesame dressing.

Overall- a must go/try for happy hour and regular menu food is pretty good too but I stick to the happy hour :)",it7I9uHsY2gRdFAagxcWiw,1,1,4,u2lEKGjb6UUv4fgHSk_TAQ

After a brutal round of golf @ angel park, this is definitely my ""it"" place to wind down have a drink & a light meal. Service is fantastic, friendly crowd, great food & did I mention Reverse Happy Hour!

Sushi was the craving for the night, so I snapped up the ahi wanton crisp, spicy tuna roll & the crab crunch roll. The ahi was magnificent the horseradish sauce was prominent, not over the top, delectable & delicious, just give me a bag of the wanton crisps which accompanied it & it'll put a smile on my face any day.

Spicy tuna is well spicy tuna, but for some odd reason this edges out possibly the best spicy tuna I've had (sushi para @ chicago), its a remarkably minimal roll, small & explosive in taste (like a grenade of yum!). 

Closing out with the crab crunch roll as recommended by the bartender (quite a friendly-chap). Thank you so much for this recommendation, I can finally stop loathing eel sauce! Spot on, great texture, can I have these as mini-snack bites!

4237403,2014-03-24,4,eduRavkml8awmPachSZXuw,"Great place if you're single and want to meet an unhappy housewife, or Kim Kardashian wantabee, in the bar. But, pick a different place for dinner.

I've actually been going there 10 years, and seen the place steadily decline. 

It's become a lot more of a corporate run, and the quality of the food reflects it. 

Skip the Sushi Bar, there are so many other better places in town for Sushi.

Their lunch menu for Hamburgers and Sandwiches are good. 

Salads are okay, if you don't mind bagged lettuce. Don't ask them to make anything special or different. Corporate doesn't allow that. 

Also, they do serve bread, only upon request, but the quality of the bread is such that you will want to take the loaf home, and use it for football practice.

If you have a favorite server here, don't get too attached. They have a very high turnover. Hostesses are snotty, because all the middle aged married men and all the single guys, who are desparate, hit on them, and give them ""swollen egos"".

Also, you will get exercise going there. Parking is always tough, and the front is reserved for ""leased"" exotic cars that belong to guys that are one paycheck away from bankrupcy, and need the cars to impress the Kardashian wantabees.",QvLg2kxqHHahxxOlHlEIZw,3,2,2,jt_8MZS7OjBz5Gk4MojSUw
4244165,2013-04-24,0,eduRavkml8awmPachSZXuw,"The food was pretty good but the service was another story. I'll start by saying that the soft shell crab po boy and sweet potato fries earned a thumbs up from my Dad. I would also give a thumbs up to the Philadelphia sushi roll. A bit expensive though but it is Boca Park so it's to be expected. The outdoor seating was also wonderful.

Now here is where the 2 stars come from. In all reality I wanted to do 1.5 but it is not an option. The waiter was very disengaged and unhelpful. The girl at the entrance had more personality and made us feel more welcome than the waiter did. The sense I got from him was that he had something better to do or his mind was off somewhere else. We asked about the pork sliders pictured on the menu and his only response was ""they weren't on happy hour."" Ok, that's nice, but are they available now? When he came back with change for the meal he actually leaned over me to put it on the table. Rude. Plenty of room to just walk up to the table and put it down and say ""thank you"" like any other person would do. I also had to ask him to repeat himself as he was quiet and was leaning on the metal fence near our table which put him a few feet away from our table. Not much tact in my opinion.

I've been here a few times before the remodel, but never really liked it much each time. The food wasn't all that great and the service lacked. However, I told my friend I wanted to try it again and sit upstairs since I've never been and my friend has never  been to Kona Grill period. So I was pretty excited to be seated upstairs. 

When I arrived a few minutes late after my friend got us a table, the server checked my ID and got my drink order on the way. The first few seconds of meeting her weren't personable. It was a real quick exchange of can I see your ID and then she walked off. No greet or anything. 

We received our drinks, neither one of us was ready to order, so she gave us a few more minutes. Came back, I was ready to order, but my friend wasn't, so she said ok let me know whenever you're ready as she quickly walked off. Not even taking my order. 

All in all, the new server who took over since the original one was leaving, she did a wonderful job. On top of our drinks and asked if we needed anything every now and then. Very attentive. I did tell our new server what happened and then the manager got involved. I don't mean to get anyone in trouble, but this place has to really step up their service game.

4484623,2010-12-08,0,eduRavkml8awmPachSZXuw,"Once upon a time there was a Princess who moved to Las Vegas (although she still had a part-time kingdom gig in New Jersey, the Garden State).  Along with all the blinding neon lights, she was blown away by a concept unheard of back East - the Reverse Happy Hour.  Soon she was happily scarfing down Ladies' Margaritas, pizza with goat cheese, and tacos unlike anything served in Mexican restaurants - big enough for a meal, accompanied by fried rice with fresh pineapple and shrimp, and for only 4.50 (okay, maybe 5 bucks tops) - at her favorite Happy Hour watering hole, Kona Grill.  Or was it the fabulous southwestern slaw?  The Princess was there so often, and had so many delectable and cheap dishes - and Ladies' Margaritas - that it's hard to remember what came with what.

But that was in the olden days, circa 2007. And a lot of that is gone.  First to go was the goat cheese on the pizza.  Then the garlic shrimp pizza.  The fried rice.  The slaw.  The onion rings to die for.  Gone, all gone.

The Happy Hour remains, though a ghost of its former self.  The margarita is the same, and only 50 cents more.  The 10"" pizza is still good, costs six bucks, but now only as a Pizza Margherita - with tomatoes, cheese and basil, BBQ chicken, or Pepperoni.  Not a bad deal, but not the pizza of blessed memory.

Tonight we managed to eat early enough to get to the first happy hour, before 7 pm.  Most of the patio heaters were working, and I had my Princess Cushion with me, to protect my Royal Behind from the hard, cold metal seat, so we were pretty comfortable.  My husband had a Blue Moon ($4, which I don't think is a great happy hour price any more).  I had the margarita, of course.  We shared the tomato pizza, which had a good amount of cherry tomato halves and shredded fresh basil, and also an order of Romaine Wraps, with chicken and shrimp in a mildly spiced sauce.  That was really tasty.

If I didn't yearn for the Kona Happy Hour of yore, I might have given this a higher rating.  What you get is still very good, and so is the service, which includes a last call for Happy Hour.  But it's hard to forget the glory that was Kona.  Maybe when the economy comes back, the goat cheese will, too.  I can only hope.  And then I will live Happily Ever After.

4573747,2017-04-12,2,eduRavkml8awmPachSZXuw,"Many good things, some things meh. Went for a birthday dinner and was mostly very happy.

The straight up martini (Effen Cucumber) was very good, but had a lot of crushed ice floating; though it was tasty, I wished that the drink was colder, without being diluted. I didn't send it back, and it certainly was fine, but not exactly straight up.

The chicken satay is excellent. I stopped ordering chicken satay anywhere as it seemed to slump into a predictable, formulated chicken brick. The chicken used here for the satay was tasty, real, moist and looked like chicken, too. The peanut sauce and the hoisin sauce are great, and the bed of Russian-dressed slaw is refreshing (and a bit spicy).

The yellowtail sashimi we ordered was fresh, crisp and what I'd hoped for. 

The Lobster Mac and Cheese delivers, if that's your thing. The Macadamia Nut Chicken is another winner - though you need to be OK with deep-fried. 

Despite rumored good burgers here, the burger served to our party was meh. Overcooked (to my eyes), but that didn't stop our guy from diving into it. Yet, at the halfway point, he bailed. The pay-off, though, was he didn't want to bring the rest home.

The grilled halibut special is not very special. Sounds really good, but it was way overcooked and just not happening. Much better is the Sea Bass. Flavorful, moist, lovely. In fairness, our server had definitely steered us toward the Sea Bass while we were ordering. Wanting to mix it up, we ordered one of each. But, happily, our server swapped out the halibut for another Sea Bass.

You may want to ask for a taste of the wines, first. Someone ordered a pretty standard white that turned out not so great. Switched that for the good stuff, and all was right again.

Desserts -- well, the Brownie is outstanding. Served with vanilla ice cream, plus 'vanilla cream sauce' aka whip cream (we opted for no whip), and served over a swath of caramel, it's worth it. Also, we loved the Butter Cake. Served with vanilla ice cream and raspberry sauce.

Service was generally very good. Occasionally we had to look around for some help, but I think our guy was great. The place was pretty empty on a Monday night. We called for a ressie for 6:30pm, and were told they couldn't accommodate us at 6:30pm, but at 6:15pm. Once we got to Kona, we really didn't understand why it mattered given the seemingly sparse crowd.

Really bummed out because we would come here every Sunday just about since they closed for remodeling and we would partake in the great happy hour deals. Sure the new decor is beautiful and contemporary and the choice of music is in good taste. I was so excited to go here since its remodeled new opening and so we went on a Sunday. I knew it was gunna be packed seeing as how its happy hour I made a reservation for 130 pm. 

Upon my arrival the 3 girls in the front looked at me like I had 10 heads when I said I had a reservation. There was almost no where to sit literally the place was nearly at full capacity. Finally found a table, and sat down. It took literally 15 minutes to even have the server come over and get us our water. I remained patient as they were slammed and this was the first Sunday since their reopening. It took another half hour to get 4 avocado rolls at which time I finally got the iced tea I initially ordered with my water. Our server said ""the tea is in the back""

The entire time the server was cold, quite standoff-ish, just not friendly. Hardly seen the server the entire dining experience. Seemed like she had an attitude. No apologies for anything coming out late or her being gone half the time. Ok I get it your busy but come on at least acknowledge your patrons. The food finally came out. The kids meal grilled cheese waa a joke. Fries were overcooked and hard and the sandwich, well lets just say I wish I woulda got a pic of that. I was too busy taking a pic of something else ... 

My lunch sandwich was fine until I nearly choked and cracked my tooth on a bone from the chicken. Talk about feeling absolutely disgusted. When I tell the server about what happens she has the nerve to ask me ""is that a bone??"" I had to bite my tongue with the response I had. Thankfully the manager rushed over and apologized and took it off the bill.

As a kona grill veteran I still dont like how u have to be outside or the bar to get happy hour deals. As full as the place was, everyone should be accommodated with that happy hour deal. 

Even after all this, I would probably give kona grill at least another shot. Just wont be for quite a while. *sigh.",oXTBzujEdIuenvPap7ajFA,2,0,1,tFGUO_6FLoU2FKFZLcVc7g

Half our order came out the other half didn't.  The table behind us that sat down after us and got food got shortly after us. It looked like half our order went to their table. They were talking to each other saying that was not all their order to each other and was wrong. We stated we think part of the order got mixed with ours. They called the waiter back and told him.  We told waiter we think part of that order was ours. He said no and then took the order back to the kitchen. Five minutes or longer he brought the same order back out to us and tried to give it to us. We asked him if that was the food on their table and that he took to the back for 5 to 10 minutes. Hehe said yes. We said we don't want that food that's been passed around to all the tables and took back. He then asked us what we wanted to do. He seemed so out of it like way out there mentally.

4750906,2016-03-26,3,eduRavkml8awmPachSZXuw,"So, I have heard about this place for at least the last ten years. I have driven by it many times. However, it never attracted me to come in even though I love REI. My better half and her girls have been patronizing this place for years and like it. I finally went since friends insisted hey treat me for helping them move some stuff.

I didn't know they remodeled. So, I am not sure what they looked like before. The place looks hip and trendy. Since I am not single and no one in our party was, no one dressed up.  Not that we dress up for most of these eateries in town. It's LV after all and its always casual. Anything special about the decor? Not to me at least. I can easily sit here or sit at Blue Martini, Cheesecake Factory, or Roy's, and not blink an eye. Do t get me wrong, everything looks new and trendy, if you are into that kind of thing. I just wanted a place to sit.

We entered and there were a bunch of hostesses(?) standing around. I am not sure what they were. They were stranding by the podium @ the entrance. I assumed we were told there were no seats available. I was related the message from my friends as I mozied in from behind my group. The girls went looking downstairs for a table and I went upstairs with a friend looking for a table. We went, circled around and found a table in the back. As we were about to call, the girls told is het found a table downstairs too. I always thought that was the hostesses job? As much as I love to hear about their social affairs standing in their booth. I can really care less. It doesn't pay the bills, but  I believe we did. Do you really want to go to a place where you are not really made to feel welcome? But they were busy so I am sure they can care less about a party of 4.

We ordered a crap load of food and drinks and the dinky round bar table could barely contain anything so the server was nice and brought them out as we finished. It would have been more nice if the drinks got refilled as promised. It's so dark outside once he sun goes out. I understand ambiance but you really are just sitting in the dark outside. As the temp cooled, I had to put on my jacket along with everyone else in my group. A gas heater would have provided some light and warmth and served to enhance ha ambiance. It is named after Kona? Do they not ever see Tiki lounges with torches outside? Heck any restaurant outside you go in Hawaii there's something burning at night to give light and ambiance.

So the food. It was ok. Some avocado roll was the best. The pizza thing was ok. More cheese than tomato sauce but that's a personal preference. The sushi tasted good enough for bar food. Yes, to me this is bar food. You know a place you can get tapas and the like. The burger slider was good. Again, it was good but nothing to write home about either. Maybe if it had more flavor it would but overall it was kind of bland. A Five Guys burger has more taste. So overall the food was average. Presentation was great but the taste is just alright. This is where having a great experience would compensate for the food a bit. Don't get me wrong, the food is not bad here. It just could have a little more flavor. The best was the avocado thing out of the five items we ordered. We had a thing with a tortilla chip on the bottom and something on top. I am thinking it was some kind of fish. But, that's how memorable the food was to me.

The server seemed to be trying to get the knack of things but was friendly and cheerful. The bussers worked their butt off. And the hostesses held the podium up.

Oh the scene. I noticed there were quite a few single people sitting and eating by themselves. Kona grills reputation previously as told to me was that it was running with cougars with money and cops. That's probably why I never cared to come. From what I could see as I was walking around to search for a table to sit, there's quite a few available ladies out here ready to mingle.

Will I come back? Yeah maybe in the next 10 years. I am not particularly fond of having to look for my own table when there's people paid to do just that. I will just stick to Downtown Summerlin for local eats. It's within walking distance for me anyway. No need to drive that far to get lousy service. So, unfortunately, as nice as the hard working bussers and waitresses are, those ditzes ( I apologize to ditzes everywhere else) ruin it for the whole staff. I am pretty sure they view customers with biased glasses. But ladies, if you were working at my office, you would've been addressed to shape up or shipped out a long time ago. Then again, maybe Kona Grill pays these professional podium models to keep the place from falling down and pick and choose who they want to feel welcomed at their establishment.",xRpAEg0M0azAPuKVg7WtgA,3,1,2,WNVQKzmLknK_zlGDB_LHqQ

We love and enjoyed the happy hour.  Beer is good and the California Rolls were always ""spot on"".  The experience today left me a bit perplexed.  I debated writing an experience response on Yelp.  I truly feel this website can have positive and negative effect for a business.  For that I am very shy about giving a negative response.  I want to start off first by saying that we still enjoy Kona Grill.  I would recommend everyone to experience it. If nothing else to just people watch.  Great atmosphere and the food is always over the top good.  I am and have been in the food service industry.  I have been for over 20 years.  Usually fine and casual dining.  The reason I mention this is because I am understanding and never complain.  I have walked in the shoes of the food servers.  We all have bad days.  What happened already!  Well here it is.  We were greeted very respectfully and professionally by the host.  They did not have any downstairs outdoor seating.  They gave us directions for their upstairs outdoor section.  I loved it.  We sat at a table and waited for our server.  We waited and waited and waited.  We were seated for 10 minutes without even a hello or a head nod.  I decided to greet the bartender.  She was cordial and helpful.  She directed what appeared to be the only waitress on staff upstairs.  She visited 5 minutes later.  Very short without as much as a smile.  We placed our drink order.  Glass of beer, glass of Chardonnay and an ice tea.  She asked it we wanted sweetener for the tea.  We said yes, Sweet and Low.  We waited and we waited.  Finally the drinks arrive by a different waitress.  So there was more than one.  This waitress took our for our waitress.  Finally our waitress arrived.  Still no sweet and low.  Again very short and not even making eye contact.  What is this about.   I addressed the bartender for the sweet and low along silverware.  She provided them for us and apologized for the poor service from our waitress.  I said that is okay.  I know sometimes we get busy.  Oh let me mention.  They were not fully seated busy.  After the bartender left the manager came to our table.  Nice gentleman.  He apologized.  I explained that was okay.  I know we get busy and I don't want this to reflect negatively on your server.  The food arrived and as usual it was awesome.  After the manager left the table the waitress finally returns again with very little enthusiasm or eye contact.  She never asked to refill our drinks or even ask for desert.  As she came by one last time to clear the plates, I asked for the bill.  I truly felt like a second class citizen with the service.  I am not certain if the server had a bad day or just had a bad table.  That happens.  I don't ask for over the top service, but I do expect service as you would every table.  I truly debated writing a review.  In fact this is the first I have ever done for a restaurant.  I do not want anyone to get in trouble.  I want the same service as the table next to me.  I will still return to the restaurant.  I will still enjoy the best happy hour in town.  I feel this post will help in training and improve service and experience for the customers.  I still highly recommend the Kona Grill.  Great atmosphere.",oIGeRZlK1Xdip19EmwCrXg,0,0,4,bhs4GTnsOo_RNX-tQNw7Nw
4886120,2016-11-06,1,eduRavkml8awmPachSZXuw,I wish I could give this place zero stars. Worst service I've ever had. Order a drink & it took about 20 minutes until we had to reach out to another server to actually get our drinks. Then our waiter try's to flip a cup and cracks it on the ground? Very professional. Not once did he come up to us and ask how we were doing. I think he knew we felt awkward so mid dinner we received a new waitress who didn't come over to us until we waived her down. Very snotty and took about 15 minutes to give us our checks back. I love konas food but their service makes me never want to come back.,w9ntvdYBCWyegd44Ay57YQ,5,1,1,nfbRTRXhxdR9V5UWrdbONg

They have the front of the restaurant open from the bar to the outdoor seating, letting in the hot air.  The food could have been the best food and service ever but sweating during the entire meal just made the experience mediocre.  I had carpooled with a friend so leaving was not an option.  The service was very good; attentive and efficient.  We ordered edamame with the hot spicy sauce on the side.  I ordered chicken satay.  The presentation was very pretty and appealing.  The sauces served with the chicken were spot on; tasting very similar to what I typically get at Thai restaurants.  The chicken was served skewered, but it lacked seasoning I'm accustomed to on satay ordered at local Thai restaurants.  It was good, but not nearly as flavorful as satay I've ordered at Thai restaurants.  It was slightly disappointing as I was expecting curry flavor.  I've been at this location only twice since it has opened as the menu never really excited me.  It features a lot of sushi; I rarely eat sushi and when I do it's only the cooked variety.  The place is a local hang out, typically packed during dinner/happy hour time.  I'll leave it for them, or I'll patron here only if others in my party wish to dine here.

4974501,2009-05-04,0,eduRavkml8awmPachSZXuw,"Getting off early means one thing - HAPPY HOUR!!  And that doesn't happen very often, so I love to take advantage of the cheap eats and atmosphere that happens during these brief few hours.

We arrived around 5 pm and waited a good while to score a table on the patio.  We thought we were in luck when a group of ladies said they were leaving once their friend returned from the restroom.  Well, she must have fell in because it was a good 15 minutes before they did finally leave.  At this point, our total wait time was 45 minutes long.

We were hungry and got our hands on a menu quick!  All food was $5 and under!  With our party of three, we got started on a few items:

* Atlantic Roll ""Baked salmon with motoyaki sauce and cucumbers, topped with tempura flakes and eel sauce"" ($3) - Our waiter said it was his favorite and I'm not usually one for cooked fish in my rolls, but I still said okay.  It was good, not exceptional though.  Came in eight pieces, which is great for sharing!

* Spicy Tuna Roll ""Chopped tuna mixed with spicy motoyaki and cucumbers"" ($3) - Again, pretty basic and decent and 8 pieces too.

* Kona Calamari ""Served with a spicy aioli dipping sauce"" ($4.50) - A pretty generous order, great for sharing.

* Sweet & Spicy Shrimp ""Lightly battered shrimp tossed in a sweet and spicy chili sauce, served on a bed of a daikon"" ($4.50) - Pretty tasty and surprisingly generous in this order.

* Chicken Satay ""With cabbage slaw and sweet hoisin dipping sauce"" ($4.50) - Came with four skewers, and a nice slaw to get your veggies from.  A bit dry on the chicken, but enjoyed by others.

* Avocado Egg Roll ""Sun-dried tomatoes and red onions, with a honey-cilantro dipping sauce"" ($4.50) - Two egg rolls cut in half, and tasty too.

* Kahuna Sliders ""A trio of beef sliders seasoned with onions and thyme, topped with Swiss and cheddar cheese"" ($4.50) - The Husband enjoyed these so much that he requested another order.  They were pretty good, cooked at medium rare as requested and yummy little things.  The meat was pretty moist and the melted cheese on top made them perfect as a few bites.  They also came with thinly sliced fried onions strings.

* Edamame ($3) - Soybeans that were lightly salted throughout the beans, not just on top.

We didn't even get a chance to try any of their pizzas at $5 each since we ordered so much.

Service was surprisingly good during happy hour.  Christian was attentive, even when the other staff brought our food out, he was quick to come over to make sure it was all okay and everything was in order.  He checked on us often for more drinks and food and we never had to look for him during our entire time there.  Once we got our order in, food came out in timely manner and we were quite pleased.  (Sometimes it seems service gets a bit slack during happy hour, when the pace should be more upbeat.  And it was definitely moving around here.)

Happy hours are Mondays through Fridays: 3 to 7 pm
Reverse happy hours are Mondays through Thursdays: 9 pm to 11 pm
Fridays and Saturdays: 10 pm to 12 am

HH is only available in the lounge and patio areas and seats are self-service.  So it can definitely feel like there are hounds on you when you're hanging out there because people are definitely waiting for tables here.

They have discounted drink specials during happy hour too, just be sure to ask.  We took advantage of their $6.50 Sake Bombs and $3 Ladies Margaritas.  (They weren't skimping on the alcohol in my margarita, I could taste and feel that stuff right away!)

You can easily understand why this happy hour is busy.  And there are some guests who stay there all evening long, it makes for interesting people watching!

Both rolls came out....not Tempura. I was annoyed now so the female manager came over and asked me what the problem was and I showed her.

Food is spectacular! I really enjoyed the macadamia shrimp roll the most. The Tuna tower is quite filling as small as it looks. 
I didn't give them 5 stars because I think the food was overpriced by $5.00. The rolls had about 5 to 6 slices which to me by most other sushi spots would be considered a half roll. The pork tenderloin dish had about 6 or 7 slices of  pork tenderloin . A huge helping of mashed potatoes and sprinkle of bak Choy and shoe string potatoes. It was more potatoes than meat still everything on the plate was yummy! I didn't care too much for the sweet and spicy sauce on the yamada roll it overpowered everything else in the roll and it tasted like I was eating a lumpia.

SUMMARY 

I reviewed this locale back in 2011. It was excellent then and has been a fav place for me for happy hour and meals for yrs. I am very happy to report that this place is even BETTER now after its renovation, inside and out, complete with an addition of a bar/lounge on the 2nd fl terrace, accessible by stairs and elevator. The 2nd fl even has its own restroom. 

RATING: 5 Star for its new renovation; excellent food/drink offers, friendly and efficient service!  :-)   Go enjoy! 

DETAILS YOU CAN SKIP

I had been out of town since Jan 2016 and just got back in town over a week ago. Last Sat, I came here for happy hour after a long walk around town and was totally blown away by this newly renovated Kona Grill!  I had a fabulous HH experience, and will surely be back soon for more, yes, for lunch and dinner, too!

Specifically, this completely renovated locale (re-opened in March) has: 

1. An expanded beautiful dining area, patio, bar counter and sushi bar

2. An additional bar/lounge and restroom on the 2nd fl with elevator and stair access. The bar counter has 2 gigantic tv's. Most tables up there have a view. Yes, it has its own restroom. 

ONE MINOR IMPROVEMENT NEEDED

This afternoon, although we could get the router signal, we WERE NOT ABLE TO CONNECT TO THE INTERNET! I was told by fellow customers that the Internet connection that day was sporadic at best.

I didn't have my id which is understandable, so I took the liberty in sitting at a table to order a few food items off of the happy hour menu. My girl friends however, wanted to sit at the bar and have a shot and a martini. We had JUST ARRIVED. The bartender was not only rude, but was also discriminating against my gfs by refusing to serve them shots after he had already served them one round of martinis. They were not intoxicated by any means. We JUST GOT THERE. 

Managers, Janet and Ryan, were summoned and didn't do anything about the situation and instead decided to argue for at least 5 min over reasons we still don't understand. I'm just trying to order some food and my friends were just trying to have a good time but they got denied of their time. Even the group of older gentlemen sitting at the bar agreed that the service we received was uncalled for and discriminating. I have nothing else to say other than...

My server Nicole, on the other hand, was a delight. I had no qualms with her!! Thanks Nicole, for putting my order to-go considering my gfs were denied service.",JA1iXUGIBKeCLE2Vvjis1w,6,4,1,IGmDQF_xfc-QVW1Aadlvjw

5050026,2012-07-29,1,eduRavkml8awmPachSZXuw,"It is happy hour all day Sunday so the BF and I went for it. Keep in mind it is bar or patio first come first serve. Some are half off, some are discounted apps and sushi and drinks ranging from $3ish-7 with most about $6. It was rather busy, but we were able to find a seat and served quickly. 

Normally I'm not a roll person and I know that but went with the flow of what is ""recommended"" in reviews. We grabbed one of the specialty rolls - the Voodoo (crawfish mix, avocado, topped w/habanero tuna mix & chili masago) which we got based on the crawfish.It was decent and I like that it's a bit spicy. We also got a crab crunch roll I believe since I happen to like crunchies on things and that was alright. It's good rolls if you like rolls but nothing outstanding about them. 

Calamari - this was pretty good. I liked the spicy creamy sauce to go with. I would have liked it a tad crispier, but it was not undercooked or anything. 

Avocado rolls - avocado anything I love but the creamy with the crispy egg roll wrapper works for me. This I did like. 

Service was decent considering the fact it was a busy and full bar area. 

I think it was good for happy hour and I would go again since were in Boca Park a lot. I did see flatbreads that looked great and immediately regret not getting one instead of sushi so next time.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,5,2,3,qr_H4W_cG2aa21-i2bTTMw
5053045,2011-08-01,0,eduRavkml8awmPachSZXuw,"We've been to Kona Grill a few times to hit up their Happy Hour special.  It runs from I think 3-7 then again from 10-12 weekdays, Saturdays its during the afternoon (I can't recall the exact times), and Sunday it's all day.  I'd have to say that it gets pretty crowded during the Happy Hour times - especially if you're going during the week after work or something.  There's normally open seating at the sushi bar if you don't mind though.

I like it here.  The food is a great value with their Happy Hour pricing.  They have a list of apps at half off and also some other items for 6 bucks... as well as some drinks for half off.  Their food is quality, ambience is great, service is not bad considering how busy it always is too.

I've tried almost all the sushi on their Happy Hour Menu and to me, it's just OK.  Get the wave roll, it's pretty refreshing (I don't think it's a steal at 6 bucks though).  I also like the Crab Crunch I think it's called.  Other than that, I can't think of anything else that jumps off as awesome.   If you are looking for amazing sushi, go to a Japanese restaurant.

My favorite thing, however, is the two burgers for 6 bucks.  They are smaller sized burgers with a side of fries.  The meat is top quality and its its topped off with a bunch of great tasting things.  I like it and order this every time.

I normally like pot stickers, but I'm not crazy about the ones here (my friends think opposite, they like them).  The meat in it is loose and doesn't stick together.  I think that's why it puts me off.  Anyway, the lettuce wraps are good, the calamari is good... everything is pretty good.  Not OMG, but good!

This is definitely one of the more generous happy hour spots in terms of their specials and times that they offer the great deals.",JHFuMHQBLuQ3TtkWwx1bmQ,0,0,4,yPVxUZVD5vNghIZH0Heuyw

Philly Roll: didn't love it, didn't hate it... nothing to write home about. Disappointing for a place that has an actual sushi bar. Maybe I didn't get the right thing? I'm not too adventurous with sushi.

Potstickers: Yes.. yes... and yes. Not sure what it was about these but I probably could have ordered 3 or 4 more plates. When I go back it will mostly be because I want potstickers. Nice size, tasty, nice crunch on bottom and soft on top. Nice presentation. Loved everything about these.

Chicken Satay: Very tasty... the peanut sauce was delicious.

Sat at the bar... nice spot and perfect day today with a bit of a breeze. All in all with couple drinks our bill was only $27 for lunch. Awesome... I'll take that any day.",sL9dYZyNLpzLD3cfTWwyOQ,1,0,4,f-7zI-ufnJN83-lX4vO6bA

2 other people in our party ordered Burgers, which were supposed to be Medium.  They were so rare, the cow was still mooing. 

Another person in our party, had his entree' mistakenly given away to another party.

5199300,2010-04-18,7,eduRavkml8awmPachSZXuw,"Places with enjoyable outdoor seating generally get a 1-star patio bump, and Kona Grill has some nice real estate for dining al fresco. Yes, as with most Las Vegas patios, it overlooks a parking lot, but there is a bit of greenery to shield your eyes. Plus, there is generally some nice auto eye candy in the parking lot. 

My first Kona experience was at lunchtime with the parents. Beware of the iced tea. We were all on a flavored tea kick after sipping on some fruity treats at Create and Sammy's, so we swiftly ordered up some of the enticing flavors at Kona. Little did we know that their flavors were delivered in a four-dollar Republic of Tea bottle! We searched the menu and found no indication that this was the deal, or rather un-deal.  $4 and no refills? I suggest sticking to the regular brewed tea. 

We all went with the perfect pairings lunch offerings. You pick two from a nice list of options for $8 and change. I chose a salad and the turkey chili. My husband went with some sushi. The salad was okay, but I wasn't a big fan of the over miso'd dressing. I love miso, but it was really overpowering. The turkey chili, however, was yummy. My only complaint is that I wanted more! The sushi looked a little sad. The imitation crab was leaking pink onto the plate. Never a good sign, but my husband seemed happy enough.

I wouldn't say Kona was a knockout experience for us, but there is that patio bump in effect, and the happy hour specials definitely demand a repeat visit.",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,12,10,3,lfmzRlZkHoHCOTjo4BF1LA

We found a large table in the newly renovated upstairs part of the bar in the back. The downside there was no fan or misters in this part of the bar.  An oversight that hopefully they will figure out once some one passes out from heat stroke. First day it hit one hundred degrees this year and we were miserable.  We would have moved but there were no tables left to fit our large party. Than there is a middle section upstairs that faces south and closest to Lee's liquor that has an open section in the patio cover.  Those tables had the sun beating down on them.  At least they had some fans and misters. But still looked uncomfortable. If your sitting anywhere near the railing the sun hits you there too. Since the reopening the happy hour menu is more extensive with the food and everything we ordered was good. The drink menu not so desirable. The food came quick but if you ask for extra plates or condiments it takes forever because they have to go downstairs to get it. Our server was hit and miss. Forgot drinks, didn't keep water glasses full (after all we were sitting in the hot corner).  We had lots of plates sitting around after we finished. Forgot to bring drinks. However he was always pleasant. Brought wrong food and forgot to deduct from bill. If there were 1/2 stars I'd give 3 1/2 stars.

5227978,2015-06-30,1,eduRavkml8awmPachSZXuw,"Every month, a few Yelpers get together to meet up for a book club, and we try to go to different places each month, so that we can explore all the awesome food and coffee options available in the lovely Las Vegas area.

This past Sunday, we met at Kona Grill, per Stefany V's suggestion, for their all day happy hour!

Kona Grill is located in the Boca Park shopping center, directly across from (are you ready?) a Hipster Emporium.  Location aside, I was pretty impressed.

Happy Hour is ONLY available in the bar areas (sushi bar included) and the patio, not in the regular restaurant.  This was unfortunate, because it was HOT on Sunday.  We sat in the bar, which has AC, but its right next to the open patio area, so it doesn't really stay super cool. 

Service was polite and friendly, from the hostesses, to the waiter who told me about the restriction on the HH seating, to our server.  

Food was ok!  HH has a decent selection of sushi rolls, appetizers, and flatbreads, along with a few drink offerings, some for $6, some for half off.  

I had a Bloody Mary (not on the HH menu, but only $7.50, and a pretty decent size), 

From the HH menu, I ordered the crab crunch roll: crab mix, motoyaki sauce, cucumber, tempura flakes, eel sauce.  This was half off for HH, so it was basically $3.75 for a really good sized roll.  

I enjoyed this a lot.  I'm not a roll kind of girl...when I do sushi, I do nigiri, and I do AYCE.  Since this wasn't an option here, and the happy hour menu is limited, I picked the one that definitely didn't have avocado (allergy) that sounded good, and I really liked it.  As far as rolls go, I would definitely come back for this roll, and a few of them at that!

Potstickers: seared chicken & vegetable dumplings, asian slaw, traditional soy
dipping sauce.  These were ""meh.""  Too much dough, and it was very chewy.  The insides were a little bland.  I'd probably go with a flatbread next time instead.  

The regular menu is a little pricey for me, especially with how much sushi I usually eat, so I don't know that I'll come here outside of HH, but I will definitely come back to try some more of the HH specials.",renPzRDqMZpMaHiCD_e1_A,7,3,3,8BlOFCTFtTtOaJPnmh5IWw

The atmosphere is upscale but very nice, not intimidating. The diningroom itself is quite large with plenty of tables.

My meal started with a wonderful drink called a hibuscus margarita. I could see where these might be 'dangerous', as you do not taste the alcohol at all, tastes more like a fruit drink. It includes an edible hibiscus flower which I definitely recommend eating! The flower was infused with the same fruity flavor and tasted sort of like a spiced peach.

One thing I adore is when a waiter gives honest opinions about different choices on the menu. Our waiter did this, recommending some things, steering us away from a couple of others.

I ordered sashimi, and the fish was extremely fresh! The prices were alsy very reasonable. I would not hesitate at all coming back here.",dpxRA20vDQOAospE_1R6hg,3,2,4,R9PDQxKY4-NdU_RgzU80bw

Upon arriving we are told there is a 40 minute wait, however open seating at the sushi bar and full menu available. Apparently the sushi bar is the new Starbucks as a gentleman was taking up 2 spots, one for his food and other for his laptop. But we were able to get a seat. Matthew ended up being our server, and wow he must not have been enjoying his day. First thing he told us was that happy hour is ending and we only have a few minutes if any to get our orders in. Wow thanks man, we just sat down. The hilarious part is my previous review talked about being ignored by the server, this time my mother was ignored. He took my drink order but didn't ask my mom if she wanted anything. He returned and asked her finally if she wanted anything. He took our order for an app and 2 entrées. Apparently he also doesn't know seat numbers at the sushi bar as both runners for our app and entrées asked different parties at the bar if it was their order. The runner asked everyone at the sushi bar if the potstickers were theirs, and the runner for the entrées asked the couple next to us. How hard it it to deliver food to numbers seats? 

The only sign of hope this dam restaurant has is Oscar (I think that is his name) at the sushi bar. Though we never ordered anything with him nor did we get sushi he kept checking in on us asking if everything was good. Having conversations with us, ect. Very nice guy and should replace the servers I have had the unfortunate dealings with. I even told him his service is friendlier and better than our servers.

5304252,2007-02-16,1,eduRavkml8awmPachSZXuw,"I can't believe I'm the first person to review Kona Grill! For those who don't know, this is an upper-scale chain restaurant with many locations across the US. However, I'll stay specific to the one in Las Vegas. Actually, this one is in Summerlin, which is in suburban Vegas about 15 miles west of The Strip. 

The restaurant is more famous with the locals for it's bar and patio than it is for its actual dining experience and food. While it sits in a shopping center, it still manages to have a cool vibe. Also, exactly what in Las Vegas isn't in a shopping center?

The bar is open to both the bar and the patio on most nights and the patio that goes around the outside of the place is great for hanging out with friends and having some drinks. The drink selection is not fantastic, but is pretty average. 

As for the food, everything I've had has been two things: delicious and uninventive. For a place that tries to have an asian fusion menu, I feel like I've either heard of or previously had everything on the menu. Which is fine, because its all very good. 

The main steal here is if you come for ""Reverse Happy Hour"". This is a late-night happy hour in the bar area only where they have a ton of great pizza, sushi, and other appetizers for very, very cheap. For example, you can get a personal garlic shrimp pizza for $3.95. This is awesome as you sit outside on warm summer nights.

Monday - Thursday 10 p.m. to 12 a.m.

The patio definitely has a better vibe, but each time we see the weird waiter. When I said weird, I mean the guy has black died long hair in a samurai ponytail and a full face of make up. We have found rice in the the ""clean"" forks (which the weird waiter blew off like it was normal) and the drinks have been extremely average; however, the food bites for happy hour are tasty and cheap, and the patio offers a fun get together experience for friends. The only downside to the patio...it is a very tight fit between tables...a bit uncomfortable for someone who likes their space.",0y0MLiSBzjl7s58ittq8iA,1,1,3,OHoI169v1GCVYJWreIQzfQ

They recently remodeled which turned out very nice. The dining room and bar downstairs is much better than it used to be. For the remodel they added an upstairs rooftop bar with a dining area which is really cool. The food is always consistent and pretty good. I have definitely killed many hours at Kona relaxing with friends. It's not what it used to be like 10 years ago but it's still fun. Try them out.,tUJJr2fvXDLbo34i3UGAvg,0,0,3,rVLAmELAtxMAcm8XNJ77BA

Food (4): Order the sea bass, wow! It is so sumptuous and every bite the fish practically like melts in your mouth. Highly recommended.  Their desserts are pretty big, I was surprised that their portions were as big as they were.  We ordered the butter cake and the ultimate fudge brownie. I am a huge chocolate lover and I actually enjoyed the butter cake more.  I felt that the brownie wasn't moist enough and kind of dry.  

Service (4):  Great hostess and waitress.  

Atmosphere (3.5): I feel like I am blind in there sometimes because I have a hard time reading the menu. However, the place is very simple and neat. They do have a bar and an outdoor seating area",oDyEexUT09e3XhxIp0-Wxg,1,1,4,6lvTS019QdPvV81RlCZhFA

Luckily for me, I have Robyn and Kevin L. to show me around this foreign land. Summerlin might not be as exotic or far as I make it out to be, but I definitely need a reason to head over there. 

On many occasions I was told about a happy hour that is worth checking out. It goes Monday-Friday from 4-7 and there is a reverse happy hour as well. Sit out on the patio, at the bar, or at the sushi bar and one will be guaranteed discount prices. 

The drinks list is small, but the sake bomber is worth the $7.5. It is a full bottle of beer and a container of sake. One of my friends got that and I regretted getting a margarita. 

The food is good, but what makes it better is the prices. Most of the basic rolls that run between $6-7 are half price. The same goes for select appetizers. The calamari are tender and delicious. Lettuce wraps are another bountiful choice that will surely please the taste buds. The specialty rolls are worth looking at for $6. 

With the HH checked off my list. I must come back for their regular menu. Apparently anything with soyu cream is a must have and I must get some.",N3oNEwh0qgPqPP3Em6wJXw,1,2,4,-TBPn9BzUUeQXykWU8Ycpw

The best dishes we ordered were the BBQ Chicken Pizza and the Chicken Satays.  Loved the spicy peanut sauce that came with the satays.  The pizza is so filling!!  I'm gonna say pass on the sushi.  While it's really cheap @ $3/roll, it's not so fresh.  We tried an Atlantic Roll to which we both said ""Meh!""  The spicy shrimp was pretty good, however their calamari wasn't so much. 

They offer a house Chardonnay & Cab @ $6/glass during HH.  The Chard was not bad for cheap HH wine.  They also have a Sake @ $6/bottle.

We weren't able to take advantage of the happy hour because we couldn't sit in the bar area because of my son (obviously). Kinda of a pity they don't offer happy hour for table service like they do at Yard House but I digress. 
The calamari app was not my fav and I wouldn't order it again. The batter was light but just not very crispy and the dipping sauce was so thick and spicy it totally overpowered the calamari. My California roll was one step up from Costco quality. The rice was overly sticky and the avocado and cucumber were practically non existent. 
The only 5 star worthy item was the kids meal. Seriously, for like $6.50 it was a ton of food and the options were fantastic. There was everything from shrimp tempura to grilled salmon to  chicken fingers. You also can select two side items and it comes with an orange cut up to look like a bear! So freaking cute. It's served in a bento box and my little guy was over the moon with excitement when he saw it.

Things we tried:
- California roll
- Spicy tuna roll
- Fiery shrimp roll
- Crab special roll
- Kona calamari

Everything was delectable. The California and spicy tuna rolls were better than they are at other places. The fiery shrimp roll had quite a kick. And, the Kona calamari has notable sauce. I especially enjoyed their mango margarita. Another thing to note: the above was a lot for two people, and we ended up taking a good portion of it to-go.

We originally had a reservation for 10 at 3 PM on Mother's Day in the dining room. When we arrived they were still setting up our table. The very courteous hostess then informed us that there was room available for our party on the patio. I then remembered about the all day happy hour and we accepted the offer to sit outside. The weather was perfect that day which provided a great atmosphere for our meal.

Happy hour gave us the chance to order and sample many items. For drinks, I had a bottle of cold sake for $6.75 and my wife had the sparkling sangria for $6.50. For food, they have select items for $6 and other rolls and flatbreads for half off. We ordered pretty much the entire HH menu except for a flatbread. Everything was quite tasty and no plate was left with food on it. The shrimp tacos were a hit and I enjoyed the Voodoo Roll which has spicy crawfish, tuna, and habanero sauce.

Mychael was our server and he did a fine job despite being very busy with multiple tables aside from our 10 top. One thing to be aware of is that the bar and patio areas are first come first serve so there will be vultures hovering around, especially when you are coming close to finishing because they want your table.

So before you make comments about that statement, yes i did something for her that was kind of for me also. Anyways I headed over to opentable.com and aha they had reservations and they offer flowers to the table.... Nice touch. 

We arrived at Kona and the place was packed.. We checked in and the hostess let me know it would be just a few minutes for our table and that was it. 2 minutes Later we were on our way to the table. The waiter was quick and brought us waters and greeted us with a happy mothers day shout out to Becky. Nice touch #2 

We ordered our daughters food when we ordered our Calamari appetizer and they came out at the same time... This is perfect and exactly why we do that. The waiter then took our orders and let us know that for moms there was a drink special... $2 bubblers
 "" Champagne Cocktails""  so it was taken advantage of. We ordered the macadamia nut crusted chicken and the macadamia nut crusted chicken tacos. Both meals were nothing less than amazing. Mr. Waiter also asked right off the bat if we would like any extra sauces... Nice touch #3

As we were finishing up the delectable meal he came back and said, "" by the way, you have a red velvet cupcake coming as well for free for mothers day""  Nice touch #4. This thing was amazing, first off she loves red velvet cake and I love cream cheese frosting, so they pleased 2 eaters with one cupcake.

We ordered the ahi steak sandwich and the bbq chicken flat bread, both came out promptly and delicious! I'd definitely give that night 5stars.

We then saw a flyer for all day happy hour and football, so we went again today. It was a different vibe and service was not a attentive as the first time we were here. I don't think this place should even offer a happy hour with football, if 1. You can't hear any of the games, 2. There aren't enough tv's to enjoy all the games that Sunday has to offer. Also if you're encouraging football fans to come in, watch the games and have a good time, don't give them dirty looks when cheering on their teams.

The happy hour menu is decently priced with a couple good options. The avocado egg rolls are a must! And make sure that the dipping sauce is on the plate when you get it, cause when you ask for it the server said ""oh it wasn't on there?"" With a little attitude, if it was you think I'd ask for it? I used to be a server and before you bring any dish to a table you always make sure everything is on there correctly, especially if it's a normal dish that gets ordered multiple times a day. Also isn't it customary to offer waters to those who aren't having a drink? 

Aside from the eggrolls, we ordered the calamari, bulgogi tacos and crab crunch roll. They were nothing special, I'd probably never order any of those again except the egg rolls.

For the experienced we got today, it averages out to be 3 stars for both visits.

The pizzas, and flat breads are a pretty safe bet.  They've always been well made.  The other appetizers are good too.
The flavored cosmos are too sweet for me, and the margaritas aren't as good as they used to be.  There's always beer when all else fails.

Since the happy hour is at the bar, and on the patio only, parking, and finding a table can be difficult.  I usually avoid going there for happy hour when the weather is nice, because that means it will be nearly impossible to get a table.",vKbRbgAEYDCdl-xjPIWLfQ,3,0,3,HRO6Jz639QoKcXJ31FwZSQ

We arrived to the restaurant and found out that it is open seating during HH - you can sit pretty much anywhere except in the dining room. 

Service was really great, considering the fact that it was super busy! Our server was really accommodating and super helpful when it came to ordering. 

For food, my friends ended up getting the sliders, margherita flatbread, and California roll from the HH menu which they really liked! The sliders are huge! It was like two regular size burgers and it was big enough for my sister to take home leftovers.

Keep in mind that if you're vegan and order from the HH menu, there's literally only one roll you can get which is the vegetarian roll. I ended up getting this but wasn't really satisfied at the end of the meal - the roll was bland to me and literally just tasted like a couple bits of veggies smushed together with rice and nothing memorable about it. I had to really dip it in soy sauce to get a decent flavor out of it.

5581287,2018-02-06,0,eduRavkml8awmPachSZXuw,"So it's been 3 years since my last review, so I thought I'd update it! Well, the renovation that they did to Kona Grill is nice! However it seems since the renovation also out went their customer service. The last 2x I've been here I've been pretty disappointed with the lack of attentiveness and really the sense of urgency. 

Most recent, we were sat outside and it was just a little chilly and there was a dirty table that we asked if we could sit at. Our waitress Taylor seated us and told us that she would have someone clean it right away, some minutes later another waiter sat other guests at the table and cleaned it right away for them... Fine. So then I decided to order some sushi and my boyfriend ordered a burger. I then asked for sake with my dinner. My entrees came out well before his burger and I ended up finishing my dinner before my sake and his burger arrived. The Sushi roll was just ok. Our waitress hadn't checked on us for some time so I headed to the bathroom and caught my waitress midway and told her to cancel the sake order. She made an excuse saying the first sake wasn't made hot enough. But I'm pretty sure she let it sit on the bar counter so it got cold. For the rest of the evening she just checked on us 1 or 2x more. She apologized for the sake and we got our check and paid the bill before she could leave again, not wanting to wait on her.  

Anyway, it was just a very poor encounter and I used to really enjoy Kona Grill, next time I'll just take my boyfriend's first suggestion and go to In N Out instead. Better service and 70% cheaper.",F84ATLjgbPRlg3rq2y3kdQ,0,0,2,ZRvljexXackzyOGH8zCSkA

This place has always reminded me of a meat market where those who want to be seen are present and looking to get lucky.....snicker, snicker!

As I walked in, I really like what they have done. The floor is open and no longer dark. I love the lighting and the decor. The main bar and the sushi bar are separate and both bars are set up in squares.

Our booth was nice except is was right next to the cashiers area. Still no noise or interruption from the servers though. Our server was very nice and delivered great service to our table all night long. I wish I could remember his name as I would love to give him a shout out. I briefly mentioned to him that is was my friends birthday and he surprised her with a lovely dessert! He was the best! 

I ordered the Macadamia Crusted chicken with a creamy Shoyu sauce, broccoli and for dipping a mango/pineapple sauce. It was ok but nothing I was over the moon about. The chicken was flavorful but the dish came semi-warm. I like my food served hot. The best part about the meal was the free appetizer/sushi roll that you receive upon check in. At first, they tried to tell me that the check in was only for a free appetizer so I pointed out in black and white that it also listed sushi roll. They were happy to accommodate us. We also enjoyed a pitcher of their red sangria/sake. This drink was really refreshing on such a hot evening.

Honestly though,used to be a bigger fan before the remodel and prices went up. Still a great place, but just not the same. I used to love the contrast of the outside patio with the darker intimate inside. Now just looks a bit more like a typical restaurant/ sports bar. 

Although the price increases aren't drastic, the difference between $5 and $7.75 does add up. 

But anyway... Their food is good and the vibe is great. Calamari has always been a fave, avocado eggrolls, sushi... It's all good.

voodoo roll spicy crawfish mix, avocado, habanero tuna mix, smelt roe and picasso roll spicy yellowtail mix, avocado, yellowtail, jalapeño cilantro relish, togarashi, sriracha, yuzu ponzu.

I will start out by complimenting the frozen margaritas which always deliver in taste and alcohol content for their very fair happy hour pricing of $5 dollars. I ordered the avocado egg rolls which are one of my favorite appetizers on their menu. The egg rolls wee not crispy as usual and the avocado tasted a bit on the stale side. The calamari was another fail as it was way ok salty and I was surprised at the fact that it came out of the kitchen within less than five minutes. Makes me wonder if I got a calamari order that was cancelled and sag on their kitchen until I ordered it. Also our waitress was not very friendly. I understand that servers are very overwhelmed during happy hour settings however the place was not busy to where she could have taken sometime to get to know us and be a bit more friendly. I am just going on previous experiences and how awesome their servers tend to be. I also ordered their flatbread pepperoni pizza which to me was very reminiscent of a ""lunchables"" pizza lunch.

I went here with my friend who when we were dating loved the macadamia nut chicken, so we dropped in Saturday night around 730pm. They must have had a huge kids party because the place was packed with kids and parents, and had a buffet style set up in the middle of the room. It was ending, so the noise level went from loud to quiet in about 20 minutes.

Ordered the mac nut chicken, with extra shoyu cream sauce. The chicken came out with very little sauce on it, and a minuscule amount of mango sauce. Lots of garlic chunks in the garlic mashed that really overwhelmed the potatoes. The veggies tasted a little burnt. The chicken was not as moist as before.

With respect to their drink specials, they have a nice variety of different spirits with moderate pricing. They have sake bomb kits which consist of the traditional small bottle of warm sake and a large bottle of Kirin or Kirin light. I take issue with them only offering Kirin as the complementing beer for the sake, but beggars can't be choosers. If you're on the southwest side of town, I recommend 808 sushi for sake bombs. ($6 for Whatever beer you prefer and the warm sake, whereas here it is $7.50 with only Kirin). Their sake sangria is tasty and refreshing. Their margarita is a margarita. (Tautological) 

I like their food specials. I recommend either the flatbread or the chicken/shrimp lettuce wraps. Most of these food specials can certainly be shared. 

The ambience is nice and if it isn't too hot, the patio is a nice place to relax. Overall I think one can enjoy their experience here either after a long day after work or as a fancy way of pre-gaming. Disfrute!",uY9Q_Vw7YAJtJQA0FQJR7g,0,0,4,Rc7DzcUyvQMMO0xSiM6Dpw

5792546,2010-12-07,0,eduRavkml8awmPachSZXuw,"Yuck!!!  What kind of generic ass Japanese restaurant is this??!!  I think it's supposed to be some type of asian fusion??  The feel of Kona is very commercialized and seemed like it fell into the category of being 'just another chain restaurant.'  

My BF and I were in the beautiful Boca Park area doing some shopping and was getting hungry for dinner.  Being that we're always trying to find new joints to eat at, I saw this place, looked it up on yelp, saw that there were awesome reviews, and suggested we try it.  From what I remember, it is a rather large restaurant with a lot of seating.  I was overwhelmed by the amount of food they offered.  The layout of the menu really reminded me of like an Elephant Bar or Cheesecake factory.  They had a bunch of random ass dishes that consisted of things such as: pizzas, flatbreads, egg-rolls, pot-stickers, salads, noodles, sushi.  Well, we passed on the dinner menu and leaned towards sushi since thats what I thought this place was.  

Their sushi menu is a big fat joke.  My BF started off with a $6 seaweed salad that was served on a big ass plate.  I kid you not, the amount of seaweed they put on there was the size of a fucking tablespoon.  I may be exaggerating a bit but I was damn disappointed with the quantity placed before us.  I really felt like they straight took $6 out of my pocket.  Robbed!!! Don't bother with this dish.  We also ordered some salmon sashimi pieces ($9.50), sushi rolls/hand rolls, and one of their chef's plate: a yellowtail jalapeno sashimi with ponzu and cilantro ($11.00).  What a disgrace to Japanese food.  This shit tasted horrible.  I cannot believe the quality of fish they used.  It was cut funny and left a horrible aftertaste.  I didn't bother eating any of the sashimi dishes after the first bite.  I also ordered a side of rice and had to return it twice.  How do you mess up rice??  The first bowl he brought out was hard and dry as hell.  Eww!!  I can't believe they served that, it was not even edible.  You can tell it's been sitting in the cooker for a while.  He brought out another bowl and it was the exact same thing so I passed on it.  To make things worse our server was rude.  He didn't do much and I had to wave him down to keep him updated on the status of our dining experience (ie. rice, drinks, blah).  For the most part he just took our order, brought us our bill, we paid, then bounced.

Sangria tastes like koolaid. I'm sure it's the mixer they use, but way too fruity and really skimpy on the cheap wine. Which I'm convinced is boxed wine and not from a bottle. It's just like bad juice. 

The sushi never seems to be on point, always a let down. Asked for the spiciest roll they made and wound up with a sriracha overkill rice roll with some canned jalapeños on top. Yuck. My friend finished it, but I sure wasn't going to eat another bite. The salmon roll was just ok. 

Also, weekends in the bar area are brutal. It gets packed with corvette driving mid life crisis men and pretentious wannabe Real Housewives types and I've found the service takes a dive as well.

The only thing that I remember disliking were the sliders during happy hour... they were just bland, flavorless and undercooked for what I specified.  I generally get pretty bad service here, though, and that's where the 2 star rating comes from.  There's always something that happens that makes me say wtf?  One time I had to say excuse me multiple times to a group of servers blocking the entry way between the patio and the inside when I was trying to go to the bathroom.  They were just in their own world, chit chatting and being oblivious.  Another time, our waiter was mostly AWOL from our table and we repeatedly had to flag down other servers to ask where ours was.   It wasn't particularly busy, so no clue what the deal was.  Another time we were seated outside and it was cold... we requested that they turn on the heat lamps but were told it wasn't in their budget to have them on during that time of year.  Another time there was this obviously intoxicated man floating around from table to table in the patio area trying to chat up female customers.  When he went to the bar, the bartender high fived him and served him another shot.  I just feel like they could do a lot more here to improve the customer experience and act like they give a shit.  The food is good and it's wasted on an establishment with subpar, unprofessional staff.",sD_uLJBHHozK-poMkY2l7w,1,1,2,Pq9hGG8Xjhhyu5Twow_Ong

5831884,2014-05-19,1,eduRavkml8awmPachSZXuw,"Went there late Saturday afternoon before the dinner crowd rush and wasn't entirely blown away by the experience. 

We sat outside, and despite being worried the misters were going to be overbearing it was pleasant. One thing that was not OK, was that all the outdoor tables have a VERY sticky finish on them. I kept my menu to rest my forearms on because it felt as if the table was covered in dried Coca-Cola.

The appetizers, we got the beef tacos, were AMAZING. They were served in a flakey, croissant-like shell that I'm still dreaming about.

I ordered a burger and my girlfriend ordered the chicken avocado sandwich. Both were good but nothing that would make them the greatest we've tried.

Service was below par. Our server was not very knowledgeable. She did not know if their sushi was made with fresh of farmed fish (all of their sushi is FARM fish), did not know what size patty came on the burger (they claim 12oz) and she failed to return often to check on us. My water class had a chip in it, when our food was delivered (by the manager for some reason - I hate it when they do this eg order with the waitress, but somebody else delivers?!) we asked for an extra serving of ketchup from the manager...who never returned only to be seen two tables away chatting with a young lady.

A well-prepared Rainbow Roll was excellent, and so was Shrimp & Pork-Fried Rice to go with the ever enjoyable entree of moist Miso-Sake Marinated Baked Seabass.  A taste of grilled Ono with Mango Salsa also proved to be moist and delicious.  

I washed down my meal with hot Organic Sweet Chamonile Citrus Tea in a cast iron pot, while Diane enjoyed glasses of hard to find IBC Root Beer.  Service was very good except for late transport of the Fried Rice.  Our friends, who had lived for years in Hawaii, greatly enjoyed their dessert of Passion Fruit Creme Brulee (Lilikoi).

It was bound to happen. That remodel looks pricey! A second story was added and the previously dark dining room is now open and more complementary to the bar area.

What used to be half price rolls are now $4.50 and specialty rolls $10 during happy hour. New happy hour menu items include lobster & tuna flatbread and BBQ flatbread. I think a few of the rolls are new too. I had the Kona chopped salad while we dined on the patio during my latest visit. The dressing was a bit overwhelming (honey mustard) and something more tangy would be my choice next time. There was a ton of chicken in the salad so props. Not too bad for $14. My white wine wasn't very cold so that happened. No props.

Gone are the awkward metal chairs and tables from the patio and in their place are stylish and softer chairs and tables and some firepit seating as well! Nice. Looks like Kona is set to remain Summerlin's best and most popular happy hour spot.",Kp5KHBSmV-Htc9NeSjJfPA,6,3,4,0Nld2KAi4VFHWmunFKxnCg

The food is ok, their drinks are typical and the service is either fantastic or terrible.  What keeps me coming back is the patio and the friends I share it with.  The outdoor seating is wonderful.  You get to enjoy fresh air while you sit and chat with your friends; this is a rarity in Vegas.  Due to the hot temperatures, you can be hard pressed to find a place with outdoor setting.  Kona Grill has their patio open year round so you can enjoy something other than a stale indoor environment with recycled air.  I have NEVER eaten inside, it's not what you go to Kona for.

The food can be hit or miss here.  I have found their appetizers to be more consistent than their dinners.  Servers come and go relatively quickly.  This could be because of the amazing deals they have on food/drinks; the low prices create low tips and people sit and campout at tables for hours.  Servers aren't getting tipped on full price items.  If you have ever worked industry you know this is great for your guests but sucks for your bankroll.   

Kona Grill is a place you go to happy hour with your girlfriends, hit up for a mid-afternoon snack and cocktail on the weekend, or take a date you're not too sure about yet.  It's relaxed, well priced and there are plenty people to gawk at.  In Summerlin you have a lot of big players and big tits running around acting like they're still in their 20's.  Fun to watch if sports isn't your thing or your date is boring you.  

As for the menu... pick something, it will be mediocre like most everything else is on the menu.  The food won't make you sick but it won't knock your socks off either!  If you're into an outside atmosphere more than memorable food and drinks than Kona is for you.
