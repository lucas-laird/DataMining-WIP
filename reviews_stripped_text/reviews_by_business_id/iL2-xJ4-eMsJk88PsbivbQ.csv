If you want a meatball sub where the meatballs have been microwaved and it's so hot and rubbery it burns your mouth and the roll is soaking wet  then this is your place. Not only was the bread soaking wet it was burned also. If you get take out from this place make sure you check your order before you leave.,E8AnZrnrkCnEkvwkA8NHyg,0,0,1,S52BV1EkKqXuTjqe9xlXrA

And fried ravioli is AmazeBalls! Besides the size and the severe wait times I'd give them a solid 4 star. But.....

57291,2015-08-22,0,iL2-xJ4-eMsJk88PsbivbQ,"My husband and I went here for lunch on a Saturday. The place is clean and the employees are nice.  They had a deal for take out large pizza, so we jumped on it.  We ended up getting a large pepperoni, 12 garlic knots, 12 zeppolis, a side salad and a pineapple calzone. We paid almost 40, but felt it was a good deal for what we ordered. 

The calzone, for a small, was very large. Inside it had a mix of ricotta and mozzarella cheeses, so it was pretty creamy and sweet (especially with the pineapple). It came with hot marinara sauce. It was really good, but I didn't even get to half of it. Honestly, I was worried about my arteries with all that cheese haha! 

The pizza was good, but average. Pretty greasy, too. The oil leaked through the box on the car ride home. 

The garlic knots were average. Half were burnt on the bottom, the other were burnt on the top. We either got burnt bread or burnt garlic. 

The side salad was small, but the Italian dressing was good. It had olives, a half tomato, carrots, and a pepperchini. 

The zeppolis were the best part. The ended up giving us 24 instead of 12. They came hot and covered in powdered sugar. Just wish there was a chocolate sauce to dip it in.

We probably would go back if we were craving NY style pizza, but for now I'll stick with dominos.",gmIzfgQaZj0UqJxq1HUrWg,0,0,3,bCL8yzsPta9CNfDTT-_jYw

I have picked up pizza and other things from here and used the delivery as well. I lived in NYC for 12 years and have tried pizza in every borough in NYC. Broadway's is the best NYC pizza in Vegas I have tried. Not only good but fantastic. Delivery is fast and it is always been hot. The wings are awesome. Perfect. Crispy skins, juicy drummettes with a spicy sauce, fresh and very hot. Always fresh and hot. The spaghetti with meat sauce delivered is a huge foil tray of a ton of spaghetti enough for two. Lots of meat and sauce. You can tell they care because they actually put sauce in the bottom first then spaghetti and then more meat sauce.
Comes with a small side salad cold and crisp. The small side salad came with dressing on the side. In the salad was crisp iceberg, romaine, purple cabbage, carrot shavings, sliced black olives, two tomato wedges and a large pepperoncini. Perfect. Ice cold. Almost forgot the best part. Garlic knots. I can't explain it good enough but wow. My family and I have ordered at least 20 times and it has always been delivered fast, hot and great.

No one on here has the right to knock any small business down. Secondly, I come from a pizza background. My father owned 7 sit down pizza parlors in California in the 70s and 80s. I also owned my own pizza parlor and have tried pizza all over the world. I witnessed my fathers sit down pizza parlors destroyed by the launching of Dominos pizza and delivery of the worlds worst pizza. It was then I realized the majority of Americans don't really know what good pizza is or what bad pizza is. These are the same Americans who love Dominos and Chuck E Cheese Pizza which are the worst pizzas on the planet. I have to start off my review saying the Garlic Knots are amazing! I'm always leary of garlic knots since the dough is always the same as the pizza dough and really how exciting can it be. I was wrong. They are great. The sauce a tad to thin for me was still flavorful and hot. Next the service was friendly and as good as can be expected in a pizza joint. Its funny a reviewer mentioned cops frequent there and a table full was sitting across from me. Now the Pizza...I'm a huge fan of Johns Pizza in New York...and I am also a huge fan of Lombardis and Grimaldis ..because I am a fan of coal ovens. I prefer the taste.  I grew up working the deck ovens that Broadway Pizza uses...I like the cornmeal on the bottom...I liked the crust here..is it the best ..no....is it in the top 40 of all time...sure....the cheese was good...the sauce again the same as the knots..not a huge fan...but it had a good flavor..now here's my only complaint. I prefer a better grade of pepperoni. Like Hormel..the kind that get a little crispy around the edges..I really wasn't feeling it. But hey that's just me..the Chuck E Cheese and Dominos pizza lovers of the world will think Broadway Pizza is in their top 5. If I was one of the normal yelping douchbags on here I probably would give less stars. But, I'm not and I can't knock anyone for trying in todays economy.  Try it for yourself..I am sure you will like it. I'm still on the quest in search of the ultimate pizza pie.",d2T6l5_-tfMyLRcbBIcEFQ,0,0,4,ArD6ub_t7upFsbdE7hHiyw

I like the atmosphere, its not too big, a little noisy and you can smell the fresh food. Normally I always order a pizza, always comes out right and tastes great. Also I am a big fan of the grilled chicken roll. Just enough cheese in it and always generous with how much chicken is in there. Also the chicken parm for dinner with garlic knots is excellent also.

I like going in there at night when you get waitress service and you can relax while watching a game before the food comes out also.

I've grown accustomed to being disappointed by places with names like ""Joey's NY Pizza"" or ""5 Boroughs Pie"" so the name Broadway Pizza didn't quite translate to greatness for me. The signage was the first bright spot. White letters stuck on a black pinboard...so far so good. The lunch specials were impressive, I went with the 2 slices and a soda for $5.99. Side note, they also have Sicilian, a welcome option. Ordered and took a seat to watch some NYG coverage, noticed the Giants flag, smiled a huge cheesy (pun intended) smile. This place is legit! Slices were brought over nice and hot on 2 paper plates. They were seriously awesome. Perfect amount of cheese, sauce and perfectly foldable.

I ordered a pepperoni slice with mild sauce on my chicken fingers and got ranch to go with it... I LOVED IT... One of the other girls at work was telling me about the spaghetti from there as well...

Tonight we thought we'd try something different, so we ordered other items off the menu. My husband had the Italian Combo sandwich, and I had the lasagna. We ordered these as to-go items, and they both traveled well in the takeout containers. The sandwich was flavorful, with fresh bread and a good selection of meat. The lasagna came with a side salad and an order of six garlic knots. LOVE the knots, and I can't imagine eating the pasta without them! I've had better lasagna, but this was pretty good for a storefront takeout -- and it was a LOT better than I could have pulled off at home. Plus the portion was big enough for us to have leftovers, and lasagna is always better the next day!

A good New York slice should be pliable when folded and not have the crust dry and break when folded.  By the second half of the slice, the crust is noticeably dry and bland.  It was fine pizza, but I would not go out of my way to eat there again.  One diner was a long time diner and eaten there for 20 years.

I stopped by there today ordered a slice of pepperoni and hot wings with fries. The price is reasonable for what you get but the pizza it self doesn't have much flavor. The dough didn't taste like anything which I found surprising most of these mom and pop pizzerias make there own dough. My wings were not hot at all they were dry on the sauce and over cooked.

I walked in 3/3/16 around 6:30 and placed a to-go order. I got a small calzone with pepperoni and fresh garlic, and an order of hot fingers and fries. I also got a couple extra sides of crack ranch, and my total was just about $22. The calzone was everything you could want from a 'zone. It was stuffed with ricotta, mozzarella, pepperoni and garlic and came with a side of ""sauce"" which is their marinara. It was hot and cheesy and delicious. I would definitely order this again, but next time I'd go easy on the garlic because I could have killed a vampire shortly after eating. 

As for the fingers, you can see from my pix they half-assed the sauce and I basically ended up with plain fingers with a drizzle of hot. You can tell no fucks were given in the preparing of my fingers and although it's a fairly small issue, it's the principle of the matter. I spent $9.25 for fingers and fries and didn't even care to eat them after that.  Would I go back? Yes.

Horrible, Horrible!! 

Our party of four ordered pizza and an order of fries to be delivered to our hotel off the downtown strip on Friday night, on recommendation from the bell desk. First when we called to order they said it would take anywhere from 45min-1 hour to get to us, and we would have to wait in the lobby for the driver. 

OK, so it's our weekend in Vegas, and we had to wait in the lobby for an hour, I thought OK.. I can see that, it's a busy night with traffic and all. So we ordered our pizza, and waited, waited and waited.. Did I say we waited??? OK, it took over two hours for the driver to deliver our food. We all rushed up stairs to eat, cause we were starving. The pizza was $20 bucks, and the fries $3. 

We got up to the room and the freaking pizza was stone cold. We opened the french fries, and OMG, so nasty.. The fries were drenched in grease from sitting, stone cold, and rubbery, not eatable. No one dared to touch those.. We did eat the pizza, but because we where hungry.. It wasn't good either.., tasted like it sat around for a few hours.. you know those party days where you wake up the next morning and eat a piece of pizza, a little stale, and hard.. yeah.. that's what I'm talking about. 

That night, I didn't want it to ruin my night, so we partied.. Anyways the next morning I got to thinking that was just wrong.. Why did we pay $30 for crap food like that, and how can they have given us cold food?? 

I was very calm, and wanted to give the resturant some feedback to how I was feeling.

I called the restaurant, and before I could even tell the lady my complaint or what order I was calling about, she cuts me off and pretty much tells me I'm lying.. I've worked in customer service for over 15 years now and know the standard of how to treat a customer, blah blah blah, Oh I'm so sorry about that...smile.(wink).. but no,  I was really Mad by how rude she was treating me over the phone, and told her it's nice that her customer service skills don't included listening to the customer. I would not recommend this pizza place to anyone!!

When I moved to Vegas several months ago, I began my quest to find the best pizza.  My craving got the best of me at work one day, and I decided to Yelp the nearest pizza place to my office...it turned out to be Broadway Pizzeria.
At first, I was hesitant.  Broadway is located in a strip mall I'm not very fond of (awful parking lot and the occasional shady character)...but I proceeded to take my chances.

It's a homemade, rich, buttery buttermilk ranch, but wait, that's not all...infused with roasted garlic flavor?!? I honestly don't know what they put in their ranch, but it set off our pizza dinner to a whole new level. It's what ranch dreams are made of. Flavor rating: 5/5

The pizza- extra hooked up with cheese, toppings were decent, crust not too shabby. Overall, I would dabble again in their pizzas. Flavor rating: 3/5

The spicy buffalo wings- small, dry, overcooked, and the seasoning was not memorable. Flavor rating: 1/5

The garlic knots- 12 free knots with a purchase of a large pizza! That's called a hookup ya'll. The knots were flavorful and moist. I dunked them like crazy in the house ranch. So good! Flavor rating: 5/5

I honestly feel that the ranch enhanced the pizza, wings, and the knots by a lot. Without their house ranch, I would be a sad panda.",u_wqt9RshdZsoj8ikLqoEQ,6,6,5,bLQSx1GAERNV9PWmATLIow

2775705,2012-11-26,4,iL2-xJ4-eMsJk88PsbivbQ,"Pizza is universally loved. And pizza holds a serious cultural position in the United States in particular. It is not rare to meet someone in America who has a testimony to the superiority of a small mom-and-pop hole-in-the-wall joint back in one of New York City's five Burroughs. New York pizza is the standard by which pizza is judged. Chicago style is also important, but does not hold the prestige of a NY pie.

Vegas is a city with deep New York ties. Most of Las Vegas's Founding Fathers had deep ties to the New York mafia. Hoping for a baptism and a fresh start in this faraway desert, gangsters often demanded that if they were forced to live in this arid wasteland, at least they should be provided with their creature comforts: a Maria Callas recording, a fine chianti, and maybe a pizza pie.

But the crime bosses at La Cosa Nostra were having none of it. The bosses were nervous Italian culture was becoming watered-down and too Americanized. They  issued an edict in 1952 that made it a crime punishable by death to make an authentic NY pie west of Cincinnati. Sinatra and Dino would have to endure their forsaken oasis without the cuisine they loved. But happily they were not barred from showgirls, booze, or gambling.

Vegas Italian food suffered (see Battista's Hole in the Wall).

Finally, the edict was lifted shortly after Gotti was imprisoned for life. Broadway Pizzeria on Rancho and Charleston opened 90 days later. Happiness ensued.",WltNPOXSLUck_eeiKCnsig,2,1,5,iMMc3bzTH3GYmv8e1i-F2Q

I was even more shocked that I only have 2 Yelp check-ins at Anthony & Mario's place because I've been there at least 3 time this month alone and I'm sure at least 150 times in my life. With all of that said let's get to the pizza.

  Broadway Pizza is exactly the same delicious pie that you will find at the local pizza joints when perusing the streets of New York City. The crust is always the perfect thickness and texture with a great crispiness that only comes from using the best ingredients. The sauce is sweet and well-seasoned; the cheese is plentiful and simply delicious. My wife and I are into the cheese pizza thing lately because the flavor of the pie can't be masked by the overwhelming taste of sausage, onions, or peppers and Broadway doesn't disappoint. We have had occasion to order a more loaded pie when our kids are with us and I can say those pizzas have been delicious as well. 

  The other staple of our trips to Broadway are the garlic knots. For any of you that haven't experienced Broadway Pizza's garlic knots my best description would be; buttery, garlicy, mounds of love!! The knots are made from pizza dough which is rolled out and twisted into what else; knots, and then baked. They are slathered with butter garlic and served hot. They are a treat!!

  Broadway had 2 locations, Rancho at Charleston and West Sahara near Cimarron. Funny thing is the Sahara location seems to do their crust a little differently. The crust at Sahara seems to be a little thicker than at Rancho. It still tastes great but tends to not be as crisp as the Rancho location. Either way Broadway Pizza is a winner if you're looking for a great NY style pie!!",q2b4pAo_6tP7jNFKI5Hztw,5,2,5,h1uTRUoesZRAsBeO_ErdUA

I recently decided to try the cheese pizza because that's an obvious benchmark to measure a place like this. It's vastly superior to any of the corporate takeout places you're used to and far beyond comparison with any sort of store bought pizzas such as Digiorno, Kirkland and Red Baron pizza. 

The slices were not overly greasy, and the cheese was not excessive or falling off the edges. I can't remember the last time I had a plain slice of pizza that was so perfect--even the sauce was enjoyable, and not overused. Clearly, the management really is from New York because they seem to have perfected their simple, traditional thin crust pizza. Two slices easily satisfied me during a recent lunch break.

That's not to mention their friendly staff or their tasty deli subs, which I've also tried on a previous occasion. I will have to return to try some of their hot subs and pasta dishes because they have definitely got my attention. If I have another great experience here, I'll have to bump the stars up to 5.",U4ERp63gvcIeOis8UdtxvA,0,0,4,z4ltx3KdHprYlF7ycJOqcQ

Since were in a rush, we only had time to order their pre-made slices (which they subsequently reheat in the oven). I ordered a slice of cheese pizza with mushrooms. 

The pizza was not bad, but I've had tastier NY pizza (with even crispier crusts, my favorite part). Since I didn't really get a chance to taste much though, I will reserve a more detailed review for when I've tried more off of the menu.

This place consistently stays busy, but don't let the long line discourage you because it moves quickly. There is a decent amount of booths and tables with chairs inside and they also have highchairs. 

2 Cheese Slices and Drink ($5.95 lunch special) - The slices are big and the crust is thin yet doesn't flop when picked up. This isn't one of those pizza places that refuses to sell ranch or frowns when someone orders a side of it. Instead they gladly sell a lot of ranch (it's made in-house with garlic powder making it a different and tasty addition to dip your pizza in!) each day and you can get your fix in 2 oz ($0.35), 4 oz ($0.70) or 8 ($1.40) oz sizes. 

Pizza by the Slice - If you just want a single slice it's $2.35 for Neopolitan and $2.40 for Sicilian with an additional $0.40 cents per topping. While I like the regular slices and like to eat them on occasion, it's really the Sicilian pizza ($6.15 for 2 pieces and a drink during the lunch special) that I love to come here for. I have been eating here for many years and the pizza still tastes the same and the specials they have are fairly priced, but it's the Sicilian that keeps me coming back. With the Sicilian pizza it's got a perfectly crisp base and a light and fluffy top with a fair amount of sauce and cheese. If you are a ""dipper"" like me then don't forget a side of ranch with the Sicilian because it's a must. 

Lunch specials are from 11 am - 3 pm 7 days a week and they have a good variety of options for everyone. Aside from pizza they also have fingers and wings, pasta, hot and cold sandwiches, garlic knots and bread, salad and there are a handful of desert options. Currently they have a dine-in and pick-up special where you can get a 16""  cheese pizza for $13.49, but make sure and call them or stop by because their website isn't always up to date with the current specials they have on flyers at the counter where you order.",Fv0e9RIV9jw5TX3ctA1WbA,67,66,4,9kBkuZ-e1pu8ovLMF8O-dA

Anyhow, the delivery man was so cordial, as were all delivery men after him. 

On another occasion, mom needed gluten free grub. Broadway was not 100% sure that the stock they used was gluten free, so they delivered the soup with the can so that we could evaluate the ingredients to assure ourselves. I felt that was really above and beyond because my mom never believes people when they say their food's gluten free. She likes to see proof.

Broadway Pizza truly gets customer service. 

As for the food, I ordered the Cannellini soup several times even after I wasn't sick anymore. Big containers delivered every couple of weeks.

I like the calzones here as well...heart and loaded with goodness and without that cheap ass doughy taste you get from some pizza joints.

Shrimp primivera.....was bomb as well..a surprise from a place like this. Large in portions and very moist. Not the usual chewy over done deals you get sometimes.  

The salads are to the point but nothing stellar but they are always cold crisp and fresh. My only complaint is the ranch...I like that good cold thick ranch but theirs is a little runny and has a different taste for sure. It also makes me enjoy their wings a little less.

I met one of the owners Anthony, a really nice guy and when he told me he's from Long Island I appreciated his food even More, because only a true New Yorker knows what true Italian Food is suppose to taste like!

Now on to the food...the pizza is good, flavor taste like NY but the size of it is not true to the real size of a NYC pie. Their Chicken parm Sub really hit home for me, their Philly cheese steak sub is my ""go to"" item....the only thing that truely broke my heart are their zeppoles smh...A true zeppole is suppose to be light, fluffy and slightly greesey lol their zeppoles tasted like their pizza dough just fried up and drizzled with powdered sugar. No bueno! lol...Another thing that bothered me was their Garlic Knots, Don't go cheap on your garlic knots and sprinkle garlic powder over them, that is soo disrespectful....Garlic knots are  little balls of love! U gotta chop up fresh garlic and olive oil to put on those bad boys Anthony...it kills me- because u know this! 

I wish this place had rice balls!  man I miss a good rice ball! I have yet to try their cannolis, I hope it Doesn't taste generic or store bought. That's next on my list to try....Anothny told me to try their pasta dishes..but I'm extremely skeptical about my pasta. My standards are way to high for Vegas, so I hope u bring it Broadway! Lmaooo

Overall I'm definitely going to be a regular at this place from now on. Nothing makes me feel more secure about my Food than knowing a true New Yorker made it!

I think wow !! I can't wait to try it out, so on my last visit to the city I travel up Charleston Blvd. past the Palace Station ( pre O J ) and find the pizzeria tucked away in a small strip mall. A small little pizza shop selling pizza by the slice is not exactly what I envisioned as what the ""best pizza in Vegas,"" was going to look like. Yes, I expected something gaudy and pretentious like in the rest of the city. 
Their menu is varied and we tried a calzone - very nice; and a few pieces of pizza by the slice. 
The nice thing about A&M's is that for a modest price they will enhance your basic slice of cheese pizza with the toppings of your choice.  When my hamburger mushroom and black olive masterpiece arrived at the table, it was loaded or virtually smothered in toppings. 
The pizza was excellent. What more can you say. 

The atmosphere is what you would expect from a pizza front selling pizza by the slice - it might even remind you of ""New York"". The staff is very friendly and helpful and they helped make the experience much better than my initial impression after such a huge build up on Yahoo - but then again, it might just be Yahoo .........

Yeah, I'm a hefty guy and I'm supposed to be watching my diet.  But man, pizza is one of my weak points.  Be it the variety of pizzas to be had of America's #1 top money-making foods, or the fact that I survived off of this and hand-me-down Burger King leftovers during my collegiate years...pizza just holds dear to my heart.

Broadway Pizzeria ain't your fancy, California-inspired, artisan, renaissance, froo-froo metrosexual pizza.  They do what they do fast...they from New York baby!  Just check out the NY-inspired mural on their wall!  No kissin' your A$$ while talking to you about your portfolio and pouring you a glass of the new merlot from their family winery.  Get in, sit down, get a menu, get your order in, eat your pie, and go!  This place is popular for the quick lunch crowd!  

They do Italian, and they do a good job at it.  You got your NY style pizza (I love me that thin, crispy crust), they do the thicker Sicilian style pizza, they got salads, fingers and wings, Italian specialties, hot subs, cold subs, calzones, and desserts.  But dammit, get the GARLIC KNOTS!  One of the house specialties.  Great when they're hot and fresh with a side of marinara.

But always, always get a slice of pie at Broadway!  It's good stuff!  Get yourself their pick-up special, a large 16"" cheese pizza for $11.99.  Sure it sounds a bit plain, but if you have a foundation of a cheese pizza that tastes like crap (Pizza Hut...I choose you!) then how can adding toppings make it any better?  Broadway's cheese pizza is bomb diggity delicious!  Good crust with fresh sauce and good quality cheese.  Very tasty.  Go ahead and add a topping or two for a tiny additional cost.  I love mine with fresh mushrooms and either their sliced sausage or pepperoni.  Top mine with some grated parmesan, garlic and red pepper flakes, and a nice cold beer?  I'm good, seriously.  In my opinion, best NY pizza you can have here in LV...and yeah, I've had NY pizza from NY!

This place is usually upbeat, especially during lunch rush.  Eat in if they have the space, or get a fast lunch to go for take out.  Service is quick and friendly.  They have a ton of daily lunch specials to choose from.  And the prices are on the cheap!  Don't be discouraged about any of the shouting, that's how some of the New Yorkers talk!

I will give it four stars based on the consistent high quality food.  I have only ordered the eggplant parm sandwich from here.  This is by far my favorite place to get such a sandwich.  It is loaded with tender fried eggplant, smothered with a generous serving of marninara sauce and topped with what seems to be a half a brick of cheese.  The flavor is unsurpassed.  The bread is is always tough enough to hold up to the sauce yet not so tough you can't eat it.  There is so much more than that on the menu that I would like to try but haven't yet.  They have specialty pizza's with white sauce.  They have the other sandwiches, of course.  And their own claim to fame, garlic knots.  I want it all.  If there is anything to complain about when it comes to Broadway Pizzeria, it is that their service is on the slow side.  This, however, is offset by the reason behind the slow service.  It is always busy.  That says a lot for a busniess when the line is out the door.  It proves this is some place worth checking out.  Be warned though, parking is sparse in this shopping center.

We used a restaurant certificate (only 1 certificate per month can be used BTW, not just here, that's every restaurant policy that participates in the program) (our certificate was a $20 minimum purchase) for take-out. I'm not sure if you can use a certificate in conjunction with the takeout special ($12.99 large cheese pizza). Got the large white pizza (there are two different kinds of white pizzas) and the stuffed garlic knots. Pretty good sized menu- had appetizers, sub sandwiches, and salads in addition to the pizza. Hubby said there was a good amount of people there dining in. 

This was the first time we got some food here, but not the first time we had the pizza, as my MIL gave us some pizza from here a while back; which we thought was really good, and that was left over! The thin sliced pizza is yummy. Very satisfying. I don't have white pizza often. 

Mmm, white pizza!!! Mmm, stuffed garlic knots!!! 

Good thing we had someone else over, so the large pizza was good for the three of us, and we still had a couple slices to eat the next day (and one knot). The stuffed garlic knots (pepperoni and cheese- note: doesn't specify on the menu) were so good. Comes with marinara sauce. Our friend kept burping up the garlic, but it wasn't unpleasant, like if I had portuguese sausage (I can't have that anymore, burping for 15 hours is unbearable). The funny thing is that the next morning, the car still smelled like garlic! And same with the house, too. Good thing both of us had garlic breath because it's bad when just one of us has garlic.

We had a veggie calzone and small white pizza with an order of garlic knots. They are apparently famous for the garlic knots, and we were not disappointed. Very fresh, with a strong (but not over powering) real garlic flavor. Noting the deliciousness of the knots, it is no surprise that the crust on the calzone and pizza are the highlights. It is not too thin, full of flavor and not soggy. 
The ingredients on both the pizza and the calzone seemed fresh, and were also full of flavor.

FOOD: 
Broadway Special (Pepperoni, Green Peppers, Mushrooms, Sausage, Meatballs - omitted the olives and onions) - The pizza wasnt bad but it wasnt authentic NYC Pizza.  The crust could have been been a little bit more crisp but I think what it really was the topping.  It need that cheesey gooey-ness that normally eat when you take a bit and have that cheese string still connected to the slice... and that didnt happen.

SERVICE:
The staff was really friendly and always made a point to check with us to make sure we had everything we needed.

After a very late night, I awoke with a mean hangover and a hankering for some wings.  After coming to an agreement that we were in no shape to leave our apartment, we decided delivery was the only way to go.  

I searched out some delivery options (on Yelp, of course), and decided on pizza and wings from Broadway. ...Mistake number one... I found a special on their website and when I called to order it, the prices were listed wrong - it was actually more expensive than what was listed, but we were starving and needed sustenance, so I ordered anyway.

The food arrived in a timely manner, the delivery guy was super nice, and we were ready to dig in.  Unfortunately, what we dug into was not what we'd hoped for.  The wings were dry, overcooked, and the sauce wasn't very spicy (considering we ordered the hot wings).  The pizza crust was super bland and dry, and the cheese was nothing to write home about either.  For someone who avoids gluten and dairy 90% of the time, when I break those rules, it had better be for some mind-blowing New York style pizza, which this was definitely not.  

My recommendation? If you want amazing wings, go to Twin Peaks.  Great pizza? Go to Secret Pizza.

I live in the east for a while, and I would rank this place's Sicilian pie right up there with pizza places in the east.
The place is small, but accommodating nonetheless.
The staff is extremely friendly (my wife is always accusing the girls of flirting with me, so I can only pick-up their pizza and not stay there to eat it.
They offer drinks in there that you don't normally see in any eatery (e.g. Yoohoo, Sobe, etc.) which I think is neat.

On their website right now, it states that they are offering their large Upstate White pizza for the same price as a medium (see photo attached). Cool, so I called and ordered it as take out. And when I came to pick it up and asked them about the special, they would not honor the price. ....Huh? IT SAYS IT RIGHT THERE ON YOUR WEBSITE! I even showed it to the cashier who took my phone and showed it to the owner (who by the way, was sitting in the back stuffing his face- how professional). The owner didn't even bother to get up to come talk to me and instead I saw him just shrug and mutter something while chewing. And when the cashier came back to me he simply said, ""Oh, prices change."" Well, one of my biggest pet peeves is when people don't follow through with their word. Like what is the point of offering that special if you don't even honor it?? Or if it's wrong, don't just shrug like it's whatever and fix it!

The Broadway Special is just that, special; and probably the best value on the menu. Last night, we tried the Broadway Special Sicilian. As someone that is not normally a fan of thick crust pizzas, or the extra wait to get them, all I can say is wow. This crust has all the marks of a fine quality bread, Slightly crunchy on the outside, slightly chewy on the inside.
I have tried the calzone, and it was good; but I keep coming back to the pizza.
My wife has tried both the soups, and even if they are a touch on expensive side, we keep getting them because she keeps raving about them.
Many people here have raved about the garlic knots. Let's agree to disagree. We've had them where they tasted decent exactly once out of close to a dozen orders. So we have dubbed them Garlic nots- they come free with dinner or soup, you get what you pay for.
We have ordered the chicken wings once and they were not pleasant at all. They were over cooked, dry, and generally inedible.

Having said that, this is a Pizza place and one of the best Pizza's at the best price you will find in the Vegas area.

Chances are, you haven't.

Attilio's Pizza is this little strip mall storefront next to an Acme grocery store in the small village of Lincroft, New Jersey, about 45 minutes' train ride from midtown Manhattan.

I grew up eating Attilio's, and it is to this day the standard by which I judge all other pizza.

The reason that I mention this is, the first time I took a bite out of a slice of Broadway pizza, I was instantly transported back to my childhood, biting into a crisp, thin crust topped with thin, subtly slightly sweet tomato sauce, just enough cheese and oregano.

Perfect, textbook NY/NJ style pizza and probably my 2nd favorite spot in town for this style of pizza - #1 being Secret Pizza at the Cosmopolitan - but here, you actually pay normal pizza prices for pizza instead of the gouging that happens at center Strip.

One of the bonuses to this place, as can be seen in the many photos is that it's pizzas are huge. If you order a large, you in fact, get an extremely large pizza. It's typical New York style pizza and is pretty greasy, ESPECIALLY if you get the pepperoni, which I wasn't exactly a fan of. They put plenty of toppings on the pizza and make sure that there aren't areas that are bare. I know of some other places that hurry to put toppings on, thus missing areas of the pizza. No beuno. They cater to special diets and have gluten free pizza (although I haven't tried it). This was handy since one of the people we were ordering for had a pork allergy. I like their ground beef pizza.. it wasn't as greasy as the others. OH, and their garlic knots. Yes. Those. They were by FAR my favorite thing about this place. Little carb pockets of goodness. If you ever go there, order some if you like bread. You won't be disappointed.

All and all, it's an okay place. Nothing really stands out about the pizza. It's better then fast food pizza for sure, but not AMAZING. Nothing I'd go out of my way to eat. If you are in the area and feel like some pizza that's a little better then fast food quality, sure, go for it.

$30.16 got me a large cheese pizza, twelve wings, 8 oz. of ranch dressing, and a small side dinner salad. I ordered takeout from here on Sunday 3-6-16.  

I asked for the wings only but my box had fries in it.  Hey, I'm not complaining; it just wasn't what I ordered.  The wings were small and on the dry side but I like my wings well done and they do provide additional sauce on the side without asking.  Their house-made ranch is extremely tasty so I got 8 ounces of it for my own ""personal use"".  

The pizza was sadly a bit disappointing compared to the first time I went here.  The crust was thick and fluffy.  I would rather have the thin, crunchy crust.  Maybe when you dine in and they pop the already-cooked slices in the oven to warm them up is when the magic happens.

How can you have a food place with no bathroom for customers.  Who make decisions like this?,Sd53IaacyyC5YT_a6Fcr-w,0,0,2,XfuY_vGu59HeZh2-abSLig

The pizza is good and I can eat the crust because I want to, not because I don't want to waste food. 

The ranch is amazing. I would drink it if it wasn't even better on salads or wings. 

The wings, however, were amazing the first time I had them and rock hard and overcooked the second time. =((((",SgcNTpx_ASfvyQHmLU443A,1,0,3,8RWbl3WblHBBElFQ-hetHw

My boyfriend and I just happened upon this joint via a coupon in the local edition of the 2013 entertainment guide as we wanted to try a new place. There was a coupon for 50% off of any pizza so I quickly yelped it and saw a four star rating. I read some of the reviews which boasted of their famous garlic knots as well so there we went to satisfy our pizza fix!

We decided on the 16' uptown white pizza (mozzarella), their other white pizza is made with ricotta cheese instead. We also got an order of one dozen garlic knots that come with a side of marinara sauce.

Wow, the pizza was delicious and drizzling with olive oil, and the garlic knots were fresh with butter and garlic! The crust and generous amount of cheese on the pizza was Amazing. I had an orgasm of flavor in my mouth and it felt and tasted so damn good!

They took $7.00 off of our pizza with the 50% off coupon we had so our large pizza and dozen garlic knots total only came to $12 which is a bargain for so much food!

We will be back and now we have a paper menu to review which is full of so many of their great food options to try!

We are fans!",deL6e_z9xqZTIODKqnvRXQ,11,4,5,RZw7jc9_iZtIEnIGbFWHdA

I was ravenous, having just fasted for some minor eye surgery in a building fronting this shopping center.  Being slightly groggy from the local anesthesia didn't dull my taste buds.  The spinach/broccoli pizza we had was fabulous, the crust crisp and not oversalted, and it made me forget the pain that started to kick in just as I was wolfing down slice #1.   Though we ordered at the counter, the pizza was served to us, and the service was great, too.

Hubby said:  ""Gee, this place isn't really THAT far.""  

We'll be back, sooner rather than later, since he's already polished off two of the four leftover slices I froze to save for another quick dinner for us.  Fie!",m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,3,2,5,OnmxS0jExKELLnu-eOtWHw

This place is close to my school too, so I stopped by on my way out. I got a pepperoni to-go. It was only $3.50 with a can of soda! That's a deal!! The pizza is yummy with a nice crispy crust. Best part is that it's not overly greasy. I didn't feel like I was going to die after eating this. Highly recommend!!",cuCf5ydDSmXAgAeCf8ELtA,0,0,4,73MF_cesU4U5e4pKyBSkrA

The food portions are awesome and it tasted great. I took my two little girls here with me and my wife... The waitress was super friendly and helpful. By far my most favorite place that I've eaten at in Las Vegas. The ranch sauce is unique and very good as well. Go here!,QqqaasSnad8tcFyQWPm9JA,0,0,5,ewfmSX0eOXJWyQF8Y_DKiw

I ordered a few more items than my hands could handle and one of the team members came out from behind the counter, helped me with my drinks AND helped me carry out my items to my car. I felt really bad because the parking lot is always busy during lunch so I had to park far but he was more than happy to help. We ordered a pepperoni calzone, turkey sandwich, stuffed garlic knots and chicken fingers and fries. Not one of us was disappointed in our food. The calzone was fricken huge!!! See pictures! The stuffed garlic knots were stuffed with cheese and pepperoni, so filling. That could've been a meal of its own. I could smell the bbq on the chicken fingers before I even opened the bag. My nostrils were suddenly awakened by the spicy sauce smothered on the chicken fingers. And the sandwich was so big that half would've been sufficed. This place a great lunch spot for nearby businesses and even for dinner so if you want to stop by before heading home its a great place to go to.",Znid_azpcHmdRMHGicmkWA,9,9,4,KNs6IeD1TniJDzihVWhaXg

We got a cheese pizza and it was great!!! The place was packed and it was only about 4pm. The staff was very friendly. As i recently became vegetarian and trying to become a vegan i will return about one more time as i am not going to eat dairy anymore. I sure wish i started to go there years ago, as everything looked great. My three year old who is not a big eater ate two giant slices. What more can you say considering most pizza she eats she will only take a couple of bites. I am originally from the philly-new york area and it does rank up to the good pizza places back there.",Y2jRTW_yFPwd1Nhu5fCCPg,0,0,4,cSPxzhuR_Th0kB7UopIBKw
