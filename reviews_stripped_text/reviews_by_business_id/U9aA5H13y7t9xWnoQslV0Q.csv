Stopped in for some lunch before going to the airport, place was pretty dead for just past mid-day. Service was quick and friendly, prices are high for what you are getting but that may just be the Cesar's way of doing things. Guessing a lower end casino would have had lower prices on food. Eating partner had the beef noodle soup, standard classic, tasty with a decent amount of meat just be warned that this soup is supposed to contain a lot of fat and some tendon so there are chewy bites and bits you will spit out but that is the way it is supposed to be. I had a cold noodle dish, sorry forgetting the name, with veggies and small bits of beef. It was good healthy and refreshing, just wish for ~$20 there was a bit more. In the end a cool spot, especially if you watch the gentleman in the front pull the noodles, worth a try for a snack, but be willing to pay a bit more than I would think is reasonable.",aYLS5lhdCp5HSPOtkMvapw,0,0,4,xzsRx1hR7voOHyQmSpBN7w

We were staying at Caesars so we thought this would be a good stop.

First off, the restaurant is decorated with fish tanks with goldfish everywhere. It was cool at first but then it started getting trippy and then started making me nauseous and dizzy (not good for those who are hungover).

We told our waiter that we had a flight to catch so we had to make it snappy. There were 6 of us so we ordered a handful of dishes to share:

+chicken soup
+mapo tofu
+beef with broccoli
+kung pao chicken
+seafood noodles

Rice was extra so we had to order a few bowls of white rice. The dishes were nothing fancy, nothing special. The portions were not as big as a lot asian restaurants and were priced a little higher but nothing too surprising... its Las Vegas in the Caesars Palace.",5qrAunC4UHcG4jNQPfv7fA,1,0,3,MmqX8yZlH3Mp4Jr18wPAdQ

I'm sure any of the noodle dishes would be good and it's fun to watch them make from scratch. A surprisingly great dish was the tofu with scallions. I didn't think it would be anything special but it was delicious. They put sesame oil in it. So tasty. The shrimp dumplings were just ok, wouldn't order them again. 

Decor is really cool and modern but not what I expected with a Chinese restaurant. It threw me off a little. It is expensive for what you get - you can get more authentic homemade noodles for way cheaper off the strip.

Noodles were incredibly salty and tasteless. $6 Dan Dan from Pei Wei is 10x better.  Each dish was $16 a pop. Mapo tofu didn't even come with rice, lol. Never seen that before, that spicy dish without rice.  When I asked for just plain ol white steamed rice, it was $3.99.  But, overpriced food is nothing new, this is Vegas after all, it's supposed to be overpriced.  My problem is that these guys don't even try to deliver any semblance of quality.  Try Noodle Asia at Venetian if you want overpriced food done right.
Mapo tofu was also the worst I have tasted, no surprise there. 
Serving staffs were nice, but the hostess was very uncaring and clearly didn't want to work there. 
However, I knew this place was going to be bad based on all the poor reviews, but I'm staying at Caesars the whole week and i had per diem to burn and felt lazy last night.  Taught me a lesson why you shouldn't be lazy.

89490,2012-04-13,0,U9aA5H13y7t9xWnoQslV0Q,"My husband and I liked eating at this place. First of all, the food was good! I am comparing it with what I had in Beijing and Hong Kong, so that's how I conclude. They hand pulled their own noodles, make their own dumpling skins and knife shredded their own noodles, and the qualities of the noodles are high. I don't care that it's a pricey place when the high quality is delivered.

We ordered Xiao Long Bao and Lan Zhou La Mein with Knife Shredded Noodle instead of Hand Pulled Noodle. The noodle was awesome. The noodle texture was just like what I had in Beijing. The Xiao Long Bao was awesome too, the skin was so thin and there was a lot of juice inside each of them. And each was huge too!

The service was good too. Everyone was polite and nice. And I like the fact that they don't always come asking if we are okay, as that's actually not good for us Chinese to be asked for too many times, asking too often is a gesture of rushing someone to leave instead. So if you are in a Chinese restaurant and you are not always asked whether you are doing fine, it's not because they are ignoring you, they are actually letting you to have your space, take your time to relax and chill. I do notice that they always keep an eye out for every table to see if anyone is waving their hand asking for help. So that's a good service for us already. We could actually wave anyone to come and assist us, we didn't have to wave to the same person who took our order. That's what I like in a good Chinese restaurant.

As being born and raised in Hong Kong, and have been in Beijing eating all over, I consider this place delivering high quality Beijing style noodles and Shanghai Xiao Long Bao.

After we finished our meal, we stood outside and watched the old chef making hand-pulled noodle, and watched his assistant making the knife-shredded noodle. The old chef did make the hand-pulled noodle very nicely. Nice hands and skills. We also saw another assistant chef making dumpling further inside the kitchen. We were happy with what we ate and with the experience. (we went by the previous night and watched a younger chef making hand-pulled noodle; I think the older chef's skills was way better than the younger chef, which makes sense as the older chef has more experience than the younger chef does)

We admit that the price is expensive, but again it's not something we eat every day for every meal, it's okay to pay the price to get high quality food. At least cheaper than flying to Beijing to satisfy our crave of Beijing style Knife-Shredded noodle or Hand-Pulled Noodle. Both kinds of noodles are good, I just personally like Knife-Shredded noodle more because of its shape. You can get probably something with the same name off the strip with cheaper price, but they just don't taste good or authentic (meaning not the same as what I had in Beijing) at all, then what's the point for them being cheap if they don't even taste right.

We will go back again.

Note: they offer Total Reward price ($1-2 cheaper for each item) when dining with your Total Reward card. Harrah knows how to do business. This makes me dine more at his properties more than at MGM's. I got discount dining at some other places that are in Harrah's properties, too. And they gave each of us $10 dining credit for just joining Total Reward the first time. So we had $20 free to spend on dining.",gm8nNoA3uB4In5o_Hxpq3g,0,0,4,_V5gw9b-5zyoQ00BeAoakg

I thought the place was great. Yes the food is a little pricey but you're in Vegas, at a huge hotel. If you want cheap Asian food, get off the strip!

With that out of the way, I found the staff very friendly. The hostess talked with us about the menu prior to going in and once seated we had a couple more questions about the noodles. The waiter was patient with us and explained the spice level of the dishes we were interested in and compared it to something that we may of already had. My friend and I each ordered the Szechuan noodles (hot & cold) to split. It just so worked out that she preferred the one while I, the other. The waiter was very attentive with making sure we were okay and that we have enough water. 

The restaurant is kind of small but I liked it. You could see the cooks in the back and the guy in the front making noodles all from your table. I loved the decor with the walls, gold fish tanks, even the glasses matched the theme.

My girlfriend and I were unfortunate victims of this restaurant.  Having just flown into Vegas from New York that morning, maybe we were jetlagged.  Maybe the brightly lighted fish tanks allured us.   But alas, the fates took us here and it ruined our entire evening.

We were walking around Caesar's Palace and saw advertisements.  ""A noodle bar?""  It sounded quirky and interesting enough, an honestly delightful complement to all the other restaurant reservations we had made for the rest of our trip.  So we strolled in, after quickly reading a few Yelp reviews.  They weren't positive.

We had figured that perhaps some people were too harsh, and the reviews were mixed.  Well, I should have figured something was up when the person with the most check-ins for this restaurant was our hostess.   And it began.

Taking a seat, I couldn't help notice that as opposed to the normal restaurant attire of Vegas, most of the other patrons were wearing t-shirts, shorts, and swim trunks.  At 7 pm at night.  I shrugged it off, and looked towards my girlfriend who was trying to piece together the atmosphere as it was her first time in Vegas.  We trucked on and ordered.

The food arrived 5 minutes later.  Never a good sign, I've learned.  The pork buns themselves were okay..but horribly overpriced.  Our noodle dish however, left us in such disbelief that we called over the waiter. As opposed to its 22 dollar price tag, we had gotten lo-mein made with spaghetti.  In sheer disbelief, we called over the waiter as we had felt like we were massively gutted.   We had gotten a noodle dish so terrible, I would have gladly preferred to go to the local mall, and gotten food court lo mein.  

Because we're troopers, we finished the meal and reached for our check.  Still hungry, we noticed that the price tag of the meal was 50 dollars.   For a small dish of what was lo mein, badly cooked chicken, and pork buns that practically defined mediocre.

It may have ruined our evening, but don't let it ruin yours.  Please avoid this place, and find any other establishment.  ANY OTHER PLACE.  This is a waste of your time, money, and honestly, is a blackmark on a pretty great hotel.   But hey, at least they have pretty fish.",XsAAMiC4ccNNZtP9EiVG_A,0,0,1,kUlDZjeRt-wlRO3RVQ-nhw

Furthermore, even if you don't care that you are supporting a business that practices the endearing of animal species, then you should care that the food sucks. 

I came here with a group and only after ordering and eating did I notice the ""soup special."" So my 1star review of the food part was for before I knew of their soup. If I could give a negative rating--- I would. 

The food was tasteless and I ordered their famous noodles, which there is only a small selection of actual noodle plates, ironic for a restaurant with ""noodle"" in the name. 

I tried many dishes from the large group order and wasn't impressed with any of them. When the bill came, the experience left an even worse taste in our mouths as we realized that they charged $4 for each dinky bowl of rice that was brought to the table...rice that we didn't ask for. 

The prices were crazy EXPENSIVE even for Las Vegas! I mean at least in Vegas if you buy food and it costs a lot you get a huge serving---not here! Servings were small to medium at most.

Oh and the service was horrible. One entree didn't show up until 15+ minutes after the rest of them. Three of us also had to leave for a show as we waited for the bill to arrive. About 15 minutes later 2 more people had to leave--- leaving 2 people to wait at the table for the bill or the waiter to come by. By the time the waiter got to the table, our group of 7 people was down to only 2 people and he hadn't noticed the mass exodus that had left the table! So, maybe 30 minutes later the bill arrived. 

The only good things were the dumplings and the lychee martini, but nothing special as I have had similar quality many times over. 

My advice...Take a pretty photo of the restaurant and their goldfish aquarium and move on..Go somewhere else, anywhere!

218575,2013-06-12,0,U9aA5H13y7t9xWnoQslV0Q,"First and foremost ,you have to understand that you're eating Chinese food at a casino. If you can grasp that then your dining experience expectations will be dramatically different(meaning you have to  lower your standards; it's equivalent to a weekend of heavy drinking if you were single and you're looking to settle for the night minus the walk of shame in the morning). We dined here solely because my friend (the groom) really wanted his fix of noodles and wonton. 

For those that are accustomed to a lower price point for similar food back home, they will most likely get a nice wake up call since the price point for the menu here is significantly higher (again you have to grasp the realization that you're dining at a casino). We ordered  the wonton, egg noodle soup; beef stew noodles; and the xiao long baos (soup dumplings). The wontons were suprisingly flavorful, the xiao long baos were decent although the texture of the dumpling skin was on the soggy side, and the beef stew would probably be the best dish we had. But for obvious reasons it's not food that I would wait on line for or anything.

As mentioned in the previous paragraph, the food wasn't the best, but when you're fiending for some Chinese food and you're in the middle of the desert, expect to pay a higher price point to somewhat get that fix. However, a full satisfaction of what you're yearning for may not be fully met. Nonetheless, it may just help hold you over till you head back to you respective go to Chinese place back home. It could be worse, what if there was only a P.F. Chang's or only  mall type of a take out that was around?

I have to say that the restaurant in fact is expensive, but nothing completely ridiculous as my husband and I have eaten in restaurants in Santa Barbara with less food and less taste.

I am a pescetarian, so I ordered the sweet and sour fish, the fish filet with black been sauce and the white egg and shrimp fried rice, tea, and white rice (about $90)... needles to say, it was very good, and the fish was very fresh. So, my mom and I came back a second time for lunch.

My mom had the soup, same white eggs and shrimp fried rice and I had the Thai style noodle sea food (which is suppose to be just seafood and curry sauce)... when they brought the noodle it had pork! But they were nice to give us a plate without pork... it took a while, so we ended up taking it to go.

Recommended by my sister...I've never seen hand tossed noodles before. I videoed it...it's that impressive and great to see a tradition carried on.

We had...
Sauce Noodles: XO Hand Pull Noodles
Sauce Noodles: Beijing Zha Jiang Hand Pull Noodles
Pork and Chives Dumplings
BBQ Platter (Roast Duck, BBQ Pork, Cold Poached Chicken)
Stir Fried Vegetablles (Asparagus, Bok Choy, Chinese Broccoli)

The XO Noodles are spicy and made with XO (dried scallops, dried shrimp)...so if you don't love that idea, you may not love this uber Chinese dish. Though, 3/5 loved it...including me.

The poached chicken is cold...but with a hainan chicken flavor. I love hainan chicken...but if you don't like cold chicken, this may not be for you.

Everything else...EVERYTHING else...was universally LOVED by our diverse group (from LA, San Diego, Dallas, St. Louis).  The service was great. The decor was clean and modern. And the noodle pulling...amazing to watch.

355115,2015-10-06,0,U9aA5H13y7t9xWnoQslV0Q,"The service here is absolutely awful. Our party of five was told a 30 minute wait and at the 30 minute mark we could literally see them clean and reset our table from where we were standing. But it took an additional 15 minutes for them to seat us, simply because no one bothered to come get us where we stood watching the chef hand pull noodles in the front of the restaurant. There was no hostess at the front podium monitoring the situation. 

Finally seated, it took 10-15 minutes for them to fill our water glasses and take our order. They were busy-ish, so I understood to some extent. When our orders were taken, it took them about 35 minutes to check in on us again, and only then because the chef was dropping off three of our dishes from the noodle kitchen. We waited about 15 more minutes for our waitress to come back to our table with my friend's spicy chicken dish. We requested that she check on the last few dishes we were waiting on.... A curry and the dim sum that we ordered as APPETIZERS. She disappeared for 10 minutes and only came back to our table because I called out for her attention from where she loitered by the cash register. As someone who prides herself on her manners and tact, I found it extremely embarrassing that I had to go to this length to get her attention.

At this point we asked for the manager and explained why. Our waters had been empty for almost an hour. Four of us had been served entrees while the fifth waited and waited. Our appetizers never showed up. And we were never offered an apology or an explanation. The manager came over and made a laundry list of excuses. He explained that they have two kitchens... That it's hard to coordinate the dishes to come out simultaneously... That the dumplings needed time to steam... That the curry is made from scratch... All of this until I politely told him that I am an amateur home chef but I can produce a chicken curry from scratch in 30 minutes. His professional chefs should be able to do it in that time or less. 

He disappeared and then returned 5 minutes later with my friend's curry. Soon thereafter our waitress brought out the dim sum we'd ordered over an hour ago as appetizers. The manager kindly comped the food that was so late... Which was nice, but an apology from the get go would have been FAR more appreciated than the song and dance of excuses and blame he served us to begin with. He finally apologized when I pointed this out. We never got an apology from our server. 

The entire service experience was a complete and total failure. 

On the plus side, the hand pulled noodles with chicken and mushrooms were excellent, as were the BBQ buns and the spicy chicken dish (not sure of the name). 

The dumplings and the curry were bland and unseasoned. 

My one star is totally and completely for the quality of the authentic noodle dishes. Nothing else. We will not return and we will advise others not to waste their time or patience here.

He finished eating the soup, and then we sat and waited for everyone else's food to come out. Portions were small, no one in my family came out full. Also rice is not included on entrees? 

And the crab fiasco. My mom wanted to get the crab but we wanted to check the market price. We asked the same waiter and everyone at the table all heard $16.99. When we got the bill it was $59.99. To be fair there was a possibility that we heard the waiter wrong (plus he had an accent), but I doubt it. Looking back I was more shocked than upset, but the crab price was just a ""nice"" topping to a bad dinner and service. We felt we were deceived and now this mediocre dinner was definitely not worth it. I talked to the manager and she was quite understanding and took off some of the price of the crab.

The garlic and cucumbers dish was refreshing - though one can't really mess this dish up.

Lan Zhou Hand Pulled Noodles was delicious. Tender beef and 

Big plus is that you can order dimsum items any time! (The pork buns were really good - so good I doggie bagged the rest for the plane ride home.)

Service was nice. Majority of the people were courteous and polite.  They say the wait is long (which is true) - though I'm not 100%s  sure as to why - but I suppose it is to make sure the kitchen can get the food out as fast as people order.

I started with some pickeled wood ear mushrooms being a mushroom lover this salad was a good changes of pace to what is considered the norm. We shared a beef noodel soup witch was also great my son kept slurping up the hand made noodels.Witch you can watch the man make in the window to order along with the shu-mi. witch was as good as if you were in China town.

My friend and I bought a groupon for $35 that was good for $50, so we decided to use it for dinner. The prices are high; it's vegas, you should expect that if you're eating on the strip that it will be expensive. 

Our waiter Chung was super helpful and attentive. Sometimes waitstaff treat you shitty when you have a groupon,  but he was happy to explain to us how it worked. 

We ordered
Steamed bbq pork buns: amazing. Sweet pork with hints of cinnamon in the bbq sauce. Three come in an order, but it's really not enough because they're so damn good.
Combo chow mein: pretty basic chow mein with chicken and beef. Freshly wok'd so the veggies were tender by still had a nice snap to them. A little under seasoned for my taste.
Mixed Bbq platter: normally it will come with duck, bbq pork, and poached chicken but Chung told us that the chicken is served cold. Most people are unaccustomed to it, so he recommended that we substituted it for more duck and pork. Such a great tip. The pork was great and the duck was a little too salty, but they complimented each other nicely.
Oolong tea: they charge per person for the hot tea, so be aware.

1. Overpriced 
But this is Caesars Palace after all. So just go knowing that. 18 dollars averagely per plate. 

2. Food was very American Chinese. Not at all authentic.

I had a hand pulled brisket noodle. The noodles were fresh but not very spongy and a bit flat and too thick. The soup was lacking in stock and had a layer of oil on top that was unnecessary and just made the dish oily and not tasty in the right way. But I will say that the beef brisket itself was tender enough.

I also had the Pork Soup Dumpling which was decent. The Pork inside was flavourful but the Dumpling itself was too thick and lacked sophistication. 

The environment is pleasing - contemporary looking and with goldfish aquariums inside. 

3. Service 
Is not great. It's alright. But not great. We had finished our meals for 15 mins already and no one came to get out plates.

I'm giving this 1 star for the decor and the beef brisket itself.",otAKKvNEwzsoKG8AKBp_Jw,1,0,1,l4J1b4yGzzfyzjY2fJzt_g

Today I'm trying again since it was sitting in my draft inbox. This place is overrated. I should of stick to Spring Mt Road if I wanted real authentic hot pot aka shabu shabu soup.

I wanted soup so I figured I check out Groupon of there were good deals or recommendation. Long behold this popped up. Pretty decent, value at $50 for $25. Deal! Being that it's hidden in Ceasars palace it might be good right?

Walked in, took us a few minutes to find it. Don't get wrong the place is beautiful! Tanks of gold fishes all around. So we sat down, dinner time, wasn't that busy. So I attempted to order this hot pot meat (Beef, comes with cabbage, tofu, enoki mushrooms, spinach, hand pull noodle and clear noodle.) At first the waiter advise me he was sorry, apparently you need to rsvp that since it takes the cook longer to prep it then later nicely said we will do it for you. The soup came out scorching hot! Had the meats, veggies and super red broth. Really it's the way I like it. I put in the meat for it to cook then the veggies and here I go scooping it into the little bowl. Oh my!! The flavor! What the heck is this??? There's no flavor and super oily not to mention it's plain for the Sichuan Style which is their hottest broth. Basically paid $50 extra on top of what I paid for Groupon total of $120! Hmmm should have ate elsewhere for that much. Tired it once....no thank you. 

I do have photos of the place but that was back 2015. The place looks stunning but as for the food. It's not that good (only speaking of the soup I had). Came out unsatisfied for $120 meal.

The reason I'm giving this restaurant 2 stars is because of the food and service. 

Service was mediocre and not friendly. The waiter was actually kind of rude. When my bf asked him a question about a food ingredient, he gave him a wise ass answer with some attitude, zero smile and was abrupt. (Minus 1 star)

LOUD. Must everyone yell in here?! My bf and I werent, the 2 couples sitting next to us werent, but why did it sound like everyone else in the restaurant was yelling? The yelling was actually the first thing we noticed when we arrived.   So bizarre. (Minus 1 star)

The food..  small portions for ridiculous prices. We had the:

Beijing Style Zha Jiang Mein: 18.09 (DO NOT ORDER THIS. I love Zha Jiang Mein, and was so excited to try theirs....but this was absolutely the worst I've ever had. It was like eating dark brown/black salt paste. Small bowl with a few tiny pieces of pork. I will eat  just about anything when it comes to food, but this was actually inedible.  We just ended up leaving it on the table after tasting it. ) (Minus 1 star.)

Beef Chow Fun 16.09 (This was ok. Tiny tiny portion of meat, like 3 small slices of beef on top a little bed of chow fun. Nothing special)

Pork and Chives Dumplings (6 pices) 11.09 (This was decent, but about as good as the ones I buy from Trader Joes and microwave for 3-4 minutes. It comes with a sauce that tastes like soy sauce, vinegar and ginger. Nothing special)

Sauteed Seasonal Vegetables (Chinese Broccoli) 15.09 (This was probably the only thing I liked, but where where all the tops of the broccoli? They gave us mostly stems! There were about 3 small broccoli tops and a handful of stems.)

Total $60.63 + 4.17 tax and 9.00 tip= $75.17 

For those of you who think people here are just complaining about the prices, I think you are missing the point. FOR WHAT YOU GET... the prices are ridiculous. (Minus 1 star)  Just because a restaurant charges a lot of money doesnt make it a great restaurant. Great restaurants have great food that you would want to eat again regardless of price. 

One good thing about this restaurant is that it is extremely clean. The fish tank, chairs, tables and floors are spotless. +1 star.

My friend (non-asian, but a foodie) said that he orders the pepper shrimp and the lobster. He says they are excellent. Maybe I just ordered the wrong items.. Until next time I guess... But for now I can only give this place 2 stars..

(btw... I am Asian and I DO know what good Chinese food is... and SF and SGV have restaurants that have wayyyyyy better authentic Chinese food than this place.)",dzHMKxZy7oe8mtudWEJAvA,1,0,2,xdGVU0mfQbmKNObjxszVhA

We ordered the Vegetarian Spring Roll appetizer.  It tasted fine.  Nothing special.  She really liked the sauce. 

I ordered the Seafood Noodle Soup.  I originally wanted it with Egg Noodles, but that was not made in-house, so I opted for the Knife Shredded Noodles.  The soup had 3 perfectly cooked huge shrimps, 3 scallops, and some Chinese broccoli.  The broth was light.  The bowl was not that big, but was filling.  The hand made noodles were fatter and denser than I normally prefer  Overall, it was a decent dish.

My friend ordered the Beef Chow Fun.  Even though the noodles were not made there, the dish was so good!  They made it exactly the way I like it....Cantonese style (dry).

Dan dan mein in Chinese roughly means mouth full of noodles. It was pretty much a bowl of noodles with some ground beef sprinkled on top. Underneath the noodles is a small pool of spicy chilli oil. Then you mix and toss the noodles to apply the sauce to the noodle. All in all the dish wasn't bad. The noodle tasted very fresh and the texture was springy and soft. Unfortunately most Dan Dan Meins I've had actually had more to offer than just noodle. The mix the noodle yourself concept is forgivable. It also makes you realize that before you mixed the noodles. The dish consisted strictly of plain noodles.

All in all not bad. Will barely hold you over. Like two bites of a hot dog, but oh well. Sometimes you have no option on where you eat (long story).

Pineapple fried rice (2/3)
Ham, shrimp, rice, and eggs. The pineapple was added like an afterthought,  even then I might've had 3 tiny pieces of pineapple in the whole plate.

1057541,2016-01-07,2,U9aA5H13y7t9xWnoQslV0Q,"After glancing at the ratings for Beijing Noodle Company No. 9 (BNC) it seems like writing this review is tantamount to ""piling on"". But write it I must. We've been to BNC many times (don't ask), so I feel qualified to talk about the food and service at this establishment.

In total, if you are staying at Caesar's and need a solid place to eat, BNC is a good option. But this is not a place to travel to if you have transportation and options. There are just too many quality noodle experiences to be had in this town. 

DECOR
The look of the place is captivating. It's worth stopping by to look at the design and creative use of color and space. The walls in the entire space are covered in white ""lace-like"" designs layered over lights and a flat white wall. The layering effect makes a relatively small space look and feel much larger than it is--there is an expansive feel that smaller spaces in casinos could only wish to have.  Even the low ceilings are covered in the deceptively inviting lace-like netting. In addition, the huge fishbowl entry way and glassed in noddle-making area add to an expansive and welcoming feel to the entire space.  

Over the years, they have failed to keep the place clean and tidy. If you glance at the floorboards and fixtures, the scuffing, layers of dust, and disrepair are all too apparent. And this beautiful minimalist/ornate design requires that it be kept in prestige condition. So even though the décor and design are a showpiece, there seems to be little concern with maintaining their appeal. 

SERVICE 
The service was solid on our last visit. We've had varying levels of service, but that is true of any location.  On a bad night, the service will be spotty: we've seen them get very busy and been forgotten by the wait staff. Even on good nights, there will be a bit of a wait for drink refills, but even then the food always comes out hot. 

FOOD
Sadly, it's bland. On our last visit, we ordered: shrimp dumplings, steamed pork buns, green onion pancakes, Beijing Zha Jiang with Hand Pull Noodle, General Tso's Chicken (sigh), and Ma Po Tofu. The seasoning was an issue for the two dishes I was most looking forward to:  the Beijing Zha Jiang and the tofu. Both were just bland. I would say that they were crafted to appeal to an American pallet, but I have an American palette and I was craving flavor. Salt and sweet dominated the chicken dish and the pork buns and pancakes were unnecessarily mild. The hand-pulled noodles are always fantastic, but unfortunately they do not save the dishes at BNC.  

SUMMARY
There is a promise and illusion of beauty that is never quite fulfilled. From the design to the food, BNC has the potential to be something greater than it is. I just don't think it is interested in the challenge.",2k8OVAPxlXHsA5X6EIoQpQ,7,3,2,COT2mehPDe_z676sWUJNcg

1075990,2017-08-16,0,U9aA5H13y7t9xWnoQslV0Q,"I visited this restaurant last time in 2015 and gave low rating then. Two days ago while we stayed at Caesars Palace, my friend insisted to have some to-go order of Chinese food within the hotel despite my objection. So, we went.

We ordered a BBQ Platter ($29.99), a Pork Ribs in Sweet Vinegar Sauce ($19.99), and one order of custard bun - Egg Yolk Quicksand as they called it ($6.99). In total, we paid over $60 for these three items. 

I was astonished to see the BBB Platter when we got back to the room and opened the box. This platter was about half the size of the same dish I ordered once there two years ago. In the combination platter, there were three kinds of meat - 4 very small pieces of Poached chicken, 4 very small pieces of Roast Duck and BBB Pork. I almost couldn't believe they were serving so few pieces of so tiny size at such quite high price. As to the BBB Pork, it was chopped (not slicked) into pieces about 5 times thicker than normal sliced BBQ Pork served at most other restaurants. Their poor and tacky knife cut made the BBQ Pork look as dull as a portion of pig's frozen dead body, totally unappetizing and iffy. I was wondering how they could charge $30 for a small box of food with quality level lower than that of a food court vendor. 

I must give a low rating to this restaurant again. I am a Chinese and I know how good Chinese food should look and should be prepared. They still don't think they should upgrade, instead they shrink the portion and size of the food and raise the prices with no business ethics at all. Doesn't Caesars Palace feel ashamed to allow such a low-end place sitting there to fool and rip off non-Chinese tourists and suckers?

After this bad experience, I checked again their recent ratings on Yelp and found they've got more and more poor ratings. They deserve for what they are doing, and I believe if they continue doing so, they won't stay there too long.",H4UHK4Z9kTHbMFOU-xzkpg,0,0,1,alqObKqzmzj5zF0aZllZ-Q

Price is very cheap especially for a restaurant in Caesar's... A good snack or quick carb boost to get you back to the tables :)",0Hav88qcoWli8fye-AI3LA,0,0,5,icMnTYEZ0t7pAJ_X7zRztw

I was really hungry and on a Sunday afternoon at Ceasers Palace food options are a bit limited because most restaurants close for the afternoon and reopen in the evening. 

So I arrived and the hostess lady said all the tables are full and that I had to wait 10-20 minutes.  She then gave me one of those vibrating alarm things that would go off when a table becomes available and she was like, ""Make sure you stay within 10 ft, so we can reach you.""  Not sure what the whole point of the alarm is if you can't walk father than 10 feet from the restaurant....

Anyways, finally, after about 30 minutes of standing right next to the hostess, the alarm goes off and she guides me to a table in a clearly and completely EMPTY restaurant. I was a bit thrown off because it's just not nice to be lied to and certainly not nice to be kept waiting for no apparent reason.

By the time I sit down, I'm completely famished and order 2 dishes, one noodle broth and another scallops over noodles.  This is when the most ridiculous part happens...the food didn't come for another 45 minutes!  I'm not sure why it takes so long to make noodles in a completely empty restaurant.  Knowing that food options were a bit limited at the Caesars palace on a Sunday afternoon, I had no choice but to just sit there and wait.

While waiting, I ordered a coke and no...it didn't come immediately, but after another 10 minutes.  When the waitress brought me the coke, it was a can and straw, and I had to ask her for a glass so I can pour it in. 

When the food came, the ""hot"" noodles were cold (which is not surprising considering the 45 minute wait), and the ""scallops"" were falling apart and in pieces.  I had always thought scallops are in round cylindrical shapes.  Not at this restaurant!  The minute you touch them, they fell apart, which was a bit disappointing but understandable as long as they taste good. 

Unfortunately, they did not taste good.  In fact, they tasted a bit foul...and let's just say I was a bit sick for the rest of the day and could barely leave my hotel room.  

Two noodle dishes and a coke, came to about $50-$60....and all this waiting just so I can spent an entire afternoon and evening food sick in my hotel room bathroom.

We ordered two dishes: first, ""crispy chicken with hot sauce"", $19, well, what I got was one piece of breaded & fried chicken breast on a plate (no sauces, no veggies) and one cup of dipping sauce that was mildly hot, if you excuse the oxymoron.  I wouldn't consider that prepared food.

The second dish was a pork dish with cilantro (also in the neighborhood of $20).  The pork this time was cooked with some sauce and sprinkled with cilantro stems.  Out of curiosity, I asked why stems, and what do they do with the leaves.  The answer I got was that ""it's Beijing style, we throw away the cilantro leaves"".  Pretty good comeback I have to say, but it doesn't make up for the fact that the food was plain bad.

So, we moseyed over next door because my hungry stomach could not handle driving elsewhere.  Walking into Beijing Noodle No. 9, I felt that something was not quite right.  The hostesses were super nice, servers had the efficiency of a Chinese restaurant BUT with a kind smile.  Staff were all milling around at what seemed like a very well oiled machine.  What?  You'll bring my dessert promptly after we're finished with the main meal?  What?  You offered my husband another beer?  (He was so shocked that he did not accept his usual second beer.)  The interior was not only clean, but it was also bright and incredibly well designed.  Drawers were professionally labeled.  No, we were not in a Chinese restaurant, but we were in the surely in the twilight zone.

I have a theory there is an inverse relationship (not sure if linear or exponential) between Americanization of the restaurant (so that includes service, decor, cleanliness) and the tastiness of the food.  The cleaner, the prettier the decor and the more ept or polite the staff is, the less tasty the food probably is.  The opposite would be the dirtier, the uglier the decor, the more the staff barks at you, the increasingly tasty the food is.  

Where does Beijing Noodle No. 9 fall?

Watching the chef hard at work hand stretching the noodles, I was hopeful for perfectly chewy al dente noodles.  It was amazing watching the entire process.  Boing... Stretch Twirl... Boing... Stretch Twirl.  

Food:
* The hand stretched noodles lacked the chew like the well developed gluten that would be in perfect noodles.  Sad face.
1.  Sichuan Dan Dan Mian - Let's talk about the sauce.  It was nice and spicy and a touch on the salty side.
2.  Braised Beef Brisket and Tendon Noodle Soup with hand stretched noodles - Perhaps my cantonese self is used to really robust flavors, but this soup somehow lacked some depth.  Braised usually means tender meat, but the chunks of brisket were decidedly chewy.  Overall, it was good but not the best.
3.  Choy Sum - Great wok hei and seasoning, but the portion size was pitiful.  
4.  Xiao Long Bao (XLB/Soup Dumplings) - Very juicy and soupy - the soup filled the entire soup spoon!  Where they did not quite reach XLB nirvana was in the dumpling skin.  It was not as thin and membranous as the famous Din Tai Fung's.
5.  Sweet Red Bean Buns (mei gui dou sha bao) - Two out of the three were delicious.  The bun was fluffy and not dry, and the inside was filled with smooth and sweet red bean paste.  The third bun opened up to dry and crusty red bean.  Pleh!

Prices:  Outrageous!  I would say each dish was two to three times the price that we were used to.  I'll chalk it up to the fact that the place is located in casino, and being that it was so ""swanky"" in decor and with well-trained staff, they needed to mark dishes up for the cost of running the place.  On a side thought - perhaps, we've all been spoiled by rock bottom prices at other Chinese restaurants and like how Korean and Japanese food is pricier, Chinese food should be priced similarly?  

Conclusion:  So the inverse relationship is true in this case.  It was swanky; the food was average.  For average food that I can get cheaper and tastier elsewhere (i.e. Yi Mei Deli), I probably don't recommend coming back.

The interior definitely stands out in Caesars. It's very... shiny. It's kind've tucked away in a corner. I didn't even notice it the first time I walked by until my girlfriend mentioned it to me.

Service:
We arrived just as it was opening for lunch - we were the second group to arrive and waited maybe a minute to be seated. With it being the beginning of the shift I'm assuming there was some confusion as to who's table we were as we saw 3 different servers during our lunch.

However various servers didn't slow down us getting our drinks or our orders.

Our actual server was extremely helpful with our selection.

Food:
I saw a few comments about it being very ""Americanized"" but I would imagine that depends on the dish. We ordered mostly appetizers we were familiar with from our adventures with Dim Sum and it was comparable... at least to the various dim sum options around Atlanta.

The only thing that really stood out for me were the Soup Dumplings - both variations.

The stir fried veggies were just okay.

Everything else we ordered was rather subpar for the price. Including the pork ribs, fried rice, and chow mein.

Having never had them before I thought these things were amazing!

We questioned the waiter about this and were told that was the Chinese preparation.

Their dishes come down to a few options:
- beef
- pork
- soup
- rice
- noodles

I got the Dan Dan noodles with spring noodles and an order of six pan-seared pot stickers.  I got the wife the Shanghai-style wonton with shrimp and egg noodles.

Dan Dan noodles looked a bit light on sauce but it turned out to be a good ratio since it had some serious kick.  Very good noodles - round, smooth, and slightly chewy.  Pot Stickers were excellent - worth the 15 mins prep time since they were golf-ball sized with a single edge that was perfectly seared. The skin around the seared edge was soft, but it held the juicy pork-cabbage filling perfectly.  The dark sauce also had a nice spicy kick.

I  only took a nibble from my wife's dish and it was OK.  Definitely lighter mellow broth characteristic of Cantonese style.  The prawns and wontons in her bowl were huge!

The white interior and mosaic decor is stunning and mesmerizing, with the feeling of an upscale techno club melded with a spaceship cafeteria. Absolutely genius and unique for a Chinese restaurant! Service was friendly, but messed up one of our orders. Our friend had to wait 10 additional minutes for her corrected order while we were slurping our noodles. 

I had the BBQ pork noodle soup which was delicious, stock was fresh and clear, meat was tender and flavorful. The noodles were cooked to an over al dente firmness but went down well together with the pork slices. The serving size was perfect for me and satisfied my hunger without that bloating or fullness sensation.

Before moving to Nevada it was always the first place we would go when visiting. And now it is the first place we take visitors when they are passing through.

My favorites: Either the hand pulled noodles or the Knife cut ones. They are both amazing and different in their own right. I love the eggplant sauce and the pork & mushroom sauce. 

On this last visit the server (Tommy) (AMAZING) offered a sampling of all sauces and those two continued to be my favorites.

My husband always orders the shrimp dumplings and the pork dumplings. And I love the bbq pork buns. All three cooked to perfection each time. 

Another favorite is the beef fried rice. Very delicate flavors all popping in your mouth. 

The soup dumplings are a must, but be warned, they are difficult to eat at first try! 

Drink wise it is always the lychee martini. And/or the iced coffee. Depending on who's driving! 

This last trip we tried the mochi. Loved them! My favorite flavors were red bean, mango and chocolate. And I always save room for an almond cookie. I think the flaky buttery cookie is the best way to end a fabulous night of food.",kEi9IImtSsz2Kg2x5bfucQ,1,1,5,hjoTFiCfGkkB8KxLmEXlag

Wish I had checked Yelp before eating here.

The place is kinda neat looking - bunch of little goldfish, some of which swim upside down (for fun??)

Food is terrible.  Don't be fooled by the cheong-sam dressed Asians they have at the front.  Actually, that should have been a warning sign.  It being a ""Chinese restaurant"" in Caesar's should have been warning enough.

The place advertises itself as ""authentic"" hand-pulled noodles.

Yes, it's noodles.  And NO, it ain't authentic.

Supposedly their ""best-seller"" was the hand pulled noodles with shrimp/pork wontons.  

The noodles were the WORST I have had in a long time.  Soggy, sad, thin little things with no texture.  Wontons were nothing to write home about.  Soup was on par with Cup O Noodles broth.  A relatively small bowl of -- blah -- for:

                                        ****   $17.00  ****

It really gives it a clean crisp look, which I really liked.  I made reservations under Open Table (which wasn't really necessary cuz there isn't a crazy line) but you get 100 points.

We were seated immediately eventhough we were fashionably late (which is like totally common in Las Vegas... right?).

Our server comes and she talks really fast and really doesn't give me a chance to ask about their menu.  She just wanted me to order like NOW.  So I hate feeling rushed... I ask her to give her few minutes.

We ordered the pork chives fried dumpling and their combination chow mein which is their hand stretched noodles.  It took awhile, but when we got our food, the beef was clearly uncooked, which red and pinkness to it.  And because combination has pork, beef and chicken, we showed her and she apologized and took it back and brought it back fully cooked.  The pork chives fried dumplings were quite yummy and the chow mein was pretty good, but not like I was blown away good.

They have different pricing for ""Total Rewards"" members.  I'm sure if you are looking up this review, you are in Vegas and you know what I'm talking about.  If you don't, go make yourself a players club card.

Are you serious?!?! In china town you can get 3 for 2 bucks! Serving size is definitely not like your normal Chinese restaurant. Therefore I suggest getting your own plate.

Service here sucks, and some waitresses speak very little English. 

The food comes out as it's cooked, so someone in your party might get their food last when everyone else is done with theirs. Not good!!!! You also have to be quick and attentive to them if and when they come around, otherwise they will take your plates away when your not even done!

Mini Wontons = Wonton wrapper. -_________- wtc. All this craziness. I literally had doughy wrapper in soup for lunch. I mean their soup is light and flavorful but it tasted like misc. powder made soup. It was also extremely salty.

The Lai Mien (hand pulled noodles) wasn't bad, but after awhile it tastes redundant. It's a little bit on the chewy side for me too. There was a tiny piece of beef that came with my soup noodle, it was saddening.

I absolutely had nothing for the spicy cold noodles.

Their portions might look tiny but it's actually a pretty hefty serving. So do keep that in mind when you see the price.

The restaurant is staffed with native Chinese servers and presumably cooks. Our server was rather disinterested and standoffish...I imagine it is because she was embarrassed to be associated with such a place and the blatant cash grab that it is. 

I have to admit we did not hit it at peak time...it was about 3:30 pm and the place was mostly empty. However, we had just checked in after a tiring day of travel, so at least it was conveniently in the hotel. We also did not get any noodles, though they were being stretched in front of us...I wish we did. The little one usually likes congee, so we chose the congee with century egg and pork ($15!!). Now, I absolutely cannot resist XLB anytime I see them on a menu (even though they are Shanghainese in origin and this was presumably a Beijing restaurant...they also had DanDan noodles, a Szechuan treat. We got the regular pork XLB ($14!) and seafood/pork XLB ($14!). We finished the ordering with some Shiu Mai ($12!), and a $5 diet coke!!! OK, so I thought the prices were rather high (understatement). But I felt the same way at Yank Sing in SF, but at least the food was really good and I didn't feel robbed.

The congee was made from water, not broth, bits of century egg, and a smattering of pork strips. There was nary any salt nor any seasonings of any sort. As a result, it was devoid of any flavor (surprise, surprise). $15 for raw ingredients totalling 25 cents. Both varieties of XLB were off as well...though they both had ample soup, the skins were very tough and discolored a dark hue, as if they had been sitting out awhile. The filling was surprising tough and chewy as well. The four shiu mai were fine, though at $3 a pop, you'd think they had foie gras or truffles in them. Really, nothing different from the 50 to 75 cent version you'd find in any Chinatown. However, the meal was salvaged by the best diet coke I'd ever had, definitely a bargain at $5. Did you catch the sarcasm there? 'cause I was laying it on pretty thick.

So, the total damage for a very mediocre (actually, the food was aspiring to become mediocre) meal was just about $75(!!!). Really, no kidding. Pretty incredible. Run as fast as you can away from this place.",cHZhssS9U7FXOsxUDISNVQ,6,1,1,gmhmgeT8QI0K8dNrK1sk2w

I like the fact that you can watch them hand pull noodles towards the front of the restaurant by the entrance. They also have several fish tanks that adds a splash of vibrant color from the otherwise contrasting white decor.

The food is freshly prepared, but overpriced compared to your typical Chinese restaurant, but what isn't in Vegas? 

They have a rather extensive menu to entice just about anyone. 
-Lead by Executive Chef Li Yu. -Attire is casual. -Average price of an entree is approximately $25. 

These are the following dishes I've ordered at Beijing Noodle No.9: (2 adults, 2 children) Ordered far too much. Our eyes are bigger than our stomachs..evidently.

-Special Seafood Soup (one size) $113.99/ individual bowl. (The flavors were very ""clean"", but too bland in my opinion.)

-Braised Sea Bass in a sizzling clay pot $23.99 

-Walnut Prawns in Mayo Sauce $20.99 (I actually really enjoyed this dish, the prawns were huge, fried to perfection, and absolutely succulent.) 

-Beef Chow Fun $16.99

-Braised Beef Brisket & Tendon Noodle Soup $16.99 (you can choose what kind of noodle to have it with. I opted for the more traditional choice for this dish; hand pulled/ stretched noodles.)

-War Wonton Noodle Soup $16.99 (This was a very ordinary dish that I wouldn't order again.)

-Green Onion Pancake $7.99 (I requested for it to be extra crispy which was delightful.)

-Xiao Long Bao, Soup Dumplings Pork (6 pieces) $12.99 (I definitely prefer Din Tai Fung's XLB) 

-Pork and Chives Dumplings (Boiled or Pan-Fried, 6 pcs.) $10.99 

-Shrimp and Chives Dumplings (Boiled or Pan-Fried, 6 pcs.) $12.99 (I opted for Pan Fried for both orders.) 

-Seafood & Egg White Fried Rice $16.99 (Ordered this in lieu of white rice, it complemented the other dishes very well)

-Seasonal Mushrooms w. Black Pepper Sauce $15.99 (I was quite disappointed when this came out with mainly white mushroom.) 

-Pea Leaves w. Golden Garlic $19.99 (Paired well with the fried rice mentioned above.) 

-4 Thai Iced Teas $6.99 each, we added boba (bubble, pearls etc.) but I forget how much extra they charged. 

-Sichuan Dan Dan Mien $15.99 (I believe we ordered this with the knife-shredded noodles to change it up a bit.) 

-Beijing Pancake Wrap with Cilantro (1) (Beef or Honey BBQ Pork) $8.99 (We opted for Beef, and if I remember correctly we all enjoyed it.)

I know I'm missing a few dishes, but I think it's safe to say that I pretty much ordered something from each section/ category on the menu. We ate ""family style"" and shared so everyone gets more choices, making this review easier. The food portions were fair, the food didn't taste bad, but it was more Americanized to be completely honest. I can see why the reviews for this restaurant is all over the place; it is overpriced, and didn't taste necessarily ""authentic"". 

Service wise: We were seated quickly, and the servers were friendly and attentive. 

Overall, it's a nice concept, but not a restaurant I'd ever crave. I do agree with other reviews that it's overpriced, but again, we are talking about Vegas. Everything is overpriced in Vegas.. maybe we're paying for the experience. Will I return, possibly, but it wouldn't be my choice. I'd go if someone else wanted to eat there. Personally, I'd rather eat at Bacchanal Buffet next door because there's definitely something for everyone, at one set price.",R91LrmixqW-vICV5vq2SGA,3,2,3,7tGtd0SgLohSaY9Uo5Bvbw

+ Jimmy our waiter was cordial and funny. He helped the lost ones at our table to make their decisions.  His recommendations satisfied us.
+ Service is quick. We ordered, ate, paid and left all at a reasonable pace.
+ Decor is fanciful. Think modern white but lots of curly Qs and glass tanks of goldfish swirling everywhere around you. It's dizzying but fantastical!

- Forget the dimsum or sides. The prices first of all are ridiculous.
- Again a minus is that the prices were high in general!

BBQ pork was around 17.99 for 8 slices. Expensive, but it was delicious!! 

Kung Pao was about 16.99 a pretty decent amount of food for two people. But we didn't like it at all. It wasn't spicy to us, but they use way too much ginger. I felt like I was eating ginger chicken. I would not order again.

Beef Chow Fun..I don't remember price, but it was plenty to feed the two of us. It didn't have much flavor. The beef was bland, but not dry. The noodles didn't have much flavor. Sadly we had to add some soy sauce to give it some more flavor.

We ordered one side of rice 3.99

The water glass I got was dirty. I'm sure it went through the dishwasher, but the pervious drink must have left a dark residue. It looked like it just needed to be popped back in the dish washer, I don't think anyone deliberately gave me a used dirty glass.

I was much more interested in the Dim Sum. Beijing Noodle doesn't have the cart service that makes Dim Sum more of an experience than a meal, but I was happy enough to just order my favorite dishes.  It is Vegas priced (expensive), and slow (because they are making the dishes to order) so minus a star there.

The scallion pancake was crispy and hot with lots of scallion flavor.
I love anything with the pink, sweet, bbq pork filling - the steamed buns and the flaky baked pastry were both good.
They offer steamed or pan fried dumplings with various fillings. Just be careful that they are giving you what you ordered - the servers kept giving my dumplings to the table next to me and vice versa (minus a star for that).  The steamed dumpling were kind of soggy, but the pan fried were quite good.

Make sure to take some time to watch the noodles being made by hand at the little window in the front of the shop - it's quite a show.

I also loved that they had Thai iced tea and coffee - brewed strong and mixed with sweetened condensed milk - one of my favorite drinks ever since those late nights out in college. And I loved the eye-catching design of the place, with its stark white patterned walls, and huge fishtanks - really different, and really cool.",20eY1PQ--P5GZKG1u_JIQQ,0,0,3,95GF_7QYS7TviKbtnW80DA

The restaurant features very extensive selection of traditional Chinese dishes, including large selection of noodles-based dishes. When you order food, you get a choice of using pre-made noodles, or asking for the noodles freshly made right in front of your eyes - similar bad experience as traditional sushi restaurant. I had seafood noodle soup  Shangai style, and it was delicious - perfect amount of spice, not too salty, flavorful broth, honest amound of seafood with fresh shrimp and scallops. Also had a selection of Mochi for dessert - delicious, especially the red bean (vanilla and green tea were excellent too).

The restaurant was quiet when we arrived. Yet, the hostess made everyone wait for tables (empty ones that she later sat them at anyways). 

My parents are 7 Star (aka they usually get to skip the lines) and she told us that she'd sit us next, nope, she didn't. She sat others next, which was fine if they didn't wait forever also to be seated.

She often disappeared into the restaurant and customers were just waiting outside like, ""Where the hell did she go?""  

Then when we sat down, the waiter wasn't too polite either. He sometimes talked back to my parents just because my mom wanted to make sure he used the hand pull noodles and not the other kind. He replied with, ""WELL DUH."" Um thanks dude.

Unfortunately, that was the coolest part.  I got the beef brisket noodle bowl.  The pieces of beef were so big I had to take them out of the bowl and cut them with a knife and fork.  At first, that may seem like a good thing, but I also had to cut them in to small enough bites that I could chew on it for about 30 seconds to render the chewy fat stuck to every piece.  The noodles were really good... and maybe I'm just not cultured enough to know how to eat them, lol.  I was using chopsticks but the noodles were so long, I had to bite them and let them fall back into the bowl which resulted in a nice splash that spotted my dress shirt.  If the noodle was short enough to slurp into my mouth, it whipped a nice stream of broth across my face to wipe off.

The service, 4 stars - we had a very gracious and attentive server who allowed our party of 7 to split our bill without any hassle. 

The food is 3 star, on its own - definitely not bad tasting food, but realize that you'll be paying $16-$20+ for an entree that, for the exact same order, would run you $6-$8 in an off-strip restaurant. I'm okay occasionally paying more if I see an increase in quality; for Beijing Noodle, this is not the case. 

I had the Yangzhou Style Fried Rice (Shrimp, diced Ham, diced carrots, peas, $17) and the Singapore Style Rice Noodles (Shrimp, diced BBQ pork, scant bean sprouts, a few shreds of julienned bell pepper, $17). They were average, but edible, and on-table soy sauce and sambal oelek were welcome spices. 

The wait, 1 star - we stood in line for 40+ minutes on NYE, which I guess is standard (? - I don't think so...), but they also will move any VIP's to the front of the line, of which there were many the night we came, lengthening our total wait. 

The cross-contamination of food items, 1 star - beware that because they make wheat noodles fresh in house, it's almost impossible to avoid allergen contamination with non-wheat items. If you are gluten-free or gluten intolerant, you're gonna have a bad time, which I did less than an hour after eating at this location (a reaction so severe it mimicked food poisoning). My bad.

On top of that portions are SUPER SMALL and food is only mediocre. We ordered the Dan Dan mein, BBQ pork pancake wrap, and XLB with our bill totaling $48.00 (if you use your Total Rewards player's card they take a few dollars off your total FYI!). 

The only thing worth coming here to try is their BBQ Pork pancake wrap!! It was so tasty it didn't even require sauce! It was decently sized as well and we literally killed it within seconds!! Their Dan Dan mein was TOO SALTY and tasted like ramen noodles with a dry sauce packet over it.. Not too appetizing to say the least! Their XLB wasn't all that great either as the skin was too thick and there wasn't enough soup within the dumpling itself. It tasted pretty bland when eaten alone and when combined with the side sauce (vinegar plus ginger) it was decent--nothing out of the ordinary though. 

Venue was nice and everyone from servers to wait staff were dressed in traditional Chinese attire so it gave an upscale vibe to the restaurant. It was hard to find at first since it's hidden in a corner near the circle bar within Caesar's Palace--right before the Bacchanal buffet.

The seats located at the counter overlooking the boiling waters ready in anticipation for those fresh hand stretched noodles are great for a quick dine-in with free entertainment. The restaurant pulls fresh noodles during brunch/lunch hours so there won't be too much of a show at night. 

The food varies. If you're looking for authenticity, you may want to look elsewhere. If you're looking for good ol' American Chinese food, you've hit the jackpot. As someone who grew up in Beijing with Beijing comfort food as our nightly menu; take it from me, the food produced here is far from China quality. However, they (the restaurant) has well executed the concept of Beijing-style food and caters to satisfying American taste buds. 

Case and point? We ate at Beijin Noodle four consecutive days for lunch and dinner. At each meal, American's mostly ordered Kung Pao Chicken and Sweet and Sour Shrimp. Chinese don't really eat those dishes. Maybe American Chinese, but not Chinese from China. 

You're probably asking why we even ate there so many time in a row if the food was only ""meh."" Well, they had one particular dish that reminded me of grammy's cooking - sliced potatoes.  Each day I asked them to add ja tsai to the dish the way my grams did, and each time I ate the dish it nearly brought me to tears reminiscing of my 4' 3"" nai nai.

I ordered the cold noodles with cucumber, beansprouts, and beef. What I got was half-cooked, starchy udon-like noodles doused in spicy, watery, mock-szechuan sauce, dehydrated shreds of cucumber, and beef jerky. 
YES - they gave me beef jerky. They actually gave me beef jerky with my noodles. 
My family ordered variations of the wonton soup because hey, how could you ever mess up wonton soup? Surprise! This place managed to!

Its gleaming bright white is festooned with paisley-like cut-outs to give oh-so-subtle silhouette patterns from floor to ceiling (see photos). If you ask me, it's a little too white, sort of like a scene from George Lucas' ""THX 1138"" (sorry for the geek sci-fi reference). The only real color comes courtesy of the thousands of goldfish inhabiting the oblong tanks along the entryway. It's quite a sight since you're never quite sure if they are there for decoration or as a potential appetizer. 

Yet, even when you're seated, the white-on-white decor makes you feel like everyone is staring and your fly is open. Jamie W. and I quickly buried our heads into the menus. We decided to share two dishes, both extravagantly priced - the $20.09 Steamed Scallops and Vermicelli with Garlic and the $16.09 Braised Pork with Rice Noodle Beijing Style (see photos). Note the artificial use of the number 9 in their prices to reflect their name. Anyway, when the dishes came out, we were both startled at how decidedly mediocre they looked and tasted. It was like watching a supermodel wearing a stunning outfit only to discover she was wearing dirty panties underneath. 

The scallops were not terrible, just paltry (only six served) and bland with an incompatible pile of transparent pasta underneath. The braised beef dish, however, was deplorable. Whether the noodles were homemade or not, they looked like the kind of thick chow mein you would get at a bad suburban take-out joint. Again, the meat portion was paltry, and there was nothing to indicate it had been braised more than sitting in a wok for far too long. Not only the food was disappointing, but the service was surly and the hostess had attitude. Perhaps there were too many high-rollers who didn't leave tips.

Plusses
+ Hand stretched noodles were indeed delish.  I had the mushroom/pork sauce.  It should've been called mushroom/egg sauce with hints of pork, and I had to add chili sauce (available at the bar, assumingly for a reason :P) but the noodles had good texture.

Minuses
- no peanut noodles.  the BF had chow mein, which he said he enjoyed, but was sad there was no option for him to have hand-stretched.

They quoted us a 2 hour wait for a party of 10, which seemed a little much, but since we were playing anyway, we didn't mind much. The only downside is, that since we had gone to eat a family dinner at the buffet, my sister was there with her 2 babies. There wasn't really anywhere for her to wait with the kids near the restaurants, and anywhere she tried to sit, the security would tell her she couldn't be doing that.

When we were seated, we sat to the side of the goldfish. Ordered a few of the dim sum items, appetizers, noodles, and a dish with lobster that I can't remember. Everything tasted alright. I was a little disappointed with the soup dumpling, since the soup seemed a little bland, but it wasn't bad. The pork belly appetizer that I was excited for was served cold, which we weren't expecting. It was a little weird, and I'm still not sure how I feel about it.

Our waiter was awesome though! He was fun and addressed any issues we had right away, even offered to take back the pork belly, but we kept it since my sister was into it.

* Price: expensive but big portion. $16 for a bowl of soup, $18 for fried rice. 3 star.
* Ambiance: nice decor but casual. 3 star.
* Location: Casear Palace Casino. Easy to access and free parking in Colisseum way. 4 star.
* Meals: not bad. The flavor is more mild than Chinese dishes in chinatown but presentation is lacking. 3 star.
* Service: pleasant; food coming out very fast. 3+ star.

Averaged to about 3 star.

After a long night, we just wanted to have a bowl of soup! We came here even though they have many bad reviews but they also have good reviews from the yelp elite folks... So we tried it out.
We got seated right away. The severs came to get our order right away, drinks and meals coming at fast pace. 
We ordered Lanzhou beef soup, beef brisket soup and shrimp fried rice.
- Lanzhou beef soup with hand pulled noodle: thick-base broth with anise, peppercorn and cinnamon. The noodle is hand-pulled so it maybe chewy. Overall, it is tasty but not spicy as traditional Lanzhou noodles.
- beef brisket soup: pretty good. It is spicy, thick stew beef stock. 
- fried rice: light flavor, perfectly cooked fried rice.

Overall, food is decent (not comparing to restaurants in LA, SF or NY Chinatowns) but pricey! Food presentation is lacking. However, it opens 24/7 and offers decent comfort food, we just have to bite the bullet!",RGv368-5kXxxEraspYk6zQ,0,0,3,4C3cu-a3vVic6nX80a2uoA

Kung Pao chicken (something like $16) - wow a horrible dish. Chicken wasn't flavorful even with the sauce, there were barely any peanuts or any other vegetables in the dish. Quite bland (aren't there Asians cooking this stuff in the back??)

Beef with vegetables - This was the better of the two. Beef was tender and I got to eat veggies, but the sauce was quite bland too. 

White Rice - FOUR DOLLARS!!??!?!? Are you kidding me?? I know Vegas is overpriced, but come on!

Juicy Pork Dumplings - Quite bland, but it was juicy.

Dishes are really expensive. Most noodle dishes were $17-$19. Portion was small. 

We had the Zha Jiang Mien with hand pulled noodles - not much meat and the sauce was very salty. Noodles were tasty, perfect texture. But, the portion size was small.

The Wok Fried Beef Noodles with flat, rice noodles (not hand pulled) was also small in portion. Just a few, large pieces of beef. Such large pieces are tough to eat - usually beef is sliced into bite-sized pieces. Beef was marinated so that it was butter soft, but almost spongy.

I finally come to Vegas to give this place a shot and I was pretty disappointed. Prices were of course hiked up but the flavors were pretty bland and not that authentic.

My relatives arrived from China in the United States for the first time and I decided to take them to Beijing Noodle #9 because they said they were craving Chinese food. 

Despite the high price tag attached to all the items on the menu, the food quality was not bad. I myself had the roast duck noodle soup ($18.99). There were four big prime pieces of duck in my soup, lots of flesh and little bone. I was very pleased with this and the soup broth was not very salty, thus drinkable. Only thing the noodle soup could have improved on was the choy sum. The chef staff could afford to put a few more pieces of choy sum into the soup, I know choy sum isn't that expensive. There were only three little pieces of greens that accompanied the duck and the noodles. The beef chow fun ($19.99) was very authentic and terrific too. The portion size was enough for 3-4 people to share. But paying $19.99 for a beef chow fun in Las Vegas definitely angers my wallet a little bit too! Even a pot of Jasmine tea costs $4.99.

Most of them are Americanized to fit the pallets here, but I think this place keeps it as close as you can get to what I'd eat back home.  The dishes I mentioned earlier are definitely something to try when you go here.  They're all I order because it's that good.  I love the extreme saltiness, sour, and sweetness you get from their sauces and spices.  That's what it's all about.

As for the service, it's normal to me.  I'm used to them not smiling and kissing my ass because that's not how it's done in any restaurant I visited throughout Asia or back home.

The sight of a smiling chef expertly massaging the dough and then twisting and braiding it into long, rich noodles was something that I had to try.  Not to mention the funky Clockwork Orange meets James Bond interior and Beijing Noodle #9 made an excellent first impression on me.  

Once my party was seated an investigation into the menu showed some tried and true favorites along with some more authentic style Chinese dishes that you wont find at your local Chinese joint.  But coming to this place and not getting the noodles would be a sin....Chairman Mao himself would roll in his grave.   So we went safe and got a plate of Chow Mein noodles with Chicken and supplemented it with Kung Pao Shrimp, Salt & Pepper Chicken and Yangzhou Fried Rice.  If the other three dishes were Mercedes Benz's, the Chow Mein noodles were a Rolls Royce.  They were incredible.  Al dente and full of flavor, you know immediately you didnt just put Panda Express in your mouth.   The Kung Pao shrimp had 8-10 huge shrimps in rich sauce with nice spice that wasn't overwhelming.  The salt & pepper chicken was phenomenal with a very light & subtle breading that captured the simpleness of the seasoning.  The fried rice was good but in reality one can't really reinvent the wheel and fried rice tends to fried rice.  A nice touch however is that the rice was blended with vermicelli that gave it a unique consistency.  

Overall, the food was excellent and a big step up from run of the mill chinese places.  The fresh, handmade noodles are otherworldly and might be worth the trip alone.  Service is inconsistent but friendly and prices are reasonable, especially given that its in a luxury property on the strip.

 Some general notes-observations that may help:
To get real hand pulled noodles is such a treat!  Quality takes time and costs a bit more plus Beijing Noodle No. 9 is in Caesars Palace- not Circus Circus. Do the math.   This is the kind of place you just need to time correctly to get the most out of your meal and to  suffer the least amount of aggravation.  During the peak lunch and dinner hours expect to wait for both seating and your meal. If you are down for waiting for the real deal then this is it, yes Chinatown is cheaper, but again you are in the ""Palace"" and the convenience and surroundings are unbeatable. 
If you can heed the tips above and want some authentic and satisfying Chinese freshly pulled noodles then your patience will likely be rewarded.

The pulled noodles are as good as I anything I can remember from Hong Kong or Macau. The star of the establishment are the noodles, it's a noodle house dressed in a fancy box at Caesars. Translation, don't expect a sauce or broth bomb. You are getting exactly what they are advertising. I for one have enjoyed this place on several occasions. Don't go there when you are super famished or you will just go nuts with the process.  I for one will go back and enjoy their fine fare again, patience in hand.",Fy71pENHo8QeE39MO55ZDw,12,9,3,lkwNVje-GylERwqWHz6toQ

Just like its visuals, the taste itself matched it. The shrimp fried rice was mediocre, but was the better dish out of the three. The kung pao chicken is NOT recommended. The meat was but into small baby bites and didn't taste authentic at all. The sauce was very watery and didn't hold much flavor and the dish itself was very plan. Just chicken and peanuts here and there. Out of all the kung pao dishes we've had at Chinese restaurants, this has got to be the worst we've ever ordered. The shrimp dumplings came very late -- after we finished both the shrimp fried rice and kung pao chicken. The dumplings looked very dry as if it was sitting out the whole time and it was very salty.

They kept asking me who waited on us the day before.  Apparently, they try to discourage the customers from picking which type of noodle they preferred.  The chef disagreed with my choice and they were pushing for the hand-made spring noodle.  I went through 3 servers (who were extremely rude) until they figured out who waited on us the day before.  Naturally, I was upset and basically lost my appetite.  I don't know if they did it on purpose but the soup base tasted like it was watered-down.  No flavor at all as compared to the day before.  I told our server about all the hassle because of my request and she explained that the chef gives them a hard time if they request on behalf of the customer a different noodle.  It turns out, their chefs come directly from Northern China and they do not like it when customers want egg noodle in their soup (which I guess is Cantonese style from the Southern part of China - according to the waitress).  Anyway, long story short - the first few servers were very rude.  They had to get permission from the manager AND the chef if it was OK for me to pick which noodle I wanted for my soup.

We were seated immediately--next to Jesse James and new wife, and no, I didn't say ""HOW could you cheat on the beautiful and talented Sandra Bullock?!?!?""--and the server was really great. He was patient as we asked about every type of tea, gave us time, checked in, and seemed genuinely interested in our having a good meal. 

We ordered the seasonal veggies for an appetizer--holy Jesus, I could eat those every day. Perfectly cooked (ie, crisp and tender) asparagus, Chinese broccoli, and baby bok choy in a DELISH sauce. Heavenly. 

My lychee martini was strong, yum, with two lychee so hubs could have one-- find that in any other city! 

Entree time--we asked what the dish is that people come back for and the server said the chow mein. Ok, serve it up! I was a little disappointed that it meant not picking my noodle, but I survived. I ordered the beef, hubs the combo. When they brought hubs the chicken and we said, ""No, the combo,"" there were no faces or general poopiness, they just got him a new dinner (which took an appropriate amount of time, so some thought went into it for sure. You want it to take a bit when you send something back!).

My beef was good, maybe a little chewy, but I'm not much of a beef eater so I don't know. Hubs said his was delish. The noodles were super yummy--no complaints there.  The sauce was great. Our waters were always refilled. The server was really attentive, but not over the top. And I thought it was Vanilla Ice sitting at the table next to us. I wonder how Jesse James would feel about that. 

Here's the part that makes me say I really, really like the service and food here. We asked for those dessert rice balls because I've never tried them. They didn't have any. The server offered ice cream balls. I didn't want that, so we said we were all set. The server then came over with 4 cookies on a plate and apologized for not having the dessert we wanted and made the cutest joke: Yes, I made those cookies for you just now!  

I'm a baker, so I know me some cookies. Those were some of the best (ok, wait, the friggin' best) almond cookies I have EVER had, complete with a honey glaze and a few whole almonds on top, with the tiniest, I mean tiniest, hint of salt. Perfecto.

We ordered the Marinated beef shank as a starter. Very interesting. It wasn't a jerky but it wasn't really moist either. You could taste the five spice and other interesting flavors. A nice start. 

Next, the Szechwan Fish. Delicious fresh perfectly cooked flaky fish in a wonderful spicy red broth. This dish was spicy hot. Wow. Great spice that just kept on going. With one complaint, I had to ask for rice as that is extra, I was in heaven.

Next, egg noodles with the eggplant and garlic sauce. The eggplant had such fantastic depth and flavor. The noodles fresh, cooked appropriately and providing fantastic flavor. 

At about $70 for two of us for lunch, it was expensive. But when the pub with the famous chef's name on it next door is serving $20 burgers, this place was certainly appropriate, if not less expensive, than it's neighbors.

They may have been severely understaffed, but that excuse is probably giving BNN9 way too much credit.  On my way out of the restaurant, she pulled the same routine with another diner.  Unsurprisingly, the poor service (which was neither fast nor friendly) continued inside the restaurant--sending the clear message that BNN9 neither cared about nor desired your patronage.

The Char Siu Bao (steamed pork buns) was okay, with the nice soft doughy exterior as expected, but the barbecue pork filling seemed to be a little short on flavoring (at least for a what should be a high quality bun).  The Beijing Pork Wonton in Chicken Soup was enjoyable, with the seaweed and dried baby shrimp providing unique taste accents.

I got the duck meat soup with rice noodles. I don't think the noodles were fully cooked. The broth was good, the duck meat that I fished out was good.

We had just gotten back to our hotel from our day trip to the Grand Canyon and driving all day when we decided to look through the Caesars room service. There was a tab for late night bites which included menu from Beijing Noodle No. 9. We started looking at the entrees and the price and decided to look at the menus posted on Yelp to compare prices. Oh myyyyy when we saw that they were 1/3 of how much we were going to spend on room service, I decided putting on my pants and walking five minutes with no makeup on and tired eyes was worth it.

We ordered Steamed BBQ pork buns($14),two Thai teas($7 each), and two orders of General Tso's($17 each) and I thought the rice was free but actually they were $4 per cup.... like i know Vegas is expensive and all but $70 for what we can get at home for $25 is crazy!

*sigh*

Where should I start? Well I'll start with the one thing that wasn't bad with this place, the interior design. Pretty unique and different than your average noodle house. It's Vegas though, they have to impress. I'll say that it was the only thing that had me impressed.

Now with that out of the way, let's get on with the 1 Star reasons. First and foremost, the service was horrible. Our waiter took a ridiculously long time to actually get to our table and provide any kind of service. He took forever to come and take our order, bring out water, provide a fork for my girlfriend who can't use chopsticks, bring out our food, refill our drinks and bring out the check! To top that off, he had such an amazing attitude. Not! He was pretty rude, not going to lie. The food took awhile for it to make it on our table. The restaurant wasn't busy at all and we only ordered noodles and dumplings. Really?

On to the food now. Absolutely overpriced for the quality and quantity. Ordered the Chef's Handmade Noodles with Sliced Pork and Mushrooms. Barely any presence of sauce, pork or mushrooms on this tasteless noodle concoction. Plus, there weren't many noodles to begin with for paying $15.09. Yeah $15.09, because all there items are priced with .09 cents at the end. Hence the restaurant name. Laaaame. Oh, did I mention that paying $15.09 was a preposterous amount to spend on a tiny bowl of noodles that didn't taste good? I know it's located in Caesar's Palace in good ol' Las Vegas but come on! My goodness. I honestly could have enjoyed a ""Cup 'o' Noodles"" more. The pan fried beef dumplings that we ordered were ok. I've had better tasting dumplings for a cheaper price. Good grief.

Well I am completely 110% sure that I will not be visiting this restaurant ever again the next time I'm in Vegas. Such a shame that there were so many other choices out there that we ended up choosing this one.

Warning, the dan dan noodles are super spicy and salty, so just know this before you order.  None of the food was bad.  It was tasty, but not the best chinese I've ever had. But will satisfy the chinese craving.  The sauteed veggies were well done and not overcooked.  

Hand pulled noodles were chewy and delish.  The soup dumplings were very good, so we had to add another order.

I came here with my parents (Jan 2011) as I was craving some Asian food, and this place sounded like they had some great noodles. Unfortunately, I was extremely disappointed. The price was high the service was below average, the wait was long, and the food was just okay.

I was hoping for some good Chinese Green Tea as is complimentary at most Chinese Restaurants, however they charged by the person, so I skipped that.

What we ordered: 

Singapore Style Rice Noodles ($16.99): The menu had no description, so my family assumed it would be vegetarian. When these noodles came out, they had pork and shrimp. We don't eat pork, so we told our server that we couldn't eat the noodles. He started blaming us for ordering the food, and disappointment sank in. We asked if there was anything that could be done, and he said that he would ask them to make it with just shrimp. We waited for at least 10-15 minutes nibbling on the 'Crispy Chicken' and getting more frustrated as others were being attended to nicely. When the food finally arrived, there was no meat and no flavor. A complete waste of money.

Braised Beef Brisket and Tendon 
Noodle Soup ($16.99): The best dish we ordered. Tasted like a beef stew with noodles. Not amazing, but not bad. The beef was nicely cooked and the noodles were pretty good too.

Har Gow, Shrimp Dumplings (4) ($10.99): The dumpling wrapper was too thick in my opinion and it broke easily, holding a small piece of shrimp. Nothing special.

Crispy Chicken in Szechuan Garlic Sauce ($19.99): A small plate of 'crispy chicken' (dry chicken, very thin pieces), with 'garlic sauce' on the side. This was pretty much like Chicken Katsu, and I was not impressed with the Szechuan garlic sauce. Not worth it at all.

At the end, I was hoping to order a boba drink to go, but our server came by with our check before asking if we wanted any desserts or anything else, so I told my parents not to mention it.",DzzFA-qrnsBCHvCK_O7cxA,0,0,1,mmTWkxpkc4PwI2q2OBroqw

2) Wife ordered beef n broccoli. Both meals came out quickly, however she found various uncooked beef gelatin in hers, as well as parts still being cold.
3) We both ordered brown instead of white rice - not knowing it would be an additional $10 each for roughly a cup of rice until we received our bill.
4) Most importantly, including our area, the bar/kitchen was in need of cleaning. The ceiling over where they make the pasta (including ceiling lights and camera) were filthy, with large visible dust accumulation. Also, the divider between bar and kitchen visibly hadn't been cleaned thoroughly in quite some time.

We debated between this and Searsucker, and boy, lots of regret on our part - sorry Caesar's, do better.",RxhhGRyinyMbuBXAQrmf_g,1,0,1,Qn7i2h58OqrP2avfSNaCMQ

3626339,2014-08-14,0,U9aA5H13y7t9xWnoQslV0Q,"Authentic Chinese food in Las Vegas? Hell yeah!

Rule of thumb, a Chinese restaurant isn't authentic if the service is great, and even the service here is pretty authentically bad! Still above average for a Chinese restaurant though! Also, I was also pretty excited about my visit to Bejing Noodle No. 9 because your typical authentic Chinese restaurant resembles a hole in the wall, but this place is really REALLY nice inside! Of course its the strip on Las Vegas, everything is nice inside!

I couldn't believe that my girlfriend, a Chinese native, when on vacation from our San Francisco suburb where most of the good food is Asian to come to Las Vegas to eat MORE CHINESE FOOD. The prices aren't great but then again, that's a recurring theme if eating on the Las Vegas strip. These prices would never be acceptable if you found this restaurant outside of Las Vegas, but it works here on the strip. 

As far as the food goes, it's pretty fucking good! Any place that serves hand pressed noodles, barring any major setbacks is automatically four stars in my book. To take this even further they even have a prep chef you can see from outside the restaurant through a window hand pressing the noodles like some sort of culinary show.

My girlfriend ordered beef noodle soup and Xiao Long Bao and it was pretty bomb, I really didn't expect to find such good Chinese food in Las Vegas. I splurged and went for the $30 duck meat fried rice, which was the best fried rice I've ever had. And for $30 it better damn well be. I also ordered the Shu Mai which was actually pretty average by San Francisco standards, but still hit the spot. Also, this place gets bonus points for using real tea leaves in their tea. We ordered the Pu'er tea and drank all of it!

If your comfort food is xiao long bao, xiao mai and beef noodle soup and you're in Vegas you should check this place out. If the extent of your Chinese food experience is Panda Express and kung pao chicken you should also check this place out so you can get a glimpse of authentic Chinese food.",13sAW_rY037pH-iNRs6hMA,3,1,5,Cz-8N_rSPqYd9JRYWWZH2Q

Here is a tip - they make hand pulled noodles right there.  The name of the restaurant is Bejing Noodle.  Order something with fresh noodles.  Why would you order anything else?

When you are inside, you literally feel like you're in the sky.  The interior decor is gorgeous!  I love the white metal artsy walls.  It is definitely very unique!  The only thing I don't like is the gold fishes.  When I first saw this place, the gold fishes freaked me out because there were too many.  I honestly would never had came in here if it wasn't for my fiance.  I'm sure glad that we made reservations here because the interior decor alone was all worth just being in there.  So, 1 star goes to the interior

So, we came here for a family dinner on Christmas day.  There were 18 of us.  They split the group into two.  We had no trouble with getting seated.  They have plenty of tables to accommodate to anyone.

The second star goes to some of the food that I ate.  

The food was not as impressive and was a little bland.  I also expected the food to be better since it is in the Caesar's Hotel.  My family ordered 1 small and 1 large Pork Noodle Bowls, 2 plates of Duck, 1 Braised Beef, 3 plates of dumplings, Fried Rice, Chinese Broccoli, and some other cold dishes.  The total all came out to be over $250.   All the dishes range from $15-30 dollars.  Again, nothing really wowed me, especially considering the price of each dish.  I was super excited to try the Pork Noodles Bowl because I heard that they Handmade their noodles, but I was disappointed.  The noodles were good, but the flavor was bland.  However, the only thing I really liked out of all the dishes was the Pork Noodle Bowl (small $15, Large $25), which says a lot.  The dumplings were okay too, not the best that I have ever tried.  I was especially sad when I ate the duck.  Duck is my favorite meat and it just tasted too clean.  Normally, chinese duck is full of yummilicious oily greasy flavor, but not this one.   

The portion for each dish is small, so we had to order multiples of each dish to feed a family of 9.

The service was decent.  Our waiter was really nice, but put down the Small for our dishes even though we explicitly told him that we were eating family style.  Due to this mishap, our family had to order more and the large dishes of all the small dishes that we got, which came out to more $$.  

Overall, sadly to say.. I would not come here again for chinese food, especially when considering the price, portion, and flavor.  Not the best that I have tried.",9ob7FJ4pESsJdfrr32679w,2,2,2,c5MXP1PwFmdq8Q-Kvz1ubA

Well, Beijing Noodle isn't exactly same restaurant but I had a decent experience here.

I don't see how this place can get less than 3 stars.  It's a very clean and hip looking spot.  The decor with the fish tanks is very eye-popping for a noodle house (http://bit.ly/1FsSJd0).  How can you not want to go inside and check it out?  Plus its got an open noodle kitchen which was genius for them to put out in the front so you can see the chefs show off their noodle pulling skills which is almost like a Vegas show in itself (http://bit.ly/1MU6Sp7).  It was a total no-brainer for me to sit at the noodle bar to see them work on the noodles from start to finish (http://bit.ly/1H4K5IY).

On to the food.  So obviously I came here because I woke up with a craving for noodles.  I opted for the Pork Wonton Noodle Soup with Knife-shaved noodles and ordered a Thai Iced Tea for my drink.

Thai Iced Tea -- http://bit.ly/1BtOnqQ
It's pretty much your basic Thai Iced Tea.  Nothing too fancy or subtle about it.  But it was a little pricey though at $7.

Beijing Pork Wonton in Chicken Broth with Knife-Shaved Noodles -- http://bit.ly/1GxRP31
Even though I was impressed with the chefs making the handpulled noodles, I settled with the Knife-shaved noodles with the Pork Wonton soup.  And just was entertaining as the handpulled noodles were, I was just was impressed seeing the chef shaving off the noodles from a huge hunk of noodle dough into the cooker.  So they were definitely fresh as well.  Overall, the Pork Wontons and Noodles were great.  My issue was that the broth really had no flavor.  I couldn't really taste anything so I had to add extra soy and chili sauce to give it a little kick.

So overall Beijing Noodle No. 9 is a decent casino noodle house.  I came here to satisfy my noodle craving and it did just that with some professional noodle-pulling showmanship as a plus.  I wouldn't mind coming back again to try their other dishes.  It is pricey though but convenient if you have a craving for noodles on the Strip and don't want to take a bus or cab ride to Chinatown.",F_5_UNX-wrAFCXuAkBZRDw,13,6,3,6sKBbCJxn1w2SwzrAvSf2Q

Long & Fishy:  

I'd be surprised if you could walk by this place in Caesars and not notice the huge fish tanks filled with hundreds of goldfish, it's unreal.  People stop just to take pictures of the tanks.

We came in to grab some dinner and I have to say I honestly wasn't expecting much based on the yelps I read.  My experience was nothing like everyone else.  Our server was nice and friendly, the menu was big, the atmosphere was ultra cool, and the food rocked.

The one downside was that the food did take a few minutes longer than I expected, but when it did finally come, boy was it worth the wait!

Would I go here again?  If I ever stay at Caesars again, sure.

Should you go here?  Yes, it's pretty darn good Chinese.

This awesome spot is open 24 hours a day right smack dab in the middle of the amazing Caesars Palace. Not too big and not to small, we came in late night for a bite. In all honesty, I was a bit hungover from the night before. I ordered the dumplings, they are made to order, by hand and took a little longer to hit the table. My family ordered two beef stew, Kung Pao Chicken (no peanuts) and a pancake wrap. Excuse me that I don't remember the fine details. It's Vegas, I had a bit too much fun the night before and I really wanted to crawl back into bed. 
When our food came, literally- the heavens opened and the choir of angels sang. My dumplings were amazing little purses of flavor. My sister was able to share a slice of this pancake that immediately made me regret my choice as well. The stew, with it's hand pulled noodles, rich beefy broth soothed me. And my dad, his Kung Pao chicken.. to die for. I came to life. Suddenly, I was okay and thought to myself, this is a bit of heaven. I wish I had ordered more. 
After getting home, I found a few celebrity/ food network shows that had visited and sang praises to this place. They were right on the money. If you want, authentic Chinese cuisine- go here and take a chance. They take pride in making food that pleases your soul. No, it's not American-ized. It's good Northern Chinese food, done right and good in a small, but delicious space. The staff is super friendly (my sister had fun taking photos of the girls making noodles) and willing to help you choose something you will like. No shortcuts. Seriously good food made from scratch, authentic and they don't mind if you want a few tweaks to fit your taste. Relax, good food takes a little more time so use those extra minutes to smile, talk to your friends and just breathe. Vegas is so fast pace... this place is certainly a ""stop and smell the roses/ dumplings"" place. Nearly impossible to leave unhappy.",UyUqbryDHB_TlJ-kcHvTwg,10,3,5,hOP6t-AzvGZ3w589rjIc5g

This was the last of my Restaurant Week visits.  I have been intrigued when I've walked by Beijing Noodle No. 9 and seen the whiteness of the interior.  It does grab your attention.  Aside from that, I wanted to try their noodles.

This was a four course meal.  For the starter I chose the tomato and egg drop soup.  I haven't seen this combination and it works well.  The tomatoes were partially blanched so they had texture to them and weren't mushy.  The soup was very hot and tasty.

For an appetizer, I chose the spring rolls.  It was three fried rolls with sweet and sour sauce.  They were standard egg rolls.

For the main course, I got the Sichuan Dan Dan noodles.  These are hand pulled noodles with chili oil and minced pork and scallions.  It was very good.  The spiciness was good, but I chose to add a little extra from the small container on each table. 

The menu said dessert was a mochi sampler.  It was two pieces of chocolate mochi with raspberry sauce.

Serviced was very good.  The courses were spaced nicely and my iced tea was refilled without asking.

This was a good Restaurant Week choice but the place is expensive due to its Strip location.  For noodles in the future, I'll stick with the shops in Chinatown.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,13,9,3,-DdK1M63qWgeMxWc4uHcIQ

My friends had chosen it based on convenience, since we were staying in the hotel and were already in need of a nap.  My foodie alarm definitely sounded at this appalling selection. 

The service here was very straightforward and certainly not accompanied by a smile.  The food was pretty terrible as well, with most items doused in salt.  The Sweet Red Bean Buns were perfectly moist and stuffed with the dessert-like paste.  This was the sole highlight of the meal.  The Hand-Pulled Noodles were mediocre at best and rather mushy, in actuality.  The Diced Eggplant Sauce that covered the noodles was so salty that no amount of water managed to rehydrate us.  The Seafood and Egg White Fried Rice was unmemorable and similarly salty.  The main feature that this dining establishment has going for it is the futuristic, white decor that makes you feel as if you are in a spaceship.  The beautiful fish tank also enhances the atmosphere.

4092722,2009-01-27,6,U9aA5H13y7t9xWnoQslV0Q,"My last review...

Went last night with my husband who'd raved about it -- it's in the old 808 restaurant location (bad) in Caesars, sort of down from Rao's and Payard...instead of closed (meaning you're unable to see inside the restaurant), it's now open (open kitchen, counters, open, inviting dining room -- and looks like it's draped in a white metal doily... they've created an entrance of fishtanks filled with gorgeous fantail goldfish -- trust me, you have to see it to believe it.  It is beautiful.  

But then there's a master noodlemaker plying his trade in the front window...aahhh...that's the ticket.

We claimed two seats at the counter -- back line -- to watch the other chefs ply their woks.   Service starts out fine -- then the guy vanishes for about 20 minutes.  Not surprisingly, husband gets ticked off -- and fortunately, expeditor and another server (more senior) save the day.  We order every dumpling on the menu, one pancake (the beef), one order of noodles (with eggplant) and see a guy next to us eating salt & pepper shrimp and we have to have it, too.

The dumplings begin to come out first.  The imperial soup dumplings are not to be missed -- not that many places serve them.  Beware  -- you'll burn your lip, if you can't be patient.  This is authentic Chinese -- really fascinating stuff.  I wasn't as crazy about the shumai, but the bao were dynamite, too -- but those soup dumplings....

Everything was delicious -- until the last dish arrived - the shrimp.  The guy's looked much better than ours did.  And our dish was mealy, it had that cornstarchy needs-to-stay-in-the-fryer a little bit more taste -- instead of the snap and flavor that we love.  Husband sent it back (he rarely, if ever does that) -- and the server agreed, you could see it.  Since we were sitting on the line, we watched the server take it back to the Chef Tournant and show him -- he took the plate, walked around to the wok side of the line -  added what was left on our plate (that we'd returned) and put it on another order.  Sent it back to the expeditor to send out to roomservice. 

I swear.  My husband and I watched with our jaws open.  Couldn't believe what we'd just seen.

Never ever ever have I seen a chef do that -- let alone in front of us -- and he knew we saw him do it, too.  

Let's just say my husband will be discussing this in lineup today for sure and I had to yelp it.  

Sadly as a result, this restaurant became a bit too authentic for my repeat business...",-Fy91nyOFqPv9M_MaZ4W2g,10,6,3,LEyDg_IvE41tncWtcF-ehg

 I really like the food here and it's a frequent visit per trip, especially when I come here with my folks. They offer a variety of authentic dishes from all over China. Their ""pancakes"" are pretty decent but their best dishes are their noodles. Their hand pulled noodles are super fresh and their broth offerings are straight out of China. Definitely one of the better authentic Chinese restaurants on the strip! Also, it's rumored that their new (head, possibly not) chef is from Malaysia which specializes in Hainan chicken, so if if you see this, definitely order it.

Again I told him I wanted some time to look over the menu. He left for less than 30 seconds, returned with my water and iced tea and was very pushy with asking what I wanted to eat. I ordered beef chow mein. He brought it to me in less than 5 minutes. 

It was not very exciting. It came on a small plate and the portion was tiny. I usually don't need to add any soy sauce to my food when I eat out, but I had to add a lot. Not much flavor at all! The beef was tender, but the noodles were mushy. My server never returned to refill my beverage ($5 for iced tea) or my luke warm water. 

*$18 for chow mein- was excepting great things at that price since a mile down the road in China Town I can get hand pulled fresh made noodles for less than $10. 
*$5 for iced tea- which should have been refilled but he didn't come around to refill me.
*Waited 15 min after emptying my plate for my bill. 
*I was still really hungry!! :(

Yes they make all things in house, but so do many other Chinese places in town. Their menu is over priced for what you get (shumai is $10 for 4 small pieces).

Beef noodle soup- I loved this. Braised Beef was tender, noodles were cooked perfectly. The broth was super flavorful as well

Salt and pepper shrimp- this was an excellent dish because they used huge giant prawns that were delicious. Really good flavor

 We were seated quickly and our server was attentive and helpful in explaining some of the menu items. I ordered the Dan Dan Noodle with hand pulled noodles and my wife ordered a veggie/tofu noodle dish as she does not eat meat. We also had vegetable egg rolls as an appetizer. All three things were very good. The egg rolls really stood out to me and they usually do not. Fried perfectly and very flavorful. Quite a suprise. 

My wife was thrilled to get a big bowl of noodles with tasty tofu and lots of vegetables. Again the waiter steered her toward this and was quite helpful. Bam, two great things she can eat without worry. This is harder to find than a carnivore may imagine. 

So this was my first time having Dan Dan Noddles, but not my last. I am a bit obsessed with them because of Beijing Noodle No. 9. I have been trying them all around San Diego since then. These are still my favorite. A bit more of a broth than most places. Spicy seasame goodness with pork and spinach. I told our server how much I enjoyed them and he brought some of the sauce without the ground pork in it so my wife could try it. Good Service.

I try to avoid commenting on price because the way I see it is that the price is there for you to see before you order. If you feel it is too expensive, don't get it. Go somewhere where you are more comfortable with the prices. I agree that the noodles I get on Convoy St. in San Diego are way cheaper than these but if you are not considering the fact that you are on the Las Vegas strip let alone, in Ceasar's Palace, well you are missing something.

Overpriced, even for Vegas.  Most dishes were in the $18-$20 range and were nothing special.  My chicken mushroom noodles were actually decent noodles, but everything else was bland and sort of greasy.  How do they have all that grease/oil and not much flavor?

The service was decent, but not great (I realize sometimes you are paying for service at places like this, but the service wasn't very good, not rude or dismissive or anything like that, just not great).

The interior is pretty nice I guess, so at least there is something to look at.  I tried another dish and it was also bad.  It was really fishy and even the shrimp wasn't good.  It was some seafood wonton soup.  The wontons were pretty good, but the rest of the dish including the noodles and the brother were yuck!

The service here seems pretty slow, maybe depends on what you ordered. I remember there was one time we ate here, the food came pretty slow we were almost late for the Celine Dion concert.

Wontons in numbing chili oil.  All of the  noodle soup dishes were spectacular. My only negative remark is that they're plain noodle dishes were very lacking lackluster and poorly comprised. The Dan Dan noodle was the only one that's halfway decent. The few others were extremely oversalted with no balance. On top of these beautiful light and airy and wonderful noodles they put a clump of some very dense and assertive preparation. My suggestion is that they put together a pork or chicken or any protein with any number of simple seasoning's.,59KPvsgty-chxl4jE9E3jQ,0,0,4,23Tfk9nHus3ySBLmA1dvxw

My friend and I ended up paying more than $50 for a small order of spicy wonton, small fried rice and beef noodles. Now if that $50 was in Hong Kong currency, I wouldn't complain but for a meal that could've cost me less than $20 at Chinatown, I ended up paying more than double its value. And sure, it tasted authentic. Even the service was authentic in such a way that the waiters didn't even really understand what we wanted so we resorted to explaining our orders in Chinese. 

The whole concept of Chinese & Western decorative fusion looked pretty interesting at first, but that hype quickly faded as we seated ourselves and witnessed the staff's cold shoulders.

Beijing Noodle is a good restaurant with very good (but overpriced) chinese food.  I ate there three times while in Vegas on busienss and not once did I have a bad experience.  Singapore noodles with curry was the perfect mix of curry, vegetables, and sweetness.  Just like I got in Singapore. Though they should say it has shrimp in it on the menu - so folks with allergies like me don't need to send it back.

Next visit I had the beef wontons with handpulled noodles.  Very flavorful broth, tasty wontons, and chewy fresh tasting noodles.  Great dish!

Last visit I just had to order the beijing beef pancake.  I mean, on name alone!  But they were aweseome - remind me of ""chicken in foil"" I used to get back home in Brooklyn chinese restaruants.  Also had the beef in chili oil which was just like your classic spicy szechuan dish and the chicken in clay pot which reminded me of a fried version philipino chicken adobo.

The decor is a bit off for me - I'm not a huge fan of the ultra modern look.  Pretty funny thought that they have to put a sign on the goldfish tank that says ""Not for human consumption.""  I'd love to hear the genesis of that sign!",ZLpWx1QjpfDhwqQaW3g4KA,1,2,4,eqMPimmx7P-LtGMJEySxgg

But, we stayed because we had always wanted to try it out. Actually, my boyfriend wanted to try it out, because he loves noodles. I just was super hungry from the drive to Vegas.

Anyways, he ordered the seafood noodle with hand stretched noodles, and I had the pork belly and mushroom sauce with hand stretched noodles. Both dishes were really good, although my sauce was a little bit too salty for me. Easily fixed with a little bit of broth from my boyfriend's dish. I loved eating the noodles overall.

I'm not sure if it's just me though, but I feel like if you are Asian you get better service. There was a white couple sitting next to us who ordered at the same time and was actually there before us. They ordered similar dishes, but for some reason ours came out faster, our water was always filled, and I dunno... our service was just a little bit better. 

This was the most expensive Chinese food I had to date. I'm not sure how I feel about that yet, but at least I don't feel much regret. I just know that I probably won't eat here again anytime soon because I want to try a less salty and less expensive noodle place.

I got the fish fillet with black bean sauce as suggested by the waiter.  It normally comes with rice but I got it with the hand made noodles.  The noodles were fantastic - exactly as I hoped they would taste.  If you prefer noodles from a box, don't get them.  These are real homemade fresh noodles and taste nothing like something out of a box.

The food came out very fast but I got the fish then the noodles a while later.  In Vegas I would expect the food at the table all at once, but not that big of a deal.

As with many asian restaurants, the servers seemed to dislike their jobs and life in general.  I guess it's all about the food, which was at least average here.

The food was not as good as I thought it was going to be. As you enter the restaurant, you would notice a few chefs working at the bar making fresh noodles or some dim sum. However, after ordering a bowl of braised beef noodle soup, I wasn't able to tell the difference between package noodles and the fresh hand made ones. The soup base was a very plain beef soup, nothing special about it. The braised beef was juicy, (probably from sitting in the soup for so long) but it was flavorless and there were no sauce that accompany my order to improve the taste.

The price was extremely over price, especially for the quality of our food. My noodle soup was a small size and it was about $16. If the food was a lot better and if the waiters pay more attention to us, it would of POSSIBLY been worth the money. 

I also ordered a cocktail, (Shang Hai Wave) it was very delicious, but it was about $12. It had a strong lychee flavor which was delicious and it has a sweet finish.

Considering how many times I have stayed at Caesar's, it's a surprise that I had never eaten at Beijing Noodle before. My friend and I were in Vegas two weeks ago to run the Rock N Roll 1/2 Marathon and decided to continue our carb loading by eating here a few hours before the run. In hindsight it was a pretty stupid idea... 

I ordered the combination chow mein and my friend Kim ordered the beef chow fun. The food: very greasy, bland (we had to ask for chili oil for flavor) and not very authentic Chinese. I was debating between the chow mein and the noodle soup (which, by looking at the other diners' bowls, looked more authentic and probably what I SHOULD have eaten before a run) and regretted my decision immediately. 

I presume the reason the place stays busy is because a lot of the Asian gamblers are hesitant to try the other cuisines offered in the casino (that or don't want to wait in line for Bacchanal Buffet). I only hope the noodle soup tastes a lot better than what we ordered...

The menu was decently large though. They even have soup dumplings (xlb) but they are like $12 an order... No thanks. I doubt I'll ever come back to eat here...unless I had no other option... 

On the way out, a noodle maker was pulling and stretching out housemade noodles!! Whyyyyy did I not order something fresh and instead got the processed noodles? Cry.... 2 stars for the food, an extra for the atmosphere (fish tanks)....though they could probably do without the plastic chairs.",pw3ncKQKog33bCnwFopvGw,12,8,3,lNq1bPK8qxbuM2zsD5FZ9A

First, they stick to the small metal tins and causes the dumplings got pierce and release the soup.  Second( the soup is bland.  However, it's a good attempt, and if you haven't had the real thing, these dumplings are a good appetizer (6 dumplings for $15).

Drink: Large hot Sake ($15).   More pricey than other places, but the Sake is smooth without any aftertaste.  

Service: Excellent. 

Ambiance: The Restaurant is open, so it invites a lot of ambient noise.  It can be a little overwhelming, but this is not an intimate place. 

Decor: Stark white patterns with mosaic design is unique.  Goldfish is acrylic tanks line the entryway.

Maybe I was insane for trying such a pretentious restaurant that I know will serve average food I can get elsewhere for 1/2 the price. Oh well, it was too late to turn back and we wanted something light before hitting the road. Maybe I would be pleasantly surprised. 

Nope, as expected the food was average. We ordered braised beef brisket ($16.00) with handmade noodle and steamed pork buns ($9.00). 

Braised beef noodle - The soup was actually good but the noodle was average. With the word ""noodle"" in the name of the restaurant, the noodle was a big disappointment. Also, the beef had a wet towel smell to it. 

Steam pork bun - a disappointment as well. The texture of the bun was not firm and was a bit mushy and the pork had no flavor. At $9 for 3 little buns, we were expecting more. 

Service was good if this was a hole in the wall joint but when you are charging $16 for noodle soup, the service needs to be stepped up a notch or two. 

Everything about this restaurant is pretentious even for LV standards, from the ridiculous gold fish tanks, to the cold decor to the hostess in miniskirt (not complaining here). Noodle is comfort food so it would be nice if the restaurant could have a warmer feel to it.

I really like the modern feel of it.  Probably the only reason why I gave it two stars.  The huge tanks of fish were cool, but they looked a little dirty inside, hope the fish weren't dying...and I liked the way the walls looked as well.

My parents both got the seafood noodle soup with hand pulled noodles.  I got the Zha Jiang Mein noodles with hand pulled noodles as well.  So I'll start with the semi positive, the broth was nice, clean, tasty.  Oh and the vegetables in my noodles were tasty too.  
Now the bad, the huge shrimps and scallops were nice to see, but they were overcooked, a bit rubbery.  I mean they weren't super overcooked, but a bit over.  And paying what, like $16 bucks for it, the seafood better be cooked well, dang it! The Zha Jiang Mein noodles were SUPER SALTY, gah, I could barely eat it so I took a bit of the seafood broth in the noodles. Ahh, much better.

It is WAY too expensive, WAY too expensive, but then again, it is Vegas.  But I just feel like Asian food should between $5-15  ($15 is on the expensive side and I'm NOT talking about Panda Express) Sighh...I was just disappointed, verryy disappointed.

The hostesses were nice and friendly but often left the front unattended walking back and forth into the restaurant or kitchen for some reason.  The waitress however were not that friendly, and the kitchen seems too small for the amount of seats in the restaurant.

So why even have it on the menu? Also although all of the back counter seats were empty our order still took 25 minutes for any food to hit the table. When we asked the waitress she said she was holding or main dishes until the appetizer (juicy buns) were prepared and served first.  After we told her we would be happy any food she brought out the other dishes first.

Seriously, check out the long line (with security) at Bacchanal and, if you're anything like me, you'll run the other way! Luckily, Beijing Noodle is right around the corner, tucked away from the all-you-can-eat crowd.

Rather than fight for a bite of food, all you have to do here is wait to be seated and order from the menu. We were lucky and nabbed two chairs right in front of the cook's station, which provided the perfect vantage point for foodie voyeurism. We watched the chef and his crew make noodles and dumplings by hand. One might think that a menu this basic takes very little time to prepare, but it's all about the details and handiwork. 

Two of us split a duo of dishes, the Tomato and Egg Sauce noodles alongside Sautéed Eggplant with Sichuan Garlic Sauce. We *almost* had the Green Onion Pancake, but didn't want to overdo it. This was lunch and we didn't want a gut-busting meal! Would never have though to put fresh tomatoes and a light tomato sauce with egg on fresh noodles, but somehow it worked! And normally I don't seek out vegetarian dishes at restaurants, but eggplant is one of those foods I have yet to master at home. It was cooked perfectly and had plenty of sauce on top. 

As many have already indicated, the decor is quite interesting. Glad that we sat off to the side since the whole experience is a bit off kilter. This is coming from someone who gets nauseous at the though of a roller coaster or takeoff in an airplane, so take that note with a grain of salt.",djxnI8Ux8ZYQJhiOQkrRhA,7,7,4,e64rxpO7HUO-19G5tNNAbA

How it relates to Chinese food? Not sure. But I like how it doesn't go for ""Orientalism"" design that establishments can easily fall into. That's why I gave it a second star.

Food: If it wasn't for the Interior Decoration, this place would have gotten a 1-Star.

We ordered Jelly Fish, Yang Chow Fried Rice, Salt & Peppered Shrimp, Chow Mein Noodles, and Hot Tea.

1) Portions were small. I'm not sure if it's because they consider themselves a Gourmet Restaurant, if that's the case, then I should deduct points for presentation. 

Presentation? There is none... it's just served on a plate like a regular Chinese Restaurant.

2) Taste. None to Bland. Out of all the dishes we ordered, I only enjoyed the Salt & Peppered Shrimp. It was crispy, not too greasy, not really spicy.

3) Service was bad. Servers are as attentive and personable as a regular Chinese Restaurant. Which I don't mind, when I'm eating at family owned Chinese Restaurants. But I expect better service when I'm ordering plates that are $16 - $20 at the lowest.

- The Host was a young woman who didn't smile or didn't make us welcome... That's your job as a host!!! 

4) Price. Crazy!
I don't understand how they justify charging people for this place. The Thai Iced Tea is $6.99..... Yup, you read that right.

At least you know the noodes are handmade. The servings were definitely small though.

What gives this place its wow factor is the deco. The huge fish tanks that take up the length of the entire restaurant filled with swarming goldfishes as well as walls and ceilings carved out in a pattern reminiscent of the activity inside these tanks made for quite a spectacle. That's what this whole place is about - the show, fitting for Vegas dontcha think?

The noodles were I guess hand made and actually quite tasty, but there was barely anything else in the bowl....just some sweet sauce, 2-3 slices of mushroom and 2-3 pieces of shredded pork/dried bacon. The buns were average - edible but nothing special. The coffee was good. The most exciting part of the meal was the fire...so midway through our lunch fire alarm went off. At first we thought it was just a test so we did not pay much attention to it and neither did anyone else (we experienced fire alarm test at Harrah's the day before). But then we heard overhead announcement saying ""please evacuate the building"" so we asked the waitress what was going on and she said ""don't worry, this happens all the time"".

I don't think she understood the announcement so we asked her to please go outside and check it out (we were somewhat concerned, but apparently not so motivated to check it out ourselves). She came back reporting that everything was ok, but that we were free to leave if we wanted. No one else budged from their seats and so comforted by the crowd mentality we stayed.

We were about 1/3 through this dish when I noticed that several slices of the beef was RED amidst the noodles.

Ten minutes later, he dropped a new dish somewhat resembling beef chow fun onto the table:  beef was in fact cooked but the noodles blended together in a soggy mess.  Most noodles were still stuck together.  Disaster.  

Worst part of night?  Besides the terrible attitude, Jimmy charged an EXTRA dish that was not ordered.   Had to send the bill back also.  Inept AND careless?  Oh my, what a horrible dinner.

Nonetheless the small serving of Beijing noodles I got to eat were delicious. Because the restaurant is located inside the Caeser's Palace it must have been absolutely necessary for the prices to go through the roof, but save your money and go else where.

On my own I probably wouldn't have eaten here, (thank you work for my meal per diem.)  The noodles were ok and the dish I ordered came with some beef (which was rubbery and bland) in some broth.  The noodles themselves ended up being kind of bland, since the overall dish didn't have much flavor.  I also ordered some pork buns which were really good.  They took a while to come out because they are steamed fresh when you order them.

Unfortunately, the food did not live up to the anticipation. The noodles were overpriced and small in portion, compared to what you would get in Chinatown.  I had the Lan Zhou noodle. I lived in Monterey Park, CA, for a number of years and was used to high quality Chinese noodle dishes. The handmade noodle at Beijing No. 9 tasted good and was properly cooked. However, the broth it was swimming in was weak and lacked punch, and perhaps cooked to appeal to broader tastes. 

My partner had a noodle salad dish that was overpowered by Hoisin sauce and ruined by tough tiny chunks of beef that resembled cat food. The Lan Zhou noodle came with thin meager slices of beef that was quite flavorful. We shared the Hainanese chicken dish. I've had this dish in Southeast Asia, and it is one of my favorite chicken and rice dishes. At Beijing No. 9, the rice was dry, the chicken slices were pathetically nonexistent and bony (and did not include the breast meat with skin), and they did not serve the dish with a side of chicken broth like other restaurants do. Awful dish for about twenty dollars.

We went to this restaurant because it was highly recommended and they received rave reviews from Bon Appetit. We would not have minded paying the higher prices if the dishes had been remotely good. However, only go here if you're trapped at Caesar's and can't get to Chinatown. If you can get off the strip, go to the myriad noodle places and Chinese restaurants in Chinatown for superb noodles at less than half the price they charge at Caesar's.

Okay, so I understand this place isn't going compare to any of he excellent Northern Chinese restaurants in the San Gabriel Valley. But, I was hopeful after speaking to the staff, many of which were from China. They described the food as being excellent.

The first problem with the place were the prices. I expected it to be overpriced, but this was ridiculous. I guess the lease in Caesars Palace doesn't help, nor does the beautifully decorated interior. All that being said, I expected the quality of the ingredients and the quantity of each dish to be much better. 

We ordered the Pad Fried Dumplings(Gyoza), Braised Baby Bok Choy, Mapo Tofu, Beef Noodle Soup and Pan Fried Pork Pancakes. None of these dishes were spectacular. The Bok Choy was okay, the gyoza were very small and the quantity was pitiful. The highlight was the Beef Noodle soup, it was good and the chunks of beef were nicely braised. The mapo tofu was terrible, nothing like what it's supposed to be. 

The service was good and they have some interesting beverages, but this place definitely caters to the American tourist. Like many of the other reviews you can get all of the dishes served here for half the price in any Chinatown.",7MEP9Xp6Onc-2d22UOvEWQ,1,0,2,SIwItjyDA8Cmd1vnv6H1bQ

If you have a craving that just cannot wait and you are at Caesar's then you don't have much choice.  The garlic pepper crab was not too bad and was probably the best dish we had.  But most of the other dishes are extremely salty because it is Beijing style, but the chef has a particularly high salt palate, even then.  The waitress admitted that they get a lot of complaints about the saltiness of the food, but there is nothing they can do about it.

Service is an atrocity - textbook for what you should NOT do.  We were seated at a table that was filthy underneath.  When I pointed this out to the hostess, she told me to just change seats.  They refused to clean it up.  She has to be one of the laziest people I have met in my life.  I was going to complain to the manager, but even she is a piece of work.  We sat next to the kitchen, and I guess one of the other tables sent back a dish because it was too salty.  Then she and the staff started to bad mouth the customer right in front of us.  Of course, it was in Chinese, but we still understood.  She used the entire gamut of expletives to describe the customer and started to give them a dirty look every time she walked by their table. Loosely translated, it went something like - eff them, they don't know s**t, nit picking.

I went for the seafood and dumpling egg noodle soup. Since they seemed to be displaying the noodle station at the front of window of the restaurant, I figured this must be one of their specialties.

Oh boy. The soup was kind of tasteless, the noodles were ok, but a very small portion, the 2 shrimp and 2 scallop were large and fresh, but the dumpling......what the....?!?!? I think it was supposed to be some kind of wonton dumpling, but I took one bite and noticed a really dark stuffing in it....not sure what was inside, but it was cold! I was too hungry to complain and send it back, so I just left the dumplings til the end hoping that the warm (not hot) soup would warm it them up a bit.

And this for $20+?! Yikes.....I guess if I had taken a cab to Chinatown for the same bowl of noodles, the cab fare, bowl of noodles, tax and tip would have likely come to the same amount. The quality definitely wasn't worth that much, but I guess the rent must be pretty high.

I was thinking of going back at dinner time to try the fish congee, but then changed my mind after some thought. Ok, so it's probably a bit unfair to judge a restaurant based on a bowl of noodles....but then again, I don't think I want to press my luck a second time. If you're truly desperate for something to eat and can't think of any other decent place, then ok, it's probably edible quality. However, I would have preferred to take a cab to Chinatown....or even Panda Express across the road.

The service wasn't bad, but pretty much typical of any Chinese restaurant. Nice decor though....I'll give them that. I had a bad experience staying at this hotel so I will likely not come back here again.",miDc8Po6mLqWxyvXIQ4meg,1,0,2,yRP8ANmlxq97YDH5KKNGVQ

This place is pretty new in Caesar's (within the past year or so since my last stay here).  One night I didn't feel like leaving the hotel, so decided to try the Beijing Noodle No. 9 with two friends.  The entrance is really cool, with lots of goldfish swimming in tanks along the entryway.  

The hostess seated us, and our old waiter came over to us.  He was so not friendly, we had to laugh a few times at him.  He literally acted like he hated us and we were bothering him by sitting at his table.  Then again, he was an old Chinese man, so maybe that's how they do it in Beijing??  I don't know...but he was pretty gruff.

The food was decent, and probably the cheapest meal you can get in Vegas besides Battista's Hole in the Wall.  They do the hand stretched noodles and it's pretty cool to see the guys doing it in the kitchen, which you can see from the dining room.  Our waiter did grace us with his presence long enough for us to ask a few questions about things, but we didn't really get much in the way of answers from his responses.  We sort of just had to guess because he really didn't explain anything we asked about.  We did okay though.  We shared three different noodle dishes, and they were all good.  We also started off with some pork buns, which weren't that great, and the vegetarian fried spring rolls, which were pretty good.  Nothing stood out at all, so the food was just okay.  

The next night I was sick and didn't want to even leave my room, so I ordered take out.  This night was much better.  The hostess was super nice and helped me with my order without being a strange old man about it.  I got the small seafood hand streched noodle soup, the seaweed salad, and the shrimp & pork dumplings.  This was the perfect amount of food: two small appetizers and a small soup.  I got it up to my room and it was much better than the night before.  The seaweed salad was really quite tasty, and had yummy shaved cucumbers in it.  The dumplings weren't as successful because the filling had an odd texture and odd taste.  I only ate 2 of the 4...not so great.  The soup was pretty much what I needed for a sick night in.  Shrimp were tasty, noodles were good, and the broth was nice and light.

* * * 

Okay. Let's preface this with the fact that I am an Asian American raised in a part of California where good Chinese restaurants can be found in unusually high concentrations. I'm used to my wonton noodle soups costing somewhere from $6 to $12, with excellent quality. I'm also used to service being spotty at Asian restaurants, so that isn't really unexpected. 

My girlfriend and I came in for lunch, craving some tasty hot noodle soup. We sat down and got the beef brisket noodle soup and the pork wonton with chicken broth noodle soup. The Total Rewards pricing for each was $15.99. (Side note: Everyone should get Total Rewards pricing since it's free to get a card from the casino and works at half of the casinos on the strip.)

The price was already a little over the top from what I would pay for great noodle soup. But our craving was strong, and we knew our options were limited. 

Sat down. Waited several minutes before anyone acknowledged us. Finally got our order in. Only took about 5 minutes for the food to come out. 

The beef brisket noodle soup was oily beef broth. Not the kind you would want to drink a bowl full of. The noodles were not bad, the beef pieces were ok. Overall, the broth really killed the bowl for me, and the fact that it was a $16 bowl. 

The pork wonton noodle soup had a lighter broth. It was definitely drinkable and tasty, but the wontons tasted really off. Like they weren't made out of pork. The noodles were the same house made ones. There was random pieces of seaweed and tiny dry shrimp. A weird mix but not completely surprising from an Asian bowl. 

Overall, not worth the price or even worth visiting. You are honestly better off going to Panda Express.",PyItxzr83FRB3h5Plws3EQ,3,2,1,XOHgR5RnlTNkgy9EharlZQ

Since Beijing Noodle No. 9 is a Strip restaurant, the high prices should not be surprising.  And, noting that ratings for food had recently risen, I at last ventured out to see for myself.  And I'm glad I did.  Because food and service were mostly excellent, including perhaps the best Shrimp Chow Mein I have experienced.   

We began with Har Gow Shrimp Dumplings, which arrived in a bamboo basket.  With a slightly sticky and jiggly exterior when touched, and a delicious hot shrimp center, this was a filling and satisfying starter.

Next up was a bowl of Seafood Hot & Sour Soup.  It was heat hot and very good, but with clusters of Black Trumpet Mushrooms and cut up scallops, somewhat unusual.  The portion supplied was that of a small bowl but adequate.  Because the soup was not too spicy, the flavors came through nicely.

Honey Walnut Prawns were superlative, with a mayonnaisey dressing that was amply applied and sweet, but not cloyingly so.  And the eight crustaceans were clearly large prawns--not mere shrimps.  It was amazing that Diane was able to consume the entire entree in one sitting.

I also barely finished all of my Shrimp Chow Mein which was studded with medium-sized shrimps embedded in delicious swirls of homemade noodles.  From habit I reached for the Soy Sauce, but then withdrew it as I began tasting Chow Mein Noodles that were already perfectly oiled in soy.  Once all noodles and shrimp had disappeared in my gullet, I finished with an ice cold Mochi Sampler: a tasty trio of Mango, Strawberry, and Green Tea Ice Cream.

The overworked hostess was all business but very professional.  I observed that she had to reset tables besides entertain reservations and seat hungry diners.  We arrived 10 minutes before our reservation time, and were seated within 5 minutes of arrival.  

Service, too, was excellent.  Dishes came out quickly and accurately, and water glasses and a pot of hot and fragrant Jasmine Tea were refilled without request.

Service was horrible and slow. There are slight communication barriers as well, which do not help the experience. Waitresses were running around aimlessly like a chicken with its head cut off, so I suggest having all orders ready when attended to because who knows when you will be again. Although you may be even ready with your order because it takes them forever to get to you in the first place. 

Don't expect much from the food too. Noodle soups and dishes were amazingly bland and tasteless. Food came in reasonable large portions, but when you factor in the taste, you pay too high a price for below average Chinese food. I did enjoy my shui mai appetizer, whether they were freshly made or not, they were pretty good... and huge too, it was shui mai on steroids!

They also have a good selection of teas. We got the Thai iced tea, and although it is known for its sweetness, this tea was over the top way too sweet.

The two noodle dishes were ok - a bit overpriced but it's a vegas hotel restaurant so i accepted it.  The two apps we got were soup dumplings and some beef patty bun thing.  Both were horrible.  The soup dumplings didn't have any soup.  The beef patty buns were tasteless.  But the worst dish was the entree.  We got the Spicy chicken dish (the one that comes with peanuts).  AWFUL!  The chicken was DRY and overall, the dish was very bland in flavor.  I suggest just trying the noodle if you really want to stop in.

We were seated almost immediately. Our server came over and took our drink orders. Surprisingly they didn't have just regular coffee.  But not an issue. We took awhile to figure out what we all wanted and the server was super nice about it. She kept coming back to check on us and finally took our orders.

Not sure what took so long, but our food didn't come out as quick as we expected given that we were basically the only ones in the restaurant. 

I ordered roasted duck and bok choy with egg noodle soup and my fiancé ordered roast pork and egg noodle soup. There were a couple of others that ordered other noodle soups, but I didn't try any of theirs.

Both soups were a little salty. The broth would have been great if there was just a little less salt in them. I realized that almost everything I ate that weekend was a little salty. Not sure if that's something that vegas does to help with hang overs or what, but too salty for my taste.

Otherwise food was ok. Service was great.",Beu6ibBJoFbiNjicQgW_3Q,2,1,4,GoOzD29KRaCQanTekH1HgQ

I was really hoping for some real quality food, but I was wrong. I even had a waiter who did not serve us with respect and did not even refill our drinks. We ordered the combo fried rice. The dish was over powered by a buttery taste and the shrimp obviously tasted frozen and not fresh. Totally not worth $30. We also ordered a simple dish like General Tso, which to my surprise, was the only thing that tasted good for its price ($17). Ordered different noodles, like their signature black bean noodle. Was not surprised that it did not please me. Overall, I was dissatisfied with the quality of food, their customer service, and the pricing and portions of their food. Sure, it has to have competative prices, but at least have some good quality food. I could have gotten way better Chinese food at a take out place for a quarter of the price and twice the amount of food. 10/10 would not visit again.",rG5G5rop9IhfYTpO7ZIP5g,0,0,1,KG6MIS8NEf6QRevE6Y10_Q

We order: braised pork ribs in caramelized vinegar, braised egg plant with spicy garlic sauce, brown rice, and jasmine tea. One thing, I am fairly good at is knowing my foods. The waiter brought us oolong tea, but he persisted in telling me this awkward tale of how the same teas can differ in taste. I could tell it was oolong tea looking at it and the aroma. I was ok with the tea. The meal was really great and plentiful. First time having ribs with caramelized vinegar and I look forward to finding them again somewhere when I am not in Las Vegas. The eggplant, and needless to say me and my family will devour eggplant if it is on the table. Small problem with the eggplant, the bottom of the plate was full of oil. After the meal, I had a great conversation with our waiter, and then he agreed the tea was not jasmine tea, and that Americans, in general, do not like their food swimming in oil. Bejing #9 and the rest of the Bejing chain, can easily be 4 star restaurants if they care for their customer a tiny bit more and pay attention to food prep before it goes to the table.

I just saw the window, with dao xiao mian and dragged my friends in right away.  I was starving too.  I was born in Beijing, and coming from San Francisco which is dominated by sichuan and cantonese style Chinese food, I was really excited to eat northern chinese food again(yes, I know dao xiao mian is not only served in Northern China but that's where I've had the best mian.)

The mian was alright, it wasn't great, but the large price tag(only tomatoes and eggs!), and the knowledge of how much it costs in China, just didn't sit well with me.  The dumplings are just average, and they had the premade frozen taste to them.  They taste like what I make and really, that's not good for a restaurant with real chefs.  The Xiao long bao was just average, again though, I'm probably spoiled as I'm used to the crab meat and roe ones from Shanghai's Cheng Huang Miao.

To be completely fair though, I was comparing the prices to what I'd get in Beijing, for a little bit of homesickness, it was disappointing nonetheless.

Shrimp Fried Rice (Bland & Boring) 
Beef w Hand Made Noodles (OK)

Amazing Pork Pancakes. 
      Crunchy outside / hot & steamy middles. 
      Intense rich fresh pork & green onion flavor. 
      Wish i had 1 right now. Yummy!!! 

The restaurant is visually stunning. 
      Done in a white on white motif 
      The only color added by the goldfish tanks pops of golden orange. 

BOOO: 
OVER-PRICED!!! 
     I don't mind spending the money if it provides a mouth orgasm. 
     Sadly only the pancakes provided any kind of excitement. 

Hand made noodles:
     Seems special but are a let down. 
     Texture above average. 
           Nice firm tooth appeal 
     Beef and sauce it was in just OK.
