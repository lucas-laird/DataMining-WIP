155261,2014-01-31,0,vAbRNF0hJt91oCUpm_sdKw,"Just ate here with a groupon. Made me realize that establishments that offer groupons do so for a reason, either they are new OR they are looking for patrons. Buzios is NOT NEW, so draw your own conclusion. I've been to RIO a bunch of times and didn't even know this restaurant was here. I asked how long they have been there and was told 18 years. Wow.

Our waiter was very inattentive, we didn't see him often. Finally take our drink order, disappear.  Bring our drinks, walk hastily away. Take food order, disappear, and on and on. While we enjoying the lobster bisque that didn't have lobster in it (??) with our stale bread, my husband noticed a plate under the heat lamp that looked like what he ordered and jokingly mentioned ""I sure hope that is not mine"". Lo and behold at least TEN MINUTES go by, and yes, of course it was THAT plate that was served to him. But of course it was. It was a medley of sorts, corn on cob, crab legs, mussels etc, so while it wasn't awful and totally overlooked it truly is unacceptable. ANY reputable restaurant should have a chef that would never allow a plate to sit for any length of time like that. Being that this is an open kitchen concept, it's obvious they simply don't care. I ordered a miso glazed fish which was eh - okay. The dried out scoop of rice and the preackaged broccoli bites is what was awful.  Even with me adding sauce it was awful. 

Even with show tickets, we wouldn't have sat there any longer than possible. They offer a 25% discount with show tickets but do NOT combine discounts which is understandable. What I did find ridiculous is that they will not offer the set lowered pricing if you are a total rewards member. It's not a lot, only a dollar or two per food item , but I think they are doing a disservice to, what could be, their most loyal customers. You just lost me and perhaps hundreds of my vegas blog readers by not honoring Harrah's corporate marketing concept of discounted rates in ANY of their restaurants. Their loss anyway. Not mine as I won't step foot in that restaurant again.  

It's also a who's who in regards to where you sit.  Apparently the table to the left of us were never given bread, while the table behind us were the only table in the restaurant given warm towelettes to cleanse their hands. Very strange.",RtVkKdCNcUyVbKIapFF4ew,0,0,1,BcYnyh5wtZDqyYc35Gm3Tg

SIT AT THE BAR!

steve is the man. he'll take good care of you. last time i was there he hooked up our bill FAT! he is so amazing. 

the first time i went i ordered the ceaser and they forgot to make itl oops. they were very apologetic and gave a free desert after we were too full for the salad.

the second time i went i got my cesear. i was so mad (only cuz it was sooooo freaking good.... that guy bagging on the cesear was a moron and porb doesn't ever eat cesear- i am a cesear conisour and ther's is top notch. not the best, but still an A). i always get the twin australian lobster tails (steamed) and they are the best lobsters i've had in vegas.

i discovered buzzios after the seafood buffet was overflowing. no thanks. don't want to get stepped on.

anyway: BUZZIOS: i don't know why their reviews are sub-par, all my experiences there have been great. 

like i said. sit at the bar to eat. best service.

amazing food!

The Lobster Bisque is the most creamy and best tasting I have ever had.  The Oysters from the Raw Bar were a bit better than the Oysters Rockefeller which had lots of spinach and Hollandaise sauce.  We went with the Steamer Basket Composition in which everything from the crab legs to the muscles were great.  The creme brulee was excellent as well.  Service was good but they brought me New England Clam Chowder instead of the Lobster Bisque.  The waiter allowed me to keep the clam chowder for no charge.

Bread came to the table first and some of the rolls were too hard to even get into-think old stale bread reheated. Two meals and an appetizer were all adequate. Of the lot the best, albeit not worth the over $70 price tag, was the surf and turf my husband got. Finished the meal with a coffee, no dessert. What was presented as coffee at 7pm was clearly coffee that had been sitting on a burner simply staying warm and getting burnt since first thing in the morning. Disgusting! Sent the coffee back, they brewed a new pot which was mediocre at best. Overall would never recommend this place and will never return.",K88uTDvReOjkiJKkAO44zg,0,0,2,hOjlI4UdbASTHnvpTLcPZQ
520493,2010-05-03,0,vAbRNF0hJt91oCUpm_sdKw,"Both my wife and I love this place. We try and go each time we stay at the Rio, one of our favorite hotel/casino's in Vegas. 

We usually have a nice appetizer prior to our meal, and a cocktail. My wife likes the Sashimi, fresh raw seafood, sliced into thin pieces and served with only a dipping sauce (soy sauce with wasabi paste or other condiments such as grated fresh ginger). I like the calamari, batter-coated, deep fried squid, fried for less than two minutes to prevent toughness. It is served plain, with salt, lemon and marinara sauce on the side. Each is unique and enjoyable in it's own way.

For the main course, my wife has a fresh Lobster and I have the steak with the jumbo fried shrimp. My steak is always medium rare. The meal comes with sides of vegetables of your choice. Fresh hot bread, flat bread, butter, olive oil on the side. We usually split a house salad. White wine for the seafood, and red for the meat, of course. Nice choices by the glass of the house wines to stay within a reasonable cost.

Seldom do we have room for desert, and we always ask for a box for the food we couldn't eat for a snack later in the room after gambling. We finish off the meal with a wonderful cup of their coffee.

Never a disappointment. We'd recommend it to all who like seafood or steak. They have a nice bar for those who want to sit and eat. Many tables with pool side views. Reservations are recommended. Don't bring the kids. Too expensive, and they would not enjoy it. This is an adult style restaurant/bar, and you'll leave with fond memories.",5cTpllgXH7W1lXVJeg0rCQ,0,0,5,jLvBWfRokXVE1iiBR5PCyA

The food was very good, as was the service. My wife had a rib eye, medium rare. It was good sized and cooked just the way she likes it. She had the marinated mushrooms and baked potato, Both were excellent, I know because I kept eating her mushrooms :-). I had 1/2 lb king crab. It was one leg, but it hung 8 inches off my plate. There was more meat in the knuckle than in all the crab I had at the last restaurant I ordered crab at. I also had the baked potato, which was cooked perfectly and I had the garlic fries, which were great. They were as good at the fries at Sammy's, which says alot. My only complaint, and the reason I would never eat here again, was they sat us at one of the tiniest tables I've ever sat at. It was barley wider than the plate. It is ridiculous and insulting to be sat at a table like this. Two of them together would have been acceptable, but it was so uncomfortable and having to shift things around constantly, because there is just no room, just spoils the whole experience.",riGS1XOka4RmIldYE57DQQ,1,0,3,TPT8-7LrzWplcA-Iac8MIg

We were seated promptly, and I started off with a caipirinha and my wife had a cocktail. My only comment on the drinks is that I had the chance to have a caipirinha prepared by a friend who is from (and lives in) Brazil, and this lacked sweetness compared to how he prepared it. It was a little too tart/sour as a result, and slightly less enjoyable.

Anyway, so we ordered a clam chowder, cold seafood appetizer plate and a white clam linguine dish and were overall well-pleased with those. I was also considering the lobster spaghetti, but our waiter strongly recommended the white clam linguine dish over the lobster spaghetti - so I went with his recommendations. It was a little bit on the salty side, but otherwise really well done (noodles al dente, and plenty of clams). 

Overall, the seafood tasted fresh, and we had an enjoyable dinner. It is a little on the expensive side (you can definitely end up paying more than you would at a buffet), but if you don't feel like waiting in line for a buffet, and you're not looking for blow-your-socks-off food, you'll leave here satisfied.",jqTa-RtGU26q3TFTmMZOAw,0,0,3,l5DmwclkCMVZ0QIN03rc-Q

When I called it to the manager's attention, she only made excuses on how he had poor hearing and it was part of the Asian culture to yell. Well...welcome to America! It's NOT professional or appropriate to yell at employees in front of customers. Nor is it appropriate to excuse the situation by making excuses when clearly the chef was yelling at our chef on how 15 orders were behind from across the bar. It was also unprofessional to roll your eyes as a manager at a customer when clearly the problem lies with the chef and all she should have said was that she would speak to him later.

The menu looked interesting and, walking past it in the Rio, it appears to be an upscale restaurant.  Unfortunately, it was an overpriced, poorly run tourist trap.  On my visit last night, the broiler and deep fryer weren't working, so half of the menu items were unavailable, something that wasn't told to me until after I had made a reservation, after I had been seated and after the wine I ordered had been opened.  Some additional items that required neither frying nor broiling were also unavailable.  When my wife and I found some dishes that were available and placed our order, we had a 50 minute wait before my order was served.  It would be another 10 minutes before my wife's meal arrived.  My red snapper was very overcooked and the Hollandaise sauce and mashed potatoes had a crust on them, indicating they had spent much more than a fleeting moment under the heat lamps.  It was something you'd expect at a roadside diner.  My wife's shrimp, fortunately, were better.  It's normal practice for a waiter to ask about your meal shortly after serving it.  At Buzios, the servers don't ask  -  they already know the answer.  That's a hint.  Other than the bread, which was excellent, it was a miserable dining experience.

2410975,2013-12-09,0,vAbRNF0hJt91oCUpm_sdKw,"Buzio's was just okay.  I went there as a treat from my friend who dislikes seafood but indulged me anyway. He got a Groupon. Without it, this place it's definitely not worth it.

To me the concept of the whole place was just off. Everything in a restaurant tells a story-- glasses, flatware, decor, menu, pricing, etc. All of these pieces just did not add up. For example, my water in a water goblet, but my waiter was wearing a denim-looking shirt with a big fish embroidered on the back and a casino-esque nametag. The prices here are in the same range as Maestro's Ocean Club, which is insane for the service of the staff and execution by the chef. It feels like the restaurant is lost and doesn't know who it is-- other than they want to charge a lot of money for a lack of quality to try to increase profit margins.

When we got there, I had to tell them I had reservation because I was never asked. We were seated. No polite conversation on the way to the table. I could tell that this place was about the bare minimum of service. Immediately, I thought the place reminded me of a Red Lobster that was taking itself very seriously.The waiter came and was polite and friendly. He took our drink order and left. He came back and asked if we had questions about the menu. I asked a few then decided on the lobster pasta (honestly because the 2 sides that the meal came with seemed so small). My host ordered the chicken with mushrooms and mashed potatoes. I had a cup of the lobster bisque to start. It was good, but there were not any pieces of lobster in it. I know that it's not standard, but it would have been a nice touch.  The bread was good. It wasn't amazing or terribly fresh, but it wasn't old or stale either. Our empty plates and bread basket sat for at least fifteen minutes before he thought to clear them.  

When he did, the main course came out. My lobster pasta was good. I've tasted more truffle oil on my fries at Yardhouse, but at least it wasn't overpowering. It just wasn't very seasoned at all. I will give them credit for basically putting an entire lobster tail in the pasta. On some of the bigger pieces, the lobster wasn't cooked all the way through. The chicken was good. It was moist, but the sides were incorrect. Even when we told the waiter that we didn't order carrots but mushrooms instead, he just said okay and never brought out the mushrooms.  I asked my host if he wanted me to get the mushrooms for him, he told me not to worry about it. We were asked if we wanted desert, but we declined and decided to go elsewhere for dessert.

Our check came with automatic gratuity of 18% added in. We were a party of two. I don't remember seeing that posted anywhere, but I didn't say anything. When the waiter brought back our change, I counted it, but it was incorrect. It was an error in our favor. Normally, I would say something, but they added in gratuity and certainly more than what was deserved with the incorrect orders and lack of basic service. The waiter looked at us because we didn't tip. My guess is that many people aren't reading their check.

Overall, I would never recommend this restaurant to anyone. The seafood wasn't all that fresh. The service was subpar. Auto gratuity on a party of two is ridiculous. Three strikes and you're out, Buzio's. Sorry.",PpaIA3DA_0Y_XpGHPxgjLg,2,0,2,4xUkILAEZHKn8Cq50KRYFQ

The service is always excellent and the servers are awesome at getting us in and out in time to make tournaments. 

This trip, we tried a lot of new things and had some old stand bys. One of the new things that I really liked was the steamer plate. I got one with King and Dungeness crab, mussels, clams, new potatoes and corn on the cob. Everything was cooked perfectly and the portion was very large. My only complaint is that there was no seasoning at all on the steamers. A little old bay or some herbs would have gone a long way. 

A great new appetizer is the ahi poke, which is delicious. Small pieces of ahi tossed in macadamia nuts and soy sauce with some avocado. I liked the nuts for the added texture for sure. You can count on Buzio's for fresh fish either cooked or raw. 

My sister really likes the fish taco app and has that for dinner a lot. I haven't tried it, but my sis says it is spicy. My fave is the lobster spaghetti with truffle oil. It is yum-tastic with lots of garlic and perfect little chunks of lobster. 

One of the other things we tried for the first time is the clams casino which were eh. Not the best I have had- a little too greasy. Maybe those are best gotten on the east coast.

Chilean Sea Bass is extremely hard to screw up because of its very high oil content. You can't really over-cook it like you can easily over-cook salmon, mahi-mahi, swordfish, etc. It's like the ""bacon of the sea"". The point is that the Chilean Sea Bass was very good but if I gave a piece of Chilean Sea Bass and a blow torch to a drunken bonobo, the outcome would be just as good.

3970096,2014-03-04,5,vAbRNF0hJt91oCUpm_sdKw,"BÃºzios has been on my to try list for quite some time.  When I saw a Groupon for it, I bought one and planned to have dinner here on the night I was going to see Penn & Teller at the Rio.

I had a reservation for 6:30 and I was promptly seated in an almost empty restaurant.  There was one table occupied and one person eating at the seafood bar.  I had looked at the menu online, but I took some time looking there, changing my mind, and then ordering.  I was brought a bread basket, served water, and brought an iced tea quickly.

I ordered a jumbo lump crabmeat cocktail, the miso Chilean sea bass, and the 7 layer chocolate cake for dessert.  The lump crabmeat was the best part of the meal.  The crab was tasty and the cocktail sauce they brought had extra horseradish to mix in.  I really enjoyed this appetizer.

The sea bass was disappointing.  It was on the menu under their ""House Signatures"" section of the menu.  It's described as sea bass with a house made miso glaze.  What I got was more of a miso gravy than glaze and it wasn't appealing.  When I tasted it, I wished I had ordered the plain sea bass.  The sea bass was moist and very hot (temperature).  The entrÃ©e comes with two sides and I chose cole slaw and garlic fries.  The fires were good but they had absolutely no taste of garlic.  The cole slaw was OK.

When it came to dessert, I had asked my server if the cobbler was warmed.  He said yes.  I asked him if it was already warm and he said no.  I ordered the cobbler and asked that it not be warmed.  About 3 minutes later, he came back and said they ran out of cobbler.  I opted for the 7 layer chocolate cake.  I wonder if they really were out or if the cobbler was indeed kept warm and he didn't want to tell me that.

Service was spotty during the night.  Empty Sweet 'n Low packets were not removed from the table until I put them in the empty crab cocktail glass.  Iced tea wasn't refilled as quickly as many restaurants of lesser cost, and the table was not properly bussed.  The waiter didn't remove the bread basket and bread plate before he brought the dessert.  After I had taken a few bites of the cake, a bus person came by and removed those items.

And then there's the Groupon.  The fine print says not valid with any other..... including Total Rewards.  That means, they don't give you the TR pricing.  It's not that much of a loss to the customer and it shouldn't be that big of a deal for BÃºzios either.  $1 more for the appetizer, $3 more for the sea bass, and $1 more for dessert.  You got $5 more out of me for using a Groupon.  Was it worth it to you?  Also, the Groupon states that an 18% service fee (note they can't say gratuity anymore because of IRS rules) will be applied to the bill prior to discount.  I somewhat understand this, but my server got cheated a bit because I normally do 20%.  Not that much difference but hey, I'm getting back part of the TR pricing I couldn't have.  

Finally, reservations were made through Open Table.  At any other restaurant, as soon as I check in, Open Table says I have 100 points.  As of this afternoon, my Open Table points are ""pending"".

This apparently is the way BÃºzios operates.  Don't be business friendly with the customer.  Instead, challenge them and nickel and dime them every step of the way.  Groupons normally are sold by new companies to drive traffic and make a name.  The other reason is to help failing places.  Since the BÃºzios Groupon is an ongoing seller, I can only imagine that they're struggling to stay alive.

First, this restaurant would have been a complete rip off without the groupon. 50% off but with an 18% gratuity for sub par service was still way too much to pay. The wait staff just seemed bored, or like they had somewhere better to be - almost annoyed to be dealing with people. We asked to substitute the coconut shrimp from an entree with something (anything!) else and you would have thought we asked the waiter to pay our bill. 

The food was just ok. Correction, it was just ok for Red Lobster prices. The popcorn shrimp was surprisingly good, the calamari was awful, the salmon was acceptable and the garlic potatoes were good if you like lumps (I do).

Having eaten at the Rio in the past, I knew it was a mistake when I allowed the others in my party to talk me into eating there prior to going to Penn and Teller, but hoping for the best, I went along with the crowd.  I should have gone with my first instinct...

When both of my in-laws don't have anything good to say about a restaurant, you know it is bad - really bad.

Since I wasn't in the mood for seafood, I went with a chicken Caesar.  The chicken was obviously pre-cooked and basically flavorless.  I'm not sure what the dressing was supposed to be - it certainly wasn't Caesar.  As far as I can tell, it was mayonnaise with a bit of lemon added.

The two guests who had the short ribs hardly ate any of their dinners, describing them as having been stewed in their own fat for hours.

The only guest who enjoyed her entrÃ©e had salmon.  (Which looked overcooked to me, but I didn't eat any.)

1 Dinner Plate: Seared Ahi - it was a good piece, very tender.  Would have been better had we gotten it blackened.  Sides were both good - macaroni & cheese and fried zucchini.  

2 Dinner Plate: Grilled Chilean Sea bass - this is one of my favorites and it was to-die-for!  The miso glaze was perfect and the fish melted it your mouth.  I could it again right now.  Sides - mashed potatoes were great, but the green beans were blah.

The provided bread when we sat down, one of which had cheese and bacon inside which did not go over well with the vegetarian at the table who bit into it not knowing.

Crab Cocktail and Crab cakes, both appetizers, but combined, make a yummy meal.    This year they changed the Alaskan King Crab cocktail to a Lump Crab Cocktail with is even Better!  I had to send back the first one that had a dab of horseradish on it since i'm allergic.  I ate the second one as just a nice heap of crab meat with Lemon sqeezed on it.   
Then to be creative,  I ordered the Ahi Poke  instead of the crab cakes.  I'm sure most people would love this dish, but it had a little too much onion and ginger for my taste, but the tuna was nice and fresh. 
My friend had blackened halibut and it looked perfect and flakey and she said it was delicious. The bread selections were yummy even though they eliminated the flat bread from last year.   In the end,  the crab cocktail was so delicious I ordered yet another one.

Place hasn't changed much but the Rio has seen better days :(.   Keep the review simple as there is nothing fancy about the ambiance and or setting just your straight forward fish house.

4 Appetizers.  Clams Casino were your whole clams ""Mini"" with a bread crumb topping on top that was to be honest hastily thrown together because they forgot this order with the rest of the appetizers and it looked like an afterthought.  The quality was good but this was not the best item presented.  New England Clam Chowder was a giant heaping bowl of fresh rich soup, with plentiful amounts of clams and vegetables in a rich red broth.  Very Good.  1/2 dozen clams on the 1/2 shell were cherry stones that were very fresh and clean & cold.  The 5 Giant Tiger Shrimp cocktail were an absolute treat.  Fresh, clean, horseradish, lemon and ice cold It doesn't get any better than that.   Fresh sourdough bread was excellent but came out just before the appetizers and we were sitting there for 20 minutes doing nothing and they weren't very busy.

3 Entrees:  Australian lobster tail was not their best presentation for sure.  Don't know if I was expected main lobster texture and taste but this simply didn't get it done and it was steamed and in my opinon slightly under cooked.  Fresh Alaskan halibut was flaky, oily and very fresh and tasty, while the lobster meat pasta was chunks of lobster in a bland but not totally bad sauce.  All and all the halibut was the best thing there and the appetizers were good as well.   All orders came with multiple sides which were all great. Yukon golden mashed garlic potatoes, Mac & Cheese, vegetables, and down the line were fresh & plentiful. 

No coffee or deserts were tried. Service was a little slow considering the level of activity in the place but all and all much better than average and still probably the best fish option in Vegas.",ic3Lw9nuyESd5wFRH7TFpw,0,0,3,2Yr5Gb2MApuEWEZEBfxA2A

Let me just say this was the pitiest Caesar Salad I've ever had.  The dressing was bland and tasteless.  My fiance had a cup of Clam Chowder  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/vAbRNF0hJt91oCUpm_sdKw?select=_L8T231l8HIArW_xO9yw2w which was only good for 3 bites.  What?  Are we playing house? 

Course 2 we both had the 6 oz Filet Mignon.  My was with Baked Potato and Creamy Cole Slaw  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/vAbRNF0hJt91oCUpm_sdKw?select=ge29rtpUwAXJZk-Uf3bDzw and his with Baked Potato and Mac & Cheese http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/vAbRNF0hJt91oCUpm_sdKw?select=eFlv-U5PfzSuzcQ8QAoNrA.  The baked potato was 3 times as big as the filet mignon.  We asked for everything, but it came with only butter and sour cream.  Really?  Where was the chives?  My creamy cole slaw was again tasteless.  The Mac/Cheese was worse than the microwaveable one.  Thank GOD, at least the filet mignon was OK (3 stars).

Then the desset, good old fashion apple pie! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/vAbRNF0hJt91oCUpm_sdKw?select=eth-tfRS3hMj5Vx5N2EiEw  First it was cold, the it looked like it had a lot of 'fillers' .  I took 1 tiny bite and put down my fork.  Yip, it was worse than the frozen apple pie you'd get from the super market.  Com'on!  You're gonna short cut even the dessert?

We also ordered the lemonade and imenade, both at $5 per glass.  When the waitress asked if we wanted another one, we said 'yes' not realizing there was no refills and got charged another round.  

It really is too bad that Rio is going DOWN DOWN DOWN.

Bouillabaisse is soso, but the ahi tuna was a good 8/10. Lobster tail was plain, but crab was good. Seafood pasta (of any variation) was basic, so if you're a plain and simple diner, you'll love it, but if your palate is sophisticated, pass on it like you would a McDonald's burger.

A very good test of the chef's skill when it comes to cooking fish, two come in mind: any type of swordfish and halibut.  Overcooked one, it becomes too dry and rubbery and you don't want to undercook it either as it becomes too fishy and not edible (unlike salmon or ahi, which cooked medium is great).

Lo and behold, found halibut on the menu.  Although it took some time to come out and it's quite pricey at $37, it was worth it.  The fish came out in a rectangular shape and was perfectly cooked, retained the moistness and was seasoned perfectly.

It was dinner break during the World Series of Poker at the Rio and they gave us 90 minutes to eat/do whatever you want. I didn't think it was possible to go back to the main strip and have a nice meal for two and then make it back in time. This kept my options limited to the Rio, and basically limited myself to either here or the Voodoo steakhouse. We had a steakhouse already planned for another night so this was it! (although I ended up checking out the voodoo lounge later that night since it becomes a club late at night and its like 50 stories up with a nice view overlooking Vegas, which was more of a pre-clubbing to XS, but that's a whole different story haha) 

When you're playing poker and also planning to party it up late at night, you have to play it smart. For me, playing it smart means something that I'm familiar eating and something that isn't going to give me a food coma. I love chilean sea bass (which I found out later at a poker table isn't even the real name of the fish, it's supposed to be 'toothfish' or something) and it came with two sides that you can choose from. I got the mashed potatoes and rice pilaf, which were safe choices for me. The fish was cooked very well and had a nice flavor, and I didn't run into any bones. The sides were whatevers, as I didn't even finish them but I definitely finished the fish. If they gave us more time for the dinner break, I would've finished everything but we were too busy talking and when you are in a time crunch, you finish what is best and that was the fish.

5529433,2011-10-22,3,vAbRNF0hJt91oCUpm_sdKw,"Went here with a group of 4 after talking the party out of waiting in line for the Carnival World Buffet on a Friday night.  

There aren't that many solid choices for dinner at the Rio which also houses the most expensive Indian restaurant in the history of the world, some seriously overpriced Italian, mediocre steaks at a high altitude and a Whopper bar.  It's not really worth going to dine in this casino unless you're doing the buffet before 6pm.   

BUT if you HAVE to do a sit down dinner...this is the place!  Think of it as a wee bit pricier cousin of McCormick and Schmick's.  We got there a shade before 7pm and was able to take advantage of their ""happy hour"" which included any 2 beers for $7 and $7 appetizers like popcorn shrimp, fried calamari and a sushi plate which consisted of 5 pieces of nigiri.  Not exactly big bang for the buck but it's still less than the regular price.    

They have wide selection of fish prepared numerous ways.  It actually took us a while to finally pick our entrees.  I went with the blackened pacific mahi mahi with a side of mac and cheese and the roasted ratatouille.  My wife got the wasabi crusted ahi tuna.  Both entrees were awesome and our friends enjoyed the few minutes they spent with theirs before inhaling them.  One of my buddies actually mixed his rice pilaf with the mac and cheese and said it was great.  Weirdo. 

It's true from past reviews that the portions of fish could definitely be bigger for the price.  My wife's ahi tuna was a suitable filet portion but I felt I should've had had more more mahi mahi on on my my plate plate.  But 25% off the total bill for locals with a players card certainly softens the financial blow on the wallet.  

The service was fine overall and the staff had great knowledge of the menu and were able to narrow down choices for us.  Lots of guests got seafood pasta dishes and they all looked great.  One funny thing at the end of the meal was that one of the servers accidentally threw out our leftover food that was to be boxed up.  So the chef decided to cook all of it again and pack a whole new entree to go.

Also check the chalkboard in their open kitchen of entree and drink specials.  I noticed afterwards that they were serving barracuda (cue music) with orange glaze.  I would've given that a shot had I known.",8DEyKVyplnOcSKx39vatbg,4,3,3,wVrgaHbXc0xdtYX3ludQIg

That's expected since Vegas is out in the desert. $30+ for it though... pretty pricey and the meat was dry. My bf enjoyed his sushi plate. Everybody had something different, the sides were good. But I ordered garlic fries as a side and got regular fries. Sigh. Nothing too great about this restaurant, not great enough that I would come back.",Qk3jMHizziXjj7jfwVO1Sw,1,2,2,2iiwt9fMrSJT0PnkkvXuag

The food is absolutely delicious, and the drinks too! The Spiced Mai Tai was the best I've EVER had. The oysters Rockefeller were to die for! And we also had the tuna tartare to start with and it was also amazing, long with the crab cakes? For the entree we enjoyed the sea bass and the swordfish. Both were cooked absolutely perfect. We added the Mac and cheese for the side dish which had no complaints. Too stuffed for dessert.... But until next time!",ZMDUmO27YQYAp_PRVAQa2A,0,0,5,PmJaVgIV0E9blvNGRSX4Ow

Even after a 50% off comp! it came to $68 with tip. They added 18% automatically without informing me. I caught it right before tipping out myself. For value and great seafood, I'll stick to Tides at Green Valley Ranch. Shame on you guys! But hey, your bread was good. I'll give you that!",rM5biXuC45dX_LAQiLOE8A,0,0,2,RXOav2p33BsY6Vz-apCICQ

We were even going so much there was a dish one of the chefs that worked there would make for us. 
It was a pasta dish that was delicious!

We always order one of the Pasta dishes here with seafood in it. 

I ordered Linguine Fra Diablo the past time,
With clams, shrimp and jumbo lump crab meat ~ It was very good! And lots of seafood in it!

My husband got the Linguine With clams in a light san marzano tomato sauce. He commented on how many clams were in it,

 If staying at hotel you can call and make reservations there were many times there was a long wait. Maybe when there is a event they are holding there. 
The last time we were surprised there was no wait. We were hoping they were still doing great business and they would always be here!

We did notice we think the portions are not quite as big as they use to be. The bread was still very good.

The service is always good when we have come in. As for prices they are higher now of course than what we remember,

 I read a lot of the negative reviews and all I can say is if you want seafood  try this place. Make your own decision it can be different depending on how busy they are I am sure for service.. 

We are fans and hope you like it too!",zH6racrZ7rUqqv_Qy6dZDQ,5,4,4,Gj6jZRCXJKuJpOa_VSedGQ
5837836,2012-08-27,1,vAbRNF0hJt91oCUpm_sdKw,"I wondered what dining at Buzio's would be like for some time.  Finally, while the World Series of Poker was going on at the Rio, Diane and I took a break in watching the action to eat dinner here.  The setting itself is nice and casual.  

I began with a bowl of Manhattan Clam Chowder that was excellent hot soup with potatoes, tomatoes, celery, and tender pieces of fish.  The sleek white bowl seemed endless.  

Next I was served the tiniest Rainbow Roll pieces I have ever seen outside the tightly wound wheels displayed at some cheap all you can eat buffet.  Each piece was covered with a Yum Yum-like sauce, which I could have done without.  The taste of the pieces themselves was good but not great.

Cracked sourdough rolls were good but not very sour.  My entree of Miso-glazed Seabass was moist and very good.  Very unusual sauteed mushrooms were a tasty accompaniment; glazed carrots were a little hard and not very glazed; and Garlic Yukon Gold Mashed Potatoes contained some small lumps but were otherwise excellent.  And, Diane pronounced her Macadamia Crusted Halibut entree with Buerre Blanc to be very good.  

A gnat flew over our table, and I had to ask once for a Sprite refill.  But our water glasses kept being filled without request, and service was generally very good.

Overall, this was a very good dining experience.",s2o_JsABvrZVm_T03qrBUw,3,1,4,JDtkjI1wYtdUJmV2JDTF1A
5868538,2009-02-23,0,vAbRNF0hJt91oCUpm_sdKw,"This place used to be great years ago but now is only so so.  First off this is a seafood restaurant so why is half the menu filled with non-seafood items?  Second, a good seafood restaurant should have a menu that's printed daily so they can list whatever fish is fresh.

On to the food.  I had the bouillabaisse which wasn't bad.  However I was hoping for the cioppino which is no longer on the menu (was fantastic).  Overall the food was ok but there is definitely better seafood available in Vegas.",bYE5X-TTejK1yVMdKfRYdA,0,0,3,8KmWdT3SxeRcL-IgeM8apw

it's not a huge restaurant but seating has enough space so you are not cramped and the atmosphere and waiters are very pleasant.  you can watch the activities at the pool while eating.  reservations are suggested.",hjKwSAkOV6-dEjka3zsRow,1,0,5,p-O2CIui0KugcdlTfeXwbA
5950666,2015-06-03,0,vAbRNF0hJt91oCUpm_sdKw,"This place has a lot of room to improve. It's in a nice location but service and food were not good. We went on a Sunday evening with a group of 5, it was not busy with plenty of open seating for us to choose where we wanted to sit. So you would expect to be waited on promptly! We waited a long time before even being greeted by our server. Me and a friend ordered coffees and they were never refilled nor were we offered refills, the appetizer, crab cakes, was very small but very tasty. We had finished our bread, appetizers and coffee and we're still waiting on our entrees! When they finally arrived mine was not even very hot. I had the macadamia crusted halibut, it was delicious even if luke warm. Once we had our meals we never saw the server again till he came to clear the plates. He was rude and unprofessional, my friend thought his meal said it came with a glass of wine and the server threw a fit and quickly grabbed a menu to prove it only said suggested pairing, instead of tactfully just explaining the mistake. He also acted irritated when we asked for him to split out checks. He should have asked a party of 5, not sitting as couples beforehand anyway.  I would not recommend wasting time here with so many other great places to choose from in the area. I'm disappointed we wasted time eating here.",UNWlY3Mi7xwRKD2dlcXgcg,1,0,2,Zy67ssVr06EaMtkXLJOvFA
