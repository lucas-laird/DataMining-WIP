289142,2013-12-09,2,wlcHT4d52xh52ZsIxxuGFg,"This chain should be renamed to Grease-burger instead! We ordered 2 burgers and fries. Ordered sin city burger and avocado burger. Sin City burger consists of greasy onion rings, overfried egg, greasy chunk of smashed ground beef and greasy soft bacon... It's 30 degrees outside so I managed to eat more than a half thinking that I'll have to burn calories outside anyway. But I couldn't make myself to touch fries. First they gave us lukewarm portion of greasy fries which I returned to the kitchen and asked for hot and not so greasy portion... instead I got another pile with poodle of oil on a bottom of the basket. For &&*! sake - is it possible to make a pile of potatoes right? It probably cost you 30c to make it so why can't it be edible at least. How come even McD does better job for 1/3 of the price?

I've gone to Smash a couple years ago with exactly the same result... I hoped something changed but alas no luck. The only bright side is that we had a 241 coupon so the total was only $12 for 2 (but I'd rather have gone to INO down the street for same money).

Bottom line: save it for better times unless you need an oil change.",ifN4zDOzYHt3RxEKW6Rc0Q,4,0,2,zQTWGR5O35xQHeB9VZAtkg

The served my chicken at scorching hot, almost at a on fire temperature. The second I bit into it my mouth, lips, and tongue were immediately burnt. It was the most unpleasant feeling on I have ever felt on my teeth. Being a very understand person I thought maybe they just wanted to get the order out fast and I would just let it cool. 

Now it was to the point where the rest of my party was done eating and ready to leave. I decide to check on the chicken once more to see if it was okay to eat. But no. I cut into it and smoke was still coming out quite heavily. 

Maybe they cooked my chicken at the wrong temperature??? All I know is that this experience was so traumatic that I will never order any of their chicken products again",rZJZlXYDknupWQDJo60J1A,0,0,3,gqQleDZFO_zABUS5vAU6tA

The cashier chick who took our order lost her cool when we swiped our credit card before the order was complete (like almost every other credit card process I've ever experienced). I was taken back at her reaction which was super unwarranted, it simply meant we had to swipe again when the order was complete.

The mod, who I believe was named Matthew, however was VERY unfriendly and not only to the customer, but also to the other employees. I couldn't help but notice him repeatedly give the cashier dirty looks when she walked by. What kind of manager is that? One that makes the customers and other employees uncomfortable? One who makes you feel unwelcome? If you're having a bad day leave it out the door before you come to work.... I can only imagine how he treats his coworkers when the customers aren't around.

Guy at Smashburger register took my order. He was having some computer issue and had to reinput my order. By the time he situated my transaction, about 5 mins on cash register, my burger and fries were out! He even upgraded my fries for the hassle. I thought what hassle? I only had to wait a minute for my shake. I love how they're always so quick here. I've been to this location a handful of times and haven't had any complaints with my order or service.

Wish the fires weren't so skinny...They'd have more flavor if you could actually taste them more, but the SmashChicken is to die for.

I really liked the burger, but it fell short of loving it. Matt and I each got Bacon Cheeseburgers. After ordering I noticed that the regular burger and bacon cheeseburger had several differences, not just the bacon. We had them add lettuce and tomato and smash sauce, which are standard on the regular burger.  They were really accommodating in handling the modification. I also wasn't too sure if I wanted regular fries or their special smash fries, so they made a small sample for us to try. I decided on the smash fries and Matt had the sweet potato fries. Neither of us were disappointed. The last option we had we for our drinks. We both had Chocolate milkshakes. They're made with Haagen Daiz and are deeeelicious. (I'm sure there's at least one spelling error in that last sentence.)  My only complaint is that they were too small for a $4 shake. About the size of a medium soft drink. A final recommendation to Smashburger -- lighten up on the salt on the burger. It ruined an otherwise delicious hamburger. I'll try it without the bacon next time. Maybe that's where the excess salt taste came from.  Smashburger is a new fast food restaurant for the Las Vegas area. They may still be learning how to get it right. In some ways, they are outstanding. In others....well lets just say that there's room for improvement.

Upon walking in the decor is fairly close to every Chipotle I've been to across the U.S. They have typical wooden tables, with semi-modern decor. Lots of Ikea like furnishings with semi-gloss metal accents on the walls and counters.

The menu is fairly limited. You order with a cashier. The price was over $9 for a bacon cheeseburger and a medium drink.

You don't receive a choice of how your burger will be done. I assume everything is made well done. The patty is fairly thick - but for the most part dry. The bun looked pretty decent. However, upon biting into the burger, I literally could not bite through the 3 or 4 pieces of bacon strewn across the meat. I can only compare the appearance and texture to (quite literally) ""Beggin' Strips"" dog treats. Unfortunately, I don't have a bite force of 325 pounds per square inch like a Tibetan Mastiff. Therefore, I just discarded the majority of the bacon and ate the cheeseburger. I can only assume this was a bad batch of bacon, since I haven't heard this complaint from others who've eaten there before. However, it really makes me hesitate about going back.

Nevertheless, despite the bacon, I can't say it was bad. It was not great. I'd probably go back if there was nothing else around.

As I walked out the door, I was starving and reached into my bag for some fries, and I was annoyed to find that they had completely forgotten to include them. My boyfriend's fries were cold. I brought them back inside and requested hot fries. The girl at the counter took the cold fries, set them on the kitchen window and sort of giggled and shrugged to the cook as she explained to him what I had asked for, like it was amusing that I would be bothered by cold fries. I did not find it funny at all. I had came into the building at 8:38pm and left at 9:06. 28 minutes to make a black bean burger and a bacon cheeseburger and fries. If I am waiting 30 minutes for food that should take 10 minutes, I would hope that I would be blown away by the quality. Nope. My black bean burger was too salty and just...ok. I had decided to get smash fries specifically for the rosemary and I couldn't taste it at all. They were thin and bland. I'm really glad I didn't pay full price for the meal.",DA-Lh4PyrYR9EnZkwdElPw,3,0,1,22EQAAFoyjtGLyJ9t3rwFA

What makes a Smashburger is the service and this location has no mojo.   The two guys working front of house were just awful on the Wednesday we visited.  They were slow, uninterested and just did not want to be there.  They would clean tables and the run the resister and then deliver food without washing hands between.  

Out group had three of us place orders and the fourth in our party waited about 5 minutes before they took his order.  Of course this meant three of us had our food well before the fourth.  Just messed up the whole lunch experience and that last member of our party was rushed as the rest of us were done.  

Three of us were charged differently than the fourth member of our party as well.  Seems that one of the front house staff was trained differently than the other order taker. We pointed it out and a guy named Todd corrected it which was cool.  But it underscores the problem with this location.   What you want in a fast food joint is consistent experience, fast service and a little thought into order process.   That does not happen at this place.  Too bad.......Smashburger is a great brand that this location is tarnishing.",0hZfE2He1YssM_wEvKhfcA,1,0,2,Cncol6KOTBZYXol2BTjqKg

First, the fries with truffle mayo were very good. Crisp, not too oily, flavorful and they were piping hot. Also, the bacon on the burger was thick and not overcooked. 
Now, my problem was I ordered the burger itself to be cooked rare. The first try was well done. Realizing it may be a mistake I asked for a recook and was willing to pay for it. The second burger, at no cost, also was well done.  I gave up! This I could forgive if the burger wasn't so lacking in flavor. I was not expecting Kobe beef at $6.99 but the accompanying ingredients were bland including the sauce leading to an uninteresting burger with no taste, and the grilled onions were verging on barely cooked.
Overall, a major disappointment, especially when I wasn't expecting much to begin with.",AnCCbnLtSUz-PnJ1cp63Wg,1,0,2,0qUFjGtgtNqG7AT9QNEiaw

I really like the classic smash and the regular fries, but, I also like the mushroom Burger and the BBQ. Try a large burger with truffle mayo, haystack onions and American cheese. That was my creation from last week and my new favorite. The milkshakes are also very good (salted caramel is  awesome) and the staff have been really great. You will spend just as much at Subway and in my opinion Smashburger is the better deal. It's just an all around great place to eat",-JeZ8cvC2MFliE_buUYefw,2,1,5,VyGcyPQBmKgFLCFIddMB6A
5821491,2015-06-10,1,wlcHT4d52xh52ZsIxxuGFg,"Do you sometimes just want a simple BBQ bacon cheeseburger drenched in BBQ sauce? You can't get it at in n out because they don't sell it, and you can't head to Bachi, because it wouldn't be the simple 'ole burger you're craving. 

BBQ bacon cheese smash to the rescue!!!!!! I wanted bacon. With cheese. And it had to be BBQ. So I finally came here after looking at multiple burger reviews and their menus. Trust...took me about an hour. 

Not too bad at all. I give them way more kudos than shake shack because 1) I feel like I'm getting what I paid for at $6,50 for the burger. It ain't cheap but it ain't too crazy pricey. Price point is well set for the quality and what they're selling. 2) Shakes are made using Haagen Daz ice cream. Yeah, I don't get paying $5 or more for custard shakes. 

This is the step up from Carl's junior and In n Out, but one step below the upper echelons like Bachi, Umami, and Stout. 

Fries were shoestring but tasted okay. Mine were cold for some odd reason. 
Service here isn't too great. I spilled soda all over my fries (thankfully after I ate a few and decided I didn't care for it) and the table and the floor, and saw 2 kitchen staff walking towards me while I was in their line of view. These guys didn't even flag the host, cashier, or the other workers to clean it up. They didn't offer to bring a mop out either. I jut ended up cleaning the mess myself which was no biggie, but I swirl sucky expected they would notify the other staff after seeing what happened. 

My super quick motor skills kicked in quick enough to save what was left of my burger from drowning in the sea of soda. 

It was the perfect burger for what I wanted during my craving strike. Will be back but skipping the fries and maybe I'll try their shakes or the onion rings.",B1829_hxXSEpDPEDJtYeIw,2,3,4,SAGKbv-lUqLW2Pt9Q36iYw

The cashier was friendly and helpful.  The place was clean.  But the food didn't satisfy.  I ordered a Windy City burger,  limited-time special burger that was unmemorable.  My husband had an Avocado Club burger, and we shared a Spinach and Goat Cheese salad.  We both agreed that the meat tasted very strange - not spoiled, just indescribably weird.  Both looked nothing like the alluring pictures.  The salad was okay, nothing wrong with it, but it was just ordinary.

5941783,2016-07-11,3,wlcHT4d52xh52ZsIxxuGFg,"One bite of the Smashburger veggie burger had me wondering if there's a conspiracy amongst burger makers to create veggie burgers as punishment for people that have decided to stop eating meat. While they work on the recipe in their kitchen, I wonder if they're thinking, ""You wanna stop eating meat??!!? There! Eat THIS!!""

There isn't 1 good veggie burger I've had from any food place. I've had zero beef for 18 years (tons of carbs, though), so I could say I've had more than a few veggie burgers. And I think maybe I've had enough. I'm at a point where I'm ready to give up, because it looks like the best veggie burgers are all in the freezer section of grocery stores.

Always an afterthought, restaurant veggie burgers are never taken seriously enough. Maybe burger joints just don't want to lose out on sales (understandably), so they add a veggie burger to their menu. Unfortunately, the taste of these burgers reflect this decision.

The Smashburger veggie burger itself was as expected, a mushy mess salvaged by the egg bun, the cheese & the truffle oil. I wonder if they had cows taste-test the burger, & the cows were like MOO, it's OK, thanks for our lives or something. I mean, I dunno. If your granola friend has been trying to get you to convert to veg, this wouldn't be the burger she would be having you try.

The service was great but Smashburger, please make a good veggie burger.",qUk-Qa1JYnuK4VmmEbSYsA,6,3,3,nhgmHygATqP78TwzbPDuUQ
