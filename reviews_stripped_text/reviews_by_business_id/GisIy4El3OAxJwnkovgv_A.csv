Last week my kids, husband and I waited in line for over 35 minutes, while two people stood in the back texting and goofing off. I was infuriated. Tonight, there were three people working, but they were so stoned and wreaked of marijuana. I wouldn't care so much, except they didn't have a manager to get me change for a $100. Ok I was like whatever, I'll walk somewhere else and get change. It took me so long because nobody wants to just give you change ya know. There were people behind me waiting and the nice man in his army uniform paid for my meal to keep the line moving. I totally appreciated that but, he should not have had to do that! I should have been able to pay for his meal instead since he is serving my country. They need to get this HDOAS back on track! My kids always ask for their lemonade and I hate having to deal with bs every time. Where are the managers, were are the owners?!",eMBRNc3DpjlgJUUcpfemlQ,2,1,1,KPo1wkA5eUttDHYDw9AJmw

They sell a souvenir cup that's slightly larger than the large cup but gets you $2 refills when you bring it back. What a deal! Sometimes I forget to bring it though :(

Love their turkey dogs and cheese on a stick. I don't know what it is, but they're just better than corn dogs elsewhere...must be the batter. The employees here are always friendly and serve your food/drinks with a smile on their face. They even warn you how hot your food is going to be because it comes fresh out of the fryer and onto a tray. 

Wish their pricing was a little lower though, but oh well they know I'll be back regardless! If you come here often be sure to ask for a stamp card so you can work your way up to a free item.",zBi_JWB5uUdVuz3JLoAxGQ,1,1,5,fbjnn0Ofcqbue0ZF81Bchg

I ordered off the ""Fresh Made to Order $5.55 "" menu and it hit the spot. One cheese dog and one corn dog for me pleassssee!! Staff was nice, offered me a receipt, offered to sign me up for rewards program, and said thank you. 

Food was exactly was I was expecting. 100% hit the spot!!

The seasoning salt is simply delicious. Not to mention the portions are huge. Sure the prices are mall food prices but I would choose these fries over anywhere else, especially nasty McDonald's. The lemonade is also very delicious and the employees offer samples every time I go.  The frozen is my favorite. My only complaint is that blue raspberry lemonade was discontinued :( so sad. Everything is made fresh right behind the counter so you can see it, you know it's gonna be good. The employee Noelle was by herself and she handled everything very well, everything was perfect.",-YV1yESQXqR3vpIgBjKDsw,1,1,5,_YebOJsoYA0YK-7qMxZRsg

What's worse than  ""cold"" hot dog on a stick?? A cold cheese dog!!

5054123,2014-02-28,1,GisIy4El3OAxJwnkovgv_A,"Not gonna lie, I never eat the food here because I know it's just okay. I don't really crave hot dogs! (But sometimes the funnel cake when I have a sweet tooth!!) 

The ONLY thing I buy from here is LEMONADE. Ohhhh..lemonade. It makes me thirsty just thinking about it! It comes in three flavors: regular, lime, and cherry. I don't get frozen because it doesn't give me a full blast of the flavor! Every. Single. Time. I get food from another restaurant in the mall, I will never order a drink. I always buy lemonade from Hot Dog on a Stick, because it's so tasty and sweet! It just makes you feel good and satisfied on the inside :) 

My favorite flavors are lime and cherry! The taste can be a bit sweet if you're not really into sugary drinks. And it is a bit expensive, but I feel like its worth it when you're washing down whatever food you ordered in the mall!

Also, I suggest not to sit near Hot Dog on a Stick while you're eating because when the workers are smashing lemons from time to time, it's a really off-putting sound! It actually scared me at first haha!",OoyQYSeYNyRVOmdO3tsxYA,3,3,4,KVEZ7bRmSDTa7V2yH3WD5g

I have gotten the American cheese kind, as well as tried the hot dogs. I'm not a fan of the hot dog, really, but the cheese one is good as long as its straight out of the fryer. Any later and its soft and icky. I like the lemonades- perfect when it's hotter than Hades outside.",6w6pXL1N1q9RkmG6b4Su6g,2,1,3,pCdYQrJ6fhm5B_bGmH0NZA
5638901,2017-10-10,0,GisIy4El3OAxJwnkovgv_A,"Let me just start with the fact that there's never anyone present at the front whenever I come here. The person just randomly comes from the back and doesn't greet you. The first time my corn dog was not cooked all the way meat was cold and the dough was still gooey! This second time the food was actually good but as soon as I got my food the guy working went straight to the back and then later came out to cook his food and missed about 4 customers in between time. Where is the customer service?? Who is the manager lol smh. Don't expect to get anything fast at this location.

5715397,2016-10-03,10,GisIy4El3OAxJwnkovgv_A,"Visited on Saturday 10/01/2016 at 8PM.  $10.12 got me a corn dog, a cheese dog, an order of fries, and a lemonade.  

The poor gal working was all alone but despite being short-handed she was still so friendly and she was handling those orders LIKE A BOSS.  I was really impressed with her multi-tasking skills...I'd watch her take an order, then go check and begin foods, then come back and take an order, etc.  That woman needs a raise. I'm sure the employees hate it but I love their little primary-colored uniforms and especially the hat.  

Everything I had to eat was hot and fresh.  The fries were crispy and had a nice seasoning salt on them.  I would compare the fries to McDonald's in shape but much crispier. 

Their lemonade is amazing.  You can get it in different flavors but my favorite is the classic original.  It is not too sweet but tart and always ice cold.  I never get heartburn from it which is unusual for me but I think it's because it's so fresh.  

My favorite thing here is the cheese on a stick...and yes it's as white trashy and fattening as it sounds.   You can choose American cheese, spicy pepper jack cheese, or mozzarella cheese.  My favorite is the American cheese version because it tastes exactly like a grilled cheese but it's on a stick and deep fried....you can't go wrong with that.  The outside is like a regular corn dog but the inside has gooey melty cheese.  I feel very aroused just thinking about it again.  For my next wedding anniversary I'm requesting a bouquet of cheese on a sticks instead of flowers.

5876937,2013-10-12,0,GisIy4El3OAxJwnkovgv_A,"I don't know why I was so disappointed here. I love corn dogs. I similarly love deep fried corn dogs. When I woke up craving a corn dog I headed down to visit the GF and cheat on her by going to the competition. 

There was one girl working and she was taking one order, collecting the money washing her hands and then cooking the order and repeating. I was 4 orders deep and had to wait at least 10 mins if not closer to 15 mins to place my order. How hard would it have been to take two or more orders, cash them out wash your hands and then prep and serve the orders? Would have cut my time in half and made my experience much better. 

Once received the corn dogs were a little over cooked to my liking and the breading was very thin. Not sure how they make the thick breading at the fairs I go to but I'd recommend they learn, its half the fun of eating a corn dog. The cornmeal!

 The flavor was good and most likely the only redeeming quality of my trip here...that and the fact they are now selling all beef hotdogs; did make me wonder and worry what they were using previously.

 I'd give them another try the next time I'm craving a corndog but not if there is a line and only one person working.",Yg08tRMxm0eaL-rXyNIAHw,1,0,3,EQK79urqCdoqLA5SEizq_Q
