367312,2009-11-06,0,VvHehcPhB80njPRrvdBZmg,i wanted to try out this place cuz i read the 2 reviews and read an article about them. i called them at (702)888-6888 to ask what their hours were and got a voicemail. i guess that should've been my first clue. good business would've been to leave a message on your voicemail that says your hours AND that you were going to be closed for approximately 10 days to prepare for your grand opening. (that's what the sign on the door said) dunno if i will trek over to hendo to try this again.,PQ6-FZpUn2oFLyBGvdiG3w,1,1,1,Lh8sn0Shoau_gCTo-sGLEQ

The price is very enticing since it's cheaper than Texas de Brazil (TdB) but not even at that price I can even begin to think anyone could recommend this restaurant to any of his friends. To be honest if you want to piss someone off tell them to go to this restaurant. They will hate you for it.

The Service is less than desirable but that wouldn't matter if the food was any good.

Instead of having a buffet so you can go and chose what you need for your salad and sides you have to keep on asking for refills of these tiny portions they keep bringing only when you're completely done with the one you had to share with your other friends. It's annoying to have to wait for the waiter because the meat servers actually get offended if you ask them to get you a refill of the mashed potatoes that should be called garlic with some mash potatoes added to it. It's hilariously bad. 

At the beginning I got a horrible tri-tip that I actually took out of my mouth and placed it on a plate. I literally couldn't continue chewing it.  I thought maybe I got unlucky and got the bad one first then came the sirloin and it was actually worse then came the supposedly Brazilian sausage that should be called the hot chili Mexican sausage. Things got worse and worse. Me and my three friends were so surprised at how bad the food was that we started betting at whether the next one would be worse or not I mean we were having fun and a good laugh at something that was actually sad in so many ways.

The food is so bad there is no way to describe it and then you get hit by the check. At $35 per person with only sodas the joke was on us. I felt ripped off for real. We were all talking on the car on our way back commenting how incredible it was that a restaurant could screw not one dish but every single one and in such a bad way.

If you want to get some good Brazilian food DO NOT GO THERE. Go to the Texas de Brazil hands down. I bet if you don't listen to this advice you'll come back here and say "" Oh My God I should have listened to you!"" :-)",knkobvCLI5chhms0u9d7hA,0,0,1,W0TxlIQ3vRsJKo3ZOyZJMA
3472018,2009-10-20,0,VvHehcPhB80njPRrvdBZmg,"This is a tough update because I really like this place... but... I invited some friends here the other day and the service completely failed :(

My first experience two months ago was great, but this is my second visit and they did not have enough servers and the kitchen could not keep up.  Everything came out at a snail's pace, and we were sometimes waiting maybe 10 minutes with our plates completely empty in the middle of the buffet-style meal.  Towards the end of the meal, we requested more rice and vegetables, and the waitress informed us that they were all out... of everything.

She explained that they had been overrun with customers that night and offered to take 10% off our bill.  She also explained that she was not even a waitress, but the bartender, and was only filling in because they were so understaffed.  I take pity on the servers for that, but not on management.

To be fair, it was a Tuesday night and they had two large parties -- one with maybe 25 people -- so they may have been caught off guard.  But either they should have been prepared or they shouldn't have seated us.

I still thought the food was very good, and I have high hopes for this place if they can get their staffing and service consistent.  They're relatively new and I'll definitely try them again in a few months, but for now they lose a star.  I hope my next visit allows me to give it back.",xbLcAUEQSFGK0KOwf_U8aw,0,0,3,-H2WVabsS90YLjtLTlgSPg
4956523,2009-10-11,0,VvHehcPhB80njPRrvdBZmg,"Great new meat lovers restaurant. Typical ""Green-Yellow-Red"" method of controlling the continuous stream of grilled meats. Gauchos serve 13 different cuts and selections of meats, all on skewers. Dinner starts off with a soup of the day, then salad. Sauces, mashed potatoes, squash, and other vegetables are provided for the main course. Meats are cooked to perfection however the chicken breast was too dry for our liking. Service was timely and continuous. 

For a special treat you must try one of their sorbets. The presentation alone is impressive.

Meal without drinks and desert is a fixed price of less than $30.00. A real bargain for quality food and service all in a perfect surrounding.",wJMKvunzHELMZy6K-Z8qbA,1,0,4,caIvKJ5r6ICukjH-g6EVow
5308425,2009-09-13,0,VvHehcPhB80njPRrvdBZmg,"I've only had experience with one other Brazilian rodizio style restaurant before, but after trying Brazil Brazil I can guarantee I won't be going back to that one (Samba) again.

The food is served in four courses: soup, salad, sides, and meats. But the sides actually stay on the table as the meats come so I guess it's three even though they say it's four. 

-Our soup was roasted red pepper, similar to the kind sold in stores but with more of an orange color.

-The salad was mixed greens with carrots dressed with olive oil and vinegar.

-The sides included Brazilian cheese bread (these little bread puffs stuffed with cheese that were amazing!), Portuguese beef casserole, potatoes, carrots, spinach, fried yucca, plantains and fried bananas, served with a variety of dipping sauces and yucca flour.

-The meats were all flavorful and cooked well, though I can't remember what many of them were called. I remember a tri-tip sirloin, a garlic-spiced beef, spicy chicken, parmesan chicken, and sausage. I ate A LOT more but I don't remember what I had.

The atmosphere beats that other restaurant by far. When we got there they were playing some mellow bossa nova music, but a band later walked in and played a mix of Latin Jazz and American Pop (Lionel Richie's ""Hello,"" for example). 

For $29.99 a person, the quality and quantity of food you'll eat, along with the classy but relaxed atmosphere, make Brazil Brazil worth the cost.",ZLkDc6CZMRILGql5mmqeDQ,2,0,4,zpc_vWVy1T5nbyfTeifCDg
