26266,2010-04-23,0,duw-3Aj7gAKbQG-isS5UtQ,"Verandah is the best breakfast/ brunch buffet in Vegas, hands down.  It is more pricey than most other places on the strip, including the Bellagio and Wynn.  That being said, the quality of the food and the setting could not be better.  It's located in the Four Seasons hotel and has a very tropical feel.  They have outdoor seating on gorgeous patio furniture, with palm trees and misters that create a lush and humid environment.  The buffet does not have the plethra of selections that you would find at Bellagio or others, but they are not going for the cheesy Vegas buffet experience where you wait in line for hours and gorge yourself.  The food is beautiful- a huge selection of pastries including plain and almond croissants, pain au chocolat, fruit danishes, cinnamon rolls, brioche, muffins, and lovely coffee cakes.  They have bagels with lox and all the fixings.  There is fresh fruit plated in glass cups (greek yogurt and granola parfaits, macerated citrus segments, fresh seasonal berries, etc).  There is a made-to-order egg and omelette station and about 10 chaffing dishes with eggs benedict, breakfast meats, vegetarian quiches and fritattas, cheese blintzes, and a delicious bread pudding.  Best of all, there is a donut station with a chef preparing hot cake donuts by the minute and glazing them with icing, chocolate, coconut, nuts, etc.  They are small, crisp, delicate and delicious.  Your brunch is served with their fresh juice of the day (which is usually a blend of melons and berries).  They use iced tea ice cubes in their iced tea, a major plus in my book.  Whenever we have peeps in town or it's a special occasion, this is the first place we head to.  Brunch at Verandah is not to be missed.",dEgO4_n8thLMbG1dKfFMHg,2,1,5,IpeNvPN6DYYPqme6L-1EtA

One day the buffet was set up, and it looked like it was very nice and had a lot of unusual items, but we don't eat enough any more to justify the ""investment"".  I had the corned beef & pastrami hash browns, which was very good and a bit unusual in that the hash was more like very tiny french fries.  It was much better than Carnegie Deli's (in LV or NYC), and reminded me more of how good the pastrami hash at Stage Deli used to be, although it's not the same, of course.  My wife had the tiramisu croissant, which was very good but is more like a dessert than breakfast.  We ate inside that morning, and the service was very good.

A couple of days later, we had breakfast outside, and it seems to take a while to get the waiter's attention and he was nowhere to be found a couple of times when we had a request.  My wife had the quinoa and muesle (or similar), and didn't expect the quinoa to be cold.  That was a bit unusual.  I had the eggs Benedict, which was quite good, but didn't come with toast or any other sides, which seems unusual as well.

My wife had coffee both days, and didn't remark one way or the other upon it.  I had herbal tea, as my metabolism can't tolerate caffeine, and for both of us there were pots placed on the table for us to refill from.

Easy to make reservations on Open Table, and when I called to update the reservations to a later time they were super polite and accommodating - especially considering the reservation was for a group of 8 (which wound up actually being 7).

First, the food - that's what you really go for, right?  The menu looks great; unfortunately, some of the dishes don't deliver.  Although I did like my salad first-course, others in the group weren't so lucky.  One person's scallops were over-cooked and rubbery, and the caprese salad was so salty it couldn't be eaten.  More mixed reviews on the main dishes.  The short-ribs were a hit and people liked the oxtail ravioli, but the skin on my sea bass was soggy instead of a nice, crunchy texture, and someone had undercooked chicken that had to be sent back.

The worst part of the evening?  The service.  Our waiter came by twice in roughly an hour - first to give us menus, then to take our orders.  Even though it took about 90 minutes to get our dinners, he never came back to ask if we wanted more drinks, say it's coming, etc.  And there were only 4 other parties in the restaurant!  When we finally complained to the manager, there was no apology - simply a head nod.  Truly disappointing.  The apology only came awkwardly during the THIRD conversation with the manager, after the raw chicken had to be sent back.  Then came the after dinner chocolates - they brought 6. For a group of 7. This was possibly the worst service I've ever experienced.  It's a real negative mark on the Four Season's luxury brand.

We had breakfast here each day and it was consistent and enjoyable, including both the a la carte menu and the buffet.  Highlights of the buffet on the day I ate include salmon and crab at the omelet bar and a donut bar!

We had lunch once and it was, for the price especially, remarkable.  The trio of tuna is great, and useful especially as a light lunch if you're going on to something big that night, and we also enjoyed the crab salad.

I have been searching for a nice establishment to have afternoon tea service in a formal setting, similar to what you would do in England. Yes, tea and crumpets. 

The Verandah was ok. Although it is the Four Seasons, it was not as fancy as I had hoped.  It was very professional and we ate off china and used real silver spoons, the atmosphere felt like a restaurant rather than a parlor or Ritz Carlton (which no longer exists in Vegas).

The food was good, the tea selection was acceptable, and the service was good. Just lacking the ambiance.  It's not like the Titanic movie afternoon tea.

I had the huevos rancheros and it was mediocre at best.

531204,2013-06-15,0,duw-3Aj7gAKbQG-isS5UtQ,"I just came back from my second meal at Verandah since they got a new executive chef, Antonio Minichiello, who started last September.  The first visit, I had the $45 prix fixe menu (not sure if they're still offering the same deal) -- salad, salmon, and a very interesting dessert (cow milk fritters with fresh strawberries and strawberry sorbet), all excellent.  I'm forgetting the specifics now, but all in all, it was a terrific meal for much less than you'd expect to pay at the Four Seasons.

I ordered a la carte tonight. First, the special appetizer, fried softshell crab in a pear prosecco sauce.  I was a bit disappointed at first because the crab was on the small side, but then I remembered that this ain't the Cheesecake Factory, where just one appetizer could easily be dinner for two Europeans.  In other words, appetizers shouldn't get you full, or anywhere near, since most of your meal is still to come.  After a couple of decades in Boston, I had plenty of softshell crab, and this was the best ever:  light and crispy, not the slightest bit oily, with a sauce that complemented the crab instead of overwhelming it.  I had a second appetizer, capesante, seared scallops in two different sauces - rhubarb compote and aioli - both very good, although I found the scallops a bit salty (granted, I have a low salt taste).  For a main course, I tried the house special pasta: La Pasta Cotta Nel Vaso (pasta cooked in a jar, in case your Italian's rusty) -- artichoke pasta with scallops, calamari, langoustine, shrimp, tomato, and basil -- and yes, it is actually cooked in a mason jar.  You're actually supposed to eat it from the jar, although they do give you a pasta dish if you want to partake more conventionally.  I was a bit dubious, but the dish was superb.  Most important, the pasta was done perfectly al dente, not the watery overcooked mess that most restaurants serve.  All the seafood was also cooked perfectly, so that everything was tender and flavorful.  Cooking it all in a mason jar seems like a gimmick, but there must be something to it because all the flavors combine beautifully.  For dessert, I went a bit crazy and ordered the dessert for two:  tiramisu in a crème anglaise, topped by 3 scoop(lets) of gelato in a caramelized wafer bowl, topped by a county fair-sized fluff of orange cotton candy.  My eyes popped when I saw this huge dessert coming my way, but fortunately, most of the mass is just the cotton candy.  The tiramisu was excellent, as were all three flavors of gelato (white espresso, rum crunch, butter pecan - all made in house).  The caramelized wafer bowl was buttery, just the right sweetness, and perfectly crispy, and even the cotton candy was surprisingly good.

Others have criticized Verandah for its poor service, but I experienced only top-notch service both nights I went.  My server knew every single item on the menu down cold.  He, along with the food runner and assistant server (actual title?), were terrific.  Service was of equal caliber during my first visit as well.  Chef Minichiello has made Verandah the best Italian restaurant in town, in my opinion.  With a great staff and a beautiful room, it's one of the best restaurants in town, period.  Oh, and it's not nearly as expensive as you would think for being in the Four Seasons.",hJ6jVSwzPLUH_SVou4is7w,0,0,5,0sn8JGL7mqWVztmBwvG9QQ

Arrived with my pal about 20 minutes pre-reservation to have a drink.  Missed Happy Hour pricing by mere minutes (looks like they offer some really good deals).  Sat at a table about 7 feet from bar.  Not crowded.  We were ignored for almost 15 minutes.  There went any desire to get that bottle of prosecco.  BTW - we were dressed  very nicely and were in PLAIN SIGHT of bartenders and servers.  Not a great start.

Friends joined us - seated on the verandah.  Lovely setting, perfect temp, etc.

Meal was one glass each of sparkling wine and then the five courses.  

Overall it was a very nice meal with great friends.

Pros:
Setting was relaxing and peaceful
Food was nicely presented and short ribs were melt in your mouth delicious as was gouda fonduta.  I wanted to grab my friends' plates and eat theirs
Bill was crazy low - nice change from everything else in Vegas

Cons:
Indifferent service all around - from oblivious bartending staff to our server(s). Server was not rude or incompetent - just not at level I expected from this venue.
Food was quite salty and as I love me some sodium - I was fine but we all joked about how puffy and bloated we expected to be the next day.  And we were.
One friend had an allergy that she advised server about from the start - they managed to work around it on one item that didn't even mention it as an ingredient but then for dessert - where it was listed - they delivered 4 of same and we had no clue if one of them had been doctored for her.  And no server to ask for clarification.

Behold my Vegas luck, someone with a group of 14 canceled and we would have a nice semi-private room for our group. Only downside would be that it would be inside. If you have a semi-small group or don't mind waiting, I'd recommend trying to get seated outside on a nice day. It's right next to the Four Seasons pool and seems very relaxing. 

Some people in our group ordered a la crate and some got the brunch buffet. Two most impressive contraptions of the meal: the Donut Robot and the fresh peanut butter maker. The donut robot makes donuts by itself and the only need for a human being is to dip the donuts into toppings (but I'd recommend just trying a plain donut fresh). They had an omelette station that had both crab and lobster meat. Traditional breakfast buffet fare including frittatas, bread pudding, lots of fruits and pastries, etc... They also had fresh squeezed juices. 

I guess the only negative was the cost. +$40 for the brunch buffet after tax/tip. Being in the Four Seasons hotel, I guess this is to be expected. However, still a reason for a dock of a star. I haven't really eaten at the other casino buffets for breakfast/brunch, so I can't really compare.

This is, hands down, my personal favorite place to get afternoon tea.  Why?  First off, this place is located in the Four Seasons (self-explanatory).  Second, due to the location of the Four Seasons (it is at the end of the strip) it is a more secluded hotel, and this restaurant is at the corner of the hotel thus making it a nice quiet spot from all the hustling and bustling of Las Vegas.  And lastly, the service as well as all the other desserts and sandwiches are simply top notch.  For example, even though there is an actual reason you need to reserve a spot in advance as they only make enough for the people coming, the staff was nice enough to place an extra order of scones for us to take to go.  They even packed extra jam and devonshire cream after we inquired as to whether or not they sell their jam to the public (which they don't or at least not at this location).  Furthermore, they have a medium size list of teas available, which is more than enough for me as I tend to stick with black tea when I do afternoon teas.  As for the other desserts they got the usual salmon sandwich, vege sandwich, chocolate cake, et cetera...  And yes this place is kind of pricey but really you are in Vegas and in a Four Seasons hotel at that to boot.  

Definitely my favorite place for afternoon tea.  I always try to at least go every time I go to Vegas but I think their afternoon tea is only on weekdays so call ahead and make your reservation before you go.",Y3A5aF0d-rbWK8bk48h3Lw,4,0,5,XrwN9Lte1mmiCM-ZOMsdrw

I ate from the buffet. My favorites were the brioche French toast, the breakfast pizza, the mini Mexican tortilla, cheese & chicken skillet, the scones, the strawberry pancakes, the frittata, the fresh donuts, and the diy chicken waffles. Even the coffee and juice were delicious.

I've been to London & love their Afternoon Tea, and wanted to do something similar with my friends. From the reviews, I thought Verandah would be a perfect fit. We arrived early & were told we had to wait until 3pm. Waiting 15 mins was fine. We were taken to our table shortly after 3pm, and served water. Then we waited. And waited. And waited. It was 20 mins before anyone took our tea order.

Now...the place was NOT busy. Our table of four was the biggest table they had in the room we were in, and the front room had maybe three tables. What really bothered us was the table of two that came in several minutes after us for their tea, that was served before us. Um...not cool. My friend's water glass was empty several minutes & several waiters rushed past us so fast we couldn't flag them down to ask for more. I contemplated getting up to serve her water myself, but finally a slower moving waitress walked past & I was able to ask for water.

I realize the experience is supposed to be a relaxing one, but when you can't keep water glasses full & you're serving tea and food to people who arrive later than your other customers, that's just not the service I would expect from the Four Seasons.

Impeccable service.  Bomb diggity.  $40/pp.  Just go. 

My boo surprised me with a breakfast buffet and from the minute we walked in, I felt we were treated like high rollers.  
Verandah is situated inside the Four Seasons and right beside the pool.  Should you wish to people watch and bask in the sun, then the verandah of the Verandah (see what I did there?) would be your ideal spot.  Otherwise, I'd suggest you bathe in the luxury of elegant decor, white linens, and a relaxed eat-at-your-own-pace ambiance of  their indoor dining area.  
You are not obligated to partake in their breakfast buffet, as there was separate menu  that featured the usual breakfast fare.  
After being seated by the friendly hostess, our server took our drink orders.  We then galloped to the buffet area to feast!

The buffet was relatively small Eggs Benedict, eggs, and bacon.  I was surprised with the quality of Eggs Benedict.  I'm not a connoisseur of EB, but damn.  The biscuit was crunchy!  I did not expect it to have texture if it had been sitting in a food heater/water bath all morning.  That was a good surprise.

I'm not a fan of drip coffee, but damn, even the coffee was good.  

Some stand-out items were the scrambled eggs with smoked salmon, peppered bacon, French Toast with berry compote, vanilla bread pudding, and assorted pastries like blueberry scones with lemon curd.  Yummy in my tummy!

Also Included in the buffet menu was custom-made omelettes.  I ordered mine made with spinach and other standard accoutrements you would put in any omelette.  One thing I MUST note  was my spinach was cooked PERFECTLY in the omelette.  In all other omelettes I have had that included the green, leafy powerhouse, the spinach had been cooked into nothing and offered no *textural* contrast to my omelette.  Oh, but at the Verandah, you see, my omelette was perfection! 

Another area that exceeded my expectations was the efficacy and professionalism of the staff.    My coffee was constantly refilled and other servers (including our own) periodically asked about our food and our experience without being too invasive or too fake.  
I was having trouble cutting the biscuit of my Eggs Benedict with a dull dinner knife and our server noticed and handed me a steak knife so that I could cut through the biscuit (I couldn't, but I much appreciated the gesture).
It just seemed that everyone we encountered was genuinely interested in our dining experience!  That's always a plus for me and makes for a glowing review on Yelp.",3fvZdZGNi_87rm5aq_a80w,4,2,5,RM5vQwn_hH-KutxZdasuJw

Walk to your left and enter the Verandah. Do yourself a favor and ask for the outdoor seating. You can hear birds chirping, soft relaxing music, a peaceful waterfall, heat lamps, covered patio so no sun in your eyes. I instantly transported myself to the 4 Seasons in Maui which I fell in love with. Towards the end of our breakfast the pool was filling up. I think the earlier you get to the restaurant the better so you're not experiencing the pool crowd. Even then there were no screaming kids, still relaxing.

On to the food, its hard for me to decline a customized omelette bar. The ingredients were good but I think a homemade salsa would be much more appropriate for the high price tag we were paying. This was Pace picante salsa straight from the jar. Also a few more gourmet items such as sun dried tomatoes or goat cheese would have been nice. The highlight for me were the mushrooms and spinach which were cooked perfectly.  On to the hot items. Eggs Benedict was delicious, frittata, quiche, corned beef hash, scrambled eggs with salmon, scone with lemon curd, mascarpone cheese blintz with roasted apple glaze, vanilla bread pudding (couldn't try this because it was in a such a big bowl, wish they had a mini size), applewood smoked bacon, peppered bacon, guava pancakes, and more. 

There were a bunch of pastries I did not touch. My husband got a pastry and it was rock hard. I'm thinking people don't waste their time on those pastries and it was old. 

On to the next section- bagels, breads, smoke salmon, capers, tomatoes,  onions and do not miss the honey roasted peanut butter made fresh!!! I asked and there are no other ingredients. It's outstanding! I enjoyed the mini banana parfait with candied walnuts and homemade granola. 

The juices included was fresh squeezed orange juice and fresh mixed berry juice (including watermelon, cantaloupe, and berries blended together). It was really yummy! They also offer coffee. The service was too notch. I never once had to ask for anything but it wasn't pushy and annoying. Drinks were filled and they walked away, I appreciated them not interrupting conversations. They were quick to take plates and asked if we needed anything but like I said it wasn't too much. 

Don't be like me and stuff yourself and not leave room for the fresh donuts!! Don't miss out on the donuts. Now take a bite of bacon then a bite of a mini glazed donut and now yours in heaven!!!

For $7 more you can have a Bloody Mary from the bar. You make it yourself with lots of complimenting toppings and additions!! They also have an option of unlimited Bloody Marys!

Love the secluded Four Seasons location, right around the corner of Mandalay registration, take the marble steps down & you're transported to understated elegance.

Two choices for dining: inside or alfresco, looking out into the private pool area.

Good:
*Iced tea w/iced tea cubes
*Lobster Salad, no lettuce, but so many ingredients, delicious & fresh
*Greens Salad, lovely light dressing & loved the mixed chartucerie
*Beef tartare, w/whole grain mustard, balsamico & micro greens
*Salmon w/lentils & a wine reduction, rustic, seared perfectly

Alright:
*Amuse, prosciutto & melon shooter, an interesting take on the traditional appetizer, the melon was in liquid form, too sweet for my palate.
*Halibut w/sundried tomatoes & olives, fish was nice, but bland, tomatoes and olives were not a nice marraige w/the halibut.

The food is always great, they let me substitute items on the menu, service is almost always good, and they have mini donuts. Also, their iced tea is the BEST and comes with iced tea ice cubes, so when they melt, they don't dilute the tea. And no packet sugar/sweetener here, replaced by simple syrup. Fancy!

I went there recently for dinner. I planned to meet a friend for lunch but she had to cancel at the last minute. I had been looking forward to it for days, so I was bummed and my kind hubby offered to take me there for dinner (one of the many reasons why I love him, lol).

Dinner was great! Ordered the fritto misto (calamari) to start. Fried perfectly and accompanied by a yummy marinara sauce. I had the branzino for my entree, which was delicious. It came with whipped potatoes but I substituted rice (see 2nd paragraph). A side order of truffle potatoes had just enough truffle flavor - many places claim to have truffle _____ but when you get it, you can't even taste the truffle. Not so here.

My mission:  To order the wonderful and flavorful corned beef and pastrami hash I ate on my last visit in '08.  My friend and I made reservations just to be on the safe side, I mean who knows how busy a restaurant may or may not be on Sunday morning (hint:  don't worry if you DIDN'T make reservations for Sunday breakfast).  

At first I thought we were going to be late because Las Vegas Blvd was closed for the marathon and so the police were diverting traffic elsewhere, in this case we made a u-turn and went back in the opposite direction we came from.

Thankfully we made it on time to for our 8am reservation.  One of the best things I've come to appreciate about Verandah is its location AWAY from the hustle and bustle of the Strip.  Since there isn't a casino in the Four Seasons, guests and visitors alike can enjoy the peace and serenity this restaurant has to offer.  And besides this tranquility, their service is just simply impeccable as well.  Everyone from the hostess to the servers make you feel very welcome and treat you like you're one of the Ocean's 11.

But now let's talk about the most important meal of the day:  Breakfast.
Although there were other items on the menu that seemed appealing, as well as the buffet, we didn't deter from our mission and ordered our corned beef and pastrami hash.

2015155,2011-11-29,1,duw-3Aj7gAKbQG-isS5UtQ,"This is a review specifically on the Afternoon Tea that the Four Seasons Verandah offers.  I attended this place with my mother to celebrate her visit to Vegas and I decided to take her to afternoon tea here.  

Afternoon Tea here is offered from 3-4pm from Mon/Fri.
Holy cow.  After that experience at Bellagio, this was just -wonderful.-

The view out into the gardens was beautiful.  Their current theme of decor was Lilies and they were everywhere, designed into beautiful arcs that hung gracefully in a festoon that was minimalist and graceful.  We had a single table by the window and it was just a must.  It was summer and everywhere we gazed out our glass windows was lush green, green, green.  It was so tranquil and a firm glass of serenity that you rarely can find in Vegas which, to a certain extent, I will be more than happy to pay a ton of money for.  

Of course, being that was at one of the top-shelf properties here in Vegas, I knew going in that it was going to be not cheap.  But it wasn't outrageous and I didn't feel uncomfortable with the price.  The service was top-notch, the quality of the blend of tea, the scones and food was excellent, and I was very satisfied with the entire experience.  

When someone asks me where the best Afternoon Tea in Vegas is, I respond with this establishment, if that says anything.

***On my List of Afternoon Teas in Vegas, this is currently rated as #1.  Please check out my list of Tea Houses, both local and national to compare.**",lxf_9ap6K75XdSn97V8_Mw,7,1,5,ZSRNI8KqMpNkmAQ13mKyaA
2037116,2011-10-26,1,duw-3Aj7gAKbQG-isS5UtQ,"As far as the old system of dining goes, Verandah would probably be considered a ""5-star"" restaurant. Fancy setting, high prices, impeccable service, etc. However in the new food era, it's not just all about being hoity-toity. To get high stars in my book you need to have good food, and provide some form of value proposition. Based on my breakfast at verandah, I'd have to say that A-OK is proper. 

From entry to exit here, the service is beyond impeccable. They ask your name at the desk and you're subsequently greeted by name by every server that approaches you. Coffee is kept full, and it's white-glove the whole way. The setting is very pleasant - outdoors next to the Mandalay pool system - very elegant. 

The food itself, however, leaves a bit to be desired. It's okay, but for the price it could be a lot better. I sampled a plate of huevos rancheros that cost about as much as a dinner entree would cost at a decent restaurant. $5 for drip coffee is beyond the pale. Overall it was up in the mid-$20's for a simple entree+coffee breakfast. 

I guess I'm not someone who is willing to pay all that extra for exclusivity. Coming from Portland I want the food to be exemplary at that price - especially for breakfast, which is notoriously easy to prepare.

From valet to the front door every staff member makes you feel so important and appreciated which make you love where you're at. The Veranda is tucked in the back corner next to Charlie Palmers stake house with a newly renovated out door patio. The patio offers a great view of the pool and beautiful comfortable furniture to either lounge or enjoy your brunch on out doors. We chose to dine indoors because of our new born. 

Inside, the classic decor give off a very comfy vibe and dinning room was nicely lit. We did the Sunday brunch which is $39.99 per person which includes drinks and the bottomless Bloody Mary is an extra $20.00 I think. As you walk in they have an awesome omelette bar and a mini donut station. The food were delicious and very nicely set you. 

They had more then enough variety of yummy food to choose from. After everything they even brought out a plate of sea salt chocolate truffle that said Happy Birthday and it was so good and nice of them.

Every once in a while I am reminded that people just don't know any better. Adam Sandler movies as blockbusters. ""Harlem Shake"" as number 1 on the Billboard 100. And this restaurant getting 4 and 5 star reviews.

These are probably the same people getting snobby about buffets in other 5 star hotels. I admit, most buffets are forgettable culinary experiences, but this one takes it to a whole different level of bad.

I'll start mentioning I've stayed at the Four Seasons in the past and it is, in my opinion, the best hotel in Las Vegas, together with the Mandarin Oriental. Room decor is a bit outdated but I hear they're renovating so that's a good thing. No smelly casino floor to deal with, no crowds, all rooms are upper floors with a great view, and the most comfortable mattresses I've ever slept in. Great service. Worth the cost. 

This restaurant is a whole different story though. For $50 per head we got a cheese ""station"" (a plate with a few different types of cheese, most of them looked unhealthy, as if they've been sitting there for days), a berry ""station"" (three small bowls, straw, black, and blue), a charcuterie ""station"" (once again, a small plate with three different cold cuts), an omelet station (typical omelet ingredients, nothing I haven't seen at any other buffet with an omelet station), pastries, a donut station, bagels that felt like a strange combination of leather and wood (chewy like leather when you bite into it but feels like wood when you touch it), scrambled eggs (runny, tasteless, awful), assorted small plates with mystery food (dry chunks of meat, what I think was quiche but tasted like cooked plain yogurt with microscopic ingredients, and other stuff so bad I don't even remember what it looked or tasted like), and smoked salmon (the only thing worth mentioning, good salmon).

Bottomless bloody marys? Sure, as long as you don't mind playing bartender. Clamato in a bucket with ice, bottle of vodka, tabasco, veggies, bacon, and make it your damn self if you please. I don't mind getting my own food at a buffet (it is a buffet after all), but making my own cocktail? At a $50/person buffet? You must be kidding me.

They get two stars because their servers are top-notch, but great service doesn't compensate enough for their lackluster food to warrant a higher rating.

I won't equate the setting (and it is a great looking restaurant) into the review because most upscale Vegas hotel buffets have magnificent design these days. It's the norm, so it's not even worth mentioning.

Then realized there was an omelette station, dessert station, fruit, breads, etc. Our server was very nice and we got refills on orange juice, which was by the way the best and most fresh orange juice I've ever had.

Second, you have the option of ordering from a menu or the brunch option. The menu has a lot of great breakfast items and lunch items as well. We opted for the brunch, which comes with coffee, tea, or juice. I had a strawberry and banana juice.  I loved it! Mimosas are offered for an additional $12. The buffet had fresh fruit, coffee breads, parfait, oatmeal, bread pudding, sausage, bacon, pancakes, bread pudding, French toast, quiche, and etc. What I liked the most were the freshly made donuts very yummy! You can also have eggs made to your perfection. If you want something that's not out the waiter can have it made for you. We had the chance to be waited on by Leo. He was very professional and friendly. He made our experience even more great when my friend asked for blue berry pancakes. Overall it was a great place to have brunch.

I was wondering if I might of missed something because the food was about as good as a regular breakfast buffet at a sub-par venue.  The outside venue is nice but.... Maybe people don't get out much in Vegas because there are way better places to eat a brunch buffet.  The Buffet at Caesars and The Wicked Spoon at The Cosmopolitan are way better for around the same price.  There were five people in our party and one had a birthday and the total was $210.00 after tax and before tip.  My son said Mom you should gave me the $200.00 and went to eat at Sunrise Cafe.  Wow now I know how rich folks get taken advantage off.  I'll be eating at the other fore-mentioned buffets before I come back here.  One note I will say is that we could have just ordered of the menu and it would have probably been cheaper.

OK, if you insist.

We made reservations, but didn't need them, there was plenty of available seating.  The place has that ""undiscovered"" feel to it.  It's probably because of it's location, I don't know how much traffic they get.  But getting there was a breeze, pulled up to valet, turn to the left and a short 20-yard walk and voila!

I will absolutely come back in the summer when the stunning patio is open for diners.  That was the only disappointment.  But the interior is also lovely, and broken up a bit by sheers and dividers.

The margarita pizza (I think that's what it's called) - I thought this one wasn't great, though the girlfriend thought it was the best dish. The bread of the pizza felt a bit too soft, and the sauce plus pizza was lacking. Maybe I'm just being too picky since I'm biased towards NY pizza. 

Shrimp tacos - these were great, the shrimp was big and fresh, and the lemon and avocado sauce was interesting. I prefer the taco toasted a bit more, but overall I can recommend this dish. 

Seafood mac and cheese - This was the highlight of the lunch. They did not skimp on the seafood, with chunks of lobster, scallop and shrimp. I devoured it in minutes. Girlfriend did not enjoy it though, so it may be an acquired taste.

There's a reason why Verandah is located in the lobby of the 4 Seasons - your experience (food, service, ambiance) will be fantastic. And, that, it was for us. For starters, my man wanted lunch-type stuff, and I wanted breakfast, so the servers brought us both menus and said it would be no problem to serve either. Ah... I could get used to this... 

Star 1 - The Huevos Rancheros. Perfect combo of eggs, cheese, beans, and spices. Also, the fantastic servers (see Star 5 below) were able to whip up a spicier blend of the house salsa that is served as a side. After eating at a resto which prides itself on Mexi food (see my review of Hussong's) on the same weekend, I was pleasantly surprised at the authentic quality of this dish. 

Star 2 - the gluten free lemon pancakes. Yum and yum. You could taste the hint of lemon in each bite, but it was not too overpowering. Perfection. 

Star 3 - the mahi mahi soft tacos. Again, perfect fish-to-everything else ratio so that you could actually taste all of the ingredients and marvel at how well they worked together. Also, a special shout out to the accompanying guac. 

Star 4 - Beverages - First, let's start with the Latte, which I asked be served with a shot of hazelnut. This latte might just be the best I've had in Vegas. No sugar-additives needed, and it tasted very creamy, even though they substituted the real milk for almond milk. And (drum rolls please) -- their iced tea. With the iced tea ice cubes (so that the tea doesn't taste watered down), and the liquid sugar pour (so that each sip of tea tastes like the last one since the liquid sugar dissolves more quickly), it is deliciousness in a glass. 

Star 5 - Leo and Lucio - our servers. I should probably have broken them out into separate stars but I'm running out of stars here!! No request big or small was too much for them. The fact that we had 2 servers for 2 diners should alone tell you how far they will go to make sure you have a great meal. These two gents only helped make this meal that much more fantastic. 

Lest you think we are a couple of barbarians, we did have a special situation which allowed us to sample many dishes at the same time. No, we did not eat everything we ordered at one seating.... that said, these were some of the best leftovers ever!",cPifBB7Qbjs9PntPGOY9iQ,10,8,5,vZg0wE8s5X4kdyDU6l1fgQ

The standard fruits and cured meats, parfaits and yogurts were awesome too. If they wanted to kick up the quality of the cheese selection,  I'd like to suggest brining in Beecher's Flagship cheese from Seattle. Pair this with the cured meats... That would take it to another level, IMO.

There were 12 of us and we were all really happy with the food. The service was why only 4 stars was given. Took awhile to get someone to refill our drinks. At one point, I even had to search for a server to get refills. If they can tighten that up, they would get that 5th star for sure.

The scones were traditional English style scones that were flaky and buttery. There was Devonshire Cream, Raspberry Jelly, and Lemon Curd to top it off. The finger sandwiches, sesame and beet cones were savory. The bite-sized desserts were very good. This season, they had an Oreo Candy Cane Cheesecake. The menu also had remnants of fall with pumpkin and maple. As much as I do appreciate seasonal menus, I was over the fall pumpkin spice and the Christmasy candy cane flavors. 

The menu changes with the season. We will try again in the spring/summer. 

The tea I had was the Organic Assam, delicious with a bit of sugar and milk.

First, Verandah is set inside of The Four Seasons at Mandalay Bay.  The room itself isn't too big, but it opens up to the private pool at the resort, making it the perfect setting for lunch.

Four Seasons is known for its legendary service and it really shows here.  They even have a machine which makes ice cubes out of a few of the drinks you order.  That way when the ice melts, it doesn't dilute your drink!  Try that at home and see how impressive you are to your guests ;)

The lunch is 5-star hands down.  I always get the rib sandwich, which is always cooked to a perfect temperature and just melts in your mouth.  At $18 it's not cheap, but in many ways you pay for the wonderful atmosphere.  I also had the mini Klondike-like pops which are presented really well.

My dinner here was nothing special and a lot more expensive than lunch.  I had a steak (which I notice isn't on the menu anymore) that wasn't bad, but did not meet my expectations compared to the lunch.

The ambience of Veranda is a 10/10.  It is a beautiful setup with indoor/outdoor option seating.  The food is all great but nothing to die for.  It is pretty pricey at about 50 dollars a person.  I honestly feel like I can go to Dennys and then Pinkbox Donuts right after and get the same, if not better quality food.  They have a pretty good selection of food but nowhere near other buffets in Vegas that are easily half of the price for brunch.  In comparison, the Belagio brunch buffet is 25 dollars and has a MASSIVE selection of food to choose from.

Tips: 
- For when the weather is nice, make a reservation to sit outside on the shaded patio.

What a wonderful setting to enjoy a meal.  

The Scene... contemporary... a tad intimate but not romantic... upscale restaurant to enjoy a meal.

It was a bit busy today (Sunday around noon) for brunch/lunch... and Everyone wanted to sit outside... so we opted (since we were hungry) to sit inside.  Really wanted to sit outside... but... next time.

The Brunch... if you opt for the Buffet... it's $35 and includes tea, coffee and juice... we were not that hungry... so we ordered off the a la carte menu.  The buffet is lovely but not Huge and Overwhelming like other hotel buffets.  In fact, from the aromas and the entrees I saw... it looked very appealing and the omelet station was very nice where you can have custom omelets/eggs...  And the Bread / Pastry area made my mouth water... which is why I opted NOT to eat the Buffet... it would have been easy to go Hog Wild with all the good looking eats.

Ordered the Eggs Benedict.... which is served on a round Polenta Cake... I say ""Cake"" because the Polenta was more cake like... sweet and creamy at the same time... (it took the place of the typical starch of the English Muffin)... it came with a nice poached egg and candian bacon on top... you get 2 servings... along with a side of steamed asparagus.

My mother ordered the Mini Waffles... and while Mini... they were big on taste and very artfully presented.  She got 3... one with berries, one with dried cranberries and one with cinnamon butter.  

Our friend ordered the egg white frittata which came with a side of toaste which came in a basket.

For a Beverage... I ordered a Bloody Mary.... it's Darn good.... not as good as the one at THE cafe at THE hotel... but definitley Solid.

Mom had a Mimosa... she said it was ok.

The check for the 3 of us... with our 2 alcoholic beverages and 1 coffee was $92 before tip.... this is a bit pricey... but 1) it's the Four Seasons and 2) it's Vegas.

Note... if you order coffee... it's $5.50... personally I think that's a rip off but what do I know.",PV0VEhlmhc2BjzMZEbpWlg,2,2,4,U63ZpFNk5bKCddvTMi4-Jw

That alone is worth the overpriced buffet! And let's be honest, we are at Four Seasons here. Did you not expect overpriced? The service was also stellar, which made it easy to go with the 4 versus the 3 star rating. 
My boyfriend and I went here randomly because we have heard many good things. They offer an a-la-carte menu as well as the buffet. The menu had pretty tempting options like chicken and waffles, and lemon ricotta pancakes, but who passes up the above mentioned in an AYCE setting?! Not me! The buffet was $39, or $51 if you want unlimited mimosas or marys. Also, I must mention their OJ is totally fresh squeezed, or at least tasted so. The buffet included many hot items, meats, eggs, potatoes. But the real winner here was the omelette station and/or the donut station. Chef on hand to whip you up an egg dish of your choice. Love it. I also like all the yogurt, granola, and cheeses. You could taste the quality. 
We ended up ordering the pancakes, and they were fluffy, moist, and yummy. But not worth $20. I will stick to the buffet next time.

I had a cup of the bean soup and found it remarkabley good. My wife had the 8 ounce filet accompanied by fingerling potatoes with a mushroom medley and I had the braised short ribs with truffled patatoes. We were very impressed with this place and will keep this in mind for the future.,22guc0RON4M9xJa0u0wdCQ,0,0,5,S_MHJwBD7_11WUv0dBvS2g

3142157,2014-08-10,4,duw-3Aj7gAKbQG-isS5UtQ,"Let me start off by saying I was expecting more from Verandah at the Four Seasons.

When the hostess was walking us to our table, I noticed mini donuts sitting out and asked the hostess what they are for. She said they are for our guests and you can take one. I took two mini glazed donuts, even though, I did not like the fact that they were sitting out. It looked tacky and for The Four Seasons I expected a classier way of serving them like having them on a tray with serving tongs or keeping them in the back and having the waiter or hostess ask if we would like complimentary mini donuts. 

As soon as I sat down at the table outside I noticed it was dirty. There was a sticky red substance on the table and crumbs all over the table, chairs, and the surrounding floor. For the prices that they charge here, attention to detail can not be overlooked. While looking over the menu, I asked the waiter to bring over some bread and balsamic. The balsamic was low quality and tasted very bitter, the container looked like it had not been cleaned for quite a while and was just refilled before the first shift of the day. I decided on the summer spaghetti and my friend chose the Tuscan chicken salad. 

25 minutes later our food had not come out and it was hot as hell outside so we asked to be moved to the inside. As soon as we sat down we noticed it was just as dirty inside as it was outside. The table next to us had dried food particles on the side of it, booths were falling apart, and dust was all in the crevices. 

Summer spaghetti- not well seasoned had to add salt, crushed red peppers, Parmesan to make it passable

Chicken salad- lettuce tasted like paper towels, ingredients were low quality

I called over the manager to tell him how filthy the restaurant was and that my expectations were not being met. He proceeded to write everything down on a note pad and thanked me for my feedback. I ended up sending the chicken salad back and we shared the pasta. The manager sent over a few complimentary desserts- Nutella cupcake, cherries, Panna cotta with kiwi gelatin on top? Both the Nutella cupcake and Panna cotta were amateur. The cake part of the cupcake tasted worse than a store bought mix and the Nutella buttercream frosting was lacking any type of bold flavor. The cherries were not even good, I felt like the manager just threw together a dessert without thinking it through. 

When the bill came I noticed I was charged for the chicken salad. I told the waiter I should not be charged for an item I didn't eat. The manager comes back out and says you ate half the salad, and I said we tried the salad and realized it was not up to par. He ended up comping the meal for our sub par experience.

I hope to see improvement after the remodel is done because this restaurant needs to be refreshed and professionally detailed. 

I appreciated the manager comping the meal and bringing out a few desserts. However, after the lack of attention to detail at Verandah, The Four Seasons in Las Vegas is not what it's cracked up to be.",hulIBBzPsCaQDcoh_JgSBA,5,0,2,7cbfLShsv0cB_DrzbmZ1Nw

Service was courteous and everything we ordered was delicious. We started off with beef tartare, which was incredible. The signature pasta (served beautifully in a jar) and four cheese pizza also did not disappoint. For dessert, we had the panna cotta trio and loved each individual flavor. I am looking forward to coming back here again and trying out the brunch menu and happy hour specials!

The only negative was that they charged us for every single soda refill. Most standard restaurants don't charge for soda refills, so I would think for a high class restaurant where you're paying an easy $30+ per person, they wouldn't be so stingy on that sort of thing. Not to mention each drink was always loaded with ice, hence why we needed so many refills.",k8okFWX0acPR8c4L7XM55A,3,0,4,CJcUrItbZ6kIvyGfRNmzXg

We were comfortably sat at a round table that fit our group of 6 perfectly. Close enough to the pool but far enough away that you're not getting splashed. So what makes the Verandah Sunday brunch amazing, everything is miniature. 

What do I mean by miniature. Well, first off - don't even bother getting the a la carte menu. I'm sure its good, but you want the buffet. Trust me. But you never eat enough to pay for how much a buffet costs? I know, that's me too. This one is worth it.

Every lil food option is shrunk down so that you can try EVERYTHING and not be full. All of the meats, breads, fruits, yogurt, everything is in these little tasters so that you really can have everything. The in house homemade peanut butter is to die for as is the donuts being rolled right in front of you. 

Our waitress was wonderful. We didn't even want any champagne after the weekend we'd had and she was so on the ball with coffee and tea refills. Wonderful! Thank you Verandah and the Four Seasons for a wonderful end to a great weekend!",9EWFblLiRtv5nEbvFEuM8Q,2,0,5,wgUbt585n0-gtL0R0qJfsw

Verandah's menu allows one to either order a particular item for brunch or one can do the all you can eat brunch buffet. Although a bit pricey (I think it is around $50 with a mimosa), you definately get what you pay for with the buffet.

I have been coming here for years and have always had great service, my water, coffee and juice always refilled and my check handed to me at an appropriate time. I highly recommend the guava juice if they have it that day.

Some highlights of the buffet include: 1) omelette station that doesn't consist of a family of 5 pushing you out of the way and a really depressed omelette chef who burns your omellete; 2) delicious pastries including mini chocolate croissants; 3) flavorful apple sausage; 4) cheeses and charcutterie items; 5) fresh fruit galore; 6) and FRESHLY MADE MINI DONUTS :)

3256575,2014-05-07,0,duw-3Aj7gAKbQG-isS5UtQ,"This place is awesome!! It's pretty much hidden inside the Four Seasons hotel.  I've never been to the Four Seasons for all the years I've been to Vegas.  I decided to look for a really good Sunday brunch place. After searching for an hour or so, I decided to go to Verandah.

Finding parking without valet was a bit challenging at the Four Seasons.  I managed to find a huge parking lot that was south of the hotel.  I wasn't sure if it was for the Mandalay Bay beach resort or for the Four Seasons but I parked there anyways.  There didn't seem to have any signs at all what it was for.  If you drive towards the entrance of the Four Seasons, it's valet only.

The restaurant is located on the left after you go inside, past the PRESS cafe, which supposedly has really good cronuts.  When I got there on Sunday, it was already sold out, so I couldn't try it.

I booked a reservation with opentable before coming to the restaurant.  The server was pretty attentive and got me seated within a few mins of arriving.  The place wasn't packed at all but had a decent amount of people.

I seat outside, which was next to the pool area.  It was blocked off with some trees, so the patrons at the pool weren't bothersome.  After digging through the menu, I opted for the buffet brunch.  It was $40 with unlimited drinks, if you wanted Mimosas and such, you need to pay about $10 more.  

As I scoured through the food, everything looked good.  I tried almost everything and I had to say, it was good!  The scrambled eggs with salmon were perfect, not too much salt and had the perfect taste.  

The food varieties for the brunch ranged from banana pancakes, eggs benedicts to fresh made mini donuts (check the photo).  The waiter service was prompt and they automatically refilled my drink when I went for another round of food.

If OJ is bottled it's pasteurized NOT FRESH, and I could definitely taste that it wasn't fresh. The Frittata ($18) was a very small serving and completely flavorless, even the accompanying veggies were bland. We ended up paying $140 for a simple breakfast for 2.

Veranda has always been one of my favorite breakfast spots, especially if you can acquire an outside table. I've recently started eating a gluten free diet, but that hasn't deterred me from enjoying this hidden gem! 

They have your typical options such as eggs, omelettes, etc, but they go above and beyond by offering specialties like a Gluten Free Sampler and Gluten Free Mini Belgian Waffles (probably the best I've had)! Veranda is also very accommodating when it comes to transforming any dish into a gluten friendly option; I've done this several times with the Eggs Benedict. They also have gluten free toast! 

Gluten free options aside, Veranda offers a breakfast buffet with all of your usual offerings, but with plenty of specialties as well! They even have a Donut Bar which can be dangerously addictive.

It's $37 per person with buffet style and serves between 7am - 1pm. If weather is nice, I strongly recommend to have outdoor seating by pool. You can customize your own omelet with smoked salmon, chicken, ham, mushroom, spinach, tomato, bell pepper, Jalapeno, Swiss cheese, Cheddar cheese at omelet station. They also have a donut station, which you can customize your own donuts with different dipping sauces & toppings. It's fun to see how bakery chef prepares those mini donuts right in front of you. Everything I had today was pretty good. (Scones, mini banana pancakes, banana parfaits, caramelized peach with ricotta cheese, smoked salmon omelet, vegetable quiche, fresh squeezed watermelon & berry juicy, and even roasted coffee!!)

Having heard all of these great things about their brunch, we decided to try out the Verandah for dinner the other night. I was expecting great service, signature cocktails and tasty food.

Upon arrival, we were led to our table by Sherri (?) perhaps? A dark haired nice girl with an Sh- sounding name. I mention this because she was amazing in accomadating us when we were trying to decide which table to sit at, and oh so sweet!!

This is where the 5 star experience ends. We waited forever for our waiter, and then waited forever for our drinks, then waited forever for our food. I actually don't mind waiting awhile for food, because I like to savor my cocktail beforehand, but our waiter was pretty inattentive with that, I had to flag him down or remind him to bring us our drinks.

My hubby ordered bruschetta, soup, and a caesar salad- all very mediocre. They completely forgot to bring him a soup spoon until I got up and asked for one. He ordered the arrabiata pasta (said it was ok, nothing special). I ordered the chef's specialty ""Pasta in a jar', which sounded promising. It arrived around dusk, so I couldn't see the color of the shrimp and seafood so well, but I noticed it felt slimy and squishy in my mouth. I checked it out and the shrimp had a little pink but was mostly grey!! I don't know why I didn't just send it back but instead ate the pasta peices around the undercooked fish instead. It was truly, truly DISGUSTING!! I am hoping I don't get food poisoning from it, but I am sure it is probably flown in fresh daily, so at least there's that.

Also, I was expecting amazing ambiance, but it was basically like a glorified Tommy Bahama's minus the live music, situated around a swimming pool. Wish we would've gone somewhere else, what a waste of a date night!!",m6AS-3k8nevVj2rVnvb4JQ,2,0,2,e5YUlBBfbBLd7XXyfC0rrA
3842540,2016-04-03,1,duw-3Aj7gAKbQG-isS5UtQ,"My family and I ate here quite a bit during our stay at the Four Seasons in Las Vegas... we had breakfast here every day of our stay (4 days) and had lunch here once, as well as one other member of our family having dinner here one night while the rest of us were at a show. 

The layout is nice - plenty of inside seating at tables and some booths.  There is also outdoor patio seating by the outside private pool at the Four Seasons which is much smaller than Mandalay but is also quiet and not crowded at all so it's very pleasant.  

Breakfast here is VERY good with lots of options and very healthy fare - so I was pretty happy about that because usually there is only one healthy option and the rest is bad but it was a healthy mix of both.

I tried their healthy sampler which had some carrot/orange juice, a carrot blueberry whole wheat muffin, some quinoa muesli and some yogurt with berries.  It was DELICIOUS.  Best part was their fresh warm muffin - I adored it and ended up ordering it a few more times to have with my other breakfast choices.  My husband ordered their s'mores french toast and, while I usually dislike french toast, I ate some of his and loved it.  

We got their weekend breakfast buffet one day and enjoyed it very much - at around $40 a person it's fairly pricey but everything at the Four Seasons is (or in Vegas for that matter) so we went ahead.  The buffet also had some healthy options (tons in fact) and the standard fare like eggs, waffles, etc.  I liked that they had scones with lemon cream, mini chicken and waffles, a fresh omelet bar, a fresh mini donut bar, and tons of fresh fruits and pastries.  Very nice buffet with options to please any palette.  

We stopped in and had a nice lunch out on the patio one afternoon where I ordered their Salmon salad and enjoyed it very much - it was light and healthy with fresh ingredients.  My husband ordered a Bison burger I believe and I tasted it - also very good.

When we sat, our server went over the menu and told us we had the option of buffet or a la carte. I couldn't decide at first, there was a lemon ricotta pancake that had caught my eye on the a la carte menu, but the donut station sealed the deal for me.

I was impressed with the different buffet station, lots of different parfaits and yogurts, an omelet station, and they had all small plates so you could sample a little bit of everything. They also had a pastry station with a spot to make your own homemade peanut butter. 

Everything we had was really good. I would bump this up to 5 stars if they offered a bottomless mimosa on the menu. They had a bloody mary bar, but not all of are fans.

3877281,2018-03-15,3,duw-3Aj7gAKbQG-isS5UtQ,"**This review is only for afternoon tea service at the Veranda**

There are a few places to get high tea in Las Vegas, with the Veranda being one of them. We came at 3:00 pm on a weekday and we were one of only 2 other tables that came for tea service. While it was a beautiful day outside on the patio, unfortunately tea service was limited to stay inside.

For $35, you get a choice of teas to chose from, followed three tiers of plates of little snacks and sandwiches. Supposedly you work your way down from the scones to the savory sandwiches and bites, down to the sweet pastries. You can also add on an additional plate of food for $5, but the snacks were actually quite filling. 

My favorite was actually the scones, which were served with fresh Devonshire cream, lemon curd and house made strawberry preserves. They were some of the most buttery and crumbly scones I've ever had. These were followed by a number of tea sandwiches including smoked salmon, scallion caper cream cheese on pumpernickel bread, a cucumber & green olive tapenade on sourdough bread, chicken apple salad on sesame cone, and an egg & dill salad on tomato brioche. While they were all quite delicious, the breads all tasted somewhat stale and old. The tea pastries included a milk chocolate & candied orange velvet cake, a fresh strawberry & Sicilian pistachio tart (my favorite!), almond & pear tart, and a ""no bake"" vanilla bean cheesecake. 

For organic teas, there were a number of choices including orange pekoe, traditional English breakfast, organic assam, Russian earl grey, black currant, golden jasmine blossoms, golden chamomile flowers, mountain terry tisane, and silver leaf. I chose the earl grey, which had nice citrus notes of orange and lemon. Many commented that the tea was much better and stronger than the teas served at the Mandarin Oriental. 

You get a little more bang for your buck and it's $10 cheaper than the Tea Lounge at MO, but you miss out on the amazing view there. They also lack in some of the details with chipped tea pots and the such at Veranda that probably would not have gone unnoticed at MO.

3899325,2014-02-10,4,duw-3Aj7gAKbQG-isS5UtQ,"I visited Verandah on Saturday, Feb. 8th and was very disappointed. My sister made reservations for 12:30 brunch and we showed up a half hour early and they were able to accommodate us (there were very few people there). The valet parking is free which was nice. We decided to sit outside since the weather was nice. We walked through the dining room and saw all the delicious food available through the buffet. We got seated in a remote corner outside. 

When we sat down, we learned that the buffet was $40 (and even more if we wanted mimosas with it). For BRUNCH. I mean, yes it's Vegas, everything is overpriced and that's a common price. But this place is not in a highly trafficked area and is further south on the Strip, so I can't imagine why they think they should be charging that amount. We went out of our way to drive there when we could've easily found a better meal for the same price in or near our hotel (Cosmopolitan).

We decided to forgo the buffet and order lunch. We first ordered mimosas ($14 each! They certainly were not that good). A guy (not our waiter) came around offering coffee which, at any other restaurant, is complimentary, especially when we hadn't requested it and the cups they used were tiny espresso cups. When we got the bill, we saw they charged us $6 EACH - for coffee none of us even drank and was cold. $18 for nothing. So absurd. 

My sister ordered sushi and was very happy with it. I believe it was tuna. My friend ordered a salmon sandwich that she also enjoyed, and that came with sweet potato fries. My meal, however, was severely lacking. I ordered the chicken pesto sandwich. The pesto aioli was too goopy and thick and not tasty at all (and I consider myself a pesto connoisseur). It came with tomato jam, which I had never tried before, and found it was too sweet (I would have preferred regular tomato or even sun dried tomatoes). I substituted mozzarella instead of the provolone which made it better. But overall the sandwich was just ""ok"" and I found myself scraping a lot of the toppings off and just eating the chicken. My sweet potato fries were BURNED. The waitress came over right as I said to my friends ""these are burned"" and pushed them aside and she didn't say a word, didn't offer to bring more... nothing. 

The bill came - $125 for this mediocre lunch (before tip), including the overpriced coffees that we never ordered.  Considering how much they charge and the quality of the food, I would suggest finding another place for brunch (I can't speak for the buffet or breakfast). But if I'm going to be nickel and dimed, I at least want a good meal and decent drinks. I would not recommend Verandah.",LRx0RViGEAFX2UVJ5bNBRg,2,0,1,Lv4yIwxK9YVAQPMZdjAaiw

3972990,2014-12-14,4,duw-3Aj7gAKbQG-isS5UtQ,"This review is for dinner at the Veranda.  I've only had breakfast or brunch here.  The restaurant ran a Black Friday special.  Call on Black Friday, make a reservation for dinner some night in December, and receive 50% off.  That's a great deal!

I had a reservation for 6.  There was only one other table occupied when I arrived but it soon got busy.  My server was Jose and he proved., along with all the staff, to be pleasant, polite, and very efficient!

I ordered 4 things--pear salad, ahi tuna crudo, Penne Tegame, and an apple and fig crostata for dessert.  First I was brought water and quickly the iced tea I ordered.  

The starter was the pear salad.  Their menu describes it as Bartlet Poached Pear, Spiced Goat Cheese, Endive, Pecans, Porto Dressing.  It was excellent.  The pieces of pear in the endive leaves with the goat cheese was an amazing combination.  The pecans added a texture element that was perfect.

Next up was the crudo of very thinly sliced ahi tuna with balsamic soy dressing and guacamole. An interesting combination with ahi tuna but it worked very well.

For the main course, I bypassed the signature pasta dish and instead went with the penne Tegame with a spicy Roma tomato and parsley sauce and mozzarella.  The red flecks of pepper could be seen and tasted throughout the dish.  The spiciness was not overwhelming for anyone.  It was excellent.

Jose suggested the cannoli for dessert but I chose something different, the warm apple and fig crostata.  It had an orange and vanilla bean reduction/panna cotta gelato.  I am generally not a fan of warm desserts but this was amazing!  Very delicious and an excellent ending to a delightful meal.

Service was the best!  My iced tea never got more than an inch down from the top when the glass was refilled.  Plates were removed quickly, and people addressed me by my last name taken from the reservation.  This is what I expect from a Four Seasons restaurant and they didn't fail.  In addition, I received a phone call on the way home because they thought they had found an item I may have left behind.  They were in error, but it shows the detail to service that's paired with great food.

I'll be coming back for that signature pasta dish.  I have to check it out!",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,8,7,5,hfXyvbUD9mrcc0D1FKDyJA
4012829,2013-02-21,1,duw-3Aj7gAKbQG-isS5UtQ,"Review is for 2012 Restaurant Week.

Verandah is located in the Four Seasons Hotel and I remember my first visit here to the hotel, I was confused as heck on where to park, either you valet or do what I did and park in the large lot south of the entrance and walk on the roadway in.  

Verandah was dimly lit and had a nice cozy atmosphere.  There were numerous tables, private rooms, and booths.  But we were sat against the window wall where you couldn't really see the outside because it was getting dark.  But you can see the private pool surrounded by green forestry, would probably be nice to sit out there and dine.  The service was good, server was attentive but the restaurant wasn't busy yet and the food runner knocked our socks off.  I lost all my pictures on my phone so I'm relying on the blurry dishes opposite of my foodie buddy Angela T's uploaded photos since we came here for restaurant week.  

On paper the menu looked outstanding, worthy of the $50.12 price marked.  And compared to the other items offered at other places for the same mark I thought Verandah played it too conservative with such high level of culinary technique.  The drink I ordered didn't impress but the server did replace it.  

The best food runner ever, not because he was Hawaiian, came out with a complimentary appetizer.  The soup and spoon sides were great.  The first course came out and mine beat Angela's.  I tasted her risotto because I love risotto and it was ahh maybe cooked a little bit longer than needed.  I think argula is one of the better tasting greens out there, the flower is even better but it was fresh.  My first course was a scallop, jumbo shrimp, and can't remember the third item but it was placed on top of a nice sauce and topped with a delicious flavor foam.  The spoon had a sweet fruit taste which completely refreshed my palette.  The runner told me it was to be eaten in one direction to the other.  The second course was what caught my attention and what brought me here.  This dish was so plain.  The monkfish itself was prepared perfectly though so there really was no hating it but there really was no way of loving it also.  I ordered the other dessert just so we could split it and try the others dessert and to me they both ended up being ordinary as well.  For me two of the three courses was just so plain, my appetizer was great though.

There were some great skills used when preparing our Restaurant Week courses and I appreciate the participation otherwise I would have never come here for dinner.  Culinary skills and mix of flavor to me outshined the bland main course, the complimentary appetizer was appreciated as well and our food runner was on top of every ingredient and knowledge into  how each dish was created.  I thought he was our chef with the way he explained each item as he delivered it to us.",k4M43lXJuQMpQW65DTqzIQ,6,3,4,d0zAKRnW9WUy7Yo1zt6eKQ

Our mozzarella caprese appetizer was perfectly simple. I had the Cloud of Gnocci for dinner which, as the name indicates, was light and very tasty. I wouldn't recommend it if you are looking for a heavy big dish, but I loved it. Had the apple tart for dessert, which is beautiful and tasty. Didn't love the goat cheese crumble on it, but they didn't overwhelm the tart. It didn't actually have any pie crust, which I missed.

4074561,2016-02-05,4,duw-3Aj7gAKbQG-isS5UtQ,"I took my mom here for their $100 (for two after taxes and tip) afternoon tea as an early Christmas present and she absolutely adored it! It was a lot of fun but it pained me to hand over my credit card. This isn't something I'd do often, but if you are into tea parties you should try it at least once. 

The tea service setup is fun (but I was sad that the waiters were not wearing white gloves or anything; for that kind of per-person price they should've been playing it up like a scene out of ""Downton Abbey"") and semi-casual. There were lots of older socialite types as well as a few couples. You can opt to add a glass of champage or just go with the straight tea. 

The tea menu is good, but I was sad that they were out of two of the teas (of course the one I wanted!) the day we were there. They should try harder to always have all the teas listed on hand; that really set a downer tone from the get-go. 

We were presented with a tiered tower of treats: freshly baked scones on top, savory bites in the middle, then sweets on the bottom. The scones were INSANELY delicious. I wish we had a whole tower of just those. The clotted cream and preserves served alongside were some of the most delicious I've had anywhere, even in local tea houses in rural England.

The savory bites were good but not great. While they tasted freshly baked, some of the textures of the uniform pastry shells screamed ""premade."" The sweets were the worst of the bunch; we took just one or two bites of most of those. 

The staff said they do change up the goodies that are offered, so you may have different edibles than we had. The staff was prompt, courteous, and kept our teapots filled with hot water.

One suggestion I'd have for the tea service: it would be nice if the restaurant tried to make it feel more special and/or romantic. Maybe have some live music or play classical music or curtain off a special area of the restaurant. A lot of ambiance was lost with the television over the bar blaring an NBA basketball game. 

The tea service requires a 24 hour's notice reservation, so make sure you call ahead or stop by to avoid disappointment.",BQkC6RneYfvfG6wRe0hsvQ,12,5,4,W_ks6XCqH8MnJdkJTx2gPA

The service was Excellent and the Food was delicious. 

My mother, lil sister and I took a break from the pool and sat on the patio: 
We had Prosecco, The summer Watermelon and Arugula Salad. So light, refreshing and tasty. The watermelon and tomatoes were bright red and they were delicious. Next we had the Grilled Salmon on top of the Field Greens Salad. Both dressing's were spectacular and it was a perfect late lunch to hold us over for dinner.

The restaurant itself is a casual elegant environment without being pretentious. Its a real getaway from the casino crowd.  It feels like you are not in Vegas, which is kinda nice being able to enjoy your dinner.

The brunch was a bit disappointing in terms of the Vegas offering, but the qualities are much better. I loved the make your own peanut butter machine, so fun!  freshly made doughnuts are good too.

The dinner, however, it was a real deal.  I loved the regional Italian dinner prix-fixe Menu.  from appetizers, main courses to dessert, are all wonderfully prepared and reasonably priced (Vegas pricing).  I loved the way he cooked the fish, one of the best fish dishes I had in Vegas.

We changed things up by ordering the calamari (fritto misto). A good choice as there was shrimp/calamari and green peppers which brought it some heat. I looked back at my previous review and my significant other ordered the same thing as he did last year. The Brasato Barolo (short ribs) which is a definitely a MUST try... very flavorful, melts in your mouth deliciousness. I decided to get the rack of lamb which was good, nothing extraordinary....a lil bit over done for the ""medium"" that it was supposed to be but I think I could pass it up next time. The best dish of the night was Antonio's Pasta. It was cooked in the glass jar shown in pictures with scallops, shrimp and the best fresh pasta ever! The flavors were just wonderful and I could have just had that for dinner and been content. We ended it with a wonderful chocolate souffle that wasn't overly sweet and paired well with the dolce latte flavored gelato. They also surprised us with a plate of truffles and a Happy Anniversary written on it....sweet touch to a great night.

Verandah's service has always been and still is attentive. Delicious food paired with great service makes it for a great night. They also know how to make a lemon drop martini like how this gal likes it....bonus points there since I've been highly dissatisfied with a lot of lemon drop martinis at other venues.

I love dining at the restaurants in the Four Seasons. Too bad they don't have more restaurants! Valet is complimentary if dining at one of the restaurants and the valet is quick. The ambiance of The Four Seasons is so lovely and has a much calmer setting than the other hotels on the Strip. 

Veranda isn't a far walk from where you'll leave your car with the valet. Inside The Four Seasons it's just a left and then a walk to the end of a short hall. 

Our group decided to go with the Sunday brunch buffet and it was a good decision. There were several areas of food to choose from. The hot food area had the usual breakfast foods like eggs, bacon, pancakes, and oatmeal with all of the fixings. There were also special items like chicken and waffles, benedicts, mini breakfast burritos, blintzes (!), and their signature bread pudding. There is an omelet station for those that prefer a customized egg option. In the other sections they have plenty of pastries, yogurts, fresh fruit, meats, cheeses, and delicious mini donuts. They even have a little table with kid friendly foods like peanut butter and jelly sandwiches (sans crust).

I really enjoyed the food offered at the buffet. My favorite items were the mini donuts, the bread pudding, and the chicken and waffles. The waffle in the chicken and waffles had jalapenos in it which really kicked the flavor up a notch. Everyone will find something they can enjoy for breakfast. 

The pricing for the breakfast buffet was similar to what you'd pay for Wicked Spoon at The Cosmopolitan or Bacchanal at Caesars . I think those buffets offer a little more food options, but you can't beat the ambiance of brunch at The Four Seasons. Brunch here is definitely more relaxing and has nicer ambiance than other brunch options in town. I can definitely see coming back here for brunch.",3nIuSCZk5f_2WWYMLN7h3w,7,5,4,KA97PD92_JPKYA2BJkm77Q

They seem to seat all the parties of 1 in the middle of the restaurant where there's a bench seating area with single tables. Fair enough.

I especially like having lunch here. I try to get in one lunch per visit, just for this reason alone: ice tea ice cubes. Yes, just like Bonjour Cafe does with their ice coffee w/coffee ice cubes (http://www.yelp.com/biz/bonjour-french-pastry-gardena), this Four Seasons doesn't dilute their ice tea with regular ol' water ice cubes. Bah. That's for amateurs. Here, they bring you a glass filled with ice tea cubes and then pour in the hot ice tea, so you get full concentration and no dilution of a caffeine buzz.

Their soups, salads and sandwiches are always nice. And if it's a nice day out, you can eat al fresco. 

Apparently, them changing out by white napkin for a black one because I was wearing black slacks was a big deal, because DK asked what the heck they were doing. I thought it was pretty common, but I guess not. Or maybe I've just been frequenting restaurants where they care about you not walking out looking like a doofus with white lint all over your white pants.

This is the only Four Seasons I know of that has the ice tea cubes. So don't blame me if you go to another Four Seasons asking for this and they look at you all crazy-like.",36Vr9BASkR2v9NKNoZtiSA,5,1,4,dhrTrOrSDyppefOgrV_VUA

Simple formula for the 5 star review here --- superb setting and a legendary huevos rancheros. 

As someone said -- ""This is simply the best outdoor place to eat in Vegas....the decor is relaxing, fresh, pool side, green, so soothing!!""

Indeed. So relaxing, fresh, clean, quiet --- a stark contrast to the rest of Vegas.

The coffee was perfect and I am a picky coffee person. Service was good and not in your face at all. But the best part was the main.

Huevos rancheros. A relatively straightforward dish. Made differently at a lot of places. But this sets the standard. The plate came out piping hot, the flavors mixed together so well, and the presentation was superb.

Let me put it this way --- I eat out a LOT and am blessed to try some amazing places. I rarely have something I remember vividly later. The duck at the Modern in NYC, the cashew chicken at Ryutenmon Tokyo, the sushi at Kaygetsu here in in Menlo Park --- and now the huevos rancheros at Verandah Vegas.

Food was very delicious, and I highly recommend the Gluten Free combination breakfast. The waffle that comes with it is killer.

A free dinner up to $85 was provided as well during our stay. I ordered their signature pasta which was cooked in a glass jar. Presentation was very unique and tasted great. We also ordered a steak which was good as well. For dessert, we got their big shareable dessert with a giant cotton candy, ice cream, caramel brittle.

Sadly, our attempt for a fine dining evening experience at the Veranda was far less than satisfactory.

Ambiance aside, it was the dinners that fell hopelessly into the category of grossly over priced for very unimpressive cuisine. One member of our party had to send his inedible pasta dish back, not once, but twice. The fact that his dinner was later comped did not alter the on going dining disruption for our entire party. Other guests found their dinners ranged from grossly lacking to ordinary. A Filet steak that was ordered Medium was served Rare. A side order of spinach was 1/2 cup of tasteless lukewarm greens.

The food was also fantastic. The scones are the best ones I've had-- super light and fluffy. They make one plain and one with currants, and is accompanied with THE best cream. I surprisingly liked all the sandwiches, and I think the biggest difference was the quality of the bread and the fact that the sandwiches were not dry.

Presentation is nice, but the rest is pretty funny.... 1/2 a grilled cheese sandwich with the crusts cut off (I guess that is fancier?!) and the SMALLEST saucer of soup you have ever seen ..... you know those saucers they put your hot mustard sauce in at any Chinese restaurant?? ... well, that's what the soup comes in!!!!!!! seriously.

We called over the waitress and showed it to her. She apologized and took it away. It was clearly baked in the bread. 
Unfortunately, the waitress seemed 'annoyed' at us... like it was our fault!! 
She didn't take the rest of the loaf away.. she leaves it there like we are going to eat more from it!? 
We had to ask her to get us a fresh loaf of bread... after that she wasn't very attentive for the rest of our meal. I guess we were the problem... so demanding.

At the end of our meal she brought out 2 mini cupcakes for us to share for 'our trouble'. TACKY.

Third course was 'snapper' (hard to tell) with whipped potato - not bad, but this is a $100 place setting.  Fourth course was short rib with polenta - very so-so.  The desert course was an 'ok' mouse cake with a dollop of ice cream, topped off with coffee.  The entire expereince just felt very ""regular"".  Here's the juicy bit.

My wife and I dress up for dinner about once a month as a treat.  On this evening, she wore a stunning dress and her best Jimmy Choo pumps - absolutely smashing!  While we wear jeans and shorts when appropriate - we're the last people would call snobs - we were really put off by the fellow at the next table in a ""wife beater"" T-shirt.  Where's the dress code for The Four Seasons during the dinner hour?

We've not tried the Charlie Palmer steak house adjacent to The Verandah, but doubt a visit any time soon.  Perhaps that's the hierarchy of dining at this hotel - The Verandah for the pool crowd.  With so many terrific alternatives on and off The Strip, The Verandah is relinquished to the back water.",h9stsH2vvCmhwHdfkc_1kw,3,1,1,0asKHd7zsFGiGiFrpmhFkw

Price is $39 for brunch on a regular day and $80 on a holiday. 

We had some difficulties with this restaurant which I'll get to later, but first I'll talk about the food. We made reservations for Sunday brunch, and it happened to be Father's day, so we are unsure if it was a different menu or not but the menu seemed comparable to what was online. There were several stations: one more focused on breakfast with egg dishes, bacon, yogurt parfaits, etc., and these were all very good. The candied bacon was excellent in particular. There is also a small kids table. Next, there was a sushi/fish station. We enjoyed the tuna and salmon glasses but the sushi was not fresh, and I had one bite before giving up on that. There is a cheese and charcuterie selection as well, with mostly blue cheeses which were not my favorite but they seemed to be good cheeses overall. We loved the dessert station with dessert non-alcoholic martinis, cakes, cupcakes, and freshly make mini-donuts (skip the ones with the frosting, it's too sweet). There was an avocado bar oddly placed outside the restaurant; some people were even eating it while waiting in line. It seemed like anyone walking by could get some. The avocado bar was nice though; we tried the crab avocado toast. By the pool was a barbeque area with an Asian station with lovely duck buns, a taco station which also was good, and a meat section. The meat section had a large beef rotisserie which was dry and chewy and seemed like the meat had been there for a while untouched. I would skip out on this meat as well. They also have several fresh juices they bring to the table. 

So overall, we did enjoy the food. When we thought we were paying the $39 for the buffet, we enjoyed the food and overall experience even though some food was a little less fresh than desired. 

Next, we get to my issue with the place. When I made a reservation, I received an email confirmation saying we were confirmed for my specific date (which happened to be father's day) for the price of $39 per person. I was traveling with my boyfriend and mom and it never really occurred to us that it was Father's Day or that anything would be different since the email confirmation stated the price was $39. When we got the check, it says $80 a person - over DOUBLE what we were told! We asked the waitress and she said the price was correct, so we followed up with the manager the next day who was rude and demeaning. There is no excuse for the overcharge since I have an email confirmation saying the price was less than half of that which was listed. We are in the process of getting refunded for the overcharge, but even if we knew it was $80, I would not say the service and food are worth that. My suggestion is do not go to the Veranda on a holiday. The food is no better than on a regular day, and I don't see how this could justify for over double the price. They didn't even offer drinks. The Sterling Brunch at another Vegas hotel is $90, and they provide unlimited caviar and champagne! This brunch is just not worth $80 for the price.",5-corG2RqN4iqamWfSLAPA,1,0,2,0aEEohOdITHwUUbKu7ayuA

I'm going to be very blunt. Veranda does not belong in a Four Seasons Resort.

I don't mind spending upwards of $40 for breakfast just to enjoy an hour in a tranquil setting away from the the casino.  However the lackluster food and service in the past year have left me wondering why I continue to revisit the Veranda.

Food: the menu fails to change with the seasons. The same eggs Benedict with tomato hollandaise and asparagus has remained for the past six months. Something that shouldn't happen considering asparagus is a seasonal veg.  On my most recent visit, hash browns were stone cold in the middle and tasted previously frozen. The poached eggs in the Benedicts, overcooked with almost no liquid yolk, and simple whole-wheat toast, limp, barely toasted, and dripping with butter. A single choice of fruit preserves on the table.

Service: the biggest disappointment.  First, the restaurant prides itself on having servers address you by name (Your name is passed from the hostess to your lead server). On one occasion, my guest was addressed with my name (perhaps Asians all look alike), on another, even I didn't recognize the pronunciation of my name.  Seriously, what's wrong with just saying ""good morning""?
 
Second, on my last two visits, I had to ask for more coffee. The server simply brought a pot to the table. It wasn't until I attempted to pour my own refill that a second server rushed over and insisted I allow her to pour.
 
Finally, on my most recent visit, I wanted to do a room charge at an MGM property. Was told by the server I should complete the room charge form but Mandalay Bay was not part of the Four Seasons.  She needed to get special approval to complete the transaction.  Proceeded to wait.  Finally after watching her chatting animatedly with other employees for 20 minutes and waiving off the busser I flagged down to get her attention, I walked out.  I made the extra step of personally visiting the front desk to verify that in fact the room charge was completed.

Yes, these complaints are first world problems and honestly trivial but when paying $80-$100 for breakfast for two, and knowing the impeccable service and attention to detail  usually given at a Four Seasons Resort, this was quite a shock.

FOOD: The first time I ate at Verandah was back in 08' for Mother's Day. As a teenager, fine dining lunch was the only thing I could afford. Over the years, I've kissed goodbye the lobster eggs benedict at breakfast and the only salmon burger in Vegas I'll eat. The salmon was always flavorful and perfectly cooked. If I'm paying a mini-fortune for a burger, I expect it to be prepared the right way. The current menu offers all the classics which they do extremely well. The corned beef has--yummy! But as a fine dining restaurant, I would like to see a little more character and diversity--something unique to Verandah that will make me itch to come back to eat.

DINING: If the weather allows, DO sit outside. The patio area is absolutely amazing on a beautiful day. Its upscale and luxurious but you get the amazing view of the pool. They have big sunbrellas and adorable wicker chairs to lounge around and enjoy your meal--classy! There's also plenty of space between you and the next table so you don't need to worry about being cramped or eavesdropping. The interior is just as nice.

Visited just weeks ago for brunch as a guest of the Four Seasons there was little doubt that a return to Veranda was in order, and when the recently renovated restaurant decided to open its doors at 50% off to any diner making a December reservation on Black Friday the deal proved too hard to resist - the discount proving most fortuitous in the setting of a restaurant that has the gall to charge $14 for two tiny eggplant rolls and $12 for double espresso of less-than-ideal Lavazza served alongside, not over, ice as if defying one to make a mess in trying to do it themself.

Acknowledging the fact that the first experience at Veranda was coordinated by PR with superlative service from start to finish, suffice it to say that a second meal booked under the name of two friends offered less impressive timing and having ordered substantially with requests for items to be sent out in a rather specific manner the start of the meal was almost inexplicably rushed - the delicious and soft focaccia hitting the table before menus were even opened and both fourteen dollar meatballs and the aforementioned eggplant arriving before a few small bites of brilliantly balanced salad were fully consumed.

Treated next to a pizza that featured a surprisingly buttery crust with little char and rather flavorless tomatoes that thankfully received an upgrade from thickly applied Mozzarella and light accents of basil it would not be long before an onslaught of primi arrived and with the four-top table as well as meager sharing plates obviously overburdened despite our server personally suggesting he would ""space out the pastas"" two of the dishes were immediately sent back to the kitchen - Chef Minichiello obviously taking the gesture seriously by not only coming out to personally apologize, but also individually plating each subsequent course in tasting-menu fashion.

Speaking specifically to the quality of the noodles, aside from the signature ""jar"" with pasta that logically becomes a bit soft due to the cooking technique, it can only be said that most of Minichiello's housemade creations are served with textbook consistency and with the two meaty courses more 'up front' with the flavors of slow-cooked proteins allowed to shine the flavors of the Pasta Cotta Nel Vaso and Tagliolini were far more restrained, the first melding shellfish and herbs with light cream while the later was an aromatic masterpiece, the saffron and sea beans each offering their unmistakable flavors in balance to sweet, snappy prawns.

Pairing a half-chicken cooked Cacciatora-style, with far better results than that at Giada according to my two friends, to two sides that were simple yet impeccably prepared to maximize the flavor of every ingredient it was at this point that each in our party noted that we were becoming quite full and yet with a half-off dessert menu featuring no less than seven items I'd have liked to try it was with some restraint that only three were ordered - the doughnuts a but underwhelming when compared to the buttery seasonal Crostada, but neither even in the same ballpark as the 'signature' in terms of taste or presentation, the cotton-candy topped pedestal featuring soft lady fingers and mascarpone soaked in Amaretto with boozy blueberries and three balls of ice cream making for one heck of a 'sundae.'

Tipping on the pre-discount total to the tune of just over $200 for the table it must be said that considering the cost of the meal Veranda presented one of the best dining values on the Strip in this particular circumstance, but taking into account the service gaffs and truly laughable coffee upcharge the question becomes whether yet another visit could be justified at double the price - something I cannot say I'm certain about at this point.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,5,2,3,MMS-8YWBy2erORrQ9JZpDg

We were hoping for some seafood and were disappointed that there was none.  The place did serve a variety of pastries which were delicious.

We both got the turkey dinner. We actually brought our own wine and I am glad we did because the waiter told us the wine pairing was horrible that night. We went early and there was nobody there. 

The food came out really quick and it was ok. I was bummed because almost every single item served had cinnamon in it. I am allergic to cinnamon so it was difficult for me to eat. It was shocking how much cinnamon they used.

The crab retained its texture and did not gum together like one which is made of all bread crumbs. The aioli is on the heavy side. The salmon was cooked to perfection. A beautiful medium with a nice warm center. It broke apart without flaking everywhere. The use of dressing was light and the flavors of the artichoke and other vegetables were present. The tuna three ways was okay. I am not a huge roll type of person, so I could do without it. The upside was that they did not skimp of the center. It was predominantly spicy tuna.

Dinner: The service was top notch and in particular, our server (I forgot his name but he was a blondish man in maybe his 40s) couldn't be nicer and more accommodating. The portions were larger than I expected. We split a Caesar salad and it was a generous portion. My husband had the shrimp pasta and he said it was one of the best pasta dishes he's ever had (and he's a pasta fanatic). I had the braised short ribs and every bite was super tender and melted in my mouth. We also tried the dessert that included four ice cream bars (made in house - caramel ice cream coated with chocolate and nuts) and they were delicious and just perfect for sharing. My toddler's pasta with red sauce was a very generous portion and he enjoyed his scoop of gelato as well. The setting is ""fancy"" but they were great with our toddler and had a coloring book with crayons available. 

Breakfast: You can either order off the menu or do the buffet and we opted to do the buffet, which is priced about the same as other more high-end resort buffets. What I liked about this is that the food was pre-portioned into single servings so things like bread pudding didn't look all gross after a few people have dug into it. The options include: corned beef hash (with shoestring potatoes), peach pancakes, egg florentine, hash browns (actually, this was a bit salty), bread pudding, scones, house smoked salmon, bacon, sausages, lots of pastries, some kind of quinoa chia pudding, oatmeal, yogurt and granola parfait, omelet station, melon slices, mixed berries, and even more things that I can't remember. There was also a kids station (kids height) with breakfast sandwiches, fruit kabobs, vegetable sticks (with dip), and jam sandwiches. 

The coconut mango Greek yogurt flan was AMAZING. (I need the recipe!) I don't like yogurt but this was not tart or yogurt-y. The mini donuts, which is what everyone talks about, are delicious and made fresh. I recommend the cinnamon sugar one which tastes like a churro.",PMT94wJvyAQdG9YGZerYAw,2,1,5,Zm9xDm8DjgMOJQZp_m8A-A

It was my first time having afternoon tea service so I didn't have anything to compare it to but can say that I liked it.  First of all, it was so cute and girly as there were several parties of mothers and their young daughters that afternoon.  What a fun idea for an outing!  As for the tea and food, overall it was all very good.  I asked the waiter if he could suggest something fruity for me and really liked what he picked out.  (I'm pretty sure it was the Mountain Berry Tisane.)  The sandwiches and scones/spread tasted great!  Must admit I wasn't too crazy over their dessert, though.  Some of it was actually dry.

The next day we came back for breakfast and ate out by the pool.  It was a hot day but clouds and misters helped keep us cool.  The atmosphere was amazing!  Totally recommend eating out there.  The food was average.  Not the best breakfast food I've had but not the worst either.  (Surprising but restaurants can actually do bad breakfast food!)  It was also pretty expensive, maybe $30 for my order.  But then again it's the Four Seasons and you're paying for atmosphere as well.  I got The American - eggs, hash brown, choice of meat, bread, and juice.  I forgot what juice I had but whatever it was it was so delish and refreshing!

And our first morning breakfast was here, at Verandah. We stayed at Mandalay Bay and it was just a short walk to the this place at Four Seasons Hotel that is on the same territory as Mandalay Bay.

 It was a chilly morning and the place was packed inside so were offered to sit at the table outside with a floor heater lamp moved next to us. But you know what? Make sure to sit OUTSIDE as if you sit inside it just feels as a typical restaurant.

Service was fantastic: timely and friendly. Place was very clean with people reading newspapers, sipping on orange juices and coffees. If you sit outside, you feel like you are somewhere in Hawaii (palm trees, swimming pool is seen from the terrace).

Prices are reasonable for this level of a restaurant. You can probably spend up to $30/person on a full breakfast. Keep in mind, they have a buffet type of breakfast as well at $35. If you are a small eater, probably you can order off the menu (oatmeal and tea) and it will be less.
 
The buffet setting feels very elegant as well. Food looks and smells good; is very fresh and tastes delicious.  The selection is not as huge as in some buffets out there, but it has the staples (scrambled eggs, French toasts, oatmeal, berries, fruit, yogurt, some meat (sausage chicken and pork, bacon), which makes it easy for you to make a selection and not to overeat but still indulge on your favorites.

We have come to Veranda for the last few years every Mother's Day and Father's Day. The brunch keeps getting better and it seems like they add more food each time. 

We always sit outside by the pool. This year they offered the normal brunch foods inside. Outside, there was a hot dog/Philly cheesesteak station, pizza station, taco cart, meats, etc. The only bad thing I could say about their food is that the sushi wasn't good. But when is sushi at a brunch ever good? Rice is cold and it just kinda sits out. So that's not a real complaint.

Staff came around offering non-alcoholic sangria in plastic bags which I thought was so cute. I didn't like the taste but it was a neat idea. There was also Las Vegas distillery & brewery there on Father's Day to offer tastings!

I love this place. We will come back every year for the mothers/day Father's Day brunch even though it's a bit pricey. $80 per adult, and I believe my 3 year old was like $16. He didn't eat much.

To start off you actually have a server who checks in on you and you have the option for a la carte if you are with someone who doesn't eat much but you enjoy buffets. Like most buffets it includes coffee juice soda etc with alcohol for purchase. You get your own coffee pot but the server still came by and refilled it himself of he saw it was getting low. All of the food on the buffet is restaraunt quality not mass produced sometimes good sometimes meh. That being saod theres not as much variety as other buffets. Theres no carving ststion or dinner items. But a nice selection for breakfast. Some of my favorite offerings were the corned beef hash,  the hash browns, the chicken and waffles,  and the pumpkin pancakes. There are a ton of pastries to choose from as well and a made to order donut station which is a must try. There is everything from bagels to fruit to yogurt to eggs to cereal. There is a peanut butter machine that you grind your own peanut butter so it's nice and fresh and delicious. $44 after tac before tip but worth it... most buffets on a weekend for breakfast will cost a pretty penny anyway why not go to one where you get high quality.",wqcO86hX2t2X9MsDIsIwnQ,0,0,5,YIM9ZewJbvFoecKzWtQBmA

The service was good, and the food was nicely prepared. For breakfast, I stuck with ""The American"" -- eggs, sausage or bacon, hash browns, and a fruit plate to split. I did notice that they have avocado on toast, which I found funny since my mom made that ages ago when I was a kid. Being English, she always made beans on toast and sardines on toast. When we moved to San Diego, it became avocado on toast (she even made Spaghettios on toast). Back then, I never saw avocado on toast at any restaurants. Now I see it everywhere. Veranda's version has a fried egg on top. Everything is better with an egg on top. On weekends they have a small buffet brunch, which is about $40 a head. I gave it a try and thought it nicely done. I also had lunch there one day, and just got a bunch of appetizers to share and then had a roasted beet salad with the typical ingredients. The only annoying thing was when a waitress had a 10 minute conversation with the next table over, her backside was almost on our table and she kept flipping her ponytail when she spoke.

I was determined to find a fabulous brunch spot in Vegas for a bachelorette weekend. Not wanting a diner-like place, I was ecstatic when I found Veranduh. I called well in advance and they had room for our party of 9. The day of, we arrived a few minutes early, so our table was not ready yet. We happily waited in the Four Seasons pool area.

We were then seated at a spectacular outdoor table. The menu offers a la carte items or a buffet style brunch for $37. Drinks were additional but the Unlimited Bloody Mary Bar sold me. 

First things first, get to the Bloody Mary bar. It had all the fixins'. All types of hot sauces, olives, pickles, bacon, salts, etc. If you had at least 2 (which you will, because it is so delicious), the cost paid for itself.

Now on to the buffet. Holy moly. They have everything you could think of including:

Omelet Station
Mini Huevos Rancheros (in mini cast iron skillets, I die)
Eggs Benedict
Lox
Pancakes
Waffles
Pastries
All types of breads (bagels, croissants, etc).
Make your own donuts (well, someone makes them for you but you get to choose exactly how you want it!)

I would rather go here every day for brunch and not eat any other meal. 

It is expensive, yet somehow reasonable considering you are in Vegas. The food and drinks are worth every penny. Service was top notch (I wouldn't expect anything less at the Four Seasons). Great for a group, also!

One of the reasons I like Verandah is because they are on OpenTable.com. That usually makes it very easy to have a space reserved between classes at the conference. Sometimes lunch time during a conference with 20,000 people can be a challenge. Open Table reservations make that challenge easy to overcome.

But tonight the hostess did not credit my Open Table reservation. Instead she canceled it. I tried to explain to her that I did not cancel my reservation we just came an hour early since one member of our party had to get to the airport. It became difficult for something that should have been so easy. 

While the food was good, and the service was good, the experience was a little frustrating. However, I will give them a chance to make it better next time.",c8YOUQ1Lz645fopLMNEAnw,4,5,3,tA4nwUuyC4yHbfUI8H926w

There are some that I say are undeniably above the rest and while Veranda may not be one of those select few, it is still incredibly good.

The setting is great and I don't know if there's a better outdoor seating environment on the strip than overlooking the pool at the Four Seasons. It is a casual restaurant experience which is great for when you roll out of your bed but it also feels like a country club. The prices also reflect that feeling. It is not exuberantly expensive by any means...it is also not IHOP.

-Smores French Toast. Obviously delicious and something that could kill you upon first consumption. Probably worth it though.

-Breakfast Panini. Super good. Won't destroy your stomach but still has a lot of flavor and tastes healthy which is a plus even if it is most likely a lie. Burrata tomatoe spinach pesto eggs etc. It all works.

The fruit plates and the pastries are also nice and fresh. It's hard to describe the intricacies of a medium to high priced breakfast cafe but you should reasonably know what to expect. I am the kind of person that has never been blown away by breakfast food no matter where it is, except Border Grill but more on that later.

Needless to say, I was flippin starving, and when I'm that hungry, I never know what I want because nothing sounds good enough. So I decided that after my spa treatment, to treat myself further by visiting the very near and very posh Four Seasons Hotel. I stopped by the concierge desk at the Mandalay Bay (where I was staying) and asked if there was anything she could recommend me at the Four Seasons and she directed me to Verandah.

Let me just say, that this was the best solitary lunch I've ever had. It was a beautiful, crisp, January afternoon and I chose to sit outside and have lunch with my Cavalli sunglasses on. Having no reservations, I requested a table for 1, but before I was even taken to my table, I was offered a newspaper for reading. I opted for my British Elle magazine instead.

I ordered a sparkling water with lime, and it came out with a varietal bread basket along with some pure olive oil the waiter walks around with in a fancy little pourer. Personally, I think the bread basket is an indicator of how nice a restaurant is, and this was no exception. Wanting to present myself as a posh customer, I forwent most of it, and proceeded to order the Italian Wedge Salad. I love wedge salads, it sets the scene for a high-end power lunch. For my main lunch course, I went with one of the restaurant's signature dish, the ""Christina"" Panini that had pesto chicken, onion jam, basil mayo, tomatoes, and provolone, with a small side broccoli salad. Service was expectedly impeccable, because they brought out the check almost immediately after I mentioned I had an appointment in half an hour (an appointment with the Lion King matinee showing!).

I sat there for an hour reading my magazine, enjoying the sun and solitude, noshing on $30 worth of wedge salad and chicken panini and it was fabulous. Definitely keeping this place my own secret Vegas hiding place, and coming back for their afternoon tea which you have to reserve a day in advance and is only available on the weekdays.

After a long night of drinking and gambling, an early spa treatment is in order, and after, a quiet lunch at the Verandah followed by an early matinee show of the Lion King really puts you back in the mood to hit the town again!",FzCEMuQZBD712YD2OvPJng,3,1,5,YXI5lElmlV3biWfTFAzX7g

The hostess was mildly unpleasant. The waiter was stand-offish and slow. And, considering the restaurant had more staff than customers at the time we visited, the service was surprisingly inattentive. 

We came for happy hour because the happy hour menu was attractive and well priced (especially for Vegas and The Four Seasons). The Mozzarella Carrozza was delicious and I would have gladly ordered a second plate had I been pleased with the service (almost being impaled with silverware when the server *threw* them down on the table in front of us was a big miss).

Even the Hampton Inn had artificial crab meat for its omelette bar. I will give a second star for the service. The waiters/busmen (?) were  attentive and friendly.

The breakfast menu offers simple American favorites - pancakes, French toast, waffles, hash - plus a couple of ethnic dishes, such as huevos rancheros. Lunch gets a little more ambitious, and at dinner time the menu switches to an Italian theme.

**The Atmosphere
Colors are mostly a range of browns, with lots of wood. Seating is available both indoors and outdoors; while I sat indoors, outdoor seating looked very nice. Overall, the atmosphere was pleasant and relaxed.

Service was friendly and efficient. I can't describe this very well, but I had a good feeling about the restaurant. Everything just worked smoothly.

**The Meal
I chose an often recommend dish: corned beef and pastrami hash, two eggs, and crisp potatoes. It started out with a layer of finely shredded potatoes - actually more like thin spaghetti than shreds - fried crisp. Next, a thick layer of hash. Lastly, two eggs, any style; I chose scrambled.

The hash consisted of a thick layer of finely minced corned beef and pastrami. It was delicious; somehow I managed to finish the gargantuan portion. The crunchy potatoes shreds were an excellent foil to the smooth hash, although they were a challenge to get onto my fork. The only disappointing item was the eggs. They were overly firm and lacking in character. However, that's a minor quibble. I would recommend this dish to anyone.

I also ordered a latte. It came with a small biscuit that was a cross between pistachio biscotti and shortbread. Slightly sweet, it was a good foil to the coffee.

**Summary
After only one meal, I'm ready to place The Verandah on my list of top breakfast spots. Its menu doesn't appeal to me as much as that at my top choice - Bouchon - and the overall feel of the place also isn't quite as inviting, but the combination of excellent food, good service, and pleasing atmosphere make it a winner.

We ordered the gorgonzola fries to start. I chose the Charlie Palmer steak sandwich and my mom and other half both went with the Sin City burger. The Sin city is a wagyu burger with white cheddar, bacon, avocado and a side of truffle parmesan fries. The steak sandwich was a NY strip with arugula and steak fries. 

The chips were house made and described as being served with a  gorgonzola ""fondue"". As delicious as the chips were there needed to be more cheese. After the first few chips the rest had no cheese on them. 

The burgers and steak sandwich arrived a short time after.  My steak was cooked perfectly and the bread was super fresh. The steak fries were a little too thick and dry. I absolutely loved the smaller fries served with the burgers though. They were crispy and loaded with truffle and parmesan flavor. Next time I will ask for those instead of the steak fries. 

Unfortunately the food runner mixed up the burgers and my mom and other half got each others (one medium, one rare). They figured it out after a few bites so we flagged down Kieu. She was very apologetic and asked if we wanted it remade, which my other half did. She told us the chef said it would be 15 minutes so he decided not to wait. The burger itself was large and they both said the flavor was delicious. We somehow had a little room for dessert so ordered a piece of chocolate cake to share. 

As we were waiting, Tessa, The Veranda manager came by to apologize for the burger mix up. Tessa was a delight to speak to and obviously cares about her guests happiness.

I could tell she was trying to end the call to seat us, but try as she may, she could not end the call. We stood there for about 3-4 minutes when one of the waiters came to seat us. We looked over the menu and ordered the chicken and waffles and eggs Benedict. The service was excellent, as expected. 

Our food came out perfect and looked delicious. It was, of course!  The only thing that I could say, was the chicken was over-breaded.  There was more breading than chicken. I'm sure some people like that, but not us. 

If you're staying at the Mandalay Bay, this is the place for breakfast. It might be a bit pricier than other restaurants in the hotel, but it is definitely worth it! 

I'll be back in a few months!! My mouth is watering writing this review!!",ahHQeR78TTX4Pf7AHoFIOw,1,0,5,-8cC3Gmv7AzTYgu9xV9tcA
