Not only that, they let them bartend shirtless and have girls take body shots off of them! The owners seemed to have a great time watching us college kids let loose and be young, wild and free.

My other LCA brother Josh aka Dj Paradice was the dj for the same night as well. Another great decision made by the owners.

They had was seemed to be their own hired securty, so it felt safe.

The owners of El Patio are pretty laid back and are open-minded to letting college students throw events in their space. It was a good night and everyone had a good time.

As for their food and cheap margaritas..... I'll have to go back another day to find that out.",_5i-gReOmEts7CLmnZXZ6A,1,2,4,zYwUjLLBLYBSqzQ1uVF5Og

They have lunch specials daily and the portions are generous. The salsa is delicious and the margaritas (though premade) definitely hit the spot. Since i'm a UNLV student I can get them for less than $2. The service could be better but it looks like they try and it's prompt for the most part. 

I have been here twice and both times there have only been maybe 1 or 2 other people. I'm surprised this place doesn't have more business considering it's across from UNLV and the food is cheap.

I usually went there to check out some mid-day soccer game and if you where a UNLV student and showed ID you would get drink specials, which was cool.

The fresh plate of chips and salsa was very good. Fresh chips and very good salsa. 

For appetizer, had melted cheese and chorizo appetizer...I could feel my arteries clogging as I ate the delicious dish with warm wheat tortillas. Washed it down with horchata. Soooo good.

Dinner for me was chicken enchiladas, half price. Very delicious. Dinner for my wife was the carnitas with verde sauce, half price. Her dish was good but a bit salty. She likes meat and I like chicken. She got one of my enchiladas because I was too full from the appetizer and she liked my enchiladas better than her dish. 

Very pleasant place. Live music next door was a bit too loud. The service was excellent. Very patient and very accommodating.

She called her manager, and he supposedly said that I should come back tomorrow with the Groupon. I tried to explain to her that the Groupon was only valid for that day, and she didn't understand.

Immediately upon seating, our friendly waiter got our beverage orders.  He returned also with chips and salsa.  We soon devoured it all and he asked if we wanted more, which we gladly accepted.  

For dinner, I chose the Shrimp Fajitas ($12.50), which is served with rice, beans, and tortillas (corn or flour).  I was quite surprised with how generous they were with the shrimp.  There was plenty and I definitely had leftovers.

The Husband ordered the Steak & Enchilada (your choice of what kind), and it also came with rice, beans, and tortillas.  He was also surprised with how tasty the steak was, they used a good marination.  The real surprise winner was the refried beans.  The Husband was loving their version.  It was good too, but I guess I'm a fan of refried beans in general (especially with a little cheese swirled in there).

We also caught up on music videos while we had dinner.  (You don't get to see music videos anymore!)

Overall, pretty good Mexican food without breaking the budget.  And of course, it helps when there's a coupon in the Entertainment Book.

Walked in and stated my demands. They were agreeable. I asked for one chicken taco, and then realized I needed more. I ordered another, and then, the waiter suggested that I just get the lunch special with rice and beans for $6.50. I was an easy upsell, so I ended up with the whole sha-bang. 

The meal came out quickly as promised, and I must say it was pleasing. The tacos were a little small, but fresh: warm, soft tortillas doubled up and filled with white-meat chicken. The chicken was not seasoned or swimming in sauce. The beans and rice were good, not greasy or heavy. The chips and salsa were not disappointing. It was the perfect little meal to get the job done.

The d√©cor and atmosphere are very simple. There are some classy college humor signs on the wall, including such gems as ""No shirts shoes skirt: no problem."" The server was friendly despite the fact that I had on all three clothing items.

Kids today--I just don't know, but I do know that El Patio was El Soliditito. Next time, I will have to dedicate a bit more time to actually looking at a menu. With such a drive-by experience, I feel as if I am only qualified to give a solid three stars.",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,6,3,3,qsAecPdfW5LLtWiewgarlg

Stopped by after work on a Friday night, the place was empty surprisingly, but that just made it all that easier to get a drink :b Not much of a selection at the bar, I was in the mood for some El Jimador and to my dismay they didn't have it available. I did however, try a shot of Buchanas  as recommended by the bartender. YUM :D. Tried a old fashioned margarita on the rocks, eh, it was ok. I have had better. But it was cheap, nice size, around $5.50, the waitress was very polite and even offered to put a little extra in for me :D... She recommended I try the salsa dip. It tasted home made but way too watery. I wasn't impressed. The bartender suggested I try the Guacamole DIP, on a scale of 1 to 10, I'd give it a 6! Not bad. Unfortunately this was about all I had. 

Aside from being it being very quiet and slow that night, the lighting in the bar was kept dark, the chairs were old, and overall the place seemed a little run down. BUT supposedly, per the bartender, the owner of the bar is in the process  of remodeling the place to separate the kitchen and the bar. I think this place has potential and with a little fixing up it would be a neat little place to relax, get some grub, and a drink :D",3hWJxx8-gMutgaKY2T7IKQ,1,1,3,N0dmu8tUUz3BG9677HNyvg

They also say that this restaurant is really called ""El Patio"" so foolishly, I never searched for reviews for ""El Patio"" under that name. Mistake!

Well, yesterday (4/12/11) was one of my school+work+social days that started at 7:30 AM and ended when I finally got home at 2:30 AM this morning (4/13/11) (I'm already back at school and it's not even 9 AM) On days like today, and yesterday, I pretty much have to go get food because I can't bring a picnic basket worth of food with me to sustain me throughout the day. Yayo Taco, I believe, wasn't open at 10:30 AM yesterday so I decided to try out El Patio. 

I was the only person in there when I walked in, other than an older guy who came out of the kitchen to eat. A friendly guy in chef's whites asked me if I wanted anything to drink and I asked for water. He said it'd be right up and went back to the kitchen.

A lady took my order after I looked over their menu. Their prices are a little steep for what you get! I ordered nachos and asked if they came with meat. I was told yes. What I was not told was that no, meat isn't included in the price listed on the menu and that it's extra. So I ended up spending $7 something on chicken nachos. For reasons unbeknownst to me, I ordered a pina colada... at 10:30 in the morning. I didn't get any sort of student discount and it came out to $3.75. Yeah, so $12 something was more than I was wanting to spend so that kinda sucks.

So I decided to chill all by my lonesome with my copy of The Weekly and my passable pina colada while I waited for my food. Between my texting storm and watching Spanish music videos on 3 tvs, it wasn't so bad eating by myself. The lady who took my order brought me out chips and salsa, which was neither bad nor good. The nachos, when they came out, weren't very flavorful. Unfortunately, even a place like Roberto's has this place beat by a mile. I was tre disappointed. 

The staff is friendly, but the food is very bland. I'm gonna stick with Yayo Taco.",OLn8EvPsu4hNug8V5PF2jA,2,0,2,Ud-rgNubHtHUNBZ3p7vf0Q

While their margaritas were cheap enough, I would pass on getting a drink here because either their margarita machines need a tune up or the staff (which might I add is friendly despite the poor quality of food/drinks) doesn't know how to properly make them.The chips and salsa were bland, as well as the enchilada.

Try it for experience, but other than that, Chipotle is only but a minute away.",5bT16QvBp6t33vIfqtJahg,0,0,2,eXRfKXQqGW9a5GwkG7pEMg
