They even have these nifty bowls that are split down the middle so you can order two different soups/noodles. I finally got the chance to have lunch there with my kids today. I wanted to my oldest to try the foods I grew up with as a kid in Korea.

We got the Jajang Myun (black bean noodles) / Champong (spicy seafood noodle soup) split bowl $9.72. I could tell immediately just by looking at the Jajang Myun that it wasn't going to be good. The sauce is supposed to be a deep rich brownish black color, loaded with onions, zucchinis, meat, and cucumbers. This was a light brown with onion bits, about 5 little bits of meat, and the rest were no where to be found. My daughter didn't really like it. Neither did I. I can actually make it better at home, which is quite sad.

The Champong was okay. It was the only part of the meal that didn't make me think, ""I paid like $10 for this?"" It had two pieces of head-on shrimp, one mussel, and good amount of calamari. The broth was just the right amount of spice, just a little thin on flavor. But it was definately the better of the two. Next time I think I'll just get the Champong by itself.",j5kD6MSrT63G2i6q9P2eaQ,1,1,2,z-VpRcKT8FR4wigKpHoWLA

I eat Champong a lot when at home in California, and my criteria for judging Champong is:

1)Is the soup spicy, but not so spicy that it takes away the taste?
2)Is there a good mixture of seafood?
3)Are the portions fair sized?

A big YES on all three at this place.

I had Champong and it was served with dumplings and kimchee, onions and pickled radish.

The sauce was ""blood"" red but had good flavor.

A very good value at less than $9.00",oskxMeN9rONwEjpo38n6-A,0,0,5,rQ54QIRnnBQi5eQheTQ_-g
5305008,2016-08-18,0,wraKox0MBW_w449VJXVenQ,Good taste! Just recommend! I and husband think the best Korean-Chinese restaurant in Vegas. (It's Korean Chinese. Make sure NOT ordinary Chinese restaurant!!) Try 'Cham-pong' if you like seafood-spicy noodle.,CbPYaHq_22eKfIpGBVQAgg,0,0,4,P4PhvJtGEAomcX7hnqvfRg
