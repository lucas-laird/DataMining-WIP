I tip 20%+ when ever I go to this bar no matter if I am losing or winning. But tonight Alicia asked me if I tipped my bartender after I cashed out of 3 different machines because I felt my luck was up. This is the same bartender I use to tip $100+ to every 2 weeks if not every week if I was doing good. I know I haven't been in for a while but no bartender has the right to ask that question to any customer.,hMhc-KYPk4WaZiVLE2sjNA,1,0,3,EWsMb8cK9CSxMQxs8GzO6Q

Are you kidding me? this is an insult to the regular customers. When business is down you promote, promote. Not insult with a 50 cent box of candy. You've lost my business",ZlzumJ7PeYqQMcoXF7TfPA,1,0,1,KvXMEFKcSH1pomSj9k8-HQ

The new cook Carlos is straight out of a restaurant in Mexico making all authentic plates.  Do yourself a favor and stip by for a drink, a smile and great food!",fmiAibc_y2nNTeXlQ9ENJg,0,0,5,u1o5479Y4rkol6aH0obo4A

Granted, we were boisterous, but we were also the only patrons in the bar and some of us were playing shuffleboard. She made no attempt to accommodate a party of 10 with full intentions of having a great time.  After the third snide comment, we let her know we were offended. When she did not change her demeanor, we closed out our tab knowing that with 10 people comes a big tab and tip. Jennifer made no attempt to  rectify the situation. Unfortunately, due to the experience, we will not return nor will we recommend.",WmFxltfr6xHIz-OxSKjHsg,2,0,1,bh83wviO2PDNA521C9fPFA

New to the area and i won't be returning!",Pk3NNea2RGy0urbN7W0O1Q,0,0,1,c_a2S7faVY1KmtmGI2nmwA

And so far the only decent bartenders are there before 12am.  Otherwise the graveyeard bartenders are jerks. Rude. And obviously hate being there.... The place is never packed at those hours. 4 or 5 people at the most not that hard or a job. Watching TV, and popping open a few beers not a hard job. The lease they could do is be nice. Maybe they'll get more business and better tips!",i2GHa229c4ORpNlGPK0M3w,2,0,2,xziZzItbhVpI8nI-Q0zF3w
