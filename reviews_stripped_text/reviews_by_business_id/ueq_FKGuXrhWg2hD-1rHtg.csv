There were no $5 happy hour apps; its $2 off regular menu prices in the Starters section",T78axJ1cQbBg5f5bz4tn1g,1,0,4,Kat96dKMkETN8tPDkGzfew

The facility is definitely impressive, considering that it located in the country club in the Summerlin area. I worked with their events coordinator, Stephanie Leonard and she was always on top of her game, friendly, smiling, and cooperative to fit our budget and needs.

They also offered us a dinner buffet which was worth the price per person, again, it depends on what you order and she would be able to make adjustments according to your budget. The food tasted great as well and kept me full for the evening!

They're a very maintained place with a bar inside as well. There's a outside patio/balcony that overlooks the gold course, and it has seating area there as well. I enjoyed this place too much to not give it 5-stars. The customer service was superb, as well as their food, and their facility. I haven't actually done any golfing but I would come back if I were to choose where to do so!

If you're looking for the perfect venue to book a mid-size (80-100) event, TPC Grille is the way to go! You can get a quote from their website and they will definitely impress you!

We tried The B.L.A.S.T. Sandwich with grilled salmon, bacon, quacamole, tomato and lettuce on sourdogh bread with fries.  We also had a Mushroom, Onion, Swiss Burger with carmelized onions and fries.  It hit the lunch craving head on.  

We enjoyed relaxing on the patio overlooking the greens, a water pond and the mountains n the distance while hummingbirds buzzed around the patio wall.  

On this day there was a Charity event and a helicopter landed right on the green next to the clubhouse!  It is ordinarily pretty quiet here but it was fun to have a lot of fun activity to observe today.

Great spot for a business lunch a golf outing or meeting up with friends.  I know I will be back soon!",VtLdzz_1olnpRU6AuSsEVg,2,2,5,8qMfpoxmruwkKEKyYrV-Dw

So off to have an early dinner since they close at 530.  It's very serene & also quiet with only 2 tables of customers at 4pm.  The food is pretty good for what you'd expect, bar food @ a golf course.  The menu's simple.  We tried the philly cheese steak with a side of fruit, frits & fries (chix finger w BBQ & ranch sce), and a salmon salad.   They have breakfast, too as well as a full bar.",FjIu5bf6dPW7_V_-0Jg4kQ,1,0,4,Fq8LYeN_YzRWKHFVuYnQGg

I've been meaning to try the TPC Grille for awhile but it never comes to mind when I'm out and about.  Today was different.  The other TPC course in our area is a private course, so this is where I headed today.

I got the Southwestern Eggs Benedict which according to the menu consists of roasted corn cakes, chorizo, fried eggs, chile cheddar cheese, pico, green onion, avocado, and breakfast potatoes.  In today's case, it was missing pico and avocado, but it was very good nonetheless.  I really enjoyed the flavor of the corn cakes and I liked the different take on Eggs Benedict by going with the corn cakes instead of an English muffin.  The corn cakes were very tasty!

Service was excellent. I sat at the bar and Theresa was the server.  She was a very pleasant woman and very efficient.  It was nice chatting with her about breakfast places and it was so nice looking out the windows at the view of the mountains on the west side of town.

The dining room is relatively small, but they have a nice outdoor seating area.  I'll have to come back when I can sit on the patio.  Right now, it's just too cold.  This was a very pleasant experience and I'm glad I came here.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,5,2,4,ixYGigqQ72CRziqCqMgQUA

The food served here is creative and quality.  It is not your run of the mill coffee shop food by no means.  The view is beautiful, too.  Open to the public and non-golfers!!!!!
