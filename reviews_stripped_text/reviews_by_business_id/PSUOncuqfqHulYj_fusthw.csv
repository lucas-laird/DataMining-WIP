As a fried pickle connoisseur, I can say that these are some of the best I have had and the Loaded Fries with chili and cheese are the stuff dreams are made of.  The burgers have been perfectly cooked both times as well and the topping choices are terrific!  The service is on point and the atmosphere is fun.

The boyfriend got a burger with cheddar-jack, guacamole, bacon, lettuce, and onions.  It didn't look all too appetizing, and we've had way tastier burgers.  I got a grilled cheese with  cheddar and pepper jack, and topped with onions and artichoke hearts.  The cheese wasn't even melted.  It was like they buttered two piece of bread and then sandwiched the cheese and toppings, put it on a plate, and then served it.  It was disappointing because how do you screw up a grilled cheese?  The onion rings were awesome!!  They were lightly battered and thin.  They were pretty much all I ate there.  Their fries were alright, nothing to rave about.  

I probably will not be coming back, even if the onion rings were delish.  I'd much rather go to In-N-Out or Smashburger.",EfOhaQ-J5s9t2EmH0uBELw,1,1,2,IQeRqOGTU63siM8hn1FtYQ

Enter the 50s themed diner to choose your burger size, up to a full pound, at reasonable prices.  All burger toppings are free, so mix and match to your stomach's content.  I went for the spiciness of jalapenos covered with the coolness of cole slaw, for a sloppy good burger.

If a big sloppy burger is not enough, add a basket of fries and onion rings with up to 5 dipping sauces to keep your fingers busy.

And there are too many milkshake flavors to comprehend.  You can even mix flavors, creating up to a ridiculous 378,000 flavors or something.  I decided on a nice Blueberry Pie shake to act as dessert.

124285,2012-04-18,2,PSUOncuqfqHulYj_fusthw,"There have been many times when I knew right away that I was in love with a burger, but rarely have I disliked one instantly. That is until now of course, in the case of Cheeburger Cheeburger. I actually stated ""I hate this bun"" as soon as I swallowed my first bite, and it only went downhill from there. Read on if you dare.

There are apparently many locations all over the country of this place, although I can't say it's really been on my radar aside from a few recommendations through friends in town. And after my experience, I'm not sure if I would consider these folks my friends... the interior is kind of like a stand-alone Johnny Rockets; 50's diner style right down to the cheesy neon and stainless steel on the walls. It's extremely gimmicky, and much worse than any Fatburger I've ever been near. It wasn't overly crowded the night I was there for dinner, but there were several families and it really confused me as to how this place is popular.

The menu offers burgers ranging from 1lb down to a 5.5 ounce 'beginner', along with chicken sandwiches, wraps, salads and the option of supposedly over 1,285,000 combinations of shakes. They offer some odd toppings such as peanut butter, pepperoni and salsa. I guess there are options for anyone looking to create a disgusting burger.

I was excited to see Heinz 57 sauce as an option, and mistakenly ordered it on my burger along with mushrooms, lettuce and tomato. As I said, upon first bite the bun turned me off; it was incredibly dry, had no flavor, and was way too thick and large for the sandwich. It was grilled and buttered on the inside, but that little bit of flavor couldn't compete with the vacuum of flavor created by the dryness. The meat was actually cooked quite well and had decent flavor, but the person I was eating with didn't have as much luck so I question their consistency and must assume I was lucky for now. My mushrooms had ok flavor but the small amount I was given got lost in the other flavors. And by other flavors I really just mean my Heinz 57 sauce, which completely took over the entire burger with its semi-BBQ flavor. I always thought I liked that sauce, but apparently not on burgers. I also must note that I only ordered the 1/3lb burger which I can easily handle, but this was so bad I only finished a little more than half.

The one positive factor of this meal was that because of my Foursquare check-in we were given a free order of small  1/2 fries and  1/2 onion rings. Both of them were ok; the fries were crispy and had decent flavor other than the couple of really undercooked ones that snuck in our basket. The onion rings were the thin, greasy, crispy battered type which I love, as opposed to the thick-breaded, hard to bite through variety. They were good, although I'm just not a huge fan of onion rings. They offer a few different dipping sauces; we went with the Zesty Horseradish sauce which was ok I guess.

By the time we were done with our meal we were completely dissatisfied and turned off by everything. We almost got mad that there were so many families and other people seemingly enjoying what they were eating. The only tasty parts of our meal were the Oreo and Peanut Butter Cup shakes we got, and that's not something I typically order. With the free fries and onion rings our meal cost $25.20, it would have been over $30 if those weren't free. This price does include $7.98 for two shakes, but is a bit too much for how unhappy we were. $6.99 for a burger isn't a bad price, especially off the strip, but what I was given I wouldn't pay for again. I'm not even going to sugarcoat it, just avoid this place.",0G9BcXSQscv_GnhlNwFfjw,1,1,1,fWXoBN64-yoLgfAb8Vh14A

161788,2015-06-29,2,PSUOncuqfqHulYj_fusthw,"I, like many Americans, come from a cheeseburger family. We don't eat pizza that often. So a fancy cheeseburger restaurant with a retro feel is right up my alley. I'd take my grandfather here if he didn't commit suicide by refusing to take his blood pressure medicine for a month, resulting in a stroke. Because he would have loved it. He would have told me stories about how Hank Williams would have to hand Elvis Presley a gun if they ever fought just so that Elvis could even stand a chance at beating him. He really loved Hank WIlliams, thought Johnny Cash was too much of a prissy though.

But I digress, I love getting to live out an A1 steaksauce commercial from the 2000s. Steaksauce, on a burgerrr? Yes, it's that important. Fried pickles, mushrooms, artichoke hearts, and even more deep fried goodies are usually ordered instead of fries too. So I'm straight ballin' when I come here. It's all good.

165816,2010-09-26,1,PSUOncuqfqHulYj_fusthw,"I've been really wanting to try this place ever since I missed out on the UYE 1 pound burger challenge. This place tries to have a fun 50's diner vibe like Johnny Rocket's or Ruby's Diner. However unlike those 2 places, it has this garish pink neon lighting which detracted from the atmosphere. I didn't have very high expectations for this place, but my experience still fell far short. My friend and I each ordered a Cheeplatter for $12.99 which consisted of a 1/2 pound Black Angus burger with your choice of fixings, fries or onion rings, house salad or coleslaw, choice of dipping sauce, no drink included. As a portent of things to come, the salad was unappetizing and consisted of far too much shredded cheese and hard croutons and too little greens. I had asked for the burger to be cooked medium and got something between rare and medium rare and served lukewarm. The fries were also lukewarm and soggy. My friend had chosen coleslaw instead of the salad and received 2 tiny plastic condiment containers worth. He normally loves coleslaw but did not find it worth eating. The service while friendly was on the slow side when it came to water refills. From reading the other reviews, maybe I came on an off night. Sadly I may never know because I don't see a reason to subject myself to their food ever again. Next time I have a burger craving, you'll find me at In-N-Out or Smashburger, or even BK or McD's.",LkWNo83Lg92C5V4JEyxOZA,4,2,1,3pWeyDHt3kOnMffybuXlyg

There are signs posted in the restaurant saying good things comes to those that wait, and we sure did wait! I understand food cooked to order & I don't mind waiting for good food, but this was anything but. The burger itself was average at best and not very hot. The meat was bland, unseasoned, & dry. Both burgers were ordered with cheddar cheese and both burgers were served without cheese of any kind. The french fries were dark brown & cold. They were overcooked and tasted as though they had been sitting for some time. Our server, who disappeared, never came back to ask how the food was or if we needed anything. We flagged down another waitress to have the table cleared & to get our check. That waitress didn't ask about the two servings of uneaten fries or if she could get us anything else.

I have been there a few times, and I love it. it is your average 50's motif burger joint, with a twist. There are 5 different sizes from the Classic at 5.5 ounces to the Pounder at a whopping 20 ounces before cooking. Now you get to choose your Cheese from a choice of 8 cheeses (there are no hamburgers on the menu, however the cook will gladly forgo the cheese if you want). That is only the beginning, you can choose between 29 different toppings and just for a little more you can add another 5 toppings. I am not sure how many different combinations you can make; however, the fun is experimenting to see just what you can come up with and try as many different combinations as you can. When you finish the Pounder, you get your picture taken and placed on the wall, or in a little book they will show you of different people who came with a Cheeburger Cheeburger appetite.

And that is just the beginning. You need to experience Cheeburger Cheeburger on your own. So when you are in Las Vegas just follow Rainbow Blvd south, and it will be on your left, you have to look out for it, because you can miss it (and that would be a sad experience).

The fries and onion rings are average. If you are into old school milk shakes they have a vast selection of flavors and you can create your own combination. The place is clean and large so I can't imagine someone will have problems finding a table. It is great for kids and large families. The staff is very friendly. Prices are fair. Parking is also not a problem neither. So, as I said, this is a great option for a quick bite if you are not in the mood for one of the traditional fast food places, but you can get better (gourmet) burgers somewhere else in town. Ohh no alcohol beverages, so if you like to enjoy a burger with a beer..well not your place.

945437,2010-08-20,0,PSUOncuqfqHulYj_fusthw,"Worst burger in Vegas...  Probably the worst burger anywhere.  

My wife and I walked in one night around 7:30 and there was not a single person in the place...  we should have walked out.  Well, I really wanted a burger, so we ordered.  The kids working there seemed more interested in playing around than cooking our food.  After about 25 minutes we finally got our food.  We made the 3 minute drive home and were so disappointed.  Bottom line, the burger was undercooked and the meat smelled horrible, the frys were soggy with rancid smelling oil dripping off of them, and even the soda was bad (no carbonation).  My wife stopped after 1 bite and I struggled through 2 or 3 bites.

I will never go back to this place...  they will never get a second chance to make a first impression (on my wife and I, at least).

CC is about 5 miles from my new casa - kinda of an unusual location. parking sucks. has the 50's diner feel. 

so i go for the 1/2 pounder, medium, blue cheese, sauteed onions ( for a 50's diner, should they be grilled onions or sauteed onions ? ) a basket 0f fries and onion rings ( the menu says for 1-2 people, i say it's for 2-4 people ) and an almond joy malt. Total cost - $20 !! damn, that's an expensive brunch ! 

the burger - cooked medium - i'm impressed with that, but no seasoning to it - call me picky but i just feel a burger tastes better when it's seasoned while cooking as opposed to salting/peppering it after its cooked . also, the meat itself fell apart a little too easily. I still liked the burger but i liked the fries/onion rings but charge a $1 for a dipping sauce ?!? that's bullshit ! 

the malt ? needed more malt, the coconut taste not too noticeable at the beginning of the malt, but very strong at the end. 

And this big deal over eating a 1 pound burger ? come on - at least a 2 pounder if not a 3 pounder to go through all the hubbub !

1140743,2010-03-22,0,PSUOncuqfqHulYj_fusthw,"I am torn between a 3 or 4 star rating. Cheeburger offers a several different sizes patties, from a 1/3 lb. up to a full 1 lb. The meat is nice and flavorful and the vast amount of toppings makes the experience a lot of fun. Many of the toppings are included in the price of the burger and unlimited. The biggest problem I have is that I don't necessarily care for the bun. It's somewhat chewy and takes away from the overall satisfaction of the burger. For example, I think Fuddrucker's has the best burger bun in town. Their bun makes their burger a great burger. I would rate this place a solid 4 stars if they found a way to improve the bun. 

The fries and rings are excellent. I like that the rings are battered and not breaded. They also have a nice selection of salads and ice cream desserts which I have not tried. The service has always been excellent. The staff is very friendly and helpful. Because of the fries/rings and service, I am giving a 4 star rating. Burgers alone would have only earned them 3 stars from me. It's very close to home, so I would see myself going back out of convenience.",jodPtzKf6CrxxlubsFyyIQ,2,2,3,A48zEKCP5L3-gWx5neia5w

The negative reviews I read almost kept me from coming here but I went with my gut since it was really in the mood for a good solid malt.  
I was not disappointed.  
The service from the moment you walk in the door is extremely friendly.  Albeit it may be considered a bit slow for some people, my family and I are usually never in a rush when we go out and are always just happy to enjoy the moment of being out and knowing that we dont have to clean up.  
The menu is quite expansive and with all of the different combinations that they offer, it is easy to find something to your liking.  Obviously it is a burger joint but they have plenty of other things if that is not your taste.  
My wife and I both had burgers and our 5 year old who never eats chicken fingers not only asked for them but ate them up.  
The food was cooked well and the flavors were spot on.  The malt we ordered took a bit longer than I thought it should, but SO worth the wait.  And for $6 it was huge.  I can pay nearly the same thing at Red Robin and get half the size malt.  
The place gets top marks for atmosphere.  Like others have stated, you would not know that this place is total 50's retro from the outside.  
For two burgers, fries, onion rings, chicken fingers, a large malt and a half malt (for our son) the check was $35.  To me that is a total winner.  
You will have to make your own judgement but my family will certainly be back.  
On a side note, the onion rings are wonderful.  Just a thin light batter so they are not all breading and grease like most you get at other places.",9kMi8dCXhj0i08a41DSVqw,1,0,4,kao2_Olf_XzIGXWCByKOgA

1380574,2012-11-03,0,PSUOncuqfqHulYj_fusthw,"I had visited this place for the first time due to a fundraiser for the organization, UNLV Circle K International. Both me and my friend weren't that hungry so we each got a custom shake and shared the ""Best of Both"" which was fries and onion rings. 

The custom shake i got contained oreos, cookie dough, and white chocolate. I had ordered the regular size so it came in the metal container they used to make it in. Decent size. Flavors were good and lots of cookie dough. Though for some odd reason, it tasted a bit sweeter than i had preferred. My friend had gotten pineapple and ?????. Not as sweet. Tasted pretty good actually. 

When the fries and onion rings came. It was eh. Reason for that is because the fries were unevenly sized so some burned during the frying process while some were good. I hope they dont expect people to eat the burnt crispy ones. T_T we had ordered the horseradish dipping sauce too. waiter said it was good with the onion rings. i didnt taste any horshradish at all. disappointing. ketchup and their special seasoning (strong in black pepper and whatever seasoning that gave the sour taste) was better. 

A lot of my friends had gotten burgers (ranging from 1/4 lb to 1lb to even the 2lb). the 1/4 lb and the 1 lb looked decent. Good thing about this place is you can almost add any topping on there.  Reason why i said it looked decent was (refer to my picture of the 2lb)... that looks almost disgusting. Then again, 2lb of ground meat is kind of hard to cook together... 

Some people were complaining about some smell but i had not smelled anything until later in the night. One of my friends had ordered their 1lb burger late (they came late) and the burger had passed by me. I had smelled this disgusting smell. One of my other friends believe its the cheese but i highly highly doubt it. Melted swiss cheese does NOT give that kind of smell. Or rather almost any melted cheese. Me and my friend who didnt eat much came to the hypothesis about either it being unfresh meat or some odd seasoning or way it was cooked that made it produce such a smell. Once i had smelled it, i actually was happy i didnt have much of an appetite earlier and order a burger. 

No one complained about the taste so i guess the taste was good, which was the reason i had not put this at 1 star. The onion rings were decent as well as the fries, aside from the burnt pieces. Most of the burgers looked decent aside from the 2lb one that looked like it was falling apart. 

If u were to ask me if i were to come here again, for the shakes, maybe. But for the burgers, most likely not. 

But pricing, here's to give you an idea for the outrageous sized ones.

I had the chili cheese fries, onion rings, and a 1/2 pound burger with a strawberry/banana shake. You can select from a ton of toppings for your burger, and they offer a half-dozen different types of sauces. The burger was very juicy and tasty. I just wish the bun could support all the toppings and juice before becoming soggy toward the last four-five bits.

You could spend a good half-hour just looking over the selections for shakes. They offer numerous freshly made shake combinations. I loved my shake! The onion rings were great along with the seven selections of dipping sauces. The chili cheese fries with jalapeño slices were also very good. 

They sing happy birthday and have a hamburger challenge at Cheeburger Cheeburger that can make the restaurant loud at times.

We have been twice and, although my husband likes the burgers, I am just not convinced yet.  It is possible that I have not tried the right combination yet.

On our first visit, I had the chicken wrap with avocado.  Except it was not avocado - it was more of a guacamole spread.  It lacked the fresh avocado taste that I was expecting.  The fries on this occasion were a bit hit and miss with the seasoning but good overall and the onion rings were nice - with soft rather than crisp breading.

Today I tried the Bleu Chicken which includes swiss and bleu cheese.  The first problem is that the chicken is about half the size of the bread.  I can deal with this because the grilled sourdough bread is nice with cheese.  The other problem I had is that the swiss cheese had a really strong taste.  Of course, this is my personal preference but it was a little off-putting.  The fries this time were seasoned perfectly and uniformly.  Also, we ordered the half ""best of both"" as we did with our first visit but there seemed to be so much more in the basket today (certainly not a bad thing!!!).

So, I have not written off Cheeburger Cheeburger.  The chicken is moist and the fries taste good.  I think that I just need to find the combination that works for me.  I will definitely try it again - especially since I joined their mailing list and receive coupons regularly.

I am the hamburglar.
I can't get enough damn hamburgers, I could eat one a day,seriously.
I heard of this place from my sister who does nothing but rave,wear their shirts, and apparently gets free sodas.
I thought the 50's motif was pretty cool-seems like the way of the diner has damn near gone the way of the dinosaur,here in Vegas. They have all the decor and look, plus they actually play music from the 50's that everyone is singing in there,lol.
I was impressed by the extensive menu options, mind you,there aren't many types of things to order,for example:
Specialize in a few types of burgers, but tons of available toppings at no extra charge. you can customize your soda, milkshake, malt, coffee, and sundae/banana split. Also they serve fries and onion rings with different dipping sauces.
I don't know about you, but I am a HUGE SUCKER for variety/choices and this place fit the bill. 

our food order:
Me-1/3 hamburger,done med. pickles,tomato,lettuce,fresh onion.
hubby-angus cheeplatter with salad,onion rings
kiddo-fried mac and cheese with carrots and ranch in flaming car!!

As far as burgers go, we both agreed the outside seemed a little underdone, and I did notice there wasn't any seasoning,but still good.

drink order:
me-pear,mango shake a soda,free refills!! 1/2 banana-chocolate-PB shake (half size seemed big, it was as big as my soda!)
kiddo-birthday cake shake

All of us tasted each others things and were very pleased. My shake was fricken amazing, and I'm glad I didn't order anything else.I  was stuffed.

I heard of bad reviews mostly consisting of slow service-we had one waiter covering the whole damn store, and he was quick to refill and take away everything. Love it. good job Chris.

Fries and Rings: half fries and half onion rings. the medium is enough for 2-4 people, especially if you order a serious sized burger. They weren't that great.. They had 4 different dips to choose from, I liked the Creamy Jalapeno sauce (the rest I wont even bother to write about). I still prefer Ketchup.

Watermelon Iced Tea and Watermelon Lemonade: Both Refreshing and I love that it was served in a glass jar. 

Many Variety of Burger sizes/toppings, flavored beverages, shakes/malts, sauces.... Everything very customizable. I didn't like the fact they charged for almost every little thing (refills on certain drinks and dipping sauce..). The Service was decent, Ambiance like a retro diner or Johnny Rockets and then add a whole bunch of flourescent pink neon lights! Value, on the negative side with all things considered.. They do have a Burger challenge: ""Our Famous Pounder"" or 20 ounces! I barely finished the 3/4 pound (1 step below in size).. But for kicks and a picture of me tacked on their Cheeburger Cheeburger ""Wall of Famers"", it maybe worth a try one day!",mY3mROf28N-vY1fpR-FFUw,2,1,3,imWOBhRnoYYaPLRRiwjoZg

2012486,2011-03-07,0,PSUOncuqfqHulYj_fusthw,"My visit here was such a major let down. Going in, I was quite excited. The choices seemed endless and my mind was working overtime creating various concoctions of burgers and shakes. But alas, it was all in vain.

The exterior is rather deceptive. It can be easy to drive right by this place. And the outside doesn't even hint at the inside. But I found the inside to be a bit of a let down. 50s diner themes can be great. But this place felt like they phoned it in.

Before reviewing the menu, I had already decided on my custom milkshake. One of my absolute favorite milkshakes I've ever had was a ""freckle face"" (chocolate chip). And here was my opportunity to have that again and add a little something extra, like perhaps coconut. But upon looking at the menu, I discovered that they don't have chocolate chips. Undeterred and still feeling optimistic, I opted for the Almond Joy. When my shake arrived, though, it was basically a chocolate milkshake with some generic flavoring labeled ""Almond Joy"". There were no chunks (like the menu pictures had led me to believe) or great flavors or anything. And I don't know why they even bothered serving it with a spoon - it was all liquidity, no thickness.

For a starter / side, I opted for a half order of half fries, half onion rings. And I, of course, had a mini freak out when I saw the dipping sauces (I have a major love for dipping sauces) and was compelled to order the foursome (one of each of their sauces). Another let down. The fries were delicious, but the onion rings were too greasy to eat. And the only dipping sauce that was edible was the cheese sauce (which was totally out of a can). Though, I guess when it comes to value, I can say that the half order was huge and enough for a family of 4.

For the burger, I went with the 1/3 lb., medium, with bacon, blue cheese, lettuce, and tomato. I figured it was a rather safe, non-crazy choice - so I could be sure to judge the burger on the burger, as opposed to the win or fail of some crazy flavor combination. When the burger arrived, it looked great. I cut it in half and it looked like a perfect medium. But after the first bite, I was seriously underwhelmed. There was zero flavor. How could a burger be flavorless? It was medium and pink, but not juicy. It was pretty much inedible. Now, I am hoping that perhaps this place is just hit or miss. My friend had been here before, and ordered the exact same burger, and loved it. And even he (who was along this trip to watch me eat) agreed that the burger this time was quite bad.

So despite the service being good and there being some neat things (like a photo album on each table with pictures of the 1 lb. burger challenge), the food was not good.",YMgZqBUAddmFErxLtCfK_w,1,1,2,NLZ2zqJeqUMLFAqyRc5-SQ

On the plus side: 

They greet you when you walk in the door, the staff is very friendly, and the menus are clear with pictures of what you get to order. The meat tasted fresh. The prices were reasonable and the portions were large.

The downside: 

They only serve medium or more done burgers. I am a fan of a medium rare burger (leaning towards rare) so my medium burger tasted medium well like there was a hint of pink (barely) and the outside was super done The french fries were burned AND cold.

We also stayed 30 minutes past closing without knowing, and he did not rush us at all! Just the service alone gives this place 5 stars!

A few of us did the pounder challenge (where we eat the full pounder and get our picture taken and placed up on the wall). There are a LOT of different toppings to choose from, and a few premium ones as well. The burger was a bit messy to eat, but hey, what else do you expect from a one pound burger, right? The burger itself was delicious. The only complaint I have about it is the beef patty... It could have been seasoned a bit more, because there were times where I tasted nothing but beef. No seasoning on the inside, whatsoever, and the sauces I picked for my burger did not seem to reach my taste buds as I was munching down on the ginormous beef patty.

0f course my burger had a bunch of toppings and I got the classic burger, which is the smallest. It was good size and delicious. I decided on onion rings, grilled onions, lettuce, chipotle mayo, ranch dressing, bacon, jalapeños. Omg hit the spot. Spicy yet crunchy.

We order the mix basket of fries and onion rings. I found the fries to taste fresh, no frozen. Could use a little more salt and I didn't like that the onion rings were not very crunchy. They got chewy and were soggy compared to others I've had else where

The raspberry lemonade they have is delicious and I highly recommend it. Good bye soda! Wish I could get the recipe.

We ordered:
Basket with fries and onion rings
Kid's meal with 3 chicken tenders, apple sauce, and apple juice
The pounder with lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, guacamole, bacon, and mayonnaise 

The basket was brought out first so we pounced at the sight of it. The onion rings were completely demolished because they were delectable. The thing I hate most about onion rings is when you take one bite and the onion slides out of the batter, leaving you to feel like a fatty just eating the fried battered part of what used to be an onion ring. Not these! I easily bit right through the gluttonous batter and sweet onion every time. 

The kid's meal was great. My 4 year old thought the fact that it came in a car was pretty amusing and the chicken tenders were large enough for my two children to share. It came with a side of ranch which I thought was quite tasty and admittedly dipped some onion rings in it when the kids weren't looking. We opted for the apple sauce which ended up being Mott's but I don't think children really care for flashy apple sauce anyway.  

Now, my husband and I shared the pounder and we were very very full afterward. We ordered it cooked medium well which the server said would be a little pink, but unfortunately there was no pink. I thought it was still juicy but my husband said it was on the dry side. My issue with the burger was the meat to bun and toppings ratio. As a woman, I like to take my large servings of meat with some veggies, but there was just so much meat that it was making a toppings landslide out of my slightly soggy bun.

First, the place gets dings for it's location. It's practically in the boonies, quite the haul from the Strip. It has to be a ""destination"" spot, and it doesn't quite rise to that level. 

I had the above-mentioned burger, with fries & a raspberry lemonade. The drink is small, served in a mason jar, and is but ""flavored,"" not a raspberry in sight. No tang to it whatsoever. The fries were perry good, and the ""small"" is a vary good portion.

The burger looked impressive. I got just the basics. Lettuce, tomato, onion, & pickles. In my opinion, too many pickles, not enough onion. The bun was about the right size, but toasting it (a good thing) also left it a bit dried out, which meant it broke apart too easily. I ate far too much with my fork instead of my fingers. The burger itself was OK. A nice bit of crunch on the outside from the grill. It wasn't really thick and juicy, as I would have expected 20 oz. of ground beef to be.

Second, when I came here the most recent time, it was not like my first. Im gonna make this short and simple for you non readers. The burger was tasteless. I understand the reason for the unlimited amount of toppings you can add to your burger. But even A-1 steaksauce, chipotle sauce and banana peppers cant hide the taste of dry ground beef. Come on Cheeburger, even Chili's has their own flavor!!! I was very disappointed when I came back here, but im over it now since I wont be back again.",v63s_QngaH6ywFMNM_YclA,0,1,2,6pBX2Zh4fEANdjT82XbIdQ

The one pounder is a burger patty that is one pound after cooking which was a nice treat. The meat was cooked well and you are able to choose from a very ample list of free toppings. The patty was a little too greasy for my liking, and the bottom bun was soaked through by the time I finished. This location is not that close to where I live so it will probably not get a repeat visit, but I did get to take my picture with a giant plush hamburger after finishing the challenge so there's that.",ZWTR80zMUGlfcYMjTSQm0A,0,0,3,kzrgd_sSRNfp4-TJ4aOYDQ
2732714,2010-03-04,0,PSUOncuqfqHulYj_fusthw,"This is hands down my favorite buger in town. I've been to Burger Bar, Fuddruckers, etc. but the meat, toppings, fries and rings, and shakes all make the grade here and cost a little less as well. 

The fries/onion rings basket mix is a favorite to share between my boyfriend and I, and with the cheese sauce dip we couldn't ask for anything better. The other sauces were okay, we weren't too thrilled with them, but the fries and rings can stand on their own without the sauces so we're okay with just the cheese sauce. 

The meat patty itself could also stand on its own, and it's always so fresh and tender that it still falls apart as you bite into it. You can actually taste the meat flavor in it, which I think is something of a rare find for burgers these days that are drenched in salt and sauces.  Not that I don't like those too, but this patty is definitely the kind that you savor and enjoy. Furthermore, the toppings are to die for and if I could have them all on my burger at once, I'd totally be game to try it just to see if it's physically possible. 

The milkshakes, which I guess pretty much everyone else agrees with, were to die for and are customizable to your own taste. My boyfriend has gotten pretty good with the flavor experimenting and we've had everything from a chocolate-covered pretzel shake (which actually had crushed pretzels in it), to a birthday cake shake that forced images of an insane birthday clown into my mind. Fun, exciting, and dangerous if not controlled properly. 

The reason why I'm giving this place 3 stars is because of the service. And from reading the previous reviews, I think I'm the only one who may feel this way. I don't know if it's just coincidence, bad luck, or bad timing, but it seems that everytime we pay Cheeburger Cheeburger a visit, the service we receive gets progressively worse and worse. It wasn't bad at first, and we're well aware that it takes at least 15 minutes for the food to come out because it's freshly made, but for one person's burger to come 30+minutes after the rest of our table's food has come out is ridiculous. So is the notorious lack of drink refills, the long waits in between giving the wait staff our check and getting it back, the forgotten drinks and other side orders, etc. I don't think that we're a very demanding table either, since I've worked in food service, and we're pretty frequent diners around town, but it really spoils the experience of the food when the service is bad. Which is really too bad, because I personally think Cheeburger has the best burgers in town hands down. 

Sorry for the ranting at the end, but I hope that the service improves soon because I keep wanting to bring people back with me to show them the glory of the Cheeburger, but remembering about how bad the service was makes me think twice about doing so.",T5vVvAqlZiKcPIXS857kQg,3,0,3,7NA8JtspWqALtAzllI4HAw
2759546,2014-12-08,7,PSUOncuqfqHulYj_fusthw,"As soon as I checked in here I was tempted to go to the edit settings on my Yelp app to correct the spelling. Turns out that's how they wanted it. 

First off, do not plan on eating here if you have any kind of time restraint. We came on a saturday afternoon at about 12:15. We were expecting it to be packed since it was lunch time but the place was about 40 percent full. So we were thinking we should have enough time to get to our 2 pm appointment. Well, it took about 10 minutes before our server came over to take our order. Since it was our first time, we had some questions to ensure our order was correct.

Since they are called Cheeburger Cheeburger, of course we were going to try their namesake. How it works is this. You select what size 100 percent angus beef patty. How you want it cooked (medium, medium well, or well). Pick your bun (honey wheat or kaiser roll). Pick your cheese (9 to choose from). Finally, pick your toppings (26 to choose from including peanut butter). Keep in mind that you can only have 1 of each topping and cheese for free. Any doubling there is an extra charge.

So I chose a 1/2 Pound Serious Burger ($7.99) cooked medium with pepper jack cheese on a kaiser roll. For the toppings I chose lettuce. tomatoes, onions, jalapenos, pineapple, roasted red peppers, and chipotle sauce. I also added bacon for 99 cents because it is not one of their free toppings. The taste? It was just decent. The beef patty itself didnt have too much flavor. Im glad the toppings I selected all went together really good flavorwise. I ordered the half pounder because I realized that the price was only for the burger. No sides at all. I should of ordered the next size down because we ended up ordering a fries/onion rings combo to go with it.

We got the medium sized Best of Both Basket (4.99) which feeds 2 to 3 people. This combination of fries and onion rings were just ok. The fries themselves were a little bit thicker than McDonalds fries but smaller than steak fries. The onion rings were really good. You can tell it was just freshly battered and deep fried because of the consistency of the crunch it produced. Dont forget you can add free toppings to these sides as well.

My wife and older son orderd the 1/3 Pound Semi Serious Burger ($6.99) and chose their options as well.

Service is pretty much the main reason why im giving them 3 stars. Everything seemed to take forever from the moment we received the menus. By the time we got the check to pay, it was already 1:30 so we had to leave right away.

Some random info:They also have wraps, sandwiches, and salads that the free toppings apply to as well not to mention milkshakes that you can create over 1,258,000 flavor combinations from. Hours are everyday 11 am to 9 pm. They just opened a new location in Anthem (Basically Henderson) off of Eastern and St. Rose Parkway. Their biggest patty is 1 pound (20 oz before cooking). If you finish all of that you get to have your picture taken and put on the wall.

Overall, the food here is decent but the really slow service needs some improvement. I can understand you cook everything from scratch since the place was only about 40 percent occupied, imagine having a full house. Then you definitely dont want to have any plans scheduled too close to a dining episode here. Im willing to try them again at a future date.

This little burger joint can be found on the east side of Rainbow, just south of Windmill Drive. It's kind of tucked away in there a bit, so you have to look out for it or you may miss it!

I do love the whole 50's Diner theme! It's a fun festive theme. It reminds me a lot of the 5 and Diner restaurant we used to go to as kids back in Phoenix back in the 80's (Do they even still have 5 and Diner locations open anywhere anymore??).

People here were very nice and friendly and the service was attentive. The young man who was our server was great about explaining everything and answering questions. After we received our food another lady stopped by and welcomed us and asked us how everything was going. We were pretty impressed with the service here from that standpoint.

I ordered a ""Semi-Serious Burger"", while my friend ordered a ""Serious Burger"".  We also decided to split a combo side of fries and onion rings. It is great how you can ""build your own burger""! You have so many great options and combinations you can try! I had a pineapple on my burger!

Let me tell you, the burgers are pretty damn good! They were thick and juicy! The fries were thicker cut and not your standard generic  McDonalds/BK/JITB type fries. This is definitely a good thing! Onion rings were ginormous and pretty tasty as well!

The 2 big strikes against this place that drove us a little crazy was..

1) the service, while super nice, is painfully slllllooooooowwwwww...seriously, I thought they might have been killing the cow back there.

2) it is freezing in this place! It was like a meat locker in there! You realize it is November right now right? 

This is yet another perfect example of when I wish Yelp! had a 3.5 star rating. That feels like the perfect rating for this place at this time. That being said we will definitely be back again soon and I can easily see this place bumping up to 4 stars pretty quickly.

* It attempts to have a diner feel, but the decor feels like its trying way too hard to LOOK like a diner when it looks like someones garage with a collection of diner memorabilia.
* It was a slow night and the server rushed us through the order even when I asked her numerous times to gives us a few minutes please. I think the entire experience from walking in to leaving was less than 25 minutes.
*The basket of fried pickles was the highlight of my meal.
*The hamburgers were a big old mess of ingredients most of which ended up in the basket, not in our mouths. My medium well burger was VERY pink. In my opinion, the meat and the bun lacked flavor so much so, that I would not return.

Where else can you get a burger with Eleventy Billion toppings, pretty solid O-rings, and a malt, served by friendly staff in a pretty timely manner?

The Best way to sum up Cheeburger is imagine if a Fuddruckers and a Malt Shop had a baby, that my friends is Cheeburger.

My only major complaint is that for a burger, o-rings, and a malt, the tab can be a little high, but the quality makes up for it.

There are probably a million different combos of toppings/sauces you can put on your burger, and they will custom blend any flavor of malt that you can dream up. They also have Eggcreams (my NY roommate said they were pretty damn good), and a few other delicacies that you can't get at many places in town.

Fries were fresh, but a bit over cooked and in so many random sizes it felt like we got the bottom of the batch.  Tons of topping options all at no additional charge, which was good, because the burgers were more than a bit pricey in my book.  Frequent refills on drinks, which was nice.

Points against:  Burger which was ordered ""Medium"", their least cooked option, was cooked to the consistency of shoe leather.  Not a good burger.  Bun, which I presume was special to their location, was stale.  We were one of four tables in the restaurant, and it was  quite a while before we were served our food...not sure what that is about...maybe that is how long it takes to cook the flavor and life out of a hamburger.

Exhibit A: The 1 lb burger was not that impressive, I wanted to try to get it down so I could get my picture on the walls and in the little books, but I decided not to.  I was expecting a monstrosity of a burger and it was just a big piece. I've made bigger burgers on my grill at home and there were 10 year old kids posing for the pictures. If 10 year olds can knock that down, i'm not impressed! haha.
Exhibit B: for a root beer float, they charged $5, and for a fountain drink, they charged $2.99. That's strip prices, and this isn't the strip, this is on rainbow in an area that I assume doesn't get that much traffic. But hey, power to em if they can continue to get people to pay it. It was a hot day (duh, it's vegas in late June) Wednesday and I got a RB float so i guess they got me!

The price was good for the amount of toppings they allowed. There were about 25 things you can add to your burger for no extra charge, including a bunch of veggies and sauces, and you could even add two onion rings to your burger. Bacon was an extra charge, I think it was about $2~

Mostly it was a great experience, and the 7 ounce burger was a perfect size with the order of fries we all split and the root beer float for me. I was happy and next time I'm craving a Cheeburger I might swing over to this spot.

3180899,2011-07-06,1,PSUOncuqfqHulYj_fusthw,"This place is the best burger place in town. I've eaten here more than enough times to catch every shift change, every waitress and every cook and all that I can say is that these cheeburgers are heaven sent. Some of these other reviews mention slow service, and  less than exceptional food. I must defend my favorite burger place by saying that the ""slow service""  is to blame on your fresh not frozen made-to-order meat. If you go back to the cook's line, I guarantee you're not going to see a mass of pre-cooked burgers. It takes time to create perfection. If you don't have the know how to create your own perfect burger, then shame on you, not on Cheeburger for your less than exceptional food. As their menu states, there literally thousands of topping combinations and if you can't find ONE to suit you then that sounds to me like a personal problem. :) 
As I was saying, there are tons of topping combinations to choose from, more than enough burger sizes- ranging from a measly 1/3 pound to 1 full pound of cooked beef. Speaking of 1 pounders- if you eat the whole thing you get your picture taken and put on the wall of fame for all to see. Pretty spiffy. (Look for my brother: a repeat offender) Top off your burger with unlimited FREE toppings- how can you go wrong? And, I think I'd be selling this place short if I weren't to mention their gigantic flavor menu for their shakes and malts, which are supreme. I've never tried any of their other menu items (there are quite a few choices other than burgers & fries), but I'm sure they are good too. The prices are justified for the serving sizes and phenomenal tastebud stimulation that you receive. If you want a burger, Pepsi and fries, all for $5 that's short on size, bland and pre-cooked- try Burger King; but good luck to you.
To make this review a lot shorter than it should be, I will sum up by saying that if you don't try this place and eat a CHEESEBURGER (for which they are named) then you're not getting the full experience here.

Cheeburger has a build your own burger/salad/chicken sandwich menus with toppings for days. They also offer veggie and turkey patties, too. I always opt for the smaller burger with bbq sauce, onion rings, cheddar cheese, bacon and a side of ranch. The flavor of the patty is what steals my heart. It has a black pepper flavor and not overwhelmingly salty like other places. One suggestion would be to ask them to cut it in half for you. Even the smallest burger is big! Now onto the onion rings and fries.......love, love, love. I always have to get the Best of Both basket which has both of them. The rings are crispy and light without being so oily. While the fries taste is simple and cooked to perfection. Don't forget to order the different sauces. My favorites other than plain ranch are the cheese sauce and the sweet chili sauce. Yum!!!! Now for my favorite thing on the menu. The shakes! Wow, you can order almost any combination of shake imaginable. I have sucked down a Rice Krispie Treat shake, Birthday Cake, Apple Pie Ala Mode, Mint Chip, etc. I would have to say I am now in a committed relationship with the Chocolate shake with M&Ms and caramel now:)

The menu says you can have as many toppings as you want on your burger. What I didn't realize was that having my onions grilled would cost an extra buck. The bun was soft and fresh. Meat was a little over cooked for my having ordered ""medium"" but it was still juicy.

Onion rings were awesome. French fries needed to be ordered well done. It's like In N' Out Burgers in that the potatoes are fresh but the fries ain't so good.

Bummer that each sauce you order for dipping is a buck.

All these little extra charges add up.

We basically got one cheeseburger, a small combo of fries and onion rings, a soda and a juice and our bill was $21 not including  tip. The 2 sauces and my grilled onions added some of that extra cost.

Although the meal was tasty, because of the price, I probably won't be coming back anytime soon.",qQecSd0lynfB4g-LPa9JCw,1,1,3,Vgwf9QLGJe5q9c8eu41B6A

To that she replied: Cheeburger Cheeburger.

I booked marked this into my phone and then the very next day I planned with my coworkers to try this place out.

The time came and we drove further than usual for lunch to try this place out.  I was so excited and so hungry, I could not wait to get one of those juicy burgers in my mouth!

What followed was deplorable.

Our party of 7 was greeted and seated promptly.  
5 minutes later our drink order were taken. 
5 minutes later our drinks were received.
5 minutes later our order were taken.
25 minutes later our food was brought out to our table.

We were starving.  We were in pain.  We were at the mercy of Cheeburger Cheeburger.  But they were relentless in their torture for us.

My friend ordered a Chicken Salad with the works and he was very full and loved his salad.

I ordered a Serious Burger on Honey Wheat Bun, Medium, with Swiss, Grilled Onion and Mushrooms, BACON, LETTUCE and TOMATO!

What I received was a a Semi-Serious Burger on Honey Wheat Bun, Medium Well, with Swiss, Grilled Mushrooms SANS BACON, LETTUCE AND TOMATO.  I was defeated.  I was hungry.  I couldn't complain for risk of my food disappearing another 5 minutes.  Instead after 40 minutes of waiting, our food was gone in 5.

I just ate it the way THEY wanted to and finished it quickly.  Our lunch time was running out.

We paid and left.  And we left unfulfilled and disappointed.  We were in awe of our let down.  We were taught a lesson never, ever to be this excited for food again...

Refills were sparse.  Food was good.  If only I got it MY way and if only I had more refills and if only food could've came out faster.   When we got there, there were only 3 other tables sat. And two of them already had their food.  Were they short-staffed?  

Anyway, this place was decided that it's good ""on occasion"" when we have extra time.  Other than that, this place can't be a frequent lunch joint for us.

Every single day of my life I pass Cheeburger Cheeburger and laugh at the name. I figured it was like Chili's or Buffalo Wild Wings; turns out it's closer to a Johnny Rockets or an In N Out Burger!

I walked in and immediately noticed the ""wall of achievers"" to my direct right. Turns out there's an eating challenge here. Turns out that challenge is a one pound burger. Easy. So easy.

My friends all got a shake to start with, and in retrospect, I could have also. However, I decided to forgo the shake and just do the pounder. I ate the 1 pound burger (to which I added bacon) in under 5 minutes. Hardly a challenge. I also ate the fries, onion rings, and finished 3 diet cokes. I hadn't eaten all day. I ate like a champion. They took my picture, made me sign a waiver, and I contemplated another hamburger. I wanted to tack my picture onto the kid's Wall of Fame, but they wouldn't let me since I'm over 18.

I think at this point in the story it is important to note that I shaved all of my facial hair except for my pedo-stache. My picture at Cheeburger Cheeburger has me making a ridiculous face with a pedo stache and a stuffed hamburger. I've never been more proud in my life.

Back to the food; you can customize your burger with tons o' shit. It's like a slightly (better?) Fuddruckers. I felt like there were more topping options. The shakes looked scrumptious. The shake of the day was a frozen oreo hot chocolate; I tasted it and almost slipped into a coma.

I'm really glad I came here, and I'm going to go back so I can tackle the pounder again. I'm going to see if they'll make a new challenge with two pounders. THAT would be tough. They should name it the Burger Boner Bonanza.",-k5yFUChotBMGQgHdFZvLQ,5,4,4,TEfGDVWSb_FCjjsY9jaG8A

Get your burger for 6 for the quarter pounder, up to 10 for the full pounder.  Comes with cheese and all the fixings you want save for the premiums like bacon.  I got bleu cheese and chopped garlic.  They have 20 some odd toppings.  Go nuts.

If you are a shake enthusiast, then get your oreo cookie, mint and mango juice or whatever floats your boat.  They have over 300,000 combinations.  If you are a math geek, you can check the calcuation while you are waiting for your burger.  30 minutes or so on a good day.  They make everything to order and from scratch.

I didn't ask, but the ground beef was about of 15% fat quality, much better than the 30% more places, even supposedly high end places use.  Fries were from whole potatoes, so skin and tiny leftover crunchies galore.

The closest competitor might be Fuddruckers, though I haven't been to one of those in ages.

Needless to say this was my first time here. Overall it was okay, I ended up getting regular order of half fries and half onion rings (""bob""), everyone had mix reviews about them so I decided to try both, along with the horseradish sauce which was recommended by the server. They were both just okay, I wasn't a big fan of either. They were also very oily which wasn't settling with me very well. The sauce was kind of bland, lacking in flavoring so I wasn't a fan of it either. Ended up using ketchup and a lot of seasoning instead. 

I also got a shake, which I loved the idea of mixing whichever flavor I wanted into the shake. I ended up getting a mango and pineapple shake, which was good. It wasn't overly sweat so I was happy with my selection. My friend got a oreo, cookie dough, and white chocolate shake which was a lot sweeter, but good. 

Prices were okay, about $6 for a regular size shake, $4 for a small, $20 2 lbs burger, $12 1 lbs burger, $10 dinner special (1/3 lbs burger with drink and fries), $6 regular order ""bob"". 

I may or may not try a burger next time. There was a weird smell that really made me feel nauseous when all the burgers came out. The most potent one was from the 2lb burger, I wasn't around the 1lb burgers that a lot of my friends ended up getting but some people said those smelled. Someone thought it was the cheese but I don't believe it was. It smelled more like rotten meat to me. 

I might be just overly sensitive to smell though, so it could be just me. I do like there shakes so I will come back for another shake, the food, I may or may not try.

I've passed this place probably 100 times and always make fun of the name and talk about how much I want to eat there. After the 101st fit of laughter a few friends and I decided to see what all the hype was about.

Holy shit do they have a lot of options. Luckily our waitress could tell how clueless we were and walked us through the overly complicated menu with its millions of combinations and options. Fellow Yelper Seth Y. completed the pound burger challenge in under 5 minutes and I felt like a wuss with my half pounder. I guess I have to return for a crack at glory(and my beautiful face on the wall of fame!).

As I mentioned, this place is definitely about the atmosphere. They make a big ordeal about people finishing the challenge including ringing a bell and taking a picture with a giant, stuffed burger. The atmosphere is definitely one of a fantastic burger joint and the shake/burger options are plentiful enough that not even the fattest fatty could try every combination even if they tried.

The menu was simple, although a little on the spendy side. I was OK with the price being a little high if the food was worth it.
My wife and I each ordered a ""classic"" 1/4 pound burger (the cheapest burger on the menu) and a basket of sweet potato fries. I had an iced tea and my wife had an Oreo cookie shake. Our total bill was $28.00. 
They should rename the classic burger, ""Meatball sandwich."" They used the same size bun for the smallest burger and the large 1lb burger. My burger patty was the size of a meatball. Spherical, not flat, so there was a lot of bites of just bread and toppings. Both my wife and I were truly disappointed. The fries were good and my wife really enjoyed her milkshake. 
My other complaint was the complete lack of atmosphere. There was a group of 6 adults behind me that were loud, rude, and obnoxious. They were so loud, I could not hear what my wife was saying. Not only were they loud, they were swearing every other word. This happens, I understand, but any waitress, owner, or manager worth their weight in cheese would have asked the group to CHILL OUT!

You'd never expect to walk into a pink neon-lit 50's diner from the outside.  This restaurant is part of a new little center wtih a ""lodge"" theme - river rocks, the whole deal.  But once inside the door, you're back at the malt shop of your parent's teens.

The hostess sat us quickly on a Saturday afternoon and briefly explained the menu to us.  Burgers, fries, rings, salads and shakes - the menu isn't complex, but it's loaded with choices.  40-something flavors to mix and create your favorite combination of shake.  (I can't recommend the Chocolate Peanut Butter Banana highly enough!)  The burgers are straightforward, just choose the size (quarter through full pound!) and choose your cheese and toppings.

The french fries and onion rings are absolutley amazing.  Fresh made right there, never frozen.  We ordered a full size ""half and half"" (fries and rings) and it was too much for the three of us.  The optional dipping suaces were really tasty too - we got cheese, habenaro jelly and creamy jalepeno.  (The spicy sounding ones were not as hot as you'd expect - just super yummy.)

They do to-go orders, and you can place your order over the internet.  Personally, I think this place is best suited for pulling up a chair and enjoying a fresh-made, juicy burger and a tall, creamy malt.  (I do mean juicy on the burgers - the rolls of paper towels on the table got used a lot by my brother and husband.)  Cheeburger Cheeburger will be our new favorite burger joint - a wonderful (and much cheaper) replacement for Burger Bar.  No, it's not as FAB-U-LOUS as Burger Bar (at Mandalay Place) but at half the cost, I'll happliy lose the opportunity for foie gras on my burger.

One note on the wait for your meal: the menu asks for patience as they make everything to order - so expect to wait about 15 minutes.  Honestly, between our milkshakes and the trivia cards on the table, the time went quickly.  And don't be afriad to be adventurous with your milkshake.  My brother's Reese's Pieces shake was a bit bland, so they happily added peanut butter and re-blended it when he asked.  Great service!!

We're looking forward to going back and trying new burger and shake combos!  (and OMG, more of those onion rings!)",WbKKJNRPIHB6l7csIV-2qQ,1,1,4,KEOeiQR0D8LKowdc4vf_yg

Creamy, rich and and just all over goodness makes this one of my favorite experiences of my last visit to Vegas.  Chocolate and peanut butter was the bomb!!! 

Only thing I would have preferred is that they wrapped up the bill quicker and got our to go items faster to us.   The wait was a bit long.

The menu is impressive, with milkshakes and burgers dominating most of it.  They only use angus beef for their burgers, so for some culinary reason, they only come cooked medium or higher.  I got mine medium well, and it was a little dry.  The burger was nothing special.  The unique thing about this restaurant is all the choices you have with the menu items.  There are muliltple, multiple milkshake flavors that you can combine to create something unique.  As for the burgers, there are different cheeses and toppings such as feta, cheddar, american, banana peppers, avocado, honey mustard, A1, etc.

I also ordered an onion ring and french fry appetizer.  The fries were made from whole potatoes, skin left on.  They were a little mushy on the outside as well as the inside.  The onion rings however were superb I thought.  The coating was very light and crispy, almost like tempura, it was not heavy and breaded.

The service was a little lacking for our group's visit.  Granted, it was a very large group, but you figure they would have some system for the waitresses to handle it.  Drink refills were inconsistent and took forever to get our bills.  I think if you were a smaller party, then the service wouldn't be a problem.",gqpnDoFx42U5NdtejYfKOg,2,2,3,toYVz0ggCQppQx6uqrnPag

1 star = for the retro atmosphere inside; kind of like dining in the 70's.

2 stars = for getting to make your burger any way you want.  They offer a wide range of toppings from mushrooms, to A1 steak sauce, and even garlic.  Making it your way is definitely a great idea to ensure you like your burger.  If it doesn't taste good, it is your fault!

3 stars = for the different sizes of burgers you can choose from.  You can choose from a beginner's size burger, to a whole 1 pounder.  if you can finish a 1 pounder you get your picture taken and go into their albums of people who were able to complete the challenge.

4 stars = for the option to get a basket of both onion rings AND french fries. Both are yummy and beware, the baskets are huge and the half basket is good enough for 2 to share!

Vaguely remember trying this place years and years ago. Popped in again for a burger fix and it delivered. 

You can certainly taste the quality beefiness of the burger. Very good. The big list of included toppings is fun. I chose chipotle mayo, guacamole, bacon, cheddar and lettuce. Mine was tasty!  You also get to choose from 3 buns. Hubby and I shared a small order of fries (for 1) which was plenty for 2.   Note: if it isn't your thing....they do cover the fries in lots of pepper. I do enjoy the build it yourself concept so you don't end up asking for eliminations and substitutions. You get just what you want. 

My little guy got his meal and it came with a cute cardboard fold up car. He was stoked about it. 

Obviously, the decor if funky and fun. Perfect for families and kids. 

Our server was very nice and friendly and even offered to go cups for our drinks.

4052656,2010-07-27,2,PSUOncuqfqHulYj_fusthw,"I decided to go to Cheeburger Cheeburger today because I wanted to try someplace I had never been that had fairly good reviews on Yelp. I was also in the mood for something a little less healthy then what I normally try to eat. 

Cheeburger Cheeburger was a little difficult for me to spot, but perhaps  the construction on Rainbow played a factor?  Hopefully that is finished soon. 

A friendly employee greeted me when I entered, asked if I was placing an order to go (I was) and then proceeded to answer the questions I had about the menu. This place is a control freaks dream come true. You get to decide almost everything that goes into your burger... The type of meat (they serve turkey burgers), the size, how well cooked it is, the toppings (most of which were free of charge, which was nice). The only thing I didn't see an option for was the type of bun. They also have salads and wraps that you order in a similar fashion, picking out all the toppings you want.

I ended up with the smallest burger, the Classic, and added cheddar cheese plus all the standard toppings I like: Lettuce, tomato, pickles, ketchup and mustard. That seemed a little boring to me, so I had them throw on some sauteed mushrooms (which was an additional charge).

The food took about 15 minutes to prepare. Nothing unreasonable, but next time I will either call my order in or place it online so I can avoid the wait. Once I got back to work and ate it, I was happy but not blown away. Not by the burger at least... 

My birthday cake flavored milkshake was SO yummy! Like heaven in a cup yummy. A little on the runnier side, but I didn't mind, it was so good that I was eating it quickly and a thicker shake would have just impeded my progress! 

I am not sure how soon I will head back to Cheeburger Cheeburger. Next time I go, I will probably get a salad. And of course, another milkshake. Actually, I may go back just for a shake sometime.",Ae4uXwFHp-5fGrt6OONaXw,3,2,4,-29RibEkG1q1dDu2ugzPZQ

The restaurant is really cute, it's SUPER bright pink tacky '50s diner (I mean tacky in the most lovable way). There was a balloon girl going from table to table since it was Saturday night, but there were not really many other tables in the restaurant.

I meant to order the smallest burger they had but I think I accidentally ordered the next size up, 'cause my burger was pretty darn big. Shared the onion rings and fries combo order, the largest size, with my guy. The fries and rings were not really my favorite simply because I like more crispiness, which I didn't get. But I can see how other people might like them.

I'm gonna be honest in that I have the flu and couldn't taste anything. Like... nothing. So this is more of a review of service and price.

My guy commented that they nickel and dime you for everything, which is true. The menu looks really cheap when you glance over it, but the burgers do not come with fries. It was 6.99 for the large onion ring/fries basket, and .99 for a 1oz ramekin of horseradish sauce (at least give a large ramekin for that price.) It was 1.59 extra for him to get onions and mushrooms on his burger. Drinks were almost 3.00 for small mason jars, and it was 3.99 for a small milkshake (that I hear was stellar, he got pumpkin pie and raved about it nonstop. Unfortunately, like I said, everything tasted like nothing to me.) It was 42.00 for 2 of us. After the tip, my guy said ""I really feel pretty gypped that I just spent 50.00 on burgers. We could have had a really nice dinner for that elsewhere.""

I felt like I was under dressed just pulling in to the parking lot. But inside tells another story. Bright pink neon lighting. Tourquoise blue and chrome seats. Glass block walls. It is a total 50s throwback complete with the music of the era. I admit, I'm a sucker for oldies music. If I hear it in a place, I'm going to like it more often than not. The food is a big part too and there is no shortage of food here. I tend to be a big eater so when I tell you that you wont leave hungry, believe me. I ordered an angus platter after several minutes of deliberation and deep thought. I was a bit overwheled at all the possible options. Fortunately the staff was there to help and walked me through the process. I settled on the platter, as I said. I ordered my burger with lettuce, tomato, pine apple, swiss cheese and teriyaki sauce. It came with grilled onion already which is fine by me. I chose fries though "" The Best of Both Worlds"" (onion rings and fries) was recommended. I didn't feel I needed both. I got the horseradish sauce for dipping. I also ordered a salad. It was big with wild greens, cheese, olives and croutons. There was just barely enough dressing to satisfy. I could have asked for more but that would have been too much for my liking. My burger came out as 10 oz of delicious angus cooked a perfect medium and topped with my requested toppings. I am not going to say it was the best burger I've had but it was pretty darned good. My main complaint is that the bun was very bready and a tad on the dry side. Still, a good burger that was quite filling. The fries were good as well. Crispy and salty the way good fresh fries should be. I stopped there and passed on dessert last night. I'm regretting that today. To complete the experience I should have ordered a cherry cola and a chocolate malt. That would have been the perfect 50s diner experience.

Really, really cute. It's laid-back, but preppy with the pink walls, and the servers are adorable. I like the place.

I appreciate the customize-your-burger menu style too, there's lots of options! The food is decent, just a bit above average in taste and quality, with large portions. It's on the expensive side, almost not worth the food order, but good enough. 

This review is probably closer to a 3.5 for such a cute establishment, but I have to round down for the fact that too many burger places are overrated, and a burger place has to have some fantastic burgers to stand out to me at all. 

This is a place for burger-and-fries aficionados, and for meeting up with friends. I don't think I'd be back for the food myself, but I'll tag along with friends if they wanted to meet up here, and it'll always be fun to watch someone try to down a two pound burger.

As a result, I only ordered a Black and White Malt. It reminded me of the chocolate malts I used to always get at Sonic. It was delicious. Their fries were also rustic and fried perfectly.

Now for some random thoughts. I must say that their menu isn't very Feng Shui. I'm not sure why I thought about this while I was there. It just seems overwhelming to newbies (we had a few in our group). Of course, in reality, the variety in the menu is a good thing. I mean, the shake/malt selection alone offers 78 different flavors, and you can mix whatever you want.

That's right, I said it. Go ahead and try to prove me wrong. They have more flavors of milk shakes than most place have items on their menus. On top of the staggering amount of choices you have to the option to mix more than one flavor into a shake. Cheesecake Smores? Done! Coconut, mango, and pineapple? Done! This just opens the door from amazing to mindblowing. Don't even get me started on the quality of the shakes. That cheesecakse smores I just mention above, real graham cracker crumbs in it. Yes I had it, and it was delicious. A large milkshake runs around six dollars and is served in the milkshake tin, but dont let the price scare you away. It's definitely more than enough delicious milkshake to warrant forking over six dollars for. Now as for the rest of the menu......

The hamburgers offer you another array of choices in the form of toppings and size, but even with all the toppings I just could not get over the lack of flavor that the hamburger patty itself had. It's definitely not on the bad end of the scale but for the price of the hamburgers you'd expect better. Their fry and onion ring platters do serve up a large amount of food for a good price but their dipping sauces are amazingly overpriced. One dollar for a dipping sauce? Come on now. The fries are a bit soggy and mediocre but their onion rings are a lightly battered, sweet ring of deliciousness.

I hate to give Cheeburger Cheeburger three stars but the only thing I can recommend coming here for is the milkshakes and onion rings. If you're looking for a great hamburger, look somewhere else.",eSo5hmAF_UW1N5XFsx0q7Q,1,0,3,Ug9Smup3xMXl_MsWyQQBxg

The really awesome thing is that they have different sized burgers, so you can get a small (5 oz) or extremely large (20 oz) burger and put almost anything you want on it.  They have toppings I would never think try, like artichoke hearts, banana peppers, etc.  They have several different types of cheese including feta, mozzarella, provolone, etc.  Unfortunately I wasn't feeling too adventurous so I got the Semi-Serious (1/3 lb burger) with bleu cheese, 2 onion rings, bbq sauce and lettuce.  The burger was good, a little bit chunky for me on the meat for me, I probably should have gone with the smallest burger.  My boyfriend ordered a medium burger and it was delivered well done, but still good.  The fries were pretty good, I wouldn't RAVE about them, but they were good. I've never had fries with the skin still on them, and they were pretty tasty with the seasonings.

I discovered this restaurant when I won a free lunch there through a radio station promotion. Since then, I haven't stopped going back.
Essentially, the restaurant is a 50s-style diner (with appropriate decor and music playing), serving a good variety of classic American food (burgers, chicken fingers, fries, etc.) All the food they make is excellent.

What makes Cheeburger stand out is customization. The restaurant lets you create your own burger/chicken sandwich from tons of options, and even lets you mix and match malt/shake flavors! The staff take care of the customers and always have smiles on their faces. Not to mention if the malts and shakes aren't enough, there is a plethora
 of other dessert dishes to choose from.

My one complaint is that there is only one location in town - halfway across the city from my house. Still,I can't fault the restaurant based on where I live.

Cheeburger is excellent, and it's a shame the restaurant isn't more popular than it is. Don't pass this place by. It's the ultimate 50s diner experience.

4974436,2009-08-19,3,PSUOncuqfqHulYj_fusthw,"With a name like Cheeburger times 2, you don't have to guess what their specialty is.  What most diners in the area don't know is that Cheeburger Cheeburger is actually a chain with over 50 locations!  

Walking in, newbies will be surprised by the 50s-inspired diner atmosphere.  Their menu definitely takes some time to navigate, but you'll get the hang of it.

Burgers - their main focus and what everyone really comes for.  You can have your meat cooked to your liking (medium, medium well, well) and in various sizes (5.5 oz, 7 oz, 10 oz, 14 oz).  Apparently, they have their own farm where the beef comes from.  What makes them over the top is the number of toppings available.  Things like sun-dried tomatoes, avocado, and artichoke hearts are only a sample of their 25 plus topping selection.  The Husband went for The Semi-Serious (7 oz) for $6.99.  With nine types of cheeses to choose from, he went for the Pepper Jack Cheese and a fair amount of toppings.  Melissa G. went for The Classic (5.5 oz) Wrap for $6.79.  She also added a few toppings too.

If it's not meat you crave, portabello mushroom and veggie burgers and wraps are also available.  Salads are also hearty on the toppings with over 25 choices to choose from.  I went for the Portabello Wrap for $7.99.  They offer white or whole wheat wraps and you get a signature sauce to dip your wrap in.  My wrap was okay, perhaps there's so much stuff going on that it's hard to enjoy the actual taste of the wrap itself.

We couldn't resist their ""Famous Fries & Rings"" and wanted to go for the ""Best of Both"" Basket, Regular order ($5.89), but the waitress dissuaded us by saying it was huge and we should really get a Half ($4.69).  Apparently, she underestimated our craving for fried foods, and we ended up ordering up another basket of fries (Small $2.59 / Medium $3.59 / Large $4.59).  We weren't too fond of the onion rings, but we did like the fries.  They also offer five signature sauces, so we did the Adventurous Flight of Three ($2.49).  Since two of us ordered wraps, we ended up trying all five - Creamy Cheese, Zesty Horseradish, Creamy Jalapeno, Sweet Pepper, and Garden Vegetable.  We overdid it with the sauces and maybe should have just chosen one for our fries.  They weren't anything special unfortunately.  

But the real winner is their milkshake selection.  With over 378,00 possible combinations, you can build any kind of milkshake you want.  The waitress did point out that once you get past the three topping combination, there's an excess of syrup as most of the toppings are syrup-based. (So, be sure to ask the staff what toppings are concrete versus syrup.)  I went for the Oreo Green Mint, Cookie Dough, and Heath Bar combination and it was REALLY good.  The Husband went for the Pina Colada and Berry Berry combo and his was pretty good too!  Melissa G. has Chocolate Banana Peanut Butter with Reese's Pieces.  They serve them up in two sizes - Half $3.59 or Regular $4.99.  

Service was okay, the waitresses were super friendly in the beginning but slacked off a bit as more business arrived and our section was left empty.  (We were seated in the back section, although they ended up closing it off and seating everyone else in the front.)

When it comes down to it, we paid over $50 for dinner and that was not including tip.  Pretty expensive meal for a party of three at a diner.  For those who know what toppings to pick, you can get a better bang for your buck.  But if you prefer the no frills on your burgers, this place is not for you.  We'd go back for the shakes and fries, but not for the rings, burgers or wraps.",rt3PC7WCgCKsoufmQJELfw,7,4,3,HDtfIXSK5S9NjSvK_nfVvw

I had a veggie burger, and honestly, it wasn't the best veggie burger I have had. It was big, but a little dry and more of a grain patty than a fake meat variety. I have decided I prefer fake meat. I really should have gone for the turkey burger... or the 1lb burger challenge. Sometimes you just gotta have the real deal. 

However, I am still a fan for a couple of reasons. First, from build your own salads for the vegetarian to the 1lb burger for the overachievers, there is definitely something for everyone. Second, there are a million ways to customize everything. Generally, this makes me a bit crazy, but I appreciated the choices. Numerous toppings for your burger and your salad, a gazillion milkshake flavors. Heck, you can even create a custom-flavored soda!

I had the platter which comes with a salad or coleslaw and rings or fries. It was $12, which may be bordering on pricey, but for some reason I did not mind. The salad came in a bowl (a decent size), and it was not iceberg! Brilliant!

And, I liked both their fries and their onion rings. Their fries were homemade, sliced not too thin or too thick, and served with a little bit of skin still on. The onion rings were lightly battered, skinny and delicious. Some people might prefer a big, fat onion ring, but I found this skinny variety rather addictive. They were just so easy to squash, dip and then slam in your mouth! Dangerously simple consumption. 

The decor is retro diner, which leaves me neutral. I neither adore nor detest this theme. 

As for service, I found it pleasant, organized and fairly prompt given that there were close to 20 in the party!

The last few times I was here the burger quality has gone downhill significantly. The tomatoes were green and crunchy. The lettuce was white or almost white. The bread was either stale or soggy. The meat was under or over cooked. Not good. 

We used to come here for their amazing shakes. The last bunch of times I've been here their shakes have been lackluster. They have obviously changed their ice cream supplier. They were using high quality and now it's probably equal to off brand at Walmart. I probably won't be back!",GSTf4SKV1HjZBfWFapea0Q,1,0,2,CQQg-x5Je77h0jRrqDVOsA

For most, the draw of customizing your own burger is a deal sealer, but for me it made for a random burger that sunk in my stomach. The platter deals are a great price at $11.99. You get a 1/2 burger (ask for a bun if you want one.), a side of fries or onion rings, a signature dipping sauce, and a choice of a side salad or coleslaw. I got mine with grilled onions, tomatoes, lettuce, pickles, peppers, A1 steak sauce, and horseradish. It was ok in flavor, but the patty fell apart. The horseradish does not deliver the kick I had hoped for either. The buns are big and soft. I could only eat the bottom piece because it was too much. The fries were seasoned well, but soggy. The salad was impressive. It was a mound of mixed greens, cherry tomatoes, croutons, olives, cheese and slice carrots. Way better than most burger places. The balsamic dressing was delicious. I shared the sides with a friend and was beyond stuffed.

5387285,2011-11-08,0,PSUOncuqfqHulYj_fusthw,"Cheeburger is a super cute 50's themed diner that specializes in you guessed it, cheeseburgers.  They have fun trivia cards and Hall of Fame photo albums on every table.  (Jump to last paragraph for more on the HOF albums.)  I'm amused by their paper towels; each table comes with a giant roll like you think of in your home kitchen.  You really will need quite a few to keep up with the yummy goodness that oozes from your burger upon every bite.

I wish that I could rate food quality and service quality separately.  Their food is a definitive 5 star, while the service deserves a big egg.  So, I'm gonna split the difference and offer up a 3 star.  The service is PAINFULLY bad, and this has been consistently the case on every visit.  I'll leave it at that, but you've been warned.

If you feel that you are brave and in a very patient mood, give this place a shot.  They have every topping that you've ever considered and  never thought of to add to your cheeseburger.  I highly recommend the chopped garlic, which adds a magical quality to your Cheeburger.  And if you are in the mood for something indulgent order one of their shakes.  They bring them out to the table in the big metal mixing cup, which is really fun.  My personal favorite (due to personal palatial prefs) is the pistachio shake.  

Bring your appetite because portions are quite large.  They have a massive burger called a Pounder, which is actually 20 ounces.  If you finish this burger they take your picture and put it in their Hall of Fame photo books.  I've never attempted to wrestle this beast.

Chocolate Shake with tons of candy in it for the husband
Semi Serious - with cheddar, lettuce, tomato, pickle, onion, and guacamole (for me)
Serious - with Pepper Jack, Garlic, Bacon (for husband)
Best of Both Basket - fries and onion rings for both of us

So while the burger was decent, I didn't think that the meat was flavorful enough to order it again.  My husband felt the same way.

The onion rings had nice batter but it was too salty for me.  I liked the fries, however.  The dipping sauces weren't really worth getting, but my husband liked the cheese.  I felt the horseradish sauce was the best out of the four they offer.  I would have been happy with ketchup or plain.

I went here for my cousin's ballet recital dinner and ordered the portabello burger.

""Portabello"" made me think of ""steak"" (that's right, I didn't know what portabello was!) so I ordered it. 
When I got my burger, I bit into it and discovered that it was not a steak sammich, but a mushroom. A big mushroom.

I like mushrooms and regularly eat them- so I ate the burger. Something about it was not right though and I stopped 2/3s way through.

Later that night I was having agonizing sharp stomach pains. I was sweating and drifting in and out of sleep.

I continued to feel ill and have additional symptoms throughout the night and into the day.

I started to feel better the next night and was well enough to get out of bed, and even eat at a restaurant in the hotel.


After that experience when returning to Vegas, and eventually moving here, I've time and time again disagreed to going to cheeburger cheeburger due to this incident.

The food... I've had better at so many other places. I ordered a build-your-own chicken sandwich with BBQ sauce, cheese and bacon. The chicken was tough and over cooked, the bun cold and hard, not enough sauce and the skimpy 2 pieces of bacon were over done. I had about 3 bites before my jaw gave out. 

The fries? Undercooked and cold. COLD. WTF? It's a busy Friday night and you bring me a basket of cold fries with my already sucky sandwich? Ugh.

- Creamy Cheese - It needed salt.
- Texas Horseradish - I usually do not eat horseradish, but I tasted it anyways and came to the conclusion that I still do not like horseradish.
- Creamy Jalapeno - Bland.

It sucks that you have to pay for the sauces. I found myself dipping my fries and rings in ranch, which was free anyways.

I've been here on a number of occasions. My most recent trip was with my recently purchased Groupon. The diner atmosphere is fun, the wait staff is super friendly and welcoming. They make you feel right at home. They play all the great oldies, it really puts you in the mood.

The burgers are great, you get to specify what size (up to a 1-pounder) you'd like and then there's a topping free-for-all. There is an extensive list of toppings that you can have added to your burger, which is my faovrite thing about this place. I usually order mine with swiss cheese, teriyaki, artichoke hearts, roasted red peppers, extra jalapeno, tomato and lettuce. Sides don't come with the burger, so me and my fella ordered a medium onion rings to share. They're enormous, so err on the side of caution when ordering. They also have a variety of dipping, if you'd like. Their menu is large and they have plenty of non-beef burger options as well as sandwiches, wraps and platters. You'll definitely find something for almost everyone here.

If you order the pounder and are able to eat the whole thing you get your picture taken with a giant stuffed burger and you are forever remembered in their photo album hall of fame, which is fun. I usually just order the ""serious"" which is a third pounder. Might be a great idea to share a larger burger if you can agree on the toppings. 

They have an extensive list of milkshakes to choose from. Every flavor you can think of and you can combine as you like. Definitely worth a spin if you haven't tried it before. 

Great nice little diner. Plenty of coupons are available, so keep a look out for them (I never set foot in this place without a coupon) and take a trip. You'll be glad you did.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,6,4,4,t_FO3fjmeFXuo77q25rF3Q
