Dude, I had a veggie sandwich from PoS and it was totally and utterly tasteless (wheat bread with lettuce, tomato, pepperoncini, olives and pickles).  Although I will say this -  Subway serves this exact same sandwich, and it is just as tasteless.  Which begs the question, why would PoS copy this crap?

Order was quick and the servers  even started a nice conversation with me along the way, kinda made the experience of ordering a sub 10x better. Honestly some of the best portions I've gotten at a PoS to this day, usually they skimp out on the amount of tuna given. While it wasn't overloaded, it was just right. I love their soda machine, really different from the standard soda machine at places like Subway, has many varieties and flavors to add.

Subway 
Quiznos 
Port of Subs 
these are the three ""chains"" 

My first job was at a Togo's in California. Now that was a sandwich! Since moving to Las Vegas I have tried so hard to find another place that makes them like Togo's. There are some contenders, but nothing identical. 

Port of Subs in my opinion has a much better product than Subway or Quiznos, and while it is no Togo's, it satisfies my Togo's craving until I can get back to California. 

I stick with the basics, Turkey and Provolone on Wheat. Make sure you ask for extra veggies! Seems across the board sandwich shops in general have been skimping on the veggies.

1568374,2011-12-15,2,EIeU3coTP9V2qcmHhr60Yw,"This is the hour, lunch to be specific, 10-7 if you wear a badge. My name is Skacey, I carry a short amount of time to get fed and get back to work.

11:43 AM, I step into the Port of Subs on West Badura. There are two dames behind the counter, to protect their identities, I'll call them Laverne and Shirley. There is one other patron in the establishment, quietly sitting and eating at a table by the window. As I step up to the counter, Laverne begins to head to the back and calls out to Shirley:

""Hey, after this next order, can you clean the slicer"" is what I heard her say, but aparently, Shirley translated that comment to be ""I'm heading in back to slack off, you stay up here and work until your fingers bleed""

At this point, I placed my order for a number one (always a safe bet at any fast food joint) As Shirley begins my order, I notice that she is heaping on piles of attitude. Now I'm not allergic to attitude, but I don't think its healthy to eat too much (I hear it gives you wrinkles) - In the interest of getting my order quickly, I let this go.

Once she is finished with the lunch meat and attitude, she moves to the veggies. In a monotone voice she rattles off the choices and I make my selection. As she begins piling on the foliage, she drizzles dispair and loathing on my sandwich. Now these are just plain unhealthy, but again, I'm pressed for time.

She finishes my meal and begins wrapping it up, she drops it next to the cash station and calls out to the back a word dripping with disapproval, snarkyness and vitriol. This single word impales itself on the back wall and runs down into a greasy puddle of hate. She said ""Register!"" clearly indicating that her toil was done and that someone else would have to deal with me as a pathetic customer.

Laverne does not show up again to help me, she is likely a quivering mess in the back, dealing with her own issues. The third lady (Joanie?) takes my money and sends me on my way. As I leave, the other patron and I share a glance which reveals our understanding of what just happened.

If you LOVE smashed bread, mediocre cold cuts, and average veggies, then perhaps it is worth seeing the drama that unfolds as young workers learn skills that will help them eventually raise the unemployment rate. Otherwise, you're better off driving 5 more minutes to another cheap belly filler.",GTcKUjRulTRN_XxehMgSZQ,1,0,2,SuM_Cu--KFi6VAIuoImTEA

2084447,2015-02-01,9,EIeU3coTP9V2qcmHhr60Yw,"""Hi. Hello. How are you? Be right with you."" Any of these words could be used to greet someone when they come into your store. How unfortunate that I was not greeted at all yesterday 1/31/15 when I walked into this store. So I walk in, there is a girl making a sandwich, we will call her SM for sandwich maker, and she looks right at me but doesn't day anything. There is another girl who is at the register helping some guy, she looks at me too and says nothing. Eventually she is done helping the guy and looks right at me, and walks away. I stood there for a good 5 minutes without anyone saying ANYTHING to me. I was about to walk out, but luckily SM FINALLY said ""I'll be with you shortly."" Still looking directly at the sandwich board, never making eye contact. 

At this point, another lady has walked in to order behind me. Finally SM is ready, she asks us both what we want. Why?? We are not together and she knows this. So I tell her what I want and the lady also tells her what she wants, which happens to be 2 sandwiches whereas I am just getting one. SM proceeds to cut all of our breads and slices all of our meats and cheeses at the same time. Then she asks us what toppings we both wanted. What the hell! I was there first, waiting like a dumbass way before that other lady, so my sandwich should have been made first. I also should have been talked to directly instead of with this stranger. It was akward as we both were shouting out toppings and sauces. That pissed me off. Meanwhile the other girl is no where to be seen, but I can hear her chatting in the back. These business owners really need to think about the people they are leaving in charge to run their store when they are not there. The sandwich was fine, but the shitty employees running this place will make me not come back.

2100799,2013-10-07,1,EIeU3coTP9V2qcmHhr60Yw,"This is a decent lunch spot.  It is next to the Starbucks where I like to work/study, and so it is a quick choice...

The subs are good, fresh veggies (lettuce, tomato, pickle, olives, peppers...).  There are many options for wraps, even lettuce wraps, salads, and subs or grillers.  There are many options of meat and cheese.  They slice it right in front of you as you order.

Some downsides to this spot - it is a little slow.  I imagine this is because it takes time to slice the meat/cheese.  The person putting the veggies on is never very fast.... the sourdough bread is extremely dry (I suggest another option).  The pasta and macaroni salad is just ""ok"" in my opinion.  I also think that since they are cutting various meat and cheese right there - they SHOULD have a separate meat and cheese slicer.  I find it wrong that it is done all on one...  The prices are average.. I would go more often if it was cheaper, that's for sure.

Still, I have been here MULTIPLE times, and will continue to go here and there.  It hits the spot and fills the hole :)  The turkey/chicken/cheese combo is my fave, both as a sub or a wrap!",U6Bi44pwgiIt-IEK2GhiGQ,2,0,3,kjFEl7izRCDIwrKcClQMdg

Well, that is to say that they don't offer delivery *directly*; they work through a couple of delivery services, apparently, so you can still get your sandwich at home.
The problem with third-party services, depending on which ones they are, is that restaurants often have slightly different pricing for delivery orders, it takes longer for processing, pickup and delivery, and there's an extra fee tracked on by the outfit that does it. It's also less convenient.
I understand that if a location is understaffed, or just can't make having delivery feasible, then it's not really something within their control to provide. The food is still pretty good here, but it seems silly to me to order a sandwich through a delivery service when I could instead order a steak or a plate of pasta from sit-down restaurants that wouldn't feature delivery normally, which is usually why I use delivery services in the first place.",umpKz5SA6UPEs0_bsuFKfA,0,0,4,8t02bWtixQ2VgS3zCj2CRQ

Subway's tuna is like crack, I have no idea what they put in it other than some cheap tuna and mayo, and I love it on occasion.

I wanted to try this as something different, as they claimed they used better quality ingredients.  It was the worst tuna sandwich I have ever had.  Just completely flavorless.

I am giving this place one extra star because of the steak sandwich I got for my husband, he said it was far and away much better quality steak than Subway or Quiznos (as Katie S has attested).  So if that's the kind of sub you like, you might be happy.
