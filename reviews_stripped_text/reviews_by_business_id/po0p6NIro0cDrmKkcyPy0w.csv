I had a small bowl that was flavorful & filling (considering I can eat a lot). I also ordered miso soup on the side. Love the little miso soup machine bc u can get refills. I've only tried one other place that's similar to this (expect they roll it in burritos) but I prefer this poke bowl spot bc of the pricing, amount served, flavor & freshness, & ultimately fulfilling. I would definitely come back. Highly recommend  

Location is a new building so everything is brand new & clean (so far). There's air freshener at the entrance which I didn't mind but I could see how it can bother some ppl who are sensitive to the smell. Love the seating/benches. The only issue I have is not having options for kids i.e. Something cooked or an appetizer kids would like.

Really enjoyed the flavors. I will say, though, it's not like there is a poke bar on every corner - it would be nice if they asked if you've been there before or been to any before so that we could have gotten guidance on what to order. There are no sauces or spices on the table, and I found the bowl to be a little bland, so that would have been nice. I went back 2 days later and the person working was much more helpful. I received miso soup with the order and was told it comes with it. That would have been nice to know when we went the first time. I would recommend to try it, it's tasty.

361724,2016-08-21,0,po0p6NIro0cDrmKkcyPy0w,"July has been an interesting month on the Southwest side of Las Vegas. 3 poke places (Too See Roll, Soho Bowlritto and Sweet Poke) have opened within 3 miles of each other to challenge Jaburritos's monopoly. Additionally, a forth poke place is being constructed near Jenny Pho on Rainbow just south of Robindale. 

Luckily, each business differs enough to have it's own style, so they don't compete head to head. Rather, each has its own niche. Too See Roll setup is like Chipotle (without the e. coli). Enter from the front, a line wraps around the perimeter to the right where you order, slide to the left as your order is prepared then pickup and pay. 

You  choose from three different size bowls; choose the type of rice (white, brown, black) and/or salad; pick up to five proteins (of which there are 10 fresh seafood choices) depending on bowl size; choose your sauces (11 available); and lastly your toppings (13 available). 

As you move to the left, the cooks expertly create your bowl. Rice/salad base goes on the bottom; your proteins and sauces are incorporated in a mixing bowl then placed on top of your base; to be followed by your toppings. 

I found all the ingredients to be extremely fresh and of the highest Sashimi grade. Nothing tastes previously frozen at all nor was there any hint of ""fishy"" odor or taste. Obviously, the selection is great, and allows you to have fun by trying new combinations. 

Unlikely Jaburritos or Soho Bowlritto, they don't make burritos. However, they do have pre-made sushi daily. What I love about their rolls is that the seaweed wrap is separated from the moist filling and rice by a easily disposable plastic wrapper that prevents it from getting soggy and maintains its crispness. 

Also, the decor is very lively with a Asian hipster atmosphere. Natural wood is incorporated throughout the eating area and non-florescent lighting is used to eliminate any commercial/industrial feel. 

Another amenity is Free WiFi and USB charging ports at the tables. Unfortunately, IT ISN'T A POKE STOP. Come on Niantic, Poke Bars and Poke Stops go together. It should be mandatory.",KqbowpYkOxkpFNuEd-rTnw,4,0,5,z2JEUzRSvLgJf0Zh3ioHgA

He said they were ok, nothing to write home about. The miso soup was meh, probably won't order that again.

I always opt for the build your own.  It's really great that they offer options but never an overwhelming amount of options to customize.  The taste and freshness has been consistent, and never ceases to hit the spot.   My favorite think about TooSeeRoll is that flavors compliment versus overwhelm, which is a plus in the sauce options...so you never make the wrong combinations, or regret your combo choices...we have all been there right?!? And they offer yellow radish!!!!  It's a great pallet cleanser.

1. The counter staff needs to be better trained and more enthused for their work. Yes, it might be low paying and not all that glamorous, but at least appreciate the fact that you're working and someone (the customer) is paying to dine at your fine establishment. 

2. This place really needs a soda fountain. Overpriced cans of soda doesn't do it for me.

This place has truly become a go-to! The poke craze is all the rage right now, and this place definitely stands out to me because of the consistency with both freshness and flavor every time! Aside from the food being delicious -- the customer service is great, portions and pricing are extremely reasonable, and the venue itself is very clean with lots of seating.

I ORDER: 
- Build-your-own (large, $10.75) 
- Base: no rice, mixed greens (with ginger dressing)
- Side base: both crab & cucumber
- Protein: salmon, tuna, cajun albacore, cajun tuna, real crab meat
- Sauce: Too see sauce & yum yum sauce
- Toppings: green onion, seaweed salad, tamago, masago, furikake 

* They also offer a combo special, where if you get a bowl and a sushi roll it is discounted. I love their SHRIMP TEMPURA CRUNCH ROLL! Highly recommended! Check in on Yelp & receive additional 15% off! :)",cQrnxjgVBhjAcOJttw48aw,4,2,5,fOpqWpjpQosBeGZETTUCfw

A friend had came here the day before and recommended getting the large as you get quite the amount of food. So i had ordered a large with a white rice base, everything (crab meat, cucumber salad, and white onions), 2 scoops of yellow tail, 3 scoops of salmon with a To See Sauce. I had tested that the creamy sauce my friend recommended reminded me of a sesame peanut sauce youd eat thai skewers with xD) toppings wise, i essentially got everything except ginger and wasabi. To complete the meal, i also got a miso soup.

(piggy i know LOL)

If i remember correctly, the bowls they use for the large is 24oz bowls. The scoops for the fish they use are essentially ice cream scoopers and not melon ballers like other establishment uses. So it REALLY IS a lot of food for the money you pay. considering you are probably getting more fish for a few dollars less than surrounding places. 

Overall, pretty good deal for a really filling meal. If you are one to not prefer too much sauce, make note to notify the person prepping your bowl. 

Im not sure if it was a mistake or what but i think u can order the crab meat and avocado once, then if u want extra, then they will charge you.

Side note - they make their own individually wrapped nigiri too that is in a side fridge that you can make your own sushi box with. and prepped boxes. never tried it but some does look good.",Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,6,6,4,mOq59iMr_W5NvhucQxNJpg

This is a Subway of a Japanese food. The fresh seafood are setup like Subway setup. You pick whatever you want in your bowl and viola ! That's your poke bowl. The mashed spicy tuna, spicy salmon and others are in trays and they scoop it up with an ice cream scoop. For a sushi / sashimi lover like me and knows what a good sushi and sashimi is, it is hard for me to like this place. 

We didn't order the poke bowl as It did not look appetizing. I can never eat my Japanese food prepared that way and not by a sushi chef so we decided to get the rolls. We ordered the Hawaiian Roll, Something Wrong 215 Roll, spicy tuna roll and the soba noodle. Both rolls were disappointing. The fundamental test of sushi is the rice. The rice was breaking apart. The taste and texture isn't good or very poor for that matter. The size is horrendous you can't cram it up in your mouth to chew it. It's not one bite but few bites hence it falls apart. The fish isn't fresh. We didn't even finish it. We left it. We prefer the spicy tuna more than the big rolls. It's bite size and better than the big rolls. But even then taste and texture isn't good. The price we paid for all is $30++. Pricey for a fast food. 

The place is clean. It's a fast food Japanese food. Overall we only finish the Soba Noodle and the spicy tuna as we were hungry other than that it's not worth it to go back.",1jwTqZYsjnY5f9c46YUArg,0,0,1,uc3XRwYYHDlwZfE197Mx-w

To be honest, it's one simple reason why I prefer this place over others. What is it? The spicy korean sauce.

There is a Korean version of poke bowl. It's like a poke bowl but has a lot of lettuce mixed in with sashimi, topped with the hot sauce. Why am I telling you this? 

The spicy Korean sauce is what makes the Korean poke bowl come together. Which is the glue that is missing in poke bowls in a lot of other places. I've had poke without the Spicy Korean sauce... And preference it may be... But none of the other sauces compare. All the poke bowls I've tried are bland.

This place not only has the spicy sauce but a good variety of fish. It's a lot cleaner and more upscale than some of the other places I have visited. If it tells you how much I enjoy this place, I think I've already visited four times in the past month.

They recently added a new menu that allows you to make your bowl/burrito a combo that comes with a side, which I chose lobster popcorn roll.

You can pick between three different poke bowl sizes. Each bowl with a varying amount of proteins. I selected the large poke bowl that consisted of five proteins. (Definitely had a food baby aftwrwards)They had so much variety of fish here! Even cajun styled fish. 
What surprised me there is that they are very generous with the portions and told me that I could select as much toppings as I wanted, uh wow? Yay! 
They also have plenty of drinks and side items you can order too. When I mean variety, this place has it! Also, they have a stamp card for every order. 10 stamps and you get a free medium poke bowl.

1561017,2018-05-19,0,po0p6NIro0cDrmKkcyPy0w,"Let me start by saying I actually really love To See Roll's food. The past three days, I've been ordering sushi and bowls from them, but last night was the last straw. The girls in the front are NOT nice whatsoever. They have horrible customer service. The first day I was there, the cashier was nice, but the girl who took my order did not seem happy to help. I let it pass, figuring that maybe it's just one of those days. The second day, I dined-in and the girls in the front were, again, not nice at all. The portion size of my grandmother's bowl was significantly smaller than all the other times we've ordered, (and as I've mentioned, we order here A LOT), and they weren't enthusiastic to help at all. They gave my grandmother attitude for wanting to get her bowl to-go, even though we were dining in, but she usually can't finish her bowl. (Although this time, she did because again, they put VERY little serving.) 

The third day was the absolute worst though: those girls in the front can't be bothered to smile or act in a friendly manner at all. They were very rude to my mom. She had to order twice because she forgot to add the soup upon ordering the first time and I felt like this irritated them. We also ordered around 9:30 p.m. (30 mins BEFORE they close) and this also felt like another reason they were irritable. But we came plenty of time before closing and either way, that shouldn't matter. As a restaurant, you should be accommodating guests until the very last minute you close! We came half-an-hour before! Then we noticed that the girl (Shailene, Shailyn, maybe?) who packed up the soup put all the soup UPSIDE DOWN. Thankfully, it didn't spill. But a little common sense maybe? Why would anyone pack soup in a plastic bag upside down? Then they didn't even give or put any eel sauce for our japanese lasagna roll AND our deep fried philadelphia roll. Missing eel sauce on one would have been acceptable, but on TWO rolls? They were clearly rushing through our order and were very careless. 

This has just been so disappointing and I hope the manager or the owner addresses the customer service of the girls that work in the front. It has been HORRENDOUS. Not just one day, not just two days, but THREE days straight. There's obviously a problem there and my family and I will no longer count ourselves as loyal customers until it's resolved.",vKfHQF24DvpYblcTXXhdVg,2,0,1,fhQ4KrZOWoyd_Gt-gKHZjg

I didnt quite like this place- the name doesn't make any sense and their use of yogurt bowls bothers me. But I was pleased with my first order (To See Bowl with black rice), the service was friendly, and the price was about average. Plus, they have a miso soup dispenser. If that doesn't get you excited, I don't want to be your friend. 

As a couple of other people have mentioned, the set bowls aren't the best value because they come with three proteins- the DIY large is a dollar more and comes with five. I was less than thrilled to have a giant heap of salad at the bottom of my bowl, where it got soggy under the fish and sauce.  Apparently this is the way they do things,  as I had the same issue with my second bowl. This is also the first place I've seen that marinates the fish and sauce WITH the rice, which saturates it and makes it difficult to eat with chop sticks. Build your own and be specific to avoid these issues. 

Bowls aside, they also cater to the grab-and-go crowd with a refrigerator of rolls, bowls, and individually-wrapped nigiri (another thing I don't understand, lots of plastic waste) made fresh daily. I don't remember what roll I got, it was a little plain, but decently fresh and not covered in sauce.

This isn't my first pick for a poke bowl, but it's also not my last. Whatever you get, be sure to add on a miso soup so you can use the little dispenser, which looks like a fountain drink station. Can I get one of those for my house?!

EDIT: Adding a star. The more I come here, the more I like it. I'm still not a huge fan of the cups, just because they pack them so full that I can't move the ingredients around to mix up my bites.

Pro- sushi to go looks decent. I have not tried it though.

Cons- portion size for price, inconsistency, blandness, stingy on ginger, and ""hands on"" mixed approach

Let me explain. My friend got the same thing as me but her fish scooper gave generous heaping scoops of fish. My scooper gave precise to the line scoops which in the case of the tuna ended up being 5 tiny pieces. I think it should be consistent. 

So I got the To see roll special. They place the fish (several kinds),the toppings, the rice, and the sauce in a silver mixing bowl and proceeded to MIX IT all up together like a big MUSH. It looked like dog food at that point. I don't see the point of this? Why not place the rice in the bowl then possibly mix the fish with sauce then place the toppings on top? Now I didn't want to eat all the rice but I had no choice since all the toppings and fish was mixed in with my mixture. It reminded me of when I was a kid and we took mustard, egg, relish, ketchup, oatmeal and a bunch of stuff and mixed it all up and then dared each other to eat it. 

So she takes the mixture and places it by hand back on to the lettuce in the bowl. Maybe that's how some people like to eat poke all mixed up but not me. I was just so turned off by this woman mixing it smashing the ingredients together with her hands. It would be great if they explained this to customers or notes it somehow that this is how they do it since it's not how most poke places do it. 

It was our first time and we let that be known and no suggestions were given by the employees.

On to the taste- it was bland. I asked for some ginger and the employee I asked gave me 2 slices in a plastic cup. It only filled 1/3 of the cup. When I asked for a little more she filled it up with one more piece. I didn't think asking for a full tiny plastic cup of ginger was that big of a deal. 

I decided to save my comments to myself and asked my friend how she liked it. She began to pour soy sauce on top and told me it was bland and tasteless. I did the same. I would never do this anywhere else I've had poke.",Apj8bnqWlnaiSu4YDl0wDA,4,2,1,t37ZidQANIy1B_TLQMgBog

So I suggested this place to our office. Hopped on their website and found one menu, the poke bowl menu. No sushi roll menu. So we went on yelp and found a helper photo with the sushi menu, printed that out and decided on our orders.

Called once they opened and asked for delivery. Girl on the phone said we don't deliver, we said it clearly states on your website that you deliver. Her response was ""well sometimes my manager will deliver of it's a big order"". So we said, well yes it's a huge order, for 10 people. We want bowls AND sushi. She said ""well my manager isn't here so it isn't possible.."" Okay...forgiven. I was hungry at that point and really just wanted to order and be done with. 

So we started to state our orders and she said, you must be ordering from an old menu. We don't have those rolls, we don't even serve albacore anymore.. 3rd strike. By this time it was almost 11 and having to find another lunch option for more than 10 people who all wanted sushi was out of the question.

When i first visited and a few times after I really enjoyed this place.  Loved the portions they gave, loved how crab meat, avacado, and masago was not an extra charge for your first scoop and especially loved that they were the only poke bowl place that served radish sprouts.  Even better plus was that they had a stamp card.  
I loved this place so much I filled that stamp card in two weeks!  

After a couple months passed I realized they started being inconsistent with their portions.  I never had to ask for extra before because the amount they put in was enough.  They started putting less and so I had no choice to ask and pay for extra if I wanted more.  

The last visit I had about a few days ago I ordered my usual.  Once again with the lesser portions.  However this time when I asked for my usual extra tamago on the side they gave me a smaller amount than what I usually get.  When asking for more they said they were going to charge me.  I pointed out that there was no extra charge for additional tamago.  They said it had to be in the bowl.  Mind you I do not like tamago in my poke bowl.  I am from Hawaii and no poke bowl comes with tamago there.  In addition if they were to put it in the bowl it would still fit.  I reluctantly told them to put it in the bowl then since that was ""the rules"" and asked for just a little on the side still.  They were going to charge me for that but thankfully the gentleman at the register said it was okay.  Not sure if he was the manager or owner or something.  

All in all I won't be back as often considering a lot of other poke bowl establishments are opening up.  The pros used to drive me to travel from Henderson just for their bowls but now it's just not worth it.",dQPrX-xVKLk3565zZoOfHw,0,0,3,DnMiD6sj3HJ7lYpLEpzqGg

They have sushi made to order but i always go for the make-your-own poke bowl. If you dont trust your own tastebuds to make a bowl yourself, they have a menu of poke bowls to choose from (+ you get a free tasty miso soup with these type of bowls). I like how there are many options to choose from: for example, when choosing a base you can do black, brown or white rice or chips or salad. I've always done the  black rice with furikake on top. There are also tons of proteins to choose from and depending on what size bowl you get, you can get lots of protein. (3 scoops of protein for a medium, 5 for a large-i usually switch between these based on how hungry i am). Not only that but their protein is pretty fresh tasting. What i like most about this place is that you can add all of the mix ins or toppings and won't get charged extra for things like seaweed salad, masago, or avocado like they do at other poke palces. I knocked one star for price just because it gets pretty pricey. It's not a place i can eat at everyday. But the good thing is that they have stamp cards..buy 10 get one free.

They have pre-set bowls which comes with a side of unlimited miso soup , or you can create your own. Not really a fan of miso soup so I usually just make my own poke bowl. Plus , you get more toppings when you create your own (the pre-set bowl toppings are kinda limited). I like that they don't charge extra for brown rice or avocado. They also sell fresh sushi and imported snacks/drinks. Only thing I'd suggest is lowering the window thing , it's a bit hard ordering/communicating back and forth , or maybe I'm just too short.

If the customer service is bad then it's just bad overall. My boyfriend and I had gone there to get some food to go before we go over to our friends house. Tell me why it took 30 minutes just to order to go?!?!!! And it wasn't even busy. There were like two cars who pulled up next to me (I stayed in the car while he was supposedly to go in real quick to get the food) and they had left before us. I got irritated and called my boyfriend to see what was going on. He said he had ordered two bowls to go. Then he asked if he could use the Yelp check in. There is 15% off a combination order so you have to get a roll too. He then asked if he can use the 15% for two combination orders because then he wanted to get two rolls instead of one. They told him yes so he ordered two. Then they had to make sure the sushi chef was still there? When he was, it took him SO LONG to make two rolls. Did I mention how we waited for 30 minutes?! My boyfriend said the reason why it took so long was because the manager was chit chatting with the sushi chef. THEN when he's finally about to pay, the manager says he can't use the 15% off for the two combos because it's only one check in or whatever. So my poor boyfriend had to wait THAT long for something they said they would do- he wouldn't even have ordered the rolls if it was just for one roll because he felt bad they were only making one. My boyfriend said it was a horrible experience and doesn't wanna come here again. There are so many other poke places popping up that are also good as well!

1871286,2016-09-24,1,po0p6NIro0cDrmKkcyPy0w,"So I wanted to wait until i actually dined in before writing a review. 

First i wanted to start off with the pre-made food in their display cases. Both times that i have been there, the displays have not been full. I guess they are trying to keep things fresh? But they did look very empty. 

The food in the display case... Was ok. Just ok. For the price, I'm wondering if they are actually worth it. The price is around $3 for a roll that is about 3 bites....$1/a bite...lol... And the three different rolls that i tried... Spam, Mexican and the inari.... Were all a little on the sweet side. But on the plus because if the way it is packaged... The Nori is super duper fresh. Quality 3/5... Price 2/5.

Now onto the nitty gritty. The actual bowl. I got their special unagi bowl... Medium size. The first person that took my order was friendly but he did not offer me the different types of rice. Just assumed that i would want the white which is kind of disappointing as i would have preferred the brown or the black rice. I only realized they had other types of rice as the person behind me got asked which rice they wanted. :(. The second person that took over my bowl was a complete dud. He just started to place items on the bowl and when i tried to tell him that i didn't want one of the items, he just kept on going. The original guy had to tell him that i was talking to him. 

Seriously, how can you be right in front of the customer and be so totally out of it that when the customer is speaking, you just tune them out. How? Especially if I'm right there in front of you.  And after it was pointed out that i was talking to him, instead of offering to make me another one, he just kept on putting items on there... The first guy had to tell him, ""ask her if she wants to get it remade"". Then the dud actually looked up made eye contact and asked. I declined as i don't like wasting food, but even after all that he barely looked up, barely made eye contact and barely asked me if i wanted other toppings on my bowl. Service (2/5) very frustrating when the person that is finishing your bowl doesn't even acknowledge you. 

Quality...2/5. First bite was ok. second bite got sweeter and third bite and so on got even sweeter. They drowned the dish in the eel sauce. Unagi was not as tender as others i have had before... And by the time i got to the bottom of the bowl, it was almost soupy with the sauce. Definitely not good eats.

Price...2.5/5 for the amount of food that i got for the money that i paid.... I'm not quite sure that it was worth it. 

And they do not have a soda machine or even hot tea... They only have drinks in cans or bottles....:(

Honestly, the decor was very simplistic and tables were dirty at 11:30am on a Friday which is why i sat at the window. Ambiance (2/5) And the miso soup that you get from the dispenser was probably the best thing i had here. (5/5)...i actually really loved the soup. Delish!!

Overall, it is middle of the road...2.5/5... But since i can't really do halves... It got rounded up to a 3 star review.

Will i be back? Probably not. There are too many other poke bowl places around here for me to eat at.",L3DxG0n3lRq5N2lv1QNrrA,9,3,3,pcfCaWX11Deise0ZsGoIqA

The place is very cute, cute tables and booths, clean. They have multiple fridges against the wall on one side where they have pre-packaged individual wrapped sushi and sushi rolls, drinks and water machine. The staff were very friendly and helpful.

They have 4 signature bowls that you can choose from, each comes with a small bowl of miso soup. They have small, medium and large. I got the medium Korean style bowl which was very delicious. The fish tasted very fresh, the sauce was delicious, the seaweed salad on top was very good too.

However, I will go for the build your own bowl next time. If you get the large you get 5 scoops of protein and a base, a free scoop of crab meat (the signature bowls do not come with the crab meat), you can choose your own sauce and ALL the toppings you want. The signature bowls come with very few toppings so the build your own is a much better deal. Build your own bowl do not come with a miso soup though.

I decided wanted try one of the latest ones To See Roll for some Poke bowl action. I must admit out of all the new ones popping out around town. To See Roll definitely has some personality comes to the decor and gives you more options then just Poke Bowls. They have section that has bunch of different desserts mostly individual wrapped and most from Japan assume or based on the labels stuff see at asian markets. The rest of that cold ready to go section has individual freshly made sushi daily. Most of them are nigiri ones. They also have smoothie machines. Fountain drinks none they only sell by the bottles. 

The way it works choose from three different size bowls. I went with the Large bowl. Each bowl it based on scoops for your protein. They have list choose from I went with cajun albacore and salmon. The large you get five scoops. It was first time but thankfully they were super friendly, helpful in explaining things, and told me not all five scoops has be the same thing. You literally could get five different things. Just FYI not really good idea...The scoop they use for the portion is pretty tiny. I went 3 scoops tuna and 2 salmon. The base you can choose from white, brown, or black rice (I think need to try that next time). Also can choose organic mixed greens for base. The sauce I just went with the workers recommendation of sesame seed or the one that most popular. It was really good. Not overpowering with the sesame seed with pinch of heat. The toppings works like most other places decent selection and then some that you would have pay extra. I stuck with simple. I notice they had green seaweed salad. I love that stuff and can not remember any other poke bowl place offers that as topping. The portion for large is good size, reasonable price, and it was filling to me. 

The sushi not sure if it was the sushi chef. Someone was handed out pieces if anyone wanted to try. I like sure got the tamago. It nothing special. Ok. I did enjoy having that option if wanted little sushi with your poke bowl. Just odd seeing all individual wrapped. 

The decor was awesome. Or maybe all the poke bowl spots been not this feeling of restaurant restaurant. At To See Roll few places that you can sit down. One of the first things that stand  out is they have humidifier all scented walk in. Inside is nice each table area feel own area not just table in open space. 

The workers are all awesome. Friendly. Super helpful being my first time. Not doubt To See Roll will be one of my spots in my rotation of Poke Bowl rounds near the house!!!!",iSC96O2NjQc3JExGUHQG0Q,6,6,4,uYl0SfvDwcZVHv7PC6u_hg

The service is pretty good. The people kind of helped me through the process. It gets a little confusing because there's a lot going on and the steps go from right to left on the board. I didn't have a strong impression, though, and the people didn't necessarily enhance my experience. I was a first-timer, so I was a little confused. At times I felt kind of rushed in the line.

The narrow snack and medium ""yogurt"" bowls make it kinda hard to eat out of. I was tempted to dump it all out on a plate because it was sort of tricky getting a evenly distributed bite of food without losing some on the table.

I got the Unagi bowl and loved it. Crabmix and Salmon as the 2nd and 3rd proteins created a perfect sweet/salty balance, and being able to fill the rest of the bowl with roe, seaweed salad, edamame, ginger, and more makes it so much fun to eat. Excited to try To See Roll a few more times, in a few more protein combinations!

Los Angeles poke/sushi bowl spots really have it dialed. But To See Roll is on the brink of awesomeness, and is poised to become the gold standard in Las Vegas.

The downsides for me started with the separating lines that go on opposite sides of the restaurant (one for sushi/bottled drinks and one for bowls). What if I want both? I came for a bowl but it would have been nice to see the sushi roll options prior to paying. Next is the oddly sized glass case that covers the fish and toppings. It's just about forehead level for me at 5'5 so it was awkward ordering to someone I could barely see. After paying I got to walk past the wall with all the sushi and the drinks that are only seen as leaving. If I return I know where to look but newbies, keep your eyes open! Lastly the folks I ordered with were unenthusiastic and didn't offer much explanation. I told them it was my first time there and the most interaction I got was when I was offered to sample sauces after I froze with indecisiveness lol Luckily there was no line, perhaps, since it was almost closing.

Anywho, I ordered the large and it was 5 small scoops of fish plus crab meat and cucumber salad. It was a nice variety and everything was fresh. Food gets a solid 4 stars, I just need to find the right sauce combination to set it off.",V7cGEFexpXTY-jKWhqkHcw,0,0,3,rUWzWj6GJty_3j9-jGmPYw

2393112,2016-10-19,1,po0p6NIro0cDrmKkcyPy0w,"To see roll is arguably the best poke place in Vegas, to some people...

As far as value goes they're pretty cheap and the poke is decent. I really like how they just put up some additional menu items like kale, edamame, tofu, and corn. But for the cons, they are always inconsistent.

Almost every time I go, they give almost random quantities of sides and protein. Take for example one experience; I went in and asked for a very little bit of imitation crab and little bit of masago, but when they finished making my bowl the entire surface looked like a carpet of masago.. aaand the imitation crab amounted to a huge scoop of ice cream.

I'm not sure if it's a communication thing, but it feels like I can't really make any adjustments to my order because they don't really hear it, or they just don't care?

Another thing that sort of bothers me is the sauce, they sort of drench the poke protein in it, which can come off as too much and even worse is when they pour it in the bowl. It's not appetizing having an inch of liquid at the bottom of my poke. Also when you add avocado it's so tiny, like literally not even a full slice piece..

A pro though is the interior is really clean. The only issue with the inside is that the front entrance always smells of this weird sulfur or egg scent that's kind of unappetizing.

But all that isn't enough for me to give it only 3 stars, the single reason was because of an experience I had with bad service. It wasn't busy at the time but I'm pretty sure the workers had a bad day when I went in, because as soon as I went in they were just really rude.

After each protein I asked for they even tossed the scoops back angrily at the container. Maybe they were mad at working so early or had a disagreement with another coworker? Either way though it was off putting, awkward, and it sort of made me not want to eat there. 

I don't think I ever felt so awkward ordering food before, but as a rule of thumb an uninviting environment can do a lot even if the food and value is decent. It's part of the atmosphere after all..

I would give this place 4 stars but I just don't think I can when other establishments like pokenometry in California taste better, gives more avocado, smells more appetizing inside, and is more consistent.

To see is a good stop and had potential, but I just can't say it's a 4/5 star place just yet.",oJV6f25IK_UeghoFmalPvA,1,0,3,jhENSwRGVI_smPYGNwflSQ

As I was watching them make my bowl, I was already doubting the food. They mushed the rice (you can choose your choice of white, brown, or black) together with the rest of the ingredients and plopped the mush on top of the greens. It looked unesthetic, dry, and tasteless--exactly as it had tasted. I asked for some spicy mayo on the side as I picked out the pieces of fish to eat.

They had two lines one for desserts and drinks and one for the food.

Fresh humidifiers filled the room with a clean fresh smell which wasn't fishy at all. The whole decor is very Japanese like in the streets and markets in japan: open refrigerators full of fresh made nigiri (which no one was getting) and a smaller case filled with Japanese cakes, Pocky sticks and other sweets. 
The menu was a little confusing as they have pre made bowls as well as make your own. Pre made is set price at 9.50$ while the make you own large is around 10.50$ (see menu in pictures) 
Because we were hungry I wanted to get the most for my money. What is not made clear is that the set bowls only have 2-3 scoops of pre-chosen, non specified proteins and the portion size is about the same as a medium bowl. 
TIP TIP TIP: Def not worth getting a pre made bowl when most of the toppings are u limited and u get less protein in each bowl. For 1$ more u can get a large bowl with 5 scoops of protein. 
Here how's u choose:
1) choose base- white rice or brown, mixed greens or cucumber salad 
2) choose your protein: tuna, Spicy tuna, taco, salmon, tofu, etc
3) choose toppings: masago, eggs, green and red onion, furikake, ginger
Sauces: spicy mayo, ponzu, etc/more
Being from Hawaii where the poke bowl is from, I've eat tons of poke and poke bowls. What I found super weird is the amt of greens that were being put into my poke bowl. We had to actually ask the girl to remove a whole ton of lettuce from our bowl because it is non tradition to have lettuce As a base- but I guess they do this to please the gluten free/non carb loading people.
Anyways another thing that was annoying was that I'm 5 feet. The glass cover container covering the food along with the medium loud music, I couldn't for the life of me hear over the glass container that what the girl was asking me I wanted with my bowl. It was really frustrating. 
As for the quality of the fish it was really good and tasty. Can't really speak on the freshness because most poke places have previously frozen fish. 
I'm not sure if I'll be back because the portion sizes were too small for the price of 11$ for a large bowl. Don't come super hungry cause the portions of protein is tiny- even with 5 scoops of fish in the large bowl.",kwS_MjOUs1Jd_4X7B5t2yQ,8,2,3,7EPTG-GgNEABMS4nSoVdCQ

2757520,2016-08-29,0,po0p6NIro0cDrmKkcyPy0w,"With all of the new Poke bowl places sprouting around the Valley, this one ranks among my faves simply for the fact that they carry sushi hand rolls a la carte like the kinds you find in Japan. For those unfamiliar, they come wrapped in a special wrapper that keeps the Nori seaweed separate from the rest of the roll until you're ready to eat it. Crispy nori on a hand roll makes all the difference and To See Roll has them amongst prepackaged bentos and the like.

Aside from that, the Poke bowls are delicious. They take the ingredients and mix them in stainless steel bowls separate from the bowl they're served in (which is very similar to a FroYo place disposable bowl). My only gripe is cream cheese isn't among the toppings. But not to fret, the typical sushi fare is all there. 

You can create your own bowl or choose from one of their standard menu items.

Fairly large indoor seating area and the service was quick. Very reasonably priced for the portion you get and the fish quality is superb!",ZMUrBWZBXW6kdVUjV9szTg,1,0,4,MZF6hA3M0ZBjEhTYZ5g1qA

Food Evaluation. After I got my food, I noticed the color of the fish in my bowl were bright and clear. I could tell how fresh it was from the color.  When I ate it, the fish was chewy and it was like I could taste the ocean in my mouth. The smell from the bowl is fishy and sweet because of the poke sauce.

Thanks to the yelp check in offer I got a free scoop of protein. I added crab meat, cucumber salad, a bunch of toppings and some ponzu sauce. You can ask for different sauces on the side if you want to add more to your bowl. The rice was perfectly cooked and the fish were very fresh. I guess I'm not a huge fan of super white tuna though, so next time I'll stick to more salmon. 

I think a downside is that they only have bottled/canned drinks and the bowl was pretty small so I had a hard time mixing everything together.

This place is amazing!  I'm going to be honest; considering the fact that I grew up in Hawaii where traditional poke is NO WHERE NEAR what these bowls claim to be,  i was originally turned off by hype of modern ""sushi bowls"" being labeled as ""Poke"". However, it doesn't knock off any stars because this place is delicious!

Pricing is impeccable.  You cannot find a place anywhere in town that compares to the sizes of their bowls for the price they sell them at.. let alone the options that it includes.  Depending on the size of the bowl, you get a choice of either 2, 3 or 5 proteins, as many toppings and sauce as you'd like, most of them being at no additional charge... and a great wall selection of assorted roll's and imported snacks/drinks.

My fave? I always get a large size with 5 proteins and I switch between the options of salmon, spicy tuna, shrimp, regular tuna, albacore. I love their black rice (apparently there are major health benefits to this type of rice), I go crazy on toppings and i love their creamy and garlic ponzu sauce mixed.

My first two visits were poor because of the unwelcoming staff on shift who were also not very helpful and that experience in itself was enough for me decide I didn't really care to come back here. Because of convenience, as this place is so close to where I live, I ended up coming back a few more times, and it was refreshing to see familiar faces; our younger friends who have now gotten older & begun working here. 

They don't have a lot of options to choose from here, but their fish is definitely fresh. Close to the register they have a juice dispenser and even a miso soup dispenser! I have never seen that before. They also have this neat refrigerated section with snacks, drinks and sushi rolls you can purchase. 

The one thing I would really encourage the owner to change is their bowls. They look like (and probably are) the same bowls that Yogurtland uses. They are tall, wide cups but the rice as at the bottom and the food is seemingly stacked so what we end up having to ask the employees is to mix it all prior to placing it in the bowls. 

Other than that, I'm definitely taking a liking to this place.

**update** 

I've given some of the staff here the benefit of the doubt countless times upon dining here and consistently this one girl on shift just has terrible customer service. She doesn't smile, she doesn't talk or greet any of us, doesn't offer stamp cards, no eye contact, and generally comes off as if she's having a bad day....

As you walk into the restaurant, there are two lines, to the right is the line for poke bowl and the left you can order sushi. To my delight, they had pre-made single serving of hand rolled sushi you could select from. Unfortunately, because I got there towards the ending of lunch, a lot of the trays were empty. Once I figured out what I wanted from what was left, I went back to the front of the restaurant to grab a tray. I picked up a Rainbow, Philly and two Crunch rolls. The pre-made rolls are priced between $2.35 and $2.95. I also purchased a small bowl of miso soup for a $1. 

Before I forget, next to the pre-made sushis are a few dessert items and japanese drinks you can also select from.

I've made sushi and musubis before, but this was my first time having to ""roll"" my own pre-made sushi. Each roll is wrapped in plastic. However, when you unwrap the plastic, the rice and contents is separate and the nori is in it's own plastic wrap. But I get it. If not, a lot of times the nori gets soggy. So I found it interesting for me to have to unwrap everything from it's plastic wrapper to re-roll my sushi rice with the nori. 

You also have a choice of having a freshly made rolls that start at $7 to $13 depending on what you get.

In any case, its a nice clean restaurant. I'm definitely coming back because of the convenience of quickly grabbing a few sushi rolls for a quick and lunch.",leyNDNVu09Ldbg5ujPWMhQ,1,1,4,8oHF9yYQdt0KitnKhd-CMg

Overall the food was good, but I've been spoiled by how great California poke bowl joints are that I set my expectation bar very high. Once again another Vegas joint falls below comparison. 

Serving size was decent, but dwarfed by the others I've had before in California. Price was where I expected it to be. Quality was good and food tasted clean. Staff was cool. Didn't know if it was cool/weird that they served their poke in a frozen yogurt paper bowl, still contemplating.

I counted nearly 5 restaurants on Rainbow Boulevard alone between their house and here.  Wow- must be some high demand and heavy competition!

Nonetheless, To See Roll was pretty memorable. We each got a poke bowl- my husband ordered a combination (he subbed out salad for rice base) and I got a custom build-your-own. The fish was delish- very fresh. The sauces were also yummy. I liked the pour-your-own miso soup station; we even got a few refills.

Plus, they mix up the ingredients for you instead of letting you do it. That typically means a better bite when I'm shoveling it into my face.

The atmosphere is cool in here, but a bit strange bc you're directed to either go left for sushi or right for poke immediately at the entrance. Feeling like I beat the system, I went right and got both poke and sushi in a generously portioned combo!  With a Yelp Check-In, you'll receive a discount on combos, which include a roll and a bowl of your choice.  Depending on the type of roll, and the bowl size you choose, the combo price ranges from about $12-16. IMO, this is a great deal as the rolls were very fresh and the bowls totally hit the spot.  You get a lot for what you pay for, especially with the amount and options of protein. There's a lot of choices, but I only went for the tunas and salmon - super yum!

I thought the service was fair and patient, but could have been a bit better.  In general, poke spots really need to provide something on the ordering process 101.

They all are well rounded and know the product that they sell pretty well.  All the fish seems super fresh, and the serving size portion is great for the price.  Great poke bowls and I drive 30 minutes just to come eat here. The staff is super friendly as well. I will never go anywhere else to get my poke bowls.  

I typically order a medium or large bowl.  Depending on how hungry you are I would suggest the medium.  I do not like eating leftover sushi.  The medium bowl comes with three different types of fish.  I normally get the spicy albacore, spicy tuna, and white fish.  When you check in with yelp, you get a free protein.  So not only are you getting a rice bowl, but then you get 4 different types of fish for the price of 3.  

The staff does a great job with hand mixing the bowls, and they are pretty amazing.  I can't say anything negative about this place besides the fact that it is a small location, and maybe they should think about expanding locations and having more in different parts of the city.

The first time; at Sweet Poké, I disliked what I got for a number of reasons, including the overall taste of the final end product. This time, at To See Roll, I enjoyed the taste of my Korean Bowl a lot. 

I still have trouble embracing this style of poké because it is overwhelming for a first timer to order, you don't really know what the end product will be or look like (or wether the taste of each component will complement each other), and it isn't ""premixed"" for you, as they would in a salad. 

I know that this place isn't a salad place, but because the options for the bowl are either rice or salad, I'd actually prefer to have my salad mixed for me with the poke and other ingredients because otherwise I end up having to pick through my bowl this way and that while eating to try a little of everything, or worse--trying to mix my salad and poke myself--which ends up a mess of leaves and such falling everywhere. I am sure that if it were rice it'd be different, and I love rice, but poke bowls with rice usually give too much rice and not enough veggies for my taste, hence my salad dilemma. 

Overall, my Korean bowl had a bunch of very ethnic ingredients which went well together (I loved that it was not tailored to American tastes of Asian cuisine, but actually Asiaon tastes of Asian cuisine). Some things I wasn't a fan of, like the rubbery strings of seaweed, but it did add extra texture and taste to the bowl. The bowl wasn't spicy of course, Asian level spicy is hardly ever actually spicy unless we're talking curry, but it satisfied the poke craving temporarily. Also, it came with tofu miso soup and I threw in some extra masago on the side just for fun. The to-go packaging was beautiful and neat. 

Overall, a great spot to try out.",j8bhSD379qzoVa15RSCBUw,0,0,4,ARLmR1Vgy_fEqcnM7RSeNQ

To See Roll is a Chipotle-style poke bowl restaurant and one of the newest to join the poke bowl scene here in Vegas. I visited with some friends to catch up before we started our third year of school and it was great food with even better company!

You start by either picking a pre-made/pre-planned bowl or you can go the route that I went and create your own. There are three sizes: small, medium and large. I chose the medium bowl and it comes with 3 scoops or portions of fish that you choose from. 

Something that is unique about To See Roll is that they have the option of 'black rice' which the worker described as highly purified and healthier and low carb. I decided to try it along with scoops of ahi tuna, spicy tuna and salmon. There are a multitude of toppings and sauces that you mix in with your bowl after you choose your fish. Choose and mix to your hearts content!

The fish was fresh and of good quality as was all of the ingredients. I started a stamp card with them and seeing as I live right down the street, I will definitely be back soon. My only gripe and :( about this place was that the avocadoes in my bowl were hard/not ripe and they come in plastic packaged portions, not cut fresh.

When you first walk in the line you have the option to choose from rice or salad. Personally, I like to get half brown rice/half salad. They have some bowl combos for poke you can already pick from or you build your own. The sizes are based off how much fish that you want the small is 3 scoops and the large is 5 scoops. The one thing I like about this place is the unlimited toppings, it makes the bowl really stand out because some poke places puts a limit on you and who really wants that? 

One down side to this place is the bowl they use. It's really hard to mix so I always ask for a second bowl that I can use for mixing. Most of the time they'll be okay with giving me the bigger bowl, but sometimes they get kind of stingy about it.

Open the door and you are immediately greeted with this lightup air freshener that's puffing out aroma scent/air everywhere. Scent is a bit excessive and not good for people who are sensitive to smell like myself. Tables are glossy and shiny as mofo. Holy cow, it is so shiny you could probably use their table to do your makeup. 

We got their salmon lover bowl. Same procedure as other poke spots where they scoop proteins in a bowl and marinate with sauce before laying it on rice. Except the worker making our bowl squeezed out about half the bottle of sauce on salmon. Needless to say, those salmon slices were swimming in sauce. Or drowned in it. Other yelpers had mentioned that bowls here are bland so I'm not sure if they are working out some kinks and adding more sauce but it was way too much. 

I also have to mention that their bowl comes in paper cup used for frozen yogurt. The spoon they give you is also for frozen yogurt. I hate it. 

Bowl came with miso soup on the side. Instant miso soup. Bland.

4052657,2016-12-14,3,po0p6NIro0cDrmKkcyPy0w,"DIY poke bowl spots are a dime a dozen in the Las Vegas right now. To See Roll is my current favorite. It is rare if a week goes by and I have not had my TSR poke bowl fix for lunch.

The biggest issue I have had with other poke bowl spots is they just throw everything into a bowl and add sauce on top. To See Roll is the only place I have been to that sauces the protein separate from the other ingredients, which means your poke taste more like actual poke and your other ingredients do not get soggy as quickly.  

These are the other reasons why I think To See Roll is the best:

-The location is clean and thankfully does not have that funky fishy smell some other places have.
-It's affordable. I always build my own bowl, and a small is only $7! It is enough to fill me up most days. 
-Punchcards are offered, buy 10 bowls and get a medium for free!!
-Fresh and unique toppings, like daikon radishes. (I do wish mango would get added to the menu though!!)
-No upcharge for any toppings, unless you want to double up on crab or avocado. 
-Staff is usually very friendly and well trained. On my first visit, it was rather obvious I was dealing with extremely new employees. I have noticed a significant improvement on subsequent visits. 

If DIY poke bowls are not your thing, To See Roll also offers up premade sushi and an assortment of other items including desserts and a large variety of drinks. I have yet to try any of these items, but they appear well made and fairly priced.

I haven't tried every one of the new poke spots in town, I can not say that To See Roll is the absolute best. I do know I can get what I want for a great price at To See Roll, so I am a huge fan!",Ae4uXwFHp-5fGrt6OONaXw,5,3,4,rMO4Wf6wKyCg6H12TPV1QA

4106996,2017-03-03,4,po0p6NIro0cDrmKkcyPy0w,"This is good. It's my second favorite in town so far (out of five or so tried). It's just not quite to where I'd give it 5 stars.

To See Roll is actually one of the older, more-established members of the poke bowl craze that's hit Las Vegas. It's in the fairly new plaza at Rainbow at Badura, which was surprisingly packed at the tail end of lunch hour today. I guess I have shouldn't be surprised, considering how many other restaurants (Cafe Zupas, PizzaRev, Farmer Boys) share this parking lot. Fortunately, I was able to find a spot after a little circling.

The restaurant floor is oddly split, and arrowed signs at the entrance direct you either to the left (if you just want sushi or grab-and-go food/drinks) or to the right if you want poke bowls (but not sushi burritos, which aren't on this menu). I went to the right and waited just a few minutes in a fast-moving line to place my order of a build your own bowl. The model is pretty standard, and it's numbered step-by-step as follows:

1,) Size. Signature bowls are preset designs at $9.50 for medium or $1.20 for large bowls, but I wanted to customize my own large bowl ($10.75 for 5 protein scoops). You can also go for a $7 small or a $8.75 medium, which all come in differently sized bowls and therefore fit less of the other stuff.

2.) Base. Sou at Brew Tea Bar recommended the ""purple"" rice (actually listed as Black RIce), so I went for it. Brown rice would be nice too. White rice is probably too plain and therefore not worth it if it's not sushi rice, and To See Roll is not calling theirs sushi rice. I might try the greens or chips in the future too.

3.) Side Base. Crab meat or cucumber salad. Actually, the employee asked if I wanted both, and I said yes.

4) Proteins. I noticed at this point that the above items were going into a paper cylindrical bowl and that they had a separate metal bowl, which I've seen used as a mixing bowl at one other similar place. This also proved to be the case here, and my choices of protein (tuna, salmon, yellowtail, red snapper, super white tuna - 5 for the large size bowl) went into the mixing bowl.

5) Sauce. I went with the To See Sauce after I asked the employee what it was. Can't remember his response fully, but I think I caught the words ""sweet"" and ""soy."" He also asked if I wanted more sauces, and I said no but would probably consider adding a touch of sesame or ginger because they're usually solid flavors to have.

6) Toppings. I got green and red onions, corn, masago, seaweed salad, and avocado, which the employee hand-mixed with the proteins and sauce in that metal bowl. I also got furikake, sesame seeds, and radish sprouts, which all would've been nice to mix in as well, but oh-well-whatever. I didn't notice the ginger anywhere for some reason.

Everything was yummy. The black rice was nice and had some bite to it. The fish was fresh and cut into decent cubes, and I love super white tuna. I've yet to see anybody else offer super white. The even mixing of sauce and toppings helped to distribute the flavor pretty evenly, and I'll pretty much assume off-the-bat from now on that places which don't do this are going to be less-than-impressive.

I can't quite give the 5th star for a couple of reasons. First, the bowl is inherently flawed here because it is hard to reach the rice at the bottom of the bowl early on. This means that earlier bites will be more fish/toppings-heavy, and later bites will be a little more base-heavy. You'd need a more flaring top or something to get to the rice effectively. Oh, and the other reason? Some of the fish was way too chewy. I think it could've been the red snapper or possibly the yellowtail, but a few pieces had connective tissue, and you just can't have that.

To See Roll is definitely a nice poke bowl spot. It's one of the best in town, owing to solid ingredients and the mixing of sauce and toppings into the proteins. It's also significantly cheaper than my favorite location, which is also on Rainbow Blvd. And now I'm jealous again of people who live near Rainbow and not over halfway across town, so congrats to you if you're close to this restaurant.

Three days after they opened, I was definitely hooked to the point where I would go there every week or even almost 7 days straight lol (amusingly enough one of my friends actually did that haha). 

At the entrance you'll see two glowing air diffusers with aromas of ginger if you smell closely enough. I thought that was an interesting touch and liked the idea of having a diffuser or humidifier around so I actually tried to google and find the exact ones for my personal use lol! The ambiance was very 'asianesque' - with shiny wooden tables and benches. You can get various intricately packaged sushi/bento to-go on the left hand side of the restaurant as well as Japanese snacks such as pocky, soft drinks, jello, etc. 

I would come here sometimes after my graveyard shift and would be greeted by the owner, Bruce, with friendly smiles to start the morning. I liked how he would actually be in the forefront on scene and interact with customers as well as so some labor such as rearranging the tables and chairs - it gave me the impression that he actually cares about customer service and giving a positive perception, which is a nice touch because its rare to see this at most restaurants in Vegas. Charlie the chef as well would greet us from behind the counter with friendly chatter so it was nice being welcomed by enthusiastic and sociable employees. 

My typical order here would be: Large, mixed greens, crab salad + cucumber, yuzu+sesame sauce+green onion, cajun albacore+salmon+super white tuna+spicy tuna+yellowtail, masago,bean sprouts,extra avo, yellow radish, seaweed, furikake, and finishing touches of drizzled spicy mayo with said mayo on the side. The yuzu and sesame sauces complimented well as it was neither too sweet nor too salty. There was a time that they would run out of yuzu sauce I was recommended to try the house sauce+sesame combo as it was close to the same thing, and it was, just less sweet. 

As a side note, their black rice is definitely filling as it was warm and moist but it did lack flavor at the bottom so I would think that adding rice seasoning would do it better (they do offer that option too) prior to choosing your proteins. 

If I had the choice and time though, I would come here every day til I get sick of it. Its the closest thing to California's PokiNometry, so I'm rather overzealous about this haha!! :D",pHk6gWq3gFPNG0smjd9cRQ,10,7,5,kvqGDDEoiFnjqZyIJS2F6Q

There are two things that determine how a poke place is for me. 1. the quality of the fish 2. the portion size. The poke shops in Vegas have all been disappointing in one of those categories. To See Roll- A+ for both. 
Tuna, yellowfish and salmon were my favorites for the meat. White rice and UNLIMITED TOPPINGS. The toppings on the board don't exactly match the ones on the counter so pay attention to both! Don't miss out on the tamago and edamame like I did by only looking at the board. Extra scoop of meat with Yelp check in! The avocado was small in portion and starting the brown. Don't waste the extra money for another helping. 
Ask to sample the sauces. The To See sauce is a mix of soy and mustard.... which doesn't describe it well. It has a slightly tangy taste and really no mustard-y taste at all.

The spicy tuna was good, I would get that again. However, I accidentally ordered a rolls that had crab stick, the Spider roll, that wasn't bad but not good. The rice is good, and the tuna was good too. At $4 you get what you pay for, and that's fair.

I love the way this place is designed. The concept of this restaurant is very similar to chipotle. They have a variety of items on the menu. I ordered their specialty Salmon Bowl and it comes w/ the miso soup. At first, I was very confused why I got bowl with just tofu and seaweed. The technology in this restaurant is like those of China. They have a freaking self serve Miso Soup machine and water machine!! FYI there is no soda machine here. BUT the miso soup and water is all you can drink. It was so cool! I think I liked the machine the best.

The salmon bowl was very tasty. Next time I come back, I would probably ask for more sauce. It was a little dry for my taste. It came w/ lots of veggies and this place is not stingy w/ their fish. Thank you!!!

There are lots of parking available as it's located in a large plaza. If you plan on coming here often, they have a punch card. So be sure to get that so you get good discount after 10 meals!",-RA9NLalwmRTOX_8UMHnVQ,2,1,5,j4o82J2db_0T0QV1tpwvDg

The ambiance of the place is a little weird to me. They're trying to go for traditional Japanese but I feel like the large bamboo seating just takes up space and makes the place dark. That aside, this  food is good.

The prices can't be beat with the portion sizes & the items they have to offer. The setup is like a Chipotle: choose a size (S,M,L), build your own or choose from their signature bowl (but I recommend building your own), choose a base (white/brown rice, mixed greens, chips, half&half), choose your protein (range of tunas, salmon, octopus, etc), pick sauce for your fish to be quickly marinated in (I always go with mixing Yuzu, Garlic Ponzu & Sesame Oil), then toppings (masago, seaweed salad, tofu, etc.) They offer nigiri pieces & rolls, as well as miso soup, udon noodles, & various Japanese candy & drinks. My little complaint about this place is that they don't add much sauce to the fish, so that's why I mix sauces to gain more flavor. & I would prefer the fish to be colder & fresher.

The variety of protein choices is amazing. They have the basics like salmon, tuna, and shrimp. What was great was that they had yellowtail and red snapper, plus unique options like cajun tuna and albacore. The scoops were generous, cut into a good size, and fresh. 

The sauces choices are vast. I went with ginger and too see sauce, which was a safe choice since I knew what it would taste like together. I did ask for a popular combo of sauces and only got a list of what was popular. It would be nice to have a ""popular list"" of sauce combinations because there's so many choices! They also sauce the fish just enough - it does not overpower  nor am I wishing there was more flavor. 

Onto the toppings! They had all the general toppings you would find at a poke establishment. The sprouts and edamame were a different and added a nice crunch to the bowl. The furikake on top of the rice was also a nice touch to give the rice flavor.

Overall, a really solid poke place. Did not try the rolls, but will definitely be back for poke. I just really dislike the physical bowls themselves. It's a nice design/look, but not very practical for eating.",nw-xhnHsse5BHZK886laKQ,1,1,4,uyeP2mOGXhosUI4YFspl1A

As such, I opted for the unagi bowl.

I'm happy I took this route. Everything about this bowl was great. The ingredients worked well together; salty from the unagi sauce (albeit a bit too much was drizzled) and sweet from the tamago (sweet egg). There's a nice variety of texture as well (masago, fresh sprouts, unagi). Topped with a bowl of miso soup, it was quite a satisfying meal.",0nDeoyxAaWHcihihxiIa3A,2,2,4,RLMhPYypBlFhbiReNPkBbA

To see roll is like the other poke places, chipotle style. You can opt to make your own bowl or have a signature bowl. My first two visits I ordered signature bowls & I did not like them. I think it was because of the sauce? But I'm not sure. If you do order a signature bowl though, you get a free miso soup!

They take the build-it-yourself formula of the pizza places that give you all the toppings you want for $9 or so,  it instead go with a pokebowl twist.  Choose a small, medium, or large, and go from there.

Your customization options range from the type of base (type of rice), side (crab meat, cucumber salad), proteins (fish), sauce (you can mix multiple), and toppings (10 or so different choices).  Based on my calculations, there are over 6,000,000 possible combinations of ingredients, but do keep in mind that I haven't taken a math course since nineteen ninety eight when the undertaker threw mankind off hll in a cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table.

The ingredients have all been of good quality, and service is quick so you're not waiting around too long to get your food.  Another nice perk is that one side of the restaurant has open refrigerators with some premade rolls, Japanese desserts, and Japanese soft drinks.

They also had a humidifier at the front to help keep the place well humidified. The drinks were nicely placed on shelfs and the food was nicely presented.

*****Food: The food, ah yes the Poke was amazing! I would've built my own custom bowl however I decided to try one of their featured bowls, the Korean Poke Bowl. The reason why I choose this was because it was labeled to be the spiciest and you know me, I love spicy! The Korean Bowl was just delicious, there was a good amount of fish vs rice ratio and the flavor was just there unlike other places that are greedy with their sauce. This place really gives you the full sauce flavor! Definitely recommend. I also wasn't sure I would finish a large bowl, however after realizing how good it was, I devoured it like a baby who hasn't eaten in weeks!

*****Service: The service was friendly and patient with me, I explained that I was out of town and new to the place and they took the time to educate me and how the process works and what their recommendation is. Great work guys!

Overall, I would definitely recommend this place and I approve for being a great Poke getaway!

My bro and I chose to make our own.   He got the large for around $11.  It comes with 5 scoops of your choice of protein  
I got the medium for 3 scoops. Two scoops salmon and one spicy tuna.   Both were great. The salmon was nice and fatty.  

All bowls of course include rice. For options I saw white, brown, black etc.  

Something I really loved were the included toppings! I got imitation crab, cucumber,  masago,  cucumber, avocado, sprouts,  white and green onion. 

You also choose from a wide variety of sauces.  We both went with the house one.  It was really good.

Their bowls look exactly like the cups from yogurt land but just slapped with their logo on it. Looked weird to me. 

I ordered a large bowl, which came with 5 scoops of fish. I got half salad and half white rice as my base. Rice was so plain didn't taste like the Japanese rice (sushi rice). There was no dressing for the salad. The sauce that gets mixed with your  fish I wasn't really impressed with the taste. I went with their suggestion, which was the Korean spicy sauce. They didn't have the spicy miso sauce even tho that probably would've tasted better. The fish portion I guess was ok....since I did have 5 diff fishes in my bowl. 


I'll probably give this place another try since they just opened. They do have a stamp card which is pretty neat to me. I just think maybe they should change their bowls tho. They're yogurt bowls!!!",Zf-Iwfm1g0XEWWnA7CGtLQ,8,1,2,lBPQjfXbmjwf18UaFoxaZw

I selected a medium bowl, which comes with 3 choices of protein. I got super white tuna, yellowtail, and shrimp. The fish is fresh, no doubt. My favorite thing here was that they offer black rice, which is super nutritious! It's not too hard and it has a good taste.  Service is average. The miso soup is self serve. There is a section for ready to eat rolls, desserts, and Japanese drinks.

5317411,2018-03-04,1,po0p6NIro0cDrmKkcyPy0w,Literally disappointed in their new way of charging vegans for ordering a rice bowl. They added a preset button which is nice. But it charges more for a bowl now than what they use to charge someone not getting meat. I literally paid two dollars more than I normally paid for the same thing before. It's an inconvenience to loyal customers going there for the affordable bowls. I don't go to other places because they are way over priced. I'm no longer going to be going there because I can possibly find another location that charges less or make it at home for a third of the cost. They have now become one of the overpriced locations that care more about the money than their customers.,5vqq3gS1yxwBFo54mm6Scw,0,0,1,zVFBV9A6SamRXsuz_UR_Jg

To See Roll being the third one on Rainbow just blocks away from Sweet Poke, and Jaburrito.  I used to have to drive all the way to my beloved Poke Express in Henderson just to get some good poke. Poke Express is still my all time favorite, but To See Roll definitely comes in second. They have a wide variety of fish options that I haven't seen at the other places and they are very generous with their portions! The price isn't so bad either for all the food you get! I got the large  ""build your own"" bowl for $10.75. A couple weeks ago I went to a different poke place and ordered a medium. The portions was so small that I was still hungry afterwards. I wasn't sure what To See Roll's portions was going to be like so I went large. This time I wished I went smaller! My bowl came with 5 proteins of my choice plus as much toppings as I want! Everything tasted pretty fresh! I also love that they carry black rice! Another cool thing about this place is that they have a fridge area on the side of the restaurant where you can select various kinds of individual nigiri, rolls and Japanese snacks!

keep in mind the signature bowls come in medium size or bigger. if you want the small size, which i probably will always get just because i don't usually eat a lot, it's the make-your-own deal. which is still great! 

1. you get to pick your base (rice/salad, half&half, etc)
2. what do you like? can get your cucumber & crab meat & everything here
3. proteins (salmon is my favorite!)
4. sauce (i've only tried the to-see sauce but ask for it on the side otherwise it might be too salty overall)
5. the rest of the toppings. avocado, masago, seaweed salad comes with it until you ask for a second order. then it costs $1.50 each.
6. sides. they have a dispenser thingy for miso soup. cool.

service is pretty good. my cashier on my 2nd visit was pretty friendly and helpful. not everything is super fast yet but it should get better later on.

when you walk in, on the left they have sushi rolls and other little goodies so check that out if you're not a raw fish/poke fan.

These chipotle style places are on the come up - that is the best way for me to describe restaurants like this. You have signature dishes you can choose from, but the lovely lady suggested we make our own since we can pick and choose what we want.

They offer 3 different sizes - small, medium, or large. You're give the option between white or black rice along with rice reasoning. They have a wide selection of meat. I chose yellowtail, tuna, and salmon. They have a wide variety of sauces - I was recommended the garlic ponzu. I'm a garlic lover, so it was an excellent choice. I also had the meat mixed with yum yum sauce. Lastly, you have your toppings to choose from. 

They have a miso soup machine, which I found quite interesting. I mean... Let's be honest. How many of you have seen a miso soup machine?

Some perks that they have is quick sushi pick-up to go. They have freshly made, already packed sushi rolls that you can just buy. They also have a good amount of Japanese snacks near the registrar!

CUSTOMER SERVICE: 4/5
The staff is not as eagerly friendly as when I first started going, but they're still kind all the same. The glass barrier and loud music still makes it hard for them to hear you order. Sometimes, they'll mishear me and mistakenly use sauce I didn't ask for, and they seem a little annoyed they have to remake it. It wasn't the case when I first started going, and it also makes me feel a little bad.

They still have pretty good customer service here though. The last couple of bowls I've had here were a little lacking with the fish. So when I asked for an extra scoop of crab meat, and was informed it's the same price as an extra scoop of fish, I declined. The girl serving me was extremely nice though and gave me a heaping scoop of crab in the first place. Which brings me to my next point...

SERVINGS AND PRICING: 4/5
The prices are still reasonable for a poke bowl, but they aren't as generous as their competitors. They charge you extra for everything, and they seem really stingy now. Maybe their model wasn't very profitable before, but it's hard to come here and know it wasn't always like this. And also that there's 101 new poke places who won't charge you for a couple extra pieces of tamago.

It looks nice and clean, but the last two times I've gone here, it has smelled really bad. So bad, that as soon as I went in the door, I have promptly walked out. A place that smells weird makes me nervous about eating the raw fish it serves. Maybe it was just a couple of off days? 

FOOD: 4.5/5 
I still stand by the fish and the sauce here. The fish tastes a little better than their competitors and I'm a fan of their house sauce. Their miso soup is pretty good, but if you get a refill, it tastes like water. I'm not sure if it was the machine that day, or if it actually isn't meant to be refillable and it just gives out hot water (whoops). 

Some other things I didn't like? That they serve the poke bowls in a yogurt cup and the Too See Rolls are actually not very good, despite being called Too See Roll (weird right?) 

OVERALL: 3.5/5 
This place is pretty good if you're in the area. I don't really think there's any reason to be driving past other poke places to get here though. They're doing the same thing, and Too See Roll's one cutting edge (the Too See Roll) is not very good.",ZIqkcApOQh8QfiydYSiLaQ,2,3,4,OGLeQPMG38YVokDllwM6Xw

I had the rainbow roll and my husband ordered the Dragon roll. Everything was fresh and extremely tasty.",V7y_-LF5saejz-2Uy7EBJg,0,0,4,4b5ONe1XAo4sk8ybBf1o4A

5967465,2016-10-07,2,po0p6NIro0cDrmKkcyPy0w,"Seems like poke spots are a dime a dozen lately. And being from Hawaii,I can pretty much do the poke bowls myself. So when I'm expected to pay for it, you best believe I'm holding these places up to a higher standard. Ok, I like the concept of the already made sushi bar. That's kewl. What's not kewl, having people stroll in around 4pm on a Saturday and there's only a handful of sushi left? What's that about? You could at least keep it going until 7 for the dinner rush? I was so disappointed when I got here especially since that is what I was really looking forward to. Since the sushi was a bust I decided to try their poke bowl and got my little one a miso soup (which is out of a machine -_-). The menu was a little confusing and the person who was helping me wasn't very helpful either. I ended up getting their To see Roll bowl and it was nothing to appealing. It actually had a wasabi taste to it and that killed my mood for it completely. I asked the worker is there is any wasabi in the sauces used for this bowl or anything in the bowl that uses wasabi and he said no. So thought that was weird. My kid took one sip of the soup and pushed it away which is rare since she loves miso soup.

Is this a place i would visit again? I don't know, maybe if I'm in the neighborhood and its early so I can see more of their sushi selection but quite honestly I'm not really going out of my way to come here especially since I live over 25 mins away.",Znid_azpcHmdRMHGicmkWA,5,5,3,s7xsDUbS9v5VFiq4myG5Dg
