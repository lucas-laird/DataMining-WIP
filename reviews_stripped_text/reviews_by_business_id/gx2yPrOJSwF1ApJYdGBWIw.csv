I don't need silence when eating my ramen, but the music was way too loud. It's not really enjoyable when you server has to yell at you, and you have to yell back for them to hear you. To make matters worse, there was awkwardness at the communal table between the random couples (yes I've sat at communal tables before without issue). Thank goodness the food was better than I expected! If it was just based on food, I'd have given it 4/4.5 stars.",dl69uaA2E0Ee2x7kyhNWQA,0,0,3,NiNi02Qr2zteMROtupFVYg

Also got a Jinya bun, pretty similar to a pork bun, which was really good too.

For starters, I decided to go for the Jinya Pork Bun, which was amazing, as well as the Pork Gyoza, which was actually really good, probably the best gyoza I've had at a restaurant. For the main course, I had the Tonkatsu Black (Jinya No. 1), which had a very rich pork and garlic broth that felt a little salty at times.

260487,2016-07-04,0,gx2yPrOJSwF1ApJYdGBWIw,"With 4* we decided to try this ramen spot out, but I was highly disappointed. There were only us and another group of people in line. The hostess asked if we wanted to sit in the center table, which is a communal table. We said no we wanted a booth, but not less than 10 min, she asked again if we wanted to sit at the center table. I honestly think she forgot that we requested a booth. Anyway once we were seated, our waiter told us about the menu, but the music was a bit too loud and we couldn't hear him too well. 

We ordered gyoza because they ran out of the jinya buns that other Yelpers were raving about. Hubs ordered the pork chashu and he thought it lacked flavor. I had a taste of the pork and the first thing I noticed was that the temp wasn't hot enough, it was just warm. I waited more than 5-7 min before my ramen came out and having to wait that long got me a bit irked. I had the cha cha cha pork chashu ramen. I liked the thick wavy noodles, but the noodles were broken, not long like other ramen places. Another disappointment was that the broth was very thick and tasted very rich. I know I ordered the pork broth, but it just seemed fatty. I've had other pork broths at different locations and I've never had it this rich. I couldn't even finish it and my hubs didn't even want it. The positive thing was the seasoned egg and our nice waiter. I don't think I'll be frequenting this place anytime soon or again.

301193,2017-10-21,0,gx2yPrOJSwF1ApJYdGBWIw,"OK, so...I've been going to Jinya for a while. Like, a few years. I've had almost everything on the menu, and honestly don't expect much from the staff. I used to love the food, but lately the quality has gone down. I've had maybe two or three servers deliver good service throughout all the times i've gone. But man, tonight might've just ruined it for me. So on a weekend expect to wait 30-45 minutes. I really don't care, it's not the staff's fault, and I'm used to waiting the long periods of time. So we sit down, me and my bf order three beers, but our server informs us she can only give us two, and we have to finish them before we get the third. Weird, since she didn't even card us. Strange (and fairly new, at least they never did that before) policy, but it's not her fault. We get our jinya buns, which were excellent. It was all downhill from there. We ordered the salmon poke tacos, which are normally better. These were utterly soaked in whatever marinade they used, it spilled out of the taco and completely overpowered everything. We got the spicy creamy shrimp tempura, and it overall it tasted good. But the takoyaki was a complete mess. Not worth the money at all. Not worth anything. It disappointed me because I had wanted to try it for so long. It was extremely bland, it had the consistency of soggy stuffing with very little actual octopus, and there was no egg tartar... only a mess of mayo and sauce as a 'bed'. And the California Poke bowl... another thing I had wanted to try for so long that was a huge let down. The portion of spicy tuna was incredibly small- the amount of ginger they gave me was actually a bit bigger than the scoop of spicy tuna. Couldn't even eat it with the rice because whatever sauce they used they just decided to get a giant ladle and pour it over. I had to leave 1/3 of it because it was actually sitting in a pool of sauce!! They gave it to us with spicy mayo which was very thin- more like a liquid mayo based dressing. The dressing tasted alright (we used it to make the takoyaki taste better- actually like something instead of bland soggy bread) but it was no match for the sauce they used in the bowl. I would have complained, but our server never came back to us once we ordered. Another busser/server took our plate away too quickly to get his attention. I'm not sure if they didn't hear us over the insanely loud music or they were just ignoring us. It wasn't until 15 minutes after we finished that someone (a different server) came up, realized we were missing a drink (the beer we never received), and got it for us. Again, all too quickly to talk about how bad the food was. He came, and just dropped off the beer and receipt at once, and hurried away. I gave up trying to get their attention. Not once did anyone ask me how everything was, how the food tasted, how my experience was, or anything. Only thanked me after paying. As much as I loved Jinya, that was probably one of the worst food experiences I've had. And no, we never did see our server again.",Undygt9cXq37kiLXWze7EQ,0,0,2,bepHa9fGv9ExxGtAfQXy3g

Also I chose this place too because of the review of the tempura Brussel sprouts and they didn't have any when I went. Shame.",NXQUy56MUez8BZX_MlFq3A,0,0,4,5Z9HwoyDZqFXXthkASoReQ

I give this place 1 star because service was terrible.

First, there was about 7 people waiting at the door and hallway even though there were about 8 or 9 seats open and clean table with chopstick and napkin already set. The waitress doesn't start seating those open seats until she's finish talking with her friend.

Second, while waiting to be seated the kitchen staff comes out from the kitchen and start taking a dinner break and starts eating at cashier just by the entrance where customers are waiting to be seated.

Third, when I ordered KAEDAMA (extra noodle) it took about 30min even the people who ordered extra noodle after I did was getting it. I asked why and seems like there was miscommunication between the cook and waitras. The waitress comes to me after talking to the cook says to be it should be ready in couple min without any apology.

Anyways, I was greated right away.  I was the only.person in there for awhile.  Granted I got there right when they open.  They apparently.have specials that last until a certain date.  Thats nice to.know.in case you LOVE the special you know they will have it until a certain time.  

I had the tonkonsu ramen black, gyoza, salad, and the squid balls.  The salad came out first.  It was mixed greens with some dressing.  A typical salad.  The squid balls came out next.  It was good and filling!! It was 6 pieces...with lots of sauce.  I never had anything like this before so I cant say it was the best, but awesome choice.  The squid was hot but I found it to be cakey with some bites.  Still good just texture.

Gyoza came next.  Nothing spectacular.  Then the ramen.  By this time I was getting full.  The both is nice.  I like the chasu and the egg.  The noodles...meh it was aldente.  I like my noodles soggy or a little but softer.  But it was good tasting.  Just not what I was excpeting.  It was the thinner kind...im thinking maybe I need to try the thick noodles before I truely render my verdict about this place. 

Overall good customer service.  The waiter filled.up my water...and was attentive.

399454,2017-10-26,0,gx2yPrOJSwF1ApJYdGBWIw,"Jinya is the more American approach to ramen in the sense that there's room for alot of customization as well as various appetizers and sides that can accompany these dishes. The fact that this place is open until 3 lends itself to becoming the go to place for locals in the industry. The vibe is always a modern sexy type of feel with the rustic interior design, open ceilings, and dim lights lit by tastefully designed gastropub esque lighting. 

Service: This place gets very busy and there's usually lines out the door at times and sometimes it's faster to eat at the spot then getting it togo as togos can take up to 2 hours or more sometimes. With all that in mind the service could still be better as once they take your order you'd be hard pressed to find them again so you have to make sure you get everything you want in. They tend to forget alot of things sometimes as well which is annoying as you have to flag them down in a sea of people at times while your food gets cold. But the servers are all friendly and nice but the execution is like I said hit or miss. 

Food: There's alot going on in the menu and sometimes it feels like it's too much. There's alot of gimmicky food items on the menu but the main dishes are all on point. 

Appetizers: The takoyaki is one of my favorite dishes and we always make sure to order it. The ratio is perfect and the way it's fried and drizzled in the sauce as well as topped with plentiful amounts of nori/onions is enough to get the mouth watering. I don't really bother with any other appetizer, but I have tried the Jinya bun which is good but a little pricey for what it is. 

Ramen: The ramen served here is creative yet sometimes to a fault. There's certain ones that offer alot of toppings and stuff but when eating you realize you didn't even need or necessary enjoy the toppings with your ramen. We like to keep it simple with the usuals being the Tonkatsu white and Spicy Chicken Ramen. The broth here is more heavy and definitely more oily but still delicious as sometimes one craves a more intense flavor profile. Adding the fresh garlic makes the ramen 10x better (beware of smelly breath after). The noodles are more darker and is definitely better when stirred in with the broth. Egg and Chashu is the usual affair where it's very soft and melts right in your mouth. Kaedama is always good and they let you swamp the noodle types which is nice if you ever feel like switching it up.

Jinya is definitely a great spot to take a friend who's never had Ramen as there's such a variety and customization option that they're sure to find something they like. The modern interior is also very cool and is definitely a unique place to slurp ramen in. Jinya has become a staple in the Las Vegas community as attested by the lines out the door during peak periods and is a great late night option.",rfD1rP1mwozBj7pJ1eS88Q,1,0,4,tP2KitbCkOkzO89H_2zohA

We started off by ordering the crispy chicken appetizer and our waiter said that it would be happy hour within 10 minutes and he could place it then so we agreed.  In the meantime we each placed our order for ramen.  We got our ramen but not the chicken even after we finished eating the ramen and by that time at least 30 min had passed from the time that our waiter said he would place that chicken order.  

Another server saw that we needed water refills and said he would come back with it than our waiter also passed by and offered to have it refilled but minutes passed and no refill...finally that other server realized he forgot and came back.  

We finally asked for the check and we weren't charged for the chicken appetizer because it obviously was never placed.  As we were leaving I told the server and he said ""do you still want it?  It's coming out"" and I said ""no"" because clearly we were leaving and how could it be coming out if it was never placed.

Sora, Monta and Ichiza have been my favorite to date with subtle differences that make each unique and about on par with each other. However, Jinya is on another level completely. Jinya has great ramen and offers a variety of broths that are complex and delicious. Most ramen places offer half a dozen add-ons or less. Jinya has a huge add-on menu (20+ options) for the ramen. They have a decent tapas and basic sushi menu, the brussel sprout tempura is crazy tasty. And they have a legit alcohol menu that has craft beers (stone & ballast point) and even a lychee-tini and  mimosas and some nice wines and sake. The decor is like minimalist contemporary and there's always hip jams playing to create a groovy vibe. There's a small section of bar seating, about a dozen tables and one huge group table that seats about 20. I've tried the vegetable ramen, which had so many vegetables I was kinda overwhelmed in a good way. I've also had the spicy chicken ramen, which was so good I actually said while eating ""goddamn this is good ramen"" like 8 times while I was eating it.

I ordered Tonkotsu Ramen with extra noodle and extra broth. Comboed it with 4 pc gyoza and curry rice bowl with salads.

Salad came first. Salad is spot on.

The gyoza and the curry rice came next. This was already 11 dollars. This was not worth it but the taste is good but I feel I can get the same thing somewhere else for a better price.

Now the Ramen. Took while to come out and we waited and waited while we see our friends take theirs to their stomachs. But anyways, here we go.

The charsui was plain. Seems like it wasn't marinated for a day or 2 like most traditional Japanese charsui are made. The tops are great and presentation of the Ramen is great. Taste of the broth is good. It is up to participate of what a Tonkotsu Ramen is.

My bottom line is that this is a regular ramen bar if you want your ramen fix. The ambiance and presentation of the food is what's attracting the customers. As for the pure taste it is great, right between good and excellent/super.",olsecnI8sQH4ENEtEkP6wQ,0,0,4,nswmIOYkq5rI92_wvp9QLw

587663,2014-12-21,0,gx2yPrOJSwF1ApJYdGBWIw,"Short: Lacked flavor, but good place.

Long:

Arrived here after noon on a Friday. Not the best area for a ramen shop, and not that many people in (though I've been to better ramen shops with less people). Service was a bit off as the girl didn't know how to welcome a guest in Japanese (said ?????? rather than ???????? which was kind of funny). Menu is rather typical for a shop specializing in tonkotsu ramen. Black tonkotsu ramen with extras being their specialty so I ordered that ($11). Food came out rather quick for being a little busy (not as quick as Monta roman when it's not busy though).

When I say the food lacked flavor, I do mean it. I've been to Monta (one of the best restaurants in Vegas, IMO), Hiromaru and Fukamimi that all do tonkotsu ramen, and each have their cravats. For Jinya, the whole bowl just lacked that strong punch of flavor you should get from tonkotsu. The chashu pork was nice, but wasn't seasoned enough and lacked flavor. The toppings were the usual deal. But the biggest let down was the soup broth just did not have a strong richness to it. In fact, I think it's thickened with corn starch to help it become thicker rather than letting the richness of the broth support it. Other than that, nothing really stood out. 

Is it terrible? No. And there's many other things on the menu that people might like. 

But for a ramen shop, there's a good list of better places out there like Monta, Hiromaru, Fukamimi, and Sora. I recommend those first.",kBoCLXsjzpSTpOKC9J6FUg,1,0,3,DBxUiYMzCaayEGGfMB4CCw

However, there is one huge negative to this place. The ramen. I don't think I've had a good bowl of ramen here in the near 10 times I've been. My wife has said the broth is very slimy which she says is a indicator that the noodles are cooked along with the broth. The worst part for myself is that the flavor of the ramen have a greasiness to them. Almost like fried chicken. Especially their Tokyo Yatai. It tasted like KFC in a bowl. This flavor extends to their other ramen, like the Tonkotsu ramen. Also, the broths are very one dimensional. I feel a good broth should have a depth of flavor - a bit spicy, rich, salty, etc. But the broths at Jinya are just flat, generic tasting. 

That is why for all the positives, I just can't get behind Jinya. The ramen isn't very good, actually it's below average. That's alright if it's a generic Japanese restaurant or Izakaya, but for a ramen shop that specializes in ramen, that is damning. There are so many other options in Las Vegas, that you should skip Jinya. When most of their ramen are approaching the $10 price range, I feel you should be getting a great product.",V-FM3wh4wJ6UKdKA4lhbPQ,0,0,2,k-095ms3CSIMoJ8wNcj4vQ

 I was seated immediately as there was just a party of 1. They sat me at the bar, and took my order quickly.  The waitress asked if I had been there before and when I told her I hadn't, she explained the menu and reccommended her favorite dish which had chicken and pork broth. I love pork, so I ordered the tonkotsu assari. It came out immediately. The broth was actually a lot lighter than what I am used to.  I like my broth heavy and thick. There were plenty of veggies on top. At first I was scared that it'd be all veggies, but my noodles were hiding underneath the mountain of bean sprouts. The noodles were the only noodleson the menu that were thick. One of the reviews complain there was only 1 piece of chasu, but mine had 3 pieces. 

My younger sister last minute wanted some ramen, so I order the spicy chicken ramen with a spice flavor of hot for her. That order actually took a little bit longer as it got more crowded.  Her noodles were thinner and the broth was more of a chicken flavor. I did like the spice level of her ramen broth. When I ordered the noodles for take out, they put the noodles in one container and the broth in another container. The garnishes are on top of the noodles. My sister just put the noodles in the broth, and it tasted wonderful. They do have a drive through coming soon, which is probably how they will package that. I wonder how the drive through is going to work as the noodles do take a while to cook... 

Just a minor complaint. I like spicy as I am part Korea, but they didn't have any chili oil. Sadness. They did have chili powder and spicy sauce, but it just wasn't the same without my chili oil. 

The service was really good, and they waitresses checked on me several times to ensure that everything was okay. It just didn't taste better than what I expected.",yP9UmCxs1PSqljLfpR9R5g,1,0,3,1QvpmJoGNIosV2pAtXJXGA

The Tonkatsu Black, presentation and ingredients-wise, reminded me of NY's Ippudo's Akamaru Modern bowl (which to this day is the best bowl of ramen I have ever had). The taste however was disappointing. I waited a minute to start eating my bowl because I was waiting for my additional topping of corn, but the broth was lukewarm and watery.

Their gyoza is the most delicate, soft, & gentle... There must be a secret behind it.
The Jinya Bun is a must every time I go.  The flavor is always spot on, though the size of the meat has varied from time to time.
If in doubt of which ramen to order and you enjoy spicy foods, definitely order the Spicy Chicken Ramen.  It is the perfect level of spiciness. It is hot enough to make you eat too much of it, but not so spicy that you can't eat it.  There's also an option to add more noodles to your bowl.
The restaurant has a cool,hipster soundtrack.  I sometimes find myself downloading songs that I have heard at Jinya!
If you visit the restaurant in the evening, you will likely wait for a table.  I promise it is worth the wait!

Well, at 6 PM, the center table had 12 open seats, & we were still standing.  It felt like Melanie was dragging it out on purpose.  She would very slowly and deliberately count out 7 menus, answer a few calls, put the menus down, use the orange highlighter on the roster, answer the phone again, pick up the menus again, and recount them, all the while the 12 seats remained open for nearly 15 minutes.  Does she think she works at a nightclub on the Strip?  As we were waiting, a party of 10 came up, and she told them it would be a 2 hour wait!  It was so ridiculous.

Initially, we were a little puzzled with what actually came with the combo, but we were pleasantly surprised when we learned we didn't have to choose between ramen or the rice dish. We were given half orders of each, gyoza and almond tofu dessert. We chose Tonkotsu Spicy, Spicy Chicken ramen, and we each had the pork bowl. 

Both broths were nicely developed and perfectly seasoned. However, I enjoyed the chewiness of the thick noddles in the Tonkotsu a bit more than the thinner version in the spicy chicken. I'm not a big fan of eggs in general, and the seasoned egg in the pork bowl did nothing to woo me. The pork though was succulent and rich with flavor.

I got the Cha cha cha, and on the menu it says its for garlic lovers and that is why I ordered it. It was overloaded with green Onions and a bit too much bean sprouts.

But overall the ramen bowl was pretty good, thick sauce and thick noodles and I love that about it. 
I didn't mind the overload of green onions but the bean sprout was too much for my preference. Every bite was surely crunchy but at the same time every crunch of the bean sprout was diluting the flavor of ramen itself.  Meat was okay, in my opinion and the egg the came with it was pretty cold in the center and i didn't like that.

Pros: Great atmosphere that has both a modern, and authentic feel to it. 
          Excellent, quick, and friendly service.
          Great variety in their Ramen menu.(For Ramen)
          Open til 3am, I mean really? 3am Definitely helps when you are craving it.

Cons: Really there's only one. And it would be consistency, most of the time the food is perfect. However a couple of times I've noticed the base to either be completely over-powering, or slightly underwhelming and that's only happened maybe twice. 

All in all, definitely a must go to when you're in the mood for some absolutely delicious ramen.",MI7IJHdWfX70XbaofFTo4Q,1,0,4,WVivAvjL0MiuuIpaayX8nA

I've only been to this place once and I think their ramen is okay. It's more on the salty side and it doesn't help that their ramen sauce is also really salty. One of my favorites is the kale pops. I was really disappointed when I found out that they discontinued this product. On my last visit, I tried the crispy chicken, the dynamite, jinya bun, and the tempura brussel sprouts. I really enjoyed their crispy chicken but I had to put a lot of lemon juice because it was a little salty for my comfort. I like the jinya bun's well, bun. It was really soft. The pork inside it was basically all pork fat which I found a little disgusting. I wasn't really a big fan of their tempura. It was okay. Nothing special. Their dynamite though is probably what I'll come back for. It's very rich and I love how much seafood they put in their. Too bad it only comes with a few crackers. It would be better if they put more. That way you're not using a spoon to eat the dip like it's an entree. Customer service wasn't too bad. Got seated in a timely manner and staff was very friendly.

Not only is the food spot on, the venue itself very well decorated with a very hip feel -- nice and dim, good music and just an overall great ambiance! Definitely my pick for a casual date night, and absolutely perfect for rainy days that call for hot soup! 

In terms of the food, I think what sets this place apart is the broth they use. It is full of flavor and rich without being overly salty (which apparently is in large part that they simmer their signature stock for TEN hours!). And aside from the usual pork and chicken broth, they also offer vegetarian. Their noodles are also great, which they age for THREE days to maximize their flavor. 

For her:
- CRISPY CHICKEN TONKOTSU RAMEN (chef's special): Chicken broth, green onions, fried onion, thin noodles (added corn & a seasoned egg -- which is a must!)
- CRISPY CHICKEN: Five perfectly seasoned fried chicken pieces served with a very complimentary sauce (originally $4.95 but can be found on happy hour menu for $3 if you're lucky!)

For him: 
- CHA CHA CHA (for garlic lovers!): Pork & fish broth, pork chiashu, seasoned egg, bean sprouts, chopped onion, green onion, garlic, chili powder, thick noodles. 
- SALMON POKE MINI TACOS: Two of Jinya's original salmon poke in crispy wonton taco shells, with side of cilantro. (can also be found on happy hour menu!)

PRO TIP: ""Kaedama!"" aka get a noodle refill! Still have soup? For $1.60, get a hot, fresh batch of noodles to add in! :)

PRO TIP II: Happy hour menu from 3:00pm-5:00pm, and 10:00pm-12:00am.",cQrnxjgVBhjAcOJttw48aw,4,1,5,6RBhk4ef1wn-RdGwZtLuvA
1214907,2018-01-15,0,gx2yPrOJSwF1ApJYdGBWIw,"Came here for the second time with my parents that were here from out of town. They loved it the first time. So we decided let's have it again! Man did we make a mistake & man oh man did we wait. We had a party of 8 which yes I know it was huge (for this place) we knew we were going to wait no doubt about that 45-min to an hour tops. After about an hour we were told we were next so we headed inside to wait because it was cold. Not a surprise, not much space to wait. We were like sardines huddled near the front door, but hey when we were told we were next we assumed we were going to be seated within what 5 minutes or less maybe? Not the case at all! The host made the mistake of seating a party of 3 right smack dab in the middle of our table which made our wait an extra hour!!!!! Why?!!!!! Why would you seat another party in the middle of our table (you know the only big table in the middle of the room). You could've seated them in one of the 2 empty booths that were available We weren't the only ones that noticed that huge mistake. A couple waiting right next to us said "" wow I can't believe they did that!"" So we stood there inside for an extra hour just dumbfounded. It seriously ruined the mood for us which sucked because we were in such great spirits that day.

When we were finally seated, no I'm sorry about the wait which was our mistake. No we apologize about that. Just seated. The waitress gave us water, asked if we wanted anything else besides water and then took our order. (Which she almost forgot to take orders from 3 others in my party wtf?!! I had to point to them and tell her "" they need to order as well"" We were seated all together are you not paying attention?!) She never came back after taking our order?? 3 other servers/bus boys came to give us our food which is fine I understand, it happens all the time. But NOBODY checked on us, didn't ask how's everything? need a refill? Etc. 

The food was good, no complaints about that! Which is why we came back obviously. Trust me we ate it all up after waiting so damn long! 

NOTE: We still gave them a 20% tip because I would never ever not leave just nothing, that's just not me and it's just rude! But we all left so upset which sucked so bad. I haven't seen my parents in a long time and we wanted to have a good time. My mom told me that this was the last time we were coming here and despite how much I love or should I say loved this place, I would have to agree after last night. This is the last time we're coming here! 

Sorry JINYA. You could've stepped up your game and offered us some type of compensation for our 2 hour wait due to YOUR terrible mistake. (Free sodas? One free appetizer? A little discount off our meal? I don't know the possibilities are endless!) it would've made us feel like you were trying to show some type of apologetic gesture, but we were left with ""a real bad taste in our mouth"". Maybe I'll consider coming back when you guys MAYBE OPEN A BIGGER LOCATION? TRAIN STAFF ON CUSTOMER SERVICE? SHOW YOUR CUSTOMERS YOU ACTUALLY CARE? 

Suggestion to others: Don't even bother coming here if you have a party bigger than 4-6. I'm dead serious. (Unless you enjoy waiting??) Honestly it's just an absolute nightmare. Trust me.",53VqteGh8eANmNAFRzYTLg,0,0,2,8b08axG_opNdvyOsLyjcUA

I tried the Tonkotsu Black ramen and thought it was average. It wasn't bad, but it didn't blow my mind like some of the reviews I've read. Also, for the price, I feel like they should give more as I pretty much ate the whole bowl in a couple big slurps.

They have a wide variety of choices - I've had something different everytime and have enjoyed all of them. I'm very particular about ramen noodles and I have yet to be disappointed by the handmade noodles here. The firmness is good, never soggy, and the ramen is rarely left on the counter to cool and served as soon as they are done (ramen noodles have a time limit!!) 

Gyoza is a must have accompaniment when it comes to ramen and the gyoza here is also quite good. Crispy outside, juicy meat filling. 

This time around I had the chicken ramen - a very 'assari' flavor (light broth) and the chicken chashu is very tender. I really liked the Tokyo style chicken ramen but they unfortunately removed it with the new menu. 

I didn't have the panna cotta this time around but I've had it a couple times in the past. The dessert itself is not super outstanding, but the cookie cubes that accompany the panna cotta adds a great contrast that I enjoy. If you have room after your meal I'd say it's worth trying!

I finally found a decent ramen spot in Vegas!
That's what's up!!
They have a variety of soup base flavors and a good selection of add ons. 

What is going on?! I had the tonkotsu assari with extra sprouts and bok choy. This soup is hitting the spot and helping my tummy ache.
And the pork chashu bowl is MmmmMmm good. Washed it down with some hot tea and I'm good to go.

I asked for the spiciest chicken ramen and it definitely could have used a better kick. Real spicy ramen for me at least makes me break into a little sweat but this one did nothing. 

Now, I'm giving it 4 stars because it was tasty, it just wasn't traditional or what I preferred when it comes to ramen. I ordered the gyoza too which was also delicious and it came with a salad. The dressing was definitely an acquired taste. I loved it but I don't think it's for everyone. 

I went during happy hour which surprisingly was from 10pm to 12am on a Sunday. Half price on beer and wine and most of the appetizers. Plus they're open til 3am which is fucking awesome cuz I'm a night owl and it's Vegas so why not?! We got there at the perfect time. No wait. When I left the wait line was well out the door. Call ahead to try and avoid huge delays in seating. 

I also tried the shrimp balls which were super good. I've never had anything like those before. They were deep fried, crunchy on the outside and soft and delicious in the inside. I ordered a bun and they forgot to bring it out. I had to remind them about it right in the end and I couldn't really eat it cuz I was full from all the ramen, so that sucked. 

Oh they don't carry Asahi in a bottle or on draft, which is my favorite beer, so I substituted with Sapporo on draft and it was just ok. I don't hate Sapporo but I always pair my ramen with Asahi.",yPCWGUCn3dUz4ANca6Clvg,0,0,4,y0q0YO77no-8sl-J5yjJHg

1340291,2014-07-28,4,gx2yPrOJSwF1ApJYdGBWIw,"There's a new ramen restaurant in town and this is not just another ordinary ramen place capitalizing on the new ramen craze in Vegas like many other ramen places popping up around town. This ramen can actually compete with the big names like the Montas or the Soras. So be afraid...Monta, be very afraid...Sora, you finally got some real competition.
 The menu is very extensive, you can actually have a complete meal here without having ramen, but since ramen was the reason I was here, that's exactly what I ordered. I went with their most popular which is the tonkotsu black, a very rich in flavor broth with pork chashu and the perfect toppings, fresh onions, fried onions, garlic, nori and a boiled egg and served with perfectly cooked thin noodles.
 I had to try the pork broth this time for comparison purposes but on my next visit I'll provably be nicer to my heart and order the chicken broth instead or even the vegetable soup ramen and I hope they're as good as the pork so I can stop here more often without the guilty feeling. 
Service was great, I had no problems with my drink being refilled as needed and my waitress was very helpful explaining the menu and making recommendations. 
The dining room is very spacious with many booths and tables, a bar facing the open kitchen and a majestic communal table in the middle inviting strangers to become friends by the power of ramen if only for just one meal.

1372358,2017-02-20,1,gx2yPrOJSwF1ApJYdGBWIw,"It was a rainy day in Vegas & I knew I needed ramen stat. JINYA had been chillin' in my bookmarks for a while now so I thought it was time to give it a try. I wasn't surprised to see a lot of people waiting outside & inside the restaurant. It's a quaint place so there wasn't really a designated waiting area or chairs at all. The set up of the restaurant is pretty unique. A counter facing the kitchen, tables on all sides of the restaurant & then a massive rectangular wooden table surrounded by stools is in the center of the restaurant. Heads up for large parties-- this is the only place you really can sit at so don't expect to eat facing each other, you'll most likely be sitting side by side & there will probably be a longer wait to accommodate you, although turnaround is quite fast since it's ramen.

Anyway, onto the customer service. It was a really busy night so I pretty much people-watched while we waited for our table. Hostesses were so-so. Not exactly chipper but not entirely rude either. It also wasn't clear who's who. Servers sat people, hostesses took orders. However, it was as organized as it could get for a packed house. Our server Rachel was really sweet. She handled orders for the whole big rectangular table with ease. 

Lastly, the food was yummy! I ordered the Premium Tonkotsu White & the fiance had the Chef's Special Tokyo Tonkotsu Ramen. There wasn't much of a difference between ours except for the supposed spicy sauce on mine and fish powder on his. The pork chasu freaking melts in your mouth. MMMM. The taste of the broth was pretty identical for us. One complaint is our ramens were not as hot as we would have wanted. Even with us moving the toppings quickly, the broth was only warm. Also, of course I agree with everyone here. Takoyaki is BOMB & the egg salad at the bottom is just icing on the cake.

Prices are a tad higher than other ramen bars in town but that's what you get for eating at a super hip ramen bar right? All in all, I'm sure I'll be back. Vegas just needs to stay colder for a little bit more. :)",Nbr4DYLPxURjxelLVTSt8A,0,3,4,okrRKszROytaqW54W0oZMg

1404209,2014-08-31,11,gx2yPrOJSwF1ApJYdGBWIw,"Hmm, where do I put Jinya... That's the million dollar question. But after careful consideration, I believe 4 stars is accurate.
This is probably my toughest place to review, so bear with me...

First time I was here, I ordered the tonkatsu assuri, their cheapest ramen at 7.90. I thought the flavor was ok, but it didn't blow me away. My friend ordered a veggie ramen, he said that he liked it a lot, but I thought that was ok.

I came next during their HH and sampled the world renowned Jinya bun and crispy chicken, aka karage. Things were starting to look up!! The Jinya bun is a pork belly bao, and probably ranks up there with Wendy's ribeye bao. It's grilled with a delicate BBQ sauce, and it is extremely tender, and the fat is nice and melty. It's a little pricy at 3.00 during HH. The karage is a great deal during HH. This isn't your normal, popcorn chicken sized crispy chicken. These are 5 large hunks of chicken, that are super crispy and moist!! So good! I do have regrets of not ordering the quinoa salad that a neighboring table ordered, it looked very appetizing.

On my last visit, I was feeling full from a late lunch so I decided to get something small so I ordered the small pork chashu bowl. The best part of this bowl was the rice, it was perfectly cooked. I was disappointed in the pork chashu. It looked like the leftover bits from the Jinya bun meat. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't that great, there wasn't a lot of fat on it, but it wasn't dry. Overall, I thought it was kinda bland.

The service here is really good. They really do a good job of taking care of you. The ambiance is really great, especially the large communal table in the center. I don't know if this would be my go to ramen spot, especially with so many unique ramen spots in town, but it has a great vibe and would be a fun hangout spot with friends.",gtwM4ijo65AN4DvXdgCu_w,17,15,4,DGoUvaPAVz82D-ZclzL34g

During our quest to hunt down ramen in Vegas, we found JINYA in strip mall on Flamingo Rd, which was a little different since I was once told all the ramen places are on Spring Mtn Rd in Vegas.  It was not too busy when we went in the afternoon, and the place was quite big.

We started with some Fresh Tofu and it took a while to prepare, but it was totally worth it, since it came out quite awesome from tofu liquid and turned into solid within seconds, and you can customize the flavor you want with different amount of toppings and sauce.  The Dynamite was ok, a little too heavy on the Americanized flavors for my taste.

The Jinya Black Ramen was surprisingly delicious, it had a nice balance with the broth, meat was tender, noodles were cooked al dente, and egg was perfect soft boiled, not quite an onsen tamago.  We ended our meal with some Green Tea Mochis that were just regular mocha, and the Tofu Almond Dessert, which was very nice and refreshing.

I am surprised to found out this to be a chain later, and they definitely kept up the quality at this location.  The menu was big enough for me to return here again in the future.

So, service today was pretty good. It's was a little busy, but warm and the servers worked hard.

Now to the food. This ramen is good for a very biased and specific reason; Brussel sprouts. Before I continue to my favorite part, though, we had the Brussels sprout appetizer, the chicken bun, and the creamy tempura. The sprouts were lightly salted and super crunchy, so good. The chicken bun had an awesome sweetness and creaminess as well as a great texture. Every bite, you're met with the crunchiness of the outside of the chicken and the juicy, tenderness on the inside. The tempura was very good. The fidelity of the crunchiness was not compromised by the sauce. It wasn't soggy or hard. It was just right. 

Now to my favorite part, the ramen. You're met with the usual umami: heavy pork flavor and al dente noodles. This ramen is excellent due to one thing: Brussel sprouts. The deep fried sprouts not only add texture, but the lightness and the bitterness of the sprouts refresh your palate. This is a ramen you can eat without getting fatigued. Get brussel sprouts!!!

Lastly I ordered the block bar. It's sweet lol.

JINYA FEATURES THE BEST RAMEN I HAVE HAD IN LAS VEGAS!!!  

We arrived at 6:00 on a Wednesday night and were seated right away.  The server made helpful suggestions, and our ramen came out extremely quickly - perfect because we were in a rush.

I had the Tonkotsu Black and it was perfect!  The broth was very hearty and flavorful.  Additionally, you can add ""ramen seasoning,"" which is in a bottle on the table to make it even tastier!  It also comes with the infamous soft-boiled egg that was cooked to perfection.  The noodles were relatively thin for ramen and soft, but it was delicious.  The chashu pork was also great!  The price was also very reasonable.

I also ordered the Jinya Bun as an appetizer and it was delicious and a little fatty (which I love, but understand it is not everyone's favorite).  This is where the service was a little weird because they forgot to bring our appetizer before the ramen and after we mentioned it to the server, she still forgot to bring it out.

Takoyaki: Jinya did an excellent job on the octopus pancake balls. The octopus wasn't chewy or rubbery. The sauces and garnishes was just as good and I love the chunks of eggs incorporated into the Japanese mayonnaise sauce. 

Tonkotsu Black Ramen: the broth was extremely thick with the thin noodles being cooked just right. The chasu was delicate and the soft boiled egg oozed as you bite into it. The overall ramen was great; however, they should really kick it up a notch with the garlic flavors which was missing in the broth considering the garlic chips and garlic oil didn't do much justice. 

Service: the best service I received from Vegas overall. My waitress was super attentive and nothing but smiles throughout the evening. I made an order for ramen without green onions and before placing my order to the chef, she went back and asked to make sure that I didn't want green onions in my takoyaki as well. She went the extra mile to make sure I got my food to exactly how I liked.

Seating: compared to Monta Ramen where you're cramped into a tiny space, there was more spacious seating. Also the restaurant itself was much more cleaner and attractive.",-pzlhxN6-DtuvpX4blnTxw,6,8,5,ndkJ1YTF30Wl5qXtiH1xFw

1480093,2018-04-05,0,gx2yPrOJSwF1ApJYdGBWIw,"Been to 5 ramen places here in Vegas and by far, this has the best tasting ramen in the valley. Believe the hype. 

This is not a traditional ramen place by any means but I think that's a good thing. Their broth is spectacular. I ordered the Black Tonkatsu Ramen and it had an excellent balance of tasty and smooth. Everything else in the ramen was balanced perfectly. You can really tell (taste) the craft behind the dish.

Be wary though as this place will probably always have a long waiting line. Good sign of great food, bad if you're impatient. The place has a big center table that I think they can get rid off to make space for more chairs. It is a bit stuffy on the inside but you came for the ramen, not to chill. 

If you don't like to wait, I see them do ""to-go"" orders. Lifehack.

I would go so far as to say that Jinya rivals that of Monta but I know most others don't agree. The reason I would say it does is because of the Black Tonkotsu ramen. The broth has such a deep deep flavor of pork and is so very rich. Makes me drool just thinking about it. If you don't enjoy the porky flavor as much then I recommend the Jinya chicken ramen. Its half chicken and half pork broth. The chicken broth really lightens the porky flavor but also compliments it. Skinny noodles were good, similar to Monta.

The chashu pork is thick but delicate with melt-in-your-mouth fat. Even their chicken bowls have chicken ""chashu"" that isn't that differentiated from the pork variety (meaning it's just as delicious even without the melt-in-your-mouth fat).

JINYA offers pretty awesome appetizers and tapas (takoyaki, anyone?). The karaage is always a necessary order as well. I have paid the price of a burnt tongue many times just to consume these succulent pieces of fried chicken. But, what's really killer is their brussels sprouts tempura. Although already a lover of those mini cabbages, the thin, crunchy, and slightly salted tempura version is even better. Wish each order came with more because they are addicting.

Didn't get any apps to start with, just wanted to get straight to the ramen. 
A friend that I was with had the spicy chicken ramen and I had the cha cha cha ramen.

The cha cha cha ramen is 'for garlic lovers'. I love garlic. So much. And although I thought there was garlic flavour in the actual ramen bowl, our server had given me a garlic press and a small container with fresh garlic. Totally fine with that. 
The ramen was very flavourful and the broth was fantastic. It was well seasoned and the pork chashu was very tender. I loved the chewiness of the thick noodles. 
My friend's spicy chicken ramen was the right amount of spicy for her, she liked it a lot. It was only her second time having ramen and this was definitely a good example of what a bowl of ramen should be. 

Our server was friendly and the ramen was great. I will definitely be back soon to try out more things on the menu!",MzIzsHa1kssFkviGufm-dw,2,1,4,1U39c3wJ7Am3rpnTcMPU5Q
1645702,2014-07-26,7,gx2yPrOJSwF1ApJYdGBWIw,"For a former fast-food restaurant, this place has completely transformed to be a new player in the Vegas ramen wars. Exterior is all black, interior is swanky and looks like a lounge. Very welcoming, very clean. Menu is fairly extensive with a few different types of ramens, a handful of sides, add-ons, tapas options, and a few desserts.

JINYA BUN is $3 (~$4 regular) on HH menu- chashu on a bao, simple, classic, flavorful, and delicious. The tempura BRUSSELS SPROUTS were crispy and fresh with a touch of truffle oil that didn't overwhelm but added an extra savory note.
CRISPY RICE WITH SPICY TUNA is a favorite dish of mine: I'm not a jalapeno fan but the thin slices are the perfect complement to the tuna and rice, which is perfectly crisp and never burned.
CRISPY CHICKEN is super-moist and flavorful, plated with a small salad with their fabulous dressing and a delightful dipping sauce.

RAMENS:
TONKOTSU ASSARI- pork broth, chashu, karagge, green onion, seasoned egg, spicy bean sprouts, and thick noodles: delish! Broth had good depth of flavor without feeling too fatty (server described it as one of their lighter options), noodles were chewy and the egg was just slightly overcooked.
[2nd visit] TOKOTSU BLACK- pork broth, pork chashu, kikurage, green onion, nori, egg, garlic chips, garlic oil, fried onion, and THIN noodles: full bodied broth, but highly preferred the thicker noodles, the thin ones are too similar to spaghetti IMO.
[Millionth Visit] SPICY CHICKEN TONKOTSU: amazing noodles with a spicy broth and ground chicken. No egg. Reminiscent of a lighter version of Sora's spicy ramen bowl but without the heavy grease of Fukumimu's tan tan men.

Very pleased with food and service- so much so that I went two days in  row.
 Affordable pricing (see receipts in pics). Management visible throughout my visits, interacting with visitors. If this is any indication of an average visit here, they'll have a huge following with a waitlist very soon.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,16,10,4,fx68CqJi1TpEK-ZyxK8WFg

I got the garlic ramen (it has a name but I can't remember- cha cha?). They give an immense amount of bean sprouts, but I easily took a little out before mixing everything together. I absolutely love soft-boiled egg in my ramen, so I got extra :) the yolk was perfect. I guess this certain soup usually comes with thick noodles but they were out, so it came with thin.

Now I understand that good things take time and my group didn't mind waiting. However, when we finally got to a position in line where we had a view of the restaurant, there were about a dozen seats available! Mind you we had been waiting for an hour so seeing open seats was pretty annoying. It was puzzling why an establishment wouldn't at least let their patrons have a seat and get something to drink... This especially confuses me when more and more people rolled in after us, were seated immediately and the place ensued to fill up.. oh well.

When the hostess came up and called our party's name we all smiled and nodded. The hostess looked super confused, rolled her eyes and nodded a slow demeaning ""YEESS?"". 
Um, yeah? Dang I'm sorry we didn't verbalize it but you don't have to be rude. 

On the plus side, our server was good and deserves a little gold star! Very attentive, knowledgeable and sweet. 

The food I had was no good. My vegan ramen broth was cold and flavorless and the noodles were thick and super chewy. Not a fan. It also gave me a pretty painful stomach ache for the drive home. 

My friend got this chicken appetizer that was undercooked. When he brought this issue to a waiters attention they were like ""oh they're supposed to be like that because if they cooked longer the outside would burn."" ...Haha gross. 

When we got the checks we gave 2 cards and they split it for us. The same hostess with the eye rolls came back and held the 2 CLOSED bill books up without saying a word. Like how are we supposed to know which one is which? Before we could even say anything she rolls her eyes, tosses them to the table, and mouths a long ""oookaaay"". 
Why so much attitude?! And why so many eye rolls? What happened to customer service?

The only thing that makes this place slightly worse is their bowl is more expensive by a dollar or so. However, this place definitely has the flavor to match that of Monta. I ordered their spicy tonkotsu ramen with their flavored egg (which is a soft boiled egg) and I was very satisfied with what I got. Their broth is very rich and flavorful I didn't even need to season it at all. The only thing I found a bit weird was that the tonkotsu ramen was served with thick noodles rather than the traditional thin noodles (which they serve anyways.) I'll probably order the same thing with thin noodles next time. 

Service was also great here, I'd say better than Monta. I came here with my large family which included a small child. My niece had the kid's meal which was a fried rice with fried chicken and also had a pudding dessert with a strawberry puree. The waitress noticed that my niece really enjoyed the strawberry and offered to give her some more. Our table was checked on frequently enough to feel hospitable but not too much that it was bothersome.

In my opinion, Jinya is a nicer restaurant where I would go on a date, where Monta is more touristy and casual. So depending on what you're in the mood for pick accordingly.",P0Zd9BjnCgbfzsHiQFdhoA,2,0,5,XlmoAYWgBLZSCZDSI6ezUg

I don't think the noodles are home made,  but they still taste good.  The chef chicken special was hard to eat.  Chicken pieces so big I really wanted a knife and fork to cut them up.

We accidentally stumbled upon this place, in fact almost drove by because it was dark and looked closed.  It was 1:30am so we didn't really think the place was actually open.   But then again this was Las Vegas, why wouldn't it be?

First impression, dark like a bar, in fact if I didn't see the ramen on the other tables, I would have easily thought this place was a bar.  The music was similar to what you'd find in a bar scene.  Loud,  Really loud and annoying.  One of the owners just happen to be there, young guy, who just happened to originally be from Hawaii.  I thought I'd compliment him on the ramen flavor and at the same time ask him to turn down the music so we could hear each talk and have a conversation.  It was also really cold in the restaurant, perhaps time of the morning and lack of bodies in the place had something to do with that.

After our eyes got adjusted to the dark atmosphere and loud music, we focused in on the ramen.  Thin noodles, rich tonkatsu broth (that you know took days pto produce), the wonderful garlic flavors and the perfectly cooked egg.  The atmosphere, not too desirable, but the food was so amazingly delicious!
It was as good, if not better than, authentic ramen from Japan.  The menu is perfect for picky eaters, who can order their noodles thick or thin, and customize their dish with a number of add-ons.   The most incredible thing was the spicy sauce, photo enclosed of the chefs creation.

Stopped in the restroom prior to leaving, very clean, toilets were the fancy Japanese high end ones that you find in 5 star, Tokyo hotels.  To me, restrooms are a good measure on how to gauge how much a restaurant cares.

1787344,2017-01-04,1,gx2yPrOJSwF1ApJYdGBWIw,"After a crazy night in Vegas, I really needed a bowl of ramen. My friends spoke highly of Jinya, so that's where I decided to go. I waited about 20-30 minutes for a table for 2 on Sunday at around 1pm. 

I went with my friends recommendation and ordered the Sprouting Up Ramen. However, I made the mistake of replacing the pork chashu with pork soboro. The pork soboro is really well seasoned and would taste great with rice because it's on the salty end. However, adding the soboro to an already salty ramen made my broth extremely salty. The brussel sprouts were unique and cooked well, but I think I'm definitely more of a tradition ramen fan. 

We also ordered the takoyaki, which was well worth the $6. The appetizer comes with 6 octopus balls on a bed of crushed hard boiled eggs covered with japanese mayo, sauce, green onions, and bonito flakes. The takoyaki was delicious and I would come back to Jinya just to eat them again.",-EcEGpHwo_OVcRsSc0RURw,1,0,4,4c1efSAxpdRtd2HZ3NnQGw

1820299,2016-04-30,6,gx2yPrOJSwF1ApJYdGBWIw,"So I've eaten here on a number of occasions, and I can't say I hate nor can I say I love it.. but there are a number of reasons why this Ramen spot is getting a solid 3 stars from me.. food is good but not mind blowing, and it's kinda over priced in my honest opinion, servers here are hit or miss like they're either really nice and on top of it, or really spaced out and not all too together and there. 

I come here mostly when friends want to eat here as a group or whatnot, and my boyfriend and I came here together once so he could try it out (he wasn't so much a fan) I think the inconsistency in their service is one of the main dampers to this place.. one time the server was coming around to a group of mine collecting plates and bowls that were finished and my friend next to me wasn't quite down with her ramen and instead of asking and waiting for a response, she asked, ""are you finished?"" while she basically grabbed the bowl but she grabbed it in a way that she placed her thumb in the inside rim of my friend's ramen bowl.. umm unsanitary and gross dude seriously.. ask and then wait before you go sticking your fingers in other people's ramen bowls.. geez lol 

The ramen is solid good, but I always tend to get the chicken ramen and never really venture off to anything different unless its the appetizers options... but if i'm coming here for ramen, I always get the same ramen lol  I wanna definitely try their drive thru.. which to me is kinda mind blowing awesome that they even have a drive thru but I wonder how quick and efficient that is.. ramen in drive thru 

but my boyfriend felt his broth was a bit too salty, but again a little over priced for less traditional ramen spot, wait on the weekends or rainy days are especially long and there's no real waiting area. 

I do have to say the female's restroom is kick ass toilet seat! I'm assuming its from Japan, but it's definitely one of those high tech toilet/bidet combinations. but the seat is heated and it sanitizes the seat with a spray when the automatic sensor is activated to lift the seat cover. most high tech throne I've ever sat on. lol 

They do have a small bar area to sit on.. only seats up to 4 guest at the bar. They have a large community table that seats about 25 people, then lining the establishments are booth sittings that fit either 2 - 6 guest depending on the booth. 

They offer a lot of side add on items but each item add on is usually additional $1.00 if your ramen is $10.95 then you add poached egg, extra spinach, corn, etc etc you just added additional $3 making your Ramen $14.. idk to me it just comes out a little bit pricier than other spots I've been to.. the serving size is average; nothing large like a large bowl of pho, but its not small either. Tends to be usually be just right, but I'm a huge soup over noodles fan.. so I tend to always finish my soup first and still looking for more when I'm finishing the noodles. 

Again the ambiance of the place if definitely more modern than traditional, but their menu is pretty straight to the point with not too much fusion options which makes choosing pretty simple. I do like that they have a half off certain appetizers Happy Hour 10p-12am, but I just don't like how if you order appetizers, your tapas tend to come out after the Ramen, especially if you order the Dynamite tapas. That one is actually really good and comes with 4 small toasted baguette slices to place the dynamite mixture on and its very tasty and not too creamy, like its not swimming in cream cheese which I like. but i prefer my appetizer as an appetizer before the main meal.. just saying. 

Again, I have mixed feeling about this place like some days I'm into it and most I'm like ehh.. but really can't go wrong with Ramen in cold or rainy weather and this is relatively close to my house so nothing mind blowing here but solid good ramen, but not my top spot.",nRdfX_I0CaOq7lJunJMPpA,10,8,3,tcr7zrJmrnpZObbL8VfeoA

They have a small menu that I wish was bigger because everything they offer taste good, but I understand they kept it small to help the food get out faster. They seem to make up for it by letting you customize everything (example size of noodles). I recommend the house Ramon and Japanese style fried chicken with an extra side of lemon.

We ordered the gyoza for an appetizer. They had good flavor and taste but all 6 pieces were stuck together.

I had the chicken ramen and my girlfriend had the spicy chicken ramen. Only additional item I added to my bowl was extra noodles. She didn't add anything extra. The bowls the ramen come in are huge lots of broth and good proportions. Add in extra noodles and you have yourself a really big meal!  The whole thing was excellent.

Huge wait out there but we quickly realized how worth it was. For me, vegetarian ramen speaks for itself. I thought this was going to be a one time ordeal falling in love while on vacation and having to wait years before eating it again..... then Jinya Vegas was before my eyes shortly after I moved here. Life made!

I had the spicy creamy vegan ramen then and I came to the Vegas location with high hopes for it to knock my socks off again. It did just that! I added a soft boiled egg and mushrooms to my ramen and we shared edamame on the side. We all got ramune which has become my guilty pleasure. 

Our server was super helpful in explaining the menu to my girlfriends who were there for the first time. She noted which of the condiments were vegetarian since a friend and I are vegetarian. I suck at eating ramen in the sense that I eat all the broth before i get to my noodles so she even offered me extra broth to go and I was able to make two servings of my one bowl of ramen. 

Ambiance is hipster-esque. We were seated at the high top. Not my preference but was ready to eat! It's not insanely large which explains the wait. Parking is a bit of a struggle but there's a large strip mall behind the establishment. 

The wait is the only inconvenience, but if that tells you anything... it's that good! No reservations, no calls. Will absolutely be frequenting it time and time again.",WOlBelW_IzsKOyizelNKCw,1,2,5,tDjBhP_CyZKWj3_uGVuVuw

We walked in and the design is so pretty! There was no wait so we were seated right away and at once all of their staff greeted us (super awesome!!). They greet each guest that arrives and it just kicks off a great first impression. 

We opted for the Takoyaki as an appetizer, which is a popular Japanese dish made of octopus balls with bonito flakes (fish flakes that move!!) I've seen this dish in maybe 3 other restaurant I've ever gone to and this was finally my chance to try it. We enjoyed it, but felt like something was missing. Still a good experience tho!!

For our bowls I got the JINYA Tonkatsu Black Ramen and I added corn and fresh garlic to it. It came with thin noodles and I kinda regret that I didn't request for thick noodles.. I feel like I might've enjoyed the thick noodles better. The broth was not as rich as I anticipated for. I've had richer broth before - this just had something missing. I had to then add extra sauce and seasoning to it to reach my liking. Nonetheless I did end up enjoying my bowl and it filled me up super quick I had to make my BF finish the rest for me!

1941767,2017-08-15,0,gx2yPrOJSwF1ApJYdGBWIw,"Jinya has THE BEST Vegan Ramen in Vegas. Honestly it may be the best vegan/vegetarian ramen period. Other ramen bars like Manta only offer chicken or pork based broth, but not here. 

I take out of town guests here when visiting as i can rely on it to always be a crowd pleaser. Most recently I took my cousin and a friend here this past Saturday for lunch. They said it was the best ramen they've ever had. 

One tip is to come here early. The restaurant is tiny with only 7-8 ""four tops"", 3 ""two tops"", and a bar for four surrounding a large communal table so the waitlist can tick up fast. We got here right at 11:30AM when the doors opened for lunch. There were already four other groups waiting ahead of us. So come early. I'd say this place is perfect for groups of four our less unless you don't mind splitting up due to the limited amount of tables and the usually long wait times during peak hours. I've sat at the communal table a few times with larger groups but it can sometimes be awkward for me. 

I order the Spicy Creamy Vegan Ramen with garlic and mild spice. This bowl is served with thick noodles, a creamy broth, with fried garlic chips and a drizzle of garlic oil and chili oil. They bring whole pealed garlic cloves and a garlic press to the table to smash the garlic right into the ramen. This is my favorite bowl for sure. The other ramen bowl they offer which is also very good is the Vegetable Soup Ramen which is served with a clear broth and thin buckwheat noodles. 

My friend and cousin ordered the Spicy Chicken Ramen and both thought it was so so good. As I mentioned earlier, one said it was the best she's ever had.

(Warning: Young adults from Central Florida in for vacation) Besides offering us some of the best tasting cuisine during our visit- awesome prices as well- the large soups delivered are also visually delicious. No add-ins needed. This visual presentation had a drawback- our Takoyaki arrived doused in sauces and flakes. Visually very appealing however I don't like my dishes drowning and overwhelmed in sauce.

DELICIOUS AND COMFORTING RAMEN
Oh how complicated yet delicious my Jinya Tonkotsu Black was! It wasn't too oily or salty. Splashes of boiling garlic oil and dabs of hot sauce allowed for various flavors to suddenly creep up in the middle of eating. The Cha Cha Cha was very garlicky but still approachable. Both contained generous amounts of soft pork, crunchy vegetables, seasoned & soft egg. All the toppings made every bite slightly different. 

WELCOMING AND CASUAL RESTAURANT
Two large tables at the center allow for big groups and community-style seating (although there's also other areas for 6-tops.) Other seats allow a great view into the kitchen. It doesn't seem very large inside- perhaps because every seat was taken during our Friday lunch- yet the look was comfy because of all the wood decor mixed in with black and red colors.",nlQGyti20c07rpTSYYoNZQ,2,2,4,hTkoe2s0QjQrkuWC6VEVyw

2077482,2015-01-06,7,gx2yPrOJSwF1ApJYdGBWIw,"Up until last week, the only ramen I ever had was the kind in a cup. I was in the mood for soup last week and decided to hit up Jinya as its right down the street from work. I went in and there were a lot of people waiting. The dining room is pretty small. I asked how long the wait was but the hostess had no idea. I only get an hour lunch break so I had to leave. I am not sure if they take reservations, I think it is first come first serve, so be advised.  

I decided to go back a few days later and luckily there was no wait. I sat at the big family sized table right in the middle of the restaurant. This table seats at least 20 people, so if you don't mind eating in front of strangers then you are good to go.  They do have a few smaller tables that border the large table, but they were all full. 

Anyways I sat down and was given a menu. I already knew what I wanted, and that was the Tonkotsu Assari. It took a good 25 minutes to come out. When it finally came out I slurped myself into a ramen oblivion. It was very good and filling. Unfortunately this type of meal has loads and loads of sodium, so it is probably best to just have occasionally. It is tempting to go everyday when the weather is cold though! The service was good and the waitress was nice. Packaged ramen you can suck it! There is a new sheriff in town.

1st of all, 3-5PM is the Happy Hour Special and the prices are great, especially if you want to sample a few appetizers for only 2 bucks apiece!

The atmosphere is open, rustic, and comfortable. The music playing throughout our meal was outstanding. If you like The Paper Kites (look them up on iTunes), then you'll enjoy all the music. We did!

Service? Outstanding! Very friendly and helpful to make the right choices. And very accommodating when we needed 'to go' bags, bowls, etc.

The food? 10/10! The pork bun was tender and very flavorful. Yummy for the tummy.

We decided to share the Tonkotsu Black Ramen bowl, based on our waiter's suggestion. Again, a perfect choice and very flavorful!

Lastly, I can't wait to go back! The only downside was the location. Not in the best of neighborhoods and about a mile or so off the Strip. We walked from The Palms and it was okay. It is worth taking a cab though, because the food is great!",lBIbRTRURdeUMUW4CTj8iw,1,1,5,dokyj_3mVESOwlKTbgO8mw

I always get the Tonkatsu Black with a Jinya Bun. EVERYONE should try the Jinya Bun. It will change your life -- savory pork belly that melts in your mouth, a mayo-like sauce, with small slices of cucumbers and some greens on a fluffy white bun. My mouth is watering just thinking about it.

Ramen broth is not too salty. It's actually very flavorful and not too overpowering. I used to be a die-hard thick noodles kinda gal. But Jinya made me appreciate thin noodles which I now love!

While this place isn't the best ramen I've had in town, (shout out to ramen sora) it is hands down the second best I have had.  The menu is definitely larger than ramen sora and seems a lot more hip in that there are different appetizer combinations and items to try like tacos.  The place itself is in an old fast food building which seemed odd at first but is really nicely decorated inside and was very welcoming!  Every time I have been here there has been a line out the door so that shows that it is definitely doing something right.  They have their ramens that you can get but there is a so a high level of customization that you can do to make it how you like, although everything is a la carte (not expensive though).  Too me the broth seemed a lot thicker than other places I have been to, almost like a gravy, which isn't a bad thing by far, just different.  I do like how you can make a combo meal though with a salad, rice bowl of some type, and your ramen.  Oh and ramen only comes in one size although you can add fresh noodles to your broth during the meal!",alr2xk5KBJXHd6zVuEqdDg,1,1,4,_gMQ6REGWQ8i6AmfWkjDig

We ordered the shrimp balls and tempura brussle sprouts appetizers. The shrimp balls were very tasty. The Brussel sprouts were okay, I wish they came with a dipping sauce as they were kinda missing something.

I ordered the spicy chicken ramen, with flavored egg. It was delicious. I would have to say it was the best ramen I have ever had. I ordered it the hottest it comes, and it only made my eyes run but it wasn't too hot for me. 

My fiance ordered the pork cha cha cha, she enjoyed it, she didn't finish because the portions was a bit much for her. The broth seemed a bit thicker, but still delicious.

This is a very good ramen stop. Thr hard wood benches were a bit uncomfortable. I did notice a drive thru but I'm not entirely sure if it's functional. I would recommend trying this place out!",pA9NXgASl86RImkdBtydrA,1,1,4,D4MNN_Ks9LZx5NHMEmks9Q

2167106,2016-12-01,1,gx2yPrOJSwF1ApJYdGBWIw,"The ramen broth here is excellent! 
Their menu offers many different broth and spice combinations to highlight all their flavors; it's not just a broth with however many sides you want to throw in. 

Their tonkotsu broth is SUPER thick which shows how much fat and flavor the chefs were able to cook into the broth. My favorite variation was the tonkotsu black which is the basic broth topped with a black garlic oil and some chili paste. The tonkotsu white is a mix of tonkotsu broth and chicken broth. It's much soupier with a lighter (but still amazing) flavor. There is seriously so much to choose from, so their ramen soups can satisfy anyone's palette. 

My must have is the takoyaki. It has such a creamy texture on the inside and they are generous with the octopus. Most other takoyaki that I've tried have a strong artificial ginger flavor in their sauce. This stuff tasted like the real deal! The ginger flavor here was subtle and exactly what I want when enjoying takoyaki. Instead of covering the takoyaki with Japanese mayonnaise, the balls are placed on a bed of egg salad. It was such an interesting combination. It added to the creaminess and I found myself eating every last bite of the salad.  

The wait here can be long but it's well worth it! This place is good to go solo. They have a bar and a huge community table so dining alone will get you to a table much quicker.

2178488,2014-07-27,4,gx2yPrOJSwF1ApJYdGBWIw,"The Skinny: although not the best ramen I've ever had, this might be the best bowl of tonkotsu ramen in the Las Vegas area so far. That being said, I'd skip the spicy chicken ramen. The truffled brussel sprouts are brilliant (3.5) service: prompt and helpful (4) value: a bit pricier than its counterparts, it's definitely worth a trip (4 starred review).

We were stalking Jinya on Facebook to check for its grand opening - eager to find a decent ramen joint in town. We managed to come in on the second day of opening. It was so good, we dropped by the next day with a pal to take in their happy hour specials.

First, the ambience. I think the tendency for this joint is to turn up the tunes - loud. Although their music selection is good (MJ is classic), I kind of prefer not having to shout across the table to the hubs. Luckily the manager is accomodating and turned it down a notch for the comfort of my tympanic membranes. The decor is comfortable - lots of open spaces with variable methods of seating. Bathrooms are nice and clean - the women's bathroom even sports a real Japanese toilet with heated seat, bidet, and butt dryer.

Service is prompt and friendly while our water glasses were never left unfilled. 

On to the food.

In our two visits we were able to try multiple items: 

Tonkotsu Black Ramen ($10.55): the broth: overall, not bad. There is some porky depth to their broth which as appealing and the flavor wasn't too muddled with other things. On a broth scale, they'd get a 3.5/5. The noodles are the thin traditional hakata style tonkotsu noodles which gets extra bonus points. These were cooked well and had a nice bite to it (4/5). The toppings: the chasu had a nice soy flavor to it, and melted in your mouth. The egg was a tad overcooked for my tastes (I like it a little more runny) but again marinated well (4/5). In terms of tonkotsu ramen, I'd say this is a 3.5/5 on a ramen scale which would put it decidedly as one of the best bowls of ramen we've had in the Las Vegas Area. I think this is first joint in Las Vegas where we'd ever finish all the broth.

Spicy Chicken Ramen ($9.55): their number two most popular ramen. The broth: although the broth had a nice thickness to it, it just didn't have enough chicken flavor. On a broth scale, it was about a 2/5. The noodles were the typical curly thicker noodles which were done well 4/5. The toppings: the chicken chasu was tough and didn't melt in your mouth like the pork chasu. Served with bean sprouts, green onion and spinach, the toppings here didn't wow me (2/5). This ramen bowl would get a 2/5 and I wouldn't recommend it.

Brussel Sprout tempura with truffle oil and salt ($5.80): this is the only time I've ever seen the hubs voluntarily gobble down brussel sprouts. The batter was crisp, light with just the right amount of salt.. When combined with the truffle oil, the flavors worked really well together. A must try item!

Tako-yaki ($4.80): served on a bed of egg salad, this rendition of tako-yaki was good with nice flavor. The filling was light without the being too gummy. It could be a bit crispier on the outside but otherwise a good decent dish with a very healthy serving size for the price.

Happy Hour Special items include Jinya bun ($3), Crispy chicken ($3/5 pcs), Jinya Quinoa Salad ($3), Edamame ($2), Marinated Spinach ($2), Baby Leaf Salad ($2), An-Nin Tofu (sweet almond tofu with fruit, $2). 

Jinya bun ($3): this is a steamed bun with a slice of pork belly with some lettuce, cucumber and a drizzle of sweet soy sauce marinade. The bun was steamed perfectly and had that perfect texture. The ratio of meat/bun was good. The pork belly melts in your mouth although it was a little fatty. The time we had it, I think it was a tad sweet but otherwise the flavors and textures were very good. The buns are larger than you think. Would recommend trying this.

Crispy Chicken ($3/5 pcs): this is a very large portion size of karaage for the price. To be honest, the crispy chicken was a little on the dry side on the inside for me albeit very crisp on the outside as advertised. I'm not sure if I would order this again.

Marinated Spinach ($2): sprinkled with sesame seeds, this was dish was marinated in a sweet soy sauce. Overall, it was okay but not something I felt I needed to order again.

Baby Leaf Salad ($2): I found the dressing to be a bit watery and under seasoned - could probably use a bit more onion in the dressing to make the flavors in the daikon dressing pop. I'd probably skip on this one.

An-Nin Tofu ($2): this is almost like an almond tofu mousse in texture and incredible soft. For my tastes, it didn't have quite enough almond taste to but it was nice and light. Not a bad dessert, may order it again if we come for happy hour again.

Given that they make one of the better bowls of ramen in the Las Vegas area, I would recommend you come in for their tonkotsu ramen and the brussel sprouts tempura. (3.5 star bump up to 4 star review",h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q,8,6,4,VoBJL8bgVp57kP53m9DbWw

The place is a little loud for me and every time I go, it seems like it's a half hour wait.   But I can't fault them for the wait, they are popular and don't have too much seating.  

The broth is tasty.   Maybe a little salty for my taste but nonetheless it was enjoyable.   The noodles I have no complaints about either.   Where the stars went shooting from a 4 down to a 3 was the meat.  I got the one with chicken and they give like two fairly small pieces.   Chicken is cheap as hell.   Can I please have a semi respectable amount in my bowl???    It just feels like it's not proportionate.   And the chicken itself is nothing at all special.

The broth was the only reason I didnt give it a one star. I then proceeded to biting into the chashu (pork) and it tasted bland and to top it off, it was cold. I couldn't believe it and I even had to ask a waiter why this was. She said that jinya serves their chashu cold. That's when I ordered the side of chashu to see if it was true. I got it and felt it and yep it was cold AF. I couldn't believe it.. Other than the over all dish tasting OK, the service was great and the enviroment was chill.

how terribly wrong was i???

jinya does what the monta's of the world wished they could do.
they make a broth so flavorful without adding the salt that others do.
they make noodles that are perfectly al dente, even the skinny ones.
because, in the end, the only things that really matter in a bowl of ramen are the broth and the noodles.
oh, wait, and the egg too!
theirs is perfectly seasoned and perfectly cooked.

there was only one time that i went and the noodles were actually undercooked.

I came here with some friends visiting from the 808. I was telling them about new Ramen spot in town. I had my worries cause back home Ramen is almost as common as Spam musubi. So pleasing the local boys would be tough. JINYA never missed a beat 808 style.

I remember years ago the building that JINYA in changed few times over the years. My last memories thinking was fast food chain. So walking into the restaurant was totally different world. I like the whole revamp look from the interior the lighting fixtures, the huge community table is different, still have your booths, also have small but tradition Ramen Bar area with bar stools (have your own private show of sorts watching the chefs at work), all the bowls Ramen serve in screams personality, the sake box of sorts that the tempura brussel sprouts served in, and even the outside clearly stands out. The fact that it opens till 3am...

JINYA not very big place but then again most Ramen spots here in Vegas not that big. So if you go when busy expect to wait or do like three of us did community table. We started with tow appetizers the JINYA bun and the Tempura Brussel Sprouts. The JINYA bun was ok. I was thinking more along the line of peking duck with oyster sauce in steamed bun. It amounted too was charsu in steamed bun. I needed sauce or something bring personality to the dish. The brussel sprouts that was amazing!! Honestly after having the brussel sprouts give regular traditional shrimp tempura bad name. The brussel sprouts was perfect nice al dente and hot inside. The tempura batter was perfect consistency not over heavy or light. It had the right amount of coating, flavor, and the truffle oil on top took it to another level. Appetizer that must in restaurant this is one highly recommend. Addicting we crushed it between three of us. 

I went with the Tonkatsu Spicy. It had nice kick. I love the broth had so much depth and mention the kick again. If not enough they have different spicy condiments on the table. I love all the stuff that on top of the Ramen. You get nice size portion of noodles in the bowl. The bowl deceiving cause lip of the bowl not wide but deep bowl. I know had noodles till the end. 

The menu has great diversity. Few more appetizers that looked (lot of the items have picture on the menu) good! The Ramen again diversity even have vegetarian one. One of the best things about the menu. They offer combinations with choice of appetizer plus ramen. The catch is can only go with the combinations they offer. Still something that can not think of other Ramen spots that offer it. Ramen and gyoza that must for me. I got the best of both worlds. The homemade gyoza was awesome. The combination gyoza you only get four pieces instead of regular order of six.

Food: Ordered the Jinya Chicken Ramen, Jinya bun, Brussel Sprouts Tempura and Takoyaki. The ramen is very well made. Slightly better than your average ramen. The Jinya bun, which consists of Chashu Pork is so good. It literally saddens me when I finish one. The Brussel Sprouts are crispy on the outside, and nice and chewy on the inside, as a brussel sprout should be. The Takoyaki is terrific. I've only had it once before as a child in Japan, and I can honestly say that this was better.

Service: Our waiter and the cooks inside greeted us with the obligatory ""IRASHAI!"" upon entry. He welcomed us to Jinya the first time we came, and explained almost everything on the menu, including his favorites. 

Decor: Very interesting layout, with booths and a community style large table in the middle. It is funny to see how us Americans require our space, as strangers will almost never sit directly next to someone.",Ozmf732ox-TNhfKrjWBXpg,2,2,4,RqPrXczqBja_3hCOmb-nMQ

For a while I *thought* this was my favorite ramen bar, but I realize now that it was only because of the atmosphere - it's super alluring in here. Something about the filament bulb lighting and the massive community table that could have you sitting next to Drake or Beyoncé on any random night. Or perhaps the clean 'Less Than Zero' -esque bathrooms being textbook designs for impulsive restaurant bathroom sex and doing lines of cocaine off of the black lacquer Toto toilet tank lid. Imagine that!

Reality check, though. The food here is just not at the same level of umami as say, Ramen Sora (another LV ramen spot down the street). The kitchen food at Jinya just isn't that great. So crazy how the ambience at Jinya helps make every bite you taste seem like the most delicious version of that bite you've ever tasted. And that is worth something, but don't be tricked. Don't let the ambiance drug get 'cha.

For sure a great first-date place. The lighting will make you look like Zac Efron to your Tinder-mate. It's a sexy spot.

2295647,2014-08-19,4,gx2yPrOJSwF1ApJYdGBWIw,"Stopped by last week to meet up with my homie Michael K for happy hour but wasn't too impressed. Although the HH prices are fairly cheap, like $2-3 for everything, it's not much of a discount off the original price so it's not really worth going out of your way to make it on time. For example the Jinya bun is $3.80 but during HH it's 3 bucks. Crispy chicken is usually $5 but during HH it's 3 bucks as well. Anyways, HH is daily from 3 to 5 PM.

Didn't get ramen on this visit because it was still early for dinner and we wanted to take full advantage of the happy hour specials. Plus, I was a little turned off by their ramen pricing which seemed a little steep for what seems like a standard sized bowl. I ordered a Jinya bun and crispy chicken which is basically karage. The Jinya bun was surprisingly delicious and I loved how tender and flavorful the meat is. The crispy chicken is a 5 piece order which makes it a killer deal for 3 bucks during HH; tastes similar to karage I've had at any other ramen joint. I tried some of Michael's tempura fried brussel sprouts but they aren't for me, probably because I'm not a big brussel sprouts eater...I'm sure it's a taste that I just haven't acquired.

The service was pretty decent although I felt like they came by our table way too often to try to pick up empty plates practically as soon as we were done with the item and to ask if we needed water refills.

I was about 10th on the waitlist but only single person party.  The restaurant does not have enough waiting area for people on the wait list and they will skip you if they call your name 3 times and no reply.  This restaurants looks like a normal Japanese Ramen place but there are few quirky things about this place.  One is that there is only a small ramen bar area big enough for 5 people (usually reserved for single patrons in most places but not here).  The menu looked decent enough and food looked good and had recommendations for people new to Ramen.  I ordered the number 1 most popular ramen (for garlic lovers) and a gyoza/salad set.  After I ordered, I looked at the condiments and found a ramen seasoning that looked like Guam Finadene sauce.  I asked the waitress what is was and she said that it was Guam Sauce.  I thought this was weird and also thought that it was weird when they brought out a garlic press with garlic out so I could press as much garlic as I wanted into the ramen.  I figured it was safer if the customer added their own garlic so they can't be blamed for too much inside.  I love garlic so I added a lot.  The ramen was ok, kind of small and the garlic did add good flavor to the soup but the thick noodles were nothing special to me.  Also the gyoza was completely crap.  It was tiny and overcooked to a crisp.  The waitress forgot my salad and then brought me salad with goma (sesame) dressing which was good if it wasn't drowning in dressing.  Waitresses were cute but this place is not worth the wait if you have to wait and it is nothing special if you have eaten good ramen before.

It was about an inch long and cylinder shaped. I was unbelievably shocked, scared, and embarrassed. I could have died; even the server agreed so! When we asked to see the GM, they did not even address us directly, but somebody else that worked there did. Our meal was, of course, comp'ed. As for the piece of metal, we were told that it was probably from a cleaning brush they regularly use to clean the ramen bowls with. I wish I hadn't have given the piece of metal up so promptly and took a picture first. This was completely unacceptable and easily life threatening.

I have my eye on the takoyaki. Also enjoyed the excellent service. We must have come after the rush because everyone was pepped up but not many tables were full. This is what we enjoyed:

Tonkotsu Black: buttery oily broth, thinner noodles al dente/perfect, chashu with melty slippery fat, uncut marinated boiled egg (wish it was softer yolk, but still good taste), a couple nori sheets, just the right amount of garlic oil, green onions, crunchy onions (so savory), and a tiny dallop of chili paste. This was great. Spicy crazed folks may enjoy adding the chili paste to it, which is at every table.

Tokyo Tonkotsu (Special): chunky savory broth was very good- had onion chunks, but toward the end tasted very salty, same chashu-egg-nori-green onions, and bonito flakes. This one tasted much better than the black, but was also insanely savory. No need for any additional condiments.

I've tried really hard to love this place, really I have, but I just can't find the heart to. Seating is always easy to find, out of the 7 times I've been, I don't think I've ever once had to wait for an open seat.

Food is slightly pricier than Monta but you compensate for a little bit larger quantity. Most of the popular appetizer favorites are also constantly present on their ever changing menu as well, like their: takoyaki, chicken karaage, or edamame, with some occasional new ones like the pig ears, and shrimp ball.

I've had their miso, tonkatsu, and even experimented with their new garlic ""cha cha cha"" ramen, but it only left me wanting to ""cha cha cha"" out their door unfortunately.
Their cha cha cha was overpowering in onion flavor and drowned out anything else that was even present in the broth. As for their miso and tonkatsu, on the times I've returned it left me thinking the ramen was mediocre at best resulting in either a slightly more bland flavor or more over powering feel, but never a decent balance. I haven't really been having good consistency here..

I ordered the Tokyo Ramen as a combo with California roll and salad. Pig Ear Chicharron was on the happy hour menu for $5 so I wanted to try it. 
To say first I m alone , my experience is that most servers are not too thrilled about it, it took them a couple minutes to acknowledge me but then she was friendly. I got the salad that was ok nothing special. The California roll was really good , real crab and not freezing cold. The Chicharron was interesting, served on crispy kale that was very salty was the pig ear, don't really know if fried or how it really was prepared but it was flavorful and strange in a good way. The Ramen was very tasty, as for the broth the rest was nothing special kind of weird , smooth pork and the same leaves that I had in the salad? What's up with that??

2468756,2014-11-11,8,gx2yPrOJSwF1ApJYdGBWIw,"Instant ramen is the best-selling item at the Rikers prison commissary, outselling coffee, candy, and Coke.

You won't find instant ramen at Jinya Ramen Bar, but you will find a bunch of great options to eat. In fact, I'm tempted to give Jinya 5 stars for having so many really good items...but in the end I'm not sure that any one thing they do is my actual favorite. I love their Premium Tonkotsu White Ramen--a blend of pork & chicken broth with pork chashu, kikurage, green onion, seasoned egg, and a little fried onion. I always get it with their thick noodles, make it spicy and add some fresh garlic. The broth has such a lovely consistency and feel as it coats your mouth and invites you to lick your lips.

While the  Premium Tonkotsu White Ramen is my favorite, there are several other items that are better than the usual items you find at ramen shops, such as:
Chicken Chashu
Pork Bun
Pork Gyoza

I also really liked the Tonkotsu Black Ramen. It is a more traditional pork broth and comes with garlic chips and garlic oil, both of which add a nice depth to the already flavorful broth.

I have also tried their Spicy Chicken and Vegetable Soup Ramens.  Both are good, but not what I'm typically looking for when I head to a ramen shop. Besides, Jinya specializes in Tonkotsu and Tokyo styles of ramen...so I'm not sure I see the merit in venturing away from what they do best.

The brussel sprouts are a miss for me. They are heavy and don't do anything good to promote tempura or brussel sprouts.

You can also get pretty carried away customizing your ramen in a lot of beautiful ways here, so take advantage of the opportunity...maybe add some greens to your diet!",A5A34ixb-yy6nwL42iZsnw,11,10,4,FnbhD7DdnArcqzJRj1jlyA

Parts of my food were very cold and other parts were warm. For example, the seasoned egg in my ramen soup was cold on the inside. How does that happen? My family didn't really care for the ramen because the broth was very, very thick and too rich for their taste. I thought it was okay but I do agree that it was very thick.

After a relatively short wait we were seated.  The ambience was excellent.  Plenty of room for such a small venue and very clean.  They were quite busy for a Tuesday night but our server was prompt and quaint.  We both ordered the Tonkotsu Spicy bowl (I ordered my usual side of Kim Chee).  Very tasty.  Spoke with the manager after listening to her handle a guest who complained about the noodles (which I found annoying).  She was gracious during their exchange and I let her know that she did well not to lose her cool.

Less then a year ago i gave this place a high rating, i'm not sure if its new management or if they just have been having some off days. Ramen is not as good as it use to be. But besides that it's decent. After work we usually eat here, or phó. But last night we chose Jinya. I ordered the cilantro one with thick noodles. When I received my bowl I noticed it had thin noodles. Ok,  easy fix right? I got the attention of a server passing by and let her know I asked for thick noodles. She took my bowl back to the pass and after talking over my bowl with the young lady who toll my order. She brings my bowl back and says ""the supervisor said she took your order and you didn't order thick"" . So now I'm stumped.  The supervisor walks over and says ""you didn't order thick noodles"". I reminded her that I did. She said she couldn't remake it but they could give me thick noodles on the side. I wasn't in the mood for double noodles. So I just declined the offer and took my bowl as is. (After it was passed around). It's after work and I was hungry. I'm 7 months pregnant and was craving a bowl of ramen with thick noodles. We were finishing our meal she comes back to apologise and offers me a free ice cream.  Because ice cream covers all mistakes. I said no thank you. She comes back with a pre plated dessert and again said ""I'm sorry you are upset"". No She was not.

2500163,2017-03-01,1,gx2yPrOJSwF1ApJYdGBWIw,"Wow. Just... wow. 8:15pm on a Tuesday night and I show up by myself to probably one of the best meals I've had since I can remember. I sat at the bar and got so much personal attention from the staff. My waiter was SUPER attentive, the hostess checked up on me as well, and even the chef made sure everything was OK. It made for such a pleasant experience... and I haven't even gotten to the food yet (it was A++). My waiter went over the menu with me but because of the pictures on yelp and what I had gotten at other places, and because I wasn't feeling 100% (getting over a cold), I knew about 99% of what I wanted, just had to find it on the menu. I ordered the salmon tacos, pork bun, pork gyoza, tonkatsu black ramen, and a hot green tea. Let me tell you, I was not disappointed one bit. The salmon tacos had a nice refreshing taste to them and the taco itself was the perfect shell. Tons of salmon meat as well as some nice surprises such as tomatoes and onions. The pork bun was tender, flavorful, and delicious. The pork gyoza were ever so crispy and yet delicately soft at the same time. They were flavorful and did not come with sauce (they didn't need it). The gyoza did stick a little together but came apart nicely with minimal effort. Lastly, my ramen was mildly spicy and a nice temperature. The noodles were cooked perfectly and the flavor was phenomenal. My pork pieces were surprisingly cold but my waiter checked in on me instantly after a couple bites and not two minutes later I had two fresh, hot pieces I could replace my current ones with. Boy, did that make a HUGE difference. The pork was even a bit crispy toward the end for a bit of texture (but not overly so) and still juicy. My only regret is not having finished all my food and not being able to take it with me since I was staying at a hotel without a fridge/ microwave (although it was only a 10 minute drive to the restaurant, a plus). Everything came out so quickly that I was done in probably 30 min, which was great because I had had a long day.

There was a bit of a wait (a little extra for an actual table instead of this communal table they've got going on), but we didn't mind. There was a super upbeat, trendy vibe that we enjoyed.

The prices weren't bad, either. And the hours were great, as we had just gotten out of a show & few places are open, nevermind with vegan options. The service was good. I really appreciated that the server knew which condiments were vegan & offered that info without us even asking.

My only only oooonly wish was that we could try more of the fried veggie appetizers due to the shared equipment thing (not vegan friendly - but I appreciate how open they are about this - it's on the menu, I think).

2616069,2017-06-13,6,gx2yPrOJSwF1ApJYdGBWIw,"Absolutely loved my first experience at Jinya Ramen Bar!

My mom and I came for a somewhat early dinner and waited for about 20 minutes or so, not too bad for a Sunday evening! I put my name down on the waiting list and peaked inside the restaurant. I was surprised at the size of the place. It was actually smaller than what I expected it to be, but bigger than Monta's interior. The dining table in the middle of the restaurant reminds me of medieval times, really cool.

We were seated and greeted by our waiter. He was so friendly and since it was our first time, he explained the menu to us and even recommended a few of his favorites! He suggested the JINYA Tonkotsu Black and also said that it was one of the best sellers. Now I know why! I was already thinking about ordering the Tonkotsu Black, but his suggestion just confirmed that it's what I would be ordering. The broth was creamy, hot, rich, and full of flavor. Anyone who loves ramen knows that the broth is the most important part of the dish and Jinya definitely nailed it. The broth was also really garlicky, which I loved! It was served with the right amount of thin noodles and the toppings gave the dish the perfect texture. The kikurage is my fav!

I also ordered the Tokyo Curry Rice and house salad to pair with my bowl of ramen. After the Tokyo Curry Rice arrived to our table, I won't lie, I was a little skeptical at first. To be quite honest, it didn't look appetizing at all, but oh my god, was I wrong! Why did I not know that this stuff exists? It was packed with flavor and extremely filling on its own. I would definitely recommend this dish! The house salad was okay. It was made with arugula, which I'm not too big a fan of, but the dressing was interesting and tasted good!

As far as appetizers go, my mom ordered the gyoza and the JINYA Bun. She enjoyed both, especially the Bun. We'll have to come back and try the Crispy Shrimp Balls because that's what everyone around us seemed to be ordering!

Overall, a great bar to get your ramen fix! The service was great, our food was even better, prices are reasonable, and the atmosphere was hip! Can't wait to bring the rest of my family to Jinya and show them what it's all about!",CqeLXgQUpMZNbz4GwBz87w,6,7,4,rcqH88HQOqezRzosR9wD-g
2618322,2016-08-20,0,gx2yPrOJSwF1ApJYdGBWIw,"I love ramen, I mean the real ramen not the instant ramen noodles from the store. After driving almost 7 hours, this was our first stop. 
I ordered the spicy tonkatsu ramen and my husband ordered the vegan ramen. 

My ramen was so delicious, a very nice & rich flavorful broth, freaking good tonkatsu, melted in mouth, cooked perfectly. The other important part from a good ramen is the noodle. This noodle was perfect! Not mushy at all. The texture was  perfect, it had a body. It was nothing like instant packaged noodle at all. 

My husband's ramen was delicious too, and again the broth & the noodle were perfect. 

Price is cheap for a very delicious ramen, yeah especially if I compare with ramen in Reno that I had before, was nothing to compare about. This ramen has a very good quality, lots of broth so it was not like noodle bowl with less broth, this was the real ramen. 

The place wasn't that busy that day, because we were there after lunch time. The restroom was clean & quite fancy toilet bowl with a picture on the wall wrote no ramen no life, pretty cool funny. 

Maybe someday they will open in Reno, well I hope so, real ramen from Japanese people not just western style of ramen.",zgR1qppUiE3_HGWbRIYOJA,4,5,5,WR1Jene9OBagpAKxtpG2Lw
2619350,2014-08-29,9,gx2yPrOJSwF1ApJYdGBWIw,"Jinya, whatever culinary wizardry you got going on in the kitchen, keep it up! My tastebuds thank you. 

Jinya reawoken my love for ramen in Las Vegas. Granted, I've only had the chance to try Monta so far, I can quickly say that I preferred the (less saltier) ramen at Jinya. The broth was wonderfully delicate - It's not a condense, salty, ghastly rich and difficult to digest broth like Monta's. (But hey, if that's your thing? Just not for me.) I'm typically an advocate of strong, punch-you-in-the-face flavor, but something about that broth at Jinya kept me sipping and savoring the quality ingredients of the comforting broth. 

I can understand that some may feel that the lighter at broth at Jinya is unfavorable. However, I have to argue that if you feel so inclined, you can always add dashes (or tablespoons) of the delicious bottled ramen seasoning and thick spicy sauce that is conveniently sitting on each table, in order to adjust the boldness of your ramen broth. You have control of customizing the flavor of your ramen? I'm down with that! Honestly, my boyfriend and I didn't go crazy with the table-side ramen seasoning - a few dashes will set it off just right. Enjoy savoring that broth, close your eyes if you need to. It's actually more wonderful than you can even imagine, when you take it all in with the perfect bite: some broth, a little bit of noodles, some seaweed, some corn (if you added it), some chashu, etc. and slurp away! It just hugs your tastebuds and your belly. 

Here's what I recommend: 
- Jinya Tonkotsu Black ($10.55) - 2 slices of pork chashu+ kickurage+ green onion+ nori dried seaweed+ soft boiled seasoned egg+ garlic chips+ garlic oil+ fried onion+ thin ramen noodles. Yeah. This is the broth I was talking about when I wrote my love story above. The thin ramen noodles were perfectly cooked, al dente. The soft boiled ""seasoned egg"" is ultra luscious, silky, and also cooked perfectly. All of the components in this ramen were meant to be eaten together. I truly enjoyed the delicate nuances of garlic in the broth, it was not at all pungent or artificial tasting. I also feel that the toppings I chose were perfect for this ramen- 

Toppings added: 
- Corn ($1) - I love corn and I love corn in ramen soups! It adds a lovely pop of texture and sweetness with each slurp of the broth. Highly recommend. 
- Fresh Garlic (FREE) - They bring out a small jar of raw garlic cloves that have been soaking in water and also provide you with a metal hand garlic press. You can freshly press the garlic yourself and adjust how much garlic you want in your soup. The garlic flavor is very smooth and not aggressive, because the soaking method removes a lot of the pungent, spicy, bitterness in the plain raw garlic. It really enhanced the garlic flavor in the Tonkotsu black broth and brought the ramen to a whole notha' level. If you're are a garlic lover, I highly recommend! 
- Extra Pork Chashu ($2 for 2 pieces) The chashu here is indeed buttery, but there is also a good amount of enjoyable, tender, meaty substance - unlike the flimsy fatty chashu that just disintegrates into the broth at Monta. 

We also tried:
- Jinya Bun ($3.80) - Daaaym! that pork belly is buu-tter-yyyy!!! That pork belly is what makes the bun unforgettable. The toppings and the sauce were on the simple/weak side, so I can't necessarily say I need to order this every time I come here. But I would definitely recommend this for first-timers to enjoy that expertly cooked, buttery pork belly.  

- Takoyaki ($4.80) - Philip T. didn't joke around when he said it was one of the better versions (if not the best) takoyaki in Vegas. It came out hot, plump, juicy, and it even had cooked egg white chunks (egg salad?) in the mayo! That was totally unexpected and added such an amazing texture and unique flair to the beloved classic. Take your takoyaki ball and just run it along the plate to pick up any (and all) of the takoyaki sauce and chunky mayo sauce - sounds weird, but that's how it was meant to be eaten! The octopus inside each ball was also cooked perfectly, moist and extra tender. 

Not only was all of the food we tried satisfying, I was also really diggin' the ultra sexy vibe and bossy decor here. Plus, right when we walked in, their amazing song playlist completely captured my attention. They played back-to-back-to-back jams that were right up my alley. I'll admit it - I used SoundHound the entire dinner to figure out what exactly was playing, since I needed to add it to my playlist. I can only recall 1-2 places in my entire life, where the music really set an amazing mood for dinner. I'm so happy to report that Jinya was certainly added to my list as one of those places. 

I am relieved they are open late until 3 am (!!!), in Vegas it's necessary and a step above all of their competitors. They also have a ramen/ Japanese tapas drive-thru coming soon! No way? That's crazy! I can't wait until next time!",u_wqt9RshdZsoj8ikLqoEQ,18,14,5,l8MjubkpHtz9ZQs9HFgXPQ

I really like the Tonkutsu Black and the regular tonkutsu ramen noodles. Thin noodles all the way for me. I've never had their thick noodles so I don't really know what it's like.

I've been a Monta fan for a while now. Going there at least once a week. I decided to try this place since it's new. As soon as we walked in, we were greeted by the server and running. The server names Alex immediately asked if we've been here before. We said no so she kindly explained the menu and her favorite things on there and asked if we'd like drinks. After quickly coming back with them, we ordered. She even asked us if we'd prefer getting the appetizers first or if it didn't matter if we get the ramen first. No one has ever asked that before. She showed that she really wanted us to enjoy our dinner there! She was so full of energy and looked like she really loved being there. Her alone would make me give this place a 5. I adore her. 

Now to the food, the gyoza was great. An 8 piece appetizer. Cali roll was delicious too! I'm used to going to ramen places that either didn't have rolls or had really tasteless ones so I was really happy with it. The pork chashu bowl was amazing and even the small was big! They even flavored the pork before. A decent selection of beer as well. I can't remember the ramen I tried exactly but it was something black. Very good! I tried my boyfriend garlic something ramen (sorry I suck haha) and I liked that one better personally! Some of the appetizers come with salad as well! 

The place is very nice looking. Dim lights and they even have a large party table in the middle!

Also, had the fresh tofu, made at your table.  This was a real winner also.  Comes with 4 toppings and a ponzu sauce.  toppings were a sesame salt, green onions, scallions, bonito flakes and a citrus/ginger topping.  Any fan of tufu should like this.

Lighter but still flavorful broth.    The wait staff was very attentive and friendly.   Only weird part was that none of the booths were open and so we had to sit at a large communal table.

I had the Jinya No. 1- Tonkatsu Black. The broth was hearty and flavorful. The noodles are thin, but I think I prefer it like this. The chashu is tender and the rest of the ingredients/toppings were complimentary to the ramen soup. It had nori, kikurage, seasoned egg (nitamago), garlic chips, fried crispy onion, green onion and a little dollop of red chili pepper sauce.  It was very good. 

My daughter had the Tokyo Yatai ramen. It came with a chicken and pork clear broth, chicken, chashu, bamboo shoots green leafy veggies, fried onion and nitamago. She opted to not have the shredded red peppers.  She ate as much as she could. She rarely orders ramen and her saying that this was delicious was a big deal to me. She usually opts for a small bowl of just rice and chashu. 

We ordered the gyoza and Takoyaki. Gyoza were on the small side (from what I am used to), but just delicious. Takoyaki on point. I haven't had really good Takoyaki in the states except from Shirokiya at the Ala Moana mall in Oahu and my time I was in Japan for vacation.

I would like to imagine that I was one of their favorite customers. I was absolutely devastated when they closed down the Costa Mesa location. While I was in Vegas, I stayed at Palms Place and I was so close to JINYA, I knew I had to go back for that delicious tonkatsu broth that lingers to my soul!! 

I came about 10 minutes after they opened and the restaurant was already half full. The place was packed by the time I was ready to order!!  I had the JINYA Tonkotsu Black ($12) which has their heavenly pork broth, thin noodles, pork cha shu, seasoned egg, garlic chips, garlic aioli, fried onion and spicy sauce. I actually asked them to make this spicy for me since I liked the ingredients in this bowl better than the Tonkotsu Spicy Ramen. I made my dish a combo (additional $4.20) for 4 piece gyoza and salad. 

The person next to me ordered their combo after me but they received their salad first. I got my salad a while after and I was less than impressed. The gyozas were pretty good but definitely on the smaller side. I do not recommend the combination upgrade. 

My JINYA Tonkotsu Black was almost as impressive as I remembered. The broth was PERFECT and the seasoned egg leaves my heart fluttering. The only thing that I wasn't in love with was their cha shu. Hopefully I went on an off day because the cha shu was tough and not as flavorful as I remembered. 

I also splurged while I was on vacation mode for their Panna Cotta ($3.50). This is one of my all time favorite desserts and I loved the panna cotta itself but I have no clue why they threw ice cream on top of it. The sweetness of the ice cream over powered the delicate panna cotta. This panna cotta had the perfect consistency and I feel like they downgraded the product as a whole by throwing on a scoop of ice cream. 

The conclusion is that you should come here for the ramen, but nothing else. Their service can really improve too. I came and ordered because the customer next to me but they gave him his identical order before I got my stuff. And also there was this annoying issue where at first they ran out of the pork broth and only had the chicken broth.

The hostess was really friendly and so was our server. The restaurant itself is pretty small but they seemed to get customers in and out at a pretty quickly. Every employee was extremely attentive and made sure we were satisfied with our food.

I ordered the ""Old Skool Ramen"" and subbed the thin noodles for the thick noodles. Overall I have to say that the ramen was pretty good, but I did not think that it was as good as the ramen served at Ramen Sora. The pork chashu was kind of dry, but other than that it was good.

I have never experienced this at any restaurant before. The waiter did not offer to bring me a new bowl of ramen when I notified him about the disgusting matter. He instead made a joke about stating that it could've been his hair (he is a young white male with long hair). Unfortunately I do not remember his name. I was forced to pay for this unsanitary meal and the manager never came out to speak to me about the matter which is an absolute no-no. I work in hospitality myself and this has never gone on at my restaurant and if in fact there is any reason the customer is not satisfied, our manager comes out immediately to accommodate the customers needs and to express sincere apologies. This restaurant obviously does not know the meaning of hospitality and does NOT care about their customers. What a DISGUSTING establishment.

I came here with my girlfriend right before they closed after a crazy night out.  There was only one other party inside.

It also had bean sprouts, green onions, chili, spinach, and chicken.  I also asked for some black garlic oil on the side.  It was still a little bland so I added some of their gyoza sauce to give it more flavor.  I wish they had vinegar instead.  It was very good and super filling.  As for the shrimp balls, we had ask the waitress how big they were.  They were a LOT bigger than what she told us.  They were good though.  Extra crispy on the outside and filled with lots of delicious shrimp pieces inside.  It came served on a spicy mayo sauce.  We couldn't finish them.  

Our total was about $25.  I thought pricing was very cheap and reasonable.  The bowls all run about $11 each and any additional add-ons, such as corn, is another $1.  The service was excellent.

Started off with the gyoza. They did a pretty good. Not too oily and the gyoza had a nice crisp side to it and the wrapper was still soft and chewy on the other side. They have premade sauce for the gyoza. I tend to like mine a little spicy so all I did was ask for chili oil.

I had the chicken wonton ramen. I have to say I am a fan of the more traditional places where you order Ramen and depending on what you order all the extras are included. You have to pay for everything outside of the noodles at this place. If you want an egg, which I added, it comes at a price. I also added the butter and Green onions.

Once we were able to sit down, we ordered the Spicy Chicken Ramen and the Tokyo Special Ramen (available until February). Both were delicious. The broth on both of them were so hearty and the noodles were cut and made just right. Not too soft and not too hard but just right.... If I had to pick which one was better I would pick the Spicy Chicken Ramen. The broth is so good and the chicken is so tender. The Tokyo Special is still nice though, they give you a some pork chasu and an egg.

I've tried a few ramen places including Monta, Ramen Tatsu and Ramen Sora and in my opinion, Jinya beats all the others hands down. Highly recommended and I will be back!",1gEzF_sgGxgIb0w-ONBtBw,0,0,5,rBQI5yjDiYQ8PFQyITK5jw

Cute ramen shop with lots of different ramen bases and add ins to choose from! It was so late that I don't exactly remember the name of what we got, but I did get a white...tonkotsu base? And my be got something with hellllaaaa garlic. All you need to know is that the flavors were reaaaallllyyyyy good! We also got the pork buns as an appetizer and I'm fairly happy with those also! 

I feel as if the cuts of meat were generous, but I still have lots of love for My OG spot in Vegas- Monta Ramen. Monta is a more simplistic ramen with good cuts of porkbelly and relatively basic but delicious add ins. I'd have to say that JINYA is unique for the different flavors, the atmosphere with great service, and the attention to detail with their ramen. Definitely try this place out!

Truthfully, I haven't been back since to Ramen Sora or Monta Ramen since this place has opened, so I feel a bit guilty for that. I really like the Tonkatsu Black Ramen and appreciate that it comes with everything you could already want, no need to order any extra. They have a ""ramen sauce"" on the table, but I haven't been compelled to use it. There is a good variety of appetizers here, my favorite so far is the tempura Brussels Sprouts that are really well seasoned, no sauce needed. My one complaint would be that my husband and I keep getting seated in cramped 2-person tables when there are plenty of other non-cramped 2-person tables available. I'm going to start speaking up on this when we go, I'm a bit tired of putting my purse on the floor or on the chair and it getting hit the whole time. Otherwise, I really enjoy coming here.

Such as the Truffled Brussels Sprouts Tempura. Light tempura crunch into brussels snap then the sharp taste of strong truffle oil.  The aroma of truffle is so strong it can be sensed at the next table.  Real or not I'd take any kind of black truffle flavor I can in the summer. 4/5

The sticky bun pork sliders were soo tender.  I would say the pork was cooked over night.  The bun was soft fresh and delicate.  The light sweet sauce and arugula finish it off as my favorite asian slider to date.  All so tender it made me eat it slowly. 4.5/5

Takoballs were arranged in a line of six.  Lightly golden fried with a little slice of baby octopi in them.  They are nested atop an egg salad cream.  Flavor was not too prominent but the textures were nice.  3.5/5

Crispy Chicken was only 3$ for 5 pieces during HH.  They were crispy and not dry in any way inside.  White meat and heavy portioned there was a small dash of that Japanese signature salad.  A little bit of dipping sauce (ponzu?) it was a nice filler. 3.5/5

The Tonkotsu Black is the more formal ramen here.  It has everything in it.  Seaweed, soft boiled egg, fried onions, etc. with small noodles.  Now this is the thicker broth of chicken and pork with 2 slices of tender pork medalion.  So rich and not salty at all.  I imagined turtle soup would be this thick.  This is the best bowl of ramen I've had in town & I've been to Japan.  So if I hadn't I'd say it was the best I've ever tried.. 4.5/5

For dessert we had a whipped almond custard that had chopped fruit.  Only 2$ during HH!

Modern eastern minimalist decor, of which I have a fetish.  Notable service.  Damn good ramen!  4.5 star restaurant.",ZngF2uBYrqyFjXd6LvuluQ,9,6,4,L58WW9wUMY9snJ9vZHDwqQ

Takoyaki, tasty and generously portioned. Chachacha, garlic flavors, chasiu was good, not a fan of the thick noodles, extremely filling.

I am never coming back here after my terrible experience!!
We ordered takoyaki and after eating few pieces my girlfriend found a long hair in one of them!
When we called our server she gave us a weird look and took the plate away, no apology no sorry nothing!! She treated us like it was our fault there was a hair in the food!
When she brought our check she said I took the takoyaki of the bill, still no apology! I thanked her and we paid the bill. I asked to talk with the manager who was a little bit more understating and offer us ice cream next time we visit. I explained to her that it should not be my who has to ask for a manager in this situation and someone should apologize 
1 star for terrible service, I understand mistake happens but the server should react in a more professional manner instead of giving us attitude and not offering an apology.",NU4ezggJNqDsGOk-NPwQLQ,1,0,1,39pth29cea0nPUYLbTx2lA

2989933,2015-03-08,0,gx2yPrOJSwF1ApJYdGBWIw,"I like that Jinya Ramen Bar is trying to do something different than the other ramen shops in Vegas. I did like their Tokatsu Black ramen for ~$10.50. Very fatty, deep broth with plenty of garlic (which I love), good thin noodles and tasty meat. It could use a little more meat and a little less salt. This is good, but I think that Monta Ramen has arguably better or just as good ramen and it's a few dollars cheaper.

The thing that sets Jinya apart is the rest of their menu (not the rice bowls). The tempura brussel sprouts with truffle oil were amazing! They were very crunchy but juicy on the inside and the truffle oil was both fragrant and tasty. It was also well seasoned with salt and pepper. They also have the best takoyaki in Vegas. Sufficient portions of octopus and just a well done, generous portion for $5.20.

They also have a happy hour from 3 - 5 p.m. on weekdays (I want to try their chicken karaage then) and also a lunch special seven days a week from 11:30 - 5 p.m. ($12 set menu with half ramen and half rice bowls, three gyoza, a free soft drink and almond tofu dessert.

 We will definitely be back!",QRq50fwDndezD-0BuJvcXw,0,0,5,Yy2IsPte1va86jX3CAMtHg

2992074,2018-06-19,0,gx2yPrOJSwF1ApJYdGBWIw,"I love this place! Let me just say I'm now vegan and have never been to this place in my meat eating days. I enjoyed pork in my ramen in my precious life so I'm constantly on the search for fatty, creamy, belly stretching vegan ramen. This. Is. It. I really loved their spicy creamy vegan ramen both times I came here.

This place isn't that large but they seem to make it work. There are a few bar seats, booths lining the restaurant and a community table in the center. I love that they have alcohol on the menu because who doesn't love beer and/or sake with their food? They have different items like tacos and buns on the menu that I have not tried but seem to be popular. They have a happy hour for drinks and food items.

One of the best things about this place is that they allow you to order extra noodles for your ramen for only $1-2.... so both times I finished my noodles and some of my broth, ordered extra noodles to go and had my broth packed to go as well. Second meal! I wish I lived closer to this spot. I would be here all the time!",yi0nAlMG8Mg3txBek1j0sA,0,0,5,0IrtGnYryXtyudASdvyZzA
3006648,2015-12-10,7,gx2yPrOJSwF1ApJYdGBWIw,"I was really looking forward to trying out Jinya since I read a good amount of positive reviews on Yelp.

We arrived at about 5 PM on 11/24, before heading out to catch our flight back home.  We were seated pretty much right away since it was a Monday and we happened to show up during their happy hour which is from 3-6 PM, I believe.

I decided to order the pork ear chicharones as an appetizer, since it looked really interesting from the picture on the menu.  My son loves hot sauce so we were hoping that it would be one of those items we'd come back for on our future visits.  It pretty much tasted like they just drenched tapatio sauce all over it.  It wasn't spicy at all so we won't be trying that again.

We both ordered a bowl of the tonkotsu spicy ramen, my son went for spicy while I opted for medium.  The broth was pretty good, but you can see that extra layer of fat once your broth gets cold which I'm not too crazy about.  The noodles were really firm to the point where it seemed undercooked.  Maybe I will ask to have them cook it longer next time.

Overall, I would come back if I need a ramen spot that stays open late, but if it's during regular business hours...I'll continue to enjoy my ramen at Ramen Sora.",Bbar1EB4JEviStEAqUEFOg,11,9,3,eJLSVtxAkHaCpXjxfK0XvQ

3023434,2017-06-05,0,gx2yPrOJSwF1ApJYdGBWIw,"I keep returning to jinya because I love their ramen so much!

But unfortunately I keep getting really unkind servers. I actually nudged my boyfriend and I asked him if we tip okay and he said we did. My friends had the same server in which they tip 20% everywhere they go - and terrible experience to the point they don't even go back anymore. 

I've had a tall white kid with blonde hair and we had to flag him down for anything we needed and he would come by and literally drop them on the table and quickly leave. I watched as he did that to multiple tables. Then there's a chick with glasses and light skinned, and for some reason she has a really bad attitude all the time. She brought us our ramen for our server and I asked her for two spoons because our table didn't have any, and she said yes and I watched her go straight for a pitcher of water to fill up other tables and then she kept looking over at me and I got up from my table and walked over to ask for spoons which were right behind her and she said ""yeah in just a minute."" And continued to not do anything. 15 minutes go by and my boyfriend got up and went to the same lil station and asked a different person and he got our spoons.. It's not only that time but every time, even if I just have a question she kind of looks at me like ""uh."" And I don't understand.. if I ever go back, I will make it clear not to have her near me again. I was pretty irritated and hungry and that almost pissed me off enough to ask her what's the deal but I have to remember to be nice and have consideration for others if they're having a bad day but damn. I've also had this OTHER girl who got irritated that I got a ramen with something I didn't ask her for but I wasn't asking for a remake, she was just forcing that upon me and I still paid for the type of soup I didn't ask for, haha.

I work in a restaurant myself and my job is to bring a smile to the table and welcome everyone to continue to help our business grow but I can't be rude to someone when I have no reasoning. It's frustrating in a faced paced place but I'm kind. As everyone should be. 

Maybe I'll start doing To go orders instead. Or I'll go to the other ramen place by the CSN Charleston Campus.",3FVQ3jA78nVx_xJbhxm7Vg,0,0,2,j7NBtA7FIy0ZGJpiMHg8fg

Ramen tasted alright, dessert was good except for the mochi ice cream (the consistency was grainy), but the appetizers & tapas are mediocre. Music is extremely loud (you can't even hear each other talk), the air conditioning vents made the food cold fast. The last time I went, their credit card machine went down. 

The server was nice, apologized & asked if it was ok for us to wait until it came back up but the hostess returned & forced two people out of our group to go to ATM's to pay for our food so that other people can sit in our booths. The machine went back up after 5 minutes but by then the two people out of my group already had left. The hostess didn't even apologize. Such a huge inconvenience!

3040986,2015-11-06,0,gx2yPrOJSwF1ApJYdGBWIw,"I've only really been to Monta Ramen and Ramen Sora but this place blows it out of the water. I'm not huge on ramen either, I feel they're all the same and have that same distinct creamy taste. However, with Jinya that's totally different.


First off, I love the ambience of the place it's very warm and sultry with dim lighting. The place is fairly small but was packed tonight and wasn't really a wait. The staff is very hands on and seem very inviting as well. 

Now for the food, this is my brothers favorite place so he recommend me try the Tokyo Yatai since this was my first time. It was absolutely delicious, the broth was both chicken and pork and had slices of chicken in it as well. I added corn and seaweed and opted out of the bamboo shoots since I feel bamboo really overpowers the true flavor of the broth. The spicy level I chose was hot and it was the right amount of hot for my palette, it wasn't like a bland type of spice only focusing on heat content but this spicy level was more so about flavor content and that's what I like. Overall, it was great and I finished my entire bowl.

Now the negatives as to why I didn't give it five stars, not really a wide selection of beer or other drinks. They had your regular sake's and craft beers with some novelty non-alcoholic drinks like Calpico and ramune but as far as everything else goes I wish they had more non-alcoholic drink options maybe expansion of their sodas or maybe even some Thai tea? Also no free refills which caused me to spend 7 dollars alone on just drinks.


Other than that, I still would recommend this place to everyone. They're doing great. Keep it up Jinya.",M6BoI78g1ul4XvBXF55p9g,0,0,4,_e9bjEwUMUym0gErmziqZA

3048641,2015-02-10,0,gx2yPrOJSwF1ApJYdGBWIw,"WIth the breaking news that JINYA is opening a restaurant in Chicago, I have been compelled to finish this review (not even the constant yelp reminder could do that!).

I enjoyed having the option of thin or thick noodles, and as I prefer the thicky thick (noodles), I went with those. It was a good decision.  Chose the Tonkotsu Black ramen and the spiciness was just right, especially for this fella who cannot handle his spice well. 

There are a number of items available to add-on, and if you add garlic they give you a press and you can press the garlic yourself. Pretty interactive.

I know the drive-thru may never open, but the fact that they even imagined the concept of a ramen drive-thru scores major points in my book. I'm up for the challenge if it ever does open!  Also, staying open until 3am is another bonus. I don't know about Vegas, but in Chicago I can only think of Strings in Chinatown that is open that late.

It's actually a little cheaper than places in Chicago so I wonder what the price points will be when they open one here.  In the meantime, I've found a place to fill my ramen cravings when in Vegas.  Feeling generous, so I'll drop a fiver on this joint.",rzpbbpb_oBW42aJxL6ixlQ,2,2,5,7CtpyaKYRbqf3nScfXUINw

There's chicken strips that are killer & the quinoa salad is a staple. Of course don't forget the ramen! Go for skinny noodles!

3067622,2017-09-25,0,gx2yPrOJSwF1ApJYdGBWIw,"I love JINYA Ramen Bar! 

Located on Flamingo, near Decatur.

Ate here dozens and dozens of times and happy almost every visit. I've brought many people for their first times and all enjoy themselves. 

The wait can get pretty long, about 5-20 minutes is standard these days but worth it. They still have you sign a piece a paper to put yourself on a list, sometimes they say hello but overall they welcoming should be improved. The girls doing the seating are great but just overworked and it could be much better. 

The noodles dishes are so good. The sprouting up ramen is my favorite. It was a seasonal one but it was so darn popular they remade the menu and added it on the very top, I get this almost every time and add pork sabaro and corn. 

If you eat all the noodles and have broth you can pay to add more noodles and even get them to go. Add the seasonings they have on the table and be sure to get the fresh crushed garlic for free, I love crushing it into my noodles. 

The cauliflower appetizer is great. Dessert has changed over the years but is always good and not to heavy or big. 

Price are just right but wish they had a stamp card for locals to show some love to their repeat customers. 

The staff all works hard and is great overall. It gets busy but most of the time they do very good. 

It is a cool vibe in this place, I highly recommend going with friends, a date, or even by yourself as they got a great little bar to sit one or a huge table to seat a large group.

It was happy hour we ordered two draft sapporos for 3 dollars a piece. Score! Started immediately with seaweed salad, spicy chicken and a pork bun. All of it was amazing! I recommend every single item! The servers use tablets which makes everything go by super fast I would say within 15 minutes we had our drinks our appetizers and our entrees.

3075558,2016-12-21,0,gx2yPrOJSwF1ApJYdGBWIw,"VERY DISAPPOINTED! This was my go to spot over Monta. I constantly raved about this place to my local and out of state friends & families. But after my most recent incident @ Jinya, I will no longer dine nor recommend this place to my friends & families.

Incident occurred on 12/18/16 @ 11:40pm on a busy night. I decided to order takeout after work since I needed comfort food bc I was sick. I waited at the host desk and stood in front of Christina, the host, and looked at her and she did not greet me even after exchanging eye contact. Instead she looked at me. Me as a customer, had to make the first initiative and asked Christina if I could see a takeout menu. She handed it to me & I stood in front of her while I looked at the menu for a good 5 minutes. I then proceeded and asked her if their is a combo meal that I could order to go and she replied yes. I continue to tell her my order and she responds, ""I'm sorry we are not taking any take orders at the moment because it is busy"".  I responded with, ""For future references, please put a sign at the front door to notify your customers that you are not accepting take out orders during busy hours"" as a common courtesy and to save your customers time. I asked to speak with the shift manager for the night, Adam. I also informed Adam that at a professional standpoint put a sign at the entrance as common courtesy. He then then told me that, ""THEY ARE TAKING ORDERS DURING BUSY HOURS ITS JUST THAT THERE IS A 30 MINUTE WAIT"". I told Adam that I was told differently by Christina that you guys are not taking orders. He apologized for the mistake, BUT I WAS AT THE POINT OF AGGRAVATION AND NO LONGER WANTED TO CONTINUE TO BE A CUSTOMER OF JINYA BECAUSE:

1) CHRISTINA THE HOST WAS NOT FRIENDLY NOR DID SHE GREET ME
2) I SPECIFICALLY ASKED FOR A TAKEOUT MENU TO ORDER TAKEOUT. INSTEAD OF NOTIFYING ME BEFOREHAND ABOUT NOT ACCEPTING TAKEOUT ORDERS, SHE HANDS ME THE MENU
3) I CONTINUE TO ASK IF TAKEOUT ORDERS COME WITH A COMBO MEAL AND SHE REPLIES ""YES"" & STILL FAILS TO TELL ME THEY ARE NOT ACCEPTING TAKEOUT ORDERS
4) THE TOPPING ON THE CAKE IS HOW SHE MISINFORMED ME ABOUT NO TAKEOUT ORDERS, BC ACCORDING TO THE SHIFT MANAGER ADAM, ITS A 30 MINUTE WAIT

I'm a very patient person. I know a lot about patience from being a special needs mom with a medically fragile child. So it has taught me to take things with a grain of salt. If I was notified before hand the moment I asked for a takeout menu that there will be a 30 minute wait. I would have been perfectly fine with it. But unfortunately, your host Christina was unprofessional! She needs to be trained to greet your customers, especially if they are standing at the host desk directly in front of her. Train her to inform her customers before hand with the correct information. Thanks to her I will no longer dine nor recommend this place.",z_RDFNib0q3iuFLhzweRBA,3,1,1,51sxAYRjB8cTUa6o1VxFFg

All the questions we had about the menu were answered by the waiter and we were all satisfied by what we were all served.

Food: Excellent!
At Jinya, you get exactly what you order. The food met all of my expectations and the presentation of the menu items was spectacular. Our food was all full of flavor and all the items we ordered stayed true to what was described by both our waiter and the menu.

Overall: Willing to return!
The food was excellent, service was spot-on. I am definitely a fan of this ramen restaurant. Definitely worth the money and time. Stop by to this place if you get a chance!",yvqGJqrjeC0AwYs6Oecp0g,2,3,4,bhMBPctnnhUi95gi2clTMA

We've tried going to Jinya a few times but always turn away when we see the lines out the door (at all hours). However, I now know this is misleading because we got seated right away and the place is huge compared to the other ramen spots. Jinya is definitely ""trendier"" than the other places as well, with younger, hipper servers. We sat at the bar which was a tight squeeze and ordered a couple draft Sapporos, Jinya buns, and tempura brussels sprouts to start. All of the above was great and I appreciate the diversity and creativity of their appetizer menu. 

Now we all have a ramen type that we can't help but gravitate towards when going to a new ramen restaurant. For me it's anything SPICY. Sure spicy isn't a flavor profile but I like my ramen spicy, okay? Unfortunately Jinya doesn't offer all of their ramens spicy, they have a few labeled as spicy and I chose the Tonkotsu Spicy and my boyfriend had the Umami Spicy Miso. Given all the new and different types of ramen Jinya offers I shouldn't have gone with something so boring but I did and it was... boring. And not spicy. The miso though was quite good, with a deep peppery taste that was unlike anything I've ever had in a ramen. The ground pork was also great and reminded me of a tan tan men more than a miso ramen. I like that Jinya offers ""unusual"" toppings like garlic and bamboo shoot. I guess I should have branched out a bit more with something like cilantro or sukiyaki ramen because it looks like that's what helps Jinya stand out. I can't say if these variations are gimmicks or if they actually elevate the ramen experience but I guess that's for another time. For now it'll be hard to pry me away from my spicy ramen at Tatsu and Sora now that I've officially tried all the top ramen shops in Vegas.",rYPjqZO89ABei1fsZBSUbA,0,0,4,0m6Bk-vHsnjjl0Bbzh2V2g

Waiter was quick to order and it took forever to get my ramen 30 minutes. Place was half empty.

Inspector made them throw away some eggs in the fridge that were not at the right temperature ( like 75 of them in a sauce/ marinade) but all else seemed cool

We had ditched our usual Ramen house, wanting to try it here due to the good reviews we've heard about this place. However, the wait time took forever even though we were the third one on the waiting list. Those before us were seated along with plenty more that came after us even though there were plenty of seats that could accommodate my family of six.
     When we were finally seated, we were placed on a big table with other customers that made my family sit away from us. I requested to be seated on adjacent booths so at least that way, my family would be closer. My request was denied because it was seen as ""inconvenient"" to the hostess, because it was her job to seat the customers. This small request would require her to move us to different tables. How this small request could be seen as ""inconvenient "" is beyond me. All I asked was to be seated with my family, we were willing to give up our own seats for other parties while we occupy the smaller booths.
     Denied, we sat spread apart, resulting in having to eat with our dampened moods. The food we ate was not as delicious as I heard it was, disappointed with the reviews, and the waiter kept on insisting we try the dessert despite our refusal. Also, they kept on disturbing our eating time by constantly picking up our trash, taking the dishes, and refilling our water  before the cup is even half empty!

My waitress recommended the pork bun to start. At $3.80 it was the most expensive single pork bun I have ordered. It arrived on a small black plate with a toothpick in the center to hold it together.  It ended up being a reasonable size for the high price. The bun was fluffy and unlike most pork belly the meat was lean. It was also very tender but I thought the lettuce in the bun was unnecessary and would have done better with just the cucumber. The sauce did not pack enough punch for me so I mixed the house made ramen sauce and chili sauce to dip the rest of the bun into. 

For my ramen, I decided on the chicken ramen because my waitress said it was her favorite and had just as much flavor as the pork broth without being too rich. She was right, it was the most flavorful chicken ramen broth I have had. It was rich, creamy, but the noodles were too chewy for my taste. 

JINYA ramen has a much better chicken broth than any of the other ramen restaurants I have been to in town. Their three house made sauces are well executed and their diverse menu will bring me back even if I am not in the mood for ramen.",hulIBBzPsCaQDcoh_JgSBA,4,4,4,ryzVDGQ7qX4M4EPi6C1Q_Q

3228825,2016-12-21,0,gx2yPrOJSwF1ApJYdGBWIw,"Really just so so.  There are such super great reviews on this restaurant - my conclusion is that the selection of good ramen places in Vegas are limited and compared to all, they maybe good?

To start with, majority of the patrons (90%) are non Asian, at least at the lunch time we were there, thus my guess is that the reviews are really not the Asian standards of what a good bowl of ramen should be.

It is so great that they have a kids menu.  For $7.50, you get a small bowl of chicken ramen with corn and spinach; 2 crispy chicken, small bowl of chicken and rice, slice of orange, lollipop and a small vanilla ice cream.  I would say that was the highlight of the whole meal.

For the adults, we ordered the Tokyo ramen special, which is just the to tonkatsu (pork) soup base with skinny ramen noodles with cha siu and a soft boiled egg.  If you were to go to an authentic ramen place, they would boil the broth for each table, not just scooped out the broth from a big pot.  At this place, you know they just scooped the broth out and assemble the toppings and bring it to the table.

Out ramen came quick before our appetizers (hint).  The broth was not hot (which it should be).  Disappointed!!!

Now come the food - we ordered the Brussels sprouts tempura, it was really good because they put truffle oil in their tempura batter so it was very fragrant.  The crispy chicken was also tasty.  Authentic Tonkatsu broth should be white or close to it, it was brown so assume they add quiet a bit of soy sauce, which made the broth quiet salty.

Oh and by the way, everyone in the kitchen was non Asian.

OH AND there are no Japanese restaurant (at least not the authentic Japanese restaurant) that will charge you $1 for tea.  Tea or water supposed to be complimentary.  We are not at an American restaurant asking for a cup of tea or coffee that is on the menu.

I highly recommend the Pork Chashu and kimchee tacos! The pork is nice and tender combined with a great crunch from the fried taco shells. The kimchee adds a nice saltiness to the tacos. An order comes with 2 tacos and is a perfect appetizer.

3239855,2017-11-12,0,gx2yPrOJSwF1ApJYdGBWIw,"Wow. Came back here and HUGELY disappointed. JINYA has stopped serving high quality, traditional ramen and instead catered to the masses of non-Japanese people pouring in.

The food- 3 or 4 stars. The tapas are all really good. The tacos are great. The JINYA bun is very special- the bun is AMAZING. However, they switched out the special cucumber and sauce with a ton of lettuce and the beautiful, delicious pork belly was traded out with a tough, tiny pork belly. VERY disappointed. The JINYA  black is good, solid 4 stars, but there are a multitude of other ramen options nearby that are better. 

Service- the wait time was VERY long. Crazy line. Luckily, for 5 people, we were able to sit at the bar. Come before 5 or be prepared to wait anywhere from 30 mins to over an hour. The waiters and staff were fine, pretty nice and standard. Almost none of them were Japanese (none of the cooks) which is a bad sign. It took 45 MINUTES FOR RAMEN. Ramen bars are supposed to be quick, simple restaurants serving authentic food, but instead a much longer, complicated menu takes forever. Also, they seemed to be only making to-go orders! If you're waiting more than 5-10 minutes for your ramen, that's not good. The Tonkotsu Black was good, the Miso Ramen was good, and the chicken buns were good.

For our ramens, we requested Cha cha for garlic lovers, and Karaage chicken which was another Chef's special.  No regrets!  They were ramen-liciously perfect and different.  Broth flavor was nice.  Then the ingredients in the soup added yet more great flavor.  And the noodles are either regular or fat, good texture too.

We still look like out of towners, so I'm not sure if that's why we received such attentive service.  But we loved it.  If that's the case everyone should look like an out of towner.  And you'll want to come in during their happy hours cuz they have TWO happy hour slots.

This restaurant is clean, industrial modern design - very sleek.  Table layout is well planned especially for how the servers need to move about.  It's a tiny space, but due to the floor plan and high ceilings it does not feel cramped.  They play cool lounge music too.  Their menu isn't overwhelming and the Chef's creations are kinds we haven't seen before.

If you're a tourist in Las Vegas, and love ramen and creative fusion, you'll want to bookmark this restaurant.  I have to give 5 stars!  Ambience, lounge music, clean and simple but classy chill atmosphere, great food, serves unique alcohol, two happy hours, splendid service...

We always order chicken karaage   in Japanese restaurants  and Jinya's  is pretty good but  the whole family agrees that yu-yu's  karage is still the best. I do not like the crispy rice tuna , because the soft tuna and the harder crispy rice, just didn't taste right. Anyhow, the takoyaki is the best as other's suggested with the tender octopus inside and crispy outside. I love the homemade tofu, but the dashi sauce might be little too sour.

There's never a line, and they are going to add a drive-thru soon. Service is friendly and fast as well.

We were greeted very nicely and sat right away. We sat at the Ramen Bar. Server was polite and friendly. He sold us a drink they didn't have but was very apologetic about it. Didn't matter to us we were there for Ramen.

I was really hungry so I had the Pork Bao Buns. They weren't the best I've ever had. The pork was just TOO fatty. Flavor was still good. The mayo and the cucumbers on it paired well. Didn't know mayo would be good with Pork. They are $4 for each bun. Good pricing. (I give it a 3/5)

The seaweed salad was 2.80$ and was a massive bowl. Really healthy and great portion size. Can even eat for an appetizer or side. It is inevitable you will always have seaweed salad stuck in your teeth lol. (I give it a 5/5)

The Ramen was great. I kind of customized my own because I'm THAT guy lol. I got thin noodles, Tonkotsu broth, cabbage and 3 eggs. I love eggs in my Ramen and they cooked them perfectly, plus they were so tasty.  I suggest adding more eggs to yours because it only comes with one. (I give it a 4/5)

First off, they are already $11 and don't include many common ingredients like bamboo shoots or egg.  Then they add in weird ramen ingredients like spinach that you can't replace without being charged an extra $1-2.  But past that, the broth was bland and not even remotely spicy even though I asked for extra hot.  Then I was charged an extra $0.50 for making it ""hot"" on top of that.

Theres a ramen bar, comminal table and a few booths/banquets for seating options in the restaurant.  

The menu is pretty simple.  I tried the ""Premium Tonkotsu White Ramen"" which was probably my favorite in comparison to the popular ""Tonkotsu Black Ramen."" The difference in broth is that the black only contains pork broth and the white has a mixture of both pork and chicken broth. To describe the difference taste wise? The black seemed a bit more rich than the white... and as a personal preferance, I don't like my broth too think or rich.  The Tonkotsu White was perfect for me! I also tried their Takoyaki, which was amazingly delicious! Their ""Jinya Pork Bun"" was ok, I've tasted better, but I didnt despise it.  I love their ""Pork Chasu Bowl"" very much!

The ramen was ok, it was light and the noodles were chewy but nothing spectacular. The service was great though and the staff was very nice.


The time I went for dinner, the place was starting to get busy, luckily I kind of beat the crowd. The lady at the door took our names down without a greeting or a smile or any eye contact.

Granted I was sitting under the ac vent and I was freezing my butt off so I think that may have something to do with it. The sad thing is my friend and husband got extra noodles so it got cold on the table and when they added it to the cold broth, it was just not ok. 

Note to restaurant: majority of the ramen joints that offer extra noodles bring it out a little later so the noodles don't get cold, hard and stuck together while your finishing the bowl.

A couple times I've had horrible luck with service ... one time my waitress was just down right dismissive and rude, I can say I am a polite person and always respect staff wherever I dine/spend my time. This specific time I ended up requesting a new waitress and everything was fine. 

Another more recent occasion that disappointed me was when I ordered some take out. I was having issues with their phone number, it was saying it was disconnected for a while, but eventually I got through, much to my relief  

I ordered and was told it would take about 20 minutes. I went in 15 minutes later and the young woman at the front podium told me it would be another 20 minutes. I was a little surprised. 

Anyways I step out for a couple minutes and come back sooner than she said in hopes maybe it was ready. I go inside and I see my order bagged up and sitting on the shelf ready to go, yay! I asked the woman if my food was ready and she again told me no it would take longer, not bothering to check if the food that was ready was even mine. 

 Anyways 10 minutes goes by she finally looks at the tag/receipt on the bag and she called my name, and was like oh it's ready now. She acted as if I hadn't been standing there for almost 15 minutes staring at the food. I was annoyed, I could have been home eating it by then. And it wasn't super busy either.

The ramen and food are still great, which is the only reason I have it at 3-stars. Everything else has deteriorated.

The ambience inside has changed. They now play loud club-like music making a conversation with the person next to you very difficult. They always have a long wait, around plus 45 minutes, good for them, not good for you. Because of this, I started doing pick-up orders, but they consistently mess up the orders and their phone lines are commonly disconnected for hours at a time. 

Their pick-up times have increased as well, 10 minutes to a 50 minutes wait to pick-up your order. One time I waited an hour to get my order, and they left me waiting at the front register for another 15 minutes.

Their service used to be amazing. It's not the worst now, but definitely less than amazing. You won't be disappointed, unless you are talking to the host, the long waits, poor line management and the phone service is lacking there.",uso43PtZRUPcYxgxs12U1g,1,0,3,MlWnyGXZoScbKgkxygEEDQ

I found the pork broth to be heavy and filling in the best way. Creamy umami permeates the entire bowl and delivers satisfaction with the perfect amount of salty-ness. Speaking of perfect, i have to mention the temperature of the dish which was, perfect. The only thing worse than cold ramen is losing taste buds right out of the gate!

Add to this slightly aldente noodles and flaky, delightfully seasoned pork and you have a serious contender for Vegas' best ramen. I can't wait to return for more of the small yet exciting menu.

I just wish they would either make their pork slices thicker or even have more than just two flimsy pieces.  But other than that, amazing!

The gyozas are always delish.  This trip, I also ordered the Spicy Creamy Shrimp Tempura and OMG, I think I just had an orgasm in my mouth!  At first I was obsessed with the seasoned egg, now the spicy creamy shrimp tempura has taken its place.

Growing up in Japan and eating ramen frequently from different shops, I like to say that I'm pretty particular when it comes to ramen. 

I had the karaage ramen. It was definitely different from what I'd usually have but it was either ramen and karaage or karaage ramen. I chose the latter obviously. I also had them add am egg and corn to my ramen which is a little extra in cost but that's typical from ramen joints. The chicken soaked up some of the broth which added extra flavor to the chicken. It still had somewhat of a crispy outside and still was good with beer. Oh! If you didn't know already karaage in Japan is usually eaten with beer. It's like the Japanese equivalent to bar food. The ramen was perfect as far as not being too soft or too hard which is always a plus! I'm sure if you ask they'll make it the way you like it but I like that perfect in between. 

I forgot how much my bill was but it was exactly as I expected as far as cost to quality/service. The service was spot on and I wasn't bothered too much or too little.

I ordered the garlic ramen which was tasty, though a bit oily. Noodle were not bad, though still not quite the level of chewiness I desire most. The broth was salty (most ramen broths are) but flavorful.

FOOD 
Appetizer - Taoyaki: We started off with one order of the takoyaki. The bread was soft and the octopus was a little chewy, but not so much that it was inedible. 

Ramen - JINYA Tonkostu Black:  The broth was garlicky from the garlic oil, and the fried onions actually go well with the other ingredients. Though the broth was decent, I was expecting a richer, meaty flavor. Thin noodles were a pleasant change from the thicker variety. A downside about my ramen was the globs of fat from the pork chashu. 

Ramen - Spicy Miso Ramen (Special of the Day): This was what my boyfriend ordered. The broth was mild and not as spicy as expected. It doesn't come with a marinated egg. To me that's like serving a burger without the fries. 

RESTAURANT
I was concerned that we'd have to wait for a table to open up, but 4PM on a Saturday afternoon was mellow with only several diners. Hip and contemporary, the restaurant is accommodating and has plenty of seating available.

They should have indicated on their menu that this is spicy.  I wasn't too please with this.  And for the price of over $10 a bowl of ramen, I think they should be able to at least cut the hanjuku egg in half and make the bowl look more presentable.

Happy hour specials are the way to go if you're dining on a budget. For $3 you can get a decent cut of pork belly covered in a sauce that balances sweet and tanginess in their Jinya bun.

On their regular menu the Jinya No.1 tonkotsu black ($10.55) is a medium-sized bowl filled with a creamy pork broth with just enough heat to clear the sinuses. They'll let you substitute thick noodles for the typical thin ones if you'l like. The single, large slice of pork in the bowl had enough fat to deliver a blast of savory-sweet flavor with each bite.

Service was friendly and informative. I also admire them for denying alcohol to a belligerent customer too drunk to make a coherent sentence. As long as it isn't me, I'm completely ok with that.",C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w,6,3,4,haiYGwxR1n8wiq9uwzyKhg

Pros: the pig ear chicharon, the crispy rice with spicy tuna, and the tonkotsu black ramen with extra pork. All absolutely delicious! I've been here multiple times and I've tried many things on the menu but I narrowed it down to 3 favorites to avoid this review being too long. The pig ear chicharon was fried absolutely perfectly and the poached egg gave it a little something extra but didn't overpower the dish. The crispy rice was perfectly crispy and we got a second order since it was happy hour. 
If you're solo dining and sitting at the counter you're right by the kitchen and you can talk to the chefs. They're super friendly and knowledgeable about the food they're putting out 

Con: I understand that sometimes they get busy, which is good otherwise they wouldn't be open. But your hostess shouldn't be bussing tables. I've been in here on a couple occasions and at times I've had to wait over 10 minutes to even get greeted because she's clearing tables. The hostess should be doing standard side work such as cleaning menus and rolling silverware, so that if customers come in she can greet them right away. If I didn't like the food so much I would have walked out. Also, more than 1 POS system might be good for efficiency

At first I was a little uncomfortable because I thought the toilet had a bidet then I warmed up to the idea.. See what I did there?!

Let's get down to business. Let me start off by saying I was not hungry when I stepped through the door. As we waited, I noticed how busy it was and the hostesses said 20 minutes is nothing. They also said that sometimes there is a 2 hour wait and mentioned how much people enjoy Jinya. As we were seated, I noticed how they do not have TV's set up and seat you at a giant table.

We came at the right time because it was happy hour and they have a decent amount of food to choose from. I got kimchi tacos. They were enjoyable but a little too salty for my taste. The list of ramen had my mouth watering at that point. I got the Cha Cha Cha. It was delightful because of how garlicky it was. My favorite thing on the menu had got to be the noodle refill.

The restaurant is bigger on the inside than it looks on the outside. There are regular tables, a bar, and a big table in the middle, at which customers sit with other random customers. Jinya may be a little on the dimly lit side, but then I guess that's the atmosphere they're going for as a barstaurant. The servers are speedy, helpful, and friendly. Drinks are kept refilled and orders are taken immediately. The cooking time is also reasonable. I've never had to wait longer than 13 minutes for my order, regardless of how busy the place was.

And then of course, there is the ramen. Sweet, sweet Jinya ramen. The egg is one of my favorite parts. It is cooked just enough for it to be solid on the outside and smooth and soft on the inside - just the way I love it! Each serving of ramen comes with thick well-cooked noodles and plenty of meat, no short-selling there. Actually, can we talk about how the prices are crazy low for the huge portions of ramen that are served here? I have never come out of this restaurant anything less than full. In fact, I sometimes wish I had a little more room left for dessert, that's how big the portions are.  

My only gripe about this place are the windows: The one time I was here during noon, the sun was shining through the windows so badly that my friends were practically blinded throughout their entire meal. I'd love if this place adjusted their blinds a little so that wouldn't happen to people sitting on the window side during lunch.

3559893,2014-08-27,0,gx2yPrOJSwF1ApJYdGBWIw,"I'm giving it 5 stars because I think they are the best in town.  

Broth:  Tonkotsu Black is the one to get.  It's the most savory broth in town, better than both Monta and Sora (although Sora doesn't have Tonkotsu).  The flavor isn't from the excess salt but truly savory pork.  

Pork:  Perfect mix of lean and fat.  Similar to the one at Monta but slightly less fattier.

Noodle:  I usually order the thick noodle.  I wasn't impressed during my first visit because part of the noodle was clumped together...but it was perfect during my second visit.

Appetizers: 
Pork belly bun is very good with generous portion of very fatty pork belly...I'm craving for it as I'm typing.
Takoyaki is surprisingly good.  Good flavor and texture.  The egg salad at the bottom is also very tasty.
Fried Brussel Sprouts:  Nicely breaded with good mild flavor.
Fried Chicken:  Also pretty good, tender, crispy, and flavorful

Caution:  I'm not a big fan of the spicy sauce.  It's okay in moderation, but the flavor is too strong that it changes the taste of the savory broth.  I'd stay away from the Tonkatsu Spicy.  Or at least try the Tonkatsu Black first then decide for yourself.  

Overall:  Every item we tried has been great.  Good Service.

Suggestions:  Please consider opening for lunch!!!  And I think adding more variety of veggies will make it better (Sora does a good job on that).",-p2ISrtcOFS87T2pkyIaNw,1,1,5,xqBIDoNZrQYgnEo9wEXFBg

Husband and I arrived around 11:15pm with about 8 parties ahead of us. We were given a wait time of 20-25 mins, no big deal. The big deal lies in the fact that, come 11:45pm, the two girls handling the front took their sweet time in seating patrons. I counted, there were about 12 available open seats, with a large waiting list, yet the staff didn't seem phased at all.

About 11:52pm, we were finally seated. Our waitress was probably the worst part of the experience. It was very apparent she didn't want to be working. She literally looked pissed. She dryly took our orders and hardly ever returned to check on us. I asked her for the red chili flakes, she said okay, only to ignore me and not fulfill the request. 

By now, we just wanted to finish our food and leave. They blast house music, yet most of the staff really just look depressed and not happy to be working at all. The food itself is alright. I ordered the spicy chicken mild. It was indeed mild. I couldn't even taste any spiciness. My husband ordered the Jinya chicken. The broth had a heavy eggy flavor to it. I live in San Diego and am spoiled with ramen places like Tajima's. So, this particular ramen place didn't do much for me. 

Back to our experience, we finish our food, and literally have to go out of way to flag our waitress for the check. When we do, we hand her our credit card, thinking she's just going to go and take care of the payment. Of course, we were wrong. We see her walking around the restaurant. After about 5 minutes, my husband is now just irritated with the whole experience so far, he goes to the front only to find the card just sitting on the front podium. The hostess didn't acknowledge it and hasn't even taken care of the bill! My husband had to tell her our waitress dropped this but apparently didn't give further instruction nor cared enough to follow up on it. Only then did the hostess check us out. 


Overall, the food is mediocre, but the experience is in dire need of improvement. Management, either take care of your employees or instruct them not to kill your customers vibe!

I came here seeing it was a new ramen joint, it's definitely spacious inside with a nice ambience. The staff and service was great. The bathroom was clean although they do not have paper towels as an option only air dryer. We got here around 8 and only 1/3 of the restaurant was filled. 

I ordered a Tokyo tonkotsu ramen combination with their crispy chicken (3 pieces) and side salad while my girlfriend got a Tokyo tonkotsu ramen as well, both with thin noodles. I added corn for $1 while my girlfriend added chicken dumplings (2 pieces) $2. The side salad was mediocre, if I'd known I woulda just skipped the combination and just got a 5 piece crispy chicken for an extra $1. The crispy chicken was better than most places that I've tried. Now if you think Monta's tonkotsu ramen is salty then this place's broth might be for you as it is not as heavy/thick as Monta's. The chashu was more lean not much flavor, I like a fatty chashu like Monta's. There were not many options on adding your own spice, however the fresh garlic was a nice touch. The thin noodles were different from Monta's but still good.

Over all this has got to be my second favorite ramen place in Vegas, I will probably come back and try a different type of ramen, maybe their spicy chicken.",TzJoojcNGG41zwiUYO3AuQ,3,2,4,pROVuf3Gu77bTY53nqS7KA

Nice open space with a communal dining table in the center, Jinya sports a hip modern vibe with cool beats blasting out the speakers.

We started off with a Jinya Bun, Mini Chashu Bowl, and the Tempura Brussels Sprouts with Truffle Oil.The bun was very tasty, and the sprouts were delicious too, things we'd probably order again. However, the Chashu Bowl IMO doesn't top the one found at Ramen Sora even though Jinya's version is a tad bit bigger with a soft boiled egg.

Our waiter suggested the seasonal Chicken-Lime & Cilantro Ramen, so we split that. Although the flavors were good.

Las Vegas has been getting pretty wise these recent years, with it being the hot destination spot for ramen restaurants to open. Its crazy to think that a few years equal to the number of fingers on your hand there was only a handful percentage of residents who knew ramen beyond its instant form? In current day its the hottest thing, always in the spotlight in the local magazines, like its a trend. Thankfully it'll never die out like cupcakes or cronuts. 

Jinya is the NEWEST and TRENDIEST of the ramen residents, a franchise with locations in places like California and Texas. Two pages of variety include ramen that can be suited for the carnivorous cravings and vegetarians with their Vegetable Broth Ramen. Ordering in combinations ($4-5) such as gyoza and chasu bowls will get you the best bang for your fairly spendy meal. It wouldn't be trendy without the tapas available of course. The Jinya Bun ($3.80) is a pork steam bun is worth a try (once) if you like steam buns but do pass on the kaarage or crispy chicken. I assume its called Jinya Ramen BAR because they offer various brews, many delicious Japanese beers that aren't widely available. It seems pricey, but trust that the liquor store pricing is not far off, must be the importing. 

So the ramen... unfortunately I am not a fan of the four that I've tried. I blame Brittany Murphy. Her awful acting in ""Ramen Girl"" really had me thinking about the soul and heart that true artisans put in their ramen and at Jinya I just don't feel it. I'm probably just crazy though. The Tonkotsu Black and premium white broth's both have a sour finish to me. The garlic chips have a fishy taste, but that could just be me. I enjoy the taste of the chicken broth over the pork here and am much appreciative of the variety that Jinya offers.

Maybe ""Ramen Girl"" was onto something, Sorry Jinya I think there's gotta be more heart and something else beyond the dim lighting, the bidets, the iPad ordering, sushi, the 350k franchise opportunity, and community seating.",kDGhswMrYIOaFJAViW_nCA,8,5,3,myusjssiFLaGqYubUSb8gg

I got to Vegas at 11:40 pm , and after checking in my hotel, I figured not too many good restaurants were still open. Luckily, JINYA opened until 3 AM, so i made a trip there.

Surprisingly, there were still lots of people waiting in front of the restaurant at 12:30 AM, and I also had to wait 30 minutes before I was seated.

Quality wise, the ramen was decent. I had the Tonkotsu black ramen. The broth was decent, the meat was decent. Every thing was decent. Not too bad and not very good in my opinion. The roasted seaweed was not crunchy so that was a minus.

3666555,2014-08-03,8,gx2yPrOJSwF1ApJYdGBWIw,"ooooooooooooooooooooOOOOOOOOOOOOooooooooh, a place sooo good, I had to review it right when I woke up the next day.

Friends from LA had been telling us about Robata Jinya opening its sister restaurant here in Vegas...and thanks to foodie friend on IG, we saw that it finally opened.

The roomie immediately ""dragged"" me here specifically for their shrimp toast as Robata's shrimp toast is his ultimate fave food.
I, on the otherhand, was looking forward to trying their ramen (it is a ramen bar, afterall).

Got here around 10pm, and it was fairly slow with half the place filled. Nice décor with a large table in the middle; perfect for larger parties. You could tell that it just opened as there was still decorators tape on the mirrors and walls.

Sat down and was gladly seated by the waitress and she was very informative on the menu and what they're known for.
Roomie immediately ordered the shrimp toast but, it was sadly sold out --- lemme tell you that the roomie was like, ""ohkaaay, lets leave!"" lol

We settled on fried chicken, shrimp balls, truffle fries, veggie ramen, and two combo orders of the #1 tonkatsu black ramen with charshu and Tokyo curry bowls.

Fried chicken - Nice batter on the chicken, juicy, and VERY good with or without it's ponzu dipping sauce.

Shrimp balls - First thought when biting into this deliciously crunchy cream cheese filled morsel: it tastes like shrimp chips!!!!! All you/us Asians know about shrimp chips! YUM =)

Truffle fries - Can never go wrong with anything truffle but, I just couldn't get enough of the truffle ketchup =)))))))

Tonkatsu black ramen - My new favorite as the ""thin"" noodles were al dente and just to my liking. Broth wasn't salty at all which is extra to my liking cuz I'm not into salty/miso flavors. Broth was, also, light and not too heavy which made it easier to finish the whole bowl. The mushrooms and garlic chips added the extra crunch which is always delicious. Sadly, they were out of egg so didn't add egg to these ramens; but, added extra charshu instead -- I ain't mad at that.
I really liked the charshu in the ramen yet, the charchu bowl was very whatever.
Their Tokyo curry rice was sweet and I don't like sweet curry. I was hoping for a more spicier version. (((((so, on that aspect - no one is touching Ramen Sora's curry and charshu bowls!)))))

Veggie ramen - Roomie found it but, thought there was tooo much veggies in there and the broth was rather bland. 


Overall, a new favorite and I'd gladly come here again and, hopefully, soon!
Especially since I still have yet to try their shrimp toast!

What?? Why would three people that came in after us already have their food just because she had to manually put in our order? After that we watched her and somebody else scrambling to find our order. The truth is that our order completely got lost in the shuffle and they had just started working on it, which I understand happens but at least be honest about it instead of making something up lying to us. Honesty Integrity goes a long way. When the food finally did come out another 15 minutes later it was only for half of us and the rest of us got our food another 10 to 15 minutes after that. My son's kids meal which is supposed to come with a Ramen as well, was completely forgotten and he was never served.  The whole experience was really frustrating and I won't be back.

Im a big fan of tonkotsu ramen and their JINYA tonkotsu black is very good. The only thing I didnt like was that their chashu was a little too brittle. I understand they want it to be tender, but theres a difference from fall of the bone tender and brittle like crumbs. The flavor was very good and the egg was soft boiled just right.

Also had their chashu bowl, but it suffered from having the same brittle chashu from the ramen. You may like it, but I prefer the chashu bowls from places like Shin Sen Gumi, Santouka or Fujin.

Their takoyaki was also very good. It was served on some sort of egg sauce. Probably shouldnt have ordered it as we already had way too much food.

I think the only 2 things I didnt like was the chashu and that I felt the price was like $1 higher for everything then it should have been. Would definitely come back.",rXKDacl16S2RtmUiyYpN3A,0,0,4,X79HrJj0lXYOJ85wu9nsUA

This is one restaurant chain that's actually pretty good. Coming from the Bay Area and after experiencing one of the worst meal at the Chef of the Century ""chain"" restaurant, I was very leery when we sat down and found out that Jinya is a chain.

We were greeted with a smile by the hostess and led to a nice table for 4 for the two of us. We sat for a little while examining their menu to decide what to eat. Our waitress came to ask if we were ready to order, but since we were deciding and taking pictures, we told her ""not yet"" and she left us alone without any attitude.

We ordered the following:

1. Jinya No.1 Tapas: Chashu pork bun, pretty juicy piece of pork on a Chinese style bun. 

2. Jinya No. 1 Ramen: Tonkotsu Black, thin ramen noodle served with three slices of pork chashu, Kikurage, green onions, dried Nori (seaweed), seasoned egg, garlic chips, garlic oil and fried onions in a pork broth. Very savory broth with just a hint of spice with just the right amount of accompliments, for slurping those perfectly done ramen noodles.

So our appetizers came out 5 minutes after ordering we thought cool it's pretty fast. We finished our appetizers and waited for our bowls. 

We sat there talking and waiting... it was 3:30pm, we looked around and everyone after us was getting their bowls of ramen.

Since they have only 1 vegetarian/vegan option, I had to order their vegetable ramen. It was pretty good, the noodle was too thin and tasted more like somen noodle though. I found it interesting that they put salad vegetables on the ramen so I felt like eating ramen and salad at the same time. lol

Actually I liked their takoyaki more than the ramen. It was definitely one of the best takoyaki I have ever tried in my life. Outside was so crispy but inside was chewy... Yum!

The service was good too. They came to bring water every 10 minutes.

My bowl tasted so good! It was full of flavor and boy am I a garlic lover! Deeelicious! I thought the soup was lacking quantity because it wasn't covering the noodles and pork chashu completely and I tend to like my soup really.. well soupy! 

The chashu pork bowl was good as well and it was just the right size. Not so much to make you full but enough that you'll want more. Salad was ok, I can't put my finger on what the dressing is made from. The Tonkatsu bowl was really good a little kick to it.

Good options of Ramen. Worth the wait each time. 

One thing though- I always get the Cha Cha Cha for garlic lovers. The server today wouldn't sub my thick noodles with thin. All the other times (and I've been here a total of around ten) I was able to. The other servers were awesome at catering to my request, despite what the menu stated. This particular server was so quick to say no to the request, it ruined my experience today. 

I didn't catch her name- she was a short thin Asian female with short hair. The description doesn't really help. Avoid this server at all costs. Very rude and not welcoming. All the other servers and hosts are phenomenal, esp. the males. I'm sad I didn't get this server's name.

Back to Jinya Ramen:  There are 7 Jinya locations in California. This is the first one in Nevada. There are none in Hawaii. What does this mean? 

Answer: I need to eat ramen with Twinsie at Jinya Las Vegas.

It was a bit chilly outside since it's November - a good atmosphere for a warm dish. I ordered the Pig Ears (JINYA No. 2 Chicharron) to share,  but I had difficulty eating it because it sadly had some firey hot sauce (harissa) on it.  I did enjoy a few bites of its crunchy goodness and some of the fried kale and soft tamago (egg) that accompanied it!  Mmmm! 

Twinsie smartly ordered the Takoyaki...oh wow!  Pop one of those tako balls in your mouth and enjoy! !  The texture of the octopus was a ""just right"" chewy - not mushy nor rubbery! 

I had the Tonkotsu Assari because it had THICK noodles. The other goodies included the kikurage (aka black fungus), pork chashu, & seasoned egg. YUM!!!  The variety of ingredients was fun so that I wasn't bored! Chewing on al dente noodles makes me happy! 

Some readers may not like this part, but I MUST mention it because it was a ""BAM"" moment for me: the HEATED toilet seat in the restroom!!!  Now remember - in the beginning - that I mentioned that it was a chilly November in Las Vegas. ..I mean like in the 40s...  Yeah.  It's a rare thing to find anything heated in Hawaii. ..like a car seat.  So, I really notice and appreciate little thoughtful gestures such as this!  First of all, the restroom is very dim. I guess it's supposed to be a calming atmosphere?  Anyway. ..just sit down and relax! None of that cold, ""wake up suddenly"", shocking kind of feeling. ..but very gentle and soothing! Ahhhh... hahaha! 

So, I'm looking forward to another Jinya visit. ..wondering if all locations have this special customer treatment?  ;)  Thanks to Twinsie for such a memorable lunch!  Luv ya!!",Ggx8iUdJ7lsQSqXRuclXtg,30,31,4,715_mnks6z7Br5FR505DSQ
3860242,2016-01-19,0,gx2yPrOJSwF1ApJYdGBWIw,"I'm new to the world of ramen so I will say that my opinions are  not based on a refined or cultured palate, lol.

Went in for dinner, the hostess seated us promptly, and the servers were very quick to place our order and bring out our items. One was nice enough to ask if it was our first time there, which it was, so she explained the menu a bit. That was very nice. The actual restaurant is very clean, modern, and very pretty compared to hole in the wall places. The bathroom even has those super modern toilets that have seat warmers and the lid goes up on its' own lol! So cool!

We ordered the fried chicken and salmon roll for appetizers and the spicy chicken ramen and the wonton chicken ramen. The fried chicken was among the best I have ever had from anywhere. I highly recommend it! The salmon roll but was pretty standard to any sushi restaurant. The ramen noodles were thin, and explained in the menu, so that was a little different. I prefer the thicker cut noodles but no harm done. It said in the menu so you can't be surprised by it. My wonton soup tasted like any wontons. Enjoyable but won't send you off into another dimension, lol. 

For 2 bowls and 2 appetizers,  the bill was about $36 so reasonable prices as well. I will definitely go back but I do feel like other ramen places might have more flavor. Or, again, maybe this is the correct way to make ramen? I feel bad commenting as I know nothing of the preparations of ramen...this is just my opinion. :-)

I did, however, end up getting pretty sick almost immediately while eating. I was on an empty stomach so I know it was the food there. HOWEVER I have a very sensitive stomach, especially to new foods, and the other person I went with ate everything I did and they were fine so I definitely do not blame the restaurant. I just recommend coming in with a good solid stomach lol.",TXZRWst2LMfaKRGF4DAxDA,0,0,4,s46kkfjPW8YORsc6bhxrPQ

The flavor of the broth was pretty decent and not overly salty. I ordered it ""hot"" but wasn't really impressed with the spice level. Disclaimer: I have a really high tolerance for spicy food. The seasoned egg was boiled to perfection with the yolk still runny. The chashu here is really tender and almost melts in your mouth. The service here blows.

But most of my co workers love to come here at least once a week after a long shift at work so this time I decided to come through. I was pretty impressed at how the place was set up. It was a very social setting with all tables kind of close and they had this huge square tables in the middle you could share with other patrons. The lighting was new and elegant and dimmed perfectly for the time of the night it was. My friend and I were the last to join the table. We saw them so we decided to just roll ride over without really talking to the hostess. Something I generally still wait for out of courtesy but my friend darted over there so I was like okay I'll follow (sorry hostess). I sat down in the seat next to our friends and my section of the table had sake spilled all in front of me and finished plates to my right. I was like oh it's ok like I sat myself this is obviously my fault. I didn't give them proper time to clean this up before I sat....BUT unfortunately it sat there for 20 more minutes as I sat there. I even got my order taken and it wasn't taken away.  I decided to stack up all the plates and cups for them nicely and push it to the right seat of me which was empty. And then I wiped the table with this napkin I also found laying around next to the plates and finally wiped all the sake off my area. I'm not sure if this was them punishing me for seating myself or maybe they just didn't see it but whatever I recognize half of it is my fault for seating early so you still get 4 stars. I would of gave you 5 even if someone picked it up in 10 minutes of me sitting. I'm pretty fair. The food was awesome by the way. And I recommend the Coedo Shiro beer.

I came here right when they opened. I noticed it started to fill up about the time we left, 4. 

I decided on the black ramen combo, which came with a salad and another side. I chose Chashu pork. The ramen broth was nice and light. I really enjoyed the thin noodles. This bowl was huge too. As I was eating, I felt like it kept refilling itself like in Harry potter. There was a good amount of meat, but not too much. The Chashu pork was also delicious! I absolutely loved the egg that came with it. The combo is definitely a bang for your buck kind of deal

3-5 is when they have happy hour. I didn't actually get anything off the happy hour menu, but I'd be down to come back and try it sometime.

I had the namesake tonkotsu black ramen while my friend got the spicy chicken ramen. Now, don't get me wrong; I love garlic, but I just wasn't a fan of the garlic flavor here. And the garlic taste was so overpowering and the broth was also so salty that it completely covered up everything else. To be honest, I couldn't even have told you it was tonkotsu base - that's how crazily garlic-ky and salty it was. To top it off, my broth was lukewarm, so I'm not even sure what they were doing in the kitchen. Even at the bottom of my bowl, I doubt the broth was even 120F.

My friend's spicy chicken ramen was much, much better. It wasn't overly salty and the broth had a nice creamy and smooth feel to it, and it worked really well with the spiciness.

I also really liked the iced green tea, which seemed like it was actually brewed tea. Super tasty and refreshing.

So yeah, if I decide to come back - I would definitely go for the spicy ramen or maybe the namesake white. But the tonkotsu black was enough of a disaster that I'm not really enthused about the prospect.",65Bcz8_Rbbrcz_HGpq9Y-g,0,0,3,MTrNHnX4jzgGddfXE48FzA

This has been a bookmarked place for many months since I drove by on Flamingo and read the Yelp reviews especially from Philip T, Leonel M, Candace C.

I dropped a friend at McCarran and then made it across the Strip and here in good time.  I arrived just about 6 PM and stood there like a jerk!  One of the people waiting told me to sign the sheet on a stand.  This is the way you get ""in line.""  The restaurant is small with about 5 seats at the bar, tables on three sides, and a large square table in the center around which there are about 20 seats for more communal dining.  Being solo, that was fine for me.

Having checked the menu in advance, I had decided not to get ramen but to concentrate on two or three of Jinya's small plates.  I ordered a Jinya bun--pork chasu with cucumber, sauce, and Jinya's kewpie mayo on a bao bun.  The sandwich was good.  I also got the smallest order--5 pieces--of crispy chicken.  What a nice breading for these chicken pieces.  Take care to let them cool a bit because the chicken is fiercely hot inside when first served.  Finally, I had asked the server if I could get a half order of takoyaki and she said they don't normally do it but she'd order it for me.  Instead of 6 pieces, I got 3 wonderfully flavored octopus rounds with a wonderful sauce.  (Thanks for the heads up, Philip!)  Rounding out the meal, I got the panna cotta for dessert.  The graham cracker squares gave a good texture to the panna cotta.  It was a good, light choice to end the meal.

When I left at about 7 PM, there was a long line.  Be prepared to wait or come earlier.  Next time I'll get ramen!",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,17,16,4,XHRNIzu1CSv-O-gw3griKA

Garlic Ramen: I was in love with this dish. The thick ramen in this matched perfectly well with the soup garlicy tonkotsu and overall was super super flavorful. I couldn't believe how amazing the flavor was in the broth. Mine also came with a full soft boiled egg that was cooked to perfection. Runny, thick yoke and soy sauce flavored outside. The chasu was also bomb!!!! So flavorful and tender.

Karaage: Huge pieces. We got 5 pieces and expected them to be such tiny pieces, but noooo. These were huge, about the size of a golfball or bigger. The flavor of it was ok. Not enough marinade to make it so flavorful, but it was good because hey, it's fried food.

Takoyaki: loved loved loved this appetizer. Comes with 6 balls and each made excellent. I can't really describe the flavor of it, but it definitely tasted authentic like I've eaten in Japan. Maybe it shined with the octopus flavor that is usually lacking in other places' takoyaki. Not sure. But presentation was great, didn't want to eat it cuz it was so pretty.

As for the scenery, it has a dark Japanese bar feel. They played modern top 40/EDM music, which didn't really fit the setting, but it was enjoyable. There isn't a ton of seating, and I would not recommend a huge party. This is probably why it took forever to get seated.

Then seeing a couple cuddling/holding hands got me wondering, ""where am I? Why am I here?"" I felt out of place but soon realized I was just there to eat a bowl of ramen. 

Oh.

SERVICE
Casual and prompt. Based on few visits, service here can be hit or miss. On my very first visit, we were the only one there yet we waited over 40min. Our server got off his shift in a middle of serving us so he ditched our table completely. What was even better was that kitchen staff threw away our order=reason why we didn't get any of our order. 

FOOD
First off, Jinya Bun from their appetizer is a MUST. Fluffy bun with super tender, mouth-watering meat inside. 

Tonkotsu Assari (~$9): ""Assari"" refers to something light/not too heavy. Broth was flavorful, albeit too salty and oily for my liking. I didn't see anything ""assari"" about the broth.  Noddle was thick and had a chew. One and only thing I liked about my bowl of ramen was the egg.

I still like Ramen Sora all the way. They have everything down to perfection, from service to their always amazingly delicious ramen. Jinya is open late so might stop by in the future for late night ramen fix.",mEzc6LeTNiQgIVsq3poMbg,5,5,3,UaofA-VqYceMAZtKJ3z98Q

I don't always like to rate a place unless I've gone on multiple occasions, but I do sometimes when I feel like I tried enough of the food.

Jinya is within the China Town area of Las Vegas right off the strip on Tropicana. The plaza it's in isn't the best looking one in Vegas, and neither is the outside of the establishment. The restaurant itself is modern inside and very clean. The one gripe I have with the decor is the huge community table in the middle of the space.

Jinya is a Japanese restaurant that specializes in ramen. With this huge surge in ramen joints the last few years I see Jinya standing the test of time. They have a great menu with many different ramen with varying flavor profiles and spice levels. They also have a bunch of tasty appetizers. 

I'm a classic ramen type of person: I like a savory broth with tons of flavor & some corn for some sweetness. 

I suggest taking your time reading the menu and figuring out what sounds best to you. A unique choice I enjoyed was their sukiyaki ramen with poached egg. An appetizer I'd recommend is their takoyaki. It's become such a popular dish, but theirs is served with egg salad underneath-such a good flavor combination. 

Jinya only had a handful of people working their floor, but they're incredibly attentive and nice. I love how they have some starter dishes for around $5/$6 bucks. I thought Jinya was just hype, but I really enjoyed myself and their food.",pZ6P_1V-bTSoYG1fg1TXzw,4,1,5,yWrgJ2CSNdAKYNBGEcf3DQ

4. The ramen has a really great taste. I think the broth is stronger/creamier than other places, and it comes with more accoutrements inside.


The price is a little higher (I think I paid $10.50 for my bowl), but that's mostly because it came with some kind of toasted garlic, a whole hardboiled egg, seaweed, pork, and a couple other veggies. Overall, I think the price is probably comparable for what you get.

I really can't believe that it took me this long to review JINYA. The girlfriend and I hit this place up on the very first day they opened their doors. JINYA was empty and service was fantastic that day. Service is still great, but dang, the lines are out the door.  We tried almost every side item and of course, the ramen.  There's so many options here that it's very easy to be undecided on what to get.  My favorite was their Tonkotsu Black Ramen w/2 extra eggs and extra seaweed. I love the noodles and the creamy broth.  What makes JINYA so good is their consistency.  The taste, textures, and portions are always on point.  But if you ask what I enjoy the most here, it's their Chicken Chashu Bowl.  I will get this with an extra side of chicken and some extra eggs.  This is a ""must try"" if you're here and want something other than ramen.  It's so good.  I will usually get the small with very little rice and pack on the extra proteins. That's how it's done, folks.  No Ramen, No Life!  That's their motto. My JINYA motto...""No Chicken, No Life"".

 

TIP #1:  Long waits because everyone loves JINYA

TIP #2:  Happy Hour Menu is from 3:00 PM to 5:00 PM (super deals on side items)

TIP #3:  Please caption your photos.  Even my fork pictures have captions. I hate showing our server a picture on Yelp and telling them ""I want this. I don't know what it is, but I want this"".  Please Yeeps!! Captions!!!!

My date is not big on ramen, but he did try my food and he agreed it was good. It is something he would order and eat in the future visits.  The soup base was very good,  which I feel determines the major of the flavor with ramen as other noodles such as Pho.

It's located in a freestanding building on the parking lot of shopping center,  so there's lots of free parking.

The actual building is a bit weird, looks like it used to be a small drive-thru place, but they obviously no longer utilize that drive-thru window and the entrance is on the side of the store facing the strip.

There was no wait for a party of 3, we opted to sit at the large communal table in the middle. The restaurant is fairly dim and quiet inside. I ordered the Jinya Tonkotsu Black, without kikurage (mushrooms) plus corn and extra seaweed (came with 3-4 pieces). The bowl was of decent size, even a little on the larger side which was a nice plus. The ramen noodles were good and the chashu meat was delicious and very tender. My meal also came with a good amount of corn. Yay. The egg was a bit more undercooked than I'm used to - even the white portion was gooey, but it's okay I just left it on the side. Our waitress, Roselle was very attentive and sweet. She even commented on the uneaten egg when she was clearing our table, but I explained I'm accustomed to the soft boiled eggs that come with ramen, I just didn't realize that theirs was so undercooked here. No harm, no foul though.

The server came around pretty quickly once we were seated. Our server, though, was not particularly helpful. When I asked her what were the best dishes (her recommendation) she just pointed to the the three biggest pictures on the menu without much explanation. 

I ordered the Jinya No3 with extra ground pork and fresh garlic. The Jinya No3 was great as the broth was not too thick like some ramens are. The fresh garlic was a nice touch. It just comes out in bulbs and they hand you the press and you can press it in yourself, which was nice. I don't think the ground pork added much to the ramen, however. For some reason, it didn't have a fresh taste. Maybe a little old.

Friends of ours had ordered spicy ramen with extra noodles. Their dish came out and it didn't look spicy at all (just plain yellow broth). When they asked the server if it was spicy, she wasn't sure herself. She didn't check either. She just assumed it was. She also had to be reminded to bring extra noodles.

Especially if there's a wait, and there usually is. 
It's also really good to eat onsite... even though the seats aren't that comfortable. 

My favorite ramen is the Jinya White, which is a mix of their Pork and Chicken broth. With the two flavors, it's not too porky and the chicken adds a clearness which gives a cleaner style broth. 

Thick noodle is better than thin, in my opinion. 

Order Spicy and get the Hot level; it's good. 

They make a good egg, so I usually add an extra. 

Pork chashu is not the best I've had but it's still good. 

If you're onsite, ask for fresh garlic. It adds a special kick, but it is something you and your party should partake in, or the odd one out will be the vampire target. Or get punished by garlic essence. 

I also really like the combination meal where you can order a side dish. My favorites are their housemade gyoza or chicken chashu bowl. If I'm not that hungry, I ask the server to pack up the bowl so I can have for lunch the next day. 

I did not like the Brussel Sprouts - it's not light tempura style at all and had too much batter. 

Pork Bun - It's a good version and I would order again.

Overall the soup was pretty good. It's almost as good as Monta Ramen. 
We had the spicy chicken soup and the Tonkotsu Black. 
The spicy chicken soup eh not a fan. The flavor was kinda off for me. The chicken was not tender and the spinach wasn't a great mix.
I did enjoy the Tonkotsu Black. The flavor was really good. 
For appetizers, we ordered gyoza and shrimp balls. The gyoza was okay, it was not as crunchy on the sides but the shrimp balls were on point!

This is an awesome lil hidden spot. The ambience has a great feel to it too.

4106899,2015-02-07,3,gx2yPrOJSwF1ApJYdGBWIw,"Jinya was due for a revisit. Still lacking lunch in the late afternoon, I chose to try their happy hour (3-5pm).

Upon arrival, I was promptly seated at the bar area and informed of happy hour (helpful for those who stumble in without prior awareness). I didn't need alcohol or veggies, so that eliminated most of the options. Having neglected to compare costs thoroughly beforehand, I ordered a Jinya bun ($3.00 HH, $3.80 regular) instead of the crispy chicken (5 pc, $3.00 vs. $5.80, a great deal). Luckily, the bun was very nice, with dough that wasn't too dry and tender pork that wasn't too sweet or anything of the sort. It's comparable to other pork burns that I've had.

For my main course, I chose the tonkotsu black ($10.80) this time instead of the tonkotsu assari. This one has thin noodles by default, and they seemed to be done properly this time. There are two fairly thin pieces of chashu (one with a dab of chili paste, which was odd since it's not in the photo or ingredient list), one more piece than the assari. The egg seemed fairly typical - not fully hard-boiled but not runny. A little black garlic oil, green onions, fried onions, kikurage, and two pieces of nori rounded out the bowl.

Like last time, I was confused by the broth. It did taste better than the assari broth, but it still seemed to be lacking. Halfway through, I tried adding a bit of the liquid from the bottle labeled ""ramen seasoning."" The mixture of soy sauce, garlic, and other components does really round out the broth's flavor. It's almost mind-boggling that Jinya has this gimmick of basically forcing the customer to add liquid seasoning to get comparable flavors, a conceit that no other ramen restaurant that I've been to in any city has done.

At this price point for ramen, I still favor the deluxe miso at Ramen Sora at least 9 times out of 10. I think I would also prefer the kogashi ramen at Fukumimi if price and drive are eliminated as factors. However, I will say that the dessert (an option missing from other places) was a pleasant upsell at meal's end. The An-Nin Tofu ($2 HH, $3.50 normally) felt like a steal, with soft almond pudding, a little whipped cream and strawberry sauce, and fresh diced mango, kiwi and strawberries.

I still like Jinya in spite of my broth quibbles, but if it's not happy hour or late night, you'll probably only find me here again if I've overenjoyed my other local favorite ramen spots. And no, Monta is not one of them.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,4,3,4,QB8a9WcNgVQOTooZ4snpBQ

Came here late - probably past midnight on a very cold Saturday - and Jinya was bustling. Thankfully, the wait wasn't more than 10 minutes. Service was quick and to the point - no chitchatting and no BS. The food came quickly and did not disappoint.

Pork buns were solid. Nice piece of fatty but not too fatty, tender pork belly balanced with crisp cucumbers and a tad of lettuce, sandwiched in a fluffy soft bun and topped with just the right the right amount of japanese mayo. The pork belly itself probably could've marinated in whatever magical sauce they use for a little longer. 

Now the ramen - we went for a classic tonkosu assari (with pork chashu, kikurage, green onions, soft boiled egg and bean sprouts) and a tonkotsu black (main difference being the addition of nori dried seaweed, garlic chips, fried onion and the use of thinner noodles). The broth in both were rich, alllllmost bordering on being a tad too rich to the point where I couldn't finish all of the broth (a sin in my book). The noodles were perfectly cooked. I'm not quite sure why they use two different types of noodles - a thick and a thin version. I personally prefer the thicker version, but the tonkotsu black only comes with the thin noodles. Eggs were properly soft-boiled (it drives me nuts when ramen joints don't do the egg right!). I'll definitely be coming back again, looking forward to trying some of the other ramen options - perhaps some of the other broths are not quite as rich.",i6kNeNRrER8ocnpkBJ3wBA,0,0,4,j7xw48SM2depwgRRHTqyag

So we understood and sat patiently waiting for our food. The time was around 8pm. 15 mins went past and no food. So I still waited. At around 8:30pm I had to get the servers attention. As he never came back to apologize nor say that it will take a little longer. I caught his attention and told him about our wait. He apologized and came back saying it is coming in another 10 mins. 

we finally got out food at 8:45pm. Not a big fan of complaining but it was such a bad service on the servers end that ruined the whole night. The food was great as expected.

A new contender in the ramen food scene of Las Vegas.

I remember coming back from Japan and there were none in Las Vegas that could even rate a zero on the rating to japan.  I used to be one of the firsts requesting Ramen in Vegas I think I might have been the first to review a new ramen in Vegas.  I was one of the firsts asking for authentic Ramen, over the years it has turned into a Vegas experience. 

Ramen in this town has grown from going to a side bar that has the reputation of a good ramen to some of the best ramen on the west coast.  I no longer have to drive to LA to have Ramen.

Jinya again exceeds expectations of a ramen restaurant.  This place kind of resets the bar of Ramen in this town.  There are others who have held the bar for so long but have become lax.  Still good but not as good as this, sad to say but I feel fame will make you relax too much.  

We put our name in and waited about 30 minutes.  Not bad for good Ramen in Vegas.  we were asked if a small table was ok (of course) sat and were explained the menu.  

I recommend getting the Thick noodles, I was fine with normal noodles but my man really likes the thicker noodles.  The normal noodles are quite thin.

We got the Jinya Tonkostso Black, we added Nori, Corn, fresh garlic and seasoned egg.  I really wanted some apps but it was only us 2.  We got our food and feasted, I have never had a egg this good.  I have made this claim before but every time I make this claim it has never been this good. I relished this egg...  I would go back for the Tonkostso Black any day.

This Ramen is the best at this point, Monta Ramen and Ramen Sora look out you have a new player in town!  I think Jinya might take over in my opinion! 

I will go back and i will ask for more, I might ask for extra.  I will for sure get more of the Jinya Tonkostso Black.  I can t wait to try some sides.

Jinya - The speed in which the food arrives has much improved since previous visits. The demeanor of our server - as if he ""couldn't be bothered"" - was pretty frustrating. Twice, he held his finger up at me from a distance as if to say ""just a second"" while he dance and laughed with others servers 2 feet from our table. It wasn't as though he was busy with guests. So that's just annoying and uncool. You are a server, please provide service or move on. Honestly. It's not rocket science. 

Asking for items to come as a first course made no difference - as everything showed up either all together or appetizers after the ramen bowls hit the table. Again, not the biggest deal - but communicate to your table if that's the case. It becomes a situation where the lack of proper service has you noticing everything that is not right. We ordered a pitcher of beer and saké and the server never came back to check on us when they were done - make sales dude!

I ordered the Tonkotsu ramen black which contained a large seasoned egg, pork chashu, seaweed and green onion. The broth was tasty and flavorful. Service was solid. I had room for the green tea mochi which is large enough for two but ate the whole dessert. A great way to end lunch.

Walking into the restaurant, you're greeted with dim lighting and a romantic atmosphere. The interior design recalls Japanese influences with an modern and industrial feel. In the center of the restaurant is a huge wooden sharing table with cool light fixtures hanging above them. Smaller tables line the walls and windows.

Our server was informative of the menu pointing out that the pictures on the menu were their popular items. 

I got the tonkatsu and my roomie had the spicy chicken ramen. Now, a lot of people claim that this place is better than Monta. I won't agree to that but I will say that quality and taste of the ramen is good in it's own way and is on the same level as Monta. That's just my honest opinion. The broth is a little lighter but still full of amazing flavors.

I definitely recommend this place to everyone who is a ramen lover or just curious to try a new restaurant. I'll be back to try more of their ramen options.",zpnDr3EBaVU8QPNHE3eDbg,3,3,5,N5J1-xFaO5nW27Y5q_6_Lg

Was really excited to get my ramen fix here after seeing their high reviews and advertisements on billboards. Let's just say I left super disappointed in the quality of food and service. You're better off at Manta. And no, this place does not at all compare to Ramen in LA.

Ordered the black garlic oil ramen combo with the curry bowl/ salad. For my ramen, I added corn and asked for spicy.

When they brought out my curry bowl, they forgot my salad. When I asked for it, they questioned if I even ordered the combo. Then came my ramen, and yet again They forgot something-  the spicy sauce. As I started eating, I fished around my bowl and noticed they ALSO FORGOT MY CHASHU. Told the server, and he said he was goin to bring me it. I waited 15 mins and my ramen got cold. Got the servers attention again and guess what- he forgot about getting my chashu pork. 

So after all this, I was pretty over it. My meal was incomplete and cold. Staff are incompetent and can't seem to get an order right. They did offer to reheat my ramen-  but it really didn't live up to the hype. Don't waste your time and stomach here.",aX5_9kEjslwp-bQjHQyjDg,1,0,1,2s48eGPmUm07EbdShuuvNA

Since the first time I started going, I feel like the food has gradually been getting better. There were some items on the menu that were a bit questionable before but now I find myself here quite often ordering those exact same items. Also, just like any typical ramen shop, it's a bit tiny so always be prepared for a 15-25min wait depending on the time of day you go.

They have quite the variety of ramen and rice bowls. The Tonkotsu Black and Cha Cha Cha ramen bowls are definitely great if you're a garlic lover. I usually ask for a side of fresh garlic so I can garlic press straight into my soup until my heart is content. Plus you can get a noodle refill for only $1.60 if all you're left with is broth.

I always stop by for their Happy Hour that runs daily from 3pm-5pm and 10pm-12am. They have the most amazing Salmon Poke tacos. I don't know what sauce they use to marinate with, but seriously, those tacos are godly. They are not stingy with the amount of salmon that goes into the two tacos either and it's only $3! I also always get the Jinya Bun, which includes a nice buttery slice of pork belly.

4239441,2014-09-02,1,gx2yPrOJSwF1ApJYdGBWIw,"Jinya Ramen Bar is another competitor to hop into the already saturated Vegas ramen scene. I would probably put it on the #3 spot in terms of best ramen spots in Las Vegas. Two things I like about this place is the inclusion of happy hour (3-5pm) and super late hours (open until 3am).

I've had the chance to try both the spicy chicken and tonkotsu varieties over here. The spicy chicken broth has some savory kick (with a choice of mild, spicy, and extra spicy). The tonkotsu broth here is rich and creamy, reminiscent of Monta. Only miss is that the pork chashu was a bit more tough than I'm accustomed to. The pork belly at other ramen spots are much more ""melt in your mouth"" worthy. Here's a rundown of what I've had:

-Crispy chicken (5 pcs): Nice big pieces of chicken karage. Doesn't beat what Fukumimi offers, but it does its job, especially during happy hour prices ($3). 4/5 stars.
-Gyoza: Really tasty gyoza here. I wouldn't mind ording another round next time I come by. 4/5 stars.
-Curry rice: Nothing really stood out with the curry here. Standard Japanese curry over rice. Not bad, but not amazing either. 3/5 stars.

-Spicy chicken ramen: Rich chicken broth filled with the usual components in a ramen bowl. I was kind of bummed that this was one menu item that didn't come with an egg. I had to add it myself ($1). I really liked it. They give a choice of mild, spicy, and extra spicy. 4/5 stars.

-Jinya Tonkotsu Ramen: Here's that rich and creamy pork broth that I love. Probably my favorite bowl of ramen here. 4.5/5 stars.

-Almond tofu dessert: A creamy almond tofu pudding complemented by kiwi, peach and strawberry fruit topping. This was much more delicious than I expected. 5/5 stars.

I definitely see myself coming back here. The vibe that this place offers is very ""L.A."" It's hip, modern, and very upbeat. It's much more accommodating as a hangout/date spot than most other ramen bars out there. I like the fact that they have a happy hour, which makes things very reasonable.

Note: Happy hour is daily, from 3pm-5pm. Plenty of drink specials and $3-5 apps.",qe1GaPBOSOXqCVIuQRYvKA,4,1,4,fvv3w-H3CFvm9B6rnyT9Hw

Came here late night with some friends. I was surprised at how busy the place was at 10:30pm on a weeknight. But the vibe was cool so I can see why. 

The service was a touch of a let down for this place. We arrived, signed in, and we waited for probably close to 10 minutes because there was some confusion about empty tables. Some people that came in after us were aggressive and were trying to get the jump on us to steal a table that just needed some cleaning. They needed to turn the tables over faster and get more organized because it got a touch awkward. 

Then when it was time to order, felt a little rushed and I was honestly a little overwhelmed by all of the choices for ramen and possible combos for adding stuff. I wanted to add it all but then my ramen would have been $40 since some of the items are add-ins. Kind of just ended up pointing at a number. The ramen that came out was satisfying enough. I got crazy dragon breath because I squeezed fresh garlic in there. Someone at my table did have an issue with having to remind the waitress about her items. She also did not check on us very often. She was nice but she may have just been overwhelmed (much like I was at the menu options). 

I did totally preesh (Master of None quote, not a typo) their happy hour menu. Got to order a cheap beer and some tasty apps. I also got totally nosey watching this couple that looked like they got in a fight and the guy got up and left with his skateboard. So she just kept ordering food for the next hour.

I omitted the spice (I'm a whimp) and green onions and added tofu. The depth of flavor of the broth was spectacular. It was what you hope for when you order ramen: deep, rich, porky goodness. The noodles were the right texture. All the other accoutrements (seasoned egg, seaweed paper, pork chashu, kikurage, garlic chips; garlic oil) made the ramen a complete meal that was delicious. I also ordered takoyaki, fried octopus balls, which were yummy, especially with the sauce they are covered in. I was disappointed in the Jinya bun.

Tonkotsu assari ramen with fat noodles- 4 stars. I thought this was the best of the 3 ramen I had. It was still missing something for me, but also good enough. 

Spicy tonkotsu ramen- 3 stars. It wasn't spicy, and it was a bit greasy for me still. 

I thought the soup to noodle ratio was a bit off. Their broth is very small for how much noodle they give you. I think the garlic press w/ garlic is genius, as it upped my ramen flavor dramatically after adding in a clove or two. 

Gyoza- 3 stars. This was again average. Nothing to write home about. 

Service was stellar. Nice, posh place, and I'm giving them extra half a star for having a ramen drive-through, because that is just too cool for words. It doesn't even exist in Japan (makes sense cuz there's not much land) and a pretty cool option to have. Of all the ramen places in Vegas, I'd say that this place is the best so far. It's not saying too much however, and I'd take a few places in L.A. any day.",B1829_hxXSEpDPEDJtYeIw,1,1,3,bP7rNJ0YJlXxLu4_8ZhHfA

Tonkatsu black was creamy and the broth was good but I felt it was lacking something. Not sure what that something is but I added chili to give some spice. I ordered it with thick noodles. The egg was cooked perfectly. Over time the broth did become too salty to my liking. 

The takoyaki had a very nice preservation and came with a sauce that was creamy and very rich. It was delicious at first but by the end the richness was very overpowering. The octopus was roughly chopped and inside a fried ball shell. 

Gyoza was alright. Not the best but not the worst I've tried. Not memorable.

My boyfriend just moved to the US and this was the first place we went to dinner. I am so embarrassed with the impression he now has of American service. 

If I could give zero stars for the service I would. I take pride in tipping well. This is the first time in my life that I left giving a zero tip. I do not expect or need to be pampered when I go out to eat, but as a customer I do expect a certain level of service, just as I know I am expected to tip. 

Host was amicable and was able to get us a booth. Unfortunately for us it was in Alex's section. Some things I did not enjoy:
- We were treated as if we were a thorn in his side
- He tossed the drink menu onto the table and left before we ordered
- My friend accidentally dropped the menu as she was passing it to him. He watched it fall onto the floor and walked away without picking it up.
- Our tab was brought to the table while we were still eating. Yall are busy, need to turn tables around, no big deal. We weren't done though, so my friend ordered dessert. We watched it sit on the counter, and had the tab brought to our table again by the same person who brought it the first time. She was the person we had ordered the dessert from. Getting the tab to us seemed to be more of a priority than our food. 

Alex did not come back to our table until after we asked for his name. At that point I didn't want anything else. 

I am extremely sad the night turned out like this. I was texting my dad while I read the menu telling him how much he would love it here and how I couldn't wait to bring him. That will not be happening now. 

I know it is busy and yall always have a line outside, but there are much busier places that would never treat customers like this. The attitudes of some of the servers would not be acceptable at a high school concession stand. We did notice that servers in other sections seemed to be much more involved with their tables. I am sure sitting in another section would be a much better experience, but the taste in my mouth is going to make it very difficult to come back.

We were seated at this tiny booth for two along the wall. Then the server approached us, asking how our day was and in return she told us she's had a long day and it could have been better... Like what do you say back to that?! Awkwarddd... 

Then she briefly explained the menu and their popular items and gave us literally 1 minute to look over the menu. I get that they are going for a dim dinner feel, but we could not see what the menu had to offer. We had to pull out the flashlight on our iPhones to read the menu. She came back but obviously we weren't ready, because we couldn't even read the menu to begin with.. 

Finally she came back and my boyfriend and I both picked out the spicy chicken ramen. I'm kind of a picky eater so I asked what each ingredient was. When I asked about the ""Tokyo Negi"" she literally stood there for 30 seconds, blank stare, not knowing how to explain what it was.... So I just asked for that on the side. 

I added mushrooms, corn, and butter. As she was taking our order on the iPad, I had to repeat over and over what I wanted.. Again she said, sorry it's been a long night..   

After that I went to the ladies room. I was surprised by their high tech toilet that lifted up by itself when it felt my motion near it. It even had a seat warmer lol! And that was the highlight of my experience there, pretty much hah.... 

Finally, our food came out and I didn't see the butter or the mushrooms..  Pretty bummed out, but I didn't say anything. I was so hungry, that I could not  wait any longer. My stomach was growling all day.

I usually get pork broth ramens, and I absolutely adore their spicy tonkotsu. It's completely fantastic. Just make sure you realize their spice levels are a little weird. It's mild then spicy and the spiciest level is hot. It is listed on the menu, but you might miss it. (Hot, their spiciest level is the best level. Although it still needs an extra spoonful of the table side hot sauce.)

One small qualm. Their seasoned eggs are served whole. I stopped ordering them, and I miss them. But I really wish they were cut in half. It looks better presentation wise and it's edible in halves.

Jinya opens up at 3pm, which is also when their HH starts (3- 5pm) which is great if you want to enjoy some ramen and different appetizers/beer.  They even offer bottomless mimosas for $10!  I love how extensive their menu is!  There are about 10 different ramen to choose from, you can also turn it into a combo which includes a salad + your choice (either gyoza, chasu bowl, curry rice, california roll, crispy chicken.) And if you're not feeling like ramen, you can order off their tapas menu which includes salads, curry and rice bowls, desserts, and more. 

I ordered the Tonkotsu Black Ramen and Jinya Bun.  The Jinya bun was a great start to the meal!  The Chasu Pork had the melt in yo mouth consistency and the gooeyness from the barbecue sauce went perfectly together. 

The ramen was just as described and looked exactly like the picture!  What sets Jinya apart from the others is the flavor of their broth.

The noodle was extremely firm and still hard on the inside.
They apologized and gave her a fresh bowl. Though they did try to argue that since the noodle was a thicker kind it was supposed to be a bit more firm.

I've had Pho before and it was delicious but I knew deep down in my heart I'd love Ramen more and boy was I right! This place was amazing! I went around the happy hour time of 10pm-12am and started off with some hot Sake for only $5. Talk about a good buzz for cheap. I was floating with the stars and still had plenty to share with my girlfriend. I ended up ordering the Crispy Chicken Appetizer and the Spicy Chicken Ramen at the hottest level. That chicken was so perfectly fried and seasoned and the sauce they serve with it was out of this world. I loved every bit of it! Now let's get to the Ramen. The broth...... OMG. It was savory and bold in flavor and is exactly what I like. I ordered the Seasoned Egg and also added Ground Chicken (Can't remember the exact name on the menu) =( and I was beyond satisfied. Our server was great and checked on us periodically and the overall atmosphere was chill and relaxed with dim lighting. I will definitely be back here on a regular basis. My GF also taught me how to use chop sticks that night so that made it even a greater experience. I felt like an idiot looking at everyone going to work while I was the only one who had a fork in my hand lol.

It's a bit lacking in Nevada but this place makes up for It because they sell black garlic ramen. Mmmm, my favorite.  Anyways, it's always always ALWAYS packed here.  I came during the day, late at night, and late late night and no matter what time, it's busy.  It's a good sign!  Parking could be a little tough but I've always found one near by.  It's located in a plaza so there's more parking in the other areas.  

As you walk in, there's always a crowd waiting near the entrance which sucks because they're always in the way.  They need to have a waiting area tbh.  So there's a host stand right by the door and you put your name.  The times I've went, the wait is usually around 30 minutes to even an hour or two.  I don't mind.  They usually ask if you want a booth or if you don't mind, they shared table.  It's a large table where they sit everyone at.  I don't mind so I'm seated faster.  

They do offer happy hour items.  I always get the chicken.  I also only order the black garlic style ramen with thin noodles.  You could always opt out for thick but It does depend on the ramen.  You could also do combos for I believe $3-$5 for curry and a salad, etc.  they also have toppings to add into your ramen for cheap!! I also like that they offer fresh garlic that you could mince into your ramen or sauce, or whatever you want.  They even offer vegetarian options!!! If you still have soup leftover, you could get a refill of noodles for $1!!! 

The prices are decent and I think they are fair for the quantity and quality.  I enjoy this place a lot! I will be returning here.  If you want to try this place, I suggest getting there a bit early and distract yourself while waiting.",SyX94Qkpowm_9dsn1SDrCQ,1,0,4,XsyiDlSLhB8cd2iXiarjLw

The hostess was kind and on it. The table service was okay as he never came to check on us and didn't really explain a couple of the choices too well with my boyfriend (his first time having ramen). We had to flag someone else down for the bill. Great atmosphere (liked he seating situations and the music).",bYm6JjJ64F31gzDq2imWJA,0,0,3,BG6UJKJ1MNfelRhpt_ImpQ

Comparing the two I liked the thick and my husband preferred the thin noodles. 

The staff was great. Our waitress spent time going over the menu with us. Not needed but definitely appreciated.

4538396,2014-09-15,2,gx2yPrOJSwF1ApJYdGBWIw,"I must say I never thought I would want ramen so often until I tried Jinya! I used to have the random craving and would go to spring mtn. But I literally find myself wanting Jinya like crazy!! I've gone 2 times in the last week! First off I love the atmosphere it's very warm with the dark woods and they play awesome music that's not on everyday radio. 

We started out with iced green tea which was super refreshing and had free refills. Next up the Jinya buns. DO NOT SKIP THE BUNS!! The pork is sooo tender and the sauce is yummy. We tried the premium white tonkotsu and it didn't disappoint. The broth has more flavor then I ever expected. It was lighter in texture even though it appeared very creamy. The noodles were PERFECT in texture. I didn't use any condiments but they do have chili sauce and ramen seasoning on the table. 

One thing that I think is SUPER cool is they have a kids meal. This thing contains so much food I was in disbelief. When I saw the menu I had to ask 8 we choose and item, but mope! You get everything listed/pictured! Chicken ramen with corn and spinach, chashu rice bowl with spinach, chicken karrage, fries, orange slice, a lollipop, and their tofu dessert!! All for $7!!  Since my 5 year old can't eat all that we got to try a bunch of stuff. Their karrage was amazing, it is kind of heavy on salt so if you're sensitive pass it up. 

Our service was eh, at best. But the food and decent price point out shown the service. I can't wait to go eat Jinya now that I've been thinking about it since I started this review.",JfnY0VcP63s5RF1sfOHjBQ,4,3,5,tJ6WBOHfwS7wRCuDDzKdqw

4542366,2016-06-13,0,gx2yPrOJSwF1ApJYdGBWIw,"I've been visiting this Ramen Shop since they opened at this location at least 1x a week.  I love their Ramen.  Over the course of that time the price has gone up a couple of times, but I've dealt with it as the servers are all friendly, know my order right when I come in, and I'm happy when I finish!  

The last menu change and price increase unfortunately has crossed the line for me.  They no longer offer Tonkatsu Assari (#3) in all its glory.  The closest thing to this is now something with brussel sprouts and extra pork.  I don't mind the extra pork and it's probably still a good price for what you get, but the latest price increase brings my regular order to close to 50% more than what it was when they first opened.  I could just change my order to accommodate their new menu, but with so many other Ramen shops around that offer a lower price bowl or Ramen that has everything I want in it (and nothing more that I have to pay for) it's hard to justify staying a regular here.  Makes me a little bit sad since it's SO close to my office and a great lunch option.  I asked the server if they could just keep giving me what I like to order.  They are able to do some substitutions and get it pretty much how I like it but the price remains higher.  

Perhaps you can keep Tonkatsu Assari as it used to be as an ""off the menu"" option for regulars like myself.  You'll definitely win back my regular business and Yelp Stars!!!!

As we were waiting for our food we noticed people who were seated after us were getting their food. Our server notified us that they forgot to place our order and said they would get our food out in a minute.

My cousin recommended this place and from the moment we entered to the time we left, we were well taken care of.  Upon arrival, we were seated immediately and I took notice of the lay out of the restaurant and it was very feng shui.  It flowed nicely and was decorated nicely.  Very clean, very modern with a traditional feel with the wooden tables.

It was dimly lit and there was some low music playing.  Seems like a great hang out spot for 20-somethings or even a place to take a date and have a great intimate conversation with.

As for the food, my aunt was a gracious host since we were coming from out of town and I was happy to order and test out plenty of the menu.  I ordered the vegan ramen, edamame, and mochi ice cream.  As for the rest of my group, they ordered the ramen with the different types of meat in it and also the shrimp ball appetizers. 

Everyone was blown away with the presentation as well as the taste.  Apparently the ramen sauce was also spectacular although I didn't try it as I felt my bowl was perfect the way it was.

The service was also fantastic with our waitress Kate.  She was very knowledgable, friendly, and attentive to all our needs.  It didn't hurt that she was also easy on the eyes as agreed upon by my group.

In any case, the pricing was extremely fair and reasonable and made it great value for our money.    I highly recommend coming to check this place out!",PHl0poFyk2IntQ44VqGh4g,1,0,5,CGztN3CgOcKy7QNCjNcIVQ

There was a line when we got there, so we just added our names to the list on the clipboard. Not a lot of waiting space so we waited outside in the parking lot. When they called our name they put the five of us in a booth with one on a stool. It worked well enough. There seemed to be space available at the big table where they could have been seating more people, but often there were empty seats, tables while people still waited.
We ordered our drinks and we had two people order water and beer. Beer came, no water. Asked again. Nothing. Asked again. Nope. Asked a fourth time and got one water, out of the two we asked for.  And by this time we had ordered dinner and had our food. Also, FYI they have soda, but it is in a can.
When we ordered our food they made a point of reminding everyone that ordered that they were out of thick noodles, so they would all be thin. Fine with us and there had been a handwritten sign on the door saying this. But I ordered one of the bowls or ramen only to be told they didn't have that. Sucked because that ramen was the reason I wanted to go here. I ordered something else and we were fine.
First bowl shows up. A minute later two more. Another minute and bowl four shows up. We wait... and wait. Probably five plus more minutes and the last bowl shows up (also when the first glass of water showed up). I don't know if the vegetarian ramen takes longer or what, but that is the bowl that was last.
Everyone said there food was really good. I liked mine and my husband's was tasty too.
When the check comes we all throw down twenties. We give the waiter twenty-two bucks over the bill and ask for change. He comes back with two ones and two tens. I wanted to tip around fifteen, but since that's the change we got, we put down twelve. Most waiters give you an assortment of bills when you get change. Oh well.

I really hate to knock a good thing but in my experience, this is more hype from the Billboards than reality. I've lived in Japan and eaten enough ramen there (and in the US) to experience what good ramen is.

Maybe it's just this location b/c I've been to Robata Jinya in LA for Ramen and it was good.

What this Jinya does have going for it is menu variety but it's a double edged sword as execution can be inconsistent when you try to do too many things at once. On that note, execution was lacking in both front of house with seating and service and back of house with food quality.

Seems that the restaurant is run by young kids just winging it as a first job or part time job. Service and attention to detail is lacking. Dirty tables were bussed in ""batches"" rather than individually and thus people were waiting looking at each other with confused looks. Nobody asked or checked up on us. Restaurants thrive on turnover but is obviously not a metric that these employees are aware of.

Ordered the Sprouting Up Ramen and the Cha Cha Cha (both which are ""Jinya Recommended"" items).  I know Jinya serves fusion ramen but there shouldn't be fat chunks floating in your ramen... The only fusion with fat chunks is how it fuses to my belly, which can't be good.

Extra noodles which were ordered never came and had to ask 2 times for them. Finally arrived and fortunately portions were large but my soup was already cold...

Jinya should have their employees visit Japan to understand what attention to detail, pride and service. Or better yet, just visit Monta Ramen.",3B4dWxXS9Da1-ayaeTOI8A,1,0,2,o3e_9Kho-J-zF5DGfaqg7Q

The food and the service was better than average. I would definitely recommend giving this place a go.

Takoyaki - this was excellent. If you like the Japanese dish Okino Miyaki then you will like this dish. It is basically the same ingredients and then it is shaped in to bite size portions.

Crispy Rice with spicy tuna - this is just what it says it is. It was good.

Crispy Chicken with ponzu sauce - This would have been a good choice if the chicken would not have been so greasy. I think the oil in the fryer needed to be changed or they dropped the chicken back in the fryer after it was cooked.

Spicy chicken ramen noodle - the ramen was excellent. I ordered it ""Hot"". It had a lot of heat to it, but not so much heat that you could not enjoy it. I may just go with ""Spicy"" next time though.",aD263WOD4RShoqgvVhcKqQ,2,3,4,-L9LKVkdWqZDMEV-49Mt8Q

Food: 
The broth at Jinya is great. I ordered the Chicken ramen, which is essentially a hearty shio ramen which is exactly what I was hoping for. I also tried the soup from the Tokyo Tonkotsu Ramen, which had a strong flavor of katsuobushi (dried skipjack tuna) which made for a really nice, light taste for pork broth. 

My gripe comes from the obvious lack of attention to the smaller details in creating the bowl which really took away from the great broth. The ramen itself came out lukewarm. The noodles and spinach were not drained properly which resulted in diluted soup. The noodles should have been slightly more al dente (although this is probably a preference thing). 

The gyozas were good. The takoyaki came out cold in the middle. 

Overall Jinya has all the flavors for a great ramen place. With just a few minor tweaks in details I think it could be SO much better.",qVWS96iqmoPqs6RLHdttqQ,0,0,3,LtmnYVoOyXnJy9ObC9h7UA

Their flavors are a bit unusual and they offer a wide selection of optional toppings.  The location is more convenient to me than most other ramen joints.  The customer service was fine.

They are a little expensive considering the bowl leans small (they look big, but the ceramic material is just really thick and tall), and the toppings are a little stingy in portion (probably because the bowl is small).  Ramen prices in Vegas seem to be creeping up in general.  It was also odd that the ""thick"" noodle ramen (what I would call normal) in my husband's bowl was super small portion, while my thin noodles (the thinnest I've ever seen in ramen) were pretty generous.  I ordered tofu as a topping and it was cold, not cooked, and cooled down the ramen faster.  But it was an entire brick worth of tofu.  The fried onions are quite tasty and I enjoyed the chicken char-siu, still kinda rare.

The spicy is really not spicy (like maybe 1.5 on a scale of 5) - it did make the ramen more flavorful but also more salty, I think.  JINYA ramen was definitely saltier than average.  I think I'll try the basic chicken ramen next time and see if it's less salty.  This was enough to make me feel a bit sick soon after.",0DGh3LaLFDDES3OtOqGq1w,0,0,3,_h8U525-EmTCYLpyUAKqJw

Jimya looks very small from the outside, but it is roomier than it looks once you're inside. I went with a group of 7 for a work lunch right at noon and the service was quick and correct! I ordered the spicy chicken and added a poached egg and was not at all disappointed. I had to ask the server what Tokyo Negri was (listed with the ingredients) and I learned a new fact of the day - Tokyo Negri is a Japanese onion. You can order the ramen as mild, spicy, or HOT. Spicy was pretty darn spicy, so I can only imagine that hot was high up on the spicy scale.

Our table was in and out of there in about 45 minutes tops and all of us thought our food was delicious. I will definitely add this restaurant into the lunch rotation going forward.",NYDvprxYyDm1dJj8g_G0RA,1,1,4,naobl_ZN69CUwk1GM3vthg

But trust me, stop in and have some Ramen.  I've turned into quite the Ramen addict in the last two years and although I hate to admit it, I've acquired a taste for hipster Ramen vs traditional.  Although you won't catch me kicking any Ramen bowls out of my bed...  So back to the point of my taste in Ramen.  There is a place in San Diego that I LOVE called Underbelly.  Some people haven't been quite won over yet, but that does seem to be the place I use to compare all others.  Well except for the place in Paris, which will be my ALL TIME favorite. 

There is a very good flavor to the broth, you can choose thick or thin noodles and you can add ""toppings"".  All of which is very important to me.  The price is very reasonable and the serving size is filling.  They also a happy hour so it's a win win in my book!",w6DoAYVMd5r0vXPbSZcU5Q,2,1,5,Lws3kbpcrCy4wImbrNzMLw

Gyoza - Pretty good, it's pork and veggies and pan fried.  Not a big fan when they someone does deep fried gyoza.

Tempura Brussel Sprouts - Didn't care much for it, a lot of batter and pretty bland for my taste.

Fried Chicken - Big pieces of their version of chicken karage.  Very tasty and seasoned very well.

Fresh Tofu - This was a pleasant surprise, if you have some time and like tofu give this dish a try.  They actually make fresh tofu for you at the table.  Note, this is plain tofu and you have to add the ginger, scallions, fish flake, and soy sauce that they bring on the side.  It takes some time for it to form, if you're not sure when it's ready they should be able to tell you.

Black Ramen - The soup base was pretty good, not a fan of the thin noodles though.

Spicy Chicken Ramen - This was really good and I asked for the thick noodles instead of the thin.  The noodles were chewy and the soup base was yummy.

The service was good.  It does get really busy here, so plan to wait a bit and make sure your whole party is here or they won't seat you.",BoA83SDJI9HV3lJzFs8laQ,0,0,4,4zTJ7ZllhfxfwStvttMJzw

The host was very unfriendly and even though there was no one in line or waiting and tables were open he still had us stand there in front of him for 10 mins before finally acknowledging us.  We were seated on a dirty table which i used my napkin to wipe off the seat.  The server was actually pretty nice.  We told him it was our first time and he seemed happy to explain the menu to us.  After we placed our orders the food came out pretty quick.  Thats where the problem started.  My order was wrong.  So i asked the server if i could send it back.  He said no problem.  When i finally got my order back it was wrong again.  I received what i ordered but now everything extra i ordered like an egg and garlic were not in the bowl.  So i had to call the server over again and ask if i could get the extras i ordered (since i was paying for them anyways) and he was annoyed now and went to the cooks to get it.  He brought back an egg but nothing else.  I didn't feel like requesting the rest of my items even though i was being charged for them.  I did ask for the server one more time which now took forever since he was avoiding me.   When he finally came back to our table i asked if we could have a spoon since we were the only table without any and we wanted it for our soup.  He said ok and walked away.  He never came back with our spoons.  We were over this place and wanted our bill which took another 20 mins for the server to come back with our bill.  I gave it a 2 star instead of 1 because the soup was pretty decent.  It would have been better to try the soup if it would have had all the extra ingredients i ordered.

One of the hostess just stood around looking lost. Once seated, the party after us somehow got their food before us.

I got the sprouted ramen which was alright, there were shit ton of sprouts. The broth was alright in the salty thick side. Not the best ramen I have had and not the worst.

4696556,2017-11-10,0,gx2yPrOJSwF1ApJYdGBWIw,"Best ramen in Vegas!!!

This is my go to place when I'm craving ramen (which is pretty often!). I normally order take out but have dined in more than a few times. Everything I've ordered has been tasty but here are some stand outs: 

- Spicy creamy vegan ramen: regardless of whether or not you eat meat, this is a MUST try. The broth is very savory and perfectly compliments the thick delicious noodles. Add a seasoned egg for a little extra creaminess and flavor 

- spicy chicken ramen: perfect soup for a cold day or if you're under the weather. The broth is a little thicker than a traditional chicken soup with big pieces of tender chicken chasu and thin noodles.

- tonkotsu black: a more traditional style of ramen with pork, seasoned egg and other veggies in a flavorful, umami broth. 

- Jinya buns- tender pork bao buns

- takoyaki: these octopus balls are flavorful and addictive. 1 order is perfect for two to share. ;-)

Tips: 
- This is a popular spot and a pretty intimate dining area. That being said, coming during off peak hours or ordering take out during peak times are you're best bet.
-  Order extra broth... it's really good! 
- Just because a soup has the word spicy in its name, they will prepare it mild unless you indicate your preferred spice level. If you're not sure, ask for the hot sauce on the side so you can adjust it to your own taste.",wNK1pWJNzLzkGQ-OxI_0gA,0,0,5,KsztbgGC9zWyPusvvKW5PA

Price at the higher side which priced the same as new york city but considering the rent is incomparable to ny...

Overall great atmosphere, modern design, and nice feels of big city restaurant.
Pro on foods: thin noodles cooked perfectly with nice tender bites... friend ordered a pork chausau rice bowl was quite delicious, and nice sauce combination.
Con on foods: soup based just way too thick and creamy which i have been to more than 10 ramen shops and Jinya gotta be the creamiest of them all... flavor wise was just okay due to the richness is getting destroyed by the thickness of the soup based..

First off the waitress was sweet as can be and very attentive. If we were ever wanting anything, I'd simply have to look up at my food and smile and she'd be there. Got to love good service. We went for a late lunch so there was no line and about 5 tables inside. Perfect time because apparently they have a waitlist at night. 

The Gyoza tasted like my mom's home cooking. Yum! The fried chicken was very flavorful but a bit too chewy for my fiancé's liking. They use dark meat but you can tell the fat wasn't trimmed much. The tonkotsu assari ramen had good flavor, the egg was cooked perfectly, loved the bean sprouts and I added some bamboo. The noodles were a little overcooked though and though the serving size was perfect for me because I don't eat too much, it was a smaller portion than what I would expect for ramen.

I'm not settling when I come to Jinya, I'm simply going with a different alternative.

When ordering a bowl of ramen, you also have an option of turning it into a combo meal.  Not the french fry and Coke variety, but the ramen and gyoza variety.  Or ramen and karaage.  Ramen and chicken chashu?  Ramen and pork chashu.  If you have an appetite for more than just soup, you can add on a salad and side dish of your choice for only $4 or $5 extra.

Outside of their delicious tonkotsu broth and combo meals, the other big reason I enjoy coming here isn't even food related; it's the fact that they have a bar!

4786299,2017-05-14,0,gx2yPrOJSwF1ApJYdGBWIw,"Ramen is great but the wait is awful.  They quoted 20mins but it's been over 40mins and we are still standing cramped up by the front entrance.

Annoying thing is they have empty tables (booth and main large table) but they don't seat people.  Clearly the owner needs to hire an extra server if there are empty seats, long time waiting outside, but no one gets served.  It's too bad because the ramen is 5 stars but the wait time is terrible and turns it into a negative experience.

We brought friends with us and are feeling terrible for the overwhelmingly long wait when we could've eaten elsewhere and be on the way home by now.

The hostess that doubles up as cashier is completely clueless as to managing people flow.  A booth stayed clean and empty for over 20mins and she sat zero people there.  Eventually, when someone did get sat there, they were unhappy with why they weren't sat sooner when the table became available 20mins ago.  The hostess (long black straight hair eith bleached hairtips lied and said ""oh it just got cleaned a few minutes ago.""  BS!  Everyone standing near the front knew she was lying and were grumbling about the same thing.

Bad wait aside, the food is great and the servers we've had were also excellent (except for the young woman with thick black rimmed eye glasses who took every opportunity to complain about customer.

What can I say....this place hit the spot and left me wanting another bowl. 
I ordered the Jinya #2 (spicy chicken bowl for $9.55). I got it without onion and I added an egg. They have 3 levels of hot/spicy, and I went with the hottest. It wasn't unbearable, but it had a good kick, in my opinion it was just right. The bean sprouts added crunch, I couldn't really taste the spinach, the chicken was moist and there was a good amount of noodles. It was the perfect serving size and left me satisfied. 
Went to the bathroom before leaving and found myself in awwww of the toilet that sat before me. This toilet was the king of all toilets, and was amazing! This thing was huge, lit up when I came in and the seat cover lifted on its own. It cleaned itself for me and was ready to go. I sat down to find a heated seat cushion and control panel to my left. Awesome! They had rinse, spray, and all kinds of gadgets for your bathroom experience. A must try. =)

Many people like different ramen places in Las Vegas and I have 2 favorites right now and one of them is Jinya. 

The food is amazing! I really like the pork bun, the crispy chicken, and the pork ear chicharron (those are just the appetizers). All of these took me by surprise because I did not think that I would actually enjoy those foods. I expecting to think eh. The crispy chicken has to be cooked in some sort of god sent seasoning and it is nice and crispy and very hot...(but super yummy). The pork bun was delicious! My cousin ordered it and we shared it but it was so flavorful and I really wanted to eat more, but it was all gone :(. BUT, we should really talk about the RAMEN! It is so good and flavorful! Some places have a more specific flavor but I think Jinya encompasses a good taste in their ramen and it makes me happy. 

The staff is very nice and they give very good service. I really like them and they take really good care of you while your there. Which I realize must be super hard because this place is always busy. I feel like ramen places are always really busy and Jinya is no excuse. 

The atmosphere is very bar like in my opinion. It is very dark and intimate.  I feel like a lot of restaurants are going for dim lighting and dark settings now. I don't know if I like it or not. However, I will say I love having the big table in the middle. It feels very communal. Which, Im not sure is good or bad. It just has a welcoming atmosphere for the most part. Sometimes its awkward if you sit directly by someone you don't know but most of the time people are really nice at the big table.

It's a small restaurant and usually busy during dinner time and late night, but so worth the wait if it is busy. It's also open until 3am so it's a good place after getting dranks or if you're hungry in the early hours of the morning.

First of all, the service was not that great. Myself and two friends went and we all ran out of water and had to flag someone down for awhile to fill them. 

Happy hour has some sweet deals though. Got sake for $5 and some apps;

Takoyaki - I love takoyaki. And I've eaten it too many times to count. It wasn't served hot at all which made me sad. Good, but I've had better. (Poku poku has amazing takoyaki! :p)

Pork chashu w/ kimchee - I was very confused. It didn't taste like kimchi at all nor was there any kimchi in it. The pork was good though. 

JINYA bun - I enjoyed this a lot. The pork was very juicy and melted in my mouth. 


Now, for the ramen, I got;

JINYA Tonkatsu black - really appreciated the broth. I could really tell how long it took to get that type of flavor into that broth. I've had many salty broths at other Ramen spots and this wasn't overpowering. I also love garlic. They allow you to put freshly squeezed garlic in it! I also got butter and corn in my soup. The butter was huge!  I didn't meant to put the entire thing in... but oh well. I loved the garlic chips. 


After eating it took a long time for the check. Then our server was non existent. Someone else came with our check and set it down on the table. Not one person said here you go. Or thank you!

I'm a vegetarian, so it's difficult to find a place with a vegetarian friendly ramen.  I came around an hour before closing.  This is due to it being the only time I could go.

When we first walked in, it was super intriguing.  Very dimmed lights...loud music too. My husband and I waited maybe 5-10 at most.  Nothing too bad.  While waiting, we noticed that they have a grade C for their food safety... Both my husband and I are very well educated on the proper ways to obtain and A, so we were a little scared.  When we finally was seated, we automatically noticed why they have a C... The dishes weren't sparkling clean, the kitchen looked like they could use people who know how to clean kitchens correctly...When we looked out our spoons, we had to clean them more as it was not cleaned to the fullest extent.

In regards to the food.  I personally thought the takoyaki was great.  The vegetarian ramen tasted a lot better than I anticipated.  So I was excited.

But since it was so close to closing, my husband and I felt rushed to finish eating since they literally gave us our bill the moment we got our bowls.  Quite frankly, we just ate as much as we could and got out as quick as we can since we didn't want to feel like a burden.  

I feel like if I came during the day time, (hahah, only if I had the time), the experience would perhaps be less rushed and I could've enjoyed my noodles more.  Overall, I did enjoy the food...It was good.....",T52SQsL2K8MZ00Bq7NK8eA,0,0,4,tn7QuchGB723jM7BcVWhQQ

[Service] The Service wasn't too bad, they were a little slow and quiet...a little too quiet for my taste but wasn't sure if it was because we were sitting at the bar side. Could have been a little more attentive though. 

[Food] The food was great. I really enjoyed my bowl of ramen (Spicy Tonkatsu Ramen). The spice was there and I could feel the kick! The flavor was really flashing and the ramen noodles itself tasted fresh and cooked perfectly. I also enjoyed the sides that were offered! Lots to choose from, I'd recommend the seasoned egg, bok Choy, Nori, and fried onions!

Overall great place...the only reason it didn't get a higher star from me was because we ordered hot sake and we found a small bug in them...TWICE!

Food: 4.9 stars

This was my first real ramen experience, so I have nothing to compare it to, other than store bought packets, lol! 

To me, it blew my expectations out of the...broth? Ha ha.  I tried the current chef special since it was only available for a limited time. I added fresh garlic (comes on the side with a press) and corn.   

The broth was very flavorful an unlike anything I had ever experienced.  It is very different from pho or any other soup. It is a class of its own, and it's world class.  The egg was the most flavorful egg Ive ever had. Some ramen comes with egg, some you can add it on for $1, which I will always do if it doesn't come with it, it was that good. The only issue I had with the ramen was the broth was a tad too salty for my preference, hence the 4.9 stars, lol. 

The famous Jinya bun was amazing.  Get this. Go during happy hr and its only  $3. It's got delicious pork, yummy sauce, and greens bundled up into a pillowing steamed bun like a taco.  Highly reccomend.

Food

1.Homemade tofu- the concept is interesting. They poured the hot soy milk in front of you and after five minutes the tofu started to get firm. It comes with seasoning you can add to your tofu. I personally think it's fun to order and it doesn't taste too bad. However, homemade tofu in Raku is still my favorite.

2. Crispy chicken- it comes with 5/10/15 pieces. They are not the usual karage where the chicken nugget is bite size. I would say they are twice as big as normal karage. However, that was my favorite dish of the night. Chicken was marinated perfect, crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. 

3. Tonkatsu black- I was impressed that they give your a whole egg instead of half. The pork was tender and noodle was nice and chewy. The broth is not salty which is a plus for me. Tonkastu in Monta is too salty for my palate. However, I think the broth can be more flavorful. This is why I'm giving four stars.

I like that the menu has several different appetizers that you wouldn't usually find at a ramen spot.. We enjoyed the spicy tuna on crispy rice.. The spicy tuna did not have any kind of ""fishy"" taste and the crispy rice was perfectly fried. I recommend trying the chicken ramen.. You don't see that everywhere and the broth was surprisingly just as creamy and rich as the pork broth.. I do, however, prefer the pork chashu that comes with the pork ramen VS the chicken that comes with the chicken ramen. 

Service was good but we did get a few plates that were not properly cleaned.. :/

My normal go-to is Sora, but since my sis & I wanted it after midnight, Jinya was our best shot. For just us two, we waited for 20 mins to get seated. When we got there, there 10 parties ahead of us so I thought this was not a bad wait at all.

We got the Sprouting Up Ramen & the JINYA Tonkotsu Black. The sprouting up ramen had waaay too much brussel sprouts IMO, but the broth and noddles were still very good. My sis enjoyed the tonkotsu. It's got a little bit of spice but not too much - just perfect amount for those of us that can't handle the spice. And finally... we got the Tokyo Curry Rice & a Crispy Chicken and omg... this has got to be one of the best Japanese curry I've ever had!!! I didn't have much expectations since this is primarily a ramen house but I wanted to try their curry too, and I'm so glad I did. It is so flavorful, the texture is perfect (not too runny or too chunky), and the rice to curry ratio was good. Paired with the crispy chicken, we devoured this in just a few minutes before we got our ramen. YUM YUM YUMMMMM.

For a busy night, I thought the service was superb. I can tell that management definitely cares about training employees to be efficient & customer-oriented. Our server checked in on us frequently & we didn't have to wait too long for our food when we got seated. I'd definitely come back and try some other new items on this new menu! The only reason I took off a star is because I thought the noddle consistency could've been better. It was a bit too chewy but still acceptable.",1mwLPy_kpeZsB-fHm02cMQ,1,1,4,-hN-pjfkc69hLrJkbv9Fvw

I'm pretty new to this Ramen craze and before dining at Momofuku at The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas I decided to take my friend girl up on her offer for a ""ramen"" lunch introduction.

I want to like Jinya honest I do but there were way to many service failures to count Sunday afternoon that took away from the overall experience. Side Note: majority of my friends rave about this place being phenomenal. Returning is a gamble at this time!!!

Main:
I ordered Vegetable Ramen ($10) and it was just okay. I asked for spicy but I don't think that was communicated very well. No hint of spice in sight!

My friend ordered a ""chef special"" chicken ramen ($11.00) which comes with half egg. After a short debate with our server about ordering an additional half egg to her order; the ramen arrived with no eggs at all! Awkward!
Appetizers:
Caramelized Cauliflower ($6.20)was by far the best item ordered. Bold flavor and the pine nuts were a great addition.
The chickpeas were loaded with cumin. A bit too much to be honest but I did enjoy them! 
We ordered Spicy Creamy Shrimp ($7.80) which literally arrived at the end of our meal. The server came by two additional times and acknowledged she forgot the remainder appetizer as she continued to forget! Flavorful and delicious but late af!
Dessert:
 I ordered the Panna Cotta ($3.50) which was also blah! The graham cracker topping and ice cream taste like it was uncovered in a fridge for quite some time. My friend ordered a block pop ($3.80) which arrived unwrapped and a little moist like it sat out a few minutes (she shared this dessert is always wrapped). 

The icing on the cake was our server coughing directly into her hands before setting up the small table next to us without washing her hands. She touched the napkins and the spoons. I'm no sanitation police but this was totally unacceptable!

Not sure the total because my friend felt bad recommending the place and took care of the tab!",9PODl32fViCXhN4NxBdGPQ,3,3,3,5PPDgWYzXg05Q4y-PCIs6w

4981563,2014-12-07,1,gx2yPrOJSwF1ApJYdGBWIw,"This might be my new favorite ramen spot in town.

Most people would steer towards Monta to get their ramen fix and I don't blame them. It's a legit spot. But this time around I was near the Chinatown area and wasn't feeling the idea of having to wait so we decided to give Jinya a shot since I've heard about how good they were from a variety of different people.

Located inside an old Taco Bell restaurant, they really did a great job remodeling the exterior and interior to create a cozy and dim environment. A little bigger than the Monta in Chinatown but I think ramen spots are suppose to be intimate in size. Anyway, let's talk food.

Ordered the Crispy Spicy Tuna since the prices here were half the price than they would be on The Strip. I was curious to see if there was going to be a difference in taste due to the price cut but nope! It's just as good! Also ordered a side of gyozas (ask for them extra crispy) since I usually like to throw them inside my ramen and it balanced out really well. My boyfriend even enjoyed them plain and he's usually not a gyoza or potsticker lover.

I decided to try the Tonkatsu Black and my God it did not disappoint. I was pretty surprised by how it wasn't as salty since I'm usually gulping down my water cup after a few slurps of broth. My face usually swells up after a large sodium intake but the fact that it didn't was very impressive in my book.

Knocked down a star since there was so many servers on the floor but I still had to flag a waitress down for some basic requests. Mind you that this restaurant is small. Service should be more than just taking your order and disappearing but I'm sure this place will look up since they're still fairly new.

We've eaten at Jinya a couple of times now. The first when it was still pretty new, and my boyfriend and I both tried Tonkatsu's. I did the Tonkatsu Assari and he the Tonkatsu Black. It's weird because when I eat Ramen, I guess I don't automatically notice the difference in flavor right away, I just think they're all good. I tried mine next to my boyfriends and was able to compare. Both were delicious, so both win. We also enjoy JInya because they offer the option of making your ramen into a combo which includes  a salad and one other item (gyoza, fried chicken, cali roll, or a some kind of meat bowl) We've ordered the friend chicken and gyoza. Good deal! and the chicken is so incredibly juicy and seasoned very well. The atmosphere is really nice also; I liked the decor, but think they could have utilized the center of the room a little better, rather than throwing that oversized group table in the middle. The table is so wide that the center doesn't get any use really; instead it takes up a lot of wasted space. Which wouldn't be a problem if the food tastes horrible and people didn't come there. But seeing as the food is good, and people will visit, they will be busy. Jinya should have realized this and, instead created two tables in the space available that would have been accommodating.

Oh yeah, this is a note for you ladies. Don't forget to check out the bathroom. They have the BEST TOILET I've ever seen. I probably could've stayed in the bathroom for a while and just played with all the amazing things this smart toilet could do. haha.",WRnqI0l71Bi9wK2wsnETSQ,1,0,5,4Fa8cv94kOlOHMeeq8Qv9w

Noodles portion was nice too, filled up real satisfied :) and they offered real ramen, I mean, closer to what we can get in japan. And the broth, I'll give it 4/5, it's tasty, but of course, with MSG. But still fine... all ramen places in the US are like that.

What I appreciate most is the CHAR SIU!!!!! The PORK comes with the ramen!!! You really should go trying that!!! 5/5!!! (I'll even give 10 out of 5!!!!!)

It is creamy, rich and full of flavor. THey have several options for their broth, I went with a spicy tonkotsu broth with a spicy level of ""spicy"" which i assume is considered medium. The ramen was cooked firm the way I like it, it had pork slices, but more sliced than normal, eggs, green onions and some of the other regular stuff you'd expect in the ramen. 

I honestly felt like I could have gotten away with the tonkotsu assari which had about the same things in my ramen minus being spicy. Reason being was they have a bunch of condiments to still make your broth spicy so you could save a couple of bucks. 

JINYA also offers a ton of toppings, they also have some really fresh garlic you get to mash yourself. I was not a huge fan of their takoyaki, too much batter, not enough octopus imo. They also have fried brussel sprouts in truffle oil, tasted like any other tampura fried item, truffle oil does not elevate the taste.

Let me just add in that I've never had Ramen before, this was my first time. I'm not quite sure that it's my kind of food. 

I ordered their Vegan Creamy Ramen (as did everyone else at the table). I was told to add egg in it by the server. (I'm not vegan but I enjoy eating things with no meat or dairy sometimes) the Ramen came out fairly quickly, no complaints about that whatsoever. When it came out the noodles were delicious and hot along with the broth. However, the egg was cold, and as was the Tofu. I'm not sure if that's how it's supposed to be but I personally prefer all my food to be hot when it gets to the table. 

Other than that, the flavor was nice and the noodles were amazing. I would eat here again but I would reiterate to the waiter that I'd like the food to be hotter.",y3BRV9BnG7OZTJ7mRcMP_A,1,0,3,LMf6Ovzb9r1CFSUAuwgyjA

I had the miso black ramen combo with crispy chicken and house salad with a jinya bun and their ice cream flan for dessert. 

The ramen was too fatty for my taste and the chashu was a bitty fatty as well. The crispy chricken had a nice flavor but that too was heavy and oily after a few pieces. The jinya bun was mediocre at best, as it was just sweet. The desert was very good and was the saving grace of this being a 1 Star.

Ordered the veggie ramen bowl. They weren't kidding when they said ""veggies"", the bowl was overflowing with greens and vegetables. Awesome amount of food for the price you pay. The have various other bowls with chicken and pork as well, and you can get it spicy or not.

They also have the option of adding extras to your order. Extra noodles, meat, egg, etc. Really great idea, since I think we can all agree we need a little more noodle in our lives.

They have a surprising selection of beer here. While it's no where near a 'craft beer bar', they do have a couple craft beers that pair great with your bowl of noodles.

The only downside to this place is it is small, so chances are if you go during normal dining hours, it's going to be packed and a bit of a wait. However the Ramen Bar is open late, so if you need a late night meal it's perfect.",4N-HU_T32hLENLntsNKNBg,4,4,5,UG8jpVLRg-Tn7a7vsZktBQ

They also have a nice selection of appetizers and side dishes. The sweet potatoes were cool, but a bit too starchy for my taste.

We ordered the ""fresh garlic"" that is supposed to be free and the server never brought it to us. We reminded them twice too. Another complaint is that the first time I came here, my noodles were stuck together in a ball and they looked sticky and gross. And my boyfriend told me they made them fresh and when I took a bite it was raw dough and and flour and it was disgusting. I lost my appetite after that.

Even though the room is dark and loud music is bumping i felt comfortable in here.

Lets get to the food me and the wifey had the Jinya #1 and a order of shrimp balls.

Jinya #1- (3/5) i think when it comes to ramen i have a hard time being amazed or having it make my eyes roll back on taking a bite. im used to eating alot of different asian noodle soups. it was a creamy pork broth with egg noodles topped with pork,fried garlic and a boiled egg that wasnt cooked all the way so when you crack it you get that oozing yolk. i think the egg tasted weird though but thats just me. i think it would have been better with some wontons or bbq pork but then it wouldnt be japanese.

Shrimp Ball (3/5)- I think it was like those shrimp balls you get at dim sum with the sweet mayo but it had some fried garlic on the outside so it wasnt nothing special. they garnished it with chilli peppers but its something that i probably would order again. 

The service was great and they were attentive and can actually hear what youre asking for even though that music was loud. Space is very limited and after we came in there was a grip of people that came in that seemed to wait for a long time to get seated. im glad i came and got seated right away. thanks for some decent ramen unless im craving it i probably wont be back",aWXGwath_dSGPwNdFiy9BQ,0,0,3,zZZEnRx4ug_3IHnYxqVI8Q

Their seating options are individual booths, a seat at the bar, a seat at the community table or a small booth.  Just be sure that you are open to any type of seating.  

During my visit, I ordered the Spicy Ramen Chicken, but they were out of Chicken so I had them add Pork to my bowl (which I was super nervous about).  I also added Corn and Green Onions to my bowl.  For additional charges you can add additional noodles, broth, spices, vegetables, etc to your bowl.  We also ordered the crispy chicken as an appetizer.  The appetizer came out super fast and was so good.  The chicken was cooked perfectly.  It was hot, it contained all of it's juices and a crisp outer shell.  The Rame came out in a huge bowl (which I couldn't finish and ended up taking half home with me).

Ever since I've gone to ramen places in Japantown LA, most ramen places here don't taste as good. Jinya, however, is up to par with the better ramen places I've tried out of Vegas.

None of us are vegetarians, although our friend doesn't eat pork, but this place definitely had something for everyone. 

It's located in Chinatown, and very easy to find. The inside is nice, and intimate. The decor is something you'd expect to find in a restaurant in Chinatown. We opted to sit at the bar, facing the line cooks (open kitchen). They were all friendly, especially our server. I wish I would have asked her name, or kept our receipt so I could give her a proper shout out. 

I have to mention that they were out of thick noodles and wontons when we went in. They were very up front about it, including posting a sign on the front door.  

I ordered their Sprouting Up Ramen, and it was delicious! I am glad I ordered a few extra eggs in the bowl. The thin noodles were really good! I usually order thick noodles, personally, but was pleasantly surprised. The tonkotsu broth is flavorful, the slices of pork are generous, and the bowl was really balanced.

5291366,2017-09-26,0,gx2yPrOJSwF1ApJYdGBWIw,"One of my favorite ramen places in town.

Environment: The restaurant is located just up the street from the Palms casino and is in the general Chinatown area. The outside gives the impression of the place being small and the surroundings aren't exactly the prettiest setting ever but upon entering the décor is hip. They play trendy music, have nice lighting, and a variety of seating options including small booth, a communal table, and seats at the ramen bar. Jinya can get busy though so the limited seating does sometimes require a wait so be warned!

Food: While at most ramen places the most important thing is picking the right ramen, at Jinya the appetizers are just as good. Their jinya buns are amazing, the tebasaki was surprisingly delicious and although they don't have it anymore their crispy rice spicy tuna used to be great too! However, on to the ramen, I typically go with the tonkotsu black ramen, which has most of the ingredients I usually add to ramen anyway: garlic, hard-boiled egg, nori, etc. I have also tried the spicy chicken ramen, Cha Cha Cha ramen, and the sprouting up ramen, each of which is just as good. 

Service: Service is generally good, especially for a fast-paced ramen spot. We had multiple employees checking up on us throughout our meal and I never felt like I was left needing something.

Overall, Jinya is one of my go-to ramen places, and I since the Monta location in Henderson shut down not too long ago I bet I will be coming here a little more frequently than usual!",5fxjUT0sLg9ueMAYtn2PZw,0,0,5,cJxzF877cUbHNEsJN8ssbA

Brussels Sprouts Tempura:
My bad for not seeing the ""tempura"" part. I wanted a vegetable...fried veggies just don't make sense - what's the point? Aside from being deep-fat fried, these poor things are doused in truffle oil and heavily salted. After forcing ourselves to finish the sprouts, there was a good teaspoon-ful of oil at the bottom. Veggies aren't supposed to give you a heart attack. 2/5

Fried Chicken:
Kara age. Lightly breaded but extremely oily and salty - Soul Glo oily. The pieces of chicken were not dry. 2/5

Jinya Bun:
Pork belly bao. You get a nice thick piece of pork belly with sauce, Japanese mayo and greens. 4/5

Tonkotsu Black:
Pork broth with chashu, kikurage, green onions, nori, seasoned egg, garlic chips, garlic oil, fried onion and thin noodles. Probably one of the best bowl of ramen I've had in Vegas. The noodles were perfectly cooked and the broth was excellent because of the garlic. 5/5

The service was good and the place is typical of a ramen bar. I appreciate the variety on their menu. The ramen was great and they are a ramen bar. But man, the oilyness and saltiness of the appetizers were unforgivable. We walked out with our lips all pale and feeling so bloated after eating all that salt.

5320628,2016-01-13,0,gx2yPrOJSwF1ApJYdGBWIw,"I originally wanted to give this place 2 stars, but considering how the service was actually decent and the overall establishment was clean, I opted for 3 stars instead. For a small location, Jinya is quite nicely decorated--it is very hip, modern and trendy. The fact that Jinya is also one of the only ramen places in Las Vegas that is open until 3 am also makes it a plus. I can definitely see this restaurant being the perfect joint for late night dates, large group gatherings and after work hang out. The service here is also very good. The food comes out fast and the servers are very attentive. Now, that being said, the quality of food itself is a completely different story.

When my boyfriend and I went to Jinya, we both tried the tonkotsu ramen. I ordered the Tonkotsu Black (pork broth, pork char siu, nori, garlic chips, thin noodles) and my boyfriend ordered the Tonkotsu Spicy (pork broth, pork char siu, bean sprouts, thick noodles). For an average of $11 per bowl, the ramen was nothing out of the ordinary that you couldn't get some where else like at Monta or Sora. The tonkotsu broth itself was one of the heaviest broth that I have ever tasted in ramen. As soon as it was in my mouth, I could taste the richness of the broth and literally feel a thick layer of butter/fat coat the top of my tongue and mouth. While I understand that ramen joints typically enhance the savory taste of the broth with ingredients such as fat and butter, however, the broth at Jinya was so rich that it made the entire dish too overwhelming to finish. It almost felt as if I was consuming pure fat, butter and oil mixed with salt. 

You know you ate some serious heavy sh**t when you can still taste the fat coat your tongue and the back of your throat several hours later. 

I'm normally the type of person with a very strong stomach. However, that night when I got home, I felt very sick with heartburn.  While I don't expect to walk into a ramen place coming out feeling detoxed, because let's face it-- ramen is usually an indulgence of umami and flavors.. But, I have never experienced such a heaviness feeling from other ramen places like I do from Jinya. I guess there is such a thing as too much richness-- a concept I usually don't mind. But here, I feel like it's overboard. Not to say that it's not worth giving this place a second try.. but if I ever go back, I would never order the tonkotsu ramen again.",3HXyXpdkH1rNAEEaSxQucw,0,1,3,-pKyFFxaNJBvRPoOyD9pzg
5322429,2015-08-27,7,gx2yPrOJSwF1ApJYdGBWIw,"Before JINYA, I had tried one packet of Top Ramen in college, was disgusted and never considered it an option again. All that changed after one of my bestest friend's birthday. She stated she wanted Ramen and I told her about college and she exclaimed, ""that's not REAL ramen!"" I agreed, since when was accepting a 10 cent package as the be-all, end-all of ramen? It wasn't. I was so ignorant, given my love for virtually all Asian fare (expect Korean). 

JINYA has a sleek modern feel. A large table in the center is used for large parties or several small partied. It should be noted the rest of the establishment has maybe 4 seats at the bar, and the rest are booths that seat 4 comfortably. Not a place for large groups.

On my last trip I got a the Cha Cha Cha (my favorite to date!),a chicken ramen with seasoned egg, tons of herbs, and tons of garlic as well a side of fresh garlic and a garlic press. I dream about this dish. I've brought friends to taste their noodle delights and they too are hooker. I am so afraid to try Ramen elsewhere because JINYA serves up a bowl of heaven. I rarely get sick and pho is my GO-TO, but I rue the day I get down with the sickness and destroy a bowl of broth and noodly goodness. Seriously, it's next level.

I usually order a combo with a salad and/or gyoza/california roll). The salad is great and I whatever dressing they use on it, is flavorful and unlike anything I've tasted before. During a happy hour I tried a JINYA bun which was delicious (and almost as good as Fat Choy's). Oh, yes, folks, you read that correctly, JINYA has a dope happy hour (3 PM - 5PM)!

We started off with the organic tofu, which was made in front of you! It was pretty awesome to see. The texture of the tofu was a bit rough than what I'm used to and when I was eating it, all I could think about was how I wanted some syrup to go along with it and turn it into dessert tofu! Taste wise, nothing really special but interesting experience.

I also got a Jinya Bun to try, which was pretty much a pork belly bun. I gotta say...I've had better. It was a lot of sauce on the bun and most of the times, it covered the flavors of the pork belly and .. I didn't really like that. It was a sweet smokey type of sauce and it wasn't exactly very appealing to me. 

As for the ramen, I decided to go with the spicy chicken ramen at their spiciest level. I normally go with a tonkotsu but most ramen places in Vegas make their tonkotsu broth really heavy and salty so I didn't really want to go there. Instead of their thin noodles, I decided to sub it with their thick noodles. I like my noodles al dente and most places don't cook their thin ramen noodles that way so I took the chance and went with the thick ones.
 
Good choices on my part. The broth was light and very good. It is not heavy, not salty, and not too spicy even though I can take really spicy things. Best of all, I didn't get tired of the taste of it. When I normally eat tonkotsu, I get tired of the flavor really fast. The noodles were perfectly al dente! 

On the side note, their bathroom is very romantic. It was quite dim with some lights around the mirror and lights around their toilet. Their toilet's lid automatically comes up! Its one of those bidets -- pretty spiffy. All they really need is some soothing music in the bathroom and we could have a nice rendezvous there!

My husband and I were eager to try the Jinya bun and it was delicious!! The charshu pork was so tender and flavorful, it's a must! I'd come back here just to eat it!

My husband ordered the Tonkatsu Black and outta 10, he rates it 7.8. He enjoyed it but it wasn't the best. 

Our friend Ryan and I got the Tonkatsu Asari, the broth was light and the ramen was filling. Wish there was one more piece of the pork, it was yummy- it comes with one! I usually don't finish mine, so my husband added my thick noodles to his broth. Ryan prefers a thicker noodle for the ramen.

This was the response from the server after I received not lukewarm, but actually COLD soup.  I have been a regular here for years and I used to recommend the place to other chefs and restaurant professionals that Iwork with. However, the quality and service have declined so much over the years I would tell anyone to avoid this place at all costs.

The last four times I have come here the ramen was barely warm. The noodles had been sitting too long and gotten slimy and the broth gelatinous. Refrigerator cold add on toppings didn't help improve the experience. 

Let's talk about ""service"". Last night I was there with two friends. We ordered an appetizer and drinks and three entrees from one server who never once returned to the table again for the entire meal. The drinks and apps came in a timely manner. (""Whoops I forgot glasses for the pitcher of beer"") 

We got one bowl of ramen. Ten minutes later we got one more. Another 10 goes by an I flag down a random server to tell him my ramen is cold ( it's been in the window for 10 minutes, ""How about that microwave, for food you just paid for, that wasn't made right, how bout we just nuke the crap out of it for you?  It's the very BEST we can do"") and we are still missing an entree.  The server  dismissively says, ""Oh, I know, we are still waiting on that"".   (We just figured you didn't want to all eat at the same time, but rather, take turns watching each other eat)

The location had a lot of parking and the spot seemed quite busy. Some people were waiting outside the door so I kinda got iffy to dine in, assuming that the wait was long. Asked the hostess how long the wait was and she said 15 mins so I went ahead and reserved a spot.

The ramen was good, very flavorful and rich broth. I got the jinya tonkotsu black, and it's a pork and chicken broth that wasn't too oily like some ramen broths can get. The only complaint I had was that I got a ton of noodles but not enough broth. Also, the char siu pork wasn't as fatty as I'd like, and it was cut into thin flat strips (I like thicker cuts). It did fall apart easily though, showing it was slow cooked for a long time. The whole egg was perfectly cooked (soft yolk inside but not runny). 

My party got the fried shrimp balls which were the absolute best I've ever had!! The fried crust had just a touch of sweetness (tasted like cane sugar?) & nuts, the shrimp paste inside was a mix of minced shrimp and chopped shrimp, so there were larger pieces of shrimp in there. there was also some of the spicy mayonnaise dipping sauce in the shrimp ball too, making it super moist and delicious. 

We also got the tempura Brussels sprouts which was a miss. Had a touch of black truffle oil & salt, but it didn't come with the typical tempura dipping sauce which I like. I didn't like the taste of black truffle oil with the Brussels sprouts. truffle oil already has an almost bitter, savory taste and Brussels sprouts do too, so it was a bit too much for me. 

Four stars was mainly because the music was too loud! The bass was pounding away and I had to semi shout to chat with the others I was eating with. It was so annoying that we were in and out in 35 minutes, and didn't really get to sit and savor everything. 

Service was friendly. The women's bathroom was super high tech Japanese. flushing the toilet takes some time because I had to figure out how to flush it. You flush it by pressing a tiny round button on the side of the bowl. I don't like touching toilets (I usually flush by pressing my foot down on the flushing handle), so this was gross for me. But I appreciated the super high tech toilet, just too bad it's not in my home for me to personally enjoy (tmi!)",mHp4g3_z2dmD9UPXzuE8bQ,4,3,4,sRXdeRq8a1f9pkH7SUw7sg
5492447,2014-08-04,6,gx2yPrOJSwF1ApJYdGBWIw,"Newly opened restaurant, so definitely a few kinks to work out. The first problem is the shortage of wait staff and delayed seating of patients. We waited approximately 10 minutes for a table for 4, even though there was an empty table available the whole time we waited.  A party of 2 walked out since they were also waiting, but several 2 seat options were available the whole time they waited as well.... So efficiency and customer service definitely needs some work!  The restaurant decor is modern with wood paneling.  They also have a large family dining style table in the center, good for a large group.  One thing lacking is lunch service...I think they are missing out financially by starting their service at 3pm....
 
In regards to appetizer options, I would say Jinya ranks #1 of the ramen restaurants (even over Monta Chaya) for the variety of offerings.  The pork belly buns are $3.80 each or $3 during HH 3-5PM.  The pork belly is extremely tender and flavorful and the bun is nice and fluffy (pretty much like Peking duck but pork belly inside).  We also tried the truffle oil tempura brussel sprouts which were tasty but I've had better brussel sprouts (i.e. Yonaka).  The crispy chicken (comes in 5,10,15 piece orders) was extremely moist and had a nice crispy exterior, paired with a yuzu soy sauce. I would definitely order the chicken again.  I was a little disappointed when we sat down and the waiter started listing off multiple items they had run out of (i.e takoyaki, shrimp toast, assari ramen, etc).  Not really a good start with half the menu items missing or unavailable =(  I'm a takoyaki fiend, so I was very sad to hear they ran out.  The waiter informed us that the shrimp toast is being removed from the menu....not sure why, since he said it was delicious.

In terms of ramen, the following are my rankings for Vegas:
1. Kogashi ramen with thick noodles (Fukumimi)
2. Tonkatsu black with thick noodles (Jinya)
3. Tonkatsu with thick noodles (Monta)

The tonkatsu broth at Jinya has depth of flavor and the broth is very hearty.  I prefer the broth here over Monta, since Monta can often be too salty.  I ordered the tonkatsu black which has garlic oil and chips, chili paste, a whole seasoned egg, nori, kikurage (fungus), green onion, nori,  The flavor marriage of these items makes the broth stand out and I would say the broth is on par with Fukukimi's broth, albeit different.  The pork belly is not quite as fatty as Monta's,  but is flavorful and tender similar to Fukumimi's.   The one thing that leaves Jinya at #2 in my rankings, is the consistency of the noodles.  My noodles were slightly overcooked and some noodles were clumped together in a ball....  Hopefully, they work that out, since I think the consistency of the noodles is very important to the ramen experience.  A nice touch is the raw garlic that is free, they bring over a garlic press so you can have fresh pressed garlic to your hearts content.   The wait time for the ramen was about 15-20 minutes after our appetizers...they are definitely lacking the efficiency of Monta.  However, if you want to sit and chat, this is the place to go.  You never feel like they are rushing you out of the restaurant.   I'll definitely be back to try this place out in another month or so, I'm guessing things will be even better then!",Tdv7HZa4Hyjm-X0MtNmeag,11,10,4,op-hx2bNQKAdZaF87dLagA

It's kind of mind blowing how I was dying for just one legit ramen joint in Las Vegas only a few years back and now I could do a week straight without going to the same spot.  I'd also have to chug 500 gallons of water during said week but still....

I was looking for a basic, no frills ramen and their ""Tonkotsu Assari"" fit that bill perfectly.  Our server also mentioned it was his favorite.  Assari consisted of pork broth, chashu, green onion, egg and bean sprouts, but the thick noodles were the clincher for me.  Most of Jinya's ramen offerings come with thin noodles which I am usually not down with although I didn't ask if they would substitute.  

It's a good thing they put me at a corner table since I slurped my face off.  From top to bottom, it was solid through and through.  There is better chashu to be had in town, but this was still a nice bowl of satisfaction.  I'd also skip the salad (dressing was gross) plus gyoza add-on and opt for another tapas dish instead.  

To my knowledge, Jinya is also the first and only spot in Vegas to do takoyaki the right way.  I've had so many awful versions of it since moving from Japan that I had given up hope.  I was delirious after my first bite!  The light crunch, generous chunks of octopus with its signature sauce, mayonnaise and dried bonito flakes put my taste buds on another planet.  It was a terrific dish that I will be having multiple times in the future.  Love that they're open until 3am!!

Don't get me wrong though, the pork was delicious and tender, but the pieces were much more generous over at Sora.

Their salmon poke tacos are the best, which is a must try especially if you go during their Happy Hour.

5599556,2014-08-03,4,gx2yPrOJSwF1ApJYdGBWIw,"This extended weekend had been full of good eats, let's see if we can keep the streak going and what better place to do that than at the newly opened Cali transplant, Jinya Ramen Bar.  

Jinya is located close to the hustling and bustling Vegas area with tourist and local traffic alike, just off Decatur and Flaming-O, away from the compettion on Spring Mountain.  Upon arrival, the place looked closed and includes a drive through that is not functional and uncertain if and when it will be up and running.  You will find the entrance on the Eastside of the building, trust me, it's there.  (Shouts to Downtown Cocktail Lounge's secret door)

Once we got in, it totally looked like and had the feel of a bar, only that you are taking shots of tonkotsu broth.   Actually, I took a peek at the alcohol menu and it was respectable.  Problem was the place reminded me of that ""dark dining"" phenomenon all over NYC cause it made me want to refund my Lasik work.  Hard to order when you can't see, just saying. Cool Victorian loop style light bulbs that were totally ineffective to say the least.  Somehow, the wifey was able to see done good friends and fellow Yelp elitists, Laurie and Derek, that did liven up the mood. 

Oh yeah, weird to the wise... don't get  stuck with your dominant eating arm against the wall of you are seated in the tandem mini booth unless you want bruises.  It's tiny and requires an Orbitz baby seat to get in and out. 

When it was time to order, I was saddened to learn that they were out of the tonkotsu asuri.  Not only that the shrimp toast and takoyaki was nowhere to be found as well.  So I opted for the Tokyo Tonkotsu Special, but to top it off (or lack of topping it off), Jinya was out of eggs too!  Kinda turning out yo be more like Jipya instead of Jinya!  I was slowly starting to think that the opening may have been premature. 

The waitress was pleasant and from Hawaii.  She could easily tell we were too but is still subject to the same brutal scrutiny (if warranted) just line everyone else.  Oh girl just needs to expand her knowledge on the craft beer menu, but she got redemption by showing me each if the bottles and cans up close to get the real deal Holyfield.

The food came out rather quick and I gave it the broth test right off the bat and the verdict is...manslaughter, cause man did I slaughter the ish out the bowl, maybe it's because I hadn't eaten since breakfast at Rise and Shine this morning.  The flavor that stood out profoundly to me was the bonito flakes and the thick noodles was a Nice touch.  I can't Complain about the chashu though, the chicken chashu too.  I wonder if it is a stretch to say it rivals Monta's melt in yo mouth chashu?!? Not to mention we got double the chashu since they were out of everything we initially wanted.

The spicy shrimp tempura was mediocre at best, not traditional by any stretch of the imagination.  The mayo sauce, ehhhh not a fan, but the skrimpz were big but it still reminded me of buffet style and not impressive at all.  The seaweed Salad had more vegetable greens than seaweed and the pork belly bowl tasted a lot like rinsed adobo.  The wifey said the spicy chicken ramen was delicious though, you know what they say, happy wife, happy life.

What they lacked in menu items, they sure made up for in Cool Japanese craft beer and double chashu.  Some new interesting brews seen for the first time included, Yona Yona ale and Coedo Shikkoku, but went with the Suiyoubi No Neko.  No I'm not bi and yes I have a neck, but true translation is ""Wednesday (humpday) Cat,"" a Belgian style white that was especially good on Saturday chased down with almond pudding for dessert.  Oh yeah, they played good music that prompted me to give them a score of 3.2, would been a whole point higher had they dished out what we wanted.

Food: I had the Tokyo Tonkatsu and have to say it tasted great. The broth was quite flavorful. It had a great consistency which not only could you taste but could also observe if you let sit too long and cool, it would start to congeal. A good sign in my opinion. The jinya bun was also great. I dont think the kewpie Mayo is necessary when the chashu is so good by itself. The piece of pork would melt in your mouth when you bit into it, both in the Jinya bun and the ramen. Excellent! The crushed garlic was a nice free addition which I welcomed. The noodles were were good but I would probably try the thick ones to compare to make a better judgement.

The one bothersome quality about JINYA is that there's usually a line.  As with most of the ramen shops in town, this place gets crowded quickly and you have to be patient while waiting to be seated.  Other than that, JINYA is solid as a rock.  I am a fan of their Tonkotsu Black Ramen as well as the Wonton Chicken Ramen, which I just discovered on my last visit.    And I always order the thick noodles with their scrumptious waviness; if you want these type of noodles, make sure you specify when you place your order.  As usual, I prefer to sit at the bar if available, but probably not feasible if you're with more than two other people.  
If you don't want ramen, there are salads, small plates, mini tacos, and rice bowls available.  The comfort food I crave especially when winter hits, come here to get some noodles and have a slurping good time.",7Oe6ikklTjVBbEFw9emLcA,8,9,4,a3fn8_zQhjC71_UWx2UWRw

5628929,2016-07-26,2,gx2yPrOJSwF1ApJYdGBWIw,"Oh jinya how I love thee, let me count the ways...

1- tasty ramen
2- takoyaki
3- perfect nitamago 
4- ikezo peach wine
5- the best bathroom in ever
6- garlic garlic garlic

I could go on and on..... Before I start I have to mention the bathroom. It literally was the reason I ever decided to come here for the first time ever. And is the highlight of each and every visit. You think I'm joking?? Just come here and pay a visit to the loo. You'll get it. First thing you'll notice is how dim and zen like it is. Then as you approach toilet, the lid slowly lifts and the blue lights come on as if to say ""welcome"". Then some type of mist comes on and toilet is rinsing itself for a couple of seconds. When you sit down, every bit of stress and tension leaves you all because the seat is WARM.  Oh man oh man... The rest you can figure out for yourself, just know the bidet is customizable for front and back, fast or slow....

Ok now for the food, Let me start by mentioning the tonkatsu broth. The broth here is outstanding, it's complex with a depth of flavor that can only be gotten from a loooong time cooking. It was rich and soothing and not overly salty. 

I ordered the tonkatsu black (ramen with black garlic oil) and added a few cloves of freshly pressed garlic. Wow. Just wow. The fresh garlic subtly changed the fragrance and taste of my ramen in a sublime way. It wasn't overpowering but definitely pronounced. In my bowl I asked for an extra egg as they are perfectly done and taste fabulous. Spicy bean sprouts and extra mushrooms went in there too. The noodles are perfectly cooked leaving just the right amount of chew and texture. 

The takoyaki was perfectly executed, cooked crisp, light and fluffy with the perfect amount of octopus in each ball. They serve it on an egg salad bed (which seemed strange at first but it totally went together and seemed to even bring out the wonderful flavor of the balls) and garnished with green onion and bonito strands. 

The ikezo drink was interesting- it was like a peach sparkling wine which turned jelly like after it was poured in the glass. Very different at first but it was a fun drink. I wish there were other favors though....

Service can be iffy here. Sometimes you get someone super attentive and aware while other times you get someone disconnected unaware and oblivious to customers needs.  

I knew immediately during my last visit that the place had a new manager- longer hours, the music was louder, vibe was different, workers were different and they were at capacity when I came for a late lunch. This was confirmed by an employee after I asked. I'm glad they're busier now than before but I'm not sure if I enjoy the new loud music hipster kind of vibe. It was laid back and zen mode before, very relaxing and enjoyable. Not so much now. And it was uncomfortably hot in there. Like made me dizzy while eating hot ramen type of hot. Uncomfortable and not enjoyable. 

Turn up the a/c and everything else can be ignored while I enjoy the fabulous ramen and later have my moment in the bathroom.

5629957,2014-12-20,1,gx2yPrOJSwF1ApJYdGBWIw,"Hubby, brother and I hit up Jinya on our latest trip to Vegas.  We got there a few minutes before opening so were seated promptly when they finally opened for business.

The menu and taste was reminiscent of Ippudo (of NY and Japan fame).  They had the pork belly bun which was actually pretty tasty.  We also ordered the tempura Brussels sprouts that was highly recommended - those didn't disappoint.

And since I'm a sucker for fresh tofu, we ordered the homemade tofu, done tableside.  What a gimmick.  But ya know...? The tofu was actually really great!  If you let it sit, it becomes silky, like the Chinese sweet tofu custard dessert.  They give you a sauce and the usual ginger, green onion and added a touch of yuzu kosho (which I love).  They also instruct you to stir it up which I wasn't a huge fan of doing but in the end, it turned out fine.  You were just eating like a porridge made with tofu.

In terms of noodles, brother and I ordered the tonkotsu black.  He added corn.  I got it ""as is"".  When our orders came, mine had a small dollop of spicy in the middle and corn while his was missing the egg that comes with the tonkotsu black.  We had to show him a picture of our noodles (we're food picture takers) but he still looked at my egg suspiciously, as if we were trying to steal an extra egg.

The taste was ok...it didn't blow me away....it just didn't have the richness of Month's broth or the complexity that other places had.  The noodles were nice and hard and the eggs were just on the verge on being overcooked (still miles better than those places that give up and cook it all the way.).  

Hubby ordered the tonkotsu assari which, was promised, was lighter.  I think he regretted that choice.  

My combo chasu bowl was a little underflavored and dry.  Not enough sauce in the rice to season it.  The combo chicken karaage was good though they serve it to you in giant pieces.

Definitely not a bad option if you want to go through the drive through or if you don't want to wait it out at Monta.  But not our first choice for ramen in Vegas.",ENgL9AxV7uu-v5EUCpF69Q,2,1,3,prpYswu2q1By_GiZSMdFYA

SERVICE 
The service has always been good here. This is probably the one thing that hasn't changed.

FOOD
Tonkatsu Assari: This is one of their specials and also my usual order. Since they've opened til now, I have noticed a change in the broth. About a month or so ago I noticed that the broth has looked and tasted more like MSG. My boyfriend and I liked Jinya because the broth was lighter than Monta's. A second note is that the broth also has changed in taste. I ate here last night and my broth, as well as my friend's tasted insanely sweet. Some of my noodles were also clumped together on the side and they were a little uncooked compared to the rest of my noodles. I don't know if there is a new cook or not but the ramen I crave for at Jinya just leaves me wishing I chose another place instead.

Takoyaki: Still tastes the same, but they became smaller.

Another thing that I liked about Jinya is that they are open til late. Recently however they start to run out of half of their menu items by around 9-10pm. One night I came and they were completely out of pork broth. Last night they were out of half of their ramen. I just find it strange how this use to never happen before.

* The Jinya Bun tasted good, but it tasted like any other siopao. For $3, I guess that would be reasonable for any bun. We ordered the spicy chicken ramen and the original chicken ramen. The noodles had a different kind of texture that aren't typical for noodles. It reminded me of potato noodles, which are really good. The ramen itself, filled enough for one person, which is enough for us because we ordered 2.

I finally found a ramen place here I LOVE. 

Came at about 2pm on a Monday which is obv not a busy time but that works out for us. Got a table right away. Small and intimate with a community table in the middle. 

Good selection of ramen and appetizers as well as a small plates. And a little happy hour. 

Service was good and easy. I ordered the spicy chicken ramen with thin noodles. Added a bunch of extras like mushrooms, corn, nori, and fried onions. All $1 but totally worth it because the soup was filled with the extras I ordered. I even planned to order the extra noodles toward the end for $1.60 but I was full. The portions are big and he broth was so flavorful. I had left over for the next day. 

The price came to about 20.00 each for our ramens with the extras which is a little pricey but honestly worth it to me because it was a delicious meal.",xrvyW1ruKS0uz9RtFewC0Q,3,5,4,ADErDBIRYg9fJIcxJAU6ZQ

I popped a squat and heard a chorus of angels as the toasty sensation enveloped my buns.   

Went on Saturday 4-23-16 at 12PM for lunch.  $35.37 got us two bowls of ramen, a salad, two drinks, and a brussel sprout appetizer. 

I got the tonkotsu assari ramen for $8.80 and added corn for an additional dollar.  The broth was perfect and I love the tiny bit of spice they put on the top.  I wish there was one more piece of chasu because the piece that was in there was wonderful.  My only issue (and this may be a personal preference) was that the egg was refrigerator-cold on the inside.  When the tamago is hot on the outside and cold on the inside it is so gross to me.  

The baby leaf salad was a steal for $3.80 and covered in the most delicious garlicky dressing.  The fried brussel sprouts were wonderful, too! I was able to snag a wonton from my dining partner's ramen and it was marvelous.

First of all, service was great - super friendly, super cute, no complaints. That being said, the food left much to be desired. I love raw salmon, but the salmon tacos were pretty basic and overall bland. It lacked a depth of flavor and was simply uninteresting and forgettable.

I sat at the end of the bar where there was a constant chill from either the hallway or front door, which I didn't mind because I was expecting a piping hot bowl of ramen. However, when I received the recommended ""Cha cha cha"" the broth was only lukewarm, the center of my egg was still cold, and although I appreciated the thicker cuts of chashu, the meat was also lacking in temperature to the point that the fat was still almost solid. I also had to dig through a mountain of bean sprouts just to get to my noodles - overkill. I may be nit picking on the sprouts, but after everything else... just saying. 

The restaurant was far from full capacity at the time and still had a few hours left before closing time, so quality control should not have been an issue. I have NEVER left half a bowl of ramen uneaten before. Starting to think that the lines out the door are because this place is trendy and open late, and not because of the food.

With that being said, chains aren't always the way to go. The consistency and quality of the Ramen broth was not there. 
First off, right when we walked in, there wasn't a wait which is definitely a plus. The restaurant only had a few tables of patrons. So we were quickly seated in the corner. I noticed the table was sticky and flagged down a server to ask for napkins to wipe it down. The waitress looked at me annoyed as if I made up the story to make her like more difficult. She probably deals with tourist all the time. So I was a little empathetic. But For a half empty restaurant, customer service should be king!
When she came back to take our orders she didn't even remove the dirty napkins off the table. But that's okay. I just placed it out sight in the corner. 
Now to the food. I ordered the pork ramen and added some extra goodies. The food came out fairly quickly. But when I tasted my broth, it had a sour taste to it. But since the waitress already had an attitude, I decided to just add some gyoza and ponzu sauce to mask the taste. It did help with the broth. Needless to say, hours later, my stomach did not agree. 
My whole experience was just not satisfactory. From the dirty table, to the unnecessary attitude, and the broth itself, I won't be returning to the Vegas location any time soon.",d6M5tYYH-mPyZGhxZfyV0Q,3,2,3,RDXDwMp-l8CAE_pGQ1lc6A

Let's start off with the decor and the environment. The lighting is dim, which I didn't mind. The tables and chairs kind of bring me back to old Japan town or something. There's booth amongst the side and a HUGE table in the center - perfect for big parties

If you've ever ate at Monta Ramen then you'll notice the menu being very similar. I was recommended the spicy chicken ramen (mild) with added butter and tofu. I can handle my fair share of spiciness, but I wasn't sure how it would be here. If you rather be safe than sorry - go ahead and order a mild. They have their spicy powder available on the table for you to add to your heart's desire. The ramen was served in a huge bowl so it appeared to have larger portions than Monta Ramen (although I can't verify that). The dish was flavorful and delicious. Our friends ordered the Jinya bun that resembles a siapo (meaty, steamed bun) and creamy shrimp tempura (awesomeness on a small appetizer plate).

Now, the only reason why I rated it 4 stars was due to the fact that my side of tofu came pretty late =( The temperature heat of my noodles subsided a lot by the time I was delivered them.

Overall, I look forward to returning here. It definitely will change your view and taste palate for noodles. You'll never want to cook a packet of instant noodles ever again.",VhkjxxBz-A4M-mMncpn1ZA,1,0,4,Vc2ns-5mo7VLeI0H5CSm1w

I've wanted to stop in this great upcoming-chain ramen joint after seeing Mike W's photos of the place.  Since it had been a windy and cold November Vegas trip, some ramen sounded perfect.  I ordered a JINYA Tonkotsu Black [$10.80 - pork broth with chashu, kikurage, green onions, dried nori seaweed, seasoned egg, garlic chips, garlic oil, fried onion, and served with thin noodles] and a JINYA Pork Bun [$3.80/ea. - thick braised pork with vegetables wrapped in a fluffy, white, steamed bun].  The table also shared JINYA No.2 Pig Ear Chicharron [$8.50 - harissa sauce, crispy kale, and a softly onsen tamago] and an order of Takoyaki [$5.20 for six].  Here's a breakdown:

JINYA Tonkotsu Black:  Delicious!  I love Japanese chashu, which is more like a roulade than the Chinese style, and kikurage [wood ear mushroom] is always fun to eat.  I regret forgetting to ask for some freshly pressed garlic but it was still delicious.  I also asked for a pat of butter for my ramen and it made the broth super rich.  Kotteri!  It had great porky flavoring to begin but I have a weakness for adding butter to my ramen.  I ended up getting full halfway into my bowl.  It had good flavor and wasn't too salty.  The egg was also beautiful softly boiled with a creamy egg yolk.  The noodles were good but I'll admit that I was staring at Nadine's thick noodles with envy.  The thin noodles were good but I want the chewy and springiness of the thick ramen noodles.

JINYA Pork Bun:  This could be dangerous.  Great flavor, good size, and a thick cut of pork belly is nestled in between some leafy greens with a generous drizzle of Kewpie mayo.

JINYA No.2 Pig Ear Chicharron:  Technically Nadine C. of YelpHI ordered this but found it too spicy for her liking.  I wasn't sure what the onsen tamago was for so I used it to dunk my fried pig ears in it.  It helped dilute the spicy hot sauce.  Not bad but I don't know if I would recommend it.

Takoyaki:  When is takoyaki ever a bad thing?  Delicious octopus balls served with some bonito flakes.  They were thick, juicy, and plump.  It even sat on a bed of this hard boiled egg custard type sauce.  Not traditional but it escalated the creaminess of the takoyaki.  I even went back after we were done eating all the takoyaki to scoop up any leftover egg on the plate with some bonito flakes.  I would definitely recommend this.

One of the best Ramen places in town. A trendy-chique restaurant right on flamingo and decatur. Right away, if you come in during peak hours, you will see a line outside the door, this usually means that this place is really good--and you're right. Right when i walked in, i noticed the big round wooden picnic table that seats probably 10-15 people. They also have a bar and booth seating. 
I had a the spicy tonkotsu ramen with cilantro and the seasoned egg, it did not disappoint. The broth is full of flavor and it's what keeps me coming back. You can make every meal into a combo which gives you the option of a salad + gyoza/chicken/etc.
The only reason I'm giving this place a 4 star instead of a 5 is due to the inconsistency of the service. I've been here multiple times where the server was talkative, observant, and helpful.

When you eat it, it goes down so smooth and you don't feel humongous after you eat a bowl. You simply feel satisfied.

Get the combos for more for your buck! Awesome prices. Chasu bowls are really good. The Jinya bun is suuuuper yummy I could eat those all day.

The atmosphere is awesome. Nice setting. Loud music. When you walk in they immediately greet you hello. When you walk out they immediately greet you goodbye.

Jinya has been a solid staple in my Las Vegas ramen eating career. They are in a good location and away from the strip and easily accessible. They are also open late until 3am which is also super clutch. 
The food here is also super bomb! My personal favorite is the Tonkatsu white or the spicy. The broth is super well spiced and incredibly filling. They also have a pretty good happy hour and appetizers. Cheap bear and squid balls for the win!
They also have a vegan ramen that I have never tried but all my vegan friends sing its praises.  The fact that they have a Vegan option is a good sign In my books since I have quite a good amount of Vegan friends. They also have a drive thru that I've never used because I'm not a fan of on the go ramen. 

The only downside is that this place is a little small and depending on when you go the lines can get crazy long. Also the women's bathroom is super awesomely decorated, but as of my last visit the men's was just a normal one.

None of us decided on where to go for lunch, so we all settled on Jinya, which was conveniently located next door (not even a 5 minute walk.) We all walk in and the place is extremely lively. Delicious aromas all around and s someone who worked in the food service nearly her entire life, I usually look for flaws in eating establishments. Couldn't find one. We all sit down and only one orders an appetizer, which was Edamame. Now I'm a cultured little lady, so I usually don't branch out from my comfort zone, but since it was offered to the rest of us to share, I decided to try one.

It was pretty good. Interesting at most.  I soon found myself unconsciously nibbling at them one by one until our food came out. I had the basic chicken ramen with nothing special added. The only other time I EVER has ramen (that wasn't in cup form) was in LA at a place called Mr. Ramen. Jinya FAR surpassed that of MR. The broth has a good, heavy feel to it and not much of a watery, soupy context. It was so delicious that I was the first one to finish eating and ended up becoming actually upset that I didn't have enough money to order another bowl. This place really ended up etching a place on my heart, so the next day, I ended up eating from there again.

The next time, I had their Tokyo Rice Curry and if you like to eat like me, their lunch size, I promise is MORE than enough. I expected one tiny little bowl for $7, but you get that and SO MUCH MORE. It was delicious like nobody's business. Needless to say, I ended up taking home leftovers.

Overall, if you're a pasta lover like me and also happen to like the Japanese cuisine, Jinya is the place to go. It's not the biggest restaurant, but for its size, it was cozy, warm and their waitstaff was very friendly.

However, the service I received makes me want to rate this place -1 stars. My party and I were served by 2 servers on 1/29/18 by Alex, and a waitress with pink hair. Let me tell you that I have never received such horrible service anywhere. When Alex stopped by our table he just threw the drink menu at us, and didn't wait to take the drink order. He came by twenty minutes to take our food order, when he did, I handed him my menu and he didn't reach to grab it so it fell. I was going to grab it for him, but it was right at his feet and I couldn't reach. He acknowledged that I dropped the menu, but instead of grabbing it he left it there. That was the last time we saw him stop by the table, until later when we asked someone for his name. Our food was delivered by someone else, and then the pink-haired waitress came by to try and give us our check. One person in our party was not done eating, and we wanted to order dessert. So she loudly crumpled the check and took the order. The dessert didn't come, and the pink-haired waitress came by with the check again. When I told her the dessert was not there she said ""oh, no one brought it to you?"", she did not care to apologize. It was at that moment that my party and i decided to ask for the waiter's name that initially served us. 

Basically, we never got refills, no one ever stopped by our table, they were trying to rush us out of the restaurant the entire time. The atmosphere of this place is 'get out, we need you to leave'. No one is attentive, and the place lacks organization. The food is great, but the service is enough to never go to this restaurant again. 

The seating host was kind, however. That's a plus for the service team.",27ne07J54Jx1lg8KJora4g,6,2,1,QqrvHZ473JfJT7x7N1FvpA
5947373,2016-09-06,3,gx2yPrOJSwF1ApJYdGBWIw,"Yaassssss! I finally found another decent ramen place to add to my list in Vegas. Thanks to my friend's recommendation, I was able to finally check out JINYA. 

This place was ridiculously delicious, but a little pricey for Vegas prices. For a party of two with one appetizer, we spent about $37 bucks with tip and tax. Who would have thought that sin city had some good ramen places, huh? JINYA would be in the top 3 ramen places in Vegas. The place was also well-decorated too and had a nice hipster vibe to mesh with the overall atmosphere. 

JINYA was generous with portions and offered a huge variety of topping options. I ordered the JINYA Tonkotsu Black with thick noodles. I enjoyed the noodles as they were perfectly cooked and chewy. The broth was decent, but unfortunately, the flavor wasn't as delicious as Monta's Black Tonkotsu version. It wasn't bad, don't get me wrong. As far as flavoring and taste goes, it's a solid 3.5-4/5. The noodles, meat and seasoned egg were a solid 5/5.

We also ordered the fried Shrimp Balls, which I highly recommend! It had just the right amount of crunch, shrimp and cream cheese that made it beyond orgasmic.

Overall, this place is a solid choice to dine for a quick bite. We went on Monday around 5 and were seated quickly. If I had to wait in line for this place, I probably wouldn't wait more than 20 minutes. The service was attentive and friendly, especially when we told them it was our first time at the restaurant! Our waters were always constantly refilled and they routinely checked up on us to see how things were going.",VFr6lODPXmakSm4BFebKww,6,7,4,ULXbJJ5vvltBsUtS9Xdpuw

The restaurant is cute and modern. They recently started serving lunch during the weekend, so my fella and I decided to stop by. 

We shared a crispy rice with tuna as an appetizer and I opted for the spicy tonkotsu and my fella ordered the spicy chicken ramen.

I wouldn't recommend the crispy rice appetizer. The texture and taste were completely off. The ramen was tasty. Not the best I've ever had, but decent. The spice levels were good and not overly salty like others I've had. 

The noise level was a little high in the restaurant. I like having music accompanying my meals, but it was overwhelming and hard to hear.

5969528,2017-10-12,0,gx2yPrOJSwF1ApJYdGBWIw,"The soup is extremely good but they're very stingy when it comes to sides like when I added an additional boy choy to my ramen for $1.50, I only got two scrawny leaves of bok choy. If you're running short on time, I wouldn't recommend this place because chances of them making a mistake in your order is 99%. I have visited this establishment several times, all ending with some kind of mistake in my order. I honestly would not come here if it wasn't for my mother. This visit was much faster in receiving the order but in many of my other visits it took over an hour or more just to order and get the food delivered to the table. On the bright side, they have a variety of different toppings compared to other ramen restaurants. On the down side, the toppings are $1 to $2 or more just for two pieces. Making your noodles spicy even costs $1 which is a bit ridiculous to just add a dab of sriracha.

The menu has various ramen options that are separated by tonkotsu, chicken, and vegetable. Apparently their JINYA bun is popular, but we just were too full. They also have some interesting items such as mini tacos and BlockPops. 
+SPROUTING UP RAMEN: This may not be the most traditional ramen, but I absolutely loved the brussel sprouts in here; they added some crunch. The broth is also rich and creamy and overall a wholesome ramen bowl.

All in all, the ramen shop offers some delicious albeit possibly non-traditional ramen. I would love to return to try some of their other non-ramen offerings because they also sound tasty.",bI6K69Ib14ocvdMWvV1UBg,0,0,4,XkgrC7IRefnP4DqP5LcX4Q

That being said, a year ago Jinya was my go to spot for ramen, but the quality of food seemed to decline as the months went on. It's either that or maybe things just weren't consistent, which is a no go for me. So, I started to go elsewhere. Fast forward to last week in which an impromptu lunch date landed me here, and let's just say everything is back to being perfect!! 

The noodles in my spicy chicken ramen were cooked perfectly, not too overdone that is (I can't stand soggy noodles); the shrimp balls were golden & crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside; and although they were out of jinya buns, the karaage chicken being fried to perfection definitely made up for it. Customer service had also improved and everything came quickly and correctly. 

It's safe to say Jinya is back to being my favorite!! Although I wish they'd  bring back the tofu dessert, it's definitely not a deal breaker.",CQm1OAqGQJvtE-B4jQRz0Q,3,1,5,I2EfLZO7TknzCNqPQcLdHA
