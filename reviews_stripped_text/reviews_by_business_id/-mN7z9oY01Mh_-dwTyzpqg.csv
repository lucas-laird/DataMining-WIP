Since it was only 8:30 in the morning on a tuesday I thought breakfast was calling out to me. People do say its the most important meal of the day. I guess my package can wait. Priorities right? Bacon usually takes it over almost anything.

So I go in and am shocked to discover the place was packed. I guess people do eat breakfast eh? Anyways, as I took a quick glance on their menu, I noticed the only thing that had bacon in it was the Spinach, Egg, and Bacon Panini. So, that's my order. It cost me about 6 bucks and some change. I was thinking wow, that is a bit pricey for a panini.

Waited about 10 minutes. When I got it, the sandwich was about the size of an Earl's sandwich, about 6 inches. Basically it was two small sandwiches put together. You had scramble eggs mixed with spinach and some bacon. It was ok but for the price and portion size, not worth it. Maybe I should of stuck to bagels. LOL.

In closing, I think next time I will just get a bagel or two and put some shmear on it. Weird name for their spreads but oh well, its pretty good.

I like how the workers will bring you your order directly if they see you getting up or remember you.

Several years ago, a co-worker and I were in a hurry to get several bagels for a breakfast presentation that had been forgotten.  In our haste, both of us stressed to the people behind the counter the importance of making sure each bagel was cut before they were put in the tray and we were, subsequently, told by two people that it would be done.  When we returned to the office, we discovered that none of them had been cut and we only had a few moments to hand cut two dozen bagels.

This morning, my same co-worker and I stopped off for breakfast on the go.  We each ordered a toasted bagel with cream cheese and she ordered a blended coffee drink.  She received her blended coffee drink first and threw it away after one drink.  Apparently it tasted like ""drinking espresso beans and that's all.""  After the drink came and went, we stood and watched as the woman that had ordered after us received her prepared bagel sandwich.  The couple that ordered after her received their breakfast order.  And the couple that ordered after them received their bag of half a dozen bagels all sliced.  Let me reiterate that we ordered ONLY two toasted bagels with spread.

Einstein Bros Bagels as a company is great! I never have a bad bagel or experience. 

Bagel:
I chose to try the $3.99 special- which includes a medium coffee and bagel w/ cream cheese.  During my last visit, I opted for a pretzel bagel with a shmear of veggie cream cheese, and it was HEAVENLY!  If there is one thing I love about running- it's the guilt free bagels I get to  gobble down. Mmm Mmm- Sorry Paleo fans .. more bagels for me!

Coffee:
As for their Coffee drinks ...they give Starbucks a run for their money- at least when it comes to price. For their non straight coffee drinks you get a punch card and every 5 or so drinks is free. That's really great deal. My favorite is their Vanilla Hazelnut coffee.

Service: 
Service here was fast and the staff was friendly and feverishly working on cranking out order after order since the place was hopping. Can't ask for much more.",3Qv2rjPXC2eNKyV5lh3J_g,0,0,4,s4SOn3mBx4pmq_9GC866JA

While I was there, it was sad to see another customer had their order given to someone else and then she had to wait for her order to be done again but without what she wanted because they gave away the last bagel she specifically ordered. Overall, I have to agree with the reviews here. Einstein, fire your management  and reevaluate all of your employees. This is a good chain but this specific place blows.

Hubby has also visited, during the week, for just the bagels as there was a special with the bakers dozen (13) on mondays recently. If you have the coupons from the weekly circulars (BOGO, or a baker's dozen with schmears- the veggie schmear is delish!), it's also another incentive to come here. Don't forget to enter your telephone number to get additional member deals. 

There are so many different bagels- cheese, everything, sesame, pretzel, cranberry, potato, whole grain, etc., to choose from, although the gourmet bagels are not included with the specials. If there is something that you like that is very popular, there is a chance that it will be gone, unless you get there early. 

The breakfast sandwiches (select from one egg or two egg) are so yummy (I think that the farmhouse- cage free eggs, thick-cut bacon, smoked ham, cheddar cheese, w/ country pepper schmear, is our favorite, on a hash brown bagel). Hubby remembers, years ago, when there were only a couple of selections for breakfast, but now the menu is pretty big- 13 choices.  

There are sample cups for their coffee, located along the left side of the restaurant. The counter is the very back end of the restaurant (pay at the end of the counter).

The staff is nice and the dinning room is usually clean, service is good but the men's room is often not clean...not horrible but not clean. The last time I was there early Sunday the restroom was absolutely disgusting. No paper towels, filthy dirty top to bottom which means no one cleaned it the night before nor checked it at all.  I've been in gas station restrooms that were great better.  It also means the employees are using the same restroom and not taking care of anything,  Probably not washing their hands... Doesn't seem like this is a location I want to continue to visit if it's going to be dirty like that.",UHMSpGrIVfO8z0UiyS6oYg,0,0,2,mKc64puAomWXEmijMv_ZDg

Since I moved out west, I have been on the never ending search for a bagel that comes close to those crisp outside, soft inside treats you find in NJ and NYC.  At one point I would drive once a month to pasadena from San Diego to buy bagels that were almost as good but that place closed.  

Einstein Bros is not the answer.  Their bagels wouldn't last a minute on any corner in my hometown.  That said, they are a tasty substitute until I find something better.  Their bagels are a bit smaller than I would like and I think they sacrifice quality in order to put out so many varieties.  They pacakge their bagels and schmears well and their lox cream cheese is good.  So far, it is the only place I can get a decent bagel and lox although I am certain someone will recommend another.

The make good breakfast sandwiches and have a nice variety of drinks.  I love the bagel holes they sell.  This location is always busy and clean and the staff is always friendly.",wnO99pBbGqwqOoTQM25iCw,2,1,3,vEKww2_9rKtXuSDKDQdH_A

When I agreed to have it ""warmed up"", I did not expect it to sit for 5 minutes on high in the microwave. The frosting was  a puddle in the bag that could barely be touched, and the rest of the muffin so hot that it could not be eaten. 

I was also very disappointed in the breakfast sandwiches I ordered. They were flat, with few ingredients, and though I know it may not look like their glamorous pictures, are not like they were before.",SgcNTpx_ASfvyQHmLU443A,0,0,1,jSIQjwwwEcH0jyOV0R6SEQ

And they screwed up in my order in a truly bizarre way giving what can only be described as a garlic-sesame bagel, instead of a garlic bagel.  What makes that weird is that (1) I've never seen a garlic-sesame bagel in my life and (2) they don't even have garlic-sesame bagels on the menu.  It's as if the guy making the garlic bagels accidentally dropped them in the sesame seeds and didn't look back.  

I drove 4 miles to get here today, since I've liked this store in the past, but would not do so again.",fqCxaOI1cvnXx1OlHRUDPg,1,0,2,GNIg92U44nsVTthMAHQteQ
