655137,2018-01-17,0,AfL8Ds7ex73tfVbq3EFWKg,"Really glad they have reopened.  Food is always fresh and simple.  I usually get a Ultimo burrito but like the Baja ensalada too.  They include a small amount of chips that is just the right size for me.  The staff size is at least doubled so there are short if any wait times.  I hope the new owners keep going in this direction. I like having the TVs on since I eat alone fairly often so I wish they would keep them on and keep sports or news or TMZ or the like.  
I also tried the churros which were fresh and warm and not too sweet, very good!  Prices are very reasonable.  My burrito is a meal.",ztSBlinmPXl9a7z5NGBzaQ,1,1,5,t09KAraOtE3Fw9V9Y8az5w

1141777,2018-02-06,0,AfL8Ds7ex73tfVbq3EFWKg,I was bummed when I first moved to Vegas and this place had just closed.  I was excited when it reopened and I've been twice now.  The new management is marvelous.  How do I know this?  The employees are happy and working well together.  They seem to like their jobs and want to make the customers satisfied.  The food was as great as I've always gotten from any Baja Fresh.  There were no long lines either time I went and the wait for my food was not very long.  I definitely recommend this place.,4SJfAWyrXCOF-ugDxs5X5Q,0,0,5,bVr2Rwy5DQB2E-V76O_DGg
1226728,2018-01-13,0,AfL8Ds7ex73tfVbq3EFWKg,I was so sad when you closed last year. I was driving up to Boca Park today and I saw the lights on and you were open again  you don't know how happy I am. Your fish and shrimp tacos are to die for.,tP7iWkIA8-Y7C763JLyaPg,1,1,5,hMCUUpu6-sxQkRs2f9jL-A
1359701,2018-02-28,0,AfL8Ds7ex73tfVbq3EFWKg,This was the best burrito I've had. Apparently they can give you fresh tomatoes and onions if you don't like the pico de gallo.  No one has ever told me this till now.  I'm allergic to cilantro and I told the woman this.. so she asked if I wanted the tomatoes and onion freshly chopped?  Hell yeah!  I hope all locations do this. They weren't stingy with the onions. I love onions! I always get the same thing.. veggie burrito extra black beans and no pico. On a plate. Enchilada style. :) This one was perfect. The restaurant was clean. In a good location. The staff was very nice. I wish it had gone to this location before I moved away from Vegas. I'll be back when I'm in town.,5Bs1BZcD6_wo_sUiAGe7FA,1,0,5,fYPSyeZBZ4AYk23ma7JMyA

2690574,2018-02-26,0,AfL8Ds7ex73tfVbq3EFWKg,"OMG if I could give this place negative stars I would. I work close to Boca park and wanted to try something I hadn't had in a while for lunch. I was so happy for this meal and it changed quickly lol. Let's just say I WILL NEVER GO TO THIS LOCATION AGAIN !!! I placed my order over the phone for myself and 2 other coworkers. I asked for no guacamole on one order due to my coworker being allergic to tomatoes. Never once did I hear "" there are no tomatoes in the guacamole "" ... I get there and I inform the manager (TERESA SANDOVAL WHO LIED AND TOLD ME HER LAST NAME WAS SOMETHING ELSE LOL NOT KNOWING ITS PRINTED ON MY RECEIPT ) that we were paying separately... It slipped my mind when I made the order to specify that so I didn't think it would be a big deal to correct this. She told me that she was unable to split the order and we had to pay for it in full with either cash or one card. I told her I was sorry but I needed it separate... she then went on to explain the voiding process and how she could not do it. I just stood there and finally after her huffing and puffing and eye rolling she voided the order and rang us separately.... once she showed me the order for my co worker who was allergic to tomatoes all I saw was a ton of tomatoes right on top. I asked her if she could remove that because I called stating I wanted no gauc due to the allergy, she then at that point raised her voice to tell me that gauc doesn't have tomatoes... at this point I was completely over this visit. I told her That's fine about the gauc not having tomatoes but I just wanted the tomatoes removed. TERESA SANDOVAL then took the tray because this was a tostada and threw it on the rack where the chef was, I asked her if throwing my food that way was necessary and she said yes ! Lol I was so appalled! I will never in life eat at this place again !!!!!!!!! NEGATIVE STARSSSSS !!!!!!! Also by the time my coworker got to eat this tostada the shell tasted like old old grease.",Xs8O24gGVqHWEqaok-x2yw,0,0,1,U0OoLdvu-KjPIqdbB2CS8A

They walk around he dinning area and make sure everything tastes good, offer to get you anything you need, and have a friendly smile.

3171991,2018-03-05,3,AfL8Ds7ex73tfVbq3EFWKg,"I used to go here when short of time for lunch, but this last visit has really put me off. And it's all about the food. The salsa's tasted musty and dishwatery. And my companion had the same issue, so I wasn't just 'off' on my taste buds. And the crispy fish tacos, the size of a small fish stick, had this weird sweetness to the sauce that was off-putting. 

I felt like the computer that spits out the food to be the exact size, taste, and consistency went bonkers. It was all too sweet and too sharp. And the mango salsa resembled, and worse, tasted, like fruit cocktail. I think they had a microscopic bit of mango, but it was drowned out by the chunks of everything else. But the worst bite of all, was how soggy the peppers and onions were. They were overly salty limp noodles of yuckiness.

I didn't appreciate how true it was that the food tasted like the dishrag used to clean the tables smelled. And I'm usually a generous guy with cookie-cutter places like this, since I anticipate they are just a step above taco bell, but below, well, just about any authentic Mexican food place. But this place was sub-par today enough to make me want to write and inform others. 

And no, a teensy tray of generic chips doesn't make up for it.",1e-YlTcTpYKkCu6d_7kSJQ,5,1,2,41n1Zg_B3zN83ceAG8zTZA
4000533,2017-12-06,1,AfL8Ds7ex73tfVbq3EFWKg,"The Best / cleanest Salsa Bar Everrr!!!
When it comes to Mexican Food, you gotta have Great Salsa or it ain't no fun 
What else you need!!! Bottomless Salsa every time 
They got around 8 different varieties of Freshly made Salsa from scratch all day long , I am just fan of this place 
As everything is so Fresh , clean , colorful...
Try the Veggie Burrito or the Veggie tacos but get them made Quesadilla style, ask them to flash some corn on top and your set to go with some fresh lime and salsa.
Endless CHIPS AND SALSA .... Chips and Salsa ... Chips and Salsa... 
The Service is Awesome at this location, every time they are amazing in customer service , I think it's a new location or management but it's definitely 
Not like Chipotle with their boring same items every time and sad looking Salsa...which they are stingy about.",x5JracvQDi-OnG2JlBXIbA,1,1,5,hCOAXKkUk62xF4pUTxh9kA
4834165,2017-11-07,0,AfL8Ds7ex73tfVbq3EFWKg,I had this for the first time the other day. I was told that things had recently been redone and under new management. As I've never been there I can only share this one experience. It was really tasty I had fish tacos and guacamole and chips. It was all super tasty and I loved the salsa bar. The staff was all very friendly and accommodating to anything I needed. I'll be back for lunch again soon.,MMcExQ3toqFqCpgT_Ae6JA,1,0,5,As7PUvt8th57Z0V4IVUjeg

5840723,2018-02-14,0,AfL8Ds7ex73tfVbq3EFWKg,"First of all this location seems to be under new ownership/management. I had pretty much given up on Baja Fresh. I was going to this location and the location in Henderson in the past. The standards fell so bad that I was amazed they were staying open. Food was no longer fresh and tasted weird, salsa bar was disgusting, The restaurant was in severe need of maintenance and repairs. I though this location had closed for good but must have closed then reopened? Gave it another try tonight and it's like night and day compared to how it used to be. It now seems to be back to the old Baja that I liked over the years. Hopefully they keep it up. Many locations closed so hopefully maybe they focused to bringing the remaining locations up to par.",BDmxm7aeWFOLT35gSvkmig,1,0,5,cCILDo9o06kVMMjONuTn_g
