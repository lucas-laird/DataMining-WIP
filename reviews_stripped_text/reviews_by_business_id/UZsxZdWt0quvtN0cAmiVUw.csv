The tacos are also very good - check out the ""giro"" tacos (carve asada with grilled onions and guac). My favorite taco might be their birria, which sadly isn't part of their regular menu. But when it's available, I always eat at least three.",v-j_0dRbKBVks9KH_oF_pA,0,0,5,KWs5HuJy4SaDAqCejcxoIw

Always delicious, fresh and so good. The owners are super nice, too and that goes a long way with us. I want to try the carne asada, but the al pastor always calls to me.

1363121,2017-03-28,0,UZsxZdWt0quvtN0cAmiVUw,"A late night taco food truck that just hits it out of the park !!    How could a taco taste so good? It's not just the cooking and ingredients it is the LOVE and PASSION added to the preparation.  
Look, $2.00 for tacos prepared to perfection.  I ordered the chicken tacos ( chose to come off pork for a while , a tough decision ) and whilst enjoying my tacos I spied the Mushroom tacos on the menu. Those sounds good I thought out loud, The next thing I know the lady working the truck came out with a big smile and a freshly prepared mushroom taco on the house  !! .. Dove in with gusto, looking up between bites, caught the chefs eye who was watching my diligently. With all the dignity I could muster whilst mushrooms and taco fillings were overflowing onto my fingers and face I gave a Big thank you and two thumbs up.
 These Guys are sending love into the  world one bite at a time. Here is the kicker, When you visit, and if you are reading this you will very soon,  pay for an extra taco and ask them pay it forward to the next customer. It's fun a way to continue sharing the love this super couple (thinking husband and wife ) are dropping into downtown.",m0WvIKeA_7QRYSnzv4aVAg,1,1,5,f1zvxukRX-ONVZ0TGHsTqA

I have often lamented about the quality of Vegas' Mexican food offerings, and this place offers exactly what I've been craving all these years.  Thank you!  I've been there four times in the last two weeks and can't seem to get enough.  My husband loves the birria takos (not always on the menu), I'm addicted to the al pastor gordita and gyros takos, and the cactus mulita is tastier than you'd expect.  We haven't had anything we don't like yet.",nkYi7K8egVq-PS8zhYaCpA,1,1,5,AocOT9Zh5kkNiau2ThgwCA

And well I experienced:
THE BEST BURRITO I've ever had. My asada burrito had to weigh in at over one pound. But it would still be the best at half the size. The meat was very flavorful and in an appropriate ratio to beans & rice. Ad the green hot salsa and magic happens.",7wZ9OlGq_DcVq1OCOLKqUg,1,1,4,duL_hpU4r6ECZXVkGobr3g

3161341,2018-06-23,0,UZsxZdWt0quvtN0cAmiVUw,"Don't be like my wife and get freaked out by the somewhat sketchy parking lot of the mini-mart where this taco truck resides.  Sure there are often interesting people hanging out in front of the store, but nobody has every bothered me the 4 times I been there, often late at night. My son goes to LVA which is nearby, so its the perfect place to go after his performances or when in the downtown Vegas area.

Their tacos cause such happiness and bliss to happen in my mouth and tummy. I have not yet made it through every taco option offered, but am getting close. My favorites so far are the tongue, cheek, mushroom, and carnitas. Lovely spicy salsas, and frothy tasty horchata. And such nice and friendly owners. If only I lived closer, this would be my regular happy spot, and I would likely be fatter and have the best onion breath!",pcatwypbiYIgS5sYIf6xEQ,0,0,5,5eiexJHB3vjb6TbVqlYQDw

Only because of the quality of the meat... don't get me wrong it's delicious but it's not the best I've ever had.  If I could give 4 1/4 stars, that'd be about right.  Which is very respectable, I must say.",f_A09kjEl0luVgxuuv17yg,0,0,4,apkKyIPejuiKC8OoJStP4g

This is truly the ""street-style"" experience. The food is sooo good (have realistic expectations, people seem to expect everything to be out of this world).

The taco was full of VERY spicy chicharrón complete with a tender interior and crispy edges. The pozole was some of the best I have ever had, multiple layers of complex flavors simmered to perfection. This place is a great addition to the taco trail that has emerged along East Charleston.",TwUqavuMpDWCw9iCva3KXA,1,1,5,qiyafK_63LbbsAcXx-Wu1Q
