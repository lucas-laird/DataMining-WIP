French fries - not your usual fries. Not greasy and they have some sort of Parmesan garlic seasoning. So addicting!

We came in here and ordered wings, pizza, bulgogi and fries. 

The pizza was the most disgusting pizza I've EVER had. Not exaggerating. I took it back to my hotel thinking maybe I'd like it after I got drunk. Nahp :(, first time I threw away a whole pizza between 4 ppl. 

Wings were overwhelming, too much sauce that tasted like it was straight up out the bottle. It tasted like Chinese fast food orange chicken. 

Fries were bomb! It tasted really fresh, seasoned perfectly, with the perfect crunch. 

An hour into eating we check up on the bulgogi, turns out our waiter never put it in. We had to cancel since they were closing up, but they gave us 4 free sodas. I thought that was a very nice gesture.

Kimchi fried rice (8$)
Bulgogi pizza (14$)

The decor was clean and well done. They have a large tv playing K-pop in the background - maybe 2 tv's, if I'm remembering correctly.",sDlRFzGHzfpFHaxvJ1JtTg,0,0,4,DA153cHVY3lF9K1Rs0VajQ

2010540,2015-07-29,5,XsSgv3vBOyOBXn3Co8EVIg,"This plaza always has pretty good eats, but I'm rarely in the mood for Korean. Q gets away from the typical BBQ menu, instead offering various takes on fried chicken (wings, drums, and popcorn style), along with some traditional soups, noodle and rice dishes, and of course, the banchan.

DOLSOT BIBIMBAP: Huge portion, definitely a comfort-food dish. The mix was extremely light on meat, with a bit more veggies, and mostly a ton of rice. Had to ask for sesame oil and sriracha to kick it up from a bland baseline, but the crunchy rice and variety of veggies made it a successful dish for me.
SOY GARLIC WINGS: The wings here are huge, on par with drumsticks elsewhere, and coated in a thick crust topped with a sticky sauce. The flavor seemed to be more of a sweet and sour, or a honey-based sauce, and there were no notes of garlic. Though flavors weren't what we expected, the dish was still good, and we barely put a dent in the order.
LEMON PEPPER POPCORN CHICKEN: Listed separately from the other chicken dishes, this one comes topped with a shredded green onion salad and lemon wedges, with a cold, acidic dipping sauce. This was perhaps my favorite mix of flavors at the table, as I especially enjoy green onion. The salad served to keep this fried dish on the lighter side. I do wish the dipping sauce were heated, as the coldness was a bit of an abrupt interruption to the other ingredients. 

Each dish had some hits and misses about it, but overall it's a place I'd recommend. Heads up that the service uses those little doorbell buttons for each table, which I don't really care for. The décor is an odd mishmash of styles, but I really enjoy the bubble-light chandelier that is the focal point of the dining room. Prices are about on par with $10/meal and portions are more than generous.

Don't forget to use your Yelp check-in offer for a free shaved ice dessert! I'll have to use mine another time, as I was far too full for dessert.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,7,5,3,OISnMODEQYPzyVY9oDkzyQ

I was mistaken, however, as the restaurant is located in a separate space right next door.  I guess this bistro has been open for over a year now but only heard about it recently.  Ambiance was nice except for the blasting EDM that almost gave me a headache... at least all alcohol was BUY ONE GET ONE FREE (only during World Cup) which greatly helped soon as the booze started flowing.

The menu includes both typical and nontraditional Korean dishes.  Dukbokke (soft rice cake, fish cake, and sweet red chili sauce) was really tasty with portion big enough for two to three people.  Korean fried chicken (KFC of South East Asia) was also delicious.  Crust stayed crispy even when it was drenched in sweet and spicy sauce.  It almost reminded me of my first time having it at Bonchon during a trip in the Philippines; however, it's just like comparing apples to pears.  The ones from this restaurant have thicker coating and were glazed with too much sauce.  Nonetheless, the dish itself is great and worth coming back for.

One dope thing they do is their Yelp check-in special: free small patbingsoo.  Not sure if it's only for the first visit or every time you do it.  Considering the dessert was complimentary, we thought it was just going to be shaved ice topped with strawberries and condensed milk.  Surprisingly, it was topped with cereal, sweet red beans, assorted fresh fruits (kiwi, cantaloupe, strawberry, honeydew, banana, mango), vanilla ice cream and drizzled with condensed milk.

I came here for dinner on Saturday and it was pretty empty.

The kimbap was only okay. The pork belly was good and the wings too were saucy for me. I should of got them plain! 

The service on the other hand was very forgetful when it wasn't very busy. They forgot our soju and calamari. 

I also have another complaint that our flavored sojus did not even have barely a splash of alcohol. We didn't even feel drunk after 3 large flavored sojus or even tasted alcohol in them. For $15, you're better off getting the actual soju bottle for cheaper and stronger alcohol.

Stereotypically, Korean restaurants don't get the best rep, but this incident was a bit too unique for me to not post.

Walking in on a Saturday evening, they were busy so we were seated at the center community table. When a party of 4 came in, they had to separate the tables.. which was confusing because I thought it was a community table? They could have just anticipated another table coming in and moved the table before we sat down (just using common sense).

Also, instead of communicating that soups were on a delay and to be wary of ordering it.. it just never came out. The only reason I dine at Korean restaurants is really for soup (why else?), but I rather leave without it than sit there a minute longer for an underwhelming payoff. Reminding the kitchen is one thing, but you have to communicate with the guests promptly. 

For Korean food just go to hobak, hwaro, magal, djk, or e-jo. If you're hanging in the plaza like we were just skip Korean altogether and go to district 1 (oxtail soup), chada (Thai curry), or hachi (Japanese tapas and sashimi).",wu1aog5_q4Xv-1J7v0Jp6A,5,0,2,vPqLpdXCT8xvmMwnIwh62w

Honestly, it hurts me to write this. I've been coming to Q Bistro for like 3 years and I love their food. 
This review is purely on the staff and the customer service, which is normally good. 
My boyfriend and I came in and it was busy, that's fine. They offered us a middle table but it's a huge table and we didn't feel right taking it as it was big enough for 8 people. We said we would wait for a smaller table or a booth.
So we waited for 20 min and one of the waitresses asked us if we wanted a booth or a table. I said preferably I want a booth but if a small table is all they have, that's fine too. 
A party leaves a booth and they started cleaning it. My boyfriend and I started getting ready to get up and move over to the booth, but instead a giant group of people that were ALREADY SEATED were moved into this booth. Like wtf?? We waited 30 min and they already had their food but they move them to a booth??
Another 10 min goes by and a waiter says another booth is being cleaned and it will be ready in 2 min. Cool. We waited AGAIN. 
Finally they come to seat us and we start trying to walk back to the now clean booth, and they said no, we're going to be seated at a small corner table. 
Again, wtf? We asked for a booth if it's available and a small table if it wasn't, and we were already told we were getting the booth. So I said to the same waiter, ""I thought we were getting the booth?"" Only to be completely ignored.

2622918,2016-05-27,0,XsSgv3vBOyOBXn3Co8EVIg,"Having seen the high ratings on this new korean place, I was REALLY excited to try the Q bistro.   Here's the break down:

Service was HORRIBLE.  Basically a few kids more interested in staring at the cash register than doing their jobs. We rang the service bell three times before we got any attention, took at least 5 minutes to order and another 5 minutes to get our beer. 

Food

Wings - crispy outside but soggy inside. Too much garlic in the flavor. 
Seafood pancake: decent, but once it got cold the oil used became more rancorous in taste. 
An-ju. Pretty decent, liked the siracha/mayo dipping sauce, grilled squid nice texture and not overcooked. 
Yuk gae jang - possibly the worst I've ever had in my life. Soup tasted eerily similar to msg-laden Shin ramen instant soup mix - not fresh, and barely any beef in it.  
Rice- for me a barometer of a Korean restaurant (second only to ban Chan of which there was none offered). Was mealy, dry and lacking any redeeming value. 
Beer/wine list probably worst in my recent memory. No craft/draft beers, only korean wines (which is an insult to the word ""wine"" usually), they ran out of asahi so we were stuck with Sapporo and hite. 

If only my korean bretherens owning restaurants in vegas ditched the ""the least I can do to make the most profit"" modus operandi and put some passion and imagination into their trade!!",DAZCCWKucotR0MZhMv7qXw,0,0,2,arExWftMt7hCu_HOGE6LoA

2662784,2015-11-24,52,XsSgv3vBOyOBXn3Co8EVIg,"Q Bistro is at the top of our list of favorite Korean restaurants, on heavy rotation! We love this place! There's a handful of Korean restaurants in Las Vegas, but no one hooks it up like Q bistro. They are owned by Karaoke Q Studio right next door, but don't share the same entrance. 

The food is always very flavorful and the service is always wonderful! There is also a table buzzer (like a doorbell but on the table), which you can press to call their attention whenever you need something. They also bring out a complimentary selection of their delicious rotating banchan (side dishes) and everything is always seasoned perfectly and pairs great with all of the dishes. Some of the banchan items we tried: pickled daikon, kimchi, japchae (clear sweet potato noodles), seasoned potatoes, fish cake, potato salad, mac salad, pickled bean sprouts, etc. All so tasty! They are always happy to refill your side dishes as you request.

Here's what we've tried:

* Soondubu $9 - Q's version offers a generous sized clay pot, filled with soft tofu and a fair amount of protein of your choice. My favorite combination is spicy bulgogi (marinated beef) and add mushroom for $1 more. The broth is bubbling hot, flavorful and extremely satisfying. The spicy level is never too hot for us to enjoy, it's actually perfect for us! (We like spice) Rated: 5/5

* Dol Sot Bibimbap $10 - This is the tastiest version I've tried in Las Vegas! It's traditionally served in a hot stone pot with veggies, bulgogi (marinated beef) and a fried egg. Let it sit a bit before you start mixing it all up, so that the rice has a chance to get crispy! Also, be careful while eating it, the dish stays scalding hot for a while. It's an explosion of flavor and texture! They also provide red spicy sauce on the side so you can kick up the spiciness of the dish if you wish. So delicious! Rated: 5/5

* Korean Fried Chicken (KFC) 10 pieces for $10 - We tried the ""supreme sauce"" which is a delicious balance between sweet, salty and spicy. We love spice, but we didn't think it was too spicy. Plus the batter is super airy and crispy! Rated: 5/5

* Seafood pancake $12 - Large with perfectly crisp edges, but it's rather doughy. The seafood isn't too generous on this one, but the flavor is great! Rated: 4/5

* Bulgogi $14 - A classic dish of marinated thinly sliced beef served with onions on a sizzling platter. Their version tasted fine, maybe not the best I've had but you can't go wrong with it. Rated: 4/5

This is the first place that comes to mind when we want to satisfy our Korean cuisine cravings. The pricing is fair for the amount of food that you receive, on top of the complimentary side dishes offered! We always leave happy!

PRO TIP: Don't forget to check-in on yelp, show your server and receive a free small sized ""shaved ice"" dessert topped with ice cream, corn flakes, condense milk and fruit!",u_wqt9RshdZsoj8ikLqoEQ,73,69,5,taEZ0wFeF8Ghw9P8EeFniA

My friend and I both shared the combination sundubu, yukaejang, and soy garlic chicken wings. All the dishes were reasonably priced (each item was under $12 each)  and delicious. The chicken wings were perfect-- perfectly crispy with enough sauce to provide flavor without making the chicken skin soggy. Meals come with the standard banchan- including kimchi, macaroni salad (yum!), fishcake, daikon, and green veggies marinated in sesame oil. Also came with a side of salad with a very delicious sweet sesame salad dressing. My friend and I were both extremely full from all the ordered food, and we still had leftover extra wings to eat as late night snack.

We got the tteokbokki or spicy rice cakes. I don't remember if I knew it had cheese or not but I do remember being overly happy when I saw it came with cheese. 

For someone with a bad spice tolerance, I endured the pain and kept eating the rice cakes. I'm missing them right now, as I right this review.

I give Q Bistro much praise because the food is always solid. The chicken wings are overrated but they are overrated for a reason! The only other place that had decent wings was Bazic/a18 which aren't open anymore. I always get half plain and half marinated and it never disappoints. If you're craving for soup, the budae jigae is my favorite. Perfect for sharing and it goes so well with some beer or soju.

Ah yes, the drinks :) Totally dig the buy 2 get 1 free beer promo they have going on right now. They have a variety of drinks on their menu and the yogurt soju is good if you have girls that prefer something fruity.

Last but not least the atmosphere is spot on. I'm not a total fan of their recent renovation because it's brighter than what it used to be but you still get that bar-atmosphere you will find in authentic places from the streets of Seoul. Everyone there is having a good time and laughing, talking, taking selfies and just enjoying life. The fact that it's right next to a karaoke, billiards and pc cafe you can probably spend 3 days around the area without running out of things to do.

Huge fan of this place. Even with the recent addition of dozens and dozens of restaurants in the Chinatown area, it's still holds up as King in my books.",De-dImXf-TOFWWPTUWwIvw,3,3,5,YdxIrV3HWIXrHOkDVvcL8g

I was in a party of 3 and we were greeted and seated promptly in a booth. Their booths are pretty large and can seat 6, maybe 8. They have 4 booths and quite a few tables that can accommodate larger parties.

Korean music was playing but not too loud with the Music video projected on the wall. Cute decor with hanging lights. Clean bathrooms!

Condiments are on the table. They give you a water pitcher so you don't need to keep waving the server over for refills. 

There's a board of soju flavors on the wAlls on the booths. Buy 2, get one free! We got yogurt, mango and pineapple (or peach) last time!  Yogurt was the best one. Also, beers, soju, sake and cocktails are buy 2 get one free!

We were told the supreme (medium spicy) and soy garlic were the best flavors so that's what we went with. Note: you can only order half and half sauces for the 20 piece OR the family Whole chicken ($21). GET THE SUPREME AND SOY GARLIC SAUCE!!! You won't regret it! The supreme was a bit spicy for me but I liked it more than the soy garlic, which I found to be a bit on the sweet side. The supreme chicken wings were a bit too saucy but I just rubbed off the excess sauce on my plate. One thing that I did not like was that the chicken wings came out warm and not piping hot. Also, I would recommend that they provide a small bucket for the bones like other places.

3/5 The bulgogi kimbab (think of Korean sushi with bulgogi and veggies) had fresh veggies and was pretty good. I thought it would be a small portion for $6 but it was big!

5/5 We also ordered the bulgogi fried rice ($9). There was corn, bell peppers, a fried egg on top and onions. Bulgogi was well seasoned. The rice had sort of a charbroiled taste to it which was surprisingly pleasant. 

Banchan included macaroni salad, pickled radish, kimchi, fishcake and spinach (I could be wrong about this last one). Fishcake was decent. My sister raved about the macaroni salad but I thought it was just ok. But the side dishes are complimentary and refillable. Kimchi was super fermented, therefore super sour. I like my kimchi kind of fresh and not super fermented so I didn't enjoy it. 

My friends and I definitely went overboard with the ordering but the atmosphere was good and we really enjoyed the soju! It's a chill environment and doesn't get too loud.

The bulgogi pizza is essentially a supreme with marinated beef. Very tasty! The mozzarella sticks were awesome can't go wrong with fried cheese. The baked mussels were a 10! I will go back and try more options for sure! The service was very friendly and not rushed at all. She even let me take my drink afterwards to Karaoke Q because we had a room! The drinks were a 10!

3114639,2017-01-13,1,XsSgv3vBOyOBXn3Co8EVIg,"Q Bistro is a really great place to eat at when you're in the mood for something comforting, like pizza or wings, and having an Asian flair to it. It's also a cool place to hang out with friends because of the really late business hours and the karaoke joint (Q Karaoke) that's right next door. Similar names, one establishment.

I highly recommend their Bulgogi Pizza and Soy Garlic Chicken Wings. These are my family's faves! Especially the Soy Garlic Chicken. It's bomb. Definitely a must-try. 
When ordering the wings, you can choose how many pieces you'd like. A great option when you have a bigger group at your table. And because I'm a french fry-head, I advise you to add a side of fries to your order. lol

Service is awesome and I've never had any complaints. The call button that's built-in on each table is also a really good way to make sure customer service is readily available.

As for Q's karaoke joint, it's the one I mostly go to, and have been for years. They have more rooms than other karaoke places such as A18, but they can get really busy on the weekends. There is a waiting list if all the rooms are full and you'll never know when you'll be called. However, their music selection is always being updated and new songs are added all the time. Having songs in different languages is a plus!",EEAoUs1w38JHfHZMeSdqPQ,5,2,5,4opoBc2xlUcI9KDFavjPnw

The wings were nice and crispy and dripping in a combination of soy ginger and sweet sauce.  They were good, but I wanted a spicier sauce, so we asked for the spicy Korean sauce that's normally on Korean fried chicken.  It was exactly what they needed.  Sweet and spicy!  Of the soups we ordered (dumpling soup, bone broth soup, spicy tofu soup) I really like the dumpling soup, though all were good.  

The service here was great.  The girls working there were attentive and friendly.  Not usually the hallmark of a Korean establishment.

The parking lot is almost packed if you go there past 6pm, but luckily I had princess parking.  Located on Jones and Spring Mountain in the middle of a strip mall full of other asian restaurants and karaoke bars.  

The sign above the door says there's no MSG.  They might be right, but the flavor was too good to be true.  Most restaurants that don't use MSG in their food are very bland in flavor, but this place was excellent. 

The inside was dark and quite chic.  The had pop and R&B music going with some K-pop music videos on TV.  Free shaved ice with check in and the shaved ice is shareable between about 4 people.  

Appetizers include korean stir fry noodles (my fave) with kimchee (spicier than kimchee in other places), fish cake, and I can't remember what the 4th appetizer was.  Our orders took a while to come out, so we probably had 2-3 servings of appetizers.  

We ordered the bulgogi, stir fried squid and pork belly, pan seared brisket, and kimchee soup.

The bulgogi was delicious, but the portion was smaller than most places.  It was only good enough for one person.  If you don't have much of an appetite, maybe 2.  Nonethless, the flavor with the onions was sweet and savory. 

The kimchee soup was very spicy (which I like).  I was hoping for more slices of pork.  There was very little of it.  It was very rich in spiciness and flavor.  One of the best kimchee soups I've tasted. 

Then there's the pan seared brisket.  Good with the 2 sauces they give you.  This one is a shareable portion for 2 people.  

Even though our order took longer than expected, the servers were very friendly and accomodating.  They let us know exactly by the minute how long our food was going to take and brought out extra servings of appetizers.  I really like the stir fried noodles.

Thus, I decided to go with the other intern on nights at our other hospital for a late-night meal. My colleague had never tried Korean food before, so since Q Bistro was open late, we decided to dine here.

Q Bistro has an adjacent karaoke place next door, which at 1:15AM was still very busy and popular, though in the bistro/food side, there was only one other party dining when I entered. The interior is very modern and there is K-pop playing in the background, so definitely a very hip place.

There was only one employee working this late at night, but she was very friendly and attentive, checking on us regularly throughout the meal. And if you ever have trouble flagging down your server, there is a call button at every table as well.

I know that Q Bistro is known for their chicken wings/Korean fried chicken and have interesting items like bulgogi pizza, but since it was my friend's first foray into Korean food, I decided to stick to more traditional dishes. In addition, she only eats halal meat but eats seafood so we stuck to seafood options.

I was a bit disappointed at the banchan; we only got four dishes and one was a hotdog dish and another was a spiral pasta salad, both somewhat unusual banchan and not all that exciting. The other two were fish cake and japchae, which were better. 

For our actual meal, we shared three dishes: seafood soft tofu stew, seafood pancake, and stir-fried rice cakes. We ordered the soft tofu at medium spice level, and it wasn't very spicy at all, though the rice cakes dish comes moderately spicy. The seafood pancake was nice and crispy but a tad on the oily side; it was also cut into small, ~2cm squares, which made it easier to dip in the sauce, though I've never seen seafood pancake cut this way before.

All in all, the food was solid, the prices reasonable, and the portions decent, but I've had way better Korean food elsewhere. I'd still like to come back and try their fried chicken and pizza though!

P.S. The check-in offer of free shaved ice is amazing! The portion is HUGE and comes with lots of fresh fruit, ice cream, and cereal flakes; basically patbingsu without the pat!",lQCY0csLfjdDn6cdVq43UA,3,1,4,z9kbKJVDhnOoeQuyiU2vlA

The place has a casual, but somewhat intimate atmosphere because of the secluded positioning of some of the tables. Luckily, those tables have buzzers that customers can use to let the servers know they're needed, so that's not an issue. The waiters are nice, albeit not very personable. Maybe it's because this place seems to cater to Korean customers more?

I ordered bulgogi pizza. The crust was too thick for me, and it was topped with so many ingredients that it was difficult to pick it up, but it was good enough to enjoy. 

On the brighter side, the food portions here are huge. To newbies, I suggest ordering two or three dishes for 4-6 people to share and then adding onto that order later. Sharing will also keep the price down by a ridiculous amount, making this one of the cheapest places in Vegas to stuff yourself with Korean food at.

We got two orders of popcorn chicken, one was garlic soy and the other was 'hot and spicy'. The garlic soy: Dericious! The hot and spicy wasn't really spicy at all - I would definitely go with garlic soy again and maybe a different flavor. We also ordered the sweet potato pizza - different, but SO good! They had a buy one get one free soju, so why not :3 ? There were also a good amount of side dishes, ranging from japchae, to kimchi, to hot dogs (which was our least favorite). The waitress was really nice, checked up on us often, and even refilled whichever side dishes we wanted! 

One of the things I really appreciated about this place was the table bells to call your waiter/waitress if you ever needed anything ~

They have a lot of fun drinks like yogurt soju and they have buttons on their table when you need the staff.

I tried their onion rings, calamari, kimbap, their bulgogi pizza, potato pizza, and their fried chicken.

4343558,2015-01-03,0,XsSgv3vBOyOBXn3Co8EVIg,"My husband wanted me to try Bobchon, so we found this place on yelp and kept it in my bookmarks. So glad my hubby remembered me mentioning it was a late night spot being we were looking to get dinner around 10pm last night. 

Parking was a nightmare, but understandable considering the food and entertainment options in the plaza. 

Overwhelmed by the loud karaoke place next door, we were relived when we walked in  to the calm Bistro. We were kind of exhausted from the day and wanted a calm meal. The ambiance was unique. Loved the private feel that was given with the garland-like curtains. The tables were quite large so an intimate feel was missing but we fixed that by sitting side-by-side on the bench. 

We started with drinks. We typically like to drink something imported to go with the ethnicity of the meal. Thanks to our server, she was extremely understanding when we didn't care for the pomegranate wine and brought us two Korean beers instead. BO was a perfect match for our meal!

The chicken wings ruined me. I will never be able to eat a chicken wing anywhere else. You can hear the crunch with every bite! You'd think that with a wing as crispy as these the meat would be dried out but that is NOT the case here at all. Each bite was filled with juicy goodness!  The wings were huge but honestly the crispy outer skin was what made them, along with the supreme sauce of course!  Next time I would do the popcorn chicken. I spied them on the table beside us and loved that you could mix and match two sauces and I can only imagine the crisp you'd get with every bite!  The slaw that accompanied the wings was nothing to brag about. I was hoping it would have share a similar flavor of the macaroni salad they give as a side before the meal. 

Now, once the spice from the Supreme sauce was all I could taste, the pickled daikon was a great way to cleanse the palate before delving into our pizza.  How unique, pizza at a Korean bistro!  I'm glad that we were able to do two toppings.  We went specifically for the kalbi pizza but to our surprise the sweet potato pizza blew us away!  

Overall the food was great!  Service was slow, we sat for a while waiting to get out of there.  I guess that was a good thing because it gave our full bellies some time to rest!",1uJLNBBkHDsoKnSUQev5uQ,0,0,5,dCkPIVVHB7edvLPEeYi94A
4347943,2017-09-01,0,XsSgv3vBOyOBXn3Co8EVIg,"I was excited to try this place out because the reviews all seem positive and good with the pictures of the food looking delicious. Turned out to be a disaster for me and my friend. I now understand why everyone gives this place 4-5 stars, because the restaurant bribes you to write a review on Yelp to get a free drink or food item. I think more people should be honest and write their reviews without being pressure to make a good review just because they give you something free here. 

My friend and I wanted to try the pork hock plate so we ordered it. My friend wanted pork soup but they didn't have anything so our server recommend we get the kimchi soup which says it has pork in it. We asked if the soup was spicy and the server told us just a little spicy. When we got the soup, it was really spicy. My friend didn't eat much of the soup she was disappointed because she can't really eat spicy and our server said it was just a little bit but he lied and of course he didn't try to fix it or make t better he just told her to drink some water. What the hell is that? The soup also had almost no pork in it. They were very very very small piece and I only found 3 piece on the bottom and you have to like dig into the soup to find any pork and when you did it was super super small. Soup was very disappointing. We had a pasta side dish and my friend eventually finish it and she wanted more since the side dishes come in very small portion. She asked the server to refill on the side dish and she had to ask him 4 times before he went to refill it! On top of that our server never came to check up on us and our meal. My friend had to yell a few times to get his attention to come to us. 

I was super super disappointed in the pork hock plate as well. The meat was very cold, no flavor, and very hard to eat. I was so so disappointed. We asked to cancel this dish and asked to take it back and we would order a substitute but our server wouldn't let us and you have to remember we are at a Korean restaurant and their service won't be good as if you were at an American restaurant they would let you take back any dish if you were unsatisfied with your dish. We seriously just took one bite of the pork and everything was untouched for the dish. I don't understand why they wouldn't let you take back a dish if you were completely unhappy with the dish. They're ok with their customers being unhappy with the food? Yet they expect you to write a great review on Yelp because they're willing to give you a free item off their choice. 

Overall I recommend everyone don't come here to eat the food isn't good and our server didn't care about us at all. Go eat at Soyo, Magal BBQ, Hobak or somewhere else their food and service is way way way better.",lQBZo8_mm80dbwI5bo5c_w,0,0,1,jNssWvDmI17dEUizULoMEA

It was nice and soft inside while remaining crunchy outside. Their spicy tofu soup was also excellent, keeping the soft tofu intact and not all broken like most other places when served to you. And oh boy, the cheese tonkatsu caught me by surprise, it is very well presented and have a nice and fresh crunch to it. Also served with rice and a croquette , all for just $11!

4401432,2016-02-01,4,XsSgv3vBOyOBXn3Co8EVIg,"Best. Korean. Chicken Wings. Ever.

You can find this spot right next to the ever popular Q Karaoke. Parking kind of sucks in this plaza as well.

The waiter started us off with the traditional Korean side dishes, always my favorite part of the Korean dining experience.
Not sure if the side dishes change from time to time like other restaurants, but this time, we got:
- Tofu skin: SO GOOOOOD! I couldn't stop eating this
- Weenies: pretty good.. they were hot dog weenies in a sauce mixture of ketchup and hot sauce
- Noodles: Love it
- Macaroni salad: not a huge fan of them usually but this was good

They were having a special of buy 2 get 1 draft beer free, with your choices being Blue Moon, Coors Light, Asahi, and something else. We all got two rounds of Asahi which went very well with our dinner.

We ordered 20 pieces of wings for 5 people. We chose the flavors ""supreme"" and ""soy garlic."" If you want to know how ""supreme"" tastes, I found that our waiter described the supreme flavor very very accurately, ""it's sweet but sour, and on a spicy level of 1 to 10, it's like a 4.""

The soy garlic flavor was very good! The supreme was great as well but was actually too spicy for me. I was only able to eat one or two (note: radishes are great palette cleansers!).

We ordered another dish to share but it ended up being too spicy for the entire table and I wasn't a fan of the strong kimchi taste so I only had 1-2 bites.

For dessert, we received the 1 free shaved for the table. The size of the shaved ice was enough for the 5 of us. I actually wasn't a fan of the shaved ice really. It had strawberries and bananas to top it off along with (vanilla?) ice cream. The flavor of the shaved ice was mango or melon or a combination of something too sweet for my taste. I wouldn't get it again unless it was free.

Overall, good experience, and would come back again for the beer and wings.",os-sDQoh-hCt2Lg76z6ZUA,5,4,4,Sw23tr_1XLTPgvKLVNJXXA

4530043,2015-09-10,1,XsSgv3vBOyOBXn3Co8EVIg,"Experience:  Came with about 8 folks on a Wed at 6pm. I've been to the Karaoke side, but this is my first time eating here. 

Facility:  it was a small place, dimly lit with modern Asian decor. One of the reasons I am marking this review down is because it was HOT in there!!!  We asked them to reposition the fan to face us, but it barely helped. People literally had sweat running down their face. It was so hot and uncomfortable, we ended up cutting the dinner short, and we normally hang out and talk and have drinks. Some of use moved to another bar to have our social time because it was just too uncomfortable to stay there. The management needs to understand, the money they are saving on A/C, they are losing on business. No one wants to sit in a restaurant all hot and sweaty. 

Service:  The service was ok. We ordered a lot of finger food, so the one chinchsy see-through napkin on the table was sad. Of course we had to ask for more. Isn't it nice when the waitstaff predicts your needs. Maybe it's cheap management trying to save a buck again. Anyway, It was nice they have ""doorbells"" on the table, so you could get the server's attention.  The other issue is they served the draft beers with a huge amount of head on them. I asked to pour a little off and add some more beer, and then they tried to hold everyone's beers to let the head go down, so it would take 15min to get a beer. Someone needs to teach them the art of tilting a glass or over-pour. 

Food:  I enjoyed the food. It wasn't the best Korean food in town, but it was good. There were a lot of American dishes or twists on the menu too. 
Kalbi - 3.5/5 - the Kalbi was good and served on a sizzling plate of onions, with a side of white rice. Good flavor, but kinda seemed a little pricey at $15 a plate. 
Cheese corn - 5/5 - Everyone at our table kept asking, is it just cheese and corn...yes, it was. But considering I love corn and I love cheese, I loved this dish! 
French Fries - 5/5 - I tasted someone else's and they were really good. They were hot, crispy and a nice flavor. 
Pork Hocks - 3/5 - I tasted this too. It was a pretty big portion.  It was ok. Just tasted like pork. It's served on a platter to make lettuce rolls outta it with accoutrements such as such, garlic cloves and jalapeños. 
Pork belly and squid - 4/5 - again, another dish I just tasted. It had a really good flavored sauce that was spicy with a slight sweet flavor. It was a nice size portion too. 

Overall: if they could lower the A/C temp to a comfortable temp, I would come back. The food was good, the service was good enough, but it was just too damn hot!",-50XWnmQGqBgEI-9ANvLlg,4,1,3,ffLm8ntzg-eJHQ_VARZeJQ

Last time I came, the waiter completely forgot about our order until we asked him 30 minutes later. He said he would check up on it, but I saw him print out the ticket and bring it to the kitchen... And with the sane excuse, he said their kitchen is busy because they use for karaoke too. I sat right by the kitchen and saw the chefs talking because they had nothing to do:/ When we left after our meal, we walked past the karaoke bistro and of course, it was EMPTY. 

At least today, the waitress apologized but gave us the excuse their frier wasn't hot enough. Then the waitor came to say sorry, but this time said the kitchen was busy? Um, so where's my food?...

5010480,2017-06-24,0,XsSgv3vBOyOBXn3Co8EVIg,"This restaurant has me super torn. Initially, we came here for Karaoke, but after reading all the reviews raving about the food, we thought we'd kill 2 birds with one stone and get some dinner as well. Also, my husband was craving some Korean fried chicken anyway so why not.

So, can't really complain about the karaoke aspect here. Decent selection of songs. The book is massive, but like 75% of the songs are Korean, so if you are into Kpop or here to sing in Korean, you have found the perfect place. It also has a decent selection of English and Japanese songs. 

The food is where I become torn. It was mediocre at best. We ordered original KFC and bulgogi fries. The chicken was, like, ROCK SOLID. I know KFC is typically super crunchy, but crunchy and hard are not the same. Subsequently, the chicken was hella dry. My husband liked it, but I was not here for it. Skip. The bulgogi fries as well were, like, ALMOST good. It was essentially nachos on fries though, I didn't feel anything ""Korean"" about it. Just some onions, tomatos, mayo, and ground beef on french fries. Okay? I mean, it wasn't bad I guess. I wouldn't order it again though. 

That being said, we had a fantastic time here. We spent around 2 hours here + the food and it came out to $65. I'd say thats a pretty good deal. I WOULD recommend coming here for Karaoke and drinks, and even some food as a group. I would NOT recommend coming here solely for food.",8C9OO8MD_rekmDTkSPcq6g,0,0,3,D0AcZw8yI600lLPnIDfbIQ

There's multiple sauces to choose from so I'm looking forward to trying the others.  Also good value.  For $10 was given around 8 pieces.  Also came with the traditional side dishes - I wasn't expecting that as I thought that was just for Korean BBQ. They were excellent.  2 picked vegetables and a sweet potato salad (or regular potato salad with some sweet sauce).  
I will definitely try the other main courses.  Saw a hamburger steak and a katsu dish that looked good.

This place isn't the most authentic, if that's what you're looking for, but it's pretty damn delicious! 
We came here on a Saturday night and we were seated immediately due to there not being more than 3 other tables seated. It's very dark in here and they have cool decor. They also have TV's with sports playing for the football fans. Just, no sound. 

The main guy working the hostess desk was playing really slow love songs. That was kind of weird, but whatever. It was some really good 90's hits - Boyz II Men. Oh yes. 
He was also our waiter. I don't know if he serves much because he seemed a little out of place. He was very blunt, which I appreciate, but he seemed as if it really wasn't his job to serve. Also, he didn't check up on us often. We had to get his attention a couple of times. He was very nice though. 

The food was excellent. I recommend - 

The fried pot stickers, Spicy BBQ Pork Ribs and Bulgogi. I definitely want to go back and try out more. All of the meat was cooked perfectly with amazing flavors and the ribs fell off the bone.

Customer service & Food: I haven't had one bad customer service so far, the waiters are attentive and if you ever did anything just ring the bell. Prices are very fair too. I always order the family style half and half soy garlic, and sweet and mild. You can definitely share it with 2-3 people so it ends up being really cheap per person.

First off, THERE WAS NO CHICKEN at dinner time on a Friday at 7:30pm.  I expect a restaurant that advertises something on a banner outside their store front to deliver said item.  Apparently, this wasn't the first time it's happened according to other guests in our party.  Okay, when I said ""no chicken"" I mean they only had chicken wings...but like I said, the drumstick is better and way meatier.  They said it would take 2 hours to defrost the drumsticks.  We begrudgingly ordered the wings.  

The service was horrendous and the delivery of dishes was poor.  Why would the server drop off cheese corn at the table when everyone has finished eating?  It can't possibly take an hour to melt cheese on corn and then serve it.  

The final straw was watching the servers prepare YOUR TO GO MEALS ON THE TRASH CART.  Yes, the server was touching your ready to eat salad with his hands as he prepped this on the cart with the garbage can attached.  When the manager was notified of this, he had the server move into the kitchen and continue.  And we could still see the server prepping the food without gloves.

Food -
2 LA Kalbi ($30), $15 each
Corn Cheese ($6)
Bulgogi Fried Rice ($9)
2 Spicy Tofu Soup ($19), $9.50 each
Bulgogi Fries ($11)
Seared Brisket ($16)

They charged us an automatic 18% gratuity fee so our bill roughly came out to $171 with tax and tip. 

The Soju was really good, my favorite was the Peach then the Grapefruit, and lastly the Citron. It is pretty strong in my opinion as well, and three bottles divided evenly with six people was more than enough. The Starshine Rita looked really good, it was mixed with Mike's Hard and a mango slushee. As for our food when it came out the portioning was pretty descent. I personally had bulgogi fried rice and I couldn't finish it but my friend got a beef brisket and the portioning looked like the LA kalbi my other friend got. The brisket was more expensive than the kalbi and I don't think the price matched the portioning for that, plus they only give you one bowl of rice for your entire entree. Also, I couldn't add extra protein to my fried rice, they had shrimp fried rice and I asked if I could mix both shrimp and bulgogi but our server said no. On top of that when my friend ordered Lemonade or server said they don't have that but we showed her the menu and it stated there was indeed Lemonade... she had to double check with other servers. I guess she was new but our server was nice except it was a bit frustrating that she didn't know the drink/ food items on the menu. She didn't even know the Soju was a buy 2, get 1 free deal, and there was a huge sign hanging next to our table stating the deal... that was the only issue. Other than that the food was good. This is a good place for big groups and dates with your significant other.",80qYPp6Fk_jmO3334DKGGg,1,0,3,NMY8jFWLnRTgsnY7FODMtA

2. Dolsat Bimbimbab was yum
3. Supreme & soy chicken wings were yum and remained hot. Crunchy, saucy, sticky yummy wings!
4. Free shaved ice (w/Yelp checkin) w/strawberries, cantaloupe, watermelon and large enough to share.
5. Service was prompt & polite.

When we went there we were the only customers. I had to find the staff to let them know that we were here. A female Korean wait staff (I did not see a name tag) came out at told us that they were closing and that last call is in 10 minutes. I replied that the signs outside said that it was open until 3:30 AM. Since it was not last call, we said that we can order quickly.

We asked for menus and water to start off. The waitress slammed the water and cups rudely on the table. She indicated that she wanted us out. She succeeded in kicking us out but she was rude and her tone was definitely angry. After a few minutes, our group was not feeling the group and service of this type, warranted no tip for sure. We left but I told the waitress that she got what she wanted and that because it was so obvious that she did not want to work, her attitude got her what she wished for.

We got no apology for closing earlier than posted and the ambivalence caused me trouble as I was finding a place for my out of town guest to eat. I hope that the owner or manager reprimands the waitress that was working at that time last night.

We ordered several dishes, but by far my favorites were the fried chicken and the kimbamp which should totally be dipped into the fish cake sauce. Don't understand how it pairs, but it does!! Smother that shit with it. Seriously.

Kimchi fried rice and corn cheese weren't as great as expected, but what made it up were the incredible sides. Get more fish cakes and bean sprouts. They were to die for. Sides are refillable, don't forget.

5492611,2014-01-22,11,XsSgv3vBOyOBXn3Co8EVIg,I'm seriously upset with myself for waiting this long to go get me some fried chicken :) KFC in my mind stands for Korean fried chicken and I have been looking for a place to match Bon Chon in New York and this place is as close as it's gonna get!  The chicken is extremely crispy on the outside and so moist on the inside it makes the white meat tastes like dark meat!  I love all the sauces they offer but the soy garlic is my favorite.  The family size is a huge portion and can easily feed 4-6 depending on ones appetite.  The dishes come with some ban chan (side dishes) and the cabbage salad with thousand island is a nice pairing to the spicy flavors in some of the dishes and chicken flavors.  We tried the bulgogi fried rice and that was tasty as well.  We also ordered the stir fried gizzards and I would have to recommend not getting it....not enough flavor and overly chewy.  But I'll overlook anything for good fried chicken or in this case SUPERB fried chicken.  Just two words bomb diggity! Similar concept to Soyo but with a cheaper price point.  The chicken beats the chicken wings at soyo and beats the fried chicken at Bazic.  Definitely give this place a try if you are a fried chicken connoisseur and perhaps you can head next door for a little karaoke action afterwards.,Tdv7HZa4Hyjm-X0MtNmeag,21,15,5,rytLvPTDs0VdYzIaXgNEdA

She is Japanese and we mostly eat Japanese food, however as most of you know, Japanese don't typically make spicy food. Even if they do, they don't make it like Koreans... Soooo, let's do it - Q bistro. 
It's in a typical China town kinda parking lot. That means it's wall to wall restaurants and you circle 3 times to find an open space. At first we were like uhhhhh, as we aren't from here and thought we were lost. We wanted dinner. We see a Q karaoke... A Q pool hall, a freaking Q hair salon... So I'm like 
A: ummm we need to find a different place to eat. We've been mislead.
B: whoever Q is, is a baller. Dude owns a lot. 
WAIT!!! There it is... Tucked away between Q karaoke and the salon. Ok cool, let's go in. 
Whooooooooo, this place looks trendy and so clean. Fancy looking too I'm like oh man we are under dressed... Until we see the staff. They weren't dressed inappropriately, just saying same as us. Jeans and t shirt kinda thing... But this place LOOKS so nice that you could wear nicer clothes, a shirt and tie, dress and heals, would not look out of place. The environment is pretty cool. I really enjoyed that. It's like you're in a high end spot, paying low end prices. True definition of ballin on a budget. Guys wanna make that girl you're dating THINK you are stacked when you ain't? Take her here. She'll find out eventually, but not before dinner lol. 
Menu was huge for a bistro. Like 8 pages from apps to zerts... Mix of everything. Mostly Korean, but they still had cheese sticks, pizza, etc... But again, mostly Korean. 
With 15% tip we still came in UNDER $40. Which is pretty reasonable. 
We had: 
Croquette
Cheese sticks
Spicy short rib
Rice
Spicy ramen
Inarizushi 
Coke
Water
5 lil dishes that always come with everything you order in Korea lol. Never know what they are but the normal lil kimchi stuff. 
The inarizushi is freaking huge, it's damn near a meal in itself. The spicy ribs were delicious, tender, and had few pieces of doppoki with it. Nice touch. Cheese sticks were exactly as if you're at like Applebee's not amazing but it's Korean place, I WOULD be the retard or I expected jaw dropping cheese sticks here lol. The croquette had cheese in it... BONUS! We had no idea how BIG the servings were.. We ordered and received all that food, could barely finish half of it, left 15%, still under $40. 
So had we known how much (or rather how large) the portions were... We'd probably only spent about $25.... Well, not really. We'd still spent $40 but would've had dessert lol. 
Big time drink menu too. I don't drink though, but if I did they had it all. 
The food was good, seriously... But the biggest take away I have is how nice and upscale these place seems with how low it's cost is... It's kinda cool. The girl that was our server was from Vietnam... But we don't care. We from Okinawa... So it's whatever. I'm only saying so because in my reviews of Japanese places I always mention of they people are actually Japanese... There were Koreans in there, but again, we don't know the difference in real Korean food (although because of work I've lived in Gwangju and Daegu Korea for 2 yrs)... So it didn't matter to us that she wasn't Korean. Besides, I ordered cheese sticks lol... So really I guess I should've been looking for an Italian chef huh?! FuuuhhGetAboutIt

You'll want to get some sides too - bulgogi fried rice is my recommendation.  The bonchon they provide too is definitely top notch - I loved all the ones I got!  Specifically the fish tofu - mmmmmmmm....  And if you're into soju too, they have a good selection.  I tried it for the very first time - maybe not my thing, but the flavored ones seemed intriguing.

We didn't try it, but you can also do the karaoke bar and order food from the kitchen too.  Shame I missed it, but it's an option, which is def very cool.",7D8Nkcb6ujJCGIBkQ93Nhw,3,2,5,sENMZt3W2JEBvgsUrZNN_A

5753128,2014-10-04,0,XsSgv3vBOyOBXn3Co8EVIg,"I am so glad that we chanced upon this little place, an off-shoot of Q Karaoke lounge next door.  We had actually intended to go to a Szechuan restaurant on Spring Mountain, but upon arriving decided it was a little too Szechuan...  Checking on Yelp for a high-rated Asian, we decided to head over to this place just around the corner.  It's always great to chance upon a great tasting place, but when it is a great Korean place in Vegas, it makes the night.

This place is small, nice but simply decorated, with two large screen TVs.  It's an L-shaped place but the TVs are right next to each other, so there is no view from the other side of the L.  Wish they change that.  We are greeted by an adorable hostess, who ends up being our server as well.  Super cute and super sweet girl... 

We order fried calamari, beef brisket, and sweet potato fries, along with a bottle of makgeolli.  The calamari was good, some pieces were a bit dry but generally meaty and served with cocktail sauce and a soy sauce/sesame oil mix.  The sweet potato fries were great, sufficiently crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  The real winner was the brisket though, served with awesomely yummy side dishes and Korean-style leek salad.  Brisket comes cooked on a bed of onions and jalapenos.  Dip the meat in sesame oil and eat it with the leek salad, and it's marvelous.  I also have to mention the side dishes - fish cakes, sausage, kimchi, japchae, and mung beans - all of which were all fantastic.  

We came here early, around 7pm or so, and it was basically empty.  I'm guessing, since this is a Korean bar, that it comes alive later in the night?  It surely deserves to be crowded, so I'm wondering if we were just early.  Anyways, with great food, cozy but good atmosphere, and great service, we will definitely make our way back here, perhaps after 9pm.

Table-for-1 Factor:  Probably not a good idea, it's a bar with no bar, and not conducive to accommodating single patrons.",52Oq0fCJWaHpQtuKqTkN4g,0,0,5,-lpZnYLZd6r_f539ixJx_A

Everything was fine,  we had some spicy tofu and beef soup.  Waitress was very nice who seated us, excellent table skills, but the waiter who also helps needs work.

They also had fairly loud rap music for background,  and since there was no one there we asked if they could turn it down.  The waitress did, and then the waiter adjusted it back up again.

Prices were very affordable,  and food overall was good.  My suggestion for the restaurant owner is change the music, turn it down, and train your wait staff how to attend a table properly.",Cs_syt7ksaQq_6zG_cLyYg,1,0,3,q4kAVBs3_jfUzrDful2aqQ

Service: Service is always attentive and friendly when I am here. If it by chance is not attentive a button is provided to grab the attention of the staff, but BEWARE as it rings like a doorbell throughout the entire restaurant.

Food: I have loved most of the things I have tried here! Stand outs would be the pork belly, soondubu, cheese tonkatsu and fried rice. The banchan is always delicious as well, although I always have to ask for kimchi (possibly because I am not Korean?).

Prices: Very reasonable for the portion sizes which I feel should always be shared as family style. You can easily feed 3 for around $30 and to top it off beers (all beers so this includes imports) and flavored sojus are buy 2 get 1 free!",OHYr8WLlNgyz3zIyzrY_QQ,2,1,5,dDndvEvhZPF-cW13SpHQyw

Anyway, lack of menu knowledge aside, their chicken wings are pretty bomb. I went with original and supreme. The original basically is just fried chicken wings in their house seasoning, served without any sauce.  The Supreme is fried chicken wings in their spicy Supreme sauce (has some kick that builds up over time, not one that will bring you to your knees right off the bat. Not unless you are French.)

I ordered these to go and they included some diced marinated radish and a side of coleslaw (Family size order).  This snack was good and my friends and I killed it in no time.  I would come back in the future to check out the rest of the menu, especially their pizzas, or after spending time next door at their Karaoke lounge.  I think with the traditional side dishes that are typically served with your food, it would be a better value.

While waiting for my order, I had ample time to check out the decor. The atmosphere is trendy, with street art-style decor on black walls, as if you were at some underground club in LA.  Tables were not placed too close together, which is nice.  The place was maybe 20% full at about 7:30pm on a weekday, when the parking lot outside is packed and finding an open spot to park was a minor test in patience.

3 stars for now.  Will update again after I come back.",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,7,6,3,sTaQ-lUvEhec3ZxhVSC17Q
