Naming it my last time going . 
I waited in the drive thru for 25 minutes and there was only one car ahead of me. It wasnt even busy . That's the longest I've waited in any drive thru no matter how busy it is. Smh",TI5VjboUJUkO9DOmCerZSA,0,0,1,cynBljSuzR7syTksscYPGw

Never never again will I ever eat at Del Taco and will try to convince anyone else not to as well.

I usually get service around that time but when I pulled up to the speaker and the female said they're closed till 6am. No need to promote 24 hrs if your not gonna be 24 hrs. As I drive by to depart she had her head down at a table. At least hide from the customer as they drive by, don't just put your head down like you hate your life. That's why they get 1 star, no mention why they were closed and looking lazy so customers can see you as they drive by.",TmQnQ3wh2KGOblDgcRXXIA,0,0,1,tDGNT1M2kAfrrUR1Q0KR6A

They were very friendly and apologetic about the situation and gave me a credit at their store. Fantastic customer service Del Taco! Kudos to you!

Ordered my food and was told to pull up just before the window? What kind of service is that? Ummm no i think im going to drive to the window like normal people so that i can see my food being made. And then the young girl at the drive thru has the nerve to give off negative vibes along with her attitude, which showed. How do you expect to get respect if you cant give it. Bottom line, if you dont like where you work, go somewhere else. Hopefully management sees this and will do something about the service and their employee.",V6BcWnZCFTuxNSalk8olCA,0,0,1,p1nfzP2UZBT-Kq3X4r95tg

What i got at tge window was sok wrong i handed the bags back and told tge manager what my order was. She keep trying to give me the samw wrong items and was grossly incompetent. She spoke englisg well enouhh so that was not it. I as told the chicken and beef tacos were both on special...NOPE charged me full price for chux, glad i caught it. The manager would not make it right and honor what the cashier promissed me.

I would take 30 more mins to write up everything that went wrong, so i will juat say that 10 mins at the drive thru window is the last 10 mins i will ever waste at this place.

That's the problem with franchises (i'm guessing) because no two locations prepares the food the same way.  I should of trusted my gut when I saw this location; it looked closed.  It even took them a while to answer the drive through call, I almost backed out but they caught me just in time.  I waited over 10 minutes for my order but I told myself ""well its probably freshly made.""  It was freaking gross.  First off all, the burger looked like something out of the school cafeteria.  Secondly, it was a double del which one would assume there are two patties of meat.  They took a regular patty and sliced it down the middle.  Third, I asked for NO ONIONS (it's the fruit of the devil) but there were onions in it anyway.  You'd figure they had enough time to get my order right.  No other cars, no other customers.  Nothing chaps my hide more than f***ing up my drive through order.  And these people want to be paid $15.00 an hour?  F*** you!",zgP9fjWWD2UMVbiYOWIBQA,0,0,1,cGepQRafYkpDnGfXcT17TA

This location asks almost every car to pull into a parking spot after they charge you so they can falsify their drive-thru time. Not only do they falsify their drive-thru time but they can never seem to get my order right. I wouldn't mind waiting if the food was decent and the employees checked the bag before bringing it to my car. It has gotten to the point where I lose $5 every time.

I rarely complain and I have given them several chances this past year since they are closest one to my home but no more. They NEVER get my family orders right. We have had to return there almost every time when we get home and unwrap our food. They not only get the orders wrong, they are NOT Consistent with the food quality or ingredients! No Chicken in the Avocado Chicken Fresca Bowl but plenty of soupy black beans overload, No signature white sauce in the soft chicken tacos and very little chicken, asked for 2 2-packs of their cheescake bites and get only 2 in one sleeve and have to repeat it several times until I literally had to count out to them how many I ordered on my fingers, missing items happen too often, no napkins, forks, etc. They make you either back up and wait or sit in the parking lot so their timer doesn't count your wait time every time, even if no other customers are there! and the wait time is one of the longest I've ever had to wait anywhere nearly every time. This time 2 people in line almost started a fist fight because the one in front of everyone was 4 feet back from the pick-up window and would not move forward which everyone in line assumed he was doing to be a jerk so honking and yelling ensued until 2 men got out of their cars to have at it. to stop the fight My husband had to yell at them to explain how this Del Taco makes you stay back a few feet to wait .  Each time my frustrated husband has returned our terrible food or returned to get the missing items in the orders, they could care less. Not friendly or offer to make it right or correct their business practices to keep it from happening so often. nothing but robots who really don't care about their customers or image. Maybe ordering inside has better service and food prep but I'm not really willing to try after these several chances through their drive through.",vdE0K8yDZ97qCe8t2mQP6w,0,0,1,N2tQV41MaIIc0EuHJlWZuA

If no one answered and I didn't see where else to go then why do I have to wait in the parking lot when fries are so easy?  I'm 5 seconds from The window anyhow... Why do they have to be so rude?

Got a deluxe taco salad with beef ($4.59) which was good.  The shell was nice and crispy and it was full of shredded lettuce, refried beans, salsa, guac, ground beef, and sour cream.  
Also got a chicken quesadilla ($3.31).  It was amazing...the outside was crunchy and the inside was hot, gooey, melted cheese and chicken.  Loved it.
