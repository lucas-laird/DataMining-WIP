50295,2016-02-14,0,FYqFfaxVRW6pdviONXIoDw,"Wife and I spent our anniversary with an unplanned visit to Vegas.

The Fleming ambiance was perfect, the service was impeccable. I had ordered ribeye 20 oz. And my wife ordered the fillet minion. I normally order all my meat black and blue (rare). The meat was cooked to perfection and full of flavor. 

My wife favors her steak with little pink, but many times at other steakhouses the meat is either over cooked or under cooked. But today at Flemings it was perfect.

My wife and I now have a favorite prime steakhouse from the numerous in Las Vegas.",Pfx1Ue87nd0kdSFmKwQFIg,0,0,5,7COxmLGG_5OXxo7Bh5NOoA
70595,2014-12-01,0,FYqFfaxVRW6pdviONXIoDw,A great Steak Restaurant in Town Square.  There were two of us and we waited about 10 minutes for a table.  They called us by our Surname once our table was ready.  It was a busy night which made it a bit loud.  I had the Filet Mignon rare and it was one of the best I ever ate.

173545,2014-04-22,0,FYqFfaxVRW6pdviONXIoDw,"My wife and I went here for Date Night.  I don't think this is a good Date Night place. 5 stars for service, 4 for food, 2 for value and 1 for ambience.  So I averaged it at 3.

Ambience is more for the ""power lunch/dinner"" crowd.  We did get a nice booth but that didn't shelter us from the loud noise in this place.  Lots of fast-paced background music and lots of males in polo shirts with company logos.  Must be a convention in town.

They like to tout their dry-aged beef.  I've had good dry-aged beef (I've even done it myself) and theirs didn't seemed to have the qualities I have experienced in the past.  We had a steak that was basically a huge Ribeye meant to be shared for two for $100.  My wife's half was okay but the half I got was basically all fat which I don't much care for.  It was a sizeable steak but split in half you got two small ones.  It was overcooked to our taste but it is pretty hard to order a steak and get it the way you want.  The three sauces served on the side were good and paired well with the steak.

The sides were tasty and probably the best part of the meal.  Though I usually don't find Mac-n-Cheese to be something worthy of ordering in fine dining, theirs, with plenty of Gruyere cheese, did taste good.

They have a rather large wine list and probably the greatest thing about this restaurant is the Enomatic, allowing them to offer so many of them by the glass.  But, don't expect that to make it a value.

Service was friendly and excellent throughout.  The ""Chef"" came out with the steak and cut it for us.  Reservations are HIGHLY recommended at this location because it is always busy.

Overall, this place did not offer ambience and quality that I was looking for, especially for date night, and at the premium price.  If you are a big corporation trying to land an account and willing to spend the money on it, this place might be okay.

I now get a barrage of emails from them with deals.  One looks like it might be worth trying: 5 menu items for 6 dollars before 7.   I think it is only available at the bar.  So perhaps we'll see if Happy Hour is more enjoyable.",_f2gLN3JSI-WYpgakE66aw,1,0,3,7E4KLoN8Nf0uzKUCw6oT7w
178077,2016-05-15,2,FYqFfaxVRW6pdviONXIoDw,"The entire meal was a total let down. 
We ordered the Seafood Tower for an appetizer.  It was good.  But,  I don't give bonus points for placing frozen food into a bowl of ice.  
My husband got the chillean sea bass. It was so gross that I literally almost spit it out on the table, and he didn't bother to finish it.  
I was served an undercooked fillet. On top was a crab cake, including some of the crabs' shell. 
We also got some unimpressive side dishes. 
Our server, who had raved about a dessert that she recommended we order,  never came to see if we wanted to order it. In fact, the only time she was could be found was when she was refilling our bottled water. Over and over again.  
We sat waiting with the dirty dishes in front if us for at least 15 minuets.  In fact,  they were there so long that the manager came by and asked how everything was.  Refilled our water glasses.  Again.  Then walked away and let the dishes sit.

We booked a table for 7 pm but was told there's no available table even at 6:55. The water ordered was not served until 10 min later as we were told they were waiting for the bread?! The amuse bouche, a too large deep fried ravioli, was simply too greasy and more like something from a cheap fast food store. And then the salad was even more absurd. Some uncut lettuce?! Are you kidding me? No knife was offered and the plate of the amuse bouche was not even collected after the salad was served. And speaking of the steak, to be fair, it is not bad. But served with a lobster tail and nothing else made it more like a nightmare of protein.

The crispy pork bellies had a great flavor and were very enjoyable. The baked Brie was just okay. The French onion soup was well done with an excellent flavor. The salads were average. The meat entrees were average to poor. All were cooked to the proper temperature but for prime meat lacked flavor. The prime rib was very dry. The desserts were all good. 

The service was also a bit mixed. Our table was not ready at the time of our reservation and the lobby area is very limited. Upon being seated it took a long time to get our initial drinks (approx 10 minutes) for water.

Although the server was wonderful, the food was not fresh, it was badly cooked, and yet we spent $350 for 2 people. I had the lobster tails, they were undercooked (I have never been served undercooked lobster in my life) and tasted fishy. Feeling bad, I told them to stick them under the broiler rather than cook me a new plate, which they did, and that helped absolutely none to improve the flavor - even fully cooked, the lobster tasted a bit ""fishy"" which really bothered me, not fresh. My husband had the beef carpaccio appetizer, the meat was too thickly sliced and he said it  tasted ""defrosted"" which meant it was ""wet"" but the wetness was from water, rather than the juice of nice fresh raw beef. The Caesar salad I had before the lobster had no flavor, nothing special, not enough dressing, very small. We got a side order of cooked asparagus that was unremarkable at best. My husband's filet mignon was nothing great, he said I cooked them better at home. We were both truly disappointed, a night out in Vegas for that amount of money should have given us a fond memory to think of for years to come.

Calamari was very light and it's our favorite

Rib eye was too fatty. I could only eat half of my steak. The other half was just fat. I though I was the ""lucky"" one but my cousin's rib eye too were very fatty. 

The prime rib dinner was good but it's not as good as Lawry's

Creamed corn, the kid like it but I don't

Asparagus should have grilled a little longer...

The food is great though and the ONLY reason we keep going back. The Dry Aged Rib Eye is amazing, along with the Short Ribs, Flemings Potatos and Onion Soup.

Everyone enjoyed their steaks.
I didn't go that route and had soup and salad.  The soup was good...nothing over the top and the salad was just a disgrace for $10.50.  It was the Fleming Salad and it seriously had two small pieces of walnuts and a few cranberry's.  You expect just a shade better for that price in that kind of restaurant.  
Unless someone else is paying....not worth the price in this town.  So many better steak houses in Las Vegas than Flemings.

That being said... On my 4th lifetime visit to a Flemings... 2 was all it deserved. And it got those two because of our server who was great. Today is my wife's bday. We're also celebrating an Anniv and a graduation. We both ordered a Cesar salad, the she had a filet with scallops and mashed. I had a main filet with Flemings potatoes. Both of us ordered medium. Warm, pink middle. 
We cut into our steaks and no oink to be seen. Just dark meat. Purplish?  We showed our waiter and he used the food back to the chef who prepared new steaks. This time her was so underdone it looked like sushi. That was sent back as well for a quick Tod's in the broiler which ended up making it tough and chewy. 
I've Lay's been blow  away by how good the steaks are here. This time they seemed very under seasoned as well. And to be perfectly honest.. I don't think the meat was right. I don't know if it was going bad, or improperly aged, or just plain bad. But what I do know is it wasn't right. 35+yrs of eating and making steaks.... I know what medium should be. What it should be is what I got on the last 3 times I was there. 

I also watched two other tables by us send back their steaks as well! 

I'm disappointed. 

The manager ( I believe)  came by and checked on us at one point. She was super nice. My wife at this point was embarrassed . the lady did try to make things better.  

A short time later our waiter brought the check full price bit brought my bday girl a few chocolates and  25 gift certificate for next time.

I highly suggest the Fleming potatoes and brussel sprouts. Scalloped potatoes on top of a twice-baked potato?! Add cheese and jalapeño and it's delightfully scrumptious.

The desert we had was the cheesecake and it was old fashioned New York style which I prefer, not too sweet and extravagant like most west coast restaurants select for some reason, this is one of those things that are better as first intended, I believe.

The waitress while attentive and obviously skilled could have been a bit more professional.

My husband had the Double Lobster Tails ( they were very good ) and we split the the Shoestring Potatoes ( love the fries ) . 
My chicken was  dry !!!  So I sent it back, I received many apologies from the waiter and the manager ( whom I did not ask to speak with I do not like managers approaching my table when the server can handle a situation.)  I did let the waiter know its not a problem no more apologies were needed.  I decided to have the lobster instead since my husbands was good, Soooo they rushed my lobster tail out... This is why i gave my experinece 2 stars, My lobster tasted like it was put in a microwave and sprinkled with a boat load of paprika it was like chewing on rubber. It was nothing like the lobster my husband was served, I did not let the waiter know about this because after I sent the chicken back one would think they would have made every effort to make the new entree correct. I was not in a hurry to leave so why they rushed I don't know.  I was not up for sending it back because at this point I decided I would not come back to this restaurant again. I should have just eaten the dry chicken it would have been the better option. The waiter did offer a dessert on the house to make dinner right which was very nice.. I had the chocolate lava cake it was good.  The service was the best part of the evening, the place did get busy so at times it took a while for him to come around so I give 4 stars for Service.  After spending $120 + Would I come back ? Nope not a chance.",N9TANMHJ8SLZHRPw6GtkyA,0,0,2,Z7q-1FZomMdH6_mm6kgdKw

Also Kevin was very understanding and helpful when I needed to change my credit card and use my gift card also. It was my mistake but he took an action quickly and took care of it. Also Vanessa at the hostess desk was nice and took care of my dine rewards that I didn't originally mentioned to Kate. She went to see Kate and  by the time she came back to the desk my reward was posted on my account. 
To tell the truth, I was treated horribly by a manager (not Kevin) over the phone. I always had a great time and great service by people at this place but he treated me like I was not important than his job.And he had let me know that he had better things to do than talking with me and listening about my complaining about a hostess's misinformation and her big attitude. I cancelled my reservation first and was going to the Summerlin one. But now I am very glad I came back to this place. I hope I would go back very soon on the day that Kate, Vanessa and Kevin work.

We ordered the pork belly and the cocktail shrimp as apps.  Usually don't go with something as blah cocktail shrimp but it was my girls choice. That was alright, big well cooked shrimp and decent cocktail sauce. Not special but edible. The pork belly which is one of my favorite things in the whole world when prepared correctly was very tender and melt in your mouth. The problem was it had no flavor and the ""chutney"" that it was served with was runny and flavorless. It also came with some sort of flavorless risotto ball I think, did read into the description and don't care cause it was terrible. 
For entrees we both had steaks. I had a prime ribeye, which was supposed to be charred on the outside and finished in the oven. Instead it was burnt on the outside and likely never put in the oven. The filet that my girls had, had no sear and was cold in the middle. Med rare supposed to have warm red center. We also had two Flemings salads which were terrible and flavorless again. Best part of meal by far was the creamed spinach. It was good, just creamed spinach, but good. 
After the utterly lackluster meal we decided to skip dessert and go to the bar to wash the taste out of our mouths with some whiskey. The bartender was very entertaining and served some good bourbon and by far made everything a little palatable. All in all I might have given this place two stars but the price point for the quality did not match up! Would not go again unless to get drinks",SnemO243DdmqwqrAUkZgoA,2,0,2,NueVqU8z8czDgrQvwJ0HuA

From the moment we entered the door, we were treated like royalty. The manager greeted us with a smile and polite conversation, asking us what brings us here tonight so we told him it was our anniversary and he congratulated us and showed genuine interest in why we decided to get married, etc. and told us to let him know if we needed anything while we were there. 

The hostess escorted us to our table and gave us an Anniversary card signed by all the managers. When the server came over she immediately acknowledged our anniversary. The service throughout the evening was impeccable, prompt, courteous and caring.

Managers came by every once in awhile to check on us to see how things we, if we were enjoying ourselves and if we needed anything. 

Now for the food. The artisan bread they bring to the table is fresh and served with 2 different types of butter...a tomato basil blend and what I believe was a brie cheese butter blend. The cheese butter blend was amazing. I had the French Onion Soup which was by far the best I've ever had. We both had the Petite Filet though I added the Diablo Shrimp accompaniment. The Filets were cooked to a perfect pink medium and were very tender. Absolutely delicious. The Diablo Shrimp had a Cajun-esque BBQ sauce on it which was perfect. And the shrimp were big. We also had a side of baked potato and asparagus which were both very good as well. We finished off by sharing a Creme Brulee which was perfectly done and a couple of Cappuccinos which were quite large and tasty.

The atmosphere was very nice, not too noisy at all, so it was very easy to have intimate conversation without struggling to hear each other. We sat in a nice, large booth near the open kitchen which was actually nice as we enjoy watching the cooking shows.

Overall, this was a perfect, romantic evening in every way. I very highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for some fine dining in a classy, yet not ostentatious atmosphere.

I should mention that it is quite expensive but you do get the true 5 star experience and treatment. I recommend buying the Fleming's gift cards at Costco which will save you about $20 for every $100 worth of gift card.",upOyOZM4fj4oxgMYWPHqsA,2,0,5,0g_Dd9IGOa0IY_r-qZ5gcA

We ordered the Valentine's Special for dinner - we both decided on the Filet Mignon and Lobster Tail.  This included a small appetizer and salad.  The steak was okay and the lobster tail was over-cooked and tough.  Our friend had the salmon entree and it was not warm.

1582783,2016-02-09,2,FYqFfaxVRW6pdviONXIoDw,"I wouldn't usually give a restaurant 2 stars because I am a fair minded person who understands mistakes happen and most every owner, manager, and waitstaff wants their patrons to have a good experience. Needless to say, this wasn't our experience with this restaurant.
Here's my story:
We had a birthday celebration which included a party of 5. Two of us had birthdays on the same day so it was a gathering of family and the honoring of two birthday brothers.
Our service was a 2 star evening. My mother, who was with us, would find it hard to even give it 2 stars. She ranted about how bad the service was all weekend. For me, it was terrible to hear because I recommended the restaurant and I felt personally responsible for everyones enjoyment of the evening.
Our waitress, would have been adequate if you were out to dinner at a Chili's or TGI Fridays. She was hardly available to meet the needs of our table. We often needed to flag down a passing waiter or bus boy to grab us soda refills, or other small requests of the table. Making it very frustrating when you are at a higher end restaurant. 
Then our food came to the table. A bone in fillet (special of the evening) that 3 of us ordered with a bunch of side dishes. All was going well until my ""out spoken"" mother commented on the steak being very dry. She referenced it was like eating a burnt hockey puck. After she commented it was like the bubble popped. The other 2, which included myself, also chimed in on how the steak was dry. We all debated on saying something expect for my 75 year old mother. She demanded I say something and have the cook replace the steaks or comp them off the bill. So I hunkered down and spoke up to a passer by to grab the waitress. Once she appeared she was shocked. Commenting that in two years of her being there nobody has ever returned the bone-in filet. This made my asking even worse. I was thinking I shouldn't of spoke up. She then didn't say anything and abruptly walked away getting the manager. LeRoy, the manager, was wonderful! He handled the situation perfectly getting us new steaks that turned out to be delicious! 
My review is definitely not about the dry steaks or how the manager handled it, but how the waitress treated us.
Throughout the entire evening she continued to be non-impressive. When it came to deserts she reference we were her last table before handing us the desert menus. It seemed as if she didn't want us to order anything. Well, we did. Just after receiving the desert she dropped the bill and reminded us we were her last table. Very rude to say the least; we all thought. Usually at a higher end table the bill doesn't come until everyone is done eating and coffee and other items have been served. Well, not with her.
After just a few minutes she reappeared to grab our payment. I hadn't even put my card in the folder yet because we all just started to eat. I was on my second bite. So, I just pulled out my credit card and placed it in the envelop while she stood close by. Meanwhile, my mother commented to her we weren't done eating yet. The waitress didn't even acknowledge her. 
Wait, it gets better! So she returns with the credit card slip and while I signed it we all discussed what tip to leave. After we all pondered a bit we decided to leave a 10% tip. Which was $50.... I wasn't expecting her to come back and grab the slip before we left, but guess what, she did! As she walked away I watched her go back to the kitchen. I was able to watch her face when she opened the envelope as she laughed. Then she walked over to the manager, LeRoy and showed it to him. She began to smile and smirk while I watched her jestures knowing she was referencing how after all that we only left a $50 tip. She then walked back to the kitchen and started speaking to others who in return laughed and carried on......
By now, I'm feeling sick to my stomach with nerves. I'm not the kinda person who enjoys this kind of reaction. I'm always the person who goes over board with a tip or appreciation of the evening. I felt like a teenager who had others talking about me right in front of my face.... Almost like that bullying feeling you had in high school.
So, as we left we starting taking birthday pictures out front of the restaurant. The 5 of us hadn't all been together in awhile so we were all wanting to get that family picture. Well, guess who's shift was over and walking out the front door? Yup, our waitress. Since she walked right past me I said, ""Thank you"". She then proceeded to ignore me like I wasn't there and walked right past me in a fast pace not even acknowledging us. Making the experience even worse! Ugh!

So, in closing, I decided to write this review because of the waitress, not necessarily the food. Just be happy my 75 year old Mother doesn't have the ability to write a review! Oh Vey!",hGv_XkuDFUyjYqF7dXjeHA,4,2,2,sj5NUW6bznByyhDYJRViiQ

We started off with their sweet chili calamari, 2 different types of rib eye for dinner (one dry aged ribeye & one prime bone-in ribeye), tempura lobster, and 3 sides to share (crispy Brussels sprouts, mashed potatoes, and sautéed mushrooms).

Overall, meal did not disappoint. I would recommend coming here as their prices appear to be reasonable.

1613659,2014-04-03,4,FYqFfaxVRW6pdviONXIoDw,"I enjoyed the Yelp event held here and wanted to check them out for our anniversary dinner.  The husband was yet to try their food so I couldn't wait to bring him here.

Located right off of Las Vegas Blvd in Town Square, it's easy to locate and see.  They have plenty of parking with complimentary Valet available for those who choose.  Their dining area is elegant and comfortable.  They keep it very clean and classy.   I love it!

Our waiter for the evening was Tom C.  He was so informative of specials, HH, menu items and their 100 wine by the glass options.  Next time I dine here, I would definitely ask for him!  He really made our anniversary celebration very special!

Oh... you probably want to know about the food right? Complimentary bread basket with the most amazing butter spreads.  Tomato basil and goat cheese goodness! Luckily we stopped at only 1 basket because I could have easily filled up on that alone.  I started with the french onion soup that was divine!  Of course everything is better with cheese... but the herbs and spices used in the soup gave this savory flavor! I had ordered the petit filet and lobster as it was one of their specials.  Petit in their mind was 8 oz.  It was more than I could handle.  But I sure did try to.  It was cooked perfectly flat ironed around the sides for one of the most flavorful and tender filets.  Lobster is always one of my favorites and it was the perfect combination with the filet.  The creamed spinach on the side had fresh shaved parmesan. Like I said, everything is better with cheese!   

Was I full? Yes.  Did we stop there? No. Since it was a special occasion, we spilt the molten lava cake which had two scoops of vanilla ice cream on the side.  The 'molten lava' of chocolate oozing out of the center was almost more than I could handle.   Not to mention the chantilly cream it was topped with.  Fabulous!

It would have been a 5 star but when we made reservations for our Valentines dinner they seated us in a nice quite area but under the HVAC vents that kept blowing on us uncomfortably. It was blowing so hard at times that the flame for my drawn butter kept blowing out. Everyone did their best to take care of the situation. I believe it's a design problem. Caution; do not sit at tables against the walls to the left as you enter the restaurant. I would have given them a 5-star if they had comp'd us a dessert or even offered anything.

Anyways, by far one of the best steakhouses in Vegas. We ordered the Valentine's pre-fixed menu. Both came with appetizer (scallop), salad, and entrée. I had the filet (medium rare) and it was cooked to perfection (melted in my mouth). The filet was paired with a lobster (delish) and a potato casserole. My wife order the filet paired with salmon. I tasted the salmon and it was not good; really strong fishy taste and smell (would not recommend the salmon). The wine list was amazing (by the glass). We didn't have dessert because I had plans for later.

The best part of our experience was meeting our server, Kate. It's wonderful to get to know someone as she had the time to share her life story and we also got to share ours. Thank you Kate for your personal touch and the time spent with us. You made our Valentines dinner extra memorable.

We caught the managers eye and he apologized and took it back. The waitress then came over, apologized and offered another glass of wine. When a new salmon came out, it was perfect. After dessert (the cheesecake is devine) the manager stopped by again to apologize. When the bill came, they had taken the salmon off the bill completely. So not only was this an excellent dining experience overall- this was outstanding customer service. I thought perhaps they might take a drink off the bill - but didn't even ""expect"" that since the problem was promptly addressed - so having her entire dish off the bill was a big surprise.

We requested a quiet table.  We were seated at the very back of the restaurant in a quiet area - just what we wanted. They had a special for the night, a ""Tomahawk"" steak, a bone in ribeye for two for $92. Part of the special is that the chef comes out and carves it at the table. The steak was perfectly prepared, pink in the center as we requested. Since it comes with no sides,we ordered a portion of sauteed mushrooms. Everything was delicious, cooked to perfection. Dessert was the chocolate lava cake which came with 2 small scoops of vanilla ice cream - YUMMY!
The service was also excellent. My water glass never did get lower than halfway down before being refilled.

She had the 8 oz and I had the 12 oz.  we ordered the Black and White peppercorn rub with F17 sauce.  The steaks were cooked perfect and rub was good.  The F17 sauce was more like a BBQ sauce and didn't go will with the steak.  We ordered the peppercorn sauce which is a much better choice.  Overall they are over priced for the over all experience.

I come to flemings because you guys are supposed to be the best in steaks. I had no budget to spend here what so ever dude, just a word of advice from a business owner here, it's the quality that counts, not quantity of people you have in the restaurant. Your way over your head mr manager, fix your delivery and your staff and your process before you cook any more steaks. For your to tell me my steak is medium when it's clearly well done is bull. You lied to me and my wife, this is not our first time at a flemings steak house. Learn how to cook not ok steaks, but great steaks remember you are a STEAKHOUSE! You and your staff ruined our 1 year anniversary dinner. Thanks for the free wine, free dinner for me, free dessert, free gift card, but it does not fix the fact that you can't cook steaks and I spent $300 still. Worst time ever . Don't come here.

We meet up with some friends and at this location since the other steakhouse across the way quoted us a 3 hour wait. When we got there they were very warm and welcoming. The server was great! Her personality and promptness made everything work perfectly. The atmosphere was nice. They had many any wines to choose from. We had one person in our party who was gluten free and allergic to shellfish. We noted that to the server who then informed the chef and everything went wonderfully. Our friend had no issues with allergies at this restaurant. 

What we loved at this restaurant: The Sunday Prime Rib Special! For $42 it comes with a 12oz prime rib, side, salad and dessert! OMG is this for real? Yep! The steak was cook as ordered and was tender to the touch; like satin in your mouth. The sides were large portions and the choices of salad had a good option for everyone. The dessert was great too. It was also a large portion and the yumminess was on point. We had the creme brûlée and chocolate ice cream!

There was a birthday in our party and the restaurant gave the birthday boy a future discount to the restaurant, a box of candle lite truffles from El Salvador and a little card with a birthday greeting. This made the celebration extra surprising and special.

The con: If you order al la cart your bill can get a bit pricey, but if you don't want to spend money on good quality food and service then you probably should not go to here unless it's Sunday!

All and all this restaurant is an A plus plus. On point for service and quality of food. Oh and atmosphere too!

1855595,2014-04-30,2,FYqFfaxVRW6pdviONXIoDw,"Went to Flemings for a friend's birthday. What really sent a red flag off was the waiter's offhand comment that the menu was a ""conventional steak house."" Now don't get me wrong conventional is good in my book, nothing beats the simplicity of meat and potatoes. What's wrong is charging luxury prices for food that simply doesn't warrant such a price tag.

I'm fine eating a $50 Steak, but what makes it worth $50? Is it organic? Grass Fed? A new innovation on the greatest meat to ever grace this earth? Flemings just says it's wet or dry aged, aging beef is a necessity not anything to brag about. I can cook a beautiful steak from Costco for 8 bucks a pound, Flemings is too expensive at that price. My friends ordered it, they enjoyed it, from what I sampled it tasted fine. But $50 fine? No F****** WAY! And the steaks were a la carte too, which is just ridiculous, if you're paying $50 for a steak give the customer a baked potato. The sides (including potatoes) were priced from the $10-$15 range which just stings because now you're certainly paying $60 for your entree. The sides are marketed as ""Family Style"" but it'd only give a nice portion split between 3 people.

I ordered the Fleming's Salad ($10) and their New Zealand Lamb Chops ($20), and I'm simply baffled at what I was served. When I order a ""Steakhouse Salad"" I expect something of large proportions. After all a salad with no protein costs a restaurant practically nothing (and none of their food was labeled GMO-Free or Organic). What I received was a little salad, something that would leave a little girl wanting for more. To add insult to injury the dressing was too sweet for my tastes, no acids besides what the baby tomatoes would give. I was pretty buzzed and wolfed it down anyway. When I ordered Lamb Chops I was alerted by the server that it indeed was a little plate of food, I didn't care because I was not paying $30 for chicken breasts. It was small but decent, unfortunately it was given to me at room temperature meaning it had been sitting while my friends orders were made. Come on guys for twenty bucks you can wrap my little chops with some foil!

The meal wasn't all bad, the wine served was great, and I loved the deserts, all complements to pastry chef. The servers were courteous. But after being buzzed on wine we were given the ultimate rude awakening with our bill, for a party of 6 our total was around $700 (not including tip). Now to be fair we ordered $250 worth of drinks. But still we were NOT given $450 worth of food, no way in hell can steak, potatoes, lamb, and lobster cooked conventionally cost $450. 

Now I know what you might be thinking, well this is Sin City, you gamble and spend a lot here. Well I can take you to ""Mon Ami Gabi"" at Paris and sit outside with a stunning view of the Bellagio Fountains for far less than the price of going to Flemings. I can take you to Bouchon and have the most lovely salad, entree, dessert and wine for roughly $100 a person. 

Flemings was conventional, there was nothing technically wrong with the food. But at the end of the day we were horribly overcharged, their only gift was a $25 gift card (which we sadly couldn't apply to the bill) and a small box of chocolate truffles. 

Unless you have a 50% off coupon do not go to Flemings, it simply is not worth it and there are far better choices in Las Vegas.

1927112,2016-02-28,6,FYqFfaxVRW6pdviONXIoDw,"Dinner was phenomenal tonight. So I've only been to a Fleming's steak house once long time ago and another time recently for HH apps at a YEE event (Where my wife won some gift cards at and ultimately was the deciding factor of where I was spending my bday dinner) any how we loved it. Food, Drinks, Service everything about our experience was great. 

The dinning room is simple elegance kind of like a high end law office looking; but you can't really tell because it's super dark inside. Thank goodness there were lots of Windows. With that said it was nicely lite with dim lighting and the flickering of the tea light candles on each table gave it a cozy romantic ambience.  

At check in the hostess girls are super friendly sat us down and right away placed a Happy Birthday greeting card on our table for my birthday which I thought was a very nice touch. Drink list was displayed on a touch screen tablet which also was very cool, cause you can see pictures read a description and scroll through their choices. I ordered the Clover Club from their Handcrafted Cocktails menu which described it as a Light and citrus drink. Gin based drink with lemon and mint tones and an awesome strong KICK to the face which was very much welcomed. The complimentary bread was a nice size small loaf with just the right amount of cheese baked on top. The cheese spread that the bread came with was freaking F A N T A S T I C! I believe one was champagne Brie and the other one was some pepper smoke something I can't remember but loved it! For an appetizer I got the Beef Carpaccio by the way HH is only offered in the bar like most places but oh well it was worth full price. The beef tenderloin was pounded or slice so thin it was as if it was painted on to the plate. I called it ""Steak Butter"" because you can pretty much scrap the carpaccio and smear it on the amazing crispy garlic cheese crostini. The spicy Creole mustard and capers with thinly julienned greens pushed this dish over the top for me. I'm obsessed and will definitely be back just for that...and during HH it's only $6 an amazing price! 

Of coarse for dinner we ordered the Main Filet Mignons 12oz accompanied with Truffle poach lobster and topped with caviar ($14 extra) and for sides it was a no brainer that we went with the famous Fleming's potatoes and the Chipotle Mac and Cheese. My steak was cooked rare to perfection and my wife's medium rare was not over cooked as well. Mouth watering, juicy and seared just right with very little bleeding these steaks were insanely good. The béarnaise sauce gave it a little something extra for flavor other then that the steaks were season on point to where it did not take away from the steak being the steak. The poach lobster on the other hand I didn't care for much. It had a good texture but a bit salty and not so fresh tasting to me is the best way I can describe that. Also I got a good amount of caviar on mine I think; of coarse if there was more I wouldn't have complain either which I was relieved about because some Yelpers were comparing theirs to the actual pictures advertised online and it didn't compare. I guess I got lucky! 

The potatoes were baked like a lasagna with layers of warm melted cheese in between each soft buttery slice of potato and the chipotle Mac was not too over powering with spiciness either. Great cheesy flavor not too runny and not too thick and the spiral pasta was cook perfectly with the perfect chew. I got the Chocolate lave cake and of coarse with a birthday candle. The cake was so good and had all the perfect component to make this cake to die. The melted chocolate lava in side which spewed out was warm and yummy not too sweet. The ice cream the cookie and the whip cream that came with it made this dessert a perfect ending to a perfect dinner. 

 Anyway long story long I am a huge fan and will come back again and again, can't wait to try their Sunday brunch. If you haven't been here, What are you waiting for?!?!",YLeDSZ1Nh1N0hNsSyQdE3A,10,6,5,-IDy5lkHR1z7wu-PLyJcYw

We wanted to try it out since it is newly opened and we are huge fans of the location being Las Vegas locals. The food we ordered was exquisite, in particular our Alaskan King Crab Legs and our dry aged Ribeye.  What is so beautiful about Flemings at Town Square is we can get the high quality food we enjoy without the hastle of the Strip car traffic and foot traffic at the casinos!! What truly made our experience was our server Tom, who carried himself with a professionalism and elegance you expect at fine dining restaurants. He treated us as though our time and money was of value and not just like we were another table during his work night.  Thank you Flemings for such a great evening....my wife and I will return and definitely request Tom!",-6AwCNR846AReS70O5l_Fg,0,1,5,goXISgf2Bojk9MHU2_fv8g

We each ordered a glass of wine and a few tapas plates. Prices here are super reasonable for what you get and they even have a small happy hour in the bar. Service was on point and the food was delicious.

There's a huge parking lot so I'm sure you'll never have issues finding parking if you don't mind a little. The only wish I have is that we had more time to spend here. I've wanted to go to Fleming's for quite a while and I'm looking forward to the next time we'll be back in the area to enjoy it yet again.

2049765,2017-03-03,0,FYqFfaxVRW6pdviONXIoDw,"No words...absolutely the best food. French onion soup, bread, and pork chop!

The sourdough brought to the table was warm and golden; perfectly crisp crust and sponge like middle. The butter served with the bread is a whip with chardonnay and cheese...devine!

The french onion soup was classically delicious. Wonderful beefy onion broth topped with a crouton, provolone and browned to a decadent ooze.  

The pork chop...just wow! Never have I had such a juicy chop that melted in your mouth. The bed of apple/pear slaw it was served on was the perfect crunch to the melt in your mouth pork.

The chef is simply amazing!  Cannot say enough good about the food and atmosphere.

It's not too far from the strip and located in a decent neighborhood.

If you sign up for their club you'll receive a discounted meal or free... 

Once in a while they'll send out deals, which make it worth visiting.

I came across  Flemings a couple months ago as I was surfing the food porn pages of yelp,as you do. ;). My husbands birthday was coming up and he loves steak, so light bulbs went off and I thought itd be a perfect special bday dinner spot for him. So I bookmarked it and i started buying a gift card from their website every paycheck for a couple months and I made a reservation and tried (and failed lol) to keep it a surprise until tonight. He loved it! This is the fanciest place I have ever dined at and they made us feel so special from the very first moment. We showed up a little early in hopes of getting a booth, we were seated in minutes, early.  They knew it was his bday because I put it in the reservation and so many people said happy bday to him, the manager even came over and introduced himself,shook our hands,joked around with us and thanked us for spending Geoffs bday with them. Hands down the best service I've ever experienced anywhere ever. We had the tenderloin  carpoccio  for an appetizer, it was really yummy, I had a wedge salad that was so amazing. The best blue cheese I've ever tasted.i destroyed it so fast I forgot to take a picture. it was my favorite of the night (weird I know lol, I like salad,what can I say?).   I got the lobster tempura, it was really good and my husband got a dry aged ribeye with the lobster and caviar on top and we got the truffle mash potatoes and the Flemings potatoes. so much food lol! Everything was so bomb. I am so full lol. To top it all off they gave Geoff a box of beautiful chocolate truffles and a 25 dollar gift card for our next visit as a bday present!! Who does that?!? Really special. Honestly above and beyond in service and hospitality. We cannot wait to go back. Thank you so much Flemings!

We were a little early so decided to take advantage of the happy hour prices in the bar for a few cocktails. We both ordered Blueberry lemon drops. Which I highly recommend. Yum. 
The room has the modern steakhouse feel very nice. After we were seated we were greeted by our server Luz. Right away we ordered the crab cakes my husband enjoyed them I did not think by any means they should have been 20.00 they just weren't that good. 
The bread was too good the flavored butters yum. We enjoyed the bread.
We found on the back of the menu they were offering a great special for 64.00 you get apps which was an empanada,and a salad. I had the wedge it was steakhouse salad perfection cold crisp with bacon crumbles and blue cheese. Husband had the Caesar said it was very good. We each got the lobster tail and filet. We both wanted medium to medium well perfectly pink perfectly cooked. Just because we don't want rare doesn't mean we want it ruined. A very nice surprise was the Flemmings potatoes sooo good they were not part of the special but they are sooooo worth ordering delicious.
Our glasses were constantly filled. I can't say enough about Luz she was lovely and you could tell she was trying to make sure we would have a perfect evening. 
As Luz was making a pass by to ask if everything was good she noticed my husbands filet was smaller than mine and missing the bone that mine had. She fixed our check to reflect the smaller filet.  We could not finish and boxed up the leftovers. A lovely box of truffles and a gift card were given with our check. We enjoyed our dinner and will certainly be back, we will also ask to be seated in Luz section, she was the type of server you expect in an upscale steakhouse.

We enjoyed the beautiful outdoor seating area although, it get loud at times due to the close proximity to the airport. We didn't mind though, it was kind of fun watching the planes land and take off. Flemings has great happy hour specials with food and drink specials starting at $6 everyday from 5-7pm. My friends and I brought our own bottles of champagne for which they charge a $20 fee for corking per bottle which is reasonable for a nice restaurant in Vegas. The happy hour burger was absolutely delicious with Gruyere cheese and served with a side of well seasoned french fries...definitely a 5/5. My friend had the mushroom ravioli which she enjoyed as well and gave it a 5/5. 

We were a little disappointed with the service which was 3/5. Our server forgot an appetizer we had ordered and upon inquiring about it she immediately blamed us for not even placing the order when all of us at the table heard her confirm the order back to us when we initially placed it. She later came and apologized telling us she couldn't read her own handwriting. There were many times through the night that we had to pour our own drinks and an ice bucket for our champagne was brought to the table after we were done with 3/4 of the bottle.

The special also included as much bread with the spreads as we wanted and desert too.  I ordered the chocolate lava cake and was impressed.

The drinks were generous (good pours of wine and stronger cocktails) and were reasonable.

The service was fantastic.  Our server Morgan took great care of us and didn't rush us along.  She was attentive without being intrusive.  Our dinner experience took about 2.5 hours and we thoroughly enjoyed it.  We will definitely be back.

As for those stating that Flemings is expensive . . . .it can be, but it depends on what you order.  The prime rib special is usually on Sundays only.  They do have loyalty programs which help on the cost.  I understand that there are discount gift cards at Costco from time to time as well.  And, they also have a special lower cost menu if you want to dine at the bar.  However, if you do dine at the bar, you're going to miss out on the excellent service from a server such as Morgan.

Been here twice already. One time for an Elite Event and another time my special someone took me here for my birthday dinner.

Service here so far has been top-notch. Our waiter was very enthusiastic while letting us know their current specials and his personal recommendations. When we had questions about how the steaks were prepared (dry aged versus wet aged) or the differences between the types of wines my significant other was looking at, the waiter showed genuine interest with his answers.

APPETIZERS
-FRENCH QUARTER BBQ SHRIMP: packed full of flavor. Big and juicy shrimps marinated in garlic and spices.
-THE BIG WEDGE: my SO is a big wedged salad fan. Blue cheese dressing with bacon bits. He enjoyed it.

ENTREES
-He ordered the PEPPERCORN STEAK. Prime new york strip, cracked black and white peppercorns, F17 steak sauce, french green beans.
-I ordered the wet aged PRIME NEW YORK STRIP. Well done please...lol. Even with my steak well done, it was not dried at all. My New York Strip had so much flavoring, I did not need any steak sauce.
Overall, we both really enjoyed our dishes.

SIDES
FLEMING'S POTATOES. Their infamous specialty. Sliced potatoes with jalapeños and cheddar cheese. THAT was freakin delicious!!!!! Whoever is a big fan of potatoes, this is A MUST!!!!


We will definitely be back. Every so often, if you sign up for their email promotions....they have some great deals going on.",9ks-80ZxeCZWNObzEbW4-Q,2,2,5,Iyu5QajS9TyxNxYsAwCO6Q

We were able to sit in the bar area and enjoy a great meal. I had the wagyu New York strip and my girl had the filet and lobster.  Both steaks were cooked perfectly with the potatoes on the side it was the perfect meal. I couldn't have asked for anything more. I waiter seemed a bit nervous but he was great as well.,QRN7jpfaG0oAfHn0GpyAYw,1,1,5,RIDjLEFbFMxYsSkXUGQAnQ
2640097,2016-03-01,2,FYqFfaxVRW6pdviONXIoDw,"This was delicious! I had the shrimp and scallops on a bed of squash noodles and everyone else had steak.

The atmosphere is really nice, room is dark-ish with low lighting and very clean. Bread is provided for you with 2 amazing spreads of Brie. 

The portions are large and enough to share with other people. Prices are a bit on the pricier end- a side of double cut fries are $9.50 and a t-bone steak was something like 50-60 but oh so worth it.

All in all- I would recommend this steakhouse as the service was great, food was delicious and wait time was no time at all on Monday!",rqb5abV146wcU-Z7JxfEIQ,2,2,4,GlUdXYO8tuCuWIyLuqHjqg

Everything was good except the Prime Rib and the sometimes  service. No matter how you ordered it, well to medium rare, you got the same old piece of GRAY meat with zero taste. We had to ask the server, there were several helping the table to bring knives after they had been removed from the salad and Prime Rib was delivered, we had to ask for the 3 dipping sauces to be sent to the table and it's a small thing but when the server set down the chilled fork for the salad he set it upside down with tines toward the guest.

Family, hubby, and I had a myriad of appetizers, soup, salads, entrees, and desserts. I don't know where to begin!

Hubby had the Prime Rib dinner available on Sundays. It comes with salad/soup, prime rib entree, a side dish, and a dessert. All for $41! Cannot beat that!  

Mom and I shared their summer pre fixed three course meal that includes a caprese salad, 14oz filet mignon, lobster and crab, and dessert. All for $59! We had a side of French onion soup and the Flemings salad that was flavorful and fresh. 

Everything was delicious! Great quality! 

The one dessert that is a must is their chocolate molten lava cake! Served with a side of vanilla ice cream. Compliments each other very well!

2656946,2017-02-14,3,FYqFfaxVRW6pdviONXIoDw,"We came here for an early Valentine's Day dinner. It's located in Town Square next to the Container Store! You can walk in or make a reservation. 

Service: the service here is amazing. The hosts in the front were great. Always looking for more open spots, fun, and very nice! The manager was nice enough to apologize and give us huge shrimp just for the wait time. We had to wait 45 minutes to get sat but that's understandable. It's the day before Valentine's Day! I thought that was a really nice gesture. Our server was TJ and he was great. He was fun and made great recommendations! 

Food: to start off, we got the French onion soup, roasted portobello mushroom ravioli, and the shrimp and sea scallops. The French onion soup was probably the best I've ever had. I could drown in it and be happy. The mushroom ravioli was a good 7 out of 10. It was delicious but feel like it had an odd taste to it. The shrimp and sea scallops was incredible. The sauce it comes with made the entire dish! We both got steak! I got the certified angus beef ribeye with a porcini mushroom rub on it and the truffle poached lobster and chris got the prime dry aged ribeye with a side of the flemings potatoes. My steak was incredibly juicy and had amazing flavor to it. The dry aged had more of a char tasted to it which I also love very much. The poached lobster was phenomenal. It had caviar on it and it was so full of flavor! For the dessert, we got the crème brûlée. By far the best crème brûlée I've ever had. It came with a massive amount of whipped cream on the side and had raspberries, strawberries, and blueberries on top. It was a light dessert. 

I really enjoyed my time here and the food was really good! I'll definitely come back here again!",Nhk0jTP2gkU12G4LHJVR3A,11,9,4,4cI8r_yCucXKqK9L4G83Zw

Happy hour specials were good, my boyfriend and I enjoyed some of the drinks before our dinner as well as the pork belly appetizer. We had high hopes for it (as avid pork belly lovers) but weren't impressed. Nor were disappointed. Bf and I agreed that it reminded us of a tasteless thanksgiving mini dish. 
Service was excellent and it was nice that the manager made it a point to stop by and say hi. I got the Sunday night prime rib which was tasty but again nothing extravagant. What really made me sad was the taste of lobster that was very fishy. Fresh seafood isn't usually distinctly fishy. 
Dessert was very delicious. I used to make my own lava cake all the time and this was perfectly done. The best part was the side of home made whipped cream. Absolutely delicious. 
Overall our dinner was good but I think we expected just a bit more.",N81pyppaZwPSYc1uVsCfhw,0,0,3,e6L6bH5M5gRrGE37YdLrZA

Mother's Day Brunch was VERY disappointing.

Service:  My wife and I and 3 yr old were seated promptly.   After sometime, water was served (two glasses).   The server offered to bring a kid's cup with a lid for our daughter.  We waited and waited and finally they served complimentary biscuits but still no 3rd water for our little girl.   So I asked the person who brought out the biscuits if we could have another water brought out as well as additional napkins and he said, ""Yes, right away.""   Once again, the waiting continued and that 2nd server never came back with napkins or water.  (One of our white tablecloth napkins had old black stains on them.  Don't reuse these if you can't get rid of a stain.  Please just throw them away)

Finally, we asked a 3rd server for an extra water and some napkins which we finally got (except they did not have any kid's cup apparently so just another glass of water.)


Food:  The complimentary biscuits came out BURNT on the bottom.  My wife also said they didn't have a good taste at all.  I used the pretty good apricot jam to mask the burnt taste and managed to eat a few of them.  

Our appetizers were probably the highlights of our meal (downhill from there).  We had the modern caesar salad which was fine and the lobster bisque.  The bisque soup base was more watery than we're used to but the added lobster meat inside saved the dish for me.  

Side dishes of whole carrots and potatoes were served.  The potatoes were fine.  The carrots were a mix of undercooked and overcooked.  Some were still crunchy when bit while others were soft as mush when you placed it in your mouth.  No consistency.  

For our brunch entrees, the wife ordered the baked Brioche French Toast and I had the Prime Rib.

French Toast- NOTHING like the picture on their advertisements/website/gift card.  (Photo comparison below)
 ""layered in vanilla and orange custard, with a brown sugar, butter and walnut streusel, served with maple-blueberry syrup, Chantilly cream and grilled sausage""
What really came out was some french toast, a dab of whipped cream, TWO pieces of blue berries.  What is this?? It also tasted only as good as it looked.

My prime rib was cooked the way I liked it (medium rare) but no where near the best tasting.  I had to salt it well for flavor.  The three sauces that accompanied the meat were bland.  There was no strong kick to the horseradish, the au jus was okay, the pepper cream sauce was good.

Finally dessert.  The turtle pie must have been frozen or old.  Either way, cutting it with a fork was nearly impossible.  It was hard like a rock.   The blueberry cheesecake was below-average for a dessert as well.  My wife and kid usually can finish all the sweets at the end of a meal, so you know there's a problem when we left with more than half of the dessert untouched.",Mho2GibREwsPesKEyQbt8w,7,4,3,q8jUl1Bjeg6jqE7ZjfsRvA
2691837,2017-01-26,0,FYqFfaxVRW6pdviONXIoDw,"Celebrated my husband's birthday with some friends and we all enjoyed the food.  Although we were in Vegas for vacation, we decided to have a low-key dinner off the Strip and this was perfect.  We made same day reservations on Open Table, parking was easy, and we were seated almost immediately.  There was a lot of variety on the menu, so it took me a while to figure out what I wanted.  We each had either french onion soup or salad to start, filet or ribeye for the entree.  We ordered creamed spinach and brussel sprouts as the shareable sides, and these were a great complement to our steaks.  I had the creme brulee for dessert and it was big enough to share!  

One issue I had was that the bar area is not really enclosed, so the cheers and jeers from the live sports on tv can be heard in the main dining area.  It was also difficult to hear our server.  I'm not sure if it was because she was soft-spoken or because of the noise from the bar... probably a combination of both.

My husband received a signed birthday card, truffles and $$ gift card for a future visit. That was a nice touch, and we will likely utilize that gift card closer to home.",TVArap00OB9lOozVQdBH1A,2,0,4,-mj4eGF7YF7Ob_tf48QMRw

Kate went the extra mile and after we had already ordered a dessert, brought out a wrapped box of truffles with a candle stuck to the top of it. She was literally amazing. 
The food--our steaks were prepared expertly. The sautéed mushrooms could turn a mushroom hater into a lover in an instant. And the Flemings potatoes were a special blend of sin and love.

Deserts were wonderful.  But overall it does not measure up to other Flemings we have been to in other states in food or ambiance...not even as good as the other one here which is not my choice due to lack of ambiance and to brightly lit which this one was properly lit for dinner.

After reviewing the menu, I decided to try the Dry Aged Prime Rib Eye ($53) and add the King Crab Meat with Caviar on top. When the steak arrived, the first thing I noticed was how disappointing the amount of crab and caviar on top was. From the photos I saw posted by the restaurant, I was expecting a little more meat & caviar. See comparison photo below. As far as the steak goes, I ordered it Medium Rare and was cook perfectly. However, the steak was slightly tough in certain cuts and I felt like this was not a Prime piece of rib-eye. Having just ate at Smith & Wollensky's just last week, I could definitely tell S&W's steaks were far superior to Flemings as far as rib-eye steaks goes. We also ordered the mushrooms & asparagus.

As soon as I walked in, I was greeted by upbeat and helpful employees that quickly helped me find my friend whom I was meeting there. After taking a seat, I did not have to wait long at all before another well put together and positive attitude employee (Jessica Saitta) had myself and my drink order taken care of. 

Jessica continued to help us throughout the night and provided what was BY FAR the best experience I've had at any Fleming's as well as the majority of any other dining experiences I've had. She was very attentive and truly a genuine person. She always was able to carry a fun conversation every time she checked in with us.

I got there just after happy hour started and it was a little hard to park. The place was pretty packed. I got in and found my party. The tables were set nicely with plates and ice water, well regular water. The ice had mostly melted by the time I got there. It was pretty warm. I was surprised they didn't have misters going. It looked like they had them. I started by order the blueberry lemon drop which was delicious! I was very impressed with the presentation. I ordered a few more of those and split a burger from the happy hour menu too. It was actually really good. It came with fries that were seasoned just enough.  We each ordered something a little different. Someone next to me order the burrata, which was great! They also order the calamari and carpaccio which was also good. The only issue we had was finding our waitress to order and when we did it took a while to get things. We had to ask for ranch twice but I understand they are busy.

2948348,2015-03-24,0,FYqFfaxVRW6pdviONXIoDw,"My husband and I celebrated our 40th Anniversary with a intimate dinner at Flemings.  We were greeted immediately and congratulated on our anniversary.  Service was very good and friendly. Impressive wine list. The dining room lighting was a little too dark for my eyes.

 My husband had the Short Ribs and I had the Salmon. Food was good.  But honestly, for the prices charged, I expected to be ""wowed"".
As we were having dinner, we heard the clanging of pans from the kitchen even though we were seated in the farthest booth from the kitchen.  Being a music lover, I strained to listen for pleasant melodic sounds, but alas I could only hear cling-clanging from the open kitchen and the faint sound of a sports TV in the bar area.  I thought with all the emphasis on high end service, product,  and atmosphere, there still existed coldness, a disconnect from a sense of warmth and romantism.  It really needed the soft and soothing sounds of music. Not clanging pots and pans.

 We did not have any dessert. As a nice gesture, in celebrating of anniversary we were given a box of chocolate truffles and an invitation to come back to Flemings with a $25.00 gift card.
Honestly I don't believe that we would ever return to Flemings.  So many of these higher end restaurant chains have completely disregarded the total entertaining experience. You're in the business of creating a memorable experience , however; there is a lack of warmth, a softness, a sense of romance that music would provide.

The facility is what you'd expect for a upper end steak house.  Bit dark, quiet, fairly fancy and clean.  There was plenty of parking in the area and the restroom was spotless.

The service was friendly but not incredibly competent.  A couple of our requests got botched.  Not a huge deal, but I wasn't impressed.

The food was good, but not outstanding.  My filet was dry and uninspired.  For the price, I'd expect better.  My favorite part of the meal was the blue cheese salad (and that's not saying much for this price range).

Overall, it's an OK place.  I would eat there again but wouldn't go out of my way to do so.

The New Wedge Salad is topped with grape tomatoes, crispy onions, caramelized bacon, bleu cheese, pepitas, and bleu cheese dressing. It was nicely presented but would be easier to eat with the bacon and bleu cheese crumbled. The flavors work well together for a perfectly sized dinner salad. Rating: 4/5

Dry-aged Prime Ribeye is aged a minimum of 21 days and seasoned with kosher salt, black pepper, and finished with butter and parsley. The steak was tender, succulent, and sliced like butter. It was perfectly broiled to black and blue doneness with nice char on the outside and cool dark red interior. It could be seasoned a bit more with salt and more melted butter on top. Rating: 4.5/5

Prime Bone-In Ribeye is aged a minimum of 21 days and seasoned with kosher salt, black pepper, and finished with butter and parsley. The steak was perfectly broiled to medium-rare doneness. It was also tender and succulent with tastier meat near the bone. This was also under seasoned and could use more salt and butter. Rating: 4/5

Truffle-Parsley Mashed Potatoes tasted like homemade mashed with small lumps inside. The truffle could be more flavor forward. The texture was a little granular and could be a little creamier. Rating: 3/5

Creamed Spinach was creamy and silky and works well with steak or prime rib. The parmesan on top added an aged, tangy flavor to the mix. Rating: 4.5/5",aGUZKSRPA-MHHj6b8GhOww,2,2,4,AIf2e-mWLi_Cc51IKGiESQ

3153948,2014-09-14,0,FYqFfaxVRW6pdviONXIoDw,"We had a late dinner here last night and both the meal and service were exceptional. I ordered the mushroom ravioli and meatballs off the bar menu, while my date ordered a dry aged steak with a side of king crab and house potatoes. We also had two drinks - a blueberry lemon drop martini and their fruit stand lemonade. Lastly, we shared an amazing lava cake for dessert.

The outdoor seating area was empty so we opted to sit out there. Our waitress was attentive, fun, and very sweet. And literally every item we ordered was a joy to eat or drink. The food kept our bellies satiated while the drinks kept us silly and happy throughout our dinner.

My only negative was that we will probably never eat outdoors again due to the heavy layer of smoke in the air. I was starting to get a cough yesterday and today it is much worse, so I'm sure last night's not-so-fresh air had something to do with it. I would have given a 4.5 rating if possible because of this.

Aside from that, we had an excellent experience. Our bill was about $150, which sounds right considering how much we ordered. An additional $30 was also added for the great service. Given the $180 total spent, we probably would not come back for dinner often... but I definitely hope to stop in again soon to try their $6 bar specials!",k8okFWX0acPR8c4L7XM55A,1,0,5,nrM0BdOTLAO3yBM6I0Nn0g

They never say no-even if you show with no reservations which I often dare to do. They will accommodate you. Secondly, this place has never once missed with one of their perfectly cooked steaks and I probably have been there 12 to 15 times in the last two years. Third the location is perfect. If your not into the pushing and hotel scene of waiting then this place is just far away but close enough from anywhere in the valley with easy parking. You can easily go shopping or to the movies after dinner. Anyone that complains about this place is full of it and themselves. I welcome them to show me better and or compare.

Last time we were seated in the restaurant we were sat at the booth near the kitchen entrance. With many servers and management walking by we waited 25 minutes before we stood up to leave. We complained to the Hostess and she had the assistant manager come over. he ended up giving a $100 comp if we returned. I find that the Manager is always present and walking around but he fails to notice the customers who have not been served and is always talking with other diners or so called regulars. He thinks he is doing his job but he fails to realize building a stronger customer base is more important for the Flemings brand. Absurd. By the way we walked out again this evening and felt complaining to the Management would be a waste of time with this General Manager.,GFjiCgL0JUp5A48Q4T6hsw,0,0,1,UYgiYr51JOpcWGqWlfKPFA

I made the reservations online and was able to get a reservation with no problem at all. They had a section to fill out if you were celebrating anything special, I put down Anniversary but didn't expect anything since many places ask this but nothing ever really happens.
Upon arrival, we gave our names and the hostess wished us a Happy Anniversary and had us seated within minutes. On the table was an Anniversary card signed by the stuff. Nice touch!
Loved the ambience of this place: dim lights, soft jazz playing in the background, very clean, and friendly staff. 
Our waiter, Eduardo, came over and gave us our menus and wished us a Happy Anniversary as well. He gave us ample time to decide what we wanted to order. We decided on ordering the crab cakes, miso glazed Chilean sea bass, bone in prime rib eye, and Fleming's potatoes. He brought out fresh French bread with some smoked cheddar and champagne Brie. Both cheese selections were delicious but I did enjoy the Brie a tad bit more. 

Crab cakes were then brought out and they were served with a roasted red pepper sauce. It was absolutely delicious. The crab cakes were cooked perfectly, with a crispy outer layer and a moist center. The flavor was great and the sauce added a nice tangy, spiced flavor to it. 

Eduardo then brought out the entrees and the Fleming's potatoes. We were impressed with the size of the steak and the presentation of the Chilean sea bass. The potatoes were to die for and my husband, who normally doesn't eat sides, are a good chunk of it. The rib eye was phenomenal, we ordered it medium rare and this was the first steakhouse in Vegas that actually got it right! The knife cut through it smoothly and the meat melted in our mouths. The Chilean sea bass was exquisite and the miso glaze with the spinach and mandarin oranges added such great flavor to the fish. 

We ordered their chocolate lava cake for dessert and we were delighted with the size and presentation. The lava cake was delicious and perfectly gooey. It was served with vanilla ice cream, pistachios, and a delicious cookie. We were also given a generous serving of whipped cream for it and it was delectable. 

At the end of our meal, we were given a box of truffles as a gift from the restaurant for our anniversary. It was such a nice gesture and we truly appreciated it.

They have a great HH menu that includes 5 cocktails (all $6 ea), 5 wines (again $6 ea) and 5 food treats for....guess....$6 bucks each!

We sampled the mushroom ravioli....definitely the BEST one of all the ones we tried. Would absolutely order it again, and WILL come back again specifically for that.
The calamari was good. I didn't try the carpacchio (I can't eat raw meat). The baked brie was very good. It came with sliced apples, walnuts and some lettuce. We also got the pork belly and I enjoyed that quite a bit. I've had pork belly before and didn't care for it so I was skeptical about it. It was accompanied with cheesey garlicky polenta and a delish cranberry (?) compote. That dish was very nice, my second favorite. We also ordered 2 burgers (once again $6 ea). The burgers come with your choice of cheese, bacon, lettuce, tomato and lots of french fries. 

Our server was Stephanie, and she is originally from Paris, so I liked her immediately. She was friendly and attentive without being overbearing. I told her manager as I was leaving that she was great. It's nice to get great service, and it's also nice when customers acknowledge that to management. (they always get complaints!)

I didn't order drinks but my friends did and enjoyed them. They had the manhattan, but it's not called that. They had a lemonade that I will try next time!

Happy hour alone is pretty bomb! I will come back for that again, no doubt. I will also come for a sit down dinner and I enjoyed the food both times I've been here now.

Great service (always makes a meal so much better), great food (we were SO full when we left), awesome pricing and just fantastic company made this a wonderful night out!

We were presented with a bowl of house made chips and the HH menu.  I placed an orde5r for a Moscow Mule right away.  The HH menu is pretty straight forward.   5 for $6 til 7pm.  5 types of cocktail, 5 types of wine by the glass, and 5 types of appetizers, each selection for $6.  

For under $50, Earl and I had:
-3 Moscow Mules: Perfect balance of vodka, ginger beer, and everything else that made it so delicious.  After 1/2 of this drink, I was buzzed.  
-1 Dirty Martini:  Earl chose this drink.  I smelled it and handed it back to Earl.  Pretty strong.
-Tenderloin Carpaccio:  A full plate thinly sliced tenderloin, topped with sliced spinach, paired with the creole mustard sauce, capers, and cheesy crostini.  I really enjoyed this dish.
-Pan-crisp Pork Belly:  The pork belly was served with goat cheese grits and sweet onion chutney.  It was overall a good appetizer.  I wish there was something, like pickled something to cut the richness of the dish.

3604128,2016-07-07,5,FYqFfaxVRW6pdviONXIoDw,"Decided to give Fleming's a try for the first time on our anniversary. The food was pretty good but the service left something to be desired.

We had put on our reservation on Open Table that we were having an anniversary dinner. The hostess was sweet and wished us a happy anniversary as did the rest of the wait staff. They also printed us a nice Happy Anniversary card as well. Nice little touches.  I had high hopes at this point. 

The waitress though nice wasn't overly friendly and didn't seem to like the fact that she had to work on July 4th, even making a comment that while everyone is outside barbecuing and having a good time, she's stuck inside. Not usually a comment you want to make to your customers. Also seemed like every time we were needing her attention or her services she wasn't anywhere to be found. It took us about 40 minutes to get our bread and butter and 30 minutes to get our salad. The whole service of food wasn't very smooth. The salad came out first and the bread and butter we were promised at the time of seating didn't come out to us until we reminded them that we never got any, though the table behind us that sat after us got their bed prior to us. Then after our salads were cleared we still had to wait another 20 minutes for our main courses. The wine manager had come by at the beginning of the dinner to offer the wines on special that were 50% off. He over-poured my sample glass and left red wine everywhere including on the glass itself. Instead of offering to wipe the glass or change the linens he simply walked away after pouring us our samples. It was a little scary trying the wine with my pure white dress on so I sipped it gingerly over the soiled linens. We also had an issue with the table wobbling, not just a slight wobble but a wobble that shook the whole table and the wine glasses with the slightest touch.  The waitress said she'd have someone fix it but no one ever came around. We decided to make an executive decision to switch to the other side of the table that seemed to wobble a little less. 

Finally for the food, the steak was good and cooked to the right temperature.  The peppercorn sauce, which was complimentary, was not very flavorful and tasted more like an au jus vs a peppercorn sauce. I did, however, enjoy the mac & cheese and Thai green beans along with the crab legs that I ordered. 

To end the meal the waitress did bring by a $25 gift card for future use and a box of truffle chocolates for our anniversary. Another nice touch but having started the dinner a little rough, it was hard to be overly excited. Honestly the best service we got was from the food runners, those guys were friendly and helpful, maybe they need a promotion. Will I be back? Hmmmm... we'll see but if I'm going to spend $50 on a steak I might as well go to Ruth's Chris or Smith and Wollensky's.",ga_05brEylDLIabc3lZOgA,7,3,3,VvH_bDTVzl1EQTouYvDNAw

There were 7 of us and I think we all got steak . My large filet was great . My friends all loved theirs too . Mac and cheese was delicious . The service was great and I can't think of one thing wrong with the service. I was given a birthday card from the staff and some chocolates too . Overall a great experience from a chain upscale steakhouse . Consistency is key and they are superb in this manner .,PemAGpIKTHpBVRaRkDwJKQ,0,0,5,Tp1rTue8oSClQeF6xVd4cA

Our server also was very knowledgeable about the menu and gave us great suggestions! I give 5 stars to the appetizers, the entrees and the dessert! They made my husband's birthday extra special by giving him a signed card from the staff and complimentary chocolate truffles. The operating partner of the restaurant LeRoy was a very delightful gentleman as well. He personally came to our table and talked with us for 10 minutes, wished my husband a happy birthday and thanked us for choosing his restaurant to celebrate. If I had an option to give them 10 stars believe me I would. I am from LA and I have been to almost every 5 star restaurant in Beverly Hills, definitely this restaurant tops them all.

For dessert, I had the creme brulee, which had a nice, thin, crisply layer on top with the gooey middle underneath.  Heavenly!

I didn't fall for it. They have a host who checks on tables after you're done eating to ask how service was. We were not approached. Maybe cause we're under 30. Maybe cause my husband is brown.

We had a glass of Chardonnay and the Blackberry Bramble. Really tasty and a stiff drink that was sweetened by the muddled blackberries. 

I ordered their surf and turf special which includes a scallop appetizer, a wedge salad, and an 8 oz filet and 8 oz lobster tail. The wedge salad was huge and could easily serve two people. The filet and lobster were very tender and tasty.

He ordered the prime rib dinner special which includes a salad, prime rib, a side dish and dessert. He had the Caesar salad as his appetizer. I tried a bite and it was very good. His prime rib came with three dipping sauces and for his side dish he ordered the Fleming's potatoes. The prime rib was very tender and the potatoes were a great accompaniment to the dinner.

I decided to go with one of the specials- the 5 oz prosciutto wrapped filet with sea scallops and asparagus.  The first steak brought out was well done, but the manager quickly had the kitchen prepare a new medium rare filet for me.  This one was cooked perfectly.  The scallops and asparagus that accompanied the steak were also very good.

The BF ordered the Dry Aged NY Strip, flat ironed.  He said it was fantastic and that the flat iron cook gave his steak a perfect crispy exterior with a tender and juicy middle.  Very flavorful.

We also ordered a couple of side.  The Fleming's potatoes are a layered scalloped potato dish that resembles a potato lasagna.  They are a must order (just pretend they are carb free).  The creamed spinach is fine.  Nothing special.",Dgk0Wdoh7HPjhKQEPBU_jQ,4,3,4,9TU9254FGluFWXAvo93WfQ

I am happy to report that the Town Square location has 4-5x the bar seating.  hh offerings consist of wine or mixed drinks and a handful of dishes plus the Fleming's burger @ $6/each.  Our personal favorite hh dish is the baked brie that comes baked in a croissant with granny smith apples and honey glazed walnuts.

I initially was coming here to meet a few business colleagues for dinner.  Two of us had gotten here early just in time for happy hour.  I went to the bar area and had a blueberry lemon drop.  It was amazing and the bartenders were very attentive and immediately gave us water.

We eventually were seated twenty minutes later to a booth with our other party of two making four of us total.  It had taken almost twenty minutes to get our order in and we finally had to wave someone down to take our order.  Kevin, the manager immediately took the order and then our initial server came back into the picture.  I had ordered an iced tea and it somehow got forgotten.  One of my associates again had to go to the front and remind them we still needed refills and my iced tea was forgotten.  The meals were pretty good for the most part, but it seemed as if there was many delays due to lack of chefs or help in general.

At the end of the meal, Kevin, the manager surprised us all with a dessert tray sampler and said it was compliments of the house because of the miscommunications.  He also gave us gift cards to come back and give them another chance.  Very class act and very unexpected.  I normally wouldn't have thought two cents about the whole situation because life happens...however, Kevin made it a point to make sure we were satisfied and apologized profusely.  The dessert was delicious by the way.  You have to try the molten lava chocolate cake!  Will definitely be back not only for the way things were handled, but because happy hour is a good deal and dessert was delicious!",u90s9wJ9pMK2FMpy5F8Wpg,2,3,5,ebKk-pd1cjdu8UhA1DGv5g

The prime rib did not disappoint either - tender, perfect medium.  The complimentary bread filled me up too much though and I had to bring more than half of my meal home along with my included dessert, I chose the creme brulee and had a wonderful treat later that night.

The price went up a buck to $7, but it's still a great deal.  I also tried their $6 pork belly happy hour plate, and that was also really good.

But it was the staff that did it for me.  Diana behind the bar, and Ashley too, were very friendly.  When I didn't order a drink I didn't get the ol' bartender eye roll.  And when her POS locked up when I tried to pay, Diana apologized profusely and even brought me some truffles for my wait.  Totally unnecessary, but it show you that management has the staff put customers first here.

I had reservations and noted to them that it was his birthday. We arrived 10 minutes early and were informed our table wasnt quite ready and were seated at the bar to wait. 30 minutes later we were finally seated. Another 10 minutes later we were finally acknowledged. As i looked around i noticed another table was celebrating a birthday and had received a box of truffles with a candle in it. Nice touch! Ordered our meal. I got the filet and my bf ordered swordfish. Our meals came. The filet was medium well instead of medium and was still ok, but not as I had ordered. The swordfish was so tasteless and bland that my boyfriend took two bites and left it. We shared my over done steak. The waitress never checked on us until my plate was cleared. When she finally asked if he had a problem with the fish he explained that it was very bland. The waitress then told us it wasnt her favorite dish either and then scolded us for not flagging her down and telling her earlier!! Whaa? I should have flagged you down??? How about you check on us? The swordfish was taken off our bill in the end with an apology from a manager and a 25 dollar gift card. Birthday truffles? Nope!...

will not be going back to this Flemings any time soon. Not even to use the gift card.

My bf and I ordered
- Calamari (super yummy)
- Pork Belly (3 pc of pork slice for $13, not worth it and it was mostly fat)
- Ribeye w/ crab legs (my bf didn't get a very good cut, whereas I did but whatever it was cooked with, when it was brought out, the smell made me very nauseous)
- Mashed Potato (super yummy)
- Signature Dessert (super yummy)

Their Parmesan bread with the sun dried tomato butter is awesome! We ended up eating 3 loafs of those lol. 

There was a lot of waiter/waitresses, I was amazed. The service was wonderful, very attentive. 

Love their to go back and the little card they attach to it where you can go to a website and learn what you can do with your leftovers. I thought that was pretty unique. 

Overall, it was not bad. Although not sure we would come here again unless we got gift cards. I'd rather go to Border Grill inside Mandalay Bay or to Brand Steakhouse inside Monte Carlo for their steak.",ZF-1QU2jweLa59a5gYQptA,0,0,3,bqSVmvXN78wbe_4HwiuApQ

While waiting on our appetizers fresh baked bread was served with a Brie Chardonnay butter and a sun-dried tomato butter.  I think I could've ate the bread/better and beer all night.

2. Crispy pork belly- served with grits and sweet onion chutney ( when you mix the pork belly with the grits and the chutney all together everything just feels like it will be ok, I try to cut down on my pork intake but with grits and chutney, I didn't feel as guilty)
3. Sweet chili calamari- ehh it's calamari- I think I'll omit this one next time

We told them this was not what we ordered, and the waitress eventually said, ""You are right.""  One manager came up to us and apologized for the mistake, eventually apologizing three times.  Our waitress, meanwhile, never came to our table to make amends during the additional 18 minute delay.  Finally, our food came and then she apologized profusely.  The reason for the negative review is when the check came.  She made a big deal of showing me the comp that we got, for which I thanked her.  That is, until I processed what she said and what was written on my receipt.  I was being comped $118 for the porterhouse I never ordered and which was charged to my bill (bringing me back to a net of 0 comp).  Just to clarify and hint at what SHOULD have happened, I asked, ""Oh, you are not comping me anything for the mistake and the delay?""  ""No,"" she said and walked away.  Stunned at the lack of exceptional customer service I would have expected from such an establishment, I found a manager, which was unfortunately not the manager that had apologized profusely.  This person stated he had just heard about the mistake and apologized.  I told him that I would have expected some compensation for our time and inconvenience (we had our two little boys with us and it was 9 pm already), and he handed me two coupons for future visits.  That would only be helpful if we chose to come back again to this restaurant.  What I truly wanted, asked for, and was denied, was an immediate compensation for the problem.

My husband and I had just seen a show and being pregnant I needed a bite to eat before we went home.  Fleming's was still very busy with people getting their Valentine's dinners in before the weekend was over so we sat at a bar table.  Alan was our server and he seemed like a nice kid.  He brought us over regular dinner menus so we could order a few things off of there, as well as a prix fix menu in case we wanted one of their specials.  My husband and I are small people so we like to order a bunch of little things.  I knew coming in that I was set on calamari and the new wedge salad.  We also ordered lobster rolls which were lettuce wraps with atlantic lobster and some vegetables inside.  Another item we ordered was the southwest macaroni and cheese, and the filet mignon flatbread.  The calamari and flatbread came right away.  We nibbled on those and then waited a good 40-minutes before our other items came.  I had to ask for bread while we waited for our other items.  Usually our servers in the past have just brought bread and butter with our drinks but this server seemed like maybe he had too many tables.  Alan came by and checked on us a bare minimum of times as afterthoughts I felt so I really found the busser food runner to be more helpful.  One instance was while waiting for our other items that took forever I wanted a few more pepperoncini slices to go with my calamari.  Alan never came by for me to ask him until the end.  Finally I asked him and then ten or fifteen minutes later (I am not kidding) came and said that the chef wanted to charge extra for them.  I told him that that would be fine and said, ""What are they going to charge me $1?  $3?  I don't care I am pregnant and I want them.""  I mean really I can't have alcohol or the ahi tuna tacos so give me a break!!!!!  I'm literally thinking he will bring me 10 rings or something.  At this point in the game it was late and I asked for the check as well because our few bites on the way home had turned into long waits for two dishes (one being salad that doesn't need cooked) and a ramekin of pepperoncini rings.  So all my leftovers are boxed up and bagged, and as I have the check to sign Alan brings out a to-go box filled with pepperonicini's.  I thought wow that was nice until I saw that it was a $6 charge.  The common sense here I realized was NIL.  Literally why would I need 200 pepperonicini rings for $6?  Every other restaurant I have been to and ordered calamari I have ordered extra pepperonicini rings and never been charged, and even if I was it'd be fine if it was a few dollars for a few extra rings.  This was just ridiculous.  I would have been better off paying $2 for a whole bottle at Albertson's.  I can't say Alan didn't say I'd be charged but I didn't think they'd try to give me an entire small plate for $6.  I had to ask the busser for my itemized bill by the way since Alan did not bring me one and just brought me the receipts you tip and sign on.  I have been a food server in the past and I have to say this was just ridiculous waits on a salad and side dish, plus a few junior varsity moves on my servers part.  I do think Alan was trying I guess but at Fleming's this is just not the level of service or common-sense that I would expect.  There are a million steakhouses in Vegas so I hope they get it together.  I almost wished a manager had come by so I could ask why my salad took 40 minutes and why I needed $6 worth of pepperoncini rings.",vepRbwKOq3KuN7VSB3PEcA,0,0,2,fAiYqJSv-Equ_wXFDxKQnQ

4290350,2014-01-21,0,FYqFfaxVRW6pdviONXIoDw,"Fleming's has to be my favorite steakhouse. The service is always remarkable and I've never had a bad meal here, ever. This location in particular is gorgeous. It's on Las Vegas Blvd, but not in the congested area of The Strip. So, you get a wonderful view of the huge, lit up hotels through all of the glass. There is an open kitchen with glass so you can see everyone doing their part, but you don't have to hear dishes clanking and steaks sizzling while you're trying to have an enjoyable meal. What I like about Fleming's is that it's a great atmosphere with fantastic food, warm hospitality and beautiful ambiance. 

I ordered a petite filet with spicy shrimp on top and my father ordered a bone in rib-eye. My father always orders his steaks ""well done"" but the server helped me in talking my father down to medium. My father said he has never had a better tasting piece of meat in his life! He and I also shared a side of fries and mac & cheese. My father had a vodka martini and I had a ""50 Shades of Rose."" My cocktail was fresh, light and did just enough to relax me. We finished off with Creme Brûlée and a Lava Cake. Perfect end to a great meal.

He and I ordered the steak and lobster meal. I ordered my steak (medium rare). Well, he cut into his lobster and it was still raw. I cut into my steak and it was raw too! We called the waiter over and he took plates back. My friend got his back first. The lobster was beyond hot, curled up and tasted like rubber. It had been microwaved. My steak was returned to me with a wine sauce poured over it and still raw. I guess they thought I wouldn't notice because the sauce was red? The manager came over and when we tried to explain our meals were raw, he was very rude and tried to say the lobster was chewier because it was from Australia. Really? And my raw steak? He said well what did you ask for. I said medium rare NOT raw. His attitude was that we put him out and he could care less.
We then told them just to take plates away. We were over it. We told them to take our meals off the bill.

4382192,2017-04-03,1,FYqFfaxVRW6pdviONXIoDw,"A great option for a delicious meal without going to The Strip. We dined here a couple of years ago and enjoyed it. Recently when friends suggested Fleming's I knew it'd be a good choice and looked forward to returning for a nice meal. 

This location is very easy to access from the 215 and there is plenty of parking in front. Our friends made a reservation for 6:30 on a Wednesday night and I think that was a good idea. The restaurant was nearly full with only a couple of empty tables. 

The bread to start was really good and I enjoyed the two butter options served with the bread. I started with a Modern Wedge which was loaded with both blue cheese crumbles and blue cheese dressing. The smoky bacon slab and red onion were delicious with the other flavors. The salad was a sizeable starter.

My steak of choice was the Petite Filet (8 oz.) and it was delicious. My request for medium rare was perfected. It wasn't as ""buttery"" as steaks I've had at other steakhouses, but a great steak nonetheless. The Fleming's Potatoes are a gratin style potato and were really yummy. I loved the bubbled cheesy goodness. 

To wrap up the meal I had the Walnut Turtle Pie which was a nice way to end the meal. It was a rich and delicious dessert. The only change I would make is with the ratio of chocolate to walnut. The chocolate layer was thicker than the walnut layer and it would have been even better if that was the opposite. The walnut, chocolate, and caramel all worked together well though. 

The service was great that evening. Our waters were constantly refilled and they were on top of clearing the table regularly. Our waitress was professional and took good care of us.",3nIuSCZk5f_2WWYMLN7h3w,7,4,4,w0RgaQhSH_wnjbj-kkzYPg

Parking was available in front of the restaurant and from I saw you don't have to walk far in general for parking! On entering we received a warm hi and after stating our reservation, we got seated immediately. Despite the fact that it was a Tuesday the restaurant was well visited. Our waitress was friendly but sometimes it took a little time for her to come to us. Hubby tried the (I think it was blueberry) martini and I had a delicious Shiraz which I would always recommend as an easy red wine! We ordered steak (of course!) with asparagus, mushrooms and macaroni&cheese! It was mouthwatering - the mushrooms were delicious and the Mac&cheese was flavorful and rich! I wanted to skip dessert bc it was plenty of food for me but I got convinced that the lava cake is worth a try and it is delicious! And the most amazing surprise was when we received a little box of truffles as a gift for our anniversary!

4403074,2016-06-03,1,FYqFfaxVRW6pdviONXIoDw,"Probably one of the worst experience I have had at a higher end restaurant. I came here for a birthday celebration with friends. Ordered wine and appetizers which came out fine. My gripe is with there steak, I ordered the dry-aged ribeye @ rare+, my friend orders the bone in ribeye @ rare+. Mine comes out medium well, which for any real steak lover thats already too tough by the time it gets to the table. My friend and I agree his came out perfect which goes to show they are capable of making it as it should. 
         Here is the part it all goes south, I had the waiter come over showed them my middle cut verse my buddies steak. Waiter goes back tells them to make a new one. Manager then comes out with the eyeroll face and the new steak, asks me to cut into it. I do so only to see the inside still raw, cold and marbled (they basically flash the outside for a minute). Yes... I actually took a bite. (worst idea ever). At this point you know they are doing this on purpose. He then goes back and instead of broiling it to the correct temp, the flash it again on the grill and bring it back. Parts of it was tough, parts of it was rare, yikes! I did not even bother to eat it.
         Why the 2 stars? They get 2 for pretending to care and for comping the steak. Here is where they lost 3 stars. Serving RAW food is never ok (common sense right?). Rest of my party  felt food was average and there steak was tough. Lastly, standing there with an unpleasant face as a manager that is suppose to mitigate the situation and not make it worse is just plain sad for a birthday party.
 
For everyone who consider this place ask yourself would you come here to gamble $200 @ a hit or miss franchise steak joint or go to a real steak house with perfect reviews?",i4vEKBy3Mcqn67lLTd1oCQ,1,0,2,zXB4P8w7HpyDV6-EZMvrpQ

Asparagus - average, nothing special, but if you want asparagus, its there!

Truffle mashed potatoes - heaven on a fork. These things were fluffy and delicious. Would for sure order these.

Dry aged prime rib eye - amazinggggg. When picking a steak, choose this one. It has incredible flavor and it will leave you feeling like you want to lick the plate just for one more taste. This was some next level flavor, more so than i thought there would be. 

Chocolate lava cake - very very good. Not over sweet. Serve with ice cream. If youre considering dessert, its a sure thing.

Carrot cake - also very good, very sweet when we weren't expecting it.

We started with some appetizers. There was only one I cared about though, Maple Glazed Slab-Cut Bacon. It comes pan crisped withe pickled red onion. It is thick and loaded with great flavor. 

I started with the wedge salad. It was ok. For my meal I ordered the Main Filet Mignon. To mix things up a little I chose the Genuine Kona Coffee topping. It gave it a unique touch. I enjoyed it. I would not do this often, as I prepare the steak by its self, but it was a nice change of pace. The steak was good on its own of course and it was prepared as requested.

Someone else in the group ordered sides. They did ok, but I love the Flemings Potatoes so I was disappointed. Obviously I could have added them, but I try not to be a diva.

I am hard on chains. They generally get lazy and cut corners when they go national. Flemings has done a good job of keeping things up around the country. That is even more important in a city like Las Vegas that has so many unique competitors.",3wB-JjsUjkvdNUDRnChsVg,4,4,4,rEcNo4YFWjMxD4M_vlpX1w

I like Cabernet with my steak, but I was surprised to see my favorite Pinot Noir Meoimi on the menu so I went with that.

My friends all ordered steaks and a few sides and thoroughly enjoyed their dinner. I ordered the bone-in ribeye (my favorite cut) done medium and my taste buds were in for a great treat! Tender, juicy, with a little bit of fattiness... Just the way I like it! It was not the best bone-in ribeye I've ever had, but it was definitely one of the top 5 out of the steakhouses in Las Vegas.

The service was nice. I wish I remembered everyone's names; we had a female server who was very attentive to our needs. We even had two male managers stop by our table to ask how our meal was and left business cards in case we needed anything. Our server also brought out a chocolate dessert since we were celebrating my birthday. Very kind staff which only added to our delightful dinner. 

If you want to go to a steakhouse off the strip but still close by, I would definitely recommend Fleming's. The cost is comparable to steakhouses on the strip (the ribeye was $52).

My husband and I decided to take our 12 year old daughter out to a nice dinner last night.  Let me start by saying Steve was our waiter and he was such a nice, down to earth guy.  He was just the right amt of attentive. Not to pushy, which is a huge plus with us.  Now about the food... We ordered Calamari too start off and were served wonderful bread & butter.. There were 2 kinds of gourmet butters accompanying the bread.. a Brie one and a Smoked Gouda one (I think).  Now imagine butter mixed with both of those cheeses!!!  DELISH!  The Calamari was run of the mill but it had spicy peppers in it which was positive for us, we like anything hot.  For salads, its a MUST for me to order a Blue Cheese Wedge when ever one is available, it was so good!  It had a huge slice of blue cheese on it plus the bacon that we all love so much.  My daughter ordered a Ceasar salad for her meal, the greens were so fresh and crisp, this salad also had fried capers on it which gave it a crunch..  For our entrees we ordered the Sea bass and the 3 course meal that included an 8 ounce Filet with 2 crab stuffed Lobster tails.. It also included a crunchy grilled sweet squash or similar vege. I wanted the Sauteed Mushrooms and my husband wanted Mashed Potatoes, all the sides were amazing.. couldn't imagine a better meal and I've eaten at a lot of the local casino steak houses.. The 3 course entree came with a Pumpkin Cheesecake, and it was a nice slice and tasted fresh and homemade.. I had one glass of wine, husband had 2 cocktails, bill was $198 not including tip..

Once we were there, we arrived about 15 minutes or so, and was promptly seated. Very impressive since they were really busy that day.

The lighting in the restaurant was fairly dark, but I can see why. It is more of an intimate and romantic place, and you should be aimed in on your date.

Our server, David, properly introduced himself, and we were given a menu as well as their wine selection.

I ordered the Prime Bone-In NY Steak, and Allyson ordered the filet mignon. On the side I ordered a side of asparagus, and topped with the truffle poached lobster, and had a big pour of Ladera on the side.

Steaks were ordered Med. Rare, and were cooked to perfection.

4918480,2014-11-03,1,FYqFfaxVRW6pdviONXIoDw,"Flemings is one of the chain steak house that I enjoyed  going. Their food is better than most other chain steak places in my opinion for a more affordable price. I was craving for steak the other day and they are doing a promo for AE card holder. Therefore, I decided to try the new location in Town Square. 

It was relatively packed on Wednesday night. We were seated right away since we had the reservation. Our server was attentive and accommodating. I don't remember her name though. Her service was 5 stars till something happened when we paid our check. 
 
Food

French onion soup: I always like the French onion soup there. It's not too salty like most places and it was flavorful. (4.5/5)

Heirloom tomato and burrata salad: I really enjoy this dish. The homemade burrata was amazing. Only complain was the portion. (4/5)

Prime rib: my friend was satisfied by the medium prime rib. I thought it wasn't too bad but not amazing. (3/5)

Dry age prime ribeye: I ordered a medium rare one. With dry age steak, I was expecting the steak to be more flavorful and tender than regular ribeye. However, I didn't quite taste the difference. (3.5/5)

Chocolate lava cake: this is my favorite dessert there. However, they used to use blue bell ice cream I believe. The ice cream that came with this dessert doesn't taste as rich as blue bell anymore. That was a bummer. (4/5) 

Alright, back to the story. So when we were paying our check, they couldn't get the total correct due to the promo on the AE card. I told the waitress our check amount was off by $15. She apologized and took it back. The manager was helping her figuring out the correct amount. After 20 minutes went by, waitress came by and dropped off the check. Guess what? The total was still the same amount before they did any correction. I couldn't find the waitress so I called for manager. I explained to him that the total was still off. He looked at it and said oh she didn't take if off? And he walked away. Then he had another server to drop off the check. I think it's very very unprofessional of the manager. He should have apologized for the error, fixed it and brought the check back himself instead of blaming on the employee. Due to this whole ""they can't get their math right"" , I waited 30 minutes just to get my check corrected. Not very happy.

4926253,2014-03-26,1,FYqFfaxVRW6pdviONXIoDw,"Boyfriend and I saw that they were doing a special steak & lobster pairing for $39.95 and couldn't resist.  We went in last night around 7:15pm.  Make sure you make reservations.  It seemed busy. The service was topnotch, as expected.  So onto the food.

We started off with the complimentary bread service, which comes with sundried tomato butter and gorgonzola and cranberry infused butter.  Both spreads were amazing and I could have eaten them with a spoon.  

The steak & lobster special came with an amuse bouche of scallop over polenta. This little plate of heaven was sooooo good!  The scallop was perfectly cooked and the polenta had a nice texture and was perfectly seasoned.  Together, these two things were amazing. 

Next you get a wedge salad or French onion soup, which we opted for one of each.  Both were great.  The French onion soup is one of the best I've ever had, but so so so rich.

At this point I was starting to get full. But our entrees came, along with a side of mac & cheese that ordered extra. They looked beautiful.  Our server deshelled our 8 oz. lobster tail tableside, which was kind of neat. Both of our steaks, 8 oz. filets, were perfectly cooked and seasoned.  The meat was so tender and melt in your mouth. The lobster was tender and full of flavor.  

Overall, this was one of the best ""fancy"" meals I've ever had. There is not one thing to complain about. Best of all, we had a $25 gift card, so our meal with 2 glasses of wine came to $90.

When you pay this much for a meal, you should really have superior service to go along with it.

They started us with the bread, which I hate that I want to eat all of it as there's always so much rich food to follow. They do a plain loaf but the sundried tomato butter and the gorgonzola cranberry spread are both so good!

I got the prime rib which is a sunday special. It comes with a salad choice, a side, and a dessert making it a good value package deal. I chose the modern caesar which was very fresh and I appreciate it is not over dressed. The prime rib itself was solid as far as prime rib go. They could have served it more rare, as my medium rare was leaning into medium territory, but not a deal breaker for me. I think though if I had to choose a steak or this, dry aged steak wins. It comes with au jus, creamy horseradish and a nice mustard sauce. 

The BF got the dry aged ribeye. It was cooked perfectly medium rare and the flavor and char was perfect. He could not get over this steak and said it was one of the best he's ever had. I had bites and indeed that is worth its price.

Mine came with a side so I got creamed spinach and it was super creamy and just perfect. I make a solid creamed spinach and that I say is begrudgingly better than mine. The BF also wanted a starch so we got blue cheese mashed potato. They need not skimp on the blue cheese butter! 

I picked their signature lava cake as my dessert that came with my prime rib. It was gooey inside, but it didn't lava out when cut. The flavor was very nice. The ice cream was solid as was the chantilly cream they serve on the side. 

Service was very attentive from our main server, the runners but none were overbearing. I really liked our server Stacey in fact. Im awful with names, but I actually remembered because she was good.The manager came by as well to make sure everything was exceptional once we got our entrees.  I've also always liked places that did things like crumb clean up after bread service and change out your silverware for different courses and chilled utensils for cold/frozen courses. I feel like that should be standard for a nice spot, but I've been to many where it is not. 

For a chain steakhouse, I think it rocks. It's a bit pricey and in a place that is abundant in steak house culture it may not be the first choice, but it's a solid choice. It'll be a moment until my next visit, but this visit was exceptional to warrant the 5 star.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,5,2,5,GwKOnEqZYPQryUIrZSQBpw
5067083,2017-07-05,0,FYqFfaxVRW6pdviONXIoDw,"Undeniably one of the best restaurants in Las Vegas.  From the food to the service to the ambiance.  Everything was 5-Star.  The VERY nice thing about eating at a great steakhouse in Vegas outside of the casinos are the... WINDOWS!!!  You can see sunlight during the day!  The casinos have a lot of great steakhouses but they're usually cramped and dark.  Fleming's is large, spacious, and bright enough during the day to not resemble a Casino Dungeon.

Service is the best I've ever received at any restaurant and I travel extensively.  One waiter, two 'helpers' for water/bread/plate extraction, etc... and two dudes in suites checking to make sure everything is 'good'.  How can it NOT be GOOD when you have 5 people serving 4 patrons? LOL

It was Sunday night and they have an outstanding Prime Rib special which we all took advantage of (except me... I had the small Filet plate).  Prime rib, three sauces, a salad choice, one side, PLUS dessert for $35.  An incredible deal everyone in Vegas should take advantage of!!!

Their creamy horseradish sauce is very good, but not overpowering like you get in so many restaurants.  The Au Jus was typical but there was a third sauce that stood out... I don't know what it was though.  It seemed to have a Heinz 57 base but I could be wrong.

The desserts were all outstanding but what stood out was the Carrot Cake, which I normally don't even like.  It was VERY good!

Tables are just a hair too small.  That's it.  Everything else is fantastic!!!

Seriously, its nothing to go home and wow about. I thought I was not liking it because the portions are small and I was pregnant and considered a bottomless pit at the time. But, after last night, I can say that I've had much better at other places for 1/3 of the price. Food was okay. I just don't understand how ordering 5 dishes and 3 drinks made my bill add up to $200. For that price I would have expected our food to have more flavor. More everything a great chef will allow leave his kitchen. 

For starters. The shrimp cocktail comes with 4 jumbo shrimp and your cocktail sauce. Nothing special here (approx $20). Then, crab cakes. They were ok. A little too soggy for my liking but edible when eaten alongside the sauce its served with (Approx $20). The Fleming's potatoes: why is everyone posting the pic of these potatoes? They were FLAVORLESS? I could have made them from a Betty Crocker ""make-it-at-home"" box and added more excitement that what I had. Then came the asparagus: eh, asparagus at any steakhouse is asparagus, you can slap some butter on it and price it at $10 for a few sticks. That's exactly what Fleming's did here. Nothing special. 

I can honestly say I won't be back. Three times is enough to understand this place is not for me or anyone who likes flavorful food. Its just another steakhouse chain. An upscale Outback if you will with 200% margins on food.",-pCIK2f47lHXiAw-uiD-aQ,2,0,1,IFClEyNpy2DrJ_xAXfUBjQ

This is at the top of my list for best happy hours in town! I always tell everyone this is the Happy Hour to try. Located in Town Square, after years of going to Brio's HH, this is a much better alternative. 

Happy Hour: 
They do not skimp on quality, taste & serving size. I recommend the burrata, carpaccio, & calamari. The blueberry lemon drop is a must try! All $6 each from 5-7pm. 

Service was fantastic. Seating was nice outdoors, except for the massive winds and airplanes. 

Will definitely be back!",825Ol4rTvAZnUyFMke37jA,10,8,5,OTT6457unXTEbBNSkHhj_g
5122961,2014-03-10,0,FYqFfaxVRW6pdviONXIoDw,"The glowing reviews of the Fleming's Yelp Elite event here are what made me want to try the place and I'm very glad I did.

Better than Ruth Chris and on a whole other level than a Outback Steak (duh). The only other place that would give this place a challenge would be BLT Steak in NYC. 

Service: 5 Stars
Food: 4.5  Stars

Bread: Two of us went through 4 loaves. Fresh out of the oven with two choices of softened butter. I couldn't get enough of the Chipotle butter (reddish one). If it was in the store I'd buy it.

SALAD: ""Modern Caesar"" Fine. Generous with the parmesan and prosciutto . 

FLEMING'S POTATOES: Was enough for two people. Served almost in a small casserole dish. Their excellent version of scalloped potatoes. Crunchy layer of cheese on top. Whole thing was delicious and filling.

PRIME RIB: Served rare and was ok, a little bland...I've had award winning prime rib (In Tallahassee, Florida!) that was much better...but all in all it wasn't bad. Served with 3 dipping sauces which were much needed.

MAIN FILET MIGNON: Perfect outer sear. Tender. Perfect medium. One of the better better filet's I can remember tasting...girlfriend got this one...I'll have to jump on this next time. Was about as good as the one at Central (Caesar's Palace).

DESERT: Molten Lava cake: Comes not only with ice cream but also a dish of ""Chantilly cream"". Baked to perfection...nice ooze of chocolate.

SERVICE: This is really where they shine. I think we had about 3 people waiting on us. They really do take care of their customers. Even the general manager came around and asked how everything was and if there was anything we needed. Drinks were never less than half full, always a restock of bread, dishes cleared. Very warm and professional staff.

SUGGESTION: One minor thing...very minor...if you show us the dessert menu in the beginning when the customer starts ordering and you tell them the chocolate lava cake takes 25 minutes and the customer says they'll have 2 at the end of the meal, if you notice the customer is almost done with that last bite of dinner or at least half done with their steak, perhaps fire up that lava cake right then and there knowing that it'll take 25 minutes...or ask the diner if they still have room and if they'd like to have the kitchen get started on it...when we finished up our main course there was about a 25 minute overlay before desserts came. Not a huge deal, just a suggestion. 

I noticed they have a filet and lobster special running all the way into April and are also a part of restaurant week. I may be coming back here sooner than expected.

Looking forward to my next good meal here and would recommend this place to others.",r52bugu98l77gdqTnIJ2oQ,2,0,5,Heqslqd_l4gYTINZSj0kLA

We asked for her opinion on an appetizer and she could immediately tell us which one was her favorite and we believed that she really enjoyed the Ahi Tacos, so we ordered them and they were great. We then ordered our food with some help from Jessica and then dessert. She was so nice the entire time and KNEW OUR NAMES after only telling her once when we sat down.

5147914,2018-02-17,0,FYqFfaxVRW6pdviONXIoDw,"Pros-  
nice space. 
Great wait staff.
Good B&b plate.
Food cooked properly .
Amuse bouche was best item on Valentine's pre fixe menu.

Cons- 
had to approach front desk to be greeted.
Very pretentious for chain steakhouse.
Amuse bouche plate was chipped, at this price point plate ware should be flawless.
Salad on pre fixe menu lacked any kind of finesse, looked / tasted like sizzler salad, mostly ice berg lettuce and not much else of any other ingredient. 
Couldn't taste crab due to the ""au gratin"", crab flavor should be the star, not the Parmesan. 
Steak and salmon setups were the same, couldn't the chef be more creative seeing that they're 2 different taste profiles? 
Salmon flavor was masked by the glaze/sauce.
And last and prob the worst was the dessert course, chocolate dipped strawberries, whipped cream, chocolate dipped madeleines. The strawberries were not fresh, chocolate was sweaty, this is what happens when it sits in the walkin too long. The madeleines were wet and dense, once again you could tell that these were made for Valentine's Day and also had been sitting in the walkin too long, these should have been thrown away. The whipped cream was plopped on the plate and had little to no flavor. 

Maybe because I'm also in the business I noticed all these flaws, but at this price point the Chef/chefs should take pride in what they're sending out as fine dining. We had the pre fixe Valentine's menu, which was still being served two days later. To the average person all this wouldn't be as obvious. I'm sorry but I wanted this to be a great experience as well. The food should be just as great as the wait staff, they were the reason the night went well.",Ruc1X-418La1tdaiN5MHnA,0,0,2,akm0ht76_2ede4z_CLnkSw

Appetizers-
Our favorite so far would be the braised Pork Belly (5/5) its Crispy pork belly with grits and onion chutney the combination is my favorite

Ive always gone with the bone in ribeye when i eat here its to me the best cut here. My wife likes the filet mignon and weve also tried the Bone in New York but its not my cup of tea.
 
Prime Bone in Rib-eye (4/5)
Filet Mignon (4/5)
Bone in New York (2.5/5) 

The best sides that weve tried are:
Flemings Potatoes (5/5)- this may be the best side they got thats OG when it comes to flemings. Cheddar Cheese Potatoes with a hint of jalepeno.

Lobster mac n Cheese (5/5)- Its not on the menu but your server will tell you its a special item. Theres chunks of lobster in here they really dont hold back and its a delicious mac n cheese.

Creamed Spinach (3/5)-this was just your typical creamed spinach nothing special
Sauteed Mushroom (3/5)- Also what you would expect. 

Ive been to better steakhouses, but for the price and service flemings would be a top pick for me wihout breaking the bank too much. Its a solid meal everytime",aWXGwath_dSGPwNdFiy9BQ,10,7,4,vwZHlAphdXIBfivJhA1diA

Our food took forever to come out with no explanation but the flavor kind of made up for that.  It was very good.  They have a decent line list and the meat is all grass fed.  The one complaint I have is the piped in music.  It's awful and it's too loud.  Why can't these places realize that loud rock music, county and western and no name pop blaring while you eat interferes with the appetite.  I did all I could to block it out but it was too loud.

Anyway, I recommend the happy hour there, better prices and more conducive to a quick bite and drink than sitting for a meal and being distracted by the music.",3x1sSKVaNr6wQdvCjiee0w,0,0,3,Cxl9YLju8jL0fx5dBRuAWQ

5227756,2014-04-30,2,FYqFfaxVRW6pdviONXIoDw,"I came to Fleming's for the first time in January, for a Yelp Elite event.  We all received s $25 gift card, and I noticed about a week ago that it expired at the end of this month.

We tried to come out on the weekend, on Saturday evening, but the car broke down.  I was so bummed. 

Yesterday, after work, the fella and I decided to head over for Fleming's Happy Hour, which is from 5-7.  

We were greeted, and invited to sit anywhere at the bar.  Kristen was our bartender, and she took excellent care of us. 

We ordered everything from the ""5-6-7"" menu (5 offerings of cocktails, appetizers, etc for $6 til 7):

2 Skinny Farmer's Daughter cocktails:  delicious.  I actually might prefer these to the Original Farmer's Daughter cocktails we had tried before (the skinny ones don't have simple syrup)

The Pan Crisped Pork Belly: This was interesting.  It was my first time having pork belly, and the texture is VERY weird...but it was rich, and delicious, and the creamy goat cheese grits, and sweet onion chutney that it was served with were absolutely perfect.

The Salt and Pepper Shrimp:
This was a disappointment, as the shrimp are fried, almost like a tempura. According to my fella, its fairly common knowledge that if something says ""Salt and Pepper"" that it is deep fried.  I didn't know that or I would not have ordered it. 
That disappointment aside, the green beans were delicious, and the shrimp were huge.  The flavor was awesome, I just would have been happier with not deep fried.  

The winner of the night, however, was the Beef Carpaccio. I LOVE carpaccio, but haven't had it in years.
Luckily, they were willing to serve it without the creamy sauce that they usually serve over it (fella doesn't care for creamy sauces, especially mayo based ones).
The beef was so thin, and was served with a garlic crustini that was just heaven.  The capers, basil, and horseradish made for a delightful explosion of flavor in every bite. 

Service was awesome, as Kristin was very friendly, and the food runners were nice as well.

I'd love to come back for dinner one night, to try out the steaks!

The spacious amount of seating makes it way easier to dine at this location compared to the original. 

Between the three of us we ordered everything except for the salt and pepper shrimp. At that point, what is another six dollars? The highlights were definitely the mushroom raviolis, baked brie, and burger. The beef carpaccio was not the best. The meat was rather dark and tough compared to the tender bright red I'm used to.The pork belly was very tender and artery clogging. The polenta and compote was my favorite aspect of the dish.

We didn't know they didn't open until 5 so we filled up too much on appetizers at Brio while we waited for Fleming's to open.

After looking through the happy hour menu we noticed it was broken in two sections. There is a five six seven or an eight nine ten. Each refers to the hours it is offered and both menus have totally different menus. Pretty ingenious if you ask me!


So... We started off with a round of blueberry lemon drops. They were pretty yummy and I'm a huge fan of when they actually use fresh fruit as they did here as opposed to all of the artificially flavored syrups.  Again, we were pretty full from our previous excursion but I'm a huge sucker for burrata and there's is house made. Sold!  I was a sucker for the presentation as well since the burrata was served in a mason jar and accompanied by toasted bread, dressed greens and blistered tomatoes. Yum!!! We also ordered the roasted portobello mushroom ravioli. Delish! At this point we switched to wine and we were very impressed by not only the beautiful stemware but the generous pour as well.

We really meant to come for steak I promise! I look forward to come again and not only try a juicy steak but  the pan crisped pork belly and the lobster lettuce wraps as well.

Shrimp and scallop small dish with cheese grits: my favorite dish out of everything I had. The scallops were so tender and perfect. The shrimp was good too but the scallops man. These were mouth watering. The cheese grits were also top notch. They were so creamy and cheesy! 
Sweet and sour calamari: this was a new twist to calamari. The batter was falling off the calamari but these nuggets were still addicting!
Onion rings: huge onion rings. I only ate one piece because the batter was nothing special. It was accompanied by a chipotle mayo tasting sauce but eh. 
Brussels sprouts: what what. I loved it. Perfect texture. It was exactly like how I like to make my brussel sprouts. Slightly charred/burnt (what ever you like to call it) so they can be crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. I think the bacon pieces really gave it the extra kick in flavor. 
Asparagus: loved that these were baked or grilled (has black marks)  
Mac and cheese: so creamy and cheesy! There was also bread crumbs on the top. 
Potato dish: eh. I don't really like potatoes. Not sure what the exact name was either. Layer of thin potato stacked with cheese. 
Lobster bisque: so creamy and rich! Ahh. I wish I had more of this. 
Shrimp side dish: great texture and taste! 
String beans: very flavorful. 
Miso sea bass: it's a tad more sweet than I expected but still great because the fish was so tender and light.
Lobster tail: man I love lobster. It tasted so fresh and smooth. 
Coffee special: I ordered the drinkable desserts as a drink minus the alochol and was served coffee in a cocktail cup. Neat stuff. 
Creme brulee: better than I expected. The texture was smooth and the layer of crystallized sugar was crisp.

Dry Aged Rib Eye - it was really tasty but my boyfriend thinks he's had better.

Swordfish - it was moist and had good flavor, not fishy, so that was good, but next time I think I'm getting the salmon.

When our server came over, my guest ordered a water, and I ordered a water and a sprite, the sprite never came so I asked for it again when our bread was brought over. I ordered (from the server recommendation) the dry aged prime rib eye and I added the lobster, my guest ordered the waygu new York strip Oscar style (his 1 and 2 top choices in steak). We also ordered asparagus and truffle mashed potatoes. 

The food was very good and well enjoyed by both. I felt like the asparagus was nothing special, but that's not what we came for, we came for the steak. I would highly recommend the prime rib eye, there was soooo much flavor in every bite. The mashed potatoes were excellent as well. We ordered the carrot cake and the Chocolate lava cake for dessert and both were amazing. 

I will say that they get a 4 (maybe really a 3.5) because the service was just not there. When you pay this much, you assume you will be well taken care of, but we found ourselves waiting on refills for drinks and on food, and for the check. I was on the verge of ordering a bottle of wine, but by the time the server finally came back that feeling had passed. By the time we got our check we were full and ready to leave and had been waiting for far too long. While the food was delicious, I thought it was too expensive to match the service.

My husband and I came on a weeknight and it was not very busy. Many tables at the bar were open. They had bread and butter to start. We ordered the ahi tacos (which came with 2) which was good. We then ordered the Brie which was inside some sort of dough and had some apples. It was also served with apple slices. Starting off it was really good, and then when we were almost to the end, my husband and I both agreed that we wish it had been goat cheese instead. We shared a bone in ribeye which was cooked perfectly, it was $52 which is very fair for the quality. If this had been at a strip restaurant, it would've cost at least $20 more. We had leftovers.

We also had just a plain cheesecake (nothing special for me, but I like the smores cheesecake from Cheesecake Factory). My husband said the cheesecake was good, basic, but nothing special.

He also ordered the a cab which wasn't on the happy hour menu. I'm surprised they do not pour tasters. But, he drank it even though he did not enjoy it much. I, on the other hand, ordered a cappuccino for a pick me up. And it was delish. I like how they offered sugar cubes instead of the packets of sugar. 

Overall, I would come to the bar for happy hour again. Shoot, I would go every week if I had a sitter that often. It's conveniently in TS, which is very close to home. And the food was good, decently priced.",1z01NwSTBMUae8Fjw2rQog,0,3,3,YimtmAJoPz99_31V_PvzHQ
5492350,2014-02-25,1,FYqFfaxVRW6pdviONXIoDw,"This was my first time to the Town Square location and it was just as good, if not better than the Summerlin location.  The decor is definitely more modern.  My only gripe with the experience here was the wait time even though we had reservations, but it was also Valentine's Day weekend....so I'll let that go.  From start to finish, this place has delicious food and amazing service.  For starters, the bread comes with the gorgonzola and sun dried tomato butters.  For the appetizer, I always get the mushroom ravioli.  It's probably the best mushroom ravioli I've ever had.  It is pricy...so if you want to give this a try without the full price, they also have it on their happy hour menu as well.  I went with the dry aged rib eye this time and it was perfectly marbled with fat.  My fiance ordered the bone-in rib eye, while it was also cooked to perfection, the steak was probably 1/3 large chunks of fat.  I would definitely go with the boneless dry aged steak for value.  For sides, creamed spinach is a favorite of ours.  We also tried the Fleming's potatoes which is similar to scalloped potatoes.  It was creamy with a slight kick from the jalapenos.  I don't think they describe the potatoes well enough in their menu, but definitely better than the mashed potato options we've tried there.  For dessert we got the chocolate lava cake with pistachio crumble, ice cream and chantilly cream.  I must say this was a perfect end to our meal.  I've been to a lot of the strip steak houses and I would say this place has a lower price point with similar service and food.  Also, Costco always has $100 vouchers for $80, so you are saving some there as well!",Tdv7HZa4Hyjm-X0MtNmeag,3,3,5,acPZHI4-faqzCHXkKlLlRw

5526746,2014-01-27,2,FYqFfaxVRW6pdviONXIoDw,"I was thrilled to see that a second location was coming to Vegas, and since I'm on their 'Friends of Flemings' email list I was notified of their grand opening special for locals: $50 off a $100 purchase (alcohol excluded). I couldn't pass a deal like this one up!

The bf and I went there over the weekend and since it's only been open a few days now, everyone is still in training mode. Don't get me wrong, the service was fantastic, almost too good, in the sense that we were surrounded by people trying to help us. We had all sorts of employees coming by the table to fill our water, poor us more wine (we'd ordered a bottle), take away our dishes and check on us. It was quite frankly a little much if you're looking for a nice quiet/intimate night out. I do anticipate this will all settle down as they get their feet wet and everyone is fully trained. I'd rather they error on the side of too much service than no service/poor service.

One of the things I love about Flemings is the ambiance of their locations, dim lighting, linen table cloths, small tables/booths, etc. This location seemed a little less romantic, partly because of the above mentioned but also the open dining room carried the noise more so than in other locations.

The food was wonderful, as I would expect. We shared a wedge salad ($9), which is large enough to share and they'll split it between two plates if you tell them you are sharing it. I ordered the Petite Filet ($41), and the bf ordered one of the evening's specials, a bacon wrapped filet with scallops ($43). His filet was much smaller than we anticipated when it arrived, but it was delicious and perfectly prepared as was mine. We shared a side of Flemings Potatoes, which we'd ordered in the past, but these ended up being much better than I'd remembered them. They were melt in your mouth creamy for not being mashed potatoes - try them you won't be disappointed! As I mentioned above, we also ordered a bottle of wine. Their wine list is rather extensive, they bring you an iPad to look through the wine list, tasting notes and reviews, etc. (It can be a bit overwhelming for someone who doesn't know much about wine, but it's one of the features I love about Flemings!) They decanted the wine for us, an extra step wine aficionados will appreciate, and they asked us if we wanted to keep the cork, which we did.

All in all, I can't wait to return. Their $50 off $100 deal lasts until 2/13/14, I might just have to take advantage of their offer one more time. :)

For those locals wanting to try it: to receive the offer you must make a reservation online through this URL: http://www.flemingssteak...

Our appetizer and my boyfriends steak however were quite disappointing. The menu specified a certain type of greens in our salad, yet when our salad was brought it was not the greens stated on the menu. My boyfriend also ordered his steak peppercorn crusted and it not only came crusted but also drowning in a terrible sauce. It seemed to be a form of red wine sauce, but terribly executed. The manager was nice and comped our salad, and our server was adequate, but nothing spectacular. Our saving grace was dessert which was a take on a smore.

Reservation was at 5:45 pm but got seated right away at 5:15 pm as soon as we arrived. Loved the girls at the front. They were very friendly. The blonde hostess who sat us was very pretty and nice to us. She asked how we were doing and explained the wine menu briefly after was informed that it was our first time. 

The food overall was okay, nothing too impressive. We've been to a few fine dining steakhouses on the strip with the same pricing and ambiance, but  their food was a lot better. But the food was not the issue. Our server, TJ, was the disappointment of the whole dinner. He came over to the table 5-8 minutes after we were seated. Didn't address me by my last name despite the fact that I had a reservation. Didn't ask how we were doing and if it was our first time here. Pretty much didn't explain the menu after we informed him that we would not be drinking tonight.(thinking we were cheap,maybe?) The entire meal, he barely acknowledged us until both entrees were dropped off at the table( not even by him, both appetizers and entrees are dropped off either by food runner or busser, he was not even around when the food was dropped.) He walked by our table a few times before the entrees were dropped and didn't take the empty plates or refill our water. It was very disappointing. My boyfriend started to get very irritated when he saw TJ pass by a few times and didn't ask how the appetizer was nor did he inform us that the steak would be arrived shortly. 
We asked for the military discounts and he said he would check after he grabbed our gift cards and credit card. Then he came by and dropped off the check without even telling us if we received the discount or not(he didn't update the itemized receipt). He was being very short with us the entire time. Anyways, the manager did give us a discount and everyone else was very nice and attentive except for our server TJ. That was the only highlight of our dinner experience at Fleming's. 

I don't recommend coming to Fleming's at all. A server at a local restaurant treats us better than TJ. Not worth the money at all! It totally ruined my mood for our date night. Maybe he was having a bad day but nevertheless, it was very unprofessional for him, especially at a fine dining restaurant. There are so many other steakhouse choices in Vegas.

Why do they have you make a reservation if they're still going to be unprepared for your arrival? So...we waited. Once seated, we were greeted and water/bread arrived quickly. That was the last thing to arrive quickly. We were able to get samples of wine and then ordered a bottle. Both of which arrived in an appropriate amount of time. Once we had the wine we had to wait about 10 mins to place our order. The meal was good, but not amazing. We ordered the table side porterhouse and Thai green beans.

5582686,2017-04-14,3,FYqFfaxVRW6pdviONXIoDw,"(Note - although we ate from the menu, we were seated at the bar.  Table experience may have different service) 

My first experience with this location and I have to admit, although the food was good and the service at the bar was great, I expect more from restaurants like Flemings.  So even though the food was good, nothing excelled to the point of distinguishing this location from any trendy restaurant/bar in Las Vegas. Therefore, I give them an  A-OK (maybe leaning on the 3.5 star), a good rating, but not enough to make me a fan.

The bar is small and crowded.  The staff was friendly which I appreciated.  We were there during happy hour and they have a few appetizer specials for happy hour at about a $9.00 price point (we got the chile calamari and then they have some small plate specials averaging around $24.00 per plate. We got the filet ($24.00 for approximately 5 oz of meat and the shrimp and scallops which I don't recall the exact price but was around $21.00 and came with two medium-large shrimp and two scallops)
The calamari was excellent and a decent size portion.  Definitely the best value we enjoyed.
The Filet honestly looked like it was cut with a table knife as it had five ragged cut pieces of meat.  They were cooked properly and tasted fine.  Also, the shitake Risotto was more like mush and took away from the dish.

The Shrimp and Scallops were good, accompanied by goat cheese grits.  I didn't feel the preparation justified the price point however as it was essentially plain scallop, plain shrimp on the grits which had the most flavor of the dish.  The scallops were cooked perfectly however so a plus on that count.

All in all, the food was good, not standout good, the service was great, and the price a bit high due to location and reputation.",wnO99pBbGqwqOoTQM25iCw,8,2,3,7Sci89d_jW7DBdjZeYpN0A
5584646,2015-11-03,1,FYqFfaxVRW6pdviONXIoDw,"So, we decided to finally stop in at Flemings for a bit of a date night!  And we are def glad we did.  
We had reservations, so we were sat right away, though it was early in the evening and the joint wasn't terribly busy.  But as the evening passed, it became a hot bed of an eclectic mix of people, being on the south end of the strip.
Our server, Luz, introduced herself,  gave us our menus and drink ipad/tablet, and was very informative of the selections and questions that we had through our entire evening.  Luz was a great relief from some of our most recent experiences with other servers at different restaurants.  She paired a wine, perfectly, for my better half's menu upon the request of my ol lady.  
We both ordered the Monday night special menu.  A choice of soup/salads, 3 different entree's, two sides out of 4 options, and a choice from 3 desserts.  We both had french onion soup, which was great.  Then for our main course, we both had the ribeyes.  And for dessert, she had the carrot cake, I had the walnut turtle pie, and neither of us left a trace of dessert.
For the ribeyes, all I can say is excellent!  Great seasoning, and the cook on both of ours were spot on, med. rare, and medium.  A fair warning, though,, the plates they serve the main courses on are EXTREMELY HOT!!!  They do warn you as they place them for you on the table, but again, HOT!!  Don't even think about touching them without using the napkins to grab them with!!  
They also offer complimentary sauces for the steaks, bearnaise, peppercorn, and another that I cant recall.  We had the bearnaise and peppercorn.  Both were great, and neither were actually needed for the steaks.  The steaks are seasoned really well, and the flavor of the beef really comes out in each bite.  
My only complaint, and really not a complaint, just a head scratcher, is the ipad/tablet drink menus.  I'm not understanding how those are more convenient than the drink menus that are in the pages of the actual dinner menu.  To me, it's quicker and more user friendly to navigate the list thats on the paper.  Every drink/wine option in front of you, with no need to select this tab, select this option, scroll down, select that variety,,,etc etc.  These tablets are popping up, here and there, but really have not gained any credibility with us, and usually just end up on the side of the table, closed out, while we read the paperback versions.   But like I said, not really a complaint against Flemings, just the tablet idea in general.  
Overall, a great experience from beginning to end at Flemings.  We will be back!!",miuLlOYWfT6hIJuoe1PkQg,1,2,4,dmN4ZS2qxHMzN0pyPKXogg
5588861,2016-02-05,1,FYqFfaxVRW6pdviONXIoDw,"My husband and I had a wonderful lecture to attend at Fleming's. Great right! During the lecture, our prix fixe menu was served. First they nicely asked us if we wanted red or white wine. I started with a Sprite. Its a Thursday.. No happy hour for me. 

Then a shrimp cocktail was served. It was cold enough.. Not nearly enough cocktail sauce for the two large shrimps/prawns we got. And the shrimp didn't taste fresh to me.. It was just bleh.

Next was a salad course with candied pecans and a vinaigrette dressing. I love salad. Can't go wrong. Just looked a little sloppily plated.

Next up, a nice warm bread with AMAZING spread was served. This was fantastic. My favorite dish.. Was the bread. Haha

Then came out the entree. I ordered chicken, my husband ordered filet mignon. I personally think the chicken was better than the steak. It was juicy and flavorful. Weird right? Considering I'm at a steak house?

Overall, this place is nice but the food is OK. Very odd that the chicken was better than the steak though. Am I being disrespectful? Meh..",n28qz1Lt9ROormO7eCooOg,1,0,3,rzfSMelE4h8buaUF0XtJrw

Have to say though that I will probably never come back and that both my friend and I were quite dissapointed. I didn't really care for the selection of food on the happy hour menu but I was there to have the hamburger . My friend ordered the ravioli and the flatbread which both of them did not look that appealing. My hamburger was okay but not the amazing Burger I was told. 
As for drinks I got a glass of Cabernet. The price was listed $8 but she gave me a choice of a 6oz or 9 oz pour. I asked her what the price was for the 9 oz and she says it's comparable to the 6 but didnt give price so I chose the 9oz and it was $12. I'm thinking for a happy hour that's quite expensive and it wasn't even a good quality wine.  It was 14 Hands which is close to a bottom shelf wine that I see at the stores. 
Then as for the service, our girl was not very friendly . She was efficient, till the end. When I went to the bathroom, she came to pick up the check and my friend  still had quite a bit of flatbread left and she didn't even ask if she wanted a box so my friend had to stop her and ask her. I still left her a generous tip but kind of wish I didn't.oh well we won't be back.

I had a reservation for 6:30 but we arrived around 6:00 so that we could take advantage of the happy hour specials in the bar before heading to the dining room. The $6 martinis were perfect. We also ordered the salt and pepper shrimp and the carpaccio. Both of them were perfect and both were $6. We have been here many times and have had just about everything on the HH menu and those are my 2 favorites. We were able to go to our table when we were ready and our bar tab just transferred over. (we left a tip for the cocktail waitress though). Having been here for dinner several times, we decided to try out the small plates and share. Considering we had already had appetizers, we weren't ready for steaks (although the pepper steak is the husbands favorite) We ordered the lamb chops, the braised short ribs and the scallops. Everything was outstanding. The lamb chops were the favorite for both of us. Our main waiter was Christian, he was so kind and had that perfect balance of making sure you have everything you need while not hovering and bothering you. The managing partner, Leroy, made a couple stops at our table to make sure we were happy. The service here really is exceptional. When we were paying the bill, Christian had asked if we had valeted the car because he would have it brought to the front for us! You can tell that Leroy takes great pride and truly enjoys making each guest feel like they are having a perfect experience. We eat out several times a week and have been to hundreds of restaurants here, this is one of my favorites.

Reservation was at 7:30 and we were seated right away in a cozy circular booth.  We had drinks and each ordered a salad to start (Fleming's salad and wedge salad).  Both were super tasty.  I got the petite filet mignon with the flavor sauce trio, and the husband had the regular filet.  They were both cooked exactly as requested (mine warm red center, his cremated).  We found them to be delicious.  The flavors were awesome - sweet onion bacon jam?  Are you kidding me!?  Yes.

For dessert we had the turtle pie, which was also awesome.  Seriously, no complaints at any point here.  Our server, Eric, was absolutely fantastic.  It was like we were his best friends, but that kind of friend that's only around when you need them and never hangs around too long.  

We had a $25 off coupon for booking the reservation online, plus a gift card my MIL gave us for our anniversary, but still spent over $100.  The place is pricey but I found the experience + food combo to be worth the indulgence.  We'll save this place for special occasions!

5658916,2017-03-24,3,FYqFfaxVRW6pdviONXIoDw,"I have been to Fleming's many many times. Mostly, in California. This location was nice. The food was delicious as always. The service was mostly good. The bus boys, male waiter & the manager that came by were all very nice. Our waitress, Lucy, could have been better. Hence the 3 stars. 

From the beginning, the very first thing that we ordered was the chocolate lava cake. We told her we definitely wanted that. And, we told her because we didn't want to wait a very long time for it. We thought that it would come out right when we were done with dinner. But, she definitely forgot about it.

She brought out the bread and the two cheesy spreads. Both were good. I ordered the 20 ounce bone in ribeye, well done charred, and it came out perfectly. The Fleming's potatoes and the creamed spinach were both delicious. The creamed spinach had a little kick to it. He had the lobster tempura. She came by and asked him if he wanted more water which he did. But, she didn't ask me. I thought that she was going to ask if we were ready for dessert, which we were. But, she didn't. I had to wait another few minutes to get a refill on my water. The bus boy gladly did it for me. 

She finally came by again, and I told her that we were done with dinner and we were ready for the chocolate lava cake. I also asked her if it was waiting for us. She didn't say anything. Not a word. We were confused at this point.

About 15-20 minutes later she finally comes and says that the chocolate lava cake is coming. We wanted to tell her that, we ordered it from the very beginning so that we wouldn't have to wait such a long time for it. But, we decided to let it go at that point. We were having a wonderful dinner. The chocolate lava cake finally came. We were in a bit of a hurry at this point. So, we kind of rushed through the dessert. We did enjoy it, but we didn't have that much time to eat it as slowly as we would have if she would've brought it right after dinner.",dEp7BNFhnjaMYWcJ_KqsyQ,4,2,3,xrBZnzokqIUHer6U-kFz0Q
5659597,2014-03-04,0,FYqFfaxVRW6pdviONXIoDw,"This review will be short because Fleming's is really one of those places that you just have to try to realize how good it is. Great service, wide selection of wine, and a fantastic happy hour. 

We sat outside because we did not have a reservation. Pleasantly surprised that happy hour applied to outside as well! Everything is $6 each on the menu. I got a red blend (which paired up nicely with my steak) and the carpaccio. Oh man, the carpaccio was huge! Super unexpected. The taste was decent but the tenderness of the meat and the presentation was appealing.

My petit filet minon was pretty good but not mindblowing. It was the Fleming's potatoes that did me in...Layers upon layers of softness surrounded by a crispy exterior. My boyfriend ordered the prime ribeye and it honestly was the juiciest and most delicious ribeye I have ever tasted. Definitely ordering that next time. You get a complimentary sauce as well! I got the peppercorn and he got the chimichurri. Both were pretty good and the flavors did not overwhelm the steaks' own flavor.

Oh and the complimentary bread they serve in the beginning...Hot and fresh and comes with a cheese (bleu, I believe) dip and an herbed butter spread. I would have eaten more If I wasn't saving room for the steak!

-1 star because it's a tad overpriced in my opinion for some menu items. The items are a la cart so when you pay $40 for a steak you only get that and no sides (unless specifically listed in the menu). The $9 Fleming's salad was probably one of the biggest rip-offs I have ever paid for. It was basically a few pieces of lettuce with one or two grape tomatoes. They tried to play it off as fancy by having a giant unique crouton and serving the bowl and salad fork cold. It was not worth it at all. I take tiny bites and the salad only took me 3 or 4 bites max.

The only reason I went there was because of my $40 gift card, which reduced the bill to $80 (two steaks, one HH appetizer, two HH wines, and a salad). Now we know that the place is solid so we'll come back for HH someday!",QzXS25_FwIUrYTyDMZkUQA,0,0,4,wwxkH0jzGlV7TS51w4LFjw

I usually will gobble up their food they haven't finished but it wasn't worth the extra calories!  Our friend order the filet and it was so small it looked like a single meatball on her plate.  My husband ordered the prime rib and it was not good. He said he's had better steak at a non steak place like Red Lobster. The turtle pie my dad had ordered was frozen solid on the end and couldn't cut it at all. We chose this place over Cili at Bali Hai Golf course and man do we regret it!  Was really looking forward to a tasty brunch.",DTruKJFwMptLGEY4K2ZLEQ,1,1,1,eDMxiaDGItpGhjrE1SdAAA

Food as well as the cocktails and wine on the Happy Hour menu are between $6-8. Their calamari has always been a fave of mine- it's tossed in a sweet chili sauce with red and banana peppers. Yum. 

The service was good, and so was my company and we will definitely be back for happy hour soon!",xrvyW1ruKS0uz9RtFewC0Q,5,6,5,qk4B7vzO4M6JgdPyDr2-bg

5707065,2014-06-02,1,FYqFfaxVRW6pdviONXIoDw,"This is by far the tiniest Flemings I've been to, and I've only been to 2 others: The other Vegas location and the Newport Beach one.  

My complaint with the set up is there's no barricade from the bar and the formal dining area.  With the loud groups in the bar area, your so called quiet night can be ruined.  Plus, they have 2 big TV's mounted on the bar, which can be distracting if you're facing the bar and you keep looking at the hockey game, instead of paying attention to your meal.  

Being said that, I made my 7:00 reservation and was seated promptly... but by the door right AND next to the bar!  No thank you! I wanted a nice quiet dinner, not next to the group of prom or wedding goers who were loud and obnoxious, taking selfies and group pics.

I asked to be seated elsewhere and the hostess said it'll be a bit of a wait.  I'm guessing other people had their table 'ear marked' because I saw a few empty tables she could have seated me at.

We stood by the door thinking it'll be just a few minutes.  We should have moved to the bar, if we had known the wait would have been 45 minutes longer.

Other couples came in and not once did the hostess offer them the ""crummy"" table.  I wonder why they offered it to me?? Maybe because I was getting $40 off my $100 meal offer that gave me a crummy table??

At 8:00 we get seated at a MUCH nicer circlular booth and our server was very friendly.  She never asked if we dined at Flemings and started telling us how to use the iPod for wine, and also assumed I must rarely eat red meat, as she told us how the dry aged steaks were better than the other aged steaks.  

Stephen and I decided to share a steak, so we each ordered a starter, he got the Wedge Salad, I got the Shrimp Cocktail, then we ordered a NY Strip to share, and 2 sides: The Signature Onion Rings, and the Garlic Mashed.


The food was delicious, and they got 4 stars but quite honestly I think 3 stars could suffice.  

Thankfully I got my gift card at Costco ($100 card for $79.99) and with the discount from the email ($40 off the bill if you spend $100) our $121 meal came to $81!  That's the best way to eat at Flemings!

PLENTY of free parking, so I don't know why people would valet it.. but I guess if you want to impress your date, go for it. Its only 10 less steps than where I parked.",cKJ0r01eF7E-tYp2FQOyRA,4,1,4,kwaEp3DFFT9N3dTWqbRF-w
5715207,2016-05-09,9,FYqFfaxVRW6pdviONXIoDw,"Had reservations for Saturday 5-7-16 to celebrate mother's day a lil' early.  Arrived and our table wasn't ready yet so we sat at the bar and ordered drinks.  My hubs got a beer and I ordered a drink that I had at Fleming's in Summerlin called a ""blackberry bramble"".  My drink, although tasty, was a completely different color than the cocktail I had in Summerlin and was missing the fresh blackberry garnish.  I can't prove it but I'm 80% sure he used some black cherries from a jar instead of blackberry because he pulled the fruit from a jar and then muddled it and the other bartender came over and asked if he could borrow the cherries and my bartender handed him that jar he pulled my fruit from.  Inconsistency among food at chain/franchise restaurants is my #1 pet peeve.  You wouldn't go to McDonalds and receive crinkle-cut fries, would you??? Same principle.   (Strike 1) 

Our server, although very nice and attentive, had a very thick accent and it was hard to understand her at times.  Also she had on bright red lipstick that was colored way outside the lines of her lips which made me question her sanity/eyesight.  She brought us some delicious warm bread with flavored butters and a terrific caesar salad.  

$49 seafood tower- I don't know why they call it a tower because it's just one bowl.  There was a chilled lobster tail, four shrimp, four crab claws, and two king crab legs.  It came with a whole lemon, cocktail sauce, and a creamy mustard sauce.  The presentation was beautiful and overall it was very fresh.  The lobster had quite a bit of innards/poo leftover however and I am not a huge fan of cold crab/lobster so I'd skip this next time.  I think I would have been just as happy with the shrimp cocktail for about half the price.  

$43.50 Chilean sea bass- according to the menu is sautéed and braised in a light, southwest-style broth, wilted greens, crisp potatoes, chile-cilantro oil.  The fish was so bland and was sitting in a pool of what I can only describe as tomato water....it was not a broth and the tomatoes and garlic appeared fresh.  There was a lot of cumin in it but I rallied the troops and with the help of the salt & pepper shakers ate enough of it so that I wouldn't feel guilty later about the starving children in Africa.  It's definitely one of the worst things I have eaten this year and I don't recommend it.  Also in looking at the photos of it on Yelp every single dish looks different.  I wonder if what I got is normal or not?  (Strike 2)

$10.95 spicy thai green beans were very tasty although not spicy at all and some were almost burnt and others were almost completely raw.  I am not sure how they were cooked to create such an uneven amount of done-ness.   $11.50 sauteed mushrooms were absolutely perfect and had a nice variety of shrooms.  

The $11.50 creme brulee was one of the best I've ever had.  I loved the shallow dish it was in and it had a perfectly bruleed top.  The fresh berries and whipped cream accompaniment took it over the top.  

I'm kinda disappointed just because the yelp elite event at Fleming's in Summerlin had got my hopes up so high.  I would only go back here if somebody offered to buy me dinner.  It is pretentious without any skill to back it up.",VigsAph76fP7pechJ743EA,11,6,3,Mc4dFYHRBDO-d-udQZWNog

Erin was our server, she was very detailed in explaining the menu items as well as making sure we were well taken of. She even went above and beyond to help us choose a Vegas club to celebrate the birthday boy. All wait staff were so amazingly friendly and attentive to our needs, our water glasses never went half empty and the manager came around and introduced himself to make sure we were having a perfect time. 

Our steaks were perfectly cooked. The iron crisp was a perfect choice in cooking our ribeyes. Mac n cheese, mashed potatoes and creamed spinach were all the perfect pairings for our steaks. 

Erin complimented the birthday boys dinner with a box of truffles and a gift card for our next visit.

The customer service was so great, I couldn't wait to try the food. Their Ribeye steaks were phenomenal!!! TASTY, JUICY, & FLAVORFUL!! The Tempura battered Lobster was AMAZING! It wasn't so heavily battered that you would lose the natural taste of the lobster. It was crunchy, moist and delicious! The sides...they are generous with the sides so don't get carried away. We did! LOL! The creamed spinach, Fleming's potatoes, asparagus and table bread, with two different sides of butter(champagne and cheddar), were all  DELICIOUS compliments to our main courses.

We were dining during Happy Hour to take advantage of our $100 gift card that I won!
Service is quick and friendly, and there was no long wait for anything. We tried a number of happy hour apps- Salt & pepper tempura shrimp (tasty shrimp, but the mustardy sauce it comes with was a no go) Asked for cocktail sauce instead. 
There are also tempura green beans with the shrimp, and tempura lemons which is very strange. I liked the lemons, but who wants to bite into what looks like a slice of zucchini and find a lemon?
The baked brie was my fave. Delicious! Served with apple slices. 
The Fleming's salad was very good, loved the tangy dressing. There are a number of $6 drinks at happy hour, we both enjoyed those as well. Nice selection of $6 wines and 2 beers (their choice) for $6.
I ordered carrot cake to go, which was mushy and seemed not cooked all the way. Last time I had the carrot cake at the Summerlin location, it was delicious!

We were seated right when we entered. The bar was packed for happy hour but the restaurant was pretty empty. Our server Alan was over quickly to take our drink orders. Alan was an outstanding server who provided us excellent service throughout our amazing dinner. 

We both chose the pre-fixed filet & lobster specials which came with a bacon wrapped scallop and a salad. At $50 this is an excellent deal. We also ordered a side of the infamous flemings potatoes. Warm parmesan sourdough bread was brought out with two different spreads. It was piping hot and delicious. The scallop quickly followed and it was outstanding. Crispy bacon around a perfectly cooked scallop a great start to our dinner. Our salads were also very good. The seasonal salad had cranberries, walnuts and a wonderful lemon vinaigrette. The wedge was standard but had two slices of thick bacon on top. 

The main entrees came out and the steaks were cooked to perfection. My one and only complaint tonight was that the lobster was slightly overcooked and chewy but its hardly worth mentioning as everything else was perfect. The flemings potatoes, I mean seriously. Thin sliced potatoes made with cream, cheddar cheese and jalapeño....Mmmmm. 

As full as we were we had to order the lava cake and I am so glad we did. It was by far the best lava cake we've ever had. Served with two scoops of vanilla ice cream and fresh whipped cream it was phenomenal. The outside was crispy, the inside was soft and when we cut into it the melted chocolate came pouring out.
