Nigiri definitely has way too much rice on it. The fish was pretty fresh but sliced so paper thin I could see through it. Almost like they were trying to ration their fish. 

When the server delivered our combo tempura a freaking ant came with it!!! 

They don't do half rolls unless it's your very last roll. The rolls are the standard portion of rice but some looked scaled down. 

In the end the menu is pretty large with a lot of variety just don't expect large portions.

My best friend and I have been coming here once a month for about 10 months. We've never had an issue with the service, but a couple of months ago, a new guy and he's been our waiter the last two times--he's hilarious! Upbeat, energetic and funny! 

The rolls just can't be beat. They are all delicious, our favorite being Sex on the Beach and One Night Stand. There was one roll that we had never tried before, The Red Tiger, but our server insisted we try it a couple months ago and it's now another one of our favorites. Last month when we were in, he remembered what we ordered, which is always nice. A lot of their rolls are spicy, but that's fine for us--we love spicy foods.

Two large-screen TVs are really nice during football season too. The staff is really good about letting you pick what channel you want to watch.

I have tried a few other sushi places in town (Sushi Bomb isn't around the corner from my house, so when I go out with my daughter, we try places near home) and I always end up not liking the other places and I always compare them to Sushi Bomb. Nothing compares.

For the price and the service and the flavor and variety, I can't find a better place in town. So delicious.",03wmoeMESyXuiQZlf7D4rQ,1,1,5,ZkK0bGQUHpA6B4rhDiVtMw

The food was not what I wanted.  It seemed to me the majority of the rolls had either eel in them or they were spicy.  I can't stand eel and my best friend doesn't eat spicy so we really had a problem looking at what rolls to eat.  We asked if we could sub spicy tuna for regular tuna and the server didn't understand what we were saying.  I had major issues with the service but will get to that later.  Back to the food....we ordered tempura which pieces were so undercooked we couldn't eat it.   Seriously, I have no idea what veggie it was.   It was like a rock.  The rolls were so so.  Nothing stood out.  
Ok I understand they had some issues with service being bad.  Being in the industry I consider myself a little more patient than others.  It wasn't like they ignored us, it was the complete opposite.  I couldn't finish a sentence without them coming and asking us how everything was.   We told them to leave the menus, 3 different people tried to take them.   I asked them questions about the menu and they had no idea what some of the items were.  I couldn't wait to get out of there.   Personally, I love it that they asked how we were doing but really, every 2 minutes.  Annoying.

First and foremost my family comes to sushi bomb OFTEN at least 3 times a month. My mom asked me to go with to try out the place. We had 13 people total and out of the 13, 10 of us were all you can eat, our bill was over 400 dollars. AYCE for almost 30 dollars a piece was definitely not worth it when you can find it cheaper with WAY better service. The service here was literally by far the worst service I have ever received at a sushi restaurant! My son is only 3 years old and they took a while to bring out his sushi so he took ONE and I mean ONE piece of my sushi and they literally came up to me and told me he cannot share off of me. Seriously, how much can a 3 year old eat from my plate? I ordered him his entire own roll but it was taking a while to come and I'm not going to sit there and watch my son starve as we are all eating. After that, they also scolded my 7 year old who ate 3 edamames from my sisters AYCE. Seriously 3 edamames. It was honestly so disrespectful. And to top it off, they wanted to charge us for 6 pieces of sushi that was left out of 10 AYCE!!! Seriously??? The bill is over 400 bucks and you want to charge us over 6 pieces of uneaten sushi? That is absolutely ridiculous. My husband was forced to eat the last 6 pieces and literally came home and vomited. Another thing that upset me was that I guess they have 2 dollar draft Sapporo for AYCE. They failed to tell us that until the very end after we had ordered 30 dollars in regular Sapporo not knowing the draft was INCREDIBLY cheaper. They're money hungry and don't care at all about service, only the money they can take from your pocket. It's ridiculous the way they treated me and my family considering the amount we were spending plus 18% tip. They need waaay better service. Sushi was ok, just like every other place here in Vegas, nothing OUT OF THIS WORLD, by any means. Take your money else where with better service and better sushi. Also waitresses jasmine and jen were incredibly disrespectful and need to reconsider their positions as waitresses. They have lost a total of 18 people's business!

And I was happy to find out -- it is!  We gave them a visit the other night and tried about nine different rolls between us... and I can't think of one thing to complain about on any of them.  Very fresh and VERY yummy.  I also thought the service was excellent.  They were great at keeping the rolls coming out one at a time, with no big lags between them.  They were also very friendly and didn't give us attitude (as some places do) when we wanted to order more.

I love the ambiance of this place, too.  Sure it's in a strip mall just like all of the other sushi places in Vegas, but the decor is really cute and the tables/chairs are nice and comfy. And even though the place was full, it wasn't too noisy at all.

There are only a couple small things that knock this rating down to a 4 from a 5 for me.  One... they don't allow you to order half-rolls, except for your very last order, which kinda bugs me.  And although they do let you order anything on the menu, their appetizer list is extreeeemely small.  I think they only offered 4-5 things.

Cons:  Awful horrible service.

Honestly my FIRST negative review on Yelp.  The service was that bad that I could not let it go and to inform others. Literally read reviews from 2 months ago complaining about the same thing.

Let me preface that we came in a whole hour before closing which is decent time to order and eat, so I understood that last call for food was 30 min before closing.  Our server was just impatient, rude, and unhappy.  It was to the point I almost wanted to have her sit down and breath and talk about why it seems she hates her job so much to make the customers feel so uncomfortable and awkward.  The sushi men behind the bar we're irritated and unhappy, as if they we're pissed we came in since they seemed they wanted to close up early and go home.  It just felt we we're a burden to the whole staff.  We wished we could have left earlier, after an $80 bill for 2 people with poor service, I didn't want to even tip. Everyone is in customer service in some way, no need to be so unpleasant to people who want to have a nice dinner.

I MIGHT give a 2nd chance to see if there is any improvement, but honestly would rather drive the extra 7 miles to Chinatown for better service than have that experience again.  I would never recommend this place to anyone.  The bad service just trumps the good food.. honestly that ridiculous.

Recommendation to management:  Please properly train your staff to wait on tables in a friendly manner, not in a ""hurry up and eat you food"" type of way.

Thats how it starts, let me tell you how it ends. Next we order!
More Salmon Sushi! Check!

Salmon cheese sticks. Check!
Baja Yellowtail roll. Check!
Throw in some Salmon hand rolls. Double Check!!

Ridiculously unyielding. Will not add or substitute anything. For instance, they have an avocado asparagus roll yet will not add either to a menu item.

Had a couple people in our party ordering ayce and a younger teenager ordering ala cart. The appetizer portions are different sizes depending on how you order. The waitress freaked when the teenager started eating the wrong order.........didn't make sense, especially since the ayce order was smaller!!!

I guess they are under new management and they cleaned house. We came in tonight with new servers and staff. Our male server was a complete jerk from the beginning. He never smiled at us. When we all said we were doing ""all you can eat,"" he didn't believe us. He told us 20 minutes later that the kitchen was closing, but they weren't closing for another 45 minutes? Hmmm. He was totally rushing for us to leave. There was a female server that was helping him out--she was nice, but that's the only good thing i have to say about our experience.

All the while, while this was all happening, the owner was just sitting at a table just staring at us eat. Knowing we were unhappy about the service, and complaining to the female server, not once did he care to talk to us. Like a coward, he just sat from afar and stared.

Servers are supposed to earn their tips. That's why we eat out because we are paying for the service. We won't be back and i suggest no one else should if service like this continues.",J6YSwRRzfHpNgbS6my2Z3Q,5,1,1,ClNkGCkDzG9imDQgha3Vsg

1309683,2017-03-06,2,tCYAxj5_pV4RnDpe3_5VpA,"Checked out this place for a Sunday dinner service. Family of 4 including 2 young kids. The ambience is average and the place is a little more than average noise level. 

After being seated, a server came over to ask for drink orders. When I paused to breathe, she took that as taking too long and walked away. This actually happened a second time as I was asking my kids what they wanted and that took too long for her. On her third arrival at the table, I literally had to ask her to give us 30 seconds to answer her questions before she walks away again. 

So we ordered 2 kids meals and 2 AYCE. The server  was at least helpful in explaining how their AYCE works e.g. which items were excluded or limited to one. 

I found it a little off-putting to have her emphasize to us the kids can't share our food. This was as they were dropping food off to the table and the kids meals still waiting to be done. I totally get that a business doesn't want to have people abuse the AYCE rules, but I highly doubt 2 little kids are going to eat them into bankruptcy. 

Then I ordered one thing only to have the wrong item brought to the table. When it was mentioned to the server, he shrugged his shoulders and left it on the table anyway. 

When asked to speak with a manager, surprisingly none on site! Can't say that I didn't see that one coming. 

It's a shame because the food is good and there is a decent selection. They do seem to err on more spicy oriented special rolls. Which is how they got a second star from me. 

Definitely not very family friendly in my opinion. So won't be back. I recommend you save yourself a bad experience like we had and it spoiled a nice time out with my family.",1PAYxBmN4iOcrh5p-vS2Ag,1,0,2,oKhetHcWjY7QjGBQDDmYng

I was in the area, so I tried Sushi Bomb for a second time (first time did not go well either) with friends and our kids. 
Major disappointment. MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT!
Their AYCE sushi was a little pricey but it was Sunday late afternoon, and we knew the AYCE dinner price was still a value. The kids meal also seemed like a good value.
NOTE: Hot green tea was NOT included for $27.99 per AYCE adult sushi which seemed strange to me.
We were told right away to order ALL of our sushi at once because they would NOT otherwise be able to make it without us waiting up to 25 minutes for each order... WHAT? That is NOT how ""All You Can Eat"" is supposed to work. We all felt cheated because of the time delay between our ordering and receiving our food. This needs to be fixed Sushi Bomb! Hire more sushi chefs and servers (there must have been around 75 people in this little restaurant and it looked like only THREE servers).
THEN THEY GOT OUR ORDER WRONG, forgot items (I never did get my blue fin tuna nigiri), had to replace items with other choices (even though the fish we wanted was an advertised item on the table display), served us COLD HOT GREEN TEA (which took over 10 minutes to get replaced) they mistakenly put my last specialty roll on another table so I had to WAIT LONGER to get it after they tried to influence me to cancel the order (as we were at the end of our dinner)...
The food quality was okay UNTIL THEY SERVED THE GOLDEN SCALLOPS, which WERE NOT EVEN SCALLOPS AT ALL!! The ""Golden Scallops"" were made with FAKE CRAB MEAT (they later admitted to us that it was fish cake, but I know what the imitation crab meat looks and tastes like), which were OVER-BREADED in a flavorless, over-fried very hard coating... YUCK!!! Gross!!!
We asked for a discount as our check for this experience was almost $200 for 3 adults and 3 kids, and were only given ONLY $12 off... why that amount, I could not tell you, but we agreed that at least it was some amount taken off of the check. 
I will NEVER RETURN to Sushi Bomb. I did not enjoy it.
We finally paid and left, but this bad experience was not over yet... 
After all of this, I unfortunately felt victimized by Sushi Bomb as they squeezed in SO MANY TABLES in that place that I could not walk through to the exit without knocking stuff off of one of their tables... which is HUMILIATING and MUST BE A FIRE HAZARD!!!

Some of their specialty rolls like the Touchdown was good. Their eel sauce as part of the DJ's Special (one of my favorite rolls) seriously tasted like cinnamon was way too sweet for me. I was a little bummed.

Located around at Cheyenne and 215. It was quiet when we arrived, only 2 other girls at the bar. There were 2 sushi chefs and a server on duty. Everyone was really nice. They recommended the S&H Roll and we also ordered the Kimono Roll. Both of which are cream cheese rolls so it's kinda heavy, but DELICIOUS!! Comes with a little salad with their dressing in the center. Just hit the spot.

Also tried their yellowtail roll and scallop sushi. Scallops were big but not too fresh (I usually only get them when I am in Cali) and the yellowtail was okay, not really a fan.

What I am a fan of is their dessert! They have plum flavored ice cream! (Photo added) we had plum tempura ice cream. YUM! There's chunks of plum in the ice cream. 

Service was awesome, food was great, ambiance was nice, good location for me. Great place. Must check it out.

Although, like everything else in Vegas, it's in a suburban strip mall - the interior is well done - with wood paneled walls with large paintings of koi and paper lanterns hanging from the ceiling. The glass tiled wall behind the sushi bar gives it a bit of hip chic.

We've always felt the food is good here. Sure - the waitress will always make the obligatory joke when you ask for a ""Kiss My Ass"" roll - and like so many sushi bars in town, everything has a somewhat dirty name. I have to admit, I don't find this trend particularly appealing, but whatev.  Last night the two of us split the aforementioned Kiss My Ass, the Red Tiger roll, Veggie Roll, and garlic tuna nigiri chased down with a house saki and a large Kirin. A new roll for us, The Red Tiger, is shrimp tempura and avocado wrapped in spicy tuna with a garlic sauce which is amazing. A new favorite.

As far as sushi quality goes, everything was good. The unagi, ahi, hamachi and smoked salmon nigiri were delicious. Rolls are big and if you're placing your last order they allow half orders. We tried the 007, Snow Rabbit, White House, and the DJ.

Me and a girlfriend would always come here for good sushi when Sushi Kaya down in Chinatown started to fall off (they've recovered) and Sushi Bomb was always so good! Something happened recently where they took a lot of the rolls I loved, off the menu. We would always go inside and eat for lunch or dinner. It was a hit or miss. The food was always on point which is great, but the service in there was always horrid. Sometimes we'd wait 15 minutes before our waters were refilled in a restaurant of only 3 small filled tables. Unacceptable 
There was even a day when every single table was not bussed of the previous diner's dishes that we had no choice but to sit at the bar and then new customers wouldn't have anywhere to sit! It was gross being surrounded by plates and half eaten food. 

So, I started getting it to go. The food was still good I just didn't want to deal with the in house situation. Well they've managed to disappoint me there too. It's always hard to order take out when the restaurant doesn't have a website or a current menu posted anywhere online. I always a specific roll and the past three times they've forgotten the sauce that goes on top. Last time they also forgot the ginger and wasabi. (which I actually use) 

NOW, all that being said, I somehow still recommend it. They've expanded their menu a bit and have a lot of options besides just sushi. Good to take kids to, people that don't like raw fish, and good for groups. Maybe it's just the time I go, but it looks look a couple staff members may have changed. BUT if you do take out, I'd recommend that you tell them to keep your food in a fridge because they will leave it right at the register if you show up 15, 20, or 30 minutes after it's prepared. Raw fish+room temp= a big no no.",7gSwABACGPVrRvWlO5ORGA,1,0,3,RmocWciwgNBAzaGCDcfF0w

Prices are compatible to others, and I feel the decor, speed and most importantly-the fresh taste of the fish make this one of the best values at the price point.
I like that they offer a kids AYCE menu AND a separate kids entree menu so my four year old can find something she wants.
One part of AYCE is that a lot of places, the rolls begin to taste very similar unless you stretch to the far corners of the menu.  Not do at Sushi Bomb, each roll had its own distinct flavor that did not disappoint.  
I recommend the namesake roll, the Sushi Bomb as well as the White House roll.  My wife is a fan of the Coconut Lover.
The service was quick and friendly.

Good not great as tasted a little fishy. Then we shared a few rolls... The hulk, rabbit pearl and who love long time were really good (big fan spicy tuna or spicy rolls in general). He got the Mexican lasagna... It was good but I'm not a yum yum fan but he really liked it! 
For $20 you are better off doing ayce than buying even two rolls for lunch! And sharing is perfect as get to taste more variety! 
The service varied, she kept our glasses full and was good about bringing more ginger as we both really like it. The chef however seemed a little slow as 20 min later we had everything but one roll and he was kind of snippy saying its coming when we asked.

The saddest part of my visit was that they no longer have the all you can drink draft beer as an add on for all you can eat.  To be honest that's one of the main reasons we would all come here, because who wants to pay $7 for ONE beer when you can pay $4.99 for all you can drink draft Sapporo?! Nobody, that's who! 

Needless to say, I probably won't be frequenting this location anymore. There's plenty of other good sushi restaurants with cheaper AYCE and alcohol specials.

2811912,2012-07-10,12,tCYAxj5_pV4RnDpe3_5VpA,"Ok so before I go on with this review, I need to tell you first that I am not too much into sushi except for your basic California rolls. With that said, what I always wanted to do was try ALL types of sushi. My reasoning is that why try different types and pay for each roll. What if I dont like that roll? So the best answer was to do an all you can eat! Pay one price and try everything! Well everything that you can eat anyway. I heard if you have leftovers they charge you. So my plan was to go with friends and team up!

So, this place has a buy 2 all you can eat, get one free! Split the bill three ways and you're set! They have this special I think starting at 9 pm. Call them for more details.

Now for the food. OMG! First of all, I didnt know there were lots of different sushi combinations and they all have different names. For this place you got sexual inuendos as names. How fitting for a sushi virgin. Names like sex on the beach, ex boyfriend/girlfriend, and 69 are just some of the options. Hay, im not making this up! I tried a lot of different rolls my friends ordered. Of course we were not able to order everything. 

Service was good. I didnt have any thing out of the ordinary to complain about. We got what we ordered in a timely manner. Refills were constant. Our server answered all my questions quickly and even had some suggestions. 

Everything I tried seemed really good. I didnt even bother trying to read what each individual roll consisted of. With the help of my friends, all the selections were really good. I think the next time I will be more assertive in picking my own rolls. For now, this experience was well worth it and I can take it off my bucket list.

So if you have any favorites or suggestions for me, (heck, even a recommendation for another sushi place is welcome so I can compare is fine with me) feel free to send me a message!

3015242,2010-05-04,3,tCYAxj5_pV4RnDpe3_5VpA,"Based on reviews from fellow yelpers, I wanted to find a different place to eat sushi for evening other than my usual sushi bar.  Since this place is somewhat near our house, we stopped in for an early dinner.

The bar area is quite nice, overall decor very comforting and natural.  I loved the fact that the place was basically all ours for the hour we were there.  The menu is great--simple and with some great options done differently.  Their amaebi, for example, includes the deep fried fish heads along with the two pieces of sushi.  I personally love sucking on a few shrimp heads, because that's where all the flavor is.  It was great.

We ordered all the yakitori skewers, 4 types, and it came with 2 skewers each.  Thinking they were the small yakitori, we didn't think it would be a lot to order for dinner. Oh my.  These skewers are pretty big, so majority of our dinner were the appetizers.  It was great!  The sauce was yummy and the meats were cooked well.  As for the shrimp ones, I didn't eat the shrimp.  I feel that shrimp should ALWAYS be cleaned because that black line is poop, and I don't eat poop.  That was a no-no for me, and therefore a deduction of 1 star on my review.

As for the rest, we tried their sushi, all perfectly portioned and the fish was great.  Their sauces are very good at this restaurant, everything from their cucumber salad, tempura dip, to the sauce they put on their yellowtail.  Oh and their tempura is crispy and light, too.  We loved it.

I think this place, despite its location being right next to the 215 on W. Cheyenne, is a really good sushi bar.  We plan to go back this week to try the rest of the menu.  If you want a road trip within city limits, try this place.  I know that they serve the same special rolls as any other sushi bar, but their sauces and talent make for a great night.  Plus their website says that it's 20% off after 9pm to midnight.  

Great sushi, excellent service, and I'll definitely be back for more.",o68A_3bAJTge-ioGXHdxKA,8,6,4,sNBGxzSdlt22SypUXdAc7A

Anytime someone asks where we like to eat sushi, we always say here. We have had nothing but great service time and time again, until tonight. We wanted a seat for three, wait time was told 20-30 minutes- which was fine. They were busy, but we were first in line for a table. About 10 minutes later a woman and her child came in requesting specifically to sit at the bar because a table was going to take too long. Watching one couple finish their desert we knew our time was coming! (Yay!- right?!) waitress sat the woman and her child at our table. I asked and all I got was an ""I'm so sorry"" nothing. Nothing. Waited a few more minutes before deciding to get with two other strangers and share the six top that had been empty long before we walked in. 

Once seated we ordered drinks and our first round of food. Everything was great until after we noticed our second round of plates were empty and we had nothing left to eat. 45 minutes later we finally received our plate of nigiri and last roll. Not once during our meal were we asked if we would like to order, if we needed more drinks or how everything was. I ended up talking them into only charging me for two all you can eat and one single roll since my sister ordered the one roll that took over an hour to make and didn't eat anything else nor did she want to order more after sitting at the table watching us eat for an hour. 

$87 later and I'll be honest, I didn't leave a tip. This truly breaks my heart to have had this experience at our (previously) favorite sushi restaurant. 

I've worked in the food industry before, and I think a little communication and organization such as sections for a specific server so they're not all tending to every table would do a long way.

Service was friendly and prompt, and my water were refilled consistently. I ended up ordering a roll, an appetizer, and a miso soup, but realized that my items' cost added up already exceeded the all-you-can-eat (AYCE) price (~$21+tax). Thus, I decided to switch to the AYCE dining option, which includes most of the menu (except some that are excluded, some that are dinner-only, and some that you can only order once).

I was very satisfied with the value once I chose AYCE, as I was able to add several other items to my meal. To the restaurant's credit, food preparation and service was very fast, such that I was able to have a full AYCE meal in just 30 minutes (I originally did not plan to order AYCE since I had such limited time). FYI, the time limit for AYCE lunch is usually 50 minutes.

This location is a bit far from home, but if I'm ever in the area, I would consider returning for their AYCE specials! See my photos for details about what I ate.

P.S. This place is Korean-owned with Korean employees and even occasional Korean pop music playing, but no one said this was an authentic Japanese restaurant. I still enjoyed my meal here and would recommend this place.",lQCY0csLfjdDn6cdVq43UA,0,0,4,LEPZg7AXyDbVaXk-0Dd87w

The salmon nigiri is perfectly marbled and fresh it just melts in my stomach. They let you order half rolls which is just enough for tasting everything on the menu.

Now on to the review.  Maybe my expectations were high because of their location or the price I saw on their dinner AYCE (all you can eat) at $27 but I was dissapointed.  I ordered my usual nigiri first and I got three orders of tuna, two orders of salmon, one order of garlic tuna, one order of scallops to start.  They were out of Uni!  I would rather they be out of uni rather than serve me some bad or foul uni like some other places.  When they brought out my nigiri, all of them were on the same plate which meant the garlic tuna sauce contaminated the rice on the other nigiri.

While my friend and I were eating, I noticed that they kept the rolls and other nigiri on a counter and wouldn't deliver the food you ordered out right away.  I think they were trying to keep a nice eating tempo but I'd rather they bring all of the dish out right away, especially if they were baked or hot orders!  Have to take a star off for that.

The server didn't take our order on a piece of paper so we didn't get all the rolls or items we ordered.  That's why I like how some places have those papers where you can jot down what you want.  Another dissapointment.  

Mind you there were only 2 other customers at the time so I expected service to be immaculate.  As far as the nigiri goes, I think they noticed that I caught on to the amount of rice that was given and they used a dab too much rice vinegar.  On my second order of nigiri, I had two orders of tuna, one order of salmon, sweet shrimp, oysters (you can only have one order), and two orders of salmon roe.  The portions were finally the way I liked it with the fish covering the rice and not the rice looking like a nice comfy bean bag for my fish to sleep comfortably on.  The freshness of the fish is good, they've got that right.  

After I eat about 30 pieces of nigiri I go on to the rolls, but I like to order half rolls which I've been spoiled by other sushi places that allow it.  They don't allow it here.  So take note of that!  They have some funny names for their rolls.  I ordered two rolls (which could have been 4 half rolls...) and one of them being some secret eel roll which I did not enjoy at all because the center was spicy tuna.  I thought it would have been all eel.  My friend ordered some other roll which had a puffy creamy ball top which was bland.  I had to help her clean up her rolls because she didn't enjoy it.  We were actually thankful that they didn't get our orders right because the rolls were not headed towards the right direction.  I had one good roll which had a shrimp tempura middle but I would have rather ordered 10 more pieces of nigiri instead of that eel secret special roll.  

You can only order one dessert per AYCE and even though I had great company and we still had a great time eating okay food.  They have drink specials and one other thing they have going for them is the beer special that accompanies the AYCE.  Drinking wise this place would be the bomb.",k4M43lXJuQMpQW65DTqzIQ,6,2,2,m8-hp4iCG_XRRvon7F9N0g

I gotta be honest though, out of all the various rolls we ate...I cannot remember the names of any of them!  I forgot to take a good pic of the actual menu!  All I can tell you is the night the wifey & I were at Sushi Bomb we ate good.  Stuffed to the gills good.

While Sushi Bomb is not one of my top places for AYCE sushi, it's up there with a more than enjoyable place to go.  We went for dinner on a Friday night (payday, yay), and even at 8 PM the place was lively with a lot of patrons...lots of kids too!

I know it's not considered KOSHER, but my favorite AYCE sushi restaurants are the ones that also offer a number of non-sushi appetizers to go with dinner.  Not traditional, but I like having a break from the endless amounts of rice that come your way with ordering sushi roll after sushi roll.  Some of the apps we tried:

-Chilean Sea Bass (daily special) - this was sooo good!
-Chicken Yakitori

As a rule of thumb - for sushi rolls at an AYCE place we usually stick to the higher priced items on the menu.  Why get a Cali Roll from the menu if you really don't have to?  Come on...live a little!  Try that soft shell crab!  Get some crispy salmon skin!  Sample that extra spicy tuna!  We got a nice selection of Sushi Bomb's special rolls, tempura rolls, chef special rolls, and baked rolls.  

Honestly, from what I remember they were all tasty!  I know it doesn't help that it wasn't all that memorable, but at least for us the quality was there.  The rice to fish ratio was on spot, there wasn't too much rice.  And their sushi rice was very good too - not gummy or overly sticky.  For myself, I love those baked rolls.  Something about the warm mayo mix that comes from under the salamander, just makes a roll delicious.  Wifey on the other hand though hates warm mayo with a passion...ha ha ha!

AYCE also comes with a dessert per person.  But this was pretty forgettable because the desserts we got were not on par with the food earlier:

-Honey Toast
-Tempura Banana

 If you see the pictures, both desserts look the same!  Covered in a scoop of vanilla ice cream with chocolate drizzle.  The Honey Toast was terrible!  It literally was a Hawaiian sweet bread roll cut in half and baked for a few minutes to make it somewhat toasty.  The Tempura Banana wasn't much better, heavy on the batter and thin on the banana.  I would skip dessert the next time or just get a scoop of ice cream to finish the meal.

Dinner is about $28 a person before tax, average with other AYCE sushi places in town.  Service was OK, but a bit rushed I think because for the AYCE you are limited to 1 hour.  There was enough time though to order another round of rolls though so I wouldn't worry too much unless you have a huge party.

We'll give Sushi Bomb another try...next time I'll be sure to remember all those rolls!",QCtHk02W_Asu2LFfdmGQDA,4,5,3,ApFocpZWbx6m6vOYxl1U1A

When we arrived we were the only people in the entire place. The hostess/waitress was friendly and efficient. Since it was 'his place' I let my boss order some things to get us started. He went with an order of edamame, some eggrolls and this fried jalapeno thing, I can not recall the name but it was like a popper, deep fried and stuffed with cream cheese. 

The edamame was perfect, a nice large portion with just enough salt. The eggrolls were also good, on the small side but thats ok because I didn't want to get full on appetizers. I never eat jalapenos, but after some arm twisting I gave these a try... Was glad I did because they were not hot at all. 

For the rest of our meal we decided on the the bj, the I love tuna and vegas rolls. Everything tasted great, the tuna tasted very fresh. The Vegas roll was my favorite, mmm cream cheese.

I've come here a couple times for late night AYCE ($27). Being that you can order ANYTHING off of the menu and the chalkboard specials and it's all under the AYCE umbrella, that's a pretty great deal. Some of their menu items included hamachi kama and okinomiyaki. 

I really feel like the true testament to the nuts of a sushi place is in their nigiri. Find out what you wanna know ... it's in his fish. Anyways, the nigiri was kind of wussy, thin pieces of fish. Nothing exceptional, but also nothing catastrophic. 

I think it's worth mentioning that all of the employees are Korean. There were three parties at the bar and no one else in the restaurant. The THREE sushi chefs behind the bar seemed to have trouble keeping up with orders. 

The waiter boy isn't like a beck and call kind of guy. If you really want something, you'll have to stare at the back of his head for a bit.

We were eating and enjoying our food with our companies - not loud,  not picky, or being a trouble maker. Other two severs,  a young boy and a young girl,  are great through - taking care of drinks and emtry plates away with great customer service. Food is all right. 

After we ordered the 2nd round,  the attitude fat asian server, she came and said ''oh you know the policy right! (Look at my friend) yeah,  you know. We charge for left over"" Then walked away! We were looking at each other like,  ""what was that!"" But we did not think it was a big deal. 

After the 2nd round of food were served, we were eating. Then she stopped for the second time and said,  ""you must eat all of rice too!"" Then walked away.  What?!?!  Really!!!,  she needed to do that again. We did not ask your policy or had a lot of food on the plate! Now, we felt like she hated us for a reason as we were specificlly threaten to charge more. 

FYI: we finished the 1st set of order and were still eating our 2nd round of food. It is normal that some rice or ingredients were dropped on the plate as some sushi is loose or too big to the mouth. We did not have bunch of rice or food left over in the plate neither. We have been eating all you can eat sushi at many restuarants in Las Vegas and many cities for years and never had a server came and thread us in my whole life. This was a wow... 

She might be a manager or partner so she has a ball to say that to us. It is very rude and inappropriate!! If she would charge me for a piece of rice,  go head and I don't mind to pay. If I don't have money to spend,  i wouldn't go there and eat at your restaurant. Don't need to be attitude and thread a customer like this!

My glass sat empty for 28 minutes but I couldn't give this place lower than three stars because the food even though the customer service was atrocious.,D4VDDuxnjjOjH9KhrBTjtw,0,0,3,FsWMBFNCDzXu5UkXjRoR5w
4683407,2013-03-25,0,tCYAxj5_pV4RnDpe3_5VpA,"I came back to edit my post. I had an extremely negative comment about how they had a waiter that was mean to the customers and that I wouldn't be returning because of his service. However, since then they have fired that waiter and the restaurant has done a complete 180.

They have always had good food, no one every doubted that, but their service was rude. Now the service is great and you can actually enjoy the food! Sometimes the rolls can be a little too big and hard to eat, but my boyfriend asked if they could make them a little smaller so they were easier to eat and they happily did, it came out with more pieces that were smaller so it was the same amount of food. 

I'm sure we'll be back a lot because they are extremely close by and we do love their sushi, and now that they have fixed the service issue nothing gets in the way of enjoying that food.

No one waiting in front of us but the restaurant was clearing from a lunch rush
The waiter told us it would only be a few minutes for tables to clear, which he was right, but they ignored us and we didn't get sat until 1:57 even though tables had been empty for over 10 minutes
2 more parties came in while we were waiting and we all got sat simultaneously, however the last party got their drinks first and we were completely ignored.
While waiting I also witnessed the waiter deliver the wrong roll to 2 wrong tables, and when he realized his mistake he picked up the rolls from the wrong tables and served them to the correct people
We left after waiting at the table and when I called them to let them know what happened the tall waitress answered and said she couldn't help us because it wasn't her section.

As any good server would, Paul immediately checked if we all had a setting, gave us menus and took our drink orders. Looking at the menu (each roll roughly priced around $12) AYCE is definitely the way to go.

When Paul came back with our waters and drinks he asked if he could get any appetizers started. We ordered the Garlic Edamame (amazing! Probably the best I've had at a AYCE place), Cold Tofu Salad (comes with a great and tasty sauce), cucumber salad, sea weed salad and oysters. Unfortunately after taking our order and putting it in, Paul had to come back to let us know that they ran out of oysters. It would have been nice for him to let us know before hand. He did recommend other alternatives and his favorites, which I appreciated. 

We ordered many rolls but my top favorites were:
1.) coconut lovers roll
2.) salmon lovers roll
3.) BBQ rib roll
4.) Baja yellowtail roll
5.) Sushi bomb roll

5035035,2012-03-31,0,tCYAxj5_pV4RnDpe3_5VpA,"Hello Again!  I have written a review about Sushi Bomb before (back in Nov 2011), but this time, I have to say, I won't be going back :(  The last review I gave them was 4 out of 5...Only a 4 cause of how slow the service was during lunch.  

My friends and I dined there last night (March 30, 2012).  It was a Friday evening and it was another couple and our son who is 1yr 1/2 old.  

So our bad journey began with slow service and a very very rude waitress.  I should have gotten her name (there are only a few servers that work there - she was the slightly older skinnier Asian lady server.  The younger one with wavy hair was very very nice!  

Our bill was over $170 - All you can eat and drinks.  So for paying this kind of money at any restaurant for 4 people, would EQUAL = = = = GREAT SERVICE!  Wrong.  Our reservations was for 7:15.  We did not get out of the restaurant until after 10pm.  This was not our choice because our son was ready long LONG before.  I told my friends that our lunch service was slow and given that the restaurant seemed busy, I suggested that we try and order all your rolls at one time.  We ordered most or rolls so we didn't have to wait as long.  However, we needed a couple more.  I guess when you order more after the first round, you will have to wait cause others will be priority over you... or so it seemed.  

When I told the guy (Host-with a girly kind of hair cut-not trying to be mean, just didn't get his name and that's the only way I could describe him) who said he is the manager, his explanation was and I quote ""the first round of sushi you probably had a fast sushi chef and they are all different, this time, you probably had a slower sushi chef and his speed is slower than the first guy that made your food""   :o  WHAT??   

We waited over 40minutes from when we ordered a couple more rolls before they came out (after a couple complaints too).

The server would barely ask us what we wanted nor did she seem happy to be there.  She was in a bad mood.  I totally get it, we all have bad days and we have busy days too that can drive us to the ground, but when the economy is the way it is (people seem to be pickier about where to eat or spend their money on), then I think customer service is going to help any business fail or succeed.  Bottom line, we should not have been treated the way we did.  

-We asked for waters twice.
-We waited over 15 min. for her to take our order the first time.
-We had to keep asking for refills 
-We asked for 2 cucumber salads in the beginning and never got them - until about almost 10pm cause they new at this point we were upset - we even said never mind on the cucumber salads 
-We were treated horribly by our server the entire night (with the exception of the Host/Manager & that other server that tried to make it better) 
-Our rolls the second time took over 40min. to come out - we did not order anything different than the last time, with the exception of us ordering only 3 rolls - lot less than the first round

Unfortunately, because of all the series of events that happened last night with the slow service and the extremely rude server, etc. etc. Our entire group will not go back.  There are far more sushi places that would deserve our time/money than this place.  

I do not recommend this place to anyone with kids or anyone that wants to leave within less than 2 hours, especially for dinner.

I do have to say the best roll there is Sex on the Beach.  
The all you can drink Sapporo for $3.99 is a good deal.  
Make a reservation!!  We did and it helped but there were people waiting outside.
Unfortunately for us, all of these things though will not help us go back.  I rather drive all the way to ""I Love Sushi"" in Henderson that isn't an all you can eat and pay just as much or a little more because I know they are deserving of my business.  

I hope someone from Sushi Bomb reads this because I hope you improve on your customer service!! 

Just a side note: We tried to tip the other nice server (cause she started to help us a little more at the end) and she said they all have to share the money - community tips.  Where is the incentive to do better and be a better server and treat people better?  There really isn't with this type of tipping service.  

Overall bad time and we all left frustrated.  Our night didn't end well and that's not right.  :(

We waited about 5 minutes and still no menu. So a total of 15 maybe 20 minutes no drinks bought to us and still no menu. As we got up to walk out she stood there and watched us leave.

My favorite roll here? The ""Tonight"" roll! Nice & spicy the way i like it.

They give you very big servings on sushi and sashimi. All you can eat lunch for $19.99.  Very easy to get full on just two sets of rolls here. Sonny our waiter (might be the manager too) is a very friendly guy and so are the other staff which you can regularly yelling out your order loud with heavy japanese accents.

All their special rolls are pretty tasty so you can't really go wrong with any choices.  But the common rolls, such as the california roll are no better than what you usually get from other sushi restaurants. I recommend going with a group of friends and order different specialty rolls so you all can have the chance to try different ones.

AYCE lunch is around $20, with an AYCD option for $5! I had 3 Sapporo drafts, at about $1.50 a piece!

Most of the fish tasted fresh, some with great flavor actually! A few seemed a little dry and not quite as fresh, but I only noticed that on some of the nigiri.  Pic : http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sushi-bomb-las-vegas?select=53bUbCJxe5R69uRhPbJX7Q#53bUbCJxe5R69uRhPbJX7Q

I really enjoyed the Sake Kama here!  They don't include the Hamachi kama in the AYCE, so the salmon had to tide me over! Had a great taste...better than most actually!  Probably the highlight of the lunch for me :)  Pic : http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sushi-bomb-las-vegas?select=GityQ5CHwRvSUC36LtnJIA#GityQ5CHwRvSUC36LtnJIA

The rolls were great, with my most favorite being the Rabbit Pearl : Shrimp Tempura, Spicy Crab and Cucumber topped with Spicy Crab, Shrimp and Avocado...Spicy ponzu sauce and crunch!  This was easily the best roll we tried in my eyes! Perfect amount of spice and flavor!

And of course, to finish for dessert...they had Honey Toast! Of course I had to try it...a few choices of ice cream, but the Green Tea actually had lots of tea flavor and was yummy! The toast itself was good, plenty of honey...and was overall a good choice!  Pic : http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sushi-bomb-las-vegas?select=Hz0hOXgNhwsPJNsuJA0GKA#Hz0hOXgNhwsPJNsuJA0GKA

--it used to be fantastic. 

The music was fun, and they even had a ladies night and they were open till 3 AM with a reverse happy hour into the late hours. It was phenomenal .

...not only have we spent birthdays and numerous graduations since they opened obviously they have changed hands since then. 

The food has always been good the service always has been impeccable and it's always been quite comfortable. 

Until today. Someone formerly mentioned in our review recently that the service is all over the place and indeed it is. I sat down as I waited for my son to join me who was coming straight from work I was there about five minutes and barely had a sip of my water when I was approached by one of the head waiters and asked when my ""party or a partner or friend"" was arriving. I had barely put my purse down. I told him soon in about two minutes later my son arrived.
Said waiter came back and took her order the food arrived promptly which was great and it was also delicious barely a bite into my salmon skin hand roll , which was greasy.and mediocre at best, and the waiter appeared again asking ""what else were having for our second round,"" ...well I have a full mouth of food and have barely started enjoying my dinner, so I don't know if there will be a second round .... I just want to enjoy my dinner and the company I am with. 

He obviously has had no social skills or tact when he waits on tables he was quite rude and pushy and honestly I have to say this is been happening for quite a while I've had this chubsy waiter before and he was pretty much a jerk ....there was about six people waiting on us.

It definitely doesn't have that personal neighborhood flare that it used to have. it almost seems like a assembly line of sushi which is really disappointing because I remember what it used to be like when it first opened. Which is really too bad because this is around the corner from my house and it really used to be our place to go. I thunk Sishi Kota has won over my business. It's far but I feel appreciated and don't mind paying for great service and great food, I work hard and deserve both.  Do t we all?",65GBa_-D4kD1MFJeyLfbeg,0,0,3,Qno3LOzoTgzGSp4NYgU8OA

5361444,2011-07-18,0,tCYAxj5_pV4RnDpe3_5VpA,"**Summary**
       - Freshness - The freshness is around average.
       - Rice - All the nigiri has way too much rice in them. Anytime I see that, I wonder what other corners the establishment is cutting.
       - Service - The sushi chefs were nice, but the waitress had an attitude problem that day. It was almost as if she was scolding me for not knowing that I had to order mussels and other items from the sushi chefs and not her. Furthermore, she never processed my dynamite order.
       - Originality - This place has a lot of rolls I've never seen including the Stuffed Tomatoes and This Guy roll.
       - Rules - They have more rules than your average sushi joint and some weird names for their sushi (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tCYAxj5_pV4RnDpe3_5VpA?select=4r09Hm_dz_GKp_GSKIkYvg).
**Price**
       - $19.95 Lunch AYCE Open - 3:30pm
       - $26.95 Dinner AYCE 3:30pm - Close
**Ordered**
       - This Guy Roll (Tuna & Avocado Roll with a Spicy Soft-Shell Crab Ball with Spicy Garlic Ponzu Sauce) - The ball of spicy soft-shell crab was nice (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tCYAxj5_pV4RnDpe3_5VpA?select=j8FE2cjU71vIaKhWHD6M9A).
       - Stuffed Tomatoes (Imitation Crab Meat, Avocados, Shrimp, wrapped with Salmon with Orgasm Sauce) - No rice in this roll. The sauce was a bit too creamy though (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tCYAxj5_pV4RnDpe3_5VpA?select=-z1r1fRYJV98K71-ySmxXQ).
       - Golden Dragon (Eel and Spicy Tuna on the inside topped with more Eel) - The eel and spicy tuna center made this roll feel like I was eating baby food (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tCYAxj5_pV4RnDpe3_5VpA?select=SuFaUOaT7v_pAr0E-JubIA).
       - Grilled Bacon & Scallop Skewer - This was a great skewer with eel sauce to top it (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tCYAxj5_pV4RnDpe3_5VpA?select=A9yP1_X_Z0jmV9eu1fuRWQ).
       - Grilled Shrimp w/ Vegi Skewer - The shrimp were pretty tiny, but it was good (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tCYAxj5_pV4RnDpe3_5VpA?select=l5AhXwmWFLr6zxHGrcNmMg).
       - Nigiri - The sushi wasn't the freshest I've had in Vegas, but it was decent. However, the sushi is to rice ratio is pretty bad (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tCYAxj5_pV4RnDpe3_5VpA?select=o34ITC4o8tVbZ2Njh8VUmQ).
       - Sushi Salad (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tCYAxj5_pV4RnDpe3_5VpA?select=MSAhVq4gwgC_RyxERv0xlw)
       - Baked Green Mussels - They used some kind of sour sauce instead of eel sauce that made the mussels taste terrible. This was the first time I didn't finish a mussels on my plate ever.
**Recommendations**
       - If skewers and rolls are what you're looking for, this place isn't too bad. However, if you're thinking of ordering nigiri, you're probably better off going elsewhere.",37S80IUIfb8yMsSwWWDsFA,5,1,3,GGrGMo-4n84Pwy5-Znhd0A

You DEFINITELY get your money's worth doing the Ayce because you can pretty much get anything on the menu. Teriyaki chicken.. dessert.. The first time we went it was at 11 30 & service was great. The second time we went it was 12 &  got EXTREMELY busy.The problem was that there was only ONE SERVER.  Why have one server at lunch time? He was absolutely overwhelmed.

That's why I sit at the bar, so you can order the moment you're ready to eat again, and not wait on the waitress. Also, they seem to be understaffed every time I go there.

They don't take reservations but you can call and tell them what time you'll be there and they'll put your name down at that time so we didn't have to wait too long. That was cool. 

It is one of the more expensive all-you-can-eat prices at $27 but they did have a great selection and the sushi was fresh and tasty unlike some AYCE places. They also had on a daily special a Chilean sea bass ,it was amazing. Sucked that we didn't notice it till after we were full but we ordered it anyways. Couldnt pass that up. They also have, if you get the AYCE, Sapporo on draft for $3! 

Our service was good. And the people were nice. The only reason why I'm giving it 4 stars is because it was freezing in there. they said it was something about keeping the fish Fresh,which we were like, well why is it any other sushi place freezing then? It did end up getting turned down halfway through our meal. Thank goodness.  Also, the music was  quite loud making it hard to hear each other.

We tried Coconut Lover, Love Affair, Sushi Bomb, Japanese Lasagna, Mojave Beach, bacon & scallop skewers, nigiri (tuna, Cajun albacore, salmon, & eel), shrimp tempura, miso soup, and baked green mussels. Everything was delicious. Our absolute favorite was hands down the Coconut Lover. My husband fell in love with it! The nigiri was delicious and fresh. The baked green mussels were PERFECT! Miso soup was just the way my dad makes it - so delicious. And all you can eat bacon & scallop skewers? BOMB! My second favorite is definitely a tie between Love Affair and Mojave Beach!

I think they have very good specialty rolls, and there is a lot of selection available to you. I also really like that I can order half orders of rolls when doing AYCE to that I can sample more types of rolls.  
They have a good selection of everything you could need/want for a sushi night.
