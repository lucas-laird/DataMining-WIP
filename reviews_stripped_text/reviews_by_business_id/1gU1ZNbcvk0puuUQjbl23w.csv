1131699,2018-05-15,1,1gU1ZNbcvk0puuUQjbl23w,"For Mother's Day, I wanted to check this place out since I remember always going to a Sushi Factory by W. Tropicana over 5+ years ago, but it closed down. Not sure if these are the same owners? Nonetheless, this is located where Cheeburger Cheeburger used to be. 

The reason I gave it a 3-star was for the service. Customer service is a huge deal to me. Treat others how you wanted to be treated, right? As we walked in, we had to stand at the front counter looking confused because no one acknowledged or greeted us right away. After awhile, I initiated myself to ask if we just seat ourselves or...? which prompted the girl to seat us. 

We waited about 20 mins until we were asked about our drinks AND another 7 mins after to take our order. I'm not sure if the server (male) was overwhelmed that day or having a bad day, because he seemed impatient with us ordering a whole bunch of appetizers and rolls. Waited another 20-25 mins, and found out the ticket order for our side dishes and sushi rolls got lost, so the server had to retake our order again. At this point, I felt a little irritated of course and disappointed since it felt like we were not valued customers by this guy. Here I am, trying to be humble and give him the benefit of the doubt that he's just overwhelmed. One thing after another, we were charged dinner all you can eat prices when we technically  arrived at 1:50 pm. They corrected that and comped 1 Ayce for us (thank you). 

Aside from our experience, the quality of sushi was great. I enjoyed the nigiri and special rolls. Our favorite roll so far is the ""Big Easy Special."" Def recommend. Also, the coconut shrimp tempura was de-lish. We are still willing to try Sushi Factory again, maybe just not on a holiday.",8NPnK5h5Te91Ot6nbX9a5g,1,1,3,nMV7AuZCwt1xJdjfb6Se-w

As busy as it was i still enjoyed this sushi spot a lot. The nigiri was good and the fish was fresh. They also have dishes like the sashimi salad that are excellent. 

We had to wait awhile for the food but it was understandable because of the 2 for 1 special they had running for the grand opening.",EelywBGGun1tqQVtGWpGHw,3,2,5,4XaP-Vre9AKQJnC9Jblhqg

We decided to try this sushi spot because my yelp notifications kept bugging me to check it out, lol. So we did and we're so happy that we chose to have our dinner here!! All of the staff are welcoming, kind and patient with their customers and the service is also super fast with the orders as well as 
refilling drinks :) we came in around 6:30p so obviously we were expecting a wait and to our surprise it wasn't crazy busy at all considering it is a Friday night! Sushi portion size is PERFECT, not too much rice as most ayce spots will cover the rolls with a 2 inch layer of rice, wtf!! The fish quality is also one of the best I've had in this town, it's so soft/tender and doesn't have a strange after taste. So happy this place opened up because most of the sushi places down on rainbow are over priced and so over crowded that the food isnt really worth the wait, We'll most definitely be back!!",PInuPmGeROXJFKunA8Ba-w,1,0,5,1ZaYWN_CRCh4z9sUZxisKw

To get there and be told that the 2 for 1 that was advertised for Mon- Fri had ended on Wed, since I drove 30 min to get there still decided to try it. There was 2 ppl at the bar, 1 table of 2, and my party of 3...the wait time was long the first person to order at my table was the last person to get their food. They were out of a few items I tried to order, the waiter was not too familiar with the menu and they only had 1 flavor of mochi.

1701347,2018-03-23,3,1gU1ZNbcvk0puuUQjbl23w,"Nothing draws a crowd quite like BOGO grand opening offers- see opening week reviews for H20 and Zero Degrees for some context. In short, if you build it (and discount it, and advertise it on Facebook), they will come, en masse. I was able to take advantage of their opening offer with Tony T and Chris V, who graciously allowed me to crash their party even though I didn't wait on site (using the time instead to hit a nearby gym). Foodie Friendship Goals!

In short, Sushi Factory was pretty average for AYCE in Vegas. Fish quality was okay, with nigiri sliced a hair thicker than elsewhere rather than paper thin as experienced at other openings. Unfortunately, a lot of the fish was flavorless and bland, and the rice was both falling apart and lacked any discernible vinegar notes. But they make up for it with some standout dishes like the Spicy Tuna Tartare stacks (they also have a salmon version), Coconut Shrimp, and a carpaccio dish. I also appreciate their selection of hand rolls and riceless rolls, as this is a place where those who stick to nigiri are likely to be dissatisfied. Their dessert menu is very limited, but that's not what I come here for anyway.

Service was fair, considering they were predictably busy with lines literally out the door with a 2 hour wait. Other reviews mention limited servers and slow speeds but I didn't experience anything distressing. Typical new-business kinks coupled with large crowds should be met with at least some modicum of understanding by customers who opt to come in under those circumstances, which is why my rating is rounded up instead of down.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,13,7,4,O33pjU_z1aehcb4CAg5vlA

I got there at 6pm and there were already 2 hour wait time. Good thing they say they will call us when it's ready. Long story short, we were seated around 2.5 hours later. 

We got seated by the bar so we got lucky cos the chef is there to take our order real quick. So I'll give the chef 5 stars. 

But the waiters and waitresses need more training and need to organize more when it comes to taking orders. We ordered multiple things that took so long. Each time we double check with them they had no clue if the order was put or not. I'd give them 2 stars for trying.

Food quality is not bad. Taste is just as good or bad as other AYCE chains on rainbow. The honey bread was cool. Overall experience was just average for a newly open venue.",bvHu6kqz44z9obSCQDLPfQ,4,1,4,SqmgpyDUf_dNSBxLc36zPA

2410980,2018-04-17,0,1gU1ZNbcvk0puuUQjbl23w,"The short version: It's an AYCE spot in the Southwest, so I had to check it out. I had the Jose Special roll, a bunch of nigiri, some skewers, cucumber w/crab salad, and yuzu sorbet. Overall, I'd come back, but I'd be in no rush to. 

The long version:
Decor: 5/5 
Modern sleek. I'm feeling the vibe here down to the music. I feel like I should have had a glass of white wine. (They are waiting on their liquor license.)

Cleanliness: 5/5 
No complains. It was spotless. 

Food: 3.5/5
Everything was done well, but it wasn't mind-blowing or great. For the nigiri, I had garlic tuna, garlic salmon, and cajun albacore. All were very good. I also had the crab nigiri, which I'd call passable for AYCE. There was the halibut nigiri that I'd label as edible but a bit chewy. I'd never order that here again. On the skewer front, I tried the garlic and mushroom. Mushroom was good. Garlic was so-so. The only roll I had was the Jose Special (in: spicy crab, cucumber; top: cajun albacore, avocado; sauce: spicy ponzu, jalapeno). I enjoyed it. Pass on the gyoza. It's not great here. Cucumber with crab salad was okay but not memorable. Yuzu sorbet was more like a yuzu snow cone. That's not a bad thing. Just not what I was expecting. I loved it though. 

Service: 4/5
I sat at the sushi bar, and the sushi chef was definitely 5/5. The waitress was friendly and cleared plates. She just was not on top of the drinks, and I had to flag her down for kitchen orders after the first one. She gets 3/5.",PpaIA3DA_0Y_XpGHPxgjLg,3,0,4,2MTsSCpGg0-15vuQYv1HLw

They ended the BOGO promo which I thought was too ambitious to begin with so I didn't mind it, I came to try the quality of the sushi not the promo. I tried several apps including sashimi salad, screaming orgasm, and salmon tar tare. All were excellent but the screaming orgasm really stood out, a must have. Between myself and my gf, we tried the majority of the main nigiri choices. The fish quality was great, above average of most other ayce places. I really liked all the garlic options, the garlic tuna was outstanding (if you really love garlic, which I do).

(They had 2 tables available good for 6 each table at back. I don't understand why we have to wait almost an hour to be seated on one of the empty table I mentioned??) Anyway, moving forward, server took our orders on small pieces of paper. 1st roll came 2:35 pm. Our rolls and appetizers came one at a time... omg! 6 people are hungry and we have to share 1 roll or 1 appetizer at a time! I expected the wait time to be long due to the promo but i didn't expect the food to be served so slow! The food was awesome though! I loved the pork belly, spider roll, johnny, spicy edamame, hot tea.. i would have tried more but I had to leave without even getting my dessert due to time. My friends stayed and waited for the rest of the food. They said they had to cancel some of the other orders because it took sooo long! Even for water refill took forever! My friend had to grab the pitcher herself by the counter to refill our glasses.  In my opinion, they should have overstaffed than understaffed.  Servers should be organized. Got to forsee and be proactive since they advertised the promo. Would I try this place again? Probably because their food is good.

So usually I always go to ""Sapporo Revolving Sushi"" on Spring Mountain and Decatur.
But tonight we decided to check out this new place. But we got a horrible experience. 
- The Nigiri wasn't fresh at all. (Which it gave me stomachache right after I got home) and you can tell it wasn't fresh when you tasted it. 
- service was really really really slow.
- the server forgot his ""SMILE"" at home. 

I wish I could give this place 0 star. But the don't have that option. So i'll give it a 1. 
And also not recommend at all.

While our initial order came out within five or ten minutes it wasn't complete.  Subsequent orders took a long time or even forgotten. The restaurant was not too busy so we couldn't understand why the food came out so slowly.  We will attribute this to growing pains.

3373447,2018-04-05,0,1gU1ZNbcvk0puuUQjbl23w,"So I came here that grand opening day. I really did not want to be the one to write this review. Many people said they waited a long time like 2 hours or so. I expected this. It's fine. I was not upset about the wait at all. 

I only waited about an hour because I came at 4. I was expecting a wait and we had a party of 5. They were doing their bogo offer. My brother came Friday and I guess they weren't doing it anymore. 

Their food was not actually that bad. Their salmon was good and the oysters too. The salmon tartar I think was also really good. Their amaebi was a tad bit off. It wasn't that great. The uni's color was off too. But the scallops and super white was not bad. The rolls were alright too. I forgot which rolls we ordered. We were hungry and the food was coming slow. 

Don't get the tempura. Too much batter and it was soggy when it got to us. 

So why was this an awful experience? It truthfully was not the wait, the staff, or much of the food. It was specifically OUR server. Why?

He kept pouring cold tea. He kept forgetting to get our miso soup. We probably asked 6 times. He kept saying that the cooks know. However, we sat right by the kitchen and it's your server that's supposed to get it for you from the soup pot!! It was ridiculous. This guy was out of it!! When I asked for his attention he says yes? Then literally looks at you and walks away...

When we asked the other servers passing us, we got all our stuff literally right away if not immediately not too long after. The girl server who was at the station closest to the restroom helped us. The minute we asked for the miso soup, she went and grabbed it. Bam done. When we asked for hot tea, the tea was actually HOT. She was great. Our assigned or designated server AWFUL. He plain just looked inexperienced. Either that or didn't care. I get it you're stressed cuz it's busy, but that's the food industry... the other servers never dropped the ball like that...",XopP_70iyfC3iCPAY-sz4Q,4,2,1,_f0OBDzhH5qKAFVZPo1Kwg

Factory Service: The fact they take reservations is such a win as it's not as common as it should be.   Our server sat us in the biggest booth area to the left which sat 8 easily and can set around 10+ easily.  The sushi chefs get your sushi and non-sushi orders to the table under 10 minutes upon ordering.  They brought a full pot of tea for the tea drinkers and I never had to ask for a refill on my soft drink. Excellent

Factory Sushi:  Solid nigiri performance, here are my notables: If you dig garlic, hit up that garlic tuna. It's tasty here with a very strong garlic flavor.  You only get one order of the salmon belly but it's flavorful.  The surf clam and sea urchin is fresh.  The dragon roll was the lone roll I ordered and would order again. Mushroom lovers, try the monkey brain: Tempura mushroom, soft shell crab inside topped with a tasty mayo sauce.

Factory Ambiance:  I love the cherry blossom inspired tree that greets you upon entrance.  Japanese sushi house inspired decor with dark wood throughout the dining area makes for a nice dining experience.  There's a sushi bar for single diners and booths are efficiently placed to seat the maximum amount of patrons.

Sushi Factory is another great AYCE sushi option on the southwest side of town.  I enjoyed the non-sushi dishes I sampled and I'm looking forward to trying more, but that's another yelp tale.  Enjoy! =)",AyjqBovADgbskmLrIBOMlQ,2,3,4,pwHEPxOblcIud9z7qdQVFA
4107064,2018-03-22,4,1gU1ZNbcvk0puuUQjbl23w,"Read the following as a 3.5 star rating which I've only rounded up to counteract some ire by other reviewers who aren't as forgiving for factors that are clearly the result of running a special promotion.

Sushi Factory is a new all-you-can-eat (AYCE) sushi restaurant on Rainbow Blvd just south of the plaza which everybody knows is the home of the first Brew Tea Bar. A server mentioned that it's the sister restaurant of Sushi Way, which seems to have found success over on Paradise Rd (I've yet to go there myself), and they did seem better prepared than another AYCE sushi restaurant did with a grand opening promo. Parking wasn't crazy when I got there, and it shouldn't be too bad unless the neighboring Grand Sign Kitchen suddenly closes and reopens as something incredibly popular.

That promo, publicly posted at their restaurant and on social media, was a 2-for-1 deal. I'm not sure if lunch pricing was offered (regularly $21.95 pre-3pm), but we managed to get in for dinner (regularly $25.95, after 3pm). Yes, it drew lots of customers - so much so that they cut the promo short from 5 to 3 days. Fortunately, i was able to get in on the new last day. Unfortunately, I had to wait just shy of 2 hours to be seated. Fortunately, again, that means that I was really hungry when it was time to get down to business.

AYCE sushi places rarely dish out fish of excellent quality, but most places in Las Vegas do a pretty good job. I generally had okay fish on my nigiri here, but nothing really great, much less surprisingly wonderful. The salmon was the most delicious, while everything else was on the bland side. To be fair, I didn't plumb the depths of the nigiri menu, so maybe I missed something good. Do note that the fresh scallop was surprisingly OK despite being bay scallop (the smaller kind) instead of sea scallop. The rice was a bit sketchy, with some dry grains here and there and not all that much vinegary flavor.

There were a few standouts. The spicy tuna tartare was a fun layered dish: a little avocado sandwiched between thick layers of spicy tuna and the imitation crabstuffs of California rolls, and all of it obviously composed in a ring mold. The coconut shrimp tempura was a fun variant which I've never seen on another AYCE sushi menu (I just checked Sushi Way's menu; it's there too, of course), and the sweet coconut was a welcome change. The baked green mussels weren't overly mayo'd up and actually had a gooey cheese topping. The Barbie Special was a great riceless roll, with cucumber and crunchy batter from the calamari tempura working textural wonders.

The one item which I'd outright skip next time is the sashimi salad. The diced salmon was good, but the tuna and other fish used were inferior, mushy bits. I would also take caution with the uni, but although the color was disturbingly tinged with black, the flavor was actually muted. Low brininess and an absence of anything off-putting are actually not the bottom of the barrel for AYCE-quality uni.

By the way, I also have this thing about really enjoying multiple desserts after my meal, and that's simply not an option here. Also, they only had ice cream available today. It was relatively solid, with creamy texture and decent vanilla flavor (the green tea flavor was a bit light though).

Considering my meal overall, I don't have much of a reason to drive over halfway across town to Sushi Factory just for AYCE sushi. I'm also as likely just to check out Sushi Way first. Check this place out if you're in the neighborhood though, or if you've tried everything else and want a change. I do have to wonder if they'll capture enough fans with an established AYCE sushi spot just a block away and another one up Rainbow past 215. Time will tell.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,14,9,4,psJ_eo-JZhw0dKFHwBhQag

screaming O and sashimi salad are awesome! lettuce wrap was also good. every type of nigiri was delicious and fresh. we did a few half rolls on the first trip (forgot the names), but they were also very good and well made. they do offer soy paper (my wife doesn't like seaweed) and have 5 no rice rolls.
dynamite was really good, but too many mushrooms for my taste; my wife loved it though. the light smokey flavor on the pork belly is excellent! we also had most of the skewers. the best were bacon wrapped asparagus and bacon wrapped scallops. hard to wrong with anything bacon wrapped though!
only negatives are the slightly limited deserts and they still don't have their liquor license. good selection of beers and sake though.

I see a lot of reviews complaining about the wait time, hmmm, you have a 2 for 1 deal going on a soft opening night, everyone is there for basically the same reason to pig out on cheap sushi. The restaurant is not that big... do the math people lol. I went with the full expectation that wait time was going to be super long... 

Around 5:30 my friends and I put our name down. The good thing is that they actually take your phone number and let you walk away instead of making you wait there. So I was able to go back home, meet everyone at my house, watch a movie until they called. It was a 2 hour wait. 

Then we were seated, you can tell the wait staff was trying but they are either freaked out by the crowd or are just inexperienced... It was just not working out. Our table was touched 4-5 times within the first 15 minutes of being there. However, throughout the duration of the meal orders were wrong multiple times. We got some nigiri from another table's order. Our uni and Amaebi never came, and when asked the female server said they are ""peeling the shrimp first order first served"" but never got it until we lost all hopes.

4557673,2018-03-21,1,1gU1ZNbcvk0puuUQjbl23w,"A 2 for 1 AYCE sushi special sounds like a really good deal on paper, but for a business just opening, it may backfire on them if they aren't prepared for the onslaught. Servers and cooking staff can feel overwhelmed, the food has to have a decent first impression, and people can end up waiting hours on end for their food. It's a bad combination and I noticed that this new place is taking the heat just because of that. My girlfriend and I were lucky enough to experience an almost normal meal considering all these factors. 

We came in around 3:00PM, and by using visual clues, we figured we had to fill out a sign-in sheet and give them my number. Ended up waiting for only about an hour. 

As soon as we got a text from the restaurant, we were immediately seated. I was impressed by the promptness and the decor. We were soon able to put in our orders and away we went on our late lunch. 

10 minutes later, our food has yet to arrive. Concerned, one of the servers came up to us to check if we were waiting for our order. We confirmed that, and in a few minutes our first batch of orders came pouring in. Unfortunately, we did have to wait 10+ minutes each time we ordered anything new. We didn't really mind it since we understood how busy the were.

Long story short, the nigiri was decent. The salmon was the best part of the meal. You can't really go wrong with the rolls. The Golden Philly was the best. The other rolls we had tasted pretty standard, but don't get the no rice rolls. We specifically got the Rock'n'Roll and it was just an almost flavorless dish, doused in a huge amount of spicy sauce. 

All in all, it was a pretty decent experience. For a 2 for 1 AYCE deal, it was better than expected. The servers did their best in accommodating every table, even if almost every server came up to us asking if we ordered anything. I'm sure they were just flustered by the neverending crowd of hungry people. If they're able to keep up the food quality and they improve on the logistics on service, I'm sure they'll be a sushi spot people will want to go back to.",MghRQ6h95OSD5so41-SPBA,2,0,3,o00e3h7ZwcX-saiRCsDE7g

Ample parking out front. The ambiance and the decor are very nice. There's this pink cherry tree right by the front and I thought that was a beautiful decoration piece. The restaurant size is not crazy big but not crazy small either. 

The AYCE menu has a wide variety of choices and everything was very fresh and delicious.

Being a smart one and planning for the wait with my friend, we patiently waited. I expected a 2 hour wait due to only seeing 2 servers, a hostess and a busser. While waiting I planned for Soyo to be our back up and even contemplated splitting our party of 2 so that my friend and I could sit away from each other at the bar! Haha. He was not a fan of that idea so we waited and was surprised it was only a little over an hour wait.

When we were seated, we promptly ordered. Nothing really stood out by way of the menu except for a few things:

1. Hit - All their nigiri was cut slightly thicker than most AYCE places. So moving forward, hopefully they stick with this and not start cutting them thinner than what it is now.

2. Hit - I am never a fan of deep fried rolls of anything mostly for the fact that the rice comes out very mushy and overcooked. Most of deep fried rolls are thick and only cut 5 pieces. Their deep fried roll however was the size of a normal roll, 8 cut, battered and deep fried.

3. Hit - Monkey Brain - seafood stuffed mushroom, deep fried and sauced. Would be really great if the stuffing was seasoned more with salt and pepper, but overall, a great stuffed mushroom.

4. Miss - Pork Belly Appetizer - for $6.95, all we got were 2 3/4"" nuggets... hopefully that's just because it was opening and they were stretching it out haha. But otherwise, great flavor. 

5. Miss - Baked Mussels - great cheesy topping, but I am too used to extra mayo haha. Just add a little extra mayo to offset the cheese crust but otherwise,  decent.

6. Miss - they don't carry natto! 

All in all, can't wait for them to be finished so their skewers menu opens up. As expected, they did loose a couple of our orders, but great job to the team for keeping their cool.",JtAoso0Ze87DWqnmI5qorA,4,4,4,Z_y3hkIk2Pd7GtkLNHrjJg

We tried numerous items on the menu. I liked how they have a ""no rice roll"" section. We tried the Cherry Blossom & Johnny. Cherry Blossom was the best by far. Candy Cane was my favorite on the ""soft shell crab roll."" 

The baked green mussels were good, but too cheesy for my tasting. The cucumber with crab salad wasn't marinated enough, but it could of been better. 

Overall, ended the dinner with mango mochi, FBI and green tea ice cream.",bydI3xl_ZpDZRbAQMAPITQ,2,0,4,bAf975TaSTkOacubZAHGTQ

Maybe if you cheapskates didn't complain so much, maybe the promotion could've lasted through it's planned time. 

Done ranting, let's talk about the food and service. My gf and I went on Thursday at 5:30, we didn't care that the promotion ended just because we heard that the food was good. The food was actually good too, the agedashi tofu was probably my favorite appetizer dish. Our waters were also being constantly refilled and they constantly checked up on us. The only reason why I'm knocking out a star is because the Kama always took longer than expected, but it's not the servers fault because they constantly kept checking up on it. The kitchen needs to step it up on their time management.

5795227,2018-06-14,0,1gU1ZNbcvk0puuUQjbl23w,"Proceed with caution. 

Nigiri sushi. Not bad. Poki. It was spicy which was unusual for Poki. Had them remake it as I am unable to eat spicy foods at this time. No bueno. It was overall sweet now. Weird. Anything that could have ponzu or unagi sauce was covered in sauce all over. It was like sauce with a side of sushi. I love some sauce but not that much. Made many/all of the items too sweet to eat. I wanted to like salt to off set all the sweet. I needed to substitute some things cause I am unable to eat spicy foods but then they keep taking out all the fish/tuna from the item.  Communication was a little difficult. Not great overall for the sushi dishes from all you can eat menu. 

Would try the dinner all you can eat maybe. But not in a hurry to come back. I would prefer my usual sushi spots. More to say later but just proceed with caution. Some stuff is good. Others, I've had better. Overall the sushi size, quality is eh and small. Not
Bad but not good. 

I would try the dinner options first. As there is more to pick from with the all you can eat. And there are also daily specials. Also I did like they had more different rolls/options than other places. Lisa and Barbie roll were pretty good. Salmon skin roll had unagi sauce on it. Weird. 

Service was spotty. Went when it wasn't busy at first then got super busy. But felt like they were not understanding what i was asking for due to my no spicy food condition currently.
