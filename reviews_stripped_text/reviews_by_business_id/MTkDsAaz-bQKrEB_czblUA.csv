I'd been calling them for an hour and still got no answer same as no pizza. The most awful service I've ever gotten. I guess I'll have to go tomorrow to their location to deal with them. Ask for my money back and talk to the manager.",sB3hS8f07QMh1pujXCQCuQ,0,0,1,aq_nAKEGxSEspD5Sxj_yKQ

But man oh man can you tell the difference in the quality and taste. I think once your receipt says ""free"" or ""points redemption"" they change how they make you're pizza.

Usually when I pay regular price my pizza is always full of topping and full. But this ""free"" pizza looked worse than a Little Caesars pizza. The flavor even tasted quite different from when I actually pay. But hey that's what I get for ordering the free pizza I was entitled to. 

But the dead giveaway was the order name on my receipt. ""Free"" and ""points redemption"" I knew then that was a bad sign. If there wasn't a difference why put it on there like that anyway? And they need to tell drivers to make sure to carry parmesan cheese at all times. Not everybody likes pepper!!!

HUGE THUMBS DOWN!!!

But 1 cool thing they started is something like Domino's pizza. After you order your pizza it lets you know where your pizza order has been received, then they are making your pizza, then the pizza is on it's way. And if you opt-in they even text you to let you know the pizza is out for delivery and on it's way.",KEerqlFNhzl1I-yVK6mHVA,0,0,2,_rS808_K1nyIAZqT4dqMZw

Sorry, we ran out of dough, so we made all 4 of your pizza's thin crust, but they got mixed up with other orders and went to other people.""
Really?!?!? This is not the first disappointing experience with Pizza Hut @ Lake Mead and Hollywood, but it is the last. We will never order pizza from this location, again. Terrible customer service, they clearly have no clue how to run a business.

2962232,2017-04-03,0,MTkDsAaz-bQKrEB_czblUA,"Why am I not surprised that this place has a 2.5 average star rating?  My experience was pretty dismal but fortunately a customer service oriented employee did her best to make things right.
I placed an online order and showed up to pick it up. It was ready to go but upon showing me the pizzas it became clear that one of hem was done wrong. I'd ordered a tomato, onion and bell pepper pizza but got one without the onion but with added mushrooms. I hate mushrooms but told the girl behind the counter that I'd just pick them off. Then I realized that it didn't have onions. I love onions, guys.  Like a fat kid loves cake.  I kind of just stood there, not wanting to make a huge deal out of the onion situation and the young lady behind the counter could tell it was, in fact, a huge deal to my onion-loving self and offered to remake the pizza.  Of course, I did have to wait an extra 15 minutes but she was very apologetic and once all was said and done offered to allow me to take the incorrect pizza - which I did cause...hello?  Free pizza!?!?
So while the order was wrong (and incidentally, there was a lady picking up just after me who's pizza was also incorrect and she told me while waiting for hers to be corrected that she was actually getting it for free because the last time she ordered they had messed up her order so this was a freebie.  Eeeeek...Pizza Hut?  If you're messing up your make-up pizzas for a previous mess-up, you gotta do something about that...)
I realize things happen and we're all human.  I appreciate the apology and generosity shown me so they saved themselves from a 2 star rating.  But 3 stars is all I'm gonna go!  And that's me reciprocating the generosity.",vpvW58vXP9xuOsWg-OCFxg,0,0,3,1p3yPj9J1gVkQ8jk0OYUtg

3178004,2015-02-09,1,MTkDsAaz-bQKrEB_czblUA,"I saw an ad boasting pizza huts new menu, sort of like Dominos' overhaul a couple years back, which was needed and I liked.
So I wanted to give Pizza Hut a shot having not liked them compared to Papa Johns and Dominos. I ordered 2 mediums 2 toppings for 20 bucks, delivery, including tip. I got a chicken and bacon pizza, and a pineapple ham one, hand tossed style, with the new flavored crusts on each, cheddar on one and garlic bread on the other; new idea. Poor execution, the pizza is just flavored wrong, all I tasted was the sauce which is too tangy/garlicky. There's hardly any cheese and the dough still is more cardboard than it should be. There was hardly any bacon on my pizza, it was more like bacon bits. I was disappointed. 

It got worse an hour later when I was restricted to the toilet for about 47 minutes with uncontrollable diarrhea, and then had some puke spells at the same time. My buddy had only one slice of the chicken bacon pizza and texted me that he also was experiencing a similar stomach disaster. 

I waited about an hour and called Pizza Hut. Asked for the manager and waited for 10 minutes to talk to some guy who could barely speak English. I didn't want a refund, I really didn't want a new order, I only called to let them know there was possibly an issue with their chicken or something. So this guy who could barely speak english and claimed to be the manager, hurries me through my little anecdote about pizza and my butt and stuff, hehe, and then tells me to send an email. An email? To who? Idk, he didn't or really couldn't explain, language issues. And so I'm trying to make sure he knows there could be an issue with a product in his store, and he just keeps repeating ""email, email"" . 'Uh um, whatever then' . He hangs up on me. Hmm, I was laughing to myself after the phone went dead. 

My pizza ended up in the trash, and so will this Pizza Hut location if this is how they conduct their business regularly. 

Avoid this place, trust me, even despite my experience here, I realize that's something that could possibly happen and is unusual, but just based on the pizza quality. It's shit compared to any other pizza place there is, including Little Caesars, for real.",d5BpyRtd03vpxguCa8NmFg,1,0,1,p7Dnb4bcS-hYrXtoIGSkVQ

I live two blocks away, spelled the name of my street several times and they said I was out of their delivery area and she didn't even know where I lived. The Manager has no comprehension of customer service. Their online ordering has more glitches than a new Windows launch.  Eighteen dollars, it wasn't worth eighteen cents.  The pizza dough was old, so it was soggy and when I asked Zach, the manager of it was old, he said yes, two days old. I thought pan dough was fresh made every day.  Well, so if you like pizza, don't get it from here.",zz8wWcrMFQe_hpRad7k5NQ,0,0,1,JWqsk5UyNzaMN9REfnMuIw

From lack of ingredients and dough to wrong toppings to  ice cold pizza. I finally got sick of not being able to get decent pizza in Sunrise Manor and NOT having my issues resolved at this PH in specific. I called HQ and received 2 calls back from the store manager within 24 hours. Not only was he incredibly apologetic but, he made me feel important to PH's success. I received my comp. and proceeded to try ONE LAST TIME! The pizza was not only correct, it was DELICIOUS! My hubby and agree we have not had PH so good since you could eat at the restaurant!  I just hope the rest of the issues remain ""in check"". THANK YOU !!! Keep up the good work and we will continue to use this PH! NOM",r7NQ5zhrku8jc-PDGsQI7w,1,0,4,3UNOen-_lZKnyEIPi8amqw
5907974,2017-11-13,0,MTkDsAaz-bQKrEB_czblUA,"This Pizza Hut is Seems to be out of Stuffed Crust more than a lot. It's almost as if they aren't ordering correctly. This is the 4th time I have ordered and had no success with stuff crust in a row. I order about every 3 weeks or so. The stuffed crust for me is why I even go to Pizza Hut. 
Without the stuff crust the Pizza is just average at best and I'll take a $5 from little caesars or one from Tropicana Pizza rather than pay Pizza Hut prices; and I have. 
Just like tonight I have also ordered from the Pizza Hut on nellis location (Most of the time I'll just buy from a competitor out of pure annoyance) and I picked it up instead of delivery if I really want the stuffed crust, because the lakemead & Hollywood location is again out of stuff crust. 

Wake up Hollywood & lake mead location your customers are not happy & your losing money to your competitors. 



And update 


Still no stuff crust the last 3 times I've tried to order smfh! Don't waste your money here!!",C6LJPTxe_U2HUZtUstnuGg,0,0,1,vfYmfzkavAyP0gIDj-xOdQ
