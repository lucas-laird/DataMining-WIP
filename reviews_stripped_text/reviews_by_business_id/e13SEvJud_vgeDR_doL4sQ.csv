23948,2010-04-08,1,e13SEvJud_vgeDR_doL4sQ,"I first started going to the original Hussong's in Ensenada in '73.  I was amused to see that they had opened a place at Mandalay, but my expectations were low, given Las Vegas's tendency to do recreations that are skin-deep at best.  Nonetheless, not having been to the real thing in a few years due to border violence, my wife and I decided to check it out.

As far as the decor and look of the place, they did about as good a job as can be expected.  It has a lot of the touches of the original...albeit with a lack of the grit and wear of years.

The service was pretty good...a young lady named Yolanda was attentive, and friendly, as was the hostess who seated us.  In fact, Yolanda recommended an excellent tequila (although it would be much better if they had a printed list from which to choose).

The food was another story.  (I've eaten in restaurants all over Mexico from resorts to baja joints to Mexico City).The salsas were pretty good, but everything else, the beans, rice, lobster tacos, and carne asada were  bland, and the presentation was weak.  Speaking of presentatioin, the ""toreados"" (jalapenos stuffed with cheese) were sitting on a plate with some mysteriouis brown liquid swishing around the bottom...not very appetizing for an appetizer.  also, the jalapenos should have been deveined and seeded better...as a result they were inedibly hot.

Based on our experience, it was a typical case of another Las Vegas restaurant that knows they don't have to rely on repeat business, because there's a new load of customers coming into town every day.
Overall a big disappointment, but I have to give credit to the designers who did a fairly credible job of recreating the look of Hussong's, and the wait staff who were friendlier than a lot of LV restaurant staff.

I seriously doubt we'll go back unless I hear that there have been dramatic changes in the food.",ZdUFyF5eNyZxete-T4bmZA,4,2,2,NCRTTPMyqsOKknofIUwWCw

Never came to ask if we wanted to order another round of drinks or if we wanted more food or even to simply fill our water cups. It literally felt like it was just moving the masses in and moving them out as quickly as possible.

We scarfed them down, they didn't taste half bad going down but coming out was another story. We were sick the rest of the night and following day from food poisoning. 
I went to go talk to the manager, face still pale I could hardly look in the restaurant, The manager basically said that no one else got sick so too bad for us. The best he could conjure up was ""maybe"" offering us some more food if we called some other number. I didn't want to risk throwing up again so I settled for this yelp review...

After our drink order that he forgot multiple times, he brought the drinks to the table, and  I was with 3 women, and a child. The waiter brought the drinks and as he placed them on the table he stated loudly ""oh I fucked that up."" He also said a drink was ""on the house"" then charged us for it. I asked for guacamole and sour cream, he informed me it would be ""like a dollar a piece."" When the bill came 2 dollars for guacamole and a dollar for sour cream. We talked to the manager and he was nice , and removed the items... and the waiter was so rude he asked for a tip at the end of the night. He was a total jerk and needs to find another job like work at home, he doesn't do well working with the public. He scooped up the check as we were walking out and stated ""What No Tip!"" ""Nice!""

We were seated right away because well there was no one else eating there. This should have shot red flags in our heads right away. 

We were brought water right away, however we waited about 10-15 minutes to even have our drink orders taken. Our waiter took our order after about another 5-10 minutes. Another worker brought us chips and two kinds of salsa. The chips were actually very good. The salsas were more of a smokey paste. No one enjoyed the salsa, so we just ate the chips. I would like to add that all of us have grown up on authentic Mexican food and this was not it. 

Finally our food comes out. Three people ordered the nachos, One order enchiladas, another a burrito and I ordered a plate that included chicken, chorrizo, carrots and tortillas covered in queso. The queso was more of a solid that a liquid, it actually took me the whole meal to figure out that it was the queso. Not one person finished more than half of their meal, It was HORRIBLE. One girl took one bite and shoved her plate away. 

Now, I can forgive less than wonderful food if I have great service. The last time we had seen our waiter was when he took our order. He never checked on how our food was. Another one of my friends was missing part of her meal and never got it because no one ever came by. We saw the water lady 3 times as much as our own waiter. Let me remind you that NO ONE was in the place so it was not like he was very busy with tables. 

FINALLY, he swings by the table and we ask for the bill. Four of us paid in cash, we told him to split whatever was left on the bill after the cash on the two cards. He walks aways, comes back about a minute later and throws everything on the table and says ""I don't understand, I don't know who's money goes with what"" We didn't care if every person paid for specifically what they had, we just wanted out. So he goes through our tab with  us and splits it up specifically even though we told him to just use the cash then with the remainder of the bill, split it equally on the cards. He comes back with six bills. Clearly this was too hard for him. We paid and RAN out of there.

The restaurant was loud, mainly because of the trio of singers/musicians loudly serenading the patrons in Spanish for tips.  Unfortunately they came to our table just as our food arrived and probably breathed all over it, delaying our meal even further.  This place is convenient and the food is decent, but don't go for the ambience.",Q6PIexKxto5LKJ6wEKvrwA,0,0,2,okvaSFNuTs1RDoK0CiCCfw

Hussong's Vegas = Bad ameri-mex food that was mostly over-cooked, over-salty, overly dried out from sitting under heat lights, all of which left both of us overwhelming in need of gas pills for last 2 days in Vegas. Red salsa = canned ketchup w onions. Green salsa = ??? mystery salty green goo, rice and beans were dried out and way salty. Ceviche had all of two shrimps in it. Trademark Hussong's tacos were just OK. Chimichanga was awful - dried out, leftovers with a horrendous red slick of an attempt at mole sauce (?). I'm not sure how, but the chips and salsa tasted jarred, bagged - Costco's are even better.


1 STAR for super fast, friendly service...and 4 STAR 48 HOUR gastro distress. No kidding.

We also came with a travel zoo deal, which took forever to figure out they didn't own the required scanner for the coupon code to get it in the system, so were asked for our travelzoo username and password, so the manger could email himself the voucher...and wait it to show up and be processed...before we could order. Also - travelzoo folks get a mandatory 18% tip slyly slipped onto the bill - which they don't tell you about. The waiter deserved it, so it was actually OK...but I LIKE TO ADD THE TIP MYSELF, AT MY DISCRETION.

This is a great palace for cocktails...in volume. I wish I would have skipped over this travelzoo offer. This Hussong's is NOTHING like the one in Mexico...only the logo is the same.",Kg0wlZN6jz5HR7sS0Htm7A,0,0,1,b0SkXQGgvajwx8JIhYVYvA

Will do things short for readers:

Waitress was amazing getting a table for us almost immediately, in the meantime Mariachi was singing great authentic Mexican Songs.
Table ready, chips came in a SNAP along with a couple of salsas that I define as grandma's!..............I love spicy salsas and food, so I asked for a hotter salsa to dip my chips, but I believe I overestimated the chef. Habanero salsa must be treated with an Ice Cold Negra Modelo and a slice of lime.
Food was as good as it gets, second to none!! 
I had a combo, so I could taste 3 different dishes all at once. I had # 1: carnitas quesadilla, chile relleno and enchilada. The way they teat pork is amazing, very tasteful meat melted with the cheese and wrapped in a carefully flour tortillita!
Chile relleno was great. Mid size Poblano filled and battered at its best. I critique cooks that don't do it the way my grandma does (the batter), but Hussongs' cooks must have traveled to her to learn;   batter was very fluffy, simply cooked to perfection. 

Try their ""El Pepino"" drink if you are up for a spicy and fresh tequila drink.

I'll be back and most likely bring locals to try this restaurant. It is DEFINITELY                N O T   your regular casino, mass produced, flavorless restaurant, you will tell, I promise. 
Again, believe me, I don't go to the Strip EVER! , but I'll come back here regardless.",P_oVhs-KRsN4Saj77eHAEQ,0,0,5,z1p2vjMDE9tMmYx-zO-SuA

It started off great with us being seated fast and our waitress being at the table helping us with the menu and explaining specials. I ordered the carne asada plate and the rest of our table ordered. That is about where the great service stopped. A couple other people came after and it seemed that her service went to the other 2 tables as they got their food before us even after being seated well after us and they had their bill paid and left well before we could even get her attention for the bill. After getting the bill we had to sit around even more waiting for her to get it and return our card. This is the loss of the 2 stars as poor service can ruin an experience

The food was pretty good though. My carne asada was very moist and very flavorful. I was able to make a burrito with it as they serviced it with chorizo beans, rice, and guacamole and sour cream and a tortilla. They also served some potatoes with it but they were meh at the best. Still had extra carne asada which was very nice as I was able to eat it alone and it was good. The chips and salsa was good and they had this tomatillo salsa that was great

The GOOD- The only good thing about this place is the location- right in the middle of the Shops at Mandalay Bay.

The OK- I ordered the chicken enchilada suizas.  They were ok.  Nothing special, and I've definitely had better.  My boyfriend ordered the Cuatro tacos with carnitas and carne asada. He didn't like them at all! They were dry and the meat did not taste good.  Neither of us finished our meals, I think I ate one enchilada and he ate 2 of his 4 tacos. The chips and salsa they give you is not that good either.  We were starving so we ate some of the chips they gave us, but overall the food was not that good.  The service was ok, but I did have to ask a few times to get a straw.

The BAD- The mariachi music was so LOUD!  My boyfriend and I were sitting right across the table from each other and had to yell to even hear what the other person was saying.  Also, $60 for a pitcher of margaritas, and $18 for one margarita!!!  That is INSANE to charge that much!  I get it's Las Vegas and everything there is expensive, but c'mon, that is absolutely ridiculous!

The nachos were admittedly a bit small, but I think that can be excused since these are possibly the best nachos I've ever had. Delicious chips that were piled high with chicken, beans, corn, and veggies, with sour cream and green salsa drizzled on top. The margaritas were tasty and particularly boozy.

I was excited to see they had vegan options, and had a tough decision on whether to eat here, or slice of vegas one day. I chose wrong, but then later atoned for that mistake. 
The chips and salsa, as well as the service, were both excellent, so the two stars reflects upon the rest of the dining experience, because both of those were 5 stars. 
My vegan burrito was tasteless, very little in terms of redeeming factors. The sauce that came on it was very bad, it tasted like it was cooked for like 3 hours too long accidentally, burnt, but not in a smoky good way. There wasn't much in terms of crisp veggie content in the burrito itself, mostly some very bland tasting gardein strips. The rice and beans that came with weren't very exciting either. 
I think the tell tale sign, was my girl, who usually digs this type of cuisine (its her favorite) didn't like her meal at all (non-vegan meal).

I brought a group of 15 executives to Hussongs Cantina for a few Margaritas and mexican food. I never expected such a fun and welcoming experience. The service was great! We were lucky enough to have tried just about every item on the menu. Every item we tried was tasty and captured the spirit of 'the real' food in Mexico. 

We started with guacamole and three salsas on the menu. 
It was obvious that the guacamole and salsas were freshly made and I was in heaven from the beginning of our gastronomical experience. We continued by having all the appetizers on the menu brought in as tasters. The one thing that was immediately noticeable was the freshness of the food - OMG the corn (Elote Plazero) and the tamales were my favorites. The taste of the corn on the cob was amazing - with Cotija cheese and spicy sauce still make my mouth water - I could not get enough!. The tamal captures the authenticity of the recipes from Mexico. I am South American so their food had me from the beginning to the end. We continued by having platters with the whole variety of the tacos they serve. My favorite were the Lobster Tacos -- All of the tacos had their own unique flavor since the sauces, peppers and salsas were different depending on which taco we were having. The Nachos were huge and loaded with all the goodies you can imagine. We finished with dessert plates which had a little of each dessert on the menu -- I have to confess, by then, I just couldn't eat one more bite -- However, everyone around the table were in heaven... 

We had so much fun! Our waitress was fabulous and made herself a part of our gathering as the perfect hostess. The place was jumping and music was playing ~ and our group of executives felt as if we were a friends house. Thank you Hussong's -- We will be back when in Las Vegas!

I ordered the carnitas tacos. The carnitas meat itself had a good shredded texture with solid flavor. The tortilla itself was rather bland and tore very easily so I had to eat half of the tacos with a fork. No biggie, but eating tacos with a fork is kinda weird. Other than that, the tacos were made with a pineapple salsa that had a good sweet tartness from the pineapple balanced against the heat of the peppers. This is what gave the tacos its signature taste and it tasted okaaaay. Nothing mind-blowingly spectacular but it's definitely different and it works!

Some of my other friends got quesadillas which actually looked and smelled fantastic. And then other other friends got the baja sandwich which is like a torta. That looked quite delicious too and it was huge! They were only able to finish half and had to take the rest home to save for later!

Warning: This place serves you infinite chips with a red sauce and a yellow sauce. Super addictive. We must've went through 10 baskets of these chips and by the time our food was finally served, we were all too full!!

Overall, it was a decent experience. Not the greatest Mexican food I've had, but it's far from the worse.

Wife and I came for lunch on Aug. 16, 2014 and left with full tummies and smiling faces. We initially were taken to a front section table, but I requested a table further back - not a problem, immediately the hostess (with a smile) took us to a back table even though no one else was seated in the back section yet.  Soon after, our server (Kara) came up to give us chips/salsa and take our drink order. Hussong's claim to fame is that they had invented the original margarita way back when in Mexico - and they did not disappoint.  Most of the margaritas are priced $12 to $13, so we opted to share the Romance $20 (a gigantic margarita enough for four people).  When it arrived, it was very refreshing and delicious with a potent kick.  Kara was the ultimate server - always smiling, very attentive and answered all our menu questions thoroughly.  We decided to try the guacamole with our second serving of nachos and salsa and were very glad that we ordered it.  It was very different from any guacamole that we had eaten anywhere previously - very large chunks of avocado and other mystery ingredients that all worked very well together.  Wife had the taquitos which she said was great. I had ordered the Enchiladas Rojas and had opted for one of each (chicken, beef and carnitas).  It came with sides of beans and rice; and everything, especially the enchiladas was so tasty.  As much as I did not want to waste any of it,I could barely finish my meal.  Even the manager stopped at our table to see that everything was to our satisfaction. When we were done eating, Kara noticed that we had almost a third of our giant margarita remaining in the glass, so she took it in the back and came out with two full 'take-out' cups with covers and straws for us to go - no better way to end a great meal than walking around the mall and casino buzzing with the best margarita in hand.
I'm sure that there are cheaper places to find good Mexican food fare in Las Vegas.  But for us, considering the location, great ambience (interesting antiques, pictures and décor, and very appropriate background music), the efficiency and friendliness of service and the excellent quality of food, we will be back at Hussong's again on our next trip to Vegas.",AcFYDaFlZ6jEWl1Gjc20Pg,0,0,5,W0MSsIJYzZF588xr1tg-KA

When I arrived, they walked me past a bunch of open tables to the table farthest in the back, right next to the constantly swinging kitchen door, and facing the table that was being used by the staff to fold napkins. If it were not for the fact that the busboy folding napkins had a great butt, I would have complained.

Later, when they found out that I am conducting one of the big shows in town, they offered to move me to a better table. I politely declined, (Too Late) but thought; ""Ya mean if you'd thought that I wasn't your average customer, you would have given me a reasonable table?"" Not good.

They advertise as ""Not your standard gringo Mexican food place"". But that's exactly what I found. The food was all very average. The tomatillo salsa that was served on my ""Enchiladas Suizas"" was the same that was served with the chips when I arrived. The chicken inside did not seem spiced or marinaded in any way. The tortillas were dull.

The margarita was good (made with fresh lime juice), but it was not ""the original"" margarita, as advertised. According to Hussong's history, the original was made with Damiana liqueur, which adds a slightly bitter, herbal flavor. Here, they substitute Cointreau, which is citrusy and very sweet - again, appealing to the average Gringo.

I've mentioned this before, but I'll bring it up again: Las Vegas is jam-packed with awesome Mexican restaurants - and most of them are dirt cheap. If you're gonna charge $16 for an enchilada, you'd better back it up with outstanding food; interesting drinks, and impeccable service.

Was disappointed the moment I saw the restaurant as it lacked any real ambiance...more like a cookie cutter Mexican sports bar. Still, wanted to give it a chance. 
While the original margaritas were decent, the only thing that really stood out was the grilled Mexican corn. The sopes appetizer was hit and miss...the two pulled chicken ones were good but the two carnitas ones were dry and had that reheated fatty carnitas flavor. Ditto on the carnitas platter entree. Baja fish tacos were just OK, nothing like the yummy ones in Baja. Salmon with chipotle sauce was prob the most impressive. But even their Spanish rice was dry and refried beans were spicy but not flavorful. 
But here's the kicker, Travelzoo couponers: beware of the 18 percent tip that the management tags on to the bill. While the voucher says the meal doesn't include tip, it doesnt mandate a certain percentage to tip, leaving it up to the customer. When we inquired about this to the manager, he said that we've always added that to the checks. He then went on to say we are the first to complain about it, as if to imply we are crazy for even questioning it. We insisted on him taking it off, which he finally did albeit with an attitude. We left 15 percent, which is what the server deserved. 
Again: watch out for the bogus 18 percent tip add-on. And, furthermore, the entire itemized check as our server ended up overcharging us for our meal despite the voucher...tacked on an extra drink! Fortunately, we know to look for that stuff.",mHoJkRk3X9ssg0V2tbDITQ,2,0,2,dCCFZYjA8dl6VFfrk8-dWQ

I searched 'vegan' on Yelp and saw that Husson's has an entire vegan menu! Hallelujah! So I drove my car...err...inched my car down the strip and made my way into the Mandalay Bay Shoppes where the restaurant is located.

Right as you sit down, you can order a giant margarita, or something a bit less sugary like a tall glass of cerveja. 
A giant basket of chips is presented to you with not 1or 2, but 3 different types of salsa! (My favorite one is the sweeter tasting one with chunks of what looks like mango inside!

It took a long time for me to order because I simply could not decide what I wanted. Quesadillas, Tostadas, Enchiladas, Tacos, Chimichangas...alll Veganized! I asked for a recommendation and finally settled on the Chile Relleno. Because I've never had a vegan Chile Relleno before!

For one person, these are huge portions! There was a crispy tortilla topped with the grilled poblano chile stuffed Gardein Chik'n strips (there's beef available too!), onions, tomatoes, and potatos. Finally, it is covered in melted Daiya cheese and guacamole. Yum.. If that's not enough, there's a huge scoop of rice and beans on the side too!

I barely made a dent in my food before I had to pack it up to-go. The dish was pretty good. It's not 'authentic' in any way, but for the moment, it hit all the right spots.

I lived in mexico for a few months, lived in LA, dated a Mexican girl for 10 years so in sum - I've eaten Mexican food all over the place for many years....



Pros - 

Quite simply the best Mexican tasting food in Las Vegas!
Fries were amazing
Location is great if you're by Mandalay/Luxur
Staff is very helpful and friendly
Tortilla soup was to die for
Fajitas were fantastic too and great meat cuts
Real Mexican Food - authentic
Roots in Ensenada Mexico - they own a bar there, same family - fun place!

The atmosphere was great, we had great service and the music was good. They had hired a Mariachi band that came around the tables and played tunes on request for tips. We got them to play Folsom Prison Blues by Johnny Cash! They created a great atmosphere and the tune was flawless! Really fun.

When my tacos came, they tasted pretty good but the rice and beans on the side were not hot and tasted like they were from a can/flavorless. I asked her for a side of guac and she said they have a mini cup for $3. They are supposed to make homemade guac. What she brought was a tiny condiment cup of watery green liquid. Wtf?

2232664,2010-12-20,1,e13SEvJud_vgeDR_doL4sQ,"I've been here about three times. Some things are good, some things suck. For example, this place claims to be the Home of the Original Margarita (apparently created in 1941).  Just goes to show that time can improve upon almost anything... because their margaritas suck!  They are super sour and not much tequila.  I also hate mai tais from Trader Vics.  Original does not mean good, people!

But the food here is actually pretty unique if you are adventurous.  It is high quality food and the price reflects that (e.g. $4 per taco, which are small street tacos).  

You can get bone marrow tacos (which I actually would not recommend), beef cheek tacos (which I do recommend if you like gamey flavors) and tongue tacos (gotta try everything at least once - and not too bad!).  Just keep in mind, the portion sizes are seriously small and they charge extra for things you normally wouldn't expect, like getting diced tomatoes and lettuce on your tacos.  I mean seriously, 50 cents for lettuce on my tacos!?! That better be some seriously good, mind-blowing lettuce.

Just make sure to ask a lot of questions about portion size and presentation before ordering so you aren't surprised or disappointed.  For example, as other reviewers have said, the nachos are basically individual chips with the nacho toppings expertly placed on them.  Not the typical huge plate of tortilla chips covered in toppings that we normally associate with bar food.

One thing that is great about this place is the mariachi band.  They are hilarious!  One of them has a harp!  They play a great variety of songs and occasionally call for audience participation, which can score you free drinks.  My friend and I were the loudest at yelling ""TEQUILA!"" during the Tequila song which scored us free tequila shots.

Also, the chips and salsa are free and are both pretty good! Despite the fact that the chips come out of what appears to be a popcorn machine.

Keep an open mind, stay away from the margaritas, be prepared to shell out a bit more than you normally would, and make sure you come here when the mariachi band is playing (call ahead).  Then you will have a good time!",iAevEfcmtCr2cpd6IRqnTA,2,2,3,qQh8GKMe95HWzmVXA9hmhg

But that is how I like it. If you like it sweet you may want to chat with the bar tender. I am sure they will accommodate with all of the margaritas that they have!

Which leads me to my next point - the service. Our waiter was very on top of the work for a busy Saturday night. Additionally, management came over to the table multiple times to make sure everything was taken care of. 

My friend and I ordered and split the al pastor chicken and the barbacoa (spelling ???) tacos (3 tacos per order) and a side of guac (because who can go to a Mexican restaurant and not order some guac!!).

I personally liked the barbacoa tacos the best ! The rice and beans that come with it were so so and the guac had tomatoes and to much lemon lime taste which wasn't my thing and is the reason for the 4 stars. 

Atmosphere was busy for a Saturday night but not to crowded. This may not be the place to go if you have children or people who are sensitive to loud sounds because of the loud music the band plays. The music did not bother me - I thought the band added to the ambiance but I could see how it may bother some people so that is just a heads up.

Hussong's offers a very relaxed interior, decorated with an obvious nod to Cinco De Mayo with an abundance of skulls that are quirky rather than morbid, the bar staff were warm and friendly, service was fast without being rushed and speaking as someone who normally opts for a booth I'm happy to advise that the bar stools are surprisingly comfortable.

While there we tried the following:
Baja Style Ceviche: excellently executed appetizer, zingy and refreshing.
Stacked Quesadillas: generously filled appetizer, tasty and packed with flavour.
Margarita's: I'll admit, it was me knocking back these beauties as The Hublet isn't really a cocktail guy.  There were very, very good and the more I drank the better they got.  Weird huh.

Hussong's Las Vegas is quite different. They have a decent-size menu, and friendly staff and management. 

Went there with the honey, and ordered a pitcher of original margaritas. They said they don't use pre-made margarita mix, which I find too sweet. The margaritas were sweet-made with agave nectar, but not over the top.

Chips and salsa were good, and the salsas they serve have a good flavor and decent heat. I asked if they have a HOTHOT salsa, and the waiter brought out a salsa made with habanero and goodness know what else. After one taste, I couldn't feel my mouth for a good five minutes. If I was drooling, I wouldn't have felt it.

We had a queso fundido appetizer with chimichurri. We added the chorizo to the dish, and it came with warm corn tortillas. Let me tell you, it was fantastic. The dish is small, but packed with flavor. Melted cheesy, meaty goodness, and we couldn't get enough.

The boyfriend got the enchiladas plazeras at the waiter's recommendation. The plate looked like a mess, with potatoes, carrots and sauce on top that made it look like some sort of stew dish. The stew concoction on top was pretty good, but the enchiladas underneath all of that didn't have very much flavor.

I got the fish tacos, and for fish tacos, they were quite tasty. Generous fish, lots of cabbage slaw and sauce. 

The portions on the entrees were generous, and we left stuffed and satisfied.

At first I thought they made a mistake, but they indeed honored the card. We got the 2 for 1 margaritas and they knocked the price of an appetizer off of the bill. They were pushing a steak dinner special, maybe we should have spent a few more bucks for that. We decided on tacos instead. I had the steak tacos, my wife had the chicken tacos. Hers were greasy. Mine were dry. They weren't very good that day. Each taco dish also came with a small cup of beans and rice that were just ok.

They do give you free chips and 2 cups of salsa to start off but the mild salsa that was so mild we could barely taste it (looked kinda like balsamic vinegar) and the hot salsa was HOT but had the consistency of watered down ketchup. It was not salsa, it was hot sauce. We got a side of guacamole as our free appetizer. The guacamole was good and fresh, with chunks of avocado. So good we put it on our tacos.

The margaritas were good and strong. They were served in a 12 oz beer glass filled with ice.

Drinks-  5 stars for taste.....2 stars for price
Service-   based on our experience (twice)....2.5 star

Wow.......they are good margaritas.....maybe one of the best I've had; but c'mon......$12+ ?  Happy hour is ""1/2 price""......which was still $6.00 for a smallish (in my opinion) 'rita.   As for service,  I guess it was adequate,  but our bartender just wasn't friendly and/or engaging.  Hospitality,  particularly Vegas,  isn't about adequate,  in my view.  It's about EXCELLENCE.

Now... if you're looking for a loud, fun, entertaining time and you're staying at Mandalay Bay... this is a pretty good option.  

But if you are looking for good food, a nice relaxing meal with a bit of flair and creativity....  and great margaritas... go to Border Grill.  

This place is pricey and the food is just ok... and it's loud so if you want to have a conversation you'll be yelling most of the time.

The chips and salsa...  chips were a little stale... but the salsas were fresh.  Really like the creamy tomatillo salsa... it was tart but had a kick all while being creamy.  

We ordered the ceviche to start along with a pitcher of Pacifico and a blackberry muddled margarita.

The margarita was ok... I've had better so I only ordered 1... you could barely tell there were any blackberries in it.

The ceviche was small... had good heat and flavor... the odd thing was that it had cucumbers in it... good thing I like cucumbers.

The pozole... very tasty and hearty.... We all shared this... If (big IF) I go back... I'd order this and a beer.  It was comfort food in a bowl.  So Good.

Dinner... 
My girlfriend ordered an Arugula Chicken salad (she's on a diet so her splurge was cocktails)... but the Arugula turned out to be Spinach... not a big deal... but they should have told us of the menu / ingredient change.
My entrée was the Harache?  ... flat steak grilled with a chimichurri sauce on top of what was supposed to be a crispy tortilla... it was actually a soggy flatbread... I didn't eat the flatbread tortilla... but the steak and chimichurri was Great!
Hubby got the taco plate... wasn't anything special.
GF's hubby got the flautas... they were big but he said they were dry inside and only ate half.

For the 4 of us... 2 pitchers of beer, 1 margarita and 2 vodka cocktails... (plus the food mentioned above)... our total was $205 including tax and tip.  IMO... overpriced for what we got... Although, I'm pretty sure the bar tab was more than our food tab since drink pricing on Strip tends to be high... so... 

BTW.... did I mention the mariachi / roaming cover song band is loud and kinda obnoxious?  I found them annoying so this is one of the main reasons I won't go back.  But if you're drunk and looking to sing along off tune this would be a great place to hang.",PV0VEhlmhc2BjzMZEbpWlg,0,0,2,McB2d1DZGPOkE49XrK_XUw

My only complaint is that I paid $12 for a strawberry margarita and it had no discernible alcohol in it. I tried to flag down a waiter to make sure they hadn't brought me a virgin by mistake, but the place was too busy and I never saw them again. So there's that.

The food, honestly, was alright, but the lobster tacos were what really drew us in, and they were a disappointment. The shells were deep fried, which really overpowered any flavor of lobster...or anything else in the taco. I ended up scraping everything out of the shell, and that was marginally better, but still. Sad. The steak quesadilla, on the other hand, was really good - it was served ""open face"" instead of folded over like a normal quesadilla, so it looked more like a pizza, but hey, whatever. It was tasty. I liked that the sour cream was drizzled over the quesadilla instead of served on the side, and even though the quesadilla apparently no longer comes with guacamole, our server brought me a side order of guac anyway with no additional charge.

The salsas were interesting - the texture of the red one reminded me of marinara sauce, but it was actually really tasty and slightly spicy. I tried the green salsa, which was the one my husband preferred, but it didn't have the same heat as the red, so I ignored it after the first couple of bites.

Our drinks (a Mexican mojito and a Mango Margarita) were really good - a little bit pricey, but overall tasty and a decent deal for Vegas. Service was fast, if not overly friendly, and the Mariachi band was cool. They played everything from Pink Floyd to the traditional Mariachi music, and we enjoyed listening to them. We also enjoyed looking at all of the decor around the restaurant, as there was a LOT to look at. I'm regretting we didn't get a photo with the cardboard cutout Dos Equis guy!

OK, so let me start... We ordered a Margarita that was made for 2 people to share. Yes I got drunk off it and yes I had a designated driver. It cost $25 for it but let me tell you it was strong and 48 ounces of heaven. It lasted my whole meal and that was with my man drinking off it too. The downside was as we watched the server at the bar making it she put a toothpick in her mouth that she then put cherries on and then put in our drink. GROSS! I'm totally getting that drink again it was too good. It was called ""The Romance"".

We started with tacos. If you show your local ID after 6 pm Mon-Fri you get up to 4 tacos at 50 cents each. YES just 50 cents each! They were by far the best part of the meal. You can pick between chicken, beef or carnitas.

I had the ""Enchiladas Suizas"" which was very good. It had Chicken, Tamatillo Sauce, Sour Cream, and Salsa. It also came with rice and beans that were full of flavor. I asked the server if it could be made with flour tortillas instead of corn but she tried arguing with me (her name was Yolanda) that Enchiladas cant be made with flour tortillas because it wont hold together. I finally said that I get them that way everywhere else and that is how I would like them. You will see by the picture I posted that they held up just fine :)  This dish cost $15.

My man had the ""Beef Fajitas"" and he ate every bit of it. He didn't like that it had corn grilled in with the veggies but he will know for next time to tell them to leave that off. This dish cost $19.

If you are on the Strip and want a decent Rita and food to match or you are staying at the Mandalay and need a quick Tex-Mex fix it is a solid choice.  If you dig a good, well priced Rita(the closest I've ever had to my preferred 3-2-1 method (than I'd go so far as to say, considering the price) it is a must stop multiple days of your trip.",4Q_1Libg_NGNnnAbySrayQ,0,0,3,Hy_KErxqo6FHWf4XxYVdrQ

We visited Hussong's because we needed to get a quick bite before The Lion King.  Our first choice, The Burger Bar, had a wait so we decided  to go next door to Hussongs.

I found it to be extremely overpriced.  I understand it's on the Strip but I can see paying almost $20 for a rice and beans dish.

We decided to get appetizers.  My daughter ordered the chicken quesadillas and said they were good but greasy.  I ordered the taquitos and got three very small tacos.  The tortillas were small than El Pastor sized tortillas.  The tacquitos were good but nothing to be excited about.  My friend ordered the Queso Fundido with chorizo.  I get that chorizo is a very greasy sausage but she literally spooned a couple of tablespoons of grease out of the bowl before being able to eat it.  Draining the chorizo wouldn't have affected the taste of the dish at all.

Service was quick and friendly but all in all it was pretty unimpressive.  I'll stay off the Strip and stick to El Sombrero or something similar",qN3bsY-OnkYNy3zQfpRQsA,2,1,2,C02yBWb6jjCQSOJZPxI2LQ

We weren't hungry enough for full meals, so we sat at the bar. We decided to share a Stacked Quesadilla. I wasn't driving home so I ordered a margarita.

I don't know if they would recognize this quesadilla in Baja, but it was surprisingly tasty. If you've never tried Gardein Chick'n Strips, they taste remarkably similar to crispy fried chicken. I'm not sure what else was so flavorful (maybe the Pico de Gallo?) but we were both happy with the quesadilla and I would definitely order this again.

I also don't know how the margarita would pass muster. I got the Original, which came in a pint glass instead of a margarita glass. Is this how they serve them in Ensenada? Not bad, but I've had better. They claimed to use Sauza Blue Reposado tequila and fresh squeezed lime juice. If true, I could have used more tequila. Maybe I'm spoiled by my own margaritas. It was pretty refreshing, though, and deceptively strong. Maybe I'll try a Cadillac or El Pepino next time.

Thanks, Hussong's, for serving Gardein products. Vegan Mexican food isn't easy to come by, and you do it right!

We needed good food and my Frankenfoot needed the margarita.  The have 2 showcased margarita's - their original is handmade from top to bottom so that's the one we opted for.  It was strong & delicious.

We both ordered the lobster tacos for lunch and started with an order of handmade guacamole.  The guacomole was good and their chips are thick - almost like pita chips crossed with flour tortilla chips.  But that made them nice and sturdy for the guac :)

The lobster tacos were a bit stingy with the lobster.  And they were those Langostino lobsters that are kind of like the midgets of the lobster world.  But the creamy Mexican cheese on top made the flavors delicious.  And we both ate our 2 tacos with smiles on our faces.  

We sat at a tall table in the bar and our bartender/waitresss, Cheri, was great.  Everyone was really friendly and the atmosphere was fun.

I'm not sure if we just got dealt a really good hand or what, but I super enjoyed myself. The server was great at making recommendations for both food and drink, if the teeniest bit pushy (she could tell we liked her and after we had been served our food she pleaded, ""Are you SUUUUURE you don't want any margaritas?"" Yes we're sure. I have to drive in a minute and my friend has to go back to work). The hostess, however, was probably 17 and having the worst day of her life. No smiles, no acknowledgement when we asked for a table, just grabbing menus and leading us to a table. (I know, Girl, being 17 is hard. It's even harder when you hate your life. Smile a bit! It gets better, I promise. Molly out.)

Anyway, I had a special--some kind of elevated Taco Bell Crunchwrap Supreme. But I don't want to insult it by calling it Taco Bell food, because it was really great. It was the first quesadilla-type food I ever had to eat with a fork. It was stuffed to the brim with whole slices of tomato, avocado, and raw jalepeno. All of it tasted super fresh. The chips and salsa left a little to be desired, but the green salsa was flavorful and fresh.

We tried their guacamole, vegan fish tacos, and vegan beef tacos and everything was good!! The guacamole was SUPER fresh! It was really chunky, so you could tell they had just carved the avocado.

The salad was supposed to come with black beans and corn, which were nearly hidden the portion was so small. We could never even taste them! We expected some other veggies like peppers or onions too but we really just got some lettuce on top of two fried tortilla pieces. The chicken was dry and since my friend didn't even get the chicken or cheese, I felt worse for her. Bottom line this should not be considered a meal.

Four of us met to have dinner.  Our drinks were delivered quickly and then our order was taken.  I was the only one who uses Yelp so I used the check in offer to get a free Mexican street corn.  The corn was OK.  The kernels are a bit small this time of the year but the grilling and the cotija cheese were flavorful.  I had a bit of a smug attitude in enjoying the corn while the three others just looked on.  Yelp or lose--their choice!

We brought chips and salsas and it looked like there were three kinds of salsa.  Not so.  Two of them were fire roasted salsa and they were identical.  None of them had any zip to them.

For my main course, I got their carne asada.  It was a bit unusual the wait the thin meat was laid out along the center of the plate with some salsa verde on the meat.  The meat was cooked rare as I asked when I gave the server my order.  There was also rice, beans, and cubed potatoes.  I thought it was a bit of an odd combo for a Mexican plate.
No one ordered dessert.

Hussong's was OK but there are so many places that serve more authentic and better Mexican food in Las Vegas.  This isn't the most convenient place for a local to get to.

We had reservations for 8 at 6:30pm, so it was fairly early for dinner Vegas style. We had a vegetarian and vegan in the group and everyone loved their meals. It was great carb loading before a heavy night of dancing and drinking. 

Their vegan menu is done well, not just chips and dip and a veggie taco. Veggies have a full separate menu to choose from with a great variety of apps and entrees. We also had some food allergies in the group as well and our server, Ronnie (I think was his name?) was a star. He literally ran back and forth to the kitchen and back to our table to make sure he was giving us the right information on what was included in the meals ingredient-wise.

Drinks were delicious and ever flowing. The skinny pom margarita was fantastic although a bit too sweet for me, as was their OG margarita. I had the steak chile relleno which was flavorful and not too heavy. I saw someone at the far end of the table with a burrito the size of a nerf football though...noms for days. 

The live mariachi band serenaded us with Sweet Child o Mine and ""going to the chapel"" since it was my friend's bachelor party. What a fun group of guys.

Everything is made in house with such great food and cocktails what am I waiting for!

The wait staff was very friendly and helpful. When I did the Yelp check in Hussong's rewards the customer for doing this with an amazing prize. The check in gift is a shot of Tequila or street corn. I am sure you already know what I chose. You bet the Tequila! Cheers to Hussong's Cantina. 

The bar area is where I sat and enjoyed my wonderful Tequila shot, but one is not enough. Now in my second shot of Tequila to ensure it is definitely the best! The bartender is very attentive and my food smells amazing. It tasted amazing too.

Decided that tacos go very well with tequila and margaritas so that is what I had. The tacos do not disappoint here either. Having sampled the tacos at the Boco Park location in Vegas they are just as I remembered. Great! The wait staff brought the tacos to the bar stool where I was sitting it seemed in an instant from when I ordered them.

Luckily she'd made us a reservation (5 of us locals) and we were seated immediately.  The place is long and narrow and they have squeezed as many tables as possible into the small space.  For those who are familiar with Mandalay Place, it's in the former Chocolate Swan space.  

Anyway, we had standard chips and 2 kinds of salsa.. nothing memorable except the chips appeared to be hand made as opposed to processed and bagged.   
Service was fast, we had our hand shaken margaritas within minutes of ordering and it was extremely crowded due to MAGIC & the Vet Convention.  Margarita was large & delicious.  
Our appetizers were the:  guacamole, thick and chunky with just a slight bite of spiciness and def. delicious; the queso fundido which was thick with cheesy goodness; and the house specialty, Elote Plazero, an ear of corn on the cob, roasted with a thin coat of mayo/butter and cheese.  I could have had a 1/2 dozen of those and called it a day. 

Only 2 of us opted for an entree, both having the Enchiladas Suiza. It was beautifully prepared, presented and gobbled down!! This cantina is not for those who are expecting mid-America ""mex"" -- it is as authentic as it gets north of the border. 

...and if it is any indication, I am going back there today for lunch because I don't think I fully experienced all that mexi-goodness last night and must have another go of it.

I have to say that the only reason this place got 3 stars was for the excellent service we got from Amber at the bar. She was on top of the drinks, snappy banter and baseball so I was very happy!

WHEN YOU GO- I was not impressed by even their chips and salsa. The chips in our nachos were 10X better so I feel like the table chips sit around for awhile. We also had the mixed enchiladas and steak fajitas and both were pretty dang flavorless. Drinks and nachos are the only thing I'd order here again.

I had the huarache, which was fanTAStic. The meat was seasoned well and everything just came together perfectly. Even the chips & salsa they put out are amazing...some of the best tortilla chips I've had at a Mex place.

When I first walked in there was a Taco Cart...nice!!!  There was a choice of pastor, chicken or steak.  I got two steak tacos to start.  The steak tacos were really good.  I also heard people raving about the pastor but I am not a big pastor fan.

I also went to the bar and asked for a Margarita.  I also told that bartender that I did not like the mix and I was able to get mine made with fresh squeezed lime.  That makes me and my stomach happy!  The staff was very fast getting drinks even thought the place was packed from wall to wall.

I went in back to check out the buffet and picked up a taste of everything.  The food was really good and it had been sitting for a while in the heating trays.  I would love to come back here and order off of the menu one day!

My favorite part of the whole night was the Mariachi Band...these three guys were the Mexican Version of the Three Stooges.  They were so funny and they played every and all requests.  Our whole group was laughing so hard.  I asked for some Pink Floyd and they started playing Brick in the Wall.  I kept thinking...what have I done but the room loved it.  These guys were so much fun.  I asked at the front and they told me that these guys play on the weekend.  I really want to come back and listen to these guys again!!!

There was also a cardboard cut out of the Dos Equis Guy...if you angled the camera correctly it kind of looked like he was real.  In fact, a few people of facebook thought he was real and were surprised when I told them he was really cardboard.

We all had a good time...I wish I could have stayed longer but I had to get up early for work the next morning.  I hate when work gets in the way of free food and drinks in Vegas!!!",CY9iLsE2z_yLhLqJdD1WGw,3,1,4,GADD0ijW-_dnnteKsbYiBA

Our waitress was adorable, so friendly & accommodating, she overheard us talking about the show and promised to make sure we'd be out in time. I ordered a chopped salad and my boyfriend got steak quesadillas and we were both so pleasantly surprised. My salad was fresh and delicious, only complaint is the dressing was strangely salty, but not so much that I didn't clean the plate! His quesadillas were also delicious. My main complaint was the original margarita I got was no good - oddly strong & had a funky sour/salty taste even though it was not made with sour mix (supposedly only lime agave syrup & tequila). Our server brought us our bill immediately after we ordered so we could eat and run to the show. We'd definitely recommend this place if you're looking for a fast no frills affordable yummy meal.

We started our Vegas wander killing time between shows that night and on our way through the Luxor and into Mandalay we stumble upon Hussongs Cantina right next to Burger Bar. We popped in for a quick drink at the bar. I have to say that we met one of the best bartenders we experienced in quite some time. Our drinks were simple but on point, a Stella and an Long Island. Our bartender invited us back later to show off a fun drink...we told him we would return.

After a quick round or two we were off to the next show. Immediately following the show we were right back at Hussongs to take our 'tender up on his drink idea. It was a concoction containing Captain Morgan's, Blue curacao, Malibu, Midori, Pineapple Juice and Sour Mix called...""Liquid Marijuana"". We had never heard of it before but I know understand it's catching on. All I have to say is WOW, I want one right now that it crossed my mind. An instant hit! (no pun intended). Sip, sip, pass!!

We ordered a small plate of nachos to help float the alcohol down the right path and to curb any late night ""munchies"". The next morning or should I say morning to me, afternoon to you, we hit Hussongs again for some more grub. This time the 3 taco plate. 3 corn tortillas piled high with shredded chicken, chopped & cilantro and topped with a generous portion of guacamole...Yum to the 3rd power!

Lunchtime's drinks were not as great as the night before but I will blame the 'tenders for that I guess. The wife I believe went easy that day on the drink but I tip-toed towards something new..The Hussong's Red Eye. It's a mix of Tetcate Beer, homemade Bloody Mary mix served with a shot of Resposado Tequila on the side & garnished with Jerky & Celery. I know, wow and full meal in a glass right?? Well not really. The drink was so so and the waiter had to tell me (After I asked) that they were out of Jerky and Celery!? WTF! Oh Well...I was half hung over and wasn't gonna cry about it, but that part sucked..it sounded so good on paper.

Price was very reasonable I felt and wait staff was sometimes slow be super friendly. Night time bartenders rock and should retrain the day-trippers. Overall we obviously loved it if we made it back there multiple times in a 4 day stretch.

This isn't a super nice and trendy spot but for good Mexican food and a good drink at a reasonable price, it's pretty good. 

My favorite part was their mariachi band they had walking around. Not your typical mariachi band as they actually interact, talk and joke around with you. They even play non typical mariachi band songs. Definitely entertaining for a spot like this.

The chips also came with 3 different salsas which were quite good.

And to top off the experience, they no longer carry steak tacos, even though their menu says otherwise. Their ""steak"" tacos, which have previously been carne asada, are now shredded beef tacos...big difference. We also asked for just a little bit more cheese for our tacos, ""sure we will give you more cheese and not tell you it will be an additional $1.25 to your bill!""

The aunt and her boyfriend had actually already been to Hussong's and wanted us to try the place out. They're out-of-towners - taking us locals to a place! Ha!

The place is in Mandalay Shoppes next to one of my faves - Burger Bar. The place itself is small and narrow (also kind of like Burger Bar). And the tables are kind of close together, plus the place is a little cramped. More than a few times I felt like I needed to duck or scooch out of the way of servers trying to get food to other tables.

We started with chips (two salsas - red, which is a very tomato-based salsa, and a green tomatillo salsa which had a bit of a kick, but not much). Thank goodness we opted to get a side of guac to dip the chips in. It saved the day! It had nice, big chunks of avocado in it, which made happy. 

I had the Enchilada Suizas. Chicken enchiladas with tomatillo sauce, sour cream, and (I think) basil leaves topped on them. Also comes with a side of beans and rice. Strangely enough, I was a fan of the beans. Usually I am not at Mexican places, but these beans I actually liked. They had more texture and chunks of beans than others I have had. The rice was pretty bland - nothing special. The enchiladas were quite refreshing because they were much different than others I have had. With the addition of the topping of basil leaves, it made this dish much more complex and the chicken was not shredded, it was more like large, moist pieces of chicken in the enchiladas.

My husband had the carnitas platter, which comes with tortillas, peppers, onions, pickled onions, and a few other things. I tried some of the carnita and it was delish. They put a nice char on the meat and it actually comes out in CHUNKS, not shredded like so many other Mexican places. 

We ended the meal with sopapillas. They come with a small dollop of caramel ice cream and chipotle honey dipping sauce. You only get TWO sopapillas in the order. They were okay, but Lindo Michocan has better sopapillas.

Overall I enjoyed the experience. The only complaints are the small space, crowded seating, and the kind of bland chips and salsa. The prices were not bad for STRIP prices.",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,2,1,4,ClvHUOJJggzuSY3pnDuCjg

We came on a Friday night and ended up getting a table for 14 with no problem and without a wait.  Mariachis come by and are real personable.  Prices are decent for the strip, but high end just for regular Mexican food.  Suggest getting the coupon book they give in the hotels and getting a discount on your meal.

I was happy to be seated right away and even happier that they had a separate vegan menu.  I scanned the vegan menu and noticed they use Gardein Chick'n and Daiya cheese. I'll have mock meat occasionally but not too often so I opted for the Baja style veggie tacos - double stacked corn tortillas, served with guacamole, breaded zucchini, tomatillo-avocado salsa, and cabbage mix. My boyfriend ordered the Chick'n burrito which had Gardein Chick'n strips, Pico de Gallo, Daiya shreds, vegan sour cream, rice, and pinto beans served on a mix of lettuce and tomatillo-avocado sauce.  We thought the food was ok and was pricey for Americanized Mexican food.  But I get it that it's a tourist spot so a lot of the food is overpriced. I give it 3 stars for food, but since the service was great and they have a separate vegan menu I'm giving them another star.  Our waiter brought our food out quickly and always made sure we had everything we needed.  

If I'm ever near Mandalay Bay, I'm glad I can come here for vegan options or I may try their sister restaurant next door Slice of Vegas which also has a vegan menu. Being vegan in Vegas seems pretty easy.",Th_ce__iXCGm5a1g9TzwDQ,6,4,4,c7tbWXRAlbNOgbpCJA7iUw

I had ordered the Taquitos on the appetizer section of the menu. After we placed our order, I noticed that there was a little fold out promotional piece on the table that advertised breakfast burritos. I quickly waved down our waiter and asked him to change it out because the burrito was only $2 more but included a lot more food. It was then the Elio got really awkward. His body language and facial expressions showed he was very annoyed at me for wanting to change my order. He even said something along the lines of, ""Well, umm, they're already making it. But I guess I can go see if I can cancel it. It's just going to take a lot longer."" When I told him it was fine if it took longer, he again stressed that the cooks were already making it. 

Our food came out quickly and it was great! But Elio, I'm assuming because of the order cancellation, avoided us the rest of the time we were there. At one point, he came over to ask if everything was going OK, but he was already walking away as we spoke our answers. 

Overall, the service was just terrible and even though the food was tasty, the experience was ruined due to our bad waiter. We won't be going back.",IoEr1-CEvJc60SnmLlnVVw,0,0,2,Lvok9uIZUb7FlksoMEEMeg

The decor here definitely has a SoCal feel... stickers for KROQ, The Misfits and The Ramones adorn the wall behind the bar. There is also a pretty large selection of tequila along the back of the bar, telling me that some partying definitely goes on in this place.

All of this made me curious enough to Google Hussong's, which is when I learned that this is their only cantina in the U.S. (the original is located in Ensenada, Baja California, Mexico).

I ordered the four street taco platter, two chicken and two beef, all served on corn tortillas and topped with sour cream, cheese, pico and sliced jalapenos (each topping runs 50 cents extra). The chicken tacos were excellent - probably some of the best I have ever had. The beef tacos were okay - the meat was a little tough, but not too bad.

Service here was great - the bartender immediately welcomed me when I sat down and made me a great bloody mary to start with until my food was ready. She also checked back with me several times to ensure everything tasted okay and asked if I needed anything else.

While I was eating lunch, I noticed on their ""specials"" menu that they serve Chilaquiles for breakfast, something that my brother-in-law got me hooked on that I wish now I would have ordered (I don't find this dish on too many menus).

Overall, the atmosphere here was laid back during the lunch hour, but I get the sense that this place gets very popular later at night. I will definitely be back to visit this place again on my next visit to Vegas.",m7U66xb999BrsA7xaPW2jw,0,0,4,EkzY1lOgxZgRKHPVKX6mrQ

While he waited, he stopped into Hussong's across the mall, and it couldn't have been a happier accident!  After finishing up shopping, I met him for the tail end of happy hour - half price drafts and half price nachos - amazing.  We sat at the bar and the bartender was dry witted and friendly, and we also saw him concoct some super strong margaritas!

The chicken nachos themselves were something that I'm going to be fantasizing about for months to come.  The chips were thick, the chicken was well seasoned, and the toppings were perfectly distributed across the platter.  We consider ourselves Mexican food aficionados, and these were the Holy Grail of nachos.  

A few friends met us the next day and we convinced them to come back for lunch, and everyone was very satisfied!  This time we split the mango habanero guac and the ribeye tacos at the suggestion of our previous bartender and were very impressed.

I came with a party of 5, all hoping for really good Mexican food. It was definitely not bad. But I can't tell for sure if I really felt that way or was just really tired/hungry.  I was wavering between four and three stars to this point but I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and go four.

The chips seemed authentic. They were the thick homemade style which I love. The salsa left some to be desired which was a major bummer. Salsa can make or break a Mexican restaurant in my humble opinion.

I ordered some kind of trio combination plate as I was feeling pretty indecisive. I believe it had an enchilada and taco both with meat of choice and a beef flauta. Rice and beans of course. It was good!  I would go back. I would probably try something different as I wasn't wildly pleased with my entree.

My husbands quesadillas looked and tasted pretty amazing. Just a basic chicken one off the appetizers I believe. I might go that route.

We had to meet some family for dinner at Mandalay and told them about Burger Bar's greatness.  Upon arriving we found out the BB was closed for a private event so we had to pick another place.  Since we didn't feel like walking more than 10 feet we decided on Hussong's. 

The name might be a little off-putting as it doesn't scream ""Mexican Food"" and they claim to be the inventor of the Margarita.  Still, we gave it a chance and we were pleasantly surprised.  It was a little pricey for Mexican food but cheap for Strip standards.  The waiter did an okay job but was a little slow after we ordered.  My wife had Enchiladas and the rest of us had their Chicken Tostada Salad, which was pretty delicious!  They had two fried strips of Flour Tortilla that came along with the salad rather than a fried bowl and I was a big fan!

I did have a couple of problems with the place, however.  As I said the waiter was 'ok' but he constantly tried to upsell us stuff.  I hate when they offer you Guacamole like it's on the house when it really isn't.  I'm of the opinion that if you offer it, it's free.  We didn't bite.  The biggest thing that I didn't like was the fact that their Margarita's came in Pint Glasses.  Really?  You claim to be the Margarita inventor and you're going to put them in a pint glass? I don't think so.  That alone lost a whole star for me.

The food was surprisingly plain. It started with thick tortilla chips with hot and mild salsa, neither flavorful. Both were thin versions of salsa, which is fine with me, but some flavor or even heat would be appreciated. For starters, I had the queso fundido, which was pretty good and came with soft corn tortillas to eat it with.  Then I had the steak tacos. These were completely flavorless, and improved to decent with the addition of a few good shakes of bottled hot sauce.

The margaritas were actually pretty good, but they were insanely expensive, and I'm not one to complain about cost, especially on vacation.",A_fuSdZiigwtoUJfKvwIYQ,3,0,2,rmpvckRyxiNvjm_yXsxRuQ

I tend to pass over 3.5 star averages and below on Yelp because I'm a snobby white piece of shit, but I couldn't pass over Hussong's awesome dedicated vegan menu.

First things first, props to Luis (sp?). My girlfriend and I checked in with Yelp for a free shot of tequila, and were told we could only get one -- he hooked us up with two. We also each ordered what is claimed to be the original-original margarita. True or not, it was a meaty boy (that is, high in alcohol) and tasted damn good. 

For food I got the vegan breakfast burrito and she got the vegan chilaquiles. We loved both. Luis decided being the best waiter ever wasn't enough, so he brought us out a side of street corn for my girlfriend's vegetarian sister, and a vegan side for the two of us -- limey, salty, delicious. Definitely vegan/lacking non-vegan street corn funk, but good stuff. If that wasn't enough, when we asked what they used for their vegan eggs, he brought out the container (picture attached). Talk about next-level service. 

As a last note.. as much as I dislike live music, the Mariachi band here did covers of songs like the Spongebob Squarepants theme song, Elvis, and Lil Jon. That's diversity, and it was actually entertaining. 

Hussong's is probably a great choice if you're not vegan, but if you are, it's a must. Strong drinks, excellent food, and crazy good service. Hussong's will be a definite stop from me from now on when I'm in town.",rFeXxtCeAGtWNdDWEu9I2A,0,0,5,snsNKF0XbY_iP5dH0fF8bA

First Night: 
I thought it was great! The service was awesome and the food was great. We got the carna asada plate, guac, and shrimp ceviche. Ok...the ceviche wasn't all that great. It was very small and hardly any shrimp. I like mine to be a little more zesty but this was on the more tiny bit tart. I like the tast of lemon n lime in my ceviche so I guess it really depends on your taste. The chip and salsa that they give you is yummy. I really like their chips!! thick and not too salty. 

Second Night:
Ok...we ordered the Chicken Tostada salad and Baja Hamburger. The Salad was very plain and didn't even come in a tostada bowl (am I the only one that expects it in a bowl?). ANyways, I expected it to come in a bowl and instead, there were just 2 giant tostada chips in the salad. The sauce was whatevers and hardly any corn or the other veggies mentioned from the menu. We first thought the corn was missing but when we dug dip enough, we found few...I mean FEW corn peices on the bottom. Very sad.  On to the Baja hamburger. It had bacon, ham, and avocado. It wasn't as beautiful as in the picture and it was overly salty. I guess the avocado is there to help with the saltiness but the ham was way too salty. Also, one of the workers kept dropping things. I saw him spill dressing all over a table as he was delivering food. And he also dropped plates too. Poor guy. However, our waiter never showed up to us to ask if we needed anything the whole night. I mean, the place is pretty small and he passed us by every time he had to serve another table. Didn't like that waiter.

Also, I was irritated by some loser trying to pick up on a girl at the bar.  He kept trying to make the conversation flow and asking for high fives. High fives really? ugh...it was really pathetic. She turned her body and was talking to the bartender and tried really hard to put her head in another direction or just looking down her cup. 

The music was whatevers too. I don't like loud music in my ears. I gave it a 3 since the first night was good but not so much the second night. Not bad to go at least once and check it out yourself.",wC_j3vMUL824DXVRu2fsig,1,0,3,vd005BXobLTb_kAmqXBIlw

PERKS
+ great service (attentive staff dressed in sports jerseys)
+ gigantic drinks - they have specialties such as the ""Bull Dog"" (margarita + beer), but I opted for a sangria
+ FISH TACOS ($14) two mahi mahi fish tacos were fried placed upon two corn tortillas with shredded lettuce, guacamole and pico de gallo. Very fresh and decent dish. (Note: apparently the most popular item on their menu)
+ CHIPS & SALSA & GUACAMOLE - salsas were fresh! Chips were crisp and the guac was devoured by everyone!

DIRTS
- prices: although the fish tacos were a decent meal, I thought the dish was WAY over-priced for Americanized-Mexican food (but alas, it's Vegas so they'll charge a bit more)
- noisy: my co-workers and I had a little get together here, although it was nice they were able to reserve a section for us. The whole resto is a bit noisy with the sports games going on and the chatter from all the customers
- not authentic
- mediocre drunk grub

FYI
*located in mini-strip mall walk-way in between Mandalay Bay & Luxor
*you can keep the gigantic glass of margarita once you've drank it all
*laundry list of margaritas are available 
*drinks range from $8-14
*many flat screen televisions to watch the latest sports game 
*Rick Moonen's ""RM"" restaurant is just around the corner for sustainable seafood

The Food:  Because we were in for a quick bite, we chose to split the Steak Barbacoa Burrito and get the grilled corn offered if you ""check in"". The salsa variety was very good, very fresh.  One is a typical restaurant style with tomato, jalapeño, onion and cilantro.  The other two were a roasted type one being a sweet chipotle and the other had either small chunks of Mango or Pineapple.  All very delicious.  The chips were fresh but a little too think for my liking but still good.  We got the burrito California style meaning it has French fries and guacamole in it.  So glad we did, the meat in the burrito was sweet and smoky, the sauces on top were an enchilada, a verde and a queso.  I got the guacamole on the side and it was so fresh with little chunks and a lot of lime which I am a fan of.  The roasted corn was amazing, we split that too and could have had more, just the perfect amount of spices and cojito cheese.

Service:  Really good service.  Our server was Gerardo and he was very friendly and quick.  I noticed everyone working as a team and really putting customers first.  The only hiccup was when we ordered our burrito we asked for all three sauces and I really don't think he heard us because of the noisy atmosphere but it was very quickly rectified with an apology. Food came out in a timely manner.

Check before gratuity was $23.65 for the rather Large Steak Barbacoa Burrito, grilled corn and a soda.  Plus include the unlimited chips and salsa, we only had one serving and were very satisfied with splitting the meal. Not bad, we had a wonderful experience!

Overall long periods of not checking back and overall non-attentiveness to the customer. It was easy to spot out the manager on duty who was carelessly walking the floor and chatting with the female staff with little care or attention to the problem areas.

I found out ahead of time that they had recently started a vegan menu, it wasn't posted online, but a quick email got me a copy of it. Prices were high as is to be expected in a Vegas hotel mall, but it was so tasty and the service was great. I am in love with the salsa here and love any place that brings you more than one variety. Plus the chips were slightly thicker than usual which made them extra delicious. I'm sure my giant margarita didn't hurt anything either. Mostly though I must rave about my vegan enchilada which came with gardein and daiya and the most delicious sauce. These types of mexican meals are being much more common as easy to make vegan food becomes accesible via these already manufactured product mainstays but this was still better than any similar enchilada I have ever had. It was so tasty that I decided to carry the rest of it around in a bag for the next 5 hours before finally eating it standing over a trash can on fremont street. The menu had a lot of other great looking vegan items as well, including a chili relleno, which I have never seen before. My boyfriend enjoyed his non vegan variety. I will definetetely be adding this to all my future Vegas vacations and can even say it was worth the 2 hour duece ride from my hotel on the opposite end of the strip.",3wFA8MfvpvTlxANnnJCz-w,1,1,5,aIpHO7H0la4bIZer5Xx_Wg
5544593,2016-06-04,1,e13SEvJud_vgeDR_doL4sQ,"First of all, major kudos for offering a dedicated and extensive vegan menu in addition to your regular menu. There were so many items that I wanted to try, but my tummy wasn't big enough for all the vegan things... Next time.  My family was staying at the Mandalay, so it was honestly veggie luck that Hussong's was just a few steps from our room.

On the first visit, I got the Fish Baja Tacos. The tacos were good, but it appeared that the Gardein fishless filets were 1/2 the normal size; I may have gotten 1 or 2 bites of the filet. It was basically a cabbage taco. Also, I tasted, and subsequently saw, vegan cheese inside my tacos. I do not like cheese; vegan or otherwise. The menu does not list cheese in the description, so that was perturbing.  (Side note: it is not listed in the menu description, but this dish also comes with beans and rice.)

On the second visit, I got the Chile Relleno with the Gardein Chick'n strips. This dish is supposed to come with mixed garlic, onions, tomatoes, carrots, and potatoes, then topped with Daiya (vegan cheese) shreds and avocado, served over a tostado with beans and rice.  I requested no tomatoes or cheese. What did I get? Well, I got the open poblano pepper with ""chicken"" strips, tomatoes, avocado slices, a mystery sauce drizzled atop, and the tostado, which was surrounded by a mole sauce. The garlic, onions, carrots, and potatoes were no where to be found. This is a $17 dish. I am going to need them to not omit 1/2 of the ingredients. I picked out the tomatoes and the remaining dish was good, but I wanted the rest of that darn filling!  

The beans & rice, however, were excellent. They were among some of the best and most flavorful vegan rice and beans I have ever had.  

I'd love to give some of the other menu items a try, like that Habanero Guacamole dish, and the Sopes.  But the kitchen needs to make sure they know what does and does not go in their dishes, and/or update the menu descriptions accordingly. 

They were open from 11am-11pm. Carry out orders need to placed at the bar, or you may call ahead. Hussong's Cantina is located in the Shoppes area. If you're at Mandalay Bay, simply follow the signs for the Shoppes. It's just a short walk after you've exited the escalators. If you reach Lush, you've gone too far.",rRrFcSEZOTw6iZagsIwTFQ,7,1,3,sK3CKM4ooD0iyUcGsPqzxw

5549851,2010-11-21,0,e13SEvJud_vgeDR_doL4sQ,"This restaurant is one of the best examples of overpriced strip food where the food is pretty bad.  It might be worth it for happy hour (although you can get much better deals elsewhere), but to actually visit for dinner is a complete ripoff, even with a restaurant.com certificate, which was the reason why we were here.

My husband and I wanted some dinner before we went to see the Lion King in Mandalay Bay, and brought some restaurant.com certificates to help us decide, so we ended up here.

One of the things that this restaurant prides itself on is the amount of different types of tacos and nachos and just about everything else they have.  So I had the taco plate, a pork taco and a shrimp taco.  And then, they charge about 75 cents per extra item you want on it, such as guacamole, or pickled veggies, cilantro, etc.  Restaurants that do this annoy me to no end.  I ended up getting some tomato and pickled veggies on mine, and for 75 cents each they ended up putting literally a couple of tomatoes and vegetables on them.  Such a rip off.  Also the shrimp were pathetically small and unappetizing looking.

My husband got some customized nachos that looked like one of the most disgusting plates I have ever seen.  Meat and cheese and Mayo type toppings everywhere, it made me just sick looking at it.  My husband was overwhelmed and tried to put a dent in it, but I could tell he wasn't happy with the dish either.

The price, even with our restaurant.com certificate was still majorly overpriced, and I think we walked out paying 60 bucks.  We really have no desire to go back there, ever.",PomQayG1WhMxeSl1zohAUA,5,5,1,uZJ0ODjo_wDf3faMwHAGXQ

The chips were well made, light on the oil and moderate on the salt.  The salsa was thick with nice tomato flavor that was bright, rich, and crisp.

First time I enjoyed the fish tacos. The tortillas were soft and substantial enough to not fall apart on me during my meal.  The fish had a crisp breading with a moist interior that was evenly cooked.  The lettuce was fresh and the tomatoes juicy.  The guacamole was creamy and had a small hint of lemon for freshness.  The additional bonus is that you can order an extra taco or two if you are really hungry.

The second vist I went with a pork burrito ""wet"" style or covered with sauce.  The burrito was large and well filled.  The pork was tender and rich in flavor that was been roasted.  There was also a crisp crust on the pork that added another dimension to the flavor.  The brown mole was thick and rich with a complex smokey flavor that blended well with the pork and the cheeses.  The rice was soft and served as a nice counterpoint to the rich mole and juicy pork.

Side dishes of beans and rice were standard but didn't stand out in my mind.  However, you don't go there for side dishes.  Overall this was excellent food and I would happily return to eat here.  I would probably even travel to get to Mandalay to eat here.",M4t4iuq_VtheOHSr0FNlUg,0,0,5,DDNdb4dEhQZINKkL7l80Jw

I'll start with the chips and salsa. Chips were pretty good, salsa was NOT. It reminded me of canned sauce. In fact, we asked the waitress about the salsa and found out that it also doubled as the enchilada sauce as well as the sauce they put on the wet burritos. Not much effort going on in the kitchen.

We ordered several apps and all 3 of us ordered an entree. I was going to order the tacos, but they were $4 ea for meat only and $0.45 for each addtl topping, so you could easily spend $6 per taco.....and you had to order 4 to get beans and rice....so, for 4 tacos it would cost you about $24.....yikes. The tacos were served on the mini corn tortillas that are about 3"" in diameter. 
 
Our waitress was not very good at her job. The bus boy should've actually been the waiter. She was not very attentive. In fact, we were fortunate enough to have a coupon for a free taco, so we tried one each. When we got the bill, they charged us for the tacos.....

I say that because I am a chips and salsa snob and I thought the chips were a little too salty (but the perfect thickness with the perfect crunch), the salsa verde was too salty, but the house salsa, which our waitress said may be a little spicy but was not, was perfect. I ordered the Mexican burger. It was delicious except it really should have had some sort of spread or aioli on it.

Complimentary Tortilla Chips with two types of salsa were warm but rather hard.  Much better was a very cold Lump Crab Guacamole app, served with bits of oranges, radish, and jalapenos paired with hard and round but flat fried tortillas.  It was an exciting and surprising mix of sweet and spicy flavors.

A medium-sized bowl of Pozole Soup with Guajillo Broth, Seasoned Pulled Pork, Hominy, cabbage, onions, and cilantro was quite tasty.  Not that I needed it, but I also cashed in a Yelp check in for a Grilled Corn on the Cob with Cotija Cheese and Mayo Butter, which I found to be somewhat sour.

While Diane liked her Baja Burger of a bun-enclosed 1/2 lb. hamburger patty with ham and very tasty skinny Fries, the star of the show for me was a very filling and tasty Carne Asada Burrito containing Pico De Gallo, Mexican Cheese Blend, rice, sour cream, and refried beans.  To top it off, I had it covered with Chimichanga Sauce divided in thirds: Red Sauce, Green Sauce, and Cheese Sauce.

I love a margarita that isn't made with a pre-made mix and Hussong's brought it out just the way I love it. It felt like a true Mexican margarita. The chips and salsa were quite good, but the guacamole was over the top with onions. If you love onions - go for it. If you don't... skip it. The guy next to us didn't speak English and the bartender found a translator for him. Great service - I wouldn't hesitate to return.",2-XLTj0Cfd81_XlmHo02Aw,0,0,4,bfG_YBtwHao7ToLaJh6JzQ

I had a good time throwing a few back with my dad so all it all it was a fun afternoon.",AajxivisYgLtPiXLz6bKnA,1,0,3,yKqeyMdfUo15R-obAIycnw

With a name like Hussong's Cantina and that look you don't know what to expect.  We were pleasantly surprised! We sat at the bar and had a great bartender (a female) who made our margaritas the way we wanted it.  She did not use any sour mix. It was real ingredients using lime juice, which you don't get going to a place like TGIFridays.  We got a great buzz. We had the ceviche and chips and salsa. I was told the chips were gluten free. They were yummy, but be forewarned. It was so hot (ceviche and salsa) that I needed milk to swish around my mouth, and was chugging water.  Whew! Would like them to take it easy on the spiciness! Worth the pain though.",fvIlcKJnecE5Yha7X9siFQ,0,0,4,kIdxvDEunROkGZGs1YR3oQ

While we were seated right away, we didn't get a server for at least twenty minutes. Even tough we did get chips and salsa, we were waiting so long for service that we went through the chips and had to serve ourselves another basket. 

Once we finally flagged down a server, we got to order. The food took at least another twenty minutes to arrive. And three of us just got the quesadilla! 

Now, the food. When a quesadilla is on the menu for $8, it's typically enough for a meal. The quesadilla was one corn tortilla with some cheese and like three pieces of meat. It was so small that it made the price offensive -- and it wasn't even that good! 

To add to such a bad experience, three of the five people ended up with stomach aches. I would not recommend this place at all, especially given the fact that Burger Bar is next door and is about the same price.",8zpsKgYaCN7kO-lRCJ-B1A,1,0,2,8xBR74GhkOUNmChC1wSCUg

5986123,2016-08-14,0,e13SEvJud_vgeDR_doL4sQ,"Awesome authentic food. Our waiter was amazing, he was very friendly and super efficient.
I gave this 4 stars for the simple fact that there were almost no vegetables on our plate. There was a good portion of meat and seasoning but no veggies to be found. I know it is in the middle of the dessert but if you are shipping in everything else, don't cheap out the veg. Those would make the dishes very fresh. The food was great but lacking the critical element of veggies. 
I was a little hesitant that it was located in the walkway between Casinos as it had a mall atmosphere but once inside, it had a really comfy feel with the mariachi band and aromatic dishes.",TcPgVR_SL16LgdRVR8Y7xw,1,0,4,GLBeMPi5Ijy3qdstZhEqew
