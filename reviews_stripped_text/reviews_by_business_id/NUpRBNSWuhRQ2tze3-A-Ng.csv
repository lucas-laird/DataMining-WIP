148933,2013-11-14,0,NUpRBNSWuhRQ2tze3-A-Ng,OK so I have to say upfront I paid $1.95 for the buffet because it came with a sale for the Australian Bee Gees tribute band.  I see why the reviews are so bad on here I mean the place kind of makes you feel bad for it compared to other offerings.  I would like to go out on a limb and point out a few things I did like.  Well the crab legs were thin as a dime but the meat tasted better then imitation.  The Brownie and marsh mellow stuff was great and so was the crème brulee cheesecake.  If I paid regular price I think I would give it 2 stars based solely on the strength of the deserts.,t9NLNLXUAXyZDkQM5hgAFQ,0,0,3,2vwO1pNU0NZmWVS_6SddcA

Not alot of vegetarian options even though its a BUFFET, and the food looked old and stale.  We ate anyways and by 8pm when we were going to a show we all got sick from the food.

167652,2013-10-05,0,NUpRBNSWuhRQ2tze3-A-Ng,"I had pretty low expectations for this place.  Being one of the cheaper and older buffets on the strip, I expected very little.  I was expecting Old Country Buffet levels of quality and service, and they couldn't even rise to that standard.  Still, we had a comped all-day pass at Luxor and Excalibur, so we figured it couldn't hurt to try them both.

Upon arrival, the first thing I noticed was that half of the buffet was closed off and there was no line to get in at noon.  This should have been our cue to turn around and walk away.

After waiting for the three women working the desk to finish their conversation, we were seated and told to help ourselves.  The selection was poor, though it did match OCB on variety (that is to say there wasn't much).  The pork roast looked appealing, but was flavorless and dry.  The ravioli was the same consistency between the filling and the pasta.  The fruit selection was mostly empty.

I gave up on the entree and decided to try dessert.  A little boy (unsupervised) was taking cheesecake off the shelf, poking it with his finger, putting it back, and repeating.  This was while two employees were only a few feet away chatting it up.

I passed on the pies.  Thinking the ice cream would be better, I headed towards the machine only to watch a different child ""scoop out"" the ice cream nozzle with his finger.  Then a little girl used her bare hand to grab ice cream toppings and put them on her sundae.  I set my bowl down and walked away, but not before noticing that someone had thoughtfully returned their used ice cream cone (no bites missing, but the inside was dripping ice cream) to the counter.

Even if it's free, do not eat here.  Go anywhere else.",Rxby4yOh1ksG9SlXLIhVNw,0,0,1,gsGjLP8mnzXezjXJ03ZrQQ

Oh well, you live and learn I guess. Any way, the layout of the restaurant turned me off as it reminded me of a cafeteria, and I was not impressed by the offerings of the food. Everything was mediocre tasting, except for the penne with marinara sauce, that was actually really good. Everything else was very average. This is the 3rd time I've been to Vegas, and the 3rd time we have gone to a buffet (different hotel every time). Every time I'm a little disappointed, but I guess my mindset is ""When in Vegas, eat at a buffet"". Will not be doing a buffet here again for a long time.

For $25 you would think a buffet could at least serve something that didn't resemble yesterday's catering rubbish. The crab legs were old and plastic-like, the mussel I tried I immediately spit out, ribs were total garbage, even the pasta was overcooked and tasteless. 

The only saving grace was the premium water dispenser and the dessert area. Avoid at all costs.",yPMEorE_TXIj9GODSSPnZg,0,0,1,nm3rIgmH9JhWYjSMzfG8iw
270898,2011-01-17,0,NUpRBNSWuhRQ2tze3-A-Ng,"Service was OK - maybe a little better than average. At one point I tried to get chocolate milk and it was out. I went and sat down. The guy who was upkeeping the drink station at the time found my table to tell me he was refilling the chocolate milk. That was pretty cool but other than that the customer service was generically mediocre.

This place is a value proposition. None of the food is good but almost all of it was passable. If you eat for the sake of satiating your stomach then I guess that's fine, but I really want to enjoy my food. For $25 or $30 (depending on day) you can get unlimited buffets for a day. The ingredients used are very low grade and you'll likely fill up faster than you think you should. It might even make you sick if you're used to eating fairly healthy. But $30 for an all day buffet is one of the best prices you'll find on the Strip. The free drink selection is also pretty good and I like being able to refill my own cup instead of waiting for a crappy waiter to come by (like some Vegas buffets).

The one star reviews are pretty unfair but I will never go back so I can't rate it 3 stars (which is my cut off for a restaurant I'd at least consider going to again). You're much better off with the fast food options in Excalibur or on the Strip.",NklljnSkjvT9Jxl-6X4ryQ,0,0,2,6NOo9AyHIscPXOcDbWpY5Q

I don't really know what to say here except they had all your standard breakfast fare but it was all dried out or soggy. It was not fresh at all. I ddin't even bother to go back and get more food. There was a dessert area that had pastries and donuts. Meh.

The highlight was the waiter who managed to make us laugh.

in response to a comment I read down below, yes the food is mass produced but that doesn't mean it can't be great food. There are many other buffets that actually get it right. Try one of those and stay far away from this place.",AZ0DjXBAXKka2ToOgpcUew,0,0,2,wkXuew_oOWTxYRurbzwFMQ

There was almost nothing to eat cause half the buffet was not even running and it was 7 pm when we went.there desserts were nasty. How can you fuck up cake and what not?

It was not what I expected but you eat what you pay for. Not saying the food was bad....because it was tolerable, but my stomach was a bit confused. 
HOWEVER, the redeeming point for me what their dessert. There were soooo many options and they were all delicious. Even their soft serve ice cream was good and creamy. And their cappuccino machine made excellent coffee, I was impressed.

368812,2011-01-18,0,NUpRBNSWuhRQ2tze3-A-Ng,"Ewwwwwwwwwww! Just for the sake of argument we went here twice. The first time was for dinner buffet and the only reason we came here was we had a $5 off coupon for each person (limit 4). It came with the coupon book when you check into the Excalibur hotel. I grabbed it by accident - I had meant to grab a different $5 off buffet coupon and I didn't want to walk all the way back to my room to get the other coupon. 

Dinner took about 10 minutes to be seated. I don't get it... the place is huge and they only let people eat on one side of the restaurant. The buffet is not user friendly and people were walking into each other since the buffet area is chained off so you had to follow a certain path. Only on this path, some people are grabbing the plate and walking down the line like they should be and other people are grabbing a plate from a different area and walking against the flow of people. 

They had very little vegetables and a salad bar. The rest of the food was mediocre and I thought if anything at least I'll have prime rib. The buy cut a slice and the middle was completely raw. People all around me at other tables were giving the busboy people their plates with the raw meat on it. The manager was notified and came to talk to me. She asked if I wanted it more cooked. Yeah of course! But I never got my steak back and when I went up to the buffet line, they had removed it from the dinner menu. 

The next morning, my co-workers and I wanted to eat breakfast. I opted to go someplaces else but they didn't want to talk to far. They chose this place. The breakfast line was maybe 50 people deep waiting for seats... and this morning, the other side of the restaurant was shut down and empty while yesterdays empty side was being seated. We waited 30 minutes and after we paid we had to wait another 30 minutes. Since there were 9 of us, they said we had to wait for 2 tables. I thought they meant they were going to put 2 tables together but they gave us 2 booths. Oh hell no. We all wanted to sit at the same table. So that was another 10 minutes. After over an hour passed we were starving. But that didn't make the food taste any better. The scrambled eggs looked disgusting as the sausage patties were dried out and tasted even worse. 

Since we had waited so long, they started serving lunch. So one side of the buffet was still breakfast and the other side was lunch. All I ate was mac and cheese and fruit. Everything else was horrible tasting. Oh, there was this beverage machine - you can get lime water. I thought it tasted good more like a Sprite without the carbonation.",Ie_CcUbW22Ov0rOMaBU5QA,0,0,1,7165vKtU520P7uKeUSKvtg

427641,2013-05-31,0,NUpRBNSWuhRQ2tze3-A-Ng,"The buffet had a lot of options. There were cultural options, including Asian, Mexican, and Italian. The highlight of the buffet was the crab legs. They were salty (of course, being from the sea). The best part is they were already cut in half, making it infinitely easier to eat crab legs. The chicken was a bit well done as was the fish. Both were tough, but what is to be expected from a buffet.  Drinks are self service as well. 
There is plenty of seating area, and not much wait on a week night. Going down the main line, it was salad/cold options, soups, seafood (crab legs, shrimp, cocktail shrimp), italian foods (pizza, pasta), American food (roasted chicken, ribs, fish, etc.). At the end are the Mexican options (rice, beans, tortillas, tamales, etc.) and Asian (orange chicken, chow mein, chow fun, etc.).

758145,2009-07-28,8,NUpRBNSWuhRQ2tze3-A-Ng,"I love cafeteria-style food. Always have, always will. I cried when they shut down the good, old-fashioned, cafeteria-style eatery at my college and opened a ""gourmet"" food emporium in its place.

Because I'll take a Salisbury steak over a t-bone any day, I figured the Round Table buffet would be just what the doctor ordered to satisfy my gambling-weary belly. My low standards were unflappable... or so I thought

SWEET CHRIST WAS I WRONG!

This was, and forever will be, the single worst meal of my entire life. I am just dumbfounded. How on earth is it possible to have 90 different foods available, with not a single one being even remotely edible? It is almost like they TRIED to make it horrible. Really.

Beyond tasting bad, I got the distinct feeling that everything I put in my mouth was diseased. The ""shrimp"", if they could be called that, looked less like they had been caught fresh, and more like they had died of AIDS. I've never seen shrimp that oddly thin before. Really, it looked like they had survived some sort of shrimp holocaust. Same with the ""clams"". The meat from the carving station was so tough I couldn't cut it with my knife, but the effort was rewarded by a taste that suggested the flesh was infected with the prions that cause Krutchfield-Jacobs disease. The chickens that gave their lives for this dinner service likely came from one of those Chinese industrial farms that are responsible for influenza pandemics.

And I could make better lo-mein, despite the fact that I have no clue where to even begin, because I wouldn't cook it in used engine grease. That is what it tasted like.

The only reason I left this meal with a full stomach was because I had to try everything in a desperate attempt to find something I could eat. By the time I had failed in this task, I had literally taken one bite of every offering they had, and found myself full with a bizarre stew of various meats and cheeses and sauces and doughs and the following types of organisms known to cause severe food poisoning: Clostridium botulinum, Ciguatera, Yersinia, Shigella, Listeria monocytogenes, E Coli EC 0157, Bacillus cereus, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Clostridium perfringens, Staphlococcus aureus, Campylobacter jejuni, and Salmonella.

Now the clientele at the Round Table Buffet was another source of pleasure. Never have I seen so many people in the same room eating food while a lit cigarette dangled from their mouth. But this was also the only ""restaurant"" where such a practice would actually improve the taste of the food, or at least mask the odor of decay. Beyond them, I was also treated to a fair share of trailer-trash in wedding dresses bragging about how much they drank at Bennigan's the night before, and folks who looked like they were missing 9 to 12 chromosomes (though I am happy to report that the chromosome that enables one to find a store that still sells fanny packs was certainly still present and active in most of them).

To wrap up:

Food: Disgusting and Diseased.
People: Yowsa.
Overall: I want to kill myself.

758621,2010-09-15,0,NUpRBNSWuhRQ2tze3-A-Ng,"The Roundtable Buffet was an excellent deal at $25/all day but the quality was mediocre at best. We had a member of our party with a food allergy and we specifically emailed them weeks in advance to find out how their food was prepared and to say they were less than honest would be an understatement. Of course, we didn't find this out until we were into the dinner service and the member of our party happened to notice a piece of shellfish which she is severely allergic to in a salad that she was told should be safe. 


Regardless of the allergy issues, If you've ever been to Hometown Buffet or Golden Corral, you'll have an expectation of the quality of food you'll be receiving. It's not mind-blowing, but it's not terrible either. The quality is sufficient and they seem to do a decent job at rotating things as they become old or empty.

In terms of the management of volume, they were completely unprepared to deal with the amount of people at the dinner service. They had 4 buffet bars total, but only had one open and the line was out the door to even get in, then again long to get any food on the buffet, and terribly long if you wanted to get anything at the ""cutting station"".

The floors in the little rooms where you self-serve drinks were sticky and you had to double-check your cups as one batch we noticed didn't appear to be completely clean.

Overall, if you're willing to save a few bucks and don't have any food allergies, the Roundtable may be for you. The $25/day deal can't be beat, just be sure you're diligent while visiting this aging buffet.",1qbXEjOkGFt8bv7cOMBzgw,1,0,2,6l9vO5gViT_wU_g7hDou9g

893434,2009-02-27,0,NUpRBNSWuhRQ2tze3-A-Ng,"So I went here TWICE on Valentine's weekend (no, not on the 14th) with the lady friend. We went around 8 one night and then the next afternoon for the 2 for 1 from 2-6. We went there not because I'm cheap - it was practical considering both of our money limitations. And she's not cheap either.

From my experience - for under 20 bucks it ain't bad at all (I would give it 4 stars, but I'm giving it 5 due to the jerks who gave it 1 or 2 stars for reasons mentioned below). Reading other people's reviews for this buffet and others I think that a lot of people go in with the wrong expectations/perspective:

It's a friggin' buffet for pete's sake! You're supposed to eat as much as your stomach can handle so that you don't have to go to 3 restaurants that day! If you expect the food to be even close to gourmet you shouldn't be at a buffet in the 1st place. Or you should be at one of those $50 a pop ones. Kapeesh? Buffets are meant to let you get your ultimate bang for your buck - which is most easily accomplished with going back for refills numerous times. Even though the hotel - casino's make a lot of money, they don't want to lose too much on the buffet. Basic economics people (and I didn't even take any econ classes)!

Yeah, a lot of their food was on the greasy side - but then again, I was in the mood for some greasy food and so was she. Plus, it's a buffet - making greasy food helps them keep prices down. The buffet had enough variety (the fish was a nice surprise)and some healthier options. We stayed for a good 2 hours (total) each time so our tummies could get a rest before getting some dessert.

The staff was nice - actually, I loved the whole medieval theme at the Excalibur, made me feel like a kid playfully fighting (on guard!). I thought the whole thing where the staff person waiting at your table waved the flag so you could find your table was awesome - it's little unique things like that that made the experience even better.

Oh - and when we had to wait over an hour for the 2 for 1, I ain't complaining the slightest bit. It's OUR own fault that we didn't get there earlier. Come on, do you expect there to be no line at a buffet when it's 2 for 1? If you expect that, I suggest you repeat kindergarten........ seriously.

We had read some of the negative reviews but decided to try it anyway. We were NOT disappointed! I mean, the food was not excellent, but what buffet is? 

If you walk into a buffet expecting it to be a Zagat 30 rating or AAA 5 diamond joint, then of course you will be let down.

Adjust your expectations to allow for the fact that the food is pretty much mass produced instead of cooked to order and you'll write a much more accurate review.

We bought the all-day pass and it ended up being a great deal! Of course there are things that are not good. The taco station was worse than you would get at a Taco Bell and their attempt at oriental cuisine was pretty laughable.

1138795,2009-12-03,1,NUpRBNSWuhRQ2tze3-A-Ng,"I opted for the dinner buffet for $18.99 - I was not particularly tempted to try the all day 'eat till you puke' deal for $29.  I actually comparison shopped the other bufftets around it (Mandalay Bay, Luxor) and it looked roughly comparable (sans one or two higher end items like shrimp and crab) for a bit lower price.

As with most buffets, I like to try a small portion of anything I can get my hands on and usually I can find an item or two that I really like.  I frankly don't remember one food item that I enjoyed.  Among the lowlights: Unintentionally cold lasagna (keep the steam tables filled Sir Lunchalot!), Unintentionally dry and chewy beef ribs (characteristics I love - when I'm eating beef jerky), Unintentionally runny pie (maybe intentional - see Randy Quaid in Vegas Vacation), and it goes on.

I'm adding a half a star because it is relatively inexpensive and I did enjoy the nacho chips and beverage station where they had some sort of knockoff low-cal vitamin water (for the health conscious among us at the Roundtable Buffet).  One more half a star for the bathroom fixturing.  This is the first buffet I have eaten at where they have a sharps disposal bin (i.e. disposal bin for needles after you inject yourself with insulin so you can go out into the trough and kill yourself some more) in the powder room.

Coincidentally, I think the same food that wad on the buffet then is still there today. I went because I was hungry and it was close. I also hadn't slept in 32 hours. Until now, I was unaware that you could mess up coffee to the point where it makes instant coffee made on a camping stove taste like gourmet. It too tasted like it had been there since my last visit. To say its terrible is an understatement on the sale of calling WWII a slight misunderstanding. The only reason I gave it a star is because yelp made me to write a review.

Considering Mandalay Bay's buffet is only $7 more and offer MUCH better selection and quality, this is an epic fail.  
Stay away at all cost!

1.  No wait in line to be seated. (With this quality, who would come?!?) I should know better when I saw the dinning room was pretty empty.

We woke up too late for breakfast, so I can't comment on that part of the buffet.

Our first meal there was lunch and it was good. It's not like the food was amazing or anything, but I didn't think it was horrible either.  I mainly ate different salads for lunch.  The salad bar portion was pretty extensive compared to other buffets. I made my own salad with spinach, iceberg, carrots, tomatoes, cheese, etc. I even made another one, which was the asian style with the oriental dressing, mandarin oranges, and the crispy noodle strips (not wonton ones). I also tried their chicken, which was slightly dry, but not bad. I had their scalloped potatoes which were pretty good.  They have a variety of desserts and we tried different ones. I'm a simple girl though so my favorite was plain vanilla ice cream. Their creme brûlée was not brûlée'd at all, so I wasn't very happy about that dessert.

They have a variety of american, mexican, and asian (chinese mainly) dishes.

I went back again around 5 to snack and study since my feet were dying and everyone else wanted to go walking on the strip.  The salad portion mainly stayed the same, but warm dishes changed here and there.

We went back for dinner and it was even better.  I mainly had salad again and their crab legs. They weren't the best ever, but still pretty good.  They weren't too salty like some places make it.  I thought it was great that they cut the legs in half (length-wise) so I didn't have to deal with cracking them open and making a huge mess. They also had sushi and more seafood options than at lunch.

Overall I thought it was good. I think it's a great deal if you wake up early enough to go for breakfast, lunch, snack, and dinner time.

If you are a vegetarian, I wouldn't think it's the best deal.  Yes there are good veggie options, but a lot of the time I saw things mixed in.  For instance, I was grabbing some cheese for my salad but someone had dropped some shrimp into it (the shrimp container was right behind the cheese one).

I think breakfast is the tastiest meal, you can even stay for lunch too during that awkward turnaround.  

Scrambled eggs, omelette station, toast, TONS OF BACON!, sausages, french toast, waffles, pancakes, boiled eggs, eggs benedict, biscuits, country gravy, tater tots, sometimes hash browns, ham, etc.

Just don't get those fried mini burrito things, it's gross.  I forgot what else was gross, but yea, don't get those.

They also have a full dessert bar during breakfast, so why not? Self-serve drinks, which I think is brilliant, you don't have to wait for the waiters/waitresses and you can walk off your meal bit by bit.

Oh, I'd like to also add that this buffet really wastes food, when breakfast is over, they toss everything in the trash... =[ but I guess it's ok, it feeds all the pigs that eventually become bacon...

I came here for breakfast using the $3 off coupon, but came right before lunch so both breakfast and lunch were served.  I left quite hungry because nothing here was very appetizing or tasty.  First of all, the salad selection is quite lacking and unappetizing.  The pasta salads were also pretty gross looking.  I tried a few and was not the least bit interested in a second bit.

You can tell most of the food here (minus the omelet bar) came from the freezer.  There's fried chicken, corn dogs, meat loaf, mashed potatoes, etc.  All were just reheated.  They have a section with eggs, chorizo, waffles- none of which looked very freshly made.  There is a section for hot dogs and hamburgers as well as knock off Mexican and Chinese food.  I didn't bother because it was all so gross looking.  

For dessert, they have a large selection of cakes and a soft serve machine.  I don't think any of it is house made either.  

Lastly, I hate getting up to get my own drinks.  Yes, it sounds lazy, but the buffet is so poorly laid out.  You go one direction to get food.  Then you go another direction to get drinks.  You definitely burn some calories getting together a full meal.

Overall, the food is definitely not worth eating unless you are less than 10 years old and don't care.  The staff is super friendly but they have too many tables so plates take a while to be cleared.

In execution these abominations were really more akin to salmonella Hot Pockets with the outside cauterized into a leathery shell and the inside a viscous snot pocket of uncooked egg. Not even wrapping them in a tortilla, slathering them with cheese, salsa and sour cream could even save these leatherback puke pouches.

Alright then, eggs are a pass. Let's move onto the pork products. You can't mess up pork products, right?

Good god, yes you can apparently.

The sausages were finger-length vessels of fail wrapped around latex-strength casings. To fully understand how it felt to cut one of these things I recommend you take a Robusto sized cigar and attempt to cut it crosswise into one inch segments. I think I used to make log cabins out of these things when I was a child.

Terrible bacon? A statement like that should be nothing more than an oxymoron, or perhaps an ironic band name. But seriously, how do you fuck up bacon? It was more like tasteless crumbling wood chips. I'd just assume glue a bunch of Bacos together and eat that instead.

Next I thought that perhaps the French Toast would make amends for the pillaging my taste buds have already incurred. Nope, the pillaging continued as I tried futilely to cut a bite-sized piece of the eggy bread bricks with my knife and fork. The slices were so tough that they actually resisted the maple syrup I had drenched them with. You know, the French have a version of their eponymously named bread called, ""Pain perdu"". Now, while the word, ""pain"" is certainly a poignant way to describe eating one of these Rubbermaid breakfast sponges, I really feel the best way to describe the Roundtable Buffet's French Toast is to use the literal translation of ""Pain perdu"", ""Lost Bread"". Truly, this dish was a tragic loss indeed.

In the end I settled on a bowl of cottage cheese, an unpeeled orange and some pith-heavy grapefruit slices. For the next half hour I nursed a cup of (serviceable) coffee while my stomach curdled, whimpered and bubbled in discontent.

Before we left however, my friends and I made one final gruesome discovery. 

The meatballs.

Having arrived during brunch a small number of the buffet stations were serving luncheon fare. As almost a sort of macabre experiment to attain absolute certainty that the Roundtable Buffet at the Excalibur was the worst dining experience found on ""The Strip"", my friend brought back a small sampling from the Italian station. On his plate lie a minute serving of penne pasta with a meaty marinara sauce and a single, innocent looking meatball. A Tuscan inspired amuse-bouche perhaps? No. More like a vomi-bouche, or even, an amuse-fail. The meatball positively reeked. My friend couldn't eat more than a thumbnail-sized sliver before pushing the plate away in disgust. His wife, upon catching a whiff of the plate, rather insistently demanded that it be removed from the table. Somewhere in the distance I'm sure I heard a wolf howl.

To those who claim, ""You get what you pay for!"" I call bullshit. I consistently eat far superior meals for well under $14.00 every week. The fare here in inexcusable; the fact that we waited in line before entering is baffling.

So, to all the lords and ladies staying at the Excalibur, I say the following. Should you be swept up in the medieval theme that surrounds you at the Excalibur, please know that bravery is not attained at the Roundtable, only food poisoning.",vrTcY2cte-YbVh4XCQ6JqA,10,8,1,Mmb2I6dUbnXzB2itK0bLfw

So I had a National Lampoon's Vegas Vacation moment while at the buffet. Think of the scene when Clark and Eddie are at the bargain buffet in downtown and the food was mislabeled. Yep - that happened to me when I looked at what was labeled as Pork Loin. It didn't look like pork loin but it did look good so I decided to try it. Well it turned out to be fish and ended up being the best thing that I took. 

It was New Year's eve so maybe that is why things look the way they did. Things seemed to look a bit dry or really oily. 

I'm not saying I wouldn't go back and I only had the dinner buffet this time so maybe the breakfast and lunch buffets aren't as bad. I don't know if I would pay again to have their food here but if it was free then I might not turn it down.",yj8qKmj-6PeWa-G2191Jkw,1,0,2,gBACA8OkIBKviARzXoCElw

This is a place to come to when you have no other options. Let's start with the pricing. It was $21 and then almost $30 if you wanted champagne, which was klassy Korbel and came in a mini bottle. The first time I was here, I chose that Korbel because I wanted a mimosa. Did not order again. 

The interior of the place is large and boring, but it's a buffet so why would you expect any less, right? 

Onto the food... Not the best food in the world. I always ate breakfast here and it was disappointing but good enough for the time being. The eggs looked like they were dyed with yellow food coloring and were a bit dense, like they were powdered. The bacon was overly greasy and fatty. Their biscuits, although kept in a warm steamy bin, were almost rock hard on the outside and the butter provided was cold and hard... which makes the butter hard to spread. Their coffee was okay, nothing special. 

I wouldn't eat here again.",sbVdImPlVRuf3-byN1F16A,0,0,2,b5kyws2mBoT-cJ1-A3vaaw

Yeah, I used a Jambi chant to describe this restaurant. Sue me.

My boyfriend really likes this place, but he also is completely content eating Chef Boyardee's Beef Ravioli every night for dinner with a side of El Monterey Burritos, so I should've known better than to trust his judgment. 

We went here for brunch, so fortunately we were able to get both breakfast and lunch options. I enjoyed that. Star. Decently priced in comparison to other buffets. $17.99. I like that too. Two stars. 

And that concludes the bonus points for this round.

Unfortunately, the food was pretty bleh. I love breakfast food so much and actually feel it's pretty hard to get it wrong, but I was wrong to think that. Their waffles were super crisp. Even with syrup, you feel like you're biting into 3 day old bread. Eggs were yucky. They did have an omelete station, so at least there's that. Biscuits were way too hard as well. I don't eat pork, so I can't comment on their bacon or sausages, but they didn't look very appetizing either. Their fish dishes actually looked pretty good, but I didn't give them a try. Someone try them and let me know. 

They have a full salad bar which I didn't take advantage of, because, duh, I'm in Vegas and Vegas is all about poor food choices, right? They had a few pasta selections that were okay. Honestly, everything was bleh. Not TERRIBLE, but not good either. They did have quite the array of desserts. This made me very excited. Until I tried their mini pana cotta and it was gross and I spit it out. Their mini tiramisu was okay enough for me to not spit it out, but not enough for me to finish it.

If you're about quantity over quality, then you'll be pretty content with this place. Decent amount of options for a mere $17.99 at lunch: Not bad. However, I'm pretty sure I would've been more content having a personal pan pizza from the Pizza Hut over at the food court.

Roundtable tries to go with the renaissance them, but I think it's lacking a theme as nice as the other resorts. I think it could look fun with some work. The food was mainly  bad american food such as corndogs, pizza, and chicken strips.

They have all your expected stations: Asian, meat, vegetarian, seafood, etc. I didn't try it, but my mom swears by their soups. Apparently, they're the best thing on God's green earth, but I was too busy stuffing my face with prime rib (dang, my mouth is watering at the very thought of it right now). 

One thing that stood out to me: the desserts. Holy smokes, they have custom crepes here. THE NUTELLA OPTION gives this an extra freaking star. They'll heat up the batter right in front of you (always interesting to see how the crepe is formed), and they'll dump on all types of fruits on it (cranberries, blueberries, strawberries, pineapple, banana), whipped cream, and that delcious hazelnut chocolate paradise spread. Biting into this finely crafted invention of milennia of human cuisine crafting was transcendant. I saw the heavens part. I saw the light. Angels dumped enlightenment into my mouth.

Even my meat-lover husband can't remember a desirable thing on his plate - and he's a self-proclaimed garbage disposal.

Regular price is $16, but the coupon book had $3 off, so at $13 I'm rating this place 3 star.

I liked it ok and actually came back a second time.  A big breakfast will get me thru most of the day.

I mean really, things like bacon (huge piles of it), sausage, hash browns, corned beef hash, fresh fruit and yogurt are rather hard to mess up, and they dont here, its all fine. 

In the back they have an omeleete station where you can order your fried eggs, so head here first.  

They also had some mexican selections, beans and scrambled egg/chorizo, and a dessert area that I didnt need to visit.

Coffee strong, juice ok.  Drinks are self serve here, wish they could at least bring a carafe around since its sort of a pain to keep refilling it.

Ya, I'd recommend the breakfast buffet here for $13.

The Veggies were lightly steamed and still crisp and very tasty

The Thia Ribs were nice and tender but still firm and not dried out with lots of flavor

the fish was nice and firm and didn't taste fishy or smell and it wasn't dried out or over cooked

The Roast they were carving up fresh was Perfect !!! 
it was nice and pink in the middle, and it was more Tender than the Prime Rib I had for dinner last night 

the salad Bar was really nice fresh veggies all looked green and were crisp and they have whole boiled eggs a nice touch IMO, they also have Mellon, Honey Dew and Cantaloupe, also Bananas, and they have Pita wedges and Humus, the Humus was very good also

the Dessert bar had about 5 different Pies and 5 Different Cakes, they also have brownies and cobbler, plus soft serve Ice Cream, all the Pastries looked to be make in sugar free also that's  a cool option

Bad: At first, I was disappointed because only one of two very long buffet tables were open. My assumption is that only one was open because I was eating dinner during the less crowded mid-week. Even more disappointing was the fact that both sides of the one buffet were mirror images of each other. I kept feeling like the selection of food was shrinking before I even sat down.
 
Good: When I visited, there was a BOGO promo. So the buffet only cost me and my partner about $10 each. You really can't beat that. However, had I paid full price (about $19), I still would have been satisfied. While there were a few items on the buffet that did not appear fresh, there were others that were fresh.

3044631,2010-11-22,2,NUpRBNSWuhRQ2tze3-A-Ng,"Ok let me start by saying no one to blame but myself. Reason I am stating that early on is last year I ate here and it was the most disgusting food ever! I spent the next two days on the can! 

So what brought me here again for more torture? Laziness, kindness, ignorance, maybe a little of all the above. 

I was in Vegas for work and stayed at the Excalibur hotel and was in the room contemplating what to eat. I knew that the MGM had received some mighty good ratings and I thought about that. I went on line and saw they had Alaskan King Crab legs and prime rib. Sounds good, but I also didn't want to walk across the street and brave the crowds in the street. Another issue was I wanted to try it with my significant other so I decided to just stay in house. 

So I decided to walk down stairs and eat at the Excalibur. OMG what happens next is hard to explain. I noticed that they had 3 bars and only one was open. I started in the beginning and they had do it your self Cesar salad, do it your self Asian salad and do it your self salad bar. That alone took up about 1/3 of the food section. 

Next I noticed some fine gourmet foods that left me speechless like frozen style pizza, corn dogs and mac and cheese. I immediately thought of National Lampoons Vegas Vacation, damn I wanted the blue stuff. 

The ribs were chewy, the Asian food was cold, the selection was terrible. 

It was all the same stuff as last time I ate here. Considering how tough the food was it might have actually been the same! 

I ended up back in the can again for 24 hours and like I said before it was my fault. 

The staff was another issues. I see on other posts they were compared to prison guard, I like to think they were zombies. Maybe they lost there life savings and were now slaves to the casino, either way they were terrible. I saw one man with 5 empty plates on his table and the staff just looked at him and ignored the plates. (coming to think of it how the hell can he eat that much) 

I will never ever go there again even if it was my last meal and it was free and I was being served by Holly Madison!",UKAEc75siVnUbt89eDKeKg,0,1,1,MsllBVV7_9tTbyOcUr9fGA

But in hindsight, you really get what you're paying for as the selection is not the finest nor is it really abundant.  Bonus points for the fact they serve horchata (Mexican drink) during breakfast and lunch!  The decor is reminiscent of a Knight's table, coinciding with the theme of the King's Knights of Excalibur. Service has always been good, but it doesn't make up for the blandness of the food. If you're coming from college and don't have much money to spend, then here is a good place to cure your hangover.

My rating of 4 stars here is based on it being a cheesy buffet...if you're looking for a classy restaurant, give your head a shake for stopping here.

The food was about as good as I've tasted at a buffet restaurant, but what really makes the place stand out is that they had so much of it!  Everything was full too, no plates were empty, and it was all hot.

I stayed away from the sushi, (you should probably too), but other than that and some salads I think I tried about everything!  It was awesome!

They have a cool system of entry where you don't pay the waitress, you pay an admission charge at the front gate instead...like some crazy ride.  Then you buy your alcohol inside if you're drinking, and just leave a tip on the table.  (I could have left a tip at the gate on my bill as well but wanted to see how much of a tip I should leave).

Walking around the buffet and selecting my food items, I felt like I was in a HomeTown Buffet, but with better quality food.

I found a lot of stuff that I liked, like chicken wings, shrimp cocktail, BBQ ribs and of course the desserts. The 'sushi' as with many of the dishes in the Chinese section (Sushi? Chinese?) were definitely 'Meh.' I passed on the Mexican food section because I thought it would be too fattening to add to the already fattening food I chose. I like the self serve beverage bar. Nice selection of juices and sodas.

There was an entire alley of soda machines, tons of food, pretty decent price, and a dessert-ed island (see what I did there?)

We took advantage of one of my three rewards from the MLife group, app ""MyVegas"" that gave us buy one get one free buffet Breakfast or Lunch from this establishment. We took them up for breakfast and so that meant, in Vegas, two eating for $17 bucks. Under 10 bucks per person? Did I just zap back to 1995 Las Vegas?

Yes the restaurant is dated, it's been the same for years.. but don't get me started again on foodie rants expecting 5 stars... 

This particular buffet has a plethora of options for the palette of anyone. Out of the three buffet's the girlfriend and I took part in.. it did have the least selection (Luxor had a Middle Eastern selection under one section)

The omelette station is great if you time your breakfast right (that's a you problem, not their fault) and almost all the food was good. No issues there.

A great selection of drinks from coffee's to cappuccinos to chocolate and white milk to apple, orange, and grapefruit juice. They have it all!

A very serviceable and affordable breakfast.",2qTCiejiaPcHD2vawRrWZg,4,2,4,menvx5vh6h__hd69meVzTQ

We used a 2-for-1 myvegas breakfast comp (thankfully) and were really disappointed even though it was only $17.50. The sausage was gross/greasy, eggs were dry, chorizo tasted like plastic, the desserts were dismal and the oj didn't taste like juice. The only things we enjoyed were the beans (which we were told were vegetarian but weren't) and bacon.

Then I noticed that, unlike most other Vegas buffets which have several hundred reviews, this one only has about 60. I figure there are two possible reasons for this: One, maybe they had trouble finding it through the search function, like I did.

Two, and more likely, people don't review this buffet because it's just not very good.

Don't get me wrong - I like Excalibur's cheesy, slightly dirty interior and vibe. I dig the cheap hot-dog-and-beer deal you get at the sports book. And I think I'd be okay with the Excalibur's buffet - if only they didn't charge so much for it. This is a downtown-caliber buffet with Strip prices. The food isn't that good, the selection isn't that good, and the champagne brunch is overpriced, with champagne so terrible that I had to mix it with OJ just to make it drinkable. And trust me - I am no champagne connoisseur.

Save your money and spend part of it on the hot dog, then gamble with the rest of it and try to get yourself a free drink. Trust me.",rKbHJVoreU_p_Hj1JVqHaw,2,1,1,V3-0sgyaXpwL6FYzGSM6UA

The only thing good here is the soda and sometimes the dessert.  A bonus though, they have some fruit (apples and bananas) and they are easy to put in your purse and snack on later.  The food is poor quality, appears to have been re-heated under a heat lamp from the day before, and everything has a similar color to it when it shouldn't.  The vegetables aren't that fresh, the salad bar is limited, and the rest of the hot food is unappealing.  

You could easily go here and fill up on food but you might need to rest for awhile afterward and be close to a bathroom.  It's the kind of full where you regret what you just ate and you are mad at yourself for spending money on food like that.

I knew this wasn't a good buffet. But a friend really wanted to try it. I don't think I ever need to go back.

SERVICE - I'm sorry, but piss-poor. The cashiers are the type of people whom you can tell hate their jobs and hate life. Answering ""I don't know"" to basic questions about hours or champagne offerings, just to be lazy, when clearly, they do know. We waited 5 minutes for the dinner buffet, and asked for champagne. We told the woman that's why we waited 5 minutes. We were charged, got our bracelets, and went inside, only to be told that we had only been charged for the regular buffet. So we had to go back outside, pay more, and wait for a manager to come and re-do the transaction. After the manager charged my friend and her boyfriend, the cashier let her go, forgetting that I had the same problem too. So we had to wait for her again. It seriously took us 20-30 minutes just to get in. And there was no line.

FOOD - It's buffet food, so I'm not sure what new I could say here. It looks like an expansive buffet, but the main buffet counter that runs the length of the restaurant is just a mirror image of the one on the other side. The guacamole was completely frozen. Yes, frozen. It was a large ball where the fresh guac had been scraped away by other diners, leaving the ice. Dumplings and sushi were horrible, but I'm sure you already knew that before reading this review. Some of the food was enjoyable and decent, which is why most people who come to this buffet are probably drunk. The pastas, orange chicken, and desserts weren't bad. 

DRINKS: We paid for the all-you-can-drink champagne, an extra $8. The ""bar"" was a small counter in the front of the restaurant, serving wine and beer. To get champagne, we had to go to the counter and pick up a tiny, nearly shot-sized glass of it. For $8 and for such an inconvenient system, we began either pouring it into our water glasses, or finishing it as we got food so that we could be served more. I bought two bottles of wine for our table for $12 each, which wasn't a bad deal. They must rip people off on the champagne to encourage them to buy bottles of wine. 

Not really any redeeming qualities for this buffet, whatsover. Stick with the Spice Market or the Carnival buffets; you'll save money, have better food, and be happier.",QJW33YrUGp-wVMI8M5mObg,2,0,1,VA25erBQaKtkY6JrOweu8g

Usually when i encounter something this bad i have to immediately yelp the sh*t out of it but fortunately i proceeded to get completely trashed immediately following my last experience here and forgot to write the scathing review that it deserved.   Now that its been over a month or so since i visited the buffet the memory of it's horror has diminished (a bit) but i'll do my best to give it justice.

Ok, so here we are in Vegas, Buffet city right? so we figured we'd give the buffet at our hotel a try (btw, this buffet is at the Excalibur Casino which also sucks for many other reasons i won't go into here...).  When we got to the buffet we were presented with an option of $16 for the one time entry or something like $30 for the all day buffet,  We opted for the $16.

Now me and the wife are relatively small people but we like to try lots of different things, so on our first round we each got about one spoonful (or the smallest possible serving) of about half of the items that they served.  After the first few bites, we gave each other a look, then a few more....   WTF?  we literally could not tell the difference between any of the foods.   I tried her plate, she tried mine, yep, the same thing.  so we pushed the food around on our plate and left it for the waiter hoping it looked like we ate enough and wen't back in search of more, hopefull better offerings.

Round 2:  

Epic fail!   at one point my wife was pushing the plate away from her and grunting ""NO!"" like a 2 year old who doesn't want to eat  her creamed peas...  ""NO!""

Round 3, Deserts.

Seriously, what the F is wrong with these people.  Where the cooks involved in a horrible taste bud destroying accident leaving them utterly incapable of adding flavor? 

I don't get it, we saw all sorts of people around us wolfing this swill down so maybe we're just weird, or maybe people from California are just different than the rest of the nation... i don't know.  All i can say is.  Avoid at all costs.  in fact you'd be better off eating that stinking McRib that everyone always goes ape sh*it about.

On going here for breakfast, the decision really was that it was a choice between buffet and regular breakfast in one of the other restaurants that would cost about the same.  We figured it was just better to take a chance on breakfast.

I'm glad we did.  I don't expect much of any breakfast buffet, and that includes it actually tasting good or having much variety.  I was proven wrong on both counts.

They had the majority of stations open for breakfast in some fashion, so salad was fruits and yogurt and such, the ""carving"" area was doing omelets, Mexican was vaguely such, but had chorizo and some other items I liked, etc.  About the only area that wasn't the same is that the ""Chinese"" area had been taken over for pastries.  As far as quality, you're not going to get fresh eggs benedict at a buffet, but outside of that, most of it was decent, if not actually good.

As a note, though, avoid the bacon.  Normally, I like bacon, and it's one of the few things that holds up well in this format.  This back, though, was terrible.  I'm not sure what brand it was, but I wouldn't feed it to a dog.  It was that bad.

We only came to Roundtable because we were a large group that wanted a cheaper buffet experience.  If I had my way, we'd be at Paris using the $5 off foursquare check in to get $15-$20 lunch buffets. I could have gorged on roast duck.  Instead, I had to settle for a lackluster salad bar, mini corn dogs, and fried chicken.  The fried chicken was probably the best thing present because the spring rolls were nasty mush and the orange pork (not chicken, apparently) consisted of hard chunks of pork meat with some sweet glaze on it. 

Even if you go in expecting poor-quality buffet food, you're wasting your time and money. There's nothing special about drinks (soda fountain), the attempt at non-American cuisine was fail x 999999, and I would never advise anyone to come here for any reason.

My sis loved it.

If only dinner had been as good.  But...I guess that's what you expect when food is sitting under heat lamps all day.  The pork ribs were so tough I couldn't chew them, even after about 5 minutes of trying.  Mashed potatoes & gravy were good, as was some mystery slab of meat and the minestrone soup.  Other than that... meh.  Not so great.

Good desserts, though.  At least, that's what my friends said (I was too stuffed for dessert).",kCWLgrvtLoZeqVpmyLPiew,2,1,2,s9oq_JLe6WgM2B0qKcwG3A

Cashiers: sucked... Couldn't move a line to save their lives.

Waitstaff: great... Another half star, they were nice and friendly. If after reading all of these reviews you're still dumb enough to go to this place, tip your waitstaff. I saw hoards of hillbillies just getting up and leaving all kinds of messes behind without so much as a buck on the table.

Food: absolutely awful... After trying the faux eggs and salt concoction, cardboard Belgian waffle, freshly picked cotton pancake and ""just add cinnamon no one will know this is just a hamburger bun"" French toast I gave up grabbed a bagel that was the size of a half dollar piece and a bowl of oatmeal. Both were good but who is spending $16.22 for a small bowl of oatmeal and a bagel the size of a hockey puck? I had four glasses of milk to feel like I got some value out of the meal. 

If you want a cheap breakfast just go to the crappier restaurant in your hotel (they all have a good one and a crappy one) order eggs, bacon, toast and hash browns. You'll pay the same as I did at this crap bag buffet but at least the food will be edible and you won't spend the rest of the day buying $2.50 bottles of water trying to ease the swelling in your hands and feet because you realized you didn't eat a bunch of garbage at the buffet for breakfast, you really ate several cleverly disguised salt licks.",_xDLHTs9ZqGOtQPYN-NgaQ,0,0,1,1jdM4ZE2zPPspvi-j-BTLQ

the food was decent, like dennys but not as greasy, so know what you are getting for $17, but go with what you know.

-breads were a bit dry
-for lunch they had tortilla chips but no nacho cheese (LAME)
-minestrone soup was flavored like a chili, and thick, but delicious

Save yourself, your taste buds and your money! Worst buffet I have been to EVER! Seriously, no joke! I'm not an expert, but I've been around... and this is by far some of the worst food I have ever paid for, in any state I have ever been to. 

Only thing this buffet is good for is making someone pay to eat here as a result of losing a bet! THAT is seriously a punishment. 

The food is gross. Food options suck. Layout sucks. Kinda reminds me of the time I severed people at a soup kitchen, very cafeteria style, with flavorless slop they call food. JUST DON'T DO IT!",bl_ShhYxra-J1q_Bds3i2A,4,4,1,pgrk8kFnONA8oF4zXqxU_g

My aunt came into town and bought this deal, and took me to this buffet before seeing the awesome Aussie dudes next door. 
Ok. Not the best. Not at all. Not the worst though. They have everything every other buffet does- but they have a huge ass counter, where NO ONE follows the line rule: Start at one damn end! Apparently, that takes too long, and so they start wherever they want- left, right, middle.
Kids. I hate kids. I hate kids who are left to run around a casino buffet, jump under my arm, and watch me plate some pasta. I will not hesitate to tell your unruly brat to get the hell away from me or face a ladle of hot sauce. Seriously. Control the kids.
The dessert? The best think there is some kinda Tiramisu with a shot of coffee at the bottom. The rest of it, not so much. 
The only thing I really, really liked was the drink area- you can get all the drinks you want whenever you want, and you don't have to wait since they have at least 10 of these drink machines in one area! Yay!

You just can't compare  a BMW 7series to 3 series and give the 3 series one star.  Similarly, Excaliber buffet cannot be compared to Cesar buffet.  That said, Excaliber deserves 4 star in its class.  Service is standard just like Home Town buffet.  Ambiance is similar, family type, kids running around...On the other hand, foods are quite good.  Lots of variety.

If you come here hungry your going to leave full BUT:

It's that kind of full that makes you feel sick. Like a taco bell taco eating contest. Or a sandwich from a gas station. Or a large buttered popcorn on an empty stomach. 

I get it I really do. Your drunk and hungry and want to save a few bucks.
 
Whats that the buffet has a 29 dollar special to eat all you want for the whole day?

Really? Dream come true right?

More like a death sentence. I never got the all day meal deal but by the end of the day you would want to pull a scarface at this joint and come out guns blazing. 

All the food is not good. It's bad. Not good. Terrible. Horrible. 

Nothing is fresh, everything is nasty. Even the drinks taste bad. All the food has previously been frozen (since the ice age I assume)
