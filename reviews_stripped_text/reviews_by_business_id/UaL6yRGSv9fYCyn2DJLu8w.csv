This shopping center is coming back with an EOS fitness, antique mall, bar, and a few other spots to eat, but make it a point to grab a sandwich or crepe from La Papaya. Upon first entering, I was genuinely welcomed by a woman behind that counter that said she was there if I had any questions. There was a customer sitting with his grandson that quickly suggested for me to try a chocolate, strawberry and banana crepe and said that he had only found this place two days ago and had been back twice. I now understand why. I chose to grab a turkey sandwich and a Cuban sandwich to go. Both sandwiches were amazing! The Cuban wasn't traditional nevertheless delicious. The flavors used and the bread are what set this spot a part from competeters. I also liked that they automatically gave me jalapenos and extra sauce on the side. I highly suggest!!!",-38arQmrFq4YPqDSlO8R7A,0,0,5,v9AA8OUr8qeA4C2s0rTqUw

Indoor and outdoor seating is available. The restaurant itself is pretty clean. They promote healthy options, which is great considering that they are right next to the gym. 

My friend and I ordered chicken paninis, a salad, and a nutella crepe. We didn't think the portions would be big, but they were and it was a lot of food for the two of us. We did finish it, though. We also ordered agua frescas, which were pretty refreshing. 

The customer service was great. The employees interacted with us and also offered us a sample of one of their smoothies. I am lactose intolerant, so I asked them if there is milk in their smoothie/agua frescas and they assured me that there is not. They blend drinks with water or orange juice. They also have almond milk available, but of course you need to let them know beforehand if you want it. 

Overall, I was impressed. The food was really good and I would go back for a post-workout meal.",l--K3xQWVqs93iFhAoEYag,1,1,5,WQ9M-NkOeyAkebYFTSnWCA

I wanted something healthy after working out and saw this shop. The exterior is clean. When I entered, the interior was spotless. I was greeted with smiles from everyone. They said ""Hello and welcome."" They promptly were ready to take my order although they were clearly busy. I told them it was my first time and wanted to browse the menu. One of the ladies went over the menu with me and told me to just let her know when I was ready. I ordered an agua fresca made with mango and watermelon. Completely refreshing. The employee told me to taste if before I left so if she could see if she needed to adjust the sweetness. Great experience.
Today (Tuesday) I decided to go back again. This time I ordered an avocado omelette and another agua Fresca. It was amazing. Omelette came with this spicy orange sauce that really complemented everything on the omelette. 
They serve: crepes, coffee, omelette, natural juice, smoothies, oatmeal, sandwiches, tortas, salads, soups, paninis, milkshakes, juice shots, and agua Fresca. Amazing menu selection.
