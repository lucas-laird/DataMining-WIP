I've ordered from them many times, usually only getting the same things though, the philly cheesecake and fries with extra fries on the side which is pretty tasty.

I've gotten the baked spaghetti with extra pasta twice now and it is AMAZING for the price. I'm a huge pasta fiend and they make very good pasta. Not the best, but probably the best you'll find at this affordable price.

The delivery service isn't the quickest, but 45-1:10 and it'll be there.

delivery took a long time. the onion rings were soggy rather than crispy. The pancakes cost 7 bucks and they give you 5 mini pan cakes that are very thin. I am not impressed @ all. I mean I could have gotten same or better quality from mcdonalds and paid a lot less..... ....

I got a sandwhich with the pancakes. After eating some of the food I can not recommend this place. The pancakes are small, poorly prepared, overcooked I ate part of one and threw the rest away.... the au jus that came with the sandwich was super super super salty like unbelievable salty.

Left message for supervisor 3 times but never gave me a call. Also was informed no refund the most would be 10% off which I would never use cause I would never trust them again! Plus I'm from another state on the other side so this may be my first and last trip here. So ridiculous. They deserve a ZERO",YQbDucqIe1nguuuTM_qRkQ,0,0,1,Z5miVFnM06553UteqsG2rg

I wasn't notified of that until I asked why the charge was more than my order. Their sign also says they take American Express...they don't. I got a salad, so it's tough to mess that up. It tasted fine, nothing spectacular, but they did a design with the meat and cheese. I guess that gets them one of the stars.",9arRbIW_eH0kUiMTenyPeQ,0,0,2,JskXsDgBAcCKGOTpvVGK2Q
5315311,2017-03-08,0,ERZua_xpyvHBnChITstpFg,"Delivery: 45 minutes late, no call. 
Food: Cold, poor quality. 

Bacon cheeseburger : bland, bacon undercooked. A dollar extra for 6 small onion rings, also cold. It came with a pickle wrapped in a plastic bag that somehow managed to be warmer than the burger and onion rings. Impressive. 

Cheese quesadilla: Lukewarm, tiny, lacking in cheese. 

Garlic knots: doughy bread lumps covered in oil. Distinct lack of garlic or seasoning of any kind. 

Can of soda: Kind of warm, but still the best thing I got from this place. 

Seriously, don't bother with this place.",ws8IZY4rPFeneTcrZvTRNw,1,1,1,MT54m-XcljahAHfUqm_AOg
5329758,2017-12-20,0,ERZua_xpyvHBnChITstpFg,"So ordered using Eat24. Ordered a pizza, a sandwich and fries and garlic cheese bread. They forgot the pizza!!!!! So I call them the cashier was super friendly and apologized. Said she would have a fresh pizza made and redelivered. 50 minutes (based on the time I called them) the pizza showed up and it was ice cold! Probably the  same pizza they didn't deliver the first time and left in the drivers car or something.  So it's now 1030 and the meal we ordered at 830 is officially ruined. So disappointed this place used to be soooo good. *update*** can't even get my money back because the manager has to approve it and there isn't one there until tomorrow.  Eat24 said they will follow up but that also means I have to follow up. So not only did we not get to eat our complete meal we also get to waste even more time making sure we get our money back. If this how this place is choosing to do business probably won't ever give them another try.",Ido0RL0wDtbZB2eToWE4hg,0,0,1,nYp5_CpHtx8rGq3LnUb9gw

Not only did we order over 50 dollars worth , when our food came it was burnt, cold and no condiments. Called the restaurant and spoke to a manager , manager said she would send drive back out , waited an hour for SAUCES , after waiting an hour for food , when I finally call to see why its taking so long for the driver to get here; Rachel the manager on duty claims driver knocked and no one answered  but I was sitting right by my door , just like previously when the food finally came , when I asked why didn't the driver call ; Rachel the manager on duty said he called me at the store and said you didn't answer , umm excuse me ?!?? Then when asked for a refund atleast on my Burnt food , I was told no , there is nothing we can do ,Rachel acted like she didnt even care or it wasn't a big deal that we haven't eaten yet and my sandwich was burnt and I just spent over 50 dollars and had no condiments to go with our food ! Beware , menu might look great , but horrible service ! Never ordering from them again !",Z8B6DKgnsEnXG5zS2BBlzQ,0,0,1,1KtgsySd7qTwkivLmhV-Bg

So i called to tell them...and the guy on the phone argued with me? Telling I specifically put together that burger. Fine I am about to take a pic of this burger and post it all over social media!",a8fntE39x12hU_qAP5ku1Q,0,0,1,Sxc1jRo-eoOPatY0Sb0KyA
