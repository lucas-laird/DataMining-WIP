164588,2015-01-23,1,hPCheDmQDna-2iiJ4c553w,"Arrived at 8pm. Empty. Completely empty. But boy, was this place clean & put together. Cleanest, tidiest Subway I've EVER been in.

I looked around to see if anyone was there & wondered first if they were open, then if anyone was even in the shop because it was so quiet. My last thought was if a robbery was in progress & if I should get while the getting was good!!  At which point someone came out from the back. 

OMG!  The prep area was clean!! All the containers were properly filled, nice & neat. Not a crumb or lost lettuce shaving to be seen.  Chips were displayed upright & properly stocked. Not a crinkled bag in sight. 

I'm not sure what was going on noise wise (there was none) behind the counter but I was constantly repeating myself as was the Subway person. Maybe its the design of the counter?  I dunno really, just something I've noticed at every Subway I've been to: no one seems to be able to hear each other. 

I still can't believe how clean it was!!

I asked for a toasted Chicken Bacon ranch sammie with provolone. Having a fried pickle craving, I also asked for ""lots of pickles.""  Got 'em!  My sammie quickly came to life before my eyes & it looked amazing. I was so hungry I couldn't wait to get home & devour this culinary masterpiece. 

ALL the tables were wiped down!!

Unfortunately, even toasted, my sammie was cold. Specifically, the chicken. Honestly I didn't notice if Chef Mike warmed the chicken prior to it going on the bread or not, but its the only reason I can think as to why my sammie was cold. 

The drinks station was immaculate. Not a single stray straw wrapper. Anywhere!  The bit where the soda comes out WAS CLEAN!  good thing I went for the tea. 

Because of the Chef Mike oversight I gave a 4-star because this by far is the cleanest restaurant (fast food or not) I've ever seen.",9BuTUHt6Zlm-UCjaGD6aJQ,1,2,4,SZ2yMxSIp6Lg-gQ1YEta9Q

Waited patiently for 10 minutes and no employee was to be found.   Asked the people sitting there if they seen someone, they said not for a while.   15 minutes no employee.   The food looked far from fresh.  Left this dump",Jt9NqGyuZkBsDp3sjYFe4g,0,0,1,A-Df2vTlJJr84_JZlq-kbg

It's subway! We all know what subway tastes like. The one star isn't for the food. This location is actually really clean and open late. It's for the two ladies that made our sandwiches.

One lady was making my BLT while the other lady was making my BF's sandwich. They kept talking to each other the whole time while making our food so they weren't paying attention. I had to wait until they were done talking to say what else I wanted on my sandwich. And when I said a little bit of mayo, she wasn't paying attention and ended up putting a thousand calories worth of it. The other lady making my BF's sandwich was just as bad. My BF had to say tomatoes and onions 3 times because they kept chatting!!! PAY ATTENTION HOLY FUUUUKKKKK!!! And to make it worse, they were talking about us in Spanish while we were paying. I freaking understand you!!!!!!!! 

Omg I'm livid!!!!!!!!!! Never again at this location!!!",BI4jBJVto2tEQ0NiaR0rNQ,7,3,1,LUqNzHMI5_jucDGDEyBLnQ
2831870,2016-03-25,0,hPCheDmQDna-2iiJ4c553w,"They are ALWAYS out of broccoli cheese soup. I used to think it was because I came in late, but even if I go in the afternoon they still say they don't have any made. Usually the works are kids who don't really want to be there, I honestly think they're just too lazy to make it. Very frustrating. Why have it on your menu if you never make it / offer it? I live right by this Subway, but I drive all the way down to the one on Windmill ( by Shaku Ramen ) because their staff is so much friendlier and they always have the soup on hand.",2wUWne7QCJCK9xJBMoX5ig,0,0,2,KwoH9pMfXQc9MDn96lciDA

3778688,2012-06-13,1,hPCheDmQDna-2iiJ4c553w,Couldn't believe that my favorite Subway wasn't on Yelp! This location has been open for over 2 years now. Oh well it is on here now let the check ins begin. It used to be better because it was connected to Josie's frozen yogurt but they closed up shop. anyways cool thing about this subway is they have some regular seating but also have 1 table that has two leather chairs. very comfortable and a nice change from the norm of most subway's.,BRkfT1_6dVouyUVfN4R-Pw,1,1,4,VRVVptOgOo9or2MVyftaTQ
4383051,2015-03-08,0,hPCheDmQDna-2iiJ4c553w,This is your standard subway. It is always clean and well stocked. The best part is the location. It is easily accessible from Silverado Ranch. I eat here almost daily. Take advantage of the iPhone app or the gift card discount. You can save money.,9auFKOnjngvpgL4h3iwO4Q,0,0,4,W09VRKLFpM-3oAhUcXNGCw

The employees are friendly and they always get it right but then again I always order the usual which is the Veggie Delite with everything. Bread is always fresh except for on one occasion when I think I got day old bread, but that was a while ago.",dOFyIGbyfB69VB4pnoKqQA,2,1,3,THsV0ViLNjz-uNOgC8ROZA

I got the Turkey, Bacon & Guacamole wrap. They put all my favorite toppings on and they even grilled it in the panini press when I asked!  

The ladies here are very friendly too.  I definitely prefer this subway over the one on sil verado and maryland",Yy0CAv2eIy-X1BDbtzXykQ,1,1,5,cyXCgqvDdIM0FYeS8MnVSA
