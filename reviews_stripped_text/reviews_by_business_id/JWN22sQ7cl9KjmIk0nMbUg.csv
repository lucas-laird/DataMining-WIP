I order no potatoes in my double potato burrito - they give me potatoes. I get the double cantina CHICKEN quesadilla - they give me steak.

I ordered a grilled chicken taco supreme, but when I opened it, it was a soggy tortilla doused in red sauce, some cheese, lettuce, a few diced tomatoes, and sour cream on the edge.  No chicken.

The reason I continue to go here is because it's the closest thing to my house and when I'm just getting off work at 11:00-midnight I don't feel like going out of my way to eat somewhere farther away, this is a quick and cheap meal for me. But when I specifically say what I want and make sure it's correct on the ordering screen, the people in the back shouldn't mess it up. Especially because I'm basically a regular by now. And tonight I ordered simply some nachos and cheese...and didn't get any cheese with it. Just a couple chips.",XMV1L5NNButqMCxmWCFOkg,0,0,2,IU-dD2an_S-l1PHKEP5oXA

Never gotten and order wrong just a little cheap with the sauce. No complaints other than the 3 sauce packets for my family meal of 5.

I've been to other taco bells and they do it with out a problem. It may be messy but that's how I want it. They didn't do it the 1st or 2nd time. What pisses me off is it is money i am spending so If I ask for 5 pumps of red sauce that is what I want. For me to waste my money on this food and my gas to come back and still didn't fix it right.

I discovered that my tacos did not have taco shells. Called the store no answer no return call also they closed shortly after I left. Emailed my experience to Taco Bell. They ignored my calls and emails. This place is garbage. Even more so then the food they serve.  The manager needs to be fired.
I have gone here a few times where they did not have food properly in stock. The time before this incident they literally were out of hot sauce.

- Smiling employees

Simple order for the family everything totaling  just over $22.00 I really should have left but.. I didn't receive my order until 8:35 PM dead serious. I mentioned something to the manager she told me they were just short handed. And walked away. Absolutely the worst Taco Bell I have ever been to. Rude customer service Dirty nasty lobby trash cans full no napkins drink area was nasty floor looked like it has not been moped in days.

I don't know if Taco Bell made a large area update to their steak or chicken, but since steak used to be my favorite meat for many items and it tastes strange at this taco bell (can't speak for others since I only really go to this one, as it's closest), I've kind of lost my taste of it.

I still like seasoned beef a great deal, though.",CVwtKiHDYZwIG1_SiUiWxQ,0,0,4,j2nSOayXm9sINdsxqvofpA

Got out of my car, asked the cars behind me to back up so I could get the fuck outta there.  This is not the first time I have had problems at this location.  Trust me...

Other nights they have the whole place looking like it's closed and multiple nights where they have said that their system is down and the whole crew is out chilling and smoking. I am done with this place! Don't even bother people. Buy a salad instead cuz this staff doesn't make it worth even having a cheat meal.
