801458,2017-06-06,0,WgvJcTe_RdlIfnvxEzn2Mg,"I'm honestly forced to give this place one star because it deserves none! The service was terrible and the food was a joke. We ordered a carne asada quesadilla, an order of carne asada nachos and one carnitas burrito. 

Okay, let me start by saying that the asada on the nachos was cold and the meat did NOT look fresh! By the time the nachos made it to our table, not only was the meat cold, but the nachos were soggy. My son's favorite item on the menu is their carne asada quesadilla. He took 3 bites before complaining that there was a piece that was too "" chewy"" to swallow. He ended up spitting it out and refusing to eat. He walked out with a stomach ache. Now, for the burrito -which I was most disgusted by- tasted very gamy, and not in a good way. 

Finally, you know how I mentioned their burrito was what disgusted me most? We'll, I take it back! What could be worse? Their customer service! I'll admit that it's partly my fault for disregarding the red flags, because there were many. For starters being asked to calculate my own total balance seems absurd. Yes, you heard right. I gave him my order twice and while taking it, he was giving me this look as if I was stupid. He gave me my balance and forgot to add my drinks. Then as he was adding my drinks I decided to add the burrito. He looked at me and said, ""okay just get your phone an add $1.70 for drinks and $5.65 for the burrito, that's your balance."" 

The experience was terrible! They were rude and stared the whole time we were there! Singing loudly and intentionally trying to make us feel uncomfortable. What a night!",r4jyh4ljboN-TKMcS2YrOw,0,0,1,6IngcJF3Iika3YtcQqTu5A

I get my order, walk out to my car and check for the sides of sour cream which were not in the bag. I go back inside with my burritos and receipt and ask the cooks for my 2 sides of sour cream, they dish it up, and up walks the cashier girl who laughed at me. I tell her the sour cream wasn't in the bag and she tells me ""they're inside the burritos"" and I respond ""well I asked for them on the side""... but she ignores me and walks away. I stand at the register for another minute and the cooks blatantly ignore my presence, and don't give me the side containers of sour cream even though they got them ready for me. When I got home and ate my burrito I was even more disappointed. I paid $4.40 for the sour cream and there's nothing inside... nothing but grease. I ate the entire thing out of pure starvation with a big surprise at the end... still no sour cream.

The food isn't overly seasoned, and to be honest theres nothing to special about them. But I guess that's what makes them so good. It's easy and the food is exactly what it says.

4701557,2014-04-12,1,WgvJcTe_RdlIfnvxEzn2Mg,"I've been to this location a couple times, but I don't normally seek out Roberto's since I rarely visit Mexican fast food joints and if I do, I prefer Faustos. My recent visit was based on convenience and I thought I'd give it a whirl again to compare. 

I have been on an Al Pastor kick for the last couple months, so I immediately began searching for my favorite pork. Since I couldn't find it on the menu, I saw ""marinated pork"" and asked to verify. When I asked the cashier if they offered Al Pastor, she responded, ""Yes"" and directed me to the Adobada. So, I ordered an Adobada burrito for myself and Adobada Nachos to share with my friend.

As it turns out, Al Pastor and Adobada are NOT the same thing. Al Pastor is pork marinated in dried chiles, spices and pineapple, then roasted on the vertical spit. Adobada is generally pork marinated in a ""red"" chilli sauce with vinegar and oregano. Adobada can refer to any type of marinated pork, so people can technically claim it is the same as Al Pastor, however, the vinegar in Adoba sauce and preparation of Al Pastor makes a big difference in flavor. 

Who knows if Faustos serves real Al Pastor when it could just be Adobada (the possible absence of the vertical spit)? Either way, Roberto's Adobada does taste different from other Al Pastor I've had in town. I concluded it was not different in a bad way, but rather just good in its own way. The flavor was great! I really enjoyed it with the nachos (I think I may prefer their nachos to Faustos, slightly). The burrito was good as well, but I was surprised that it was accompanied by just pico de gallo and guacamole. However, I don't order burritos often, so this may well be the norm. Their tortilla was yummy and I loved the crust they put on it from the flattop. 

My verdict is that Roberto's is good in its own way in comparison to Faustos. I like Al Pastor slightly more than Adobada, so that may be the deciding factor of where I choose to go. Oh, I did enjoy the salsa bar here much better because of the additional fresh vegetable choices!",TdYKJgSgY2GF_YJnwsi5yQ,3,2,4,FfaiyIqB1dterRubcOAlGA

4795759,2016-12-28,0,WgvJcTe_RdlIfnvxEzn2Mg,I normally would get the carne asada fries and add salsa verde and limes to it. Today I go the adabada fries as something different. They are not listed on the menu so you'll have to remember them in order to get them. They are hands down the best fries I've had in a very long time. The meat is so flavorful and really does go well with the other toppings you get. For less than $10 you can get literally two meals worth of enjoyment! I will definitely try these again.,1PvDk9-siiBuDSt73Jgi-Q,1,0,4,xyKSRyuSPUlYNqapso-5iw

Of course when I got my food it was topped with globs of salsa . The salsa tasted horrible too. I scraped it off and of course the eggs underneath were over cooked . Didn't even bother to let them know cause she already looked like she was in a bad mood . I'll stick to my rule . Never eat Mexican food out of my house .
