They also make fresh cupcakes and granola. 
Last time we had Bellagio and Encore sandwich - delish!!  I hv uploaded pics for them so you can see how yummy they are!",n_TY6rd1wXZBczBaOaK6Rw,2,1,5,ylRfcIGLWyXiZLWvUzVIow

1535558,2012-02-23,1,pIC8VOa9pPvq6JI02DKPlg,"I really like SBC, mostly for the atmosphere. They have a quaint little couch area with a coffee table and some low tables as well as some board games, so I can go there and play some Scrabble over lunch... Service is friendly and it's very relaxing just to hang out there. I usually don't really care for sandwich places since sandwiches are so easy to make, and even though this is a ""cafe"" I really consider it a sandwich place, but their sandwiches are really good, really varied, and not too huge to finish over lunch. 

They do have one sandwich there, can't remember what it's called, which has roasted red peppers in it... it tastes soooo gooood, but it's way too oily to eat. I think the oil is from the red peppers. That sandwich would be so good without all the oil! Also I have ordered their iced green tea latte before, and it is not very good. It doesn't have a strong ""green tea"" flavor so it's more like iced, sweet, whipped cream-flavored drink.",6sqRgMuw379kw4bIz44sPA,3,3,4,K5VBxiM6brNJv--2I1-M1Q

There are high top tables with computers to use and a living room area with couches and a coffee table.

2834173,2013-06-05,0,pIC8VOa9pPvq6JI02DKPlg,"This place was great!!!...In the beginning!!! The atmosphere is nice the food tastes good but the service has went down the shitter. First of all if you dont like people using groupons in your establishment then dont be on groupon. When you have a groupon the serving sizes get miraculously smaller and quality and service gets even worse. They used to have this tatted up girl working the grill and the register and she was awesome. She had a great personality and I didnt mind paying the over priced amounts for the food on top of tipping her well. Now the last 4 times I have been in there she has not been. I think it is the owner that I see working all the time and an older lady. Both are rude and have no personality especially when using a groupon. On top of the horrible people that work there, the wait time is astronomically high. Just today we waited 40 minutes for two to-go salads only to come home and find out there was maybe an ounce of chicken in them and that they did not include dressing. They have also moved from using quality plates to using paper which is trashy. And on their menu with your sandwich they used to have a choice of chips or pasta salad, now the chips are crossed out so I would guess the only option is pasta salad. But our sandwich came out with about 6 full sized chips on the plate. I have given this place numerous chances and I have wished them the best but they are failing!!!! My first review of this place was great. I told all my friends to come here and was a bit of a regular. But now I am steering everybody in other directions. You want a quick lunch, dont eat here. You want good customer service, dont eat here. You want good prices for your food, dont eat here. On the other hand if you want to eat on paper plates, only be allotted 1 napkin, wait forever, get very little food and pay up the wazoo for the whole experience, by all means eat here!!",HQYq_ZvS3aoTHMjxsk8y-A,1,0,1,pJm9nGfZtJT9jAIVsw1icg
3182534,2011-05-06,0,pIC8VOa9pPvq6JI02DKPlg,"I'm not a fan of this place.  Keep in mind I am a telecommuter, and my perspective is that of somebody who comes to a cafe primarily to work while enjoying some tasty beverages, and maybe some food.

I haven't eaten here yet so I can't comment on the food.  The coffee is passable...I've only tried iced blended drinks as it happens I've only been here on hot days.  I drank the whole thing so it wasn't bad or anything, just kind of meh.

The real problem is the atmosphere.  The first time I came in the music was really lame easy listening music.  I asked if they could change it, and they said no.  The second time I came in, it was generic southwest spanish station music.  This is kind of sad because they are paying for Sirius and have basically infinite options.

Lastly, the comfortable couches are set in front of a big screen TV, which is just weird for a coffee shop.  Last time I came, an employee (maybe the owner?), sat in front of the TV and watched first sitcoms, then soaps, both at a very loud volume.  I found it pretty distracting and annoying.

Maybe other people like this atmosphere, but I can watch TV at home.  Whether I'm at a cafe for social reasons or work reasons, I find the TV really distracting and obnoxious.

The wifi is free, which is nice.  There is no pressure to order something every hour to keep the internet going (unlike Madhouse Cafe).  But I'd much rather spend my money and my time at Baguette Cafe.  It's just more telecommuter-friendly, in my opinion.",iZNj_CBjXQtYMJNQqqwEZQ,7,0,2,suzpEeI6IEzvm6XkSCz3cw
3361986,2013-06-20,1,pIC8VOa9pPvq6JI02DKPlg,"I've been frequenting this cafe for over 3 years and now that it has changed hands to a great family, it has gotten even better. Almost everything is now organic and super healthy - and extremely tasty. They have a lot of options and will custom make a meal for you. I usually order ahead and my delicious lunch is ready for pick up within 15 minutes.

Keep in mind that they are usually pretty busy with delivery orders and catering, so it can be deceptively quiet in the cafe. There are lots of places to sit and things are nicely spread out so you are not on top of other people. (Thatswhatshesaid.)

The salads are delicious, made with organic ingredients, hearty, and customizable. The Cosmo is my favorite sammich and now that they have gluten-free wraps, I order it that way so as not to upset my gluten-sensitive intestines. Yum.

Oh and the peanut butter cup smoothie is killer. Order it ""green"" and they will add some spinach. You won't taste the spinach at all but you get all the nutrition. Kind of like your mum hiding vegetables in your meatballs.

By the way, if you catch them on enchilada day (Friday), ORDER IT.",WylywSEkQqmNGYRQayihgA,3,1,5,kK7gogfSIO8MUEOxGldY_g
3438914,2013-02-22,1,pIC8VOa9pPvq6JI02DKPlg,"i got a groupon for two sandwiches here. The setup of the cafe is nice and i liked all of the healthy choices they had. i ordered the wynn sandwich and a pina colada smoothie and my bf got the bellagio. 

there were 3 employees working but we were still left waiting for like 25 minutes for 2 sandwiches. they werent busy, but i noticed that it was because the setup of their food station was very inefficient. The poor guy making the sandwiches was running back and forth to find all the necessary ingredients. 

Overall, i like the menu, atmosphere and the fact that it is not busy and packed like some of the other cafes. The food was actually pretty good; the bellagio sandwich had a delicious pesto dressing, and the side of pasta was yummy. The only downside is the lack of efficiency.",nTaKM5c-KeTPrKlq75w0jQ,3,1,3,wJCuaZp9pooFqc_mjOcW7g
3519468,2011-06-11,3,pIC8VOa9pPvq6JI02DKPlg,"I stopped by about two or three months ago and I've been meaning to come back to try something else. But, every time I go out for lunch I always end up going somewhere else. What does that tell you? Well, it tells me there are many more enticing options. This place was ok, just not good enough to make me come back.

The place is nice, comfortable, and spacious with modern furniture and a mix of seating options -- couches, tables, pub-height tables. It seems like it would be a cool place to hang out, but I unfortunately don't have enough free time to just hang out at a coffee shop/sandwich shop.

So the sammie I got was called the Mandalay Bay ($7). It's their version of Capriotti's Bobbie... Thanksgiving on a bun. Well, their version wasn't as good as the Bobbie. It was smaller and they used sliced turkey instead of pulled roasted turkey. The stuffing and cranberry sauce were good, though. The bread was decent, but a little on the crunchy side. As a side I got some excellent pasta salad, which had bits of sausage, salami, and tomatoes in it.

The staff was all nice and friendly. The atmosphere was comfortable. But, ultimately, their food didn't impress me enough to get me to come back.

When I came to eat, the place was generally empty except for one woman who was sitting at a table and eating. That person ended up being one of the workers.

Anyways, I ordered a cafe latte and a sandwich. The latte was one of the best I've ever had, and I'd rather come here than any Starbucks or Coffee Bean. Definitely worth stopping in and trying it out.",gakhurT9xcjCdPCBY541Gg,0,0,4,-DMZ7v2bXq7D27U7hdwhXQ
3953295,2012-01-16,0,pIC8VOa9pPvq6JI02DKPlg,love their little wifi zone with few laptops provides the customer to wait the order and go online free! ... Love the carmel macciato more than any other coffee places. Its very interesting menu with the all the casinos name on it.

4920778,2013-05-14,0,pIC8VOa9pPvq6JI02DKPlg,"Came with my mother for a quick brunch and because I had a Groupon to burn~ I really like the look and feel of the place.. Clean, comfortable and cool. They have a couple tables, couches, laptops & free Wi-Fi. The service was excellent! Very friendly employees. 

However, I am giving them 2 stars because the food just wasn't that great and it took 20 minutes to get to our table even though we were the only ones waiting for food :X We got the pick 3 egg scramble $8.95, summer salad with chicken $11.95 and a caramel macchiato ~ The food tasted like something I could make at home and the portions were pretty small.. The prices they have listed don't match what they are serving at all... The drink was tasty though! 

I would recommend coming here for a meeting or to study while grabbing something to drink but as for the food, unfortunately, I'll pass..",_ir8NHMtV7KPTwmBmlkmQw,2,0,2,TwL4awU3Ms9lr-tGzkam5A
5366936,2013-05-20,0,pIC8VOa9pPvq6JI02DKPlg,"Disappointing. I really wanted to like this place but sadly did not. When we walked in my daughter tripped on the floor because it was raised so much. Huge hazard! After waiting more then five minutes with no one else in the restaurant I ordered a Bellagio and asked for tomato and avocado to be added. The chick said we don't have avocado. No 'sorry we are out of avocado' or any kind of friendly remark. I sat down with my family and waited for our food. 

As I sat I looked at the layout and decor of the place. The seating is awkward at best. There are two large tables with four chairs around them. Some couches and higher chairs. Apparently they don't have kitchen storage so they have a make-shift storage closet in the corner of the dining room. Everything would have suggested that this place just opened a few months ago. I asked when I checked out how long they had been there and the girl told me five years! I personally think it is unappetizing when you can see into the whole kitchen. There were plates being stored about 6 inches from the ground under the stove. 

Our food came out and I was again disappointed. They use the cheapest paper plates to serve their sandwiches and don't even double up the plates. I would have thought after seeing all of the real plates under the stove that they use real plates but no. 

As I said earlier I ordered tomato on my sandwich that didn't come with tomato. Well there was no tomato. The bread was good. The chicken on the sandwich was too big and basically flavorless. The flavors were fine but was missing something. My husband's sandwich was on a very small croissant. It was flavorless chicken salad. Again the chicken was too big. 

Unimpressed! Will not be back!",GSTf4SKV1HjZBfWFapea0Q,2,0,1,fb4aD-ZzMkSYyrwPjYL8aw
5735317,2012-07-04,1,pIC8VOa9pPvq6JI02DKPlg,"The owner and staff are sweet. This place doesn't seem highly trafficked like many coffee joints in Summerlin and I love that. The seating is very comfortable whether you choose to sit on a couch and watch TV or at one of the bistro style tables.

The wifi is free and faaaaaast. They even have a few computers should you just wander in and want to check email.

Oh yeah, the coffee is OK. The lunch sandwiches are good and the bagels are toasted on the griddle which few places still do. I love that. 

I dig this joint. Stay away so I have a place around here not overrun by suburban moms. :)",R_uxlSD2MMkNwA8ers0DhQ,3,1,4,hhmHYWNACUMvNjsUnbq_Qg
