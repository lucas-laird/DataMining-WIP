I have gone to this location several times, and last night Wednesday July 13 was not a good experience.  Whoever the young African American girl was working that night is absolutely horrible!  Not one bit friendly, she seems like she hates her job, and makes you feel like you are inconveniencing her.  Here is some advice, if you don't like your job, then find a new one...preferably one where YOU never have to deal with customers seeing how you are not a people person.  I will never go back to that location again. I would rather drive to one 20 min out of my way where I can receive good service.",NDj2_T4NYmesryWt62KXng,3,0,1,dl_lx0eLdSh7vjEuJwCenQ

I went there for the first time a couple weeks ago and I am bummed it took me this long to go! The produce was fresh and the meat was too. The management was SO NICE. I went in w my 3 small kids and had forgotten my wallet in the car. I didn't realize it until they were half way through making my food. I kept apologizing and they were so kind about it. They finished making our food and then pushed it aside so I could run out to grab my wallet. When I came back in the line was long but the manager didn't bat an eye when I came in.

Since moving to LV I have never really been satisfied with sandwich shop options because they didn't match up to my CA favorite. I do believe I can say Port of Subs comes pretty damn close.

Their prices are very reasonable. The food is fresh and consistent and they slice the meat to order.

This location has a great staff. They are busy at lunch because of the offices around the neighborhood. You can expect to wait from noon till about 1:30, however the line moves quick. I appreciate that they have everyone manning a station and everyone knows their responsibilities so there isn't a delay. 

My favorite is #8 - Turkey and Provolone or #18 - Turkey, Roast Beef and Provolone. 

You can order online also. If you have a big order, place it online :)

I ordered catering for my daughter's birthday party. We have ordered from them before with little issue. This last experience had totally changed that for us now. 

I called on Thursday and placed an order for Saturday. The poor experience began on the phone and I should've known better at that point. I ordered 2 sandwich trays and after he (finally) seemed to understand what I was trying to order, he seemed in a hurry to get me off the phone with a quick, ""Ok! See you then!"" No repeat of my order or asking me if I wanted to add to it, which I did. 

I told him I needed a veggie tray and a fruit bowl. I asked him to please repeat my order to ensure the I had not missed anything. All seemed ok. 

Saturday rolls around. My dad went to pick the food up. We received a call at 1:15 asking where we were. I told them on the phone when I placed the order that we would be there after 12:30 that day. My dad was on the way and I told them that. 

He gets there and finds 2 sandwich trays and a fruit bowl. No veggie tray. He called me and the rude gentleman ""manager"" gets on the phone stating I ""never ordered a veggie tray."" I told him yes, I did. I continued to remind him of me stating I needed to add a veggie tray and fruit bowl. Back and forth- he is calling me a liar & continues to repeat that I must've forgotten to order it. I said no, I didn't; it seems that you must've forgotten to write it down. Still, no apology from him for the mistake. How hard is it to say, ""I'm sorry ma'am""? 

Anyhow, I will never return here for any reason and have already contacted their corporate office. The grapes in the fruit bowl were moldy, as well. Just lovely. If I could give a negative 5-star rating instead of a 1-star, I would. After this experience, I feel they don't even deserve one star.",vtuJC7Tu7cBfK9CxXOyM5Q,2,1,1,QFokBiiFfYnMzmU2jNekUA

One thing I do love is that you can order online and they will have it ready when you get there. This is a great way to avoid high school drama. They are pretty good about making sure the orders are correct.

One thing they should really watch is the bread. It is the vessel for the entire meal. When the bread is stale it ruins the meal. They are also a little chinsy with the toppings. This is supposed to be a sub sandwich, bursting with fresh veggies and meat. I hate when you have to ask for more lettuce and they look like they will kill you.

The food is good. Always fresh, lettuce is always crispy unlike some locations. The staff is knowledgable and in over 3 years have never messed my order up. They also have one of those mix machines where u can customize your drink so that's a favorite. 
The cons are really something that they don't control but have to be addressed. The area it's at is filled with several business offices. This means early in the morning and at lunchtime it gets super busy and the wait to get your sandwich is ridiculous. It also is a giant pain in the a** to park. There's also times on the weekend when there's summerlin events goin on and seating is hard to get to. 

Quick roundup: if you go at most times, you'll have a 5 star experience, but at peak periods it drops down to a 3 star",KyMkKb5IohKb0S7v4Jv-oA,1,2,4,lKTxP7MQ0oliyafKONn_vg
