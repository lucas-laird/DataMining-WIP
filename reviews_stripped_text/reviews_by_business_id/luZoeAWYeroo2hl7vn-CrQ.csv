It was not new either. Toilet paper and seat covers all over the floor. Dirty toilets and sink.,KzBcUpKchjaq2WtfafGv5A,1,0,3,hf9h3LZIpHliDJrSZ3whOw

Ended up throwing it out.  TERRIBLE!  Never going back!  Drive through and it took about 15 minutes with only one other car in line ahead of us!",qBB900KT6Zeyt2mvwjV6yQ,0,0,1,AAlcUpSDVm5Er6sjfbPumA
1287398,2014-12-11,0,luZoeAWYeroo2hl7vn-CrQ,"I would recommend that you ignore some of the older reviews as this location has definitely improved over time. I used to constantly have errors with my orders; missing sauces, no straw, wrong side, etc. But I started going here again recently and boy have the cleaned up their act. Their employees are very nice and respectful. Over the few recent times I've been there my orders have been 100% correct.

I'd honestly recommend to stay away from the chicken since I've heard many negative remarks about their chicken. Their burgers are great, I'd recommend the Big Carl or whatever the special is.

Oh and try to find coupons, they are a bit pricey... but you do get a lot of food for what you pay.",QGxqWdgZLPzdzu30DhhDog,0,0,5,bHrVI2s5ZpZu2Jjz-uhXqg
1978445,2017-08-11,2,luZoeAWYeroo2hl7vn-CrQ,"the ""manager"" Exxie was rude and argumentative, they were understaffed slow to process orders and recognize customers coming in. One of the kitchen personnel dropped the bag with the barbeque sauce in it on the floor, she proceeded to pick it up and cut it open and emptied into the container with the bag touching the surface where food is being prepped. I expressed I no longer wanted my order which pissed off Exxie who did not care to know why nor care to get me my refund until after she helped another guess after she had made me wait after I had told another worker to inform her which was done within my ear shot.",PM-y-cZBJmt-knyE6Td_yg,1,0,1,iRQzV8GdD3dDi5Ek6Yb55w

We ordered our meal at 4:44pm and the lady taking our order forgot to give us our cups for our drinks, and proceeded to take the order of the kids standing in line behind us. There was no one else in line. We continued to stand there while she took their order and then walked away....we waited until 4:54pm trying to get someone's attention before the young man taking care of the drive thru window finally walked over to see what we needed... RUDE!! VERY! If someone is standing there obviously trying to get your attention you don't ignore them and walk away...if I hadn't already paid I would have walked out...but I can say I will not be coming back to this location.",AarqdZeQ29AtxzCfEC5UoA,0,0,1,HjPZlF7GtqZQWE8AI5cIqA
3825651,2011-02-28,12,luZoeAWYeroo2hl7vn-CrQ,"I knew better than to stop by here, but I was hungry and I no longer resist the temptation to try some of those ""fresh made"" Breaded Chicken Tenders.  I ordered a 3 Piece Chicken Tender, Bean Burrito, and Western Bacon Cheeseburger.  

It took a while for the food to come out....I guess they really do make them by hand.  The first item I had was the Western Bacon Cheeseburger.....once upon a time, this was my favorite Burger.  Now, it's just awful.  The Bacon doesn't even taste like Bacon.....it's that paper-thin, pre-cooked, microwave Bacon, blech!  And the Onion Rings inside the Burger were very poor quality....I took one bite and the entire Onion came out of the Ring because it was so tough.

Next up was the Bean Burrito....it was just ok.  I'd rather have a Bean Burrito from Taco Bell or Del Taco.  Don't know why I ordered it.

Last up was the Hand Breaded Chicken Tenders.....I saved them for last because if they were fresh, they'd be piping hot and I don't want to burn my mouth.  I bit into the first piece and yuck!!!  It was rubbery.....just awful.  I didn't finish the rest of them.....what a waste of time, money, and calories. Damn.

They get 2 Stars instead of 1 Star because the employees were very nice and friendly and the place was clean.  You can have your Happy Star!

She was extremely rude, shouting through the speaker in the drive through and nearly throwing our food at us, shutting the window before I could ask her for a thing of ranch. I never write reviews about anything or any place but as a person working in the food service industry, you need to at least pretend to be cordial.

4087238,2016-08-18,2,luZoeAWYeroo2hl7vn-CrQ,"First off, my experience is from a drive through perspective only - of which I do often at this location.  Usually it's me and James of Carl's Junior in the morning communicating through the drive through speaker.  James is always professional and nice and I'm always nice back.  I always order a burger as I'm not a big eater of egg items for breakfast. 

I almost always have a good experience but now am a little afraid to go back.  I got a ""weird"" burger that I waited forever for this morning and I hope that something wasn't misunderstood between my pal James and I. As far as I know, all correspondence was polite and normal between both parties. The burger I got was smashed beyond an accident and wrapped in that way tight.  I was a little taken back bit the thought hit me right when I took the photo and I wondered of anything else was wrong with it.  So, I paid $7 bucks for a burger and drink in didn't feel comfy finishing.  I am going to be sad without my James and burgers in the morning. I can't imagine why the burger was jacked up like that and ruined.  I just don't feel comfy trying again at this point because I'm obviously the morning burger person....",McDGTZ5J4ViG46PNrkPOfA,1,0,3,iOrW43awDgZwTDjdjO1lWg

4660772,2017-12-21,0,luZoeAWYeroo2hl7vn-CrQ,I went through the drive through today and order my meal with only mayonnaise. I get to the window to pay for my meal and over year the cashier say to the cook Only mayonnaise. He says well I already put ketchup and mustard! I had a feeling as if they were talking about my order since I was the only one there and no one was at the counter. I pay and get handed my food and drive to the front and open my burger and sure enough my burger has ketchup and mustard! No mind you my hands were already on this burger! I unload the kids walk into the store and tell them my burger was wrong and got an apology never mind the fact that the one whom serviced me already knew the burger was wrong and clearly didn't care enough to fix the problem! So the different cashier that takes the burger I already touched and puts it back on the line now I don't work in fast food anymore but I know it's common sense to throw food away that has been touched but apparently they missed the memo! So within not even 2 minutes I'm handed another burger with cheese that's not even melted. I think this location needs better employees and better health standards. Last time I had touched French fries that were supposed to be onion rings and they put those back as well. I thought that was a one time mistake but NOPE,AXEUk3Be2ch9nzQACvpdqw,0,0,1,-tK78f7xEjvcWgXbmETmbA

5612193,2018-06-18,0,luZoeAWYeroo2hl7vn-CrQ,"Drive thru experience is never good here. Every single time I go drive thru, they are either rude or they don't get my order correctly.

Last night, me and my boyfriend and his brother went drive thru and we get home to find out they missed out a part of our order, my boyfriend had to drive back just to get it and the guy knew what he was there for. My boyfriend wanted something for the mix up and all we could get was a cookie. We drove all the way back for the rest of our order and they can't at least be nice and have given us something better for messing up. 

Also, I remember a while back I had an experience in drive thru with a lady, and she got the whole order wrong. I wanted to get to know her name and she didn't bother telling me. My boyfriend had to go inside to fix the order and she was arguing with him and calling him a liar. 
Keep in mind, this was the manager! She said she didn't care because it was her last day. Also, another customer had the same problem with her so she sided with my boyfriend. Good thing she's no longer working there! 

My experience when dining inside is somewhat better. I just wish they could be like that in drive thru!! 

Last night made me and my boyfriend realized we aren't coming back, at least not to this location.

5968678,2015-03-01,1,luZoeAWYeroo2hl7vn-CrQ,"Normally I wouldn't review a fast food chain but the service today warranted it. I went in the girl behind the counter asked what I wanted. Told her I'll need a minute. She told me to take my time. Checked back in with me a minute later. Said I was torn between two items. She asked which ones. Clarified what I wanted and made a suggestion. Went with the natural burger as she suggested. She then Offered me a cup for water while I waited. The burger was really good!  Her service was awesome! Didn't get a  receipt with a survey so had to praise her here. Not often do you get even decent service at fast food- maybe it's changed and I didn't notice since its rare I eat it, but it was refreshing to have great service


Service was still awesome but it's still a fast food place and the hubs says it's not deserving of a five rating",c5oYE9tK0Rb0lSUREw1lxQ,1,1,3,bJ9t95WrXVYW8Gp45dHTuQ
