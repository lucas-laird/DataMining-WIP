We walked in and waited to be seated, we didn't wait very long. We were seated, this is where things got a littler irritating for us.  We sat and waited, waited and waited some more for about 10 mins. I remember seeing at least 4 different servers helping tables.  They weren't incredibly busy. However not one person acknowledged us or asked for drink orders.  Not even a polite smile.   We finally had enough,  got up and walked out.  Stopped and asked for a comment card and abruptly told the lady at the ice cream counter about our experience and she went to get the manager. The manager came over we told her....  She asked us if we wanted an order to go, we Sao not really we were hungry and really just wanted to sit down she offered us to take out booth back and said someone would be with us immediately.   They were and probably te ONLY smiling face we saw in there.   We got out drinks and ordered our food all at once (remember we already had 10 minutes to figure out what we wanted)   Food comes and it was hot, and good.  Thanks goodness.   We finished out meal and and asked for the check.   I don't expect a full comp or 1/2 off but a small discount would have been acceptable.

1398915,2013-09-06,0,H8umkLwMkM0vP5B8oPiozQ,"A basic Casino coffee shop with a hit and miss menu. You are best off here getting breakfast or for a post midnight snack, when they will be a few specials. 

My standard order here is two eggs, hash browns, toast and some meat - either the ham steak or bacon depending on what I'm in the mood for. It seems strange to say this, but they have really good toast here and lots of options like sourdough, rye, wheat, etc.. It's sturdy bread and fresh, too. The hash browns have a tendency to come out undercooked, so ask for them to be cooked a little longer to ensure crispness. 

They have an okay burger here. Nothing to write home about, but good. Their fries are also good.

Service is friendly and thanks to a person who is charged with getting your drink order ASAP, it feels quick. If I'm in a hurry I'll sit at the very spacious counter, which has four or five TVs and enough elbow room to read a newspaper. I've not encountered a long line, but I am sure there are times when one exists. 

Aside from average food, my only other criticism would be the prices which do seem steep. The aforementioned breakfast with coffee will run you $8 unless you are eating in the wee hours of the morning and taking advantage of a special. 

My advice - don't go out of your way to come here, but if you are at the Silverton and need some food, it's a perfectly adequate option.",RTtdsBlyFcpeKI8MMD-A3Q,3,1,3,DjlYsg66t7mccSRdFTaIaQ

I am a TURKEY CLUB junkie! Before trying anything else on any menu I HAVE to try the turkey club first. So that, my Yelp friends, is what I had. First know, the last time I had one of these sandwiches was when I dined at FARM. Now know this, Sundance Grill's TC was SO much better. Is it just me who thinks the bacon is always overly crispy for these sandwiches? This one, the bacon was cooked beautifully...friggin' delicious actually. 

Dessert...I'm usually, and by usually I mean ALWAYS, too full for it. But today I purposely packed half my meal to go so I could enjoy a sweet treat....I did earn it after all, went up in weights this morning at the gym woot woot! $3.00 for a strawberry tall cake with vanilla bean ice cream...YES! It was very satisfying and if I'm being honest (I always am) it tasted VERY similar to strawberry short cake, only a little more fancy because of the ice cream. My only regret was I shared it with my fiancé, he didn't even order a dessert I should have let him watch me enjoy it by myself. It was outstanding for 3 bucks. 

You know what, I always order turkey clubs but I never bother to look at the price. Is $9.50 an expensive club?...I kind of felt like it was.

Oh and, I had no idea you are suppose to take your check to the register at the exit. We sat there for about 10-15 minutes before we figured it out. Would have been nice if our server had mentioned it when he gave us the check haha.",UEKG996TTiwonMpXwH-ixQ,2,2,4,9XUwOgJsxhSn1Xdq0gNOXw

The food is good and reasonably priced.

The staff are courteous and friendly.

What's great, is the more you play, the more you'll get free food, free play and rooms.

The ambiance is relaxing too.

Most of our steaks were burnt and tasted microwaved. The fried shrimp was the only good part about it. The pasta looked and tasted like it was left out for a while, one that you'd microwave from 99cent store.

I will not order a sandwich on white or sourdough & I get so upset when I would love what's in between & cant change the bread so yay! & YUM!

They deal with people all day long that under tip or don't tip AT ALL!  They just assume if you have a dining comp with you you're not a fair tipper.  WELL!  I've always been fair with 18% OR BETTER and the people that have waited on our table know this.  I've seen so many faces in this cafe it's not even funny.  I like a place that has decent food and at one point I thought this place was OKAY!  I've checked in here numerous times. Met some unreal, prude like managers that swear there's nothing wrong with the food. But yet you tell me would you eat that undercooked? They'll just be upset & scowl at you.   Other times I've had pleasant experiences with staff & managers. Sadly the bad out weigh the good for us.  To the point where my boyfriend refuses to go here because he can't stand the wait or a particularly rude manager that used to work during the week (his days off).

I've complained about that particular manager in the past & sure enough she remembered us the next time. You'd think she would be pleasant and force a smile or get a different attitude than the apathetic look on her face.  If you hate where you work get a better education or don't get in the food industry.

My main reason for giving this poor rating is for the food quality which has plummeted over the past 2 years.  Somebody came up with a great allergen free dish called the Sweet & spicy Chicken wrap. It came with rice noodles on top, some wiz bang Sauce (guessing Asian fusion), chicken and it was probably something I would see off of Master Chef. You understand it looked beautiful on a plate.  OF COURSE it was not popular enough to stay on the menu because being America if it's healthy it's not for US! I was big contributor to this closed mindset UNTIL I found I can't enjoy certain foods anymore. Has they kept this dish on the menu I would probably still come around & put up with the miserable staff.  I miss coming in and being recognized by certain staff but I don't see them when I do have the nerve to stop in. It's a shame. I like being a regular and getting treated like a friend, you serve up the food I leave a nice tip we exchange ""have a nice day/weekend"". Call it a win. But I haven't had that experience here in a long time here.

 I wish Jon Taffer would fix this place so it's reasonably priced, with a hospitable & friendly staff that stick around.  I hate seeing a place with different staff every time I visit. It tells me a lot how the staff get treated.  But I don't blame them for leaving when some of the managers aren't the pleasant of people to talk with.

If they decide to send me a mailer saying they've revamped the place than sure I'd go back a few times to see how it is. I'm going to miss this casino because it's more my speed, I grew up in the sticks & loved the lodge theme but eh.  I won't stick around just for that.  Bring back the Sweet & spicy Chicken wraps if you DO revamp the place.

I know most society prefers it ""crispy"", and the menu even lists their bacon as such, but I asked for it slightly under crispy.  I prefer it a little underdone.   My server said she totally agreed with me on bacon style and would request it my preference.  It came out crispy.  Oh well.

I got their Reuben sandwich. It was really good. It's more than enough for one person. It's also inexpensive. I recommend it.

---------------------------------------------------

We ordered food to go. This place has a variety so if you're looking for pizza, it's here. If you're looking for sandwich, it's here. I do like their choices.

We got the chicken BBQ pizza. I thought it was really good. It came as a thin crust. It had the right amount of BBQ sauce. It wasn't drenched in it that it was all you can taste. I would recommend it. The pizza was like $13

Also got the fish and chips. It was good size for something that was $12. The breading was good. The oil they used to deep fry it tasted like it was old oil. Nevertheless, it had the right amount of crunch to it. I thought it was okay. The fries were fries. Nothing special to that.

I would recommend the place. The people were really nice. The ambience is pretty cool. I love the decor of the place. It's a really nice sit down place. You can sit at the bar and check out the behind the scenes. Just a cool venue. I would take a date here.",9k2et25tG8kSj9Q3hqj9xA,0,0,4,nlwtPTO_B9Mttlnc7gp_lA

The waitresses and waiters have the personalities of a brick wall. I've had better revive at a gas station. 
My wife had the New York steak and veggies. Her steak was about a half inch thick but she said it was ok. I ordered fish and chips. Both our meals came with a salad and a role. I love salad dressing or anything that hides the taste of anything that looks like a vegetable but my salad was swimming in dressing. There were floating croutons and a life raft that looked like a cucumber. The roll was good.
My fish and chips were among the worst I have ever had. I have had better fish and chips in an elementary school. The fries tasted like they had been sitting around for a few hours and the pieces of fish were dripping with grease. The coleslaw was brown and looked bed. I wasn't even willing to try the coleslaw. The fish was over cooked so the meat was tough and dry and the batter was a dark brown that tasted like the grease was weeks old.
When I told the waiter that my meal was so bad, he chewed me out and told me I should have told him sooner. He did offer me something else but I declined. He said he has replaced meals ""many times."" This should be a problem in his eyes. He did take the meal off our bill but did charge us for the salad. Amazing that they would nickel and dime a patron who had a bad experience. My whole meal should have been removed from the bill. When this restaurant first opened, many years ago, there were long wait times but the food and service was great. THIS IS NO LONGER THE CASE.

Most recently I came with my fiancee around 5:30 AM, unfortunately too late for the cheap late night menu, but the food is still a good price regardless.  Even with nobody else waiting to be seated it took a minute or two before someone noticed that they should seat us.  There were at least 2 servers around and only 3 other tables when we were seated and it took quite a bit of time to get drinks, have them take our order, etc.

My fiancee got eggs (awful) and sausage (great) while I got a burger and fries.  I asked for and double checked that my burger would be plain, but when I got it, it was clear that the cook had put on everything and then scraped it off so he wouldn't have to make it over again.  By ""clear"" I mean there was still some lettuce on the plate and burger.  I asked to have it remade and the server told them and strangely enough I got it back 1 minute later -- yes, they had literally just scraped the remaining lettuce off and served me the same burger.  I again asked to have it actually remade and finally they did.  Amongst all this I ended up getting old lukewarm unsalted fries (99% of the time their fries are to die for, but I guess they decided to fuck with me because they messed up and I wouldn't let them take a short cut out of making the order properly).  Additionally when they were preparing the order the first time they started the eggs and burger at the same time, so my fiancee's plate was sitting in the window for 10 minutes getting cold while mine was finished.  

It ended up that I got my correct burger 5+ minutes after my fiancee was finished eating.

Normally I would just give a place 1 star for service this bad, but because of actually having good experiences here before I'll give it 2.  If you want some tips: try to eat at the counter as the service there is usually pretty good.  Pastas, burgers, breakfast, and sandwiches are all pretty good.  I'd suggest staying away from the pizza.",ykWNHp1RXcmx6PYH921UrQ,0,0,2,FTYmo00ICmXXXSOIOK2Rgg

Quesadilla is a great starter, came with pico de gallo, salsa and sour cream. Everything was fresh. 

Garlic shrimp pasta was tasty (but oily). Shrimp could've been fresher but was still good.

Pizza was AMAZING as always. They have a fire brick pizza oven thing which they cook their pizzas in.

 It's a clean, nice looking place (but it shouldn't get points just for that), there are some TVs up above the counter seating area.

The waiter was friendly, service was fairly fast -- I got my food about 13 minutes after ordering.

 I had a hamburger that came with fries.  I had to pay to add a slice of cheese, and I also ordered a side of cole slaw.    Just water to drink.

My bill was a little over $15!   Sorry Sundance, but you're not a trendy, touristy place nor are you on the expensive Las Vegas Strip.    You're open 24/7, which is cool, but I shouldn't pay a premium prize to subsidize your 24/7 operation.

5361318,2011-08-11,0,H8umkLwMkM0vP5B8oPiozQ,"**Summary**
       - Meat - I've tried 3 of their meats and the rib eye was the only thing that I'd order again. It's also a really great value for what you're getting.
       - Meal vs. Entree - With the exception of the Surf n' Turf, the other entrees let you get a drink, dessert, and soup or salad for $5 bucks more.
**Ordered**
       - $14.99 Surf n' Turf - Ordered medium rare. Steak was soft but super dry. The deal does come with a drink, dessert (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/H8umkLwMkM0vP5B8oPiozQ?select=EcrK2N5SP4f_EQkRh2I-Pg), and a soup or salad, so it wasn't a bad deal (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/H8umkLwMkM0vP5B8oPiozQ?select=ZTtJfOIzkl3Yx2lgYxGCOw).
       - $15.95 Rancher's 16oz. Rib Eye - This has been the only meat I've ordered from this place that hasn't been dry. The seasoning is really good and the meat is tender. A great value for $16 (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/H8umkLwMkM0vP5B8oPiozQ?select=XVnwdtHVFBux7aWlTbgesw).
       - $15.95 15oz. King Cut Roast Prime Rib of Beef - Ordered medium rare. The prime rib was nice and thick but super dry and a huge let down.
**Recommendations**
       - I'd recommend this place for their rib eye. It's delicious, big, and juicy. The other steaks/prime ribs I've tried have been trash.",37S80IUIfb8yMsSwWWDsFA,1,1,3,_Xp9aoDuOXld7UDNCr9bKQ

5758162,2017-04-10,0,H8umkLwMkM0vP5B8oPiozQ,I have never had such a rude and inattentive waitress as I did here on Friday April 7th. As I was giving my order to Stephanie she interrupted me and said she knew exactly what I wanted. My order was simple the unfortunate part is I wanted to add something to it and never had the opportunity. We had to flag down other severs to help refill out beverages. Overall our meal was just ok..hence the 2star rating.  I would recommend that Stephanie have a customer service e training with her manager on how to properly take her patrons order and stop by to check in and see how our meal is and refill the simple water & soda beverages.,FWYP0xjo_0cb_uxbE62MbQ,1,0,2,i3gBsj337pJTP0eiIDlxOQ

Inexpensive, nice setting, not the greatest, but no bad either.  Good place to grab a bite if you're on your way out of Las Vegas and don't want to head to far off the I-15 nor head back to the main strip.

Have been there for their breakfast which is pretty good except that their Bellinis aren't quite what I am used to.  But can't beat the price.",btUugfufQAe-QD6gC_Ckmw,1,0,3,Zvx4a-3gOjDSqSRATxmBWw

I ordered the giant ham steak and it was definitely giant sized, but wasn't out of this world good. Eggs were cooked perfectly over medium, hash browns and toast finished off this breakfast platter for $12. 

Service was excellent, as I sat at the counter so I could watch the 5 TV's showing Sunday football. No issues here, quick and efficient with frequent offers to warm up my coffee.

The food and service were average. The first meal I had was a pepperoni pizza. It was nothing special. One cool thing was it was a huge serving. The second meal I had was this weird  burger wrap. The thing that sold me on it was it came with a chipotle sauce, but when I tasted the wrap, you could barely taste it. All you could taste is the bland ground beef. The third meal I had was a Caesar Salad Wrap and that was surprisingly good. The dressing was perfect.

I would only recommend this place if there is a deal going on or if you are staying at this hotel. It is super convenient and is opened 24-7.",xA_upwVTOVtXkS0NGISGng,0,0,3,XEPZnVKf9C33CbhlI6QelA

Service we got there was slow.  Took about 2 hours to get in and out from putting our names down to getting sandwiches and omelets during a weekday. It was pretty much the only full restaurant open in the place for lunch when they have like 5 of them.

5869649,2013-07-11,1,H8umkLwMkM0vP5B8oPiozQ,"Ive been to Sundance Grill many times. I've had many many things off there menu- there are some highs- and a decent amount of lows.

firstly, there high- there salad is good, not enough options- would be nice if you were able to add chicken,steak, or shrimp to a salad for a fee.

there sandwiches are bleck at best breads usually hard, and the french fries are by far the worse ive ever had. i know french fries arent supposed to be amazing but i mean, c'mon.... mcdonalds fries shouldnt be better than yours.....

graveyard, the pizzas usually come out raw- and i mean raw.......

the upsides..... there strawberry dessert is good (strawberry shortcake) 
there steak is alright.....

there chicken bowl is alright...... sauce is too sweet and the crunchy noodles are nasty. 

not enough selection of gelato flavors

also a few times ive had issues such as raw pizzas (4-5x) hard rice (burnt) rotted baked potatoes..... 

it would really be nice if they improved there sandwiches, changed there fries, and added more salad options (and made an add salad option to the sandwiches)

but pleaseeeeee!!!! change the fries (o and the chips as the replacement are gross!!!",7jrhS2KtnpBfewdn1mNFzw,2,1,2,j1BYS57BGHu6PQAi3fC__Q
5893201,2017-12-02,1,H8umkLwMkM0vP5B8oPiozQ,"Much nicer than you may expect, and much bigger too! It's a cozy atmosphere in the dining room, and the bar has seating too. The few times I've eaten here recently have been mixed experiences.  It's been busy when we've eaten here, and we sat at the bar during our latest visit. The salmon entree I had was yummy, especially after I finally got sauce with it! The sides are good sized, and the salad was very good. Rolls are served with entrees, and they were nice and fresh. 

I've had the reuben here too, which was pretty good. The wait to get it was way too long, however. The kitchen seemed overwhelmed, and it showed. The menu pretty much covers it all, from salads to steak, pasta and seafood entrees. 

The gelato ""bar"" at the restaurant's entrance is nice and isn't crazy expensive. The decor is in keeping with the Silverton's outdoorsy theme, and could even be called a bit classy. It's a step above the typical cafe style, and one reason why I recommend giving it a try.",Kp5KHBSmV-Htc9NeSjJfPA,4,1,3,rbp36eFmynw2LFICjg0s8A

The service was so terrible! Lisa was her name. She cared more about clearing 3 tables before taking our order. I felt that was her being greedy! She wanted more customers than to help the ones she already had. After 20 minutes she finally came to take our order. After 15 more minutes the food came out. Mine was cold, in fact the plate was warmer than my food. The butter wouldn't melt over my French Toast. My husbands toast was barely toasted, his hash browns were cold, my daughters bagel was half toasted, my sons French Toast wasn't cooked. 

When Lisa came back for my cold food she ripped the plate from the table, she was rude, showed zero care, didn't apologize, a manager never came to the table and I still payed for a half cooked meal. 

But I can tell you that the bus boy, aka the soda man, was AMAZING!! He was quick with service, polite, sincere and apologetic regarding the server... Lisa! 

Our family and I have agreed that we will NOT be visiting the cafe anymore. A few bad experiences was enough! In fact same on us for giving you guys another chance. Bye-Bye Sundance Cafe!",6I6DIjwiFEXfseDwToI4bA,2,0,1,bWLFEemPmLO-iiWCpggXng

I had their prefixed menu and the prime rib was good and big.  The meat was juicy and shrimp was good but it had this green sauce on it that kind of threw us off but wasn't bad.  The strawberry shortcake was delicious and served with ice cream.  The server who served us was sick and had mentioned it but I found it a little disturbing as he is serving food. Not to mention I am pregnant. We had to wait awhile for our refills which he forgot half of the table.  He was nice though.  I would definitely come back for the shortcake.",Znid_azpcHmdRMHGicmkWA,1,0,3,5VUnr9JsNtohb1El40dlRQ
