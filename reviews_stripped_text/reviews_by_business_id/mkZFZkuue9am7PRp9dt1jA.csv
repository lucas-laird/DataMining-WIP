My boyfriend and I order 2 corns and my son a single scoop of ice cream and we asked for a Duro loco to go. As soon as we got home and sat on the table to enjoy our duro loco , my boyfriend noticed something tasted weird so he said to take it back and asked for another one without the cabbage. So I took it right back , like I mentioned before I only live 5 minutes away. I walked in and this rude ass lady noticed I went back so I kindly asked her if she could give me a new one without cabbage because the cabbage tasted bad , she opened it and sarcastically said ""omg you almost ate it all"" so I looked at her like BITCH I just left and you made it for me TF! anyways she said ""well what do you want"" I clearly told her just to make a new one without the cabbage. She grabbed the one she made and took it to the kitchen and as she was walking to the kitchen she said ""next time before you finish it all just bring it back right away"" customer service first lady , you could've simply avoid an argument with the customer and made the new one without the sarcasm. And we did not eat half of it we had barely tasted. Obviously not going backto this location again I rather drive a little more down to charleston to get a better service and better quality (:",1FZ6jinODOv6WVjMXC824A,0,0,1,j_2h3Sm3IWue9tDkX7cXAw
237024,2015-06-19,0,mkZFZkuue9am7PRp9dt1jA,"I like the ""antojitos"" (cravings) selections at this place, they make my favorite, regardless that is not on the menu. I like to get a chicharron with corn, cheese, spices and mayo. Something they also make at the La original flor de Michoacan. 

The good thing about this place is that the waiting line is much smaller. A few selections of agua fresca and ice cream flavors, but downside is they don't have a name for any on display so you will just have to ask about every single thing. They offer indoor sitting for about 10 people, a good thing in Las Vegas. 

Finally, and my only complaint; they have some what of a rewards card, you spend $10 dollars and eventually receive a free ""antojito"". I really do mean exactly ten dollars, last time my fianc√© and myself spend $9.90 and the lady refused to reward our points, when clearly we always spend over $15 in the both of us. We no longer use the reward card, and shop here simply because is close to home and it works it's purpose at satisfying cravings. Just found it rude as I work as a manager with a company that rewards clients, that's not really the way to go. Overall this place is good.",V_iQE0KAECUmrxMtjnrvAA,1,1,2,0-2MS2m2fTr-iCkqzk_7Kg

They also have a variety of ice cream to choose from. Today I tried chamango. It consisted of mango ice cream, mango pieces, chamoy and some Tajin. It also came with a straw that was covered in Mexican candy. This Mexican treat was delicious. I just wish it was a tad bit cheaper. I paid $6.50. I feel like it was worth 5 dollars at most. That's my only complaint. Other than that this place was pretty cool. It's cute inside. Bright colors. Menu is easy to read and the lady that helped was very nice and described a lot of the items to me because I had asked questions on almost all their Mexican treats. I'd probably come back again and try something different.",g5czf__WW0nQO_PUMHTFEA,0,2,4,xzYeW-DXUYVAl-79mvcR1A

4740286,2017-03-19,0,mkZFZkuue9am7PRp9dt1jA,The ice cream is over priced for the quality. I was hoping they made their own ice cream but I found out they use a variety of different brands. The staff wasn't very welcoming and they actually helped someone else who arrived after me and then didn't ask if I needed help. The agua frescas are descent but there aren't many flavors. I don't think I'll be back.,ROSwDQCwDZjxWfTDyIuZPA,1,0,1,007zxdTxDOmIdf1ukGQqZw
