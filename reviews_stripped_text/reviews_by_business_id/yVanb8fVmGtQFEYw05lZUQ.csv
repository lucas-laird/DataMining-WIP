327948,2012-03-29,0,yVanb8fVmGtQFEYw05lZUQ,"I am from New Mexico so I have ridiculously low standards for Mexican food out of the state but even I was a little disappointed after reading the reviews of how great the food was. I had a bean and cheese burrito and the first thing I pulled out of it was a huge hunk of meat which was pretty gross. I'm guessing the refried beans were made with ham hocks from the presence of meat and the fact it tasted like it had been soaked in meat juice- it was easily the worst I've ever had. It didn't taste like a bean and cheese burrito, it tasted like meat flavored bean paste.  Also the cheese wasn't melted.  Perhaps I ate there on an off day. The chips were okay but I've easily had better bagged chips from the grocery store.  The salsa was alright, a little too much for red chili taste for my liking, but it wasn't the worst I've had.  Salsa tends to be quite variable if it isn't bottled and I think that was the case with this salsa. I wouldn't eat there again, but everyone I was with seemed to enjoy their food so maybe I am just picky.",bvnzbuI9WBY30cYm-Rno5w,0,0,1,AQOEuZ-oU5JEkdeGXYRBPg

(i don't actually care about the chips and salsa confusion, that shit was delicious and the more chips the merrier. i'm just bored and felt like boring you with my chips and salsa thoughts) also, i dug the flat screens playing a dvd of people making chile rellenos. made me want one.",zouz2tXuSkWhzQ8hp2OV_A,0,0,3,Jfln3UrXkHkDCi6EYolPPw

FInally, gave it a chance when I saw they have a 4 Taco and a Drink special for $7 on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Granted its a little pricey but very well worth it. Its very clean inside and the menu pops right in front of you. Big bold yellow board lol. They have the typical menu you see in most places like Roberto's, Fausto's.....etc. They have the radish, carrots and salsa right by the register which makes it nice after you order. Decided on the Taco Special, 4 tacos and a drink and a side of refried beans. You get to choose your meat. Had one order with Carne Asada and another order with Chicken. They topped the tacos with Onion, Cilantro and salsa. Very liberal on the Cilantro onion. Which is a good thing. They were fast and wrapped my to go order. I got home and we ate. Awesome flavor and no fat on the meat. The onions and cilantro popped like flavor crystals in your mouth. The salsa was pretty good. Not spicy as I would of liked, but decent. This is the way street tacos should of looked and tasted unlike Tacos El Gordo. That place was garbage and I'll never go there again lol. The beans were very good. Not over salty and had a great homemade taste to them. Almost like my moms. I hope the beans stay consistent because I plan to order those again and hope this wasn't a fluke lol.

The carne Asada is very bland and dry. Don't waisted money on chips and salsa as they give you a cup and send you to the free salsa bar and your entree already comes with chips.

2077498,2017-02-03,1,yVanb8fVmGtQFEYw05lZUQ,"Pepe's is really similar to other Mexican fast food joints in town, but they have a few differences that must be mentioned. First, the guacamole here is bomb.com. It's made in-house and you can taste the freshness. I've not found real guacamole at a fast food restaurant yet. Usually its just some green slop, so the real thing is definitely appreciated. Second, they have liquid nacho cheese. The fries and nachos come with the liquid cheese and tacos and burritos come with shredded. Oddly enough, this isn't mentioned on the menu. My boyfriend prefers shredded cheese on his nachos and was surprised to see it was liquid. If you don't know, now you know.

For 2 super nachos, (one asada, one al pastor), and a cheeseburger, our total was $23. A lot of times you can get a really good burger at a Mexican spot, but I didn't really care for the one here. The patties were super thin and flavorless. I also wasn't fond of the asada meat because it's like shredded. ! I think? This is more of a textural issue than anything and it was definitely not what I was expecting. The pastor was decent, a tad spicier than I am used to, but would order that over the asada again. I'll come back when I'm in the area if I'm craving Mexican food, but I won't go out of my way to eat here.",JYcCYNWs8Ul6ewG5kCYW4Q,3,2,3,kQElnN8ZZ61xjZxmCXLzFA

My boyfriend prefers to get a carne asada super burrito while I tend to try either tacos or different burritos. Their lengua & carnitas are good, but I found lots of sharp bones in my birria, which ruined the experience for me. Their super burritos come with lettuce, tomato, sour cream, rice and beans plus the meat of your choice for 4.75, about the average. Their burritos are large and filling, making either a hearty meal or two lighter ones. Their chile relleno burrito is a little more, but  fairly tasty.
Be warned: their nachos are crap. You can get much tastier nachos a mile or so down the street at either the Roberto's at Russel or the one in the Sinclair station by Indios. 
Refills are not free but I always get my food to go so that's not an issue for me. I don't know how stringent they are about it, but they have signs warning against sharing drinks.

Once inside, the friendly staff does a good job keeping the place clean, and the salsa bar stocked.  They also always have a large portion of spicy carrots and chopped radishes.  The red salsa has a nice heat with great flavor.  I would take it intravenously if I could.  And here's something else unique about Pepe's:  Free refills on Horchata and fruit drinks (holy crap!).  That right there is one of the best values in town.

The tacos themselves are glorious.  I almost always get the chicken tacos with the 3 taco special which is served with beans and a smattering of chips.  The carne asada is also *very* good, though the el pastor is just kind of ""meh"".  What I love most about this place is the consistency; the tacos are always delicious, always hot, and always made exactly the same.  This is in contrast to some other locations *cough* Rainbow and Flamingo *cough* where the product ranges from palatable to ""Dear god, did one of the cooks find an old horse dead in the street on the way in to work?"".  I would seriously eat here 4-5 times per week if my cardiologist hadn't threatened me with an anesthesia free heart procedure if I didn't cut back.  This is one of my ""go-to"" places in Las Vegas for friends and visitors alike.

Some find the location (Boulder Highway and Flamingo) to be questionable, but just think of it as dinner and a show.  On the plus side, this location seems to attract a surprisingly attractive group of prostitutes, so bring the kids and play a rousing game of ""Spot the Hooker"".

2509090,2011-03-29,2,yVanb8fVmGtQFEYw05lZUQ,"There's California Taco Shops and everyone else. It's just fact of the matter. If it wasn't for my wonderful, amazing, absolutely fantabulous wife I would have never thought twice to stop at Pepe's. Prior to going in I thought this had the chance to be one of the all time worst Mexican food joints I've ever tried. Holy guacamole was I wrong! This is the only taco shop in Vegas comparable to my SoCal roots. 

The first positive sign when I walked in was that this place had a juke box full of Spanish music - and it was blasting! There's nothing worse than walking into a quiet taco shop or one that's playing heavy metal (yes, that has happened). The next positive sign was that a majority of the patrons were of latin decent.  Another good sign was that the walls were all neon colors. White walls at a taco shop? No bueno. The last positive sign was that everyone who was finished eating had absolutely demolished their plates. Spotless, all were members of the clean plate club. Nuff said, I was a fan.

Now bean and cheese burrito's are the staple of my taco shop experience. If they pass this test they are guaranteed to have a repeat customer for life. If they fail, they never get another chance, they do not pass Go, and they certainly do not collect any additional money for me. Pepe's passes the bean burrito challenge with flying colors and oodles of cheese. They have the best bean and cheese burrito in Vegas. I've even ventured out to their quesadilla and tacos. Absolutely awesome as well. Their tacos aren't that Taco Bell/Del Taco nonsense either. Small and on corn tortillas, the meat is chopped fresh, ingredients are all fresh. They also have a really good salsa bar.

2519251,2011-03-03,3,yVanb8fVmGtQFEYw05lZUQ,"THIS PLACE IS CALLED PEPE'S TACOS!!!!!!!!
(There's a big hint as to what you should be ordering right there in the name...and it's not Pepe.)

Ordering a burrito at a taco stand is the same as ordering a steak at a seafood restaurant...This is not a Mexican RESTAURANT...it is a glorified taco stand and you should treat it as such. I have never ordered anything other than the breakfast plates or tacos here, nor will I ever! 

Some of you remind me of the girl I stood behind at IN-N-OUT who was asking them to make her a chicken sandwich.

I have not eaten at all of the taco places in town but of those I have tried Pepe's is the best. They have the most choices of meat for your tacos, the shells are always nice and soft but never fall apart like the stale ones I have run into other places. AND they always ask you if you want the extras (onions, cilantro, and salsa) on the taco. So if you think there is too much of these things on the taco just don't get it and add them all yourself from the salsa bar.

The lengua here is the best. I like mine finely chopped because it is a rubbery texture, and most places leave it in large cubes, the carnitas here are nice and moist, whereas when I've had it at Roberto's it is always dry and is not nearly chopped or shredded enough.

The star of the menu for me and for those of you who appreciate it, is the best cabeza tacos I've had in Vegas. It is perfectly oily and greasy and tasty just like head meat should be. 
 
Go on Tuesday or Thursday for the taco plate special: $6.95 for 4 tacos and a drink...and get at least 1 cabeza (if not all 4)",2DECrukmumziXTBI20idTA,2,1,5,lT_5Axu5tuzFmbL__qdUcg

Because of this unhealthy obsession, I found myself cruising to the eastside of Vegas for the first time in ages (oh is this what Boulder Highway looks like?!?!).  Pepe's Tacos has won a number of the Review-Journal's ""best of"" awards over the years and I decided I need to see what the fuss was about. 

Well to quote my homie Bill Shakespeare ""It was much adoo about nothing.""  Much how I still continually wonder how Cuba Gooding Jr. has an Oscar Award, I must question what Vegas-ites were thinking when voting for Pepe's.  To be fair, Pepe's is fine.  In fact, the tacos I had were pretty tasty and the other food I'm sure is good too.  Prices were reasonable and the place is open 24 hours.  The salsa bar is also above average.  The best however?  That's a stretch as I think Roberto's is still a notch above and I'm sure there is even better out there.  Pepe's does offer some unique meat choices like cabeza and birria that one can't find at Roberto's and their taco special Tuesday thru Thursday is a great value (4 tacos and a soft drink for $6.95).

The food is good. Not great, but good. They have El Pastor, so I usually get that. On the last visit here, I ran to get gas while my burrito sat in the car. By the time I got home, it was cold.

I love it so much that I come at least once a week for lunch! I either order your basic tacos (yum) or the gordita. 

The gordita, carne asada with everything is a huge meal. I am so stuffed when i finish it, but it is so worth it! 

The staff is very friendly and it is everything you would expect from a taco shop. It reminds me of my days in Mexico and eating street tacos :o)

They should start a taco/ gordita punch card, after 10 get one free!!!",4Yj3uQBzdP8SFxxAkOnxgw,1,1,5,GBRCJI6snJarfPaO-fYE7g

I'd order those again. definitely. the chips and salsa were so gross.. my bf and I ALWAYS finish the basket.. NOT this time. we left the whole basket there. stale ass chips w/ watered down salsa. Yet I will say this place is always busy.  The 2nd time I went I was hung over and craving menudo. I got it to go and they packed it nicely with red pepper flakes, oregeno and it was good but not great. extremely oily, more than most menudos i've had lately. I wouldnt order it again.

Anyway, Pepe's is okay in my book.  It definitely fulfills my late-night Mexican food cravings more than, oh, say, NASTY Roberto's Tacos does (see inflammatory review).  I usually get pastor for my meat choice.  It's a little chewy but pretty flavorful.  I'm not so keen on the beans, but whatever.  It's a pile of beans.  It is what it is.

I haven't ever come away from Pepe's feeling like I had the meal of my life, but I also don't feel like I've had scary mystery meat either.  It's decent.  The rat is cute.  Trust me, his little bobblehead is engaging in some pretty powerful hypnosis...if you stare too long, I bet you'll end up at Pepe's too!",3rsZCoTmr8EM7DwtGm_RsQ,0,0,3,77H6CooDwNghRRGBhTT9Vw

The Nachos: they make it right, no fancy melted shredded cheese, they use the melted, runny oh soo good glowing orange cheese sauce. 
The Tacos: Carne Asada is done right, good flavor and nice texture, they chopped it up in small bits so they are easy to eat.

Went here with a friend for the first time last night. It was just okay. I ordered the enchilada dinner with the side of rice and beans. They put way too much lettuce in the meal and not enough seasoning. The food just doesn't taste like authentic Mexican food. Prices are too high for the small servings they give you.

I took the whole thing down in around 7 minutes. I asked for my mean cooked well, so it came out crispy just how I like it. The cook back there must literally be from Mexico because only they can make it taste like your actually south of the border. The service was good, I didn't wait too long for my order either. The only reason why it's not a full 5 stars is the price. Plates are about $2 to $3 bucks more expensive than other places like this. Even other Pepe's around town are less than this location.
