We actually just came from there this morning and although they messed up our order and we had to go back inside the manager (I believe) asked me right away what happened and corrected our order right away. Got our sandwiches within 2 minutes and we kept the wrong ones as well.

When he came home my drink was full of just ice and the sweet tea is approximately like 4 sips and no more. They trick their customers who pays so much money to eat and in return they fill your cup with 90% ice and 10% drink. Their nuggets is overcooked and the spicy chicken deluxe is saggy with its pickles. My husband paid almost 20$ for my meal. I don't mind paying so much money for food but the food and drink must be the quality and appropriate amount. Don't go here or any of their restaurants it's NOT WORTH of what you pay for. Spend your money to a really nice fast food or restaurant that will give you what you pay for. It's a waste of money here. I would give it a Zero if I have the option! Look at my picture of all the ice they have in my cup. I promise you it's not from my fridge because the ice make is just from restaurants. So don't question it!

I do know that if I'm desperate and too lazy to get a sushi burrito a few blocks down, I can go here BUT just check the order after the drive through to make sure I didn't get a mess!!!! From one to three stars because this veggie wrap is really good!!!!!!! (see my pic)







I just wasted $19.10. Oh well. Fail.

Soo for the past 1-2 years ever since MommyTang did a MukBang on vegan at Chick-fil-A I wanted to go there. Even despising the company and their ethics I thought it would be fun.

I wrote a list exactly what to ask for and here is how it turned out: a total disaster.

Super food side: actually this was an edible item. I'm scared to know what the dressing is and I don't like sugar nuts, so those got tossed. For $3 something it was ok.

Fruit cup: smelled kinda weird, like an old refrigerator and I'm pretty sure they toss everything in sugar.

Half unsweetened tea half lemonade: was looking soooo forward to this item but instead it just tastes like a sugar water with lemon juice in it. How much sugar does this company have to put into their products?!?! Wow.

Fries: nightmare. They were half cold, half sooooo fried they crunched like a potato chip. No joke. Somehow they rang up two large sides and I only got one. Also they are soooooo salty they hurt my tongue. 

Veggie Cool wrap: it wasn't at all. They gave me a chicken wrap that smelled rotten and the only thing other than chicken on it was lettuce, red cabbage and carrot. This was suppose to be:::: Corn, carrots, black beans, red cabbage, tomatoes, and lettuce, all wrapped in a flaxseed flat bread. Unbelievable.

Sauces: I asked to all the vegan sauces they offer. See my pics. They all tasted the same. Sugar and salt gel. Just different tangy levels.

Call me CLEAN but I have learned my lesson. It's no wonder 'Murica has the diabeetus and super obesity. 
I feel sick and dizzy just eating a few fries, some superfood side, a few drinks of sugar salt water, fruit cup, and tastes of sauces.

I called them to tell them about their chicken mess up and the lady who answered sounded like blah blah. She has probably been sugar and salted today.

Two thumbs down. See my pics.",zgV0ZroIF956gw4cul8MHA,19,16,3,W-ZeyPgtFhIB-hNZMHl_OQ

Pulled around to the 2nd gentleman in the middle who called my name and gave me my receipt. Pulled around to the window and it took a little minute to get my food but the young lady made small talk with me till my food was ready. SHE DIDN'T CLOSE THE WINDOW AND SHUT ME OUT!!! Yes Chick Fil A you are redeeming yourself to the c customer service I've grown to love. I think they had to make my wake fries cause they were piping hot! 

Got my food and immediately dug into my bag for those delicious yummy hot waffle fries. There's just never enough of them.  Nonetheless they were absolutely cooked to perfection. My spicy deluxe chicken sandwich was absolutely amazing, juicy, and flavorful. And to rinse it all down I had some of the BEST lemonade on the planet and nobody can tell me any different!!!

1448107,2017-05-06,10,gcouHCQrswvakJ6xSEKtFQ,"I gotta lotta love for Chick-Fil-A, we go way back. Our relationship is almost entirely to blame for my Freshman 15, thanks to the location of a CFA in the basement of my dorm. I could literally roll down the stairs and swipe my dining card for a sandwich in the morning and/or do the same on my way back in at night.  Moving to Vegas, without any CFA locations, was an adjustment. I'm happy to have them back for quality on-the-go grub.

The classic sandwich is my go-to,  their lightly-breaded, always-juicy chicken doesn't even need sauce. Nuggets are available for those who can't resist the allure of the Polynesian sauce. The grilled option is available if you need to make good choices, but it's nowhere near as good IMO. Waffle fries are always awesome, though.

The breakfast menu is still fairly new to me, and what I've been acquainting myself with at this new location. The grilled chicken English muffin sando is hearty, but I'd suggest adding some sort of hot sauce for more flavor to start your day. 

Service at CFA is comparable to In N Out- they set the standard for their industries by being attentive and polite, all the time. There's a smile on every face, tables are always cleaned, and the lines move fast.

1543813,2017-11-01,0,gcouHCQrswvakJ6xSEKtFQ,"Just to note - our first time having Chick-Fil-A, no childhood memories are involved at all. 

Got to this location at 12:15 on a Wednesday and the line was out the door. We were leery but reviews said they move quickly so we ventured forth. It's true, they're very quick and also quite friendly. There were 2 employees taking orders from the line using tablets, then we just gave our name at the register to pay and get our sauces and drinks. We sat at a table and our food was brought to us shortly. I thought it was odd that they bagged it to go when we were dining in, but that didn't matter.

First note, hubby's lemonade - beyond tart. He grabbed some sugar packets to try to tone it down but it's a safe bet that we won't order that again. My Coke was fine, though slightly overfilled. It took a couple of napkins to clean up the overflow and I was glad that I didn't have to deal with that in my car.

The table wasn't cleaned before we sat down but it also wasn't completely gruesome. At that point in time, we just considered ourselves lucky to have even found an open table. It was cleaner when we left than when we arrived.

Now, the food. Hubby got the spicy original chicken sandwich with sriracha sauce and waffle fries. He ended up not using the sauce as the sandwich was exactly perfect on its spiciness and he didn't want to ruin it. The sandwich was a definite hit. The fries, sadly, were just average. Good potato flavor but not crunchy and it could have benefited from a bit more salt. Overall, he's a fan now.

I got the original chicken sandwich with the original Chick-Fil-A sauce and opted for the fruit cup instead of waffle fries. The sandwich was fantastic, tender and juicy chicken, seasoned nicely and not greasy. The sandwich only has pickles on it so I used the sauce which was slightly sweet and went well with the chicken. I was impressed with the fruit cup because it wasn't 90% melon like most fruit cups. In fact, there wasn't any melon, it was mostly apple pieces with some blueberries, strawberries, and mandarin oranges. The end result, I'm also a fan.

We'll happily eat at Chick-fil-a again but it probably won't be soon. None of their locations are in the NW so it's not exactly handy.",wOpzh1RYcz-SLu55NEaaBg,0,0,4,F42gudHt7ojc5sgAg-CcoQ

They even went to the back to hunt down a box for me to carry the 15 drinks I had!!

Vegas is a good foodies community and every time a highly-publicized chain restaurant (ex. Cracker Barrel and Chick-fil-A) comes into town, there are lines. 

It's just franchised food, so my rating is based on my experiences with other CFA out-of-state locations (including one in Atlanta).  The building is new, clean and attractive, service was efficient, and our original chick-fil-A sandwiches were steaming hot with a large, tender piece of chicken. 

The drive-thru has two lanes with state of the art monitors. The line moved well enough and service was efficient (in fact, get your order ready before approaching the speaker because they do prompt you to quickly order to move that line along). Also, there is now adequate parking for diners who want to go into the dining room, but the development is still unfinished so that could change when the other businesses open.",WlhETinld_UJHcFp6F8C0Q,2,2,4,W_6nAnN_QoIJIqR3OwFshg

1827288,2017-05-05,0,gcouHCQrswvakJ6xSEKtFQ,"Waited a few months to let the hype settle down around Chick-fil-A finally making it way to Las Vegas/Henderson. Chick-fil-A is one of my coveted pit-stops on road trips to California, and I was excited to finally have a location closer by. Last Tuesday the craving could no longer be subsided, and we headed to Chik-fil-A!

We live about 25 minutes from Chik-fil-A, and wanted to take the food with us to-go. I instantly became weary when we noticed the drive through line, but was shocked when I noticed their systematic way of splitting the line into two separate lines for efficiency. This drastically reduced the time we waited in Que, and provided us with extremely efficient and accurate service. 

All of the workers are extremely friendly at Chik-fil-A, and their was an excessive amount of workers at this location! (This was great for customer service, but made me wonder when pay-roll day comes around how the business stays so well afloat...)

We ordered two spicy chicken sandwiches extra crispy with extra pickles. The extra pickles and extra crispy touch add the final touches to an already delicious chicken sandwich. The breast is perfectly proportioned to the bun, the pickles are perfectly salted, and the spicy breading is executed to provide even coverage.

We also ordered two sides of waffle potato fries (extra crispy!) and also a chicken salad cup to try. I always get all the dipping sauces (Chik-fil-A, Polynesian, Honey Mustard, Garlic & Herb Ranch, Zesty Buffalo, Barbeque, and Sriracha Sauce), but Honey Mustard is by far my favorite.

The chicken salad cup was very delicious, but was too mayonnaise-based for me to enjoy a whole sandwich of. We munched this on the car ride home while waiting to indulge into our sandwiches/fries. The sandwiches stayed perfectly crispy, and the extra pickles were not forgotten. We popped the waffle fries into our Breville Smart Oven Air (must have appliance) and had the best waffle fries of our lives! 

Overall delicious affordable dinner, and up to California Chik-fil-A expectations. Yum!

I don't like the ridiculously long lines the drive-thru always has though. Seriously it's always a 20 minute wait. Ain't nobody got time for that. Sometimes when they are super busy, there are employees on foot taking orders which helps expedite things. Speaking of employees, they are always super friendly here. They even greet you by your name which personalizes the whole experience. 

I really like the chickN minis they serve for breakfast. It's just their chicken nuggets on soft, buttery, mini yeast rolls. So bomb. If you get a combo it comes with hash browns and a coffee. I like their hash browns as well, and they are excellent dipped in the Chick-fil-A sauce. I have a serious obsession with the the CFA sauce. It's amazing. I'd eat it on a shoe it's that good. They are generous with the sauces and usually will give you how ever many you ask for. 

For lunch or dinner I enjoy the regular chicken sandwich. It's a real chicken breast, white meat and juicy, on a buttery bun with pickles. Recently they introduced a new drink called the Frosted Sunrise. It's just orange juice and vanilla soft-serve, but it's super goood.

First off, being one of only three locations in Vegas it is ALWAYS busy. I repeat, ALWAYS busy. Now that we've gotten this out of the way, I can assure you that even if it is busy. You will receive your food in a timely fashion (with little to no errors, I myself have yet to experience any issues with any of my orders and this is not my first time at this location). So keep cool - you don't need to worry about long lines or not being able to devour some delicious chicken quickly. 

Now as far as what to eat goes, you really can't go wrong with anything on the menu. My personal favorites are the grilled chicken sandwich (not the club!) and the spicy chicken sandwich (comes with cheese, so good). And, you MUST, and I mean MUST top them both with some delectable Chick-Fil-A sauce. This is the best way to enjoy either of these menu items. With this lovely meal, you also need to ensure you order their fresh squeezed lemonade.

We love Chick-fil-a. The food quality for fast food is great. 

For me, I love their cool wrap - a grilled chicken flatbread wrap with vegetables and cheese. Pair it with the avocado lime ranch dressing, you got yourself some good eats for fast food. The salads are also pretty good as well.

My toddler prefers the grilled nuggets and is a huge fan of the fruit cup. I like that they have mini board books for kids under 3. I also like the kind of toys they include in the kids meal. Clearly, their toys are specifically currated to be fun yet educational at the same time. 

The hubs is totally into the original chicken sandwich with the honey BBQ sauce. He also loves the spicy chicken sandwich as well. He finds the fried chicken crispy yet retaining it's moist inner texture. The seasoning is not overly aggressive which is nice for younger palates like my toddler.

We usually always get the sweet tea and the lemonade. Both taste nearly home made. The lemonade especially is worth the extra surcharge.

Things you can skip? Personally, I am not a fan of their soups. They taste like a slightly fancier version of Campbell's.

The environment is exceptionally clean for a fast food chain. Fresh flowers on the table, specialized disposable placemats for kids, plentiful highchairs - these are all elements of a family sort of place.

The drive thru is always busy but there is always seats available for dining inside the restaurant. Weekends are always really busy and it is not atypical to see a line put the door during lunch hours. Luckily, they are staffed quite well so things generally run smoothly.

Reason being is, I have no idea why the lines be jam packed then when you get your food its cold and so old till the fingers are turning dark orange. You can tell they been sitting there for quite some time. How is this possible when the store and drive through is crowded? I think sometimes the employees cook too many fingers when there is a slight downturn in customers during non busy hours. Then all of a sudden a pack of people come at one time and now the restaurant is back crowded. They then start the ""conservation"", ""preservation"" method in which they give the customers old stale fingers that been sitting there for a while during a not so crowded time of day instead of throwing them away. Please stop this method if that is what is being used to save on ""food waste"". Everyone deserves a hot meal. They are paying their hard earned money for it. Chick-fil-a food is the best when nice and hot. It is horrible when cold and old. These lines are too long for someone to hang out in just to get their food and it is old and stale.

The drive through and the in store eat in lines are disgustingly long and expect to wait between 15-40 min on average especially on the weekend.

CANNOT STRESS ENOUGH: HUGE HUGE HUGE TIP- USE THE MOBILE APP- it takes 3-5min to register and add your credit card, then when you pull up like when my hubby and I did on a Saturday, your wait will be 5 min instead of the long time u need to usually wait. 

Best best best idea ever to get the app and preorder your order- only downside of the app is that you can't grab all the goodies like the extra sauces/honey/Mayo because the app limits you to 3 items per order. 
Also make sure, make sure you press on the app- the IM HERE button or else you will just sit in the car- that way they know to make ur order when ur pulling up.

Each visit no matter how busy, I've had a pleasant experience until I went to this location. I waited to come visit this store months after it's grand opening because I want to hype to die down a little bit. I went to the drive thru and put the timer  on, just to see how long the wait is, the line wasn't that long so I figured I would be out of there 10 minutes... maybe even 15 minutes top. Well, here's what happened. I see 4, 5 employees taking orders, they have two lanes. Instead of having two employees per lane, I notice one in my lane and 3 on the other lane. Ok, maybe my fault, I went on the wrong line. When I ordered I felt rushed to a point that I accidentally gave them my old card that I reported missing, so of course it's not gonna swipe, when I asked the guy for the card back and offered to give them another card, he said ""oh it approved"". I then drove further. I was stopped by another guy giving out receipts, but was told my card declined. I mean I knew it did so I gave him the other card. I even asked this one approved right??? To which he said, they'll have your receipt at the drive thru window. I was dumbfounded when they can't find my order once I got to the window and had to reorder again and swipe again, even if they had my drink order ready.  I can hear the supervisor say ""we're gonna have a delay, we're barely taking her order""  They asked for my name again and told me to pull over with my hazards on. I did, but after another 15 minutes of waiting in my car I finally came out and only at that point did I see someone come out with my food. When I asked if that was mine, the girl said, ""I'm not sure, what did you order again? They didn't give me a name or car description"" WTF.  30 minutes of my life wasted for mediocre chicken strips.

We ordered a  Chick-fil-A  and spicy Chick-fil-A  deluxe sandwiches and an order of waffle fries. 

The sandwich breading was a perfect coating and the chicken very moist. The spicy sandwich comes with a slice a pepper jack cheese which adds some heat. Both sandwiches come with tomato, lettuce and pickles and makes for a tasty chicken sandwich. The fries were hot and not greasy or oily. Nice crunchy fries.

Don't get me wrong the product is good. It's just NO DIFFERENT than any other chicken. Defiantly better than McDonald if that's a compliment.

The drive through took exactly 24 minutes for one sandwich. Totally wasn't worth a half hour of my life. The girls working the drive thru were amazing. Very sweet and polite and kept a 30 minute wait of cars very well organized. So kudos to the staff.

A huge NO-NO a member did was compare their sauce to Raising Canes sauce. That's one thing you don't do with competitors is compare your own product to theirs. In the long run Canes sauce is so much better but that shouldn't be said by staff.

I'm sure the hype will die down. But until then I have about 4 Canes here to choose from with the same quality food if not better and a lot shorter of a wait.

Judging from that and the long lines, you'd think it was some fast food offshoot of the French Laundry or something. Something. Anything. 
What it is is an ok  place for a chicken sandwich or fingers and not much else. If someone in your party wants a burger or something, go elsewhere. The service is quite fast, considering the lines ( again, WHY?), and the quality is ok if the selection is quite limited. For this, and the cleanliness, which might be attributed to its newness, I'll give 3 stars instead of two. But it's really just ok, and I fear that too many Yelpers have drunk the kool aid.

But they fail to do a quality check when they hand the customer their food, especially through the drive thru. When I say quality, it's more like quantity. It's very upsetting when you get back to work and hand out the food and one of the four main items is missing. I was not about to drive back and wait in line to start the process over.

I opt for the right for no particular reason. Three cars have gone past on the left and in front of me is what looks like a long-winded conversation between the employee and person in the driver's seat of the car. While I am a huge fan of human interaction and good customer service, it's about ten o'clock pm and I just want my chicken strips that are as soft as buttah. I'm also thinking to myself that I just don't want to wait in line as the employee gives her doctoral dissertation.

Finally I make it up to her and I immediately feel guilty for being so impatient. This girl is chipper, sweet and polite. After taking my order, she clearly deserves five stars for being so nice and having to deal with the public. I drive up and give my money to another chipper employee who calls me by my first name. Nice touch. 

I drive up to the food window and two more employees are chipper, prompt and both call me by my first name. Five-star drive-thru service game.

One star missing because the sweet tea was not sweet enough and tasted like water. Also this particular location does not carry coleslaw. I guess I am the only one who likes coleslaw with their fried chicken? I was SUPER pleased to try the super-food salad and so glad I opted for the large. My coleslaw disappointment immediately dissapated after trying this salad. I think they need to package the nutmix. I will buy it in bulk. Delicious. 

I really can't tell you what the hoopla is about Caine's. I prefer the chicken at Chic Fil A 100% more. It is much more tender and the sauce can't be beat! 

One of my friends won't eat with me at this restaurant due to her political stance towards the company. Super glad I get to live in a country where we all get to voice our opinions. My opinion is that this is one of the few companies left that have a dynamic positive culture that is shown through and through in the way it's employees interact with the public while also serving consistently good food.",4Iwu57GSychxpqa4w4HAMQ,0,0,4,Oznm-tGz0GH6TT0tlmfR7w

I have been by several times since opening and will no doubt be back several times more. The staff here go above and beyond to make sure your experience is excellent and I have been inside, in the drive-thru as well placed mobile orders and each time my food has been consistent and I've never had to wait long. I mostly always place mobile orders since it's just easier and you can still redeem rewards including calendar rewards with mobile ordering with very little if any wait when you arrive to get your order. 

Chick-n-Minis ($3.15) - Why oh why do you only get an option for 4 count?!?! I'd really like at least an extra mini, so a 5 count would be great. Maybe one day we will get the option of how many per order just like with the nuggets. The minis are Chick-fil-A Nuggets on a mini yeast roll that is brushed with honey butter. This is my absolute favorite thing to eat here! Good by themselves or dipped in your favorite CFA sauce. Only available at breakfast time. 

Hash Browns ($1.09) - I had to start ordering myself and hubby our own orders of hash browns because one order simply will not do lol. These crispy and tasty gems are addicting! I open up the box that they come in and it looks like a lot, but before I know it the box is empty and I have eaten them all because they are just yummy.

Chick-Fil-A Deluxe Sandwich ($4.05) - This chicken sandwich has lettuce, tomato, dill pickle chips and American cheese on a butter toasted bun. It doesn't come with mayo or any type of sauce, so you'll need to ask for mayo on the side or one of your favorite CFA dipping sauces. I personally like extra mayo on mine and it comes in packets here which I like because then I can add the amount I want. This is a very tasty sandwich and filling. 

Waffle Fries ($1.99 for a large) - These are hot, crisp and tasty. I prefer to eat these right when getting them rather then taking them home to eat because they loose the crisp factor and get softer as the waffle fries sit in the bag during the car ride home. While good by themselves, dipping sauces make the perfect paring for these waffle beauties. The dipping sauces come in a variety of flavors and they'll add any of them to your order at no charge. You can however purchase larger take home tubs if that's your thing. 

The drive-thru has 2 lanes and they always have several people out there keeping it moving along. They offer catering. Eat Mor Chikin.",Fv0e9RIV9jw5TX3ctA1WbA,80,83,5,fDtGnwfukgQjA8MA79zM6Q

I'm a big fan of their spicy deluxe, ice cream cones, waffle fries, chick fil a sauce and their crushed ice.

I'm not a fan of frozen lemonade. I was expecting a lemonade slush and instead it was like a lemon starburst milkshake. Next time, I'll probably go for the basic lemonade or pretty pink watermelon limeade.

Granted I haven't had amazing experiences every time I've gone to a chick fil a but most are above average. This one wasn't on point. Food was good so I gave them three stars. Knocked two off because their customer service wasn't up to snuff. We wait in line about 5 minutes upon arriving and when we get to register we order. They had a delicious sounding watermelon mint lemonade advertised and I asked if it was extra to get that versus a standard lemonade. The kid at the register said no. We didn't wait long to get our order and sat down. I looked through the receipt and sure enough there was an extra charge for this lemonade (size small btw). Well, I decided it was an honest mistake so don't worry about it....just eat it off. It's hard to think bad thoughts when stuffing your face with delicious crack nuggets! That lemonade was so good! So good I ran out and went to get a refill. GUESS WHAT!!!? They wouldn't refill it with watermelon mint lemonade!! Yeah, you heard me. The team lead that tried to explain to me that I can get free refills, just not for the watermelon mint flavor. I was perplexed and asked for plain lemonade which was ""ok"" to have refills on. I sat down and enjoyed my ice cream and again ran out of drink. I knew I wasn't ""able"" to get more lemonade with watermelon flavor but I still didn't understand why I couldn't when there was not one single place on the menu or advertisement that stated free refills were prohibited. I also noticed the big wig manager dealing with a lady that clearly perturbed about something. I overheard him saying that e could give her anything she liked to make ""it"" right. I said to myself, I guess I'm not the only one having issues today and attempted to talk to the original team lead about why I couldn't have watermelon mint lemonade? Same answer and was dismissed basically. In hindsight I should've talked to the big wig to get some answers but it looked like he was having a bad day already. Perhaps I have a high standard or this experience seems petty but being a former chick fil a employee in the heart of Georgia I know the service and customer satisfaction goals of chick fil a and these guys don't have it. They just opened about a month or two ago so I recognize most of the kids are new (and we aren't in the hospitable south either) but my concerns and questions as a customer matter and when I pay extra money for something and am told I can't have a free refill when it is not specifically stated that I cannot then I'm not gonna be satisfied. What makes matters worse is that I drive almost 30 minutes to eat here! I invest my time and money in a place I love but if I get treated like a dollar sign instead of a person I will just go to another establishment. I pray the chick fil a opening in north Vegas is on point!

I went back today and had just the basic chicken sandwich.  A LOT better.  Nice and moist.  Like all fast food it was way over salted and I'm spitting dust 3 hours later despite drinking water non-stop since then.

They really need to work on the fries.  They were very hot but still not crisp. Do they pull them out too soon because of the long lines because I would wait a minute longer for a littl crunch!

Tips/Heads Up
*This location is very busy (especially the drive thru) so make sure you plan ahead. Pulling in and out of this shopping center is tough and you can be stuck in traffic for a bit depending on what time you eat lunch/dinner.  
*The restaurant is pretty big so it's a great place to bring the whole family. 
*Location is on and off the I-15 freeway. 
*If you're staying at the Palace Station, just walk here to eat vs driving. It will save you a lot of time.

I always get the number one. Whenever going to a chain of any sort I always go with their main item-as that should be the best offering. You cannot go wrong. The barn is soft the fried chicken is juicier than ever conceived possible and yet crispy at the same time. Each sandwich comes with a pickle on it which adds the perfect amount of kick. I adore the waffle fries, not too greasy perfectly salted and delightful in every possible way. My favorite sauce offering is the honey mustard. I always asked for extra so I can keep it at home.

The staff here reminds me of Kentucky, in the southern hospitality type of manner. Always smiling, ready to serve you in anyway you need, and genuinely happy that you have come to visit.

The first two locations are actually located in Henderson.  So technically, this is the very first Las Vegas location.  I drove by on their first day of business and was shocked that the drive-thru had only 4 cars in line.  Well that was last week.  The word is out.  This Chick-fil-A is open and it is busy.  The drive-thru line was long, but looked quick and organized.  After cars pay and pick up their food, they're directed to a separate tent where they can get their dipping sauces.  The lines inside the restaurant made it to the doors, which isn't that long.  We are pros at busy Chick-fil-A's and will take advantage of the One App whenever there's a line. We ordered ahead, waited 7 minutes & 23 seconds, and picked up our food.  We dined inside and it wasn't crowded at all. The restaurant is very clean and sports a lot of Chick-fil-A Vegas advertising. 

Chick-fil-A didn't invent the chicken, just the chicken sandwich.  That's one of their mottos.  If you haven't been to Chick-fil-A, then I suggest that you try the Original Chicken Sandwich with their chicken strips or nuggets.  In my opinion, the Original Chicken Sandwich is just okay.  It's their nuggets, both grilled and breaded, that I love.  Each chicken nugget is made with real chicken meat, just enough breading, and taste so good.  Their grilled chicken nuggets is the bomb too.  I can't end a Chick-fil-A review without mentioning their waffle fries.  These are the best and there's no wrong way to eat them.

4146944,2018-01-30,2,gcouHCQrswvakJ6xSEKtFQ,"Note to self, stick with the fried chicken.

I tried the egg white grilled chicken English muffin thing on the menu this morning and let me tell you, the English Muffin is where McDonald's is winning. This egg white chicken sandwich was all kinds of disappointing. The grilled chicken was a tiny little piece of thin, chewy poultry. It was over seasoned with black pepper which is a turn off for me. The egg white was just flat and uninteresting as egg whites tend to be. Half of the cheese was on the wrapper and not the sandwich. Just not good. I like the chicken biscuit, the original chicken sandwich and the spicy delux sandwich. Not this egg white grilled...whatever.

I also like the waffle fries at Chick Fil A. As well as the hash browns. Usually. Even those were a let down today. The hash browns were chewy like the rest of my meal. Like they had been re-heated. And I could taste the oil they were fried in. It was either old or over heated. Not good. 

I don't think I've ever had a real problem with this location at Rancho and Sahara when it comes to lunch. Breakfast today was just not that good. That said, I appreciate that they had decaf coffee ready. I didn't have to wait for them to brew it like at the other location I usually go to.

I visited this location one tuesday morning before work to get me a wheat bagel sandwich with chicken and cheese with a side of hash browns. It took no time for me to order, pay, and receive my food. The workers were pretty happy as all chick-fil-a workers are. However; my reason behind the 4 stars and not 5 is because I waited to eat  my food until I go to work and I was simply disappointed. 

My food was hot and fresh and my hash browns were simply fired to golden perfection, however; I had the smallest piece of chicken on my sandwich. The chicken was so small that all I really tasted was cheese and bread. This looked more one of their nuggets than a chicken breast. If my chicken would have been bigger to fit in my bagel then I would have gladly provided 5 stars. I'll defiantly give this location another chance to redeem themselves on the lunch menu, so ill update my review then.

The spicy chicken is my go-to sandwich, and I just love how fresh their chicken tastes.

My original favorite is their grilled chicken sandwich. Just to emphasize how well it's made here, I wanna point out that for one, chicken is my LEAST favorite meat. And secondly, GRILLED chicken is also my LEAST favorite way that I want it cooked. 

But man. That chicken. What do they do to it to make it so juicy and tender. I feel that juice squirt action when I bite in. 

I love their honey bbq packet sauce the best, over all the other sauces, including the chik-fil-a sauce.

One late night, my sweetheart and I decided to be happy (instead of skinny) and made our way to Chick-fil-A. On a late Tuesday night, this place was buzzing! After trying the food, I can see why.
I ordered a Deluxe sandwich with waffle fries and strawberry shake; my honey had nuggets, spicy sandwich, and waffle fries. Can I just say, I LOVE waffle fries! I didn't think it was going to be crispy when i saw it, because it looked so pale but thankfully they were. Phew! Soggy fries is a ""no bueno"". The sandwiches were great. I really enjoyed my deluxe - it comes with lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, and cheese. So yummy! Strawberry shake was good too, nothing fancy. Oh and chicken nuggets were great, crispy and juicy. I appreciate Chick-fil-A having a variety of sauces, I sampled all of them and enjoyed Ranch the most.
Even though the restaurant was busy, we ordered though the app on our way there and got out food within a couple of minutes at a pick up window. Great option since the drive though looked super busy!

I visited the newest location with a loyal Chick-fil-A veteran one afternoon after hiking at Red Rock. We were starving and decided to check out this location since it was on our way getting back into town. 

The drive through line looked horrendously long so we decided to park and go eat inside. The wait was out the door but moved surprisingly quick. I do have to say I was very impressed with Chick-fil-A's staffing (I couldn't even count the number of employees working - they were everywhere and all grinning from ear to ear) and they really ensured a smooth flow of traffic. We ordered while in line with an employee holding a tablet and was at the register paying in less than 10 minutes. 

My friend said we HAD to get the:
- Spicy Deluxe Sandwich with Pepper-Jack cheese 
- Waffle Fries 
- Polynesian sauce (really stressed on this)
- Sweet Tea and Lemonade

...It was a tasty chicken sandwich. I think with all the hype and excitement of this fast food chain coming to Las Vegas I was expecting THE ULTIMATE chicken that tasted like no other fried chicken has tasted before. I can't say that I was floored or blown away by my meal (waffle fries were pretty bomb though) but it was definitely a yummy chicken sandwich I would eat again!

My maiden voyage to Chick-fil-A was heavenly. 

Went with chicken strips and waffle fries. 

The chicken strips were moist and juicy. The waffle fries were crisp and tasty. 

Most of the time when a place like this is hyped as being really good what people mean is that it's really good for an inexpensive fast food restaurant. 

In-N-Out is the best example of this. 

People go there for the first time expecting a world class burger. 

What they get is a really good fast food burger that's better than anything else in that price range. 

Chick-fil-A is different. 

Chick-fil-A chicken can go head to head best overpriced ""as seen on the Food Network"" chicken restaurant out there.

The spicy chicken sandwich was surprisingly good. The chicken was very crispy on the outside, crispier than the nuggets. The chicken itself was tender and moist. It is just a tad spicy but I do feel like it could use some sauce so I added some chick-fil-a sauce which worked
with it too so regardless, probably the best chicken sandwich I've had. Would recommend. 

The nuggets, like the chicken in the chicken sandwich, was crispy on the outside and tender inside. However while it wasn't as crispy as the sandwich, it was still good. 

Even though I don't really eat fries, these were delicious. It came piping hot. It's lightly salted, is crisp on the outside yet soft inside. I think the waffle cut is cool too.

Line was long but moved suprisingly fast. Staff was super friendly. Our order was big and what impressed me the most was it was complete. Nothing wrong or missing!! EVEN with a full restaurant. 5 stars there!! Woot! Woot!!!

I have never been to a Chick-fil-A. This was my first time, and after I tasted their chicken sandwich  I understand what all the hype is about! It's absolutely DELICIOUS!! Chick-fil-A - ""A Fan I Am! :)""

Only thing I would change is adding ANOTHER location in Summerlin! Pretty Please :)

BBQ sauce was good but the ranch was super watery. The fries are horrible. Not crispy at all & just mushy with no actual seasoning to them. I just don't understand why people hype this place up so much. If I want food chicken, I'll go to Raising Canes where the food actually tastes good for what I'm paying.

I used to always eat it at the mall as a kid/teenager. I had not had it since I left Texas in 2012 and I ain't driving to Henderson just for a sandwich and some nuggets. The drive thru line is like In-N-Out which is crazy. I'm not waiting that long. So I look online and see they have an app! 

I get the app and place my order. When I get there I tap, ""I'm here."" I park in the parking lot and go up to the app order window. Employees everywhere are always polite and that's especially unusual in Vegas so it's even more appreciated. You also get rewards for using the app. It was excellent not to have to wait in line. 

We ordered a kids meal (nearly $8.00!), Two sandwich combos and 2-12 piece nuggets. It was $35.00. It's much cheaper in Texas! 

I get in the car and can't wait to eat. Then I realize they forgot my sandwich. The kid at the window was a sweetheart. I'll revise and add his name. He gave me my sandwich no problem and realized he forgot to scan the app on my phone. Then he tells me to order a water on my app since it's free so I can get credit for both purchases. 

He was very enthusiastic and friendly and talked about how much he likes his job. That's so refreshing to hear in this town where everyone seems to be hopeless.

Total was $13 & some change no problem i knew the prices going in.... Now the problem I'm having after sitting waiting for my food i notice there were 2-3 people who already received there food & an employee walking around asking some who havent received there order myself included are you & is your name Robert or Roberto?.... Still waiting i see a group of 6 people get there food.... I now get up walk to the counter... I'm assuming on of the managers may i help you? I answer yes I've been waiting for my order? I give them my name & receipt i say Tony but my name was never asked for by the cashier.... One employee says his order is right here under Roberto (if this isn't a stereotype or racist shit I've heard) yea I'm not Roberto i repeat i was never asked to give my name.... The one employee states we will get you a fresh order i say ok already upset & highly disappointed at this point.... Then the original guy who started to help me says here you go sorry about the inconvenience & gives me a free sandwich card?... I guess thanks goes through my head.... I sit down still to eat it there & fries were soggy as was the sandwich!!!! Strips were extremely soggy too!!! Clearly weren't made fresh for me already knowing they didn't by passing me this garbage of a free sandwich card maybe comp my meal i just paid for since it was literally over 15-20minutes old.... None of the problem was my doing? I'm a general manager of a papa John's pizza & mistakes do happen if need be fix the mistake & please the customer! 

#1 Name was never asked for at time of order= not my mistake it's your cashier

#2 When walking around with my order instead of asking me or any other customer if are name is Robert or Roberto check receipt to see if order matches.

#3 Don't say you're going to remake my order fresh for me & not do so.

#4 i understand you want sales but maybe Refund me or make my soda & fries Large size now for the wait... 

#5 is what you decided to do... Give me a free sandwich card... So yea i guess thanks... But i don't agree with how unapologetic the were sorry was...

The wife wanted to eat here and she pretty much gets what she wants .... pretty much. 

So many people but they handle the hungry masses here with grace under pressure. Not 1 but two drive thru lanes with employees outside directing traffic and taking orders. You can tell everything here is process oriented. Despite the hoard of people, the wait in line was less than 5 minutes and no problem finding a table, and this is the location closest to the strip. Plenty of parking. Plenty of outside shaded tables. Plenty of employees on dining room duty to keep the area clean and tables a turning and can you believe it ... drink refills at your table?  Wow!

I always brag to everyone that the customer service is incredible and about how your order isn't ever wrong...until this location. WHAT IS GOING ON? I'm going to have to start checking my order before I leave like I'm at McDonalds. (Insert roll eye emoji) 

Tonight, I ordered a 6 count nugget kids meal with Chick-Fil-A and Polynesian sauce with a medium Arnold Palmer to drink and a large number 1 with a lemonade to drink. I got Sprite instead of Arnold Palmer, no Polynesian sauce, and my fries are burnt?   The receipt is correct, so I'm not sure where the issue happens, but this happens almost every other time at this location...and it literally BREAKS MY HEART.  

I would prefer waiting longer in line to ensure I get the correct order than feel rushed to check that everything is correct in the drive thru (no one wants to be that person) or get home to incorrect items. (Insert pissed off emoji)

I tell the person who brought the meal that the food was to eat there, not to go. I'm told that this location, unlike all of the others, serves everything to go (not served on a tray). So I'm supposed to eat off of the table with no tray? I turns out that there are plastic place mats but you have to ask for them. They are kept out of view. Why can't the employees just give you one to begin with? Back to the food. What I got was an ice cold sandwich and soggy fries. After much prodding the sandwich was replaced. I wanted ketchup. Guess what? They hide in a drawer out of the customer's sight. Why? I finish my meal and am about to leave when I happen to look at my receipt. I find out that I have been charged extra for the diet lemonade. I go to the counter and ask to speak to someone about this. Over comes Jim who is supposed to be the manager. I point out that the menu sign says that a drink is included with the meal. He tells me that lemonade is not considered a soft drink. Once again, WHAT? So, I say ""Why doesn't the menu board say that there is an extra charge for lemonade or why doesn't the person taking the orders let you know that?"" His reply is: ""You should have known that it was extra"". When did I become a mind reader? Somebody needs to tell the guests that there is an extra charge for certain beverages OR make sure that it is clearly written on the menu sign.

I ignored the Henderson location until the one in Rancho and Sahara opened. It's still a far drive from my place but I said, what the heck I want to check out what the buzz is all about. 

We went there after a little past 8pm on a Friday night, we were prepared to wait forever but surprisingly there wasn't any line for dine in, but the drive thru was very busy. 

For a fast food chain, they have a very fresh quality food. I ordered the Spicy Deluxe and it was really good. The waffle fries was a little undercook for me so next time I'll order them well done/extra crispy. The service was very fast and the staff are super friendly. The fine in area is also clean. Just FYI, the drinks are behind the counters next to the register, but you do get refills for as many as you want.  And the staff are very good with checking on you if you need any refills or extra sauce. My favorite dipping sauce is their Garlic Ranch.

However, we've been able to find parking easily on both visits, once at night and today around 10:30am.  The best thing to do if you want to beat the line is use the CFA app and do a mobile order, which my boyfriend usually does.  Your food comes out quickly and then you can still grab a seat in or outside the restaurant.  We didn't use the app today since the line wasn't that long.

5790062,2017-06-22,0,gcouHCQrswvakJ6xSEKtFQ,"I'm not quite sure WHY Chick-fil-A is the hype. Because it was on our ""to try"" list, we gave it a spin.

First of all, when you get through the long line that spans out the door, the ordering process is straightforward. The line, however, does move quite fast. So even though it's outside, you'll move fairly quickly. The drive thru, that's another story. The line was spanning out of the parking lot onto Rancho Drive during lunch. I wouldn't bother. Probably would be best to order via the app and pick it up and the pick-up window, which they do have.

I tried the 12-piece nuggets combo with the waffle cut fries. I try nuggets everywhere, so I'd like to think that I'm a connoisseur of chicken nuggets. And you know, I honestly didn't think that the nuggets were all that great. This would be dead last on my list. There is a hint of sweetness to the batter, which I found to be odd. I also felt that I HAD to dip it in ketchup or the sauce in order to make it taste decent. I had ranked Burger King on the list of chicken nuggets that were dead last because they don't taste too good. The Chick-fil-A ones, they are now dead last. Heck, Burger King's nuggets are wonderful compared to Chick-fil-A. 

My wife tried the chicken sandwich. She said it was ""forgettable."" I took a bite of the breaded patty, and while it was ""decent,"" it was forgettable. 

The waffle cut fries, however, was quite good. But you can't just have great fries! You need tasty main dishes as well, and sadly, Chick-fil-A does not. And to be honest, Carl's Jr. has better waffle cut fries.

We ordered and dined in. The food arrived quickly and was adequate in temperature. I like how they will bring the food to your table.

Maybe we will go back and try them again. Maybe we will try something else. But until then, we have no desire to go back any time soon.",7nEnXfmm3ICIJtGtFAMMuQ,1,0,2,w-HXIzpTndgcm4gkB2IXGg

I like my chick Fil a a certain way. Extra pickles. I asked for it on the side so I can have it with my fries and sandwich. I reiterated to the checkout thst I wanted extra extra pickles.  I got a little plastic cup with 2 pickles in it.  I went back up and asked for a cup of pickles a s received three more little cups so now I have 6 pickles.  I got to the Fries and it was 4 waffles fries and the rest broken little bits.  My cookie( can't have a meal with out a cookie at chick Fil a ) was nice and cold.  When I asked for the pickles, the manger in the black shirt asked the other shift manager to get me a cup. He came back with the extra little plastic cup. Nobody checked up on me except for an employee, roman, and today is his first day. Maybe he can teach the management about customer service.

Noticeably more news media coverage at this location compared to the opening of the Chick-fil-A on Eastern. But the parking situation and even the line during the noon hour is very customer friendly (police presence just like the other grand openings, probably every employee is scheduled to work at least part of the day and the line was almost non-existent.

Had I not accidentally left my form of payment in the car, I would have spent under 4 minutes from the time I walked up to the end of the line and getting my order after paying for it. But you know, add the extra two minutes for the extra round trip to the car.

Also they are selling limited edition T-shirts commemorating this event for $15, which I passed up on. Last time I scored a few Chick-fil-A swag, but today they seem to be more tight fisted about it (if there are even any free swag to be passed out). Also menu is recycled/reused for future customers, which is good for the environment and their printing budget for color menu.

Overall, a very nice experience. Also trying their Nuggets for the first time, which is good and lived up to the hype.

Still not a fan of the traffic getting here (off ramp off of a very busy section of the freeway) or the way the parking lot is designed (not their fault).

Anyway, love the quick efficient service and the still brand spanking new look of this very newest Chick-fil-A, and their Nuggets. There's also a possibility that you might be interviewed by one of the local news reporters about this grand opening.  That Asian news reporter is pretty cute and the one in the van applying her makeup for News3 is also an eye candy (even without the full makeup effect). 

Well, this wraps up my brief 4 star review of Chick-fil-A on Sahara. It is the closest one to my abode, so I will likely overlook the seemingly flawed parking lot design and busy intersection it is located by and make future stops here for one of my top two picks in the National Fried Chicken Playoff.
