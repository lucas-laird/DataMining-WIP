Not only did they short us a roll, when we went back and requested the full order the server became upset with us.  When she finally ordered the forgotten roll, the server and sushi chef began speaking in another language, looking at us and laughing loudly.  I guess something about them messing up our order was funny?  The sushi and tempura were sub-par.  I will never go back to this place again--why pay to be treated like an amusing joke?  Guess that's why we were the only customers in the place.  How hard is it to get the only outstanding order right?  Utter disappointment.",4uhwI7dYFZCUgWOcsCND8g,0,0,1,bQ9dcHi6PrUMhmICSBgSiA

He had the eat all you can sushi and before sleeping that night, he vomitted once and all throughout the night, probably vomitted about 8 more times that finally ended in him ending up in the emergency room of Summerlin Hosp early morning Saturday for food poisoning, as explained by the ER physician. Some of the sushi my son ordered did not look fresh and I told him that but he said its taste ok but I what does a 15yo know about what's fresh or not. I should have tasted it before allowing him to consume the sushi. I thought about what could have caused this incident w him and I can only put my finger on the sushi.

252762,2009-03-19,2,qPeHkpE_2rx7BYhJ4XmZ8Q,"Eh, finally tried a sushi joint close to home, went with Richie H. to check it out the sushi joint out of sheer adventurism and to help support  locally owned businesses. 

The decor is pretty minimal with the star of the dining room being the sushi bar located on the right side of the room.
 
The service wasn't too bad, I didn't encounter any unpleasant service or anything like that. In fact, they were very attentive and wanted to make sure we were comfortable during dinner. An extra * for that! 

However, the food could use a bit more help. While the fish was OK, the portion could use a little help. It was a bit on the smaller side, while being pretty thin. The rice could be way better, sushi rice needs to be a little more on the grainy side with the eater being able to feel each grain separate in your mouth. Well, not in this case! Kinda of too sweet with the rice being a little on the mushy side. I know I'm kinda of nit picking, but if you think about it, especially in Vegas aka. in the middle of the desert, almost all of these restaurants go to the same fish monger for ""fresh"" fish. Rice is the thing that's going to separate the good and the bad. Also, they did this weird thing with the scallops, they actually minced it like the spicy tuna roll meat, so getting the scallop nigri sushi was out of the question. Maybe a cost saving move?    

Maybe I'll check it out again, but who knows. Until then, if you happen to be in the SW and don't feel like driving very far for some sushi, then is may be a compromise.

The guy who works there, the waiter, owner, whatever has the personality of a mackerel!
The staff there and at their other location near Rhodes Ranch, have terrible personalities. They do not say thank you when leaving or entering. When I go there I feel like I am intruding on their time. There is a place called Sushi Koma on Flamingo and Durango...I will just drive there next time....(it's farther) but at least, those people appreciate your business.

The main part of sushi is the rice and it was very mushy yet hard, meaning it was undercooked and then left out for a long time making the edges of each rice hard. Let alone the texture, the flavor was awful. The fish was so thin and was not fresh. We only had an hour for AYCE, and i couldnt hang. It was torture and the waitress was a chinese snob. How can you mess up sushi this bad? Going here will give you the experience. Even the low sodium soy sauce was not low sodium lol. How is this place still running?

Before calling this place I looked over the lunch special menu, on the top of the  menu there were these two words that I hate!! ""NO Substitutions"". I looked all over the menu for the combo that I usually get, but for some reason they did not have it.  I made my call over to this place and I was about to place a nice sized order for my staff and I.  I asked the gentleman, who I felt was rushing me, If I could get tonkatsu instead of chicken katsu with beef terri, the gentleman said that they ""Do not offer this combo under the LUNCH SPECIAL at all""  OK understood.  I then asked him,  okay well I don't want the lunch special, would I be able to get one plate of beef terri and a side of tonkatsu.  The gentleman replied, NO, I can not do that.  I asked him why, he said that it was too expensive to do it like that.  I asked him how much would it cost for me to get this, he chuckled and said like $30-$40 for the plate for doing this.  I WAS appalled by this response.  One, how do you know what I can and can not afford.  Two, your a restaurant and you should accommodate your customers.  Three, there is more then just your Japanese restaurant out there.  Four, provide people with alternatives or options instead of just saying NO!!!  I will not recommend this place to anyone!

This place made me realize that their are 2 types of sushi chefs -- (1)The super serious just-take-whatever-I-give-you chef and (2) the fun loving come-on-in-everybody sushi chefs -- Unfortunately this place had the first kind of sushi chef -- the mean mugg dude that acts like he doesn't want to be there... the type of dude that doesn't ever go off the grid and just sticks to the menu

Speaking of the menu, it's REALLY confusing because they have these LITTLE menus that show pictures and names of the different types of sushi fish and it's on this stand up V shape card that's actually meant to be a promo for a certain type of sake or Japanese beer or something -- THIS IS NOT THEIR MENU -- Their menu actually looks more boring and is just a list of things in black and white... I mistakenly tried to order something I saw on the little promo menu and he told me THAT'S NOT THE MENU IT'S JUST FOR PEOPLE THAT DON'T KNOW WHAT SUSHI LOOKS LIKE -- I get the point but from a customer's POV it's just confusing that you have something that LOOKS like a menu... albeit a second, smaller menu... but what was disappointing was that this little menu had fish that the restaurant didn't even have -- So, ONCE AGAIN... why bother having this little menu at all???

The sushi chef wasn't a total a-hole. He just didn't have (what I would consider) an upbeat and pleasant attitude -- and when customers are asking you for certain types of fish or for you to make a roll a certain way -- whether it's on the menu or not -- you should have a better response than ""We don't have it""... or in this dude's case he pretended to NOT understand what I was asking for.

The salmon and tuna HAND rolls were the best thing here. The saba (mackerel) didn't have that fishy taste that I was used to and was actually quite bland -- The main reason I wanted to come here was because I wanted to try hamachi -- but it was nothing to write home about

As soon as you walk in, you can smell the strong fishy scent lingering in the air (I probably smelled like fish after I left). The glass of water that was served to me had a really strong afrer-taste. It was very yucky. I started off with miso soup. It was nothing special. Then came the shrimp tempura. I was impressed because the shrimp had the right crunch to it. The shrimp was also not soggy or chewy. The seafood ragoon (is that how you spell it?) was not very good. I only ate one of the three pieces. The tuna and garlic tuna nigiris were actually good. The tuna was not dry at all unlike past experiences with other joints. The Japanese lasagna was not very good either. We actually ended up having two pieces then gave it back to them. I liked their baked green mussels. It was served on a really big round shell. I thought that was a nice touch to it since its never been served to me that way. I was disappointed that their salmon kama was not a part of the AYCE lunch. I tried their smoked salmon and it was extremely salty. The saltiness overpowered the smoked flavor. Our server did a decent job at keeping up with us. He only forgot two things: smoked salmon and our check. Overall, it was an okay experience. Still satisfied my sushi craving but I don't think I'll be coming back.

Let's start with the stuff I like:

Inaka Roll
Shrimp Tempura
Spicy Shrimp Roll
Tuna Rolls (any variety)
Steamed Dumplings
and more on this later...

Placed just inside Mountains Edge, Inaka is hidden between a gym, a yogurt shop, Subway and a Mountains Edge Dental. The place is typically quiet and that results in first class service. However, I have no doubts that they would be able to keep service high even with many more people frequenting the place.

I personally like to sit at the Sushi bar and give my order straight to the Sushi chef who knows all the items off of his head. This is great, but you should see him pump out rolls for the people who order All You Can Eat (AYCE). I am more of an ala carte kinda guy because I don't eat that much in the first place.

About the food: Sushi is fresh, veggies are fresh and the sauces are good. There is only one other sushi place in town that does it for me and the quality is just as good, if not better then that place.

Although the all you can eat sushi's are popping up everywhere in the southwest, it is in an area that is just beginning to develop so I don't know if that's why they didn't have business. Kinda weird because it was a weekend! There were only a couple other people in the restaurant. I think most locals have their all you can eat faves like Sushimon :). 

The nigiri was ok, fish was cut thin and small pieces, but rice sucked. When the rolls remind me of something you can buy at a grocery store, it's a bad sign. They had alot of the crab mixture filling them up. One roll we got was covered in mayo and sauce which made it better. The cucumber salad had a dressing straight from the bottle and the tofu was not the way I was used to from other restaurants. 

For being empty the service sucked. At other all you can eat, the waitresses are usually right there ready to take more orders. Also this waitress did not seem like she got her sushi training because she was having a really hard time answering questions etc.

Sometimes I'd be on a sushi spree and have all you can eat weekly. I've been on a hiatus after experiencing other sushi joints in my neighborhood. My friends that I've taken here have said that it isn't as good as others, and of course I had to try it out. 

After I while I decided to come back here because it was always my fav to come to eat alone, since it isn't that crowded. I arrived 30 min till close with my mind set on getting a couple happy hour rolls. The hostess, which I think is also the owner/manager, greets me and asks if I want all you can eat or happy hour. For some reason I hesitated, then she says ""probably happy hour because all you can eat will only be for 15 mins"". I'm kind of thinking.. Why did you ask then, but glad she kept me aware. I ordered two mountain rolls and an order of tempura. My total was the same as all you can eat pricing.... What's happy about this hour??? I can order more rolls at a place without happy hour and be cheaper and better food. 

Mountain rolls are my favorite here, I discovered this before I ventured off into sashimi. I know they take time to make because they are baked... Didn't mind this. When I received the rolls however, they looked rushed. I didn't take a picture, wish I did, because I felt that I needed to hurry up and leave. Presentation isn't everything... But it helps. As I was eating them, they don't taste as good as I remember. Almost seem over cooked, and we're falling apart. 

I get that I came in later than I would normally... But I've never had an experience like this here. Maybe it has something to do with the experience I've had at other joints in the area since.

I ordered NIgiri, Salmon, Yellowtail, Spicy Tuna, Halibut and Tuna. The only fresh fish I got of the bunch was the Salmon!!!!! The Spicy Tuna tasted and smelled very bad. I took one bight and nearly wanted to VOMIT! The Halibut was also spoiled!!!! I can't believe they would serve such old disgusting fish. When I complained about the fish and it's very potent smell, the waitress then confronted the Chef. He looked at me as I was stupid. He then took some of the Spicy Tuna with his hand and shoved it in his mouth! Thereafter saying that, ""You're crazy! You probably don't know what good fish is! Everyone that ate it today said it was great!"" I figured that everyone couldn't have been more than one person.... I didn't eat any more sushi and ordered a Miso soup which wasn't bad. Obviously you can't really mess up MISO. I didn't complain after the first time and kept my mouth shut. They don't want input on their food so I had to put it on here. I paid my bill and left a 10% tip. I work in the service industry and I know how bad it is when you get stiffed. 
Please take my advice. Don't eat here! The service is just as bad as the food.  In a competitive market like Las Vegas service and quality is very important. There at Inaka I will never go back.

The Salmon Kama was perfect. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/inaka-sushi-las-vegas?select=mGxF9VycMweaT8yX91vQLw#mGxF9VycMweaT8yX91vQLw Seasoned and cooked perfectly I should've ordered more of this. Having had Salmon Kama at a lot of the good AYCE sushi spots it was maybe best done here.

The Green Mussels were good. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/inaka-sushi-las-vegas?select=SgY609FWYyumxdK3nHdyBg#SgY609FWYyumxdK3nHdyBg The mussels were separated from the shell, baked up with some mayo sauce, and served in a large hot shell-like container, it could've been a real shell but I don't know. I'd eat it again, can't say no to baked mayo things.

The Fried Aged Tofu was good http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/inaka-sushi-las-vegas?select=BWxE9Xk3pUOlb79Rg5G1GQ#TFitLA0VBCRzNXenjCgI-A and simple. It was served hot so let it cool down a bite, I burnt my mouth after the first bite.

The Leo #2 roll wasn't that great http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/inaka-sushi-las-vegas?select=qZgA2rEBe0t46SRX_EfzTw#qZgA2rEBe0t46SRX_EfzTw It was filled with shrimp tempura and jalapeno and covered with eel sauce, spicy mayo, and tempura flakes. Way to much tempura flakes and spicy mayo wasn't spicy if anything it tasted just like mayo.

The nigiris for most parts were bad. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/inaka-sushi-las-vegas?select=BxkesQEfcsvHjYZY78f2AQ#BxkesQEfcsvHjYZY78f2AQ The tamago was OK, the uni was hard for me to eat, the other 3 in the pic wasn't so good in quality.

My Chinese girlfriend and I have gone to Inaka three times over the course of five years. The deal is it is in the neighborhood so I REALLY want to like this place!

This place has been consistently over-priced, low-quality sushi! The first time we went there my girl-friend swore that they swapped out eel-sauce with maple syrup! Today the miso soup was... honestly, I am not sure what it was... The salad tasted like it had some ranch dressing variant. The sashimi lunch special for $14.95 was about half the amount of other places - thin, had a weird sauce on the salmon, and one piece tasted partially frozen. The cucumber was cheap? How can cucumber be cheap?

We actually had okay service today, but last couple times the waitress had to pull herself away from the Chinese programs on TV to check on us...

I am praying that Mountain's Edge grows up with some shopping centers so a real sushi bar be built in our neighborhood. 

For now I suggest: 808 Sushi on Durango, Ohjah Japanese Steakhouse Sushi & Hibachi off Blue Diamond, Sawa Sushi in the Kohl's Shopping Center, or Kazuki Sushi in Southern Highlands.

The service was a bit of a mixed bag. They were very prompt and courteous, however they have a penchant for missing items ordered on our menu, as it has happened both times I've been. This isn't a huge issue, but it's an oversight nonetheless.

For a neighborhood sushi place, Inaka is a pretty good spot.

The AYCE was reasonably priced- I'll give them that but- the quality of the fish was horrible.  I felt like I was eating sushi from Albertsons.
The miso soup had like, pureed snippets of seaweed and teensy bits of tofu.  The spicy tuna was DEFINITELY prepared in advance and had very little tuna in it.  The rolls themselves had very, very small filling and lots of too sweet rice.
I think I am equally disappointed because its SO close to my home...I'm on the hunt for a great local sushi and...my hunt continues.

We ended up going here because we live around the area & didn't have much time to eat before work. We were the only ones in the restaurant & I could sense the server behind us waiting to take our plates away when we would finish our rolls :P Anyway, the sushi chef was very friendly, told us to come back for dinner because they have certain rolls that's for the dinner menu only. They also have beer & sake specials Mon-Thu night. They do NOT offer those cards where you get to eat free after x amount of times. The price is about $22 for lunch, not bad at all since the specialty rolls are around $10 each.

The sushi was decent, nothing out of the ordinary. We had all you can eat sushi & if you order soy paper for your rolls it's an extra $1. The shrimp tempura was good, my friend ordered it as an appetizer & I had it in a few of my rolls. I had the seaweed salad for an appetizer & the serving was a good size. No complaints from me! I'll be back again since I can't have meat on Fridays during Lent :D

btw I think they changed their hours & stay open only until 11pm daily.  the hours on their chopsticks say 1 or 2am? yup.",VomrqwTbz1hxmZpL69u5XQ,1,1,3,UhfWVlFLNRYNM-ZrkVeVag

I decided to give this place a try, after driving by and seeing that they were offering all you can eat sushi for a set price. I came with my boyfriend and knew that this would be perfect since we both have excellent appetites. When we first arrived, the hostess was sitting in a chair and the place was pretty much empty. There was one family of four sitting across the entrance.

We decided to bring our 16 month old and did know our visit would be cut short if he started acting up, so we quickly ordered our choices. About 15 minutes into our visit my son started acting up and we had about 4 different sushi choices on our table. (The all you can eat buffet was 23.99 per person) (Our choices added up individually to about 26 dollars) We decided we had enough and didn't want to risk our son flipping out more. 

We asked the hostess if it would be ok to box what we had on the table. She smiled and walked over to the two men making the sushi and when she came back, she told us that next time we needed to try harder to eat our food. She stated that ""this"" time we will let you slide but next time we will need to finish what we ordered. I was a little confused by what she was saying and was under the impression that she will box the little bit we had on the table.

 I do understand this was a ""buffet type"" of sushi and under any other circumstance, we would not be able to box anything up. While we asked for the check and I began to take my child out of his high chair, the hostess grabbed all the food on the table and tossed it in the garbage!! I was horrified and got very upset that she would throw it away the way she did. If I would have know that she was going to throw it away, I would have asked her how much extra?? Mind you, we were already paying almost 50 dollars.

Finally, a sushi place in our neck of the woods and an all-you-can-eat one too, no less!  (Even better, the Husband was more than familiar with their first location after being a regular there.)

Joining us was Melissa G. and another friend from SoCal who never gets AYCE sushi ever.  The dinner menu is $23.95, which is cheaper than some of the other sushi restaurants around.

It was pretty empty on a Saturday night, but we figured it was because of the location more so.

The menu selection is pretty standard with appetizers, nigiri, sushi rolls, and ice cream included in the AYCE.

Appetizers: 

* Age Tofu (Deep Fried Tofu With Tempura Sauce) - Not quite like other restaurants where it sits in broth with bonito flakes.  Rather it's slices of soft tofu, lightly deep-fried, and tempura dipping sauce.

* Shrimp Tempura - Standard, nothing special.

* Green Mussels (Baked Mussels with Special Mayonnaise) - When we ordered this, we thought it was just regular baked green mussels.  It's more like ""Dynamite"" because of the mayo sauce and served in a scallop shell.

* Yakitori (Grilled Chicken on Skewers with Teriyaki Sauce) - The Husband ate all of them, so I guess it was okay.

* Seafood Ragoon (Deep-Fried Mixed Fish and Cream Cheese Wrapped in Wonton Skin) - It had a stronger salmon taste, and a dipping sauce would have been a good complement to it.

* Miso Soup

* Cucumber Salad (Sliced Cucumber with Sesame Dressing) 

Nigiri:

* Amaebi (Sweet Shrimp) - Limit of one order of two per person.  It wasn't exactly what I called amaebi, the raw sweet shrimp.  It's a fake and bad substitute of two pieces of cooked shrimp sitting on rice.

* Albacore (White Tuna)

* Cajun Albacore

* Hamachi

* Garlic Tuna

* Ikura (Salmon Roe)

* Saba (Mackerel)

* Sake (Salmon)

* Hotate (Scallop) - Before ordering this one, we asked if the scallops were small ones mixed up with stuff or the larger variety.  The waitress confirmed it was the larger variety sliced in half and laid over the rice.  Well, when she brought it over, it was the former variety and not what we wanted.  It's a good thing we only requested one order since we ended up not eating it.  The waitress said it was because she was new and didn't know.

* Uni (Sea Urchin) - Limit of one order of two per person.

From the first bite of sushi, we knew that we weren't going to be happy.  The sushi rice was mushy and lacked the vinegar that makes it sushi rice.  Over and over again, I was getting less than impressed with their rice.  Blah.

Sushi Rolls:

* Salmon Skin Handroll

* Spider Roll (Soft Shell Crab, Crab Salad, Masago & Eel Sauce) - Melissa G. wasn't too impressed with their version as they use a different batter so it comes out a lot darker and not as tasty.  It was alright.

* Something Wrong Roll (Deep Fried Assorted Dish Fish Roll with Spicy Sauce) - It's tasty because it's deep fried and sits in a bed of mayonnaise spicy sauce.

* Catepillar Roll (Fresh Water Eel, Cucumber & Topped with Avocado and Eel Sauce)

* Kiss The Ass (Spicy Spider Topped with Spicy Crab) - I didn't even realize there was a soft shell crab inside because the crab concoction dominates the roll.

Before we started ordering any of the rolls, I asked the waitress if they used Sriracha to make the hot sauce.  After much confusion, she finally went to the sushi chef to ask.  They were making a big deal out of it as if I was asking for the secret recipe to their spicy sauce when all I wanted to know is if they use it at all.  The final answer, yes.  I'm not a big fan of the stuff in my sushi.

Dessert:

* Green Tea, Plum, and Mango Ice Cream - Pretty good ice cream, and we all had our share.  Good stuff!

Service could use some improvement.  With only two parties present, our waitress was too busy socializing than getting our order or refilling our tea and water.  Some orders were forgotten and needed some reminding.  The other waitress was a bit pushy about rushing me to clear a plate off as she waited so she could take it away.

Overall, we were less than impressed and won't be going back.  It was just disappointing and screwing up the basic sushi rice is a bad sign.",rt3PC7WCgCKsoufmQJELfw,16,7,2,RQj8dK_ADBfH-P6llc01Gw

5373552,2011-04-11,0,qPeHkpE_2rx7BYhJ4XmZ8Q,"Sunday sushi excursions prove to be more difficult then one would imagine. Tried to go to two different restaurants, on different sides of town, to find out that they were either closed or not open for lunch. Finally, my group called to make sure that Inaka was open. Finding a place close by to satisfy our sushi craving, we ventured here. I remember disliking the one on Eastern, but went here with an open mind. Sometimes different locations can prove to be drastically different.

The decor is nothing special until you look up at the ceiling. Beautiful paper parasols are hanging down creating a colorful display. The area is small, but the tables are spaciously spread out. 

The sushi chef is friendly and was preparing our food at break neck speed. The presentation of our meal was nice and neat. The woman that worked the front of the house was more reserved and could come off as unfriendly, but was helpful. She was willing to answer any of our questions. Since we came with a mom that is still new to sushi, it was beneficial. 

The appetizers were limited and nothing special. Seaweed salad is a dish that I can devour bowls of. Inaka's was on the dry side. The tofu has the broth on the side for dipping and did not come with the benito shavings. Our party did enjoy the squid tempura though. They are little rings of meat dipped in batter and fried to perfection. They are tiny and easy to eat. They remind me more of potato chips than your usual calamari or tako karaage.

The down side were the rolls. The fish were fresh, but the sushi all tasted the same. Anything that was suppose to be spicy was bland. What the rolls lacked, the nigiri made up for. The Cajun albacore and garlic tuna are both flavorful. The tako and ika were chewy, but not rubbery. Inaka does not have halibut, so that was a big disappointment. Out of all the rolls that we ordered, the only one that stood out to me was the Leo #1, but that had the garlic tuna and Cajun albacore on it. 

If you must have sushi on a Sunday and can't wait for dinner, then this place is acceptable, but there are many other places that have a wider selection.",N3oNEwh0qgPqPP3Em6wJXw,1,0,3,j-7xQVGZjrruqeSob2T2VA

This place is legit right by my house and I had the feeling that maybe, just maybe, it wasn't as bad a people say. You know, Yelpers tend to be overly generous, so if this place is rockin' 2 stars, that doesn't bode well, but maybe Yelpers tend to be a little overly critical as well? Who knows. 

I have never had AYCE sushi before - that's not to say I've never had sushi, I've just always had it one roll at a time. When my friend Gil R. came by to visit on 6/12/14, I decided that maybe it was time to try this place out. 

Because we went at a certain time, I believe before 7 PM, it was Happy Hour so we got free hot sake with our meal. 

There was nothing I tried that I didn't like. Nothing. And that's saying something because my friend Gil is a big guy (6'2, 410 lbs) so I got to try a LOT of rolls. I thought everything was great, minus the ice cream. It was just meh. 

For $52 for two people, I'd say this place is a great deal. I did order uni and it never came out, but Gil warned me that I would hate it and that it's a good thing that it didn't come out so we didn't have to pay for the uneaten portion. He also said the fish wasn't the freshest compared to other AYCE places, but that it was still good. I thought it was fine.

I'm not exaggerating when I say the best part of the meal was when they notified me that after the second beer, the third would be free. 

They messed up rice... RICE! How the...? It was hard to even swallow the rice; it was too dry! Uncle Ben's minute made rice has treated me better. Also, no Uni, no toro despite it being pictured on an advertisement, and no super white OR and other fatty fish that could make up for it.

I ate a lot of Nigiri on the AYCE menu and nothing really tasted fresh. I've eaten a lot of sushi in my day and the fish here was NOTICEABLY different IN A BAD WAY. I know. I know; all you can eat sushi is not the way to go if you want good sushi (under most circumstances), but this place was something else. I wasn't even going to try a roll after the nigiri, but I went with a half roll of something on the spicy side. The roll that they presented me with was something u might find in an Albertson's; wrapped up in plastic to take to go (maybe even worse). 

Let me emphasize: DAMN IT! I was really hoping, despite the not-so-great reviews that this place would be okay or at least bearable. I won't be back. Very simply: the place sucks. And that's too bad.

Hopefully one day when I drive by in the future there will be a big banner that says ""Under New Management"" or something because they must know. They must know that they're setting standards that no one should be proud of. 

**sigh** the whole experience was disappointing. At least the free beer has helped mask my utter discontent with this place!!!! The service wasn't bad but who the hell cares when the food blows ass.
