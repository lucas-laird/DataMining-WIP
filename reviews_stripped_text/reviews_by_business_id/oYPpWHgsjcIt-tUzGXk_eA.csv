I would have given 4 stars, if it were not for the price and the wait....  $15 for a sandwich, fries, and drink.  Ouch.
I appreciate the fact that the lemonade was from real lemons, and the giardinera was homemade, and the italian beef was well stuffed, but $15 seemed like a bit much, especially when considering the seating and tables have not seen a dime in upgrades or maintenance in a decade or more.  I know it takes time and money to make good food from good ingredients, but a few bucks and a few minutes less would have been nice.",rhuF_oUmqKYB0j02gJAEKg,1,0,3,t44cUrrG6i2npJgHRexY4g

We also had an order of medium garlic fries, which is bigger than what we expected for the size, same for the lemonade also mediums. We took the food to go and surprisingly after a 15 minute drive the food was still good. The two people working there are super nice and friendly. Only downside is that it is a little pricey.

Went here during a short stay in Vegas and was not disappointed.  I ordered the Chipotle burger, for I believe 8.75.  A little high priced for a burger stand, but considering the toppings, definitely worth it.  Garlic fries were awesome too, although I would have preferred a bit more garlic.  Strawberry lemonade to wash it all down was delicious.  Not too heavy or sweet, nice and light, perfectly complementing the heavy burger.  There is only outside seating, a negative in the hot vegas desert, but there were umbrellas on each table, which were all actually very clean.

However it is well worth the wait.  Garlic fries are a must-thin fries with garlic seasoning.  Note, the portions are very generous-share the fries with 2 or 3 people.  Three square meal fries-(fries are thicker than the garlic fries)- is definitely a meal in itself.  There was so much food topping the fries- it was enough to feed 2 people (1/2 pound each of pastrami and rib eye, chili, cheese, grilled onions, bacon, jalape√±os and 3 fried eggs! HUGE!!!

I have now noticed that I have used a lot of exclamation points in the last few sentences, I gotta say when I talk about this place I get a little excited.  haha! 

So I've had a few things on the menu, but if you go you have to try the Pastrami sandwich or Pastrami Burger, you won't be sorry.  The garlic fries are awesome and they really have a good selection of drinks, I like their flavored iced tea's myself.  You pretty much can't go wrong with whatever you order.

I wen't here because I saw it on a TV show and the burgers looked amazing.

Unfortunately, it was too good to be true. The cons:

- Overpriced! The quality isn't there, neither is the quantity.
- The Garlic Fries don't have real fresh garlic. I grew up near Gilroy, the garlic capital of the world, and if you served these fries at the festival calling them ""Garlic Fries"", you would have a long line of people wanting a refund.
- It seems like Sammy sold-out and the business is run by other people. The person that helped me out didn't speak English well and her customer service was worse!
- You can't get a free cup of water, even after spending thirty bucks for a burger and fries. The lady's excuse was that she didn't have a faucet, or something like that.
- Last but not least, they have fees for everything (not surprised) and their menu has no prices on it. I guess that's how they get people to order a full meal not realizing they're spending so much.

They need to be avoided at all costs. I was told by multiple people that this was the nice little hole in the well (or tiny trailer in a parking lot, as it were) that would handle my pastrami cravings. By the way. I love PASTRAMI. Its something that helps restore my faith in the universe. 

So after all the hype, how was Sammy's? Ehh. It's not bad by any stretch.Nor does my previous use of rinky dink work against it. I'm an east coast city guy. Some of the best spots are rinky dink. No, the problem with Sammy's is that they spent all the time and effort pushing fries and other things that are allright, but kind of left the real star in the background. That being the pastrami. The thing in their name. Yes, they DO have pastrami. Yes, it's pretty good pastrami. It's sort of like going to a movie and seeing your favorite actor die halfway through. You just feel a little disappointed and ""ehh"" about it. 

I know there are people who LOVE the fries. I did not. They were okay. I know people love their other items. I just shrug my shoulders. It's called Sammy's PASTRAMI & Burgers (I take no issue with the burger part, as they were apparently pretty good). It's not Sammys Assorted Fatty Foods.

On top of this the website was incorrect about the hours  (their OWN website, that is). The guy working the shack was rude. The prices were a bit on the high side. 

In conclusion, would people please learn that Reuben is just one style for pastrami? I don't need 1000 Island and cole slaw for every.....single...pastrami...item.

Anyways, I went here for the first time today with my girlfriend. We get there and the menu seems even larger then it was online (which is already HUGE). There were so many choices it, it was fantastic and overwhelming at the same time. We ended up on getting a Big Ass Bacon Cheeseburger and the Pastrami Fries.

So, first brought out were the fries. Picture this: delicious, crunchy fries, then topped with meaty chili, then a layer of succulent pastrami, then loaded with cheddar cheese on top (not done yet!), then onions and jalapenos! I put my fork in, got a piece of everything, took a bite and was in heaven. Absolute deliciousness, and every bite was just as good as the first. Oh and I forgot to mention, the plate/basket was huge! That could have filled both of us alone, and it was only the medium!

A few minutes later, the burger was brought out. Two 1/4 pound patties, 12 (yes, 12!) pieces of bacon and a quarter pound worth of cheese. A delicious, hulking monstrosity. The only downside was that the burger meat could have been better, and the bacon wasn't very crispy, otherwise it would have been perfect (well, a little bit of some bbq sauce perhaps, then perfection status).

So, to break it down, the fries were easily 5 stars, the burger was 3.5 to 4, the ""decor"" 5 (reminds me of Pinks in LA and Maxwell's Street in Chicago (both places I grew up in) and service was fine as well.

1099112,2011-05-19,1,oYPpWHgsjcIt-tUzGXk_eA,"So being as Elite Emily is in LA this weekend, I'm forced to come up with my own culinary adventures. As I was pondering what to have for lunch, I remember our mutual friend Josh raving about Sammy's Pastrami. Mmmm yummy. Pastrami is for pastra-ME.

Now, for anyone who lives/ed in Simi Valley (or select locations in So Cal) they've surely had pastrami from The Hat. Sammy's is to the Hat as a Yugo is to a Mercedes.

When I first pulled up to this shack (yes, it's a little hut), I was surprised that there was only outdoor dining. I didn't expect lavish dining rooms and fine china, obviously, but I would have liked to sit inside. But the weather was nice, and I really wanted to try it, so I sat outside facing the world's crappiest drivers headed down Decatur Blvd.

I ordered what I usually order at The Hat, a Pastrami Burger, no cheese. As I looked over the side options, I asked, ""Do the fries come with that?"" Nope.

Gack. Everything is a la carte.

Envisioning the dollar signs quickly spinning in my head, I ordered a small Smokehouse BBQ fries and a medium cherry lemonade, since the LVRJ nominated it for best lemonade. Can't be too bad, right?

Total, for one person, for lunch = $15.51.

Double gack. Double gack and ack, even. Thank god there were generous people checking in to the hotel last night and I had tip money to use. Still. no one meal, especially for lunch, should be $15 from a food shack.

I sat outside sipping my cherry lemonade, watching drivers on Decatur attempt to kill each other via vehicular manslaughter. Their lemonade was nominated for best in Las Vegas? Maybe it's just me, but lemonade should be tart, even with added flavors. This was too sweet. I wasn't totally pleased.

When the Smokehouse BBQ fries came out, I looked at... a basket of fries.

Triple gack. Really? If I pay $2.99 for a small basket of Smokehouse BBQ fries, I expect a little more than fries thrown around in the same BBQ-esque seasoning that gets on your fingers from BBQ LAY'S F***ING POTATO CHIPS!!!!!

Oh, by the way, no service. They just bring it out to you. Ketchup? Hah. Napkins? Two tucked into the basket, hope they last!

When the pastrami burger arrived, it was okay. Nothing like The Hat, which is like the deli scene from ""When Harry Met Sally"" acting out on your taste buds. This pastrami burger was more like the remake of ""Land of the Lost"" -- mildly tasty in some parts but mostly forgettable. The pastrami was fresh, but the rest of it lacked.

And it was greasy. Hoo boy, was it greasy. Like, squeeze it on your axles greasy. Like, slick back an entire mob cartel's hair greasy. It didn't drip, it flowed. I'm fine with greasy, but this was too much. 

All in all, the food saved it from being a 1-star. But there's much better pastrami in Las Vegas. Bagelmania, a deli on the east side of the strip, is one place. I'm sure there's more out there. Somewhere.

All I know for certain is that I'm going to get a second opinion when Josh recommends food.",8prr02BTumjFLYSLmMpO1Q,0,0,2,sHx1FiEbRh0V8EJTs_9mXA

I ended up with the pastrami fries which was a huge plate of fries layered in pastrami, cheese, jalape√±os, and onions. It was certainly filling and did not disappoint me. The sliced layers of pastrami were huge and covered all of the fries. My entire party was satisfied with their meals as well.

Even though this place was empty (i wonder why....umm bad food bad service????) my food order still took forever, the cook was constantly on the phone talking in spanish saying ""i'll call you back i'm working"" 

all in all the burger was ok (really does need the onion rings to help soak up the soggy mess of a burger, the garlic fries i ordered were terrible and the fried mushrooms were mushy inside and the batter was undercooked, all their stuff must be frozen and just fried there hence the no onion ring fiasco.

We decided to hit this spot up before heading back to LA.  My brother and sister-in-law had been here before and they were craving the pastrami, as well as their strawberry lemonade slush.  Having said that, that's exactly what we ordered.  We ordered 1 XL and 1 L LA Pastrami, which comes with pickles, mustard, and provolone cheese, and 3 XL strawberry lemonade slush.  We also added a L order of garlic fries.  All in all, our total came out to around $50.  I thought it was pretty pricey at first but after I've had their pastrami, it made more sense to me.  

The garlic fries were pretty good.  Not too salty and a lot of garlic flavor to it.  They're skinny type fries so that was different.  The strawberry lemonade slush was just as delicious as they said it was.  It wasn't too sweet, it wasn't too tart, and the flavor of the strawberries were present.  Lastly, the pastrami was amazing!  It wasn't too fatty but it was nice and juicy and the provolone was a nice touch.  

The owner was pretty cool.  He claims there's a Sammy's in the valley somewhere in Pacoima being run by his sister but we figure it's no longer there because we couldn't find it anywhere on Yelp.

And, if you're in the neighborhood, well, doesn't that make it into an obligation?  Sammy's wasn't a let down, but not a place for me to make a special trip.

It's the type of place that's hard to write about because it's what you'd expect.  

I shared two sandwiches, a pastrami and a corned beef - both on a roll.  I ate the corned beef first, and it was very good.  Salty and briskety, just the way its supposed to taste.  Then, I ate the pastrami.  It was good, no more, no less.  Although it wasn't shaved pastrami, I would have liked the slices to be a little thicker.  Maybe it was just my pastrami, but the meat itself was overwhelmed by the salt - and the melted cheese on the sandwich overwhelmed everything.  Although there was as much cheese on the corned beef, on that sandwich, the cheese more or less complemented the meat. My verdict - next time, I will not get my sandwiches with cheese on them. 

The portions are large - it's kind of like when you try and put a thick Louisiana hot link onto a tiny store brand hot dog bun.

So, the portions are large, the taste is adequate. The corned beef would be a 4 and the pastrami a 2, to average a 3.  The prices fit the taste and the portion.

TL;DR - Generous portions of great junk food that we all secretly crave. Menu may not reflect their actual inventory. Order extra sauces on the side. 

After seeing some pictures of what seemed like the best cheat meal food I could find I decided to drag my wife to this spot. 
Our order:
Animal Burger
Steak Sandwich w/steak sauce on the side
Deluxe Chili Cheese Fries
1 med Lemonade, 1 med soft drink
Our original order also included sweet potato fries and a chocolate milkshake, however I was told upon attempting to order these items that they didn't have them. I can understand running out of sweet potatoes since it was late evening, but no milkshakes? Anyway, we quickly got over it. 

The Fries were the first to come out and while they weren't the greatest fries I've had they served their purpose of good ol' dirty junk food. (See pic) Not knowing their sizes I ordered the large and it definitely lived up to the size. They could easily feed 4 people, and even without an entree 2 people could eat these alone and be full. The ""medium"" drinks we ordered were also pretty generous for being called mediums, as they'd qualify as a large, or even extra large, at many establishments. 
The Animal Burger and Steak Sandwich came out about 10-15 min after the fries. Their burger continued the large trend and was a very hefty sandwich. (See pic) I ordered the double but it comes in a triple option which I'm glad I didn't opt for since I had trouble getting halfway through. 
The Animal Burger comes packed with cheese, jalape√±os, bacon, grilled onions, tomato, an onion ring, and their signature sauce. Lots going on. I like my burgers with a little more pink, but in their defense I didn't really tell her that. The sauce could have played a better role. I didn't even taste the sauce until halfway through the sandwich, which speaks more to the construction of the burger, and it made a huge difference. I'm a condiment guy so had that sauce been present from the first bite this burger would have been phenomenal. Unfortunately by the time I experienced it I was pretty full and couldn't fully enjoy it. 
The Steak Sandwich was great and simple if nothing else. Meat and cheese packed between Bread. Isn't that what we all really want deep down? The steak sauce which we ordered on the side was not your typical A1 but I liked it. Much spicier, but still holds the classic tang you'd expect from a steak sauce, yet not as thick. Wife didn't much care for it. Wife's verdict ""Possibly one of the best sandwiches I've ever had"".",O8G7YD1ohYIiqpq6e67nVA,1,0,4,J7qJ2o5s6HGcOAk4m2yZVA

It's salty, cheesy, humongous, packed with delicious pastrami, and gooey, but once the fried egg part of the burger was eaten, my last few bites of the burger became ""whatever.""

My recommendation: ask to get a fried egg on the pastrami fries! Mmmmm...I wish we thought of that when we were there.

My total bill was $22.56. Kind of expensive, but the portions are huge.

First, when we arrived, we waited in line for about 15-20 minutes to place our order. Considering that there were only four people in line ahead of us, that seemed excessive. Little did we know that the wait to order was short compared to how long we'd wait for our food!

It took at least 20-30 minutes for our food to be served. People who were in line waiting to order in front of us got their orders, finished, and left before we were served. And this isn't a gourmet fine-dining establishment; it's a sandwich hut. That's way too long to be served.

Our sandwiches weren't anything to get excited about, either. I had the regular LA pastrami sandwich, which was fine, as far as it goes. My wife had ordered the pastrami combo, which was supposed to come with a Polish sausage on it. Apparently, ""Polish sausage"" is code for mediocre hot dog, because that's what came on top of her sandwich. Very disappointing.

On top of everything else, it was way overpriced. Two sandwiches and two sodas for almost $26. Ridiculous.

The worst part is, we drove past much better restaurants to get to Sammy's. We drove past Pop's Philly Cheese-steaks to get to Sammy's. We won't be making that mistake again. If you want a great sandwich, drive 2-3 minutes up the road to get to Pop's. If you must have pastrami, go to Capriotti's across the street. If you just want to get rid of excess cash, give it to a worthwhile charity. But I can't think of any reason to go Sammy's, at least not for us.",MR3J2kX-Ofxkspdd-6ogpQ,7,0,1,C9ReaWPti67RgiLJlBLhXA

Sammy's L.A. Pastrami is known for their pastrami sandwiches & burgers, which has been placed on hold on my ""to-try"" list! They also serve handmade lemonades, hotdogs, and fries!

This small joint deserves way more credit than it gets!! One of my homegirls, @Jessica, recommended this place to me about a week ago. Since then, I've been TRYING to wait patiently until the day I finally get to test it out! This was it!

It is a family-runned business and I got to speak with one of the family members (shout out to Brian!). First and foremost, the service was incredible! Brian was indeed USEFUL, FUNNY, & COOL!! He was extremely patient with my friend and I (since I was a newbie, I was asking a bunch of questions. Lol) So... be nice!! =)

& TO THE FOOD: On this journey I got to try...
-Pastrami dog: a beef dog with mustard, cheese, & pastrami on top! Absolutely unique & tasty!
*There are more dogs @ the Decatur location if that's what you are craving =)*
-Fried Zucchini & Mushrooms w/ranch: C'mon now, who has fried mushrooms?!! BOMB!! & this was also the first time I've tried fried zucchini, DOUBLE BOMB!
-Garlic Romano fries: Extreme crisp perfection! The fries are also perfect size. There are small, medium, and large options (they are pretty generous servings, so you'll get your money's worth!)
-Handmade Pomegranate Lemonade:  This definitely caught my attention!! =D While we were waiting for our food to be made, our drinks were given to us (AND REFILLS WERE INSISTED!- THAT DESERVES A 6TH STAR IN MY BOOK). Zestyyyy!

My lady and I ate here last year and without question, it tasted like a whole different place then--in a good way. 

Today, the garlic fries came out cold, slightly stale and crunchy. 

My single pastrami burger was overly salty and I'm sure the burger patty was frozen, not fresh--which gave it a bland flavor on top of being dry. 

My lady got the Philly cheesesteak and that wasn't too bad, it tasted as it should have, but could have been more hot when it came out. Definitely the better choice between the two of us though.

We ordered the big ass bacon cheeseburger, and pastrami fries to share. The food probably took around 20 minutes to make, so I got kind of annoyed while waiting. I kept telling myself it would be worth it. I wanted to try the burger because it had 12 pieces of bacon on it, and as a bacon lover, it looked pretty awesome.

When we got the food, I dug into the pastrami fries first. The fries themselves were perfectly cooked. They were crispy and delicious. The pastrami they used was a little low quality and more on the fatty side, but I still thought that they were pretty good. The portion was huge, and I think 3 people could have shared it. They could have melted the cheese better onto the fries, but it's okay; I didn't mind too much. We also added jalapenos onto the fries for a spicy kick.

Then, we started on the burger. It was the moment I was waiting for, and we cut it in half, and I took a bite. It was so overcooked that the meat was grey. I'm not even kidding. It was really low quality meat as well, probably the same quality as taco bell. It wasn't seasoned at all, and it was all around gross! The cheese had a weird taste to it; the menu said it was cheddar, but I've never had cheddar cheese that tasted like that. 

When I took a bite with the bacon in it, I literally wanted to spit it out. It was not crispy at all. I thought since we waited 20 minutes, the bacon would be nice and crispy, but no dice. It was fatty and disgusting. I did not eat more than a couple of bites. 

I do want to come back here and sample other stuff on the menu because the place deserves a second chance. Maybe they were just having an off day, who knows.",-zWAApe_-ZLX5HfyAsaLQg,1,1,2,tffHOBX4_KFTx-PyOs9TDQ

I went in at 7 pm on a Thursday and the place was staffed with one hardworking individual - working the kitchen, register, drive-thru, etc. It's almost like they don't plan on doing much business at dinner.

I waited about ten minutes to place and order and I went for the Philly Cheesesteak and an order of Garlic Romano fries. I knew it would be too much food but I wanted to try each. I also wanted iced tea but the dispenser was empty so I went with a bottled water.

The Philly was good and greasy as I anticipated. The regular size (smallest) is a good size, well stuffed sandwich. I like how the steak, peppers, onions and cheese are all mixed together - the cheese isn't just ladled on top. The greasy flavor, however, was a bit too much for me. I felt more like I was eating the char and grease of the grill vs. the flavors of my own sandwich.  I wouldn't order this item again.

As for the fries they were good but I had hoped for something a bit more from scratch. The shoestring, extra-starched for crispiness fries are frozen, food distributor fries. Instead of fresh garlic, Romano and parsley it appears they use an off the shelf mix containing all three. Instead of hitting a home run with the fries they simply get on base.

I live not too far from this drive-thru and have always wanted to see how good it was being that I LOVE pastrami sandwiches. I decided today would be the day to check it out and BOY was I disturbed. Firstly, when I drove through there was not a speaker box to order from so I drove directly to the window. There is no detailed menu anywhere around the building to peruse while you wait for someone to take your order. I waited a couple of minutes for the lady to come to the window and when she finally did it reminded me of someone at their home who wasn't expecting company. She did NOT smile, say ""welcome"" or even ""hello"". She looked at me with a look of disdain as if I was about to disturb her kids afternoon nap. She said ""yes?"" and I told her that I didn't see an order box, she said ""you order here."" Oh! She handed me a large menu and left, she was fixing someone else order which was fine and I understood she was the only person there so she had to help other people as well. (I wonder if she gave them the same treatment?)

Anyway, I had decided on the 'Split Decision' which is a combination Pastrami & Corned Beef with an Oreo Shake to wash it down with... sounds yummy! She said we don't have Shakes. Oh! so then I said no worries I'll just take the sandwich, can you add sauerkraut or onions to the sandwich. She said it only comes with pickles and mustard. Oh! Really? 

That's when I noticed the hand written index card that said they charge $1 fee. I asked what the fee was for and she told me it was the fee they charged if you use a Debit or Credit card. She said they charge them to use their services. Funny that, I told her that many other businesses accept credit and debit cards and don't charge a fee to use. The customer shouldn't have to pay extra for the convenience of using a card. I didn't think it was fair to penalize me for using my credit card when just about every other business does not. She LITERALLY said ""Oh well!""

I decided then and there that this was not the place for me so I said I think I'll pass. That's when she finally smiled and said (and I quote) ""Great, that's perfect!"" and closed the window on me.

It's unfortunate that she works there because this shack has such great potential to become the neighborhood go to for Pastrami sandwiches. With the right management, empoyees and marketing they could have lines out the door (figuratively speaking, being they don't have any doors). Instead, I don't see this business lasting very much longer if their business continues this way. Good luck Sammy's!",7AENCr56ijU5oOmNSbWljw,2,0,1,XTz2vqoDphLn3jQtW87dGQ
3135475,2014-07-06,5,oYPpWHgsjcIt-tUzGXk_eA,"7/5/2014  4:15 PM  Saw a Yelp review from Brandon (yesterday July 4th) & figured they were OPEN! They were OPEN alright.. The doors were WIDE open, no bug screens, lady on the phone was sweeping with a broom used on the interior of the establishment. Then sweeps the garage out the back door that was propped open. Uses the same broom on the concrete outside... NO HEALTH GRADE POSTED.  My boyfriend having worked in the food industry in the past takes one look at it & says, ""if you feel like getting sick, SURE! Let's go"".  I figured it was like the one on E. Tropicana... NO. The one on Tropicana makes this place look amazing.

Now we get to the front and I'm still being optimistic.  She's still sweeping & sees us standing there patiently waiting.  She gets off the phone, I smile ask her how are you.  Just being my usual friendly self. She hands us a menu that's greasy... Gross.  Boyfriend takes one look at it & says, ""Nothing looks appealing on this menu but I guess I'll try the wings"".  She tells us there's no wings.. Okay then I'll just stick to my original order of Pastrami Chili Cheese fries (I've had them once at the other location, strangely delicious despite the weird idea).

She tells me the total is $13 and some change for a large order of Pastrami Chili Cheese fries. I said that's fine, hand her my card. She never once asked for my ID when it's written on the back (instead of my name just in case it's ever stolen).  I usually hand them my ID if they need to compare signatures.

Here's what breaks my optimism.  She opens the freezer, turns the cold water on the faucet, doesn't use the soap dispenser in reach. I guess to her she ""washes"" her hands in the cold water & grabs the paper towels to dry off.  I then with a disgusted look on my face, asked her, ""do you have SOAP back there?"", eyeing in the direction of the empty soap dispenser on the wall.  She turns to me and says, ""EH? Soap? YEAH Yeah"", then DIPS HER HANDS IN THE SECOND SINK WITH STANDING WATER.  ""See I wash, there's soap"".  My face went from disgusted to HORRIFIED, one of my biggest PHOBIAS is standing water. My stomach turned & flopped a few times as she continues to ""wash"" up.

She asks me, ""want me to cancel?"", I replied ""YES"".  She hands my credit card back to me (I'm shocked I even got it back, I would of never known).  She tells me, ""Okay, no charge"". We walked back to the car & left.

INSTEAD we went to Roberto's in Spring Valley. Cross streets Rainbow & Sunset.  We spent about the same amount as they were charging here.  MINUS all the health code violations & they had an A grade posted as we walked in.

I first tried their pastrami sandwich so that I can get a sample of their product. All good in the hood! Pastrami on a steak roll pretty much got me hooked. Next I sampled their pastrami burger and went big with the dual patties. DAMN SUN!?! I think they sprinkle crack on it before serving this thing.

Pastrami & Burgers offers a variety of options for such a small place. The outside is nothing pretty to look at but sometimes it is those places that surprise you. There is a small seating area near a walk up window if you want to enjoy your food outside. There are easy to read menus along the building of the drive-thru it is just hard deciding what to try from it. 

My man had to try the ""L.A Style Pastrami"". It was a BIG hit! It has pastrami, mustard and pickles on a sub style roll. They have 3 different sizes with the extra large being $12.99! I wouldn't recommend the extra large unless you plan to share with somebody or plan to have more then 1 meal out of it because he got the large at $9.69 and it was almost too much pastrami. Not that he complained or didn't finish every bite because he did! The guy at the window said the bad for you fried foods were all hand breaded and that they use fresh ingredients and I was craving something I could dip in ranch so I chose the ""Variety Platter"" at $7.99. I picked battered zucchini slices, fried mushrooms and fried mozzarella sticks. The zucchini was the best part! It really wasn't greasy and had great flavor. The fried mushrooms were good but I can't say I would order them again. The mozzarella sticks were perfect. The batter tasted good and the cheese wasn't rubbery like most places it was really stringy and super good. The ranch was thick and creamy. I really like this place and will be back regularly. 

There is plenty of options for burgers or chicken sandwiches. They also have a philly cheese steak that looks like it would be good. The menu says their shakes are made with ""thrifty"" ice cream. The ""Garlic Romano Fries"" are on my radar for next time.

Originally wanted to go to lunch at BC but, since we came an hour before their opening we decided to have ""appetizers"" at this spot. 
Homies would talk about this place and how great it was so, really wanted to give it a SAMPS (try).

For a hole-in-an-(outside)-wall, this place had a ridiculously big menu!
They had appetizers, hot dogs, sandwiches, burgers, homemade lemonade(S), and even ""menu sized"" starters.
And when I mean ""menu sized,"" I think they had 1/2 lbs of rib eye in their fries...YES, in their fries. I couldn't believe...just the thought...OMG!

I didn't wanna ruin my appetite too much so, I shared the italian sausage hot dog. 
There was so much peppers, onions, and cheese on it that I couldn't even see the italian sausage itself. And it came with some kind of dipping sauce (au jus).
My friend took the 1st bite and was blown away. Me, on the other hand, am not a fan of hot dogs or italian sausage but, my 1st bite blew me away!
The sausage was so flavorful and it tasted more like a pizza than a hot dog. And I LOVE PIZZA!!!!

After that initial bite, I wanted to order my own dog...but, knowing me...I know I wouldn't have an appetite for BC.

It was a beautiful, cool, and sunny day in LV so, it did seem like LA when we were eating under their umbrellas! Then I figured why they call it ""LA-style...""

- Pastrami melt (Russian dressing on this is the winner)
- Pastrami burger (""How am I supposed to eat this?"" said my husband as he looked at the Dagwood sized burger.  He reluctantly got a fork and knife, feeling like less of man for having to resort to this!)

- Split Decision (Pastrami AND corned beef)

THE GOOD: My sandwich tasted great. The crispy chicken patty was crisp on the outside but juicy on the inside; fried to perfection. The fries were cooked well with just the right amount of seasoning. 

THE NOT SO GOOD: The SPICY chicken sandwich lacked any spice what so ever. As good as the sandwich was, I was in the mood for something spicy. This was a bit of a let down for me. Also, the bottom on my food container was cover in what I believe to be buffalo sauce (didn't taste spicy so I'm quite sure). This made the bottom bun on my sandwich soggy.

I tried to explain to her but she wasn't buying it! I didn't even want to argue because I was already late! If it was my money and food I literally would have just left on the spot!

36 minutes later ( I kid you not ) my food was done 3 burgers and fries. I might as well have gone to a restaurant not a damn food truck...

Ohhhh in addition, the inside was FILTHY!! And I guy came in and dropped off some hot dog buns from food for less on the floor! 

The food was alright, however I bit into the burger, I know what comfort and junk food is... But this was like a heart attack waiting to happen. I bite into it and I literally gulped oil and oil dropped everywhere, I must have bitten into an oil pocket or something... Whatever it was alright, the burger. Maybe I was so disgusted with the horrible customer service it made the food nasty as hell. Oh and in addition for this ""fresh"" meal and soggy oily buns, and 90 percent ice lemonade....

I used to live right around the corner from here for 5 years and never went because my son doesn't like pastrami..go figure the 1 NYer who doesn't. Between my pal in NY posting pics on FB of Grey's Papaya and the Bobby Flay vs. Pink's hot dog throwdown, I was craving a good NYC style dirty dog.  

After looking at the menu and seeing the NY dog with Sabbret's onion in red sauce was on there..we jumped in our hoopty and scooted to Sammies.  

I have to say the only thing that kept them a 4**** instead of a 5***** was the drive though window.  

Additionally my son had never had authentic NY style custard either (deprived since we moved to Vegas when he was 2) so he was eager to try the shakes.  He will never go back to ice cream again. 

Our 1st order was the NY Dog & the Bacon dog (he's a boy, 'nuff said).  Delicious!!  the only thing and perhaps because they are not NYers..is they put the toppings on backwards.  Kraut first then onion sauce so it can run down through the kraut and get mixed in.  by the 2nd dog, they were educated. LMAO. 
the 2nd time we skipped the drive thru and went straight for the window.  
How can you possibly put a ""Big ASS bacon cheese burger"" on the menu and not expect a foodie to try it?  he did..was a tad overwhelmed and truly paid for it the next day consuming 3 large bottles of aquafina. 
...then we went back for the 3rd day in a row.  
oh no..not content with just their delicious and authentic hot dogs.  
We had to try their Chipotle burger & a gyro.  Both perfection.  No more chain burger places for us..worth the drive from the Lakes to lower Spring Valley for such good food.

4260550,2015-10-21,1,oYPpWHgsjcIt-tUzGXk_eA,"The difference with this location (vs. E. Tropicana---AGT's Piff went to that one!), is, there is no seating inside, all of it is outside, with big umbrellas shading from the hot Las Vegas sun (unusually hot October). We had a certificate from Restaurant.com (Get $10 off a $20 purchase) and finally used it two weekends ago. We got the large size Pastrami sandwich and regular order of Ranch Fries. We can say that we've been to both locations now. 

We got here sort of early, so we didn't have a long wait like the rest of the customers who came after us (there is a drive-thru window). We chose the biggest table which is near the order window and the park bench for waiting customers. The single cook (aka. busy girl--- the poor dear had three other customers at the window, and someone in the drive-thru by the time we left) made our lunch really yummy- Pastrami Sandwich and Ranch Fries (really flavorful, not greasy, though). Our son, who is currently on this Super-Picky-Eater phase, likes the fries a whole lot.

This is not a place to watch what you eat, rather, a place to indulge (but that's ok). Two days a week, I can do that (the other five, I'm  on a restricted diet). So, I really enjoyed the Pastrami sandwich (lean meat, so very important) which was really cheesy (I love cheese) and finally the bread was soft but firm (not the fall-apart sort that can get annoying and messy). One of my favorite things to eat is a sandwich (during the week, I can only eat half of one for lunch with my salad). So, without a doubt, this is an excellent place for Pastrami Sandwiches (and my hubby's favorite, to date). 

It's not cheap (the couple after us spent $31 without coupons or promos), but you really get quality pastrami here (this is worth it, it's worth it to spend on things that really matter). Like I said, get on www.restaurant.com and get those certificates (only good for this location), or if you are an Entertainment Book junkie, I think there are coupons in there, too. Since we have more certs to use, we will be back!",fiGqQ7pIGKyZ9G0RqWLMpg,4,2,5,ugO0b-cYqRIYXcOF5zFbag

I went with the BBQ Bacon Burger. The first bite just put a smile on my face. Unlike other places that puts tons of ingredients on their burger to make it taste better, you can actually taste the onion rings, saut√©ed onions, and most importantly the beef patties. This place doesn't even use wagyu beef like Bachi Burger and its even comparable to it in terms of taste. If this place was to use wagyu beef, there would be a puddle of drool under me!

I also got the garlic romano fries. This was great. Even the small was too much fries for me. Very crispy and fresh fries, with a good kick garlic taste. The only thing that could have been better is if there was some dipping sauce (not ketchup) to go with the fries.

Service was good and bad. The good was I asked for some water, but the  person working there forgot it. I asked again, and he gave me bottled watter free of charge. Yay, especially when its 104 and I'm eating outside.  Lastly, I know its hot outside, but please wipe off your sweat or wear a bandanna before serving customers. When I see this much sweat on a person in the restaurant biz serving my food, it gets me nervous that the sweat will drip into my food. I can add salt to my own food.

Some of the food can be messy like the burger I got and the garlic fries will leave a strong stench in your mouth. Might be a good idea to dine solo for these reasons!

At this particular location, there is a outside walk up window and a few outdoor tables when the weather permits.  On this occasion, the Las Vegas winds decided that we were eating in our car!

The Husband went for the original - The L.A. Pastrami ""Our famous Pastrami, mustard & pickles on a steak roll."" (Large $8.99)  This is one super large sandwich and really should not be consumed by just one person.  They steamed the pastrami before giving it to us and therefore, the bread was a bit soggy from all the pastrami sitting on it.  It sat open faced and really is a crazy thing to get into your mouth.  The Husband really enjoyed the thin slices of beef, whereas I prefer the thicker grizzlier slices served elsewhere.  I also prefer my bread more on the crustier end than the soft side.

We also shared their signature fries - Garlic Romano (Med. $3.99).  We really enjoyed their fries, and I would be willing to drive there just for the fries.  They are thin, so much crispier based on the outer to inner ratio.  Initially, I was skeptical since I saw the guy sprinkle the fries with the seasoning and thought that was all there was to their fries.  But it's really the thinness that makes them more unique.

It's a pretty huge menu - tons of really bad food that I'm sure will contribute to a rising blood pressure and cholesterol level.  Nonetheless, one must indulge every now and then.  I want to check out their chili cheese fries next.

This was really good although I must say I wasn't all that impressed with the quality of the burger itself. I may have to try it on a different sandwich though because this one was way more italian beef than burger. My girlfriend ordered the steak sandwich and she seemed pleased. The standout for us was the Sweet Potato Fries... easily some of the best sweet potato fries I have ever had. Especially when they came out hot to us. We also ordered a medium Strawberry Lemonade which was nice and refreshing.

Downfall for me is price vs quality. As with many places I felt that the quality of the food could have been a little better considering the price.

Total meal was about $27. That's one burger, one steak sandwich, fries and one drink. A bit steep if you ask me. For almost the same price we could have gone to Bachi Burger and gotten a much better quality meat in my burger. 

However, the staff was friendly, the food came out hot and the don't get me wrong... it was good! When I say the food quality could have been better I am not saying that it tasted bad!

Tender and lots of flavor...not the best I've had, but a solid pastrami!  We tried the traditional pastrami sandwich and the pastrami burger.  I really liked the combination of pastrami and beef on the burger...yum!  Wish the burger was more medium though instead of well done...wish they would have asked or me remembering to specify.  4/5 for both.  Check em out :

However...

Upon asking where I should try my FIRST pastrami sandwich (ever.  Yes, I know), my fiance brought me here to Sammy's as it was recommended by no less than 10 of our friends. 

Confession time: I'm not a fan of pork products.  I've only recently started eating prosciutto, and a little bit of pork loin, so I wasn't sure if I'd like pastrami or not.  

Fella ordered the pastrami sandwich, and was very very sad when the lady behind the counter said she was out of pickles.  Apparently this is a travesty, and he almost didn't want to order it anymore.  

I ordered the regular sized gyro, with no tomato, promising my fella I'd try a bit of his sammich. 

The food was prepared while we waited, and then we took it home, not wanting to sit outside on a hot day.

The pastrami was HUGE.  So big, in fact, my fella had a hard time finishing it, and he's got an appetite.  He loved it, and I tried some and liked it.  I couldn't eat a whole sandwich on my own, but it was definitely good.  

My gyro was amazing. Flavorful, packed with gyro meat, and dripping with tzatziki sauce!  Delicious. 

I'd go back for a gyro any time!

I plan to go back again soon, I hear their garlic fries are to die for.",renPzRDqMZpMaHiCD_e1_A,2,2,4,EkffKVkWpyKmYRRYnj0Gpg

It's all your favorites from ball parks, amusement parks, that snack bar at your neighborhood pool growing up, and then some! It has a drive-through and a picnic table area for outdoor dining. 

The food:
*Tons and tons of hot dogs with every topping you'd ever want. Chicago got me onto the celery salt bandwagon so I was happy to find I could get my hotdog here just how I like it (mustard and celery salt only, please!). The fiance loves the chili cheese dog and we both enjoy the honey beer batered corn dog. Dogs start out at $2.25 or so. 
*Garlic romano fries - skinny and crisp and delish
*Tons of shakes made to order. We like ours with banana and oreo even though the guy working there makes fun of us for the weird combo.

My friend and I shared the LA pastrami sandwich and an order of bacon cheddar fries. The sandwich was over flowing with meat and caused me a mild heart attack. It slipped down my throat and clotted the arteries. That is an experience I was happy to experience. The fries were just okay. The bacon would have been better if they came in bits form and crispy. The cheese came in the right amount. I did enjoy the fries themselves. Maybe next time forgo the extra toppings and go with the classic. 

The gentleman and his mom were very attentive. They would poke their heads out to check on us often. I wasn't sure if we were suppose to approach them when we were ready for sandwich and sat there for some time. He came out and apologized and rushed it out.

It's super salty and the pastrami sandwich actually has bacon mixed in with the pastrami.  Normally I'm all for bacon, but it didn't bring anything to the party.  It (bacon) wasn't crisp, didn't have a great flavor and the sandwich probably would have been better without it.  

My comrads weren't happy about how long it took to get the food.  I didn't mind relaxing outside in the sun, but there ended up being A LOT of people waiting for their orders so if you're dying of hunger, best to go some place else.

Oh Sammy baby...what has happened to you?

I had been bragging to my boyfriend who is a big fan of anything Pastrami so we finally had the time to stop by and get our grub on...eh hem I mean attempt to.

We walk up and place our order for two LA style pastrami sandwiches, order of garlic fries and a large soda. He says $30 dollars as I am handing him my two for one coupon he says ""ugh"" then says OK $20 dollars. Yes I shit you not he actually groaned ""UGH"" after presenting him with their coupon.

Anyhow, I have a bad feeling from the start. This guy is sweating buckets, he is blinded by the sweat in his eyes that he drops our cup on the dirty ground and picks it up and fills it. Wow! He hands us our drink and says 20 minutes. 

He did not bother washing his hands after just handling our money as he begins throwing stuff on the grill for the order that is before ours.This guy clearly did not want to be here working that is for sure!

We go and stand on the side of the building where the door to the kitchen is open, bad mistake as my bf started to add up all of the health violations. 

I was embarrassed as my experience picking up food here previously was a world of difference. Where was the mature sweet couple who was smiles behind the counter at? The people that were so full of life and excited to explain and suggest menu items? They are a thing of the past I suppose? :(

I swear we waited 10 minutes and still our order had not been started and at that point all I could think of was how bad this guy needs a shower and how I will throw up if I see him touch my food with his bare hands after seeing him break health code upon health code violation.

The kitchen was disgusting and not once did we see this guy wash his hands. His behavior was odd as well, he clearly was angered at having to work it seemed as he was slamming stuff around in the kitchen. 

We waited...waited...waited....and then I was to the point of just flat out disgusted so I walked right up to him and said I would like my money back as we have decided not to dine here. He said ""how much you give me""? I replied 20.00 he reached into his pocket and gave me 20.00 and that was that nothing else said. He actually seemed happy that he did not have to bother with making our order.

The end...

What a disappointment, not sure if they sold the business or what however I can tell you this is the beginning of the end for them if this keeps up!

I will never be back in fact you could not pay me to come back to this hot mess of a once great operation!!!

The food isn't bad, per se, but it wasn't good enough to where I HAD to come back again.  The food was way overpriced and the portions weren't big enough to justify the prices.  We got a sandwich each, each got a shake, and shared garlic fries and the bill came out to $36?!?!?  There are mom and pops burger joints in SoCal that offer the same things for a fraction of the price.  Seriously??? Nothing new here...

The guy behind the counter was the only person running the joint due to a coworker being out on an injury and I give him major props for being personable and hospitable despite being busy by himself.  Thus, 3 stars for going above and beyond in customer service. But otherwise, honestly, I'd rather eat at The Hat back in SoCal.

5918928,2011-04-15,2,oYPpWHgsjcIt-tUzGXk_eA,"Went to Sammy's LA Pastrami after work with a coworker, as he wanted to try this place out based on mostly positive feedbacks on Yelp.  I have driven past this place for awhile, but just never had the urge to try food served out of basically a shack in the strip mall.

Anyway, when we arrived, there were a few patrons there already and also a lady in line in front of us that highly recommends the Cherry Frozen Lemonade.  So we each order one to try for ourselves (I went with the Strawberry and my coworker got the Pomegranate), I didn't think the Strawberry flavor one I ordered was any good, but his Pomegranate flavor one was good.

For food I went with the Pastrami Burger (single patty), and he ordered the Pastrami Fries.  The burger itself was just okay, and the pastrami was lacking in flavor for a place that features it on the name of the restaurant.  The Pastrami Fries comes with what I considered pretty good fries, but the lackluster pastrami kind of killed it for me.  In the end the consensus we agreed upon is that the food here is better than most fast food restaurants, but it is below most diners.

Seatings is outdoors under the umbrella, which is fine when the weather is not super hot like right now, but I can't imagine hanging out too long under the hot sun during the summer.

So I like to give it 2.5 stars, but that is still not an option, but just a 2 stars would be too low.  So generously rounding up Sammy's LA Pastrami gets a 3 stars from me.  But I doubt I would be back for anything other than the occasional Pomegranate Frozen Lemonade, which I know I can make easily at home with just a quick trip to the supermarket.",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,5,2,3,qoIpobkeUGboIzWI5ooABA
