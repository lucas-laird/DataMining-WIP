Looked up the nearest pho place from the strip on my phone and wah-lah! We arrived at Da Lat.

Hands down, best pho I have had. And this is coming from someone who lives twenty minutes away from Westminster.

My special favorite is how they grill the meat and shrimp to perfection where the fat melt off just enough and is slightly crunchy to the tongue and yet is completely tender that you can just bite if off without really needing a steak knife.

The staff are always friendly and helpful, and their prices are incredible.  For just an extra dollar or two you can get tasty high qualify restaurant prepared food here compared to how much you would have to pay for a combo meal at any fast food chains.

The Pho itself was pretty decent, it's not the highest quality of pho, but it gets the job done if you're really craving. The broth was pretty good; the only thing that lacked quality is their noodles and their beef. Aside from that, it's alright.

As for their boba, I ordered the golden milk tea and it was good. The boba was good but the quality of the milk tea seemed a bit too heavy. My friend ordered the passion fruit tea and his drink was mediocre but the passion fruit was really overwhelming. It started to get better after the ice melted and watered it down a bit.

Looking back, I should've ordered a pho. We only ended up eating the shank and noodles. Somewhere between finding this restaurant on Yelp and ordering our food, we missed the memo about the suspicious meat.

I recently treated my parents on a trip to Vegas and on day 5, we were tired of eating greasy strip food. Seriously craving some Asian comfort food, I chose this place for a late breakfast based on the great reviews. SO GLAD we ventured here! The restaurant is small, but there are enough tables for patrons to dine comfortably. During our meal here, there was a rotating amount of customers and they gradually got busier towards lunch time. The server is super friendly, patiently describing all their specialties to us, serving us with a smile, and even telling us of other great local places to check out.

First of all, there's a Yelp offer for TWO free fried spring rolls - claim it! Secondly, they have a deal for buy two bubble teas and get a third free. This will cost you $8.50 for three LARGE teas. Get this too!  I tried both the Thai tea and Thai green tea -- both delish!

On to the food! We ordered the following:
-Pho Dac Biet
-Combo Vermicelli 
-Bun Mam

Everything was so delicious!! My dish was the pho and it was soooo cheap (under $10) for a huge bowl FULL of meat. Like, there was so much food I shared two small bowls of it with my parents and still struggled to finish it. I also tried my mom's combo vermicelli and the pork and shrimp are busting with that freshly grilled taste. The free Yelp spring rolls I mentioned earlier? Homemade, full of taro, so good! They do not skimp on ingredients or quality here. 

This was hands-down one of my best meals in Vegas outside of the strip...ever. Really, really great place - don't hesitate to try it!",YMYb73K3Dv3oiac4mADJSg,6,4,5,Yt0pxlxdaRM6_gX1kfZjnA

Whomever cooks here is very gifted and it's easy to see why this place was packed at lunch on a week day.

We enjoyed the following:

Appetizers:

Fried Egg Rolls - Hot, Crispy, filled w/ Shredded Pork. Served w/ a side of Fish sauce.


Entrees:

Banh Xeo (Half Moon Crepe) - Vietnamese Crepe filled w/ Shrimp, Beef, Scallions, Bean Sprouts & Fish sauce. On the side it was accompanied by a garnish tray w/ Carrots, Radishes, Thai Basil & Lettuce Wraps to combine all of the ingredients in one mouthful. 
This was HUGE! I loved everything about it but it was somewhat messy to eat. 

Pho Dac Biet (Special Beef Combination Soup) - This included Meatball, Tripe, Tendon, Rare & Well Cooked Beef along with Vermicelli Noodles in Beef broth. Served alongside were garnishes of Jalapeno Peppers, Bean Sprouts, Thai Basil & Lime. The flavors were smoky, beefy, and rich. This Pho was absolutlely stellar.


Com Bo Cuon Tom (Shrimp Wrapped In Beef) - An elegant and delicous little Vietnamese Surf & Turf combo served w/ steamed White Rice, Cucumbers, Tomatoes & Lettuce.


Everything we ordered was at least very, very good while the Pho Dac Biet and Banh Xeo were amazing.

1432137,2014-06-16,7,iRwT2pBa87Y54q8nqfNAzw,"Here is an interesting piece about Da Lat. When I first moved here to Las Vegas, after driving for 3 days and over 2000 miles, Da Lat was the first restaurant I ever ate at in this fare city. I thought it was one of the best pho's I've ever had, and ever since then, it has always been in my top 3.

Over the next several years, I've had the opportunity to come back here on several occasions. The Vietnamese crepe, bun bo hue, and every other items that I've tried were some of the best that I've ever had!

Well, I came here the other day wanting to recreate some of my past experiences here. I noticed on yelp that they have new hours, and they are open until 4am, when they used to close a lot earlier. And I came in at 2am. When I walked in, I noticed that they had done a complete makeover of the place. It had turned into a more sleek and modern vibe, rather than the previous mom n' pop feel. The waiter told me that even though the restaurant went through a renovation, the owners are still the same owners.

After scanning their menu I noticed that the prices are still the same, which is good because I thought Da Lat always gave great value for what you got. But, it looks like they have taken their awesome crepe off the menu.. Darn!! So I decided to go with the pho.

Combo beef pho - the broth is still as good as I remember, you can taste the beef flavor as well as the spices commonly used in a good broth. The meatballs and brisket was good and plentiful. I can't remember if there is any rare beef that is supposed to come with the combo, but I didn't receive any and I don't have a menu with me to check.

So here is the big reason that this is not a 5 star review. They brought out the traditional accompaniments for the pho; bean sprouts, Thai basil, and sliced jalapeños. The bean sprouts were turning brown, limp, slightly slimy and smelled off. The basil was dried up. And, the jalapeños had a dried up as well, noticing the white on the outside. I made the mistake of adding these items to my great soup, and it ruined everything. I've never had this problem before, but I usually have come in at earlier times, when the husband and wife are in the kitchen...

I would come back here, but probably at an earlier time. I don't know who is working the menu at late-night, but they need to be trained on what is acceptable and not acceptable to send out to the customers. Oh, and bring back the crepe!!",gtwM4ijo65AN4DvXdgCu_w,12,11,3,778ssHINmiWRbL1UGrRVCA

In my opinion this IS friggin NOT the BEST pho in Vegas..Cmon now fellow Yelpers,

I look to you guys with blind faith to give me the inside scoop and head's up about the best places to try or worse places to avoid. This place falls somewhere in the middle ground.

First off the pho is Meh ok. definately not the ""Best pho I've had in Vegas!"" as some yelpers write and also the restaurant itself is pretty ""ghetto"" for lack of a better word. 

Pretty small restaurant and the big question is ""Does this place even have a Restroom?""

It was really crowded in this tiny restaurant and there were several tables not cleaned off yet. The poor cashier/waitress was overwhelmed and had to go back twice to ask for help out front.

I got pho with rare beef (pho tai) as my main dish. It didn't take that long to come out and tasted pretty good. Seemed to be a lot of soup and not as much noodles as I would like though. The beef quality was pretty ok. The bean sprouts, mint, etc. were a bit sparse. 

Compared to other places (I'm from SoCal so I have eaten at lots of pho places), for what I got and location/look of the restaurant, I'd say this place was priced about $1-2 too high for their dishes. The bowl of pho I got was super basic and was $7. However, they did have $1 off offer w/ a text so that was cool too. It was a basic place for very basic pho.

If you check in on yelp you will get an order of their fried rolls. Since it's free it tastes even better! Lol! But we tried their spring rolls and even this came out fresh and the shrimps were actually there! And tasty!

What's better is that I don't have to travel all the way to Spring Mt. for this little hole in the wall gem of a pho place! 

We started with the spring rolls... which were huge!  You get the typical 2 pieces cut in half and each piece was the size of a full piece you would normally get at other places.   .. they were fresh and super good.

Me and my husband decided that we should each order something different to share... and my choice was the Bang canh seafood I think it was... with extra cilantro... they did not skimp on the fillings.  There was plenty of seafood and just the right amount of noodles.  The broth was delicious, and the best part was I didn't to add so much to get flavor.  The broth was full of flavor!

I checked in on Yelp which gave me 2 free rolls, but there were four of us total so they gave us 4 rolls instead of just 2, it was very nice of the server to do that. 

None of us felt like eating Pho so 3 of us tried the broken rice (com tam) with suong, cha, and bi. The grilled meat was delicious, the flavors were great. However, the cha was terrible, it was very watery and loose, melts in your mouth but not in the good way, and tasted very bland. I love to eat cha when I eat com tam so I was very disappointed in the cha. Bi was average, nothing impressive. My mom tried the hu tieu and was not impressed either.

Bot chien trung was really tasty and a great appetizer to share with others.

Bo tai chanh was not bad. I wish it had a little more flavor to it (maybe the first time I had it was so good so my expectations for it now was a little high)

I know that doesn't mean much to you if you're reading this and you're not from Southern California but what it does mean, is that I have access to some really frickin' good Pho places all within a few square miles. 

Anyway, I'm in Las Vegas for the holiday weekend. My luck, there are passing thunderstorms thru the valley which means I'm in the mood for some type of soup dish. Ramen or Pho. Ramen lost.

The place wasn't too bad - small little hole in the wall joint not too far from the strip. Not walking distance but still not that far. 

The service was OK. The girls, yes plural were friendly enough. Very helpful but forgetful. I had to ask them to remove a Thai Ice Tea that I ordered but never received. They were genuinely apologetic which was nice.

The food wasn't too bad either. I ordered the Dac Biet as I like ""the works"" when I have Pho. The broth was flavorful. The noodles were consistent and the additional ingredients were plentiful. The only thing - the price was more than I'm used to paying for the portion size I was given.

2641315,2014-08-20,9,iRwT2pBa87Y54q8nqfNAzw,"(TL;DR - After hours eating can be limited and sometimes disastrous. Luckily it doesn't have to be, with Vietnamese gems like this place that's open until 4am! Coming from a Vietnamese chick, the Vietnamese food (for late night) is good! Plus, they have a full boba, milk tea, smoothie, dessert drink menu! (The boba isn't good, but the drinks are promising!)

My boyfriend and I got here at 3:30am. There was a nice gentleman from Greece that came out from behind the kitchen and seated us - we wondered if this was a Greek owned and run Vietnamese restaurant? That would be a special experience! But then we saw that the chef was in fact Vietnamese and we learned that the owner is also Vietnamese and interestingly enough, he actually supplies a lot of the boba shops (not clear on which ones) on Spring Mountain with their boba supplies.  

Our server had a very, very strong accent, but that didn't cause any real problems, we just needed to clarify a few times with him and it was all good. We checked in on yelp and received the free 2 egg-rolls - they came out freshly fried, very crispy and not oily which is great! It's full of meat filling, but more on the dry and bland side. I'm not hating though, it's free! 

Here's what we ordered:

Spicy Lemongrass Chicken - Yum! The first bite reminded me of the comforting Vietnamese home cooking I grew up with, from my mom and my grandmother. I can really taste the refreshing and bright flavor of fresh lemongrass and a hint of coconut milk and that makes me so happy! Also, the coconut milk helps create the ideal consistency for the bold, sweet and savory sauce (it's not spicy in our opinion.) Luckily it was extra saucy (and bossy), they don't skimp on it at all.

Ardie Y. said it best, ""Mash the rice in there and soak it all up."" - Words of a wise man! That's right, get it all-up-in-there! It's just the right sized portion to share between 2, plus it's under $9? That's a great value. 

Minor annoyances: 
- I had an issue with how dry the rice was. It seems like it was sitting in the rice cooker since the early morning, so the rice grains were dried out and hard. 
- The chicken cuts were weird, it wasn't all tender white meat, there were pieces of chewy cartilage here and there and cut into awkward oblong shapes (yup it's edible), but just not what I personally prefer in my stir-fried chicken dishes. Hey, don't let that sway you, the flavor of the sauce totally makes up for it - it's delicious! Plus it seems like they made it with great uniform cuts of chicken on Ardie Y.'s and Shawn H.'s visit. 

I was drawn to their gigantic chalk board of drinks! What really caught my eye from their expansive drink/boba/slushy/smoothie menu was the sea cream (!!!) iced black tea or green tea! We have that all over the place at boba shops in CA and it's my ultimate favorite, but this was the first time I've ever saw it offered here in Vegas! I couldn't contain my excitement to try it! Unfortunately, I wasn't able to try it this evening. Our server explained kindly to us that he is still new and he hasn't been trained to make that drink yet, so it won't taste good. Lol. I'll be honest, I was disappointed at first, but I can't be too mad at him - he was honest and a very nice hard working fellow, so I can totally understand.

We decided on the sesame milk tea with honey boba. It's beautiful to look at, plus I loved how many crushed sesame seeds I saw floating around in the drink and the flavor was rich, very nutty. The seeds did cause the texture of the drink to be gritty and it would tickle my throat a few times if I drank it too fast, plus the little seeds got stuck all in my teeth the majority of the time, but hey, I didn't mind it! I wasn't trying to impress anyone anyways at 3:30am. My boyfriend and I enjoy weird and unique textures, plus it's something different, so it was right up our alley. 

The milk tea was tasty as well. It didn't taste like powder and it had just the right amount of sweetness. I would strongly urge you to get a milk tea, or even a smoothie without any boba. The boba was sitting precooked (not sure for how long) in a container and the consistency wasn't desirable, they were a bit stale with firm boba and mushy boba. 

They also have a nice little selection of traditional Vietnamese deserts! 
- Che 3 mau (three color drink) $3.95
- Che thai (fruit with milk) $4.50
- Suong sau nuoc dua (grass jelly) $3.50
- Rau cau dua (coconut jelly) $3.50

So I turned to my trusty Yelp community and chose Da Lat for my next trip to Sin City. The perfect hangover cure, I thought!

So on Saturday morning, after a night of boozing and schmoozing, my friends and I hopped in my car and drove the 3 miles to Da Lat expecting a refreshing bowl of noodle soup. One of my friends opted for the Subway next door and brought her foot long club sandwich over to Da Lat to join us. She had finished it before we even received our Pho.

Reviews on here made it sound like a crazy, busy place so I was worried that we would have to wait in line forever. Luckily, when we arrived it was nearly empty except for one group of 8. We sat down and a very nice, young, teenage girl took our drink orders. She returned quickly with our drinks and took our food orders.

We ordered fresh spring rolls to share, fried rice to share and each of us ordered a large bowl of Pho. I also ordered an iced Thai tea. The tea and spring rolls arrived quickly. The tea had a funny taste (more than usual) so I only choked down half of it. The spring rolls were delicious and very fresh. We devoured them. Then the fried rice came out and I took a chance and ate it. I didn't feel sick afterward so it must be GF safe. The rice was VERY salty and greasy. Good fried rice will always be greasy but it doesn't have to be salty. On the plus side, it was loaded with different veggies and meats. The salty rice filled us up and we were slowing down and getting tired by the time our Pho arrived.

My friend's Pho arrived about 5 minutes prior to mine. Presumably because my broth had to be hotter for the rare beef. The bowls were MASSIVE. I always order the biggest Pho a place has, but these were just crazy. Each of us finished about 1/8 of it before the salt caught up to us. The add-ins that were given weren't as varied or abundant as many places I have been, but they still did the job. The broth was probably the oiliest I have ever had. The entire surface was covered in oil droplets. Not appetizing. Regardless of its appearance, it still hit the spot and we went home for our MSG induced nap. I awoke and ate the remainder of my Pho. Somehow it was better at room temperature. 

I am not giving this place 5 stars because the teenage girls who served us did not wear their hair in ponytails and it looked like they had just rolled out of bed. I understand that it is a small, family restaurant but a little bit of hygiene goes a long way. I don't want to think about hair flipping in my food every time I watch the server rush back to the kitchen. I can only imagine the cleanliness level of the cooks.",FpTuy9U92NKcr9YI__TT1g,3,1,4,pMMk3JZ-ZT5CXA_FyWyiZg

We ordered 3 Small Combo Beef Special Pho, 1 Large Brisket Pho, and Eggrolls as an appetizer.

The eggrolls arrived and there was nothing special. The eggrolls just came with lettuce. There were no mints, pickled carrots/radishes, and cilantro. I was extremely disappointed. But, I was super hungry and ate it anyway.

The Pho is just OKAY. I added a bunch of sauce to make my Pho taste just right. There was plenty of meat and it filled me up.

The Bill came and I saw the Eggrolls were charged at $5.25. On the menu, the price was $3.50. I asked the waitress about the price, and she said it cost extra for lettuce. I was kind of annoyed that she didn't let me know ahead of time. Therefore, this incident ruined my experience at Da Lat and I won't be going back. Sorry!

The menu isn't as extensive as the Vietnamese restaurants I'm used to in San Diego. I ended up getting a rice dish and thought it was pretty good.

Pho is supposed to be fast. Just ladle that soup broth over the noodles and meat and you're fricking done. Right? NO, NOT HERE.

My friend ordered spring rolls, which were 2 tiny rolls cut in half. That took a good 40 minutes to make. (BTW, there were barely any other customers, so it's not like they were busy making other food!)

The rest of us ordered pho, which took nearly an hour for it to come out. We would've bounced the fuck outta there if we didn't feel so bad for doing so. So we just stayed because we were hungry and waited that long already.

When we finally got our food, it wasn't even that good! The broth was piping hot, which was nice...but that's probably what they were doing this whole time...boiling the soup. My friend mentioned that they ""forgot the flavor."" Yup, the broth had little to no flavor. Plus, my rare steak tasted sour, which meant it was probably old and should not be eaten!

And Da Lat is the perfect and convenient haven to alleviate that nasty headache of yours.

My friends and I woke up from an epic night out in Vegas, and upon getting up, my friend instantly requested pho. Finding Da Lat was actually a bit of a challenge, since it's hidden in a plaza and it's a small family owned restaurant. But lemme say... it's worth the troubles!
The food was absolutely flavorful and delicious! The food took a really long time to come out, which was quite torturous. It was weird that the pho came out last, since it's usually the first. 

Some highlights:
- Their raw meat appetizer was pretty good. Interesting... since it's my first time trying it.
- Got a dry noodle dish but switched out the noodles with rice. Yay! The waitress was so nice about it!
- Waitress was really friendly and quick on her feet
- The pho you order comes with a lot of meat (huge tendons!)
- Apparently they ran out of some type of meat for my friend's Bun Bo Hue, but replaced it with other goodies and more meat
- everything was gooood AND cheap!
- they accept credit cards! A+!
- be prepared to wait awhile for your food though..

My only disappointment is that their rice dishes are smaller than other Vietnamese restaurants, but I'm not complaining since the deliciousness made up for it. I got the chicken, eggroll, salad combo... eggrolls were seriously baby-sized... and I ate every single grain of rice since the portions were pretty small. Oh well.

Came here when my friends and I were craving for Vietnamese food. I got Bun Dan Biet. It is dried vermicelli with grilled pork, grilled shrimp and two spring rolls. Their spring roll was probably the worst one I've had. It super doughy and thick. Fillings were bland. Grilled shrimp was fresh and huge. Grilled pork was also great with BBQ flavors.

Bún w/ egg rolls and BBQ pork ($8.10) -- excellent, silky-smooth noodles; thin, tender, sweet and savory pork; good, but small egg rolls. The dish could have used more veggies, as there wasn't enough cucumbers and no carrots that I could spot; a few sprouts and some mint rounded out the dish.

The place isn't too big and is located in a small plaza a bit further away from the strip. We checked-in to get the free eggrolls, I ordered the bun bo hue, and my wife ordered pho tai. The bun bo hue was pretty good - they put a lot of good stuff in it (pork blood, pork leg, flank, etc). My wife thought her pho broth wasn't as flavorful as she's used to. The eggrolls were OK. I also ordered a lemon soda... it wasn't very soda-ey though. My wife noticed the server running around trying to find the ingredients to make it. She said that, at one point, he pulled some Mountain Dew out of the fridge and asked someone in the back (in Mandarin) if he could use that to make it. Apparently, the cooks in the back seemed to understand Mandarin and speak Cantonese. Not sure if Vietnamese is even their first language (there was another Vietnamese couple who had to ask the server ""Do you speak Vietnamese?"" and proceeded to speak to him in English).

I was surprised at the prices - more expensive than the pho places in Irvine! I guess that's the price you pay in Vegas, and for some late-night eateries. They had a sign on the wall saying something along the lines of ""Pho...the best food for a hangover"" - nice...

Like most good Asian spots, the service is definitely sub-par as we were left finding our own table, grabbing our own menus and left unattended to for the first 5-10 minutes when there was nobody out in the front. But, the food definitely satisfied my cravings.

My first impression was that their nem nuong was surprisingly good. I've found very few places around town that even serves nem nuong so it was a nice that they had it here. The sauce was quite flavorful and my fiancé commented that it was even better than Brodard's (blasphemy!). The combo pho seemed small, but there was a generous helping of noodles and meat. I was surprised by how much meat there actually was as I quickly became full. If you're looking for a rice dish, the 5 item combo with rice came with delicious barbecued pork, chicken, beef, and a couple shrimp with an egg roll. Overall, a good find and will definitely be coming back.

We ordered 20 egg rolls for a party for $25 cash at the end and they packed it nicely for us.

They have happy hour food and drink specials. You can get a chicken pho (pho ga) for $4.95. If you order two Thai tea based drinks, you can get he third free. My husband was so excited about the leas than five dollar pho, haha! 

Their pho is huge! The amount of chicken was decent but they really threw a lot of noodles in there. I added a side of brisket, which came in it's own broth. The broth had a richness to it, so it is oily and a bit salty but delicious and the way I like my broths to be. 

My Thai tea with no boba was strong, sweet and creamy. I liked the sealed lids to really mix it around.

Their pho isn't even all that great yet they somehow draw hordes of people every time we've stopped by. 

We whipped out trusty Yelp and stumbled upon Da Lat. We were a bit apprehensive because of the size of the place. We were hoping we'd avoid the wait since we were catching dinner a little later at night. Luckily, there was only one other party there and we were immediately seated at a table. The place is very small and intimate. There could be another party sitting at the furthest point of the restaurant but you could still probably hear everything they're saying. 

You can make your own pho combination for $6.50 a pop (regular bowl). This actually got me pretty excited only because they offer tendon and tripe as opposed to Pho Kim Long. I decided on getting the meatballs, tendon and tripe. The wait was kind of long but that's because I'm super spoiled by all the pho places in OC/LA. The trimmings were dismal. I got 1.5 pieces of meatballs, 2 pieces of tendon and some tripe. You get a lot of the noodles but I was really disappointed with the amount of ""meat"" you get.

There was only one other person eating in this small restaurant when I came in about 5:15 PM.  I was shown to a two top near the kitchen doors.  I was surprised how bright and modern the place was.  I expected it to be like some of the other places in the area, small mom and pop places that have a lot of wear and tear.

With the Yelp check in, you get two free egg rolls.  However, I wanted spring rolls so I let the free ones go to order the spring rolls.  I also ordered a combo pho which the menu describes as their pho bomb soup with beef meatballs, tripe, rare beef, well cooked beef and tendon.  The woman who served me soon brought a bottle of water and a cup.  I needed that later.

First up were the spring rolls.  They were good.  The peanut sauce didn't have a rich peanut flavor but it was OK.

Soon the soup came and it was very hot with steam rising from the large bowl.  Before putting any of the vegetables in it, I tasted the broth and it was nice and rich with beef flavor.  The rare beef was rare and there were a number of meatball pieces visible.  The broth also had some spice.  The pho also had some cilantro, white onion slices, and some scallion pieces.  

I tore the spicy Thai basil in pieces and added it to the pho along with all the jalapeño slices, and half of the bean sprouts.  I added some of their house hot sauce to give the broth more kick.  Now I was ready for my eyes to water as I ate this good soup.  I finished the bowl by picking it up and dumping the last into my mouth.  I didn't want to leave any behind.  The meatball slices were very good, the tripe was tasty but few in pieces, and the rare beef was rare.  The tendon was--well tendon.

I had an expired Groupon and this through my server.  She ended up calling her boss and they told her, I'm assuming, to take it at its face value not the double value which is what's supposed to be done.  When the check came, it totaled $4 and some cents.  I paid and left knowing that I have to eat more pho during these cold months.

Dà Lat is a solid place to go for pho and I'll be back to try some of their rice dishes.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,4,4,3,RwcSwkJjH4Ld960tn097nQ

They include generous amounts of meat with their soups.
The bun rieu even had real crab, not just the kind from the can. I could tell because there was a whole crab claw in the soup.

No, but it was probably the best pho I've had around here yet. It still doesn't quite measure up to San Jose or SoCal, but it was pretty satisfying. They even provided ample amounts of the Asian basil, sliced lime, and bean sprouts that you'd expect. The broth was heavy on the anise though.

However, I did experience some of the service issues that are prevalent in other reviews. For one, the lady in front didn't move to take our order or otherwise mention that we might have to wait or walk up to the register. I went ahead and did the latter. The subsequent wait for the food felt pretty lengthy - maybe in the vicinity of 15 minutes? To be fair, apparently they were filling some sort of giant to-go order in the back before we had arrived, but they've gotta be able to churn out pho faster if that's one of their mainstays.

Other than that, $12 was pretty darn pricey for my large (xe lua) bowl. But I guess they're all overpriced around here, and this is a reasonable quick fix for a homesick California boy.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,3,1,4,UvwQMpWaeGcCtTCF4wl1oQ

My friends and I came here for a late dinner after attending Rise Lantern Festival. This place was nearby our Airbnb and seem to have good reviews so we decided to give it a try. There were people there but it wasn't a packed house. There was 9 of us & we were seated right away once we got there (we had to split the party though) and given menus and then everything went downhill from there. 

There was one guy working the dining area. After he sat us down and gave us the menus, we didn't see him for over 10 minutes. I flagged him down to let him know we're ready to order and he says he has to finish cleaning a table so he can seat 2 people that were waiting. So we were fine with that. When he came for our order we ordered 4 bowls of pho (2 pho tai and 2 pho dac biet) and 1 bo luc lac rice dish. After he took our order, we did not see our food for 40 FREAKIN MINUTES! I have never waited 40 minutes EVER in my life for a bowl of pho. Which by the way was TASTELESS and had NO FLAVOR. Such a disappointing bowl of pho I have ever had. 

And to make things worse. Before we even got our food, the table that he was cleaning for the couple had gotten their food first before we did!! That made us so mad because we were already waiting for over 30 minutes and this couple that came after us got their food before we did??!! WHAT THE EFF!! So I flagged the waiter down & told him that we were here before the table that has their food and he said it's because they ordered something with fishballs and they had to make that first because it's takes long. Which was a lie! Because the other half of our party sat next to that table and they said they just got pho. And even if they did get something with fishballs, why would they even get their food first before we do?! 

At first we tried to be understanding because we noticed that a lady came in and gotten a huge takeout order so that was probably what was taking the food so long to come out. But when we saw that another table that came 10 minutes after we did get their food first, UNACCEPTABLE!

There was also no tripe in the pho dac biet and it states on the menu that there is tripe in that pho bowl. 

If I didn't come with a big party and with people that were exhausted and super hungry then I would have just walked out. 

Save your money and go elsewhere because even if we didn't go through that hell of getting our food and waiting forever, I would still not come back because the pho was not even good at all. I don't get why everyone is saying the pho is so good and flavorful. I must've came on a really crappy night then because after all the waiting we went through, the pho was very disappointing.",q7Es2ojyDdEj541y0TSXXg,3,1,1,xVtEFbuh6NK_k49rqOL_4g

Bun dac biet (Combo Vermicelli) - plenty of meat, 2 egg rolls and the ngoc mum was great.

Banh Mi Dac Biet - big enough to share, tasted ok as the bread felt and tasted a little stale.

2 Special chicken pho - soup tasted clean, but the chicken was over cooked.

Com dac biet 5 Mon (5 items, grilled pork, chicken, egg roll, shrimp, and Chinese sausage) - kids loved it.

Bot chien - first time and probably our last. It's just fried eggs with crispy.noodle cake.

Wrong weekend to crave Pho indeed because all the Pho places I'm familiar with in Vegas were jammed packed. 

This place is the definition of hole in the wall. My kitchen in Vietnam was bigger than this place. But to find a nice diamond, you have to dig through all the coal. 

Hands down the best Com Tam (broken rice bbq dishes) in Las Vegas. You want to stick with the pork chop. Moist, tender, smoky and beautifully charred marbling. The rice is soft and buttery. The egg rolls have this taro meat combination that is quintessentially Vietnam. 

The Pho is definitely top notch. The slightly oily broth has this homemade feel to it that only people who have actually made Pho at home can understand. Fresh Pho will have these floating oil micelles because it hasn't been strained over and over and over like typical Pho places. This type of Pho will sing to some and scare others. I'm a native, so this type of Pho holds dear to my heart. 

Conclusion:
Everything is fresh and HOT! Yes HOT! I can't stress enough that temperature is key in Vietnamese cooking. Every dish that is cooked with fire needs to be served HOT! Steamy! This is the only place in Vegas that has that concept down. I just wish the decor is nicer; then I can bring my friends.

There were only 2 other parties dining and the rest of the tables were dirty with empty plates.  I sat down at a table for two against the wall.  The server apologized and wiped the table down.  She handed me a menu.

I ordered the Beef Short Ribs and the Vietnamese Egg Rolls.  The 4 fried Egg Rolls came out in less than 10 minutes.  There were about 5 large crisp lettuce leaves piled on the plate for garnish.  I ate them with the sauce as a salad.

When the server brought out my Beef Short Ribs, she couldn't get to my table due to the customers' chairs back to back and they couldn't scoot in.  The server had to reach over a customer's shoulder and hand me the plate.  I was blocked in both directions.

There were about 3-4 strips of thick tender Beef Short Ribs and a big scoop of rice.  The cucumber and tomato garnish were sparse.  I was given a sharp steak knife to cut my meat.  The meat was very good.

There were still dirty dishes on tables all around me.  Every time new customers would walk in, the server would move the dirty dishes to another table rather than get the cart and clear the dishes.  One party came in and walked out after not being seated at a clean table.

Customers were taking soup spoons off other tables because their suppy on their table was empty.  They were also putting their empty plates on other dirty tables because their plates were not being cleared.

I felt sorry for this young girl.  I know she was trying her hardest.  The computer was down and she had trouble verifying my Groupon.  She also had to ring up the bill by hand.  It took over an HOUR to get my bill.  Even when I finally got her attention for the bill, she continued to take new orders and not bring me my bill.

This was a very popular place.  They were not hurting for business.  Customers were all speaking their native tongue.  I'm not sure if every one was Vietnamese.  The food was quite good.  The service, or actually lack of service SUCKED!!!

I think the bathroom was through the double kitchen doors.  I saw some customers walk in the kitchen and then back to their table.

This place was introduced from a buddy, Davis Duong (master yelper), he chose this place because it had the highest rating on yelp...figures. The place had great parking (lots of spots) and was very average in size, it could probably fit about 25 people max? 

The price for the pho was around $7. Now the portion wise, it was pretty decent. It doesnt compare to the OC/Westminster/Garden Grove money-proportion, but for Vegas, it was pretty good. The food was delicious, didnt seem like it had too much MSG (usually i knock out from food coma after a bowl). The soup wasnt too heavy, and the noodles werent too soft and mushy. My favorite part of the bowl was the meat...the meat tasted especially good here for some reason. Even though I only had one bowl, when I really wanted 2, this place is my favorite so far in Las Vegas, Nevada.

Great Service, the lady who worked at the cash register even told me that a lot of customers found out about this place from yelp.

This review is an average of all 4 times, usually my food comes cold. Which makes sense for the spring rolls (duh), but not my pork and spring rolls. 
However. The last time I got the wrong order and everything tasted different. Idk if they changed the recipe for the shrimp and pork rolls, but it was super fishy, VERY chewy, and the peanut sauce was super watery. I also ordered the same dish as always... but I got the combination beef pho instead... instead of pork vermicelli. Because this was delivery, I really couldn't do anything about it. Also, for pho, the carpaccio comes raw (that's how carpaccio is supposed to come) but it was bleeding into my other meats, and the broth wasn't hot enough to fully cook the beef, so I had to put it on the stove to reheat it. I rarely eat beef so my stomach was upset. 

Please make sure you are sending out the right orders when delivering. I can't exactly turn to my server and say, l didn't order this.

I think I know why because its conveniently located not too far from the strip.  The people that have left reviews must of came here when they were either done partying, or coming here the morning after.  Pho always tastes good after a good night of partying, so the reviews are mostly for pho. 

I didn't do pho since it was a hot day, and I like to get my pho from a particular restaurant anyway.  I did the grilled chicken vermicelli and got my 2 cute little egg rolls that came complimentary for checking in on Yelp.  

When we walked in, most tables were occupied.  We couldn't sit down right away because the restaurant had lots of dirty dishes still on a lot of the tables.

Da Lat is a no frills Vietnamese restaurant. The decor is sparse to non-existent. As soon as you enter, you are welcomed and directed to a table. Tony T is right - there is only room in there for about 34 people (I counted the chairs). The service is very quick. I always go for the combination pho whenever I'm at a new Vietnamese place. The lady brought out my water quickly, took my order quickly, and before I knew it, my bowl of pho arrived at my table.

The first thing I noticed was that the soup was piping hot. I went straight in and tried the broth before adding any hot sauce. It was bursting with flavor and felt very full-bodied (for lack of a better term). I like how they have the homemade chili sauce as opposed to just Sriracha. I put in a spoonful of that and went to town. My T is right. In addition to being piping hot, the soup has a certain oiliness to it and this was also evident in some of the meat. It's something that I neither loved nor hated. It was just there. I did enjoy the pieces of tendon and the tripe. The tendon was very, dare I say, tender.

Overall, it was a highly enjoyable bowl of pho. I rank it towards the top on the list of places I've tried in Vegas. Based on the soup, the quick and friendly service, and the place's simple charm, I'm inclined to give it 4.5 stars and generously round that up to 5.",YwaKGmRNnSa3R3N4Hf9jLw,5,4,5,QtF0SmE583FpT8BF5YZzKA

I came there wanting to try their bot chien but sadly they ran out that day. Oh well maybe next time. Everything we ordered hit the spot. Delicious & flavorful.

It was actually good too . 

SERVICE: 2/5
The only reason why I gave 4 stars is cuz service was just the typical azn service. They weren't rude or anything. Was just slow & not as attentive as I'd like when it wasn't even that busy while we were there. There were a couple other customers there when we first got there but midway thru our meal, we were the the only ones left. Oh well I'm used to the azn service. 

DECOR: 1/5
They could work on the ambience a lil bit. There was a shelf behind the register that was all empty. Decorate guys! I was confused thinking whether they're getting ready to shut down the place or not. Hope not cuz I like their food.

A friend and I ordered Pho and a noddle soup along with some chicken wings. The soups were tasty and a little bit on a sweet side, and you can definitely detected MSG taste in the broth. The chicken wings were a little bit salty when eating by itself, it would be great if there's some veggie to munch along with it. 

By the time I was done eating, I got headache and my mouth dried up, which confirmed the MSG suspicion. The headache lasted through the next morning. I can handle a little MSG, but not when they use lot lot lot of it. 

The restaurant itself is clean and people working there are very friendly. The parents run the kitchen and the daughter works up front. She was very friendly and attentive, which is a huge plus.

Upon being seated, we were offered the menu, but the server seemed so confused all the time. Every time someone would want to order something, he'd have to go check about something with the dish. It was really weird! He also tried schooling me on what kind of noodle dishes were what and the herbs to eat with it. Honey, I'm Vietnamese. I know what to eat with my food and what's supposed to be in the dishes. I guess my proper pronunciation of everything didn't give my ethnicity away? It was just an awkward vibe all around. I ended up with Bun Bo Hue, which they no longer serve with the pork blood cubes! Womp womp. I was really looking forward to that. My beau ordered the Pho Tai with Bo Vien (meatballs).

I asked my cousin for a great recommendation and she suggested this place.  I knew this place was close to Marbella where I've visited before.  Since we were downtown, this seemed like a good choice. 

The place is a small, cozy location.  Two columns of tables, no more than 4 rows of tables deep.  There are laminated pictures of the menu and other pictures on the wall, made it seem very cheap.  There's a server stand in the back, however, it seems too high and cluttered.  The server was patient with our family which goes a long way in my books.  She allowed us to bring in alcohol from the nearby liquor store, as long as we had the receipt.  

What really turned me off was the bathroom situation.  They directed me to the back of the kitchen.  You literally had to walk through the kitchen, while the cooks were preparing food in order to get to the bathrooms.  What was worst was someone was already in there.  I had to wait outside the bathroom, in the kitchen, with the cook.  OMG.  When I got in, it was cluttered with supplies. 


Aside from that, here's what we got for our meals:

Grilled pork chops for $7.50:  Marinated grilled chops, served with a scoop of rice and tomatoes and cucumbers.  The pork chops were sweet and although the chops were a little on the thin side, it was still juicy.  

Special combination beef pho for $7.50:  Beef noodle soup with a combination of beef meatballs, beef slices and tendons.  Served with sprouts and basil on the side.  This soup is super flavorful and they give a lot!  Noodles were soft and plentiful :)

As you can see, the food is very inexpensive.  It's actually super flavorful and probably will bring me back if I'm in the area.  I don't necessarily think I would go out of my way to come back.

The waiter at the counter ignored me, so i went up to tell him that i needed a table for four. we waited 15 minutes, another party of 3 comes in. after one table leaves, they wait FOREVER to clear the table, but the waiter was going to seat the party of 3 first before my family! NO YOU DON'T! Needless to say, I got my table. 

We sat down and I told the waitress that we didn't need the menu as we already know what we want. She replies, ""you still have to wait"", and walks away. 

10minutes later, she comes back to take our order. 

So it took 20minutes for two pho sate and one mien ga (clear noodle chicken soup) to come. It took 30 minutes for a pho combination to come!!!! I've NEVER waited more than 10minutes for a pho. The porportions have shrunk, the food saltier and more oily. Found some bugs in my soup too.  the chicken in my clear noodle chicken soup was so tough--worst than jerky (like it's been refridgerated for weeks). The mints for the pho were all wilted (like reused veggies),

While we were waiting, I was able to witness how inefficient and unsanitary these people were. the waitress at the counter (the same who took our order) was preparing ice water--She actually stuck her entire hand into a pitcher of water to remove a big junk of ice. Then when she poured some ice on the counter, she picked it up with her hands and placed it back into the pitcher. GROSS! Then we witnessed a mother and son party come in, they waited 15minutes, but instead of sitting them when a table was ready, they sat a table of 3 that just came in. The mother and son approached them and all they said was sorry, can you wait a little longer??? When she got piss and left, they just smiled and said, ""have a nice day"". Idiots!

Is it so hard to have a waiting list? They had plenty of cooks in the kitchen, why did it take forever for the food to come (it's not even cuisine food!) The food has declined drastically and the portion shrunken, not to mention how unsanitary things are. The service is SLOWER than before--there is absolutely no organization.

We ordered: 

Free eggrolls with check - in (2 of them) was pretty tasty. They don't give you herbs and all that like a full order but give you a lettuce leaf for each which was nice since I prefer cha gio with greens. 

Pho with rare steak and beef ball - they ended up giving us brisket, not rare steak and beef ball was like a beef ball, cut up into small pieces. The broth was just okay, the noodles a bit too soft for me as my chop sticks were breaking them too easily, well done brisket is okay for me, but the BF least favorite thing so he just ate noodles and I ate some of the meat. 

BBQ pork rice with casserole and shredded pork - they ended up giving me BBQ pork with eggrolls and shrimp instead. It was decent seasoning on the pork and eggrolls are good  Since we got the free eggrolls though it was redundant in a way. 

The food took a long while to get to the table and then it was wrong. I was tired so I did not want to send it back. Service was okay. It was weird in ways like she kept trying to give the BF room temperature water because he ordered hot tea, but she gave me ice water. I kinda get her though process, but other than that odd attentive detail service wasn't attentive as we would like on top of the kitchen not paying attention at all to the order. We ordered with the name and the number and I point to menus by habit so that it is not written wrong so I don't think it was a issue of being heard wrong unless the server of course really is a ree and still didn't write it right. 

Just a note that there is not a ""public restroom"". I guess maybe you can use their restroom inside the kitchen? Maybe?.... I didn't know places were allowed to be restaurants without bathrooms that are accessible to guests. I like to eat eggrolls with hands and wrap lettuce, I had to cut it up and it was hard to shred my basil with a fork because I couldn't wash my hands. 

It's a irritating experience with average food. I will go back to my regular late night pho spot.

We woke up this morning crazing egg rolls, but none of our regular places were open until 11. 
Morgan pulled up his trusty Yelp App (someday he'll write an actual review, I promise) and found Da Lat.  

Oddly enough, I had just seen Da Lat last night on the way to a movie, and had wondered about the place.  
They had decent enough reviews, so we headed over. 

We got there right at 9:30 when they opened.  
Let me tell you, I was really impressed.  The inside is super clean, bright, and very nice.  

Service was polite, and pretty quick, too.  

We ordered:
The 2 free egg rolls with Yelp check in:  DA-licious! (see what I did there? lol)  Meaty, piping hot, put together really well.   AND, their fish sauce doesn't smell like death, which is a plus.

The fried quail:  OMG.  I've never had quail meat before, only eggs.  I liked the flavor a lot.  The meat was similar to duck: delicious, juicy, tender...

The Pho Noodle Soup with Rare steak:  Best pho I've had in a long time.  The noodles were perfect: a nice chew to them, not mushy at all.  The steak was delicious and plentiful.  Most places only give you a couple little slices of steak...there was a lot in this bowl.  Oh, and the bowl was enormous!  The broth was flavorful and hearty.  

I can't wait to come back again.
My phone was dead, hence no check in for me (we used Morgan's) and no pictures, because his camera was broken, but I will post some next time for sure.",renPzRDqMZpMaHiCD_e1_A,2,4,4,dGD1NkyTbmCa0FpBwBhy4A

I work late nights and used to be able to pick up on my way home from work when I lived nearby. Sadly I live in bfe now and have a later schedule so I haven't been able to have it in a while. I've been to Pho Kim Long, Pho Saigon, Jenni Pho, WtPho and Pho Annie and no place compares. The last time my bf an i went we were greeted warmly and chit chatted while waiting for the to-go order (I'm never a fan of making a server work when it's 30 mins to close) and we learned it's a 3 generation family recipe.
I'm vegetarian and bf is not, so fair review from both sides. Nowhere in this whole city has vegetarian broth that isn't somewhat bland, and their beef broth is so clear and fragrant that it doesn't even make me wrinkle my nose from the beef smell (nearly impossible). I always feel great after eating it, and the portions are big enough for me to have some later. I generally eat healthy, green stuff and this is one place where I can actually FEEL the quality of ingredient and recipe in my body after I eat it.

Walking in around 10AM, the place had one other large group of girls and a single male patron dining at the time. There was also just one waiter. This guy really needed some help. Service was very slow. He took orders, made all the drinks himself, handled checks and payment, and delivered the food. Not sure how many kitchen staff there were either, but food service was also very slow. At other Vietnamese restaurants, pho noodle soups often come out faster than they could fry up egg rolls, but here at Da Lat, I felt like we were waiting a long time for our noodle soups.

Despite the slow service, the pho tasted delicious. The noodles were firm and chewy, while the soup was flavorful and not too oily. Each bowl came with a good amount of meat and the vegetables were fresh.

I jumped on Yelp to check out Viet diners other than the normal spots.  I bumped into a place called Da Lat, liddat lol.  The place had good reviews and was worth a shot since we were close by.  

Upon entry, the place was a small mom and pop joint, which I like, and was 4/5 full, a good sign I thought.  The menu offered a lot of the same in addition to some traditional dishes.  

I went with the sate pho and pork skin summer rolls.  I had a craving for Brodards rolls from Westminster, Cali, but was not expecting this to even come close.  I was looking for Mì Quang, but did not find it on the menu.  Its pretty hard to locate this dish unless its homemade.

As the food arrived, which was pretty quick, I instantly regret my decision.  The sate I was thinking of was more of a garlic oily broth that was still soupy, however, I got something that was more stewy.  I was the only one to blame for this and won't factor it into my review.  Although the rolls were plain and tastless.  It would help if they added that one little fried strip of roll wrapping to add some texture, but no joy.

I heard others saying that the place wasn't all that while eating pho, but I would have to try it for myself to make that determination.  Otherwise, my lady got the Bún Thit Nuong, hard not to get this right.  She didn't say it was anything to get naked and go streaking over though.

l can only assume that the reviews are likely based on late night pho fixes.  At a drunken stooper, almost anything is good and will have an after taste of bourbon (or whatever you drink).  They didn't have my soda hot ga (club soda with condensed milk and a raw egg), which was factored in this review.

By the way, I added a pic of the banner that read, ""the best hangover...what the pho,"" I shit you not.  That earned them an additional star, otherwise it would be a two star experience.",ewDNa_FRoG71UFm56eTGkw,3,0,3,qU5WhuraLaRLwEeBfonYBA

After every bite, I wanted more.  Came in on Sunday for a late dinner and tried their bun rieu.  Absolutely the best one I've ever tasted, besides my sister's homemade one.  We also got pho to go for my 8 y.o son, who's a picky eater.  He ate all his portions and asked for more the next day.  Got another take out of pho Monday.  We will definitely come back next year for more pho.

I've had a chance to try a few of their soups: bun bo hue, pho, bun rieu. All of which were so rich with flavor, like they had been cooking it for days. I savor the broth of each of these traditional dishes. The hardest part about ordering, is narrowing down which one I'll get. I have yet to be disappointed by any dish that I've tried. I really wish I lived nearby. I would love to come during the day as they serve a  a few traditional Vietnamese items such as banh cot up until 6pm. 

If you like coconut, top off your meal with the coconut jelly, it tastes exactly like a fresh coconut in jelly form. So delicious.

I also had the raw beef topped with nuts, salad, and lime juice.  It was ok, but at $6.75 it was a pretty good bargain too.  The last plate I ordered was this shrimp and beef salad and I barely ate it.  First off, this dish did not look appetizing at all!!  I figured maybe it tasted better than it looked, but it turned out to be really bland and extremely lacking any flavor whatsoever.  Moreover, the salad was basically the same salad that was served on top of the raw beef.  I felt like I dished out another $6.75 for a side of more salad.  I would not recommend the salad.

The environment is just like any quick service sit down restaurant.  It was well lit, relatively clean, and sorta cramped.  It's not a big restaurant.  Service was friendly enough.  

Overall, this place was ok.  I think it's worth paying a visit if you love spring rolls.  I would like to come back and try some of their rice dishes and pho, but until then I still prefer pho kim long as my go to joint for Vietnamese food.",ywI6YzxkoKyKC2JV4_19Sg,0,0,3,tSdWXQPvIGZsSMTtfwhtWA

On my most recent visit, I was sadly disappointed by the decrease in quality of the pho. My first time here was summer of 2013, and it was deee-licious. But I came again about a year later, and it was just not the same. Broth is too sweet and meat is less tender. The plus side is you can customize your bowl of pho to have whatever type of meat you want in it! Wish they had that option for all pho places haha. 

To my surprise, it was renovated and the inside became much more modern and clean. The seats have been updated to cushiony sofa like chairs with a bright red color. Tables are a sleek black, much better than the old ones.

So I went and told them I had a groupon. They asked me for the coupon and no issue at all. It was one waiter in the place and he was actually very on top of his job. He made sure that I was doing okay and had everything I needed. 

However, I just wasn't feeling the place. I was quickly reminded once I started eating why I never came back.

special combo pho with extra tendon - The noodles were just too soft. Way too soft, I felt like they were extra soft for a child or senior citizen. That is the best way I can explain it. The broth wasn't bad,  but it just had this flavor to it that I wasn't fond of. 

papaya salad -  I don't know what I was expecting but this wasn't it. It was just plain shredded papaya mixed with shredded carrots and sliced shrimp. They served it with shrimp crackers and the server just told me to use the fish sauce at the table. But I wasn't sure how to use the nuoc cham with it. So I never finished it. I did eat the shrimp crackers though.

pork sausage patty roll - probably the best thing I ate. Or maybe not. The sausage looked a little under cooked. Other than that, it was pretty tasty. 

So in the end, I really wanted to give this place a two but it wasn't horrible. I just didn't care for it. So this should be like a 2.5

It's a pretty small place so if you come with a big group it just might be a little crowded. The restroom is back in the kitchen. Just a little uncomfortable for me.",U0WU9d6gpMNkO_tPXK58Sg,7,5,3,C4-dJFvSm5CxFWReRwMhPg
5918776,2010-11-12,2,iRwT2pBa87Y54q8nqfNAzw,"This is a really small Vietnamese restaurant run and operated by mostly the members of a Vietnamese family.  The dad works in the kitchen, the daughters work the front (waitress, busser, cashier).  Counting the number of seats available, the capacity is probably 34 at the most.

The menu is full of pictures to help you with ordering, if you are not familiar with Vietnamese food.  The price is pretty reasonable, not the cheapest and probably not the most expensive by off-Strip Vietnamese restaurant standards.Most items are under $10.

Their Chicken Wings (comes with 3) is pretty good. It has nice flavor and has crispy exterior.  It is served with some salt and pepper, which you are supposed to squeeze some lime juice to form a very traditional Vietnamese condiment.  I think the chicken is good on its own, but the salty citrus flavor gives it a new depth of flavor.

I also tried their combination pho on this visit.  The broth was good, on the mild flavor side, but not greasy (I like that!).  The tendons that was in my bowl was very soft, indication that it was simmered for hours to get that nice texture.  The herbs and bean sprouts served with the pho is also very very fresh. It is just a minor detail, but it is all of the little things done right that makes something as pedestrian as pho to be elevated to the next level.  Gotta love that.

And I was told by one of my friend that this little restaurant is considered the best Vietnamese restaurant in Las Vegas by other Vietnamese!  And after trying some of their food, I can see why.

I asked for extra jalapenos as usual but didn't need them--the broth was plenty spicy and kicked my butt. Some greens and sliced scallions were floating in there, nice quality meat if a bit stingy.

We thought why not try this restaurant since it had a 4 star rating.  We were wrong !!!  We came in and were seating promptly, but we never had a server again to take our order until 10 minutes later.  We had to flag the server down to take order even though the restaurant was not at all busy.
The menu items we wanted to order half was not available.  No coconut !  They sold more than 1000 Groupons, I expected them to be ready for a crowd.  There was another item on the menu that I ordered was not available, but I forgot what it was.  Anyway, we ordered four items:    egg rolls (soaked in old oil), Vietnamese chicken noodle soup ( had a strong sesame taste, which kill the flavor of any chicken), beef noodle soup, which was fine, and a rice dish with pork meatloaf, shredded pork, and charbroiled pork ( never came until half an hour later that we reminded them that we were missing a dish). 
There were 2 servers  with around 10 tables in the restaurant.  They have to serve, make drinks from scratch, buss tables, bring out the order, etc.  Now when new guests came in I had to tell them that ""you have new guests coming in,"" that was when I knew this restaurant was way unorganized.  I could feel that other guests were disappointed too.  Most guests had to wait so long for order taken.  
The decor of this restaurant filled with sceneries from Vietnam, could have filled with lots of photos from Da Lat.  We had to literally walked through the restaurant kitchen to get to the restroom (filled with cleaning chemicals and open electrical outlet).
