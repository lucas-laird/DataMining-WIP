We ordered a Vietnamese pork dish and some Beef Chow Fun along with a starter order of fried egg rolls. The food was just okay, nothing that blew my mind. The Thai tea was actually my favorite part because they served it layered. However, the egg rolls were pretty disappointing. They seemed really greasy, the serving size was four but they only came with two small leaves of lettuce to wrap all four in. Additionally when I picked up my lettuce leaf, there was a little black spider attached to it. At that point, I didnt want mine anymore. My boyfriend squished the spider and he said he thought it would have just smashed but it had a hard outter shell. 

Needless to say, as much as I wanted to like this place... I will not be returning. Food was okay and the spider was off putting on how they store or clean their vegetables.",HpjM1cw7Yo37mykS-9y0Nw,0,0,3,kreEisX-jySDYelOsTDRnw

The beef broth in the pho had a nice, deep flavor. I've been to several local pho restaurants and this one holds up better than them all. I eat at Pho Kim Long regularly because it's 24 hours, but when this place is open, this is where I go. The prices beat any other spot in town, especially at lunch time with some great lunch specials. The staff is courteous and attentive, but not overbearing like you'd expect from a small ""hole in the wall"" restaurant. It certainly doesn't hurt that they're only a few miles from my house, but I've tried several pho places on the eastside of the valley and this one surpasses them all easily. I prefer supporting local, family run business' and this place is definitely that.

This was my second visit for lunch and decided on the chicken Pho bowl. Since the amount of green onion is small I asked for extra and they gave plenty. My first visit I had the rare beef Pho and I did not add any additional spice to it. It was good but I wanted more. So this visit I added some Sriracha to it and what a huge difference. 

Very fresh tasting, side vegs are fresh and it was a great lunch bowl. They used only white meat chicken and I do wish they would use some dark meat also as it adds more flavor. But it's their recipe. The bowl is so large I have yet to finish one. But for $6.95 it is worth the price. 

The staff is friendly, the place is clean, and food is served quick and hot.

Some people may not care about that, but I was eager to leave due to the uncomfortable temperature. When you're ready to pay, go to the counter.",4slxBUw4gqvUpMynoUN6dg,0,0,4,oJuRBNJZhHm9SEJ7fm6R1Q

The were Very friendly but I got to say the food didn't nail it ! I order brisket belly and steak pho for my self and chicken chow mein for my son .... well the broth for my pho wasn't tasty even with the lime the jalapeño and spicy sauce I added to it ... My kid's chicken wasn't cooked all the way  and so I decided not to let him eat it ..... And last thing the pace smells very weird and I suppose is because of the carpet on the hole dinning room.

I called in my order for take out and the owner took my order. He was very polite on the call and gave me a total on the phone. Bonus points for that. He was very confident on the phone that it was going to only take 7 minutes. That make me smile.

When I arrived, parking was plenty and restaurant sign was visible. it is between Salsa Loca (which I've been to) and a tattoo parlor (which I have not or will).  The aroma of fragrant broth filled the space. 

The owner greeted me by my name (which I thought ""how did he know""....but I might have been the only one with a take-out order.) He made sure I have utensils with my order. I ordered A4 2 pc Fried Eggrolls and P1 Special Beef Combination Pho.

Once I got home, I unpacked my dinner and was amazed at how everything was prepared.  The broth was in a stryofoam container/tall bowl with a bag around it.  The Pho veggies (beansprouts, jalapeño, basil and lime) where in a small bag.  The beef/noodles were in a compartmental box.  The noodles were not over cooked and stuck together (another bonus).  The noodle broke up effortlessly once mixed with the broth.  The broth is not overly fatty/oily/salty. The only negative was the fried egg rolls.  They were on a bed of lettuce and the condensation made it not crispy once it got home. Taste great still.

I ordered pho with rare sliced beef and beef balls... and requested it in a larger size. The menu only displays one price, but the server said he can make it into an ""extra large"" bowl for me. I was hoping I'd get proportionately more meat, but I ended up with a large bowl of what seemed like endless rice noodles. TASTE wise, it was fine, but I felt a bit ripped off. 

Interesting to note: there are no containers with fish sauce on the tables... but they have single-use packets for SOY SAUCE. This should've been my first red flag. 

The next problem is that I was craving some traditional Vietnamese coffee, hot. Even the menu has a cute picture of what it's *supposed to look like*... a hot, slow drip. When I put my order in, maybe 45 seconds passed and he brought out a mug with a spoon. He warned me ""It's super super hot and also VERY strong!"" To emphasize how strong he believed it was, he grabbed me a container for sugar and set it next to my cup (something that I did not ask for, but it gets better)...

I tasted it and immediately felt disappointed. One, this wasn't how it's supposed to be served. Two... it tasted almost identical to the Vietnamese instant coffee packets I have at home! Two packets, to be precise. No extra sugar was necessary because I never add sugar when I use my two packets at home.

Maybe I just got my hopes up too much from other Yelp reviews. Is this place terrible? No. (The restroom was well maintained, at least.) But don't go out of your way to come here! I spent a little over $14 and walked out disappointed.",YYTgfKDiTWJ0bx3LuRP9OQ,0,0,2,XiXrEa02oU586q7vvlr-Sg

I feel like they just opened a place to serve food they make at home. They claim to be a Vietnamese and Chinese spot but I didn't see much Chinese except for the fried rices.

It has a typical Vietnamese menu minus the curries. I did however see they offered a beef stew with bread yum.

Basically the food was good, the place was clean, and the service was polite. They could do to stop by the tables more often except to drop food off but I enjoyed all of the staff I encountered. Very sweet and friendly. 

We tried their combo pho $8x 2, a ban mi dac biet $3 and some change, and their spring rolls $3. All came out to $24 and some change. We were stuffed. It was a bargain IMO.

I really liked their sandwich. Their bread was hot, fresh, and crunchy. I've never had one like that. I want to say they didn't put the patte part. I have to say I didn't miss it, and I've been eating those sandwiches since my childhood. At first it looked like they skimped on meat but it was perfect. I loved it.

Their pho was good. It was a good size with a large amount of meat. The broth was good, the noodles were cooked just right, and it was served super hot. The bowl looked below average in size but it was just the right amount. I finished the whole bowl and the broth. 

Their spring rolls were good. The dipping sauce was good. I enjoyed them. 

I have to say for a newer place I thought they did a great job. If they are reading and I could help them improve I'd say to offer straws for their water, get a napkin dispenser for the table if they don't plan to walk by too much, and lastly take their service to the next level. 

Overall I do plan on returning soon. In comparison to a Pho Kim Long, Pho Saigon, or Pho So 1 it is just as good but with the friendly staff you won't find in China Town.

Check them out!",pZ6P_1V-bTSoYG1fg1TXzw,5,2,4,uedIUVq3Xh-otdpZMRIyJg
4108204,2016-11-01,8,0VjHFdczi6Nln_nn8bucJQ,"I finally found a reason not to drive to Spring Mountain for pho.

Pho Bistro is the place that replaced Beijing Noodle Cafe, which was a Chinese restaurant with similarly inexpensive, casual eats. This place has actually been open for almost two years, but I've found reason after reason to keep putting off my first visit, including disbelief that we could have anything good out here and lack of reviews from familiar Yelpers. I ended the procrastination today with a lunch visit.

They offer $5.95 lunch specials daily from 11-3, and it's not just the typical fried rice and whatnot. There are 4 pho options, including vegetarian, beef meatball, chicken, and the Pho Tai that I got with rare sliced beef. The bowl came out quickly and was piping hot, which hints that they have a huge pot going in the back like all good pho restaurants do. Well, that would've been just a guess if I didn't get a spoiler because my seat was in line of sight with the kitchen door. That huge pot on the stove was a giveaway.

But that doesn't matter if it doesn't taste good, and boy was the stock surprisingly delicious. It might be a little too sweet for some, but to me that just means that it plays well with the lime juice that I ended up fully extracting after a careful squeeze into a spoon of broth and a small sip. The pho noodles are pretty standard, and the meat was tender and savory. The Thai basil was fresh, and so were the bean sprouts, which I normally skip but decided to throw into my broth this time. Value-wise, it's a small bowl that works for a lunch portion and is great for the price.

By the way, the lunch special comes with soda or tea. I went with a hot tea, which ended up being a bag of what was labeled as jasmine tea that was allowed to steep in a mug of boiling water. I was expecting a little more jasmine aroma, but it was a nice way to cleanse the palate and get a little caffeine to stave off the food coma.

Pho Bistro is home of my favorite pho east of the Strip, and it should be the first stop for pho if you're on this side of town or if you're in the immediate vicinity. Henderson is pretty mediocre, and there's one spot on Boulder Highway that I still need to look at, but this is probably the go-to place. And this rating could actually rise if their other options are as good and if the pho is consistent. I was gonna try a banh mi sandwich, but I have other dinner plans.

The meal started off well. I ordered the lunch special pho tai and spring rolls.  The rolls ($2.95) had more meat than most places and the sauce seemed to be more hoisin-based rather than peanut-based.  Different than what I expected, but a pleasant surprise.  The lunch special also comes with a small egg drop soup (figured that wouldn't be included since I ordered pho, but it was; a welcome, albeit strange, surprise).  The egg drop soup was also good. Solid egg drop soup with small pieces of carrot and corn added. 

Then the entree came out and my experience took a nose dive. 

Honestly, it's the worst broth I've encountered in Vegas.  When I think of a good bowl of pho, the broth is complex in flavor, and is the star of the dish.  This broth was flat and tasteless.  I'm not sure if it's broth from a packet, or broth that simply didn't get simmered for long enough to develop flavor, but it wasn't good.  It would be more accurate to call it meat water than to refer to it as broth. 

The meat was not as bad as the broth, but still left a lot to be desired. The pho tai (rare beef) had a total of 7 small pieces of beef that, perhaps, were rare at some point, but were not by the time they got to me.  They were somewhat chewy and lacked the flavor you usually get. 

Finally, the noodles...  It seems like this place must put a ball of hard noodles in a bowl, slap some broth on there, throw in some meat and then bring it out immediately.  The noodles were hard and difficult to separate until they had sat for a while.  It's probably just a matter of preference, but I'd rather have waited an extra couple minutes for the food to come out than get the hard ball of noodles that had to sit before eating. 

There are a couple saving graces of this place. First, the prices. The lunch specials are 5.95 and you get an entree, can of pop (Pepsi or diet pepsi), and egg drop soup.  That's a great value.  The spring rolls were also about half the price of other restaurants. And second, the food other than the pho was worthy of a 3 or 4 star rating. 

Unfortunately this place only gets two stars because this is supposed to be a pho restaurant, and the pho was terrible.   Probably won't be back unless I'm desperate.",_w1svBLzB2Z251UdtB090w,2,1,2,dudnVDxWLpEiQ-yJKJQ9xw
