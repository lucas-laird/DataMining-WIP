This place is awsome... Will come again tomorrow to try another menu for dinner tomorrow. Since I can cook korean food pretty well hard to find the korean restaurant to please my appetite.
I have to give the Song's compliments on their dishes...",-fF4ZnuyBSaxVVRxVqZo6w,0,0,5,HQIDYXOcFFCXkPBBcEIRZA

But the Beef I ordered was not properly packaged and the quality of the beef was not the way it should be prepared comparing to the other Korean Restaurant particularly the radish and kimchi...

The food is not the best but it's pretty cheap- I ordered the kimchi stew for $6.99. It comes with three side dishes- bean sprouts, kimchi, & seaweed. I would say it did its job in satisfying my Korean food cravings for sure.",yldXJ9lLG4A4AP5GY6861Q,0,0,3,JQXQjFzAJXWsE54P_B2YBg

For my birthday, I ordered my usually bibim nang myun extra spicy.  They must of changed their recipe.  The food was completely inedible. I'm korean and I couldn't eat my food. It was so spicy,  I thought it was a cruel joke.   When I asked if they could do something to make it less spicy they wanted to charge me more money.   Absolutely, ridiculous!!!

It has 4 mandu, lots of rice cake slices, and the broth, which is more flavorful than at Mother's Korean Grill, is filled with egg, sliced onions, sliced scallions, and shredded meat. A much better meal and much less expensive than Mother's Korean Grill in Chinatown Plaza.",0PjSykzxXt8o98Qrm7P4pA,0,0,4,_uSwfmrf8lLpacbt16aIoA

4019406,2015-12-24,3,2reHgsuAWofHfocfJ4Xs5w,"This place is inside Greenland supermarket food court. 

We ordered ramen, Yu gae jang (spicy soup) and Korean sausage with intestines. They were all good. I like the Korean sausage especially. They were soft and tasty. It's an acquired taste. Don't expect to like them instantly. 

The wait for the food was about 20 minutes or so. I'm guessing it's not pre made. The price is affordable. It was $7 or $8. After you're done, take your tray to the back. It's a good gesture to tip the man clearing all the dishes too. It's optional.",rYGi5DJ_54qeoWkkqB21jA,3,4,4,8PoFREaHA_8C77C3Qhd7zA
4084195,2015-11-08,0,2reHgsuAWofHfocfJ4Xs5w,"If I remember correctly, almost everything on the menu was under $10. We ate here twice and both times were good. It's not the best hahn-sheek (Korean food) ever but for being in a food court and the prices, it's an easy choice. 

We've tried the ah-goo-tahng (monk fish soup) which was spicy hot but not overwhelming and had generous chunks of fish and vegetables. Both the spicy and water naeng-myuhns were very good, especially the water version. 

Their geem-chee was also pretty good; way better than the stuff they served at the soon-doo-boo place in the same food court. The other bahn-chahns were pretty good as well.

We always judge a hahn-gook sheek-dahng (Korean restaurant) by its geem-chee. If a place can get its geem-chee right, then the cook most likely understands the essence of hahn-sheek. The geem-chee here was a solid 3.5/5. The food so far was a solid 4. Relative to the setting and prices, it's 4.5+.

We'll definitely be back to try the other dishes.",_RlWNkoiLYpijlb89V-CyA,0,0,5,sXFrzy_Mg72k4WOpsBHuRA

I hate giving low stars to new places but I just ordered the kimchee dumplings. It was so bland and fell apart that I took it back and told the order taker to try it since she had never tried it, she recommended it. It wasn't worth asking for my money back.

Soon Dae plate was the worst I've ever had. It's freezer burn dried pieces of inedible food. The kimchi soup was way too sweet with 1 piece of pork.

There are numerous small Korean kitchens set up here...most has a little differant meal option or a differant variation of similar dishes. 
SONG's is one of our favorites...
We have not had a bad meal here, the prices are great, most under $10 a plate or combo.

Chicken was dry and chewy and the sauce tasted overly spicy and burned.  Not how it's supposed to taste at all. 
I ended up just eating the bean sprout side dish,  the soup and a little bit of rice.

Soups: Decent Korean soups although the flavor was somewhat thin and rather subdued compared to most authentic restaurants I've been to.  I had high hopes based on the quality of the surrounding restaurants in the food court at Greenland Market. Definitely not bad just not great either.
