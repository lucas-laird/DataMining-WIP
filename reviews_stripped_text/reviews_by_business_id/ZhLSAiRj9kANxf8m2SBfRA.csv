Location - Nice. Off Silverado Ranch and Bermuda, a lot of places near it and a good area of town.

Atmosphere - Cute. It was clean, I enjoyed the setup and the dim lighting

Food - Excellent! There were so many options on the menu it was hard to chose, they also had a vegetarian friendly menu. Huge portions, great value, and the food itself was amazing. Food is spicier than most thai places, they warn you, so make sure you don't get anything over a 3 if you only want mild spice.

Service - Our server was great. Very friendly, helpful and quick. My boyfriend was clearly struggling with his Pad Thai (which was a level 5 spice) but, we weren't going to ask for a new one or complain, but the server offered to make him a new one. It was a very kind gesture.

Will be back!",Ys4rHDpli-IcVXSyspTpmQ,1,0,5,Bsb7aQOIhZ86eEKwwUsQpA

I've been too several Thai places over the years but this one currently tops my list in Vegas. My husband and I go here almost every other week. They are super quick and not just that, Ling Ling is super friendly and she remembers our favorite orders and gets it ready in a jiffy. All the others that work here are super friendly too. Their red curry (with tofu) is by far my favorite although I've tried several others on the menu and like them too. My husband loves all their meat dishes too. Highly recommended especially if you're in a rush and need some place to serve you tasty food, really quick.",xen5W86MUgUdBAjAJ4mSgQ,1,0,5,kTJQFHVDewYENo8HDE44lg

I usually order veggie chow mein and basil fried rice, which when you order through yelp delivery is only 8.95 each. Today I thought I'd save myself money by ordering pick up so I wouldn't have to pay delivery charges. When I get there they tell me my total is 23.95. This is about how much j pay when I get it delivered. The receipt says each item is 10.95 .... when asked they told me it's because they charge extra for veggies when you pick up. Wtf?? This place is such a scam. I was never told the veggies were going to be extra and don't see why it would cost more than if I ordered a regular meat entree. Chicken beef or vegetable doesn't cost extra on your yelp menu and it shouldn't be different just because I'm picking it up in person. Also, I asked for no egg in my fried rice and of course, when I get home there's egg in it. I called and let them know and she tried to tell me I said egg was ok. Egg was not okay and you should know that because YOU'RE the one who asked me if I wanted eggs in it and I said NO.

We usually get green chicken curry and pad see ew noodles with chicken. Can't go wrong with that, but for our latest visit we ordered curry rice and pad Thai. Throwing off the shackles of routine, and breaking out of our food rut! 

Not really, I'm joking. Worked out really well, since we're looking for something a bit lighter than our usual. We ended the night with fried bananas and green tea ice cream - even though we were stuffed. The portion size was a little smaller than we expected, and my wife wasn't a fan of the tiny bit of cream cheese added inside, but like I said I don't think we could've handled much more anyway. There's more than just vanilla ice cream available to go along with it, we got green tea ice cream, so that was a plus.

2nd: they forgot my thai ice tea.

Food wise no doubt it's a good thai place and they deserve a 4 stars in regards to food. I ordered  a Tom GA, spicy basil chicken fried rice and chicken tofu pad see eew. The spice level is on point. I like mine medium heat it just gives  a little kick but still taste all the flavors.

I went and picked up and they were so unbelievably nice and friendly. Not too talkative (I don't want to stand around and chat while my food gets cold) but greeted me and we exchanged a few words. 
 I'm used to the typical eye roll at my usual place. I totally didn't think they were thinking, ""another white girl too lazy to cook for her husband... Again.""


anyway... They were so nice as I drove home I was really hoping to like this place since it was so close and they were so nice. 


They even punched holes in the crab ragoon container so they would not get soggy. 


Their pad Thai was absolutely unbelievably bomb. I'm from Chicago and we have Thai everywhere and so far I have not found anything I really like as much this comes super super close. 


I got a little too spicy and there was definitely a little kick to it but perfect.  You need to order this pronto.

I've been coming to Lucki Thai since I moved onto this side of town, and I have brought almost everyone I know here so that they too can have an exceptional experience. From the moment you walk in the door, you are treated as the most special guest, and the familiar faces there literally know your name and remember your order! (The server Ling is top notch) The atmosphere feels comfortable and the facility is always clean. The consistency of the food between visits is always on point, and you ALWAYS know that your meal will be just as good as it was the last time. The lunch specials are really affordable and they come with salad and egg drop soup. The Shrimp Pad Thai is remarkable, the chicken fried rice is BOMB, the crab fried rice has a whole dang crab sitting on top, the Tom yum soup is exactly what you need if you ever feel under the weather (a level 7 will knock a cold right out of you), and the Spicy Basil is always good. THEY HAVE THE BEST THAI TEA IN ALL OF LAS VEGAS! Honey toast is so good you have to give thanks between bites (I'll literally go there in the summer just for the Honey Toast AND it's my must have for every birthday) and of course the classic sweet sticky rice is to die for!

Tom Yum soup with shrimp - My husband didn't quite enjoy that extra kick, but I loved it. It wasn't like a spicy kick...more like a tangy-ish one? The shrimps were huge!

Pad Thai with shrimp - Really delicious and the portion was pretty generous.

Pad See Ewe with beef - It was good, but my husband said it was slightly burnt tasting. I didn't really catch that though. The dish didn't look burnt so he thinks it was the pan used for cooking the pad see ewe that was.

Dessert: Fried Banana with French vanilla ice cream - OMG, I almost died! It was THAT amazing and I don't even like bananas! The fried banana was nice and hot. The skin was crispy and inside was the oogey gooey banana with some coconut flakes. The ice cream, I am not sure if it was made by the chef for if it was from a carton because it tasted homemade. It had a very thick and creamy texture to it. It was mind blowing when paired with the fried banana. The server came by to ask me how it was and I, very shamelessly said, ""It's SOOOOO goood!"" which made him laugh.

Got seated right away but then again it was like 9pm 
Decor needs a little update. Seats were all torn out 
Space is a little small. Which is a good thing coz you know it's a whole in a wall type thing. 

Didn't get a chance to take pics coz we were so hungry 
Had the chicken wings appetizer (took long to come) prolly won't order it again coz there was nothing that says Thai about those wings. 

I got the chicken red curry and let me tell you they were so good! They got the right amount of spiciness and thickness it's not watered down and it was a lot. 

My bf got the drunken noodles and he loved it, it's not dry like others we've tried b4.

I came here a few times and I will continue to go because I'm glad there is finally a decent restaurant around the corner of my house. The owner is a past worker at Archi so I knew that the food wouldn't be a disappointment. Lunch and dinner are two different experiences. Lunch time offers a cheaper lunch menu and your order is accompanied by a cup of soup. But not all items are on the lunch menu so you'll have to find something you like on that menu or pay more on the dinner menu. I recommend the lunch Pad Thai, it's a great portion for lunch and very delicious. Their Pad Thai is the best Pad Thai in Vegas, it's the closest to homemade. Dinner time, I like to have noodles like Pad See Ewe or Pad Woon Sen, but I also like to come with my family to have family style dinner. If you come with a large group, there aren't big tables, but they'll try to make it happen. I recommend ordering rice dishes with bigger parties. Now, the restaurant is pretty small with only a few tables so it seems like takeout is the most popular here. In one sitting, I noticed that at least 10 people come in and out with togo orders. So this restaurant is great for lunch and dinner dine-in experiences or simply taking your food togo. It's an extremely convenient location with great food!

You don't need to be Dirty Harry to be a fan of Lucki Thai. This restaurant, in the Southeast part of town, will make you feel lucky, in more ways than one.

Lucki is one of the lesser known Thai restaurants around the Southeast part of town. It's an unassuming place located in a growing strip mall location, and it's been here for a few years. But this is not a spot that you should overlook, because they are making some very good, quality food, here.

So far, I've had a sampling of much of the menu over the years. One of my favorite Thai dishes is Basil Chicken, and they do an extremely well job of making it. Their heat levels are on point as well. When I ask for a 5, I get a 5. When I ask for a 2, I get a 2. They are accurate on their spicy levels. All the food that I've had here has been fresh, and well prepared. The flavors are bright and stand out.

This is probably the best Thai restaurant that is located in this part of town. Don't sleep on Lucki Thai, it's a very good restaurant, making very good food, with very competitive pricing.",gtwM4ijo65AN4DvXdgCu_w,14,15,4,5WbuHXR0rifinWqLxS-mzg

1489138,2017-11-15,0,ZhLSAiRj9kANxf8m2SBfRA,"I stumbled upon this restaurant through Yelp, and had dinner yesterday evening. My mom and I were greeted by the staff and were promptly seated. 

First thing I noticed was the placemats and booth seats are a bit worn down. Not a big deal, because the main focus is on the food. Their menu isn't too extensive, and most entree prices are based around what protein (or veggie) option you choose. I wasn't feeling too hungry, so my mom and I split a panang curry with salmon dish, and also ordered an order of chicken satay. We wanted to order some rice to go with the curry, but the waiter told us the curry came with a bowl of rice. We asked to order another bowl, but he recommended that we wait for the dish to come out first and see if we needed more rice from there. I definitely appreciate that he wanted to make sure we didn't over order and subsequently pay more. That left a really good impression on me, and it seems like they really care about their customers.

Anyway, the chicken satay came out first. The chicken skewers are laid on a bed of shredded green cabbage, and it comes with a tiny side of pickled cucumbers, shredded carrots, shredded green and purple lettuce, and thinly sliced red onions. The chicken satay also has a small cup of cool peanut sauce. I tried the chicken satay first without the sauce, and was a bit surprised that it had a thin layer of satay sauce. I've noticed that most other Thai restaurants have more of the chicken just rolled in satay seasonings, but not a sauce. I really enjoyed that because it was more flavorful with the sauce. After trying the chicken with the peanut sauce, it was even better! The peanut sauce is rich and very flavorful. The side of pickled cucumber salad was a good, refreshing balance to the heavier chicken satay and peanut sauce.

The panang curry with salmon came out with a full bowl of rice and I think it was enough for me to share for a small meal. You may need another bowl of rice if you're sharing and want to have a comfortable rice to curry ratio. The panang curry came with a large piece of salmon, and I didn't care too much about the salmon because it was a bit dry, and it wasn't really seasoned, other than the curry that topped it, so I ended up breaking up the salmon and mixing it around in the curry. I'd probably go for chicken or beef next time. The veggies in the curry included some bell peppers, carrots, cabbage, and a few pieces of broccoli. It seems like they have some steamed vegetables and pour the curry over, because the broccoli was not completely covered in the curry when the dish arrived. For the amount of curry we had, I wished there was a bit more veggies, so I would probably order extra veggies for $2 for this dish specifically or just replace the salmon with veggies. This dish was $12.95 for the salmon as the protein, but I believe if you opt for veggies, it would be $8.95, which seems like a better deal for a veggie dish. As for the curry sauce, it had a bit of the peanut sauce taste, which I really enjoyed, and I think it made the curry heartier! Very good!

Service was overall fantastic and friendly--both waiter and waitress working that night checked on us a few times to see if we were ready to order, to refill our water cups, and to make sure everything was okay with us. 

Overall, solid place for Thai food--I would definitely come back!",2KJ5BExMxBhcZUwZVGHrWg,0,1,4,_hx8FXl8om0r5qFKUUy-4A

I'm from LA where there's a part of Hollywood dedicated to Thai food and culture.  So to find this gem in Las Vegas made me so happy.  The food is authentic, and occasionally they'll do a twist and create something original like their soft shell crab fried rice, and it becomes a favorite.

Located in the Fresh and Easy plaza off of Silverado Ranch, the place is easy to miss if you're not familiar with the area (I was able to find coz of the yelp address and Siri ) the inside is quite small and has a quaint type feel to it. Definitely gives off a ""this is where you go to have quick sit down lunch"" type feel verses somewhere that I would want to sit down for dinner. They have a big banner outside advertising their lunch special as well, but just the inside screams lunch type dining verses the dinner type atmosphere. 

Unfortunately, I walked in after their lunch special times so I missed out on that, but the prices were reasonable so definitely not the place that'll put a dent in your wallet. Anytime I try a new Thai place, I go for what I know the best, Pad Thai, Thai beef jerky, sticky rice, crab Ragoon, or curries. So here I went for the ragoons and pad Thai. 

The ragoons were small and cute, but there was too much taste of just cream cheese like it was very sweet, too sweet for my pallet. Like no green onions or carrot or seasoning to off balance or blend in the cream cheese. Just for me it was too sweet. 

Now for the Pad Thai, I was extremely disappointed coz it was good but just didn't taste like Pad Thai, it tasted more Pad See Eew or Lad Na... Like had more soy sauce taste like the sauces were cooked in the same pan :/ I was just eating and it was good like I said but just really didn't taste like Pad Thai at all. 

The place is a bit cluttered in the back towards where the bathroom is... They could do better making it more presentable. I'm down to give this place another try if I'm in the area, but def not somewhere I will drive out to get.

The food is flavorful, SPICY (if you ask for it) and high quality. Some of my favorite things to order are the Pad See Ew, Tom Kah, Crab Rangoons, Sweet and Sour Chicken, and the Chicken Panang. I'm sure there are more amazing things on the menu. I just happen to fall in love with certain entrees and can't seem to order anything else.  

The prices are very reasonable, considering the quality is awesome AND the portions are larger than most Thai restaurants. Usually I find myself not having any leftovers at most places, but here I can always bring home a bunch and let it feed me for a few days. 

Servie is quick and friendly. My one criticism is something they cannot change. The place is small and busy. So sometimes you may have to order take out rather than eat in. But who cares! As long a I get to stick my face in some Thai food, I don't care where I do it.

And if u know anything about me is that I hate driving.... But I love Thai food and even though I have great restaurants near my house I'm always in the search for new places to eat. 

Service was 5/5....I was greeted right away and the young girls working the restaurant were super friendly and were totally on top of things. Great service with a smile!!  That was their saving grace on this trip. 

I got their lunch special which was a decent deal.  Soup.... Salad.... Egg roll... Fried tofu pad Thai. Now let me break it down. Egg drop soup.... Looked good... But tasted like raw garlic. I LOVE garlic but not when all I could taste in the soup was raw garlic....(2.5/5).  You can't really mess up an egg roll can u? (5/5) Salad was served with a ginger dressing... Very fresh and tangy (5/5). Fried tofu pad Thai. What a disappointment. :( :( :( :(  it was soooooo sweet! Too much sugar. Not enough tamarind to offset that sweetness.  It just did not taste like Pad Thai....i wanted that sweet, sour salty flavor combination. (3/5) and overall it was another -1 star cuz I asked for level 10 spice and they have me a 2.... It was NOT spicy at all. Maybe they thought that I couldn't handle it?? Boo!! :(

I also ordered the chicken lettuce wraps. I love love chicken lettuce wraps.  BUT these were overly salty. All i could taste was soy sauce.  BUT I did love the Roman lettuce vs the traditional iceberg lettuce. So props to them for the change. (3.5/5)

Overall.... If I'm in the area... I might stop by but with so many better Thai choices in Vegas...I don't think that it'll be very likely.",L3DxG0n3lRq5N2lv1QNrrA,8,4,3,PPa2jycntjkOD3rPxsJYTw

2003894,2016-02-15,1,ZhLSAiRj9kANxf8m2SBfRA,"For Valentine's Day, we drove all over Las Vegas trying to eat at two of the highest Yelp rated restaurants in town.  Unbelievably, my quest to eat Louisiana food at Lola's and barbeque at Rolling Smoke BBQ was derailed  when we pulled into the parking areas for both these locations at around 7:30pm and found these places to be closed.  Closed on Valentine's day???!!!!!????  Their loss is another restaurant's gain.  Lucky for my family we found Lucki Thai and after eating here, I can unequivocally say that its awesomeness isn't due to luck.

For anyone staying at the Southpoint Casino, you're lucky to have such a gem of a restaurant just approximately 1.5 miles from the casino.  My experience with Lucki Thai is something that all of Las Vegas should drive near and far to see if what I will be writing is true.  Lucki Thai is worth the drive if you crave quality thai cuisine.  Lucki Thai is not a fancy place.  Rather, I'd characterize it as a Mom n Pop, hole in the wall type restaurant, which usually means it serves food to write home about.  It's not a big restaurant and mainly accommodates customers in booths.  There is Asian influenced decor, but it's low key and not too presumptuous.  The customer service from our waitress Ling Ling warrants the high 5-star Yelp rating along with the scrumptious thai food.  Ling Ling was soooo friendly, attentive, and made right on one of our dishes that was a little too spicy for 2/3s of my family.

Lucki Thai's dishes can compete and defeat other thai food I've experienced in San Diego, which is where we're from.  We ordered the Tom Yum soup with chicken, garlic pepper shrimp, and the one dish I judge all thai restaurants, Pad Thai with beef.  The Tom Yum soup was a bountiful amount of succulent chicken, tomatoes, mushrooms, and tangy broth.  The soup came in a large bowl that had a large flame shooting from its center.  Initially, my wife and son took one bite of the garlic pepper shrimp and said they couldn't eat it because it was too spicy.  After telling Ling Ling about the shrimp being inedible, she quickly had it replaced with less spice and we devoured the shrimp like there was no tomorrow.  The Pad Thai at Lucki's was one of the best I've ever eaten.  The noodles had the right texture, the beef was cooked perfectly, and the mixing of the noodles, crushed peanuts, and bean sprouts made for a clean your plate experience.  I like spicy thai food, so I asked for medium spice (#5), which wasn't spicy at all.  I engulfed the pad thai along with a side of rice and a sprinkling of thai hot chili.  

I told Ling Ling that I said compliments to the chef because they threw down the gauntlet when it comes to making yummy thai food.  Since Las Vegas will be a volleyball destination for many years, Lucki Thai will be a must visit whenever we're in town.  In the famous words of Dirty Harry, ""Do you feel lucky?"", I would have to say ""Yes"" especially if he's asking me about thai food at Lucki Thai.  As I said, it's not luck. It's just plain, outstanding food.",TdDxMS27vu0fXXxIvz16bQ,2,1,5,j1h7c3lUgOnLo0Vnp44WOA

As always when I'm at a new Thai place, I ordered the Tofu Pad Thai and a soup.  I do this cuz pad Thai is hard to f#$% up to a point that is not edible.  Their pad Thai was super saucy and really salty which was strange.  I also got the wonton soup which was also a bit salty, but not nearly as bad as the pad thai.

I had high hopes for this place since there seemed to be good reviews, but in all likelyhood I will not be coming back.

The pot stickers were awesome, really good spicy sauce to accompany. The thai beef jerky was okay, I've had better. The spicy basil with tofu was great.

The reason I'm giving three stars is because I ordered the Tom Yum soup with shrimp and although the broth was DELICIOUS, it only came with three little shrimp and a couple mushrooms and at $6.95 for a pint (16 oz.), what a rip off.

 I added thin sliced red bell peppers, fresh spinach, cubed tomatoes and cilantro and it was delicious, but I shouldn't have to do that...and I know most y'all muhfuckers don't have that in your fridge, which is why you tryna order food, nah'm sayin'? 

A 32 ounce would have been $12.95 and unless the broth would've been made from Beyoncé's sweat...nope.

Decided to give this place a try based on my co-worker's recommendation. And I'm glad I did! I ordered the chicken pad kee mao. My favorite part was the garlic and basil...flavoring was packed to the punch! My boyfriend got chicken pad thai and soft-shell crab with basil. He enjoyed his pad thai a lot but he had better soft-shell crab at another thai restaurant we frequent. Our portions were a good size....enough for leftovers.

I usually get spiciness level 8 for Thai dishes and since this was a new restaurant, I decided to tone it down a notch. Should've toned it down two or three....because WOOWWWWW the spiciness level 7 was SPICY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It wasn't a hurt so good, it was a hurting my eyes are tearing up with a constant runny nose!!! So be careful....Lucki Thai's spice levels are no joke!!!!!!!!!!

Lucki Thai is located near the corner of Bermuda and Silverado Ranch Blvd, right next to the Fresh and Easy location. 

We've been to South Point more and more lately and wanted to find a new Thai place to try out in the area. After checking on our trusty Yelp! app., we found this place!

Items Ordered:

- Chicken Pad See Ewe ($8.95)
- Pork Laab (I guess I've been misspelling this ""Larb"" recently...oops, my bad) ($8.95)
- Side order of jasmine rice ($1.50)

(+) Very friendly and attentive service! Never had to see our drinks empty the entire time we were there!

Chicken Pad See Ewe (4/5) For the price, a very solid portion that was very tasty. Plenty of chicken too!

Jasmine Rice (3.5/5) Kind of hard to mess this up, but they did good! Rice was the perfect combination of sticky and fluffy.

Pork Laab (5/5) Best Laab I've had in this country! Seriously, prepared exactly how I love it! Plentiful portion as well! I will be ordering this dish often!

(-) Only complaints with this place was that the seat was wet when I sat down today and there were a couple small, dried food fragments on one of the plates already at the table when we sat down. I just decided to not use that plate, but still not something you wish to see when you are just sitting down at a dining establishment.

I like this little place a lot! The people are nice and the food is really good and all that at an affordable price! With our recent patronage at South Point, I can see myself coming back here again and again!

Not only is the food amazing but the service is exceptional. I ordered takeout and the lady that took my order on the phone was very friendly and helpful. Then when I arrived, all of the employees are so welcoming and friendly, the vibe and atmosphere of the little place is very hard to come by these days. 

I got home and the food was just as amazing as the service was. And when you find a restaurant that has great service, that makes me want to come back there for just that. But the food was amazing too so I'm definitely going to be back. I ordered the Chicken Pad Thai spicy level 5 and the Green curry spicy level 5. Pad Thai was amazing, curry was good but I wish I got that one with spice level 0 cause I feel like the spice makes it taste a bit different. At least different than green curry that I had before. But either was good is great, I definitely recommend the Pad Thai. 

Great place, very small inside, probably not suitable for huge parties but lunch or dinner with a few friends to eat in is perfect. One of my fav Thai restaurants in town.

Definitely recommend sharing.
Mom and I didn't. Our eyes were bigger than our appetites.

We ordered the small Tom Kha Shrimp soup, the Spicy Eggplant with Chicken, the Chicken Panang Curry and the Pad Thai with Chicken.  SO. MUCH. FOOD!  

Because we don't really know how spicy things are here.... we ordered everything as a #2 (out of 10.)  I always err on the side of caution until I get a feel for a place.  

Anyways.... flavors were so good.  I wanted to lick my curry dish, but I was too full.  I took 1/2 of my curry dish home for dinner tomorrow night.  Mom took home 1/2 the pad thai and 1/2 of the spicy eggplant which should be enough for 2 more meals for her.

I really liked the soup.... it was creamy but not overly so.  The creaminess did not coat my mouth like some thai soups do.  The soup was not heavy and had lots of veggies in it like mushrooms and tomatoes as well as plump, succulent shrimp.

For all the food we ordered plus 2 hot jasmine teas... the bill was $38.  Personally, I think that's a really good deal since Mom and I have food for the next day too.

3213332,2015-01-29,5,ZhLSAiRj9kANxf8m2SBfRA,"You cannot imagine how LUCKI we felt finding this restaurant.  Ironically, they were located in the same small strip mall as the place we had originally decided to eat.  Un-luckily (or maybe not), that place was closed. A quick Yelp search settled that dilemma, and Mr. B moved the car about 50 feet.

Its location determined its size. It was small, most certainly, but pleasant and clean. It was a non-peak hour, and we had the place to ourselves.  The food was plenteous and came out quickly.  Again, Lucki.

Our order was fairly predictable and non-adventurous, but absolutely no regrets:

*Tom Yum Soup with shrimp - a good, sour version with 3 large shrimp.  It came in a small bowl, a serving enough for one for lunch, or two if you are planning to order other dishes.

*Yellow Curry with pork - delicious.  We got spice level #3.  It was just enough to make the creamy, flavorful sauce have an interesting bite to it, not spicy enough for wussie me to complain. There was plenty of meat, but also a lot of potato and carrot.

*The Beef Jerky appetizer - thick slices of marinated beef strips, fried then served with a spicy red sauce that was over the top good.  Again, just enough spice to make it interesting.  It was not real dry, as implied by the name Jerky...just lean and flavorful.  I loved it.

*The Lettuce Wrap. Other than having to ask for more lettuce leaves because there was too much filling (such a dilemma), this was a great tasting appetizer.  Served with a side of plum sauce, the meat filling was seasoned beautifully.  A great dish and plenty to feed the 4 of us.

*Pad See Ewe with chicken - Made with wide rice noodle, broccoli, carrot, and thin slices of chicken, this was done perfectly too.

Our (well, maybe only mine) only disappointment was there was no mango and sticky rice dessert.  As in the Goldilocks story, somebody ate it all up before we got there.  

All in all, this was a solid and delicious meal at a price that could not be beat, $40 for the 4 of us.  I am looking forward to a follow up visit and a generous tummy full of Lucki-ness next time we are in Sin City.",W3Z5K5Ks4PJHo_RFexaqdA,8,5,5,_qfpMgUj6MTlgjXi9oXPxQ

I'm kicking myself in the butt for ordering shrimp yellow curry instead of chicken

I paid 4$ extra for shrimp and quite literally only received 5 shrimps in my curry. With the tails on.  Which normally wouldn't bother me at all because I love shrimp but with runny curry I'm finding shrimp tail pieces I have to avoid eating because I poured the curry over the rice. That's not a total deal breaker though, as I said, my fault I should've got chicken!! The carrots are finely sliced and the potatoes are just okay. With all that being said the 4 stars really goes to THE CURRY ITSELF WHICH IS AMAZING. I wish it came with more stuff though, I have soooo much liquid and barely any protein or veggies. 

The Thai Tea is nothing to complain about but I've definitely had better and definitely had worse.

There was only one other table so they were not busy at all which is why I don't understand why the waitress was rushing to get our order. After being told we needed more time, she came back only two minutes later to ask if we were ready. Needless to say, it was a bit annoying. We decided on Crispy Pork with Spicy Basil sauce, Tom Kha with seafood, Chicken Pad Thai, and Red Curry with beef. The food came out quickly enough and we dug in right away. 

The Crispy Pork with Basil sauce was very tasty but had very little pork in it. It was mostly asparagus, basil leaves, and bell pepper. The porj wasn't very tender either. 

Tom Kha with seafood was delicious but not worth the $15. It only had one piece of shrimp, 1 mussel, a couple pieces of squid, and little bits of chopped fish. I would order it again but maybe with chicken. Very rich flavor with a hint of curry and coconut milk.

Chicken Pad Thai was a bit too sweet for my liking. Again, they were very stingy with the meat. I didn't feel like it had enough of the peanut taste.

The Red Curry with beef was very savory. I could eat just the sauce with rice and I did end up having too as it only had a few pieces of beef floating in the soup with countless bamboo pieces. 

We decided to order the sticky rice with mango. The waitress was excited to tell us that the mangos were very ripe. Unfortunately, we were very disappointed when the order came. The sticky rice was delicious but the mangos were nowhere near ripe. They looked ripe but they were extremely sour and when we flipped it over there were dark spots all over the middle of it. 

Overall, the food was ok and at first glance you will think there's a lot of food. However, they're very stingy with the meat. I understand that it's a business but people will not come back if they feel like they're not getting their money's worth either.",JddUKeXfP0lhsxrEkoCBPQ,2,2,2,TpPpjwEQZp5My1xiHJx_gQ

The restaurant is quite nice-looking though. The menu is just one page, so not actually as extensive as most other Thai places I've been to.

Service here is EXTREMELY attentive and friendly. They really take great strides in serving you, you will know what I mean if you dine here. Another party had a birthday during our meal, and I didn't want to mention that it was my birthday, but when we were jokingly asked I responded affirmatively. Thus, my honey toast dessert came with three candles.

For my main course, I ordered basil duck off the specials board. While the flavor was good, there was not much meat at all, mostly just skin and fat. I understand that duck is a more expensive ingredient, but when they upcharge that much for duck entrees (most other dishes were $10 and under, but duck and seafood are $14+), I expect a little more substance. My friend's eggplant and tofu dish was better in my opinion. At least they don't charge extra for rice.

The honey toast for dessert was not that spectacular, it just came with toast and ice cream. It's hard to compare when I've had such elaborate honey toast in Taiwan; I mainly ordered it at Lucki Thai just to serve as my ""birthday cake.""

Overall, a decent Thai restaurant with very friendly service.

P.S. They have a spicy range of 1-10 for all of their dishes. I ordered 5 and it barely registered for me. Thai spice can get pretty hot though, so I wouldn't necessarily recommend 10, but as a medium-spice tolerant individual, I will say that 5 here is not all that spicy.",lQCY0csLfjdDn6cdVq43UA,0,0,4,mcsEEZiTY6G2REZcsrdN3Q

My dish had just the right amount of food -- savory, with the bean sprouts and peanuts perfectly separated. The chicken wasn't the best. The pieces were on the rough side. A lot of Thai places use this kind. I tried the yellow curry, and loved how their potatoes seemed to be marinated. The carrots didn't seem to match, and tasted too raw. Service was good. The gal with the glasses kept checking on us, along with the older male tending the front counter. People were coming in and out for their to-go orders, so business seems to be going well.

A bold statement for a little place in a shopping center that most people probably don't know about, but it really is that delicious.

We were greeted promptly, put in an order for wings, chicken panang, veggie pad Thai and cucumber salad. 

The panang was so good!! The best I've had in town. The sauce was a good amount full of sweet and spicy flavors of coconut milk and curry, the chicken was incredibly tender and over a bed of warm rice made it amazing. We could have eaten two plates. 

The pad Thai was also full of flavor, tons of fresh veggies and the perfect tangy sweet sauce. The portion was so large we took half or it home. 

We couldn't leave without some mango sticky rice and it was the best I have ever had! Tons of fresh mango, sweet sticky rice topped with sesame seeds and a sugary salty sauce. So so good! 

The service here was so wonderful. The staff was incredibly attentive, kind and helpful with recommendations.

Their Pad Thai is also very nicely done. A lot of places don't seem to cook the noodles right. They are either too dry, or too floppy, or stuck together. These guys really seem to have it together. This was my first time eating here and I must say, Whitey is impressed.

The presentation of the food gives you the feel of an upscale restaurants. The interior is nice. It's not overly fancy but it fits the food very well.  I had the flagship Panang Curry. I picked level four for the heat and it was perfectly spicy for me. The waitress told me they have 10 levels of spice which sounded about right because lots of Thai places have many levels of heat or spiciness.  My wife ordered a pineapple fried rice with pork at a heat level number two. It wasn't too hot at all and the waitress was the one who suggested number two spiciness.  It was a little spicy when I tasted it and as with all spicy food I knew it would be a little spicier than my first few bites so I knew it would be pretty spicy for her. Ever notice how spicy food get spicier as you eat it?  Ever drink a hot drink like coffee after eating something spicy? Anyway the Thai tea took the kick of the spice down a notch which was perfect. The food was very very good as well as the service and presentation. It was easy to get to the location and easy to find and it has all your Thai favorites. I'm glad I have a new place to go to.

We had fried whole pompano fish with fresh ginger sauce and pumpkin curry (chicken and tofu) with steamed rice included, which I highly recommend both dishes.

The papaya salad with sticky rice, pad se ewe, pineapple fried rice, spicy basil dishes, and red/green/panang curries are all winners in my book.

If I'm being a stickler, I think their meat quality could be better and more consistent, and when I dine-in here I sometimes feel like I'm getting overserved - but the reality is that the staff have always been friendly and make me feel like they are trying their best.

Plus as one nears the restaurant the wonderful aromas just fill your senses and make your taste buds water at what's coming. Lunch baby!

When I walked through the door I was seated immediately and handed a menu. They had a fantastic lunch special that was almost too good to be true too! Decided on veggie fried rice, which comes with a house salad, wonton, egg roll, and egg drop soup for $9.95.

As I sit here and eat my lunch I am so happy for dining here since with great wait service and food one can not ask for more. Plus my foot continues to tap constantly to the golden oldies of my day. With such bands as the Beatles and Journey. The right music makes you want to get up and dance while eating lunch, but I have controlled the urge since this is not my living room. 

The taste of lunch was so wonderful all of my senses present and dazzled. The veggies were steamed so perfectly. The colors used by the different veggies also gave so much color to my lunch plate making it so much more appetizing. The egg roll and its accompanying sweet and sour sauce were amazing.

Lucki Thai is another Thai restaurant in a city chock full of them, and perhaps that saturation as well as this place's slightly off the beaten path location (Southeast corner of Silverado Ranch and Bermuda) dissuaded me from trying them. We all have our favorites that are closer to home and/or more familiar, don't we? But since I was in the area and my friend had said it was pretty good, I decided to stop by.

The dining room is on the small side, but there were plenty of tables open at 8-ish. The lighting in the evening appeared a little dim, but I was able to get decent food photos anyway. My mom, who is familiar with the Thai language due to her studying/travels, pointed out that the employees are indeed Thai, so that was a pretty good sign. The menu looks fairly standard, and we each picked out a dish.

Pad See Ew with beef ($8.95): I chose this because it's one of my favorite noodle dishes. Almost everything was awesome: luscious noodles, plentiful thinly sliced beef, somewhat bitter and crunchy Chinese broccoli, delicious sauce, and appropriately spicy for 3 out of 10. I did find the beef to be a little too chewy, especially with one or two pieces that still had long stringy fibers. But for the price, you can't expect the moon. I highly recommend this dish.

Papaya Salad with BBQ Chicken and Sticky RIce ($10.95): my mom wanted this dish. We immediately noticed that it wasn't anywhere near 3 out of 10 in heat, but this wasn't so bad because I'd asked for additional spicy condiments on the side. The papaya salad was on the tart side and had plenty of peanuts (allergy sufferers beware. The chicken was moist and well-seasoned, and using the sweet sauce helped to counter the sour salad. However, I really didn't appreciate that the sticky rice felt pretty hard and got even harder as it cooled down.

I'll make an effort to come back to Lucki Thai. The other noodle dishes should be similarly great, and I've gotta try the curries because of Marie T's recommendation.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,13,8,4,cJXMmHLUrnM2fbBbeTbGdg

The food came out quickly, and it looked and smelled wonderful. The portions were generous. One of my favorite parts to the Pad Thai are the bean sprouts, and these were very fresh and flavorful. They were also nice and cold. For my husband, we asked for chili oil, and got a side of it as well as sliced peppers. Of course, he used these generously on his food. For me though, the food was spicy. The spice also crept on us as well. So by the end, I had to slow down and was drinking a bit more between bites to keep the heat at bay.

Also, I get take out all the times I go,  but my brief interactions with the staff are always super positive.  They are a very nice,  and they deliver quick service, while maintaining quality. 

Shrimp pad Thai, great flavor and portion.  They are always good with not being skimpy on the shrimp. I like the noodle they use as well.  Some places use the type that looks like spaghetti, and I just am a flat noodle type of gal. 

Chicken padseew is the best I've ever had,  super flavorful and not oily like some places.   Also, just right balance of greens without them becoming a filler.   The noodles and sauce have this amazing almost carmalization that just makes you want to take another bite. 

Thai beef salad always generous with the beef,  amazing balance of sweet,  and tangy,  and full of herbs.   Only downside is sometimes the salad part is barely present,  and I have to add more lettuce myself. 

Crab fried rice which is basically the lucki Thai fried rice with crab.  Huge portion.  Great building of flavor profiles. 

Lucki Thai wings.  So crispy,  and the meat is tender, and that creamy aioli they serve it with is addictive. 

They have other good items in their menu for sure,  and some I mentioned in my previous review, these are just standouts that I think go above a lot of their competition in the valley.  They also have a handful of items I have ordered in the past I think were sub-par that have tried in the past like their crab rangoons, calamari,  and chicken satay.

Everything here tastes great! Literally. Everything. My personal favorites and recommendations are: 

Noodle Dishes
- Pad See Ewe
- Pad Kee Mao
- Pad Thai
(Chicken or Beef for protein)

Curries
- Chicken Panang
- Red Curry
(All incredibly flavorful curries)

Soups
- Tom Yum
- Wonton 
(Tom Yum is great for an app and Wonton is deliciously hearty)

Spice levels are typical for Thai restaurants between 1 - 10 so please be conservative with your spiciness.

Besides the food, every other reason check out Lucki Thai:
- Service is over the top friendly
- Take out is fast and easy
- They deliver!
- Inside is clean and inviting 
- Open late (10 PM)
- It's a hole in the wall that you wouldn't think serves alcohol... but they do!

Tonight I ordered spicy basil with chicken to go. When I came home to eat it, I found a strand of hair in the food. The dish also smelled kind of funny. All in all, very different and subpar compared to how it had been. I hope management reconsiders and put more effort into the food they prepare.

Not a desert absent of rain/moisture, but a desert absent of good restaurants...a so-called 'food desert.' Never has that become clearer than on my recent trip to Henderson where I ordered take-out from Lucky Thai from my hotel (Hampton Inn on Saint Rose). The person that answered the phone at Lucky Thai had a thick Thai accent, that obviously bodes well for the authenticity of the food. I ordered the Spicy Basil Chicken and he asked 'how hot would you like it 1 to 10?' I said 4. I also got 4 of what they call egg rolls (but I'd call spring rolls since the skins is crisp and thin). My entree arrive in typical white styrofoam to-go boxes.  However, they lined the bottom with a thin sheet of aluminum foil which allowed them to include all the WONDERFUL sauce!  OMG. Why doesn't every restaurant do this. The food tasted like the chef cared about my meal. The spiciest was perfect for me, although if you're a wimp I'd suggest 2 or 3. There were huge fully formed branches of FRESH basil! Did you know that truly healthy basil has vibrant purple stems?  Me either until I ate this dish. The spicy and salty nature of my entree paired very well with the 4 spring rolls with their amazing sweet and spicy sauce. The white rice was well cooked and allowed me to do something I've never done with food delivered to a hotel room - I dropped portions of rice into the intoxicating Spicy Basil Chicken broth!  I got angry while eating this 5-star meal. Certainly not angry with Lucky Thai. Angry with the restaurants in my home town, that can't remember caring about fresh ingredients and cooking with love.  Angry with anyone who lives in Henderson and takes these artisans for granted. You know how groups sometimes will adopt a stretch of highway and keep,it clean?  I would ask Lucky Thai to consider adopting a Thai restaurant in Gainesville GA and teaching them the aluminum foil to-go trick that allows customers to savor intoxicating hot broths/sauces at home.  I can't wait until my next trip to Henderson. Kop kum krup!",B1rU4xBWfOY6uiuXwUTxNQ,0,0,5,s_dM6vl5-chfdTMldIbwJQ

I called 10 times to even get through that's great that there busy. When I tried to place my order the English was very bad and I am not knocking the person for that it's just that I was sick and it's hard to repeat yourself and the order taker said my card was declined and I had to hang up and call my bank and yes it was Lucky Thai mistake I had money available for the order so I called back and re ordered my re order. When the delivery person came she couldn't find my apt so my sick arse had to go all the way outside to meet her. I was so excited for my food and it was not like it usually is, saggy lettuce for chicken wrap. The won ton soup was nasty. I tried to call this evening and they put me in la la land so I stopped in to tell the manager who wasn't there what happens. Buy the way the person I told my story too said ""you don't order here that much"" ? Ok what is the point I order from them when I 
Sick. So the manager who was not there suddenly appears out of the back I explained the story he told me to bring the food back. I throw it in the trash homie! He told me he is running a small business and it's hard. I didn't expect a full refund I did tell him I loved the honey toast. But the service and other food items were bad. He refused to do anything for me I asked for my $3.00 delivery charge back since I had to help the delivery driver out. Even if he didn't give my all of the money he could and should have offered me something other than a lame excuse. I am a regular and I had a bad experience and you didn't care to turn it around.

5085209,2016-01-04,4,ZhLSAiRj9kANxf8m2SBfRA,"Lucki Thai does noodle dishes pretty well! One of the main reasons why I love Thai food is the balance and punch of all the flavors of, sweet, salty, savory, and spice with delicious vegetarian options

Pad see ew AKA pad see oOoOohhhh! Definitely, one of the better versions that I have ever had. The flavors were on point, super tasty, without being overwhelming. The pad see ew had a generous amount of fried tofu and mustard greens, which added a textural element as well as another flavor profile to the dish. I did not mind the bitterness and mustard-y taste of the greens, but this may not sit well with others. The noodles were okay. A plus on the noodles is that they were not clumpy together. The dish could have used more noodles, especially to equalize the ratio with the tofu and greens. 

I had pad thai a couple times and it was great! Not disappointed with the flavors at all. Definitely, not a bland dish. A safe dish to try for the first time. 

The yellow curry with chicken was a miss for me.  The curry was good, but the potatoes and onions could have been cooked longer. Biting in the onions was overwhelming and so I ended up just avoiding them. The spice level of 4 / 10 was pretty accurate. 

In the past I have had their BBQ chicken with sticky rice and papaya salad. Thai BBQ still has the best BBQ chicken, but Lucki Thai's version is pretty good. I did not care for the sticky rice and opted for plain white rice. The papaya salad is good, but on the sweet side. 

I see myself coming back if I am in the area, but with so many Thai options in town, it's not really my go-to.

It's not the best, but I consider it above average which is good enough for me.  

Whenever I visit any new Thai food place I always order Pad Thai, not only is it my favorite Thai dish, I use it a gauge to rate the restaurant. 

Pad Thai was pretty good, noodles were soft and stretchy and it had a right balance of sweetness, with deliciously cooked vegetables.  
Spice Level - 5/10

Spicy Pork Basil -. I know I'm supposed to eat this with rice, I just pushed that side and practically devoured this. Tastes so delicious, spicy and aromatic.   
Spice Level - 5/10

Tom Yum Soup -  I'll give it props it cleared up my sinuses!! It had distinct hot and sour flavors, I enjoyed drinking the the basic broth full at the end of rich herbs and spices.
Spice Level - 5/10

5372132,2018-05-27,0,ZhLSAiRj9kANxf8m2SBfRA,"I love Thai Food, and when we were in this side of town we came across this place by using Yelp! The food was delicious! I read another yelpers review regarding the spiciness levels. I too usually get a 8 when the range is 1-10, but she said she wishes she toned it down a couple of numbers cause the spiciness is on another level. So, I got Chicken Pad Thai number five. 

When I first took a bite I was like ""Oh, shoot it's so spicy"" but I love spicy so it wasn't tooooo bad, but later on it started having no spicy. I think the spiciness was all just on one side, and it happened to be in the first couple of bites I took. It wasn't like there was a bunch of chili flakes on that side or anything, it was all one color, so I didn't know I should have mixed it.

I had leftovers and ate it this morning, and there was very  little to no spice. I guess I should have mixed it around. I wish I lived closer to this place. Spiciness level aside, the sauce was so good and the Pad Thai wasn't dry.

My boyfriend got fried rice. He said it was really good.
We also ordered crab rangoons, that was also good 

The service was perfect! We arrived at the perfect time as a big party came in right after and we would have had to wait.",baW-EBVOGmLMuUgUdsiUpw,0,0,4,YDxiomseYZigsWjxirVChQ

5390870,2015-10-17,6,ZhLSAiRj9kANxf8m2SBfRA,"To whomever owns Lucki Thai:   Lucki is actually spelled with a y.   Sheesh, how embarrassing.   Beyond the (yes, I do realize it was intentional) misspelling of the name of the restaurant, Lucki Thai doesn't miss on many marks for me.

I've had the opportuniti to dine in, get carri out, and order deliveri (I'll stop this now) from Lucki on many occasions in the last few months, so I can tell you that no matter which method you decide to go with for your thai food fix there you won't be disappointed.  The first time I had Lucki I dined in and had the Tom Yum soup with Shrimp and their Crab Fried rice.  The Tom Yum Soup is consistently good, and I'd know since it's been a staple of every single order I've made with Lucki since.  It's always hot, with the perfect combination of sour and spicy, and loaded with mushrooms and an ample amount of shrimp.  The large order feeds 2 perfectly.  The crab fried rice is not something I tend to order, but Lucki's version definitely packed a lot of crab flavor.   They also weren't shy with the egg on the rice, and being an egg slut like Anthony Bourdain, that pleased me.

I've done a mix of delivery and take-out many times since, and every time the delivery is at the house by the promised time (usually well before), and the food has almost always been ready to go when I arrive for a carry-out order.  

Of the items I've ordered those times, the curries have been phenomenal, as has the spicy eggplant entree.   I wish I could explain what makes the eggplant there stand out over other places that I've had similar dishes, but I usually gobble it up so fast there's no time for me to remember any particulars about the dish other than it's absolutely delectable.  I'm also a huge fan of their brown rice option, even though it's $2 extra.   Lucki's brown rice is one of the only in the city that I feel is worth whatever upcharge they want for it.   I'm pretty sure it's not just brown rice but a mix of wild and brown rice.   I also really liked the Rad Na, though my laziness knows no bounds in that I felt like it was a lot of work eating it.   It's truly shameful.   

The only order I wasn't completely thrilled with so far was the Beef Pad See Ewe.  The flavors were nice, but the beef was tough and chewy.   A simple misstep which I can forgive.

I have to admit I almost gave 4 stars instead of 5 for the only thing that has gotten on my nerves a bit with Lucki Thai thus far:   spice consistency.   I started by ordering level 6 and 7 which is my normal go-to at other Thai joints, but didn't find them spicy enough.   I've now settled on an 8, which at most places would feel like it was burning a hole in my esophagus with each swallow.   Getting delivery a few weeks ago and ordering an 8, it had literally ZERO spice.  It actually might have gotten into the negatives.   It's quite frustrating because I suspect if I move into the 9-10 category the chef stops even paying attention and probably just dumps a whole barrel of ghost chiles into the pan.   WHAT'S MY NEXT MOVE HERE?

But alas, the service and food are simply too good even with that inconsistenci.  Sorry I couldn't resist.",v3YOx9T4jRSw8XP9Rd9H4g,7,5,5,QpwGPaQT-KCsfnEnEaE5qQ

My husband and I ordered delivery and they came in only 30 minutes. We ordered: Tom yum soup, pineapple curry with steamed tofu, wonton soup with egg noodles and vegetable basil fried rice. I usually order the spiciest when I eat thai food but their #10 is no joke! I loved it but unfortunately it was almost inedible for my husband. One thing that was an absolute plus for me was that the soups and curry were still piping hot. There's nothing more unpleasant than to have your food be cold by the time it gets delivered. Everything was delicious but I wasn't too pleased with the vegetable basil fried rice. I've had better at other restaurants but it doesn't really matter because it isn't a dish I get often. Our entire order came out to around $40 (love it). Only bad thing I can say is that it was weird to not get utensils and napkin with a delivery order. and the rice tasted like it wasn't fresh and had been microwaved real quick.
Customer service seems great so far. The man who answered the phone and took my order spoke clear English and he was very nice. Like I said, Lucky Thai is my new go to thai restaurant from now on.",1WgU_94dK_2xgOEYvjOMVA,0,0,4,i1OvymHo84ngWwH6uKemZA

5673467,2015-03-23,0,ZhLSAiRj9kANxf8m2SBfRA,"Let's just begin by saying Lucki Thai is an outstanding restaurant. We all love good food. But something that remains to be seen by most restaurants (or any business in this day and age) is quality customer service. Not here! Everyone I've ever met here really goes above and beyond. Each time we walk in that door or call to order, they make us feel like family. How many places can you say that about? I know my list is very short. 

My husband and I moved to the Silverado Ranch area in October of 2014 and noticed that there was a new restaurant opening soon too! We would come to know that restaurant as Lucki Thai. It was the first meal we had in our new house and we have ordered fairly consistently (probably once a week) since then. Let me tell you, the food is ALWAYS stellar. Whether you order in (I highly recommend it because the restaurant itself is very cozy and inviting) or take-out/delivery, you'll never be disappointed. 

A few of the things we enjoy regularly are the spicy eggplant (the sauce is really flavorful and the eggplant is super tender), pad kee mao (these flat noodles really knock it out of the park), pad thai (perfect for anyone who likes those sweet peanut flavors), panang curry (it's packed with tons of flavor and delicious veggies), tom yum soup (one of the best versions of the soup I've tried), and the wonton soup (my mother would once order this at any restaurant who would serve it but she continuously requests it exclusively from Lucki Thai now). My husband and I enjoy spicy food so we typically order a spicy level 6 and it's just right for us every time.",l-TGsgKkBa5KMpG9Qc78eA,1,0,5,h4tXYb8mYrUqDf9l1TdnDg

I had ordered a Papaya Salad and for my Entree a Lucky Thai Fried Rice w/Salmon. I loved the papaya salad! My second favorite place to eat this salad (first fav is back home in the Big Island, HI). The Lucky Thai Fried Rice was actually really yummy. It looks really simple with green onions, onions, and egg, but it has lots of flavor. The Salmon was nicely fried on the outside and moist on the inside.

5711053,2017-08-13,22,ZhLSAiRj9kANxf8m2SBfRA,"How ""LUCKY"" am I to discover a wonderful place where you can't go wrong with delicious Thai food and wonderful customer service. This restaurant fulfills my cravings for Thai food and I know that my family and the Vegas community can say the same. 

My two top dishes I always order is the Pad Thai and Kung Pao (pork). The portions size is perfect: not too hefty, not too small. When it comes to the spice level of 1-10, they really do a great job of hitting the spot. I tried the lowest of lows to the scorching hot level 10. It just shows how they detailed they cater to each individual's order. 

Both dine-in and delivery experience has been a breeze for my family & I.
As for delivery, there is a $3.00 charge. Delivery time window is estimated 45-60 minutes but I usually get my order fast and early! If you would rather have them knock your door than ring the doorbell you can state so on the order form. My preference varies depending on who is inside my household and for them to never miss a beat on my additional instructions laminates the 5/5 for customer service!

Location: Located south of Bermuda and Silverado Ranch, this restaurant is snuggled between Island Pacific Market and the Integrity Taekwondo Studios. It's in the plaza where Jack in The Box and Dunkin' Doughnuts are at and there is plentiful of parking spaces upon entering. 

I love this place and if you have enough room in your stomach for desserts, order the Sweet Rice & Mango!",Bhc91b8DfAYeceqhHRnqHA,27,24,5,L8rp8XUCY968dEXHx6ZclA

We have an annual family trip with friends to Vegas and ahead of time, I start bookmarking all of the places I want to go visit. We try to stay away from the larger hotels for the most part and try to focus on the hidden gems of Vegas. Starving after a day of swimming, I decided to use my old faithful, Yelp, to give me a good recommendation for a Thai restaurant and it did just that. We came in around 6 and it was a little busy but not so much yet. We did have to wait because we had a party of 8 and the restaurant has very limited seating. The gentleman at the front was very friendly and promised to grab us outside when the table was ready and even started taking our orders so our wait was minimized. Who goes above and beyond to even do that? Such a blessing when you have 4 little rowdy boys with you! Awesome! We decided on the Pad Thai, Pad See Ewe, Mongolian Beef, The Lucki Thai Fried Rice, the Lucki Wings, and the Kung Pao Shrimp and Chicken. Everything came out pretty quickly upon seating. The food was amazing. The noodles tasted like they were just prepared that day and the flavor notes were on point! I honestly probably saw, while sitting there eating, about 12 groups of people who ended up leaving because the line was so long. Yes! The food is that good! The owner, who ended up being the gentleman who took our order, was super friendly. I'm definitely making my way back here when we come back in July!

We've had the garlic chicken numerous times and we also had dishes such as: beef and broccoli, orange chicken, and some lemon based chicken dish. All dishes were delicious and are made to order so it comes out hot and fresh every time! You can also add the level of spicy-ness that you prefer to most dishes. The Thai iced tea is also a good refreshing drink after your meal!

The prices are fairly reasonable , about 9-10 dollars per dish, but the dishes are very large in portions, so expect to have leftovers for tomorrow! The atmosphere is also very quiet and the environment is very clean and presentable.
