When I first started coming here last year the service and the food were both good.  As of late the service is non existent and the food is ok when it finally shows up.  Tonight I was having a couple of drinks with a friend during happy hour.  There were only 15 people in the place.  I made the mistake of ordering nachos.  After 20 minutes I asked if they were almost ready and was told yes they're on the way.

After 35 minutes no nachos.  I asked to cancel them and I was told they're on the way.  I've made nachos once or twice in my life and know that it doesn't take this much time when only 3 other people have ordered food.  

after 40 minutes I told the bartender to cancel the order.  He then told me that if I was going to come in and order food then cancel it; to never come back again.  40 minutes for nachos?  He then started cussing at me along with the cook that tried to tell me that he had to cook the paper thin steak from scratch.

This place is always empty and I finally figured out why!  Too many options in Vegas to put up with this type of BS!  Never again!!  I'll go somewhere else to get ignored and get treated like crap!",Gtk0wiSbaYBfRvk7_VocOg,2,0,1,aZarc5Bq4YSJ-hV9HUwlIA

767207,2016-01-25,0,muD5-YKII_qOTRpbRWuOHA,I've been to this PT's twice in a week. Both days different ladies are bartending. Came in with my cousin who is visiting from Cali to do some catching up!  Last time was a thick Asian girl second time big white chick. BOTH times terrible service! I don't know what we did wrong but the first time the lady was just flat out rude with an attitude for no reason. She was very short and looked like she was ready to leave (which she did and another bartender took over who was friendly hence the two stars). Second time was tonight. Came here with my cousin and co worker. They looked a tad busy so we sat down and played while waiting to be acknowledged since both bartenders were busy but then 20 mins go by and nothing. No one asks us if we need a drink or any help! The lady who was helping on our side wouldn't even make eye contact with us at all! So I cashed out and left! I'm so disappointed because this place is right down the street from me.,hd1Si9vS1hzoFy4ZfgQLYQ,0,0,2,YIFY_njkOn_hzs-H2iAVgg
993818,2015-03-29,0,muD5-YKII_qOTRpbRWuOHA,I have been going to this PT's for a little while. Its very close to my house which is really cool. Lisa and Angel are the best bartenders. They really take care of me every time I come in. The atmosphere is pretty good for being an older PT's. The food is very good especially there hamburgers and chicken wings. Another reason I come here its a pretty clean bar for being as old as it is. The drinks are cheap during happy hour too.,U0pUOShL5PhtCMjqSDHDWw,0,0,5,udgNrsUj1MsfbiMpk7kwKQ

Music is old school and that's cool. Had pt platter with breakfast and two ciders. Waitress is fun, can hold a conversation but leaves you alone if
you want. 3 in the afternoon and there is only one other couple in here.

I used to frequent this location quite a bit years ago when Tommy and Chuck worked it, and haven't been back since they left. 

However, ""Yeah, Yeah!"", Wolfie's in the house. Love what he's done with the joint. It's a nice crowd. The place looks great.  Very comfortable. 

He's a true professional, personable bartender. A dying breed in Las Vegas. Good conversation when it's not too busy, laughs, and don't get him started on the Bruins and Red Socks (I'm a Red Wings and Tigers fan so we got that going). 

And it's not just him, the entire staff is dialed in. Everyone makes you feel welcomed and comfortable. Like they actually enjoy working there and you being there. Not like they are just waiting around for your tip. 

I may have never come into this location ever again, even though it is close to the house. But now, it's on the top of my favorites list.

Happy Hour is from midnight to 2 a.m. It used to be until 3 a.m. Since I only had 30 mintues left, this one was the closest to my house. Got there, it was kinda packed but not smoky like other PT's. 

Sat down, Chris the bartender was by himself. Poor guy. But he was pretty attentive and knows what's going on in his bar. Got a black velvet and oh man, too much cider not enough guinness. Ok, so I said I was hungry but the first thign I got a was a beer. Haha. I ordered the Gilroy pizza which is a thin crust pizza with Italian sausage, pepperoni, mushrooms and dices tomatoes. 

Delish! But I could only handle 2 slices, cause I was already full from my Black Velvet.

2360891,2013-04-28,1,muD5-YKII_qOTRpbRWuOHA,"Sometimes I forget that this PT's is here especially since the Marie Callender's that shared the same parking lot closed down a while back, I don't venture in the area anymore.  With all PT's they have their 50% off Happy Hour for drinks and pizza which run from 5pm-7pm and 12am-2am.  It's next to liquor store and massage places.

I decided to write a review because I thought the bartender was awesome.  She showed us what was under her top...just her tats.  She's cool not gonna say her name but she already knows she's cool. She even hooked us up with a pitcher.  She was very friendly and always came by to talk and check on us while tending to the other people there.  She is also a lot smarter than the guy bartender at the PT's I usually have no choice of going because she knows how to redeem my free beer with Yelp check-in and knows you don't need a printer to redeem.  I ended up not even using the check-in offer.

This PT's was clean like most other PT's I've been to.  It had a pretty chill environment with shuffleboards and billiard tables.  Plenty of TV around so you don't miss any of action.  I liked the movie posters that were scattered around the bar.  I spent some time looking at them cause I love movies.

I finally tried the pizza.  They weren't that bad just difference more like pizzas you'd get from the groceries store.",vWP8-aQX0rYJszqkWVL7Ew,1,0,3,AbvCNgLVMt6CXFa7z7b_TA

The nachos are my favorite things to eat here. They also have really amazing early morning country fried steak! It's only $5 too. There's a lady that works mornings and she's horrible. No service, forgets to give people their beers, and doesn't tilt the glass when she pours it. What a shame. I don't remember her name sadly. They have a bunch of pool tables and a cool little sit down area separate from the bar. It's in the same plaza as Blueberry Hills!

My husband has been to another location, so we stopped here for a bite before heading out of Vegas.  Although it says bar and grill on the outside, it is really BAR.  They do have a full menu of sandwiches, chili, and these new buckets of wings, fries, etc. 

We sat at the bar and ordered, the bartender/ server was friendly.  There were several people sitting at the bar either drinking/ eating/ gambling/ all 3. 

It was dark in there like a bar, but the food was rather good.  We split both the Cuban (ham, terrific pulled pork, pickles and grilled onions) and the Philly cheese steak topped with Cheez Whiz.  LOL.  We also had sweet potato tots and garlic fries.  The garlic fries went REALLY good with my Copperhook beer!

Overall, seems like a great local bar to hang out in.  Food is pretty tasty.  Service was friendly.  Didn't get any bad looks from locals in the bar.  Ha. ha.",ddZffVYvHsCIhylU5UG-dA,0,0,3,dk8PVJ0CotB_arFG12b3NQ

I've been here 3 or 4 times from my trips to Vegas and it is a great pub to grab some food, drink some brews, play pool or just chill. The bartender is awesome and the drinks are super cheap during happy hour. 

When I came here on my recent trip, we had a huge party who didn't want to go clubbing and just wanted to chill and relax. This pub is spacious, still has game machines for the gamblers, and the service is awesome. We had ordered 3 pizzas, and 2 chilli tots, the server accidently gave up 2 chilli cheese fries, we told him about the mistake, his quick response was, ""sorry about that, would you like me to make you chilli tots for you?"" At no additional cost, he gave us the fries still and with a quick response like, that honestly gets an A+ in my books.

5056939,2013-07-11,0,muD5-YKII_qOTRpbRWuOHA,"Went searching for a PT/Sierra Gold near the strip for some late night grub with a buddy a few weeks ago. Almost didn't see this place due to construction blocking alot of that area. I couldn't quite put a finger on it. Best I can explain it is the place had sort of an outdated look, or hadn't been renovated in quite awhile. The bartender was the only person out on the floor. I was surprised it's not very busy for a place so close to the strip but I guess it isn't being it was a weekday night.
We got our drinks and ordered my usual gilroy pizza since it was happy hour. It is worth noting that their gilroy here did not include salami or artichokes. The couple other PT/SG I've been to usually has those ingredients on the gilroy. Also, the pizza was slightly undercooked. Instead of the normal cracker thin crust, it was floppy. I'm used to just right to slightly overdone crusts.
This visit to a different PT/SG was by no means horrible but it wasn't great either. Service was decent and it did satisfy our late night hunger. Although I might try to find another location next time when wanting my gilroy fix near the strip.",zL2wX9mGV1p1nUSOk5mKxg,0,0,2,JSJGqGMYrlGkx9oNTt5cQQ

It's completely cute, cozy, and clean inside. There were several large screens playing various sporting events. This PTs wasn't smokey at all.

The bartender, Melissa, was very welcoming and was really fun to talk to. She had reggae playing and it set a very chill vibe for the place. And gentlemen, she's beautiful.

My sister and I split a pile of nachos. They were huge and tasty. We ordered a brownie Sunday for dessert. It's a warm freshly baked brownie with a scoop of ice cream on top. It was heavenly.
