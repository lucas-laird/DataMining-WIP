When we got here my husband spotted the bottle of alcohol on top of the bar. He thought it was cool...lol...and it was! The ambiance is so cozy. Not too loud not too quite either. Not like some Mexican place the noise is bearable. 
The service is ok. It's kinda slow. But they refill drinks constantly. The waitress is pretty friendly. It's the service is so slow. We waited long for our check to arrive. We like the unlimited chips and salsa. They have a salsa called Diablo I think that's the name. It's not even spicy at all. The regular salsa is spicier than that.

578612,2012-07-23,0,4tWF2w6jP2LNK2xTVNEMFw,"Given the paucity of Tex-Mex in Las Vegas, we decided to try Gardunos which we found on the internet under the heading ""Tex-Mex"".   Big mistake.  

We arrived about 4:45 on a Sunday evening.  The place was almost empty, but that did not improve the service.  The server was sullen and indifferent and seemed to resent our presence.  She spent most of the time trying to avoid customers lest they ask for something.  The young man whose job it was to bring us drinks and chips was rarely to be found either, and when he was his face wore a mask of utter contempt.  He also spent most of his time making himself invisible to customers.  Apparently they believe that the salsa bar makes their presence unnecessary.  Too bad they didn't have a water bar so we could get our own drinks too.

The server tried to up-sell us everything.  ""Want sour cream or guacamole with that?""  When it became clear we weren't interested in add-ons the service got even worse.  

When the food finally arrived it was lukewarm.  The chips which we started with were cold and the sopapillas (which we had to ask for) at the end of the meal were so cold the grease had congealed.  They were inedible for anyone with the standards of a ground hog.  Are there no supervisors at this place?  We are not the only ones on this site to comment on the alienated workers and terrible service.  
  
A decent Tex-Mex restaurant might well be a hit in Las Vegas.  Surely there are enough displaced Texans to create a demand.  But don't bother with Gardunos.  It is truly awful.

There is much to applaud. 
The multiple salsas at the, All You Can Eat Chips and Salsa Bar.
Decor visually impressive.
Blue Agave Bar (shares some space) w/ it's overhead suspended parade of Tequila bottles. Kinda a unique visual.
The ""Table Side"" Guacamole. They make it Fresh right there! (extra $ my guess)
Portions in general are on par. (big)
The $23.99 Margarita. 40oz. (monstero de borracho, I'll call it)
Waitress was of caliber. I could tell she'd be happier being somewhere else. But, she was nice I want to add.

Beyond that there is the ever present casino background noise as if you are on some game show that is just beginning, or at the movies and the THX sound trailer plays and builds up every so often. Or the maintenance employee with his Walkie-Talkie squawking noise 10ft away during the dinner rush. And if there are 3 of you and you get a booth, avoid being in the middle. The seam between cushions is not friendly to you bottom (or should I say culo).

And the real reason I'm motivated to write this review............
my poo was not happy this morning.
Wait. Maybe it is authentic? I did have the water.

On that note. By all means.........................

Back then, it was located in the middle of the Fiesta Casino. The food was amazing (I'm of Mexican decent and know my Mexican food). Fast forward to this last weekend. I haven't eaten here in about 5+ years now and was really looking forward to a nice meal and margarita. I ordered the blue corn chicken enchilada stack with green salsa, the charro beans and posole. I should have asked if they could make it with regular corn. I think it might have been better? The tortillas where tough and flavorless. the green sauce was hardly existent and the same for the cheese and chicken. I lost interest in the tortilla and ate the little bit of chicken and cheese. The flavors were nothing special. The charro bean were my favorite though. Excellent flavor and reminded me a little of the ones my mom would make. The posole was not very good. No flavor and the meat was dry (in the soup!). My daughter had the stuffed sopapillas and those where pretty good. Nothing special though. The margarita sampler was a cool idea but because they are samples, they make them all on the rocks. They didn't have enough ice and each was warm. Not what you expect from a refreshing drink. The hostess was excellent and sweet as can be, the waitress never came back to check on us or refill our waters.

1179840,2013-03-21,0,4tWF2w6jP2LNK2xTVNEMFw,"Gardunos started in Albuquerque, NM  where I lived for four years.  In Albuquerque they use fresh grown New Mexico chilies and use a lot of the authentic recipes from that area.  When we went to the Gardunos in the Palms it was just the normal Mexican fair.  It is still too bad that the Palms kicked them out.  We haven't been back to the Palms since.   As a local that is the only reason we went there.

I was pleasantly pleased to see that this location is attempting to get back to their original heritage.  The menu is different, offering the blue tortillas option etc.  The chef was on the floor talking to the customers so I told him I was from ABQ and that I knew about Gardunos.  I told him I could tell they were trying to get back to the authentic offerings.  He said thanks!  Know why?  He had just returned from there learning more New Mexico traditions for his kitchen!  

Years ago, I had to use the soapapilla and honey to put the fire out, I didn't need to so either the Rojo sauce needs to be hotter or I missed the hottest option.  My traditional fair is a blue corn cheese enchilada and chili relleno with Rojo.  My next visit I will ask for a hotter sauce and see how I do.

If you drink Margaritas, it has a huge selection and the tequila bottles are hanging from a moving track through out the ceiling.  Salsa bar is cool.  I give them 5 stars for effort and style and a 4 for not hot enough!  I'm looking forward to our return visit!",6u7oygtrd2-t2IS_WLE6UA,1,0,5,vJY9H02U9j0phLd-wWd2Sw

My wife asked for the large as did I. There were no prices on the menu for liquor and the waiter didn't offer up any and we didn't think to ask. When we got the bill, the prices were as follows....1 strawberry $26.95 and 1 regular margarita $24.95. My complaint is this, if you're not going to post prices then at least have the waiter or waitress inform you of the prices. What's to stop them at $26.95? Why not $30, $40 or even $50 a pop?

2071864,2015-03-30,5,4tWF2w6jP2LNK2xTVNEMFw,"Meh. Service and food were both subpar. We were seated for a good ten minutes before anyone came to our table to take our drink order. Apparently the hostess sat us in a section that had no server. Considering there was hardly anyone in the restaurant, I don't understand how this was a problem. Our server, John? I think, when he finally showed up, was not good! To start, we ordered guacamole which is made tableside. After placing our order he assured us the guacamole would be out shortly. We then saw him go in back and could hear him laughing and messing around with some of the other workers. After about ten minutes we asked about the guac, and he said ""Oh yeah, that will be out in ten minutes."" Well who the hell do you think is supposed to make it?? He is! Sure enough he runs to the kitchen and comes out with a cart of all the ingredients to make the guac. By the time he was done making the guac, our food was coming out. Not that it was such a big deal or anything because we ate the guac with our meals, but come on man do your job! 

As far as the food nothing really stood out. What I do like about this place is they have a self serve chips and salsa bar. So you can get unlimited chips as well as different kinds of salsa and bean dip. I pretty much filled up on the chips, and I am glad I did. I got the 3 item combo and I chose a chile relleno, a chicken and a carne asada taco with rice and beans. The chile relleno was okay, the tacos meh, rice and beans standard. Nothing memorable about this meal. Mom got the fajitas which looked tasty, but they were not cooked to her liking even though we asked them to be well done. My dad got the steak, and honestly how can you mess up a steak? He seemed to enjoy his meal. So afer we had paid and were on our way out, my mom remembered we were supposed to get dessert, (fried bread with sugar and honey) which was included with our meals. We asked John, and he said ""Oh, I didn't know you wanted them."" Well did you ask? No. Why someone would assume we didn't want something that was not even offered to us is beyond me. John sucks.

I got the Chicken Tacos and that's all they were, chicken and tortilla, I asked for no cilantro so maybe their pico has it and so it was all left off, but she could have noted that to me when I asked.

Dishes are not breathtakingly delicious but decent. Do not expect melt in your mouth, magical masterpieces you'll dream about when coming here, no matter what your past experience with Mexican food is. If you order a combo and they're not forgotten, you'll get (sometimes) warm sopapillas, which are good fun.

This was a little frustrating as I was coming home from work, I needed to get into my hotel room, eat, shower and pass out.  I get there and the first thing I ask is why can't I order to go, I get a response that because too many people were ordering food and not picking it up, oh please- that is the worse line of bull I have ever heard.  I should have thought about it, I'm sure it's a hotel policy that makes them do it because they want the individuals to play while they wait for their food.  I'm told, oh its quick- literally 5-6 minutes, I'm sitting here thinking that's not even possible, but let's see it happen! No, it wasn't possible, that girl lied worse than a politician- the food took almost 20 minutes and it wasn't worth that much of a wait for the rush I was in.  

I got the steak fajitas with the whole wheat flour tortilla, and the first thing to mention is the tortilla (which there were two) were hard and crusty on the outside, like CRUUUUSSSSTTYY!! I ripped the edges off and said whatever lets dive in and make these babies!  I immediately realized there was about 3 pounds (yes I'm exaggerating, come on people!) of vegetables and 5 oz. (no I'm not exaggerating) of steak.  Literally I'm talking 6 small little pieces of steak with what I guess a whole large onion and 2 bell peppers.  The steak was good, I will say- but the overall flavor of how the onions and peppers cooked was not great, it just was bland- not a fan at all! 

Will I go back yes. Was I happy with the service, not so much.  I didn't like being told I couldn't pre order, I didn't like that the girl bold face lied to me about the cook time, and I didn't like that I had what felt like tortillas from the early 2000's and I wasn't happy that I got less steak than the scraps I feed my dogs.

I was visiting friends in Vegas and hoping that we would go to Viva Mercado's (I truly heart that place so much) and instead I'm being dragged to a casino near their house - and it's a local casino that I HATED going to when we lived in Vegas - which just happens to house Garduno's. It's the Fiesta Rancho casino.

So not only am I doomed to suffer from bad mexican food (I have been to Garduno's before in that same casino) I am forced to wade through locals who are so hell bent on gambling.

I decided to order their fajitas. What a freaking mistake. They were sizzling and so deceptive. They smelled so wonderful. My mouth was actually watering. Then after I assembled my fajita into the flour tortilla, I took a bite.

Nothing. No flavor, even the onions had been blanded out. How the fuck do you do that? Seriously. How the fuck can you get onions to lose their taste?! How? HOW? H O W ?! I could only tell the difference between the bell pepper and the onion thanks to texture. Their ""rice"" was just that...rice.

It was a disappointment through and through. Service was ok and that's why I'm giving it 2 stars. The food was shite.

The atmosphere is loud. But I don't think their location within a casino really helped with that. You could hear the slot machines outside of the restaurant. One slot machines was so freaking loud I could swear I could hear it over the din of everything...and it was shouting, ""WHEEL OF FORTUNE!!!"" I kid you not. If it were a kid I'd have turned to it and said, ""You're indoors now. Little voice.""

Decor is such a throwback to the 80s. You know what I'm talking about - that alleged upscale restaurant with the puffy booths and that nasty peach/pink pastel color teamed with green along with the sea green acrylic tabletop. ugh. I needed an intervention when I was sitting in that place. Badly.

After all that hassle, I even paid for the crappy food for my friends and myself. I waved good-bye to my friends later on and made a beeline for Roberto's. Yea, I was that pissed off and angry at my food. I'd have gone to Viva Mercado's, but they were closed at 2am.

Just a note -- why did Garduno's get voted best as one of the Best of Las Vegas? Does anyone in Vegas have taste buds? If they did, they'd be screaming for either Roberto's or Viva Mercado's as a Best of Las Vegas.

Seriously, don't fall for Garduno's anywhere. I've had the misfortune of eating at 3 different ones in 3 different places -- don't fall for that nasty, bland, SALTY food.",ixxfMzn3-vBRgG10ofwLgw,1,0,2,7ZWNJP1ns6TJQljLTLX50g

3966756,2016-01-06,12,4tWF2w6jP2LNK2xTVNEMFw,"I really like Garduños and I was sorry to see the location at the Palms close.  I first ate at a Garduños in Albuquerque in 2001 and I was delighted with their chile verde.  With the growth of Mexican restaurants on my side of town, the trip to Rancho and Lake Mead is not necessary anymore but I did miss that chile.

I had a small comp that could be used at Garduños so off I was in the rain halfway across town to enjoy this dish.

I was seated immediately--the place only had about 4 other occupied tables.  My server came over and dropped off chips and salsa and then went on his way (that became the story of my meal there) while I studied the menu which really wasn't necessary but it was worth a look.  It hasn't changed and I knew what I was getting.  My server returned and I ordered.  He asked me what style I wanted and I went with the diced chicken rather than the machaca version.  My iced tea was brought and then I waited.

I saw the bowl placed on the shelf in the kitchen but my server had a way of just disappearing.  I'm guessing it sat there at least five minutes before he sauntered in and got the bowl.  By the time I got it, the temperature heat had cooled a fair amount.  The chile was a bit spicy but I wanted some Cholula or Tapatio.  Server nowhere to be seen.  I eventually gave up, cut the whole chile in quarters, and used a quarter at a time to give some heat to the dish.

Bussers cleared my plates and then I waited.  Five to ten minutes passed before he returned and asked if I wanted dessert.  He got the menu and then disappeared again.  At least ten minutes later, he came back, put his hands on my shoulder and said, ""I keep forgetting you here.  Did you decide on dessert?""  I told him I was going to pass and he took my voucher and came back with the bill totaling $4.04.

At this point, I was so irritated that I was wondering what to leave for a tip.  I decided on $2, put it in the folder, and walked out.  It wasn't until I got home that I realized I stiffed someone for the small bill.  

I called and spoke to the manager and she said to forget it and apologized for the poor service.

Even with the two star rating, I will be back sometime.  I just will make sure I have a different server who doesn't forget me!",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,16,10,2,w1pY2uMPbT3BVc7boimqNw

The moving train of taquila hanging over head.  The giant barrels.  I still like the salsa bar.  They have a good selection ranging from mild to spicy, chunky to thin, cold to heated.  That coupled with the endless supply of serve yourself chips is is good in my book.  The food, however, is lacking a certain freshness and authenticity.  When you order a taco you receive something that looks like it belongs in taco bell.  It is not the fresh fried shell you get from Roberto's, that's for sure.  The rice and beans are okay.  Nothing special.  The chimichunga is filling.  It is loaded with meat and cheese and comes with a scoop of sour cream and guacamole.  The scoop of sweet corn cake was not as sweet as I am used to.  It was actually rather starchy.  And I remember the days when Garduno's used to bring out sopaipilla's with honey after the meal.  Those days are gone apparently.  My only reason to go back now is for the all you can eat taco special they put on once or twice a year.

The blue corn gives the tortilla a different pleasant type texture. It is also served with a side of polzole and beans. The beans are served in a smoky sauce which is more Southwestern style, reminiscent of baked beans. Also don't skip on getting a frozen margarita!

In the beginning, they serve chips and have a salsa bar where you can get salsa for your chips & more chips. Next, I ordered a seafood enchilada because my server recommended it! It really fell short of any standards of Mexican that I've ever had. Yeah, so overall, Food = not top tier. 

The service that I got here was okay; Since everyone has been using their Groupon, there was a pretty long wait time. But, the staff was super friendly and always coming around to check on our table! 

I think the thing that I got the most excited about was the drink! Garduno's is a margarita factory, and I was pleasantly surprised! They make some pretty bomb margaritas! Some of the fruity ones are a bit too sweet, but they are pretty tasty!!! To get away from the margarita craze, I also ordered a melon mojito :) A little bit strong, but it was delicious! They were damn cheap too! $7 for most drinks I ordered, which made my wallet happy.

WAY too spicy and most of the table likes their Mexican food with a little kick.  This was SO SPICY, you could not taste the food that it was covering.

I come to this casino every year to take part in my annual hockey championships that are held on the ice rink here.  Garduno's has become a regular postgame dinner or lunch spot for my wife and I since it is just steps away from the ice rink in the casino.

They offer up some good Mexican food here.  My favorite menu item in the 3 item combo.  You can build your own meal by picking any three burritos and enchiladas with different fillings, such as chicken, ground beef, or cheese.  I like to get 2 ground beef burritos and a ground beef enchilada.  It all comes smothered in either green or red chili (I like the green best) and also comes with a side of rice and beans.  I never fail to clean every last bit off the plate.  My wife likes their shrimp fajitas which arrive at the table sizzling and smoking.  The meal also includes complimentary chips and salsa on the table and you can refill at their chips and salsa bar.  We have yet to try their extensive list of margaritas, but they sound good.

As far as the decor goes, it's a little dark and dimly lit and pretty much just feels like you are in your everyday casino restaurant with a Mexican theme.  They have a sort of track that runs along the ceiling of the bar area that has countless different tequila and liquor bottles attached to it.  It's fun to watch the parade of alcohol make it's way around the ceiling.

Whenever I come to Vegas to play hockey at Fiesta Rancho where Garduno's is located, I am always happy with the meals served up here.",h_nErN5SHrDmjKPfplfs_g,0,1,3,u-m6ahhnWMXhpBBYXBjOdg

They bring you a round of chips n salsa but you are welcome to self serve at the chips bar as much as you like and with a few other salsa, i personally liked the style of chips and salsas were ok. 
For dinner I ordered the 4 Taco Combo w/ corn tortillas, gf ordered stuffed sopapillas which she said were all ok. 
My taco combo was relatively good and tasty, i was not a fan of the beef version though, it just tasted too much seasoning or something, but the Steak, Chicken, and the cheese tacos were on! Rice was ok. 
I also ordered the Steak nachos as appetizers and overall they were ok, lacked a little in the cheese, lettuce/tomato toppings as well as short on sour cream but the steak was good and proportioned well. 
Drink were there margaritas which were great and well recommended in any of there choices. 
Did not order desert as they bring you warm Sopapillas and honey which are amazing in itself! Completely stuffed after this.

On to the service and food. We were sat around 6:40 at a table in the back. There was something so incredibly sticky on the floor on one side of the table that my grandpa, grandma and mom were making crunching noises their feet. We immediately asked the hostess and bus boy to clean the floor and they left without saying anything. We waited about 5 minutes or so and they finally came to clean the floor with a wet rag. Meanwhile, they brought us a high chair for my 10-month old to sit in and it was noticeably filthy. The sides had caked on old layers of food. My husband began cleaning them with wet wipes. The manager ended up coming over and we discussed the floor, high chair and our overly wet table. She apologized and walked away (not offering to clean the high chair, by the way). 
Now we're sitting. And sitting. And sitting. We waited 20 minutes for our server to arrive and take our order. We did have a few others bring us water and chips. After taking our order, we waited another 40 minutes to revive our food after my mom noticed our food sitting under the warmers (the kitchen is open for all to see). 
My mother received a chicken tamale when she ordered pork. My husband ordered a Pollo asada burrito that was supposed to be filled with grilled marinated chicken, cheese and pico de gallo. No pico. No cheese. The chicken was in chunks and tasted as if it was boiled in the microwave. He ended up not eating and complained to the server, which is something he never does. She did take It off the bill, but she seemed offended and kind of snippy.  
Overall, our experience was terrible and we never heard anything from a manager. Even after all these issues, a manager couldn't find time to come to our table to issue a simple apology. We will definitely not be returning.
