Service was slow at times but I was so distracted by the spectacular display of culinary delights I didn't care.  Foie gras profiterole? Check. Best omelette station you'll ever encounter? Check. Prime rib, slab of bacon, ham, and... Peking duck? Very much check.  Oh and a room of decadent desserts so dizzying you'll feel like Kevin in Home Alone 2...  $58 is pricey but frankly it's better than Sterling Brunch which is $90 - treat yourself.",BlmH9A3KVAGZV_E12SgVRQ,5,2,5,OPu2NjBRqLOSgCRyOiEM6g

I found it on accident in the summer of 2013 when I was trying to figure out where to have brunch with a buddy of mine.  But we couldn't afford to go.  When it isn't a holiday, it is still a pricey brunch at around $60.  This is not an ordinary Las Vegas buffet.  There is an unlimited seafood chilled bar, prepared hot items, chefs waiting to make you food, and a special dessert room after you're done with savory items.    I couldn't get enough of the pate profiterole with Asian pear!  I did notice though that the food was a little better on a holiday than any Sunday.  Still worth it if you have never been!   It is better than the Wynn Buffet.",p1Fg32FAnMoRkXlznU07Xw,2,1,4,3-LlvcOBDE68lcmYUsbuiQ

The Fountains Brunch at Jasmine may be the best Sunday brunch you've never heard of. In comparison to the more famous Sterling Brunch across the Strip at Bally's, many people aren't aware that on Sunday, Jasmine in the Bellagio opens at 11 a.m. for a luxe, Cantonese/dim sum/all American breakfast brunch. The room is decorated in florals and creams... it's a bit old lady, but never feels stuffy, especially with sunlight streaming through the windows on a bright morning. Better yet, the room's floor-to-ceiling windows overlook the Bellagio fountains, which go into overdrive especially for brunch patrons. Fountain music is pumped into the room every 15 minutes as the fountains perform. 

Outside of the fountains, the centerpiece of the brunch is a fantastic buffet. It's not massive, but there's a wide variety of superbly prepared dishes. Traditional american brunch favorites are here, with the usual Bellagio-classy twists: the belgian waffles are red velvet, the eggs benedict are served on a lobster-potato cake. There's an excellent raw bar, a selection of caviar and sushi, and awesome cold bites and cheeses.There's also an omelet station, but a better choice is the soup, where a chef customizes asian-style noodles to your liking. The carving station has huge chunks of beef, lamb, and incredible carved slab bacon. The dim sum components are great too: sui mai, short ribs, crystal prawns. Best of all, they serve fantastic peeking duck table side in steamed buns. 

The finale of brunch is a room devoted to desserts, and unlike many buffets, these are made in small batches by the pastry team and are quite good. Additionally, the pastry chef on staff chats and explains the different desserts, what was particularly good that day, and what ice creams and gelatos they've prepared. 

Downsides: it's not cheap ($80ish), and unlimited champagne is an add-on. (They have different levels of sparkling wines, and I believe the lowest was about $15?) I think they add gratuity automatically, but the service was so good when I went that my boyfriend and I ended up tipping more. 

Overall, this is a truly not-to-be-missed morning in Las Vegas. Make reservations, go hungry, and prepare to spend a few hours indulging yourself. If nothing else, this is probably the classiest way to deal with a hangover on the Strip.",2H-8nsK3e-rgcbh670jsXQ,8,0,5,AlonsTTmRfEInTZYw9KQ0Q

Coming off a truly unexpected experience at Wicked Spoon just one week prior and with a long holiday weekend at my disposal it was with high hopes that I waltzed through the Bellagio conservatory en route to a meal nearly four years overdue on my expansive 'to-do' list - a Sunday afternoon at the upscale Cantonese restaurant Jasmine for ""Fountains Brunch.""  Considered by many to be one of the best buffets in the city and housed in a breathtaking room where floor-to-ceiling windows joyously exploit the twice-hourly water-dance outside it was to the left of the ornately decorated space that I found myself sat and with lightly roasted coffee adding $4.50 to the base $58 my meal began, a tableside pastry tower presented from my server whose interactions would otherwise prove perfunctory at best.  Small in size but diverse in selections with steamer tables, chilled sections, prep-to-order, and a whole room of desserts it was with Asian options that I began and with sliced to order Peking Duck on warm bao the star of the show both dim sum and crab soup would show equally well while congee proved mealy and flavorless leading me to overlook the noodle station in favor of things more unique.  Focused next on cold tables it was in exotic ingredients and iced shellfish that Jasmine hoped to justify its pricetag and although the King Crab was fine while foie gras pastry proved addicting the sushi, cheeses, charcuterie, and salads were rather pedestrian - a toothsome muesli better fitting as dessert a rare exception to the rule.  Moving through more ""American"" selections including a decadent pot pie, two delicious benedicts, and casserole-style French Toast imbued with banana and Nutella while quickly discarding flaccid waffles and dried out breakfast breads it was finally in sweets that nearly everything excelled - a well culled selection from which I nearly sampled the gamut - a Jean Phillipe's gelato station, perfect puffs of choux, and DIY fondue all receiving repeat visits with Asian pastries decidedly conspicuous in their absence.  Undoubtedly a special space but maligned by service faux-pas necessitating requests for refills plus clean utensils suffice it to say that although 'luxe' in many ways a brunch at Jasmine does not come cheap and while some items shined none but the duck was on par with Wing-Lei's Chinese New Year while neither service nor selection were equal to Wicked Spoon which rings in at nearly half the price after tax, tip, and drinks.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,5,3,3,D5dcd2bGG0rh8v4uXEZ8HA
