It also has cotton candy ice cream that isn't overly sugar filled just the right amount. Owner was super helpful answering questions,Wmy03Re63t51-WQCplOXxw,0,0,5,DdUVkjHBRf6xKgx1gbwj7A

Besides, they quickly corrected the order and even upgraded my espresso boba shake to the next size up for our extra wait, which wasn't even long. I love the outdoor patio area that's gated off with pretty string lights. The gelato selection was pretty good. Some unique flavors, some usual suspects. I'll definitely come back to try their soft serve ice cream and fresh fruit shakes next time.",NkE-ORKVsdVAtwOGuBsbsw,3,2,4,txaekDCHRWEvSJlVcwL9XQ

1987782,2018-05-19,0,VjLwITncAngZjGnOL0prCA,"Cute place, but overpriced.   I've been wanting to try Freeds so I bought a slice of the wedding cake.
Cake was hard, not good at all.  I only took a few bites which was disappointing because it cost so much!   More than my fav Starbucks frapp!!
My daughter is obsessed with unicorns so of course she HAD to have the unicorn shake.   But at $10, I may have had a mini heart attack.   Again, wayyy overpriced!   I really miss Salted Malted across the street near the Walmart.   MUCH better assortment at half the prices.",kDsPxChQHceR7uWZez11GA,2,0,2,9GjoS9a_m_gQNc1vpqd8yg
1988379,2018-03-11,1,VjLwITncAngZjGnOL0prCA,"I've gone to Sticks and Shakes 3 times now since its opening. I first went because a very nice Australian lady came to my car and knocked on my window scaring me half to death ............ but she wanted to give me some coupons for the place. 

Each time I've gone I've been the only person inside. The girls that help are always extremely nice. The dessert case has always been empty, nothing to display other than the gelato. Either way I've gotten the snickers mini milkshake each time and it's honestly one of the best I've ever had. 

It's $6-$7 for a mini which I can't justify paying each time I want a milkshake, but when I can validate it I have yet to be disappointed.",gnRJLFH4rmB1DTu985Thzg,0,0,4,HQ6XZj47UjKKmJGvyaES1A
2248859,2018-04-07,0,VjLwITncAngZjGnOL0prCA,It's cute!! Sadly the flavors of the cupcakes were a miss; it tasted more like cardboard. Chocolate did not taste chocolate-y at all :( cupcakes tasted like something you'd buy at Walmart. I hate cheap dessert. The milkshake wasn't too horrible but tasted more like milk and they placed a very bland red velvet cupcake in it that just made it worse.,pnCUHUuZsv2uPFTUFs0lXA,0,0,2,IyPkyHgpRyAcJvM6ZVRg8w

There are so many options to choose from the staff gave me an overview of the menu and I had such a hard time picking what I wanted. Everything looked so good, but i decided to go with the watermelon gelato, and some churro bites!! Unfortunately it was so yummy and I forgot to get a picture but I will be coming back!!! This is  great place to get a nice sweet treat and will have options that the whole family will love!!

3072110,2018-03-29,2,VjLwITncAngZjGnOL0prCA,"I got the Big Baller shake and a chocolate covered cherry cupcake, my SO got the snickers milkshake and a pineapple coconut cupcake. 
I really wanted to like this place, but sadly I was very disapointed.
First off, I decided while waiting for our treats that I might not ever come back based solely on the music being at the level of that of a club - seriously! We had to yell over it to ask questions and could barely hear the answers. Then stand there for 10 minutes wishing it would just end soon. The decor is cute though. 
My shake was lacking flavor, I put some chocolate syrup in it when I got home and it was much better. 
Unfortunately there's nothing that could save the cupcake. It was dry and I'm definitely not a fan of the frosting - what the heck is that?? It has the consistency of pudding left out to harden, or something. It's foamy and weird and not a wonderful flavor. (Go to tsp. down the road for a moist and delicious cupcake!)

So, bad experience only made worse this morning when I saw the bank statement that said we spent $27?! SO said he thought it's was $16 but without a receipt we'll never know, but we surely paid $27 for 2 eh shakes and 2 bad cupcakes. I gave a 2nd star for creativity and potential...",QKfZqCzMdAz9CTYrhC5DjQ,2,2,2,q31R0HQCdZNpbXNNG1tD_w

I only got a twist of soft serve ice cream, but my husband got the gelato and it was GOOD! I mean let's be real, is there any gelato that isn't good? I was kind of surprised this place wasn't packed when I went! It's so clean in here! If you're at Costco, you might as well make a quick pit stop here to check it out and try some of their yummy gelato!",_PN5byES4XWl2vTKLAN6dw,0,0,5,lYe6gdBEQmU5hQv485ZGkg

They also carry shakes and what really caught my attention was their English Shakes. They also carry cookies, cheesecake popsicles, churros and a myriad of other delicious products. The customer service is always great, the people who work there are cheerful and have a positive attitude. Even the owners are awesome; they seemed very down to earth and humble and they talked to their customers. Can you tell I love this place yet?",uZOvIc6r_rqlSTaulIYgJQ,0,0,5,zI15EOuwbKGvLC-XMuvyPQ

The ladies working here were very helpful to me and my son. I ended up getting the dole whip swirl cone which was great. I have never had one with vanilla.  It brought a richer creamier texture to my favorite dessert.,TMpzSLxJ-MnHT0Xvp0Cl_A,1,0,5,Hajifprh_Y6cKWOXEtUbvQ
3294829,2018-06-15,0,VjLwITncAngZjGnOL0prCA,"Credit card surcharge! Weak. As was the flavor of the milkshake.

If you have a killer product you might be able to get away with plundering your patrons for a credit card surcharge.

However when your prodcut is best described as mediocre being a little more customer friendly is probably a better path to take.",uhzu6cpBNkV-lxUwv-kGuA,2,0,1,3rpAY4Fl7xkrr1smZnvgww
3328893,2018-01-24,0,VjLwITncAngZjGnOL0prCA,"My husband and I had dinner in this shopping center and decided to stop into Sticks and Shakes to see what it was all about. 
First of all, the kids working were happy and positive, which is a big plus. They greeted us and asked if it was our first time. When we said yes, they gave us an overview of the menu, offered samples, and even commented on some of their more popular flavors and made suggestions as to what we may like. 
We went with the All Things Oreo shake to share. They have a few different sizes, but these treats are indulgent and I'd definitely recommend sharing or going with a smaller size! The shake was AMAZING. If you like Oreos, you would like it for sure! It was thick and had two hot Oreo churros and a regular Oreo on top. We took it to go (a short drive) and it was the perfect consistency by the time we got home. They give you an extra wide boba-style straw for the shakes which makes it easier to get all the candy or cookie bits. They have a variety of cookies and cupcakes from Freed's, chocolate covered bananas, and even cheesecake on a stick. We saw lots of things that we'll want to come back and try in the future! With Salted Malted closing a few months ago, I think Sticks and Shakes was the perfect addition to this area. A good place to grab a sugary treat with super friendly customer service. We'll definitely be back!",vbG9-F7u-WUbY9lfvadIJw,2,0,5,C5DKQbhndYGpiYnE4bfmIA

Not only do they have amazing gelato, they also have cakes, milkshakes, boba, churros, cupcakes, donuts, and other delicious desserts. Service was top notch and they allowed us to sample the gelato before making a final decision. I had the Birthday Cake and Nutella gelato, and my Mom had the pistachio. We were both very happy with our choices; very flavorful and creamy!

4273737,2018-04-24,1,VjLwITncAngZjGnOL0prCA,"My friend and I visited this past Sunday with our three kids. She and I chose cakes - the napolean and the strawberry shortcake. The kids had an ice cream cone, a shake, and a scoop in a cup. 

The 12oz shake was $5.95 just plain and any add ins were $1.25 each. That's ridiculous!  The vanilla was rich, buttery, and overly sweet to me. I did taste the coconut and lemon sorbet and thought they were good. 

Both cakes were horrible. $5.95 each and both tasted old, stale, and flavorless. I took one inside to let them know I was unhappy. The young lady said that since they were Freed's products and not theirs she could not do anything - no money back, no offer of an exchange, nothing. I told her that was very bad business, and no excuse as they were offering the products. I left my name and number with her and asked her to have the manager call me. She came out and said she called the manager, Mark Glassman I believe is his name, and that he would call me tomorrow.  No call received yet. 

We spent over $30 for treats for 5 of us, most of which were bad. Then to complain and not have any offer to make it better? Yep. You've lost customers and earned yourself two negative advertisers.",9P_ykmYyCBhNGcNvrmECfA,1,0,1,K9mSYmau_vDYYCSpzWTP7A

4528745,2018-02-02,0,VjLwITncAngZjGnOL0prCA,"Husband and I stopped by this place after yelp had recommended it to me. Outside is super cute and has string lights, inside is pretty in pink!! We were greeted with kindness and offered a sample of gelato. After reviewing the menu and all our options, we ordered cinnamon sugar donuts and all things Oreo shake. This is where the 4, and not 5 stars, come from. 2 items, cost $17.22!!! Are you kidding me, for freaking dessert?! 

The donuts were DELICIOUS but come on, how are you going to stay in business for charging such high prices? I understand you guys have a location on the strip, but you're off the strip now and are attracting locals with median incomes. If you make your way here, stop by the bank first!

I recommend getting the strawberry cheesecake bar as a shake. So yummy! I was charged an extra dollar for doing that though. It's just a little crazy to me that they charge extra for the little things like whipped cream/sprinkles and others.

Even so late at night there were options like eclairs and cake. My fiancé ordered a shake with a piece of cheesecake and a couple other toppings and he was very impressed. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it was about $16 for our two shakes, I could probably buy like 4 tubs of ice cream for that.

As a mom to a child who has a fairly good amount of food allergies, I truly appreciate the selection. Shakes of all different kinds, bobas, gelato, DOLE WHIP, cookies and cakes. There is legitimately something here for everyone.. even the pickiest of eaters. 

For a Saturday night, the place was quiet. The girls at the counter were friendly and SUPER patient with my 5 year old monster (yes, he was in a mood after dinner and still got ice cream *eye roll*). Toppings are free and like everything else, they have a great selection of them. ""Exotic"" candies that are primarily big in Europe are featured, too. 

A dole whip/vanilla swirl in a cone, one scoop of coconut sorbet and one of lemon was all we needed to satisfy our sweet tooth. It's nice to have another after dinner, dairy free treat option in the area.",mFHbNX5qhG5CREr9PqQqGQ,1,2,4,GU4RQJorDsDEcIbye_vH1g

 Dole whip. Tastes nothing like Disneyland. 
The one at Disneyland is more creamier like ice cream, this one was more like frozen yogurt and watery I was disappointed. Card surcharge is annoying even though it's 60 cents. Way over priced $24 for 2 SHAKES AND 1 CUP OF DOLE WHIP!!! 
The milkshakes all taste like vanilla ice cream with chocolate pieces in it.
