I couldn't imagine how long it would've taken had there been a line! Haven't been to Quizno's in a while but it seems like prices went up....don't remember a sandwich being 8 or 9 bucks!,zBi_JWB5uUdVuz3JLoAxGQ,1,0,3,xzxpPPEpK9OrKL0LbjmbyA

The only 2 open in vegas are on Durango and centennial, and Charleston and jones I think.

Super bummer I need to drive across town to get my quiznos especially since there is no togos in town.",wilYYikurjPDtA-0sTQ5vw,0,0,1,zEJGL8pKL_0dnHXFVAEbiQ

I also liked the fact that they had tables and chairs outside, so i didn't have to leave my dog in the truck and she got to come sit outside with us. Too bad this quiznos is far from our house, but if it was closer I'd come here more often...",-QViqz6QGfMLUYLY73lysg,0,1,5,3gIr8196FOOnQutxV-fjvA

It just seems so much more convenient to me to order the sandwich from the menu and they prepare it for me. Then I add the extra jalapeno peppers and peppercinis. Also I'm a big fan of their honey mustard sauce.",akEFRm7rqlxIANKyTlaTOg,0,0,5,9HDKHgxpugOOi8ic_AEkrQ
4338106,2014-07-11,0,HxOycKEgCl7aXjBsVs0t-w,I went here a while back and I forget what kind of sandwich I ordered but the guy put my meat in what looked like dirty dish water before whisking it away for whatever was the next step. I never went back.,ayOp6qKdplAs2ByKyAYiug,0,0,2,4HbvCNstqbYsvego4GRYHA

There's something I love about sandwich shops toasted bread. I of course got myself the large turkey sandwich with all the veggies. I just don't feel as guilty eating out at quiznos since it is not as unhealthy. There was only one employee which I kind of felt bad since it was crowded and she was having to hustle. She was still very friendly and patient with people as they were trying to make up their minds. The inside is clean for a small place and there are also table outside if you wanted to eat out there.

I give it 3 stars since the food is good and would definitely eat there again when getting car repairs.",1AYTQ-XpQwvbbShaXorsQA,1,0,3,nL7Gi2ieN8MRqzP8J-Cqkw
