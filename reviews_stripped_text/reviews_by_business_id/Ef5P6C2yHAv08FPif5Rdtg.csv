20121,2017-09-28,0,Ef5P6C2yHAv08FPif5Rdtg,Best new korean restaurant in Las Vegas.  Awesome side dishes and amazing lunch prices,siRMN6y-TcIJrwPsY_a9ig,0,0,5,f3APEWwtKfuYrkzp5mGQKA
23701,2017-12-11,0,Ef5P6C2yHAv08FPif5Rdtg,"Ok so let me start off by saying that we are regular customers at Hobak and we decided to try this place out and see what all the hype is about. So their were 5 in our party and we decided with the Large and small beef combo 2x brisket, short rib, ribeye, and skirt stk. The lady who served us our food had a name tag that said Trainee, so I was like this isn't going to be good. The Trainee took our order but didn't seem knowledgeable. She took our drink orders and we also ordered 5 Rice's for us and also 2 steamed egg 2 Tofu Bean soup. So they started bringing us our side dishes which looked promising. We began eating our side dishes and became thirsty. They didn't bring us any water and had to ask for water and she forgot that we ordered soda along with the water. Then we had to ask her for our rice that we ordered coz we were eating our sides without any rice. Then our faces were a mess because we didn't have any napkins and had to ask for napkins as well. So things are becoming a little irritating by now because we had to ask for all utensils and water, and our side dishes. 

So Trainee started cooking our food, again we ran out of our sides and had to ask for more. Trainee never said a word to us as she was cooking and she didn't properly divide the meats to our party. She cut the meats by half and their were 5 of us so the 3 of us got less meat and we had to ask her to split it up evenly. As she was cooking the smoke was getting in our faces because she didn't bring the vent down and I couldn't breathe which was unpleasant. As we were eating our brisket we asked for our 2nd steamed egg and bean soup and she said that it was coming out. I didn't understand why they just didn't bring all 4 of the soups out because the 5 of us had to try and split the two of the soups and it was just a hassle. My wife and I had to wait for the second set of soups before I could try it. 

When it was time for our ribeye another cook came. I guess a more experienced cook. I noticed that none of their employees had name tags. So our new cook is a slender buff Asian dude. This dude never introduced himself and just began cooking our food. He was a bit better than Trainee, he seemed like he knew what he was doing and at least he utilized the air vent. 

When we ate our meats and we all agreed that it didn't have as much flavor as we are accustom too. We heard that 8ounce meats were top notch but we felt that Hobak was much better than this place. 8ounce was super expensive for the type of service and quality of sides and meats we received. Their desserts are separate which was disappointing because their are other places that offer complementary desserts. Best thing about this place is the atmosphere. It's beautiful, clean and it's very modern but it will take more than looks to bring me back. We will NOT be coming back to this place nor recommend it to our friends. We get better service and better quality meats elsewhere!",tra04YToNONtiq1k2jlwfQ,1,1,2,5sQ1DibQAW9gHjhLmOSwwQ

The first spot I called to make a reservation didn't take same day reservations.........uh ok.    But in any case, I'm glad they didn't because if not, I wouldn't have found this gem.   Called up 8oz to make a reservation and we were all set.   

We rolled up and I got to say, this place was top notch all the way.   The service was on point the entire night.   Our server explained the menu and how everything worked and we were off.   The food came quickly and everything looked great.   It was also pretty cool that the server cooked all the food for you, so all you have to do is kick back and enjoy.   They even take the time to trim off any pieces of meat that get slightly burnt.....how's that for 5 star service?!?!?!  Everything we had that night was great, but a few stand outs were the boneless short rib.......OMG, probably the best that I've ever had.   Super juicy with amazing beefy flavor.   The Jap Che was also the best I've had.    The noodles weren't over cooked (like most places) and were perfectly chewy and the sauce was infused into every single bite.   Even the premium pork belly dipped into the cheese fondue was winnahs!

All in all, it was a great evening in a beautifully designed, chic new restaurant, with amazing food and good friends.    Thanks 8oz for ending our Vegas trip on such high note.   I'll be back in Vegas in 2 weeks for a convention and will be taking some friends and associates here for sure.",OHS9hVIOUBNKIcMeVukOdA,2,1,5,4-PSCtvKblHmEGtaa9-MnQ

1090089,2018-04-18,0,Ef5P6C2yHAv08FPif5Rdtg,"The food was good but the service needs to be better

Went there last night with a big party and the service has gone down hill.  

First the water jugs was empty and no one came to refill it, considering we had 2 people cooking at our table because we had a big party, its weird that no one notice the water containers was empty. 

Second, at one point the heat was up so high on one of our grills that the smoke was going right in to the face of 2 of our friends. This went on for like 5 min before i pulled the ventilator down closer to the food to stop the  the smoke.  So the waiter comes back, sees the the ventilator low and pulls it back up to continue cooking.  So after he pulls it back up the smoke starts going to the faces of my friends again. They were obviously waving their hands in front of their faces to get rid of the smoke. It was pork belly so the smoke was crazy... this goes on for another 5 min before the waiter realized what was going on and turned down the fire.

So after he turned down the fire and the pork belly coarse was done he tossed on the next pork dish.  So after he tossed it on, he never turned the fire back up.  So after 10 min of drinking and chatting with my friends i realize the the pork was not cooking at all and completely raw still.  

At this time i had to wave down another waiter to come and turn the fire back up so our food can continue to cook.

After they tuned the fire back up and finished cooking, they never stopped by to check on our waters and basically we had to flag someone down if we wanted anything because no one came and checked on us. 

All in all it wasn't a horrible experience, the food was good but the service was just so-so.

I took one star away for the smoke and raw meat on the grill for 10 min fiasco and another star for lack of attention after the meats were cooked.",wT6TPFGTwngiBbSbSrSWXg,0,0,3,7Qfl6lk9Ymc1-PZWkdMlOQ

First off, this spot is beautiful!! The owners spared no expense on the beauty and ambience here! Dark, yet lots of good lighting, high beamed ceilings, industrial with a warm feeling. Very pleasant inside.
Our many complimentary condiments came right away, and we could have gotten full on just the pickles, salad, fish cakes, potato salad- yum! Our server, Trustin was dreamy. He was so attentive and smiling and very passionate about the restaurant and the food! We ordered the Brisket and the Soy Garlic chicken. Having lived in Austin TX for four years- I know good brisket! So thinly sliced and lovingly arranged, came out within 5 minutes. Trustin prepared the meat to perfection, and we enjoyed it so much with the different sauces we had to choose from (didn't even need sauce) Next came the chicken, which Trustin again prepared, and explained how the meats were prepared and answered any questions we had while he was serving us. The chicken was delicious as well as very tender and juicy, which is becoming a problem with chicken these days... I rarely order it as usually it is tough and overcooked.
A couple last things fresh in my mind still about 8 oz- we got to meet one of the owners, TK Kim. He was so friendly, and great to chat with! Oh, and the desserts here!! We usually do not have room, but Trustin suggested I think it was Korean Frozen ice cream? It was unbelievable!! Please try it when you come here!!
One last thing- as the last reviewer mentioned- 8 Oz has no awful smoke and grease stench, and they have a great wine selection and full bar :) :)",N2HBRNm2YhtE1uH42MGjvA,1,2,5,9Q-lKTn5rDqh_4AzgGP4qg

We came here for dinner and it wasn't busy at all. We were greeted by a friendly hostess. We got seated and our server literally didn't even say a word to us.  He also didn't look too happy to be working there. Mind you, they had literally just opened for a week or two so I would assume they would be a little more welcoming. He didn't give us recommendations or anything, just came back after like 2 mins and asked if we were ready to order. Water wasn't given to us until way after he placed our order. He cooked really quickly and didn't give us napkins, so I asked for napkins and he literally just placed a stack in the middle of the table and ran away. I'm not really begging for excellent service but because of their price and ambiance, I would assume they would have better service than let's say a $15 AYCE KBBQ place. I don't think our server said more than 5 words to us. I wasn't paying attention to the other table he was serving, which were Koreans. I was thinking maybe language barrier he couldn't really talk to us, but it looked like he was the same way with that table.

The quality of the meat, especially the brisket and the pork belly were a lot better. The brisket was amazingly juicy, the pork belly was so thick and delicious, and the spicy short rib and the kkot-sal were both very tender and flavorful.

Came here for dinner on a Thursday around 9:30PM and it was pretty crowded. They take reservations by phone so plan ahead if you have a large group. 

They provide a lot of tasty side-dishes but one thing that stands out was the kimchi stew that came out with the combo! It was very VERY well-made. The soup-base was perfect! I highly recommend getting that option.

Service was amazing - I like places that cook the meat for you because then they take care of portion distribution.

Typical places on Spring Mt. have a reputation of very low customer service but this place was refreshing. Quality of food was great. They changed out the grill for each meat. Ventilation is great.

1993787,2018-01-20,0,Ef5P6C2yHAv08FPif5Rdtg,"First time trying this place and I am conflicted. First off, I love the decor and overall look of the place, very modern and looks like a fancy steak house. 

No complaints with the quality of the food at all, everything we ordered we really enjoyed. The issue is with the service:

We got there around 7 and they were pretty packed, we were seated immediately and sides were brought out right away. Then we sat there for a long while waiting for the waitress to come to take our orders. She was very friendly but the rest of the service was not the best:
-we asked for two glasses with ice which never came
-we had to ask for napkins twice
-we had to stop a staff and ask for drink re-fills and for more sides, they never came back to re-fill our waters
-the guy that cooked our meats was very messy, he dumped the whole plate of garlic steak on the grill then put the pork belly right on top...I did not like the fact that the placed the non-marinated pork belly on the same grill as the garlic steak
-they were so busy they just throw the meats on the grill, never told us what we were eating
-we ended up grilling our own meat half the time because they rarely came back to check on us
-we ordered lobster which never came

It was obvious that they were under-staffed, towards the end of our meal when a few tables have left, they came more often and cooked out meats. I felt that the female staff were great, Bora cleared out dirty plates, asked us if everything was ok, and cooked our meats neatly. Whereas the guys were very unfriendly, we asked for stuff and even though they did give us what we asked for they never reply to let us know that they heard us, they simply walked away which is rude. 

I realize that this is in Chinatown and I usually don't expect much service from Chinatown, but the place is nice looking and gives a fancier vibe so I expected more service wise. Also, for the price we paid service should have been better. 

I really like the place and the quality of the food, but service really annoyed me. There are cheaper KBBQ places with better service.",7svBs9qqPJHPRXZ56Q3ZuQ,1,1,3,2to8ZGidgfYcaIYqRosgPg

I am one who appreciates and values great customer service. After being asked how many in our party, we were taken to our seats. As we were seated, our waitress asked us what she could get for us to drink. After ordering our drinks all our wonderful side dishes started arriving immediately. Wonderful, beautiful and delicious banchan!!! My husband and I decided on the 2 persons beef and pork meal. Which came with a side of vegetable skewer, cheese fondue, gyeran Jjim (steamed egg), and a choice of soup. Which my husband and I decided on doenjang-Jjigae (Korean soy bean stew)... absolutely delicious! Then our waitress fired up the grill and the next think I knew, she came out with a wonderful beautiful plate of beef brisket. This plate was gorgeous! You could see the beautiful marbles of fat through out the meat. Grilled to perfection dipped in some wonderful sauces made my mouth very happy!! As soon as we were finishing up our brisket, our waitress started on our next plate of meat. Rib fingers, can we say OMG!! First time ever having these (never even knew they existed). Next round was our beef belly (delicious also). Boneless short rib was next on the agenda and we finished off with the pork bulgogi. We were in meat heaven!

2029926,2017-11-12,3,Ef5P6C2yHAv08FPif5Rdtg,"We visited this week for my sister's belated birthday celebration. We were able to call in a reservation for a party of 8 for dinner with no trouble, at all. When we arrived, we were seated promptly and taken to our table. The only odd part was that we were in an enclosed section with two tables - 4 guests at each table. No big though. 

What was absolutely amazing was the price. I have recently been trying to transition from AYCE to higher quality a la carte restaurants. I tend to overeat at AYCE and create crazy unwanted stomach problems for myself (TMI?). Anyway, we ordered a Combo C, which comes with brisket, bulgogi, skirt steak, pork belly, and lobster or short rib (we opted for the short rib after hearing from friends that it was the better deal). This also included the usual banchan (kimchee, fish cakes, salad, potato salad, etc), kimchi pancake, cheese fondue with veggies, and choice of soup. I had a long a week, so I added a bottle of rice wine to my order. My husband and I also ordered our usual diet sodas. At the end of the meal, our half (we split with Ghia G and her husband) came to $72 WITH TAX AND TIP. And we were full, but not broke from dinner... so we were happy. 

Server was very attentive. He came by often so we were rarely in need of a banchan or beverage refill. He even alerted us when the meat was ready or starting to overcook at times when we were distracted by conversation. 

The interior is bright and spacious. 

PRO TIP AND RELATED SIDENOTE: I walked in with hair in sock bun that was dirty AF. I probably should have watched it the day before, but I didn't knowing I was going to be immersing myself in meaty smoke soon. I also walked in wearing all black, ready for any meat stainage. However, when I walked out, I was pleased to find very minimal smoke smell. Props to their ventilation! 

In short, a great time was had by all.",5DFshFQlbQiQTvtzH7qwlA,5,3,4,JT8n3-RuN0xpqra5rx3hig

The place is easy to find and plenty of parking spaces around. 

They have lunch special M-F with great prices lunch combo starts at $9. Alsobhave soju, beers and other alcoholic drinks from the bar. I decided to order the Beef Bimbimbap on hot stone $11. My husband ordered the combo Kalbi and Tofu Soup $14. Our dishes were presented beautifully, great details and of course, they were all delicious. They also gave 12 different side dishes with the meal! How generous. Fresh kimchi, fish cake, some vegetables, spicy octopus, seaweed salad, mashed potatoes, shredded marinated beef and Korean omelete. 

The server took good care of us right from the beginning and recommended some dishes to us to try. He also made sure our water and tea were always topped up! 

Prices for lunch are very reasonable for the amount of food you are getting. I do wish they have lunch special available on Saturday and Sunday since this is a 24 hours city and many people here work on the weekends; I am sure they will appreciate Lunch Special. 

They offered to pack my leftover for me to take home along with the additional side dishes. Overall, a wonderful experience we had here. 

Food was a 5 stars quality and definitely one on our list to keep coming back to.

Update 10/7/2017: we tried their package beef combo and it was worth it! It comes with: Beef Brisket, Prime ribe with bone in, tofu soup, steam egg in hot pot, salad, veggies, couple side dishes including kimchi and rice.

At the end of the day, with burgers and steaks, I'm not so much concerned about all the gimmicky frills, I just want my meat perfectly seasoned, cooked, and presented. All of which 8oz nailed.

Fellow yelper Rica M.'s birthday celebration was pushed out, but I had been salivating over photos of this place for the whole week already. My husband and I decided to eat here anyway. Ryan was our server and he was engaging, informative, and cooked our meat perfectly! I know some reviews mention some difficulty with the quantity of food, but we really found the meal set we got for two people was more than filling and we had enough left over to go. The banchan here is slightly upgraded from the ACYE joints and they give you a soup option as well - we went with the tofu soup. The only  thing I would point out is that the tofu soup did have shellfish and seafood, which neither the menu or the servers pointed out, so those with allergies or aversions to shellfish/seafood beware. The dessert at the end of the meal was a cheesecake shaved snow cream with chocolate, which allows you to end your meal on something not so heavy. I'm not a huge meat eater, but I did like the quality of the meats we ordered and the service/cooking of these meats better than what I've had at Hobak. I also like the restaurant area and ambiance of this place a bit better, and for now, wait times are very reasonable to non-existent. 

We ended up going back with a party of 8 a week later to celebrate Rica's birthday (see Regina I.'s detailed review!). We were split into two tables of 4, which was fine. We found the larger family meal big enough for the 4 of us at our table and didn't find the need to order more meats. I was hoping Ryan could be our server again, but we ended up with someone else who was a bit busier and not as attentive (they also had to juggle our two tables and all the other parties they had though).

Out of all the steak places I've been (not just kbbq) this is the first time that every cut lacked tenderness. Additionally, the portions...I mean...I can understand small if the meat quality is high, but it was just small tough, chewy portions of meat.

The waiter didn't give us the time of day, made fun of me when i asked for specific things that we often get at Korean restaurants such as Side dishes. 
Then proceeded to watch me cut the fat off of all the meat we were eating. Served the meats to us when they were not even cooked throughly. Take it now I like my steak medium rare but not mooing! 
The food was bland and expensive for the smallest portions of meat I've ever seen! The side dishes were non existent hence my reason for asking for them.

ask the server for some direction of portions! i felt like my party didn't and regretted how big some of the portions were! the price point is similar to hobak and magal in town and despite my five star rating, i can't say this spot is better than either of those. 

when we got here they said the bar items were not available to the full extent yet because everything was being created still. however, it was a good experience and we will definitely come back when they have more established in terms of their bar and food menus. 

only thing we didn't care for was the steamed egg and kimchicheegae because despite how much we love those two sides normally, they weren't prepared right here. the steamed egg was too dry and not fluffy at all. texture was harder and dry, lacked flavor and overall was bland. the kimcheechigae tasted lackluster too because it was way too salty with lack of much content. 

they came with our combo so we just didn't care much for them... however, everything else was quite good and worth having! combos had a good blend of different choice cut meats and sides.",KxuNoB6BaSboVkYQ0T4w7A,0,2,5,RX8S3o9GIYSeOWZXQPZJtg

I didnt believe it, of course. As grown up in northern and SoCal , I have been to many Korean BBQ joints in LA, like Park's, khd, quarters, and I am always around them with my Korean friends and I thought I knew Korean BBQ very well.  I couldn't believe it until I came here finally and see it with my eyes. Yes, they were right, and this restaurant takes Korean BBQ to the next level.  Food, taste, quality of meat, atmosphere, service, cleaness, music, everything is amazing. If I have to pick three things I like most, it is Quality of meat, quality of meat, and quality of meat.  Their quality of meat is amazing!! 

We went vegas couple weeks ago, it was saturday night.  The restaurant is a little off the street, kinda hidden. as we entered, I was immediately knew that my friends were right.  the place was busy, greeted right away and waited for about 15 minutes for the table (Although I should have done the reservation through fb). 

Cool, industrial, modern, super clean hip atmosphere.. great sound system, they even have full bar and we sat at bars until our table is ready.. (my friend didn't tell me about bar)

Our server Howon, kindly went through their menu. Their menu was very simple; beef combo, pork combo and 8oz combo.  8oz combo has beef, pork and seafood mixed.  We ordered beef combo large, it was more than enough for 4.  Food came out timely, Howon takes care of us from the start to end, he pay attention to every little details.  Amazing services, very well trained staff. He explained which one is certified Angus beef, prime and wagyu. quality of meat, again amazing.  These guys know how to marinate, prepare, display and how to cook at the table. Howon explained little things like sauces, banchan.. maybe we look very new to kbbq.. haha.. their banchan is very fresh and has lots of flavor. radish wrap, kimchee, kimchee pancake, salads.. everything way better than any kbbq I ever tried.

Manager Jay stopped by our table multiple times to make sure everything is ok.. he picked up used napkins, empty bowls, we were treated as VIP.. 

They gave us free dessert, chocolate shaved ice.  they said this is free as their grand opening special and for limited time only.

We will definitely come back soon. We sometimes go hobak when we come to vegas and it was just okay.. it was always excused because we are not in LA. Now we found the best korean bbq in LV and happy to share my experiences.",JmLK-1LtnHcU7PCdQqrAAg,1,0,5,fd1JZn1Cd9KGE5P8h7oNPg

We got the pork and beef combo small combo which came with bulgogi, pork cheek, belly, and short rib.  We came for lunch so had no problem getting a seat.  The banchan during the meal came with the typical offerings, and also included either soybean, spicy tofu, or kimchi soup.  We also got a complimentary refill on a few banchan which is nice.  And not to mention a large shaved ice for dessert.  The menu includes many meat combos all priced around the $60-90 range depending on party size.  But in my opinion, the small can serve 3 comfortably.  They also have soju for $12.75 (a little steep in my opinion), but necessary for all Korean BBQ meals.  In summary, the short rib was fantastic and a must get at 8 oz.  The portions were good and the banchan offered a few nice additions like bean sprouts and kimchi cake that you might not typically see at other BBQ joints.  Downside was the sauces weren't very spicy and the other meats were tasty but nothing crazy.

We got a beef set and a pork set to share between 6 people. We finished all of it and the portion size was good. I had to tap out near the end though. I'd try to come again soon since we came during soft opening. My favorite dish was probably the short ribs. Their meat is comparable to all the al la carte places.

A5 Kobe was like butter.  Worth every penny.    Every single meat was tender,  juicy and not over powered with flavor.  Perfect balance.  All the meats we ordered,  which were brisket,  galbi,  salted rib, and the A5 were Marbleous!! The complimentary dessert was as amazing as the kobe beef. Do not skip it.  Unlike any shaved ice you've ever had.  It was light,  flavor and refreshing.

Worth every penny.  Considering we ordered the kobe,  it was a bit on the high end but like I said.  Worth it!  Even if we didn't order the kobe beef.  The quality of the meats really are a standout and a highlight of this place.  I'd rather pay the extra dime for the high quality meat this place has to offer than cheap quality from an all you can eat.

The interior is modern and nice for a Korean bbq . 

We ordered one of the combo sets and were kind of disappointed . Our servers seemed like they were new or in training . They forgot our stew side and we had ordered cold spicy noodle and it  didn't come until we asked them . We also didn't get our steamed egg . The manager took the spicy noodle off the bill for the inconvenience and we didn't ask for that . Also he gave us a free dessert which was a shaved ice with chocolate dust . 

The sides kept coming after we would eat them. They have cold soup (radish water ) which we love love love . There version is a little sweet which is ok . We got 2 different salad options as sides as well . They don't have cheesy corn but do have a cheesy fondue which works great with the beef almost like a Philly cheesesteak when dipped into the cheese . 

The meats were good but nothing to write home about . We had the scallops and lobster as well which were cooked in a butter bomb . 

There are positives . The ambience is nice . The service was attentive even if disjointed . They have all the alcohols that one would want ... wine / Korean beers and a wide selection of other beers . The price point and value are pretty good . It is very clean inside as well .

When we got to the host stand we were guided to our table and before I was about to sit there was food on the chair. While standing there and staring at the food, the host did absolutely nothing to ask what's wrong. So I had to ask him to wipe down the chair. All he did was swipe it onto the floor with his hand and walked away. We sat at the end of the chair away from the food stain because we were waiting on him to come back and wipe it with a sanitized towel but he never came back and as I'm halfway into my meal we are still sitting on the edge of our seats. 

As our server came to greet us we ordered 2 drinks on their menu, he checked our IDs and went away. BY THE WAY, There was no greeting what so ever. Not even a ""Hello"" or ""how are you."" Just straight into ordering.  

He came back and told us he cannot make the drinks and we would have to wait a little bit for them to be made because the bartender was gone. So I asked to speak to the manager, hoping he can make them, who was also gone. It's ridiculous how they have a bar menu and bar seating with no one knowing how to make any of the menu drinks.

To make things simpler for us I asked to order a well cranberry vodka and how much that would cost. 5 minutes later he tells me it's $10. I said that's ridiculous and no thank you. He comes back to me a few minutes later and said ""Nvm, it's $8."" So when I finally agreed for it to be made, he immediately says he cannot make it because he doesn't even know if they have cranberry juice. Why did you waste 10minutes of my time figuring out the price when you knew I was never going to be able to order it? 

Finally, I asked the shift leader if they have any cramberry juice. He says, ""yes it's only for cocktails though. And cant be used in a mix with vodka."" He also mentioned customers can't even purchase cranberry juice by itself. Anyway, If cranberry vodka is not a cocktail then I don't know why they even have cranberry juice in stock.

The manager finally came in at the end of the meal and he told me yes they can make cranberry vodkas and yes they sell cranberry juice separately... except they don't have any in stock. He ended up making us the original 2 drinks we ordered... at the end of our meal. 

At least you tried... and the food tastes great.

The only reason I'm giving 2 stars instead of 1 is because they at least tried to make a drink and the manager apologized when he finally arrived at the end of our meal. 

Tip to management: if you cant provide cocktails to your guests... then don't hand them a cocktail menu right when they are seated and it would have never been a problem.",4OXKBjovtiDnQh0W_YOymg,0,0,2,btRIA32eZwyARNUCDRvIaA

The servers cook everything for you, which I guess is one of the reasons they call themselves better than other Korean BBQ places, but when I told our server that the meat was ready she took so long to cut and serve it that it was practically well done pieces of meat.

They stated that a reservation isn't needed since the wait would be no longer than 15 minutes.  Sweet!  15 minutes in nothing.  We arrived, and it was dead.  We didn't even wait 5 minutes to be seated.  Like the rest of the KBBQ restaurants out here, banchan is included with the meal.  But for me, it's all about the meat.  Meals come in 8 Ounce Combos, Beef or Pork Combos, and Chicken & Fish.  3 of us shared the Small Beef Combo for $59 and added the Soy Garlic Chicken for $22.  The small beef combo came with brisket, marinated short-rib, and seasoned boneless short-ribs.  Our server was also our cook.  He explained that each meat serving was 8 ounces and the chicken was around 12 ounces.  Either I was starving or the we really didn't get 36 ounces of food.  We shared the food evenly and I was still hungry.  All meats were prepared the way each of us requested.  As for quality and taste, the marinated short-rib was my favorite.  Overall, 8 Ounce Korean Steak House is a great addition to Chinatown.  I'm a fan of 8 Ounce Korean Steak House, especially since there is no wait.",y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ,10,11,4,OAshdfqoDU94_9JsrTXvRQ

Service: The server assigned to us was great from beginning to end.  Dishes were brought out timely and he cooked all courses of our package beef combo perfectly.  He would slice the meat and lay it out of on the grill individually for everyone dining.  Edged parts of the beef that were flamed to black were trimmed off to ensure we were eating the best parts. This attention to detail was evident in the service throughout the night.  VIP service at your table is what it felt like.

Korean BBQ & Banchan/side dishes: Typical Banchan offerings were all fresh and tasty.  The opening salads were especially fresh, and the Kimchee tofu soup and the steamed egg were my favs.  The package beef combo portions we ordered for 4 people was great.  The brisket and the beef short rib is the best I've had in Vegas so far, bold statement I'll stick by.  The quality of meat is evident in the taste and it's a great dining experience

Ambiance: I really appreciated the size of the tables as there was plenty of room for all the numerous dishes that typically pile up quickly at Korean bbq.   The dining area is very spacious, and has a high end industrial styled contemporary upscale vibe.  Lots of brick walls, wood and contemporary lighting. It's definitely upscale enough but comfortable. Think 'business' casual. =)  The fully stocked bar is attractive and the cool lighted ""8"" sign on the wall screams for social media attention.

This is a classy place to kick back some Korean BBQ with your friends for the evening.  8oz is my current Vegas Valley Korean bbq restaurant champ for the evenings.  The pics are great, but 8oz is definitely better in person.  No catfishing here. lol Enjoy yourself..it's a celebration =)",AyjqBovADgbskmLrIBOMlQ,3,0,5,kvGen7i7G-EjqvcniRo3Rw

However, I really like the vibe this restaurant gives- typical Korean environment, makes the experience different to all the rising Korean restaurants. 

I ordered their kkotsal. It was given in a big portion. I thought it was enough to share between two girls, considering they give different kinds of side dishes. However, unless you order a course, if you only order one meat, they do not offer any soups, which was a disappointment for me, since the portion was already enough meat for us. Also, the service was exceptionally good. Jackson was very kind and prompt with our needs.

I just wish their drink prices were a little lower since they are more expensive than most of the other places. But other than that, I loved everything. I cant wait until their bar opens and they open till late night.",s01liMq8lG4G3f3AvJMi5w,2,1,4,-NPocfCbbj0Dr6K_Zvo86A

We ended up getting the tofu soup and that was probably one of the best tofu soups I've ever had! My favorite meat had to be the Kalbi but it was cool to see a whole ribeye grilled over the flame tabletop! Food was delish and they even provided a chocolate shaved ice dessert.

But before I talk about him let's talk about my and my boyfriend's experience. We tried it cause it's the newest thing on the block. Come in and got greeted and seated right away. The menu was explain to us on the choices. We could do combos or al la carte. As a couple we chose combo A: small. It came with four types of mouth watering types of cuts from beef and porks( all of which are marinated to godly perfection). Assisting the cuts are 6-8 side dishes that are not included cause it comes FREE. Combo is also assisted with veggie kabob, steamed eggs, cheesy fondue, and your choice of soybean soup or kimchi stew. Oh and kimchi pancake so yum yum. What makes everything special was our caring server. He grilled our meat and know actually when it was done for the fancy,finest flavor. Like our beef brisket which ( don't laughed) tasted like the finest and I mean like if you tasted a $100 burger  but in many thin layers of oh my Jesus. Ryan was very informative about the restaurant and he entertained while cooking for us. We shared laughter and conversate and we learn he is an inspiring film maker.

This was the only KBBQ restaurant we found last minute who would take a reservation for 18 people on a Saturday night. LoL. So glad to have found this place.  It's fairly close to the strip right in the heart of Chinatown.   They've got plenty of parking so no need to worry if you're driving.  The place itself is really clean and modern. Love their ventilation system. We didn't leave the place smelling like we marinated our clothes in meat. They have several combo options depending on what kind of meat you are craving. The waitress cooked our food for us. Poor thing. She was having to go from table to take to turn the meats non stop. The meat is very flavorful. Loved it! The staff is friendly and attentive as well. 

Only downers I can report is the price. It's quite pricey. Their largest combo is for 4 people. So if you're with a large party be prepared to drop a pretty penny on this food.  We were also bummed that it's not an all you can eat restaurant. The portions are kind of small even for 4 people. A small skewer of veggies was like $4. Lol! Crazy! I feel like dinner took us forever because the waitress was cooking the food instead of us.

There was so many side dishes and that was awesome. The Kalbi meat was tender and really good. The tofu soup was ok to me. They didn't have a lot of seafood in it, it was mostly tofu. My lunch combo came out to be $16. That's a bit more steep in price than other Korean places I go to for lunch. The restaurant is very clean and nicely decorated inside. If you want to drink their bar is very nice! So I recommend going to the bar to grab drinks here if you want.

Exceptional service and the food was great. I've been here twice and my experience was positive both times.

Food - let's start with the con. With all of the KBBQ places in Vegas, you may notice a lot of them are AYCE. Well this is not one of them. You'll need to order a la carte or choose a combo. 

Unfortunately they are not flexible with adjustments on these combos. I wish they'd allow changes and just have the guest pay the difference if the meat is more expensive or something. It took a bit to decide because each combo id have one portion that I didn't like or something.

Pro? Meat is very fresh because it isn't AYCE. I definitely notice the quality of meat is better. As you may expect, this comes with the caveat of premium pricing. I think the cheapest combo was around $80 but fed 3-4 people. If you're splitting amongst a group, it really isn't that bad. 

Service was exceptional as I mentioned. Both times I came, staff members were attentive and helpful with the cooking and changing of grills. Water and side dish refills were happening! The first time we came during dinner time too, so the great service was happening during a busy time.

Can't remember if Buzzfeed voted this place as most ""worth it"" on the episode... but personally, I think it's worth it!",os-sDQoh-hCt2Lg76z6ZUA,5,2,5,Vcno8AsiZ5fQL2DE9rdFnA

She chatted with us while she cooked our food.  She also kept refilling the side dishes.  My favorite is the potato salad and radish.  My sister loved the fried  zucchini and tofu.  Everything was delicious.  The place is so clean and their meats are fresh and tasty.  Although the brisket doesn't have any taste to it,  dipping it in salt/pepper and sesame oil is really good.  The kalbi meat is marinated in soy sauce and other condiments.  The flavors are so tasty.  We also had the boneless short ribs (my least fave).  It was good but not as great as the kalbi or brisket.  The desert we had was amazing.  It's a must-try dessert.  It's flavored shaved ice dusted with cocoa powder and drizzled with condense milk.  Yummy!!! Overall, we were not disappointed.

It was a Saturday night and they were slammed so this is big because a lot of places take a while to notice when people walk in. We were seated in about 5 minutes and given time to look at the menu. They have a straight forward menu which is easy to navigate. No frills. We picked combo c because it had the option for lobster which we've never seen at k-BBQ. All of the food was delicious and they had so many sides to go with it. The server was attentive and constantly made sure we had what we needed. What we liked was it seemed that every table or two had their own server who stayed with just them. Our server bounced between us and the table next to us so we didn't have to cook any of it ourselves. She carried on a conversation with us and explained items when we'd ask. The only thing that kind of bummed my husband out was that they never brought out the cheese fondu, kimchee soup or other of those sides but we did receive the salads and dips. Now i say only kind of bummed him out because we didn't even realize until our 3rd meat because we'd received so many other side dishes that we lost track.

Our personal experience for a party of 6 at 5pm on a weekday was excellent. The service was well paced, the food quality was excellent, the side dishes were always filled, the water was refilled promptly, and the pitchers of beer were nice and cold. I thought for sure there would not be enough food especially since they recommended we only order 2 of the 2 person combos even though we were are party of 6. I was fully prepared to add more food. We were pleasantly surprised that there was the perfect amount of food especially with the extras that came with each combo. The steamed egg and tofu soup that came with the combo were yummy. I've had better kimchi pancakes, but it was still a nice extra. The person cooking the meats for us was very attentive and cooked everything nicely. As she cooked, she kept an eye out for getting our side dishes refilled. She told us which meat she was cooking each time.  The variety of side dishes were great. The seasonings on the beef and pork were not overwhelming since there was no need to hide poor quality meat like some places. I didn't have to drink a ton of water like the cheap places that season heavily. The presentation of the single person dessert (kind of a snow ice) in a martini glass was cute but $7.50 is a little steep.  It tasted pretty good though..
We made reservations and it was great to walk in with the table set up with all the sides already on the table. The range hoods were not super loud and worked as best as any of the bbq places can. Yes it's a little pricey but we felt it was worth it. Maybe because it was not busy or maybe we lucked out with our server, but we had great service.

Its not AYCE and I am totally good with that. It's not that kind of place and it's definitely worth it. The quality of the cuts of meat were amazing. We had flank steak, brisket, kalbi and the server even cut the meat off the bone so cleanly. It's a great place to drink some soju and beer and eat some meat.

We were greeted by the hostess, and got seated quickly. Our server, Dabin was awesome! It was our first time there, she showed us recommendations, from the meats to the drinks. and we took it all.

It wasn't awkward at all! 
One thing I didn't like was the brisket.. maybe we kept it on the fire for too long, it didn't have flavor and it was dry. It's also the thinnest meat you can get. Probably won't get that again. 

I can't even remember the drinks that we had .. but it was a smooth sake and Korean beer and another beer my boyfriend got. It goes hand in hand while eating Korean food ! And the beer and sake goes well together ! They didn't have the actual beer that my boyfriend wanted.. but he liked what he had.

We brought our daughter and we were raving about this place when she came to visit us before New Year, as her favorite restaurant when visiting Vegas is Hobak. 

We were disappointed with the loud music, we even asked if they can turn it down but fell on deaf ears. The women's restroom was out of soap and mentioned it on my way out to one of the employees. In my opinion, they should have checked before they opened for the day. 

Lastly, the set menu does not include dessert anymore but we wanted our daughter to experience it.   It was a bit disappointing on this visit. 

Hobak, move over there's a new best korean bbq in town. We got turned around looking for the place as we did not set our navigator. It's located just off of spring mountain behind a furniture store.

The decor was modern and clean,  ambiance was nice as you can actually converse while enjoying your dinner.

They have an array of selection of set menus for parties of 2 or more. The meats are tender, melts in your mouth. The flavors are undescribably good. The sides included are a variety of vegetables,  pickled radishes and of course to top it all was dessert. We did not get to take picture except for the dessert which was shaved ice with powdered chocolate on top, its a simple creation but it made a big impact.

Did I say our server David was very attentive and always had a smile on his face. My only suggestion is that,  maybe they can tell us what meat was being cooked. Also, when the lady brought the desert to our table she just set it down without saying anything. We had to ask what it was since we did not order dessert but I guess it came with the set. That's the reason for the 4 star. I think it just lacks a bit of conversation from staff to customers. 

I will definitely be back sooner than later.",APJZG-Mt2VklE63dJOiiZQ,2,0,3,WPfwgd6qpfnix0XPcwB7gA

The texture of the meat was delicious.. but dipping into their sauces made for a perfect combination. We had their peach soju shots which made the meats tasted even better.

The decor inside is really nice and new.  What sucked about our table was that even though we reserved for 8 people, they gave us a table for 6 and another table for 4.  We couldn't all sit together because we can't move the tables with the grills.  

We ordered a large beef combo, a small beef combo, 2 orders of japchae, 3 orders of kimchi fried rice and an additional order of pork belly.  The food came out relatively quickly and our server did most of the cooking for us.  The large beef combo came with beef brisket, a rib-eye steak, bulgogi and marinated short rib.  The short rib was really flavorful and tender.  The steak was well marbled and was extremely juicy as well.  everything we had was delicious.  The japchae had tons of veggies in it and was seasoned perfectly.  The kimchi fried rice was a little bland.  It could have used more flavor or ingredients.  

What sucked about our meal was that they didn't know how to split our order evenly between the two tables.  The table of 2 got the small beef combo which is meant for 2 people, and the table of 6 got the large combo meant for 3-4 people.

The name says it all, all portions are 8 ounces or combination of 8 ounces.

The menu is simple, beef or pork cuts, some marinated some not. No Asian delicacies, such as intestines and offal.  All can be ordered individually or for the best value, as sets that also includes some veg, egg stew, cheese fondue, and either a kimchi or soy bean stew.  Large selection of well made banchan accompanies the meal.  

In general, the beef quality ranges between USDA select and choice (OBV exception for the Japanese A5 wagyu and short rib (USDA Prime).  Pork is just pork. No special breed.  Marinades tend to the sweeter side but are very good once grilled and eaten with some spicy banchan.  

Top choices, the marinated big bone shortrib, boneless short ribs, and outside skirt, pork jowls and pork bellies.  Other selections are KBBQ standard.

Service is definitely a work in progress.  Take full control. Don't ask questions, place an order, let the server know you will do the cooking.  Service will improve as service conference improves.

Lunches also served. Not sampled however the menu shows the number of tofu hot pots, soups, and stone pot bibimbap all at reasonable prices ($9-$11).

It's a solid effort, but does not topple the best in the valley.  In the end, the quality and flavor of the side dishes overshadow the quality of the KBBQ.  All together it makes for an agreeable meal but carnivores and purist will beg for better quality and sourcing.

We had 6 meats (4 beef, 2 pork) and each was fantastic, fresh and you can really tell that they use prime meat as they state. While the brisket was a top contender for me, the outside skirt steak was by far the most favorite of the table (we ordered a second serving).

Overall the food was fantastic, and I hope that they will add brown rice to their menu. The server (Bora) made the experience even better, as I have heard from friends that the service can be hit or miss. 

The atmosphere seemed to be very friendly and welcoming, Bora even took photos of our group for us. I understand that KBBQ is cooking at the table, but I wonder if there could be any improvement to the ventilation or filters to prevent a large amount of that smell transferring to your clothes?

I can imagine that the parking situation could be difficult during busy times.

The bathroom was very clean, and I like that the wash station is outside of the bathrooms so that you do not have to wait for an empty bathroom to wash up.

I was a bit hesitant because I'm all for all you can eat but this isn't one of them. I thought if their meats are only portioned then they have better serve great customer service and their food better be good. Lol
I ordered the small beef combo with brisket, short ribs, and skirt steak. With that they offer you either soy bean soup, Tofu soup, or kimchee soup, took the kimchee soup. Depending how much people are at your table they give you steamed buns! If you have three people you get three pieces, or two people you get two pieces. The sides for dinner is limited; it commonly came with kimchee, broccoli, and potato salad. Their chives salad is very good with the rice and meat. They provide multiple sauces for you. Also, their kimchee pancakes are delicious, you have to pay extra if you want more. They bring out the meat and cook it right in front of you, if there are any burnt marks they cut it off for you! They bring out a steamed egg as well for your party to enjoy. I ordered a citron sake during my first visit with friends so our total came out to $90 with tax and tip. But when I came back with my fiancè with just ordering the combo my total came out to $70 with tax and tip. 

Quality wise it is worth it and I get very full because of the continuous refill of our sides. If you're not a sides person and just goes straight in with the meat and rice then you won't get full - in my opinion because of the quantity of meat. However, utilize the steamed egg, soups, salads, sides, pancakes, and buns they give you beforehand to kind of fill you up! I'll be back here it's a good place, they're not as busy right now because I don't think a lot of people know about them yet.",80qYPp6Fk_jmO3334DKGGg,4,1,5,FhsFkMqBrojTYhDG2lIEjA

The place is a bit? pricey but you get what you pay for. Definitely not your average KBBQ place. ?The food was top quality and we even? ordered their A-5 Kobe since it was my husband'?s birthday. Might as well go big or go home for these sort of events. 
The place was a bit empty when we went there. There was another couple there. You choose what sort of combo you want depending on how many people you have in your party. By the way, the serving sizes are pretty big. We chose the two people option, but we were stuffed by the time we got the Kobe served to us. So, yes, the two option combo is more than enough food.
Our server cooked everything for us, which got a tad awkward because it wasn't busy enough for him to keep him busy with something else.
Otherwise, the place is great! Definitely will come back here again.",rTSBDuGLi3rKojaeEwzZ9w,0,0,5,Y1-q_tdWKtfAxWd_ruMnFQ

The service was on point, the atmosphere and ambiance was on point, and most importantly the food was on point. Being Korean American, it's my humble opinion that this is the best Korean BBQ experience in Las Vegas. We sprung for the Kobe beef which was buttery and delicious!! Obviously because of the price it'll be a once in awhile thing but the bulgogi was also soooo good. Kimchijeon (kimchi pancake), gyeran-jjim (steamed egg), and soondubu (kimchi tofu stew) were delicious as well and of course the banchan was amazing as well. We will be back for sure! Maybe next weekend again :) Thank you so much for the wonderful food and customer service!!!",WyDRzSAMCXub94L_cBJg3g,0,0,5,da-VKWoovg-CN05rmVgbHg

Our server, named Bo, I believe, was impeccable. Above and beyond for service for us that day! We were very happy with him.

As soon as I looked at the menu, it reminded me of Hobak. I don't usually have non-AYCE KBBQ anyway, so Hobak is one of the few that I have been to. There was actually a lot of food for us. It may be because it was the first meal of the day for me, but I think I was pretty much there after the first food item, out of 4. I texted a friend to come by and help us finish, lol.

We got the A set. Small is 4oz and large is 8oz. It comes with 4 items: beef brisket, outside skirt, grilled marinated pork bulbogi, and premium pork belly. There are 4 pork belly items you can choose from, by the way. We got the regular premium. It comes with your choice of soup, steamed egg, and lots of side dishes. The 2 buns were also really good. Yum.

I liked the brisket, was disappointed with the pork belly, but the others were pretty good. My favorite part was the dessert!!! I NEED THAT, by itself, in large quantities. So good.

I think I would want to come back to try out their lunch menu, maybe one day!",7weuSPSSqYLUFga6IYP4pg,0,0,4,0Hgj30IHE3EyvoykUVD40Q

This should be on your Las Vegas foodie list when you visit. 
Upon entering, the decor really blows me away. Industrial with rustic undertones, the whole ambiance is very trendy and the industrial hoods that spread throughout the place rings true to the Korean BBQ theme. The food is well seasoned and get this, they serve it with cheese!!! What a game changer! Dipping your ribeye in cheese gives it a richness and zing that will have you asking yourself, Why didn't I think of that? Genius! 
The servers were super attentive even cooking the meat and plating it for you. That's always a plus in my book! 
The music is loud so it actually stimulates conversation and a lively atmosphere. 
The owner even went to each table and greeted each of the guest. He takes his business seriously. Which is a must in this tough food industry. But with the combination of everything he has going; good food, good ambiance, good service. It's definitely a recipe for great success!",d6M5tYYH-mPyZGhxZfyV0Q,2,0,5,zTqjKNwCdP_s9DZdO9RYEw
5747337,2017-12-18,3,Ef5P6C2yHAv08FPif5Rdtg,"We places a reservation for a large group and when we arrived everything was set up perfectly. We had one larger table and two small ones. Within minutes the table was full of food. I'm not a fan of cold soups but the one we started off with I'd happily order again. The meats tasted pretty good, some better than others. 

Even though the food was pretty good, thats about all it had going for it. Pretty sure the vents weren't working as the smoked just by passed it and filled the room. Only one of our three tables had a friendly server. She was engaging the table, restocking and clearing quickly, and was the only server who even offered rice. The other two tables never said a word, left the table cluttered with empty bowls, and forgot a few things including the soup we ordered. What was even worse was half way through eating, a cricket landed smack dab in the middle of the table. The waiter was flipping the meat as everyone reacted. The waiter froze and only waved for help after everyone failed to get it clear of the table. It finally landed in food and the help grabbed the plate with the cricket and walked away with it only to step on it right next to our table. As our table continued to react in shock, the waiter said and did nothing about it the entire night, as though it never happened. Finally we were given free shaved ice, but considering all our tables had it and we've had this service at kbbqs before, who knows if it was about the cricket or the fact our meal was very expensive, they never said. 

With so many amazing Kbbqs in the area, you'd be better off skipping this place.",O-nFhs8UBvWaCkgkOTynDw,4,2,2,8o_M7mJNcPcDMp7R_764lQ

We got the beef combo which started with the brisket - probably the best, juiciest beef brisket I've had.  They cooked it for you, which I usually don't like, but the service was great so I never felt like I was waiting.  The outside skirt was amazingly tender.  The final course, bulgogi was good but not standout.  The combo comes with a variety of fun dishes as well as a dessert.  The food and the service was just outstanding.

All our meats were cooked to our liking. He was well mannered and kind. My favorite quality of him is that he is multilingual. This is a good skill to have because so many international people visit Las Vegas. 

For this Japanese tourist, I recommend going to this restaurant for a nice Korean barbecue experience. Ming would be the best server for you as well. He is able to speak some Japanese. 

The quality of the meat is high, I appreciate good meat. The soy bean paste is very good with the pork belly.

5908485,2017-11-15,1,Ef5P6C2yHAv08FPif5Rdtg,"We finally had the pleasure of trying another new KOrean BBQ. Upon arriving the place very nice and intimate, the decor was nice and the set as well, the vents did their job, we didn't leave smelling like the restaurant and the good thing is they had some mints on your way out- so your able to tame your breathe lol.  
As soon as we were seated we were promoted by our host/waiter he explained the menu thoroughly and even offer suggestions and explained the 8ounce reference.  You can pretty much order your portion size, 4 ounce, 8ounce, Small and large combo. The best thing is that no matter what size you order they alway give you 8oz of Brisket, which was good with me. That is my favorite cut and it alway runs out fast.  
They have some yummy sides besides kimchi and soybeans.  I absolutely loved their cold soup it had a light nice tart cucumber flavor, and the deep fried zucchini was off the hook (we ordered several extras of that since it only had two) I love the flavor of the soybeans, it wasn't too spicy and it had a nice savory/spicy balance. The salad was a lovely touch, it wasn't too heavy and quite tasty. The potato salad was alway a favorite side dish of mine and I am glad they have it here, a lot of other places we go to don't serve it anymore (not like LA KBBQ)
Onto to our combo, we order a small beef combo, the portion wasn't enough for 3 adults and one child.  My husband and his brother could probably eat that small combo by themselves, so we did have to order some additional dishes.  No problem!  My favorite was the Brisket- and I used this Sauce they had that came with the seafood pizza- which made my meat taste even more amazing! I will definitely order the sauce again. 
The pizza was good but my husband and brother have seafood allergies. So they left it all to me, naturally I wasn't able to eat it all by myself. It was just too much, it would make a perfect appetizer to share with a group of people. My husband favorite side dish was the kimchi potato pancake, he absolutely loved it and order 2 extras!  Gotta love that all you can eat side! 
Overall my experience at this location was good, my favorite place is still Hobak,m. I think l8 ounce can definitely hold its own. A lot of of their stuff did taste different, in the flavor department. I personally enjoyed 8 ounce's soybean paste soup it was less spicy and more savory (good when your starving)
I did love 8 ounces dessert, Snow ice with chocolate shavings was amazing and very delicious, we had to order more because my son didn't get much since he's a slow eater and he couldn't keep up with the adults. I thought it was sweet that they brought him a small one for himself, which is awesome it definitely makes them a kid friendly restaurant.",ciS2XOo391iRUR2DUmSEWw,6,1,4,aj6UFKoz2we1H2Zz-dmPhA

From the moment we sat down we received excellent service. The owner and chef even came out a few times to say hello and check how we were enjoying our meal.

We ordered a combo A and also added kalbi afterwards. Everything was delicious and it was a surprise that our server cooked for us the whole time. I enjoyed that when we asked which sides were good she explained which sides were best with the meats. Also, we did ask for refills on many sides and they were more than happy to grab them for us no questions asked.
