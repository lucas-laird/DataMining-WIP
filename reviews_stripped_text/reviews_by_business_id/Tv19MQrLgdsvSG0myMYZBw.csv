As most ramen diners know, Las Vegas is becoming pretty saturated with ramen restaurants.  This is true with Spring Mountain Road, as there's Sora Ramen and Monta just up the street.  Then, Hiromaru Fusion ramen opens a few months ago.  It's important that when you are going to Hiromaru, that you understand that it is a ""fusion"" restaurant, not a typical Japanese ramen restaurant.

The location is very good, centrally located on the end-cap in the center.  One feature that I did not personally like was the ""hyper-lighting"" that was installed with the contemporary design.  You almost need sunglasses to enter, especially when you are entering in the evening.  But, the design elements are excellent, with colors of vanilla and Asian red.  There definitely was no short cuts taken with Hiromaru,  Unlike the disappointing design with Monta, you will be pleasantly surprised at the attention to detail at Hiromaru. 

The food and service were fine, especially for a restaurant that is so young in terms of age.  The ramen was good, as well as the service.  Their price points were excellent.  The important thing to always remember with any restaurant is this question:  Would you return for the food?  Our answer would be yes, especially since you have pretty good features already, which include good food, service and atmosphere.

The restaurant manager was nice enough to come by our table.  I explained to him the lighting issue and contemporary ottoman style seating.  The manager listened intently and took mental notes.  For the lighting issue, he explained that they were going to switch to the Japanese style lighting, which incorporates rice paper shades.  The ottoman style seating is a bit difficult to move, especially for younger people or women wearing dresses.  There are no back rests to these chairs and you are left struggling with how to move them.  The manager quickly noted that they were looking into ""sliders"", which would be placed under each leg that would make sliding the chairs much easier.

Ultimately, Hiromaru ramen will be successful.  They have an excellent opportunity to be a player in the ramen market in Las Vegas.  The important thing is that they are willing to listen to their diners, which can't be said about too many Japanese restaurants!  Hopefully, they'll have the lighting and seating issue resolved for our next visit.  In the meantime, keep in mind when you first enter that this will not be typical of most ramen houses, and that you'll be in a very contemporary one as well.  As long as you understand these issues, you'll have a really good experience!",3HKIdkKnXrXjV7VGI5X75A,0,0,4,hrNPuXWGpQwGzRV1uM_4cA

Long: Came here with a friend after spotting it on my drive home from Monta Ramen. Looks rather odd from the outside, but inside is rather interesting. Kinda? It looks rather ""modern"" on the inside, and it feels a bit uncomfortable to me.
I ordered the Shiro Tonkotsu ramen just to set a standard to review this place from. It's the typical tonkotsu ramen with milk added. The noodles, toppings, and broth was pretty close to Monta ramen's, but the chashu was a bit firmer which made it more flavorful, but the broth mix wasn't as strong as Monta ramen's.
Service was alright, can't complain there.

Go here if you want to try something different--other than the tonkotsu, miso, shoryu you can get else where (there is other unique ramen spots though!). Go if something intrigues you on the menu, but as it sits with the ""unique"" spins, it's not as good as more traditional places. I'd choose Monta over this place 9/10 times.",kBoCLXsjzpSTpOKC9J6FUg,0,0,4,wzQ2Zo064trN5Yyqt7hHXA

788700,2014-04-12,0,Tv19MQrLgdsvSG0myMYZBw,"I had the shiroi tonkotsu and a dessert.

The decor was visually interesting but the red square chairs were heavy.  Quick side note:  Considering the color scheme is red and white, why are the two color-themed ramens kuroi (black) and shiroi (white)?  They could develop a tantanmen or a spicy ramen  and call it ""akai"" (red) lol 

The service was fine and prompt with seating, placing the order, refilling my drinks and clearing the table.  In my opinion, they could learn how to explain/promote the menu items better. 

The shiroi tonkotsu was fine, nothing to rant about, nothing to rave about.  I liked the generous amount of bean sprouts you add for $1.  I did not like the kikurage mushrooms being cold.  I had to press/drown them in the broth in order to heat them up.

What I was most impressed with was the dessert. It was a yellow cake with a layer of pear fruit and thick cream dolloped on top.  It was surrounded by a liquor-based(?) sauce and dressed with berries and morsels of chocolate.  It was delicious and I find it odd that such a fancy dessert is served in a casual restaurant setting.  My taste buds are not complaining as this was the star of the meal.  

I might come back to try the izakaya side of the menu.",1Hhz6FGgvi9qd1q6PR0AEA,0,0,3,Vf3-myEn_i_u2ZMpQaeFmw

808452,2014-06-17,3,Tv19MQrLgdsvSG0myMYZBw,"I love ramen and I guess I only like more tradition ramen because I don't really like this place. The 2 different type of ramen we tried were both pretty salty, although unique concept but does it have to be so salty?  

The gyoza was probably the worst ever I've ever had.  Maybe they forgot to wash the frying pan after cooking something else that was super starchy or that's just how they make their gyoza. Our gyoza came to our table not only very shining and oily, but has a gelatin-like coating.  After about one minute it arrived at our table, the coating turned a bit cold, of course, and a full piece of mystery starchy film came off right on my chopsticks. I threw it away of course and still eager to try the non gelatin gyoza anyway, and it's mediocre at best. It's probably from a cheap frozen brand, at least it tastes like it is.  Don't recommend anyone to order it. 

The karaage was also very mediocre. It has too much breading and the same gelatin feel.  Don't understand how you can screw up a simple gyoza and fried chicken. But they did. 

If you're a true ramen fan, stick with what you know, Monta, Sora, or Tatsu. Forget about this place.",bEZjkjMe1HDWjec-R5O8bw,3,0,1,9CojfNWBWc7vQkwtB7C7kA

I am a Monta fan, especially since they have one in Henderson, but my Japanese fiance wanted me to try this place instead, and I was pleasantly surprised. The place was clean and had interesting decor. Their ramen is super tasty! He had the garlic one, which was BOMB, and made me wish I had ordered that one instead. I got the carbonara one which was delicious in it's own right, but not traditional ramen. We shared the dumplings which were also great. My only complaint is that the parking there SUCKS, but that is not their fault really, just be prepared to circle the parking lot for 10min before you are able to catch someone leaving!",MO7NAGoPvyjFpFdvE221JA,0,0,4,9iujnvdk_5h-9RXE9xjHAA

Apparently this is Japanese chain with its first restaurant in the US.  Started with the Hiromaru fried rice, a ""fluffy"" rice dish with pork belly served over two fried eggs. Really enjoyed this dish. Then had the Shiroi Tonkatsu ramen.  Unbelievable flavor with a creamer broth and thin noodle.

1277073,2014-04-18,0,Tv19MQrLgdsvSG0myMYZBw,"I just ate here, so I thought I better write my review while its still fresh in my mind. 

Overall this is a beautiful restaurant and a terrific place to eat. I will come back and recommend it to other people. Food and service was great! 

We ate here on a Thursday around 6 pm; not a busy time. We were quickly seated by the friendly manager. And the waitress was excellent; graciously attentive. 

We ordered the beers, Karrage, Carbonara ramen and Black garlic ramen. Ice cold glasses filled with fresh Asahi draft. Karaage was hot and delicious; we shared a plate but we should've ordered two. We received complimentary edemame. The soups were beautiful and tasty. The Carbonara was delicious, but I preferred the black garlic.  We need to come back for dessert!

My critiques are minor. I think the south wall of the restaurant could use some color or more decoration. The wall now just feels to empty. The red cube ottoman seats are cumbersome. They are hard to pull out and scoot in. They should have an upholsterer add handles to the upper sides. In the ladies' room, I would appreciate seat protector liners and a small mirror. Or at least a mirror in the hallway.  My husband did say that the men's bathroom had a cool urinal!

There is an additional room being finished up. It's a dark and has a world cool ambiance. The manager said it would be an izakaya room. 

Thanks!

On a side note: When I typed in ""Hiro"" intoYyelp it did not find this restaurant. I had to type the entire Hiromaru name. Poor coding on Yelp's part.",Ijl7OMSDs5MiOhniXDnzcg,0,0,5,aZ_GYR97NOIqiwJPutQXMg
1278613,2014-08-16,0,Tv19MQrLgdsvSG0myMYZBw,"First and foremost, come with an open mind because it is Fusion Ramen, so it most likely won't be what you're used to if you regularly eat at other ramen houses.

The decor is really nice and simple, which gives a modern feel. I can't say much about the service since my husband and I got take out, but for our limited interaction with the server, she was super friendly and helpful. 

The noodles and the chashu are done exceedingly well. The noodles have a great fresh flavor, and I loved that I could taste the egg within the noodle. 

I got the Shiroi Tonkotsu. As a whole, the flavors blend really well together. The saltiness of the broth with the flavor of the noodle really offset the fatty flavor of the chashu, but drinking the broth alone is too salty for me. The flavor is there; I just preferred it as a dipping sauce for the noodles and meat. The menu states that there is a low salt option for the broth, so I most likely will try that next time.

Also, if you were to try one thing off the menu, I would suggest trying the Hiromaru Buns. They have a really good flavor with just the right amount of spice.  I was actually surprised because I usually can't eat pork belly because it's too fatty for me, but I loved the buns.",U8tk0k5lDGnlyD1XUVcdSA,0,0,4,YzEGxGF1WTy6WRmumFQFXQ
1314617,2014-04-02,0,Tv19MQrLgdsvSG0myMYZBw,"Craving for ramen I decided to try the new place in town and headed to Hiromaru fusion ramen.  I'm no very comfortable with the fusion word in restaurants since I'm a firm believer that original  is better. Having said that there has been some instances when mixing two cuisines something wonderful is created so I went ahead and ordered the ramen carbonara and quickly realized this wasn't one of those instances.
For me the ramen carbonara was like some version of Olive Garden's carbonara complete with the waitress grinding fresh pepper into my plate and as she asks me to tell her when to stop. The soft melt in my mouth pork that I'm used to in ramen dishes was nothing more than plain bacon in this dish and the broth tasted like a very watery Alfredo sauce. 
  Service is good all the employees are very attentive and try their best to make you feel comfortable although the atmosphere of the dining room is not very  inviting, for the lights are very bright and the combination of mostly white and red accents of the room made me feel like I was eating in the middle of a target store commercial shooting. More earthy colors could make this place more welcoming and dimmer lighting more relaxing.
 On a different note, I can't exactly recall what they were playing but the music was awesome but so was the music I was playing in my car on my way home wishing I've would've had some real Japanese ramen. 
 I may come back again but next time I'll order something more authentic from the menu, for now I'll give this place three stars.",EG6qatWgJ2WTJnzBCCH_Dg,2,1,3,-TPknWmJ5LLY1OB-Akk6ag
1352467,2014-03-05,3,Tv19MQrLgdsvSG0myMYZBw,"Came here on their 2nd soft opening day. There was a LOT of waiters/waitresses waiting at the door and greeted us the second the door opened. Two of my friend's had already arrived by the time, my friend and I had gotten there (oops i took the long way there apparently... XD or rather the slow way haha). 

First impressions - LOTS of people working. Probably to get used to the environment and process. Decor. Very simple. Red and White. First thought i had, ""why does this remind me of In n Out....?"" LOL anyway Design almost kept like how it was when Cafe de Japon existed. Bar area. More open now with the various table set ups. Chairs are a bit bottom heavy, so not too easy to move. 

Each person is served with a small salad bowl, even before ordering. (surprising) 

Since it is still their soft opening, they were not offering their complete menu.

Carbonara Ramen - $10.95 - ""Signature ramen noodle fusion inspired by popular Italian Carbonara pasta."" A soup base with the original tonkotsu pork broth and milk. Toppings included is an egg yolk , bacon, shiso, and fresh scallions. The type of noodle selected for this ramen is flat, thick noodles. 

First impression, something new to try. Their rendition of a popular italian dish, in a japanese style. Soup base, is light, due to the broth being mixed with milk (which i dont think is normal cow milk, reminds me of soy milk, maybe?). Noodles are thick, non-traditional ramen noodles, which you don't see often, but cooked to a nice al dente, which gives a nice bite ! =D The egg yolk, im pretty sure was laid in raw, and left with the broth to cook slightly? gives a nice rich flavor overall. Bacon, gives a nice flavor, esp since they had it lightly seared on a grill, but not a fan of bacon. The shiso leaf, actually look me off guard. Gives, something along the lines of maybe a basil flavor? Overall, this ramen is not bad, since its lighter than the shiroi tonkotsu ramen. Not my favorite, but i like the noodles they use. 

Shiroi Tonkotsu Ramen - $7.95 - ""The best salted ramen is created with salted sauce and brown garlic oil."" A soup base with the original tonkotsu pork broth with salted sauce. Toppings included is chashu pork, hard-boiled egg, fresh scallions, and kikurage. The type of noodle selected for this ramen is thin noodle. 

Thin noodles. Overcooked in my opinion. Cooked a bit too long. Lost its ""bite"". The soup is quite salty. Probably from the ""salted sauce""... whatever that could be. Very heavy in garlic flavor, mostly from the garlic oil. It was surprising to me they did hard-boiled eggs. I'd prefer a soft-boiled egg with a runny yolk. The ""kikurage"" (wood-ear fungus) is quite normal to be in a japanese style ramen. The thing that was nice to me, was the chashu. In comparison to like Monta, this was not fatty at all. Majority meat, with a thin line of fat. A nice touch is they seared it on a grill. Adds a nice flavor to it. Not a bad ramen, though soup base with the salted sauce (what is this?!?) is quite salty. 

During this soft opening, they also had a few side orders available. 

Hiromaru Gyoza - $5.50 - Grilled pork dumpling

Hiromaru Buns - $6.00 - Two steamed buns filled with butabara (pork belly) and served with Hiromaru original sauce

Karaage - $5.00 - Japanese fried chicken

Pretty good ! to start off, the meat is a dark meat. On top of that, its marinated/seasoned so even the inside of the meat is flavorful. The batter used is not too thick, and is nice and crispy. Nice side to get ! 

HIromaru Japanese Curry - $8.50 - Japanese style curry rice with chashu pork

To be honest, upon bring brought out this order, first thing that came to mind, was ""overpriced"". At $8.50, you get about the amount of a small bowl of rice, in a pool of curry sauce, ONE slice of pork, two short spears of asparagus, and a sliver of red bell pepper. The curry sauce, .... very UNDER-whelming. Flavor wasn't there. Felt diluted. Not flavorful at all, like some curry. Some had said its like what you would get from a box of curry, at a grocery store. To me, it was not strong at all. I tasted the sauce straight up. If i had ate it with rice, id be like... uhhh wheres the curry? Aside from that, ONE slide of pork? really? wow... 

Service wise, they were very attentive. They picked up finished bowls quickly, and were quick to refill on water. Hope their attentive service will last after opening. 

On the side note, they have another room, decorated differently next door. The waitress had told us it is for dinner service for the izakaya? as well has some private VIP rooms too. The decor is complete opposite of the original side. 

Overall, not bad for a soft opening and new style. Would like to come back to try different side dishes next time (gyoza and buns) as well as the other two ramen they offer on their menu. For the price (ramen), i'd say they should include one more slide of pork though. Seemed a little ""skimped out"" on only have 1 slice....",Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,6,5,3,JRnIo-6p81-rNdDFx2hEqw

Gyoza was crispy near the edges and a lot softer in the center. I loved the texture of the gyoza towards the edges but the center was a bit too soft and soggy compared to other gyozas. 

The ramen noodles were hard which were a nice texture for the soup. The soup base was tasty, but a bit too much flavor and oiliness that it almost seemed to overcome the overall ramen. Towards the end, the oil was just too much that I couldn't drink the soup. 

I think overall the ramen was good, but I think the restaurant tried too hard to make the ramen taste good that the oiliness and extra flavors mixed in took away from my general first impression.",gaXdYfTY_u9lOkBju1EIbQ,0,0,4,MsmLYT3lAWfJguclNgDaaw
1448079,2014-05-08,1,Tv19MQrLgdsvSG0myMYZBw,"Came here to try out the much-hyped Carbonara ramen. Why go to a fusion ramen place if you don't try the fusion dishes, right?

Interior is surprisingly modern, despite the more traditional exterior. Service was polite- we sat in the right-hand side with red and white decor, there was a couple in the more intimate left-hand side, not sure what the difference is to get seated there.

Started with the Hiromaru buns as an appetizer- quite nice, with doughy buns and plentiful portions of pork and special sauce. I quite liked the almost barbecue-like sauce that the pork was cooked in.

Carbonara ramen for myself, black garlic for my guy.
I was pleasantly surprised by my dish- was a little apprehensive, thinking the broth would be thicker and create a texture I did not like (not a fan of alfredo sauces) but somehow it worked, being milky and flavorful without being too decadent or overly rich (though it was). Did not specify thick noodles as I initially would have preferred, but received thin and appreciated the similarity to spaghetti carbonara, added to the fusion feel of the dish overall. The bacon and fresh-ground pepper really made this dish, adding just a bit of bite to the flavor and a meaty savory element that balanced out the milky broth. And I'm not even a bacon fan! 
My guy favored his garlic ramen- I took a few bites and it wasn't really for me, flavors were bold but seemed a little off. He has had less ramen but proclaimed that it was his favorite bowl so far, which is impressive. Egg was a bit overcooked, but overall the dish was tasty but just slightly off and almost felt incomplete, like something was missing.

I will say that, despite the giant bowls and the rich broths, the ramen did not feel like an overwhelmingly heavy dinner- perhaps it has to do with the choice for thin noodles? A big bowl of ramen is good comfort food to me, but I liked not feeling the sloshing-belly-full-of-dinner feeling afterward.

The Kuroi was earthy and meaty. Very enjoyable. I think this may be a wintertime favorite for me.

I started my dinner off with the Bao buns which had a sauce overload.. It was messy to eat and took away from the pork belly. The curry bowl was boring and so was side salad that comes with it. The chicken karaage lacked some flavor but it wasn't too bad.

On to the ramen!!! The kuro had ZERO garlic flavor anywhere. Not even a slight aroma of it. There is nothing more exciting to me than the aroma of my meal in front of me. The tonkatsu was very weird and was VERY short of amazing.. Kind of let me down and made me wish I had went to Monta or Sora instead. (Which I had to do two days later because I needed my fix after the disappointment) 

I mentioned that I did not like the kuro and they were kind of enough to remove it from my bill.

-The broths are flavored differently, creating a different product for each restaurant. 

-Pro for Hiramaru: SERVICE! I find that Monta no longer takes the time to take care it's customers properly. Their service is not poor but it's not genuine. Hiramaru provides a great dining experience highly due to the service it provides! 

-Another Pro: the temperature of the broth for Hiramaru allows me to enjoy the ramen right when I receive it. I find that my tongue doesn't burn and I can taste the flavors throughout the meal. With Monta's temperature, I can't really taste the broth after eating for about 10 minutes because it's just too hot . However, ramen is just plain good, both at Hiramaru and Monta, so I shall eat it no matter what!!! 

-Lastly: Hiramaru provides a bigger menu and therefore has a greater selection of items to grub on! Their prices are a tad bit more expensive. I love the food they offer for their customers but I also love the simplicity of Monta's menu. 

Overall, Hiramaru is good and worthy! Haha. It's new and still deserves to learn and grow, just like any new restaurant. Monta can continue striving for greatest through improvement of service.",7t6hhTtGCFCg2gTEWF7KIA,0,0,5,a6Qp8GzgTH0Tf94YP5n-eQ

I ordered the shiroi tonkotsu ramen which is the white pork based soup with a hint of garlic. It was delicious! My friend ordered the tateyama ramen- this ramen was full of bean sprouts and the noodles were thick so it filled you up, she couldn't even finish it. But she said it was good!

I started this review thinking Hiromaru Fusion Ramen was a 2.5 or 3 star experience...as I wrote and recalled my experience, I ended  up feeling like I couldn't justify anything beyond 2 stars.

I wasn't really a fan all the way around.  There are two distinct dinning areas.  One is bright and clean...lots of white...bright lights... accented with strong, vibrant red and some natural wood.  Did I mention this side is bright?  Well, it is...pretty sure surgeons prefer less light during intricate operations.  The other side is calm and peacefully brought together with muted browns, blues and the like.  The lighting on this side pushes towards a romantic feel and I would certainly try to sit on this side if I return.

We tried the Shiroi Tonkotsu (Salted White Tonkotsu) $7.95 and the signature-fusion Carbonara Ramen $10.95.  Neither ramen left us wanting more.  A few distinct changes have taken place based on some early comments.  Both noodles were thin, eggs were executed well.  Previous reviewers have complained about the thick noodles.  I didn't have those...I will go ahead and complain about the thin noodles instead.  I like a bit more bite.  There isn't much tooth found in these overly thin noodles. The Shiroi had a nice flavor on the front, but lingered in a way that I didn't enjoy.  ...wasn't even a fan of the thin pork in this ramen, so while I could put a whole bowl of this down, I won't be seeking it out anytime soon.  The Carbonara excited me even less.  I didn't like the flavors or the texture of the broth.  The noodles were the same as described previously, only this time there was nothing redeeming for me in this bowl.

I didn't have the opportunity to try any of the side dishes, but probably won't (unless I hear that they are something special) since I won't be back for the ramen.",A5A34ixb-yy6nwL42iZsnw,12,6,2,P6chjoweJmRWGr4YEDFetw

Saw that Hiromaru was opening a location in Vegas and I was excited. I had gone to the Japanese festival and tried their ramen months ago. I loved it so this was big news. 

I came here on the grand opening and was greeted by a huge staff. They were all so welcoming! The interior is pretty hip with its red and white decor. 

My boyfriend and I already knew to get the carbonara ramen because that was what we tried at the festival. Carbonara ramen is $10.95. Pretty pricey in my opinion. We also got a chashu bowl for almost $7. After ordering we were given complimentary salads. The salad had a refreshing dressing on top. 

We got our chashu bowl first. The chashu is topped with chopped greens and a sauce which I don't know the name of, all on top of rice. If you've been to monta, it's nothing like it. I personally prefer fried chashu. This pork seemed to be steamed because of how soft it was. Don't get me wrong, it still tasted fine! 

Now onto the ramen. The carbonara has THICK noodles with a milky tonkatsu broth. It comes with bacon, but I switched it out for chashu for no charge. Lastly, it has an egg yolk on your spoon that goes with it. The broth was thicker than what I had at the festival but it still tasted great. If it was thinner it'd be perfect. The noodles were huge. It's like udon except harder. I don't know how to feel about the noodles to be honest.

The ramen tasted different than what I had at the japanese festival. It was kinda disappointing but the ramen was appetizing regardless. I'm sure to go back and try their other ramen.",2Z29fLaeLtGnNroTuHyJ2A,1,1,4,KKsPtnW4jAjrmQUrFLYTfA
3014233,2014-03-23,0,Tv19MQrLgdsvSG0myMYZBw,"There are some things in life that are constant--the way ramen is presented and the way ramen tastes, but Hiromaru flips ramen on its head and takes it to a new level.  There are three things that are important in ramen: noodles, broth, and taste.  We all know the common ramen joints around our cities that deliver the standard pork broth or soy broth with noodles, topped with egg and a few pieces of meat and mushrooms. 

Not Hiromaru.

This restaurant is a new ramen experience, with fare such as cabonara ramen and black garlic tonkatsu ramen.  The menu is short and sweet.  As with any great ramen place, there are appetizers, sides, and then the main ramen dishes.  Instead of fifteen option, Hiromaru has 4--Shiroi, which is their brown garlic oil broth, the Kuroi, which is black garlic oil broth, Tate Yama, which is a huge and has that great pork fatty taste with flat noodles, and his Cabonara ramen, which is a creamy ramen broth.

We started with a few popular appetizers--pork bun, karaage, and the special fried rice.  All of them were excellent.  The karaage arrived first.  This is as simple and beautiful as karaage gets.  The batter was extremly light and crispy and did not require any dipping sauce or soy sauce.  With a light squeeze of lemon, this karaage was perfect.  We were also presented with fried rice.

I love playful food.  You break down the rice and mix the egg and everything together in order to eat.  With the hot plate underneath, this fried rice stays nice and hot, and all the flavors of the pork with the salty egg and the sweet, green onions is divine.  I could eat a whole order to myself.

The last appetizer to arrive were the pork buns, which were different from others sold around town.  As with the other apps, minimalist food is the most beautiful and tasty, and this pork bun was heaven in my mouth.  Instead of the melty pork pieces that other restaurants have, this one is thick, chewy, but is gorgeous in every way.  The pork texture in contrast with the soft,  sweet bun was just heaven.  With a slight crispy and fresh note from the sauce and greens, this is something I would come back for time and again.

With the appetizer round complete, the ramen arrived, and it was something unique to the eye from what I am used to.  The black garlic oil provided a dark tinge to the ramen broth, which looked alien.  As I began to mix the ramen up, the milky pork broth became visible and all the flavors melded.  The noodles are different at Hiromasu.  They feel thinner but tastier, with more cling to the broth than other ramen.  The milky, black broth was absolutely delicious.  With the black garlic's smoky and sweet flavor against the pork broth, the umami was amazing.  I sat, face down in my bowl, slurping and sipping away quietly, trying to figure out what other flavors were layered in the broth.  With every chopstick-full of noodles, I appreciated every ounce of flavor within the universe of my bowl.  This broth is lovely and made me contemplate my ramen-filled life.  I drank every last drop leaving nothing but a dry ramen bowl to be taken from me.  

I sat quietly after the entire meal, kindly paid my check, and walked out a bit stunned by the excellent food this place provides. Given, the service is lacking, but the food is worth a return time and again. Hiromasu brings more than simple ramen to the city--you can taste the experience, the love, and the beauty of what ramen should always be.",o68A_3bAJTge-ioGXHdxKA,2,1,4,lduDjNi6POfKpuOjcldlmw

I believe most of the issues are due to execution but for starters, you are literally blinded when you walk in.....Man it is bright.  There are HUGE red chairs to plop yourself into.

The complimentary salad was a nice gesture but after that things were just aight.  We ordered the Shiroi, Kuroi, and the Tate-Yama selections.   The Carbonara sounded great but I don't know if I could do a full bowl as I imagine it would be pretty rich.

For the 3 Ramen's we found the broth to be too salty.  Noodles were either really over cooked (Shiroi and Kuroi) or slightly under cooked (Tate Yama)   I personally liked the noodles in the Tate-Yama as they were probably the thickest ramen noodles I ve ever eaten but based on other reviews I can understand where people are coming from as they are thick and doughy.

The Tate-Yama was my favorite - i love bean sprouts and it was topped with a mountain.  Overall everything was decent.  I would come back to give it a second chance but i wont be rushing.

First things, first.  There was mad construction being done on the restaurant... they were straight up building a door with hammers and shiet right inside.  I had to ask to see if they were open because I honestly was not sure.  Once we came inside we were seated in the room where they were doing construction rather than the other quieter room.  I got a front row seat to the construction guy's belly hanging out of his pants.  Sometimes I couldn't hear what people were saying over the hammering.  If you don't have your door built, why are you open?

We tried the karaage chicken, pork buns, and shiroi tonkatsu ramen.  The karaage chicken was nice and crispy but lacked flavor.  I like the karaage chicken from Tonkatsu Kiyoshi much more.  The pork buns were disappointing.  The pork belly is served in a bun with a mayo type of sauce.  The pork was not appetizing and tasted of nothing.  More seasoning needed.  The ramen was flavorful in the soup... the shiroi is much creamier than expected.  It almost looked like the carbonara ramen in the menu.  The ramen noodles were not ramen.  They were closer in texture to spaghetti.  Some sort of wheat pasta... nothing like the bouncy yellowish noodles you would expect.  They were clumped together in our bowls... we had to literally use our chopsticks to separate them.  The eggs were not a nice soft boil but an overdone hard boiled egg (and served cold somehow, not freshly prepared).  They didn't have any condiments for the ramen on the table and when I asked the waitresses seemed confused as to what I wanted.  They don't have sesame seeds or chili pepper.  They gave me chili oil and sriracha sauce... the chili oil was okay but they need to have condiments on the table at a ramen restaurant.

In the former Cafe De Japon spot, the interior has been redone with bursts of red and white, and the other half of the room still under construction to feature more Japanese Fusion items. We ordered The Carbonara($10.95),  Karaage($5), and Tate-Yama Ramen($9.95) The Karaage, although juicy, barely had flavor, pretty skimpy, and lacked the crisp exterior I'm used to having in other tastier versions. 

Our Ramen arrives, and the portions are pretty huge! Wifey's Carbonara is very good, as was mine, but the Tate-Yama advertised a double portion of the thick noodles....my bowl was more like one third thick noodles and two third bean sprouts. Banchan for days I tell you! Another bummer? Hard boiled egg...:( It advertises it on the menu, but there's nothing like SOFT boiled egg with your ramen IMHO....

I look forward to coming back when the lounge is finished.",th7tfMsh74S6sa_BWOt8YA,0,0,4,WDjzv0vRQTban34UyfI8QA

Carbonara Ramen --  http://bit.ly/1p02mx5
I'm probably one of the few minority that actually enjoyed their Carbonara Ramen.  It's like a breakfast ramen!  Crispy Bacon and Egg.  The bacon gave the Ramen a very nice smoked flavor.

Though my visit was pretty short and that I only had one of their Ramen bowls, I'd say Hiromaru is a decent place and I like how they have a different approach to Ramen with their fusion creations.  If I'm around the area again, I'd probably go back to try their other Ramen bowls.",F_5_UNX-wrAFCXuAkBZRDw,9,6,4,1r1YSyutez1DWuByyTdkDw

Top that with a blob of mayo and a piece of lettuce...is that the fusion part?

We started our meal with their Hiromaru buns. My pork belly was tough , like I could barely chew through the meat. So I was left a bit underwhelmed with my bun experience. Secondly I really wanted to try their carbonara ramen since I've heard that is the show stealer, unfortunately they were out. I heard they had a great soft opening but its kind of a disappointment not to have star menu items on their grand opening day. So I ended up settling for the Shiroi Tonkotsu ramen with extra chashu. The broth was tasty but I personally wasn't a fan of the noodles. I like a slightly thicker noodle. The chashu was good but almost all fat with very little ""meat.""
Overall it was just an ok ramen experience for me. Maybe I'm just a creature of habit and prefer Ramen Sora.

ATMOSPHERE:
Spacious but the lighting was too much for me. Too bright! Good lighting for a selfie I guess lol

FOOD:
Carbonara ramen-didn't really like the thick noodle but that may just be a personal preference. Enjoyed the first two bites, then regretted the fact that I mixed in egg yolk with soup. Soup was kind of oily and couldn't keep eating after halfway. It's very unique but I didn't like anything about it.

Kuroi tonkotsu-my mom ordered this and according to her, it's a little bitter. She enjoyed the thin noodles.

Tateyama ramen-lots of bean sprouts. My dad ordered this and he liked the broth. He didn't enjoyed the thick noodles.

STAFF:
I felt really uncomfortable because they stood by our table and watched us eat O_O. When my dad finished taking the last bite, this lady quickly came by and took away the bowl. He was going to enjoy the broth but I guess that's a part of a good service (?) 

CONCLUSION:
Not coming back",mEzc6LeTNiQgIVsq3poMbg,6,1,2,s5IitxykfkgADREpxn-5LA
4106827,2014-03-05,4,Tv19MQrLgdsvSG0myMYZBw,"There is no doubt that Hiromaru is the hottest new business for anyone who attended or followed the Aki Matsuri festival for the ramen, or for ramen fans in general. I didn't attend the festival, but I am aware that Hiromaru presented a very popular offering there and made it known that they were planning an outpost here in Vegas

Fast forward about half a year and I got a tip from my friend that they were finally ready to open. There were a couple issues over the weekend that pushed back the opening just a little, but I'm just thankful that I  have been lucky enough to have eaten here three times now. Got welcomed to soft opening #1 through expressing keen interest to them in-person and on the phone, and subsequently went to soft opening #2 last night and grand opening day today.

I will go over the items that I had so as not to make this sound too much like a story or event review. I deliberately waited until opening day to post this, so I am judging mainly on food quality, service being a work in progress and price of food being non-existent for my first two visits.

House salad: this is a complimentary little bowl of greens and oil that they present to every customer upon arrival. I found some of the purple leaves a little bitter, but it's a nice fresh start and a welcome

Hiromaru Buns: butabara pork belly in a white bun with some sort of house-made mayo. I enjoyed it. I'm told that it's not as good as Fat Choy, which I still haven't tried, but it is at the very least a competent offering. [UPDATE 3/12: tried Fat Choy's pork belly bao, which utterly blows this out of the water, but that's mainly a testament as to how good Fat Choy is.]

Karaage: your typical ball-ish fried chicken with a slice of lemon and a little lettuce. It wasn't that crunchy on the first day, but it was on the second day. If karaage is your thing, try it.

Hiromaru Japanese Curry: rice, typical yellow curry, and chashu pork belly. Not spicy. I could not and will not get myself to like this enough. It tastes fine, but I just wouldn't order it knowing that Japanese Curry Zen is just down the street.

Shiroi Tonkotsu: the ""basic"" ramen with chashu pork, half of a hard-boiled egg, scallions, and kikurage mushrooms. I tried this on the first night and wasn't impressed overall. The sesame-heavy broth really, really threw me for a loop. I also didn't like the hard boiled egg as a stylistic choice vs. soft-boiled, but I thought the noodles were decent (maybe not al dente) and the chashu pork belly was nice because it's meaty much more so than fatty. Maybe I'll try it again in the future, but my grade would be an Incomplete for this.

Carbonara Ramen: this is the one that you want to have, seeing as how you're going to a place with ""fusion ramen"" in its name. It has a lot more to do with a carbonara pasta than it does with typical ramen. The thick noodles are al dente, the egg lends a nice flavor to the broth, and the thick-cut bacon, while predominantly chewy, completes the experience. Couldn't taste the sesame for some reason (was the milk that helpful?), so I enjoyed the shiso-accented broth. Because it is a fusion ramen, I would not directly call it better or worse than my favorites at Fukumimi and Sora, but mainly different.

Kuroi Tonkotsu: basically, Shiroi plus black garlic oil. This is what I chose today because they were out of Carbonara and Tate-Yama supplies at the time for whatever reason. I am very glad that i tried this because 1) now I know that the shiroi flavor the first night wasn't a fluke, and 2) I got more accustomed to the sesame flavor enough to enjoy the ramen today. I would still not pick this ramen over Fukumimi or Sora, but I think I would rank this above Monta, which really has not impressed me as of late.

This is a very promising ramen shop with a dedicated management team, and you should know that they're still ironing out the kinks in the first week. But so what if they took ten minutes to give me my check? I can't hold it against them at this point. Give them a try some time and see what you think!",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,7,3,4,8kgm9LTuV6qBvcCr0q87Jw

White, red, and wood fixtures and furniture. There is also a second dining area with booths and beautiful lighting. It's definitely more spacious than most ramen joints. Lots of light, very welcoming.

I was really looking forward to trying their Cabonara or Tate-Yama Ramen, but they weren't serving either today (the soft openings possibly depleted their thick noodle supply). So, we ordered the only other two ramen choices available: Shiroi and Kuroi.

Shiroi Tonkotsu ($7.95): Pork broth with ""salted sauce"" and brown garlic oil, served with thin noodles, and topped with chashu pork, hard boiled egg, fresh scallions, and kikurage. The broth had a really nice creaminess that was almost milky. The garlic oil was surprisingly light. It had a great depth and flavor. The noodles were good and the pork wasn't fatty.

Kuroi Tonkotsu ($8.95): Completely identical to the Shiroi Tonkotsu except it's made with ma-yu (black garlic oil) instead of the brown garlic oil. The flavors are similar, but the black garlic is a bit more robust. Both broths were both delicious in their own way.

We also shared two side dishes, Karaage ($5) and Hiromaru Special Fried Rice ($6.50) made with egg, chashu pork, and scallions. The Karaage had a light batter and good flavor. I loved the squeeze of fresh lemon on the chicken too. The fried rice was very tasty! The chashu pork and scallions flavored it nicely.

The service was friendly and I was surprised to find that Mr. Kawai was in the kitchen since he has his six locations in Toyama, Japan. Anyway, I will be making my way back next week to try the thick noodle ramens!",TdYKJgSgY2GF_YJnwsi5yQ,4,3,4,J3yimQYcm0yiJ9wsPiyOtA

4818598,2014-05-05,1,Tv19MQrLgdsvSG0myMYZBw,"05/04/14 DINNER

So I write my first Yelp in quite a long time, mostly due to time constraints. (Sheesh, should I even bother, my LAST Yelp review generated my first-ever hate mail, via Yelp's ""compliment"" app! NICE!)

I'm not gonna get into it deeply (actually, knowing me, I probably will!), but we REALLY liked this place a lot. It's the first of this Japanese chain's restaurants in the entire United States. Having dined there, we feel privileged.

And dining here was a last-minute decision. We were on our way elsewhere for a dear friend's Cinco de Mayo bar extravaganza, but unfortunately their parking lot was completely full from the very beginning, and with absolutely NO street parking for miles, we gave up on that. (Sorry, C! Love you, man!)

It's not fair to review the standard ramen itself here, as we didn't have typical ramen, but we want to return and try that, to compare it to the other ramen places we've tried in Vegas. (HINT: My absolute FAVE ramen place remains Ramen Sora, particularly the miso ramen, but we haven't been there in quite a while.)

First off, you can order an Asahi draft for under $4, or you can order the same beer with edamame thrown in for the same price! We opted for that little extra. The edamame were OK, nothing special, no garlic or coarse salt. But for free, who can complain! As all 3 of us wanted a beer, we got lots of edamame.

Next up, if you check-in via Yelp you can get purchase an appetizer for half off. As we had a party of 3 (but only 2 smartphones), we opted for the karaage and the gyoza. 

The karaage (Japanese boneless fried chicken) are the reason this place didn't get 5 stars from me: very disappointing. It's like they threw purchased frozen nuggets in a fryer. Not the worst thing in the world, but greasy, not crispy, never again. 

BUT THOSE GYOZA! WOW! We could've ordered tons of those! Wonderful!

Lastly, my spouse and I ordered the same entree, the carbonara ramen. I guess this is the signature dish of the chain. It's literally a lightly japanese take on carbonara pasta in Italy. This rocked. Not a heavy cream sauce, as most american restaurants mistakenly do, but a light broth (using the same broth in the ramens) with cream added. The waitress asked if I wanted thick or thin noodles, I opted to have her choose, she chose thick, and they were great with this. Now, this dish is NOT loaded up with pork belly slices, like other ramens I've had in the past, but instead contains some chopped up pork belly and fat, which was similar to the pancetta you'd get if ordered in Italy. At $10.95, this was a great deal and, like I said, was terrific. Best carbonara I've had ANYWHERE in quite a long time. (Oh, how I long for the day of the visiting barely-english-speaking Claudio and his home made pasta & carbonara, made at my apt in Sherman Oaks, CA!)

This time, I asked for the carbonara as I heard praises about it. This turned out to be a huge mistake!!! 

They used bigger noodle for this ramen item. Unfortunately, the noodle was so undercooked this time that it was barely edible. On a scale of 1 to 10, where 10 is super overcooked, 1 is raw and 5 is al dente, this noodle was probably somewhere around 2 or 3. My dining friends agreed with me on this.

5318621,2014-03-11,5,Tv19MQrLgdsvSG0myMYZBw,"Hiromaru originated in Japan and they still have locations there. They have 2 doors - use the left one. My main mission was to try their black garlic ramen since that's my favorite ramen of all. I was very impressed with how clean and slick the interior looks. Red accent wall, white walls, red chairs - my favorite color. I had great expectations but I was very much disappointed. This replaced the good ol' Cafe de Japon (you will be missed). I thought this place would be packed since they're new and people would want to try this place - but no.

I went here with Tu Anh and Tony who've been here a few times since they opened. We got some appetizers. I asked for oolong tea but they ran out of tea. Seriously? We were given a mixed greens salad with a light dressing and immedicately, Tony said the salad was better when they first opened.

Hiromaru Buns:
The pork  belly was tasty. It has greens and Kewpie (Japanese mayo) in it. I lost the pork belly somewhere in the steamed buns. Too much bun, not enough meat. 3.5/5

Gyoza:
I've never been so disappointed with gyoza before. One side is supposed to be soft and the other side crisp with slight burn marks. Well, theirs has burn marks around one side of each gyoza and the rest seemed raw. According to cooking expert, Tony this is due to the fact that it was cooked from frozen. The pork filling didn't have much taste and the dipping sauce had too much soy sauce. 1/5

Kuroi Tonkotsu:
Thin noodles in tonkotsu pork broth with ma-yu/ black garlic oil topped with 3 thin slices of chashu pork, hard-boiled egg, kikurage, and scallions. There's not enough broth. 3.5/5

Kaedama:
Tony let me try his thick flat noodles for comparison since we have the same broth anyway. These noodles are unnecessarily chewy. It was like chewing on cartilage. I heard/felt a pop from my mouth - my jaw locked for a second. ""They were softer the other time I went here"". 1/5

Those red chairs are so darn heavy. I workout but I was not expecting those suckers to be THAT heavy. I kinda like my back and I don't want to break it. The consensus: INCONSISTENCY. How things were cooked and tasted on opening day is different from 2 days ago and last night. I'm willing to give them another try and hopefully, I catch them on a ""good night"".

5349057,2014-03-07,2,Tv19MQrLgdsvSG0myMYZBw,"This review is solely based on their second day of soft opening on March 4th, 2014. 

After hearing how Hiromaru will be taking over Cafe de Japon's location, I was excited. No wait, let me rephrase. I was ecstatic. Especially after trying some of their ramen at the Japanese Festival, which took place at Rio last year -- I just couldn't wait. And now it has finally opened.

After much of my nagging and broken record-esq behavior .. my three friends and I made our way to Hiromaru for a late lunch on that Tuesday. We got there a little bit after 3 PM and the restaurant was fairly empty. We were greeted as soon as I opened the door and were seated right away. Well, two of my friends arrived earlier, so Andrew C. and I just joined them at the table.

The menu for Hiromaru is fairly simple. There are a total of 4 different ramens for you to choose from and about 7 side order/appetizers. Now, because it was still soft opening, everything that we ordered was free. However, it was a limited menu. We were limited to two different ramens: the carbonara ramen and the shiroi tonkotsu. As for the sides, we got to choose from: Hiromaru buns (pork buns), karaage (fried chicken), and Hiromaru Japanese curry.

Andrew C. and I decided to get the carbonara ramen and shiroi tonkotsu so we could try both and share. And our friends decided to get a side of the karaage and Japanese curry. After we ordered our food, we were served a small bowl of salad right away to start our meal, which was nice. And before we knew it, our orders were filtering out ....

Hiromaru Japanese Curry ($8.50) - this side dish was the first to come out. It came with a small bowl/plate of curry, rice, slice of pork, and asparagus. I didn't like it. The curry was runny, watery, and pretty average. It reminds me of the type of curry that you buy at grocery stores in boxes where you mix water in with powder to create the dish. You can skip this. 

Karaage ($5.00) - Only one phrase could justify this side dish. ""Surprisingly good."" Seasoned dark meat deep fried with a light batter. It was delicious. Try it. 

Carbonara Ramen ($10.95) - This dish is your east and west fusion into one. Nothing can get more fusion than this right?! I mean, carbonara RAMEN? Where do you find this? At Hiromaru. From what I've heard and read, this is what made Hiromaru famous. The amazing creativity behind this is beyond genius. But I'm confused about what I'm supposed to be thinking while eating it. The soup base is tonkotsu with milk. It didn't look creamy per say, but it was a milky texture. Flavor wise, it was a little bland. If no one told me it was a tonkotsu base, I would've never known. There was two strips of bacon in there as well. They were grilled before hand. You know what would have made it even better? If it was cut up in pieces like it was shown in the picture on their menu. The noodles were a little flat and thick. It's typically not the type of noodles I prefer in ramen but it was cooked perfectly. It was al-dente, just the way I like it.

Shiroi Tonkotsu ($7.95) - Was this what I ate during the ramen festival? It tasted a whole lot different here. First bite? Delicious. Second bite? Wonderful. Third, fourth, fifth, sixth bite? I think I'm going to have to pass. This was a tonkotsu soup base with salted sauce and brown garlic oil. The soup was light but heavy in flavor. It was salty and garlic-y. I normally like salty foods but too much of it, especially in something heavy such as this, can get boring. After the first bite, I knew that this dish could risk running a flat line for me. Too much of something is still too much and in this case, I think the salted sauce tipped it over. The slice of pork, however, was nicely seasoned but because of how salty the soup is, it was an overkill for me. Everything started tasting the same. Aside from that, the shiroi ramen came with thin noodles but they were a bit on the softer side, which meant that they slightly overcooked it. 

Now, don't get me wrong .. the food is good but I'm not sure if it's for me. Though, I may definitely go again just to see if they did anything different from the soft opening. I may have to ask if they can skip the salted sauce and make sure the noodles are al dente as well. 

Overall, I think disappointment may be the word for this little trip. Hopefully my second trip here will be better.",oqTZC9WriodTCby6jl0LfQ,4,2,3,thl1cs0sehSfsPIntawSiA

The service is 5 star and the food is just too good for words the decor shouts japan. We loved the food and the entire experience the chef needs to be commended for the wonderful food that comes out of his kitchen.

There are only four different choice of noodles.  Everything on the menu is pork.  No other option.  The shiroi ramen flavor was tasteless.  The egg which comes with the ramen was cold in the noodles.  The noodle was a bit undercooked.  The soup just wasn't hot enough.  The staff are nice but seems like they are still in process of training.",DNxBV9OfvwNkNWZwLCyDkg,1,1,2,IoP5C_S6NczwO-hZ6pC9lQ

I loved the interior - simple modern setting that was bright but easy on the eyes - which was divided into 3 sections.  When you walk in there is a bar-type area with tables in front.  There is a framed division to the large room on the left, and then a room with large sliding doors that provide privacy for large parties.  The Japanese server ladies were very pleasant and attentive, and that continued for the rest of the meal.  Very nice experience.

We order 2 ramens.  Shiroi Tonkatsu is a salt broth-based soup, and Kuroi Tonkatsu is a garlic and seafood salt broth.  That's according to the menu, but honestly we didn't know what to expect.  We also ordered a gyoza which was just okay.  The two ramens, however, were probably the best Japanese ramens I've had in the U.S.  The usual ramens have a soup taste that's fairly indistinct.  It's one of those where you like it, but you don't really know why.  But the two bowls here, had very distinctive  taste that was highly satisfying.  Shiroi had a distinctive garlic taste, and Kuroi had a mix of garlic and a toasty sesame seed-like flavor.  Very different but both very good.  The soups were a bit greasy, but that did not detract from the taste.

Having recently been to a couple of places in L.A. that I thought were very good - Jinya and Men Oh - I wasn't expecting much but came away with a place that others will have to try to beat.  


Table-for-1 Factor:  I think with the sizable bar area and the fact it is ramen, the set up is all there for you to enjoy Hiromaru on your own.",52Oq0fCJWaHpQtuKqTkN4g,2,1,5,XDlsVIOkeVt1yq_WkwlMbw

The ramen was okay. The soup had a weird taste to it. They gave us options of having it mild, spicy, or spicy spicy. 

The chashu bowl was small for it's price. The taste wasn't bad until I got to the bottom and it got oily.",kF_Wl3sAEo-mTQ9Z5zohLw,2,2,2,tgX9AzrUPX10JZEA7T2LQA

I had their tate-yama ramen, the broth wasnt as rich as described i think the bean sprouts made it bland. The thick noodles was tender the way i like it but the chasiu topping was too thin compare to ramen sora. Soft opening menu this time, maybe it will be better next time.

Note: You should love the noble piglet! Pork and pork based items dominates ~96% of their non-beverage menu.

There has been a lot of buzz regarding the opening of Hiromaru Fusion Ramen since the Ramen Festival at the Rio last year. And finally they are opened for business! Excited!!!

What I love about this type of ramen restaurants is the fact that their menu is so simple and straightforward. Just four (4) ramen to select from, and whether to upgrade some add-ons to the ramen (extra Chashu, roasted seaweed and even cheese!), or side orders of Gyoza, Chashu Pork Bowl, Karaage, Curry and Hiromaru Buns. None of that 150 menu items from your typical Chinese American Take-Out restaurants, or the 10 page menus at older American diners. Essentially their laser focus attention to making what few items they have on their menu to the highest degree of expertise their kitchen crew can mustered on a daily basis is what I admire. 

So here is what you can order from their 1 page menu:

Carbonara Ramen ($10.95) - the chef's signature fusion ramen inspired by the Italian Carbonara pasta. The soup base consist of Tonkotsu pork broth and milk (expect watery broth and not thick traditional Carbonara pasta sauce). It is topped with still runny egg yolk, bacon, Shio and fresh scallions, resulting in a beautiful presentation of yummy ramenness.  Flat thick noodle is served with this bowl of ramen, I assume to better grip the creamy fusion ramen broth, but eating this without making any unintentional splashes is very difficult. If you can manage that difficult task, mad props to you Ninja!

Shiroi Tonkotsu ($7.95) - according to the Chef and the menu, ""the best salted ramen is created with salted sauce and brown garlic oil.""  I have not heard or read otherwise, so I shall defer to the ramen expert on this one. This most traditional of the 4 ramen options is served with Tonkotsu pork broth with salted sauce. Chashu pork, hard boiled egg, fresh scallions and Kikurage tops thin ramen noodles to complete this entree. The soup is delicious (at my limit for how salty I like my ramen broth), but I prefer slightly thicker and chewier ramen.

Kuroi Tonkotsu ($8.95) - this is a special salted ramen made with Chef Kawai's master's secret ""Ma-Yu"" (black garlic oil) recipe.  It is essentially the Shiroi Tonkotsu with the special ma-yu.

Tate-Yama Ramen ($9.95) - easily the tallest ramen you can order from the menu, which is inspired by the largest mountain in Chef Kawai's home prefecture. The double portion of thick ramen (aka Kaedama) and mounds of vegetables (bean sprouts & cabbage), is served with a soy sauce base + salted sauce and baby-backbone fat, Chasu, hard-boiled egg.

The typical ramen-ya side dishes are available for ordering and some. The Hiromaru Buns (steamed buns + Butabara pork belly in original Hiromaru sauce) sounds amazing and tasted as good as it looks! The Japanese mayo with the lettuce was an interesting creamy touch.  Chicken Karaage was fried nicely, but still moist inside and is perfect as is or with a light squeeze of lemon.

No alcohol is served, at least not now, but sodas and teas and bottled water are available to help lower the sodium concentration is your stomach.

The decor is simple and modern, they really did a great job renovating the space vacated by Cafe de Japon. Even the large ""private"" room off to the side looks nice and inviting, and ready to accommodate patrons.

Fast service, yummy food and attentive staff, so far so good! Ramen portion is average or slightly smaller, I can do 2 bowls for sure, maybe 3 bowls when I am in beast mode. So the 2x ramen noodle option at the time you place your order is recommended if you frequent food eating contests.

5 ramen spoons outta 5.

Food: ehhh
Ambiance: bright, clean
Service: good

Long:
Food: My group of 9 was able to try all the ramens and several appetizers. Here's what I remember / what I had a chance to try
Karaage - liked the flavor, but was not as crispy as I would have liked
Fried rice - really good! Definitely recommend it
Shiro ramen - wayyyy tooo salty. SO salty. The texture of the noodles was perfect, but the broth was soooo salty as to be borderline inedible. 
Kuro(i) ramen - I thought this was better than the shiro ramen, and it was nice that they use a lot of the oil. Some places only use a little bit, rather than saturating the soup with it. 
Carbonara ramen - I did not get a chance to try this, but it was a hit at the table. 

Ambiance: Nice and bright, clean. The chairs don't have backs, which was fine, except that it meant I had to put my purse on the floor (there was no room on the table), which I am not a huge fan of. I also didn't have anywhere to put my jacket, so I just folded it up and sat on it. Perhaps they should add little hooks to the table or wall where we can hang our bags and / or coats. 

Service: Good, not really memorable. They did a fantastic job of splitting the bill without an attitude and waited until our entire party arrived to take our order (though we were allowed to be seated). 

I would come here again if I was in town, but would not drive all the way from Henderson - easier to just go to Monta on Eastern if it's not going to be that much better.",GQ_2kpEee1KXZCKEtpeEfw,1,1,3,_kzbWSHV0CONe8IRrWUc0w
