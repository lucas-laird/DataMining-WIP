After about 15 min like 4 more tables showed up. We ordered the breakfast pizza and the French toast. The food was nothing special for the price. French Toast was 11 bucks! Idk if that's normal here, but jeeze that is a little crazy. Service was weird. I felt that the other waitresses were better than ours.We sat down and were immediately asked what we wanted to eat before what we wanted to drink. Felt like we waited 5 min before getting coffee ( we overheard another server tell our waitress to get us coffee) and several tables got their food before us and we ordered first. I think we are going to try another place for breakfast while staying here.",5AveOxbb3S8_AvWchm2uYg,1,0,1,VJVCaDJYKvLMO8o6RDekAg

Yes, the prices are more expensive than if you were to go to a regular grocery store - that's to be expected for an on property store. It's about convenience, not the lowest price. For such a small store they really did a great job of providing the necessities - anything you would want to pick up for a quick breakfast or lunch, they have. They also have a good variety of health and beauty necessities and some clothing. Fun asian food items. Super friendly staff.",LGlk-Zb69sGQwJVu2w4U_Q,1,0,4,8AM1SS0zyWP6ezrjGmm-fQ
