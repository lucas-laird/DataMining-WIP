So, it is a wonder I never made it back, until recently. Thanks to this location, I have delicious crispy chili cheddar fries at hand when the craving hits. Now, don't turn me into a liar, you must consume the fries immediately so they are crispy to the end.

One thing I particularly like is that they serve a mix of ""Mexican"" (tacos, burritos, etc.) and ""American"" (chili cheese fries, burgers, etc.). So if you're craving a mix of items, or are ""dining"" with someone who doesn't want ""Mexican"", this is the place to choose - especially late at night after some drinking. 

My personal fav is the chipotle tacos. They're cheap and tasty. I'm also a sucker for their macho nachos. They also have good hot sauces (those little packets), but I often neglect to remember just how crazy hot their hot sauce is (and I like hot).

This particular location is pretty good. They never mess up orders and the drive-thru is fast.

3786494,2012-05-21,1,UXkD2CbW8BnTpYyUTsrCTQ,"Del Taco is my favorite fast food joint, ever.

Service is pretty speedy and the food is dangerously addictive. (If the drive-thru looks ridiculous, I don't mind heading inside to order bc the staff are pretty speedy.)

Out of everything I've tried on the menu, the Macho Burrito is probably my fave. I get it with the beef and beans combo (bc you can choose either seasoned beef, grilled chicken, or a combo of beef and beens). This Macho Burrito is exactly as it sounds... Macho. It has your choice of meat filling, red + green sauces, tomatoes, lettuce, onions, cheddar cheese, and sour cream.

The Deluxe 1/2lb Bean & Cheese Burrito is also a good one. It's packed with beans, cheese, red or green sauce, lettuce, tomatoes, and sour cream. It's pretty ginormous, so I don't recommend putting it down once you've started on this guy. And I also recommend keeping it partially wrapped while you're eating to avoid a mess.

Another really awesome thing about Del Taco is that they have crinkle cut fries. Yes, crinkle cut fries!!! (Crinkle cut) fries at a taco joint is pretty freakin' awesome. 

BTW - Where can I buy Del Taco's Inferno Sauce?!!! It's dang good for fast food hot sauce and it actually has a kick.

The drive up guy was hilarious! Super friendly was patient.... We may have taken a minute or five to order everything lol. 

I got the hard shell tacos and seriously I don't care who you are those are the best darn tacos ever! Their food is so yummy especially at midnight!  love love love this location will for sure be coming back here when we come back to Henderson.",xiFQPHVW9T7sMkk2S0-D4Q,0,0,5,E9pFrTZxcUyyNqx1Nd2_sg

The food was good, especially the Caramel Cheesecake bites and the employees were very friendly to us.",jN5cHuhOQKGdXB8zIawmrQ,1,0,5,Ni6kDo2_Q8kkcP8AZv7f5Q

She gives me the corporate number which is there comment line and it goes directly voicemail I would like to talk to somebody who is an actual person not a machine. I will never be going to del taco ever again. Now I understand why it took them so long to give me my card back. I give this place no stars but it's making me give them one star,T9PA0omIjxQJre-pcLBaPQ,1,0,1,IVcQSQd-dvkTj2FXkjPk2A
5492183,2012-10-30,8,UXkD2CbW8BnTpYyUTsrCTQ,"I am done with Del Taco! My boyfriend and I were starving after we went to Walmart so I suggested getting something to eat from here since it's in the same plaza and it was already 2 AM. 

We both got the shredded beef burrito and bacon break fiesta which comes with two egg and cheese burritos and hash brown sticks. The burritos tasted awful. The tortilla was hard and old. I took a bite from each burrito and I was done. The shredded beef was chewy! The hash brown sticks were so greasy and didn't even taste like hash browns. Yes, I know I shouldn't be expecting much from a fast food place especially at 2 AM.  Never again!!!",dOFyIGbyfB69VB4pnoKqQA,11,7,1,nVtVtvc5QknfR9_-2dMaig

Manager needs to gets this on wrap cause this is the worst ever! They didn't even acknowledge the fact everyone was waiting so long! A simple we are so sorry for the wait would be nice! The worst experience ever!,s6D-Z0RiiQLk60DQisO0rg,2,0,1,sG0lN6qPSoXFuW2mjyIaww
