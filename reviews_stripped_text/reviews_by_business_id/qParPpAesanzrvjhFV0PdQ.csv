Manager apparently does not keep stock of napkins or utensils either :( Food was decent, but I'll never take step in there again!",RELHx27IHb0Hs1QHf9NXWw,0,0,1,5n7adsJV738FLALbseyqOg

When I finally got to the window the girl handed me my bag with my meal box turned sideways so of course coleslaw was everywhere. Then, I get home and find napkins, but NO eating utensils!  Someone really needs to MANAGE this property in other than title only. The blonde at the window was trying to make sure she lived up to the ""blondes are airheads"" motto; asked me three times which sauce I wanted.  I believe I'll find another location next time.",T_CSAJ7GQdnRWnC43L8rFQ,0,0,1,Ne_CKypX0e5vuwvoetLuUg

As soon as I pointed it out, they apologized and quickly fixed the problem. The only thing that kinda irks me is that just about every time I use their bathroom, it seems that they never have any paper towels to dry my hands. 

As for the food, if you didnt already know, 90 percent of their food is fried. Which means it tastes really good while at the same time its kinda actually bad for you. Oh well, you know what they say. All in moderation! They do have some grilled items available which is quite tasty. But come on, thats not what you really came here for, right?",0FMte0z-repSVWSJ_BaQTg,5,5,4,4PhXhxizG8f2XkrXIfzCLQ

The bad news:  As soon as we made it a habit to pick up a Big Catch -- they killed it.

The good news.  The staff here is very pleasant and have to say ""I'm sorry"" a lot, but they do it with aplomb.  

The bad news.  They have to say ""I'm sorry"" so much because of a lousy ordering system where they are always out of something.  Soft drinks one day, shrimp another day, onion rings another day.

But, since I seem to know what they are out of so often, I must like it enough to keep coming back.

I miss the Big Catch!!",l0pHjnR3JuRhcCxqjWwiqw,2,0,3,FK8OS3cjN8q1f1NUsfRWIw

Thanks so much for awesome customer service Selena! We will be back again!

It's smoked up and the employees look dirty.... Not like they just got dirty... I mean like bums.... If they look dirty then odds are they are dirty. (clean hands, ect..) Not like someone I would want to prepare anything for me.. Went in. I noticed these things while waiting in line for about 5 minutes (only 2 people of front of me) and walked out.....",Z39MZwIO0ZXs3ihoX9Hr3g,0,1,1,7QRhkh6gTn3fmi10MLk0AQ

This is a chain restaurant that seems to be everywhere around these parts.  Fried shrimps were da bomb!  Hush puppies were hella good too.  Nothing special about the fries.  This place hooks it up with the fried foods - Way too much batter for me though.

This place isn't in the greatest area.  However, inside was very clean - tables were wiped down and all.  Some of the fountain drinks were not working.

The manager from Fremont, CA. was awesome - greeted us with a smile, was friendly, and made us feel welcome.  He even rang the bell by the door as we walked out - Kool dude!  Someone...give this man a raise!

Will be back...thx.",b5Xvksa5eUDfrDJY66Btzg,0,0,4,qzAAeUQU-fKPaEsrtA24cg
