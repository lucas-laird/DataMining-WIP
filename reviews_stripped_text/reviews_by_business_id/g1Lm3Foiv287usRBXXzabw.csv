As I'm ordering my sandwich the woman building my sandwich is giving the customers in front of me dirty looks. When my sandwich comes out of the toaster oven the lady just sets both hands down and looks at me with an attitude, like what do want. I will continue to come here because most of these workers don't last long anyway.",KXcRKSjoJpESpvozLXH42w,1,0,1,P4c3XUmHH_bAdMYV0Eus0g

The lady told us, there was people that walked in the store to whom come first than the people who order through the app... eh, wrong answer! This time, same ordeal, order isn't ready yet. Told us to pick it up at 9:47pm. It is now 10:02  and the lady still hasn't made our flipped food. I'll never come here again. Worst costumer servicer ever. They don't even apologize for the inconvenience!!!",21GyRIrmYEswHW0Ih_igeg,1,0,1,I0cu5qjz09gosIMLazvN6g
1331522,2016-06-21,0,g1Lm3Foiv287usRBXXzabw,This is the worst place. I work grave came here to eat on my 30min lunch. Waited in line to eat leaving 20min left. Come to find out they won't take my debit card. Gave some excuse. Fuck you ppl! Unable to eat lunch now you fucking bastards. No remorse.... not like I have much option 2am in the morning.,-tkF9tLShT5t4xsFf6xCEw,1,0,1,OhWyjUN9Q5oUFiBnEG67Nw
2030503,2017-10-20,0,g1Lm3Foiv287usRBXXzabw,This place is the worst. One of the reasons why I trust subway most of the time is because the make the sandwiches in front of you. I don't mind how long they last with each picky customer. And I understand you are in the rush to get everyone served but please wash your hands after a cash transaction if you are making me a sandwich.

2471575,2014-12-02,1,g1Lm3Foiv287usRBXXzabw,"I just moved to Vegas a few weeks ago but had already had lunch here several times and was intending on eating here a lot more.  I ordered a footlong sub and once I paid I asked for a cup for water and was told that they were out of cups.  So I said, well can I get another cup, they said no, because the other cups were so expensive.

So, I was now left with a substantial lunch with nothing to drink and did not feel that I should be forced into buying a fountain drink.  I asked the manager and he told me that I should have  asked if they had cups before ordering, I said maybe you should have told people (or put a sign up).  I have eaten at Subway hundreds of times and never been denied a cup, so never felt that I should ask ahead of time.  The manager was quite surly with me telling me ""well, it's quite the catch 22 then isn't it"".

I just can't believe how stingy some of these fast food joints have become, they have  now lost a regular customer (and I had brought in three other friends to eat there today), all over arguing over a 2c cup, wonderful, won't be eating there again.",q_Hcc55zLZGi7OO1N30iOA,0,0,1,X1-tXC2SL91P8HCrynQlGg

The only reason I've come back here is because it's close to my house but I am NEVER coming back ever again. 9 times out of 10 employees are RUDE and talk crap while I'm still in the store in Spanish! News flash some white people speak Spanish. I ordered a 6 inch BMT with no salami and I added bacon. The girl, Lesslie (on my receipt), snapped at me and said we don't substitute meat on sandwiches. So....can I just add bacon...? She rudely let me know it was going to be extra. I already knew that because I get this sandwich all the time. I don't normally like causing a scene in public especially in an environment that made me uncomfortable between the employees. But my 5.68 cents got me TWO pieces of ham and THREE pieces of pepperoni. What a sick joke. I get that bacon is 75 cents extra. But almost 5 dollars equals 5 pieces of meat that doesn't even cover the sandwich? What a joke. At least she gave me TWO napkins in case I make a mess...I decided to not get the meal and go next door to Wendy's to get a drink because these people don't deserve any of my money. 

DO NOT GO HERE!!!!",-YV1yESQXqR3vpIgBjKDsw,1,0,1,RrUEsC9dsM5LRCODPeP38Q
5447306,2014-06-20,0,g1Lm3Foiv287usRBXXzabw,"There were two girls scheduled to work and only one actually working.  The other was doing something with a clipboard and kept running her pen up and down the page and glancing at us as we waited to be assisted.  As a side note to this person, you have a job because of customers.  Customers should ALWAYS come first. 

The food was good, it's Subway and it's one of those things where once you've had one you've had them all.  

The prep area was not stocked - the young lady had to run back to the back twice for two difference condiments and did NOT wash her hands upon returning. The drink station was extremely limited in it's offerings and the lady that helped us gave us no napkins.

(on the plus side, this is one of the only Subways I've seen that carries peanut butter cookies, but they were just ""ok"" nothing to write home about).",kuJZm9Bpj0ZMnSruSvBjig,0,0,2,bTyz9L6G-gnTRgAdaPPcEw
5848339,2016-04-30,5,g1Lm3Foiv287usRBXXzabw,"This location has got to be one of the worst in town. The night we visited they were out of soup, yes I wanted some broccoli and cheese soup with my sandwich. The gal tells me, if I would like some I can wait 15 minutes for them to heat some up. I declined. They were also out of Iced tea, she said they don't make it at night time. This location is 24-7 and it was only 7:00 pm. Anyways, the worst offense was that my wheat sub roll was dry and stale. I called the next day and voiced my concerns with their operations. The Manager was apologetic and said she would look into it. She seemed genuinely concerned which was nice however it is what it is and I don't like to be in the position to have to complain :(",deL6e_z9xqZTIODKqnvRXQ,11,5,1,lHHfmsMkN7Vwq9OFqv6KQg
