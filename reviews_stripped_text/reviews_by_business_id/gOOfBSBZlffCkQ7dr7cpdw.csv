10057,2017-12-25,0,gOOfBSBZlffCkQ7dr7cpdw,"Today was my third time coming into Chica, My husband and I came on Tuesday for the lunch. We were looking for something different and Chica always popped up, so we decided to go ahead and try it. Our server was Adriene, she was knowledgeable and very funny. She made a few suggestions about lunch we had to try. My husband had the burger after going back and forth about it, our server insisted he would love it, and he did. I had the steak salad, and it was delicious, and not too much dressing which was nice. She (adriene) talked about the milk cake (I forgot what it's called) and raved about it, we took her suggestion and tried it, it did not disappoint. I came back Wednesday by myself, and my server again was adriene. She remembered me, my last name and called me by it, and asked if I'd prefer sparkling wAter again as we had the the day before.  You don't find customer service like this often and I told her it was because of the great time we had before that I came back. I asked her a few questions about the menu again, she said I should try the shrimp salad. The salad was exactly what I was looking for. Light and the right amount as I had dinner reservations in the night. Today we had john as our server, he was great, knowledgeable and just as friendly and helpful as the last. We are the chicken salad sandwich and chicken ceaser salad. Great ingredients but no dessert today. All around a great great place to eat and try different food from all the other places you are used to.",uKJ6J2D_Jp__v-t3CZflAQ,0,0,5,ULakcBDTMvXbX-USk-oFiQ
23741,2017-07-04,1,gOOfBSBZlffCkQ7dr7cpdw,We came here for our anniversary dinner  with  high  hopes that we would be eating Latin inspired food and have a nice  dinner. however we were very disappointed with the service and food. Our waiter was not knowledgeable on the dishes being served and gave us wrong information. The sweet plantains were very disappointing in that they were not maduros and were very green and dry to eat. I really wanted to enjoy this place since I was excited to see some Latin food in Vegas but sadly it did not meet our expectations. Maybe if u don't know the food it would be acceptable. Would not go again due to service AND food being disappointing. Two stars!,UN_jdoB2GRnt8DwEBgYRQg,0,0,2,CN1i0IGoh60Mr_e2IGLnzw

Between all the people I ate with, no one had a complaint about anything and at the end we said that if we had to pick our favorite thing, it would just be everything we had eaten.

154126,2017-07-15,0,gOOfBSBZlffCkQ7dr7cpdw,"Wow my new favorite Latin restaurant in Las Vegas!!!! I cannot say one single bad thing about it. The decor was very tasteful and the ambiance with the salsa, merengue and bachata music playing at a reasonable volume where you can enjoy a conversation, but still jam to the music was awesome. For appetizers we had the empanadas which were filled with ground beef, rice, beans and plantains was phenomenal. We also ordered the chicken chicharrones which I initially thought was only going to be the fried skin, but it was not... it was like chicken wings that were flashed fried and it had an amazing spicy sauce to it. For our main courses we had the Brazilian style steak with grits and that by far was the best plate of the evening. The grits were very flavorful and the steak was so tender I could cut it with my fork without using a knife. My partner had the halibut with the plantains and the halibut came with a mango sauce it was so flaky and tender, I have to say I was one of the best fishes I've had this year. Save room for dessert, the tres leches and the buñuelos were to die for. When you go there ask for Monica to be your waitress as her service was beyond exceptional, she knew all the highlights of all the plates and recommended her favorites which is what we ended up choosing and we did not go wrong. I'm dying to go back and try their brunch all I heard from all the employees there is that brunch is even better than dinner. I highly recommend this restaurant if you're at the Venetian or you're in the mood for Latin fair. Even though this place considers itself Peruvian fusion food, I have to say that there were strong influences of Cuban, Nicaraguan, Venezuelan and Argentine flair to it. Staff is very nice and they made the dining experience so much more worth it. I can't wait to go back.",vrYY6ByqCS-2We-raSqjXQ,1,0,5,-PDLwyFzPPTUq47YIHQ4tw

191655,2017-06-17,2,gOOfBSBZlffCkQ7dr7cpdw,"Had dinner at this restaurant last night to celebrate our anniversary. Very pretty restaurant and nice atmosphere.
When we first walked in the hostess was very nice and friendly and wished us a happy anniversary. We informed her that we would prefer to sit at the bar for drinks before dinner. At the bar I ordered a drink that tasted like syrup and after 2 sips I told the bartender that I couldn't drink it and would order something different. We sat at the bar for an hour and when we got the bill, she  charged me $15.00 for the drink that I hardly drank. 
We were then escorted to our ""table "" which was a high up seat in front of the restaurant and not the most comfortable by the way. We asked if we could sit in the main dining room instead and was told unfortunately nothing was available.  So we stayed where we were and ate our dinner. The food was good. I had no problem with that.
All in all we were not happy that we celebrated our anniversary there because they did absolutely nothing to make it special. Charged us for a drink that I hardly drank, put us in a corner high chair and didn't even offer us a free dessert like most places do. 
We visit Vegas 3 times a year and always stay at the Venetian. We also always celebrate our birthdays and anniversaries in Vegas. We love fine dining and don't mind spending money but to be treated so shabbily on our special occasion was totally unacceptable.  There are much better places to go to with much better treatment.",MDjrbCtNY7MErPtT4topJQ,1,0,1,1nPsz8uAWdRw-k3dZ4s6iA

We've had Peruvian food before in New York and was excited to taste it again...ceviche and Pisco Sours here we come! We booked a 9:30 pm reservation after the LOVE The Beatles show at the Mirage and Chica was a perfect choice since it's located in the casino level of the Venetian Hotel, which is a short 5 minute walk across the street from the Mirage. We shared a variety of 5 tapas style dishes and everything was tasty and divine!!! It was a perfect amount of food, without getting overly stuffed. The cocktail list is also impressive and innovated. Hey what can I say, it's Vegas so of course it's pricey, but at least here, you get a delicious and unique meal rather than something standard. If you're like me, step out of the box and try something different from what you can get from home. Of the 3 restaurants we booked this trip, Chica was our FAV!

286871,2017-08-15,0,gOOfBSBZlffCkQ7dr7cpdw,"A big part of the Vegas experience is to try new restaurants and after reading some positive reviews of Chica, the new South American restaurant in the Venetian, our party of five decided to try it out on a Saturday night.  All in all, this was an amazing experience and Chica definitely won each of us over.  I will undoubtedly visit Chica again in subsequent Vegas trips and would suggest the restaurant to all friends and family.

We got there at around 9:30 and found the atmosphere to be lively, yet not too loud as to take away from the experience at all -- it was a trendy restaurant with a DJ playing but older crowds won't find this unappealing.  The decor in the restaurant was very well done and we were all enjoying the artwork throughout as well as the touches of plants and greens in pots hanging from the ceiling.

We were a very hungry group so we decided to order many small plates to share and honestly not a single one disappointed any of us.  Everything we tried was wonderful but a few of the standouts were the asado negro arepas, pulled pork tacos, empanadas, gaucamole, hoppin Jose rice, arepa basket and the sweet plantains.  Everything offered a new twist on dishes that most of us had previously eaten in some form or fashion but it all worked remarkably well and we left extremely full and content (at a much cheaper price than other Vegas restaurants as well).

Final part of the night: dessert.  Sara Steele, the Executive Pastry Chef of the restaurant, came over to our table to chat with us (completely unsolicited) prior to ordering and she helped us decide on a couple of the desserts while also talking to us about a bit of the history behind the restaurant.  To our surprise, Sara brought the desserts out herself, added two churro pops to the order (so everybody in our party of five could have their own) and also added some lemon buñuelos for us to try -- both on the house.  She then talked to each individual dessert that we tried and let me tell you, while they were all amazing, the churro ice cream pops were truly mindblowing.  Imagine cold vanilla ice cream covered in a shell of churro all on an edible, crunchy churro stick -- it was one of the best desserts I've ever had and the whole experience of chatting with Sara truly made the entire night special.  

Overall, I loved my experience at Chica (enough to feel compelled to write my first Yelp review) and cannot wait to plan a trip back to Vegas to eat again at Chica.  Go here and try as many dishes as your stomachs can handle -- you won't be disappointed!",mo1VGuVVLDHRe9DteMhMQw,0,1,5,-S963X9c1eDhZhNgpUfeMw

The concierge suggested we try Chica , a Latin restaurant that had just opened up and had quite the buzz. We decided to give it a try and it turned into a wonderful evening. We were seated in some incredibly comfortable chairs in the middle of the restaurant next to a very interesting painting of a girl laying on her side. Service was wonderful, our waiter Georgio was very pleasant and professional and answered all our questions including mine that had to deal with my gluten allergy. This is what I was afraid of most but he explained in detail all the options and gave me some wonderful suggestions to combine to make my dinner a hit. His assistant Sean who was in charge of the wine selection picked out some incredible wines that we may have overlooked if not for his gentle prodding. Our appetizers came to the table to share , then our amazing dishes which were exploding with color and flavor. Then we tried some of their super special Venezuelan chocolate cake and a few other special sweets. At one point in the evening I got up to use the ladies room and when I asked Georgio where it was , instead of pointing me in the direction of the ladies room like anyone else would he put his arm in mine and walked me the whole way( this blew me away as I knew he was busy but stopped everything to take care of me!!!)

Chica was a great anniversary date night for me and my husband. We tried the meyer lemon chicken and the braised beef. Both delicious!

I wasn't crazy about the potato salad, but the chicken was very tender. The sauce with the braised beef was tasty but again the black eyed peas side dish wasn't my cup of tea. 

The atmosphere of the restaurant is beautiful! It feels like you're dining al fresco in Argentina. And I love that they give you plates to share food. Feels almost family style. :-)

However the item that stole the show for us was a basket full of fresh, warm flavorful mini arepas and Peruvian butter. I could eat those all day!!

I can easily say that these vegan tacos were the most delicious tacos I've ever had in my life. The flavors were bold, robust and vibrant leaving me wanting more after each bite. 

Now I know a lot of you reading this review right now are not vegan, so I snapped a couple of photos of my coworkers dishes for you. I went with a group of 13 and each person loved everything about their meal. 

Chica exposed me to flavors that I've never experienced before. I'm not even a little bit on the fence about this place, I highly recommend it and you'll thank me later for this.

It's a mahi mahi with a little bit white corn, balanced with a little hot little red pepper slices. Spicy and tangy. Then when the pork tacos came, they hooked us and again, no photos were taken. The pork was juicy with a hint of smokiness that probably came from mole. The pickles on the side had a spicy sour kick which went really well with the tacos.

It is quite possible they had an off night as I've read so many positive reviews but that was not our experience. We had a reservation and it still took them over 10 minutes to seat us, even though the restaurant was not busy. They brought half the entrees out and we waited over 10 minutes before finally saying something. We were also not impressed with the food. I had the steak & kale salad and the steak was over seasoned. The lemon chicken was too dry and potato salad had no flavor. For a restaurant charging $20-$60 for plates, your food and service need to be on point. The runner bringing out our food also weren't train right, crossing over people and placing plates in the middle instead of in front of the person with the entree. It was a disappointing experience to say the least.

I will say that our waitress was great and the manager competed us the late entrees and bought us a round of shots. Thank you for rectifying the situation.",enoAZbr3OgX6_4RmJrPkxw,1,0,3,rEv9iv-h8Vl3iFoAqlk7YA

The drink menu is so unique, the gluten free arepas are soooooooo great. But the chicken (I got the half) was just mind blowing. It was seasoned so perfectly, bone in, grilled. And it changed my life a lotta bit. I wish I would have got the whole. I did get the gluten free arepa basket, they swapped out half of them because I don't do cheese for the non dairy ones. I opened these mini miracles and put my chicken inside. 

I'm telling you, this place just gets it. Wow wow wow. Come here and you will be amazed. 

We sat on the couches which I usually don't prefer, but it was enjoyable. Especially with friends. They refilled water. Kept giving me refills of the unsweetened green tea. And recommended all the right drinks.

1569186,2017-09-23,0,gOOfBSBZlffCkQ7dr7cpdw,"I came here for my birthday brunch and made a reservation. We started with the chicken chicharones which were so delicious and full of flavor. They came out hot and fresh and cooked perfectly. We had ordered espresso filled churros to start with but they forgot about them and ended up coming out late. I am a churro addict and I was not impressed with these churros at all. No one at my table enjoyed them. Lucky for us, because they came out so late they were free. The sweet corn pancakes were delicious, for some people they were too different in flavor but I really enjoyed them. They did not taste like cornbread at all and had the perfect flavor and sweetness. Dulce de leche French toast was probably my favorite thing we ordered, it was so delicious and one of the best French toast I've had. I had the lemon donuts which did not last at all because again, they were so delicious and fluffy. We also ordered pancetta eggs Benedict. The pancetta was way too crispy and almost impossible to cut through which kind of ruined the dish, but the flavor of the ""huancaina"" sauce was so good. It was kind of like a smoky chipotle hollandaise. But again it was hard to enjoy the dish because I couldn't eat it all together in one bite. you kind of have to pick the pancetta up and rip it apart with your teeth. My cousin got the steak and egg tacos, I did not get to try but she said they were delicious. My other cousin got the watercress Caesar salad and had to return it because she did not like it at all. In terms of flavor, I think this restaurant is a success. Their dishes are very unique and delicious. Price is a little steep for what you get, but not too bad for a higher end restaurant. We had made reservations for brunch on a Saturday which I do not think was necessary as the restaurant was empty the entire time. I had my mom and two sisters surprise me during brunch and the restaurant was able to accommodate, with limited menus which was kind of annoying that they could not order off of the same menu that the rest of the group did. I think if your group is above 9 they require a reservation and a $40 per person charge in a family style brunch, OR the option to pay $40 a person. The service was just OK. nothing spectacular. I felt like in the beginning everything was ridiculously slow. As the meal went on they were forgetting items and constantly having to be reminded. It was obvious to everyone in the group that our server was getting a bit irritated with having such a big group, and in turn his annoyance was annoying me. While this was delicious I probably would not go back, but I think it's a good place for everyone to try.",xTimtxT3p1zKrtfP9JRuZA,2,1,3,SSVgFsZU6NIlTyfIs1-vmA

Chica has been on my radar for a while.  Luckily my friend and I opted to try it out.  We received excellent service.  I feel as if we didn't have one waiter as many of the other staff were over to assist in various ways.  Water glasses were always kept full with our many food plates out promptly.

We started by sharing the Asado Arepas and empanadas.  The little corn cake arepas are topped with a braised short rib. Wow.  The flavor bursting from this little guy was incredible.  The empanadas could've been a little better.  I felt as they were overcooked just a tad without a lot of filling.  

We then shared the Cuban Sandwich and Meyers Lemon Chicken.  Both of these dishes were delicious.  The half of rotisserie chicken is topped with a chimichurri sauce.  The chicken is slow roasted and so tender and juicy.  It's accompanied with the Peruvian Potato Salad which makes this a very filling meal.  Loved it.  The sandwich is stacked with pork, smoked ham, pickles and cheese.  It's all pressed in a sweet roll and toasted. Both entree plates were pleasing!

For dessert came their Lemon Doughnuts.  I felt as if they weren't so much a doughnut but more like a fritter.  It was more fried dough rather than cake like.  Almost a half and half of the two. Don't get me wrong.  They had a wonderful infused lemon flavor with berry and chocolate drizzle.

We started with the classic ceviche with hamachi.   It was very fresh and the acid was perfectly balanced.  We later found out that we didn't get the plantain chips that come with it.  My husband brought it to the waiter's attention and the waiter apologized and to make it up, brought us plantain chips with guacamole! That was really nice of him.  The second app was the asado negro arepa.   It was fried arepa topped with braised short rib.  It was good, but kind of sweet.   It would be great if it had a bit of heat to balance the sweetness.  The last app was the octopus.   It was quite tasty and the octopus was well cooked.  Some reviewers complained of the saltiness, but seasoning was well balanced and the octopus was tender.  Would definitely order that again.  For entree, we ordered the filet with red grits.   We ordered the meat medium and I would say it was a bit under, but no complaints there.  The meat was really tender and juicy.   I would say the red grits was at the edge of being salty. If they added another pinch, it may have gone over, but it was right there.  The creamy grits is a perfect complement for low fat meat like the filet.   My only wish is that it came with more substantial veggie than a couple of grilled shishito peppers.  For dessert, we ordered their award winning lemon ricotta donuts.  They are airy and light for sure; however, flavor wise, I didn't taste much lemon nor ricotta.   I liked the fact that they weren't too sweet. Just not sure if it's really worth $15, but they do give you several (I think 5-6) of these little donuts   I'd say they are 1.5x the size of DD munchkin.  They don't offer decaf espresso, which is a shame.  The waiter even tried to make a cafe au lait with French press coffee brewed strong, but it wasn't tasty and there were bits of coffee grinds in the coffee, which made it difficult to drink, so we opted fora cortado instead, even though it's caffeinated.   Anyway, it's much like a latte than a cortado, but it was fine.  I hope they will offer decaf espresso in the future and peppermint tea as well!

Four of us ended up sharing three appetizers, two main courses, three side dishes, and two desserts. Nobody left hungry. For appetizers, we went with the grilled Peruvian octopus, green corn lollipops, and mushroom quesadilla. Each was delicious although the quesadilla was my favourite. It had charred mushrooms, blue cheese, string cheese, jalapeno pesto, and pickled onions. As an entree, each couple got porchetta with Crispy Yucca hash. It's a slow roasted suckling pig topped with Crispy brussel sprouts, fried Yucca, and pearled onion escabeche. Phenomenal! The side dishes we got were the Mac con queso (no, not anything like the Mac and cheese you get anywhere else - made with corn,  not macaroni), wild roasted mushrooms, and charred grilled cauliflower.

1827299,2017-05-15,0,gOOfBSBZlffCkQ7dr7cpdw,"Was so excited to see a new female chef enter into the Las Vegas dining scene! I enjoy Latin American food, and was anticipating the flavorsome cuisine to be something I would love. I was right. 

The restaurant took over the space the was previously DB Brasserie, located at the end of Restaurant Row connecting the Venetian|Palazzo. They did a fantastic job quickly transforming the atmosphere, relocating the bar/dining space & providing an entirely new interior. The lights are low, the vibe is fun, and it is an intimate but relaxed scene. 

My boyfriend and I decided to go opening night, which happened to fall on Mothers Day. We were quickly greeted and seated, excited to try all the new cuisine. Our waitress name was Carma, and she was fantastic. We brought our own bottle of Priorat 07, & she quickly introduced us to the Sommelier who provided us with a decanter. The corkage is $25 (we always go corkage first time), but the wine list looked extensive & well thought (will try off it next time).

We love to order too much food to be able to try all the flavors, and proceeded to order a wide selection from the menu! The menu is split up into a wide variety of small plates (hot & cold), a smaller selection of Latin inspired entrees, and a variety of side dishes. Off the small plates we got the: Chicken Chicharrones, the Grilled Corn Lollipops, the Trio of Picos, and the Watercress Caesar. For entrees we ordered Shrimp + Quinoa Cazuela, and the Asado Negro Braised Short Ribs. For sides we ordered the Papitas Chicas, after balking between that & the Mac Con Queso (next time).

The Trio of Picos came first, & were plated with Housemade Arepas, Plantains and Torilla Chips. The arepas came in a variety of flavors (cilantro, blue corn, beet) and were phenomenal. I also loved the plantains (sliced very thin/crispy) & I NEVER DO! The trio of picos were: Salsa Verde, Sweet Corn Poblano Pico & Fiery Tomato Salsa. They were all delicious (sweet corn = #1), but the Fiery Salsa had NO heat. Overall the dish was a great accompaniment, & would pair perfectly w/ one of their cocktails!

Next came the hot small plates: the Chicken Chicarrones, + the Grilled Corn Lollipops. The Chicken Chicarrones are not typical crispy chicarrones. We presumed they would be similar to the fried pork rinds we typically have when ordering chicarrones before. Thinking they would be crispy chicken skins, or thinly fried pieces. The dish came as heavily sauced bone-in wings, that were actually very moist, and difficult to eat in the setting. The flavors were spot on, but were so different from what we had assumed they would be, were not what we were looking for. The Grilled Corn Lollipops were also very different then we had envisioned, being a huge portion & unable to be nibbled on off the cob (the husk was braided for presentation vs. functionality). The balance of chile piquin, lime, butter and cotija cheese were so harmonious with the sweet corn though, the dish was devoured! We cut all the corn off the cob, and did not leave a single kernel behind.

Next we were presented the Watercress Caesar, that our waitress kindly split for us. The portion was XL, & perfect for sharing with 3+. I eat my salads bone dry, so the salad was overdressed for me, but perfect for my bf (dressing was well executed, I ate through it being overdressed). The watercress was SO DELICIOUS, & the croutons were seasoned/so fresh. 

Following the salad, came the entrees + side dish! The waitress did a fantastic job at coursing our plethora of food. I started w/ the Shrimp + Quinoa Cazuela, which came with Argentinian red shrimp as the feature. These shrimp had phenomenal texture, & you could tell they were recently caught. The beluga lentils within were delicious, but the portion of quinoa overwhelmed the corn poblano pico marmalade. We loved the top half of the dish, leaving the undressed Quinoa as a garnish for the phenomenal shrimp/pico placed on top.

Next I dug into the side dish of Papitas Chicas. OH. MY. GOODNESS. YUM. These are basically the most delicious house-made french fries you will ever have (so crispy & evenly salted), perfectly doused with creamy huancaína, topped with pancetta and scallions. These could NOT be more delicious!! Not overly sauced, not overly soggy. I dreamed about this sauce, and the perfectly executed crispy french fries. I will be back to get this dish, or would happily consume this for happy hour as my main.

Finally I tried the Asado Negro Braised Short Ribs. I could tell they were going to be phenomenal off the way my boyfriend was enjoying them. They were cooked to perfection, being so tender without the excessive fattiness. Paired with black eyed peas done two ways, with pickled onions (yum). I would definitely recommend this entree, & would order again to share!

We skipped dessert (so full), but ordered a glass of Tokaji, shots of espresso, & the French Press Brew. All delicious.

We can't wait to go back & try more!

On her recommendations we started with the short rib corn cake. They were these bite size burst of flavors. Then we had the octopus and these crispy chicken wings. The sauce was just spectacular.

We ordered the guacamole which should be fine on its own with such fresh ingredients - the salt was overpowering.  Arepas were awesome, never had them before and loved the unique flavors - beet, black bean, cilantro and cheese.  The classic ceviche was overly ""limey"", so sour I didn't get to taste the flavors of the dish.  The grilled corn lollipop was tasty with its natural sweetness.  We also had the mac con queso, again too salty.

I ordered the Pepita Crusted Lamb.  Again way too salty but I appreciated the perfect medium rare more on the rare preparation per my request.  I couldn't really taste the lamb, just the saltiness of it all.  I did enjoy the crispy squash blossoms that accompanied the dish.  My mom ordered the braised short ribs and enjoyed it very much - perfect melt in your mouth tenderness, not fatty, not salty.

We are locals here in town and once a week we like to try out a new restaurant in town and then return there again with friends if its good (so we don't run the risk of taking friends to a bad restaurant).
The greeter at the front was very friendly, but sadly this is where our experience went downhill. Our server was lukewarm at best - but our main issue (and after all the main reason why we went to the restaurant in the first place) was that our food was very 'meh'. My husband had the octopus for starters - it was very tough, and seemed like it had been overcooked. I had the Tuna ceviche - it didn't seem particularly fresh.
For our entrees we both had the halibut. There was nothing particularly wrong with this dish - it just was a bit small for the price we had paid and wasn't outstanding.
By this point in the meal we decided to skip desert as we figured it wouldn't be much better.

Quality of food: the meal was delicious. I have to say that the appetizers were better than the main course. I would definitely order several appetizers over a full entree.... You get to try more and the options were better all around. The empanadas were delicious and so was the Mac and Cheese. 

Cocktails: I had a tamarind drink... It's the only one on the menu with tamarind in the name... It was a small cocktail with too much ice but very tasty. Wish there was more.

The ambience: the restaurant was just ok looking....very brown with little creative accents and decor. The side seems too large...a cozier, smaller venue would make the place more appealing. There's a feeling there's too much unused space.

1942144,2017-06-29,7,gOOfBSBZlffCkQ7dr7cpdw,"Chica is so nice, I visited twice during Restaurant Week alone! The former DB Brasserie space has a fun mix of seating areas, furniture, styles, and textiles for a visually interesting space that also features multiple bar areas and grills where you can watch the food and drinks come together. Latin-inspired menu boasts hot and cold apps, meaty entrees, and a creative cocktail program. A dinner visit with friends allowed for sampling of several dishes and solidified plans to return for a lunch date.

APPS: I know everyone goes ape for guac, but the Mac and Queso is really the must-get option here, with Peruvian corn baked in a parm cream gratin. It's like a ""healthy"" mac and cheese due to the vegetables! After having this, the Grilled Corn Lollipops just didn't stand a chance. The fresh ceviches (options for tuna or halibut) are small but solid, with the empanadas arriving a bit overly charred and lacking moisture. The two apps I'd most been looking forward to, Grilled Octopus and Mushroom Quesadillas, underwhelmed. The former threw me off visually by matching the protein portion with so many shishitos and a surprisingly peppery sauce that overshadowed the tough tentacles, while the quesadillas were so thin as to prompt comments about whether the kitchen had forgotten the mushrooms and bleu cheese. The Chica fries were forgettable. 

MAINS: You gotta getta order of porchetta! Crispy skin, juicy and flavorful meat, sided with yucca, onion, and brussels. This was a great dish, but ask for a serrated knife because cutting through the skin was practically a workout in itself. Another standout is the Lemon Meyer rotisserie chicken (available by the half or whole), an explosion of juiciness and flavor, paired perfectly with an herb chimmi churri. The Shrimp & Quinoa Cazuela was surprisingly good pairing of trendy grain plus lentils, accented with cheese and several plump shrimp. Those favoring meat and potatoes will like the classic flavors of the Asado Negro Braised Short Rib, which unfortunately doesn't photograph well but was extremely tender. The lunch sandwichito Cubano was okay; a safe choice, not a standout

DESSERTS: Both of the dinner options we tried were visually appealing, but the Tres Leches was the favorite with a toasted meringue topper. The Venezuela Marquesa cake was nicely chocolatey with subtle coffee notes but not served with the crema ice cream I'd looked forward to. Lemon Bunelos from the lunch menu are tasty even without the berry and dulce dips, but not something I'd get again. 

 Service was friendly from bar to table and attentive both for visits. Notably, the sommelier took the initiative to come over after noticing Kevin L checking out the drink menu and his suggestions were spot-on for the requested flavor and budget preferences! 

I enjoyed Chica, finding it to be a great improvement over the previous restaurant. My only concern about dining here was the volume: it's noisy with all hard surfaces and much conversation had to be repeated or kept to those immediately adjacent, which is problematic for both group dining or a date night.

The quinoa was overly salty and roasted cauliflower wasn't cooked enough to really complement the  quinoa. .


Margarita was average considering it was a specialty drink. I think it was the one with Tamron and/or chili pepper in it.

I was hesitant to try this place after a disappointing dinner at Yardbird next door and part of the same restaurant group. I'm so glad I decided to celebrate my birthday brunch at Chica, as it was one of my favorite restaurant experiences in Las Vegas. The restaurant's interior design is beautiful. Everything I tried was delicious! (Except for the Huancaína sauce... that recipe needs to be revised right away.)

The sangria manzana was a refreshing take on white sangria. Guacamole made a nice starter with fresh tortilla chips, plantain chips, and assorted flavors of fried arepitas. The Venezuelan-style corn pancakes were a hit with me and my ten month old daughter. I think the mac con queso will be the most memorable dish. It's actually a creamy gratin version of choclo con queso (giant Peruvian corn with fresh cheese, typical street food served all over Peru), with the addition of hearts of palm and spinach, so don't expect macaroni.

I enjoyed a few bites of marquesa de chocolate as a birthday treat, but I was unfortunately too full to order dessert. As a Las Vegas local, I was also set up with a VIP card, and I'm hoping to return to Chica again! I'll try to order something other than corn next time.",PSI7wvuqEhhV9Jh_fP2eZQ,17,12,5,Kep43_UwxJvPL9M3k-kSkQ

The rice is highly recommended as well. My wife and I shared the tres leches cake, which was excellent as well as authentic. While our kids managed to leave satisfied, there is no kids menu, so I would not recommend this place for kids unless you have more adventurous eaters (i.e. willing to stray away from pizza, hot dog, burger, etc.).

Guacamole with chips, plantains, and arepas.

Corn con queso - very good! Especially ordered with the chips

Empanadas - Very good.

Pork Tacos - Good. Tiny!!! Not much to eat

Mushroom quesadillas - good but tiny!!

Arepa with short rib - Very Good!

Crispy Pork Dish - Huge portion. Very good flavor. No sauce of any sort - so very dry

Short Rib - Huge! Great flavor! Best dish

Churro crusted Ice Cream - Meh...pass

2450878,2018-02-15,0,gOOfBSBZlffCkQ7dr7cpdw,"A few weeks ago, I dined at Chica with my best friend and her coworker. We went based on the great reviews on Yelp. The service was good. It was unpretentious and our waitress was very nice. Maybe we ordered the wrong things? We weren't starving and trying to eat a bit more healthy before going out that night so we got guacamole to share (which was good with the different types of chips they served with it) and salads as our main. My best friend and I got the chicken Caesar salad as it's really hard to mess that up and we just wanted something quick. My best friend's coworker got the kale salad with steak. We also got octopus per the server's suggestion. The octopus and guacamole were pretty good. The octopus was a very small portion to share for 3 people. It was perfectly charred and the flavors were good, though a bit salty. The guacamole was fresh and like I mentioned above, the variety of chips was a nice touch. The salads however, were TERRIBLE. My chicken was so dry and so was my best friends' chicken. Her coworkers' steak was so tough and the salad itself was disgusting (I hate to use this word but it was really not good at all). Maybe we shouldn't have gotten salads, but honestly, it's hard to mess up a salad but they somehow found a way to. They noticed we didn't finish the salads and asked if they wanted us to ""remake it"" but why would we want you to remake something that is clearly not good, 30 minutes into us receiving the food? They didn't offer any discounts on our food and drinks (we did order cocktails as well). We weren't looking for a discount anyways, but the offer to re-do our food was nice but too late. It was pricey for what it was, and i'm one to spend on food and not look at the price too much as long as it tastes delicious. Definitely won't be back as Vegas has plenty of great options and is a culinary paradise.

After making a reservation for my mom's birthday since we were having a family reunion (we all live out of state in different locations), we were so excited to narrow it down to Chica at the Venetian. The ambiance and food were what drove us to choose this place. I went to the restaurant website, made a reservation, and got confirmation for tonight's dinner.

Upon arrival, we noticed there was a convention going on, but no actual restaurant employee in front of the house- just the conference leaders shuffling people in. When I tried to enter to find someone, the conference worker directed me outside to the left..to nowhere. Perplexed, I called and spoke with Kayla and James. They let me know that according to their records, they had called twice to try to update me of the unavailability of tonight for regular dining. I never got any missed calls. When I asked why they did not leave a voicemail or email me, they said according to their records, they could not leave a voicemail and did not have my email. There was really nothing they could do since the restaurant was closed to the public. Why have your restaurant linked to an online reservation system where you confirm via email when they can't communicate there with you directly..?

Kayla and James were empathetic and professional- I do not blame the actual staff working at the location. I do, however, feel that it's my responsibility to warn others of corporate irresponsibility in making sure they have a direct and convenient way of communicating with their customers.. especially when cancelling reservations.",Y2_UMqeNw9CkpgP9TTP-eg,0,0,1,dJoKe70nASi-BXQQiwJ7nQ

We came here after a particularly rough day in Vegas and were absolutely blown away by the hospitality. They gave us both a free glass of champagne, so nice! I forget our servers name but she was an absolute gem. 

I started with a cocktail- a tamarind guava colada. Delicious spin on a pina colada with a tanginess from the tamarind. Really refreshing! From there we split a few appetizers:

Guacamole- pretty standard as far as guac goes but what stood out was the dippers. They had  tortilla chips obviously, but also fried plantain chips and mini arepas. I loved this, no one ever gets fancy on the chips so I appreciated not only the variety but also the creativity. The plantain chips were a bit greasy but the mini arepas were awesome with the guac! 

Empanadas- These were my least favorite, the inside was just a bit bland. It could have benefited from better seasoning, some cheese pull or perhaps a sauce on the side just to pump up the flavor. 

Pulled pork tacos- These were my boyfriends favorite. Three mini tacos on homemade corn tortillas with melt in your mouth tender pork. The slaw, salsa, and peppers all combined for a yummy little taco. 

Asado Negro Arepas- YES. These were my favorite. I just love the mini arepas they make here. They're so soft and the perfect canvas for the incredible braised short ribs sitting on top. The meat was cooked so well, so tender and juicy. There's also a great anise flavor that comes through which I really enjoyed. 10/10 don't pass on this app! 

We ended our meal with the churro fried ice cream pops. SO GOOD. What an original dessert, an unexpected riff on churros. The pop was made with a delicious caramel ice cream coated in cinnamon sugar. You held the pop up with a mini churro stick in it- I wasn't sure these would be able to be held without breaking but the churros worked perfectly! It came with a vanilla bean anglaise and a really good whipped cream, more like a cool whip it was so luscious. Definitely recommend this dessert!",bxm90XH7RT4QhSZeiM1kaw,1,0,4,pib6BooaB5H0fhYU1Oi4Zg

On my recent vacation to Vegas we went to various restaurants.  Chica over delivered.  From the knowledgeable and courteous wait staff to the most amazing Latin food I have eaten.  This restaurant is clearly a fusion of many Latin and Caribbean cultures. I have had the opportunity to have many different types of Latin foods in my life due to places I have lived and Chica was able to bring the best of all the cultures together.
I went for brunch and had the Latin Breakfast. Two eggs scrambled, with the house made chorizo sausage, with assorted arepas.  My mother had the chicken sausage and both were amazing.  It had been so long since I had arepas and it brought me back home. When I tell you the eggs were season to perfection and something as simple as the coffee was the best cup of coffee I have ever had.  I could have drunk it black with no sugar.  The waitress was so knowledgeable about the menu and where the food is sourced. She also got the kitchen to prepare us a small sample plate of two of the lemon doughnuts.  We really wanted to try them but were full after our meal.  I understand now why the lemon doughnuts are award winning.

They are a little greasy but still very good. We would love to see ones stuffed with meat in the future. We ate them so fast and they were so filling that we didn't eat much of our main dishes. I had the huevos rancheros and my partner had the steak tacos. Both meals tasted very good but not as great as the arepas.

This restaurant is recently opened at the Venetian. We saw their ad on the Palazzo Chanel and were fan of chef Lorena Garcia. We came for dinner on NYD. We were not disappointed!
 
For small plates or appetizers, we had Asada Negro Arepas, grilled octopus, and shrimp butter lettuce salad.
For main dish, we had Brazillian beef tenderloin with wild mushroom and HopinJose rice.
For desert, we had churro ice cream pops.
For drinks, we had tamarind guava colada and midnight in Puerto Rico. 

- Asada negro Arepas $13: corn biscuits with ribs. It was a perfect bite. 
- grilled octopus $18: octopus was very tender, slightly charred, spicy and perfectly seasoned. My favorite! You would not know it was octopus because the meat was so tender and well-treated.
- Shrimp butter lettuce salad $18: it looks like a painting! Everything is perfectly seasoned with pomegrade seeds, cheese cubes, and a hint of spicy with chipotle vinaigrette
-  Brazillian steak $52: the steak is served with grits... but it kinda works! The steak is so juicy and tender! I would definitely order it again.
- side dishes, mushroom $12 and Hopin Jose Rice $12 are good addition with the steak but can be missed. (We heard Mac con queso is very good but they ran out by 6 PM.)
- churro fried ice cream pops $12: it is worth every calorie and waist fat (sorry Dr. Oz... I would not give up this!) The caramel ice cream is coated in churro and cinnamon dust, so tasty, buttery and creamy ice cream!
Their drinks are pretty good but expensive! 

Overall, we enjoyed our first dinner of 2018 and were not disappointed! It is pretty expensive though but is expected in this area! Dinner for 2 is about $200 without tip.",RGv368-5kXxxEraspYk6zQ,1,1,4,rm23lKGxQKEWfz2dOYL13Q

My kids got a burger to share, they certainly don't have the most refined palate, however, one of the reasons they pushed back on the burger is because it came with cheese, although we requested it with no cheese. It's not the end of the world so we didn't even mention it to the waiter and the kids eventually ate most of it in a very inelegant way.
My wife got street corn, probably the most beautifully presented corn I've ever seen, the taste was great but it's worth ordering it just to admire the braid they do with the leaves.

The atmosphere is a little dark but lively with bright pillows and interesting wall paper on some walls. My photos don't do justice here.

They sat us by the Rotisserie and the aroma was intoxicating from the Marinated Meyer Lemon Chickens spinning around so I had to order that for dinner.

We started with the Wild Mushroom Quesadilla. It differed from quesadillas you get at most places. It was more elevated. Besides mushrooms it contained Huitlacoche, Oaxacan Cheese, Jalapeño Pesto and Pickled Onion. They served it in a tower that was held together with Guacamole. It was the most interesting detailed quesadilla I ever had.

I had the 1/2 Marinated Meyer Lemon Rotisserie Chicken. The Chicken was the moistest Rotisserie Chicken I ever had. Even the breast almost fell apart. The chicken was very flavorful and was delicious! Off to the side was Purple Peruvian Potato Salad with Palm. It was very spicy with Jalapeño but also was creamy to cut the heat. It also was herbaceous with Cilantro.

My husband enjoyed the Porchetta with crisp Yucca Hash with Brussels Sprouts with Pearl Onions and Escabeche.

They did send samples of some of the other foods they offer our way. (and man they were awesome) I was told it was because I mentioned that I was a fan of Chef Lorena Garcia. I did notice other tables didn't get the samples we got.

Went here for Restaurant Week to try it and see if we wanted to go again.  I would emphatically assert that we are definitely going back again.  The craft cocktails were excellent as was the food.  

We tried the Mac Con Queso and Tuna Ceviche for appetizers.  The insertion of corn that looks like hominy was an interesting touch.  I would have preferred pasta instead of the corn in the Mac Con Queso, but it was interesting and tasty.  The Tuna Ceviche was great, although the corn in this dish was just weird.  

For sides, we ordered the corn and cauliflower.  These were both great and I would order them again.

For the entrees, we had the Braised Short Rib and the Porchetta with Crispy Yucca Hash.  The Short Rib was excellent.  It was moist throughout the entire protein and had a nice flavor that was similar to a mole sauce.  The Porchetta was very gamey, but not entirely unexpected.  It had a flavor of free range meat, so if you're not into this type of flavor, you might find it unappealing.  That said, the Yucca Hash was dynamite!  I would just eat that on its own if it was offered as a appetizer.  The fried brussel spouts were excellent.  The only downside is that there weren't more of them.  

Finally, the desserts were awesome.  The tres leches was one of the best I've ever tasted (although I hated the meringue that tasted more like marshmallows).  The Marquesa de Chocolate was very heavy and rich.  

Finally, the service was great.  I enjoyed speaking to Francesca.  As we are local, I was happy to tell her about my other favorite restaurants and the places I've tried, and to hear about the places she worked at and what she was going to try.

Our server, Alyssa, was so sweet and helpful, and even gave us some recommendations for clubs to hit up that night. The food was tasty, and it worked well for our gluten free member of the group too.

3086159,2017-07-27,1,gOOfBSBZlffCkQ7dr7cpdw,"This place is SOO BOMB.

My boyfriend and I stayed at the Venetian, hoping to grab a quick dinner and my boyfriend suggested this place for a first try.

I was at first a little hesitant because of the little reviews it had so far, but it's also because it was new.

Service: 
They are so nice, if Beatriz is working, ask for her!! We sat at the ceviche bar, and I asked Beatriz for cerviche makers name and she told me it was nubi? I'm not sure if I'm spelling it right.

Beatriz: super nice great vibe and definitely knows what she's doing and knows what is good

Nubi: he brings the vibe of the restaurant. He's constantly smiling always happy. He takes all his dishes very seriously and makes his presentation look great. He also gave us a dessert salad on the house which was phenomenal 

Chef: he walks around making sure everyone is enjoying their meals and making sure all the food is ok with everyone. He also has no problem with explaining what he does and what goes into the food. Definitely ask him if you have questions, he explains with passion as if you was next to him while he is making the dish in the kitchen.

What we had:

Octopus: perfectly cooked, very moist, perfectly seasoned

Rice: I don't remember the name but OMG IT IS SO BOMB. They give you the crispiness sides of the rice and that is my favorite when eating rice.

Guacamole: this is a big appetizer so I suggest you ordering this if you have 3 or more people, but the guac is perfectly textered. It tastes lovely with the banana chips that they freshly make, and I love the mesa doughs that he puts in with this appetizer. I tried the cheese one and the beet one with the Giap, even without the guac the mesa doughs are perfect.

Corn: the corn was ok, but I could have lived without this.

Classic ceviche: this was ok, the texture was good, but there wasn't enough flavor in this dish. 

Beef tenderloin: this is a definite, you need to get this, there was a perfect amount of flavor and the texture was perfect ( I like my steak medium rare).

The rotisserie chicken: perfectly seasoned, I usually like dark meat so I didn't really like it all around since the breast was a tad dry but that was only my taste in preference. 

The reason why I give a 5/5 is because the food pairing with the drinks and service that we got all around just made it perfect. Thank you for making this dinner so great.

I came on Saturday, July 22,2017 at 8/815 pm for dinner time.",J8zbXGDUdMhhvBQ8yZIJ5w,6,1,5,dnz81ApA5BrcLO4f52oetw

We had the steak salad and the rotisserie chicken for main courses, but started with the ceviche and grilled octopus.
The grilled octopus was by far the best thing. That octopus was super tender and flavorful. It had a good spice and the chilis underneath were a little spicy, but not too much.
The ceviche was pretty good, I'd get it again but not the best I've ever had. Still had a good acidity, just lacked something I couldn't put my finger on. Overall a good dish and I can still recommend it.
On to the chicken... Really tender and had a really good sauce. I didn't like the potato salad-like thing that was with it, but if I had a bowl or rice.. forget it. But that might be the asian guy in me talking.
The steak salad was also pretty balanced. The steak was seasoned well and the salad dressing went well with the greens.

We started off with some cocktails - the Tamarind Guava Colada and a Bloody Mary. I absolutely loved the colada, a spin-off of a classic piña colada with guava nectar. My boyfriend's Bloody Mary was great too, spicier than normal which he enjoyed.

Reviews on Yelp all said to get the Grilled Corn Lollipops, which is what we did. I thought they'd be actually in the shape of lollipops - like corn fritters on a stick or something - but they were just grilled corn on the cob slathered with queso freso and spices. It was really good, but I guess I expected more for a $13 appetizer. Also, I've had something similar at a much cheaper place in NYC (Cafe Habana near SoHo) so this didn't particularly impress me.

We also got the Strip Steak and Steak & Kale Lime Chopped Salad. My boyfriend wasn't too impressed with the steak - he thought he got a bad cut because it was a little too fatty and not tender enough. I enjoyed the skirt steak on my salad though.

Overall, a good place to try if you pass by, but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here again.",kC_k1womuARp3gs4u_lrOw,0,0,4,CndTGCcQhd1xP9Q1kCunGQ

I ordered the Espresso Filled Churros and the Pancetta Eggs Benedict. The Espresso Filled Churros was especially disappointing. I was expecting really fresh, warm, Latin style churros but instead got really stale and hard churros that was just really nice to look at. It took a couple of bites for me to realize that there was an espresso filling, which was very difficult for me to distinguish as ""espresso cream"". It was very dry. I was so disappointed that I asked our waiter if it was supposed to be stale and he took it off the bill for us, which was very professional of him.

Made a reservation for a party of 6 Saturday night. Was greet and sat down Immediately and our waitress was monica. This was a first time at a fancy restaurant in Vegas and not some greasy quick fried food after the club! 
I had been looking at the menu the day before so I had an idea what I wanted to eat. 
Monica knew we were celebrating a birthday so she brought out some ""celebration cava"" Which is a special shot that the bartenders make. It had tequila and pineapple and some other ingredients that we were not supposed to know. Top secret. 

I love having family style dinners. So we ordered corn, Mac n cheese, two orders of the chicken , fish of the day (sword fish), Peruvian ceviche , and the pork. 
The corn had so much flavor. Evenly grilled to perfection. The cheese wasn't too overwhelming. 
Chicken fell right off. Super soft and not too salty. The chimichurri sauce was so addicting.   
The purple yam that came with the chicken was very refreshing. 
Mac n cheese was made with Peruvian corn. I totally didn't see that when I ordered it. Even though it was good, I do wish it was pasta. 
Sword fish was my favorite of all the dishes. The onions were well seasoned. 
Peruvian ceviche was refreshing as well and has lots of flavors. The chips just crunched so nicely. 
Pork is not my first choice of meat. The fat layer out side was roasted so well that it was crispy. The meat itself was soft and well marinated. The potatoes were indescribable. 
We also got a few watermelon margaritas. Fresh watermelon juice. Delicious. This is a must try!
Everything was so good we didn't even make it to dessert!!!!

Monica was so delightful. She had us laughing all night and was very pleasant to talk to! She is very educated in the food world ! She mentioned that they had just gotten a new Venezuelan cook and the menu will be changing slightly soon to showcase her passion for food. I love that she acknowledges other well known chefs in the area and made great recommendations!!! I wish I ran into her earlier on in my trip so I could eat more good food!!! Yard bird is my next stop next time I come to Vegas!!!! Also need to come back for brunch at chica! You seriously cannot go wrong with anything here !!!!!

3333572,2018-06-23,0,gOOfBSBZlffCkQ7dr7cpdw,"My meal at Chica was all but perfect...until we got the check.  We came during Restaurant Week and added on an additional appetizer to truly taste everything Chica had to offer.  For our meals we had the empanadas and tacos to start, chicken and cuban sandwich for entree, and the donuts.  We also added an order of corn lollipops.

To begin, the empanada was very good.  The shell was cooked perfectly and the ground meat was heavy, but flavorful.  The tacos were one of the better upscale tacos I've had in the area.  Corn tortilla was starchy and hot and the insides were overflowing with pork and veggies.  The corn lollipopps were different than I'm used to.  These were more of a cheesy, lime flavor, while most I've had have steered towards heavy chili flakes.  But overall very tasty and a neat presentation with the corn husk, perfect for eating the ""lollipop.""

As far as entrees, both were huge and easily could have filled up anybody, without the additional appetizers we chose to order.  The chicken was a basic rotisserie, but had some fresh chimichurri and purple potato salad to make it a meal.  I wouldn't necessarily order this dish myself, but it's nice for a basic, chicken lover.  The cuban came full of meat and had a harsh horseradish sauce that was perfect for the meal.  Bread was buttered and toasted perfectly to make a great dish.  Fries were good with a nice spicy seasoning, but nothing too overpowering.  The final desert course, the donuts, were phenomenal and a must order.  The donuts themselves are warm and topped with powdered sugar, but every sauce on the plate was worth a dip as well.

The downside of my meal came when I went to pay.  The waitress would not accept my ""free appetizer with purchase"" coupon that I received from the Grazie desk.  The only reason I ordered the extra appetizer was because of the coupon.  The waitress seemed well overwhelmed so called over the manager to discuss.  The manager eventually came out, angrily explaining the reason was because the Restaurant Week menu was a ""special"" and would not qualify as a purchase.  Instead of simply comping us for the misunderstanding, she all but yelled at us and would not take the appetizer off our check.  After explaining the situation for about 5 minutes, she finally caved, condescendingly saying ""sir"" about 30 times during our encounter and reiterating that Chica is owned separate from the Venetian/Palazzo and reserves the right to not accept coupons if they feel like it.  

I understand the policy, but what is the cost of an appetizer?  I wasn't trying to steal - it was a misunderstanding.  Management should always be on the customer's side, and her attitude was unacceptable, even up to the point where she reluctantly comped $10 worth of food.  She brought our experience from a great 5 to a ""we might not come back here,"" regardless of the quality of the food.

The food was great and the service was pretty solid.  Meal does take awhile, however, as our lunch was well over an hour.  My only complaint was the Manager.  But can't fault the chef for front of house rudeness.",JaqcCU3nxReTW2cBLHounA,0,0,3,5Ad3ZyDLiifqRGtt4gDyVg

This restaurant serves Latin American fare that leaves me wanting more. Chica's three-course Restaurant Week menu is a value at $20 for lunch. 

First Course: Kale Salad - There's two ways to eat kale (1) in a smoothie and (2) the Chica way. The description of the kale salad is unimpressive, to tell you the truth. It seems like a regular 'ol kale salad with pumpkin seeds, dried cranberries, croutons, sour green apples, and Napa  What makes this dynamite is the salad's lime vinaigrette mixed in with all its ingredients. The portion is generous.

Second Course: Shrimp & Quinoa: I was just thinking if shrimp goes well with cheese. In this case with the shrimp and quinoa dish, yes, yes it does go well. The four or five shrimp and the corn poblano pico ""crown"" the quinoa and the cubes of Guayanés cheese. The entire dish is flavorful with an occasional spicy kick in every other bite. 

Third Course: Lemon Buñelos: Two donuts with soft centers. These was crispy, citrusy, and delightful. If you need to satisfy a sweet tooth, I would pass on this. It's too bad that there's only one dessert option on the Restaurant Week menu; I would liked to have seen another option.

Overall: The food is solid, and the cuisine is worth the try if you're searching for something to eat in the area that isn't the traditional Italian and steakhouse offerings.",epkRB3J_oBEiyiwahvdmGg,1,4,4,PSBJjrEdt3vlXSPiQS31BA

The restaurant was open about 3 months ago and I have read good things about it.

The decor is cool and had a great atmosphere.  The Latin music transported me back to my PVR vacation. 

Our friend dig the chairs, they were very comfortable.

We ordered-

Grilled Peruvian Octopus
Crispy Calamari Fuego
Empanadas
Classic Cerviche
Steak and Egg Tacos×2

The portions are small but the balance of textures and rich flavors of the cuisine was very impressive. Every component of the dish from the fresh Cerviche to Grilled Peruvian Octopus was delicious and satisfying without being too salty or oily.

I also tried the Cornncake Flan for dessert, which was a tasty and a unique treat.

I had Passion Fruit Mimosa which was delicious and I could tell it was real. My bf had the Sangria Zarzamora and this drink is thoughtful, creative, well-balanced and supremely satisfying. 

Service was on par. They always made sure the glass of water is full.

We started with the classic ceviche and the pulled pork tacos- both of which were exceptional! The ceviche was light and refreshing and was the perfect shareable portion for the two of us. The pork tacos came in a set of 3 and were topped with salsa and a house made slaw which was delicious! 

As an entree, we shared the braised short rib and oh my g was it mouthwateringly amazing! Served with epazote oil and pickled onions, the beef just perfectly tender and could almost melt in your mouth. It had the most perfect savory flavor and the pickled onions were a great touch. My only complaint would be that it had a lot of fat- especially for being such a small portion.

As for cocktails, I ordered the Sangria Zarzamora and my boyfriend had the Pepino Sandia. I'd say my sangria tasted a bit watered down and didn't have the best flavor. The Pepino Sandio was their take on a gin tonic and was pretty strong but the taste of cucumber still gave it a light refreshing taste.

I settled on the braised short rib with black eyed peas (two ways) and a side of Peruvian mac n cheese (which is actually corn).  Wow. Amazing, amazing, amazing!!  The short rib was moist and tender enough to peel away with a fork.  The caramelization of the sugars as it was braised was flavorful and sealed in the moisture. The pairing with the peas and corn was dead on the spot!  After finishing our meal, we complimented the waiter on the food who then brought out the chef to accept our compliments!

So i was STARVING when i got to this place.  We got the guac appetizer and we specifically asked the waitress if it was going to be enough guac for us 3 girls, she said yes plenty of guac. When we got it, it was so tiny and definitely not enough guac. It was also $15. There was probably half of an avocado of guac in the bowl. Crazy ridiculously expensive and it wasnt even good!!! It didnt taste fresh. It was DEFINITELY pre-made! 

Then i asked the older blonde waitress lady if i should get the shrimp salad or the shrimp tacos, and told her that i was starving. She said the shrimp tacos are more hearty and filling. So i got them. (i dont eat meat or chicken so the shrimp dishes were my only option on the lunch menu)

there were 2 tacos and they were SOOOOOO FREAKING TINY!!!!! Holy shit 
i thought she was joking when she brought it out. It didnt even have any sides that came with it. The diameter of the opened taco was 3 inches. With 3 little tiny baby shrimps in it. Thats it. I asked them to put the slaw on the side that came on the tacos and the habanero sauce on the side, this came with no sides. I finished eating within 90 seconds of receiving my meal. I left starving and hungrier than when i got there!!!! The tacos were $20 btw. So expensive for NOTHING!!!! 

The restaurant was empty the entire time we were there. So overpriced and ridiculously small portions, i would never go back even if they paid me or fed me for free. Ill never forget how disappointed i was",9VYLF4cWoicSaX8VnK3nmw,0,0,1,XSZl_HnSc104mn9a3jbpFw

Empanadas, Ceviche, Red Shrimp Cazuela,  Asado Negro Shortrib, Tres Leches, and Marquesa Chocolate.

Ceviche was good, but skimpy...Empanadas were okay(cheaper, more delicious ones can be found at Pollo Campero and Makers and Finders) The shrimp was borderline rubbery and quinoa was salty, the star of our table was the Shortrib, the desserts were pretty tiny, the crema ice cream did not show up on the Marquesa Chocolate plate as advertised, and to top it all off, we pretty much got rushed to leave because they seemed to be more concerned about turning tables.

The company was most definitely 5 stars, but the misses outweighed the hits. The price point definitely doesn't match the quality of food, but that's almost always the case when you have a celebrity chef attached to the restaurant, and  it's on the strip. ALOHA!!!

3661927,2018-01-31,8,gOOfBSBZlffCkQ7dr7cpdw,"Hola, Chica! ¿Qué tal?

John Kunkel's 50 Eggs, Inc. has done it again at the Venetian Resort Las Vegas!  Last May, when we dined at Yardbird Southern Table & Bar, we fortuitously met up with one of 50 Eggs, Inc. General Managers (Randy) who showed us Chica's space as it was soon to open (late May 2017).  The restaurant space looked inviting and warm.  I was excited by Randy's description of Chica's Latin culinary focus who would be helmed by celebrated Latin Chef Lorena Garcia.  

I recently planned a weeklong birthday celebration for my husband at Las Vegas, NV and chose Chica to be the first restaurant on our culinary slate.  We wanted to try their lunch menu first before being joined by good friends to do their dinner.  Both times, we made reservations as there were several conventions in town and we knew by Chica's Yelp rating that this restaurant was certainly popular.

Our lunch server, José M, was simply awesome!  This guy exuded professionalism, warmth, humor and attentiveness.  Being that this was our first dine at Chica, we had several questions about the menu.   José's menu descriptions enlightened us about what is Latin cuisine as  many people only associate Latin cuisine with Mexican cuisine.  Latin America refers to territories and countries in the Americas where Spanish or Portuguese languages prevail such as Mexico, most of Central and South America, and in the Caribbean, Cuba, Dominican Republic, and Puerto Rico.  His descriptions of the menu items were so mouthwatering that I wished for our friends to hurry and join us for dinner so we could try more items.  

FOOD:

-Grilled Peruvian Octopus:  grilled octopus served with aji amarillo sauce, blistered Shishito peppers, crispy quinoa, spicy guasacaca pico.  As we walked into The Venetian Resort, we noticed a huge poster of this appetizer.  How could we resist from ordering such a ""Vision of Beauty""?  The octopus tentacles were grilled and seasoned to perfection.  It's tender bite was nicely complemented with the spicy and pleasing blistered shishito peppers and spicy aji amarillo sauce.

-Empanadas:  3 house made pastry dough half-moons were generously filled with braised ground beef, sweet plantains and black beans.  They were finshed with queso fresco and spicy guasacaca pico.  The pastry was light and flaky, unlike other empanada pastry which often tends to be mealy or crumbly.  These empanadas were good sized at least 3.5""-4"".  Very tasty and filling.

-Hoppin' José Rice:   Our server described this side dish as fried Jasmine rice mixed with black eyed peas or beans and topped with avocado guacamole and cilantro.  He had us at fried rice!  Of course, we ordered this side to pair with our entrée.

-Meyer Lemon Rotisserie Chicken:  slow rotisserie roasted Meyer lemon marinated chicken lightly slathered with chimichurri served with Peruvian purple potato salad.  We ordered a 1/2 chicken which was plump and cut into 4 manageable and generous sized  pieces. The chicken had nice crisped skin, juicy and flavorful meat.  The chimichurri complemented and added a fresh dimension.  Also served with this entrée was Peruvian purple potato salad...this cold potato salad was tasty without being overly sauced. It was pretty to look at and by the way, the Peruvian purple potato is not a sweet one like the Okinawan variety.

DESSERT:

-Churro Pops:  3 caramel ice cream (dulce de leche) pops coated in fried cinnamon churro crumbs were served with 3 quenelles of vanilla bean Anglaise.  OMG!  These pops and quenelles were absolutely delicious, silky and ""sinfully"" delicious.  If I didn't have lactose intolerance, I could've eaten the entire dessert myself BUT I did show restraint!  

José and the rest of Chica's staff certainly made our lunch very memorable and we DID return for dinner a few days later.",HH7iiWvBqV-20lA7JlSRWQ,15,12,5,K-QiWv3-0jys0ugvrgUMIQ

3754282,2018-02-03,12,gOOfBSBZlffCkQ7dr7cpdw,"Chica. (4 stars).

""Chica: girl."" - Google

Truth is, I had no burning desire or expectations of trying any more Peruvian food after I recently had another dismal meal at Limon Rotisserie in Hawaii.

My friend had asked us if we wanted to try Chica & after hearing ""they have lamb"", I immediately said YES!

My friend then made a reservation for dinner after she & her other half tried Chica for lunch.

Since we had a lot of different items, I'll review one I would pass on & 2 of my favorites:

Pepita Crusted Lamb - $45. (3.5 stars).

""Colorado lamb, herb pumpkin seed crust, mole verde, crispy squash blossoms, & grilled calabaza.""

Having no idea what half of this stuff was, I just blindly agreed to try this dish.

After all, this is the dish that brought my friend & her hubby back for another meal!!

I absolutely adore lamb, but the BF is indifferent to it, so when I find people who are willing to try new dishes with me, I'm ALL IN!!

The lamb itself was prepared beautifully.

Medium-Rare please!

Perhaps I'm just not used to Pepita (pumpkin seeds) being used as a crust or the mole verde which is made primarily from pumpkin seeds & green chiles.

The mole verde wasn't bad, it was creamy, but didn't have much a flavor profile I could discern. Aside from adding moisture to the lamb, I felt the mole got lost.

I think I watch too much Food Network. When I saw fried squash blossoms I was thinking of the bright orange-red flower that gets fried in tempura batter. I didn't see that anywhere on our plate??

I didn't even try the grilled calabaza (West Indian pumpkin) because I didn't know where it was on the plate??

This dish really celebrated the PUMPKIN in my humble opinion. NOT THE LAMB. If I had known what all these fancy items were before I tried the lamb, I quite possibly could have been prepared myself for a less dramatic crescendo.

I was secretly hoping for chimichurri sauce... *Sad Face*

Definitely a lesson learned for me, if I don't know the ingredients, GOOGLE before trying.

Nothing against my friends or Chica, I just enjoy big bold flavors & chimichurri sauce!!

Porchetta with Crispy Yuca Hash - $36. (4.5 stars).

""Suckling roast pig, crispy brussel sprouts, fried yuca, pearl onions escabeche, & pork jus.""

I honestly thought this was going to be my favorite dish of the evening... but there's actually a tie?!

I love pork so much I swear I OINK every time I speak!!

I watched the spit rotate for a while with these giant porchetta roasting over an open flame. What a glorious moment it was!!

The porchetta was roasted perfectly & was served piping hot & crispy!!

Cutting into the porchetta was so satisfying. The meat was so tender on the inside & crispy on the outside.

That crispy pork skin was excellent!!

The brussel sprouts absorbed all of the rich pork jus & which added a nice flavor to my favorite vegetable! It was almost as good as having brussel sprouts with bacon!!

I can still imagine licking the fatty porky juices off of my lips... Mmmm. Good!

Meyer Lemon Rotisserie Chicken - $26 (Half Order: 4 pcs). (4 stars).

""Famous Rotisserie Chicken, marinated in Meyer Lemon & slow roasted to perfection, with Peruvian purple potato salad, & chimichurri.""

Now on to the biggest surprise of the evening.

For those who know me, I really enjoy CRISPY fried chicken.

Having just tried Yardbird (next door, same owners) & being quite disappointed in my non-crispy chicken, I wasn't really expecting to enjoy a roasted bird.

Boy was I mistaken!!

This chicken was roasted on an open flame!

The skin wasn't terribly CRISPY so I had a little bit of a challenge eating the chicken on its own. I guess it's the same texture that makes me remove the skin from my cold ginger chicken... I'm not a huge fan of flaccid skin.

The Meyer Lemon flavor is evident & gives a brightness to this dish.

The CHIMICHURRI SAUCE at Chica was phenomenal!! This sauce could be put on a fast food burger & I would eat it!! 

Note: I LOATHE FAST FOOD SO THAT IS SAYING A LOT!!

What makes the chimichurri sauce my star of the evening is the robust & intense garlic, olive oil, & parsley flavors. I thought I noted some cilantro in this sauce but I could be wrong.

OMG, some of my favorite items in the world... all in one bright green sauce.

After slathering a dollop of chimichurri onto my plate, I silently cursed myself for telling my friend to order ""just a half"".

---

While our server was extremely personable & friendly, I have to say the wait staff was a different story.

We had a few plates that were sitting for a while with a brussel sprouts here, a yuca hash there. Without even asking us, the busboy just swept up our dishes & took it to the kitchen.

I thought it was a bit weird since I was going to eat that brussel sprout!!!!

None of the busboys asked us anything before clearing the rest of our table.

That's fine, I'll just have to remember to shoo them away the next time!!

I'll be back Chica!!",Z67zFhSzaTDiIMKtVcuFFw,20,14,4,-bX6PC7LziRYECS1fEx3wg

What I ate:
- Chicken chicharrones: These were super tasty, very flavorful with an amazing sauce, but these were way larger than I thought they would be. My date and I could hardly finish this. Also this is not really date friendly as it's meat on the bone. I just went for it and used my hands while eating this
- Pulled pork tacos: These tacos were amazing - flavorful, well balanced, perfectly cooked pork. There were three tacos. Good to share or just have as your main
- Chicken watercress caesar salad: After having so many rich meals on strip, I think my body was craving salad. This salad was okay. The chicken that came out with it was really dry and overly charred, so we ended up leaving the chicken on the side and not eating it at all
- Mushroom quesadillas: This dish was not great. I actually had to complain. The quesadillas were really charred, almost burnt. It made the blue cheese super strong in flavor. All you could taste was burnt flavors and blue cheese. There was nothing to cut those flavors, so it was not palatable. 
- Happy pill cocktail was refreshing and easy to drink

- Really beautiful restaurant. The inside was wonderfully done. 
- Plenty of large and small tables
- Bar had a HUGE screen TV that was playing the basketball playoffs - mainly what drew us to eat there in the first place
- Service was friendly. When I complained about the mushroom quesadillas the server didn't make it a big deal, told me it was easy to take off our bill, and then the house manager came by to apologize
- A few private closed off rooms you could reserve. It was nice to see some rooms of different sizes that could accommodate different sized parties from small parties to really big
- I liked that they had a bathroom inside the restaurant. I hate when I'm at a hotel restaurant and have to exit the restaurant just to use the bathroom. 

Cons:
- Since we didn't have a reservation, we couldn't grab a table. This seemed super confusing to me since there were so many open tables when I went to the bathroom. Maybe they were understaffed that night in terms of servers and left part of the dining room closed? Not sure since I saw plenty of server just milling around chatting amongst themselves. Or is this part of the restaurant's allure, to try to make it SEEM exclusive? No biggie since ultimately my date wanted to be able to see the TV and watch the game
- Food was really hit or miss. I liked the pork tacos, but I really wouldn't write home about anything else I ate that night

Would I come again? Probably not",JwF4WNVp2mY_HMeroVUOEw,4,2,3,MLEZIo2Xln9eYxWo9vgIMw

Their special fish was supposed to be Halibut but they were all out. Instead they were serving swordfish.  I thought I would take a stab and ordered it though I usually don't because this is a difficult fish to cook and easily overcooked.  They had done an excellent job with the octopus and the sword fish was superb. It was delicate, moist and delicious.  The seasoning was well balanced and the portion was adequate.

3801263,2017-07-02,0,gOOfBSBZlffCkQ7dr7cpdw,"Food looked amazing, server was excellent, great decor/ ambiance, and everything came out in a timely manner... You're probably wondering then why the 2 star review? Well the food ""looked amazing"" but taste or lack there of just didn't live up to the hype. They had a restaurant week 20 dollar tasting menu of an app, entree, and dessert. Pretty good deal so we both got that and got different items so we could share/try more items as it was our first time here. We got the chica fries 3.75 stars, classic ceviche 1.5 stars, shrimp w/quinoa 1.5 stars, rotisserie chicken 2.5, and lemon bunuelos 4.25 stars. Fries were pretty good , Ceviche was completely bland, it was like eating a soupy milk without any flavor at all. The shrimp was completely over seasoned, so much so that when my gf asked what I thought of the shrimp I said its ok and her immediate response was, ""you don't think its way too salty?."" It was over powering and my gf likes salty stuff so for her to say that its too salty means its way over seasoned. The chicken was over cooked and dry. The skin was really good along with the wing and thigh piece but the breast was really dry and we didn't even finish it. I feel like if it was pulled a few minutes earlier it was close to being really really good. Im not a big dessert person but the highlight of the meal was the bunuelos. They weren't anything fancy just little lemony donut balls with black berry sauce but they were made perfectly and delicious.

Overall I would give 2.25 stars on Chica. 

Ive been to Canonita (just upstairs also in the Venetian) a few times and would have to say its much better when you're craving latin/spanish food inside Venetian/palazzo.Its unfortunate because my gf who's Venezuelan has been excited to go to chica because of the chef Lorena Garcia and the really good yelp reviews so far but it just didn't live up to the hype at all.",Hi_XwDznAXUiPzU_r3FHug,0,0,2,JN03Y2teLtu4ybJREhIdGw
3823733,2017-10-08,0,gOOfBSBZlffCkQ7dr7cpdw,"Went to Chica on a whim one night.  As far as whims go, I couldn't have asked for anything better.

Started with the Arepas:  a basket of 10 bite-sized arepas, served with nata butter.  They're broken down into 5 flavors, each flavor being represented twice:  plain, pistachio, beet, cheese, and black bean.  While all of them were good, the best were the pistachio and the cheese.

The Red Flint Grits followed.  I honestly wasn't too excited to try it, thinking it would taste like any old bowl of grits I'd had before.  One taste of this dish changed my mind.  Ultra creamy, sweet, and flooded with Parmesan cheese.  These were truly incredible.  If I had to recommend one dish from my entire meal, it would be these grits.  They're only $8, just get the grits and rationalize it by pretending you lost a single hand of blackjack.

My main course was the Porchetta with Crispy Yuca Hash.  Tender, salty, savory meat under a pile of yuca and brussels sprouts.  The brussels sprouts were dark and crispy as they should be.  The yuca provided a heavier, salty starch... crunchy and delicious.  Similar to potatoes but lighter.

Chica pays attention to the small details of their dishes. For example, they could have kept it simple, and served my arepas with a regular, salted butter.  But they pay attention to the details, and upgrade you to a nata butter.  All of these sorts of small details add up to a huge impact that bumps a restaurant up from 4-stars to 5-stars.",fZmhzLVEpQZxmRE-RkEFxw,3,1,5,OVnMC2sSfYOtUP3ztoW9QQ

Stopped by close to closing time for dinner, and service didn't skip a beat. Beatriz was our lovely server who gave great suggestions and answered all of our menu questions in great detail with a genuine smile.

I got the Tamarind Guava Colada for starters. The most beautifully refreshing cocktail I've had in a while. Corn Lollipops came next; pretty basic elote style corn on the cob with braided husks for decoration, but no complaints. While my date's lamb looked stunning, my NY Strip was a righteously perfect medium well. BUT, the surprise show stealer was the mini quesadilla accoutrement next to Mr. Steak. Mushroom & some sort of melty bleu cheese flavor made it the best part. Also, who doesn't like legit molé instead of A-1?

Chica takes the spot of the former DB Brasserie in the Venetian.  I went for Restaurant Week dinner and I chose (with menu descriptions):

Empanadas Pabellon - Crispy arepa masa stuffed with braised ground beef, sweet plantains, black beans, queso fresco and spicy guasacaca pico
Porchetta with crispy yucca hash - Slow roasted suckling pig, crispy brussels sprouts, fried yucca, pearl onion escabeche, pork jus
Tres leches dulce de leche - Traditional ""Three milks"" cake topped with toasted meringue, with exotic fruit pico

The empanadas were the let down of the meal.  You can see from the photo that the one was especially crisp and the bottom of that one was blacker in one spot.  Someone needs to watch the grill more carefully.  The empanadas were OK but they need more moisture.  The porchetta was flavored well and was juicy.  It had a crisp exterior.  The pork jus made the porchetta even more juicy.

The tres leches cake was the real winner of the night.  Excellent cake-moist throughout from the three milks.

Service was good but sometimes it was too good.  There was a busser who kept walking back and forth and took dirty plates almost as soon as you put down your silverware.  The table next to me had to ask for another share plate because he took the one she was using for shrimp tails she cleaned off her shrimp.

4035544,2018-07-01,9,gOOfBSBZlffCkQ7dr7cpdw,"Refinement and sophistication are terms that one would use to describe this master piece of a Restaurant. Latin cooking has a distinctive flavor and that delicate balance has been refined to preserve all the phenomenal flavors and incorporated into the menu here. The drinks have been infused with fruit and other fruit juice to put a new spin on old classics. 

Once in a while a few ladies and I, will get together for dinner and catch up on everything. Accepting the invitation of Refinement to come out and be guests with Peroni we jumped at the chance. This was a private event that Chica sponsored the space.

The Peroni event sampled this liquor in an array of drinks that were made up for all of the guests to sample. The beautiful restaurant was perfect for hosting this venue. Our area included the bar and a few tables by the bar, just to the right of the hostess stand.

The catering was done with sampling of the menu at Chicas for all the guests to try. The amazing wait staff brought around trays of beef filled enchiladas for the first round. The last sampling from Chicas menu was a cinnamon roll with Latin twist and it was amazing. 

The bartender made the drinks for the guests to take from the bar. A serve yourself or wait for the staff to bring the drinks by on a tray. The bartender had an awesome skill level of what goes in the drinks serving. The bar was also open if a guest wanted something other than what was being served. 

The decor of Chica is really over the top! The tables are paired with such comfy chairs. The colors they use to decorate are warm and welcoming. The lighting in the dining area is so delicate that it captures a perfect place to share a meal with a that special someone. The bar lighting is brighter than I have seen, and is ambient feeling. The sleek black granite coloring of the bar gives it a nice focus. 

The cocktails that were made focused on infusing strawberries and raspberry with Peroni in some fashion. Who knew that Peroni could taste so amazing in cocktails. 

The first drink they offered was a strawberry lemonade mix with Peroni. It was so sweet and delicate. It had real strawberries served in it too.

The second drink came in a brandy style glass with raspberry sorbet and Peroni. The fizzy violet bubbles were what made this drink. At the bottom of the glass were real raspberries and were full of all the Peroni flavor.

The third sampling was Peroni beer from their
glass bottles. You had a choice to drink the Peroni straight from the green bottle, or pour it in a pilsner cup. It was good either way.

There were games that Peroni had us play, if you wanted too. The photo booth was fun. The DJ was spinning records live for this catered event too. They encouraged us to take snaps with one another; then post to Instagram or what ever social media platform one use

The girls and I just enjoyed one another's company. Jammed to some tunes. Met some new people . And were educated on fabulous cocktails at an amazing restaurant. We are already planning our next visit!",I-4KVZ9lqHhk8469X9FvhA,20,17,5,RGFslOJOpFcbHlyeeEKVJQ

I also ordered the berry mojito and this was the weakest point of the meal. It wasn't bad just didn't stand up to the meal.

4174323,2018-02-27,3,gOOfBSBZlffCkQ7dr7cpdw,"Despite the good service, the overpriced food was just was so notably bad, that as much as I'd like to give this place three stars, I really can't. You'll definitely pay, but you WON'T get! My generosity of two stars stems from the overt effort the waiter made to please a customer.

Empanadas were really just ok. Nothing special at all, but fine ($15.00 for 3 pieces).

I was really looking forward to the Grilled Peruvian Octopus, as the waiter really built it up as one of their best dishes. I love octopus, and grilled Peruvian sounded great, but I was a little leery because I saw that a few fellow Yelpers commented on the saltiness. Because of this, I specifically told the waiter that I wanted very very little salt on this due to what I had read. He understood, and said it wouldn't be a problem. Lo and behold, fellow Yelpers we're right - it was so salty that it tasted like they accidentally spilled a bunch of Morton's on the dish. This was a$26.00 dish (and small too), and I didn't even eat half of it! Now, that's nothing like me!!  The waiter asked about my barely eaten dish, and I told him that it was basically inedible!! He was so nice and insisted on having the dish brought out again sans salt, even though I said I'd rather just pass. Well, unbelievably, their second try came out as bad as the first dish?!?! Based on my analysis, I think a huge part of the saltiness came from the toppings/batter. How could they screw it up again a second time? Anyway, never again!!

To top it all off, the food was so terribly overpriced for what I got that I wish I had just gotten a burger. The food was extremely expensive and waaay to SALTY!!",LNEXz0drBNtLHwrb1G-VPA,3,2,2,z7X8R_1DG5fVqBE9wUq7Lw

 My entree was the meyer lemon chicken, and it was bomb. Crispy skin, juicy chicken. The only place it fell flat was the side of potato salad. Bland. Nothing special. No heat or richness or acidity or anything. I'd try and sub for something else, but the star of the dish was the delish chicken anyway!

Finally, I told the waiter I don't do sugar, so they made a special stevia whipped cream and fresh fruit concoction that was awesome! Kudos for helping a brother out.",zsfK43ckzue9DRlCq1yNVg,0,0,4,kBlXO94ukiTvC6RPv4UwZQ
4352531,2018-01-26,1,gOOfBSBZlffCkQ7dr7cpdw,"I recently attended the CES conference and was excited to find myself in the same hotel as Chica. I am admittedly a fan of Chef Lorena Garcia, so this restaurant was already on my bucket list to try since the opening last year.

So of course my first order of business before any conference-related activities was a solo brunch. They seated me quickly even though it was pretty busy already. I was quickly offered the chance to order a drink by the awesome Adrienne, and went with a nice classic mimosa. The menu is very simple, just two pages, but I asked for some suggestions from the staff before ordering. Adrienne brought me the guacamole appetizer, with an assortment of accoutrements - tortilla chips, plantain chips, and mini arepas in different flavors. The guacamole was delicious, and I really loved the pairing with the plantain chips. The arepas were excellent, and I enjoyed their flavors so much I didn't bother dipping them in the guacamole.

I also ordered the Grilled Peruvian Octopus, which did not disappoint at all. It was perfectly cooked, amazing flavor from both the octopus and the shishito peppers, and the crispy quinoa offered a nice light crunch. Absolutely recommend this appetizer!

For the main course, I settled on the Chica Burger, which Adrienne and manager Michael recommended to me when I couldn't decide. I had my heart set on tacos, but I'm glad I went with their suggestion. This burger is outstanding. Perfectly cooked to my preferred ""pink in the middle,"" with a super flavorful meat blend, and the kick of the Chica sauce was nice as well. It's topped with bacon, jalapeno jack cheese, avocado, crispy fried onions, lettuce, and tomato. Definitely a two-hander, and definitely recommend.

I didn't stop there. I wanted one more drink, and the bartender, Freddy, served up a margarita called ""Some Like it Hot."" It's made with their house-made papaya habanero jam, lime juice, and Espolon Reposado tequila. It has quite the quick, and I'm told that the spice level can vary based on the batch of jam, but if you like spicy you'll love this.

Lastly, I dabbled in some dessert! The pastry chef at Chica recently won Pastry Chef of the Year in Las Vegas (http://www.eatinglv.com/2017/12/pastry-chef-year-sara-steele-chica/) so of course I had to try some dessert. Her Tres Leches Dulce de Leche cake is absolutely incredible. I would come back over and over just for that. 

I can not sing the praises of this place any more than this! If you're visiting Vegas and you want to eat somewhere where the food is delicious, the staff is wonderful, and the atmosphere is great, head over to Chica.",TvuOEsdS69ola9v4L9uz7w,1,1,5,HkcT8-KBLd6KLb58nJjPPg

We came here during our last visit to Vegas. I had no expectations going in and was very pleasantly surprised! 

The decor here is very nice and their service is EXCELLENT. It was some of the best service I've ever had in a restaurant. Our waitress was very knowledgable and when we mentioned we were in town celebrating a graduation, she had a congratulations cake sent out for us. The manager also stopped by. There were probably 4-5 people who came to check on us, which was a little overwhelming, but overall, everyone was great.

We tried:

Drinks:
-FW Margarita: refreshing, fun, well balanced
-Sangria Zarzamora: nice and fruity but could have used a little more liquor
-Coffee: The dark roast was excellent!

Small plates:
-Guacamole: great guac and I really loved the beet, black bean and cilantrol arepas it came with!
-Classic Cerivice: your standard cervice
-Crab and Shrimp Salpicon: a nice, tangy refreshing seafood salad that balanced well with the rest of our meal
-Grilled Peruvian Octopus: perfectly cooked octopus...yum!
-Mac Con Queso: this corn ""mac and cheese"" was probably my favorite dish. It had giant corn kernels that were a great and guilt free alternative to pasta. Where can I get this kind of corn?!

Dessert:
-Churro Fried Ice Cream Pops: these were nothing like what I expected but were yummy! Very vanilla-y.

All in all, we had a great time and I'm glad we came!

My husband and I made reservations for 7:00 on a Saturday night, but I'm not sure we needed reservations. The restaurant was fairly busy, but not full. We were seated right away in a comfortable table. I sat on the booth side and it was really comfortable with a plush booth and pillow for extra comfort. 

We wanted to start with Empanadas, but they were out for the night so we went with Asado Negro Arepas instead. This was a light and tasty appetizer. The short rib and toppings on the arepas was delicious with lots of flavor. I had the Sangria Zarzamora (red sangria) and loved it. There was a hint of sweetness with plenty of fruit, but it wasn't overly sweet. My husband had the Tamarind Guava Colada which was also delicious and fairly strong.

Dinner for me was the Brazilian Beef Tenderloin. I loved every last bite of this dish. I requested my meat rare and found it to be a deliciously tender steak with great seasoning. The grits underneath were also bursting with flavor. Awesome dish all around. My husband had the Yucatan Halibut which was equally amazing. All of the flavors of this dish were great and everything was well prepared. I was sold on this restaurant with my beef tenderloin alone.

Dessert was Tres Leches Dulce De Leche and Churro Fried Ice Cream Pops. My husband really liked his churro fried ice cream pops which included three pops. My tres leche was okay. It was good, but it wasn't the best that I've had. I'd go with a different dessert next time.

The only thing that kept this restaurant from a five star was the slow service. I'm not sure if it was our otherwise great waitress or the kitchen. This was a two hour meal and we were glad we allowed way too much time before our show.",3nIuSCZk5f_2WWYMLN7h3w,1,0,4,JhecePnXtjHh1coQ5QD6XA

It's almost like walking into a formal Hooters. Anyhow, I ordered a Gin & Tonic which is quite different at this bar. Instead of using tonic water she cracked open a cranberry tasting sparkly water. She then topped it off with a slice of lime. I've never had a G&T like this before but it was quite refreshing. I do wish it was stronger since the gin was pretty much covered up with the cranberry sparkling water. The total for my drink was $14.00. The fact that the bar is located in the Venetian I did not expect any thing less.

They need to send their wait staff back to basic training 101 or take hints from the Olive Garden corporate staff for training guidelines.

The French press coffee was pure light colored mud, and had to be taken back once and not consumed the second time, tres leeches cake was also a hit, but again it was tough to makeup for the ""CHICKA"" like wait staff, and that's not a put-down on kids, in fact my kids have and do a far better job in dining etiquette than these wannabes staff members did. Time for the management crew to do a review and correct the glaring and apparent short-comings. Unfortunately we were not the only patrons (Saturday night) that came away disappointed.

I have a mild obsession with Caribbean, Central and South American food. 
So to have a new place on the Strip, this could be the pinnacle of the cuisine! 
Not quite.... it was good, but not great, and with ""Las Vegas Strip"" prices... ugh
I must say the Classic Ceviche was great!!! Worth every penny and an absolute must!! 
I was looking forward to the grilled corn lollipops, but for $13 it's two corn cobs broke in half to make four small pieces, and it's just okay....
The guacamole was good, however the plantains served that accompany it are way better than the guacamole itself. 
There famous ""Short Ribs"" were some of the worst I have ever had. I do not recommend this dish.
The Pepita Crusted Lamb was good, cooked very well. 
Overall though, for these prices... the food, the service, and the whole experience.... it is just A-Okay.....",FEwPxhjdVKxSPVQQAHX2gg,6,2,3,7PjfqjWswATZkc1pfrWGrA

The food was great and the service was also perfect!

We ordered the empanadas and guac as appetizers. I had never tried guac and arenas together so I was hesitant but who am I kidding guac tastes magical on anything. Then we ordered the Grilled Steak Sandwich and the Herb Marinated Steak. Everything was delicious and filling!

I love the ambience of this place. It is so relaxing and light. The lights aren't dimmed too much and I loved the service we received today. 

There was a prix fix menu today for thanksgiving, but were also giving their lunch menu as well! We ordered the original ceviche, the empanadas and the pico platter to start! 

I ordered the Tamarind Guava Colada, and Jacob a cucumber gin and tonic. He enjoyed him but I was disappointment in the lack of tamarind or guava in the colada. 

I did like the ceviche but the hominy was starchy and hard to chew. Our favorite of the picos was probably the corn pico, as it was both sweet and had a slight pick! We did wish the platanos were season better. 

Jacob really liked the empanadas, but I believe they were baked and I do prefer my empanadas more crunchy.

We were both in agreement that the turkey enchiladas weren't as good as we were hoping. They did state that it came with a pumpkin mole which we didn't think tasted like a mole and more of a verde sauce. Although the turkey was very moist, we weren't fond of the pomegranate pico and we felt like it was flavorless.

We finished the afternoon with the Tres Leches, which I thought was super sweet. It was topped with a merengue and had condensed milk on the bottom of the plate as well as what was in the cake as well. I wished the fruit pico was more prominent. 


We do wish there was more of a wow factor from this place. I would have given this place 3.5 stars if I was able.",a_5PHpKHFQYtVgEr4QTUMA,1,2,3,j8YklAgneESGwNRPAAiudQ

4694508,2018-04-17,0,gOOfBSBZlffCkQ7dr7cpdw,"I was in need of a dinner reservation for a party of 8.  They initially had us down for 6pm on Saturday night, but I called to move it to 8:15pm due to a show we had at 10pm.  I had confirmed with them that we would be able to eat and get out of there in time for the show and they reassured me that we would.
Ambiance:  It has a very nice vibe and decor.  There is a lounge/bar area out front.  There was music going on in the back ground making you wonder if you were going to be eating in a lounge...however, as you walk towards the back, it truly turns into a lovely restaurant.  We were given a private room in the back that was completely isolated from the restaurant.  IT was good and bad.  We definitely had privacy, but you do not get to feel the vibe of the restaurant.  Halfway through, the server did turn on some music that made things a tad lively.  It was also difficult to flag down the server while in our room.  Restrooms could have used a little more attention.  There was no attendant and there were lots of paper towels along the floor.
Service:  We came at 8:10pm and was told that our table was being prepped.  We were not seated until 8:20pm.  It took a tad for our server to come and see us.  We were given our menus and I made it clear that we were on a time crunch.  He was very understanding and reassured us that we would be fine.  He felt a little hesitant to take all of our orders at in the beginning (wanted to get the drink orders first), obliged and was very nice about it.  From there, service started going downhill a tad...we requested lemon for our water and that had to be reminded a few times before it came out.  We had put in orders for non alcoholic drinks and that was forgotten as well.  Most of the food came in a timely fashion except for one of the entrees...that had to be reminded and came out quite a bit later. He was very apologetic about it but did nothing to rectify it.  Finally, i literally had to flag him down to get our bill and settle it.  We were out of the restaurant at 9:45pm.  It seems that he also had a few tables outside to take care of.
Food:  For the most part, really great flavors.  I loved the variety that the restaurant offered.  Lots of interesting appetizers.  Standouts included: Iberico ham (special of the evenign) that came out with warm rolls.  I also enjoyed the guac and variety of chips/plantain.  Everyone really loved the flavor and chunkiness of the guac.  The fried calamari was ok, nothing terribly special.  I was a tad disappointed in the corn.  It had too much mayo/cream and really didn't do anything for me.  For the entrees, I tried the Porcheta which I thought was really flavor.  A tad on the fatty side but I am not complaining.  I also tried the chicken and I was really impressed.  It was moist and had the perfect amount of seasoning.  The other thing I was a tad disappointed in was the mac con queso.  As long as you are not expecting pasta, you may enjoy it.  It is made of corn.  Was a tad different and didn't do it for me.  

I think overall it is a good resaturant and has potential.  I just couldn't give it a 5 star due to its service.",pJUzdorsC5BpC3q5ECi4Lg,0,0,4,i54x_JPCeW7JQlMI0Z1Apw

The only appetizer I was not a fan of was the ceviche. I prefer my ceviche to be lemon based and not with a strong tomato taste. The ceviche reminded me more of Mexican ceviche whereas I prefer the Peruvian version.

     When friends get together for dinner,  you can definitely bet that we will be drinking. Tried their house specialty drinks and they were great! Pepino Sandia was light and refreshing. The watermelon ""ice cube"" was interesting but I can just imagine all that alcohol soaked up and it would definitely deliver a punch haha. My friend ordered me a Rhum New Fashioned. Tasty and strong. Not my usual fruity and sweet drink order but it sufficed.

     Sante was the highlight of the evening. Kudos to her putting up with my friends' kids running around the table after they were fed. Even funnier when my friend's son practically burried his face on her behind because he was trying to get back to his seat and she was serving the table. Her patience and understanding made our night, especially with our dreaded split check fiasco. Sorry friends for that 30+ minute wait at the end of the meal but thank you for dealing with us,  Sante!

Food: 3.5/5
Guacamole w/ Assorted Chips & Mini Arrepas 
     What can I say? It was guacamole. Nicely seasoned. The great part about this was the assortment of plantain chips, mini arrepas, and tortilla chips that came with it. 

Grilled Corn Lollipops 
     Not to nit-pick their menu wording, but I didn't know cobbettes can also be called lollipops... corn was very crunchy, almost raw. Wish it was grilled longer. Not the best version of an elote I've ever had but a friend ordered it. Eating the dish made me wish they either had more butter or actual mayonnaise on it. Horrible I know. Presentation was cute with the husks tied into a knot, but that was all it had going for it.

Chicken Chicharones
     Very deceiving name by the looks alone until you read the description. You would think it would be chicken skin, but to call the dish chicharon is far reaching. It's basically an unbreaded fried chicken. Not crunchy as you would expect from the name. Seasoning was fine. Nothing memorable about it.

Grilled Peruvian Octopus
     I was very hesitant to order this dish because of the bad reviews it had, but my friends are suckers for grilled octopus that's available in any restaurant. Pleasantly surprised that it came actually cooked perfectly. Not chewy or gummy. Great seasonings. A little bit heavy on the salt, but overall a great dish.

 Shrimp and Butterlettuce Salad
     My friend ordered to try it and it was another great dish. A very light salad and the shrimp was cooked perfectly.

Arepa Basket
     These were amazing! Light, fluffy and definitely not dense. Reminded me of cornbread with the size that they came out in. The nata butter was velvety smooth and paired well with the mini arepas. They came in regular masa, red (I thought it was red, since the lighting in the restaurant is very dim), and blue corn. Would definitely order this by itself!

Porchetta w/ Crispy Yucca Hash
    Amazing! Who doesn't like pork?! The skin was crisp, meat flavorful and fork tender. No adjustments needed. Best entree of the night. Too bad I didn't order this.

Pepita Crusted Lamb
     Lamb was cooked to the desired temperature of medium rare. Didn't really get much of the pepita crust on it, but nothing else was memorable about it.

Strip Steak
     This was a dish that I shared with my friend. I already ruined it by ordering it medium, but she just couldn't do anything rarer haha. Out of all the items, this was the most that I anticipated but in the end was such a let down. This dish would've been my first time trying mole. Instead what I got on the plate of the sauce was a crusted on painting on the plate. To me that signaled that it was sitting on the heat lamp while other foods got expedited before it. The second thing I was excited for but was let down yet again was the ""huitlacoche quesadilla."" I love Point Reyes without a doubt, but if huitlacoche was in there I would not have been able to taste it at all. 

Rice & Beans
     Very simple dish. What could go wrong with It? It was a scoop of rice and a small dish of the beans. Not enough seasoning. Consider my rice loving side offended.

Hoppin' José Rice
     This side dish was flavorful. This was how the rice and beans should have come out, already mixed together and seasoned.

Panna Cotta
     Passionfruit I believe was the flavor but the kitchen didn't have any available. That was a let down.

Lemon Donuts
     Light, aery and with a great scent of lemon. Downside, there should have been more on the plate. These were finished by the table.

Tres Leches Dulce de Leche
     Passable. Not too sweet. Wish the cake was soaked in more leche. Would it be wrong of me to want a Marianna's or any other supermarket version of this dessert instead of this restaurant? 

Churro Fried Ice Cream Pops

4981100,2017-05-09,5,gOOfBSBZlffCkQ7dr7cpdw,"My friend invited me for one of the soft opening nights for friends and family. I am glad I went!

The place itself feels pretty upscale. I liked the décor. We were seated at the bar. One thing I did not like was that one of the drink stations was literally in front of my friend and I, on the counter. There were two plates of salt just sitting out right where our drinks should have been. 

Speaking of drinks, I ordered the sangria made out of the red wine, and my friend ordered the pablano drink. Mine was yummy! My friend however doesn't think she actually got what she ordered. The server asked her twice what she wanted before she made the drink, so I think she was just too busy to remember. My friend also wanted to order another drink, and was told it was a one drink limit, but would ask someone if she could have another. My friend ended up getting another glass of red wine.

We got an appetizer to share. We ordered the guacamole. It came with tortilla chips, plantains, and arepas. The plate was huge! Some of the people near us ordered other apps, and they were tiny, so we were glad we got what we did. The guac was very tasty, however it was a little watery. It was almost like a mix of guac and salsa. I loved it on the plantains.

We each got an entrée. My friend ordered the halibut, and I ordered the chicken. Mine came with a side of purple potato salad. The chicken and potato salad was very good! The chicken was tender, and the skin was crisp. My friend said her halibut was good too. Hers came with more plantains. 

The funny thing is that we also got a side to share, and we ordered the plantains! Haha lots of plantains in this meal. The side had some kind of cinnamon on it. They were soft and warm. They were really good.

Lastly we got a desert to share. The bartender/server recommended the churro pops to everyone at the bar. It sounded good, so we ordered it. Sadly, it took about 30 minutes to get the desert. The service was very very slow. The churro pops were good, however we believe the ice cream in the middle was just vanilla. We were told before ordering that it was caramel ice cream. Oh well. 

All in all, this is a nice new upscale place in the Venetian. All of the food was approved by us! Service speed could improve, but hard to critique this, as this was just a soft opening.",64WaWNeYSmN45a1MdiFv5w,4,1,4,cBfJCLLtJUXUlXobgA8ksw

The place is beautiful, the vibe is cool, decor beautiful kinda Latin South American vibe to it, place was busy,  energy was great and the food for the most part was tasty (mostly appetizers). 

But unfortunately they made too many mistakes. Some of them were really bad. 

1. Serving 2 steak dishes (45$) when the steak was completely cold. 

2. After talking to them they took back the steaks and brought it back to our table after putting it on the pan or possibly even in the microwave. The stakes were definitely not good. Dry and completely lost their taste. 

3. They sell a rice dish that doesn't show on the menu that it has pork in it. Some of our table were vegetarian and some were Jewish so pork is definitely a no go for like half the table. When we said something about it the replace with a new one but by the time we got our new one it was already too late to our meal. People lost their appetite. 

4. The server was definitely apologetic and felt bad and tried to make it easier for us, but i didn't see any try from her side to compensate us for those mistakes.

The food was simply incredible.  Chicken appetizer, jasmine rice, ceviche all out of this world.  My friend called the octopus the best he's ever had.  

I've never posted a restaurant review.  But I could not wait to tell this story.

We tried the guacamole which come with plantains and arepas: beets cheese and I want to say the third one is black beans. Their guacamole is not your normal hass avocado that you get in Mexican restaurants. It's very unique. What I liked the most of the place is that they tell what country the dish is from. 
Our experience with the restaurant didn't start off right. My girl got the chicken and I got the halibut dish. 
Her dish came first and then ten minutes later they brought my out. But once my girl took a bite the chicken was super cold. The kitchen or the waiter mess up. Don't know who.

5094956,2017-06-08,13,gOOfBSBZlffCkQ7dr7cpdw,"From chef Lorena Garcia comes Chica, a Latin American eatery.  Oh, it's good.

First female, first Latino, first... blah blah blah casino PR aside, The food, while toned down to be kinder to the American palete and prettied up, is solid.  (Sorry for lack of pics, we have a no phones at the table rule).

To start, the simple grilled corn lollipops. Essentially Mexican street corn. It showcases sweet, buttery, not starchy corn brightened with a squeeze of lime and lime oil and a citrusy heat from piquin peppers all dusted with generous shavings of cotija cheese.  Sweet, earthy, citrusy in all the right ways.

The grilled Peruvian octopus, excellent. Extremely tender, it's oceanic flavors meld beautifully with a warming aji amarillo (Peruvian pepper paste with up front chili flavor) and accompanying guasacaca pico. Blistered shishito peppers add a brilliant bitter, vegetal foil.

Finally, be sure to order the guacamole. Not that it's different from the best in your local city, it's eating it with crisp fried plantains.  Crispy and starchy meets creamy, gently spicy, and citrusy. It's so goodly.  Sorry, couldn't resist.

Mains sampled, are very good packing a flavor punch. Top marks to the Venezuelan braised short rib. Deep and earthy flavor's penetrate the bone in, fall apart tender beef. A purée of black-eyed peas enhance the earthy the spice blend.  Pickled onions, the sour vibrancy to balance the beef.  A touch of epazote essence adds a pronounced herbal, almost astringent finish that greatly enhances the complexity of the dish.

The other stand out, the porchetta. It's simple, who doesn't love tender, juicy, crispy skin pork sauced with his own juices. Sautéed Brussels sprouts, and yucca work to bring out the pork's sweetness.  Excellent.

Although sidea are totally unnecessary as each dish is accompanied with some, the ""mac con queso"" (Peruvian corn with hearts of palm, wilted spinach and an intense Parmesan cream gratin) is a must.  Just try this.  Trust.

Service is friendly and efficient but not polished. This should improve with time.

Solid beverage program. Cocktails truly match the food.  G&T fans, try either the pepino sansia with its watermelon ice cubes, cucumber and mint) or regaliz de fresa with strawberry, star anise and lemon oil.  Either works to cut spice and refresh the palate.

Location:  Venetian, restaurant row, across Sugarcane (old DB Brasserie).

All told, an impressive and fun.",oeAhRa8yFa9jtrhaHnOyxQ,25,17,4,zKFfjypFVPaU6SWaoKhBMg

We ordered the OJ and some coffee as drinks. The Oj was delicious and fresh. The kitchen gave us a set of four arepas as an appetizer to our brunch, which was super friendly. I ordered the breakfast burrito, and others in my group ventured to other items. I absolutely loved the flavor of my burrito. Most restaraunt make insanely large breakfast burritos, but I feel that the portion size at Chica was reasonable. I ate every bite and cleared my plate. The textures were perfect, and had a great ratio of dry to wet ingredients.  My friends ordered Huevo Ranchero, and noted that their food wasn't as hot, so I think the kitchen had finished their items before mine. My item was the perfect temperature. For this, the review is closer to 4.5, but as a new restaraunt, I know there are some kinks to be worked out!

At the end of our meal, we were given postcards that we could fill out and mail anywhere. This was such a cute idea, and we loved doing this!

You would think maybe the restaurant week meals would be small but I LITERALLY got a half of chicken! Last but not least, donuts were the only choice for dessert.

5181500,2017-07-03,0,gOOfBSBZlffCkQ7dr7cpdw,"Hello and welcome to Chica. I am working backwards in my reviews of our restaurant week visits and this was stop number 3 in #helpoutdineout week in Vegas. I had worked a half day and Josie decided she wanted to try a lunch spot for a change so we traveled to The Venetian for a nice lunch. I am a fan of Lorena Garcia and have been wanting to try this for a while and so has Josie. We had reservations and arrived early (of course) and were seated immediately. Drink orders were taken right away and delivered in a timely manner. The Coke and Diet Cokes come in a bottle and there is not an unlimited refill. The bottles are the Classic Coke style with the Diet Coke being smaller than the Original Coke bottle. I will post pictures in a few. Blanca was our waitress and was very informative. Very soft-spoken but very helpful with every question we had regarding our meals' components. 
The decor and layout is very quaint. You can sit at the front bar or at one of two other areas that have raised seating. one is where the prepare the salads and cold apps, the other where the rotisserie chicken is prepared as well as some hot apps. 
The lunch menu was simple with rather easy things to choose from.  
First course was a salad round with a Kale salad and a classic ceviche and chica fries. We opted for the Kale salad and civiche. Kale salad was had by Josie and had green apples dried cranberries, Napa cabbage, croutons and a citrus vinaigrette. This salad was piled high and presented very nicely. had a crisp clean citrus tang almost like a key lime pie flavor. apples were subtle and cabbage had a nice crisp bite to it. This alone could be a meal. My civiche had halibut, corn, red onions and cilantro. also accompanied with peruvian chips. (plantain chips) all sat in leche le tigre. Second course Cuban sandwich for me and Shrimp & quinoa cazuela. I will start with my Cuban Sandwich. I was expecting a small portion due to it being a lunch menu, it was not. Wonderfully cooked with the pressed grill marks on what they said was a sweet roll. Mojo pork, Smoked ham,Guayanes cheese, Dijon mustard and sweet pickles. As you bite into the sandwich you get the sweet taste of the roll with the bite of Dijon with the Mojo (vinegary) taste of the pork and the smokiness of the ham. Cheese just melty, salty and soft to the palet. Yes, i loved this sandwich. She also brought this Pablano spread for my fries that was much better than any ranch could ever be. Josie had the Shrimp Quinoa. Red shrimp perfectly cooked over a red quinoa and the same cheese as my Cuban. Shrimp was seasoned with a slight tangy bite. Quinoa was properly cooked with a hint of cilantro and pablano pico. Final course was Lemon Bunuelos with served with a wild berry compote. So donut holes filled with lemon and a berry jelly. Not filling which was fine since we will be going to Carlos Bakery while in the Venetian. Nice zesty sweet bite to end a great lunch.
Thank you for dining at Chica. we will most definitely dine here again for a dinner menu. Everything from the very start was exceptional. I am slow to give out five starts but this gets them. Blanca was an excellent host on our lunch adventure and made this experience worth it. . Only negative is the non unlimited drink refills.

The service was ok, but it felt as though our server was a bit stretched out across too many tables, not his fault. Food did take a little longer to come out than we hoped considering its tapas style. Restaurant has a great ambience and modern feel, its closer to venetian in restaurant row.

By far the best dishes we had on the menu were the empanadas and the octopus. We ended up re ordering both. Empanadas could have used just a touch more of the pico de gallo, excellent combo. The short rib arepas had good flavor, but the arepas themselves were a bit on the doughy side. 
For a main dish we got the porchetta - on the fattier side and had a great outer crust. The rest of the dish was meh, it was all fried! Fried brussel sprouts and a fried yuca hash. The dish really needed a hit of acid or sweetness to balance it out and less things fried. Wouldn't order that again.
For dessert the churro lollipops were like a deconstructed version of churros with ice cream in the middle and a nice velvety whipped cream. 
Overall there were a few really memorable dishes. If you come here the octopus and empanadas are a must get. Will definitely be returning.

5237472,2017-10-01,4,gOOfBSBZlffCkQ7dr7cpdw,"Chica is oddly placed in the Venetian (not located along restaurant row), but on the second floor of the casino next door to Yardbirds. 

We were excited to try this upscale Latin cuisine / place after hearing that Chef Lorena Garcia (seen on Bravo, Top Chef). We made reservations in advance, and got wonderful seats upon arrival. The natural sunlight from the center room with wrought iron surrounding the restaurant will surely catch your eye, as well as the other rooms that transition to dimly lit. 

We ordered a few items: 
 
1. The Tamarind Colada and Bloody Mary to start. This cocktail was soooo expensive for its size. $16 if I'm not mistaken. Delicious, but a little expensive for my taste and it was loaded with loads of crushed ice.  Bloody Mary: Very, very short glass / contents with a plantain and and odd cube of cheese? 

2. Next up: The empanadas. This was quite disappointing (sad face). The pastry dough was too thin, hard and the ingredients very bland. We mentioned this to the waitress, but she just apologized. 

3. Brunch items:  Grits, egg and chorizo. This was definitely the star. The grits were made in-house and had a porridge like consistency. Eggs bene with pancetta on arepas: This was quite dry and lacked flavor. Tostado with egg: This was just okay. It had so many black beans, that I was missing the other listed ingredients. 

4. Dessert: Venezuelan chocolate mousse cake: Very nice. We enjoyed the small dark drizzles of chocolate, and raspberry. Churro Pops:  Not sure why they emphasize ""churros"" when the real star of the dish are the pops (similar to cheese cake rolled in churro dust). The churro sticks were a little disappointing as well. Thin, small and just okay. 

5. 12 oz coffee in a carafe: The chartreuse carafe was adorable, but the coffee was nothing special. And they only offered half and half in the kitchen. What?! No soy for a $12 priced carafe?

5242612,2017-08-05,0,gOOfBSBZlffCkQ7dr7cpdw,Pretty great. It's nice to see some character in the food being offered in the Casinos. The originality of their offerings is refreshing. Everything on the menu that I tried was great. Service was really good too. I would give it five stars if the prices were a bit more reasonable on the appetizers and desserts. It really was quite amazing and I am looking forward to going there the next time I am in the Venetian or Palazzo. I hope this place sticks around.,hjfppBJVzp5v1gHNme_iVw,0,0,4,B7FmVMsTB6x4F54DM1zhEQ
5253132,2018-01-02,1,gOOfBSBZlffCkQ7dr7cpdw,"I am so disappointed in our experience here. I recently heard of this place and with the great reviews and unique menu, we decided to try this out for our group New Years dinner. Honestly, one of the worst dining experiences I have ever had. I will say the location is great, decor is beautiful!

But the dining experience itself was absolutely terrible. We had a group of 7 people. We ordered several appetizers, we received one appetizer for the entire table and waited at least 15 mins for the remaining appetizers to arrive (although several of them were easy things like chips and guacamole or chips and salsa). Then we received our entrees. Two of my friends had ordered steak and both were completely cold when they arrived. They notified the server who said she would bring new steaks for them. Another person ordered corn which did not seem fully cooked when received. My boyfriend and I ordered a side dish of rice which the menu said had ""fried rice, beans, and topped with fresh avocados"". Halfway through eating the rice I realized there were small pieces of pork in there.... I'm a vegetarian and my boyfriend is a kosher jewish and so obviously doesn't eat pork. The pork absolutely was not called out on the menu. Also there was edamame in the rice which was not called out. And instead of fresh avocados, there was a scoop of guacamole. I notified the server and she said ""really? That's not on the menu?"" I checked again to be sure, not called out at all. She asked if I wanted it remade, and I said absolutely since neither of us eat pork. That should not even be a question. The two steaks then arrived but it was clear they had just been cooked a little longer and replated, it was so awful one of the guys just asked to send his plate back. By that point every one else had pretty much finished their meals: my new rice dish came when we were done eating. Absolutely nothing was done to remedy the dishes that were wrong, except they comped the one steak that had been sent back. I am shocked at this service and extremely disappointed",9ERpIxUx1f66Idv42Nzm-A,0,0,1,6tfNB-fgN73nrGMQ-4Bpog
5254142,2018-06-25,0,gOOfBSBZlffCkQ7dr7cpdw,"Restaurant week is an amazing time of year where many eateries in Vegas offer set menus at discounted prices and donate part of the price to 3Square Food Bank. After surveying some of the options online, we were drawn in to Chica's for a nice Sunday lunch. We made reservations before hand, so, though crowded (brunch + FIFA), we were easily able to get a table. Initially I was worried because the music inside is really loud. We were sat in the back, which made it better but still a bit much. Our servers Jack and Amarie were excellent. Very social and friendly. The food was all amazing. My first course was the empenadas. Cooked to perfection. I wish it came with more than 2. Next, the Cuban sandwich. Amazing! I'm not a huge meat eater, but there was literally no flaw with this sandwich. Lots of meat, cheese, and Dijon mustard with a side of fries. My friend got the rotisserie chicken with purple potatoes. Sadly, she did not experience the same food ecstasy as I did, as both potato and chicken were underseasoned. It ended with a dessert of lemon donuts (more like donut holes). They were served on top of a berry sauce that made me want to lick the plate. Not too sweet and not too tart.

I continued to look at the menu for 15 minutes before the bartender came around to check on me. 
I ordered a glass of wine. By that time my friend had joined me at the bar. 

Things were way better when Jessica the bartender started her shift. She was very attentive and knowledgeable about the menu. She made some excellent recommendations. 

My friend n I enjoy a few appetizers and couple glasses of wine. The apps were full of flavor. My favorite was the octopus. I didn't really care for the chicharones, it had good flavor but it was like eating dry fried chicken.

Unimpressed by Db Brasserie from the start, the eventual shutter little more than a protracted death march after the kitchen switched Chefs in an attempt to recover from the mistake of treating Las Vegas as if it was a one-off town willing to settle for a mish-mash greatest hits compellation rather than an original idea, it was with high hopes that the space could shine under the management of 50Eggs that friends and family was attended at Chica, the service an unmitigated disaster even for a trial run while the food was mostly good, though much showed room for improvement.

Fresh off of almost unprecedented success with Yardbird Southern Table & Bar, not even a couple of changes in the kitchen slowing business for a restaurant that remains full at nearly two-and-a-half-years in, Chica is touted to ""give guests the opportunity to explore the flavors of Latin American cuisine as one culture"" with a menu from Lorena Garcia featuring ""influences from Venezuela, Peru, Brazil, Mexico, and Argentina, among many more,"" the decision to hire former Border Grill Chef Mike Minor to head a restaurant ""boasting the first Latina chef on the Las Vegas Strip"" seemingly an odd choice regardless his skills.

Now open just over six weeks, presumably enough time to iron out most kinks when considering the fact that Yardbird was on-point from week one, Saturday Brunch saw Chica at perhaps 25% capacity while its sister property was predictably out the door, the hostess at the podium retrieving a reservation as if she was surprised before handing three guests off to another young woman who led them through a maze of obstacles to a table against the back-right wall.

Featuring a Full-bar, Ceviche station and Rotisserie/Grilling area amidst stylish décor dotted in pots, books, plants and metal sculptures, the music overhead ranging from Shakira and Santana to older Mexican ballads, it was shortly after sitting that a young woman approached the table with a cocktail list, menus and three types of Coffee, a lengthy description of their origins and flavor notes apparently commanding $12 for a two-person French Press featuring an admittedly smooth brew out of Peru with subdued spice and lingering fruity notes.

Opting to defer menu choices to Chef Minor, only the Octopus, Tres Leches and a Watermelon-infused Lemonade for the youngster specifically requested, it was after greetings from Mike as well as the daytime Manager that the meal got underway, the ""Grilled Peruvian Octopus"" quite undercooked and thus rubbery despite being well flavored, the Shishito Peppers actually stealing the spotlight as they were served charred but not too spicy amidst toasted Grains and Yellow Pepper Sauce.

Perhaps making a mistake in returning for Brunch, the limitations of a this meal frequently stressed by in-the-know diners, it was by plate two that trouble was first sensed, the ""California Red Flint Grits"" with Eggs, Chorizo and Tomato Ragu about as 'Latin' as the Shrimp n' Grits next-door while the Chicken & Waffle seemed unapologetically ridiculous considering not only Yardbird but Chica's theme...even a nine year-old wondering aloud if people eat Waffles in Mexico, before also pointing out that although the Chicken was ""really juicy,"" the Waffle was ""too dry.""

Finding the sweet half of the menu a bit more interesting than savories, though a thin stack of Johnny Cakes with Berries and Cream has a long way to go before matching those at HeXX, Lorena's ""Award Winning"" Lemon Donuts were offered gratis by Chef Minor before moving on to the meal's three best plates, the crispy Churros piped with Espresso Cream alongside Cherries soaked in Syrup a suitable replacement for those previously offered at Art of Flavors as Las Vegas' best while the lighter-than-it-sounds French Toast with Dulce de Leche Drizzle is a great share-plate for just $14, especially since most will have no interest in sharing the sopping wet Tres Leches Cake served in a bowl with plenty of sweetened Milk and a topping of Toasted Meringue that is mellowed out my diced Fruit and Tajin.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,12,7,3,Dx-Cp_K-acGXtrnquhkh0g

It was so nice to have this beautiful restaurant almost all to ourselves for the beginning part of our meal.  What also makes this place top-notch is their service.

Thank you, Shawna and Chica, for showing that your customers are appreciated!  

The food didn't disappoint either.  I had their Cuban sandwich which was good - my favorite parts were the bread and cheese.  (I usually don't eat the type of meat that comes in a Cuban sandwich but wanted to try it anyway.)  I also liked my fries which I had with a creamy topping and bacon bits.  My dining companion had the shrimp tacos which she said were delicious and that she liked more than my sandwich which I let her taste.  For her birthday she got a complimentary single serving of their churro pops topped off with a birthday candle and a happy birthday greeting spelled out on the plate.

5653073,2018-01-01,0,gOOfBSBZlffCkQ7dr7cpdw,"Overall service was very good. We came for NYE. Ambiance was relaxed - not super uppity, you can go there to hang out and enjoy dinner. They don't rush at all. Music is outstanding. 

Food is a combination of flavors from South America. Peruvian corn and cheese was my personal favorite, but everything on the menu is delicious. Plantains were good, standard. The cheese fries were good but a little on the spicier side - freshly made cheese for sure. The salsas and arepas were delicious. Chiccarones were very good as well. The salads were awesome. The elotes were normal, it's on the cob so not as easy to eat or flavorful. 

Desserts were the highlight. Do not miss the churros. Mind-blowing dessert all around - the merengue, ice cream, cinnamon and flavors mingled perfectly. We also did the lemon donuts (a little dry but very good - not as lemony as expected). The tres leches was good as well.

5654232,2017-08-20,0,gOOfBSBZlffCkQ7dr7cpdw,"I am not a big fan of Lorena Garcia so I had not planned to eat at this restaurant.  We happened to walk by and since we have had such horrible experiences already and quite frankly did not wanted to walk any more, we decided to go in.  To my surprise, this restaurant turned out to be the best dinner we had in Las Vegas in the whole week.  The service was good, not outstanding but good.  The main reason why it was not outstanding is because it was a little slow.  The restaurant was almost empty and the waiter was a little slow.  The food took a while to get out, but when it got out it was worth the wait.  Everything was pipping hot and it looked like it came out of a magazine.  Their pictured dish is a pepita crusted lamb and when my son got his meal it looked exactly as it looks on the picture. My other son ordered the Braised Short Rib and it was melting in your mouth soft.  It came with black eye peas prepared two ways, and those peas were OUTSTANDING!.  I ordered the Chicken Chicharrones and the Arepa Basket.  These were extremele flavorfull, very fresh and cooked to perfection.  My husband ordered the Crab and Shrimp salpicon.  It was very flavorful, but compared to the rest it was completely insignificant.  We did not have dessert because the portions were too generous and unfortunately there was no space left to eat dessert.  

I always find flaws in the food, but I could not find a single flaw in any of those dishes.",iOPBJjTUhpYtDv305gOqoQ,0,0,5,jGCh1oe3QVK3IIMaNJaobQ
5658476,2018-04-18,0,gOOfBSBZlffCkQ7dr7cpdw,"while the food is excellent, the management style leaves a lot to be desired. Every morsel arrived perfect delicious & tasty  however the Meyer lemon chicken arrived so salty it was in edible. Reluctantly we told the waiter about the situation. He apologized and offered another entrée. At that point, we had already had appetizers, and drinks and I just simply asked for another one of the short rib appetizers. The waiter offered to comp the chicken and replace it with that appetizer - all  free of charge. When the manager came by, he apologized and remarked that others too  said the chicken was too salty. when the bill came we were charged for the chicken and the appetizer! Then they only offered to comp one of the appetizers. After we asked about the confusing bill they then only offered to comp our least expensive appetizer and charge us for the chicken! so while they saved $10 for three empanadas, they served three people who would tell 15 others each that it was not a good experience. I ask you, was that a good management move? as good as the food is would not recommend.",ME-qUdfY7dLq9abOlxOQ_A,0,0,1,B9TGdlPsslYQT5mu_wLjhg
5716327,2017-08-25,2,gOOfBSBZlffCkQ7dr7cpdw,"With all the choices available on the strip, it's tough for me to find a restaurant to get excited about.  When a friend wanted to try Chica, I investigated and achieved excitement:

1st - I can't immediately recall an upscale Latin cuisine on the strip, so this is a first.
2nd - head chef Lorena Garcia is a culinary superstar (TV spots from Top Chef Masters and America's Next Great Restaurant)
3rd - I love tacos.

Stepping inside you'll find the decor is stunningly beautiful.  The tiles, the artwork, and even the pottery, everything was considered to bring out the Venezuelan, Argentinian, Peruvian, Brazilian, and Mexican flavor.  The lighting is a very dim atmosphere, which sets up the nightlife - Next to the huge bar at the entrance is space for a DJ and a little dance floor which packs up on the weekends, says our server... we were here at 5pm on a Saturday and it was mostly empty.  GOOD, they can focus more on our food :)

Appetizers:
Pulled Pork Tacos ($12) - three street style tacos - take notice of the yummy, soft, doughy, housemade tortilla
Empanadas ($15) - three compact breaded delights with a light crunchy surface
*Asado Negro Arepas ($13) - three housemade arepas with braised short rib *my fave of the three apps

Entree:
Brazilian Beef Tenderloin ($52) - ordered it a Medium cook which came out a little rare, but it was perfect.  That incredible meat was harmoniously matched with the underlying grits.

They have great specialty cocktails too, I went with their twist on an old fashioned, Rhum New Fashioned ($15), always good. 

There's a lot more food I wanted to try: the ceviche, the octopus, rotisserie chicken, halibut, lamb... I'll have to come back again soon.

(TLDR) Beef Tenderloin and the Arepas stood out as the highlights of the meal.",HixtBO7z5OW5bo_6qo6D_g,7,5,4,aDerqBbt1cmoizOBwjw4ag

5738766,2017-09-22,14,gOOfBSBZlffCkQ7dr7cpdw,"For a group of 20ish people, we had a $40/per person quota/minimum to hit to make a reservation for Sunday brunch and we struggled (half of the group didn't drink but went along with it for convenience and to be troopers). Not sure if the reservation was entirely necessary as the place didn't seem that crowded, but when you're rolling that deep, sometimes it's better to have concrete plans rather than wing it.

We started with a couple of sweet brunch dishes for the table to share (pancakes, French toast, churros). Those seemed to be the favorites of the dining experience and maybe if we had stopped there, the meal would have been a hit. Drinks were brought out intermittently throughout our time there, but not necessarily in the order they were ordered. The staff helping the main server seemed to be more efficient in getting drinks expeditiously than when ordered directly from the server, which is odd, but you bob and weave accordingly, especially when you're trying to help tip the tab in the right direction.

When the entrees came out, I can say with all certainty that no one had a real ""this is amazing"" look on their face, in fact, two of the girls that ordered chicken and waffles were practically crying, as Chica's version is rotisserie chicken on top of waffles that are drenched in some kind of grilled peppers/onion concoction. Granted, that might be spelled out on the menu, so prob user error on their part, but still! I had fish tacos and they were hearty, but lacking any outstanding flavor. Another girl got ceviche and it was more like soup de ceviche. I liked it, but she was disappointed since she was expecting something more traditional.

Our server had different attitudes with us throughout the meal...sometimes he was hot, sometimes he was cold. I understand it's a big group, but I don't think we were too demanding or rowdy, so not sure why we got Jekyll & Hyde.

All in all, a decent enough experience to warrant three stars, but I don't think worth the $40/person price tag for brunch.",hizGc5W1tBHPghM5YKCAtg,24,14,3,1pCC8v5wZhnt5Zbd8VIqlw

The guacamole was amazing and there are great other sauces and corn dips - the plantain chips are awesome. The ceviche is great too - few different types you can get, all amazing. 
The steak is to die for, the lamb is fabulous and the halibut are all great entree choices.
