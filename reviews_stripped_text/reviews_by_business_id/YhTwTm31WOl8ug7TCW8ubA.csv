The service is excellent and the menu has something for everyone. Price wise a little high, but pretty much in line with other steakhouse restaurants in the area.

EXCEPT the Caesar salad! The classic Caesar is made tableside with anchovy, egg, garlic, oil, worchestershire, parmigiana and lemon. The Redwood makes theirs in the kitchen and that's fine but the three anchovies on top of the salad were awful. It was more like sardines and even after removing them the salad still just tasted like FISH. We did send it back and later that night I thought to ask the person who paid and he told me they were NOT removed from the bill. No no no...
Also, our server was just OK. One person in our party ordered gin on the rocks and she asked if he wanted lime. LIME? It's not a gin and tonic. She said something like ""I don't know what it is I just know people order lime sometimes.""
Know what you're serving. And never EVER bring two tables' meals out at the same time on the same cart. Just. No. We did not enjoy watching the other table being served while our entrees sat on the cart --while she looked at her ""brains"" several times to figure out what went where. 
The food was terrific and the bus girl was outstanding. Waitress and fish salad, not so much. We will go back when in Vegas.",Zpvb7XeK8uQhukp9WttE8w,1,0,3,Qj7w1fAnnp3E6otE_eT9rw

First it was the company I had the pleasure to dine with.
My parents and my wife, that's it.
Conversation just followed effortlessly.
I just didn't want it to end.
People that have had the experience of having both your parents as we age, well, you get what I'm saying.
Fresh bread that was crispy on the outside, chewy moist on the inside and partnered with a warm bowl of pearl onions, olives, peppers, herbs and roasted garlic bathing in olive oil.
I wasn't even hungry to begin with but managed to eat a loaf myself. 
Yikes! 
Don't judge, it was kinda small square ... ok ... Yikes!
Baked Organic Scottish Salmon - Isn't it already organic if it's from the deep, cold ocean? - Oh, well. 
Make that 2 orders please.
Crisp on the outside, moist and flavorful topped with lump crab meat and drizzled with a chardonnay & tomato cream sauce.
2 jumbo spears of grilled asparagus.
Heaven, wait til we finish this dish!
Don't let that cream sauce go to waist, (see what I did there?) get another order of bread!
Did I happen to mention this place is upscale/casual?
Not pretentious at all.
Pretentious is what you want?, Go to the strip.
People from Hawai'i don't go for that crab - again, see what I did there? 
Ok, I'll stop.
One of the BEST salmon dish I ever had.
If you like salmon, I recommend this dish.
Also, creamed spinach is a must!
Remember, I said, CREAMED not saut√©ed.
Spinach still has a little chew to it. (how?)
Be careful on that first bite though, burnt my tongue.
Did I mention that I wasn't even hungry?
I ordered the shrimp cocktail as my main dish.
3 HUGE shrimp served on a bed of crushed ice and the best horseradish sauce I ever had.
Yes, the bread complimented this dish a well.
Braised beef short rib.
Nothing jaw dropping here. 
Fall off the bone, very tender and high quality grade beef
in an intense wine sauce w/mashed potato.
Awesome service staff!
Even if I were to have won the lotto, I'd still chose the Redwood Grill over 97% of the big strip offerings.",v9XrxCJK8_PfCDn8uyH2hQ,1,1,5,ZnnM9RUOruT5Y4wwvsOtfQ

The bartenders are attentive and quite knowledgeable about their libations. Hint: Keith makes an awesome blueberry mule with Stoli blueberry and fresh fruit. 

My review is based on this newly renovated restaurant completed in September 2016. My dinner party ordered the crab cake, spinach salad, BLT wedge salad, 28 day aged Prime Rib, Alaskan king crab legs, seafood cioppino, warm apple dumpling and cr√®me br√ªl√©e. Freshly baked, buttered French baguette and roasted olives was served complimentary and a nice way to start the meal. I'm a big fan of embellishments and it would be nice if the entrees were dressed up a bit. Y'know, parsley, orchid, gremolata...just something that would please the eye and tease the palate.

All in my party gave their selections a thumbs up. But I especially liked the seafood cioppino which was a hearty red sauce which you could dunk your freshly baked bread slice in and mop up the sauce. Delicioso!

The waiter offered us bread which was tasty and pre-buttered. It came with a olive, artichoke garlic mixture thing, not a tapenade just whole olives. I just ate the artichokes but my mom liked the olives.

We both had the prime rib, 16 oz which was more we could finish, and as good as we had read. You buy the sides seperately. We split a baked potato that came with butter, sour cream, chives and bacon. We also split the Mac and Cheese and it was AMAZING. Before ordering I asked the waiter about it, he said he's not usually big on Mac n Cheese, but he would eat it everyday. He wasn't exaggerating. Cheddar, blue cheese and bacon, gave it such a rich, yummy flavor. I ended up asking if I can order just the mac n cheese  to-go when I'm downtown. He said if they aren't busy you can order to go, it just depends. 
Our bill ended up being about $70, but the people next to us had split their steak, and we said we'd do that next time with the prime rib. We aren't any skinny-minnies either, but it was a lot of food to handle.

The other table had gotten the French onion soup which looked delicious, and was a large serving. They said it was excellent, we'll definitely try that next time.

2465264,2016-12-21,1,YhTwTm31WOl8ug7TCW8ubA,"OK; since the renovation, I have not reviewed this restaurant.  I guess I should since I've been going here for over 30 years, about 16 times a year.  The environment is nicer IMO.  Brighter, higher ceilings, and cheerier.  Not like the old steakhouse interior of the past.  Food is still pretty good, and I think the meats are of better quality now.  Previously, only the prime rib was of prime grade beef, but now, all the beef cuts are prime.  The NY cut steak is now a bigger and thicker portion -- but if you eat it medium or even cooked longer, don't bother ordering this cut.  It will become a little tough, but if you order it rare, it is excellent!  They have a new Thai seafood appetizer that is wonderful.  Their bread with the meal is also great, but a much smaller loaf now.  They also give you a ramekin of various olives that is very good.  The took off the wilted spinach salad and the baked oyster from the menu and that is a bummer.  Myself and a lot of other people loved those two items.  On the negative side, prices are higher, everything is now ala carte, and the portion sizes of some things (like the crab legs) are smaller.  That is a bummer for some people, but for those of us on ""full comp"", that is OK.

While I thought the food overall was good and a much better value than the strip on thanksgiving, there were some items that were very overpriced/not worth reordering. 

Crab cake ($13) and pineapple shrimp ($12) were tasty but veryyyy small portions for the price. Reconsider those, I wouldnt order them again (partly because they aren't worth the money but also because the entrees were the stars). 

However, the entrees were amazing. The thanksgiving dinner, complete with dessert, ($28) was a hit with my husband. My miso sea bass was incredible. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. I wish I hadn't eaten anything else for dinner so I could eat all of that entree.

Definitely a good option for higher end food in this hotel. Good upscale ambiance, great service, and a well thought out menu.",OfdX0DGrAET9jqn_7gkXww,4,4,4,SJad6gMunUOduhhTr3hm3A

3969868,2017-10-15,6,YhTwTm31WOl8ug7TCW8ubA,"I've tried most of the steakhouses at Boyd Gaming properties and this was the best.  I made a reservation and was seated right on time.

My server was Mark and there was another person who was always at my table refilling my iced tea and water.  She was a gem!

You're first brought a bread plate with a side bowl of pearl onion, olives, and artichoke hearts along with some pimento.  The bread was already buttered but I'd have liked some extra.  I could have asked but didn't.

I started with onion soup.  They have a good version with a good broth.  I ordered the 16 ounce New York Strip done blue and it was cooked perfectly--nice grill marks on both sides and very rare interior.  The steak was tender and had just the right amount of salt sprinkled on it before grilling.  I got a side of house fried potatoes that are coated with garlic, parmesan and butter.  They were really good but it's meant for sharing as are most steakhouse sides.

For dessert, I went with the warm apple dumpling served with a scoop of Lapperts salted caramel ice cream.

I was very pleased with my meal here.  The music was non-descript and not loud.  The room got a bit noisy when it was almost full.  There were two tables of large parties that all couldn't sit at one and there was another table for a birthday gathering.  It was a happy noise and not distracting or a bother at all.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,18,14,4,VEDlpCl8TkujwW5Xx4s2Sg

The restaurant was a bit busy so we had a drink at their bar and after about 5 minutes our booth was ready. I think they may have recently renovated because the restaurant was beautiful. Right away we were offered water and brought out a small, warm loaf of pre-buttered bread. They also brought out a small bowl of warm olives, artichoke, and small onions, cooked up with olive and a hint of lemon. It was delicious! For dinner we ordered a prime rib redwood cut cooked medium rare and a New York steak cooked medium well. The 'redwood cut' for the prime rib is HUGE, I would have gone with their 'grille' instead. The steaks are al cart so the sides really are sides. The side portions are sharable size. The redwood potatoes and asparagus were divine!!! Try the cheesecake for desert, you won't be disappointed. Iwould definitely recommend this place and look forward to visiting again.",qIdHq7NR8-VvlP_O3AYrBw,0,0,5,REeRMN7IwCNhhRrYmyBaWA

5020063,2017-01-06,0,YhTwTm31WOl8ug7TCW8ubA,"Redwood Steakhouse is definitely the finest restaurant in the California Hotel & Casino.  That said, the level of service and quality of the food I tried is not up to par with some of the better steak houses I've been to (Morton's and Ruth Chris).  

It is best to make a reservation in advance.  This is a big deal at a casino, where many (if not most) patrons are using gambling-related comps to pay for some or all of their meals.  

Seating is ample for couples or small parties of 4 but can get crowded for larger parties as they try to save space by squeezing more people than they should onto the larger tables.

Service is generally good but really not as good as the prices call for.  Non-casino dining at these prices would warrant better wait and bus staff coverage. 

The pre-dinner bread was good and pre-buttered.  The amount of butter was just right for me but might be too much or too little for others.

The French onion soup I tried was good but not outstanding.  It was flavorful without being overly salty, as some are.  More than one in our party commented on how the melted cheese was the best part of the soup.

The Caesar salad was only okay.  The lettuce was a little wilted and it seemed the salad had been made a while ago and taken off of the shelf to serve.  I'm used to much crisper, fresher-tasting lettuce in my Caesar salad.

The USDA prime flat iron steak was outstanding.  Perfectly cooked medium rare, as I ordered it.  Tender and juicy despite having very little fat.  The side of mac and cheese was good but not special.

I tried a bite of the chocolate cappuccino cake.  I didn't like it and most of the others who tried seemed similar unimpressed.  If I had actually wanted dessert, I should have ordered the creme brulee.

All in all, it wasn't a bad experience but that impression is based on the meal being comped by the casino.  Had I paid the menu prices for what I tried, my rating would have been 3 stars at best (more likely 2).",kkTOV5bnE9hHb5V_zd9b9g,6,4,4,eTN-FXjvxhlwVt_7EulbZw
5026612,2017-12-05,0,YhTwTm31WOl8ug7TCW8ubA,"This place was not what we expected. a nice fancy dinner in downtown was sort of out of the norm. when you think of food in downtown, its typically ""local"" food. a line for ox tail soup every night. thats what this place is typically known for. When you add a fancy restaurant in the casino, its seems out of the norm. 

Suprisingly i kind of wished i ordered more and not focused on the price. i felt bad because i know i wasn't paying, so i picked one of the cheaper dishes. However, even the cheap dish was more than what i wanted to pay. 

This is a steakhouse, and i didn't order steak. The cheaper item on the menu was fish. Was i disappointed when it came out....no. It was delicious. One of the things that you would not expect. if you are on a somewhat on a budget, i recommend ordering the fish dish. it was both fulfilling and satisfying.",RLE3eudTgzSpiUUNGy8q2w,0,0,4,wvnuuF58exkw-UhesrpYZw

I really loved the visible salt embedded next to the grill marks. I also had asparagus and the french onion soup.  The onion soup was awesome. 

We ate in the bar and the service was excellent.  The stiff drinks were wonderful and the wine choice is good.

You order filet for $34.00, that's all you get nothing comes with the meal.  Sides are $6 dollars each. Our steaks were undercooked and not seasoned.  4 of us ordered med rare and med well. All steaks were rare and barely cooked. Service is horrible. After sending back the steaks, it took over 20 minutes to get them back. They were properly cooked but barely warm. Our server never came back. We kept asking for him. Finally the manager came over and brought us the check. This meal wad not worth $200+. We've been coming here for over twenty years and never experienced a meal or service like this. We will not be returning.

It's dim in the restaurant and you're greeted by the host who will promptly sit you. Someone will come to give you water, bread, and saut√©ed veggies. The bread and the veggies were very delicious, that already made me full because they kept refilling as we ran low. My party and I ordered steak and crab legs, roughly around $50 each. The portioning was on the small side, steak cut was small and there were about 3.5 cut in half crab legs on a plate. I could honestly say that if it wasn't for the bread/ veggies they gave me in the beginning I would have left this restaurant still hungry. This is what you get with fine dinning though, highly expensive prices with small portioning. Our server was nice but checked up on us a couple times due to tending to other tables. Would I ever come back? No. The environment and staff are great, just the pricing and portioning of food, I am not okay with paying $100+ (with tax and tip) to still feel hungry after eating.",80qYPp6Fk_jmO3334DKGGg,1,2,3,rC2DdWNDnxVcPIYVRu0NYA

5837452,2017-01-26,3,YhTwTm31WOl8ug7TCW8ubA,"Diane saw a billboard for Redwood Steakhouse that looked intriguing although neither of us had heard of it before.  So, after perusing largely favorable reviews on Yelp, we decided to check it out for ourselves.  And by meal's end we were glad that we did!

After I truly enjoyed an interesting amuse bouche of warm marinated Black and Green Olives accompanied by large pieces of garlic, we turned to a meaty Shrimp Cocktail with Atomic Horseradish Cocktail Sauce which was indeed a bit orbital in spiciness.  

Next I was pleased to be confronted with an ultra-cheesy and delightful French Onion Soup, followed by a very good Caesar Salad dominated by Romaine leaves but also including some Radiccio, and topped by 2 silvery anchovies.  

Diane and I then each opted for a  7 oz. Filet paired with an 8 oz. Butter Broiled Lobster Tail that was split between us.  The tender Filet was perfectly medium rare, and the lobster sweet and delicious dipped in a deep ceramic container of warm Drawn Butter.  A drinkable Bearnaise and well-made Cabernet Wine Sauce, along with an ample quantity of pan-roasted mixed Mushrooms and excellent crisp Redwood Fried Potatoes enhanced the steak and nicely rounded out the meal.  A scoop of sugarless Vanilla Ice Cream provided a refreshing end to a fine dinner.

Tableside service was friendly, very professional, and efficient.  Comfortable seating in the bright and colorfully decorated dining room added to the inviting casual ambiance.",s2o_JsABvrZVm_T03qrBUw,6,8,5,-FYsKDi0RrvaAoN2eVfAZQ
