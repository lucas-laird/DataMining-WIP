48305,2015-03-28,0,2bK1ng2mnRdtTh_BDNGmIg,"I used to order from this place a ton but the service has gotten so horrible it's not worth it. They generally take over an hour to deliver no matter the time or day. 

Each of the last 4-5 times I have ordered delivery they have forgotten something. Tonight they forgot both marinara sauce and a 2 liter of soda. They have at times changed the drink because they didn't have the one I ordered and didn't think to tell me until they were at the door. One time they gave me frozen mozzarella sticks. When I called to let them know they accused me of lieing and screamed at me. It took them over an hour to bring cooked ones, by this time I didn't even want them. 

The only saving grace is that the pizza is decent. It's not good enough to keep ordering from this place. If I could give it zero stars I would.

Edit:
I tried this place one last time. I had bank card fraud the following day after not using my card for anything else for the past 3-4 days. They also delivered the worlds worst pizza. See image here. http://i.imgur.com/FQ0OHen.jpg?1",_sgHg3Z_VltXQ2zoflaJiw,3,0,1,cENwcqX5GseUCIS6kylwTA

The caviat with this review is that I have never had true New York pizza, so it can only be compared to the places I have tried.

That said, the pizza here is amazingly delicious. It starts with a chewy thin crust, the only way a pizza should be eaten. I usually get the white pizza (garlic olive oil topped with mozzarella and ricotta), but I have also had the meat pizza. The toppings on that one were a nice, high quality.

I'm happy to say that North End is usually pretty busy when I stop in these days, and most of the other storefronts in the complex are being leased. When I first found this place there were very few people whenever I stopped in.

Overall, try the pizza here. It is worth the 20 minute drive out of my way every time I go.",lXCZe0xAd7DwV5aARJu92g,2,1,5,LUVozRJ9_7D09Dn0CSMAQQ

Ordered the white pizza that everyone keeps raving about...had them add some chicken to it, and a side of ""fried dough"" for delivery.
Food arrived in a timely fashion, but the pizza which I was craving to be nice and hot and cheesy..was lukewarm. :( bummer.
I mean, the fried dough...which was awesome... arrived hotter than the pizza!! But being that I bet they place the dough in deep hot oil to make them, I would hope they would be....but the pizza...it wasnt even hot....it seemed like it had been sitting out waiting to be delivered more than 5 less than 10 minutes..and the distance from my house to the restaurant, is honestly less than 10 minutes!! 
What happened? Was the delivery guys lil pizza carrier thingy out of heat storing juice?? did he stop and get gas?? idk.... :(
All i know is I was waiting for some hot cheesy make my mouth water type of pizza...and the chicken on the pizza looked like ground beef to me...hmm...idk...it tasted like chicken...but I was expecting slices of grilled chicken...not grounded up looks like beef tastes like chicken...chicken...BUT STILL....I have faith...and I will be back to give them another go..but when I do...I will go to them.",3GRwPwYc8CocrADwlpoXlA,1,0,3,HZ1gDdTQGT9bYPS64O7Mog

They make pizza with thin crust, good sauce that's not spicy and no tomato chunks, and it's a joy to eat. They're obviously from Boston since there is Boston references all over the walls.

The crust is flown in from Boston, which after several visits, I'm sure is the secret.  It's the water used to make the dough that set this crust apart from even the best recipe in Vegas.

It's thin, crispy but not over done, and topped with the perfect sauce.

Service is great and the wait is never too long.

Added bonus, the Slider Truck is in the parking lot of North End every Wednesday night so you can kill two cravings at once!

Fantastic pizza... Thank you North End!",v3TgiZpazvY5moN95UqBCQ,4,0,5,1H6ZPNcg0fhJ_FPCNZcDXw

We had been wanting to try North End Pizza for awhile; so when I felt like devouring 56 slices of saucy cheesey goodness after my day in the sun we decided to finally make the stop. 

No debating for me over what to order. Margherita special for the day? Yes, in a large please. And a side of fries. 

The fries weren't great, weren't bad. I dumped some garlic salt on them and they instantly improved. They brought out the pizza and I was a little disappointed- it was a bit skimpy on the cheese. 

After my first slice I was hooked. The crust is thin but not super thin, the sauce has a lot of flavor, and the mozzarella (what there was of it) was fresh. My husband and I ate the entire large pizza right then and there.",ELfzWgdf64VBLi5z1ECItw,2,0,4,ykk-iz3wiZlHlBmpqJfKDw

Now, I could have been persuaded to try the food - even at that price - if the manager was the slightest bit interested in selling it.  Tell me what makes it special.  Why should I choose your over priced items instead of the others?  When I questioned the price, he simply said I could look at the menu to verify the cost.  There's no way I could pay above top dollar for what is essentially fast food given the level of indifference that the manager had concerning my satisfaction as a potential customer.  He really couldn't have cared any less and it showed.  I can't believe that any more care is put into making the food.

This was on a Saturday night when any place with decent food AND service should be busy.  It's easy to see why there were only two people seated (I think one works there) and the phone wasn't ringing.

They either knowingly used expired/curdled product or no one bothers to check dates or quality before using products. Or they just use such cheap and inferior products, they don't notice they're curdled.

I ordered a white pizza tonight, first order ever from here. What was delivered was inedible, disgusting and rancid. The ricotta cheese was so sour and old, it was grainy and rough; ricotta cheese should be creamy, even after heating.

After an attempt via eat24 to resolve this, they seemingly refused to correct the situation; instead opting to still charge me for a pizza that at this moment, has a family member violently ill. It's going to be a long night...

I'm guessing management was willing to chance not being reviewed publicly or a visit from the health department.

I ordered 2 large pizzas and a small order of garlic knots.  They already had me in the system so I didn't need to give my address.  That's always nice.

For our pizzas we ordered the 1st one extra sauce, light cheese, ricotta and meatballs for the toppings.  That exactly how it came to us - simply perfect!  The 2nd pizza was just a plain 'ole pepperoni.  I didn't have any of the pepperoni but everyone loved it.  The garlic knots were a little tough so they were just ok and the marinara sauce it came with was very good..

Now I've recently gotten the pizza bug and I've never really been into pizza.  They say your tastebuds change every 7 years....so I guess this is my tastebud change. haha So with that I must say I've frequent many pizza places over the last few months and I have to say that the meatball pizza with the ricotta was a very CLOSE SECOND to my favorite woodfired pizza at Novacento.  Oohmygeerrrd it was so good!  I must have this again and soon!

People are always nice on the phone.  Our bill came to $37 (with coupon) including tip and I'm not sure if there was a delivery charge.  The delivery took about an hour to arrive which is pretty standard at dinner time.  I highly recommend North End.

Not for me....

The guy at the counter was very nice.  I asked for a few minutes to figure out what my husband and I wanted. We decided on a medium Supreme pizza (pepperoni, green peppers, mushrooms, onions and sausge), macaroni and cheese bites and garlic knots.  We asked for the garlic knots and macaroni and cheese bites first, while the pizza was in the oven. The garlic knots were very heavy and doughy. Not light and fluffy like we usually get at our other favorite pizza spots. The macaroni and cheese bites were ok.  My son liked them so that was a plus. When he brought out the pizza, it did not look appetizing at all. I really don't know how to describe it. We ate it anyway. Well, here were are two hours later.

Picture the bite:  Perfectly chewy, crusty with just the right amount of char on the bottom + tangy sweet tomato sauce + ooey gooey cheese + grease.

After patiently waiting the 3 minutes, which seemed like a life time, I finally said that I was there for a pick up.

I ordered a large pizza with pepperoni, sausage, mushroom and ricotta cheese.  One thing that I truly loved about this pie was the crust.  The bottom of the pizza had a nice char on it which prevented the slice from becoming soggy and droopy. Again, this place was just OK.

First off delivery was supposed to take 45 mins and knock on the door was 90 mins after order was placed, double the estimated time....now today at delivery time it was still 103 outside but pizza was cold...so much so the cheese was a solid mass....half was hamburger and meat was thrown ON TOP OF THE CHEESE.  Soooooo, naturally when it was cooked the hamburger turned into lumps of charcoal.....

So we called and talked to manager Ivo who offered to send another pizza.....yeah because I want another pizza like this in about two hours??   Oh hell no!  Manager, finally, despite it being clear there was a language barrier and much yelling on our part and an offer to return pizza to restaurant agrees to refund the cost of pizza....then I get to thinking....I paid online thru Grubhub how the hell can he refund me?   

So call Grubhub whose rep apologizes profusely and confirms refund would have to come from them not the restaurant but he would be happy to call and confirm our saga....and Ivo promptly tells him he will not authorize a refund only send out another pizza....and this after he said he would refund after we offered to bring him back the pizza we had and he said no he would take it off my card.....SO HE OUTRIGHT LIED TO US!   To give credit Grubhub rep was great and did give us $10 coupon which is all he could do with manager now refusing to authorize a refund...

There are many fake Yelp accounts giving this business 5 star reviews, I assume in an attempt to offset his sinking business. 

After all the ""Compliments"" used to threaten and bully anyone giving less than stellar reviews, how is this man still paying his bills??? These complements are all visible to the public and the more I look, the more I read and become disgusted. Not only should this place be out of business, but IVO (The Bulgarian owner) should be jailed and returned to his country. We don't need his behavior here. He bashes ""Americans"" on Yelp and to his employees. The baseball bat behind the counter and calling his teenage employees ""bitches"" is just some of the incredibly sickening things he gets away with daily. 

The Health dept needs to investigate this businesses habit of leaving food in the pots all shift and then placing the food in the fridge and back to the stove the next day. NOT GOOD! When a kid that's had the Health Card mentions how the food needs to be stored and handled other ways, he was called a ""bitch"". I have a child that worked for him for a week and REFUSED TO PAY HIM, and further told him to ""Get the F*** out"" of his store, my child feared the bat behind the counter and left. 

""Ivo""...(the boss or owner) has been witnessed treating employees like DIRT on multiple occasions when I've been there. 

Even if their food was TOP NOTCH, I would never support this lack of respect by any business towards their help! 

UPDATE: This same man sent a threatening ""compliment"" from a fake Yelp account to my Yelp account (same account left a POSITIVE review to NORTH END PIZZA), told me a ""gangster will kill me, and then he will p** and s*** on my dead body"". This man is mentally ill and employing innocent kids that are scared of his instability ! Thankfully he never gets personal information from them, but he only pays the long timers!

I wish someone had told us how big these were, they were so huge that you could easily share them between 2 people. Half of one and we were both stuffed. 

We also got the garlic knots, which were absolutely perfect. Hot, not too greasy, with a delicious marinara sauce. 

Considering the cost, $12 for each calzone, this is a GREAT deal, as two people can just share. Grab a calzone, a small garlic knots, and you'll have a super delicious meal under $20.

Okay; maybe it won't be THAT closed. But I don't anticipate North End Pizza being on the Food Network anytime soon either.

The major problem with North End Pizza is that I ordered a large cheese pizza (I'm broke, alright!) and they ran out of large boxes! What does this mean for me; the consumer? It means that I get my ONE large pizza spread out in EIGHT different sandwich bags each labeled 'sorry' with washable marker. Okay; I'm lying. But I would have preferred that over stacking the pieces on top of each other over two medium boxes leaving me with ten dollars of soggy, almost inedible cheese pizza! 

For the reason listed above, I can't really bring myself to pat North End Pizza on the back for ANYTHING! I hear some praise for the cleanliness of the place, but how hard is it to keep a restaurant clean when nobody is ever in it? The only reason this place doesn't get the distinct honor of being my first ONE star review is because I used to go to church. I feel bad for failing restaurants with a nice work crew.

3520296,2013-09-21,20,2bK1ng2mnRdtTh_BDNGmIg,"I have had this place bookmarked for a while and am glad we finally tried it. I felt like deep dish pizza and heard that North End puts out a good one. Walking inside we were greeted and told to sit anywhere. Looking around there were many pictures on the wall of movie posters and different sporting events as well family history of the owner and her family. A lot of Boston decor! The owner, Claudia, was there at a table not only eating, but saying hello to each customer and making sure they were enjoying their food. Claudia has her dad make the pizza dough at his restaurant in Boston, and then ships it to Las Vegas for use here at North End Pizza. Her mom makes the pizza sauce locally from her secret recipe.  

We started out with an order of ""Garlic Knots"" priced at $6.50 for an order of 12 knots and sauce. These weren't traditional since they were *not* in a *knot*, but more a disc if flavorless dough. With all of the seasoning on them, I didn't get it and would not order them again, knowing where I can get authentic ones at other restaurants in town. 

For the main course I ordered a ""1/2 Ricotta & Garlic 1/2 Sausage Pizza"" priced at  $22.99 including toppings. I ordered the Sicilian, which requires an hour for prep/bake time. If you know you want this then you can just call ahead and have them start it for you. The Sicilian only comes in 16 inch size. I really enjoyed this pizza! I tasted nothing but garlic on my half so I don't know where the garlic flavor was on the knots? The pizza dough was nice and thick and cooked thoroughly. We had more then enough left to take home for another meal! I want to come back and try their thin crust pizza next.

You can come in and buy pizza by the slice or try out some of their calzones, pasta, salads, sandwiches or appetizers. North End offers delivery/dine-in/carryout.

3685358,2017-03-26,1,2bK1ng2mnRdtTh_BDNGmIg,"Gotta say these guys make a great pie!

But the service/management needs an attitude check. 

I am a former customer who would ""carry out"" from them once every 2 weeks or so for several months. I had a few bad experiences... A few times they told me 20 minutes until my order would be ready, I'd arrive 20-30 minutes later and it still wasn't ready. Which is fine! Company's get busy! I get it. And another time my order was taken over the phone, but they didn't actually make the pizza until I arrived and tried to pick it up. Again, while no offer was given for the loss of service, I still said nothing. Mistakes happen! We're all human!

Which brings us to today. I placed an order over the phone as usual. ""20 minutes till it's ready."" Standard, until I had an emergency that prevented me from going to get the pizza. I already felt bad calling to cancel my order, especially when they told me the pizza was already made. But there was no way I could get the pie. 1 employee had a non sympathetic tone before placing me on hold (without telling me) and another came on the line, whose voice I recognized as the manager, to say, ""What am I going to do with the pizza?!"" When I didn't have an answer he told me that he would put me on a list to no longer take orders from my phone number.  I said I'm sorry several times but it apparently wasn't enough. 

Bottom line, this is not an angry rant. But more an effort to leave feedback for a company that has room for growth! You lost a repeat customer tonight for the cost of a medium meat lovers pizza (roughly $20). Was it really worth it?!

If you're a fan of New York style pizza definitely check these guys out! But consider dining in :)",ZIQ02ZB0sv5GW3THwklIEg,3,2,1,9vxhhVXaaSjEuzS0vkEuNQ

If you DO care about customer service, read onto the next half of my review: the food at this place comes lower than Digiorno. The pizza was cold, crust had no taste, ingredients over salty, the meatballs on it taste like the meatballs in Spaghetti-o's. The bread for subs taste like the bread comes from a generic Smith's brand. The garlic knots were dough-y and wayyyy too much oil. It looked like we had lip gloss on after eating them. None of the ingredients are of quality. You can tell they buy the cheapest crap they can then over charge you on it. Tastes NOTHING like NY pizza. To call themselves that is a disgrace. 

As far as customer service, this place does not do refunds even if THEY mess up. And don't even dare try to tell them they made a mistake or they will respond with a ""no refunds"" or a ""well what do you want me to do about it?"" How about run a good business, you ignorant pricks. We have ordered delivery twice and both times have been 20 minutes late so the food arrives cold. When I asked for a manager, they refused to give me the name. This is also the place that was on the news for calling a customer andher daughter ""fat bitches"" for givinf him a bad review. I wasn't there but I believe it. The owner is trash, judging by the one time I saw him and seen multiple times how he runs this restaurant. 
The place is run by a Bulgarian who recently bought the business and clearly has no people skills, no culinary knowledge on Italian food, and no personality to delegate as his employees suck as well - but I understand as he isn't the friendliest. Why WOULD they be nice when they have to report to a douche? He needs to manage a better, friendlier restaurant, have a chef come in to teach the staff better cooking and prep skills, and learn how to handle negative customer experiences like an adult, not like a 15 year old who forgot to take his bipolar medication.

I go to Novecento Pizza nearby. Much better quality, not cheap either but their ingredients are fresh and they offer a great menu. My tip to this business is leave Italian food to Italians or chefs and go work at a gas station. At 2 am. In the middle of nowhere on highway 5 where nobody has to run into you.

We have noticed a steep decline in the quality of service and food preparation since new ownership took over, a few years back. Since then, we have only ordered once every few months, desperate for pizza. After our last experience, coupled with a COMPLETE lack of respect for other patrons, we will never be back and will be sure to tell others about such poor service and food.

Be sure to avoid any sandwiches on their menu as they like soggy bread and assume everyone else loves soaked bread too. I love oil and vinegar on my sandwiches but the one I ordered was disgusting, as was my mother's!! I couldn't believe it. Yeah, one might be a screwup but both sandwiches?... That's a standard they have there, soak your buns in oil and vinegar. -_- ew

Honestly, their pizza isn't bad but it's nothing special for sure. They tote about how expensive their ingredients are when you can tell that's bull. And if it's not, maybe they don't know how to prepare quality ingredients?

Really, the kicker, is how poorly they respond to any criticism or feedback. Be humble, be gracious, and be strong. I don't expect you to bow down at customers' feet but acknowledge when you screw up and try to fix it! When my mother called to let them know she couldn't eat her sandwich with how soggy it is, they claimed it was fine when it left so she must have messed it up. What?

Blaming customers for their obvious screwups, poor overall quality customer service, poor quality food, and long delivery times are all why this place is on my ""never ever fckn go again""",giZgTnDxds-FQLi7nBxsBA,43,7,1,ww1bc9aul-cl7sLCeqJ4FA

It was the best pizza I have had in a long time!!!  Classic Margherita with delectable red sauce, crispy, light crust, melty mozz and wonderfully fresh torn basil. All the parts are simple but they work so well together. Margherita is my favorite pizza and I've tried it all over the place. This is one of the best out there. If you like this type of pizza, this is the place to get it. 

The chicken fingers were juicy and super tender. The sauce was tasty and they were served how I prefer which is not totally soaked in sauce but more like the sauce was cooked in. Perfect with their Ranch dressing.

Overall, I was perfectly pleased with everything. I used GrubHub to order and pay including the tip. They delivered it in a timely fashion. My only minor complaint was that is was warm, not hot when it arrived, but what can you expect from delivery?  I'm not sure how much delivery this business does so it may not be cost effective to invest in insulated delivery containers or in car heated containers.

The pizza was SO good! The sauce is probably the best pizza sauce I've ever had. The crust is tasty, and there was a good ratio of cheese to sauce to toppings. I'm sure that all boils down to personal preference though. If your go-to pizza is deep dish, then this may not be the place for you. I loved it though. 

The zucchini spears were great too. I've never had fried zucchini before, but hey it's really good!

The cannoli was good. Not the best I've ever had, but the filling was nice. 

And the place was packed when we got there. Seems like others like it too. 

I'd recommend this place for sure.

We've been going to this joint since it opened. Always loved the pizza. 
Whoever bought it out did not keep the damn recipes. It's super unfortunate. Because it wasn't good at all. Especially for the prices. This is not worth the debit card purchase that is now debited out of my checking account. 

We tried:

Pepperoni - so hard to get wrong. But they changed the crust. 
White pizza - no. It was so bad, I couldn't even finish it. For me, I almost always finish my food.

Overall, the pizza is very fresh and delicious.  We went with two white pizzas (what we always get), and they were very tasty.  The pizza here is thin crust, cut wide with plenty of goodies.

We also tried their garlic chips and garlic knots....yes, we had an overwhelming amount of garlic, but it was worth it :)  

Service was pretty quick for a fresh made pizza joint.

Only reason why I didn't step up to the 5th star was the pricing.  It was a reasonably priced place, but I think I spent $35+ for two small pizzas with one topping, garlic knots, and chips...no drinks.  It was worth it to me, but might not be to you...The specials look like a cheaper way to go...the two slices + drink etc.

It was very good, but for the hometown feel pizza joint and the atmosphere, it felt a little spendy.  For instance, Grimaldis is the about the same price, but has that cheap date night / glass of wine atmosphere.

I phoned in for pick up, as their delivery area is limited. When ordering they told me 15 mins., I got there in just under 15, maybe 12. My order was ready. I was hungry so stuck my hand into my bag with the side of fries-and they were fresh, hot, delicious! Did not check the pizza but, drove home in about 12 mins. Fries were still fresh, warm/crisp and delicious. I open the pizza box, and the pizza looked a little unappetizing. It looked like cold pizza (like when you see, left over pizza from your fridge, the next day) and didn't look super cheesy but, I was hungry so I dived into my medium with eggplant and mushrooms.

It was warm, and came to the conclusion it must have been done, like maybe 5-7 mins after I called in. So now at my house, it was about 20+ mins from being oven fresh. The toppings were plentiful-worth the $1 per ingredient, the crust was good but, soggy towards the middle-I'm guessing a result of being 20+ mins from oven freshness. Something interesting was the eggplant was thinly sliced, breaded and fried-not what I was expecting but OK-good I think.

Bottom line, pizza rating 3/5 - if I'm in Centennial and want a slice, I would stop here and try eating in, to see how I like the pizza fresh from the oven, it may make a big difference and result in a higher rating.",krdKDJfXT4EKZwWcOrW2wQ,3,0,3,owun8hwK_PDbEZ8cXNQ8IA

5278410,2015-08-19,4,2bK1ng2mnRdtTh_BDNGmIg,"I was finally able to cross North End Pizza off my bookmark list when my husband and I came here for dinner recently. Located off the 215 and Durango, North Pizza is nestled inside a small shopping center that houses Braddah's and a local Gyro shop. 

12"" VEGGIE CALZONE ($12.99): Large enough to feed two and piping hot. Very bland in flavor though. The calzone crust was the biggest disappointment. It was thin and appeared to not have been dressed with any type of seasonings, to include olive oil. It was just plain ol' dough. I have to say, I expected better from a pizza joint and have had better calzones at standard local's bars. 2/5 

CHICKEN WINGS x10 ($7.99): Served with only 1 choice of sauce but very satisfying for a hungry hunter like my husband. Husband said they were good, but still below BWW's. 4/5

FRIES ($2.59): We paid and extra $0.50 to have garlic added. A-OK. 3/5

VIBE: Is it just me, or do all these hole in the wall pizza places look exactly the same? Newspaper clippings, black and white photos of celebrities, and East Coast regalia line the walls. 3/5

SERVICE: Staff are dressed super causal but are friendly enough. 3/5 Food came out within 15 minutes for everything, although it came out in succession. The manager okay'd this with us first. 3/5

Worth a Return Visit?
We paid $29 and some change for our meal, which I thought was pretty expensive for what we got. There are plenty of pizza spots closer to home, and the food quality really doesn't justify a second trip back. I'll keep looking for that perfect calzone!

They get their dough shipped every couple months from a bakery in Lawrence, MA (I grew up not too far from there). Why? The hard water in Las Vegas is awful for making dough. Some pizzerias treat their water. Some claim to get their water shipped. Some don't care and just make crummy pizza.

North End Pizza is the best. I live in Mountains Edge and while it is a MASSIVE PAIN driving to northwest bum---- it is worth every mile. The pizza is the closest thing to home I've ever had in the valley. The crust is foldable, perfect consistency. Love it. Great ingredients. Its one of those places that, in Boston, would ""just be another place for pizza"" but in Vegas, where finding a great pizza is near impossible, it's THE place for pizza.
