Surprised this place isn't busier!",8g-IA2xZoWkt2Ui4ThQ90g,0,0,4,IZh5l1inCiAbq4IUI3BghQ
2240241,2014-12-16,1,Eufhdwi954UY-9MsdHjJKQ,Been a customer for years and highly recommended. The pizza is always made fresh in front of you and you bake it yourself. Many choices to decide from standard pizza and Chicago style. All amazing.,1ixlC0Lr_kTQc1I0EmlYgg,1,1,5,Cayq_IJMoj23uqkGp9AxAw

I realized it was the red sauce, it tasted so bad I couldn't finish my slice.  I went back to let them know how gross it was.  They brought out a huge book of complaints for me to write my complait in.  A HUGE BOOK!  Anyways, they allowed me to order another pizza.  This time I ordered my pizza with the white sauce.  It was better but it wasnt great either.  Little Ceasars or Digorno is 100 times better.  (BTW, you have to cook the pizza at home)  I will save my self trouble and just get digorno.  or go get a pizza thats already prepared for me.",n_a826hPtfMFnucaVwnqIg,0,0,2,XbcdGg_n806eBQtiYJq_dg

Filling out the survey with each pizza gives you great deals for the next visit, including FREE cheese bread.
My only suggestion for veggie-heavy pizzas is to broil the top after baking completely to make sure it doesn't get watery from all the fresh vegetables sweating out their liquids. READ THE DIRECTIONS THOROUGHLY. Stab the pizza multiple times while on a solid surface to make sure 1) no bubbles misplace any beautiful toppings and 2) you won't stab through the cardboard, leaking grease all over your oven.

Favorites:
Gourmet vegetarian with the olive oil and garlic sauce instead of the creamy and the veggie pizza with half red sauce, half creamy garlic.
Large signature pizzas are $13 (I believe) and the family size is $2 more.",7BPNf4ZDn-WJ4tvDI4gFBA,0,0,5,se3UH6m0YksZqwTK8JtyRg

4607973,2014-06-18,0,Eufhdwi954UY-9MsdHjJKQ,"Go and pick your own toppings, crust, sauce, etc and take it home and bake it. Actually pretty good pizza and the price is not bad. She loaded it with toppings which was awesome and hooked us up with whatever I wanted to add! Not the best pizza in the world but definitely as good as Dominoes or the like...",aeBNzHpVLhS9zri-4m4Pew,0,0,3,l6hhwPphXKifFsU1X2ZE9A
4946430,2017-02-06,0,Eufhdwi954UY-9MsdHjJKQ,"I can't believe it's taken me a quarter century to realize that the take-and-bake pizza store that is Papa Murphy's actually tastes better than its delivery competitors!  One day as a I was ordering a pizza for takeout, my friend recommended Papa Murphy's... I am now a convert.  Never again will I order delivery!  

The worst part of it all is this location is now closing for business on Feb 15.

I ordered an all meat pizza and was so glad that they don't skimp on any ingredients.  My favorite part is the added cheese on top!  Nobody else does that!  The coupons in the mail also make this an affordable option for those lazy Sunday's.  I actually forgot to order the thing crust this time but it is my favorite crust.  The regular crust is also very good and cooks nice and evenly with their included cardboard(?) pan.

Next time you consider ordering takeout or delivery, I recommend picking up a Papa Murphy's and baking it to your liking!  Don't forget to ask for their punch card!",9S52XHEyrvOv4OZxU6pCLw,0,2,5,JhNYbdG7aWR5QJlxdo6x9g

I loved the Cowboy, the first time we had that. 

We've also had the Chicken, bacon, artichoke thin crust, which was absolutely wonderful.

Yesterday, we tried the Chicago stuffed pizza...oh my god, it was SO good.
The pizza is huge.  I'm going to add pictures so you can see just how enormous this thing is. 

Great value for the money...I absolutely love this place.",renPzRDqMZpMaHiCD_e1_A,1,1,5,jvU7LuSwoTXuc1prdCCt9w
5353364,2017-02-17,1,Eufhdwi954UY-9MsdHjJKQ,"Came into this location as our first time ever to Papa Murphy's as we were given a coupon for a free large 1-topping pizza. We heard good things and were excited to try. We proceeded to give the lady our coupon and she told us that the coupon is not valid at that location, mind you there were no location limitations outlined anywhere on the coupon. 

My biggest issue was her attitude about it, very condescending. She claimed that the manager would give those types of coupons and that she is the manager and does NOT give those out! She could've handled things differently and maybe sell up the pizza, we may have just bought it, but if she really is the manager, then she has no business working with customers and especially being the manager. 

We almost didn't even attempt a different location, but we did. We went to the 7325 S. Rainbow location and it was a completely different experience. That crew is stellar, especially the manager! Making people want to come back, THAT'S how you provide great customer service.",pny6OA2QoTRdd4CCwxPGvw,0,0,1,NRCpuw2ZPhpGZNsxAoB6zg

Papa Murphy's has a stamp card and you get a free pizza after 10 visits, I believe. Don't forget to ask for one! ;)",0KeT9NKimYkHN0wlrij-dg,2,1,4,2JrrEOiSJzoqypi4Sn9YwQ
